SUMMARY 
Background 
Acutely occurring, life-threatening side effects of antipsychotics may contribute to the 
reduced life expectancy observed in patients with severe mental disorders. We examined this 
question by a meta-analysis of deaths occurring in placebo-controlled antipsychotic drug 
trials. 
 
Methods 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing second-generation-
antipsychotics with placebo across diagnostic categories. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
Cochrane CENTRAL, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, Pubmed, Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICTRP (last 
search 01/27/2017), and we contacted pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities 
for eligible trials. We examined mortality due to any reason (primary outcome), due to natural 
causes, suicide, and other unnatural causes. We synthesized the results with odds ratios (OR) 
in a common-effect meta-analysis. We investigated the effects of age, diagnostic category, 
gender, study duration, antipsychotic drug used, drug dose and polypharmacy with subgroup- 
and meta-regression-analyses (PROSPERO #CRD42016033930). 
 
Findings 
We included 596 RCTs that reported 207 deaths in 53804 patients on drug (0.38%) and 99 
deaths in 31184 patients on placebo (0.32%). Most trials (85%) were 13 weeks (3 month) or 
less in duration (median 6, interquartile range 4 - 10 weeks). There was no evidence of 
difference between antipsychotics and placebo regarding mortality due to any reason (OR 
1.19; 95% CI 0.93, 1.53), natural causes (OR 1.29; 95% CI 0.85, 1.94), suicide (OR 1.15; 
95% CI 0.47, 2.81) and other unnatural causes (OR 1.55; 95% CI 0.66, 3.63). Most subgroup 
and meta-regression analyses did not indicate any important effect moderators. The 
 3 
 
exceptions were increased mortality in patients with dementia (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.10, 2.21), 
elderly patients (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.01, 1.89), aripiprazole-treated patients (OR 2.20; 95% CI 
1.00, 4.86), and in studies with a higher percentage of women (regression coefficient 0.0251; 
95% Cr.I. 0.0104, 0.0399). However, the effects in the three latter subgroups were mainly 
based on the included dementia-trials. The result for schizophreniawas OR 0.69 (95% CI 0.35, 
1.35). 
 
Interpretation 
Overall, and for the main indication schizophrenia, there is no evidence from RCTs that 
antipsychotics increase mortality. However, there may be an increased risk for vulnerable 
populations (particularly patients with dementia). Of note, this meta-analysis could only 
address acute treatment effects leading to death in the short-term, but not long-term effects of 
antipsychotics on mortality.

INTRODUCTION 
People with schizophrenia and other severe mental disorders have a reduced life expectancy 
compared to the general population.1,2 Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay of the treatment 
of schizophrenia3, but they are also used for numerous other psychiatric and even non-
psychiatric diseases.4,5 If and how treatment with antipsychotics contributes to this increased 
mortality is strongly debated, with no consensus yet.6 Acutely occurring, life-threatening side 
effects and the consequences of chronically persisting side effects such as weight gain may 
both cause premature death. Decreased suicidality, aggression and accidents as well as better 
lifestyle and healthcare following reduced symptomatology, may however exert protective 
effects. Several observational studies found that antipsychotic drugs have no effect on 
mortality, or even reduce it as compared to no-treatment.7–15 Conversely, other observational 
studies reported increased mortality associated with antipsychotic treatment.16–19 Synthesis 
and interpretation of these results is difficult and have led to spirited discussion6,20–22 because 
of specific methodological issues in these studies, but also because of the general limitation 
that confounding can never be ruled out completely in observational data. Randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) offer the best source of evidence for estimating treatment effects, but 
single RCTs in this area are clearly underpowered due to the rarity of the outcome. 
Nevertheless, there are many antipsychotic drugs, and they have been tried for many 
indications. Thus, hundreds of trials for antipsychotics are now available, making meta-
analysis a more appropriate tool to examine these questions.  
We, therefore, conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing second-generation 
antipsychotics with placebo, including all diagnoses. Of course, most RCTs are short-term so 
that this analysis is restricted to estimating the acute effects of antipsychotics. However, there 
are 
many 
such 
side-effects 
such 
as 
arrhythmias, 
thromboembolisms, 
seizures, 
hyperglycemias, accidents due to over sedation and others which could lead to sudden deaths. 
We examined mortality due to any reason, due to natural causes, due to suicides and due to 
 5 
 
other unnatural causes. We also examined the effects in specific patient populations with 
various subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

METHODS 
We published the study protocol in PROSPERO (see CRD42016033930 and webappendix) 
and followed the PRISMA statement23 in the reporting of our results (checklist in 
webappendix). This meta-analysis was conducted in the context of a broader project 
sponsored by the German Ministry of Education and Research which also comprises an 
assessment of serious adverse events. This outcome will be published in another paper. 
 
Search strategy and selection criteria 
We searched for published and unpublished RCTs comparing the following second-
generation antipsychotics (SGAs) available in Europe or the US with placebo: amisulpride, 
aripiprazole, asenapine, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, clozapine, iloperidone, lurasidone, 
olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone, zotepine. First-
generation antipsychotic drugs, which were used as additional active treatments in these 
RCTs, were also included. There were no restrictions in terms of type of application (oral, 
intravenous, inhalers, short- and long-acting (depot) intramuscular applications, all either in 
monotherapy or as add-on-medication), and doses (any dose, in flexible and fixed dosing 
regimens). 
 
Studies were included irrespectively of the diagnosis of the participants, because we deemed 
that side-effects (in contrast to efficacy) are relatively independent of the specific mental 
illness. Also we applied no restrictions in terms of age, sex, or ethnic groups. However we 
examined treatment effects in vulnerable subgroups, such as children and elderly patients, in 
predefined subgroup analyses (see below). 
 
Double-blind, single-blind, or open-label RCTs were eligible, but studies with a high risk of 
bias in sequence generation for randomization or allocation concealment24 were a priori 
 7 
 
excluded. There were no restrictions in study length except for very short (≤24h) studies that 
addressed neuropsychological rather than treatment questions (e.g. measuring task-induced 
brain activation in fMRT). Also, there were no restrictions in publication year and language. 
Only studies from mainland China for which major quality concerns have been raised25–27 
were excluded. 
 
The primary outcome was mortality for any reason. As secondary outcomes we examined 
mortality due to natural causes, suicide, and other non-natural causes (e.g. accidents). 
 
We searched the following electronic databases, all from their inception, with broad terms for 
randomization, the generic names of the included SGAs, and terms for placebo: MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Randomized Trials (CENTRAL), BIOSIS, 
PsycINFO, Pubmed, Clinicaltrial.gov and WHO ICTRP (last search 27th January 2017; 
detailed search terms in webappendix). The European Union Clinical Trials Register 
(EUCTR) was searched manually. We also contacted the manufacturers of the antipsychotics, 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the 
German “Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte” (BfArM), and searched their 
clinical trial websites. 
 
Screening of title and abstracts and selection of included studies (after full text retrieval and 
cross-referencing), was done in duplicate by JS and another reviewer (HR or LR) and 
disagreement was solved by discussion with SL. 
Data extraction was done independently by at least two reviewers (JS, HR, LR, MH and MK), 
using an electronic database which allowed to automatically check whether extractions 
agreed. Disagreement was solved by discussion among reviewers; if it could not be resolved a 
third reviewer (JS or SL) was involved. Moreover, we sent personalized emails to all 
 8 
 
corresponding authors and asked them for missing data (for 689 authors e-mail addresses 
were found). Risk of bias was also assessed in duplicate by the reviewers mentioned above 
using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.24 
 
Data analysis 
We used a common-effect (“fixed-effect”) Mantel-Haenszel meta-analysis model to 
synthesize odds-ratios (OR).28 We chose OR because time to event data, which are necessary 
for the calculation of hazard ratios were usually not reported. The Mantel-Haenszel-method 
synthesizes information from studies with at least one fatal event, i.e. it excludes studies with 
no events. We included all deaths that occurred in the randomized phase or within the studies’ 
predefined safety follow-up phases after study discontinuation or completion (these usually 
last 30 days) in the primary analysis (see also sensitivity analysis 1 below). From cross-over 
studies we used only the first phases to avoid carry-over effects.29 Heterogeneity was 
statistically assessed by estimating 𝜏2, 𝐼2 and by performing a Q-test.24 Small study effects 
(linked with the possibility of publication bias) were evaluated by visual inspection of a 
funnel plot and a Harbord test.30 
 
We performed pre-planned sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of the primary 
outcome: 
1. Following an analysis by the FDA on suicidality associated with antidepressants,31 we 
included only those deaths that occurred during the randomized phase or 24 hours after 
the last drug administration. In the safety-follow-up periods effects may be diluted, 
because patients, for example, take other pharmaceutical substances.  
2. We synthesized mortality rates (number of deaths over total patient-years per study) to 
account for potential differences in premature study discontinuation between drug- and 
placebo-arms. If information on the total patient-years spent in the study was not 
 9 
 
available, it was estimated from study duration and number of dropouts, after assuming a 
linear rate of discontinuation over time. 
3. We performed additional sensitivity analyses using a hypergeometric normal model,32 as 
well as a correlated beta-binomial (Sarmanov) model.33 We also performed a Bayesian 
common-effects and Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis. For the latter we used an 
informative prior distribution for heterogeneity.34 Of note, the beta-binomial model and 
the Bayesian models use information from studies without events.   
4. The primary analysis included only studies in which the outcome (number of deaths) was 
actively reported. In a sensitivity analysis (Bayesian random effects model) we included 
studies that did not explicitly mention this outcome and assumed that no death had 
occurred (see discussion for further details concerning this assumption). 
 
A priori planned subgroup analyses of the primary outcome addressed (i) study duration (less 
than 6 days; 6 days to 13 weeks; more than 13 weeks), (ii) age groups (children and 
adolescents; adults; elderly), (iii) diagnosis (e.g. schizophrenia or bipolar disorder), (iv) 
specific antipsychotic drug used and (v) monotherapy versus combinations of antipsychotics 
(any systematic combination; add-on to antidepressants, mood stabilizers or antipsychotics). 
 
Meta-regression analyses were performed for the primary outcome to assess the effect of (i) 
the percentage of women, and (ii) antipsychotic dose in olanzapine equivalents based on the 
International Consensus Study of Antipsychotic Dosing.3,35 In (ii) only studies of oral 
application in adult patients were included because other dose equivalencies may apply for 
other age groups and applications. 
 
In post-hoc sensitivity analyses we excluded dementia trials, because dementia turned out to 
be a possible treatment effect modifier (see discussion for further reasoning). 
 10 
 
 
Mantel-Haenszel-meta-analysis were performed in R using the metabin command from the 
package meta.36 Mortality rates (sensitivity analysis 2) were synthesized in R using the 
metafor package,37 fitting a common-effect effects Poisson regression model. 
The hypergeometric-normal model and the correlated beta-binomial model  (sensitivity 
analysis 3) were fitted in R using the metafor package,37  and the code provided by Chen et 
al.,33 respectively. Bayesian meta-analyses (sensitivity analyses 3 and 4) and meta-regressions 
were performed in OpenBUGS.38,39 Details of the statistical models are presented in the 
webappendix. The strength of the evidence was assessed within the GRADE framework40 
using the online tool GRADE PRO (https://gradepro.org/).

RESULTS 
We present the PRISMA23 flow diagram in figure 1 and the characteristics of included studies 
in the webappendix. We included 596 trials published between 1978 and 2017 with a total of 
108747 participants. 352 studies (84988 participants), of which 346 were double-blind, with 
actively reported information about deaths constitute the main dataset for our meta-analysis. 
244 additional studies with no information on fatal events were included in a sensitivity 
analysis. In the main dataset, the most frequently used drugs were quetiapine (75 studies), 
olanzapine (73), aripiprazole (66), risperidone (65), paliperidone (30), haloperidol (19; the 
only first-generation antipsychotic for which studies were found), ziprasidone (14), asenapine 
(12), cariprazine (10), and lurasidone (10). For all other drugs less than 10 studies were 
available. Most trials included patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (111 of 352 RCTs), but 
there were also 22 other diagnostic categories. The latter comprise other approved indications 
for some antipsychotics, such as bipolar disorder (90 RCTs) or major depressive disorder (32 
RCTs), but also diagnostic categories without official approval. Most studies were conducted 
in adults (usually 18-65 years), but 11% and 12% of the studies were on “elderly patients” and 
on “children and adolescents”, respectively. The median percentage of females was 43% 
(interquartile range (IQR) 29% - 58%). As there were studies on acute agitation as well as 
studies for relapse-prevention, trial durations varied between 1.5 hours to 104 weeks (median 
6 weeks, IQR 4-10). 300 (85%) of 352 studies were 13 weeks (3 month) or less in duration. 
Of note, only 20 studies (5.7%) fell in the very short-term category (<5 days), and duration 
was examined in a subgroup analysis. 
 
The risk of bias assessment is shown in the webappendix. We conservatively judged all 
studies that did not explicitly report on death as possible selective reporting. Therefore high 
risk of bias was frequent in this category (210 reports, 35% of all studies). Studies rated at 
high risk of bias were rare in the other categories: Randomization 0 (0%), allocation 
 12 
 
concealment 0 (0%), blinding of participants and personal 19 (3.2%), blinding of outcome 
assessment 14 (2.3%), incomplete outcome data 11 (1.8%) and other bias 17 (2.9%). 
 
Outcome results 
Overall there were 306 deaths; 207 in 53804 patients on drug (0.38%), 99 in 31184 patients 
on placebo (32%). In all results, an odds ratio >1 corresponds to higher odds of mortality with 
antipsychotics (favors placebo). In the following text the number of studies (k) and 
participants (n) vary depending on the statistical model. The Mantel-Haenszel model uses 
only studies with at least one event whereas in sensitivity analyses studies with zero events 
were also included. 
The summary OR for the primary outcome all-cause mortality was 1.19 (95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.53; k=91, n=29049). For mortality due to natural causes it was 1.29 
(95% CI 0.85, 1.94; k=43, n=13994), for suicides 1.15 (95% CI 0.47, 2.81; k=18, n=6749) 
and for mortality due to other unnatural causes 1.55 (95% CI 0.66, 3.63; k=23, n=7493) (table 
1; forest plots and table of specific causes of death in webappendix).  
 
Sensitivity analyses  
The sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome did not materially change the results (table 
2). When studies that did not explicitly report on death were included, the summary OR for 
mortality from was 1.13 (95% Cr.I. 0.87, 1.47; crude mortality of drug 0.31% and placebo 
0.25%; k=581, n=107655). When we excluded fatal events that occurred more than 24 hours 
after the last drug administration, the odds ratio was 0.90 (95% CI 0.55, 1.47; k=31, 
n=10618). Moreover, when we used mortality rates instead of frequencies, we found an 
incidence rate ratio of 0.89 (95% CI 0.54, 1.47; k=30, 2363 patient-years) referring to 6.4 and 
6.7 events per 1000 patient-years for drug and placebo, respectively. Analyses with 
hypergeometric-normal, beta-binomial and Bayesian models did not change our conclusions. . 
 13 
 
Excluding dementia studies in the post-hoc sensitivity analysis resulted in an OR of 0.85 
(95% CI 0.59, 1.23; k=69, n=22704) in the primary outcome. 
 
Subgroup and meta-regression analyses 
Most subgroup and meta-regression analyses did not indicate any important effect moderators 
(table 3). The exceptions were increased mortality in elderly patients, patients with dementia, 
aripiprazole-treated patients, and in studies with a higher percentage of women. However, 
tests for subgroup differences were not significant. Furthermore, when dementia studies were 
excluded in the post-hoc sensitivity analyses none of these subgroups revealed significantly 
increased mortality (table 3 and discussion).  
For patients with schizophrenia – the main indication of all antipsychotics – there was no 
evidence of an effect (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.35, 1.35; k=31, n=11680). Of note, although 
schizophrenia (and related disorders) was the most frequent diagnostic category in the 
primary analysis (111/352 studies (32%), 32807/84988 patients (39%)), only few deaths were 
reported for this subgroup (20 deaths in 22355 patients on drug (0.09%) and 16 deaths in 
10452 patients on placebo (0.15%)).  
 
There was no indication of small study effects (Harbord test p=0.50, funnel plot in 
webappendix). Regarding heterogeneity, for all analyses the standard deviation of random 
effects (𝜏2) was estimated to be 0, 𝐼2 = 0 and also all Q-tests did not provide evidence for 
heterogeneity for any of the analyses (p-values > 0.89 in all analyses). One should keep in 
mind, however, that for the case of rare events the estimation of statistical heterogeneity can 
be very difficult. Thus, in order to assess the robustness of our results, we also performed a 
Bayesian sensitivity analysis including external information (in the form of informative prior 
distributions) for heterogeneity. This analysis did not give markedly different results from the 
 14 
 
primary analysis. The strength of the evidence was rated to be moderate for all outcomes 
according to GRADE (summary of findings tables in webappendix).40

DISCUSSION 
In this meta-analysis of 596 RCTs, we did not find evidence that mortality related to acute 
antipsychotic drug effects differs between patients treated with antipsychotic drugs or 
placebo, neither for all-cause mortality nor for death due to natural causes, suicides or other 
unnatural causes, except for people with dementia. 
 
Strengths of the analysis are the comprehensive search and the resulting large sample size 
(84988 patients with information about mortality). This large sample size was in part achieved 
by including studies across diagnostic categories, assuming that severe side-effects leading to 
death are relatively independent of the treated mental disorders. Moreover, we also examined 
the impact of clinically important effect modifiers such as diagnosis, age, gender, specific 
antipsychotic drug, antipsychotic doses and polypharmacy. 
 
In contrast to Khan et al. 2007 and 201341,42 who found a significantly reduced mortality for 
people with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics compared to placebo, we did not find a 
significant difference. Khan et al. evaluated deaths per cumulative patient-years in FDA-
approval-trials for schizophrenia. However, this analysis also included trials that compared 
two antipsychotics with each other rather than with placebo. The death rates in the pooled 
drug groups were compared with the pooled placebo groups, instead of first calculating an 
effect size for each study separately. This method breaks the randomization of the studies, and 
thus it is a suboptimal approach. Moreover, the authors included non-randomized open-label 
long-term-extensions, in which all patients were on drug, which can lead to a selection bias of 
patients who tolerate antipsychotics. Therefore, as Khan et al.41,42 and others43 discuss, these 
findings might be biased in favor of drug-treatment. Nevertheless, our point estimate in the 
schizophrenia subgroup was similar to that of Khan et al. 2013 (0.69 vs. ca. 0.40 there). 
Although our confidence interval was very large (95% CI 0.35, 1.35), it is possible that 
 16 
 
antipsychotic drugs have protective effects for indications in which they are efficacious (in 
particular schizophrenia). A much smaller meta-analysis (5919 participants) restricted to long-
acting injectable antipsychotics in schizophrenia44 came to conclusions similar to ours. 
 
Our findings concur with those of a meta-analysis which also found an increased risk of death 
associated with second-generation-antipsychotics in the treatment of dementia;45  however, 
our dataset included nine (=60%) more studies, 1264 (25%) more participants and 27 (17%) 
more fatal events. Therefore, our study is more than just a replication. Of note, Hulshoff et 
al.46 found no significant differences between first-generation antipsychotics and placebo in 
elderly patients with dementia or delirium, but the sample size was small (17 RCTs with 2387 
participants). Interestingly, when we excluded dementia studies from the overall sample in a 
sensitivity analysis, the all-cause-mortality (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.59, 1.23) suggested decreased 
mortality with antipsychotics. 
 
Our subgroup analyses also indicated increased mortality in elderly patients, women and 
aripiprazole-treated patients. However, the dementia studies had a relatively high impact on 
the results in these subgroups. 87% (186/214) of all fatal events in elderly people occurred in 
patients with dementia. Women are overrepresented in dementia trials; in these studies they 
contributed 68% (4023/5886) of the sample, compared to 47% (37907/81122) overall. Most 
deaths (69%, 29/42) in the aripiprazole-trials occurred in dementia-patients and there is no 
external evidence for an elevated risk related to this drug. On the contrary, aripiprazole is 
known for producing comparably few side effects,3 and in recent analyses of Swedish 
registers it was associated with less mortality than many other antipsychotics.12,47 Therefore, it 
was not surprising that in sensitivity analyses without dementia studies there was no evidence 
of an effect in any of these subgroups. Moreover, there is a chance that subgroup-findings are 
false positive, due to multiple testing issues. 
 17 
 
 
Our review has some limitations. We judged the strength of the evidence for the primary 
outcome to be only moderate according to the GRADE framework. The reason was that, 
despite the large sample size, effect sizes were imprecise. The number-needed-to-harm 
(NNH) for all-cause mortality was 6 more deaths in 10 000 patients treated with 
antipsychotics compared to placebo, with a 95% CI ranging from 2 less to 14 more. Although 
the numbers are more favorable for the drug when dementia patients are excluded (3 deaths 
less under antipsychotics in 10 000 patients, 95% CI 9 less to 4 more), there is still 
uncertainty. We decided to downgrade for imprecision if the confidence interval included 
both, the possibility of no difference and the possibility of one death more in the drug group 
compared to placebo for one thousand patients treated (i.e. 10 more in 10 000 patients 
treated). This decision is corroborated by a post-hoc power analysis that yielded a power of 
27% of finding a statistical significant result for our primary outcome. We feel that despite 
this limitation our data are clinically useful because the just mentioned confidence intervals 
provide boundaries within which the real effect is reasonably expected to lie (details and 
NNH for secondary outcomes see GRADE in webappendix). Second, in many studies it was 
not explicitly reported whether deaths had occurred. Because death is a rare event, we 
assumed it to be likely that in most of these cases no deaths had occurred, and that usually the 
original authors did not find it important to report “no deaths”, rather than intentionally 
suppressing information. Also, we did not judge the studies, for which we only found 
protocols (see PRISMA diagram in webappendix), to represent an important publication bias 
for our analysis of mortality. Other reasons than occurrence of fatal events, such as recruiting 
failure or unfavorable efficacy data, seem more probable for not further conducting or 
reporting these trials, and the statistical tests did not provide any evidence of small study 
effects. Third, participants in randomized-controlled trials are selected populations. 
Particularly vulnerable patients, such as those with serious medical illness, are often excluded. 
 18 
 
Finally, the duration of RCTs is limited and 85% of the trials in the analysis were conducted 
over a time-span of 13 weeks (3 month) or less (median 6, IQR 4 - 10 weeks). Consequently, 
our analysis focused on acute treatment effects leading to death on the short term. Therefore, 
we could not assess how much chronic antipsychotic side effects, such as weight gain, 
contribute to the documented excess mortality over the patients’ life-span.1 The impact of 
such long-lasting adverse events can only be explored in observational studies. These designs, 
however, as already explained in the introduction section, have their own limitations and 
yielded conflicting results.7–19 We therefore hope that this work, which represents the largest 
meta-analysis of mortality in randomized antipsychotic drugs trials to date, will inform the 
polarized discussion about the safety of these drugs.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT 
 
Evidence before this study: 
It is heatedly debated whether and how much antipsychotic drugs may contribute to the 
documented excess mortality of people with severe mental illnesses. Acutely occurring, life-
threatening side effects and the consequences of persisting chronic side-effects may both 
cause premature death. Observational studies on the topic were contradictory, and, in those 
studies, confounding can never be ruled out completely. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
are the best evidence to estimate causal effects, but given the rarity of death as an event, 
single RCTs are clearly underpowered. We, therefore, searched PubMed for meta-analyses of 
randomized-controlled trials with the question whether antipsychotic drugs increase or 
decrease mortality compared to placebo (search terms: “antipsychotic* AND (death OR 
mortality), publication type: review OR meta-analysis”, last search: September 2017). We 
found two such systematic reviews restricted to people with dementia, in one of which a 
significantly increased mortality was documented for second generation antipsychotics, and a 
small meta-analysis restricted to depot antipsychotics for schizophrenia which showed no 
difference. A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis across all diagnostic 
categories did not exist.  
 
Added value of this study: 
We present the first meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing antipsychotic 
drugs with placebo over all diagnostic categories and age-groups, thus reaching a sample size 
of 596 trials with 108747 participants. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, but we 
also examined mortality due to natural causes, suicides and other unnatural causes. Moreover, 
we addressed important subgroups such as diagnostic categories, age groups, gender, specific 
antipsychotic drugs used, antipsychotic doses and polypharmacy. We found no evidence for 
 21 
 
increased mortality in people treated with antipsychotics in the overall population and in most 
subgroups. The exception is patients with dementia for whom a subgroup analysis suggested 
an increased risk. Of note, our analysis could only address mortality related to acute effects of 
antipsychotics because most RCTs are short-term studies. 
 
Implications of all the available evidence: 
Overall, there is no randomized evidence for increased short-term-mortality to be associated 
with antipsychotic drugs. However, for vulnerable subgroups, such as patients with dementia, 
antipsychotic treatment may add an additional risk of death which should be considered when 
prescribing such drugs.

* 15 studies were not included in the sensitivity analysis because the number of patients in total or per study arm was missing (13 studies) or because it was indicated that there 
were deaths, but it was unclear in which study phase or study arm (2 studies). One study (31 patients) reported deaths only for the control arm, but not for the active arm. 
Therefore, this study with events was only included in this sensitivity analysis.

OR = Odds ratio; 95% CI = 95% Confidence Interval; 95% Cr.I. = 95% Credibility Interval: n.e. = not estimable; Numbers in parentheses are based on studies with at least one 
fatal event. Crude frequencies (Death/patients in %) are based on all studies with information about mortality, i.e. including studies that reported that no deaths occurred 
* 3 studies with 105 patients included several age groups. 
† Excluding dementia trials from the analysis resulted in an OR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.35, 1.57), corresponding to 15 deaths in 1442 patients (1.04%) exposed to drug and 13 deaths 
in 967 patients (1.34%) exposed to placebo 
‡ 3 studies allowed several SGAs (drug 100 patients, placebo 144 patients) in the intervention group. Additionally chlorpromazine was used as active comparator in 2 studies, but 
no information on mortality was available. The latter 2 studies were only included in the sensitivity analysis “Including studies not reporting on mortality (assuming that no 
deaths occurred)” 
§ Excluding dementia trials from the analysis resulted in an OR of 2.92 (95% CI 0.62, 13.63), corresponding to 8 deaths in 7878 patients (0.10%) exposed to drug and 2 deaths in 
5546 patients (0.04%) exposed to placebo 
 34 
 
¶ The first-generation antipsychotic haloperidol was included, because it was used as an active control in studies comparing second-generation antipsychotics to placebo (see 
methods). 
‖ Regression coefficient for increase in logOR (logarithmic Odds ratios) per mg olanzapine equivalent, corresponding to Odds ratios of 0.55, 0.66, 0.80, 0.97, and 1.18 for studies 
with mean doses of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg olanzapine equivalents, respectively. 
** Regression coefficient for increase in logOR (logarithmic Odds ratios) per 1% increase in women, corresponding to Odds ratios of 0.56, 1.05 and 1.97 for study populations 
with 25%, 50%, and 75% female patients, respectively. 
††Excluding dementia trials from the analysis resulted in a regression coefficient of -0.16 (95% Cr.I. -2.30, 1.95
