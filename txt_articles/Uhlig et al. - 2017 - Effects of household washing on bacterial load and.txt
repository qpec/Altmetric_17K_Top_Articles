Abstract
Customer demands for fresh salads are increasing, but leafy green vegetables have 
also been linked to food- 
borne illness due to pathogens such as Escherichia coli 
O157:H7. As a safety measure, consumers often wash leafy vegetables in water be-
fore consumption. In this study, we analyzed the efficiency of household washing to 
reduce the bacterial content. Romaine lettuce and ready- 
to- 
eat mixed salad were 
washed several times in flowing water at different rates and by immersing the leaves 
in water. Lettuce was also inoculated with E. coli before washing. Only washing in a 
high flow rate (8 L/min) resulted in statistically significant reductions (p < .05), “Total 
aerobic count” was reduced by 80%, and Enterobacteriaceae count was reduced by 
68% after the first rinse. The number of contaminating E. coli was not significantly re-
duced. The dominating part of the culturable microbiota of the washed lettuce was 
identified by rRNA 16S sequencing of randomly picked colonies. The majority be-
longed to Pseudomonadaceae, but isolates from Enterobacteriaceae and Staphyloco­
ccacea 
ceae were also frequently found. This study shows the inefficiency of tap water 
washing methods available for the consumer when it comes to removal of bacteria 
from lettuce. Even after washing, the lettuce contained high levels of bacteria that in 
a high dose and under certain circumstances may constitute a health risk.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Lettuce is a healthy component in our diet, and ready- 
to- 
eat lettuce in 
plastic bags has become a widespread and convenient alternative to 
include “greens” on an everyday basis.
The microbiota of leafy green vegetables is varied and can contain 
pathogens or potential pathogens (Jackson, Randolph, Osborn, & Tyler, 
2013), and at a number of occasions this produce has been involved in 
outbreaks of food- 
borne illness (Doyle & Erickson, 2008; Painter et al., 
2013). Leafy green vegetables are sensitive to bacterial contamination 
and multiplication. Bacteria can be transferred to the lettuce from 
soil, manure, water, equipment, and people (Castro- 
Rosas et al., 2012; 
Doyle & Erickson, 2008). Processing can induce leaf damage that pro-
motes bacterial growth (Gleeson & O’Beirne, 2005). Additionally, as 
these products are eaten raw, handling has to be done with meticulous 
care both in the production chain and at home.
Attempts to improve the microbial status of lettuce products 
have been performed through both physical and chemical means. 
The  
effectiveness of irradiation on human pathogens is limited, 
the  
consumer acceptance of irradiated foods remains low (Parish 
 1216  |    
UHLIG et aL.
et al., 2003), and the authorities in many countries remain skeptical. 
Ultrasound can kill some bacteria by intracellular cavitation but the 
method is not very efficient, especially not in the presence of solids 
(Gil, Selma, López- 
Gálvez, & Allende, 2009). Washing with the addition 
of sanitation agents reduce bacterial levels, but it also raises concern 
about negative, long- 
term health effects and about environmental 
consequences. Chemicals like chlorine have been banned in some 
countries in Europe, for example, Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland 
(Gil et al., 2009; Parish et al., 2003). Unfortunately, most of the sani-
tizing solutions applied in industrial handling, even if efficient at first, 
fail to retain the effect when the product reaches the customer due to 
rapid bacterial regrowth (Allende, Selma, López- 
Gálvez, Villaescusa, & 
Gil, 2008).
Thus, the question remains: Can the consumer influence the sit-
uation by household washing with clean water? This question may 
at first glance appear self- 
evident, but in fact, when it comes to the 
bacterial reduction by household washing, very few data from the 
literature is available. We have only found one study where Listeria 
inoculated lettuce leaves were immersed in water which reduces the 
number of Listeria (Natsou, Rhoades, Smirniotis, Makri, & Kontominas, 
2012). However, the effect of washing on the native flora was not 
considered. Otherwise, previous studies have focused on the effi-
ciency of commercially available sanitation agents, and the risk of 
cross- 
contamination of specific pathogens in industrial and domestic 
environments (Baur, Klaiber, Wei, Hammes, & Carle, 2005; Beuchat, 
1998; Jensen, Friedrich, Harris, Danyluk, & Schaffner, 2015; Nou & 
Lou, 2010; Vijayakumar, 2002). The aim of the present study is to give 
an answer to the question if household washing of lettuce can be ex-
pected to have any effect on the bacterial load in general, and on con-
taminating E .coli in particular.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Lettuce
Six bags of whole romaine lettuce heads (Lactuca sativa) and 18 bags 
of ready- 
to- 
eat mixed salad containing friseé (Cichorium endivia var. 
crispum), red salad (Lactuca sativa), and red mangold (Beta vulgaris) 
were purchased at a supermarket in Lund, Sweden in February 2016 
and brought directly to the laboratory. Samples were of the same 
brand throughout all experiments. For each washing procedure, the 
samples were purchased on the same day, and originated from the 
same lot. The core and outer leaves from the romaine lettuce were re-
moved and discarded before the remaining leaves were cut into square 
pieces (approx 4 × 4 cm) (as it often is done in the household) prior to 
analysis. Nothing was discarded from the ready- 
to- 
eat mixed salad.
2.2 | Washing
Before washing, one sample of 10 g from each package was taken 
out for analysis. The remaining lettuce was then washed by two dif-
ferent procedures, rinsing in a colander under flowing water, and by 
immersion in a container with water. Both washing procedures were 
performed in sets of 6 packages. Rinsing was carried out on 3 sets; 
one set of ready- 
to- 
eat salad rinsed at a flow of 2 L/min, one set of 
ready- 
to- 
eat salad rinsed at a flow of 8 L/min and one set with ro-
maine lettuce rinsed at a flow of 8 L/min. Immersion was carried out 
on 2 sets; one set of ready- 
to- 
eat salad and one set of romaine lettuce.
With rinsing, the contents were rinsed separately in colanders 
under a potable water tap; the salad mixtures were washed in running 
tap water for 20 s, and one sample of 10 g per package was thereafter 
taken out for analysis. The remaining leaves were rinsed 4 more times 
during 20 s each time, and after a total of 5 washes, another 10 g sam-
ple per package was taken out for analysis. This resulted in a total of 
6 unwashed samples, 6 samples from the first wash (total wash water 
volume of 0.67 L) and 6 samples from the fifth wash (total wash water 
volume of 3.33 L) for each set.
With immersion, the content of 6 mixed salad packages of the 
same brand were washed in a container with 2 L potable water and 
shaken at 200 rpm for 30 s. One sample of 10 g per package was taken 
out for analysis and the remaining leaves were immersed 4 more times 
during 30 s each time, and after a total of 5 immersions, another 10 g 
sample per package was taken out for analysis. Between each immer-
sion, the washing water was changed.
2.3 | Escherichia coli inoculation of romaine lettuce
E. coli for inoculating romaine lettuce was prepared by transferring 
1 μl of nonpathogenic E. coli CCUG 29300 (culture stored at −80°C in 
Hogness’ freezing media (36 mmol/L K2HPO4, 13.2 mmol/L KH2PO4, 
0.4 mmol/L MgSO4, 1.7 mmol/L Na3- 
citrate, 6.8 mmol/L (NH4)2SO4, 
4.4% (v/v) glycerol)) to 5 ml Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) (Fluka, Missouri, 
USA) and incubating for 24 hr. After a subsequent centrifugation 
(4,600g, 5 min (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5804, Germany)), the pellet was 
washed twice with peptone water (0.85% NaCl and 0.1% bacteriologi-
cal peptone (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK)) and diluted to a concentration 
of log10 6 CFU/ml (assessed by colony count and spectrophotometry 
(Novaspec II, Pharmacia, Sweden)).
Six separate heads of romaine lettuce (100 g per head) were cut 
according to previous description and to each 100 g sample, 1 ml inoc-
ulum and 200 ml potable tap water was added to give a final concen-
tration of 5000 CFU/ml of E. coli. The bags were incubated at 4°C for 
24 hr and then washed by immersion in water and sampled according 
to the procedure described above.
2.4 | Microbial analysis
Viable count was performed on 10 g salad mixture or romaine let-
tuce samples. Each 10 g sample was homogenized in 90 ml peptone 
water for 2 min at high frequency on a Laboratory Blender Stomacher 
400 (Seward Medical, London, UK). A diluted sample volume of 
0.1 ml was spread with glass beads on duplicate plates. Brilliant E. coli 
Coliform selective Agar (ECBA) (Oxoid) for plate count of E. coli. Violet 
Red Bile Dextrose agar (VRBD) (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, 
Germany) for count of Enterobacteriaceae, and Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) 
(Fluka, Missouri, USA) was used for “total aerobic count”. The ECBA 
     |  1217

and VRBD plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hr and the TSA plates 
were incubated at 30°C for 3 days.
In order to get an idea of the dominating culturable bacterial taxa 
of the total aerobic count and the Enterobacteriaceae count, 2 colo-
nies per sample, or 36 colonies per set, in total 180 colonies, were 
randomly picked from countable plates of TSA and VRBD. Picked iso-
lates were restreaked to purity, resuspended in freezing medium, and 
stored at −80°C until identification.
2.5 | Sequencing of bacterial isolate DNA
Picked isolates were inoculated on TSA (Fluka) and incubated at 
30°C for 3 days. Approximately log10 8 cells could be harvested from 
each culture. The cells were suspended in 0.5 ml physiological sa-
line followed by bead beating on an Eppendorf Mixer (model 5432, 
Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) for 30 minutes. After centrifuga-
tion at 600g for 30 s, the supernatant was used as template DNA in 
the subsequent Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). An approximately 
1500 bp long fragment of the rRNA gene (16S) was amplified using 
the forward primer ENV1 (5′- 
AGAGTTTGATIITGGCTCAG- 
3′) and the 
reverse primer ENV2 (5′- 
CGG ITA CCT TGT TAC GAC TT- 
3′) (Eurofins 
Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany). The PCR was performed according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions with TopTaq DNA Polymerase (Qiagen, 
Netherlands). The total volume of the PCR reaction was 25 μl, consist-
ing of 0.2 μmol/L of ENV1 and ENV2, 2,5 μl 10× TopTaq PCR Buffer 
(Tris- 
HCl, KCl, (NH4)2SO4, 15 mmol/L MgCl2, pH 8.7), 200 μmol/L of 
each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 0.625 U of TopTaq 
DNA Polymerase and 10–20 ng of template DNA. The PCR was per-
formed by a Mastercycler gradient (Eppendorf) under the following 
conditions: 95°C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 
50°C for 45 s, 72°C for 2 min and at the end, an additional extension 
at 72°C for 10 min was performed. The results were confirmed by gel 
electrophoresis (1.5% agarose for molecular biology (Sigma- 
Aldrich, 
Munich, Germany)) in Tris Acetate- 
EDTA buffer (Sigma- 
Aldrich). The 
gel was run at 120 V for 60 min and stained with GelRed (Biotium, 
USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR products were 
sent for sequencing at Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany) on 
an ABI 3130xl Genetic analyzer (Applied biosystems, Foster City, CA, 
USA) using ENV1 as sequencing primer. The sequenced genes were 
trimmed to between 590 and 788 bp depending on sequence quality 
and compared to type strain sequences at the Ribosomal Database 
project (RDP) by the Seqmatch software (May, 2016) (6).
2.6 | Statistical analysis
The colony count data was analyzed using SigmaPlot version 13.0 (SPSS 
Inc., Chicago, USA). The differences between all groups were evalu-
ated by Kruskal–Wallis one- 
way ANOVA on ranks, followed by all- 
pairwise- 
multiple- 
comparison Student- 
Newmns- 
Keuls Method. The 
differences between two experimental groups were assessed by a 
Mann–Whitney rank sum test. Results were considered statistically 
significant when p ≤ .05. Values are presented as median with 25th 
and 75th percentiles.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Microbial counts after washing
Total aerobic count of ready- 
to- 
eat mixed salad rinsing decreased 
significantly (p ≤ .01) from a median value of 7.2–6.7 log10 CFU/g 
after the first wash (Table 1) at the higher water flow of 8 L/min. 
The Enterobacteriaceae count was reduced (p ≤ .05) from 5.7 to 5.2 
log10 CFU/g after the first wash, but a greater level of significance 
(p ≤ .01) was achieved after the fifth wash, at 4.2 log10 CFU/g (Table 1).
The total aerobic count of romaine lettuce was also reduced 
significantly at 8 L/min (5.0 log10 CFU/g for unwashed lettuce, 4.1

log10 CFU/g after the first wash, and 3.6 log10 CFU/g after the fifth 
wash), but no significant reduction in Enterobacteriaceae count could 
be detected (Table 1).
In contrast, when washing at a lower water flow (2 L/min), neither 
the aerobic count nor the Enterobacteriaceae count was reduced sig-
nificantly on ready- 
to- 
eat mixed salad. Similarly, after immersion of 
the produce in water, no statistical differences could be seen (Table 1).
Unwashed, E. coli inoculated romaine lettuce harbored a median 
value of 5.0 (4.4–5.4) log10 CFU E. coli/g, after the first wash 4.2 
 
(4.1–5.1) log10 CFU/g and after the fifth wash 3.9 (3.5–4.6) log10 CFU/g 
(intermedian range 25–75% presented within parenthesis). This reduc-
tion was not statistically significant.
3.2 | Identification
The identities of the rRNA gene (16S) sequenced isolates from mixed 
salad are shown in Table 2. Bacteria from the Pseudomonaceae and 
Shewanellaceae families were isolated from TSA both before and after 
rinsing. Brevundimonas, Erwinia, Micrococcus, and Yersinia species 
were found after rinsing. On VRBD, Enterobacteriaceae species such 
as Pantoea and Serratia were found both before and after rinsing.
In the immersion experiment on mixed salad, bacteria from the 
Bacillaceae and Pseudomonadaceae families were found on TSA both 
before and after water bath washing. Rahnella and Curtobacterium 
were found on TSA only before washing. Enterobacteriaceae isolates 
were found on VRBD both before and after the water bath washing.
In the rinsing experiment of romaine lettuce, bacteria from the 
Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were found on TSA both before 
and after rinsing (Table 2). Members of the families Micrococcacea, 
Xanthomonadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae were found before rinsing, 
and Microbacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae were found after rinsing.
4 | DISCUSSION
In this study, two washing procedures feasible to perform under 
household conditions have been evaluated by their efficiency to 
 
remove bacteria from ready- 
to- 
eat mixed salad and from unwashed 
romaine lettuce.
Washing of mixed salad under a water tap at a flow rate of 8 L/min 
significantly reduced both total aerobic count and Enterobacteriaceae 
count, and this washing method also reduced the total aerobic count of 
romaine lettuce. Notably, the repeated washing steps under the water 
tap gave further significant reductions of both total aerobic count and 
Enterobacteriaceae count on both mixed salad and romaine lettuce. The 
non- 
significant reductions of Enterobacteriaceae on romaine lettuce 
were probably due to the high variation in starting values between the 
samples, and an overall low concentration of Enterobacteriaceae. The 
washing flow of 8 L/min is probably in the higher range for household 
washing. At this water flow, the structural appearance of the leaves 
in the mixed salad were somewhat negatively affected, however, the 
romaine lettuce appeared tougher and more resistant to the force of 
running water.

At the more gentle water flow of 2 L/min, there was no significant 
decrease in the bacterial load, and the same was true with the method 
of washing in water bath. Only the higher washing flow of 8 L/min 
yielded significant reductions in bacterial content, indicating that the 
detachment of microorganisms is dependent on the mechanical force 
that is applied. The attachment of microorganisms seems to be of a 
simple physical entrapment nature, and independent on whether the 
cells are alive or dead (Solomon & Matthews, 2005).
All samples were washed five times, with a duration of 20 s each 
time. All five washes were needed for the total aerobic count to de-
crease one log10 unit of the ready- 
to- 
eat mixed salad, while on the ro-
maine lettuce only one wash was needed to reach the same result. This 
might be due to the higher initial counts of the ready- 
to- 
eat salad, thus 
a log10 reduction is harder to achieve. Alternatively, bacteria colonizing 
the ready- 
to- 
eat salad were attached more firmly to the leaves than 
the bacteria on romaine salad. The bacterial community may vary due 
to morphological and chemical differences between lettuce genera 
and it is known that some microorganisms attach preferentially to cut 
edges, and are able to internalize the leaf tissue (Allende et al., 2008; 
Hunter, Hand, Pink, Whipps, & Bending, 2010; Jackson et al., 2013; 
Takeuchi & Frank, 2000). Pathogens that have internalized are known 
to be more resistant against sanitation agents and washing by physical 
means (Takeuchi & Frank, 2000). It is also worth noting that the initial 
values (before washing) of total count on romaine lettuce were 3 log10 
units lower than for the mixed salad (Table 1). The reason to that might 
be the damage caused to the mixed salad during processing, which 
increases the physical deterioration and enhances microbial growth 
(Allende et al., 2008; Rico, Martín- 
Diana, Barat, & Barry- 
Ryan, 2007).
Even though the bacterial content of both lettuce products was 
reduced by approximately one log10 unit by the highest water flow, 
the reduction still left the lettuce with high amounts of bacteria. This is 
probably due to the high initial values, especially from the mixed salad 
with an Enterobacteriaceae unwashed count of approximately log10 
5 CFU/g. However, the Enterobacteriaceae counts can be considered a 
bit too high due to what the sequencing results shows. Of the isolates 
from VRBD on mixed salad and romaine lettuce, many were not iden-
tified as Enterobacteriaceae (Table 2).
From the sequencing results (Table 2) it can also be seen that it is gram 
negative bacteria that dominate, mostly α- 
, γ- 
proteobacteria together 
with a few gram positive bacteria such as Bacillus and Actinobacteria, 
supporting current research (Hunter et al., 2010; Jackson et al., 2013; 
Lopez- 
Velasco, Carder, Welbaum, & Ponder, 2013). Shewanella putrefa­
ciens is not commonly found on green leaves, but associated with spoil-
age of fish (Gram & Huss, 1996). It was therefore somewhat surprising 
to find it in the mixed salad (Table 2). However, Shewanella has been 
identified from hydroponic lettuce cultivation systems (Rivera, Vélez, 
Zayas, & Llamas, 2015) and its presence may indicate a marine source 
of irrigation water or contaminated processing surfaces (Bagge, Hjelm, 
Johansen, Huber, & Gram, 2001). Shewanella is known to cause prob-
lems by adhering strongly to surfaces through biofilm formation (Bagge 
et al., 2001). In this study it was found both before and after washing. 
A single isolate was putatively identified as Bacillus anthracis, however, 
the genetic variations of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus anthracis, and Bacillus 
thuringensis exist mainly on episomes rather than on the chromosome 
genes (Ash & Collins, 1992; Rein Carlson, Caugant, & Kolsto, 1994). 
Therefore, it is impossible to distinguish between these species purely 
with 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
Within 
the 
International 
Commission 
on 
Microbiological 
Specifications for Foods and the European Commission, the safety 
guidelines that exist for fresh- 
cut lettuce are only specified for E. coli 
and Salmonella (European Commission, 2005; Health Protection Agency, 
2009). None of these taxa were found in the present study, but the num-
ber of sequenced isolates was limited, and the viable counts point at 
high concentrations of bacteria. The sequencing results reveal that a 
substantial part of the flora consists of Enterobacteriaceae; a family in-
cluding many members with pathogenic potential. A high dose of these 
types of bacteria might pose a risk for the consumer, especially to chil-
dren, elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Besides, there are 
those of the members that are notorious carries of antibiotic resistance.
To simulate a possible E. coli contamination, either during produc-
tion or processing, romaine lettuce was subjected to E. coli inocula-
tion. The lettuce was incubated in a water bath with added E. coli at 
5000 CFU/ml. After 24 hr at 4°C, the samples were immersed in po-
table water five times. The results showed that it was not possible to 
significantly lower the E. coli count by washing.
5 | CONCLUSIONS
This study shows that even though the salad mix is already washed 
and ready to eat, it contains high amounts of viable bacteria belong-
ing to the Enterobacteriaceae family, a family which includes several 
pathogenic taxa. Simulated household washing could at best reduce 
the total aerobic count and the Enterobactreriaceae count with 90%

and 97%, respectively, which due to high loads still left the leafy veg-
etables with high amounts of bacteria.
The results of this study show the inefficiency of tap water wash-
ing methods available in the home without chemical additions to re-
move bacteria from lettuce below safe limits. This situation stresses 
the responsibility of producers and distributors to ensure the hygienic 
quality of the green produce.
