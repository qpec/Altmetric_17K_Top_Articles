BACKGROUND
The use of bilateral internal thoracic (mammary) arteries for coronary-artery bypass 
grafting (CABG) may improve long-term outcomes as compared with the use of a 
single internal-thoracic-artery plus vein grafts.
METHODS
We randomly assigned patients scheduled for CABG to undergo single or bilateral 
internal-thoracic-artery grafting in 28 cardiac surgical centers in seven countries. 
The primary outcome was death from any cause at 10 years. The composite of death 
from any cause, myocardial infarction, or stroke was a secondary outcome. Interim 
analyses were prespecified at 5 years of follow-up.
RESULTS
A total of 3102 patients were enrolled; 1554 were randomly assigned to undergo 
single internal-thoracic-artery grafting (the single-graft group) and 1548 to undergo 
bilateral internal-thoracic-artery grafting (the bilateral-graft group). At 5 years of 
follow-up, the rate of death was 8.7% in the bilateral-graft group and 8.4% in the 
single-graft group (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.32; 
P 
= 
0.77), and the rate of the composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarc-
tion, or stroke was 12.2% and 12.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.79 
to 1.17; P 
= 
0.69). The rate of sternal wound complication was 3.5% in the bilateral-
graft group versus 1.9% in the single-graft group (P 
= 
0.005), and the rate of sternal 
reconstruction was 1.9% versus 0.6% (P 
= 
0.002).
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients undergoing CABG, there was no significant difference between 
those receiving single internal-thoracic-artery grafts and those receiving bilateral 
internal-thoracic-artery grafts with regard to mortality or the rates of cardiovascu-
lar events at 5 years of follow-up. There were more sternal wound complications 
with bilateral internal-thoracic-artery grafting than with single internal-thoracic-
artery grafting. Ten-year follow-up is ongoing. (Funded by the British Heart Foun-
dation and others; ART Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN46552265.)

C
oronary-artery bypass grafting 
(CABG) is one of the most commonly 
performed operations worldwide and has 
been established as an effective treatment for 
symptomatic multivessel coronary artery disease.1,2 
The standard surgical approach is anastomosis 
of the left internal thoracic (mammary) artery to 
the left anterior descending coronary artery and 
the use of saphenous-vein or radial-artery grafts 
to bypass other coronary arteries.3,4 The single 
internal-thoracic-artery graft has a 10-year rate 
of angiographic patency exceeding 90%, as com-
pared with 50% for vein grafts.5-10
The excellent long-term outcomes of single 
internal-thoracic-artery grafts11,12 have stimulat-
ed the use of a bilateral internal-thoracic-artery 
approach that uses both the left and right inter-
nal thoracic arteries.13-16 Pooled analyses of obser-
vational studies suggest that, at 10 years, there are 
approximately 20% fewer deaths from any cause 
with bilateral internal-thoracic-artery grafting than 
with single internal-thoracic-artery grafting.17-21 
However, bilateral internal-thoracic-artery grafting 
has not been widely adopted because of three 
main factors: it is a more complex procedure, it 
is associated with a higher risk of sternal wound 
complications, and there is a lack of randomized 
evidence of benefit.22-24
The Arterial Revascularization Trial (ART) 
was initiated in 2004 to address these concerns.25 
The primary objective of the trial was to com-
pare 10-year survival rates associated with bilat-
eral and single internal-thoracic-artery grafting, 
and secondary outcomes included clinical events, 
quality of life, and health economic measures. 
Safety information at 1 year has been published 
previously,26 and the current report is an interim 
analysis of clinical and safety outcomes at 5 years.
Methods
Trial Design
This two-group, multicenter, randomized trial was 
conducted in 28 cardiac surgical centers in seven 
countries. The protocol (available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org), baseline data, and 
1-year safety outcomes have been published pre-
viously.25,26 The trial complies with the Declara-
tion of Helsinki and commenced after ethics ap-
proval was obtained at all the participating centers. 
The trial was sponsored by the University of Ox-
ford, with funding from the British Heart Foun-
dation, the U.K. Medical Research Council, and 
the National Institute of Health Research Efficacy 
and Mechanism Evaluation Programme. The 
funders had no role in the design or conduct of 
the trial, in the analysis of the data, or in the 
writing of the manuscript or the decision to 
submit it for publication. There was no support 
from commercial entities for this trial.
Trial management was provided initially by 
the Clinical Trials and Evaluation Unit at the 
Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation 
Trust in London and from 2014 by the Surgical 
Intervention Trials Unit at the University of Ox-
ford. The authors were responsible for the design 
and analysis of the study and take full responsi-
bility for the integrity and completeness of the 
data and for the contents of the article, as well as 
for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol.
Enrollment and Randomization  
of the Patients
Eligible patients were those with multivessel coro-
nary artery disease who were scheduled to un-
dergo CABG (including patients requiring urgent 
surgery, but not those with evolving myocardial 
infarction). Patients requiring only single grafts 
or concomitant valve surgery, as well as those 
with a history of CABG, were excluded. Each 
patient was required to provide written informed 
consent.
Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 
to undergo single or bilateral internal-thoracic-
artery grafting. The randomization sequence was 
generated with randomly varying block sizes and 
stratified according to center. Patients were en-
rolled and underwent randomization by means 
of a telephone call to the coordinating center. To 
reduce the possibility of outcome events occur-
ring between randomization and revasculariza-
tion, it was recommended that surgery be per-
formed within 6 weeks after randomization.
Surgical Procedure
The group that underwent single internal-tho-
racic-artery grafting (the single-graft group) re-
ceived a single internal-thoracic-artery graft to 
the left anterior descending coronary artery plus 
supplemental vein or radial-artery grafts to other 
coronary arteries. The group that underwent bi-
lateral internal-thoracic-artery grafting (the bi-

Bilateral vs. Single Internal-Thoracic-Artery Grafts
lateral-graft group) received both left and right 
internal-thoracic-artery grafts to the two most 
important coronary arteries on the left side with 
supplemental vein or radial-artery grafts to other 
coronary arteries. In the bilateral-graft group, 
internal-thoracic-artery grafts could be used as 
composite grafts to each other, as long as one re-
mained in situ. Anastomosis of an internal-tho-
racic-artery graft to the right coronary artery was 
not permitted because of concerns about inferior 
long-term patency.
Surgeons could participate in the trial only if 
their experience included 50 or more operations 
using bilateral internal-thoracic-artery grafts, and 
surgeons were expected to be able to perform ei-
ther procedure. Standard methods for anesthesia 
and myocardial protection were used according to 
local practice.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome of the trial was death from 
any cause at 10 years of follow-up. Secondary out-
comes were the composite of death from any 
cause, myocardial infarction, or stroke (in a time-
to-event analysis), rate of repeat revascularization, 
safety outcomes (including bleeding and sternal 
wound complications), quality of life, costs, and 
cost effectiveness. Outcome definitions are pro-
vided in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
at NEJM.org. An analysis at 5 years of follow-up 
was prespecified by the steering committee and 
endorsed by the data and safety monitoring 
committee.25
Data were gathered at participating sites by 
means of annual telephone calls or hospital visits. 
Serious adverse events were reported by investiga-
tors on specific forms. Two members of the clini-
cal-event review committee (see the Supplemen-
tary Appendix for the membership list) adjudicated 
each event (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
and reintervention) in a blinded fashion to ensure 
that events met the prespecified protocol defini-
tions.25 If the two adjudicators did not concur, 
then the event was adjudicated by a third person 
to reach resolution. All other adverse events that 
required or prolonged hospitalization were adju-
dicated by one member of the committee. Qual-
ity of life was assessed with the use of the short-
ened World Health Organization (WHO) Rose 
angina questionnaire,27 the European Quality of 
Life–5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire,28 and 
the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form 
Health Survey (SF-36).29
Statistical Analysis
On the basis of a previous systematic review,17 we 
estimated that the use of bilateral internal-thoracic-
artery grafting would result in mortality at 10 years 
that was 5 percentage points lower than mortal-
ity with single internal-thoracic-artery grafting 
(20% vs. 25%). We calculated that 2928 patients 
would need to be enrolled in order for the trial to 
detect this expected difference with 90% power at 
the 5% significance level. The aim was to enroll 
at least 3000 patients (1500 patients in each group) 
over a recruitment period of 2 to 3 years.
This analysis censored data from patients at 
5 years of follow-up after the date of randomiza-
tion. The primary analysis used the intention-to-
treat principle. A sensitivity analysis was carried 
out with adjustment for age (<70 years vs. ≥70 
years), sex, ejection fraction (<50% vs. ≥50%), and 
diabetes (yes vs. no). The time-to-event analysis of 
survival was performed with the use of the log-
rank method and Cox proportional-hazards re-
gression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% con-
fidence intervals. All hazard ratios were estimated 
with the single internal-thoracic-artery group as 
the control group. For patients who died on their 
date of randomization or for whom their last 
known follow-up occurred on that day, their sur-
vival duration was assumed to be half a day, in 
order to allow them to be included in the analysis. 
A competing-risks analysis was used in the analy-
ses of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cause-
specific mortality.
Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed 
on the basis of baseline diagnosis of diabetes (yes 
vs. no), age (<70 years vs. ≥70 years), surgery type 
(on pump vs. off pump), radial-artery grafting 
(yes vs. no), number of grafts (<3 vs. ≥3), and 
ejection fraction (<50% vs. ≥50%). Exploratory 
analyses for the primary outcome included a per-
protocol analysis (which included patients who 
actually received their randomly assigned treat-
ment) and an as-treated analysis (in which patients 
were compared on the basis of the treatment they 
actually received). Health-related quality-of-life re-
sults are presented as percentages and means as 
appropriate; only patients with data are included 
in these analyses, without imputation for miss-
ing data, which is planned for only the final

(10-year) analysis. A P value of less than 0.05 was 
considered to indicate statistical significance, 
without correction for multiple testing. All the 
analyses were performed with the use of Stata 
software, version 14 (StataCorp).
Results
Patients
From June 2004 through December 2007, we en-
rolled 3102 patients at 28 cardiac surgery centers 
in seven countries. A total of 1554 patients were 
randomly assigned to the single-graft group and 
1548 to the bilateral-graft group. Figure 1 shows 
the flow of participants through the trial up to 
5 years of follow-up. The groups were well matched 
with respect to age, sex, race and ethnic origin, 
body-mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sure, smoking status, and coexisting conditions 
(Table 1).
Treatment
Data on surgical details and length of stay in the 
hospital26 are provided in Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix. In the single-graft group, 
96.1% of the patients received a single internal-
thoracic-artery graft, and in the bilateral-graft 
group, 83.6% of the patients received bilateral 
internal-thoracic-artery grafts. Off-pump proce-
dures without the use of cardiopulmonary by-
pass were performed in 40.6% of patients. The 
rate of nonadherence to bilateral internal-thorac-
ic-artery graft surgery was higher than expected. 
The mean number of grafts in each group was 
three. Medications at 5 years were well balanced 
between the two groups, with aspirin used in 
88.9% of the patients, beta-blockers in 76.2%, 
statins in 89.0%, and angiotensin-converting–
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor 
blockers in 73.4% (Table S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).

Outcomes
A total of 5.1% of the trial participants (159 par-
ticipants, including 84 in the bilateral-graft group 
and 75 in the single-graft group) had unknown 
vital status at 5 years because of loss to follow-up 
or withdrawal from the trial, although they do 
contribute to the analysis with a mean of 3.0 
years of follow-up (Fig. 1). At 5 years of follow-
up, there were 134 deaths (8.7%) in the bilateral-
graft group and 130 deaths (8.4%) in the single-
graft group (hazard ratio with the single-graft 
group as the control group throughout, 1.04; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.32; P 
= 
0.77) 
(Table 2 and Fig. 2A). Results were similar after 
adjustment for age, sex, diabetes status, and ejec-
tion fraction (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.81 to 
1.32; P 
= 
0.80).
For the composite of death from any cause, 
myocardial infarction, or stroke, there were 189 
(12.2%) in the bilateral-graft group and 198 
events (12.7%) in the single-graft group (hazard 
ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.17; P 
= 
0.69) (Ta-
ble 2 and Fig. 2B). Results of the individual 
components of this outcome are shown in Ta-
ble 2; there were no significant differences be-
tween the two groups. Approximately half the 
deaths were classified as being cardiovascular, 
with a hazard ratio that was similar to that in 
the analysis of all-cause mortality (Table S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
An adjusted analysis of all-cause mortality on 
a per-protocol basis showed a hazard ratio of 
1.01 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.31) in the bilateral-graft 
group as compared with the single-graft group; 
in the as-treated analysis, the hazard ratio was 
0.98 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.26) (Table S4 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). Subgroup analyses did 
not show any evidence of significant interactions 
(Fig. 3).
The incidence of sternal wound reconstruc-
tion was 1.9% in the bilateral-graft group, as 
compared with 0.6% in the single-graft group 
(relative risk, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.42 to 5.95; P 
= 
0.002) 
(Table 2), and all these events occurred in the 
first year after surgery. Sternal wound complica-
tions occurred in approximately twice as many 
patients in the bilateral-graft group as in the sin-
gle-graft group, whereas the rates of major bleed-
ing events and the need for any repeat revascu-
larization were similar in the two groups; the 
rate of repeat revascularization was just over 6% 
in each group (Table 2). Angina status at 5 years 
according to the WHO Rose angina question-
naire showed similar results in the two groups,

These rows for clinical outcomes refer to all the events of myocardial infarction or stroke up to 5 years and not just 
those that form part of the composite. Since death is a competing risk for myocardial infarction or stroke, the analysis 
takes account of this, and therefore the hazard ratio refers to a subhazard ratio for these two rows.

Bilateral vs. Single Internal-Thoracic-Artery Grafts
with approximately 70% of the patients who re-
sponded to the questionnaire reporting no chest 
pain. Mean quality-of-life scores as assessed by 
the EQ-5D and SF-36 at 5 years showed no be-
tween-group differences for patients who provided 
data (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
In the ART, we randomly assigned patients un-
dergoing CABG to single internal-thoracic-artery 
grafting or bilateral internal-thoracic-artery graft-
ing. In this 5-year analysis, there were no signifi-
cant differences between the two groups in all-
cause mortality and in the composite rate of 
death from any cause, myocardial infarction, or 
stroke, even though bilateral internal-thoracic-
artery grafting was associated with significantly 
higher rates of early sternal wound complications. 
Rates of major bleeding events and the need for 
repeat revascularization, angina status, and qual-
ity-of-life measures did not differ significantly 
between the two groups.
The surgical techniques that were used in this 
trial may influence the efficacy of CABG and sub-
sequent outcomes. A post hoc analysis of the trial 
data at 1 year suggested that more careful dissec-
tion of the internal thoracic artery (the “skeleton-
ized” technique) was associated with a lower risk 
of sternal wound complications regardless of 
whether single or bilateral internal-thoracic-artery 
grafts were used.30 Also, a post hoc nonrandom-
ized comparison from the trial showed similar 
rates of clinical events among patients receiving 
on-pump CABG and among those receiving off-
pump CABG, with slightly higher rates of repeat 
revascularization among patients who under-
went off-pump CABG.31 Patients who underwent 
bilateral internal-thoracic-artery grafting tended 
to have lower rates of sternal wound complications 
if they underwent off-pump CABG than if they 
underwent on-pump CABG.31 These observations 
are consistent with results of CORONARY (the 
CABG Off or On Pump Revascularization Study), 
in which 4572 patients were randomly assigned 
to undergo on-pump or off-pump CABG and 
which showed similar clinical outcomes at 1 year 
with numerically higher rates of repeat revascu-
larization in the off-pump group.32
Long-term outcome after CABG, in spite of 
the widespread use of single internal-thoracic-
artery grafting, is potentially limited by progres-
sive reduction in the patency of vein grafts, which 
are commonly used for target vessels other than 
the left anterior descending coronary artery.33 Bi-
lateral internal-thoracic-artery grafting may pro-
vide better long-term outcomes than single in-
ternal-thoracic-artery grafting plus vein grafts 
because of the superior long-term patency of 
arterial grafts, as compared with vein grafts.8,10 
At 5 years, observational and randomized stud-
ies indicate that patency rates of both left and 
right internal-thoracic-artery grafts and of radi-
al-artery grafts exceed 90%.13,34-37 Vein-graft pa-

tency may also be improving over time, which 
may be related in part to better control of risk 
factors after CABG.33 In the ART, the rates of use 
of aspirin, statins, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibi-
tors (or angiotensin-receptor blockers) at 5 years 
were high. There are also concerns that the sur-
vival benefits of bilateral internal-thoracic-artery 
grafting, which may be apparent only over the 
long term, may be more difficult to show in older 
patients because of their shorter overall life ex-
pectancy.38-40 Long-term follow-up is required in 
order to detect any clinical advantages from a 
second thoracic-artery graft.
Analysis of pooled observational data sug-
gests that mortality is approximately 20% lower 
with bilateral grafts than with single internal-
thoracic-artery grafts.17-21 In spite of statistical 
corrections and propensity matching, these stud-
ies may be prone to bias in terms of patient and 
operator selection.41 A post hoc analysis of the 
SYNTAX (Synergy between Percutaneous Coro-
nary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Sur-
gery) trial compared 5-year outcomes in 456 pa-
tients who received a second arterial conduit (74% 
of whom received bilateral internal-thoracic-ar-
tery grafting) with those in 963 patients who 
underwent single internal-thoracic-artery graft-
ing with additional vein grafts.42 After propen-
sity-score adjustment, the incidence of major ad-
verse clinical and cardiac events was 23.3% with 
bilateral grafts and 21.4% with single grafts 
(P 
= 
0.20), and the all-cause mortality was 9.1% 
and 9.5%, respectively (P 
= 
0.84). This subanaly-
sis of the SYNTAX trial shows mortality results 
similar to those in the ART at 5 years, which 
suggests a similar risk profile of the patients 
who were enrolled in these trials.
The absence of any midterm benefit from bilat-
eral over single internal-thoracic-artery grafting in 
our trial might have several explanations. First, 
the rate of vein-graft failure within 5 years may 
not be high enough to have an obvious adverse

Bilateral vs. Single Internal-Thoracic-Artery Grafts
clinical effect. Second, there may not be a direct 
association between vein-graft failure and clini-
cal events. Third, variation in surgeon experience 
may have reduced the effectiveness of bilateral 
grafting. In the ART, surgeons could adopt a 
variety of configurations for bilateral internal-
thoracic-artery grafting that could influence ef-
ficacy. In practice, several configurations, includ-
ing Y graft, free graft, and in situ configuration, 
are all associated with excellent patency rates.43-45 
Fourth, there may be little difference between 
the effects of the two techniques on clinical out-
comes, owing to better long-term vein-graft pa-
tency, asymptomatic vein-graft failure, and im-
proved medical therapy.
Several limitations of this trial should be 
considered. First, this planned interim analysis 
of an ongoing trial does not provide definitive 
long-term evidence regarding the comparison of 
CABG with the use of single versus bilateral in-
ternal-thoracic-artery grafting, which is still 
awaited. Second, at 5 years, the trial has less 
power to detect a difference in outcomes than is 
likely to be the case at 10 years, with consequent 
wide confidence intervals for the primary out-
come. Third, more patients who were randomly 
assigned to bilateral grafting than to single graft-
ing did not receive the assigned procedure (16.4% 
vs. 3.9%), and some expected loss to follow-up 
may reduce the power of the trial.46
In conclusion, in the ART, patients undergo-
ing CABG were randomly assigned to receive either 
single internal-thoracic-artery grafting or bilateral 
internal-thoracic-artery grafting. At 5 years of fol-
low-up, there were no significant differences in 
clinical outcomes between the two groups. There 
was some early excess of sternal wound complica-
tions in the bilateral-graft group. Ten-year fol-
low-up is ongoing.
