Pacific

Study on Men and Violence study team*
Summary
Background Although childhood trauma and violence against women are global public health issues, few population-
based data from low-income and middle-income countries exist about the links between them. We present data from 
the UN Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific, exploring the pathways between different 
forms of childhood trauma and violence against women.
Methods In this multicountry study, we interviewed multistage representative samples of men and women, aged 
18–49 years, in Asia and the Pacific, using standardised population-based household surveys. Men were interviewed 
in six countries, and women in four. Respondents were asked questions about their perpetration or experience of 
intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence, childhood trauma, and harsh parenting (smacking their 
children as a form of discipline). We used maximum likelihood multivariate logit models to explore associations 
between childhood trauma and violence against women, and fitted path models to explore associations between 
experience and perpetration of child maltreatment.
Findings Between Jan 1, 2011, and Dec 1, 2012, 10 178 men and 3106 women completed interviews in this study, with 
between 815 and 1812 men per site and 477 and 1103 women per site. The proportion of men who experienced any 
childhood trauma varied between 59% (n=478, 95% CI 54·0–63·3; Indonesia rural site) and 92% (n=791, 89·4–93·8; 
Bougainville, Papua New Guinea). For women, the results ranged from 44% (n=272, 37·7–50·8; Sri Lanka) to 84% 
(n=725, 80·7–86·8; Bougainville, Papua New Guinea). For men, all forms of childhood trauma were associated with 
all forms of intimate partner violence perpetration. For women, all forms of childhood trauma were associated with 
physical intimate partner violence, and both physical and sexual intimate partner violence. There were significant, 
often gendered, pathways between men’s and women’s perpetration and experiences of childhood trauma, physical 
intimate partner violence, harsh parenting, and other factors.
Interpretation The data point to both a co-occurrence and a cycle of abuse, with childhood trauma leading to violence 
against women and further child maltreatment, which in turn increases the risk of experience or perpetration of 
violence during adulthood. Efforts to prevent both forms of violence would benefit from a meaningful integrated 
approach. Interventions should promote positive parenting, address inequality and the normalisation of violence 
across the life course, and transform men’s power over women and children.
Funding Partners for Prevention. National studies were funded by the UN Population Fund in Bangladesh and 
China, UN Women in Cambodia and Indonesia, UN Develoment Programme in Papua New Guinea, and CARE in 
Sri Lanka.

Introduction
Child maltreatment and violence against women are 
global public health issues.1,2 In 2015, the Sustainable 
Development Goals established international develop­
ment targets for all member states of the UN. These 
targets include one on the elimination of all forms of 
violence against women and girls (target 5.2), and 
another on ending abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and all 
forms of violence against, and torture of, children 
(target 16.2). Governments and multilateral agencies 
need scientific evidence that can guide programmes and 
policies to achieve these ambitious targets.
In Asia and the Pacific, violence against women and 
child maltreatment are pervasive,3–5 although there are 
scant population­based statistics on child maltreatment 
across the region.6 Violence against children and violence 
against women have generally been addressed separately. 
More recently, researchers in the region have focused on 
violence against women as a consequence of child 
maltreatment, with evi 
dence showing that the association

is complex and varied.7 A narrative review of evidence on 
intersections between violence against children and 
violence against women, with an emphasis on low­
income and middle­income countries, identified a 
number of important intersections between these two 
types of violence. These include co­occurence within the 
same household, shared risk factors, and common and 
compounding consequences across the lifespan.8
Research about childhood trauma and its interface 
with violence against women is concentrated in high­
income countries.9 Child sexual abuse is the most 
researched and consistent predictor of adult sexual 
revictimisation10 and of risky sexual behaviours, which 
might act as mediating factors in women’s trajectories 
towards adult experiences of sexual violence.7 Child 
sexual abuse has also been associated with women’s 
experiences of intimate partner violence in high­
income11 and low­income and middle­income settings.12 
There is some evidence of the associations between 
physical child abuse and adult experiences of violence 
from studies with women in Latin America.13 Children 
who witness abuse between their parents are more 
likely to experience or perpetrate violence as adults,4,11–14 
although this is not consistent across settings.4,15 Men 
who experience childhood emotional abuse and 
neglect,16 and childhood sexual abuse,17 are also at 
increased risk perpetration of rape, intimate partner 
violence, and sexual assault.4,15
The pathways from childhood trauma to adulthood 
experiences and perpetration of violence are complex 
and multifaceted.18 There is some evidence that women 
who experience intimate partner violence are more 
likely to physically abuse their children than women 
who do not experience abuse.18 Furthermore, children 
who grow up witnessing abuse are at increased risk of 
being physically and sexually abused themselves.19 The 
evidence about the overlaps between experiences of 
witnessing violence, child maltreatment, and violence 
against women does not adequately capture or explain 
the relationship between these different types of 
violence.
In this Article, we present comparable population 
prevalence data from men and women who report 
different types of childhood trauma, including emotional 
abuse and neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and 
witnessing abuse of their mother, and their reports of 
using physical discipline against their own children. 
Using structural equation modelling, we show the 
pathways through which one’s childhood experiences of 
violence can lead to violence against women and child 
maltreatment during adulthood. The aim of this study 
was to move beyond simply looking at linear associations 
between violence against children and violence against 
women, and to disentangle the complex and intersecting 
pathways and risk factors that connect these experiences 
of violence.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and Google for references using the 
following search terms: “intimate partner violence”, “marital 
rape”, “sexual coercion”, “perpetration”, “etiology”, 
“aetiology”, “risk factors”, “child abuse”, “child sexual abuse”, 
“child maltreatment”, “harsh parenting”, “physical discipline”, 
and “intergenerational violence”. We sought published papers 
or reports with empirical research from 1990 onwards, from 
any country, published in English, and drew on previous 
systematic reviews. This literature review found that 
childhood trauma, intimate partner violence, low 
socioeconomic status, harsh or inconsistent parenting skills, 
attitudes condoning violence, and inequitable gender 
attitudes are key risk factors that link different forms of 
childhood trauma with violence against women. However, our 
literature review found few population-based statistics on 
child maltreatment in the Asia–Pacific region, and limited 
evidence on the pathways between child maltreatment and 
intimate partner violence.
Added value of this study
The results from this large multicountry study show that, to 
varying degrees, childhood trauma is highly prevalent among 
women and men in the general population, across the 
Asia–Pacific region. Our findings indicate that there are strong 
links between childhood experiences of maltreatment and the 
perpetration or experience of violence against women in 
adulthood, and that the cycle of violence is facilitated and 
fuelled by gender inequality. Importantly, the findings show 
the pathways through which experiences of childhood trauma 
contribute to violence against women and further child 
maltreatment. Additionally, they also stress the need for these 
two issues to be addressed.
Implications of all the available evidence
The 2015 Sustainable Development Goals include specific 
targets about the elimination of violence both against women 
and against children, and governments and multilateral 
agencies are eager for scientific evidence that can guide 
programmes and policies to achieve these ambitious targets. 
These findings are particularly pertinent because they provide 
a major advance in our understanding of violence against 
women and children, and have important implications for 
violence prevention strategies. The data from this 
population-based study suggest that gender inequitable social 
norms and attitudes, and the normalisation of violence, must 
be overcome to properly address the cycle of abuse in families. 
Interventions should promote positive parenting, address 
inequality and the normalisation of violence across the life 
course, and transform men’s power over women and children.

Methods
Study design and participants
This Article presents data from the UN Multi­country 
Study on Men and Violence, which was developed by 
Partners for Prevention, a UN Development Programme, 
UN Population Fund, UN Women, and UN Volunteers 
regional joint programme for the prevention of gender­
based violence in Asia and the Pacific. The study was 
done in nine diverse (rural and urban) sites across 
six countries in Asia and the Pacific region from 
2010 to 2013: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, 
Papua New Guinea, and Sri Lanka.
In all sites, we systematically selected households from 
census enumeration areas and randomly selected a 
representative sample of men aged 18–49. Further details 
on the sampling methodology have been published 
elsewhere.4 We established a minimum sample size of 
1000 for the required levels of statistical power to meet 
the primary study objectives; however, in some countries 
the research teams chose to use larger samples. In 
four sites (Cambodia, China, Papua New Guinea, and 
Sri Lanka), we also collected data from a representative 
sample 
of 
randomly 
selected 
women 
aged 
18–49 years, with a minimum sample size of 1000.
We followed ethics and safety guidelines for research 
about perpetration of violence by men and WHO 
guidelines for research about violence against women.19,20 
Ethics approval was provided by the Medical Research 
Council of South Africa; the College of Humanities, 
Beijing Forestry University, China; Medical and Health 
Research Ethics Committee, Ministry of National 
Education, 
Indonesia; 
International 
Centre 
for 
Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh; National 
Ethics Committee for Health Research of Cambodia; and 
the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Colombo, 
Sri Lanka. The South African Medical Research Council 
(SAMRC) Ethics Committee was used to obtain ethics 
approval in Papua New Guinea because the SAMRC was 
the principal investigation team in Papua New Guinea, 
where no other suitable ethics board existed at the time.
Procedures
We conducted standardised population­based household 
surveys, using multistage representative sampling. To 
protect women and men providing sensitive disclosure, 
we presented the study in communities as a family and 
health study. We informed participants of the purpose 
and nature of the study with a detailed information sheet 
and consent form, which they signed to indicate consent. 
No household lists with identifying details of respondents 
were kept. All interviews were conducted face­to­face in 
local languages by trained sex­matched interviewers 
using personal digital assistants to enter data. Questions 
for men about sexual violence perpetration were self­
administered using the audio­enhanced function of the 
personal digital assistants. In China the entire survey 
was self­administered to ensure privacy.
We collected data from men and women on their own 
experiences and perpetration of different types of intimate 
partner violence, their experiences of violence as children, 
and their use of physical punishment against their own 
children. The men’s questionnaire included eight sections 
and covered perpetration of violence against women, 
legislation about violence against women, knowledge of 
policies 
regarding 
violence 
against 
women, 
sociodemographic characteristics and employment, 
childhood experiences, gender attitudes, fatherhood, 
health and wellbeing, and sexuality. The women’s 
questionnaire contained 11 sections, which included 
questions on sociodemographic characteristics; childhood 
experiences; gender attitudes; physical, mental, and 
reproductive health; motherhood; experiences of violence; 
and related consequences and coping strategies.
Intimate partner violence was measured with a series 
of behaviour­specific questions related to a current or 
former intimate partner that were based on the WHO 
Multi­country Study on Women’s Health and Domestic 
Violence questionnaire for women, and a South African 
survey that was adapted for men (appendix).3,4 At the end 
of the series of questions about each type of violence, 
men were asked about their perpetration in the past 
12 months. The questions about sexual intimate partner 
violence focused on forced and coerced sex, were framed 
around specific acts, and asked about the frequency of 
perpetration (once, a few times, or many times).
We measured gender attitudes by asking study 
participants whether they strongly agreed, agreed, 
disagreed, or strongly disagreed with a number of 
gender­related statements (appendix p 2). We created a 
continuous summary score on the basis of respondents’ 
level of agreement with these statements. We also created 
tertiles to categorise respondents’ scores into groupings 
of low, medium, and high levels of gender equitable 
attitudes and beliefs (appendix pp 4–5). We used the 
continuous variable when fitting individual path models.
We used a modified version of the Childhood Trauma 
Questionnaire20 to measure the experiences of women 
and men, before age 18 years, of four dimensions of 
childhood trauma: childhood emotional abuse or neglect, 
physical abuse, sexual abuse, or witnessing abuse of 
mother (appendix p 1). Experience of child maltreatment 
included physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional 
abuse and neglect, whereas witnessing abuse of the 
mother was treated separately. Any childhood trauma was 
used to measure any experience of child maltreatment or 
witnessing abuse of mother. Chronbach’s α was 0·696 for 
male data and 0·743 for female data.
Finally, the survey asked respondents whether they 
ever punished their children (biological or otherwise 
younger than 18 years living with them) by smacking or 
beating them, or whether their partner punished the 
children by smacking or beating them. The possible 
response categories were never, sometimes, often, or 
very often (appendix p 6).

The measures of intimate partner violence and child 
maltreatment have been validated and used extensively in 
the Asia–Pacific region.2,7 In all sites the questionnaires 
were translated into local languages, translated back into 
English, and were pretested and cognitive tested to ensure 
the questions were understood as intended.
Data entry and statistical analysis
For each country, we present the population prevalence 
of childhood trauma by site, except when the sample was 
nationally 
representative. 
For 
the 
calculation 
of 
population prevalence, 95% CIs, and all other analyses, 
we took into account the complex survey design by using 
the Taylor’s linearisation method for survey estimates 
available in Stata 13.1.
When presenting the associations between childhood 
trauma and different forms of violence against women, 
we pooled the data from all countries, adjusted by age, 
marital status, education level, socioeconomic status 
(using a proxy measure of food insecurity and difficulty 
mobilising resources), and study site. We used Pearson’s 
χ² tests to analyse bivariate relationships between 
categorical variables. From information obtained from 
the bivariate analysis, we fitted maximum likelihood 
multinomial logit models for complex survey data to 
compare factors associated with mutually exclusive 
outcomes: physical violence only, sexual violence only, 
both physical and sexual violence, and multiple emotional 
or economic intimate partner violence only, in which 
never having committed any of these forms of intimate 
partner violence was the base condition. We recognise 
that children often experience multiple forms of 
maltreatment. However, analysis of the data with 
mutually exclusive outcomes enabled us to independently 
look at the associations between different forms of 
childhood trauma and experiences and perpetration of 
intimate partner violence, which previous studies have 
not been able to do.

Lifetime prevalence was used in all regression analyses 
to give more power to the analysis and to avoid suggesting 
that previously violent men are in some way the same as 
never violent men. Backwards elimination was used 
initially for variables of p=0·2 or greater, and for the fully 
adjusted parsimonious models generated for each 
country the final model variables were retained at p≤0·05.
We fitted individual path models of pathways to men’s 
and women’s use of harsh parenting practices using 
Stata 13.1. Sites included in the models include those 
where all relevant survey questions were asked. Alcohol 
abuse was defined as the respondent having alcohol abuse 
problems based on the AUDIT scale, which combines 
questions on frequency of drinking, number of drinks 
usually consumed, frequency of binge drinking (six or 
more drinks), and feelings of guilt or remorse after 
drinking and failure to do what was normally expected of 
oneself because of drinking. Lifetime sexual partners were 
defined as the number of different people the respondent 
had sex with in their lifetime, including their spouse or 
long­term partner, casual or one­off partners, or sex 
workers. The models were estimated with full information 
maximum likelihood estimation to allow for modelling of 
missing data, and they accounted for the clustering of 
participants in countries. We used backwards elimination 
to exclude endogenous variables that did not mediate any 
path (with significance set at p<0·05) from socioeconomic 
status to harsh parenting practices. Final models adjusted 
standard errors for clustering of participants in countries.

Results
The survey was done between Jan 1, 2011, and Dec 1, 
2012. We included 10 178 men (between 815 and 1812 per 
site) and 3106 women (between 477 and 1103 per site). 
The proportion of enumerated and eligible men and 
women  (aged 18–49) that were interviewed per site was 
mostly between 95% (men in Indonesia, rural site) and 
83% (men in China, urban/rural site). It was lower for 
men in urban Bangladesh (73%) and in Sri Lanka (74% 
for women and 59% for men). The sample characteristics 
have been described elsewhere.4 The appendix (pp 4–5) 
includes information about participants’ demographic 
characteristics, including marriage or cohabitation and 
co­residing children under age 18 years.
Table 1 shows the proportion of men and women in each 
site who disclosed experiencing different forms of 
childhood trauma when they were under the age of 
18 years. The proportion of men who experienced any 
form of childhood trauma varied from 59% (in the 
Indonesia 
rural 
site) 
to 
92%

experiencing both physical and sexual abuse ranged from 
2% in the Indonesia rural site to 25% in Bougainville, 
Papua New Guinea. Between 8% (Indonesia, rural site) 
and 56% (Bougainville, Papua New Guinea) of men had 
witnessed the abuse of their mother as a child.
The proportion of women who experienced any form of 
childhood trauma varied between 44% (in Sri Lanka) to 
84% (in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea; table 1). The 
proportion who experienced physical abuse without sexual 
abuse ranged from 19% (Sri Lanka) to 48% (Cambodia), 
and between 2% (Cambodia) and 5% (China, urban/rural 
site) experienced sexual abuse only. From 2% (China, 
urban/rural site, and Sri Lanka) to 9% (Bougainville, 
Papua New Guinea) of women experienced both physical 
and sexual abuse as children. In sites where both men 
and women were interviewed (Cambodia, China, 
Papua New Guinea, and Sri Lanka), reported experiences 
of child sexual abuse were generally higher for men than 
for women (however, in China, the 95% CIs overlap).
About three­quarters of all women reported that either 
they or their partner smacked their children at least 
sometimes (table 2). Men reported slightly lower 
proportions than women overall, but in five sites, 
approximately half or more of the men surveyed reported 
that they, their partner, or both parents used physical 
discipline against their children. Harsh parenting was 
most common in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, for 
men and women, and least common in urban and rural 
sites in Indonesia for men and in the China site for 
women. In Cambodia, men were more likely than 
women to report that either they, their partner, or both 
smacked their children. However, in all other sites where 
both men and women were interviewed, the 95% CIs for 
any harsh parenting overlapped. More detail on reported 
smacking of children is provided in the appendix (p 6).
Multinomial regression analysis of associations between 
men’s childhood experiences of violence and perpetration 
of different forms of intimate partner violence showed that

perpetration were significant independently, the relative 
risk ratios (RRs) varied according to the type of trauma 
experienced. Relative RRs were lowest for men who have 
witnessed abuse of their mother, higher for those who had 
experienced emotional abuse or neglect only, again higher 
for those who had experienced physical abuse, even higher 
for sexual abuse, and highest for those who had 
experienced both physical and sexual abuse.
All forms of childhood trauma were significantly 
associated with women’s experiences of physical 
intimate partner violence and experiences of both 
physical and sexual intimate partner violence (table 4). 
Witnessing abuse of the mother was not significantly 
associated with women’s experiences of sexual only 
intimate partner violence, or frequent emotional or 
financial intimate partner violence.
The appendix provides the prevalence data for the 
different categories of intimate partner violence 
perpetration and victimisation used in the analysis for 
tables 3 and 4. The appendix also presents the prevalence 
of different types of childhood trauma by social and 
demographic characteristics for men and women 
respectively.
Figure 1 presents a structural equation model based on 
the combined data from men across the seven sites 
where all questions were asked. Men in Bangladesh were 
not asked whether their wife or partner ever smacks or 
beats their children and for this reason they were 
excluded from the model. The figure illustrates the 
statistically significant associations between men’s 
experiences of child maltreatment, witnessing abuse of 
their mother, their perpetration of physical intimate 
partner violence, their use of harsh parenting practices, 
and other related factors. The appendix (p 9) presents the 
unstandardised and standardised estimates of path 
coefficients, and the variances of the disturbances and 
equation­level goodness­of­fit for the men’s path model.
Figure 2 presents a structural equation model based 
on the combined data from women across the four sites 
where women were interviewed. The figure illustrates 
the significant pathways and associations between 
women’s experiences of child maltreatment, witnessing 
abuse of their mother, their experiences of physical 
intimate partner violence, their use of harsh parenting 
practices, and other related factors. The appendix (p 10) 
shows the unstandardised and standardised estimates 
of path coefficients, and the variances of the 
disturbances and equation­level goodness of fit for the 
women’s path model.
Disturbances (errors associated with the endogenous 
variables) were included in the models. They are not 
shown in the diagram for clarity. They are implicitly 
shown in the appendix (pp 9–10) as r² results and 
disturbances are (as in regression) 1–r².
Before adjusting standard errors for clustering of 
participants in countries, model fit was very good for 
both the men’s model (p(χ²)=0·001, root mean square 
error of approximation (RMSEA)=0·016, comparative 
fit index (CFI)=0·997, TLI=0·988) and the women’s 
model 
(p(χ²)=0·001, 
RMSEA=0·038, 
CFI=0·986, 
TLI=0·958). After adjusting for clustering, the 
coefficient of determination was 0·125 for men and 
0·151 for women.
Men’s harsh parenting practices are most strongly 
associated with their female partner’s use of harsh 
parenting against their children, which itself is associated 
with his perpetration of physical intimate partner 
violence (figure 1). Men’s harsh parenting practices are 
also associated with low socioeconomic status and 
experience of child maltreatment.
Low socioeconomic status is associated with men’s 
experiences of child maltreatment, witnessing their 
mother being abused, harsh parenting practices, and his 
female partner beating their children. There was no 
direct association between low socioeconomic status and 
men’s perpetration of physical intimate partner violence. 
Rather, men’s perpetration of physical intimate partner 
violence was associated with witnessing his mother 
being abused, alcohol abuse, a higher number of sexual 
partners than the reference group, and experiences of 
child maltreatment. The pathways between men’s own 
experiences of childhood trauma (witnessing abuse and

experiencing maltreatment) and perpetration of physical 
intimate partner violence were mediated by alcohol 
abuse and a higher number of lifetime sexual partners.
Women’s harsh parenting was most strongly driven by 
their male partner beating their own children, which 
mediated the association between her partner’s violence 
towards her and her own harsh parenting practices 
(figure 2). In turn, women’s risk of experiencing physical 
intimate partner violence was associated with their 
experiences of child maltreatment and witnessing their 
mother being abused (and correlated with inequitable 
gender 
attitudes). 
Furthermore, 
harsh 
parenting 
practices were influenced by women’s inequitable gender 
attitudes, which were associated with witnessing 
mother’s abuse and low socioeconomic status.
Low socioeconomic status was associated with women’s 
experiences of child maltreatment, witnessing their 
mother being abused, and having more inequitable 
gender attitudes. All of the pathways between low 
socioeconomic status and harsh parenting practices were 
mediated by women’s own experiences of trauma and 
abuse throughout their life­course. Although there was a 
direct path between witnessing abuse of their mother 
and harsh parenting practices, the strongest pathways 
were through women’s experiences of child maltreatment 
and experience of physical intimate partner violence.
Discussion
Experiences of childhood trauma were extremely 
prevalent in the Asia–Pacific region, although rates 
varied substantially by site and type of abuse. Generally, 
emotional abuse and neglect were the most common 
forms of abuse, followed by physical and then sexual 
abuse. This pattern was broadly consistent with other 
Asia–Pacific 
regional 
studies 
of 
child 
abuse.21 
Respondents also reported high rates of witnessing 
abuse of their mother as a child.
In particular, men’s experiences of child abuse were 
high across the region, with higher rates of childhood 
sexual abuse for men than for women reported in almost 
all sites. This finding contrasts with the published 
medical literature from high­income countries, although 
studies in Zanzibar, China, and Malaysia have also found 
higher rates of sexual victimisation among boys,22–25 and 
studies in Taiwan, Vietnam, and Thailand have shown no 
significant gender difference.20,26,27 It is possible that 
women were reluctant to report their experiences of 
abuse because of fear or shame brought upon themselves 
and their families.22,23 However, it has been suggested 
that experiences of sexual violence are equally, if not 
more, shameful for boys,28 and that boys are less likely 
than girls to report their experiences of sexual abuse.24 
Some studies also indicate that the types and patterns of 
abuse for boys and girls are different.22 In other studies, 
boys reported higher rates of forced exposure to 
pornography and forced witnessing of sexual activity 
than girls, which could reflect different social norms 
around male and female sexual socialisation.29 On the 
basis of the Asia–Pacific cultural context, it is also 
possible that girls are more strictly supervised and 
protected from sexual abuse than boys, which allows 
boys more freedom and movement.22 Further research, 
particularly qualitative research, is needed to explore 
girls’ and boys’ experiences of childhood sexual abuse 
across the region.
This study shows that childhood trauma and violence 
against women intersect in a number of important ways. 
Men’s experiences of childhood trauma were associated 
with their perpetration of all measured forms of intimate 
partner violence. Women who have experienced any type 
of childhood trauma are at increased risk of experiencing 
violence by men in adulthood. Experiences of emotional 
abuse and neglect in childhood are important risk 
factors, independent of sexual or physical abuse, for 
men’s perpetration of sexual and physical intimate 
partner violence, as well as women’s victimisation. 
Further, emotional child abuse on its own was found to 
be associated with both perpetration and experiences of 
violence later in life.
This is consistent with other studies on childhood 
exposure to neglect and negative developmental 
environments,30 and suggests that the environment in 
which a child grows up is very important for prevention 
of violence. However, although emotional abuse is 
important, the study also showed that men who faced 
physical or sexual violence as children, and men who 
faced multiple types of child maltreatment, were even 
more likely to perpetrate violence later in life than men 
who experienced only emotional abuse or neglect. The 
study further showed that men’s witnessing abuse of 
their mother was both directly and indirectly associated 
with physical intimate partner violence, and verified the 
existing consensus on the mediating effect of alcohol 
abuse. Previous studies have shown that men who have 
been exposed to violence in childhood are more likely to 
abuse alcohol than those unexposed to violence, and that 
alcohol misuse is an individual risk factor for violence 
perpetration.31
Harsh parenting is common in the Asia–Pacific region, 
but a high proportion of parents also claim to raise their 
children without use of physical punishment.6 The line 
between punishment and child maltreatment has long 
been contested, and many argue that smacking a child as 
a form of discipline does not constitute physical child 
abuse or harsh parenting. The Parenting Across Cultures 
(PAC) study explored the variance of normativeness and 
likelihood of using corporal punishment (which included 
spanking, slapping, grabbing, shaking, and beating up) 
at the intercultural and intracultural levels.32 The PAC 
study found that corporal punishment is independently 
associated with increased outcomes of children’s 
aggression and anxiety symptoms, and also presents as a 
risk factor for more severe corporal punishment and for 
physical child abuse.32,33 Other longitudinal studies have 
 Articles

e520
shown that parents with inconsistent and harsh 
parenting styles are at increased risk of abusing their 
children, and that their children are at increased risk of 
behavioural and cognitive developmental problems.30,34 
Harsh physical punishment, independent of child 
maltreatment, has also been associated with several adult 
physical health conditions including cardiovascular 
disease, arthritis, and obesity.35 The results from the PAC 
study support these findings. Thus, harsh parenting 
practices, not just severe forms of child maltreatment, 
need to be addressed as a strategy for preventing violence 
against children.
In all sites (except men’s reports in Indonesian urban 
sites), respondents more commonly reported that mothers 
smacked their children as a form of discipline, compared 
with just fathers smacking their children. This finding 
might reflect that mothers take primary responsibility for 
child rearing, and that discipline is considered to be a part 
of that. However, the structural equation models further 
show that harsh parenting practices reflect a culture in the 
home that normalises physical discipline of both children 
and women. That is, harsh parenting practices for both 
men and women are most strongly associated with 
whether the male partner uses physical discipline against 
the children, which is in turn directly related to male 
intimate partner violence against women in the home, 
which can also be seen as disciplining women.
The structural equation models also show that societal 
acceptance and normalisation of the use of violence 
against children is initially established within the family. 
Men’s and women’s own use of physical discipline with 
their children is partly driven by their own experiences of 
child maltreatment and witnessing their mother being 
abused, which suggests an element of social learning 
from childhood. However, social learning is compounded 
by other factors, such as experiences of physical intimate 
partner violence. The model also shows that women’s 
use of harsh discipline against their children is not as 
much of a product of her psychological reaction to 
trauma exposure as previously thought (depression was 
not found to be a significant variable in the model), since 
it is a form of normative behaviour established within 
the family, which encompasses violence between parents 
and acceptance of the use of violence in child rearing. 
Additionally, the range of childhood trauma prevalence 
across the sites suggests that other social factors—such 
as culturally variant perceptions about child discipline, 
and norms of parental responsibility and wife abuse—
also determine the outcomes of intimate partner 
violence. In the case of post­conflict Sri Lanka, with 
relatively low prevalence of child maltreatment, it 
becomes apparent that these other social factors are 
influential in affecting rates of intimate partner violence 
prevalence and experience.36
We found that the role of gender inequality is important 
in understanding the interconnections and pathways 
between these different forms of violence in the home. 
The association between a man’s experiences of child 
maltreatment and perpetrating physical intimate partner 
violence is mediated by his number of sexual partners, 
which suggests that one effect of child maltreatment on 
men might be to contribute to more sexually risky 
behaviour and models of masculinity that emphasise 
heterosexual dominance. This theory is consistent with 
other studies that found an association between gender 
norms and male sexuality in Latin America.37 For women, 
inequitable gender attitudes mediate a pathway between 
low socioeconomic status and harsh parenting, as well as 
between experience of child maltreatment, witnessing 
mother abuse, and harsh parenting practices. This 
finding suggests that there are parallels in the existence 
of power inequalities between men and women, and 
parents and children, and violence is used as a means of 
asserting dominance in both cases.
The study has some limitations. Most samples were 
not nationally representative and so the findings only 
reflect the sampled sites. Only some countries, and a few 
sites within most of these countries, were included—
therefore the analysis of the combined sample does not 
represent the whole Asia–Pacific region. Although all 
countries met the minimum sample requirements, 
sample design and household selection varied across 
sites. However, these differences are unlikely to affect the 
findings because all methods resulted in representative 
samples with no particular biases related to outcomes. 
There might have been non­response bias, but response 
rates were high. Violence perpetration, particularly 
sexual violence, might have been under­reported because 
it is perceived as a private, antisocial behaviour, although 
most women’s reports appear to validate the findings 
from men. Bangladesh was the first country in which the 
study was implemented, after which the questions on 
sexual intimate partner violence were expanded to 
include coerced sex. As a result, there is some disparity 
between the sexual violence questions in Bangladesh and 
the other sites, which could affect reported prevalence in 
that site. The cross­sectional nature of the survey means 
that causation of violence perpetration cannot be 
determined; however, the analysis of associated factors 
still provides a strong evidence base to inform prevention 
interventions. Additionally, although the advantages 
from the mutually exclusive categories of child 
maltreatment outweigh the disadvantages, as discussed 
in the Methods, we acknowledge that in reality these 
types of abuse are not experienced in a mutually exclusive 
way for many children. There is always unmeasured 
confounding that could affect the models; however, we 
measured all of the key candidates for confounding (ie, 
 
age, marital status, education level, and socioeconomic 
status) and therefore expect this to be minimal. Finally, 
we recognise that the measure of harsh parenting 
practices is limited because it only includes smacking or 
beating when other forms of emotional abuse could 
constitute harsh parenting. However, because the

original survey was focused on intimate partner violence, 
the number of questions on perpetration of child 
maltreatment were limited. Nevertheless, the data show 
that harsh parenting is a relatively common pattern of 
behaviour in the region and is associated with other 
outcomes of interest.
Overall, violence against women and violence against 
children intersect in a number of important ways, and 
can no longer be understood as totally separate issues. 
These survey data have implications for prevention 
practice to end both forms of violence, which would 
benefit from a meaningful integrated approach. In 
particular, the data point to both a co­occurrence and a 
cycle of abuse, with violence during childhood leading to 
both experiences and perpetration of violence against 
women 
and 
further 
child 
maltreatment 
during 
adulthood. A comprehensive approach to address the 
home environment and violence­supportive culture as a 
whole, and to work with families to promote positive 
parenting practices, is needed. Particularly, there is a 
need for interventions that focus on addressing gender 
inequality, the normalisation of violence across the life 
course, and transforming men’s power over women 
and children.
Further research is needed to expand how violence 
against women and violence against children intersect 
in adolescence. Further, we need to expand our 
understanding of patterns of susceptibility. For 
example, what promotes resilience among children 
who have experienced abuse, but do not go on to 
perpetrate or experience violence during adulthood? 
Regarding child sexual abuse, more information is 
needed about risk factors and their variance by age 
group and by gender. Although there is a substantial 
database on risk factors for violence against women, 
the understanding of causality, pathways, and interplay 
between risk factors needs to be improved, especially 
since they relate to mediating pathways between child 
maltreatment and violence against women. There is a 
further need for more coordination between researchers 
working on violence against women and violence 
against children, and for longitudinal research to 
understand the timing of all risk factors and to establish 
causality.
