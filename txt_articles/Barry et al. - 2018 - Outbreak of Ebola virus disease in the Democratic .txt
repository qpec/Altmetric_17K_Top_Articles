Background: On 8 May 2018, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reported an 
13 
outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Equateur Province in the northwest of the country. The remoteness of 
14 
most affected communities and the involvement of an urban centre connected to the capital city and 
15 
neighbouring countries makes this outbreak the most complex and high risk ever experienced by the DRC.   
16 
 
17 
Methods:  Epidemiological investigations of cases were conducted to obtain demographic characteristics, 
18 
determine possible exposures, collect information about signs and symptoms, and identify contacts to be 
19 
followed up for 21 days. Cases were classified as suspected, probable or confirmed case using the national EVD 
20 
case definitions. The reproduction number and projected number of cases for the four week period 25 May to 
21 
21 June were estimated.  
22 
 
23 
Results: Update as of 30 May, 50 cases (37 confirmed, 13 probable) of Zaire ebolavirus, were reported across 
24 
Bikoro (42% of cases), Iboko (50% of cases) and Wangata (8% of cases) health zones. Wangata is part of 
25 
Mbandaka, the urban capital of Equateur Province connected to major national and international transport 
26 
routes. By 30 May, 25 deaths had been reported, giving a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 56% (95% CI: 39% - 72%) 
27 
after adjustment for censoring. This CFR is consistent (p=0.427) with estimates for the 2013-15 West African 
28 
epidemic. The median age of cases was 40 years (range: 8-80 years) and 30 (60%) were male. The most common 
29 
reported signs and symptoms included fever (95%), fatigue (90%) and loss of appetite (90%). Gastrointestinal 
30 
symptoms were common and 32% cases reported haemorrhagic signs. Time from illness onset or hospitalisation 
31 
to specimen testing decreased over time.  On 30 May, 734 contacts had been identified, of which 69% had been 
32 
followed up. The estimated reproduction number is 1.03 (95%CI 0.83–1.37) and the cumulative case incidence 
33 
 for the outbreak by 21 June is projected to be 78 cases (95% CI: 37 to 281). The initial source of the outbreak is 
34 
still under investigation.    
35 
 
36 
Conclusions:  
37 
The current Ebola virus outbreak has similar epidemiological features to previous Ebola outbreaks.  Rapid case 
38 
isolation, contact tracing and the ongoing vaccination programme is expected to stop the outbreak.  The 
39 
forecast of the number of cases does not exceed the current capacity to respond, if the epidemiological 
40 
situation does not change.

 Introduction 
43 
On 3 May 2018, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) received a notification 
44 
from the Health Division of Equateur Province of 21 cases of fever with haemorrhagic signs, including 17 
45 
community deaths, from the Ikoko Impenge Health Area, Bikoro Health Zone, which is approximately 125 km 
46 
south of the provincial capital of Mbandaka. An investigation team, composed of members of the Ministry of 
47 
Health, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and the World Health Organization (WHO), travelled to Bikoro Health 
48 
Zone from 5 to 6 May 2018. Blood samples were collected from five hospitalised cases and transported to the 
49 
National Institute of Biological Research (INRB) in Kinshasa for laboratory testing on 6 May 2018. Of these, two 
50 
were positive for Zaire ebolavirus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In line with the 
51 
International Health Regulation (IHR) requirements, the Ministry of Health notified WHO of the confirmed cases 
52 
and declared the outbreak on 8 May 2018. Further investigation found cases in neighbouring Wangata and 
53 
Iboko health zones.  
54 
 
55 
Ebola virus is a filovirus with five sub-species (Zaire, Bundibugyo, Sudan, Reston and Taï Forest). It causes Ebola 
56 
virus disease (EVD) which has a case fatality ratio (CFR) of between 25% and 90%1. The Zaire strain is the most 
57 
fatal with an overall CFR ranging from 69% to 88%2. EVD is transmitted primarily through contact with the body 
58 
fluids of symptomatic patients, most commonly to adults of 17-44 years, with relative sparing of children under 
59 
the age of 16 years3,4,5,6. Transmission can be stopped by early diagnosis, patient isolation and care, infection 
60 
control, safe and dignified burial of the remains of cases, rigorous tracing of contacts and more recently, 
61 
targeted vaccination.  
62 
 
63 
DRC has recorded eight previous EVD outbreaks since 1976 (Figure 1)7,8. The last outbreak occurred in May 2017 
64 
in a remote area in the north-east of the country, Likati Health Zone in the Bas-Uele Province, causing a total of 
65 
eight cases with four deaths.  Most of the previous outbreaks have been confined to remote rural areas with the 
66 
exception an outbreak in Kikwit, a town with a population of just under 400,000 that resulted in 315 cases and 
67 
250 deaths9.  The response to this outbreak includes use of traditional measures such as early identification, 
68 
isolation and care of cases, contact tracing, safe and dignified burials, culturally appropriate community 
69 
mobilisation. These traditional measures are being supplemented by use of the recombinant vesicular stomatitis 
70 
virus–Zaire Ebola virus (rVSV-ZEBOV) vaccine, with vaccination of first and second line contacts. This paper is the 
71 
first in a series on the latest outbreak in DRC. It provides an early overview of the descriptive epidemiology using 
72 
best data available from field teams working to response to the epidemic.  
 
73 
 Methods  
74 
Case investigation: Cases were classified as suspected, probable or confirmed according to the EVD case 
75 
definitions of the Ministry of Health (Table 1 below)10. Confirmation of cases required detection of Ebola RNA in 
76 
blood or body fluids by RT-PCR. Information on all cases was recorded using the Ministry of Health case 
77 
investigation form and entered into an electronic database. Case investigations were conducted to record 
78 
demographic characteristics, determine possible exposures, document information on illness onset and signs 
79 
and symptoms, and to identify potentially exposed contacts. For cases who had recovered or died before 5 May 
80 
2018, retrospective case classification was through review of medical records at health facilities in the affected 
81 
locations.  For cases alive or newly ill since declaration of the outbreak, information was collected prospectively 
82 
at the time of case investigation. Our analysis included probable and confirmed cases as of 30 May 2018. 
83 
 
84 
Contact tracing: Contacts were identified during the case investigation process for each case. Contact tracers are 
85 
required to visit all contacts once a day (in Mbandaka city, contacts are visited twice daily)  for 21 days following 
86 
the last date of contact with an infectious suspected, probable or confirmed case. Information on their health 
87 
status and the development of any EVD like symptoms  is collected11.   
88 
 
89 
Data analysis: Data analyses were performed using R (version 4.3). Missing/unknown data were excluded. 
90 
Confidence intervals were calculated assuming symptom occurrence was binomially distributed. Spatial 
91 
locations of cases were analysed in ArcGIS (ESRI, version 10.5) using area boundaries developed by a range of 
92 
partners, including WHO, in consultation with the Ministry of Health. Cases were plotted to village, health area 
93 
and overall health zone in Bikoro, Iboko and Wangata, respectively. Boundaries are subject to confirmation. 
94 
 
95 
Case fatality ratio: The observed deaths by 30 May were used to obtain a naïve CFR estimate, which was then 
96 
adjusted by the proportion of deaths among the cases in the database that would have been expected by 30 
97 
May 2018, based on their dates of illness onset and the illness-onset-to-death delay distribution estimated using 
98 
the data from the West African Ebola epidemic5. In addition, the age-dependent CFR12  and illness-onset-to-
99 
death distributions5 from the West African Epidemic were used to predict the numbers of deaths expected 
100 
among the cases in the current outbreak by 30 May, based solely on the ages of cases and dates of illness onset. 
101 
This predicted number of deaths was compared with the observed number of deaths by 30 May by calculating 
102 
the two-sided p-value, 2×Poisson( X ≤ x | λ ) where x is the observed number of deaths by 30 May and λ is the 
103 
predicted number of deaths by 30 May. 
104 
 
105 
Time from Illness onset to first hospitalisation and sample testing were calculated for cases with available data 
106 
and with dates of onset after 30 April, in line with the “trusted period” defined with the reproduction number 
107 
estimates. A simple linear regression was fitted against dates of case illness onset or hospitalisation to assess 
108 
trends over time.  
109 
  
110 
Reproduction number estimates: Due to the delay between illness onset and notification, the most recent cases 
111 
are likely not yet reported. Based on the confirmed cases only, we defined a “trusted period” where we 
112 
estimated that the recorded incidence of confirmed cases with dates of illness onset between 30 April and 24 
113 
May (inclusive) were at least 95% complete (potentially relative to an unknown but constant level of overall 
114 
under-reporting). The analyses of the reproduction number (R) and onward projections were therefore based 
115 
only on the confirmed cases with illness onset during this period (Annex 2). The analysis used an approach 
116 
similar to those previously described12,13 , using a Poisson process or renewal equation to approximate the daily 
117 
incidence and assumed: i) a serial interval distribution inferred for the West African Ebola Epidemic6 (Annex 1: 
118 
Figure A3); and ii) constant transmissibility throughout the trusted period. 
119 
 
120 
Forward Projections: Using the estimates of the reproduction number obtained above, we projected incidence 
121 
for the 4-week period, 25 May to 21 June, following the end of the trusted period (Annex 1). Those forward 
122 
projections assumed that transmissibility and reporting rates remained the same as during the trusted period. 
123 
Two transmission assumptions were explored: i) homogeneous transmission among cases (no super-spreading) 
124 
approximated using a Poisson process and ii) heterogeneous transmission among cases (with super-spreading) 
125 
using a negative binomial distribution which incorporates additional variability in the number of secondary cases. 
126 
This level of heterogeneity was assumed to be similar to that seen during the West African Ebola epidemic6. 
127 
 
128 
95% Credible Intervals: The reproduction number estimates and the forward projections were estimated in a 
129 
Bayesian framework using an MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov Chain) approach. Therefore, the uncertainty is 
130 
reported here as 95% credible intervals (95% CI), obtained by taking the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the 
131 
posterior distribution.

 Results  
135 
As of 30 May 2018, a total of 50 EVD cases (37 confirmed, 13 probable), including 25 deaths (unadjusted CFR of 
136 
50% [95% CI: 36% - 64%] by 30 May), have been identified in Equateur Province, with illness onsets of the cases 
137 
between 5 April and 28 May (Figure 2). After adjustment for censoring, the CFR is 56% (95% CI: 39% - 72%), 
138 
ignoring uncertainty in the illness-onset-to-death distribution. Based on the recorded ages of cases in the 
139 
current outbreak, their recorded dates of illness onset, and epidemiological parameters estimated from the 
140 
West African Ebola epidemic9, we would have expected 29.9 deaths by 30 May 2018, with a total of 33.0 deaths 
141 
eventually expected among these 50 cases.  Thus, the fatalities seen in the current outbreak by 30 May are, 
142 
after adjustment for censoring, consistent with CFR estimates seen in the West African Ebola epidemic (p-value 
143 
= 0.427)9. The median age of cases was 40 years (range: 8–80 years) and 30 (60%) were male (Figure 3). Cases 
144 
were reported in northern areas of Iboko (n=25; 23 confirmed, two probable), southern areas of Bikoro (n=21; 
145 
10 confirmed, 11 probable) and Wangata (n=4; all confirmed) health zones (Figure 4).  
146 
 
147 
Of 50 confirmed and probable cases, 45 had at least one reported symptom. The most frequently reported 
148 
symptoms were: fever (n=40/42), loss of appetite (n=37/ 41) and intense general fatigue (n=37/ 41), followed by 
149 
diarrhoea (n=23/32), abdominal pain (n=22/ 35) and nausea/vomiting (n=22/35) (Figure 5). Haemorrhagic signs 
150 
were observed in 14 of 43 cases. The symptom profile of confirmed and probable cases was statistically similar. 
151 
The overall median time from illness onset to first hospitalisation was 1 day (range: 0–10 days) with  no evidence 
152 
of a reduction over time (, p=0.54) (Figure 6). However, marked reductions in the time from illness onset to 
153 
specimen sampling (data not shown) and illness onset to sample testing were apparent (p<0.0001, overall 
154 
median 6 days, range 1–13 days). Similarly, time from first hospitalization to sample testing improved over time 
155 
(p=0.0004, overall median 11 days, range 0–13 days). 
156 
 
157 
Five health care workers, two of whom died, were among the cases.  Other commonly affected occupational 
158 
groups included farmers (n=14), students (n=5), household workers (n=5) and religious leaders (n=4). The most 
159 
common exposure risks were having contact with another sick person (29 of 41 cases) and participation in a 
160 
funeral (24 of 40 cases) (Table 2). 
161 
As of 30 May, 1458 epidemiological contacts had been identified of which 746 remained under active follow-up. 
162 
Of the 504 first and second line contacts eligible for vaccination, 496 had been vaccinated by teams of trained 
163 
vaccinators.   
164 
 
165 
The estimated reproduction number in the period 30 April to 24 May was 1.03 (95% confidence interval (CI): 
166 
0.83 to 1.37), an estimate that was robust to assumptions about the serial interval distribution and the trusted 
167 
period.  The projected cumulative number of confirmed cases on 21 June 2018 is on average 76 (95% CI: 54 - 109) 
168 
assuming a homogeneous transmissibility (Poisson) model, and 78 (95% CI: 37 to 281) assuming a 
169 
 heterogeneous transmissibility (negative binomial) model. The resulting projected incidence patterns are shown 
170 
in Figure 7.  
 
171 
 Discussion:   
172 
Our analysis shows that the epidemiological features of the current outbreak in DRC such as demographic 
173 
characteristics and signs and symptoms of cases are consistent with previous outbreaks of EVD14,15,16.  Contact 
174 
with other cases and participation in a funeral are the most commonly reported exposures among cases, similar 
175 
to previous EVD outbreaks, reinforcing the importance of community engagement and implementation of safe 
176 
and dignified burials for outbreak control.  The CFR is similar to that seen in previous outbreaks in DRC and 
177 
elsewhere, but higher than was seen towards the end of the 2014-2016 West Africa outbreak, where there was 
178 
greater access to Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs)13,17.  With the rapid installation of ETUs in the affected areas, the 
179 
CFR is expected to decrease18,19,20 The reduction in the time from illness onset to isolation and testing is 
180 
encouraging because prompt isolation and testing minimizes exposure and transmission of Ebola virus to other 
181 
people.  It is concerning that five of 50 cases are health care workers, again highlighting the risk for clinical staff 
182 
and the importance of providing sufficient training and equipment for health care workers to protect themselves.  
183 
Moreover, that nearly half of the cases reported hospitalization or contact with a hospitalized patient prior to 
184 
their Ebola infection is a clear reminder that health care facilities with inadequate infection control procedures 
185 
can amplify Ebola outbreaks 5,21,22,23,24.  
186 
The EVD outbreak in DRC currently remains geographically limited to three health zones in Equateur Province. 
187 
Two of the affected communities are in remote areas, which whilst reducing the risk of widespread expansion of 
188 
the outbreak, creates serious logistical barriers for a rapid response including the follow up of contacts each day. 
189 
The response teams have had to overcome major infrastructure challenges in multiple sites across a wide 
190 
geographic area, such as the lack of electricity for essential laboratory and clinical equipment, absence of 
191 
communications networks for transmitting data, very limited road access for contact tracers to travel on, and 
192 
absence of accommodation for responders. The complexity of the context also makes it extremely difficult to 
193 
collate and analyse epidemiological and response data for analysis and operational planning.  In addition to 
194 
these challenges, the spread of transmission to the provincial capital, Mbandaka, an urban area of nearly one 
195 
million people, raises concerns about an urban Ebola outbreak.  Even more concerning is that Mbandaka is a 
196 
port city on the Congo River and is a major transportation hub – to the capital Kinshasa with nearly 10 million 
197 
inhabitants, and also to neighbouring countries such as the Republic of the Congo and the Central African 
198 
Republic.  The proximity of this outbreak to major national and international transportation routes underpins 
199 
WHO`s assessment that the public health risk from this outbreak is very high for DRC and high for other 
200 
neighbouring countries.  The risk internationally remains low 25.   
201 
At present the source of the outbreak is unknown. Investigations are ongoing, but one hypothesis is that this 
202 
outbreak is linked to a cluster reported in February 2018 of 15 persons who had a febrile illness that occurred in 
203 
Ingende and Bikoro health zones of Equateur Province. Of those 15 cases, 11 had haemorrhagic signs, of whom 
204 
eight died. According to the investigation report, the first case died on 20 December 2017. The aetiology of that 
205 
 cluster has not been confirmed. While a link between the two clusters cannot be ruled out, the long period of 
206 
time between these two events without identified chains of transmission calls into question whether they were 
207 
causally linked. However, there are epidemiological links between the ongoing clusters in the different locations, 
208 
which underscores the potential for geographic spread, even in remote areas. Ongoing field investigations are 
209 
being conducted to describe the chains of transmission that link the identified cases and information on 
210 
transmission chains will be published online as it becomes available. In addition, further information on contact 
211 
tracing and the proportion of cases emerging from contact lists will also be made available.  
212 
Statistical forward projections suggest that if interventions remain as effective as they were between 30 April 
213 
and 24 May, possibly twice as many cases may occur by 21 June.  Even under this pessimistic scenario, the 
214 
current isolation capacity available in the affected communities would be sufficient. Nonetheless, considering 
215 
that a period of 42 days after the last cases is required before the outbreak can be considered over, the ongoing 
216 
occurrence of cases would mean that the response will need to continue for at least the next three months or 
217 
more.   Furthermore, is not possible to rule out further expansion of the outbreak if there is exportation of cases 
218 
to new areas or if there are ongoing but hitherto unrecognized chains of transmission. It is also possible that a 
219 
new chain of transmission may occur following sexual transmission of the virus from a male survivor, if 
220 
appropriate services and counselling are not provided, again requiring an even longer response.   
221 
As for all outbreak investigations, some data are collected retrospectively and some data are incomplete.  Data 
222 
on signs and symptoms for some patients were collected retrospectively from medical records, which may have 
223 
resulted in errors or missing data.  An analysis of a subset of patients with prospectively collected data results in 
224 
a similar frequency of signs and symptoms. Detailed information about chains of transmission is being compiled 
225 
by field investigation teams and are not available currently. The dynamic nature of outbreaks and response 
226 
means that some numbers are revised as additional information becomes available. 
227 
A major sustained response is therefore needed to ensure ongoing case identification, contact tracing, isolation, 
228 
and other control measures. Implementation of WHO`s Early Warning Alert and Response System, (EWARS), a 
229 
data collection system that uses handheld devices, represents a major improvement for data collection 
230 
compared with the 2014-2016 West Africa outbreak.  However, this information system is not optimally 
231 
designed for contact tracing.  Collecting, managing, and analysing epidemiological data in real-time continues to 
232 
be a significant challenge in the field. Nonetheless, the analysis presented in this paper shows that real-time 
233 
data collection and epidemiological analysis for the control of complex Ebola outbreaks is achievable.  
234 
The epidemiology of the current Ebola virus outbreak in DRC has similar features to previous Ebola outbreaks, 
235 
which indicates that early detection of the outbreak combined with tried-and-tested interventions including  
236 
early isolation and treatment, contact tracing, safe burials and community engagement currently being 
237 
implemented, along with the additional benefit of targeted vaccination, should be sufficient to control this 
238 
 outbreak.  However the combination of remote communities and spread to an urban centre that is connected to 
239 
the capital city and neighbouring countries, makes this outbreak the most complex and high risk ever 
240 
experienced by the DRC.

Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) 
292 
The line list dataset received 1 June 2018 includes three variables relevant to the case fatality ratio (CFR): i) 
293 
status at time information was collected; status as time of notification; and; final status.  For status at time of 
294 
collection, there were 29 “Alive” and 21 “Dead”; for status at time of notification, there were 23 “Alive”, 25 
295 
“Dead” and 2 “NA”; and for final status, there were 6 “Alive”, 13 “Dead” and 31 “NA”.  Of the 18 possible 
296 
combinations of these levels, there were 6 combinations observed (as presented in Table A1).  
297

On the basis of these variables, we conclude that there were 25 deaths and 25 people alive up to 30 May 2018 
301 
(the most recent date variable recorded in the variables: date of illness onset, date of hospitalisation, date of 
302 
notification, and date of death). 
303 
We calculated the expected individual-level probability of having observed death by 30 May 2018, among those 
304 
that would eventually die over the course of their illness based on the estimated gamma distribution fitted to 
305 
the onset-to-death observations among confirmed and probable cases in the West African Ebola epidemic 
306 
(shape = 1.651 and rate = 0.202 giving a mean and standard deviation of 8.17 days and 6.36 days, respectively.5 
307 
The average probability was 0.900.  Thus, we take the observed CFR by 30 May 2018 and its exact 95% binomial 
308 
confidence interval: 50% (95% CI: 36% - 64%) and obtain the adjusted CFR by dividing each of these numbers by 
309 
0.900 to obtain an estimate of CFR adjusted for censoring of 56% (95% CI: 39% - 72%), ignoring uncertainty in 
310 
the illness-onset-to-death distribution. 
311 
We estimated individual-level CFRs based on age (which was recorded in years for 49 of the 50 cases) using the 
312 
equation: 
313 
������������������������������������(������������������������������������) =
exp(− 0.0350 −  0.0820 age. child +  0.0288 age. adult) 
1 +  exp(− 0.0350 −  0.0820 age. child +  0.0288 age. adult)  
314 
where age.child = min(age – 15, 0) and age.adult = max(age – 15, 0) 
315 
 where the parametric form and parameter estimates were estimated from data on confirmed and probable 
316 
cases during the 2014-16 West African epidemic12 (Figure A1). Note that the average individual-level CFR (66.1%) 
317 
observed in the database was assumed for the single case without recorded age.  The mean of these individual 
318 
CFRs did not vary substantially between those that were recorded as having died (67.7%) and those still alive 
319 
(64.5%).   
320 
The expected individual-level probability of death by 30 May 2018 is the product of the estimated individual-
321 
level CFR and the estimated individual-level probability of having observed death by 30 May 2018, among those 
322 
that would eventually die over the course of their illness. The mean of these individual probabilities of having 
323 
observed death by 30 May 2018 varied substantially between those that died (65.9%) and those still alive 
324 
(53.7%). Summing these probabilities over all 50 cases in the case database, we find that we would have 
325 
expected 29.9 deaths by 30 May 2018 out of a total of 33.0 deaths expected among these 50 confirmed and 
326 
probable cases over the course of their illness. Thus, the fatality data observed from the current outbreak are 
327 
consistent with what are predicted based on the West African Ebola epidemic (p-value = 0.427).

332 
with 95% confidence interval by age group, by country and overall. 
333 
Key Delays 
334 
We investigated the delays between the dates of illness onset and death and notification, respectively, and 
335 
fitted gamma distributions to the observed delays using maximum likelihood. One case had a negative onset to 
336 
notification delay recorded and was removed from the analysis. The summary statistics of the observed delays 
337 
are shown alongside the equivalent estimates from the fitted gamma distributions and the distributions’ 
338 
parameters with 95% confidence intervals. The observed and fitted values match very well for both fitted 
339 
distributions.

342 
Defining the trusted period 
343 
Although the earliest case illness onset was 5 April, the first case notification for a confirmed case was not until 5 
344 
May. As a result, the cases with the earliest illness onset have the longest illness-onset-to-notification delays. 
345 
We must remain cautious until this delay distribution has stabilized. However, the short illness-onset-to-
346 
notification delays observed for the most recent illness onset cases suggests that we could generally expect 
347 
short delays for cases with illness onset dates in the recent past and into the near future. We base all following 
348 
analyses in this section on the confirmed cases only. 
349 
The linear relationship between illness-onset-to-notification delay and date of illness onset among confirmed 
350 
cases is shown in Figure A2. A linear regression model fitted to data with dates of illness onset from 30 April 
351 
onwards showed that date of illness onset explained 33% of the variation in the illness onset-to-notification 
352 
delay. 
353 
 
354 
Figure A2: A) Dates of notification and illness onset. B) Delay from illness onset to notification against 
355 
date of illness onset 
356 
 
357 
The regression model fitted to these data implies that for cases with illness onset on day ������������������������, the mean delay to 
358 
notification is given by ������������������������−������������ = ������������������������������������ + ������������, where ������������ = −0.23 and ������������ = 4149.57 (given in days since 1 January 
359 
1970) are the slope and intercept of the linear model fitted above, respectively. Hence the expected date of 
360 
notification ������������������������ for a case with illness onset on day ������������������������ is ������������������������ + ������������������������−������������, with the actual values being normally 
361 
distributed around this mean, with a standard deviation defined by the residual standard error of the regression, 
362 
������������������������=2.42. The simple regression fitted to the confirmed cases appears a good description of the data, implying 
363 
that the variance of this normal distribution is independent of the illness onset date. This means that we would 
364 
 expect ������������% of cases with illness onset on ������������������������ to have been reported by day ������������������������,������������ = ������������������������ + ������������������������−������������(������������������������) + ������������������������, where ������������������������  
365 
is the inverse cumulative distribution of the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation ������������������������=2.42. 
366 
Substituting ������������������������−������������, we can resolve this to give the critical illness onset date as 
367 
������������������������(������������) = ������������������������ − ������������������������ − ������������
������������ + 1
 . 
368 
 
369 
This estimated linear relationship allows us to estimate what proportion of the cases which experienced illness 
370 
onset on a particular date (from 30 April onwards) have already been included in the dataset. On this basis we 
371 
estimate that 90% of cases with illness onset on 25 May will have been included and 95% of those with illness 
372 
onset on 24 May will have been included. Note: The latest date of any sort included in the analysed dataset was 
373 
30 May. Thus, having estimated that the recorded incidence of cases with dates of illness onset between 30 
374 
April and 24 May (inclusive) were at least 95% complete (potentially relative to an unknown but constant level 
375 
of overall under-reporting), we consider this interval to be our ‘trusted period’ from the point of view of 
376 
estimating incidence trends, and thereby predicting future incidence, for confirmed cases (Figure 1 main text). 
377 
Estimating the Reproduction Number R 
378 
We use an approach similar to those previously described13,6 to quantify transmissibility from the incidence time 
379 
series during the trusted period of the current epidemic, assuming a certain distribution for the serial interval 
380 
(the time between illness onset in a case and illness onset in their infector). Here, we assumed the serial interval 
381 
distribution inferred for the West African Ebola epidemic,6, namely a gamma distributed serial interval with 
382 
mean 15.3 days and standard deviation 9.1 days.  
383 
The distribution of the serial interval used in our analyses is shown in Figure A3.  
384 
 
385 
Figure A3: Distribution of the serial interval (the time between illness onset in a case and illness onset in their infector), 
386 
assuming a gamma distributed serial interval with mean 15.3 days and standard deviation 9.1 days, as estimated during 
387 
the West African Ebola epidemic6.  
388 
 We assumed that transmissibility was constant throughout the trusted period, and estimated the reproduction 
389 
number, R, defined as the average number of secondary cases infected by an infected individual. The estimate 
390 
of R is informative as if R is above the threshold value 1, and remains above 1, the outbreak is likely to grow 
391 
further, whereas if R is below 1, and remains below 1, the outbreak will die out. 
392 
Given uncertainty surrounding the epidemiological situation before the trusted period, we only used incidence 
393 
data during the trusted period, and reconstructed the incidence before the trusted period whilst estimating R11. 
394 
Our method assumes that the daily incidence can be approximated by a Poisson process using the so-called 
395 
renewal equation: 
396 
 
397 
������������������������~������������������������������������������������������������������������������������(������������������������ ∑
������������������������−������������������������������������
������������
������������=1
) 
(1) 
398 
where It is the incidence on day t, Rt is the reproduction number on day t, and w is the probability mass function 
399 
of the serial interval.  
400 
Sensitivity analyses 
401 
Sensitivity analyses were performed  
402 
- 
using an alternative distribution of the serial interval, with mean 16.1 days and standard deviation 4.4 
403 
days as estimated during a previous Ebola outbreak in DRC26. 
404 
- 
Changing the end of the trusted period, bringing it forward or backward by one day. 
405 
- 
Changing the start of the trusted period, to keep only a week-long trusted period.

Forward Projections 
410 
We used the renewal equation (equation 1) to project the incidence forward, given a back-calculated early 
411 
incidence curve, an estimated reproduction number, and the observed incidence over the trusted period. We 
412 
sampled 200 sets of back-calculated early incidence curves and reproduction numbers from the posterior 
413 
distribution obtained in the estimation process. For each of these sets, we simulated 2000 stochastic realisations 
414 
 of the renewal equation starting from the end of the trusted period; leading to a total of 400,000 projected 
415 
incidence trajectories.  
416 
Projections were made on a 4-week horizon (25 May to 21 June). The projections assume that the 
417 
transmissibility remains constant over this 4-week horizon. If transmissibility were to decrease as a result of 
418 
additional control interventions and/or changes in behaviour over this time period, we would predict a lower 
419 
number of cases; similarly, if transmissibility were to increase over this time period, we would predict a higher 
420 
number of cases. We limited our projection to 4 weeks only as assuming constant transmissibility over longer 
421 
time horizons seemed unrealistic.  
422 
Super-spreading has been shown to be an important characteristics of Ebola transmission27. To account for this 
423 
characteristic, we considered an alternative projection method, assuming that secondary cases are generated 
424 
according to a negative binomial distribution:  
425 
������������������������~NegBin������������������������� � ������������������������−������������������������������������, ������������
������������
������������=1
� 
426 
The value of the overdispersion parameter, z, was taken from analyses of exposure patterns during the West 
427 
African Ebola epidemic27.
