 Recent studies suggest the hypothesis that a shared neural ensemble may link distinct memories 
encoded close in time1–13. According to the memory allocation hypothesis1,2, learning triggers a 
temporary increase in neuronal excitability14–16 that biases the representation of a subsequent 
memory to the neuronal ensemble encoding the first memory, such that recall of one memory 
increases the likelihood of recalling the other memory. Accordingly, we report that the overlap 
between the hippocampal CA1 ensembles activated by two distinct contexts acquired within a day 
is higher than when they are separated by a week. Multiple convergent findings indicate that this 
overlap of neuronal ensembles links two contextual memories. First, fear paired with one context 
is transferred to a neutral context when the two are acquired within a day but not across a week. 
Second, the first memory strengthens the second memory within a day but not across a week. 
Older mice, known to have lower CA1 excitability16,17, do not show the overlap between 
ensembles, the transfer of fear between contexts, or the strengthening of the second memory. 
Finally, in aged animals, increasing cellular excitability and activating a common ensemble of 
CA1 neurons during two distinct context exposures rescued the deficit in linking memories. Taken 
together, these findings demonstrate that contextual memories encoded close in time are linked by 
directing storage into overlapping ensembles. Alteration of these processes by aging could affect 
the temporal structure of memories, thus impairing efficient recall of related information.
Contextual memories are encoded in discrete and sparse populations of neurons in the 
hippocampus18–22. Recent findings demonstrated that increasing the relative neuronal 
excitability of a subset of neurons increases the probability that those neurons will 
participate in a memory trace6,8–11. While previous studies used viral vectors to manipulate 
excitability, temporary increases in excitability occur naturally following learning, including 
in the hippocampus14,15,23. Therefore, two distinct memories could be linked across time 
because the temporary increase in excitability would bias the storage of a subsequent 
memory to many of the same neurons that encoded the first memory, such that recall of one 
of these events would also likely lead to recall of the other, a key prediction of the memory 
allocation hypothesis1,2.
To investigate the neuronal ensembles encoding multiple memories, we constructed an open-
source, head-mounted, miniature fluorescent microscope7,24, to image in vivo calcium 
transients in CA1 neurons using GCaMP6f. With this approach we tracked the activation of 
the same neurons in mice as they freely explored 3 distinct novel contexts across multiple 
days (Fig. 1a–c, Extended Data Fig. 1–2). We recorded CA1 neurons activated by 3 different 
contexts separated by either 5 hours (5h) or 7 days (7d). Previous studies show transient 
learning-dependent increases in neuronal excitability14,15,25 and we confirmed that 5h after 
context exposure there was an increase in excitability in CA1 neurons that encoded the 
context (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). Therefore, we predicted that the overlap between the 
neural representations of two contexts separated by 5h would be higher than the overlap of 
the neural representations of two contexts separated by 7d.
We exposed mice to three distinct, novel contexts. A and C were separated by 7d; B and C 
were separated by 5h. Using miniature microscopes, we imaged active CA1 neurons during 
each context exploration (Fig. 1d). We found more overlap between the neural ensembles 
encoding B & C, spaced 5h apart, than between the neural ensembles encoding A & C,

 spaced 7d apart (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Importantly, this difference was not due 
to differences in the total number of active CA1 cells in the three contexts (Fig. 1e). We 
confirmed these findings with the TetTag transgenic system, a non-invasive technique that 
allowed us to tag neurons active during the exploration of two contexts26,27 (Fig. 2a,b, 
Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). We used this transgenic approach to tag the neural ensemble 
activated by exploration of an initial novel context (GFP+) and compared this population to 
the ensemble activated by exploration of a second distinct, novel context (using ZIF 
immunohistochemistry), either 5h or 7d later (Fig. 2c–e). When the two contexts were 
separated by 7d, the overlap between the two ensembles was similar to what was expected 
by chance (Fig. 2f), indicating that independent populations of neurons encoded the two 
distinct contexts. However, when the two contexts were separated by 5h, overlap between 
neuronal ensembles was significantly above chance levels and higher than in the 7d group 
(Fig. 2f). Together, the calcium imaging and TetTag data provide converging evidence that 
overlapping neural ensembles encode distinct contexts when these contexts are separated by 
5h, but not by 7d.
To determine whether the overlap of neuronal representations link contextual memories that 
occurred close in time, such that the recall of one is more likely to lead to the recall of the 
other, we again exposed animals to three distinct contexts as described above: A and C were 
separated by 7d, and B and C were separated by 5h. Two days later, mice were placed in C 
and given an immediate footshock (Fig. 3a). Since the neural representations of B & C 
overlap more than A & C (Extended Data Fig. 5), recall of C (shocked context) should lead 
to recall of B (but not A). Therefore, the fear associated with C should transfer to B (but not 
to A). Remarkably, we found that mice tested in B, a context in which they had not been 
shocked, froze as much as mice tested in C (shocked context; Fig. 3b). In contrast, mice 
tested in A froze significantly less than mice tested in the other two contexts. These results 
support the hypothesis that the overlap between neuronal representations contextually links 
memories close in time.
Next, we tested whether the memories for B and C remain distinct, rather than forming a 
unitary memory. If so, extinction of the fear associated with B should not affect recall in C. 
Again, we exposed animals to B and 5h later to C, and then paired C with a footshock. Two 
days later, the mice were tested in either C (shocked context), B (5h; not shocked), or D 
(novel context; Fig. 3c). Consistent with the prior experiment, mice froze similarly in C and 
B, despite never having been shocked in B. However, they froze less in a novel context (D; 
Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 6b), demonstrating memory specificity. Next, we carried out 
repeated exposures in either context C, B, or D daily for 5 days. On the final day, the mice 
were tested in C (shocked context). As expected, repeated exposures in C (compared to 
repeated exposures in novel context D) resulted in lower freezing during the extinction test 
(Fig. 3e). Mice that were repeatedly exposed to B did not show less freezing in C, 
demonstrating that repeated exposures in B do not cause extinction in C. These results 
demonstrate that although the memories for B and C show considerable overlap in their 
ensembles, and recall of B appears to trigger recall of C, memories for these two contexts, 
acquired 5h apart, remain distinct.

 Recent findings demonstrated that manipulations that enhance neuronal excitability can lead 
to increases in memory strength11. We found that 5h after exposure to a context, there was 
an increase in excitability in cells that encoded that context (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). Thus, 
the sharing of the neural ensemble and the increase in excitability should result in the 
strengthening of the memory for a second context 5h later. To test for modulation of memory 
strength, mice were exposed to B and then exposed to C 5h or 7d later. Two days later, 
animals received an immediate shock in C. Two days after that, they were tested in C. Home 
cage controls were trained in the same manner, except they were not exposed to B (Fig. 3f). 
Mice trained with the 5h interval had enhanced memory for C compared to either mice 
trained with the 7d interval or home cage controls (Fig. 3g; Extended Data Fig. 6c,d,7). 
Furthermore, this enhancement required NMDA-receptor activity (Extended Data Fig. 8). 
These data support our previous findings and indicate that for a period of time (5h, but not 
7d), the processes triggered by the encoding of one memory can modulate the strength of 
subsequent memories.
Taken together, the results presented above demonstrate that the overlap between the 
neuronal ensembles representing two separate contextual memories leads to linking of these 
memories and suggests that excitability has a key role in this process. Since CA1 neuronal 
excitability decreases with aging16,17,23,28, we predicted that memory linking processes may 
be disrupted in older mice. To test this, we started by repeating the calcium imaging (Fig. 
4a) as well as the TetTag experiment (Extended Data Fig. 9e,f) in aged mice. Unlike in 
young adult mice (3–6 month old), in aged mice (14–18 month old) there was no difference 
between the overlap of neural ensembles encoding contexts spaced 5h or 7d apart (Fig. 4b). 
This lack of overlap was not due to an inability to reliably reactivate the same neural 
ensemble during recall of the same context (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b) or to general 
contextual memory deficits (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d).
The results presented above predict that the lack of a shared neural representation in aged 
mice should disrupt memory linking. To test this hypothesis, we repeated in aged mice the 
experiment testing the transfer of fear between contexts (Fig. 4c). The results showed that 
the fear associated with C does not transfer to B in aged mice: the freezing triggered by B 
(no shock context) was not different than that observed in a novel context, D, and 
significantly lower than that in C (shocked context; Fig. 4d). Similarly, we found that, unlike 
in young mice, in aged mice exposure to B (5h before exposure to C) does not enhance 
memory for C (Fig. 4e,f). Importantly, this was not due to a deficit in learning of a single 
context, since when trained with a single context the performance of aged mice was 
indistinguishable from that of young mice (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d). Furthermore, the 
differences between young and aged mice were also not due to strain differences, as we 
replicated the transfer and enhancement experiments with young mice from the same genetic 
background as the aged mice (Extended Data Fig. 6). Altogether, these results strongly 
support the role of neuronal excitability in linking distinct contextual memories encoded 
close in time, as aged mice exposed to two contexts close in time did not show the increased 
overlap between ensembles which presumably led to the lack of both the transfer of fear 
between contexts and the strengthening of the second memory.

 To increase neuronal excitability and rescue the memory-linking deficit in aged mice, we 
injected a lentivirus to express hM3Dq Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by 
Designer Drugs (DREADD) tagged with GFP in a sparse population of dorsal CA1 neurons 
(Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) increases excitability and activates 
cells that express the DREADD receptors11 (Extended Data Fig. 10c,d). To bias the 
allocation of the two contextual memories so that they shared an overlapping neural 
ensemble, we injected CNO prior to both learning experiences, spaced 5h apart (Fig. 4g). 
The control group was given a saline (SAL) injection prior to the first exploration and a 
CNO injection prior to the second exploration. To test the behavioral consequences of 
sharing a neural ensemble, mice were brought back two days later for an immediate shock in 
the second context. Two days later, mice were tested in the first (non-shocked) context to 
assess their transfer of fear. The CNO group froze more than the SAL group in the non-
shocked context (Fig. 4h). This was not due to increased anxiety caused by CNO (Extended 
Data Fig. 10e,f). Thus, increasing neuronal excitability in aged mice rescued the memory-
linking deficit.
Mechanisms that link memories are critically important for organizing the enormous number 
of related memories stored throughout a lifetime. Our results support the memory allocation 
hypothesis1,2 and are consistent with human data and computational modeling29, suggesting 
that memories encoded within close temporal proximity are more likely to be co-recalled 
than memories encoded across more distant time frames. Our data indicate that overlapping 
populations of CA1 neurons serve to link and strengthen memories, thus facilitating 
integrated recall of experiences encoded close in time while separating those encoded further 
in time. Temporary increases in excitability14–16 likely represent one of a family of 
mechanisms (synaptic tagging and capture2,30 is another example) that structure the 
acquisition and storage of information to facilitate future use and recall. Alteration of these 
processes, such as decreases in neuronal excitability during aging, could affect the 
organization of memory thus impairing efficient recall of related information.
Methods
Subjects
All experimental protocols were approved by the Chancellor’s Animal Research Committee 
of the University of California, Los Angeles, in accordance with NIH guidelines. Adult 
C57Bl/6NTac, C57Bl/6NTac×129S6/SvEvTac and C57Bl/6NIA male mice were singly 
housed on a 12 hr light/dark cycle. Young adult mice were 3–6 months old, and aged adult 
mice were 14–18 months old. TetTag mice were generated by crossing transgenic mice that 
express a histone 2B-GFP fusion protein controlled by the tetO promoter (strain Tg(tetO-
HIST1H2BJ/GFP) 47Efu/J; stock number 005104; Jackson Laboratory) with mice that 
express tetracycline-transactivator (tTA) protein under control of the c-fos promoter. TetTag 
mice were maintained in a C57BL/6N background. Mice were born and raised on 
doxycycline (dox) chow (40 mg/kg) to prevent GFP expression prior to experimental 
manipulations. To open the window for activity-dependent labeling, dox chow was replaced 
with regular chow for 3 days prior to the start of an experiment. Expression of new GFP was 
shut off by administration of high dox chow (1g/kg). Memory linking (transfer of fear and

 enhancement) experiments were conducted with both C57Bl/6NTac × 129S6/SvEvTac and 
C57Bl/6NIA mice.
Viral construct
AAV1.Syn.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40 virus (titer: 4.65 × 1013 GC/ml) was purchased from 
Penn Vector Core. The hM3Dq vector was derived from the CaMK2a.hM4Di.T2A.EGFP/
CREB plasmid31. The hM4Di.T2A.EGFP/CREB in that plasmid was replaced by 
hM3Dq.T2A.EGFP/dTomato. The HA-tagged hM3Dq and dTomato-tagged EGFP are 
expressed under the CaMK2a promoter and cloned on either side of a T2A self-processing 
viral peptide. Vesicular-stomatitis-virus-G-protein-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were 
produced by calcium-phosphate-mediated transient transfection of human embryonic kidney 
293 T (HEK293T) cells, as previously described31. Lentivirus vectors were titered on 
HEK293T cells based on EGFP expression (titer: 6 ×105 cells/ml).
Surgery
Mice were anesthetized with 1.5 to 2.0% isoflurane for surgical procedures and placed into a 
stereotactic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). Lidocaine (2%; Akorn, Lake 
Forest, IL) was applied to the sterilized incision site as an analgesic, while subcutaneous 
saline injections were administered throughout each surgical procedure to prevent 
dehydration. In addition, carprofen (5mg/kg) and dexamethasone (0.2mg/kg) were 
administered both during surgery and for 7 days post-surgery with amoxicillin.
For calcium imaging experiments, mice underwent two separate surgical procedures. First, 
mice were unilaterally microinjected with 500 nanoliters of 
AAV1.Syn.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40 virus at 50nl/min into the dorsal CA1 using the 
stereotactic coordinates: −2.1 mm posterior to bregma, 2.0 mm lateral to midline and −1.65 
mm ventral to skull surface. Two weeks later, the microendoscope (a gradient refractive 
index lens) was implanted above the previous injection site. For the procedure, a 2.0mm 
diameter circular craniotomy was centered 0.5mm medial to the virus injection site. 
Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) was repeatedly applied to the exposed tissue to prevent 
drying. The cortex directly below the craniotomy was aspirated with a 27-gauge blunt 
syringe needle attached to a vacuum pump. The microendoscope (0.25 pitch, 0.50 NA, 
2.0mm in diameter and 4.79 in length, Grintech Gmbh) was slowly lowered with a 
stereotaxic arm above CA1 to a depth of 1.35mm ventral to the surface of the skull at the 
most posterior point of the craniotomy. Next, a skull screw was used to anchor the 
microendoscope to the skull. Both the microendoscope and skull screw were fixed with 
cyanoacrylate and dental cement. Kwik-Sil (World Precision Instruments) covered the 
microendoscope. Two weeks later, a small plastic baseplate was cemented onto the animal’s 
head atop the previously formed dental cement. Debris was removed from the exposed lens 
with ddH2O, lens paper and forceps. The microscope was placed on top of the baseplate and 
locked in a position in which the field of focus was in view, so that cells and visible 
landmarks, such as blood vessels, appeared sharp and in focus. Finally, a plastic cover was 
fit into the baseplate and secured by magnets.

 For aged DREADD experiments, mice were bilaterally microinjected with 700 nanoliters of 
Lentivirus CaMK2.hM3Dq.T2A.EGFP/dTomato virus at 100nl/min into the dorsal CA1 
using the stereotactic coordinates: −1.80 mm posterior to bregma, +/−1.50 mm lateral to 
midline, −1.60 mm ventral to skull surface; −2.50 mm posterior to bregma, +/−2.00 mm 
lateral to midline, −1.70 mm ventral to skull surface.
Drug injections
Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; Enzo Life Sciences) was made in a stock solution of 5mg/10ml in 
DMSO and then diluted in saline to desired concentration. CNO was injected (i.p.) at a dose 
of 0.5mg/kg 45 minutes prior to behavioral manipulation. MK-801 (Sigma-Aldrich) was 
diluted in saline and injected (i.p.) at a dose of 0.1mg/ml 30min prior to behavioral 
manipulation. Saline was used as the vehicle.
Behavioral procedures
Prior to all experiments, mice were handled for one minute in the vivarium each day for 
three days. Then, mice were habituated to transportation and external environmental cues by 
being carted out of the vivarium into the experimental rooms and handled for one minute in 
the experimental room each day for five days prior to the experiment. For within-subject 
experiments, mice explored three different contexts, separated by 7d or 5h. Exploration 
duration of each context was 10 minutes (C57Bl/6NTac and C57Bl/6NIA strains) or five 
minutes (C57Bl/6NTac×129S6/SvEvTac strain). Contexts were counterbalanced. For 
between-subject experiments, mice explored two contexts either separated by 7d or 5h. The 
area of each context was approximately 800 cm2. The shape (circular, triangular, square), 
scent (simple green, omega, alcohol), visual cues (white plastic walls/opaque textured 
flooring, black acrylic walls/white acrylic flooring, metal walls/metal grid flooring) were 
different for each context. For immediate shock32 (imm shock), mice were placed in the 
chamber with a baseline of 10 seconds (0.7mA- C57Bl/6NTac and C57Bl/6NIA strains) or 
six seconds (C57Bl/6NTac×129S6/SvEvTac strain) followed by a 2-second shock (0.7mA- 
C57Bl/6NTac and C57Bl/6NIA strains; 0.5mA- C57Bl/6NTac×129S6/SvEvTac strain). 
Thirty seconds after the shock, mice were placed back in their home cage. For context tests 
(cxt text), mice were returned to the designated context. For extinction (extinct) trials, mice 
were placed in a context for five minutes without shock. Freezing (the cessation of all 
movement except for respiration), was assessed via an automated scoring system (Med 
Associates) with 30 frames/s sampling; the mice needed to freeze continuously for at least 
one second before freezing could be counted33,34. Experimental groups and contexts were 
counterbalanced across the within-subjects design. For between-subjects design, animals 
were randomly assigned to groups.
Integrated miniature microscope data acquisition and analyses
Digital imaging data was sent from the CMOS imaging sensor (Aptina, MT9V032) to 
custom data acquisition (DAQ) electronics and USB Host Controller (Cypress, 
CYUSB3013) over a lightweight, highly flexible cable. The electronics packaged the data to 
comply with the USB Video Class (UVC) protocol and then transmit the data over Super 
Speed USB to a PC running custom DAQ software. The DAQ software was written in C++ 
and uses Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) libraries for image acquisition. Images are

 acquired at 30 frames per second and recorded to uncompressed .avi files. The DAQ 
software simultaneously records animal behavior, time stamping both video streams for 
offline alignment.
Our analysis suite, written in MATLAB, processes the raw videos and extracts relevant 
experimental information. Initial processing of calcium imaging data corrected column wise 
ADC variation, removed small movement artifacts using an amplitude based image 
registration algorithm, and calculated the mean fluorescence per pixel for conversion to 
dF/F. A fully automated segmentation algorithm identified and segmented pixels of active 
cells. The algorithm steps through the recorded calcium imaging video detecting pixel 
locations of local maxima of fluorescence which met a minimum dF/F criteria. For each of 
these pixel locations, an iterative process was used to group together neighboring pixels 
based on that pixel’s fluorescence time trace (+/−5 second window around local maxima of 
fluorescence event) correlation with the mean time trace of the pixels group in the previous 
iterative step. Pixels with high correlation (0.95) were added to the group and the process 
was repeated until the total number of pixels in the group no longer changed. Cells whose 
centers were within 7μm of each other or whose pixels overlapped by at least 80% were 
merged together. Once cells were segmented, we extracted dF/F traces and removed 
crosstalk between neighboring cells. Crosstalk was removed by first detecting calcium 
transients across all cells and then keeping only the largest event within a 30μm radius of the 
cell they were associated with7. Calcium events were calculated by first filtering the dF/F (2-
pole butterworth low-pass filter: 0.3Hz) to remove noise. Peaks in the filtered dF/F trace 
above 0.05 dF/F were detected and a window was calculated from the onset of the peak to 
the return back to baseline. If this window was greater than one second, it was counted as an 
event. Recordings from multiple sessions of the same animal were aligned using the same 
amplitude based registration algorithm used for within session registration, except the 
algorithm was only applied to the mean frame from each session. Once two sessions were 
registered, cells across two sessions were matched to each other using a distance measure 
(centers within 5μm of each other).

Confocal imaging and histological analysis
Forty-five minutes after exploration of a context, mice were transcardially perfused with 4% 
PFA, followed by 24 hr post-fixation in the same solution. Free-floating 50μm coronal 
sections were prepared using a vibratome. Sections were incubated in blocking solution 
containing 0.2% Triton X, 10% normal goat serum in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for at least 1 
hour at room temperature. Then the sections were incubated in the blocking solution with 
anti-EGR-1 rabbit primary antibody (Cell Signaling; 1:750 dilution for 24 hr at 4°C). After a 
series of 0.1 M phosphate buffer washes, sections were stained using the same blocking 
solution as above and Alexafluor 568 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno

 Research; 1:500 dilution for 2 hr at room temperature). Finally, sections were stained with 
DAPI (Invitrogen; 1:1,000 dilution for 15 min) and mounted on slides.
Sections from −1.8mm to −2.2mm posterior to bregma were imaged at 20× magnification 
using a Nikon C2 or A1 confocal microscope. All imaging was done using standardized 
laser settings, held constant for samples from the same experimental data set. Cells were 
manually counted by a blinded rater. Images were quantified from 1–4 sections per animal. 
The percentage of DAPI-labeled cells containing GFP, ZIF, or both was calculated for each 
image and then averaged to produce a single measurement for each animal. To normalize for 
chance, we subtracted chance (GFP/DAPI) × (ZIF/DAPI) × 100 from the observed overlap 
(GFP and ZIF)/DAPI × 100 and then divided by chance.
Electrophysiology
Mice were anesthetized with a cocktail (3 mL/kg) containing ketamine (25 mg/mL), 
xylazine (1.3 mg/mL), and acepromazine (0.25 mg/mL) and perfused for 3 minutes with ice-
cold, oxygenated, sucrose ACSF containing (in mM) 83 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 3.3 MgSO4, 0.5 
CaCl2, 1NaH2PO4, 26.2 NaHCO3, 22 glucose, and 72 sucrose (~315 mOsml, pH 7.4). The 
brain was rapidly dissected and 300 μm-thick coronal slices were collected and transferred 
to an interface chamber containing the same modified sucrose ACSF solution and incubated 
at 34° C for 30 min. Slices were then held at room temperature (23° C) in the interface 
chamber for at least 45 min before initiating recordings. Recordings were made in a 
submersion-type recording chamber and perfused with oxygenated ACSF containing (in 
mM) 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.3 NaH2PO4, 26.0 NaHCO3, 20 glucose 
(~295 mOsml) at 23° C at a rate of 1–2 ml/minute.
All recordings were performed within the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Neurons were 
selected based on emission spectra (GFP+ or GFP-), and were then visualized under infrared 
differential interference contrast video microscopy (Olympus BX-51 scope and Rolera XR 
digital camera). Whole-cell recordings were made at room temperature using pulled patch 
pipettes (5–6 MΩ) filled with internal solution containing (in mM) 150 K-Gluconate, 1.5 
MgCl2, 5.0 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 10 phosphocreatine, 2.0 ATP, and 0.3 GTP. Recordings were 
obtained using Multiclamp 700B patch amplifiers (Molecular Devices) and data analyzed 
using pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). Data were acquired from cells requiring 
less than −100 pA to hold at a membrane potential of −70mV. Current-spike relationship 
was determined with a series of depolarizing current steps applied for 500 ms in 10pA 
increments at 5 sec intervals.
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism version 6.00 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California USA) was used for 
statistical analyses. Statistical significance was assessed by two-tailed paired Student’s t-
tests, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests, one-way ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA where 
appropriate. Significant effects or interactions were followed up with post-hoc testing with 
the use of Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) where specified in the figure legends. 
Significance levels were set to P = 0.05. Significance for comparisons: *P < 0.05; **P < 
0.01; ***P < 0.001. Sample sizes were chosen on the basis of previous studies. Data met

 assumptions of statistical tests, and variance was similar between groups for all metrics 
measured.
Extended Data
Extended Data Figure 1. Stability of fluorescence and overlap
a, Average normalized mean fluorescence within session. There was no difference between 
the mean fluorescence across the 3 sessions (one-way repeated measures ANOVA, F2,7 = 
0.423, n.s.). b, Average normalized mean fluorescence within session. There was no 
difference between the mean fluorescence across a 10-minute session (one-way repeated 
measures ANOVA, F9,22 = 1.108, n.s.). Results show mean +/− s.d. c, Higher ensemble 
overlap with 5h interval than 7d. Normalized ensemble overlap is calculated as the ensemble 
overlap between contexts separated by 5h divided by the ensemble overlap between contexts 
separated by 7d. A normalized overlap value of 1 signifies that there is no difference 
between the overlap at 5h and 7d. The minimum number of calcium events required from 
each cell for the cell to be considered “active” (inclusion criteria) was systematically 
increased and the ratio of the ensemble overlap for the different context was calculated. For 
all inclusion criteria, there is higher ensemble overlap with a 5h than 7d interval (one-sample 
t-test against 1,(1) t7 = 3.00, p=0.02, (2) t7 = 2.57, p=0.04, (3) t7 = 2.42, p=0.04, (4) t7 = 
2.50, p=0.04, (5) t7 = 2.32, p=0.05. Results show mean +/− sem.

 Extended Data Figure 2. Neural ensembles of environments are reliably reactivated at recall of 
an open field and linear track
a, Experimental design. Mice were imaged while exploring contexts A and B separated by 
7d and imaged while exploring contexts C and C separated by 7d. b, There was a higher 
percent of cells reactivated when animals explored the same context (C–C) than when 
animals explored different contexts (A–B) (paired t-test, t3 = 6.305, p=0.0081, n=4). c, Mice 
were trained to run on a 2-meter linear track with the miniature microscope for water 
rewards. Mice were trained 3 days a week for 3 weeks with a delay interval of 2–3 days 
between each session. Place fields were calculated by deconvolving calcium dF/F traces 
with an exponential to extract approximate spike times. Spikes that remained after crosstalk 
removal were included for analysis. Animal position was extracted using an automated LED 
tracking algorithm. A speed threshold (3cm/s) was applied to both the animal position and 
extracted spike timing and the resulting data was spatially binned (6.5cm bins). Spatial firing 
rates were calculated by dividing the binned spike counts by the binned occupancy and 
smoothing with a Gaussian filter (sigma=6.5cm). Cells which showed consistent spatial 
firing modulation on at least 3 trials, with all other trials showing no bursting activity, were 
considered as place cells. Normalized spatial firing rates of all matched cells independently 
meeting the place cell criteria for both days. The data are pooled across 3 mice and include 
both motion directions. Place fields are ordered by centroid location on session 2. d, A shift 
of the image registration between sessions results in a decrease in matched place cells. A 
translational shift both horizontally and vertically was applied to the image registration 
transformation used in A. Cells were then matched across days and those which met our 
place cell criteria were kept. The heat map shows the count of matched place cells with a 
centroid shift of the place field that is less than 33cm. Optimum matching of cells occurred 
within a 1-pixel translation of the calculated alignment transformation. e, Distribution of

matching between sessions matches random cells.
Extended Data Figure 3. Five hours after exploration of a context, GFP expression is shut off by 
doxycycline and excitability is increased
a, Experimental design. Mice were removed from low levels of dox (40mg/kg) and given 
regular chow for 3 days to open up the GFP tagging window. After receiving administration 
of high dox (1g/kg) for 5h, mice were injected with 30mg/kg of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), 
exposed to a novel context or left in their homecage. An hour later, mice were transcardially 
perfused and processed for GFP expression. b, There was no difference in GFP expression 
between the 3 groups (one-way ANOVA, F2,5 = 0.04, n.s., n=3,3,2), demonstrating that 5h 
was enough time for dox (1g/kg) to suppress expression of new GFP. c, To test excitability 
learning-related excitability changes, mice explored a novel context and then were 
administered high dox to shut off new GFP. Five hours later, mice were sacrificed for in vitro 
slice physiology. d, A two-way repeated measures ANOVA (group × current step) had a 
significant main effect of group (F2,68 = 4.20, p<0.05, n=21,29,21). 5h GFP+ group had 
more spikes than the 5h GFP- group (t68 = 2.31, p<0.05) and HC GFP- (t68 = 2.72, p<0.05). 
There was no difference between 5h GFP- and HC GFP- groups (t68 = 0.61, n.s.). Results 
show mean +/− sem.

than groups B (t57=2.18, p=0.03) and D (t57=2.99, p=0.004). f, Design for enhancement 
experiment. g, There was a significant difference in freezing (one-way ANOVA, F2,51=9.63, 
p<0.001, n=14,20,20). The 5h group had more freezing than the home cage (HC) (t51=3.98, 
p=0.0002) and 7d (t51=3.45, p=0.001) groups. There was no difference between HC or 7d 
groups (t51=0.86, n.s.). Significance: *p<0.05, **p<0.01. Results show mean +/− sem.

 Figure 4. Age-related deficits in memory linking are rescued by ensemble activation
a, Design for calcium imaging with miniature microscope in aged mice. b, There was no 
difference in the overlapping ensemble between 5h and 7d (paired t-test, t3=0.367, n.s., n=4). 
c, Design for transfer of fear experiment. d, There was a significant difference in freezing 
during the context test (one-way ANOVA, F2,47=8.083, p=0.001, n=19,15,16). There was no 
difference between freezing levels in contexts B and D (t47=0.35, n.s.). Animals had more 
freezing in context C than B (t4 =3.19, p=0.0025) and D (t47=3.619, p=0.0007). e, Design 
for behavioral enhancement experiment. f, There was no difference in freezing between 
groups (one-way ANOVA, F2,39=0.453, n.s., n=15,15,12). g, Design for memory linking 
rescue by activating cells with DREADD receptors. h, There was higher freezing in the 
CNO group compared to the SAL group (unpaired t-test, t31=2.36, p=0.02, n=12,21). 
Significance: *p<0.05, **p<0.01. Results show mean +/− sem.
