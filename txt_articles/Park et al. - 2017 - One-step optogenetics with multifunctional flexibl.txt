 single biocompatible platform remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a device composed of an 
optical waveguide, six electrodes, and two microfluidic channels produced via fiber drawing. Our 
probes facilitated injections of viral vectors carrying opsin genes, while providing collocated 
neural recording and optical stimulation. The miniature (< 200 μm) footprint and modest weight 
(<0.5 g) of these probes allowed for multiple implantations into the mouse brain, which enabled 
opto-electrophysiological investigation of projections from the basolateral amygdala to the medial 
prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus during behavioral experiments. Fabricated solely from 
polymers and polymer composites, these flexible probes minimized tissue response to achieve 
chronic multimodal interrogation of brain circuits with high fidelity.
INTRODUCTION
With its genetic precision and millisecond resolution1, optogenetics is an indispensable tool 
in neuroscience to correlate electrophysiological contributions of specific cell types to 
observed behaviors2,3. As this method depends on expression of light-sensitive microbial 
opsins in genetically identifiable neuronal populations4, viral vectors must be infused 
directly into neural tissue. Opsins typically exhibit activation spectra in the visible range, 
where scattering properties of biological matter limit the penetration depth to <1mm5, which 
necessitates implantation of light sources and additional hardware for electrophysiological 
readout. While significant progress has been made to engineer flexible6, multifunctional and 
wireless probes with viral delivery and optical stimulation capabilities7,8, integration of a 
recording functionality into these platforms continues to be a technological challenge. The 
development of such an integrated device is further complicated by the foreign body reaction 
to implanted probes, which stems from acute9 and chronic10 tissue damage that scale with 
the probe size and stiffness, respectively11.
Here we develop miniature and flexible all-polymer integrated probes for behavioral 
optogenetic studies of neural circuits with reduced mechanical invasiveness. Our probes 
incorporate recording electrodes, optical waveguides, and microfluidic channels all within 
the dimensions of silica fibers routinely used in optogenetic experiments. To produce these 
probes, we rely on the thermal drawing process12,13 that has previously facilitated 
fabrication of multifunctional devices for neural interfaces14. Our probes allowed for one-
step surgery including injection of viral vectors carrying opsin genes into specific locations 
of the mouse brain and subsequent recording and optical stimulation of neural activity 
during free behavior. The small footprint of these devices permitted their implantation into 
several brain regions, facilitating optical control of behavior and electrophysiological 
readout of the underlying projection dynamics. With integrated modalities and a miniature 
footprint, this technology offers a minimally invasive alternative to multiple-step surgeries 
required for optogenetic mapping of brain function.

 tissue to achieve improved long-term recording performance compared to metallic 
electrodes16,17. These materials, however, often exhibit poor conductivity and are 
incompatible with high-throughput integration techniques18. Carbon-loaded polymer 
composites are characterized by high chemical stability in physiological solutions as well as 
tunable elastic properties19,20. The substantial sheet resistance of commercially available 
composites, however, restricts electrode miniaturization due to increased impedance, which 
reduces the ability of these electrodes to detect extracellular potentials.
To significantly improve electrode conductivity, we developed a custom conductive polymer 
composite comprised of conductive polyethylene (CPE) and 5 wt% graphite (Fig. 1a, 
gCPE). The sheet resistance of the composite was reduced by 4.1 times when compared to 
commercially available CPE (0.8 kΩ/γ for gCPE vs. 3.3 kΩ/γ for CPE). We hypothesized 
that the reduced sheet resistance should afford lower electrode dimensions without 
sacrificing the quality of electrophysiological recordings. Along with a waveguide core 
(polycarbonate (PC), refractive index nPC=1.586, glass transition temperature Tg=150°C21) 
and cladding (cyclic olefin copolymer (COC), refractive index nCOC=1.53, Tg=158°C22), six 
gCPE electrodes (melting temperature TM~123°C) were incorporated into a macroscopic 
template, a preform, by standard machining to produce a scaled-up version of the desired 
fiber (Fig. 1b). The preform was then heated and stretched into ~100 meter–long fiber with 
preform feature dimensions reduced by 50~200 times (Fig. 1c–e, Supplementary Fig. 1). By 
adjusting the drawing parameters, the sizes of electrodes and microfluidic channels were 
reduced to 20–30 μm, while the diameter of the waveguide was tuned between 50–80 μm. 
The entire integrated structure had a diameter between 180–220 μm. (Fig. 1f). For our 
experiments we have selected a fiber section with a diameter of 200 μm. Within this 10 
meter long section the dimensions of the six electrodes were found to be 20.9±1.3 μm, 
20.7±0.9 μm, 25.8±1.5 μm, 24.0±1.8 μm, 24.5±1.4 μm, and 22.6±2.3 μm; the microfluidic 
channels had dimensions of 16.4±2.1 μm and 15.3±1.9 μm; and the waveguide diameter 
measured 68.2±2.9 μm (Supplementary Fig. 1e).
Evaluation of mechanical, electrical, optical, and microfluidic properties of the fiber
The integrated fiber probes were flexible with a bending stiffness of 76.1–83.5 N/m in the 
frequency range of respiration and heartbeat (0.01–10 Hz), which is significantly lower than 
that of silica optical fibers (93.6–104.8 N/m) of comparable dimensions (Supplementary Fig. 
2a). As neural interface devices are commonly fixed to the skull, the lower bending stiffness 
is anticipated to reduce the repeated tissue damage associated with relative motion of the 
brain with respect to the skull23. The impedance of multifunctional fiber electrodes at 1 kHz 
was found to be 1.31±0.27 MΩ, and could be further reduced to 0.62±0.23 MΩ by an 
overnight soak in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution (Fig. 1g, h). Similar reduction 
to 0.67±0.12 MΩ was observed 3 days following implantation into the mouse brain, and the 
impedance remained consistent over 3 months (0.71±0.13 MΩ, Supplementary Fig. 2b). The 
observed decrease in impedance when compared to commercial CPE electrodes (2.10±0.39 
MΩ/1.83±0.44 MΩ before/after soaking) could be attributed to the reduced sheet resistance 
and enhanced porosity of the composite electrodes (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Notably, the 
impedance of the composite gCPE electrodes was dominated by the tip geometry while the 
conductivity of the electrodes produced from commercial CPE was limited by sheet

 resistance (Supplementary Fig. 2d). The impedance of the gCPE electrodes was invariant 
with respect to 90° bending deformation (Fig. 1g), and no current leakage through the 
polymer cladding (Supplementary Fig 2e, f) was observed. In addition, cyclic voltammetry 
curves of the gCPE electrodes exhibited capacitive behavior without any oxidation or 
reduction peaks within a voltage window exceeding the magnitude of extracellular potentials 
(Supplementary Fig 2g). The integrated waveguides exhibited relatively flat transmission in 
the visible spectrum, including the excitation peak of channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) at a 
wavelength λ=473 nm24 (Supplementary Fig. 3a), as well as low transmission loss (< 1.5 
dB/cm) (Supplementary Fig. 3b), which was maintained at body temperature (37 °C, 
Supplementary Fig. 3c, d), during bending deformation (90°–270° angles at radii of 
curvature 0.5–15 mm) and even following repeated bending cycles (Supplementary Fig. 3e, 
f). Transmission loss was also not affected by implantation into the mouse brain for up to 3 
months (no longer time points were collected, Supplementary Fig. 3g). To confirm the utility 
of microfluidic channels for delivery of liquids into the brain tissue, a solution of a dye was 
infused into a brain phantom (0.6% agarose gel) (Fig. 1i). Return rate 70–95% of injected 
fluid at infusion speeds 1–100 nl/s was observed even during bending deformation (Fig. 1j). 
The maximum amount of fluid contained within a single microfluidic channel of 1 cm-long 
probe is 7.85 μl (which exceeds the volume of 3 μl that can be safely delivered into a mouse 
brain25), however unlimited amount can be delivered by connecting the channels to an 
external pump via miniature tubing.
Optogenetic interrogation of prefrontal cortex with multifunctional fibers
By integrating recording, optical stimulation, and microfluidic capabilities, our probe 
enabled multiple simultaneous experiments to be conducted following a one-step 
implantation surgery (Fig. 2a). The thermally drawn multifunctional fibers were outfitted 
with ferrules for optical coupling to lasers or light-emitting diodes, pin connectors for 
electrical readout, and tubing for fluid interfaces, respectively (Fig. 2b). The resulting probe 
weighed 0.3–0.5 g. To evaluate the ability of the fiber probes to mediate opto-
electrophysiological interrogation of neural circuits, we implanted these devices into the 
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of wild-type (WT) mice (Fig. 2c). There the integrated 
microfluidic channels were used to deliver an adeno-associated virus (AAV, serotype 5) 
carrying the gene for ChR2 fused to the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) under 
the excitatory neuronal promoter calmodulin kinase II α-subunit (AAV5-CaMKIIα::ChR2-
eYFP) (Fig. 2d). Robust ChR2 expression in the mPFC was observed 2 weeks following the 
injection, and the extent of expression was proportional to the injection volume (Fig. 2e and 
Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). By combining the ability to deliver viral vectors through 
microfluidic channels and perform neural recording with gCPE electrodes during optical 
stimulation via integrated PC/COC waveguides, our probes provided an opportunity to 
investigate the temporal dynamics of the opsin expression in the mouse brain (Fig. 2f, 
Supplementary Table 1). To identify the onset of ChR2 expression following the injection of 
the AAV5 into the mPFC, electrophysiological signals were recorded in the presence of 
optogenetic stimulation (10 Hz, 8.6 mW/mm2, 5 ms pulse width). For these stimulation 
parameters, which are common in optogenetics experiments, optically evoked potentials in 
the mPFC were observed following 11±2 days (n=8). As expected the amplitude of optically

 evoked signal increased at larger optical powers and longer expression periods 
(Supplementary Fig. 4c).
Qualitatively similar optically evoked responses were found during acute recordings in 
transgenic Thy1-ChR2-YFP mice during optical stimulation at 10 Hz (Supplementary Fig. 
5a–f). Stimulation at 100 Hz evoked activity uncorrelated with optical pulses, further 
confirming the physiological origin of the optically evoked potentials26 (Supplementary Fig. 
5g–l). As a third measure ensuring the physiological (rather than optical artifact) nature of 
our recordings, experiments in WT mice injected with a control virus AAV5-
CaMKIIa::eYFP revealed no neural response to light pulses (Supplementary Fig. 6).
To illustrate the utility of the fiber probes for neurobiological experiments, WT mice 
implanted with fiber probes and transduced with AAV5-CaMKIIa::ChR2-eYFP or a control 
virus AAV5-CaMKIIa::eYFP in the mPFC were subjected to a standard open field test 
(OFT, 9 min session, 3 min light OFF/ON/OFF epochs) 6 weeks following surgery. Optical 
stimulation (5 ms pulse width, 16 mW/mm2) in mPFC at 20 Hz and 130 Hz resulted in 
increased velocity (p < 0.05) in ChR2-expressing mice as compared to eYFP controls. (Fig 
2g–j, Supplementary Video 1, 2). In agreement with prior experiments27, there was no 
change in the time spent in the center of the open field for either group of mice 
(Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). In addition to the behavioral manifestation and 
electrophysiological readout, increased neuronal firing in ChR2-expressing mice was 
confirmed by the upregulation of an immediate early gene c-fos in the mPFC following 
optical stimulation. No c-fos upregulation was observed in control mice (Supplementary Fig. 
7c–e).
Optical control and electrophysiological readout of projection dynamics with co-implanted 
fibers
Low footprint of the probes permitted their implantation into multiple brain targets and 
facilitated opto-electrophysiological projection mapping. In this study, one probe was 
implanted into the basolateral amygdala (BLA), where it was used for microfluidic delivery 
of AAV5-CaMKIIα::ChR2-eYFP or the control virus (AAV5-CaMKIIα::eYFP), and the 
second identical probe was implanted into either the mPFC28,29 (Fig. 3a–d) or the ventral 
hippocampus (vHPC)30 (Fig. 3e–h), which are known to receive excitatory projections from 
the BLA.
Similarly to the experiments in the mPFC, we have employed the fiber probes to identify the 
onset of functional ChR2 expression in the BLA and its projection targets (Supplementary 
Table 1). In the BLA, optically evoked (10 Hz, 8.6 mW/mm2, 5 ms pulse width) neural 
activity emerged 11±2 days following AAV5 injection (n=8 mice, Fig. 3i). In the BLA-to-
mPFC projection, optical stimulation evoked a low-latency (5 ms delay with respect to laser 
pulses) responses following 12±1 days (n=8 mice), and an additional response with a longer 
latency of 32 ms has emerged after 15±2 days (n=6 mice, Fig. 3j, Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). 
The evoked potentials with short latencies are consistent with direct axonal projections from 
the BLA to mPFC, while the long-latency activity may stem from a multi-synaptic network 
responses to optical stimulation in the mPFC27. In contrast to stimulation of the BLA inputs 
in the mPFC, optical excitation in the vHPC evoked only short-latency activity indicative of

 direct axonal inputs from the BLA (Fig. 3k). This optically triggered activity could be 
measured 11±2 days (n=8 mice) following AAV5 injection into the BLA. The faster onset of 
functional ChR2 expression in the BLA-to-vHPC as compared to BLA-to-mPFC projection 
could in part be explained by the shorter inter-region distance for the former projection. 
Similar to the recordings following the direct injection of the AAV5 into the mPFC, the 
amplitude of the ChR2-mediated signals in the BLA and its projection targets increased with 
optical power and period of expression (Supplementary Fig. 8c–e).
The observed electrophysiological response to optical stimulation of the BLA-to-vHPC 
projections was further correlated to the behavioral response observed in previous studies of 
this circuit30. Specifically, during the OFT (9-minute session, 3-minute OFF/ON/OFF 
epochs, Supplementary Video 3), mice transfected with ChR2 spent less time in the center of 
the open field during optical stimulation (20 Hz, 5ms pulse width) compared to the control 
group (Fig. 3l–n, p < 0.05). The total distance traveled and the average velocity, however, 
were not modulated by the optical stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). An increase in c-
fos expression was observed in the pyramidal layer of vHPC in ChR2-expressing mice 
whereas no change was found in the control group (Supplementary Fig. 9c–h). Consistent 
with stimulation of the vHPC, there was no significant change in neuronal c-fos level found 
in the BLA. To further confirm that the observed behavioral change in response to optical 
stimulation was a consequence of activation of BLA inputs in the vHPC, we employed fiber 
probes implanted in the vHPC to deliver AMPA receptor antagonist, synaptic blocker, 6-
cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). The dose of CNQX was first calibrated by 
simultaneously performing electrophysiological recording and optical stimulation during the 
infusion of the drug (Supplementary Fig. 10). Following CNQX infusion (0.5 μl, 0.1 mM) 
into the vHPC, optical stimulation of the BLA terminals did not result in behavioral 
changes, and ChR2-expressing mice were as likely to spend time in the center of the open 
field as the control mice during the light stimulation epoch (Fig 3o, p = 0.2319, 
Supplementary Video 4).
Assessment of chronic long-term performance and biocompatibility of fiber probes
As many neurobiological studies rely on being able to track the activity of identifiable 
neurons over the course of several weeks, we thought to investigate the ability of fiber 
probes to record isolated action potentials over a period of 3 months. We found that single 
neuron (unit) action potentials (spikes) can be isolated from our recordings using principle 
component analysis (PCA), and the spike shapes remain stable between 1 and 12 weeks (no 
longer time points were collected) following fiber probe implantation (Fig. 4a, b). For the 
representative units shown in Fig. 4a, b, separation between spike clusters was confirmed by 
calculating L-ratios, (Lratio < 0.01 for all isolated units, Supplementary Table 2). Stability of 
the clusters was further confirmed by the analysis of the interspike interval (ISI) histograms 
(Fig. 4c, maximum interval 1000 ms, bin size 40 ms), as well as by calculating the average 
firing rates. The latter were found to be statistically different for the isolated units (p < 
0.001, Fig. 4d). Supplementary Figure 11 contains PCA, ISI and firing rate analyses for 
additional isolated single units recorded from different mice over a period of 12 weeks. In 
addition to electrophysiological recording, the fiber probes maintained optical stimulation 
capability for up to 3 months (no longer time points were collected) with no significant

 decrease in signal to noise ratio (4.7±0.8 for 1 month, 3.9±0.4 for 2 months, and 4.1±0.5 for 
3 months, Fig. 4e–g).
We evaluated the biocompatibility of our all-polymer integrated fiber probes by immuno-
histochemical quantification of markers characteristic of glial scarring (activated 
macrophage marker Iba1: ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1, microglial marker 
ED1: cluster differentiation 68: CD68/macrosialin, astrocytic marker GFAP: glial fibrillary 
acidic protein) and chronic tissue damage associated with the breach of the blood-brain 
barrier (presence of Immunoglobulin G, IgG, in the brain tissue) in coronal brain slices (Fig 
5, Supplementary Fig. 12)11,31. Compared to similarly sized insulated steel microwires (125 
μm in diameter), the polymer fibers evoked significantly lower tissue response and blood-
brain barrier breach 3 days following implantation (p < 0.001 for Iba1 and ED1, p < 0.01 for 
GFAP, and p < 0.05 for IgG). The attenuated levels of all markers were found for fiber 
probes implanted for up to 3 months, while significance persisted for the diminished 
presence of Iba1, GFAP (p < 0.05, up to 1 month) and ED1 (p < 0.05, up to 2 weeks).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we combined the fiber drawing process with conductive composite engineering 
to develop all-polymer miniaturized multifunctional probes for simultaneous optogenetic 
stimulation, neural recording, and delivery of viral vectors and pharmacological compounds 
into the mouse brain. Previously, diameters exceeding 400 μm for multifunctional thermally 
drawn probes were necessitated by comparatively large electrode dimensions designed to 
compensate for the poor electrical conductivity of commercially available polymer 
composites. The custom conductive polymer composite (gCPE) developed in this study was 
instrumental to reducing electrode dimensions and impedance, allowing for integration of 
higher density electrophysiology (6 electrodes), optical stimulation (a waveguide) and fluid 
delivery (2 channels) within probes with diameters <200 μm comparable to or smaller than 
those of silica fibers used for optogenetics. The flexibility and miniature footprint enhanced 
the biocompatibility of the probes as indicated by stable long-term recordings of isolated 
single-neuron action potentials as well as reduced glial response and blood-brain barrier 
breach 3 months after implantation.
We demonstrated the utility of the miniature and lightweight (<0.5 g) fiber probes by 
applying them to dynamic opto-electrophysiological study of ChR2 expression within 
individual brain regions and projection circuits. The latter was enabled by simultaneous 
implantations of multiple probes. Neural activity correlated with optical stimulation was 
found 11 days following viral delivery of ChR2 into the mPFC and BLA of wild type mice. 
In mice virally transduced with ChR2 in the BLA, the onset of optically-evoked neural 
activity in the vHPC was 11 days. In the BLA-to-mPFC projection optical responses were 
recorded 12 days following viral delivery into the BLA, and additional long-latency 
responses have emerged after 15 days. The observed differences in ChR2 expression in 
projections could in part be attributed to the proximity of the regions.
Functional expression of ChR2 was further confirmed in behaving mice through observation 
of increased locomotor activity during optical stimulation in the mPFC of animals virally

 transduced in this region, as well as through observation of an anxiety phenotype arising 
during optical stimulation of an established BLA-to-vHPC projection, which could be 
counteracted by an injection of a synaptic blocker CNQX. Although a variety of approaches, 
such as optogenetics32,33 and DREADD-facilitated behavioral modulation34,35 combined 
with patch-clamp electrophysiology36,37 in brain slices, are currently employed for 
functional projection mapping, these techniques do not permit direct correlation of circuit 
dynamics to observed behavioral outputs. By integrating dense neural recordings with the 
delivery of transgenes and optical stimuli within a miniature footprint, our device invites 
multi-site studies of neural projections to probe electrophysiological dynamics underlying a 
particular neurobiological process or a disease state.
Challenging backend connectorization is a common barrier for widespread neurotechnology 
adoption within the neuroscience community. Detailed hands-on instructions for connecting 
our multifunctional fibers to external headstages, light sources, and microinjection pumps 
(Supplementary Fig. 13) should enable straightforward assembly of the probes described 
here without the need for specialized equipment. This should enable a diversity of cell-type 
identification experiments in complex neural circuits38, where one-step optogenetic 
capability would ensure one-to-one correspondence of optical and electrophysiological 
neural interrogation.
Methods
Synthesis of graphite-doped conductive polyethylene (gCPE)
Conductive polyethylene (CPE; Hillas Packaging) sheets were cut into 9 cm disks. Each disk 
was weighed and placed into a petri dish. Graphite particles (Sigma) were dissolved in the 
ethanol (70% by volume), and mixed by a vortex mixer and ultrasonicator. The solution was 
poured onto CPE sheets (5% graphite by weight relative to CPE), and dried overnight. 
Following drying disks were weighed again to confirm the graphite content. Several CPE 
sheets coated with graphite were stacked and consolidated in the hot press at 160 °C forming 
a “mille-feuille”-like structure. At high temperature, graphite particles get embedded within 
the bulk of molten CPE. The first consolidation step creates a heterogeneous CPE composite 
with non-uniform dispersion of graphite particles. To achieve uniform distribution of 
graphite within the gCPE composite, the consolidated material was cut into millimeter 
fragments and subjected to another consolidation step under pressure at 160–180 °C. The 
latter two steps were repeated 3 times, resulting in a gCPE composite with uniform graphite 
distribution and sheet resistance significantly lower than that of commercial CPE.
All-polymer multifunctional fiber fabrication
The fibers were produced by thermal drawing from macroscopic templates (preforms). To 
fabricate a preform, cyclic olefin copolymer (COC; TOPAS) sheets were rolled onto a 16 
mm-thick polycarbonate (PC; Ajedium Films) rod, which was followed by several additional 
PC sheets. Eight rectangular grooves were machined within the outer PC layer, and six of 
the grooves were filled with gCPE electrodes. Additional COC sheets were wrapped around 
the structure, followed by several layers of PC that formed a sacrificial cladding that enabled 
stable processing conditions. The resulting preforms were consolidated under vacuum at

 190 °C and then drawn at 240 °C using a custom-built fiber drawing tower as described in 
prior work14.
Physical characterization of multifunctional fibers
The bending stiffness of the multifunctional fibers was measured by a dynamic mechanical 
analyzer (DMA, Q800, TA Instruments) in a single cantilever mode with 50 μm deformation 
amplitude within the frequency range 0.01–10 Hz. To quantify optical transmission losses, 
multifunctional fibers were coupled to a diode-pumped solid state (DPSS) laser (Laserglow, 
50 mW maximum output, wavelength λ=473 nm) via ferrules and the light output was 
measured by photodetector (S121C, 400–1100 nm, 500 mW, Thorlabs) attached to power 
meter (PM100D, Thorlabs). Optical transmission was quantified for fiber length between 1–
10 cm, bending angles 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°, and radii of curvature 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 
12.5, and 15 mm. Impedance of gCPE electrodes within fiber probes of lengths between 1–
10 cm was measured by a LCR meter (HP4284A, Agilent Technologies) using a sinusoidal 
driving voltage (10 mV, 100 Hz ~ 10 kHz). Impedance spectra for gCPE electrodes were 
collected before and after a 24 hr soak in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). To characterize 
microfluidic channels, fiber probes were outfitted with external tubing and connected to the 
standard precision injection apparatus (NanoFil Syringe and UMP-3 Syringe pump, Word 
Precision Instruments). 10 μl of water was injected with at infusion speeds of 1, 10, 20, 50, 
80, and 100 nl/s through the fiber channels, and injection rates were calculated by comparing 
input and output weight. The injection capability was also confirmed via infusion of the 
BlueJuice (10X, ThermoFisher Scientific) into 0.6% agarose gel at a speed of 100 nl/min.
Assembly of the multifunctional fiber-probes
The sacrificial PC layer was etched by immersion into dichloromethane (Sigma) for 1 min. 
To establish interfaces with embedded electrodes, the latter were exposed from the cladding 
manually, and silver paint (SPI Supplies) was used to connect the electrodes to the copper 
wires. The copper wires were wrapped around the fiber 20 min following the introduction of 
silver paint to allow for evaporation of the paint thinner. Connections to different electrodes 
were established at different locations along the fiber probe to avoid cross-talk. The wires 
were then soldered to the female pin connectors (Digi-Key). An insulated stainless steel 
ground wire was soldered to one of the pins. Finally, the entire electrode interface region of 
the fiber probe was coated with 5-min epoxy (Devcon) for mechanical stability and electrical 
insulation. For microfluidic interfaces, empty channels were exposed manually through the 
cladding and the entire region was placed within ethylene vinyl acetate tubing (0.5 mm inner 
diameter, McMaster-Carr) such that the fiber and the tubing were perpendicular to each 
other, allowing for fluid flow into microfluidic channels through the openings made in the 
cladding. The tubing was then affixed to the fiber with 5-min epoxy. Optical coupling was 
established by placing the uppermost part of the fiber into a 6.5 mm-long, 1.25 mm diameter 
zirconia ferrule (Thorlabs) and affixing it with optical epoxy (Thorlabs). The ferrule edge 
was then polished using a Thorlabs fiber polishing kit.

 Laboratory Animals. Male C57BL/6 mice aged 6–8 weeks (Jackson Laboratory), and 
transgenic Thy1-ChR2-YFP mice (donated by G. Feng) aged 9–10 weeks were used for the 
study, and all surgeries were conducted under aseptic conditions. Mice were anaesthetized 
using via intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ketamine/xylazine mixture in saline (in mg/kg 
bodyweight: ketamine, 100; xylazine, 10), and then positioned in a stereotactic frame (David 
Kopf Instruments). A skin incision was made to expose the skull. Lambda and bregma points 
were used to align the skull with respect to the Mouse Brain Atlas39. All implantation and 
injection coordinates were established according to the brain atlas. The following three types 
of surgeries were performed: (a) a single injection/implantation in a medial prefrontal cortex 
(mPFC, coordinates relative to bregma; 1.7 mm anteroposterior (AP); 0.4 mm mediolateral 
(ML); −1.8 mm dorsoventral (DV)); (b) a viral injection/implantation of a fiber probe into 
basolateral amygdala (BLA, −1.6 mm AP; 3.2–3.4 mm ML; −4.9 mm DV) and a 
concomitant implantation of an identical fiber probe into mPFC (1.7 mm AP; 0.4 mm ML; 
−1.8 mm DV); (c) a viral injection/implantation of a fiber probe into BLA and a concomitant 
implantation of a fiber probe into ventral hippocampus (vHPC, −3.08 mm AP; 3.6–3.7 mm 
ML; −3.4 mm DV). Adeno-associated viruses serotype 5 (AAV5) carrying 
CaMKIIα::hChR2(H134R)-eYFP and CaMKIIα::eYFP plasmids were purchased from 
University of North Carolina Vector Core (Chapel Hill, NC) at concentrations of 2×1012 
particles/mL and 3×1012 particles/mL respectively. Using a standard microinjection 
apparatus (NanoFil Syringe and UMP-3 Syringe pump, Word Precision Instruments) 0.5 μl 
of virus was injected through the microfluidic channels of implanted fiber probes at an 
infusion rate of 100 nl/min. During injections, the fiber-probes were raised 0.1 mm to 
accommodate the virus volume. The stainless steel ground wire was soldered to a miniature 
screw, which was affixed to the skull. Multifunctional probes were fixed to the skull with 
layer of adhesive (C&B Metabond; Parkell) and dental cement (Jet-Set 4, Lang Dental). 
Following the surgery and recovery, mice were single housed and were maintained at 22 °C 
and a 12 hour light/dark cycle and provided with food and water ad libitum.
In vivo electrophysiology
Multifunctional fiber-probes were attached to PZ2-32 head stage connected to RZ5D 
electrophysiology system (Tucker Davis Technologies, TDT). For optogenetic stimulation, a 
DPSS laser (Laserglow Technologies, 50 mW maximum power, wavelength λ = 473 nm) 
was air-coupled to a silica fiber patchcord, which was then connected to a fiber probe via a 
ferrule-to-ferrule coupling. For all experiments, pulsed stimulation with 5 ms pulse width 
was used. Frequencies of 10, 20, 100, 130 Hz were used. Stimulation was delivered in 1 s 
stimulation epochs separated by 1 s rest epochs. For the pharmacological experiments, 0.5 μl 
of CNQX solutions in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with concentrations 0.01 mM, 0.05 
mM, and 0.1 mM were injected using Nano Fil Syringe and UMP-3 micropump at a speed 
of 100 nl/min. Following recording, electrophysiological signal was digitized with 50 kHz 
sampling frequency and filtered in the frequency range 0.3–5 kHz. Spiking activity was 
detected using commercially available Offline Sorter software (Plexon) with a dead time of 
1 ms. Following sorting, spikes were clustered in the first and second principal components 
(PC1-PC2) plane using k-means clustering, and L-ratios for each cluster were calculated 
using the same software. L-ratio < 0.05 is considered characteristic of well-isolated 
clusteres40. Interspike intervals (ISI) were computed for every neuron, and histograms were

 plotted by binning the intervals at 40 ms. Firing frequencies were calculated for each neuron 
by averaging the inverse values of ISIs.
Immunohistochemistry analyses of c-fos expression and foreign-body response
For c-fos quantification, mice transfected with AAV5-CaMKIIα::hChR2(H134R)-eYFP and 
AAV5-CamKIIα::eYFP were stimulated with 473 nm laser light (16 mW/mm2, 20 Hz, 5 ms 
pulse width) for 3 minutes (1 s ON/OF epochs) and then kept in their home cages for 90 
minutes to allow for c-fos expression. Mice were anesthetized via IP injection of Fatal Plus 
solution (100 mg/kg in saline), and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) 
in PBS. Brains were extracted and fixed in 4% PFA overnight, and then equilibrated in 30% 
sucrose in PBS. Samples were randomly allocated within each experimental group. The 
fixed brains were then sliced into 50 μm coronal sections using a vibrating blade microtome 
(Leica VT1000S). Sections were then permeabilized and blocked in 0.3% (vol/vol) Triton 
X-100 and 2.5% (vol/vol) goat serum in PBS for 1 hr. This was followed by a 20 hr 
incubation at 4 °C in a solution of primary antibodies (rabbit anti-c-fos41 1:500, 
Calbiochem, PC05) and 2.5% goat serum in PBS. Following incubation, the sections were 
washed 3 times for 30 min each with PBS. The slices were then incubated with secondary 
antibodies (Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-rabbit 1:500, Life Technologies) for 2 hours at room 
temperature. Following 3 more washes with PBS, sections were incubated with a nuclear 
stain DAPI (4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (1:50,000) for 30 min, and washed one more 
time. PVA-Dabco (Sigma) was used for mounting of slices onto glass microscope slides. A 
laser scanning confocal microscope (Fluoview FV1000, Olympus) with 4X (air, NA= 0.16), 
20X (oil, NA = 0.85), and 60X (oil, NA = 1.42) objectives was used for image acquisition, 
and overview mosaic images were generated by FV1000 software (Olympus). ImageJ was 
used to quantify the number of c-fos positive cells in serial z-stack images with a depth of 10 
μm. All imaging and analysis was blinded with respect to the experimental conditions. 
Long-term tissue responses to multimodal fiber probes and similarly sized stainless steel 
microwires (Good Fellow) were compared at 3 days, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. Fiber-
probes and microwires were implanted to the mPFC region (1.7 AP; ±0.4 ML; −1.8 DV) of 
wild type mice (n = 8 per time point, 32 animals, each implanted with 1 fiber probe and 1 
microwire). Perfusion, staining, and mounting procedures were identical to those described 
above with the exception of antibodies employed. The primary antibodies were used in the 
following concentrations: Goat anti-GFAP42 1:1000 (Abcam, ab53554); goat anti-Iba143 
1:500 (Abcam, ab107159); rabbit anti-CD6844 1:250 (Abcam, ab125212); donkey anti-
mouse-IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 56845 1:1000 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A10037). 
Secondary antibodies were used in the following concentrations: donkey anti-goat labeled 
with Alexa Fluor 488 1:1000 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A11055); or donkey anti-rabbit 
labeled with Alex Flour 633 1:1000 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A21070). Confocal images 
were collected with an oil immersion 20X objective (NA = 0.85). Custom algorithm written 
in MATLAB (Mathworks) was used to quantify the fluorescence area corresponding to the 
presence of IgG, GFAP, Iba1, and ED146. 360 radial lines separated by 1° were distributed 
from the center of the areas formerly occupied by implants, and the pixel intensity values 
were found along each line. Two boundary points were determined as 1σ standard deviation 
above average, and total coverage area was calculated within a 2-D outline of all end points 
(720, 2 per line).

 Behavioral assays
Behavioral tests were performed by an investigator with knowledge of the identity of the 
experimental groups versus control groups. For each test, every implanted mouse was 
randomly allocated to an experimental group before a behavioral experiment. Open field 
tests (OFT) were conducted with wild type mice receiving optical stimulation coinciding 
with viral injection in the mPFC (AAV5-CaMKIIα::hChR2(H134R)-eYFP or AAV5-
CaMKIIα::eYFP controls) as well as with wild type mice receiving optical stimulation in 
the mPFC or in the vHPC with the viruses delivered into the BLA (all implantations and 
injections are unilateral). For optical stimulation (λ = 473 nm, ~30 mW/mm2 at the tip of 
the fiber, 20 Hz, 5 ms pulse width) was delivered through the fiber probes connected via 
ferrules to silica patch cords coupled to a DPSS laser (Laserglow Technologies). The 50 × 
50 cm2 open field chamber made of white plastic was virtually divided into the “center” (25 
× 25 cm2) and “periphery” fields. Mice in their home cages were brought into the room 2 
hours prior to starting the experiments. Prior to starting the OFT, mice were placed in the 
center of the open field for 10 minutes to recover from handling stress. For in vivo 
pharmacological experiments, 0.5 μl of CNQX solution in PBS (0.1 mM) was injected via a 
fiber probe implanted in vHPC. OFT sessions consisted of three 3-minute epochs (OFF-ON-
OFF stimulation, 9 min total), and all trials were recorded by a video camera. All 
experiments were conducted in the dark, under red light (intensity <10 lux, 650 nm 
wavelength) to minimize baseline stress associated with background lighting. EthoVision 
XT (Noldus) software was used for tracking of mouse position, and the location, distance 
traveled, speed, time spent in each region of the open field were calculated from the tracking 
data.
Statistical Analysis
MATLAB (Mathworks) software was used for assessing the statistical significance of all 
comparison studies in this work. For fiber characterization experiments, group sizes were 
determined by power analysis using the sampsizepwr function as implemented in the 
statistical toolbox (α = 0.05, power = 0.9). Power analyses for predetermining sample sizes 
of immunohistochemistry and behavior test were not performed, instead the group sizes 
were chosen on the basis of previous research conducted in the same brain region or 
circuit27, 30. This was done to enable direct comparison of the observations with the prior 
work. For all parametric tests, data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not 
formally tested. In the statistical analysis for the characterization of impedance and light 
transmission, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc comparison test were 
conducted with thresholds of *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. For the comparison 
between two groups in immunohistochemistry analyses and behavior assays, one-sided 
Student’s t-tests were used, and significance threshold was placed at *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. 
All error bars and shaded areas in the graphs represent standard deviation.

 microscope images of a coronal section containing vHPC 6 weeks after viral transfection in 
the BLA. (g, h) Higher magnification images of CA2 and CA3 areas of vHPC. Scale bars 
are (f) 500 μm and (g, h) 150 μm, respectively. Blue: DAPI, green: eYFP. (i) 
Electrophysiological recording in the BLA during optical stimulation (10 Hz, 8.6 mW/mm2, 
5 ms pulse width) using a multifunctional fiber performed between 2 and 21 days following 
transfection with AAV5-CaMKIIα::ChR2-eYFP. Optically evoked potentials were observed 
11±2 days (orange box, n=8 mice) following surgery. (j,k) Electrophysiological recordings 
during optical stimulation using multifunctional fibers implanted in the mPFC (j) and vHPC 
(k) between 2 and 21 days after viral transfection using fiber probes implanted in the BLA. 
Primary low-latency optically evoked potentials were observed following 12±1.4 days 
(orange box, n=8 mice) for mPFC (j) and following 11±2 days (orange box, n=8 mice) for 
vHPC (k). (j) For mPFC, secondary long-latency evoked potentials were recorded 15±2 days 
(green box, n=6 mice) after the surgery. (l–o) OFT experiments performed in mice 
implanted with multifunctional fiber probes in vHPC and BLA. 9-min OFT consisted of 
three 3-min epochs, OFF/ON/OFF optical stimulation (5 ms, 16 mW/mm2, 20 Hz) in the 
vHPC. (l, m) Representative heatmap images tracing the position of a mouse transfected 
with ChR2 during (l) ON and (m) OFF optical stimulation epochs. (n) Time spent in the 
center of the open field for WT mice transfected in the BLA with ChR2-eYFP or eYFP 
alone in the absence or presence of optical stimulation in the vHPC. OFF_pre: p = 0.5957, t 
= 0.543, ON: p = 0.012, t = −2.8833, OFF_post: p = 0.7947, t = −0.2653. d.f. = 14 for all. 
(o) OFT identical to the one in (l–n) performed following delivery of synaptic blocker 
CNQX (0.1 mM, 0.5 μl) through a fiber probe implanted in vHPC. OFF_pre: p = 0.328, t = 
1.0135, ON: p = 0.2319, t = 1.2497, OFF_post: p = 0.824, t = −0.2266. d.f. = 14 for all. 
Shaded areas represent standard deviation (Number of animals n=8, *p < 0.05; one way 
student’s t-test).

 Figure 4. Investigation of single-unit potential with recorded signal from multimodal fiber device
(a–d) Tracking of isolated single neuron (unit) action potentials (spikes) recorded with a 
with multifunctional fiber probe in mPFC over a period of 12 weeks following implantation. 
(a) Clusters revealed by principle component analysis (PCA) of isolated action potentials. 
(b) Average spike waveforms recorded between 1 and 12 weeks corresponding to clusters in 
(a). (c) Interspike interval (ISI) histograms for isolated neurons 1 and 2 from (a,b). 
Maximum histogram interval = 1000 ms and bin size = 40 ms. (d) Average firing 
frequencies for neurons 1 and 2 obtained from ISI histograms. Significant difference 
confirmed by one-way student’s t-test (p < 0.001, t = 18.7798, d.f. = 8). Error bars represent 
standard deviation (Number of samples n=5). (e–g) Electrophysiological recording of 
optically evoked potentials in the mPFC of WT mice transfected with AAV5-
CaMKIIα::ChR2-eYFP performed (e) 1 month, (f) 2 months, and (g) 3 months after the 
one-step implantation and transfection surgery. Optical stimulation parameters were fixed at 
5 ms pulse width, frequency of 10 Hz and power density 4.3 mW/mm2.

 Figure 5. Evaluation of fiber probe and steel microwire biocompatibility using 
immunohistochemistry in coronal slices
(a, b) Representative confocal images of glial scarring and blood brain barrier breach 
surrounding (a) a 200 μm multifunctional fiber probe and (b) a 125 μm stainless steel 
microwire 1 month after implantation. Scale bar = 100 μm. (c–f) Average fluorescent 
intensity quantifying the presence of (c) Iba1, (d) ED1, (e) GFAP, and (f) IgG for fiber 
probes and microwires 3 days (3D), 2 weeks (2W), 1 month (1M), and 3 months (3M)
