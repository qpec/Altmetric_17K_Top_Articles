Background and objectives: Effects of maternal and paternal age on offspring autism and schizophrenia
risks have been studied for over three decades, but inconsistent risks have often been found, precluding
well-informed speculation on why these age-related risks might exist.
Methodology: To help clarify this situation we analysed a massive single population sample from
Denmark including the full spectrum of autistic and schizophrenic disorders (eliminating between-study
confounding), used up to 30 follow-up years, controlled for over 20 potentially confounding factors and
interpret the ultimate causation of the observed risk patterns using generally accepted principles of
parent-offspring conflict and life-history theory.
Results: We evaluated the effects of paternal age, maternal age and parental age difference on offspring
mental disorders and found consistently similar risk patterns for related disorders and markedly differ-
ent patterns between autistic and schizophrenic disorders. Older fathers and mothers both conferred
increased risk for autistic but not schizophrenic disorders, but autism risk was reduced in younger
parents and offspring of younger mothers had increased risk for many schizophrenic disorders. Risk for
most disorders also increased when parents were more dissimilarly aged. Monotonically increasing
autism risk is consistent with mutation accumulation as fathers’ age, but this explanation is invalid for
schizophrenic disorders, which were not related to paternal age and were negatively correlated with
maternal age.
Conclusions and implications: We propose that the observed maternally induced risk patterns ultimately
reflect a shifting ancestral life-history trade-off between current and future reproduction, mediated by an

INTRODUCTION
Since the first single-disorder surveys that dis-
covered an association between risk of autism or
schizophrenia and advancing maternal or paternal
age over 30 years ago [1, 2], there have been numer-
ous studies that have attempted to confirm this pat-
tern, including several very recent ones [3–6].
Despite this substantial effort, risk patterns for the
same disorders have been found to be highly
variable and results often remain incomparable
due to substantial differences in study design
(Supplementary Table S1). For example, McGrath
et al. [6] found that risk of childhood autism
was significantly higher in offspring born to younger
mothers, Parner et al. [7] and Shelton et al. [8]
found risk significantly higher in older mothers,
while other studies show U-shaped risk patterns
[3, 5]. For paternal age, McGrath et al. [6] and
others [3, 7] found that autism (or autism-spectrum
disorder) risk was significantly higher for off-
spring born to older fathers, while Lampi et al. [5]
and Lundstrom et al. [9] found significant U-shaped
risk patterns.
Results of schizophrenia research show similar
variability (Supplementary Table S1). For maternal
age, studies show younger [6, 10], older [4] or both
age extremes [11] contributing risk, and studies of
paternal age implicate older [6, 10] or both younger
and older [11–13] fathers as risk factors. It is likely
that these between-study differences reflect artifac-
tual variation in study design, for example due to
massive differences in sample size, statistical
power, follow-up time, covariates adjusted for, and
time periods over which populations were con-
sidered. For example, Rasmussen [14] used 22–29
years of follow-up from birth while McGrath et al. [6]
used 5–19 years, which will only capture a small per-
centage of total schizophrenia incidence because
diagnoses typically occur between adolescence (ca.
20 years) and middle age with a second peak for
women between ca. 45–80 years [15]. Also sample
sizes have varied widely, ranging from a few hundred
[10,
16]
to
well
over
a
million
[7,
8]
(see
Supplementary Table S1 for details). It therefore
remains critical to clarify what the true effects of par-
ental age on autism and schizophrenia risk are to
enable better understanding of their aetiology, puta-
tive evolutionary explanation, and relevance for clin-
ical risk management.
Recent meta-analyses have attempted to reduce
outcome variability by combining coefficients from
different studies in order to distil overall risk pat-
terns, including paternal age and autism [17], or
schizophrenia [12], and maternal age and autism
[18]. However, this approach is limited by the quality
or variation of input coefficients that may already be
biased, for example by differences in detection
capabilities and diagnostic criteria by country and
cultural differences in the ages parents typically
have babies. Despite inconsistent risk patterns for
both autism and schizophrenia, the popular inter-
pretation that de novo mutations in sperm are likely
responsible for the increased risk seen in offspring
of older fathers has garnered considerable mass
media attention (e.g. [19]). While mutations accu-
mulate linearly in sperm with age, this correlation
does not confirm a direct genotype–phenotype link
between these mutations and autism and schizo-
phrenia. This inference is also premature given that
some studies show the youngest fathers may have
offspring with higher psychiatric disorder risks [12]
and that the effects of both parents being older (vs
only one being older) may not be cumulative [7].
A recent study also showed that maternal germline
mutations do accumulate albeit at a lower rate and
non-linearly [20], and it has also been argued that
risks are primarily determined by parental age at
first reproduction [21] and parity [4] rather than by
parental age as such. These complexities imply that
large-scale longitudinal studies comparing psychi-
atric disorder risks within a single population are
required to partial out important confounding
effects.
The need for large-scale rigorous studies is also
evident from most studies only accounting for three
to seven covariates (Supplementary Table S1) such
as
parity,
gender,
family
history
and
some
socioeconomic factors. This leaves unexplored
age-correlated (and potentially causal) effects such

 as maternal hypertension and diabetes, pregnancy
complications such as previous spontaneous or
induced
abortions,
maternal
bleeding
during
pregnancy, foetal oxygen deprivation, gestational
diabetes, pregnancy oedema, and gestational hyper-
tension. Also any effects of age-difference between
partners can only be handled in large data sets. For
example, in studies where older fathers and mothers
both independently contribute risk to autism [7, 8] it
is valid to ask whether risk is ameliorated when one
parent is much younger, but there are only a few
studies that have examined this, and only for autism
[7, 8, 22]. Durkin et al. [22] found risk tended to be
highest when both parents were older compared
with when one or both were younger, but Parner et
al. [7] found no compounding effect and Shelton et
al. [8] found that risks were highest when older
fathers (>40 years) reproduced with younger
mothers (<30 years).
While proximate explanations for mental disorders
(e.g. mutation accumulation in sperm, obstetric
complications in mothers) seem straightforward to
conceptualize, we are still a long way from understand-
ing why variation in parental age should affect off-
spring psychiatric disorder risk, i.e. grasping how any
such effects may have been maintained in human
populations that respond to natural selection. Over
recent years, several branches of evolutionary theory
have yielded useful paradigms that can fruitfully be
applied to such ultimate questions of human repro-
ductive and mental health.
First, parent-offspring conflict (POC) theory de-
veloped by Trivers [23] predicts that maternal life-
time reproductive success is normally best served
by provisioning current and future offspring equally,
while each offspring has been under selection to se-
cure more resources to self than to potential future
siblings. This well-known conflict is driven by focal
offspring being 100% related to self and 50% to fu-
ture siblings when parents remain monogamous for
life. Thus, offspring resource interests that diverge
from the mother’s optimum are naturally driven to
do so by relatedness asymmetries [24] because off-
spring inherit only half of their genome from the
mother. When there is multiple paternity so future
offspring will have some likelihood of being half-
siblings, paternally inherited genes in offspring
should favour even higher maternal resource acqui-
sition relative to maternally inherited genes in
offspring.
The related Parental-Conflict (PC) theory subse-
quently developed by Haig [25] addresses maternal-
foetal conflict over resources during pregnancy,
mediated by ‘matrigenic’ and ‘patrigenic’ influences
(terms coined by Queller [26]) on placental and foetal
physiology. These effects emanate from differential ex-
pression of genes with parent-of-origin genomic im-
prints and/or copy-number variation (Haig [27] refers
totheseeffectsas‘madumnal’and‘padumnal’genes).
Such patrigenic effects achieve higher fitness when
they improve offspring growth and survival beyond
the
maternal
optimum
and
will
tend
to
be
compensated by matrigenic effects that are growth re-
stricting [28]. PC theory was recently used to propose
the Imprinted Brain (IB) theory [29] hypothesizing that
these matrigenic/patrigenic conflicts have extended
postnatal effects when they manipulate parental and
particularly maternal investment until weaning. Here,
genes with parent-of-origin effects are expected to be
expressed in the offspring brain and to induce
higher or lower demands for resources. Patrigenic
and matrigenic effects normally balance to give
average (normal) cognition, but deviations are ex-
pected to increase risks of mental disorders in spe-
cific directions such that matrigenic bias gives
higher schizophrenia and lower autism risks,
whereas patrigenic bias gives higher autism and
lower schizophrenia risks. There is some correl-
ational genetic [29, 30] and more extensive pheno-
typic support [31–34] for IB theory.
Second, Life History (LH) theory characterizes
trade-offs between current and future reproduction
during the typical life course of parents—particularly
the mother [35, 36], and provides a more general
cost-benefit context for POC, PC and IB theory [27,
37]. LH theory predicts that the intensity of conflict
should decrease with increasing maternal age be-
cause her reproductive value—the likelihood of
raising any future offspring towards independence
after a focal pregnancy—declines rather steeply with
age [23]. We thus expect higher than average re-
straints for mothers to invest in offspring provision-
ing during early pregnancies graduating into above
average provisioning in later pregnancies as the like-
lihood of future offspring declines towards zero
when she approaches menopause [e.g. 36, 38, 39].
Thispredictable gradient inthe life of every woman is
expected to have selected for tighter control of
patrigenic pressure during early pregnancies and
their associated postnatal offspring behaviour and
for a gradual relaxation of this control in later
pregnancies, giving more leeway to patrigenically
mediated interests. Thus, combining insights from
IB [40] and LH theories allows the prediction that the

 balance between infant risk profiles for autism and
schizophrenia shifts from schizophrenia-biased to
autism-biased across the time window that women
typically reproduce, and that these effects could be
reinforced or ameliorated by paternal age.
No study has formally conceptualized and tested
the validity of these inferences, which follow directly
from the classic distinction that female reproductive
success is normally limited by access to resources
whereas male reproductive success is limited by ac-
cess to females [41]. Moreover, no previous study has
simultaneously tested and compared parental age ef-
fects on autism- and schizophrenia-spectrum condi-
tions in the same population. As we had access to 30
years of national public health data in Denmark, we
designed the present study to rigorously assess the
effects of both parents’ age, their age difference, and
more than 20 covariates broadly across all autistic and
schizophrenic disorders. Our objectives were to inter-
pret the results in both proximate (mechanistic) and
ultimate (evolutionary) terms to further general under-
standing of what risks of specific mental disorders
(co)vary with parental age, or not, and whether risks
that can be unambiguously documented are consist-
ent with explanations from evolutionary theory, or not.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We compared risk patterns between autistic, schizo-
phrenic and related disorders based on deviations
from average maternal, paternal and parental age
differences. We used Cox regression (proportional
hazards) to model the risk of psychiatric disorders as
a function of parental age and all available covariates
to account for environmental and familial effects on
these disorders. To correct for multiple testing (i.e.
regressions run for each of the ten mental disorder
groups
described
below),
all
P-values
were
Bonferroni corrected (� = 0.05/10 = 0.005).
Parental age variables categorically defined
Maternal age, paternal age and parental age difference
variables were classified categorically into seven
groups (including a mean reference group). Size of
age breaks for maternal, paternal or age difference
groups were each approximated using standard devi-
ations from their means, i.e. groups 3–4 approximate
ages up to 1 standard deviation of the mean for each
variable. Each group was coded as a binary variable
that represented whether ages fell below (groups 1–
3) or above (groups 4–6) the mean (Supplementary
TableS2):group1(fathers16–20years,mothers15–21
years; mothers 8–14 years older than fathers); group 2
(fathers 21–25 years,mothers22–24 years; mothers4–
7 years older); group 3 (fathers 26–30 years, mothers
25–28 years; mothers 1–3 years older); central group
(fathers 31–34 years, mothers 29–31 years; fathers 0–6
years older than mothers); group 4 (fathers 35–39
years, mothers 32–34 years; fathers 7–10 years older);
group 5 (fathers 40–44 years, mothers 35–38 years;
fathers 11–15 years older); group 6 (fathers 45–60
years, mothers 39–46 years; fathers 16–27 years older).
Study population
We identified all singleton live births (n = 1 787 447)
between January 1978 and January 2009 in the
Danish Fertility Database, which contains identifi-
cation of parents and other birth-related informa-
tion.
We
used
unique

numbers (de-identified from central-person regis-
ter numbers) to link individual’s information be-
tween different registries including the Danish
National Patient Registry holding nationwide hos-
pital admission data since 1977, the Danish
Psychiatric Central Register with diagnoses for all
psychiatric inpatient admissions since 1969, the
Danish Civil Registration System and the Danish
Cause of Death Registry containing date of death,
migration, and socioeconomic status. The sample
of singleton births was reduced from 1 787 447 to 1
740 269 due to missing values for either parents’ age
(n = 29 538), parity (n = 69), APGAR5 score (n = 10

values <1850 and >5400 g (n = 1624); extreme pa-
ternal (<16 and >60, n = 852) and maternal age
(<15 and >46, n = 181) values; and very short ges-
tation (<30 weeks, n = 4215). The final sample
included 1 646 092 offspring that were never
diagnosed with a mental disorder during the study
period while 94 177 (5.41%) were diagnosed within
one of the autistic or schizophrenic disorder groups
defined below (Supplementary Table S2).
Defining autistic and schizophrenic disorder
groups
As per a previous study [31], we included a range of
narrow to broad autistic and schizophrenic disorder
groups (ICD codes, Supplementary Table S3).
Including arange of related disorders helps compare
and validate the risk patterns found. Broader groups

 sizes while narrower groups help improve resolution
on specific diagnoses more commonly given in a
clinical setting. Narrow to broad autistic (and
related) disorder groups included: (i) infantile aut-
ism; (ii) infantile and atypical autism; (iii) autism-
spectrum disorders that covered autism (infantile
and atypical), Asperger’s syndrome, pervasive devel-
opmental disorder not otherwise specified; (iv)
disorders
of
psychological
development;
(v)
behavioural and emotional disorders with onset in
childhood and adolescence. Narrow to broad
schizophrenic
(and
related)
disorder
groups
included: (i) bipolar disorder; (ii) major depression;
(iii) schizophrenia; (iv) schizophrenia-spectrum dis-
orders that included schizophrenia, bipolar dis-
order, and major depression; (v) schizophrenia,
schizotypal and delusional disorders. For details
on sources and validation of mental illness, see
Supplementary Methods and Results.
Covariates included in the analyses
Covariates came from diagnoses and measures ob-
tained from the Danish birth, psychiatric, person and
household registries across 1978–2009. These were
included as predictor variables in Cox regressions
and helped to partial out potential confounding effects
on mental disorder variation. They capture important
heritable, pregnancy, birth and socioeconomic effects
known to modify (mental) disorder risk including: bin-
ary variables for maternal pre-existing conditions (see
Supplementary Table S4 for ICD codes) including pre-
existing hypertension (primary or secondary hyperten-
sion, hypertensive heart or renal disease), pre-existing
diabetes (i.e. type-I or type-II, malnutrition-related,
other or unspecified), previous spontaneous or
induced abortions; maternal pregnancy-related or
induced (Supplementary Table S4) variables including
gestation length (in weeks) and binary variables for
presence of gestational diabetes, gestational hyperten-
sion
(i.e.
pregnancy-induced
hypertension,
preeclampsia, eclampsia), bleeding (i.e. haemorrhage,
placenta praevia), foetal oxygen deprivation (i.e. hyp-
oxia, asphyxia), pregnancy oedema; parental variables

and 2008 accounting for changes in diagnostic criteria

a child had resided for the longest period to account
for possible regional differences in diagnoses. We also
ran analyses including total years of education and
average income for mothers and fathers separately,
but this made no difference to the main parental age
predictors, quite likely because education in Denmark
is free for all residents.
RESULTS
Advanced parental age at birth
Above-average paternal and maternal ages were con-
sistentlyassociatedwithincreasedriskofmostautistic
(and related) disorders in offspring (Fig. 1A and B).
This effect was magnified in offspring of very old
fathers and mothers as risk continued to increase in
age groups further from the reference (central) group.
For example, across the three older paternal age
groups (groups 4–6 or ages 35–60) relative risks for
allfiveautisticdisordersinoffspringwereelevatedwith
12 out of those 15 coefficients significantly increased
relative to the reference group (5–52% increased risk,
Fig. 1B, Supplementary Tables S5–S9).
Trends for the five autistic disorders were also
largely consistent across the three older maternal
age groups (groups 4–6 or ages 32–46), with
elevated relative risk for 13 out of 15 coefficients (8
of these were significant, 7–34% increased risk,
Fig. 1A, Supplementary Tables S5–S9). However,
neither advanced maternal nor paternal ages were
associated with significantly modified risk of any
schizophrenic disorder groups (Fig. 1D and E,
Supplementary Tables S10–S14).
Young parental age at birth
Below average paternal ages (groups 1–3, ages 16–
30) appeared to have a protective effect on autistic
disorder risk, with relative risk for four of these

 disorders consistently decreased. Risks continued
to decrease the further away from the central group,
with some offspring disorders displaying large sig-
nificant effects (e.g. 14–57% decreased risk for in-
fantile autism, 10–50% decreased risk for autism in
offspring
of
the
youngest
fathers)
(Fig.
1B,
Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). This protective
effect for autism was also largely consistent in off-
spring born to younger mothers (groups 1–3, ages
15–28). For example, risk was significantly reduced
by 15–23% for infantile autism, and by 7–17% for
autism-spectrum disorders (Fig. 1A, Supplementary
Tables S5 and S7). While below average maternal
and paternal ages were both protective for autism,
this effect was more pronounced in younger paternal
age groups. The only exception was behavioural and
emotional disorders, which showed increased rela-
tive risk in below-average paternal and maternal age
groups (Fig. 1A and B). This may be due to this dis-
order being more distantly related to the other aut-
istic-related disorders (see psychiatric diagnostic
structure, Supplementary Fig. S1 in Byars et al.
[31]), i.e. it captures disorders with specific onset
in childhood and adolescence, but does not include
the core phenotypes of autism.
Patterns of risk for the five schizophrenic disorders
in offspring born within the three younger than aver-
age maternal age groups (i.e. groups 1–3 or ages 15–
28) were consistently increased with all risk ratios
above 1.0, and 8 out of those 15 coefficients being
significant for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders,
schizophrenia, major depression and schizophre-
nia-schizotypal and delusional disorders (Fig. 1D).
However, risk for the five schizophrenic disorders in
offspring were largely unaffected across the three
younger than average paternal age groups (i.e.
groups 1–3 or ages 16–30), with only 2 (of 15) risk
ratios marginally significantly increased (i.e. ages 21–
25: P-value= 0.04 for schizophrenia-spectrum dis-
orders; P-value= 0.02 for major depression) (Fig. 1E).
Parental age difference
As well as investigating age of both parents, the par-
ental age difference variable allowed us to separate
dissimilar parental ages at birth, with values on the
left side of the distribution corresponding to younger
fathers reproducingwitholdermothersand values on
the right related to younger’s mothers reproducing
with older fathers (Fig. 1C and F). Overall, autistic
and schizophrenic risk in offspring was lowest for
more similarly aged parents. Risk for autism was
higher towards the distribution edges, with risk on
the right side(i.e. groups 4–6, fathers aged7–27 years
older than mothers) consistently more significant
than the left (i.e. groups 1–3, mothers aged 1–14

Figure 1. Risk of offspring psychiatric disorders by parental age. Plots are divided by autistic (A–C) versus schizophrenic (D–F) disorders and by maternal age (A,
D), paternal age (B, E) and parental age difference (C, F) at birth. Dashed horizontal lines (RR = 1.0) indicate zero risk. For parental age difference plots, groups left
of centre represent mothers 1–3, 4–7 or 8–14 years older than their reproductive partners at childbirth. Groups to the right are fathers 7–10, 11–15 or 16–27 years
older than their reproductive partners. Dark-grey dots mark risk P-values <0.05. All P-values were Bonferroni-corrected before further interpretation. Key provides

 years older thanfathers),especiallyatthe distribution
extremes (groups 1 and 6, Fig. 1C). Schizophrenia
risk was also largely U-shaped, with risk for most dis-
orders
increasing
as
parental
age
differences
increased (Fig. 1F). This was similar on both sides
for the five schizophrenic disorders, with 7 out of 15
risk ratios significantly increased in the three age-dif-
ference groups on the right (i.e. groups 4–6, fathers
aged 7–27 years older than mothers) and 9 out of 15
significantly increased for the three age-difference
groups on the left (i.e. groups 1–3, mothers aged 1–
14 years older than fathers).
Risk patterns for covariates
Offspring
risk
of
many
psychiatric
disorders
increased if mothers or fathers had the same dis-
order, if there were diabetes or hypertension compli-
cations during pregnancy, previous abortions, and if
offspring were born more recently. Risks were often
decreased if babies were born closer to term, had
birth weights closer to the mean and higher
APGAR5 scores. Our earlier study [31] provides an
extensive analysis of birth size effects on risks of
autistic and schizophrenic disorders later in life, so
we will not report on these differences in any detail
here. As we found previously, in our current analyses
the risk of autistic disorders was generally higher in
sons and the risk of schizophrenic disorders gener-
ally higher in daughters. Overall, just over half of the
22 covariates were highly significant (P < 0.001)
across all 10 analyses (Supplementary Tables
S5–S14) highlighting the importance of accounting
for these effects. For further discussion of these
covariate effects, see Supplementary Methods and
Results and our previous study [31]. To quantify po-
tential maternal age-related effects on foetal provi-
sioning, we obtained post hoc correlations between
maternal age and offspring birth statistics. Most size
and health (APGAR5) variables at birth were posi-
tively and significantly correlated with maternal age,
but the variation directly explained by maternal age
was minor given the small Pearson correlation coef-
ficients (Supplementary Table S15).
DISCUSSION
Risk patterns for autism–maternal age appears
to matter
Ourresultslendsupporttomanypreviousstudies(see
metanalyses, [17, 18]) that have indicated that above-
average paternal and maternal ages are independently
linked to increased risk of autism in their offspring.
This effect has recently been discussed in relation to
increasing mutational load in sperm of older fathers
[42], a pattern that may correlate with mental disorder
prevalence [19], although it is still being debated
whether these mutations contribute directly to altered
neurodevelopmental phenotypes [4]. Visually, the
changeinautisticriskacrossthefullpaternalagerange
(Fig. 1B) appeared to be roughly monotonic, consist-
ent with a proximate mechanism such as mutational
load that accumulates steadily over time [42].
This type of explanation is harder to maintain for
older mothers, although age-related novel muta-
tional events [20, 43, 44], epigenetic changes [18,
45] or other factors might plausibly be involved [18,
46]. Considering that our analyses adjusted for both
parents’ ages and that effects from our parental age
difference
variable
also
supported
that
older
mothers confer increased risk of autism on their off-
spring,
this
effect
appears
to
be
important.
Supporting this, a recent study showed that the fre-
quency of aneuploidy (which is linked to autism risk
[47]) increases considerably in older mothers [48].
A more specific focus on maternal age risk factors
is therefore needed, especially considering that
most studies have focused on interpreting autism
risk from a paternal perspective only.
No effect of advanced paternal or maternal age
on schizophrenia risk
Our results were consistent with two recent studies
that also found no effect of advanced parental age on
risk of schizophrenia [6, 10]. This contrasts with
studies that have found schizophrenia risk in off-
spring to be associated with above-average paternal
[11, 12, 49–55] or maternal age [11, 51, 53]. However,
many of these studies had relatively low sample
sizes and controlled for few confounding effects
(e.g. [49, 56, 57]). Such design limitations are likely
to introduce power issues or errors in reliably detect-
ing similarities or differences in risk between age
groups. Large differences in key design features
and
risk
trends
compared
across
studies
in
Supplementary Table S1 indicate that the impres-
sion of consistency across studies conveyed by
some previous studies is misleading.
When interpreting results across studies, it is also
important to note that schizophrenia is inherently
more difficult to study than autism given that it is
detected much later, from around age 18 onwards.

 In particular for women, detection may not occur
until after 40 years of age [15] implying that many
studies with less follow-up time will miss many rele-
vant diagnoses. Indeed, large variation in follow-up
time among studies exists (Supplementary Table
S1) ranging from 15 to 38 years from birth. In our
study, we had up to 30 years of follow-up, which
should allow detection of enough cases for reliable
risk estimation due to our very large sample sizes,
but we are likely still missing a substantial number of
late-onset
schizophrenia cases in the Danish
population.
Increased schizophrenia risk due to younger
maternal ages
Younger mothers conferring schizophrenia risk to
their offspring has been found previously although
results have often not been clear within or consistent
between studies. For example Byrne et al. [11] found
mothers aged <20 conferred higher schizophrenia
risk, although this effect disappeared in adjusted
models. Frans et al. [51] found no effect of maternal
ages <20 on risk of bipolar disorder, Malaspina et al.
[52] found no effect of maternal ages below 20 on
schizophrenia, and Wu et al. [10] found increased
risk of schizophrenia in offspring of mothers <25
years of age.
More recently and with a large sample size,
McGrath et al. [6] found that younger mothers aged
12–19 and 20–24 conferred significantly increased
risk for schizophrenia, schizophrenia and related
disorders, mood disorder, bipolar disorder, simi-
lar to the results of our present study. We found
increased risk for schizophrenia, schizophrenia-
spectrum, major depression and schizophrenia-
schizotypal-delusional
disorders
in
younger
maternal age groups 15–21 and 22–24 years, but
risks did not change monotonically across the entire
age range (compared with autism) (Fig. 1D),
suggesting that psychosocial, cultural or resource-
mediated factors might also be involved. For
example, effects of early maternal age at birth on
offspring schizophrenia risk have been linked to so-
cial and environmental stress factors that may be
more common in earlier reproducing families [58].
Higher risks in offspring of dissimilarly aged
parents
Previously, only Croen et al. [59] examined the effect
of parental age differences in autism-spectrum
disorders with a variable that modelled large, mod-
erate or small absolute differences in parental age.
While they found no significant differences after ad-
justing for seven covariates, we cannot directly com-
pare their results to ours as their variable did not
separate parental age differences in both directions
(i.e. younger mothers and older fathers and vice
versa). In another study, Buizer-Voskamp et al. [50]
adjusted for the age difference between parents, but
did not report those results.
Our study shows that autistic and schizophrenic
disorder risks tend to be higher, in more dissimilarly
aged parents, relative to parents with the most simi-
lar ages. However, autism risk plateaus towards the
extreme parental age differences, i.e. between par-
ental age difference groups 5–6 (i.e. fathers 11–27
years older than mothers) and 1–2 (i.e. mothers
4–14 years older than fathers) (Fig. 1C). This sug-
gests that there may be protective effects for autism
conferred from younger maternal (i.e. 15–28 years)
and paternal (i.e. 16–30 years) age groups 1–3
(Fig. 1A and B) that neutralize the negative effects
of the older parent. This highlights the complexity of
psychiatric disorders when they are affected by
both parent’s age and their difference, amongst
many other factors within a single generation.
Nonetheless, our consistently significant results
for parental age difference suggests that this factor
needs to be accounted for in future studies of mental
disorder risks when data sets are large enough to
allow this.
Higher schizophrenic risks in offspring trend to
higher autistic risks as mothers age
The overall picture offered by Fig. 1A and B/D and E
is that schizophrenia risks are highest, when parents
(particularly mothers) are youngest, but these risks
appear to fade away towards the middle of the repro-
ductive period and start trending towards ever-larger
autistic disorder risks as mothers and their partners
age. This pattern can be interpreted using a combin-
ation of POC theory, PC theory and LH theory as
summarized in Introduction section. These concep-
tual frameworks coalesce in the recently developed
IB theory [29, 60, 61], which hypothesizes that aut-
ism and schizophrenia are the extremes of a single
perturbation gradient between paternal and mater-
nal reproductive interests. As described in the intro-
duction, POC and LH theory predict a gradient of
high to low resource conflict between mother and
offspring when her declining reproductive value

 weakens selection on maternal genes to withhold
resources from focal offspring as later offspring be-
come less likely. In support of this, older mothers
tend to give birth to larger babies [62], are more at-
tentive on average, have less conflict with their off-
spring [63], and see them grow up with fewer
hospital visits and better than average general health
and development [64]. Our data also revealed that
maternal age is significantly positively correlated
with
essentially
all
relevant
birth-size
traits
(Supplementary Table S15). Such differences in off-
spring quality (i.e. health, survival) as well as a stat-
istically decreasing rate of partner change with
women’s age [65–67] could all contribute to resource
allocation during and after pregnancy being less
constrained in older mothers.
The shifting risk patterns with maternal age sug-
gest there may be epigenetic maternal mechanisms
that control patri/matrigenic parent-of-origin effects
on foetal growth or offspring brain development.
This would be consistent with a recent study
showing that methylation levels, in particular for
functions related to neurological regulation in new-
borns were significantly associated with maternal
(and to a lesser extent paternal) age [68]. Also an-
other study showing that older maternal age is sig-
nificantly associated with reduced methylation of
specific CpG sites [69] may point in this direction.
These findings suggest that there are no substantial
constraints for the evolution of proximate mechan-
isms that allow maternal adjustment of patri/
matrigenic effects in offspring when there is selec-
tion for such regulation because it enhances mater-
nal life-time fitness. Substantial further work will be
needed to corroborate the functionality of these pu-
tative mechanisms. Age-specific maternal regula-
tion of offspring provisioning may well have been
adaptive in ancestral human populations where
mothers went though many pregnancies and grad-
ual relaxation of resistance to patrigenic pressure for
higher provisioning demands may have been appro-
priate as they progressed from first to final preg-
nancy. Too few generations have passed to expect
naturally selected ancestral life-history traits to have
disappeared in modern humans, so maternal age
appears to be a logical ultimate predictor of off-
spring risk of schizophrenia and autism, independ-
ently of birth weight [31].
Explanations of this kind are fundamentally differ-
ent from proximate factors such as mutation accu-
mulation in gametes or the presence of epigenetic
methylation mechanisms that can respond to
selection. Mutational load is much more likely for
sperm than for eggs given the vast difference in
number of cell divisions in testes and ovaries after
conception. For such proximate factors it is valid to
ask why natural selection has not removed part of
these liabilities in our ancestors and the simple an-
swer may be that older parents were never the norm
until very recently. This may also explain why
increased aneuploidy of eggs released by older
mothers has not been a significant risk factor earlier
in human history, whereas it may be now.
A graphical model to facilitate the evolutionary
interpretation of mental disorder risks
We have combined the theoretical expectations and
overall trends in our findings in a diagram (Fig. 2) to
express how mental disorder risks can be mapped
on maternal age at birth. We use the established
evolutionary concept of Fisherian reproductive value
[70], which is maximal shortly after menarche and
declines to zero just before menopause. We used
Fisher’s own diagram—constructed ca. a century
ago before the onset of modern birth control—that
is likely to be fairly representative for ancestral fe-
male fertility, with first child birth at �20 years old
and last child birth at just beyond 40 years old. In that
interval, reproductive value declines monotonically
such that median reproductive value was reached at
�30 years old, on average after the first three
pregnancies. This age represented the majority of
mothers from a typical breeding population—
experienced in child rearing and not yet affected by
senescence. If we assume that patrigenic and
matrigenic effects were optimally balanced in these
median-age pregnancies, LH theory would imply
that no maternal regulation is needed at this stage,
whereas younger mothers were selected to resist
patrigenic coercion by the foetus or placenta (de-
creasingly so from first to 3–4th pregnancy) and
older mothers to gradually comply with patrigenic
efforts for maximal investment in final pregnancies.
Against this background, we would then expect
offspring born to median-aged mothers to have aver-
age sizes at birth and minimal risks of any mental
disorders later in life. Extensions towards both sides
can then be represented by a pendulum with young
high-reproductive-value mothers on the left and old
low-reproductive-value mothers towards the right.
That pendulum then swings around a relative men-
tal disorder risk enhancement of zero in the middle,
with increasing risks of schizophrenia to the left and

 increasing autism risks to the right. Our previous
study [31] showed that birth sizes below and above
average
independently
predict
enhanced
and
reduced risks of either schizophrenia or autism as
indicated in the labels inserted in Fig. 2. Both that
study and our present one identified these risks to
also be modified by the sex of the offspring, as
indicated by the red and blue curves in Fig. 2, con-
sistent with the general mammalian pattern of
somewhat higher maternal investment in individual
sons than daughters [39, 71], which independently
contributes to the birth weight differences. These
inferences suggest that it would be useful to extend
the two previously identified predictive evolutionary
‘axes of cognition’ [29, 31], the sex of the foetus and
the extent of perturbation of the balance between
patri- and matrigenic effects, with a third maternal
age axis to arrive at a more complete conceptual
framework for understanding the ultimate causation
of the full spectrum of mental disorders.

theorem of natural selection [70], specifying that first births occurred at age �20 and last births normally at ages just beyond 40, and assuming that maternal
median age at birth was �30 years. (B) The shift from maximal schizophrenia risk and minimal autism risk in offspring born to young mothers on the left, via
minimal risk (zero when scaled relative to risk in offspring of median-aged mothers in the population) for any psychiatric disorder in offspring born to mothers of
median reproductive value, to maximal autism risk and minimal schizophrenia risk in offspring born to mothers approaching menopause on the right, based on
the overall patterns plotted in Fig. 1 and previously documented diametrically opposed risks of autism and schizophrenia dependent on size at birth [31].
Differences in risk related to offspring being daughters or sons ([29]; see Supplementary Tables S5–S14 for documentation) are likely to be minor compared to the
effects of maternal age-dependent patri/matrigenically induced provisioning biases and/or maternal genes whose expression is assumed to covary with age to
express initially high but gradually diminishing resistance to patrigenic coercion for higher offspring provisioning in the womb and after birth

 We realize that at this point in time Fig. 2 diagram
remains informed speculation even though it is
based on fairly strong inferences using established
evolutionary theory and consistently supported by
the public health data that we analyzed. It would
therefore be highly desirable that other large-scale
public health studies replicate our statistical ana-
lyses of the Danish public health data. In addition,
no evolutionary predictions or supportive correl-
ations will be fully credible until proximate mechan-
isms mediating the expression of parental and POCs
have been identified and functionally understood. As
we made explicit in our previous study [31], the
trends that we predicted and statistically docu-
mented are all additional to any directly causal her-
itable variants that enhance or reduce individual
risks of being diagnosed with autism- or schizophre-
nia-spectrum
disorders.
The
massive
ongoing
research effort to identify directly causal genetic
risk variants is thus unlikely to shed proximate light
on the relationships that we documented here.
The search for genetic mechanisms that may further
explain the trends that we documented are likely to
be found in conditionally expressed maternal genes
that differentially affect placental or foetal function-
ing, which represents an area of study that appears
to have barely begun [45, 68, 69].
