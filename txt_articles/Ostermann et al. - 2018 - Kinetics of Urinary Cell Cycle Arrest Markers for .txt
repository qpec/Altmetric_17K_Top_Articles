Objectives: Urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and 
insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 predict the develop-
ment of acute kidney injury following renal insults of varied aeti-
ology. To aid clinical interpretation, we describe the kinetics of 
biomarker elevations around an exposure.
Design: In an ancillary analysis of the multicenter SAPPHIRE 
study, we examined the kinetics of the urinary [tissue inhibitor of 
metalloproteinase-2]•[insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7] 
in association with exposure to common renal insults (major sur-
gery, IV radiocontrast, vancomycin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, and piperacillin/tazobactam).
Setting: Thirty-five sites in North America and Europe between 
September 2010 and June 2012.
Patients: Seven hundred twenty-three critically ill adult patients 
admitted to the ICU.
Interventions: None.
Measurements and Main Results: We compared the urinary [tis-
sue metalloproteinase-2]•[insulin growth factor binding protein 7] 
kinetics from the day prior to exposure up to 5 days after exposure 
in patients developing acute kidney injury stage 2–3, stage 1, or no 
acute kidney injury by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome 
criteria. Among the 723 patients, 679 (94%) had at least one, 70% 
had more than one, and 35% had three or more exposures to a 
known renal insult. There was a significant association between 
cumulative number of exposures up to study day 3 and risk of acute 
kidney injury (p = 0.02) but no association between the specific 
type of exposure and acute kidney injury (p = 0.22). With the excep-
tion of radiocontrast, patients who developed acute kidney injury 
stage 2–3 after one of the five exposures, had a clear rise and fall of

later. In patients without acute kidney injury, there was no significant 
elevation in urinary [tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2]•[insulin-
like growth factor binding protein 7].
Conclusions: Exposure to potential renal insults is common. In 
patients developing acute kidney injury stage 2–3, the kinetics 
of urinary [tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2]•[insulin-like 
growth factor binding protein 7] matched the exposure except in 
the case of radiocontrast. (Crit Care Med 2018; 46:375–383)
Key Words: acute kidney injury; biomarker; cell-cycle arrest 
markers; exposures; nephrotoxicity
A
cute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complica-
tion of critical illness, affecting 50–60% of patients 
admitted to the ICU (1–5). Both, identification of 
high risk patients and the early diagnosis of AKI are essential 
in order to implement renoprotective measures in a timely 
manner and to prevent harm (6). We have previously shown 
that the urinary biomarkers tissue inhibition of metallopro-
teinase-2 (TIMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor binding 
protein 7 (IGFBP7) predict the development of AKI second-
ary to a variety of renal insults, including surgery, sepsis, 
and medications (7–12). However, in order to better inter-
pret biomarker results, the kinetics of biomarker elevations 
around an exposure are necessary.
The risk of AKI results from the interaction between sus-
ceptibility and exposures. During critical illness, patients 
are exposed to a large number of insults that are potentially 
harmful to renal function, often simultaneously and/or in 
succession. For instance, approximately 20% of the drugs pre-
scribed in the ICU are nephrotoxic (13). The adverse impact 
of drug-induced AKI on patient outcomes can be severe with 
hospital mortality rates reported between 18% and 50% (14, 
15). Exposure to iodinated contrast is also common. A pro-
spective study in three teaching hospitals showed that more 
than 25% of all ICU patients had at least one CT scan and 
more than 80% were performed with iodinated contrast 
(16). The risk of dialysis following contrast is particularly 
increased in patients with a baseline estimated glomerular 
filtration rate less than or equal to 45 ml/min (17).
The detection of AKI following a nephrotoxic insult is usu-
ally delayed until a rise in serum creatinine is seen. As such, 
opportunities to intervene and prevent progression are missed. 
Numerous potential biomarkers for AKI have been identi-
fied (18). Their value lies in the ability to provide information 
beyond traditional tests, in particular in patients without “clas-
sical” signs of impaired renal function. In common with many 
diagnostic tests, the appearance of these biomarkers in serum 
or urine following a potentially nephrotoxic insult is dynamic 
and usually temporary.
In the multicentre SAPPHIRE study, we previously showed 
that TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 predicted the development of AKI 
stage 2–3 within 12 hours and before a rise in serum creatinine 
(7). In this ancillary analysis, we report the prevalence of five 
common renal insults during critical illness (19), that is, major 
surgery, administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs), vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and IV 
iodinated radiocontrast and describe the kinetics of urinary 
[TIMP-2]∙[IGFBP7] in association with exposure to one of 
these insults in patients developing AKI 2–3, AKI 1, or no AKI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
The Sapphire study has been described in detail elsewhere (7). 
In summary, it was a prospective multicenter study in which 
TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 were identified as biomarkers of AKI and 
subsequently validated in an independent validation cohort 
and compared with existing markers of AKI. Between Septem-
ber 2010 and June 2012, 744 critically ill adults (≥ 21 yr) were 
recruited at 35 sites in North America and Europe. Subjects 
were enrolled within 24 hours of admission to the ICU, had 
cardiovascular or respiratory dysfunction, and were expected 
to stay in the ICU for at least 48 hours. AKI was defined 
according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome 
(KDIGO) criteria (20). Subjects were excluded if they had 
AKI stage 2 or 3 at enrolment. The study showed that urinary 
[TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] predicted the development of AKI 2–3 
within 12 hours and before a serum creatinine rise. In this 
follow-up study, we describe the kinetics of urinary [TIMP-
2]•[IGFBP7] around the exposure to five common insults and 
compare patients with and without AKI.
Sample and Data Collection
Following informed consent, urine and blood samples were 
taken at enrolment and at 12-hour intervals for 4 days and 
daily for another 3 days (7). Serum and urine supernatants 
were frozen within approximately 1 hour of collection, stored 
at –70°C or lower, and thawed immediately before analysis.
All clinical data, including patient demographics, reason for 
ICU admission, comorbidities, Acute Physiology and Chronic 
Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score, serum creatinine, and 
hourly urine output, were collected and stored in a password-
protected dataset residing on servers at independent sites 
(Medidata Solutions, New York, NY).
Biomarker Assays
Urinary TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 concentrations were measured by 
technicians who were blinded to the clinical data using a clinical 
immunoassay (NephroCheck Test and Astute140 Meter; Astute 
Medical, San Diego, CA). The Astute140 Meter automatically 
multiplies the concentrations of both biomarkers and divides 
the product by 1,000 to report a single numeric result in (ng/
ml)2/1,000. Creatinine was measured in study-specific serum 
samples at a central laboratory (LabCorp, San Diego, CA).
Exposure and Biomarker Analysis
We identified and described the proportion of patients who 
were exposed to at least one dose of vancomycin, NSAIDs, 
piperacillin/tazobactam, or IV iodinated radiocontrast or

underwent major surgery within 5 days prior to enrollment 
through 7 days after enrolment. Major surgery was defined as 
in-patient surgery under general anesthesia involving open-
ing of a major body cavity (21). These exposures were chosen 
because they are frequent, definable, potentially modifiable, 
and have a well-defined onset. We evaluated serial urinary 
[TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] concentrations from the day prior to 
exposure up to 5 days later and compared the biomarker kinet-
ics of patients according to their maximum AKI stage (no AKI, 
stage 1, stage 2–3) within 3 days following exposure.
Serum creatinine data from 6 months prior to enrolment 
through hospital discharge (truncated at 30 days after enrol-
ment) and urine output data from the day prior to enrollment 
through 7 days after enrollment were collected to determine 
maximum AKI stage (20).
Ethics
According to the Declaration of Helsinki, the Sapphire study 
was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board 
(Olympia, WA) and individual investigational review boards/
research ethics committees of each participating institution. 
All subjects or their legal representatives provided written 
informed consent prior to enrolment.
Statistical Analysis
We investigated the effect of cumulative exposures by count-
ing the number of exposures each subject received up to each 
study day and calculating the maximum AKI stage according 
to KDIGO criteria from enrollment up to each study day. We 
examined if there was an association between the cumulative 
number of exposures up to each day and the maximum AKI 
stage up to that day using test for linear-by-linear association. 
We also examined the association between specific types of 
exposure and the development of any AKI or AKI stage 2–3. For 
this analysis, we only included patients who 1) did not have AKI 
stage 2–3 prior to the exposure; 2) had biomarker data between 
–1 and 5 days from the start of exposure; and 3) had serum 
creatinine and/or urine output data available within 3 days of 
exposure. Supplemental Table S1 (Supplemental Digital Con-
tent 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D36) lists the exclusions for 
each exposure. A generalized linear mixed model analysis was 
performed to test the significance of the association.
In patients who did not have AKI prior to any of the 
five selected exposures, we studied the kinetics of urinary 
 
[TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] concentrations relative to each of the expo-
sures separately. The null hypothesis for each exposure was that on 
each day up to 5 days after the first exposure, the median urinary 
[TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] value within each AKI group (stage 0, 1, and 
2–3) was less than 0.3 (ng/ml)2/1,000 (i.e., low risk for progres-
sion). For an individual subject, multiple [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] 
values may be determined within the same time interval (such as 
within 12, 24, or 36 hours from exposure, or on a calendar day 
following exposure). To account for repeated measurements of 
 
[TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] results from the same subject within a 
time interval, the estimates of median and its interquartile 
range (IQR) were obtained by stratified bootstrap (stratified by 
AKI groups) (22). The p values for the tests of the null hypoth-
esis that the median [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] values were below 
0.3 (ng/ml)2/1,000, versus the alternative hypothesis of median 
above 0.3, were calculated using bootstrap stratified by AKI status.
We analyzed the urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] kinetics 
in association with a specific exposure without taking into 
account other concomitant or sequential exposures. We identi-
fied the earliest time a patient was exposed to each insult and 
defined the maximum AKI stage from the earliest time to 3 
days after the first exposure.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 and R3.0 
(23). Two-sided p-values less than 0.05 and one-sided p-values 
less than 0.025 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Patient Population
The Sapphire cohort consisted of 723 patients (Fig. 1); their 
median age was 64 years (Table 1). During the study period, 
679 patients (94%) had at least one of the selected exposures 
(vancomycin, NSAIDs, piperacillin/tazobactam, IV contrast or 
major surgery), either alone or in combination. More than one 
exposure occurred in 503 patients (70%), three or more expo-
sures in 250 (35%), and 74 patients (10%) were exposed to four. 
Six patients (0.8%) were actually exposed to all five renal insults.
Forty-four patients were not exposed to any of the five 
insults of interest (Fig. 1 and Table 1). They were nonsurgi-
cal patients who were predominantly admitted from the 
Emergency Department or general ward. Their primary rea-
son for admission to the ICU was respiratory failure (61%). 
Overall, patients with or without exposures had similar base-
line characteristics (Table 1).
Prevalence of Exposures With Renal Injury Potential
Exposure to substances or events that may be harmful to the kid-
ney was very common (Tables 2 and 3). In total, 659 patients 
(91.1%) had at least one exposure up to the first study day, and 
666 patients (92.1%) had one or more exposures up to study day 
2 (Table 2). The median time of exposure relative to ICU admis-
sion was 0 days (IQR, –0.3 to 1.0). There was a significant asso-
ciation between cumulative number of exposures up to study 
day 3 and risk of AKI (p = 0.02) but not beyond day 3 (Table 2).
After exclusion of patients who had AKI before any of the 
five exposures, we found that 325 (51%) had had major sur-
gery, 270 (42%) had received IV radiocontrast, 258 (40%) had 
vancomycin, 220 (34%) had received at least one dose of a 
NSAID, and 209 patients (33%) had had piperacillin/tazobac-
tam (Table 3). There was no statistically significant association 
between type of exposure and AKI stage 2–3 (p = 0.20) or any 
stage of AKI (p = 0.22).
Biomarker Kinetics
Analysis of biomarker kinetics was performed in 642 patients 
together with corresponding serum creatinine kinetics (Figs. 1 
and 2A-E; and Supplemental Fig. S1a-e, Supplemental Digital 
Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D36).

Biomarker Kinetics Postmajor Surgery
Three hundred twenty-five patients had major surgery (Fig. 2A; 
and Supplemental Table S2a, Supplemental Digital Content 1, 
http://links.lww.com/CCM/D36). Urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] 
in those who developed AKI stage 2–3 (n = 74 [23%]) were sig-
nificantly elevated from the day of surgery to 48 hours later. 
The median serum creatinine results during this period were 
between 1.0–1.1 mg/dL (Supplemental Fig. S1a, Supplemental 
Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D36). In addi-
tion, for patients with AKI stage 1, urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] 
was significantly elevated at 24–48 hours postoperatively 
 
(Fig. 2A). By contrast, there was no significant elevation in uri-
nary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] for patients who did not develop AKI.
Biomarker Kinetics Following IV Radiocontrast 
Exposure
Among 270 patients exposed to IV radiocontrast, 48 patients (18%) 
developed AKI stage 2–3 (Table 3). They had significantly higher 
urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] from the day of contrast administra-
tion up to 72 hours later (Fig. 2B; and Supplemental Table S2b, 
Supplemental Digital Content 
1, 
http://links.lww.com/CCM/
D36). Unlike the biomarker 
kinetics described following the 
four other exposures, there was 
no typical rise and fall of urinary 
[TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] 
around 
radiocontrast exposure. Median 
serum creatinine results were not 
significantly elevated from their 
baseline values (Supplemental 
Fig. S1b, Supplemental Digital 
Content 1, http://links.lww.com/
CCM/D36). In patients who did 
not develop AKI, there was no 
significant elevation in urinary 
[TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7].
Biomarker Kinetics 
in Association With 
Exposure to Vancomycin
Urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] for 
the 57 of 258 patients (22%) who 
developed AKI stage 2–3 were 
significantly elevated on the day 
of first dose of vancomycin and 
the following 2 days with a peak 
on day 1 (Fig. 2C; and Supple-
mental Table S2c, Supplemental 
Digital Content 1, http://links.
lww.com/CCM/D36). There was 
no significant elevation in uri-
nary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] results 
in patients without AKI or those 
with AKI stage 1 (Fig. 2C).
Biomarker Kinetics in Association With Exposure to 
NSAIDs
Among 220 patients who received at least one dose of NSAID, 
urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] concentrations were significantly 
elevated on day 1 and 2 around the first dose in those who devel-
oped AKI stage 2–3 (n = 38 [17%]) (Fig. 2D; and Supplemen-
tal Table S2d, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.
com/CCM/D36). On both days, the median serum creatinine 
results were not significantly different from their baseline values 
(Supplemental Fig. S1d, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://
links.lww.com/CCM/D36). In patients with AKI stage 1, urinary 
[TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] were also significantly elevated around 
NSAID exposure but only on day 1 (Fig. 2D). There was no 
significant elevation in urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] in patients 
who did not develop AKI.
Biomarker Kinetics in Association With Piperacillin/
Tazobactam Administration
Of 209 patients who received at least one dose of piperacillin/
tazobactam, 37 patients (18%) developed AKI stage 2–3. They

had significantly elevated urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] on the 
first day of exposure and the following day (Fig. 2E; and Sup-
plemental Table S2e, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://
links.lww.com/CCM/D36). There was no significant elevation 
in [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] in patients with AKI stage 1 or no AKI.
Association Between Biomarker Rise and Severity of 
Illness on the Day of Exposure
In patients who developed AKI 2–3, urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] 
concentration was already elevated on the day of exposure to van-
comycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and contrast. However, the exact

contrast, we compared the frequency of concomitant expo-
sures and severity of illness by AKI stage. There were no

statistically significant differences in concomitant exposures 
or APACHE III scores between patients with different stages 
of AKI. However, although not reaching statistical significance 
(p = 0.06), higher APACHE III scores were observed in patients 
with AKI 2–3 in the context of IV contrast administration 
(median APACHE III score, 95.5 [IQR, 56.5–108.2]) compared 
with those with AKI stage 1 (median 51 [IQR, 46.5–65.5]) and 
patients without AKI (median 60 [IQR, 46.25–73.7]), which 
may have contributed to the release of biomarkers.
DISCUSSION
Our analysis confirms that critically ill patients are frequently 
exposed to insults that may be harmful to the kidney. More than 
90% of patients had at least one potential renal insult immedi-
ately before admission or up to the first study day. Cumulative 
exposures posed a significant additive risk for AKI. In patients 
who developed AKI stage 2–3, urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] 
concentrations increased on the day of exposure and exhibited 
a characteristic rise and fall around most exposures. The excep-
tion appeared to be radiocontrast where the characteristic bio-
marker rise was not seen but instead high levels were already 
present on the day of exposure in those with AKI. Importantly, 
in patients who did not develop AKI, there was no significant 
biomarker rise.
Drug-induced nephrotoxicity is a major problem. Drugs con-
tribute to 20% of community-acquired AKI episodes that result 
in hospitalization (13, 15, 19, 24). In the ICU, drug-associated AKI 
affects approximately 15–25% of patients (1, 14, 25). The conse-
quences are potentially serious, with reports of dialysis dependence 
and/or mortality similar to other types of AKI (40–50%) (13–15).
It has been suggested that the decision to initiate a poten-
tially nephrotoxic compound should be guided by personalized 
clinical decision making and close monitoring of renal function 
(20, 26, 27). However, serum creatinine as a marker of glomeru-
lar function is not well suited for this purpose, especially since 
potentially nephrotoxic drugs often exert considerable tubular 
damage before a significant serum creatinine rise is observed 
(28, 29). Novel biomarkers of renal tubular injury have been 
shown to predict both short- and long-term outcomes after AKI 
(29, 30). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the 
use of urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] to assess the risk for AKI in 
clinical practice. Our results clearly show that AKI biomarkers 
are dynamic and change in association with exposures to poten-
tially nephrotoxic insults. Understanding the kinetics of AKI 
biomarkers is important for interpreting their changing levels 
over time. Our analysis represents the first such information 
on the kinetics of urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7]. Although not 
directly examined, we hypothesize that the early use of appro-
priate biomarkers could potentially help clinicians to identify 
patients with renal stress who may benefit from early interven-
tions to prevent progression (31). The molecules IGFBP7 and 
TIMP-2 are known to be associated with mechanisms impli-
cated in the pathogenesis of AKI (7, 32, 33). It has been shown 
that renal tubular cells enter a short period of G1 cell cycle 
arrest during the early phases of cell injury. It is believed that 
this prevents them from dividing until the damage is repaired. 
Markers of cell cycle arrest, such as IGFBP7 and TIMP-2, may 
signal that the renal epithelium has been stressed and has shut 
down function (7). Emlet et al (32) showed that TIMP-2 was 
both expressed and secreted preferentially by cells of distal 
tubule origin while IGFBP7 was preferentially secreted by cells 
of proximal tubule origin. Despite significant progress in this 
area, much remains unknown and work is ongoing.
Our study has certain limitations as expected from retro-
spective analyses. First, we evaluated only five selected insults 
while acknowledging that a proportion of patients may have 
been exposed to many other nephrotoxins. Second, we did 
not analyze the biomarker kinetics of patients without any of 
the five chosen exposures, mainly because the majority was 
exposed to other less frequently used nephrotoxins and there-
fore could not be considered as true controls. Third, we only 
knew the day that vancomycin, NSAIDs, and piperacillin/tazo-
bactam were first administered but not the precise time. Our 
results describe the biomarker kinetics around administration 
of the first dose. This reflects clinical practice where patients 
are often exposed to different potentially nephrotoxic insults 
simultaneously without the exact timing of all exposures being 
known. Fourth, we included “major surgery” as a separate 
potentially injurious insult but did not differentiate between 
different types of surgery and specific perioperative factors. 
Finally, we analyzed different exposures as binary variables

and did not evaluate their intensity, number of doses, mode of 
administration, and duration.
In conclusion, exposure to multiple nephrotoxic insults 
is common during critical illness and associated with an 
increased risk of AKI. Urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] exhibit 
a characteristic rise and fall around various exposures but 
importantly, only in patients who ultimately develop AKI. By 
contrast, serum creatinine is not altered during the early hours 
after exposure to a renal insult. Further studies are necessary 
to explore whether serial biomarker measurement has a role 
in selecting and monitoring medications and preventing drug-
induced AKI.
