With global climate change, more frequent severe snowstorms are expected; however, evidence regarding
their health effects is very limited. We gathered detailed medical records on hospital admissions (n = 433,037
admissions) from the 4 largest hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, during the winters of 2010–2015. We esti-
mated the percentage increase in hospitalizations for cardiovascular and cold-related diseases, falls, and inju-
ries on the day of and for 6 days after a day with low (0.05–5.0 inches), moderate (5.1–10.0 inches), or high
(>10.0 inches) snowfall using distributed lag regression models. We found that cardiovascular disease admis-
sions decreased by 32% on high snowfall days (relative risk (RR) = 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.54,
0.85) but increased by 23% 2 days after (RR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.49); cold-related admissions increased by
3.7% on high snowfall days (RR = 3.7, 95% CI: 1.6, 8.6) and remained high for 5 days after; and admissions for
falls increased by 18% on average in the 6 days after a moderate snowfall day (RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.27).
We did not find a higher risk of hospitalizations for injuries. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which the
time course of hospitalizations during and immediately after snowfall days has been examined. These findings
can be translated into interventions that prevent hospitalizations and protect public health during harsh winter
conditions.

Major snowstorms cause social and economic disruption
and pose hazards to human health (1, 2). The United States
experienced several major winter storms in recent years,
such as those in New England in 2015 and in the Mid-
Atlantic and eastern regions in 2016, that resulted in missed
work, road closures, power loss, and adverse health events,
including carbon monoxide poisoning, traffic accidents, and
deaths (3, 4). With global climate change, greater frequency
of heavy precipitation is expected, particularly in the north-
eastern United States (5), and severe snowstorms are likely
to become increasingly common (6, 7).
In 2015, Boston, Massachusetts, experienced extreme win-
ter weather, with the highest recorded snowfall in a season of
110.6 inches (280.9 centimeters); 4 major snowstorms, of
which 2 ranked in the top 10 for snow accumulation; and a
record-breaking number of consecutive days below 20°F
(−6.7°C). We hypothesized that the high snow accumulation
and frigid temperatures caused by severe snowstorms were
associated with an increase in hospital admissions due to car-
diovascular diseases, cold-related diseases, injuries, and falls
on the day of the snowfall and on the following days.

associated
with
an
increase in rates of mortality, mainly due to ischemic heart
disease (IHD) (8, 9). Previous studies were primarily fo-
cused on a single health outcome (e.g., cardiac arrest (10)
or myocardial infarction (MI) (11)) or a particular snow-
storm event (8, 12), with the majority of these considering
the Northeastern Blizzard of 1978. The present study fills 4

 gaps in the literature on adverse health effects attributable
to extreme weather. First, although there have been many
studies in which investigators used claims data to estimate
associations of extreme cold temperature with mortality
and hospital admissions (13–15), none provided a detailed
characterization
of
the
adverse
health
outcomes
that
occurred during and immediately after major snowfall
while also adjusting for temperature. Second, to our knowl-
edge, there has been no study in which researchers investi-
gated the health effects associated with the intensity of the
snowstorm (inches of snow accumulation). Third, because
of challenges such as road closures, power loss, and frigid
temperatures on days of high snow accumulation and be-
cause outcomes are expected to vary in severity (potentially
ranging from a fall with a fracture to hypothermia), we
anticipated a delay in hospitalization for some causes but
not others. However, to our knowledge, the time course of
hospitalization by cause of admission and whether these
time courses differ depending on the intensity of snow
accumulation has not been characterized. Understanding
the time course of hospitalization is critical both to evaluate
the full health impact of severe winter weather and to
potentially prevent these adverse health events. Fourth,
most studies on the health effects of cold and heat waves in
the United States have relied on administrative claims and
mortality data from governmental agencies (13, 16, 17),
but few have used data from electronic medical records ob-
tained directly from hospitals. Access to detailed and well-
validated medical records in a city that can be severely
affected by snowstorms provides a unique opportunity to
examine the number of hospitalizations that occur during
and immediately after major snow events with an unprece-
dented level of accuracy.
METHODS
Data acquisition
We obtained de-identified individual-level hospitalization
data from electronic medical records from the 4 largest hos-
pitals in Boston (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,
Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston Medical Center,
and Massachusetts General Hospital) for each day during the
months of November through April for the years 2010–
2015. We included in our study all admissions of adults
(≥18 years of age) with inpatient or observation status
(including observation admissions in the emergency depart-
ment). For each admission, we obtained individual-level data
that included the date of hospitalization, the primary and
first 2 secondary discharge diagnosis codes (International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) for the hospitali-
zation, and the patient’s age, race, sex, and discharge vital
status. These data were obtained directly from the hospitals.
We considered 6 outcomes in our analysis: 3 cardiovascu-
lar disease categories (severe arrhythmias/cardiac arrest, MI
and IHD, and cardiovascular disease, which was measured
as the combination of all arrhythmias, IHD, and MI), cold-
related diseases (e.g., frostbite), injuries, and falls. Each
outcome was defined based on the primary International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code assigned to
the admission except in cases of falls, which were defined
based on E codes. E codes, which can only be assigned as
secondary (not primary) codes, are supplemental codes that
capture the external cause of injury or poisoning, as well as
the intent and the place where the event occurred (Web
Table 1, available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/). For each
outcome, we derived the daily number of admissions by
adding the individual admissions across the 4 hospitals.
We obtained daily weather data (minimum, maximum,
and average temperature, as well as daily amount of snow
accumulation) from the Weather Source, which provided
data from the monitoring station at Boston Logan Airport
and included daily snow accumulation data for 95% of the
days in our study period (18). We imputed missing snow-
fall data by taking the average of the snow accumulation
from the day before and the day after the missing day. The
study protocol was approved by the institutional review
boards at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health
(which covers Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,
Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brigham and Women’s
Hospital) and at the Boston Medical Center.
Statistical analysis
The outcome variable was the daily number of cause-
specific hospital admissions. The exposure variable (inde-
pendent variable) was defined as an indicator of category
of snowfall: high (>10.0 inches of snow accumulation),
moderate (5.1–10.0 inches), and low (0.05–5.0 inches),
with no snowfall as the reference group. We used general-
ized linear models assuming a Poisson outcome with log
link. We fit the models using quasi-likelihood methods to
allow for overdispersion (19). For each outcome, we esti-
mated the relative risk of hospital admission on days with
low, moderate, or high snowfall compared with days with-
out snowfall. We fit 3 separate models that included the
subset of days with low versus no snowfall, moderate ver-
sus no snowfall, and high versus no snowfall. To account
for secular trends in hospital admissions, we adjusted for
calendar year, calendar month, and day of the week as cate-
gorical variables. To account for potentially delayed asso-
ciations between snowfall and hospital admissions, we fit
unconstrained distributed lag models (20–23) to estimate
lag-specific relative risks on the day of snowfall (lag 0) and
for the 6 days after the snowfall day (lags 1–6).
Specifically, our model was of the form

 category). We examined the correlation of snowfall days
across lags and did not find high correlations (the highest
was 0.30 between lag 0 and lag 2 for low snowfall days);
we therefore did not impose constraints on the distributed
lag parameters βl, which is recommended when there is
concern of multicollinearity (24).
In the model, the lag-specific relative risks are given by

l . We also estimated the overall rela-
tive risk of hospital admissions by adding the lag-specific
estimates. Specifically, the overall relative risk compares
the total number of hospitalizations in the weeklong period
after a snowfall day with the total number of hospitaliza-
tions in the weeklong period after a day without snowfall
and is given by

. The standard error for the
overall relative risk was calculated using the delta method.
To explore whether risks varied by age, we repeated the
analysis stratified by age group (18–64 years vs. ≥65 years).
We also conducted 2 sensitivity analyses. First, we evaluated
whether the association of snowfall with health outcomes re-
mained after controlling for temperature by including in the
model a smooth function of average daily temperature that
was modeled using natural cubic splines with 3 degrees of
freedom (25). Second, we considered an alternative approach
to adjusting for secular trends in which we included a smooth
function of day within the winter season (from 0 to 181),
where the coefficients of the smooth function were allowed
to differ across each winter season. Specifically, for this
alternative specification, rather than include the month and
season-specific categorical variables, we included terms for
the interaction between winter season and natural cubic splines
of the day within the season with 4 degrees of freedom.
RESULTS
Over the study period (the months of November–April
in 2010–2015), there were 433,037 hospitalizations for
the 4 outcomes (cardiovascular disease, cold-related dis-
eases, injuries, and falls) considered across the 4 hospitals
(Table 1). Figure 1 shows the daily snow accumulations
during the study period (daily hospitalization data are
shown in Web Figure 1). Of the 906 days, 110 (12.1%)
had low snowfall, 11 (1.2%) had moderate snowfall, and
10 (1.1%) had high snowfall (Table 2). There were fewer
days with no snowfall in later winters, and of the 10 high
snowfall days, only 1 occurred during the first 2 winters,
whereas 4 occurred during the 2014–2015 winter.
Primary analysis
Figure 2 shows the lag-specific relative risk of hospitali-
zation for 6 outcomes comparing low (0.05–5.0 inches),
moderate (5.1–10.0 inches), and high (>10.0 inches) snow-
fall days with days without snowfall from the primary
model (estimates from unadjusted model are in Web
Figure 2; numerical values are in Web Table 2). Figure 3
shows the corresponding overall relative risk of hospitaliza-
tions obtained by summing the lag-specific relative risks
for each snowfall category and each outcome (numerical
results are in Web Table 3). The relative risks can be
interpreted as the percentage increase in hospitalizations on
low, moderate, and high snowfall days compared with days
without snowfall.
Cardiovascular disease admissions.
For high snowfall
days, admissions for cardiovascular disease (all arrhyth-
mias, IHD, and MI) were 32% lower on the day of the
snowfall (lag 0) than on days without snowfall (relative
risk = 0.68, 95% confidence interval: 0.54, 0.85), increased
slightly on the next day (lag 1), and had the largest increase
2 days after the snowfall (lag 2), with a relative risk of
1.22 (95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.49). The increase in
admissions for cardiovascular disease 2 days after a high
snowfall day was driven by an increase in MIs and IHD.
We found a statistically significant increase of the overall
relative risk on moderate snowfall days.
Cold-related diseases.
For high snowfall days, cold-
related admissions were 23% higher 2 days after the snow-
fall day (at lag 2, relative risk = 1.23, 95% confidence
interval: 1.01, 1.49). For moderate snowfall days, we ob-
served a significant increase in cold-related disease admis-
sions on the day of snowfall but estimates on subsequent
days were not statistically significant. We observed an
overall increased risk of cold-related disease hospitaliza-
tions for all snowfall categories, with a larger overall rela-
tive risk on days with more intense snowfall.
Injuries and falls.
We did not find evidence of a statisti-
cally significant increase in hospitalizations for injuries.
For fall-related injuries, we found small but statistically
significant relative risks on days 4, 5, and 6 after low snow-
fall days and on days 4 and 6 after moderate snowfall days.
We also found an overall higher risk of hospitalizations on
low and moderate but not high snowfall days.
Sensitivity analysis
Adjustment for the average daily temperature did not
change the estimated overall relative risks, except for cold-
related illness hospitalizations, which had lower but still
significant risks (Figure 4; Web Table 3). This suggests that
for days with similar average temperatures, the presence
of snow accumulation was associated with additional cold-
related hospitalizations. In the sensitivity analysis that was
adjusted for secular trends using splines, estimates for car-
diovascular disease hospitalizations remained very similar,
whereas estimates for cold-related hospitalizations associated
with moderate and high snowfall days were slightly attenu-
ated, and estimates for injuries requiring hospitalization after
high snowfall days became statistically significant.
The analysis stratified by age group (Figure 5) indicated
that the higher risk of cold-related hospitalizations on mod-
erate and high snowfall days and cardiovascular disease
hospitalizations on moderate snowfall days did not differ
considerably across the 2 groups, whereas the increase in
hospitalizations for falls was driven primarily by persons in
the 18–64 years of age category.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study in which the
time course of hospital admissions after low, moderate, and

 high snowfall have been examined in an area affected by
severe winter weather across several disease causes. We
found that the risk of hospitalization varied depending on
the cause of the admission, the intensity of snow accumula-
tion, and the time lag from the snowfall day. The study
period included the extreme weather events experienced in
Boston in the winter of 2014–2015, as well as 3 of the largest
winter storms ever recorded in Boston (winter storms Nemo,
February 8–9, 2013; Juno, January 26–28, 2015; and Marcus,
February 7–10, 2015).
Cardiovascular disease admissions
The mechanisms by which snowstorms and severe winter
weather lead to adverse cardiovascular events have not been
resolved. Exposure to low temperatures has been associated
with excess cardiovascular mortality (13) and an increased
risk of acute MI (26), but our estimates of the overall rela-
tive risk of hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease did
not change substantially (and remained statistically signifi-
cant) after flexible adjustment for daily temperature, which

Hospital Admissions During Major Snowstorms

 suggests that additional factors beyond temperature likely
play a role. Snow shoveling may be one such factor. This
possibility derives from case studies of “snow-shoveler’s
infarction” (11, 27), which found that heavy snow shoveling
resulted in cardiorespiratory demands that were comparable
to or higher than the demands of maximal treadmill testing
(28). Findings from other studies have also shown increased
mortality for several days after a snowstorm (8). Similarly,
we found an elevated risk of MI/IHD 2 days after and severe
arrhythmias/cardiac arrest 1 day after moderate snowfall
days, with an overall increased risk for cardiovascular hospi-
talization across all lags after moderate snowfall.
Falls and injuries
In prior studies, investigators have examined the associa-
tions of snowfall with emergency department visits (29)
and motor vehicle collisions (30). In 1, researchers identi-
fied clusters of emergency department visits resulting from
falls and found that these clusters occurred during periods
of snowfall or freezing rain (29). This result supports our
finding that snowfall is associated with an increased risk of
hospitalizations from falls. In another study, the risk of
motor vehicle collisions on snowfall days compared with
dry days was estimated, and the results were mixed:
Snowfall days were associated with a higher risk of nonfa-
tal injuries from crashes but a lower risk of fatal crashes
(29). We did not observe any association between snowfall
and an increased risk of hospitalization from injuries. One
possibility could be that, because our data excluded outpa-
tient visits, we might have missed less severe injuries that
did not lead to hospitalization. Another explanation could
be that our injuries outcome category, which is heteroge-
neous with a large number of diagnoses, includes several
types of injury not affected by snow, diluting the associa-
tions of specific injuries that may increase with snowfall.
Future work should investigate diagnosis-specific outcomes
within the broader outcome categories considered here.
Intensity of snow accumulation
It is interesting that moderate but not high snowfall was
associated with an overall increase in cardiovascular admis-
sions and that low and moderate but not high snowfall were
associated with an overall increase in falls that required hos-
pital admission. One explanation could be that the indivi-
duals most susceptible to cardiovascular events or falls tend
to stay inside during the most severe weather conditions
and therefore would not be exposed to the health hazards
posed by these conditions. Our age-stratified results, which
showed that the increase in hospital admissions for falls
was driven predominantly by younger adults, support this
possibility. The lower risk of cardiovascular hospitalization
on high snowfall days (lag 0, >10.0 inches) may be related
to individuals staying indoors and not engaging in activities
that lead to adverse events.
Lag-specific results
We found that the time lag with the highest risk of ad-
missions differed depending on the cause of disease and
the severity of the snowfall. For example, hospitalizations
for cardiovascular disease decreased sharply on high snow-
fall days (lag 0, >10.0 inches) compared with days without

 snowfall, peaked 2 days after the high snowfall day (lag 2),
and then returned to baseline levels on subsequent days.
For cold-related disease admissions, the highest risks
occurred on the day of (lag 0) and the day after (lag 1) a
high snowfall, and for falls, the highest risks occurred a
few days after a low or moderate snowfall day.
Our finding that cardiovascular admissions decreased
on high snowfall days but increased on subsequent days
prompts us to question whether these findings reflect excess
hospitalizations resulting from weather conditions or if
they are simply due to delays in getting to the hospital.
Individuals may delay going to (or be unable to get to) the
hospital during high snowfall days, especially when there
is a declared snow emergency, travel ban, or shutdown of
public transportation. Of the 4 days in the winter of 2014–
2015 with more than 10 inches of snow, 3 days were
declared a snow emergency, 1 of which had a 24-hour
statewide travel ban (January 27, 2015; 22.1 inches of
snow accumulation). Our estimates of the overall relative
risk, which did not differ from the null, suggest that rather
than leading to new hospitalizations, heavy snow accumu-
lation may instead shift those admissions to a few days
later when the snowstorm has subsided. This result high-
lights the importance of our methodology, which allows
for estimating both the lag-specific and overall effects of
snowfall on daily hospital admissions.
Given that snowstorms have been associated with higher
rates of death from IHD on the day of the snowstorm (lag
0) (9), another possible explanation for the reduced number
of same-day cardiovascular disease admissions is that those
individuals with the highest risk of an acute cardiac event
who otherwise would have been hospitalized may have
died suddenly during the storm and therefore never been
hospitalized (16, 17).
A key feature of our modeling approach, in which we
estimated the association between day-to-day changes in
snowfall and day-to-day changes in hospital admissions, is
that it controls for both measured and unmeasured factors
that vary slowly over time but do not change daily (21, 31,
32), such as race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. One
factor that does vary daily is air pollution level; however,
because air pollution is unlikely to cause snowfall, we do
not need to adjusted for it to control for confounding (33).
On the other hand, major storms may lead to higher air pol-
lution levels, and therefore air pollution could be a media-
tor of adverse snowstorm-related health effects, which is a
topic for future investigation.
Several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the
snowfall data were measured at a single monitoring location
in Boston and may differ from citywide average levels.
Second, using billing codes to define outcomes has known
limitations. For example, because diagnoses which result in
the highest payout from patients or insurance providers are
more likely to be identified as the primary diagnosis code,
an admission may not be coded as a cold-related disease if
other diagnoses are present. However, we would expect this
outcome misclassification to occur on days with and with-
out snowfall (i.e., nondifferential misclassification), and
thus it would likely bias the relative risk estimates toward
the null (34). Third, we only considered admissions and did
not include other outcomes, such as emergency department
volume, clinic volume, or treatment for falls and injuries

 that did not require admission. Fourth, although our study
included 4 major hospitals within the urban center of
Boston, the severe winter weather affected a much broader
region. Thus, our results may not be generalizable to more
suburban or rural areas that differ across a range of fac-
tors, including demographic characteristics, accessibility
to hospitals, and reliance on cars versus other modes of
transportation (e.g., walking, public transit). Future multi-
site studies covering a broader geographical area with
different weather patterns, age structures, and potential
adaptations to severe winter weather are warranted to both
replicate the findings of the current study and explore
characteristics that might modify the association between
snowfall and hospital admissions.
Study strengths include the large population-based sample
and the use of electronic medical records, which provide
more detailed information than do claims data and include all
age groups, not just people older than 65 years of age.
Additionally, the length of the study period allowed us to
capture a range of severity across winters, including the his-
toric 2014–2015 winter season, and our application of distrib-
uted lag models allowed us to measure delayed associations
and the variations associated with the severity of the snowfall
event and the cause of hospitalization. The 4 hospitals that
participated in this study represent the largest in the city of
Boston and provide 71% of all hospital beds in facilities that
provide acute care for nonpediatric populations (35).
With global climate change, the frequency of snow-
storms is expected to increase, and characterizing the health
impact of snowstorms by degree of snow accumulation,
disease outcomes, and their time course is paramount. The
results of the present study can be directly translated into
public health and clinical interventions that prevent hospital
admissions caused by snowstorms and protect public health
during harsh winter conditions.
