Abstract 
 
This study investigated the impact of an isocaloric and isonitrogenous 
ketogenic diet (KD) versus a traditional western diet (WD) on changes in body 
composition, performance, blood lipids, and hormonal profiles in resistance-trained 
athletes.  METHODS: Twenty-five college aged men were divided into a KD or 
traditional WD from weeks 1-10, with a reintroduction of carbohydrates from 
weeks 10-11, while participating in a resistance-training program.  Body 
composition, strength, power, and blood lipid profiles were determined at week 0, 
10 and 11. A comprehensive metabolic panel and testosterone levels were also 
measured at weeks 0 and 11.  RESULTS: Lean body mass (LBM) increased in both 
KD and WD groups (2.4% and 4.4%, p<0.01) at week 10.  However, only the KD 
group showed an increase in LBM between weeks 10-11 (4.8%, p<0.0001). Finally, 
fat mass decreased in both the KD group (-2.2 kg ± 1.2 kg) and WD groups (- 1.5 ± 
1.6 kg).  Strength and power increased to the same extent in the WD and KD 
conditions from weeks 1-11.  No changes in any serum lipid measures occurred 
from weeks 1-10, however a rapid reintroduction of carbohydrate from weeks 10-
11 raised plasma TG levels in the KD group.  Total testosterone increased 
significantly from Weeks 0-11 in the KD diet (118 ng/dl) as compared to the WD (-
36 ng/dl) from pre to post while insulin did not change. CONCLUSIONS: The KD can 
be used in combination with resistance training to cause favorable changes in body 
composition, performance and hormonal profiles in resistance-trained males.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The ketogenic diet (KD) is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat, moderate-protein 
diet that has been demonstrated as an effective means to ameliorate drug resistant 
epilepsy (11, 23).  Emerging data supports the use of the KD for the metabolic 
management of cancer (10), metabolic syndrome (29), type-2 diabetes (1), and 
Alzheimer's disease (26). One of the prevailing effects of the KD that is often 
observed in clinical trials is a relative ease of fat loss, which exceeds that of diets 
higher in carbohydrate (31, 36).  Moreover, those on a KD seem to lose fat mass with 
a greater retention of lean mass independent of any form of exercise (36). Due to 
this unique circumstance, KDs may prove advantageous to athletes in weight-class 
restricted sports or those looking to improve body composition by retaining active 
muscle mass while lowering fat mass for competitions.  
To date, the impact of the KD in athletes seeking to improve body 
composition as well as those looking to improve strength and power performance 
have received very little attention.  The majority of exercise studies that have 
examined high-fat diets thus far have also contained an amount of carbohydrates 
sufficient to limit or prevent ketosis, have been underpowered, and/or were too 
short to allow for adaptation to the diet (14).  The result was an experimental diet 
unable to achieve the full spectrum of benefits expected from a sustained ketogenic 
diet (14). Phinney (18) demonstrated that cycling time to exhaustion was 
maintained in highly trained cyclists following 4 weeks of KD, and improvements 
were observed in obese individuals in a similar setting (20). Moreover, these

researchers found that subjects consuming the KD drastically increased their 
capacity to oxidize fat relative to a high-carbohydrate diet.  
In fact, elite ultra-endurance athletes following a KD for an average of 20 
months’ experience fat oxidation rates during submaximal exercise of ~1.2g/min 
compared to ~0.7g/min with a carbohydrate-based diet, creating average 
contributions of fat of 88% and 56%, respectively [29]. Perhaps the most intriguing 
result of this study was the observation of equal muscle glycogen levels at baseline 
as well as similar depletion and resynthesis patterns in response to exercise, which 
may be attributed to the duration of KD or average daily carbohydrate intake (82 ± 
62g) in the KD group. Traditionally, a KD consists of an upper limit of 30-50g of 
carbohydrate, yet ~82g carbohydrate/day in elite athletes does not appear to 
disrupt nutritional ketosis [29]. Presently, the role of carbohydrate reintroduction 
following KD adaptation is poorly understood. 
Fewer studies have investigated the effects of long-term adaptation to the KD 
on exercise performance (18). Sawyer et al. (22) demonstrated that a short term KD 
resulted in weight loss without compromising strength or power.  A recent study by 
Paoli et al. (15)  reported that elite gymnasts lost body fat while maintaining 
strength after one month of an ad libitum KD. The importance of this study is 
magnified when one considers the fact that during this experiment the athletes’ 
training routine was not altered in any way during the dieting period. Collectively, 
these results indicate that KD may serve as a valuable tool to lower body fat without 
compromising strength or power.  Given sports highly regard the strength and 
power to bodyweight ratios, this may provide a strong basis for the use of ketogenic

dieting within the strength power domain. However, little is known regarding the 
effects of the KD in strength athletes.   
We recently conducted the first acute and chronic resistance training studies 
under ketogenic dieting conditions using a rodent model (21).  For the acute model, 
we found that basal and short term rises in protein synthesis and breakdown were 
the same in KD and WD rats following a resistance training bout.   In our second 
study, rats voluntarily-exercised daily using resistance-loaded running wheels for 6 
weeks with no differences in voluntary training volume.  Moreover, both the WD 
and KD groups demonstrated similar increases in hindlimb muscle mass.   
 While our rodent data strongly indicate that KD does not impair 
hypertrophy we have yet to examine resistance training adaptations using a human 
model.  Therefore, the present study is the first to examine the effects of a KD versus 
a WD on resistance training adaptations in a group of resistance-trained men.  We 
hypothesized that the KD would decrease body fat to a greater extent than a WD 
group, while maintaining skeletal muscle hypertrophy, strength, and power. The 
secondary purpose of our investigation was to determine the effects of the KD in 
this population on blood lipid profile, blood biomarkers of health, and anabolic 
hormone status.  The tertiary purpose of the present study was to observe the 
effects of carbohydrate refeeding following KD adaptation on body composition and 
performance.

METHODS 
 
Experimental Approach to the Problem 
Subjects were randomly assigned to either the WD or KD treatment groups. 
Following a 2-week diet adaptation period, both groups participated in an 8 week 
supervised, periodized resistance training.   Carbohydrates were re-introduced to 
the subjects in the KD treatment from week 10 to week 11 in an effort to control for 
lean body mass measurement differences, which may be present with DXA due to 
potential differences in muscle glycogen and water levels [17]. Measurements of 
body composition, performance, and serum markers were conducted at baseline 
(week 0), following the resistance training intervention (week 10), and following 
the reintroduction of carbohydrates to the KD group (week 11). Blood ketones were 
monitored weekly as a measure of compliance in the KD group. See Table 1 for a 
complete timeline. 
Subjects 
Thirty resistance-trained males were recruited for the present study.  Two 
subjects dropped from the study due to scheduling conflicts, two due to 
noncompliance with the diet, and one with an injury unrelated to the study.  The 
remaining 25 subjects had an average squat of 1.56 ± 0.14 times their body weight 
and an average of 5.5 ± 3.8 years of training experience, and they represented the 
KD (N=13) and WD (N=12) groups used for data analyses. Inclusion criteria 
consisted of males between the age of 18 and 30 who were actively engaged in 
resistance training and able to perform a one repetition maximum (1RM) in the 
squat with at least 1.5 times their initial body weight. Potential subjects were

excluded if they were currently taking anti-inflammatory agents, had used any 
performance-enhancing supplements in the past 6 weeks, used tobacco, had any 
recent medical condition or event that may affect study outcomes, or if they had 
tried any extreme dieting strategy (e.g. severe calorie restriction) in the past 6 
months. Each participant signed an informed consent approved by the University of 
Tampa Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol # 13-75) before participating in 
the study.   
 
Procedures 
A familiarization phase took place prior to data collection in order to 
accustom subjects to all performance testing. Following familiarization, data 
collection included measurements of muscle thickness, body composition, strength, 
power, and hormonal panels as described below. Immediately following baseline 
testing at week zero, subjects were provided detailed instruction on the KD or WD 
parameters and were provided a 2-week adaptation period prior to commencement 
of the resistance training protocol at the beginning of week 3. At week 3, subjects in 
the KD were adapted to the diet as verified by blood ketone levels (Figure 1). 
Body Composition 
Body composition (lean body mass (LBM) and fat mass (FM)) was 
determined on a Hologic™ dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) apparatus (software 
version, enCORE 2013, Boston, U.S.A.).  Participants assumed a supine position on 
an examination table and were instructed not to move for the entire duration of the 
scan. Results from each scan were uploaded and accessed on a computer that was

directly linked to the DXA device. The coefficient of variation (12) between body 
composition assessments was 1.5%. 
Ultrasonography-determined muscle hypertrophy was assessed using 
combined muscle thickness of the vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius muscles in 
the transverse plane of the right leg at 50% femur length, defined as the distance 
from the greater trochanter of the femur to the lateral epicondyle of the femur while 
the subjects lie supine and relaxed. The precise site measured was marked with a 
permanent marker, and subjects were instructed to maintain the mark throughout 
the study to aid with replication of the measurement. The distance from the 
superficial aspect of the femur to the deep aspect of the superficial fascia of the 
vastus lateralis was quantified directly on the ultrasound device (Logiq e, General 
Electric, Fairfield, CT). A water-soluble gel was applied to the 45-mm linear array 
transducer (7.5MHz) to aid acoustic coupling and remove the need to contact the 
skin, eliminating deformations of the muscle that can occur with direct pressure to 
the skin and underlying muscle. The same investigator performed all ultrasound 
assessments and was blinded to the treatment groups.  The CV between muscle 
thickness assessments was 3.4%. 
Maximal Strength and Power 
  
After familiarization procedures, upper- and lower-body maximum strength 
were assessed via 1RM testing of the back squat and bench press. Each lift was 
deemed successful as described by International Powerlifting Federation rules. In 
brief, participants performed a general warm-up and a specific warm-up consisting 
of two sets with a 3-minute rest following each set. During the first set, participants

performed 10 repetitions with 50% of their predicted 1RM. In the second set, they 
performed five repetitions with 75% of their predicted 1RM. Then, each participant 
had up to five attempts to achieve their 1RM. Muscle power was assessed during 
maximal Wingate cycle ergometer sprinting (Monark, Vansbro, Sweden). During the 
cycling test, the subject was instructed to cycle against a predetermined resistance 
(7.5% of body mass) as fast as possible for 10 seconds (24). The saddle height was 
adjusted for each individual in order to produce a 5–10° knee flexion while the foot 
was in the low position of the central void. Power output was recorded in real time 
by a computer connected to the Monark standard cycle ergometer (Monark model 
894e, Vansbro, Sweden).  Wingate peak power (PP) was recorded using Monark 
Anaerobic test software (Monark Anaerobic Wingate Software, Version 1.0, Monark, 
Vansbro, Sweden). Strong verbal encouragement was provided throughout 
performance testing.   
Diet 
A registered dietician that specializes in sports nutrition supervised the diet 
of each participant throughout the study. The caloric content of each participant’s 
diet was calculated each week and was given based on maintenance calories 
determined by the Mifflin St. Jeor equation (13). The WD consisted of 20% calories 
from protein, 55% from total carbohydrate, and 25% from fat.  The KD consisted of 
20% calories from protein, 5% from carbohydrate including fiber, and 75% from fat.  
The accuracy of the diet was measured two ways.  First, subjects kept a daily log of 
food intake that was monitored by the dietician.  Second, subjects’ blood ketones 
were monitored weekly.  If deviation from the diet occurred outside of the

parameters set forth by the dietitian, or the subjects blood ketones did not register a 
minimum of 0.3 mmols for ketones then the dietician met with the subject more 
closely until these parameters fell within the scope of the study.  Subjects were 
instructed to consume food immediately following training that contained a 
minimum of 20-30 grams of protein, with the remainder of the meal reflecting the 
accurate ratios prescribed throughout the day.   
 
Following the 10-week diet and training regime, a programmed 
carbohydrate reintroduction and fat taper was implemented. The WD group 
maintained their diet protocol while the KD group was prescribed a new diet, 
consisting of 1g/kg carbohydrate for 2 days, then 2g/kg carbohydrate for the next 2 
days, and finally 3g/kg carbohydrate for the last 2 days with an isocaloric decrease 
in dietary fat before final testing.   
Following the two-week diet adaptation period, all participants performed a 
7-week high volume resistance training protocol followed by a 2 week taper for the 
remainder of the study. Exercise protocols for the study are shown in Table 2 which 
includes a 3-day training split each week.  All subjects were instructed to not 
perform any additional resistance training or endurance training throughout the 
duration of the study.    For all criterion lifts, subjects were given a target repetition 
range based on a percentage of their 1RM.  All subjects either reached their target 
repetition scheme or failure by the final set.   The load utilized for weeks 3-6 ranged 
from 65 to 95 % of subjects’ initial 1RM.  However, these loads were increased by 2-
5 % for the final 7-9 weeks of training depending on subject’s ability to perform the 
prescribed repetitions during weeks 3-6.   For the final two weeks, subjects tapered

by decreasing volume by 40-50 % through decreasing sets on auxiliary lifts on 
Monday and Wednesdays, and only performing 1RM testing on Fridays.  Volume for 
all training weeks was calculated by obtaining the product of sets, repetitions and 
total weight lifted for all subjects.   
Blood Analysis 
Blood draws were obtained via venipuncture by a trained phlebotomist 
following a 12-hour fast.   All subjects submitted a blood sample for analysis in the 
morning to control for diurnal variations. Whole blood was collected, transferred 
into appropriate tubes for obtaining serum and plasma, and subsequently 
centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 min at 4°C. Resulting serum and plasma were then 
aliquoted and stored at -80°C until analysis.   
Samples were thawed one time and analyzed in duplicate for each analyte. 
Serum total and free testosterone, along with insulin, were assayed via ELISA kits 
obtained from Diagnostic Systems Laboratories (Webster, TX). All hormones were 
measured in the same assay on the same day to avoid compounded inter-assay 
variance. Intra-assay variance was less than 5% for all analytes. 
Total HDL cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) were measured via fingerstick 
using a portable blood test system (CardioChek. Model # 09010) at weeks 0, 10, and 
11 in a fasted state.  All ketone measurements were taken between the hours of 5pm 
and 7pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) before the dinner meal in order to avoid any 
misreading’s due to morning or training cortisol elevations. The ketone beta-
hydroxybutyrate (BHB) was measured in the blood weekly using a Precision Xtra™ 
meter (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA).

Statistical Analysis 
After a visual inspection of boxplots in order to identify any outliers, a 
normality test (i.e. Shapiro Wilk) confirmed the normality of the data. A two-way 
ANOVA with repeated measures was performed using  time (baseline, post-10wk 
and post-11wk) and group (KD and WD). When a significant F-value was obtained, a 
post-hoc with Tukey´s adjustment was performed for multiple comparisons. In 
addition, delta values for weeks 1-10, 1-11, and 10-11 were calculated on selected 
variables and were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA. The significance level was set 
at p<0.05. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.   
 
RESULTS 
 
There were no significant differences for age (KD = 23.5 ± 4.5 vs. WD = 21.3 ± 
3.7), or body mass (Table 3) between the treatment groups at the start of the study. 
There were no differences in training volume between conditions at any time point 
(Figure 2) 
Results for body composition can be viewed in Figure 3. There were no 
significant differences in LBM at baseline between groups. Lean body mass was 
significantly increased in both KD and WD groups (2.4% and 4.4%, p<0.01) at the 
10-week time point. Both KD and WD groups increased LBM when compared to 
baseline values (7.3% and 3.6%, p<0.0002) at week 11. However, only the KD group 
showed an increase in LBM between weeks 10-11 (4.8%, p<0.0001) while no

differences were observed in the WD group between weeks 10-11 (-0.72%, p<0.54) 
(Figure 3A). An absolute delta analysis revealed that LBM changes between weeks 
1-11 and 10-11 were significantly greater in the KD when compared to the WD 
group (p<0.007) (Figure 3B).   
  
There were no significant differences in fat mass baseline between groups 
(p<0.05). Fat mass was significantly decreased in both KD and WD groups (-22.4% 
and -13.0%, p<0.0001) following week 10. Fat mass was also lower in both the KD 
and WD groups at week 11 compared to baseline values (-5.4% and -6.2%, p<0.002). 
However, only the KD significantly increased fat mass between weeks 10 and 11 of 
CHO reefed (p<0.0001), with no differences observed in fat mass in the WD group 
between weeks 10-11 (5.6%, p<0.25) (Figure 3C). An absolute delta analysis 
revealed that fat mass changes between weeks 1-10 (but not at any other time 
point) were significantly greater in the KD group when compared to the WD group 
(p<0.007) (Figure 3D). 
There were no significant differences in muscle thickness at baseline 
between groups (p<0.05) (Figure 3E). Muscle thickness was significantly increased 
in both KD and WD groups (5.2% and 3.5% p<0.03) between weeks 1-10. Only the 
KD group significantly increased muscle thickness at week 11 when compared to 
baseline values (8.0%, p<0.0001). There were no differences for muscle thickness 
between weeks 10-11 for both groups (p>0.99) (Figure 3F). An absolute delta 
analysis revealed that muscle thickness changes between weeks 1-11 were 
significantly greater in KD when compared to WD (p<0.02) (Figure 3F).

All performance values can be viewed in Table 3. For all strength measures 
there was a time effect in which the 1RM bench press and squat increased in both 
the KD and WD from weeks 0 to 10 and weeks 10 to 11. There were no differences 
between conditions at any time points. There was a group x time effect for Wingate 
PP in which the WD increased from Weeks 0 to 10, while the KD did not. However, 
only the KD increased from Week 10 to 11. At no time point were there any 
differences between conditions for peak power.    
Throughout the duration of the study there were no differences in average 
total calories and protein consumed between subjects (Table 4). The only 
differences seen were between total carbohydrate and fats consumed. Moreover, 
compliance to the diet protocols was confirmed through weekly tracking of 
macronutrient content (Table 4) as well as blood ketone levels (Figure 1).  
There were no differences in any of the health biomarkers measured (CBC / 
CMP) in either the KD or WD group (Tables 5-7). All blood lipid values can be found 
in Table 3. There were no changes in total cholesterol or HDL in either group.  
However, there was a trend for an increase in HDL (p=0.08) in the KD group (6.69 
mg/dl) compared to the WD (-1.6 mg/dl) with no changes in LDL.  There was a 
group x time interaction for triglycerides (TG) in which TG did not change from 
weeks 0-10 in either group, but rose from weeks 10-11 in the KD group after the 
reintroduction of carbohydrates. Total testosterone increased significantly in the KD 
(118 ng/dl) as compared to the WD group (-36 ng/dl) with no changes in fasting 
insulin between groups.

DISCUSSION 
 
The present study was designed to investigate the effects of the KD versus 
the WD on resistance training adaptations in body composition, muscle thickness, 
strength, and power. The secondary purpose of our investigation was to determine 
the effects of KD on blood lipid profile, biomarkers of health, and anabolic hormone 
status in resistance-trained athletes, and the tertiary purpose was to observe the 
effects of carbohydrate refeeding following KD adaptation on body composition and 
performance. The primary finding of this study was that the KD resulted in 
favorable body composition changes relative to the WD with similar increases in 
muscle strength and power. Moreover, excluding the increase in TGs following the 
reintroduction of carbohydrates, there were no negative changes in blood lipid 
profile or health parameters in the participants who underwent ketogenic diet.  
Finally, it appears that a rapid reintroduction of carbohydrate following a moderate 
duration of KD negatively impacts body fat mass but potentially benefits lean mass 
content and anaerobic power output.  
Previous research with the KD compared to the WD in sedentary or 
overweight populations has shown greater preservation of LBM with significant 
reductions in fat mass (8). However, our study is the first to investigate the impact 
of the KD in advanced resistance trained athletes with relatively lower body fat. The 
present study used a unique design by incorporating a 2-week keto-adaptation 
period followed by 8 weeks of a defined resistance training protocol while following 
a KD diet. However, we reintroduced carbohydrates from weeks 10-11 along with a

decrease in total training volume. This reduction in total training volume is known 
as a tapering phase and is meant to allow for full recovery of both groups.  
Tapering has been shown to elicit increased muscle fiber size up to 11% 
during periods of glycogen depletion induced by training and lower carbohydrate 
intake (25). From weeks 1-10 LBM increased in both the KD and WD groups with no 
differences between conditions. However, our original measurement of LBM 
occurred prior to a physiological state of keto-adaptation. As such, it could be 
postulated that changes in LBM may have been underestimated in the KD condition 
due to lower glycogen stores. In fact, Phinney (17) found resting muscle glycogen 
stores were 50 % lower in a KD vs. a WD group following several weeks of the 
intervention.  It is important to note that previous research by Phinney (17) used an 
endurance model and that it cannot be assumed that muscle glycogen was lower in 
our study without having actually directly measured it.  In fact, in our recent 6-week 
study in rodents we found that muscle glycogen was not significantly different in the 
KD verses the WD despite a several fold higher intake of carbohydrates (23). It is 
also possible that extended periods of nutritional ketosis permit more complete 
metabolic adaptations and improve maintenance of muscle glycogen [29]. As such, it 
is possible that KD promotes the sparing and storage of glycogen to a greater degree 
than a WD.  If this is the case, then it is possible that the reintroduction of 
carbohydrates would result in glycogen super-compensation.  While speculative 
that this was an underlying cause, the KD group continued to increase in LBM from 
weeks 10-11 while the WD plateaued. Moreover, a total delta analysis revealed that 
the change in LBM from weeks 1-11 was greater in the KD than WD condition. While

hypothetical, there are a number of possible mechanisms underlying greater 
improvements for LBM and muscle thickness seen in the KD group over the final 
week period.  First emphasis should be placed on the finding that the KD condition 
gained 5 kg of mass from weeks 10-11.  Of these, 3 kg were driven by changes in 
lean mass.   It has been demonstrated that reintroduction of carbohydrates after 
restricted carbohydrate intake increases muscle glycogen levels above baseline, a 
phenomenon termed glycogen supercompensation (4).  However even with this 
effect, we can speculate, based on the glycogen storage capacity of muscle, that 
likely only 1.0-1.5 kg of LBM would be accounted for by increases in intramuscular 
and liver stores of glycogen and water.  Thus, it is probable that the abrupt, yet not 
unexpected, changes in LBM were primarily driven by drastic changes in water flux 
during the last week of the study.  It is important to emphasize that there are 
profound changes in renal handling of sodium during which would drive a great 
deal of water retention in all tissue following reintroduction of carbohydrates (19). 
Given the probable nature of these assumptions, it is therefore likely that both 
groups gained similar amounts of muscle mass throughout the entire study.  
A great deal of research during weight loss studies demonstrates that KD 
appears to provide a metabolic advantage over carbohydrate based diets (28, 29). 
For example, Volek et al. (27) assigned overweight men to either a low-fat diet (LFD; 
<25% fat) or a very low carbohydrate diet (VLCD; <50g per day) for 12 weeks. Half 
of the subjects in each group performed resistance exercise while the other half 
remained sedentary. The non-exercising VLCD group lost significantly more body fat 
and experienced greater decreases in insulin than the sedentary LFD group. The

greatest decrease in body fat came in the VLCD plus resistance training group. 
Moreover, normal-weight, non-exercising men placed on maintenance calories with 
a KD have lost 3.4 kg of fat mass while gaining 1.2 kg of lean mass (33). Additionally, 
Paoli (15) found that elite gymnasts lost body fat following 4 weeks of KD without 
an alteration in training.  However, it is important to note that subjects in the Paoli 
(15) study had higher protein intake in the KD than WD diets.  Moreover, their 
protein intake provided a relatively greater percentage of the subject’s diets than 
the current study, potentially changing the metabolic outcomes generally seen 
during a standard KD.  To our knowledge, the current study is the first to investigate 
a KD while controlling for training, calories, and protein intake on body fatness in 
resistance-trained males. From weeks 1-10 of training we found that the overall 
decrease in body fat was significantly greater in the KD group compared to the WD 
group. However, after the reintroduction of carbohydrates, the KD group gained 
body fat. This resulted in no differences between groups at the end of week 11.  A 
number of speculations are evident when examining the causes behind these results. 
First, during weeks 1-10, it is likely that the KD group experienced a general shift in 
substrate utilization from glucose to primarily fat. This contention is supported by 
greater overall blood ketone levels in the KD group as compared to the WD group. 
Recent research indicates that the ability to utilize carbohydrate in skeletal muscle 
is down-regulated via an inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (7).  
These changes result in a unique metabolic adaptation, which is advantageous for 
preferential use of fat as fuel.  However, the rapid reintroduction of carbohydrates 
from weeks 10-11 following a long period of the KD appeared to promote rapid

increases in fat mass.  As discussed previously, it is plausible that these abrupt 
changes in fat mass were likely explained by robust changes in water flux from 
weeks 10-11.  Thus, while fat mass increased it is improbable that this was primarily 
driven by lipid accumulation.  
Muscle strength and power are two of the most critical attributes underlying 
success in sport (21). These variables are intimately related and allow athletes to 
excel in their respective roles (3). The results of the present study demonstrated 
that strength increased equally at week 10 and following a one week taper in both 
the KD and WD conditions. Regarding muscle strength, our results agreed with a 
recent study by Paoli et al. (16) who placed elite gymnasts on KD for one month. 
These researchers found no negative effects on strength performance in high level 
athletes. However, the current study found that peak power only increased in the 
WD and not KD from weeks 1-10. Following a one-week reintroduction of 
carbohydrates, the KD group experienced an increase in muscle power which 
negated differences between conditions. Research indicates that short sprints (6 s) 
are highly reliant on fast glycolytic capacity (5). Thus, it is possible that the 
expression of underlying muscular adaptations related to power in the KD group 
was masked by a lack of fast glycolytic capacity at week 10. One limitation to our 
experiment is that we measured power during a Wingate sprint. However, there are 
many other measures of power including those observed during a vertical jump 
activity or following repeated sprinting efforts. Considering that instantaneous 
power is reliant primarily on the phosphagen system, it is plausible that adaptations 
in this measure of power may have been seen by week 10. Moreover, it is also

conceivable that a decrease in initial glycolytic capacity may lead to more sustained 
power output with repeated sprints. In fact, research has clearly indicated that 
higher reliance on glycolysis during the initial sprint is predictive of the greatest 
decay in power with repeated sprints (2, 6). This may be explained by greater 
metabolic stress and/or a greater reliance on oxidative capacity with repeated 
sprints. Specifically, following ten 6-second sprints, individuals decrease reliance on 
glycolysis from 40 to 6 %, while simultaneously increasing reliance on oxidative 
capacity to nearly 40% (2, 6). These results warrant the need for future research in 
the area of instantaneous power measures and repeated sprint ability.   
Currently the major model of rapid bodyweight changes studies occurs in 
weight class restricted sports such as wrestling.  In fact, Franchini et al. (3) showed 
the range of weight loss and regain reported in a 72 hour period is from 2 to 6 kg in 
combat sport athletes.  Intriguingly in these athletes’ strength and power are only 
slightly impacted by these rapid weight changes, at least acutely.  While weight gain 
was also rapid in our study, it is likely that performance changes were more related 
to a taper effects as suggested in past literature (25).   
High fat diets that do not significantly restrict carbohydrates have often been 
found to raise LDL, insulin, and fasting TGs.  As a result, some have speculated that 
the KD can be deleterious to one’s health status and increase markers of metabolic 
syndrome (34). This inference, however, conflates typical “high fat diets” with true 
ketogenic diets, which restrict carbohydrates enough to deplete glycogen stores and 
shift overall metabolic physiology towards fat oxidation.  The detrimental effects of 
high fat diets occur when fats are in the presence of an ample supply of

carbohydrates and insulin (34). Research from Bob Wolfe’s (35) lab has 
demonstrated that fat consumed in the presence of low carbohydrate and insulin 
does not induce insulin resistance or raise plasma TGs.  However, when fats are 
combined with carbohydrates and insulin these deleterious effects are evident (35). 
As such, the KD does not have a negative impact on blood lipid profile. In fact, the KD 
has elicited favorable effects on blood lipid profile in obese individuals by increasing 
HDL while decreasing TGs and insulin (32). Ketogenic dieting lowers LDL if weight 
loss is present (32), but typically has little effect on LDL if weight remains 
unchanged (32). Moreover, men and women placed on a KD at maintenance calories 
increased HDL and decreased insulin levels (32). In general, these results agreed 
with our findings, which demonstrated no changes in LDL or total cholesterol at 
weeks 10 and 11, but had a tendency for HDL to increase in the KD condition. While 
plasma TGs were maintained at week 10 relative to baseline in the KD, they 
increased from weeks 10-11. The latter may be explained by an impaired ability to 
handle rapid reintroduction of carbohydrate following 10 weeks of a high fat diet. 
Specifically, it is possible that a rapid re-introduction of carbohydrates prevented 
the ability to oxidize plasma TGs. As a result, subjects experienced a temporary 
increase in plasma TGs. These data indicate that those following a KD who decide to 
transition back to a WD should do so conservatively in order to allow for full 
adaptation.   
 
Previous research has found that the KD can induce favorable shifts in 
anabolic hormone status. For example, total testosterone decreased by as much as 
30% in calorically restricted rats on a WD, but remained unchanged in calorically

restricted rats on a KD(9). This may be, in part, due to the high amount of fat and 
increased lipid bioavailability necessary for the production of the anabolic hormone 
testosterone. Moreover, human trials have demonstrated strong positive 
relationships between dietary saturated fat and plasma testosterone levels (30). 
These results are in agreement with the present findings which indicate increases in 
testosterone for subjects on a KD compared to those on a WD.  Future research 
should investigate the effect of caloric restriction while using a KD and high 
intensity resistance training on the ability to preserve anabolic hormonal levels.   
 
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 
The present study was the first to investigate the effects of KD combined with 
resistance training in trained athletes. Our results indicate KD can be advantageous 
for body composition with equal benefits in the muscle performance as compared to 
a WD. In addition, KD seems to have favorable changes in anabolic hormone status 
without negatively affecting blood lipid profile. However, as with past research, our 
study indicates that rapid reintroduction of carbohydrates following a prolonged 
period of KD may be disadvantageous for body fatness and TGs. Future research 
should examine different carbohydrate reintroduction strategies in order to avoid 
the detrimental effects of rapid reintroduction.
