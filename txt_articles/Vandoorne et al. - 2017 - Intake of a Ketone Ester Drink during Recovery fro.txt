Purpose: Ketone bodies are energy substrates produced by the liver during prolonged
fasting or low-carbohydrate diet. The ingestion of a ketone ester (KE) rapidly increases
blood ketone levels independent of nutritional status. KE has recently been shown to
improve exercise performance, but whether it can also promote post-exercise muscle
protein or glycogen synthesis is unknown.
Methods:
Eight healthy trained males participated in a randomized double-blind
placebo-controlled crossover study. In each session, subjects undertook a bout of
intense one-leg glycogen-depleting exercise followed by a 5-h recovery period during
which they ingested a protein/carbohydrate mixture. Additionally, subjects ingested a
ketone ester (KE) or an isocaloric placebo (PL).
Results:
KE intake did not affect muscle glycogen resynthesis, but more rapidly
lowered post-exercise AMPK phosphorylation and resulted in higher mTORC1 activation,
as evidenced by the higher phosphorylation of its main downstream targets S6K1
and 4E-BP1. As enhanced mTORC1 activation following KE suggests higher protein
synthesis rates, we used myogenic C2C12 cells to further confirm that ketone bodies
increase both leucine-mediated mTORC1 activation and protein synthesis in muscle
cells.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that adding KE to a standard post-exercise recovery
beverage enhances the post-exercise activation of mTORC1 but does not affect
muscle glycogen resynthesis in young healthy volunteers. In vitro, we confirmed that
ketone bodies potentiate the increase in mTORC1 activation and protein synthesis
in leucine-stimulated myotubes. Whether, chronic oral KE intake during recovery from
exercise can facilitate training-induced muscular adaptation and remodeling need to be
further investigated.

Ketone-Ester Supplementation following Exercise
INTRODUCTION
Skeletal muscle tissue plays a pivotal role in the regulation of
whole body metabolism, functional work capacity, and exercise
performance (Zurlo et al., 1994; Egan and Zierath, 2013). While
no medicine has proven to be more efficient than exercise
to improve muscle function (Booth et al., 2000), exercise-
nutrition interactions significantly impact on energy substrate
replenishment and on muscle remodeling and repair post-
exercise (Beelen et al., 2010; Hawley et al., 2011). During recovery
from exercise, amino acid intake is required to stimulate muscle
protein synthesis (Biolo et al., 1997; Churchward-Venne et al.,
2012), whilst high-rate carbohydrate intake promotes resynthesis
of glycogen stores (Costill et al., 1981; Burke et al., 2016).
Furthermore, improving the (nutritional) conditions under
which exercise promotes muscle protein synthesis is not only
important for athletes, but also in clinical conditions requiring
enhanced anabolic response in patients who are unable to
perform high-intensity exercise.
Skeletal muscle protein synthesis following exercise is mainly
regulated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) (Bodine et al., 2001; Schiaffino and Mammucari,
2011). mTORC1 regulates protein translation initiation and
elongation via phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6
kinase 1 (S6K1) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding
protein 1 (4E-BP1) (Burnett et al., 1998). Muscle contractions per
se activate mTORC1 in a stress and/or mechanic-related manner,
but also the intake of proteins activates mTORC1 and protein
synthesis (Morton et al., 2015). On the other hand, as protein
synthesis is a high ATP-consuming process, mTORC1 activity is
inhibited during periods of energetic stress by the AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK; Bolster et al., 2002; Dreyer et al., 2006).
AMPK is the principal energy sensor in muscle cells and is
activated by decreased energy levels during and after contractions
(Hardie, 2011). AMPK promotes energy substrate catabolism to
generate ATP, and at the same time inhibits anabolic processes
requiring ATP, in order to preserve energy status (Gwinn et al.,
2008). During and after strenuous exercise, activation of AMPK is
responsible for the delayed activation of muscle protein synthesis
(Dreyer et al., 2006; Thomson et al., 2008). Rapid restoration of
muscle energy balance to de-activate AMPK is important in that
it enhances post-exercise mTORC1 activation, protein synthesis
and eventually training-induced muscle remodeling.
Muscle glycogen is the primary fuel for muscle contractions
during high-intensity endurance exercise. Glycogen stores
are small relative to the total energy need in prolonged
exercise, which makes initial muscle glycogen content an
important determinant of performance (Hawley et al., 1997).
Hence, maximizing muscle glycogen resynthesis is crucial for

maintenance of endurance exercise performance whenever time
for recovery between events is short relative to the time needed
to full glycogen repletion (Burke et al., 2016).
Acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) are the
main ketone bodies (KB) produced in the liver in response to low
blood glucose and insulin levels, and play a critical role in survival
during episodes of fasting. Three weeks of starvation result in
blood ketone levels of up to ∼6 mM (Cahill, 2006). Alternatively,
a strict ketogenic diet containing low carbohydrate, low protein,
but high fat (Cahill and Veech, 2003), can also elevate circulating
KB levels to ∼1–2 mM within 2–4 days (Pinckaers et al., 2016).
Under those conditions, KB serve as circulating energy substrates
for metabolic tissues such as the brain (Kashiwaya et al., 2010),
cardiac (Nakatani et al., 2015), and skeletal muscle (Cahill, 2006).
Mechanistically, KB fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle after
being converted to acetyl-coenzyme A (Shi and Tu, 2015; Murray
et al., 2016), and prevent the depletion of carbohydrate stores
as well as the breakdown of muscle contractile proteins for
gluconeogenesis and TCA cycle anaplerosis. While KB in this
way could potentially affect performance, the dietary conditions
needed to stimulate endogenous KB synthesis are not compatible
with optimal performance in most sports (Cox and Clarke,
2014). Recently, the ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-
3-hydroxybutyrate (hereafter referred to as KE) has emerged as
an alternative approach to raise blood KB levels in the absence of
any other dietary modification. Ingestion of KE increases blood
ketone appearance within minutes of consumption (Clarke et al.,
2012b), leading to circulating concentrations similar to those
observed in prolonged fasting, even in the presence of elevated
blood insulin levels (Clarke et al., 2012b; Cox et al., 2016). KE
enhanced endurance exercise performance in athletes, at least
partly because KB act as an alternative substrate for oxidative
phosphorylation (Cox et al., 2016). Interestingly, by reducing the
need for glucose-derived ATP production, KE also resulted in
glycogen sparing during exercise (Cox et al., 2016).
Against the above background, we decided to investigate
whether nutritional ketosis, induced via KE ingestion, could
enhance markers of muscle protein synthesis and/or glycogen
resynthesis during recovery from strenuous exercise. While
ingestion of KE did not increase muscle glycogen resynthesis, it
increased activation of muscle protein synthesis markers. Using
an in vitro strategy, we confirmed that KB potentiated leucine-
mediated mTORC1 activation and that this resulted into higher
rate of leucine-mediated protein synthesis. Altogether, our data
show that KE enhances mTORC1 activation during recovery
from exercise but does not affect muscle glycogen resynthesis in
human muscle.
METHODS
This work involved both a study in healthy human volunteers and
a series of in vitro experiments in skeletal muscle myotubes.
Study in Healthy Volunteers
Subjects
Eight healthy, young male volunteers [height: 181.9 ± 1.8 cm;
body weight (BW): 76.6 ± 2.7 kg; body mass index: 22.9 ± 0.7

kg/m2; age: 20–24 years old; one repetition maximum (1RM):
75 ± 1.25 kg] participated in the study, which was approved by
the KU Leuven Biomedical Ethics Committee (B322201316517),
and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects were
involved in regular physical activity, but none participated in elite
competitive sports. Potential participants were screened using
a health questionnaire and underwent a medical examination,
including a resting ECG, prior to participation in this study.
Subjects were instructed not to change their normal diet
or physical activity level during the study, and gave their
written consent after having been informed of all experimental
procedures and risks associated with the experiments. During
the study, one subject dropped-out due to a knee-injury that was
unrelated to the study protocol. The subject was excluded from
all analysis.
Study Design (Figure 1)
The study was of a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled
crossover study design involving two experimental sessions with
a 3-week washout period in between. Each experimental session
consisted of a glycogen-depleting exercise protocol with the
right leg, followed by a 5 h recovery period during which a
high-dose protein-carbohydrate mixture was administered. In
addition, in one experimental condition the subjects received
a KE drink during the recovery period, whilst in the other
condition they received an isocaloric PL drink (Clarke et al.,
2012b). Two weeks before the start of the study, the subjects
participated in two preliminary sessions with a 1-week interval
in between to become familiar with the experimental procedures
and to adjust the individual exercise workloads to be used in
the experimental sessions. These sessions were also used to
determine the 1-repetition-maximum (1RM) for knee-extension
exercise.
Experimental Sessions
The evening before each experimental session the subjects
reported to the laboratory for a standardized dinner (18 kcal·kg−1
BW, 70% carbohydrates, 15% protein, 15% fat). Next morning,
they received a standardized breakfast (10 kcal·kg−1 BW, 70%
carbohydrates, 18% protein, 12% fat) and, later lunch (10
kcal·kg−1 BW, 70% carbohydrates, 18% protein, 12% fat). After
lunch the subjects rested for 2 h in a comfortable chair before
blood samples were taken from both an earlobe (capillary blood)
and an arm vein (Venoject, Tokyo, Japan). A percutaneous needle
biopsy for baseline determinations was then taken from m. vastus
lateralis in the left leg as described below. Post-exercise biopsies
later in the experiment were taken from the other leg, to limit
artifacts due to multiple biopsies in the same muscle belly (Van
Thienen et al., 2014). Thereafter, warming-up was started by
unilateral cycling (50-70-90 Watt, 4 min each) with the right leg
on a cycle ergometer (Avantronic Cyclus II, Leipzig, Germany),
followed by 2 series of 30 unilateral knee-extensions at 10%
of 1RM on a self-constructed isokinetic dynamometer (Hespel
et al., 2001). The subjects then started an intermittent exercise
protocol aimed to deplete muscle glycogen in the right leg by
unilateral knee-extensions (70◦–130◦ knee-angle) at a rate of
0.5 Hz. Subjects first performed an exercise bout, during which
they produced as high as possible a mean power output for
5 min. Thereafter they did 9 series of 30 knee-extensions at 30%
of 1RM, followed by 5 series of 6 contractions at 70% of 1RM.
The contraction series were interspersed by 30 s passive rest
intervals. Immediately after the last exercise a capillary blood
sample was taken from the earlobe, and a percutaneous needle

biopsy was taken from m. vastus lateralis. Following this post-
exercise biopsy, the subjects actively recovered by unilateral
cycling for 20 min at 50 Watt (Avantronic Cyclus II, Leipzig,
Germany), after which they rested in a comfortable chair in the
laboratory till 5 h post-exercise. After 90 min and 5 h of recovery
another needle biopsy was taken from m. vastus lateralis. During
recovery capillary blood samples from the earlobe were taken at
30-min intervals, and a venous sample was collected from an
arm vein at 90 min and 5 h. At the end of each experimental
session, the subjects filled out a questionnaire to assess gastro-
intestinal tolerance (adapted from Pfeiffer et al., 2009). The
questionnaire was organized in three sections. Upper abdominal
problems (reflux, bloating, nausea, vomiting); lower abdominal
problems (cramps, flatulence, abdominal pain, diarrhea); and
systemic problems (dizziness, headache, muscle cramp, urge to
urinate).
Nutritional Supplementation during Recovery
In order to elicit optimal rates of muscle protein and glycogen
synthesis after exercise, subjects received a high-dose protein–
carbohydrate drink throughout the recovery period (Table 1).
These drinks (250 ml aliquots) were ingested at 30-min
intervals starting immediately after exercise and delivered 1
g·kg−1 BW·h−1 carbohydrates (65% maltodextrin, 35% dextrose)
plus 0.3 g·kg−1 BW·h−1 hydrolyzed whey-protein concentrate
(Body&Fit, Heerenveen, The Netherlands) yielding a total
leucine intake of 12.1 ± 0.4 g per person during the 5 h recovery
period. In one session, the subjects also drank a KE supplement
[>96% (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] to elevate
circulating plasma ketone concentrations (Clarke et al., 2012a,b;
Cox et al., 2016). In the other session, they received an isocaloric
PL supplement containing >96% long chain triglycerides and
which was similar to KE in taste and appearance, as described
previously (Cox et al., 2016). Immediately after exercise, subjects
received 0.5 g·kg−1 BW KE/PL (38 ± 1.4 mL). Thereafter,
the KE/PL was delivered at a rate of 0.25 g·kg−1 BW·h−1
(19 ± 0.7 mL). This regimen was chosen to maintain high
circulating plasma ketone concentrations throughout recovery
(Clarke et al., 2012b).
Analysis of Blood Samples
Capillary blood samples were immediately assayed for blood
glucose and β-hydroxybutyrate (Glucomen Lx plus-meter with
Lx glucose or Lx β-ketone strips, Menarini Diagnostics, Firenze,
Italy), and blood lactate concentrations (Lactate-Pro 2, Arkray,
Kyoto, Japan). The detection limits for β-hydroxybutyrate
were 0.1–8.0 millimolar (mM). Venous blood samples were
immediately centrifuged to separate plasma which was stored
at −80◦C until assayed by ELISA for insulin concentration
using a commercially available kit (catalog number: 10-1132-01,
Mercodia Uppsala, Sweden).
Muscle Biopsy Procedure
Muscle biopsies were obtained immediately before and after
exercise and 90 and 300 min post-exercise from the vastus
lateralis of the quadriceps muscle under local anesthetic (2%
xylocaine without epinephrine, 1 mL subcutaneously) using a
Bergström-type needle. After removal of visible blood and non-
muscle material, the muscle biopsy was frozen in isopentane
cooled in liquid nitrogen. After freezing, the muscle samples were
immediately stored at −80◦C until later analysis.
Analysis of Muscle Samples
Muscle glycogen was measured as glucose residues after acid
hydrolysis in freeze-dried muscle tissue using a standard
enzymatic
fluorometric
assay
(Lowry
and
Passonneau,
1972). Western blots were performed as detailed previously
(Masschelein et al., 2014). In brief, frozen muscle tissue was
homogenized with a Polytron mixer (Polytron Technologies,
Taoyuan City, Taiwan) in ice-cold lysis buffer [1:10, w/v; 50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0; 270 mM sucrose; 5 mM EGTA; 1 mM
EDTA; 1 mM sodium orthovanadate; 50 mM glycerophosphate;
5 mM sodium pyrophosphate; 50 mM sodium fluoride; 1 mM
dithiothreitol; 0.1% Triton X-100; and a complete protease
inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science, Vilvoorde, Belgium)].
Homogenates were then centrifuged and supernatant was
collected and stored immediately at −80◦C. The protein
concentration was measured using a DC protein assay kit
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Nazareth, Belgium). Proteins (15–45 µg)
were separated by SDS-PAGE (8–12% gels) and transferred
to
polyvinylidene
difluoride
membranes.
Subsequently,
membranes were blocked in TBS-T (tris-buffered saline with
Tween-20) containing 5% non-fat milk for 1 h. The following
antibodies were added and incubated overnight at 4◦C in TBS-T
containing 5% BSA (1:1,000): phospho-Akt/PKB Ser473, total
Akt/PKB, phospho-AMPK Thr172, total AMPK, phospho-S6K1
Thr389, total S6K1, total 4E-BP1 (Cell Signaling, Leiden, The
Netherlands). Membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room
temperature in secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase (1:5,000) in TBS-T containing 5% non-fat milk.
Membranes were scanned and quantified with Gene Snap and
Gene Tools software (Syngene, Cambridge, UK), respectively.
Results are presented as the ratio protein of interest/total form
or as the ratio phosphorylated γ form/total signal. Values were

In vitro Experiments in Myoblasts
C2C12 murine skeletal muscle myoblasts (ATCC, Manassas, US)
were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Merelbeke, Belgium)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin
and 50 µg/ml streptomycin at 37◦C and 5% CO2. At 80%
confluence, myogenic differentiation was induced by changing
the growth medium to DMEM supplemented with 2% horse
serum, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin. After 96 h
of differentiation, plates were incubated for 30 min in DMEM
containing 5.0 mM glucose and lacking leucine (Sigma-Aldrich,
Bornem, Belgium). Next, cells were incubated with leucine
(1.5 mM), 3-hydroxybutyrate/ hydroxybutyric acid (4 mM)
and lithium-acetoacetate (1.4 mM), alone or in combination.
Since KE has been shown to raise blood βHB:AcAc levels in
a 4:1 ratio (Clarke et al., 2012b), the concentrations used in
our in vitro experiments closely resemble the in vivo setting.
Unstimulated cells served as control. After 30 min of incubation,
cells were lysed and prepared for western blotting as described
above. Western blot analyses were performed for, total 4E-BP1
p-S6K1Thr389 and total S6K1. Antibodies used were identical
as for the in vivo experiments. In a follow-up experiment, 1
µM puromycin, a structural analog of tyrosyl-tRNA, was added
to the wells during 30 min incubation at 5 mM leucine or 1.5
mM leucine, alone or together with 4 mM 3-hydroxybutyrate
and 1.4 mM lithium-acetoacetate. Subsequently, cells were lysed
and prepared for western blotting as described above. Western
blot analyses were performed using an anti-puromycin antibody
(Merck, Overijse, Belgium) diluted 1:25,000 in TBS-T containing
5% non-fat milk, to detect puromycin incorporation into
nascent peptide chains (Goodman et al., 2011). Results are
reported as the ratio puromycine/coomassie blue. Values were
presented relative to the mean value of the unstimulated
condition. All experiments were repeated at least once and
each experiment consisted of three technical replicates. Leucine,
lithium-acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Bornem, Belgium).
Statistics
Differences between mean values over time and between
conditions for the study in healthy volunteers were analyzed by
2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (GraphPad Prism,
La Jolla California, USA), using time and treatment as factors.
When significant, Sidak’s multi comparison test was used as a
post-hoc test. In the figures, ∗ indicates significance for KE vs. PL
within a time point, and # indicates significance vs. time point
0 within a treatment. A supplementary table (Supplementary
Table 1) with the complete overview of statistical analyses has
been included in this manuscript. For in vitro experiments, a one-
way ANOVA was performed to assess the statistical significance
of differences between conditions (GraphPad Prism, La Jolla
California USA). When appropriate, a Tukey t-test was used
as a post-hoc test. In the figures, ∗ indicates significance vs.
leucine stimulated condition, and # indicates significance vs.
unstimulated condition. A supplementary table (Supplementary

A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are
presented as mean ± SEM.
RESULTS
Study in Healthy Volunteers
Blood Biochemistry
Effect of KE intake on blood β-hydroxybutyrate (Figure 2)
Blood β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) was undetectable (<0.01 mM)
in PL and at baseline in KE (p < 0.05). Within 30 min of KE
intake, blood βHB levels increased to 2.9 ± 0.3 mM with KE
drinks every 60 min, gradually increased during the recovery
period to reach a peak of 4.3 ± 0.5 mM at 4 h (p < 0.05 vs.
30 min). Blood βHB was consistently elevated from the start to
the end of the recovery period, in every subject (mean:4.2 mM;
range: 3.3–6.3 mM).
Effect of nutritional ketosis on blood glucose, insulin, and
lactate (Figure 3)
Due to the high-dose carbohydrate intake blood glucose rapidly
increased following exercise (p < 0.05), reaching peak levels
in both experimental conditions at 1 h. After 1 h, despite
carbohydrate drinks every 30 min, blood glucose gradually
returned toward the baseline (p < 0.05) although blood
glucose was consistently (∼1 mM) lower in KE (p < 0.05)
compared with PL. Nonetheless, plasma insulin concentrations
were similar between KE and PL throughout the experiment.
Exercise decreased plasma insulin from ∼15 mU·l−1 at baseline
to ∼3 mU·l−1 (p < 0.05) immediately post-exercise, after which
recovery insulin increased (p < 0.05) to ∼25 mU·l−1 at both 90

Muscle Biochemistry
Effect of nutritional ketosis on the Akt/mTORC1 pathway
(Figure 4)
Upstream of mTORC1 and unaltered by KE, the phosphorylation
status of Akt at Ser473 was decreased by exercise (p < 0.05),
and returned to baseline within 90 min of recovery. To assess
mTORC1 activity, we assessed the phosphorylation status of
P70S6k1 at Thr389 (p-S6K1Thr389), and the percentage of 4E-BP1
in the phosphorylated γ-form (4E-BP1%γ), two of its main
downstream targets involved in protein synthesis. Exercise
decreased 4E-BP1%γ (p < 0.05), but not p-S6K1Thr389, for
both KE and PL. During recovery, p-S6K1Thr389 and 4E-BP1%γ
gradually increased (p < 0.05), with the increase greater in KE
than in PL. Thus, compared with PL at the end of the 5 h recovery
period, p-S6K1Thr389 (∼2.5-fold) and 4E-BP1%γ (∼60%) were
higher in KE (p < 0.05). Total protein contents of Akt, S6K1,
and 4E-BP1 were not different between groups, nor exhibited a
change across time.
Effect of nutritional ketosis on AMPKThr172 phosphorylation
(Figure 5)
Exercise did not significantly increase (p = 0.08) AMPK
phosphorylation at Thr172 (p-AMPKThr172). p-AMPKThr172 in
KE, but not in PL, was the same as baseline within 90 min of
recovery, with lower p-AMPKThr172 in KE than in PL (p < 0.05).
At the end of the recovery period, p-AMPKThr172 was baseline for
both KE and PL. Total protein content of AMPK was not different
between groups, nor exhibited a change across time.
Effect of nutritional ketosis on muscle glycogen (Figure 6)
Initial muscle glycogen content was 432 ± 35 µmol g−1 dry
weight in PL, vs. 437 ± 8 µmol g−1 dry weight in KE. Exercise
depleted muscle glycogen by ∼60% (p < 0.05) to ∼170 ± 22
and 183 ± 21 µmol. g−1 dry weight in PL and KE, respectively.
Post-exercise glycogen resynthesis during the 5 h recovery period
returned muscle glycogen contents to ∼274 ± 23 in KE vs.
276 ± 20 µmol. g-1 dry weight in PL. There were no differences
between PL and KE at any time.
Gastrointestinal Tolerance
Compared with PL (6 ± 2 out of a maximum of 32), adverse
upper abdominal discomfort scored higher in KE (17 ± 2,
p < 0.05). Lower abdominal and systemic discomfort was
similar between the groups. Due to upper abdominal discomfort
in KE, four subjects did not ingest supplements beyond 4 h
of recovery. Nonetheless, plasma βHB, blood glucose and
plasma insulin levels were unaffected, i.e., values were identical
between subgroups exhibiting upper abdominal discomfort vs.
no symptoms.

Leucine alone increased p-S6K1Thr389 ∼3-fold and 4E-BP1%γ
by 51% (p<0.05). Incubation with either acetoacetate or βHB
alone did not increase p-S6K1Thr389 or 4E-BP1%γ, but the
combination of both ketone bodies increased p-S6K1Thr389 ∼
3-fold and 4E-BP1%γ by 51% (p < 0.05). The addition of either
acetoacetate or βHB with leucine elevated p-S6K1Thr389 4-fold
and 4E-BP1%γ 2-fold (p < 0.05). Leucine + acetoacetate +
βHB increased p-S6K1Thr389 ∼ 6-fold and 4E-BP1%γ 2-fold vs
baseline, more than any of the substrates alone (p < 0.05).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated the potential of nutritional
ketosis to stimulate markers of post-exercise muscle protein
and glycogen synthesis, since both may enhance long-term
training adaptations and facilitate muscle recovery from intense
exercise (Hawley et al., 2011). We found that oral KE
ingestion increased mTORC1 activation in human skeletal
muscle following strenuous exercise, but left muscle glycogen
resynthesis unaffected. To explore whether the increase in
mTORC1 activation leads to increased protein synthesis, we
subsequently performed a set of in vitro experiments using C2C12
myotubes. We confirmed that ketone bodies stimulated mTORC1
activity and showed that this leads to enhanced leucine-mediated
muscle protein synthesis. Taken together, our results indicate that
KE enhances the anabolic response to both exercise and protein
ingestion but does not affect glycogen resynthesis.
We aimed to elevate plasma ketone concentrations using
intermittent (60 min) drinks of a novel oral ketone ester (Clarke
et al., 2012b) during the initial 5 h of recovery following a
glycogen-depleting maximal exercise bout. In conjunction with
KE, we also administered a mixture containing whey protein and
carbohydrates in a quantity that is considered to elicit maximal
rates of post-exercise muscle protein (Morton et al., 2015) and
glycogen synthesis (Burke et al., 2016), because we wanted to
explore whether KE could add to the recommended nutritional
procedures for stimulation of muscle recovery. KE increased
blood βHB concentration to ∼3–5 mM within 30 min after the
first drink to remain elevated to the end of the recovery period in
all subjects. As KE raises blood βHB:AcAc levels in a 4:1 ratio
(Clarke et al., 2012b) total plasma KB concentrations above 6
mM are conceivable, levels similar to those reported after several
weeks of starvation (Cahill, 2006).
We did not detect any rise in post-exercise ketone levels in
the PL condition. Post-exercise ketosis is inversely correlated to
liver glycogen content (Adams and Koeslag, 1988), which in short
one-leg postprandial exercise protocols is not depleted (Gonzalez
et al., 2016). In addition, post-exercise nutritional intake, causing
hyperinsulinemia, also reduces endogenous ketosis (Koeslag,
1982; Impey et al., 2016). Therefore, in PL post-exercise ketosis
is unlikely to have significantly contributed to muscle recovery.

Muscle
protein
synthesis
following
exercise
is
mainly
controlled by mTORC1 (Bodine et al., 2001; Schiaffino and
Mammucari, 2011). Assessment of the phosphorylation status
of the mTORC1 substrates S6K1 and 4EBP1 is a reliable
readout of mTORC1 activity and is closely linked to muscle
hypertrophy both in humans (Terzis et al., 2008) and mice
(Baar and Esser, 1999). Moreover, S6K1 activation is required
to increase muscle force (Marabita et al., 2016). We found the
ingestion of KE to increase mTORC1 activity during recovery
from exercise, as indicated by higher phosphorylation status of
S6K1 and 4EBP1 (Figure 4). While evaluation of muscle protein
synthesis via key proteins involved in protein translation has
been shown to be a reliable procedure (Baar and Esser, 1999;
Bodine et al., 2001; Terzis et al., 2008; Drummond et al., 2009), a
dissociation between S6K1/4EBP-1 phosphorylation and muscle
protein synthesis might still be possible (Greenhaff et al., 2008).
Since our study protocol did not allow us to assess muscle protein
synthesis rates in human subjects in vivo, we decided to set up
a series of in vitro experiments using C2C12 myotubes. First,
we confirmed that KB potentiate mTORC1 signaling following
leucine stimulation (Figure 7). Subsequently, we found that the
increase in mTORC1 activity was reflected by increased protein
synthesis in muscle cells in vitro (Figure 8). While our in vitro
data show the ability of KB to potentiate leucine-mediated
protein synthesis in myotubes, further human studies using stable
isotope tracers need to confirm whether or not KE can also
promote muscle protein synthesis in humans.
The ability for KE to promote mTORC1 activity occurred in
the absence of increased blood insulin levels and downstream
insulin signaling pathway. Moreover, we could reproduce these
effects using strictly controlled in vitro settings. This indicates
that the effect of KE/KB is independent of growth factor signaling
as well as potential other systemic effects induced by ketosis
(Egan and D’Agostino, 2016; Holdsworth et al., 2016).
While we for the first time show that KE stimulates mTORC1
signaling post-exercise against the background of high-rate
protein plus carbohydrate intake in humans, it is well established
that KB modulate muscle protein metabolism during starvation.
When glucose availability is low, KB replace glucose as the
primary brain fuel, and therefore suppresses the need for muscle
proteolysis to provide gluconeogenic precursors (Sherwin et al.,
1975; Owen, 2005). Furthermore, hyperketonaemia induced by
intravenous infusions of a ketone salt after an overnight fast,
decreased leucine oxidation and increased protein synthesis in
humans (Nair et al., 1988). The direct effect of KB on protein
synthesis rates in muscle has only been explored in a limited
number of ex vivo studies. One study found physiological
concentrations of KB without amino acids in the incubation
medium not to stimulate protein synthesis in myocytes (Tischler
et al., 1982).
Another ex vivo study tested the effect of either 4 mM βHB or 4
mM AcAc in chicken muscles and reported a decrease in protein
synthesis. However, raising glutamine availability restored
protein synthesis (Wu and Thompson, 1990). By analogy, our
results show a synergistic effect of physiological concentrations
of ketone bodies and leucine on S6K1 phosphorylation (Figure 7)
and a direct effect of ketone bodies on leucine-mediated protein
synthesis (Figure 8). Taken together these results indicate the
potential of ketone bodies to stimulate muscle protein anabolism.
Although we are unable to identify the precise mechanism
responsible for enhanced muscle protein synthesis with KE,
it is known that skeletal muscle protein synthesis is reduced
when energy homeostasis is impaired (Hardie, 2011). Following

high-intensity exercise, activation of AMPK is responsible for
the delayed activation of muscle protein synthesis (Dreyer et al.,
2006; Thomson et al., 2008). Rapid restoration of muscle energy
balance to de-activate AMPK is therefore important to initiate
post-exercise mTORC1 activation and protein synthesis. KE
ingestion markedly promoted the decrease in AMPK activation
early during recovery, potentially via serving as an additional
energy substrate for oxidative ATP production (Cox et al., 2016;
Murray et al., 2016) which might allow faster recovery of energy
homeostasis and facilitate mTORC1 activation.
Nutritional ketosis was recently shown to alter substrate
competition during endurance exercise and to reduce glycolysis,
thereby preserving glycogen availability (Cox et al., 2016). Early
experiments in dogs and rats have shown that ketosis can

stimulate muscle glucose uptake (Madison et al., 1964) as well
as glycogen storage (Maizels et al., 1977). Furthermore, ketosis
generated by either a chronic high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet
(Phinney et al., 1983) or by KB intake (Cox et al., 2016)
decreased glycogen breakdown both at rest (Cox et al., 2016)
and during exercise (Phinney et al., 1983; Cox et al., 2016). On
the other hand, inducing ketosis by adhering to a ketogenic
diet did not affect glycogen repletion patterns after a 3-h run
(Volek et al., 2016). Based on these data, we hypothesized
that during recovery from high-intensity exercise, KE ingestion
could promote glycogen resynthesis by reducing disposal of
glucose units via glycolytic breakdown. Suppression of glycolysis
increases glucose-6-phosphate availability, which is a potent
stimulator of the glycogen synthase enzyme (Jensen and Richter,
2012). However, contrary to our hypothesis, we found KE not
to affect glycogen resynthesis during the 5 h recovery period.
These data are in apparent contradiction with the results of
another study in which KE increased muscle glycogen resynthesis
following glycogen-depleting exercise (Holdsworth et al., 2016).
In this study, however, CHO was delivered intravenously during
a 2 h hyperglycaemic clamp. Under those conditions, KE
ingestion in combination with carbohydrates resulted in 2-fold
higher plasma insulin levels compared to carbohydrates alone.
This was conceivably due to stimulation of pancreatic insulin
secretion by high circulating plasma KB (Balasse et al., 1970;
Beylot et al., 1986). Conversely, high-rate carbohydrate intake in
conjunction with proteins in the conditions of the current study
resulted in substantially higher plasma insulin levels than in the
aforementioned studies due to the synergistic action of glucose
and amino acids on pancreatic insulin release (Floyd et al., 1970).
In addition, plasma insulin was identical between KE and PL
(Figure 3A).
In the current study, subjects ingested 1.5 g·kg−1 BW
KE, concentrations that have been reported previously to
efficiently enhance blood ketone levels over longer time periods
(Clarke et al., 2012b; Cox et al., 2016). In agreement with
these studies, intermittent ingestion of KE with a protein-
carbohydrate mixture resulted in blood βHB levels of ∼5
mM but also resulted in gastrointestinal discomfort in half
of the subjects. Gastrointestinal issues have been reported
before under nutritional conditions not involving concomitant
high-rate protein and carbohydrate intake (Clarke et al.,
2012b). Although we cannot exclude that GI discomfort
might have affected our experiment, biochemical measurements
and circulating concentrations of βHB, glucose, and insulin
were identical between subjects experiencing GI distress and
subjects with adequate GI comfort. Future studies will need
to elucidate more optimal dosing strategies to maintain the
effect of KE on muscle protein synthesis in the absence of GI
complaints.
In conclusion, while ingestion of KE did not increase muscle
glycogen resynthesis, it markedly increased mTORC1 signaling
following high-intensity exercise. Using C2C12 myotubes, we
confirmed that KB potentiated leucine mediated mTORC1
activation and that this resulted into higher leucine-mediated
protein ynthesis. Our results indicate that KE enhances the
anabolic response to both exercise and protein ingestion but does
not affect muscle glycogen synthesis, suggesting that it might
become an attractive nutritional strategy to increase training-
induced muscle remodeling and adaptation.
