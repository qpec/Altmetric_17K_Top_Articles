Abstract
Objective: To review the available literature on the association between
consumption of ultra-processed foods and body fat during childhood and
adolescence.
Design: A systematic review was conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science and
LILACS databases. Studies that evaluated the association between consumption of
ultra-processed food (exposure) and body fat (outcome) during childhood and
adolescence were eligible.
Subjects: Healthy children and adolescents.
Results: Twenty-six studies that evaluated groups of ultra-processed foods (such as
snacks, fast foods, junk foods and convenience foods) or specific ultra-processed
foods (soft drinks/sweetened beverages, sweets, chocolate and ready-to-eat
cereals) were selected. Most of the studies (n 15) had a cohort design.
Consumption was generally evaluated by means of FFQ or food records; and
body composition, by means of double indirect methods (bioelectrical impedance
analysis and skinfolds). Most of the studies that evaluated consumption of groups
of ultra-processed foods and soft drinks/sweetened beverages found positive
associations with body fat.
Conclusions: Our review showed that most studies have found positive associations
between consumption of ultra-processed food and body fat during childhood and
adolescence. There is a need to use a standardized classification that considers the
level of food processing to promote comparability between studies.

Adolescence
Childhood and adolescent obesity has presented a growing
prevalence over the last three decades(1). Over the same
period, modifications to how foods are produced and
increasing availability of transportation facilities have been
observed, characterizing an ‘obesogenic’ environment(2)
with increasing prevalence of non-healthy eating habits(3)
and decreasing prevalence of physical activity(4). The diet-
ary profile of populations within this scenario has become
characterized by high energy density, in which foods rich in
fibre have been replaced by products rich in fat and sugars,
with a high level of processing(3,5).
A recent food classification (NOVA) based on the extent
and purpose of industrial food processing has divided
foods into four groups: unprocessed or minimally pro-
cessed foods; processed culinary ingredients; processed
foods; and ultra-processed foods. This last category
comprises a group of industrial formulations that are
manufactured using several ingredients and a series of
processes(6–9). Most of these products contain little or no
whole food. They are ready-to-consume or ready-to-heat
and thus require little or no culinary preparation, which
makes them easily accessible and convenient. Typically,
they are combined with sophisticated use of additives, to
make them durable and hyper-palatable. However, they
have very low nutritional quality and their consumption
tends to limit consumption of unprocessed or minimally
processed foods(6–9).
Consumption of ultra-processed foods has been pointed
out as a risk factor for increasing obesity, as measured by
BMI, among both adolescents and adults(10,11). Moreover,
it has been shown in the literature that individuals who are
obese at an early age tend to remain obese throughout

 life(12). Considering the growing prevalence of obesity and
the consumption of ultra-processed foods worldwide, the
objective of the present systematic review was to identify
papers on the association between consumption of
ultra-processed food and body fat during childhood and
adolescence.
Methods
Search strategy
The search was performed in two worldwide electronic
databases (PubMed and Web of Science) and in a Latin
American and Caribbean database (LILACS). Terms relating
to body composition and to consumption of ultra-processed
foods were used. The search key was composed of com-
binations of the following terms: (‘body composition’ OR
‘fat free mass’ OR ‘fat mass’ OR ‘dual-energy X-ray absorp-
tiometry’ OR ‘bioelectrical impedance’ OR ‘plethysmography’
OR ‘DEXA scan’ OR ‘DXA scan’ OR ‘body fat’ OR ‘bodpod’
OR ‘lean mass’ OR ‘adiposity’) AND (‘ultra processed’ OR
‘ultraprocessed’ OR ‘ultra-processed’ OR ‘ready-to-eat’ OR
‘ready-to-consume’ OR ‘industrialized’ OR ‘fast-food’ OR ‘fast
food’ OR ‘fastfood’ OR ‘junk food’ OR ‘prepared food’ OR
‘candy’ OR ‘ice cream’ OR ‘chocolate’ OR ‘carbonated bev-
erage’ OR ‘soft drink’ OR ‘sweetened beverage’ OR ‘snacks’
OR ‘sausage’ OR ‘hot dog’ OR ‘burger’ OR ‘dietary patterns’
OR ‘dietary behaviors’ OR ‘dietary habits’). There were no
restrictions to the search regarding topic. All papers needed
to be original studies conducted on human subjects. The
search was last updated on 15 July 2016.
In addition to the electronic search, the reviewers also
undertook a hand search in the reference list of each study
included, to identify potentially relevant studies that had
not been reached in the initial search.
Eligibility criteria
To be eligible, the studies had to fulfil the following
criteria. They needed to: evaluate the association between
consumption of ultra-processed food and body fat; eval-
uate the exposure (consumption of ultra-processed food)
and the outcome (body fat) during childhood or adoles-
cence; and not solely include individuals with specific
diseases or health conditions.
The exposure variable was the intake of any ultra-
processed food, as defined in the NOVA classification (see
online supplementary material, Supplemental Table 1)(6–9).
Studies that evaluated only BMI as the outcome were not
included because BMI does not discriminate between fat
mass and fat-free mass.
Selection of the studies
Two independent reviewers conducted an initial selection of
the articles located in the electronic search, by means of
reading the titles and abstracts. The papers selected at this
stage were then read in full and were evaluated in
accordance with the eligibility criteria. A third reviewer
adjudicated regarding whether articles should be kept or
excluded in situations in which the two reviewers disagreed.
Data analysis
From the full analysis on the articles thus selected, the
following data were extracted: country and publication
year; study design; sample size; age group evaluated;
methods and instruments used to measure the exposure
and outcome variables; variables used to control for con-
founding and in the mediation analysis (when present);
and main findings.
The general and methodological quality of observational
studies was evaluated in accordance with the STROBE
(Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology) Statement(13). The CONSORT (Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials) Statement(14) was used to
evaluate intervention studies. The maximum scores that can
be attained is 22 points in the STROBE assessment and
25 points in CONSORT; of which 9 and 10 points, respec-
tively, related to the Methods section of the studies.
Results
The electronic search resulted in 2243 titles (Fig. 1). After
removing duplicates, 1553 titles/abstracts remained to be
analysed. From reading the titles and abstracts, and in
accordance with the eligibility criteria, Reviewer 1 and
Reviewer 2 excluded 1498 and 1519 articles, respectively.
After full readings of the articles, Reviewer 1 excluded
another twenty-eight articles and Reviewer 2, nineteen, of
which nine were coincident. The reasons for exclusion of
the articles were that they presented:
∙ Investigation of ultra-processed food consumption and
body fat, but not the association between these two
variables (n 17);
∙ Investigation of food consumption by means of scores or
dietary indices, from which it was not possible to discri-
minate the consumption of ultra-processed foods (n 5);
∙ Evaluation of food consumption according to dietary
patterns or by means of specific questionnaires such as
the ‘Block’ questionnaire, which asks not only about
ultra-processed foods, but also about other food groups,
such as unprocessed or minimally processed foods (n 4);
∙ Food consumption based on their components (macro-
nutrients, sugar and energy density; n 4);
∙ No evaluation of the outcome or the exposure of
interest (n 2);
∙ Use of behavioural clusters, including consumption of
fruits and vegetables, consumption of soft drinks, seden-
tary behaviour and physically active behaviour (n 1);
∙ Evaluation of the frequency with which adolescents had
meals in fast-food restaurants, without evaluation of the
foods consumed (n 1);

 ∙ Evaluation of Indigenous populations (n 1);
∙ Evaluation of fast-food consumption without discrimi-
nating which foods belong to this group (n 1);
∙ Evaluation

is
not
considered ultra-processed in the NOVA classification
(n 1);
∙ Evaluation of an intervention composed of changes to
physical activity, concomitant to consumption of ready-
to-eat cereals, which hindered evaluation of the specific
effect of ready-to-eat cereals (n 1).
After full readings of the articles, the two reviewers agreed
regarding selection of nine studies and disagreed regard-
ing twenty-four. The third reviewer judged the relevance
of the twenty-four articles on which the two previous
reviewers had disagreed and decided to exclude seven of
them. The reasons for the seven exclusions at this stage
were that they presented:
∙ Investigation of ultra-processed food consumption and
body fat, but not the association between these two
variables (n 4);
∙ Evaluation of food consumption according to dietary
patterns or by means of specific questionnaires such
as the ‘Block’ questionnaire, which asks not only
about ultra-processed foods, but also about other
food
groups,
such
as
unprocessed
or
minimally
processed foods (n 2);
∙ Body
fat
analysed
as
the
ratio
of
two
skin-
folds (subscapular to triceps skinfold), which only
evaluates the fat distribution, and not the quantity of
fat (n 1).

 No other papers were located through the hand search in
the reference lists of the articles selected. A total of twenty-
six studies were retained for the current review.
Among these twenty-six selected articles, twelve eval-
uated the association between consumption specifically of
soft drinks or sweetened beverages and body fat(15–26),
eleven explored the association between groups of
ultra-processed
foods
and
body
fat(27–37)
and
three
evaluated the association between consumption of spe-
cific ultra-processed foods (sweets, chocolate and ready-
to-eat cereals) and body fat(38–40).
Seven studies were conducted in the USA(19,21,22,27–29,33),
four in the UK(15,24,25,37), three in Germany(18,30,35), two in
New Zealand(17,32) and one each in Australia(26), South
Africa(31), Canada(36), Netherlands(34), Mexico(16), Spain(20)
and Brazil(38). Three were multicentre studies: one was
carried out in four Oceania countries (New Zealand, Aus-
tralia, Fiji and Tonga)(23); and the other two were conducted
in ten European cities in nine different countries (Austria,
Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Spain
and Sweden)(39,40). The articles selected were published
between 2004 and 2015.
Most
of
the
studies
were
cohorts
(n
15)(15,16,18,19,22,24,25,27–31,35–37), although two of these only
presented cross-sectional analyses(16,36); followed by cross-
sectional studies (n 6)(17,20,32,38–40); and intervention studies
(n 5)(21,23,26,33,34), among which three only presented cross-
sectional analyses(21,23,33) (Table 1). In four studies, only
girls were evaluated(19,21,27,28). The sample size ranged from
120 to 13 170 individuals. Twelve studies had sample sizes
larger
than
1000
individuals(16,17,20,23–25,28,31,34,37,39,40)
(Table 1).
Regarding the age of the samples studied, in the longi-
tudinal studies (cohort and intervention studies) the mean
age at which the exposure was evaluated ranged from 7·8
(SD 3·6) to 8·49 (SD 4·0) years, and the mean age at which
the outcome was assessed ranged from 13·5 (SD 3·3) to
14·1 (SD 3·6) years. In the studies with cross-sectional
analysis, the mean age ranged from 11·2 (SD 3·3) to 15·8
(SD 3·0) years.
Food
consumption
was
investigated
using
four
different
types
of
instrument.
Eight
studies
used
FFQ(16,17,27,31,32,37,38,40); seven used food records (referring
to three days: two weekdays and one day at the week-
end)(15,18,24,28–30,35); six applied 24 h recalls(19,20,22,26,36,39);
and five asked questions about the consumption of specific
foods(21,23,25,33,34) with varying recall periods (last month,
last week, last 5 d or the day before the interview; Table 1).
Except for the studies that evaluated the consumption
of
specific
ultra-processed
foods
(n
15)(15–26,38–40),
the analysis on food consumption in the remaining
studies was performed by means of dietary patterns
(n 6)(28,29,32,35–37); or according to groups of specific foods
(n 5) such as energy-dense snacks (soft drinks, sweets,
crisps, bakery products and ice cream; n 2)(27,34), or
through investigation of fast foods, bakery foods and soft
drinks (n 1)(31), junk foods (sweetened beverages, French
fries and crisps, frozen/baked desserts and chocolate
sweets; n 1)(33) or convenience foods (pre-baked frozen
products, canned or instantaneous products such as salads

Ultra-processed foods and body fat

 or soups, or ready-to-eat meals, like pizzas, except fast
foods; n 1)(30).
In the studies that evaluated dietary patterns, the ultra-
processed groups included snacks (like crisps or choco-
lates), sweets, convenience foods and fast foods(28);
snacks and convenience foods(35); fast foods (sweetened
beverages, French fries, fried chicken, salted snacks,
hamburgers, hotdogs and pizzas)(36); artificially sweetened
beverages
and
manufactured
sauces
and
butters(29);
bakery products, carbonated beverages, sweets, crisps,
sausages, hamburgers, pizzas, cookies, instant noodles,
ready-to-eat meals and aromatized milk(37); and sweets,
bakery products, crisps and natural or artificially sweet-
ened beverages(32).
Three methods for evaluating body fat were used. Ten
studies obtained body fat measurements by means of
bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)(17,22,23,25–27,32,33,38,39);
followed by nine through dual-energy X-ray absorp-
tiometry (DXA)(15,16,19,21,24,29,31,36,37); and seven from skin-
folds(18,20,28,30,34,35,40) (Table 1). Body fat was analysed as a
percentage in sixteen articles(16–22,25–28,30,33,36,38,40) and in
kilograms in four(24,29,31,37), while another three studies
presented body fat both in kilograms and as a fat mass
index (FMI)(15,32,35) and two, as both a percentage and in
kilograms(23,39). One study used the sum of the triceps,
biceps, suprailiac and subscapular skinfolds (in millimetres)
as a proxy for the body fat component(34).
Regarding study quality, the mean totals were 17·1 and
18·0 points, respectively, for the observational studies
(n 24) and intervention studies (n 2)(26,34). The mean score
reached in the Methods section was 7 points for studies
evaluated using both the STROBE Statement and the
CONSORT Statement.
Among the studies that evaluated the association between
consumption of groups of ultra-processed foods and body
fat (n 11)(27–37), six found associations(29–31,35–37), which
were all in a positive direction (i.e. higher consumption of
ultra-processed foods was related to higher levels of body
fat). All the studies that showed this association had a
longitudinal design (cohort; Table 2).
Among the studies that evaluated the association between
consumption of soft drinks/sweetened beverages and body
fat (n 12)(15–26), eight found associations(16,17,19,22–26), which
were all in a positive direction (i.e. higher consumption
of soft drinks/sweetened beverages was followed by
higher levels of body fat; Table 3). Laska et al.(22) found
an association with a positive direction only in relation
to consumption of sweetened beverages among boys,
in a longitudinal analysis, and of diet soda among girls, in
a cross-sectional analysis. However, the result for girls
may have reflected reverse causality bias, given that
those with excess body fat might have reported higher
consumption of diet products because of their condition
(Table 3). The studies that showed this association
mostly had a longitudinal design (cohort or intervention;
Table 3).
Among the studies that evaluated the association
between consumption of other ultra-processed foods
(sweets(38), chocolate(39) and ready-to-eat cereals(40)) and
body fat, two found associations with a negative direction
(i.e. increased consumption of chocolate(39) and ready-
to-eat cereals(40) was associated with a lower percentage
of body fat; Table 4).
The main variables used in the adjusted analyses were
total energy intake, residual energy intake (energy intake
from sources other than the foods evaluated), physical
activity, age, sex, skin colour/ethnicity, parents’ education
and BMI, age at the menarche or at sexual maturation,
birth weight and breast-feeding. In the present review,
divergent opinions were observed regarding use of total
energy intake as a possible confounding factor. Out of
the twenty-six studies, nine adjusted for total energy
intake(15,16,19,22,26,29,36,37,39) and five adjusted for residual
energy intake(18,24,25,27,30). None of the studies investi-
gated whether total energy intake mediated the effect of
consumption of ultra-processed foods or soft drinks on
body fat. Two articles did not present adjusted analy-
sis(20,38) and the remaining studies adjusted for variables
other than energy intake.
Discussion
In summary, the present review showed that most of
the studies that investigated consumption of groups of
ultra-processed foods, as well as most of the studies
that evaluated consumption of soft drinks/sweetened
beverages, found positive associations with body fat. The
lack of association in some of the studies may have been
due to methodological issues. First, body fat was measured
using three different methods (DXA, BIA and skinfolds).
Among the studies that found associations, half used
DXA(16,19,24,29,31,36,37), and among those that did not find
any association, only two used this equipment(15,21).
Although the DXA method evaluates body composition
indirectly, it has the capacity to derive measurements of
greater validity than is possible using doubly indirect
methods such as BIA and skinfolds.
Second, the instruments for the food consumption
evaluation also varied among the studies (FFQ, food
record, 24 h recall and specific questions). Although all
these instruments generate information about consump-
tion of certain groups of ultra-processed foods or about a
specific ultra-processed food, a great variety of products
were included, which could at least partly explain the
divergence among the findings. For example, dietary
patterns vary according to sex, socio-economic level,
ethnic group and culture, such that specific dietary
patterns are derived for each specific population(41).
This impairs the comparability of findings between
studies(41). Six of the studies analysed here derived dietary
patterns(28,29,32,35–37).

 Among the studies that evaluated other specific ultra-
processed foods, two of them found associations in a
negative direction, such that they showed that higher
consumption of chocolate and ready-to-eat cereals was
related to a lower percentage of body fat. These findings
may reflect residual confounding. Michels et al.(40) did
not adjust for consumption of milk (that was added to
ready-to-eat cereals) or for physical activity, although
these variables might have a correlation with body fat.
Cuenca-García et al.(39) evaluated chocolate consumption
from a 24 h recall, an instrument that does not measure
dietary habits. Additionally, because of the cross-sectional
design of the study by Cuenca-García et al.(39), it is
possible that individuals with lower percentages of body
fat had higher consumption of chocolate only over the
24 h preceding the interview.
It is important to emphasize that only one of the studies
selected for the present review reported the parameters
that were used for sample size calculation(38) and none
presented a statistical power calculation. Nevertheless, the
scores relating to study quality, as evaluated through the
STROBE and CONSORT Statements, were considered
good. There was no difference in the mean scores
for quality between studies that did or did not find an
association (data not shown).
Although ultra-processed foods are a major source of
energy intake, they are just one group of foods among
all the possible sources of energy intake in the diet.
Therefore, to assess the effect of the energy provided by
ultra-processed foods on body fat levels, it is important to
disentangle the effect of ultra-processed foods from the
effect of other sources of energy. Consequently, studies
that adjusted for total energy intake (including energy
provided by ultra-processed foods) may in fact have over-
adjusted for the exposure, thus decreasing the magnitude
of
the
association
between
consumption
of
ultra-
processed foods and body fat. For this reason, we take
the view that the adjustment should be limited to residual
energy solely from other sources. Nevertheless, seven of
the nine studies examined here that adjusted for total
energy intake found positive associations(16,19,22,26,29,36,37).
Regarding the strategies used by the authors of the
studies selected for the current analysis to decrease the
occurrence of bias, self-reporting errors were considered
in five studies(15,16,18,24,26). One study evaluated under-
reporting and over-reporting of energy intake (daily
intakes <79 % and >121 % of the estimated energy
requirement, respectively). However, they did not exclude
these cases from the analysis, under the argument that in
doing so, the children who were of greatest interest for the
study (those with highest percentages of body fat) would
probably be excluded(15). Therefore, the implausible
reports were used as a covariate in the adjusted analysis.
Individuals with implausible energy intake (under-repor-
ted or over-reported) were excluded in two studies(27,33).

 which obese adolescents were excluded, to prevent
underestimated reporting of chocolate intake. However,
after these analyses, the results did not change. Some
of the studies reported using standardized protocols
for
anthropometric
measurements(16,23,25,28,32,34–36),
to
decrease occurrences of measurement errors.
Among the limitations of the present review, the great
variability of methods used to investigate food consumption
can be highlighted, along with the great variability of the
instruments used to assess body composition. These factors
hindered evaluation of the data by means of meta-analysis.
The articles included in the review looked only at specific
products and did not apply the NOVA classification. In fact,
so far, only two studies have applied the NOVA classifica-
tion to assess associations: not with body fat but with obesity
and weight gain. Louzada et al.(10) were the first to use this
indicator in a cross-sectional study to evaluate the associa-
tion with obesity. Mendonça et al.(11) applied this indicator
in the first cohort study that was planned to evaluate the
effect of ultra-processed food consumption on weight gain.
On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, the
present systematic review is the first addressing the
association
between
consumption
of
ultra-processed
foods and body fat levels among children and adoles-
cents. Investigations on consumption of ultra-processed
foods during childhood have gained importance because
the dietary habits acquired over this period tend to be kept
throughout life, which can influence the prevalence of
obesity in this population(42,43).
Conclusion
It is evident that the great majority of the literature on
the association between consumption of ultra-processed
foods and body fat levels presents positive directions
(i.e. increased consumption ends up increasing body fat
levels). Most of the studies with designs of greater
robustness, and which used DXA to evaluate body
composition,
showed
positive
associations
between
consumption of ultra-processed foods and body fat levels.
Despite the large number of studies on the association
between dietary habits and body fat levels that are avail-
able in the literature, there is a lack of studies exploring
the association between consumption of ultra-processed
foods and obesity among children and adolescents. Use of
a standardized food classification, such as NOVA, which
makes it possible to consider the level of food processing,
is much needed to uncover the role of such foods in
obesity epidemics and to enable comparability between
the findings of upcoming studies.
