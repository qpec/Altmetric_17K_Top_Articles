Trends in infant mortality in Venezuela between 1985 and 
2016: a systematic analysis of demographic data
Jenny García, Gerardo Correa, Brenda Rousset
Summary
Background Between the 1950s and 2000, Venezuela showed one of the most substantial improvements in infant 
mortality rates in Latin America. However, the recent economic crisis alongside an increase in infectious and parasitic 
diseases might be reversing previous patterns. Because no official updated mortality statistics have been published 
since 2013, the effect of these recent events has been difficult to assess accurately. We therefore aimed to estimate 
infant mortality rate trends and report the effect of the crisis.
Methods We estimated infant mortality rates using direct methods (ie, death counts from Venezuelan Ministry of 
Health via yearbooks and notifiable diseases bulletins, and birth records published by the UN Economic Commission 
for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Venezuelan National Institute of Statistics) and indirect methods (using 
census data and a Living Conditions Survey ENCOVI 2016). We shaped yearly estimations using a semiparametric 
regression model, specifically a P-Spline model with a cubic thin plate base. The primary objective was to estimate 
infant mortality rate trends from 1985 to 2016.
Findings Around 2009, the long-term decline in infant mortality rate stopped, and a new pattern of increase was 
observed. The infant mortality rate reached 21·1 deaths per 1000 livebirths (90% CI −17·8 to 24·3) in 2016, almost 
1·4 times the rate of 2008 (15∙0, −14∙0 to 16·1). This increase represents a huge setback on previous achievements in 
reducing infant mortality.
Interpretation Our conservative estimation indicates that Venezuela is in the throes of a humanitarian crisis. 
The increase in infant mortality rate in 2016 compared with 2008 takes the country back to the level observed at the 
end of the 1990s, wiping out 18 years of expected progress, and leaves the Venezuelan Government far from achieving 
the target of nine deaths per 1000 livebirths stated in the UN Millennium Development Goals.

Introduction
Accelerated economic and social transformations led to 
improved living standards in Venezuela during the second 
half of the 20th century.1 An increase in life expectancy 
mostly driven by a reduction of infant mortality—from 
108·0 per 1000 livebirths in 1950 to 18·2 in 2000—was 
observed during this period.2 As in most Latin American 
countries, this progress was linked to macroeconomic 
development, notably sanitary controls, mass vaccination 
campaigns, elimination of disease vectors, and antibiotic 
distribution.3 Initial improvements were attributable to a 
reduction of infectious and parasitic diseases such as 
gastroenteritis, malaria, and tuberculosis.1
Recent socioeconomic and political events have led to 
a collapse in living standards, along with a breakdown 
of the health system.4 Gross domestic product per capita 
decreased by almost 30% in 2016 and 14% in 2017
.5 
Cumulative inflation reached 254·4% in 2016 and 
1087·5% in 2017, and the national budget deficit was 
more than 13%.5 At the individual level, the 2014 con­
sumer survey report signalled declining consumption of 
foods providing essential micronutrients, such as 
milk (–45%) and beef (–12%), compared with previous 
years.6 In 2017, 61·2% of the population was in extreme 
poverty:7 89·4% of households reported not having 
enough money to buy food and 61·9% of the adult 
population had gone to bed hungry at least once during 
the past 3 months.8
In parallel, funding for the Venezuelan health system 
has been substantially reduced since 2007
.9 Patient­to­
doctor ratios have decreased from 1·7 to 1·2 per 1000,10 
and hospital bed ratios (hospital bed per population) have 
fallen from 1·3 to 0·73 per 1000.11 Vaccination campaigns 
have ceased in many parts of the country. Between 2007 
and 2009, for example, the Venezuelan Ministry of Health 
did not provide vaccines against polio; diph 
theria, tetanus, 
pertussis, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b; 
to children younger than 5 years, and did not vaccinate 
nearly 20% of children in 2010.12 In addition, shortages of 
basic medicines, surgical supplies, and infant formula 
have increased health­care costs,13 making it unaffordable 
for most of the population. Contrary to official govern­
mental rhetoric, public health spending has never 
exceeded individual spending since 1990, and household

spending accounted for 64% of total health expenditures 
in 2014—one of the highest percentages in Latin 
America.11
Medical and humanitarian non­governmental organi­
sations have been reporting increasing morbidity and 
mortality due to infectious and parasitic diseases. 
Diseases that have been controlled or eradicated in the 
past decades are reappearing. Most of them are associated 
with inadequate access to basic sanitation, malnutrition, 
and insufficient vaccination campaigns. In the past 
2 years, the Pan­American Health Organization has 
issued several epidemiological alerts reporting malaria,14 
measles,15 and diphtheria16 outbreaks. Critical warnings 
are given out not just to the Venezuelan Government but 
also to neighbouring countries affected by the spread of 
these diseases.17
A strict secrecy policy has ruled public institutions, 
especially since 2013. Data sources are no longer 
updated nor publicly available.4 The government’s 
constant denial of the crisis has made it even more 
difficult to properly assess its extent. At the international 
level, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America 
and the Caribbean (ECLAC) collected, systematised, 
and published statistical information including infant 
mortality esti 
mations.18 Their estimations were built on 
the basis of life tables implicit in the population 
projections. Likewise, WHO produces infant mortality 
estimations for all countries through the Global Health 
Observatory.19 In Venezuela’s case, the latest available 
estimates are based on official data reported by the 
Venezuelan Ministry of Health in 2013. WHO’s updated 
2018 estimations as well as ECLAC’s updated 2016 
estimations rely on the projection of a continuous 
decrease in infant mortality (appendix p 9). As a 
consequence, they cannot reflect the effect of the recent 
socioeconomic deterioration.
The UN Inter­Agency Group for Child Mortality 
Estimation (IGME)20 produces an annual report on 
trends in neonatal, infant, and under­5 mortality for all 
UN member states. 2017 IGME estimations did not 
consider any change in mortality trends, reporting an 
infant mortality rate of 14·1 per 1000 livebirths for 
the year 2016. The IGME estimations update of infant 
mortality rate released on Sept 18, 2018, incorporated 
new estimation solely for the years 2014 and 2016, 
without indicating the official Venezuelan data source 
(appendix pp 9–11).
To overcome the information gap, we took up the 
challenge of producing the most accurate yearly infant 
mortality rate estimation possible. We decided to focus 
on infant mortality rate because its trends are very 
sensitive to malnutrition, environmental risks, and 
dysfunctional health services,21 all of which are combined 
in the current Venezuelan context. Our hypothesis is that 
the historical downward trend in infant mortality has 
been reversed and that the economic breakdown has led 
to a humanitarian crisis in the country. We therefore 
aimed to estimate infant mortality rate trends, reveal 
the current situation of infant mortality in the absence 
of official estimations, and report the humanitarian 
emergency underway through analysis of infant mortality 
rates. 
Methods
Data sources
Infant mortality analysis requires calculation of death 
counts in the population who are younger than 1 year, as 
well as livebirths during the same period. Information 
about both events is covered and published by a vital 
statistics system. Quality evaluations of the Venezuelan 
vital statistics system estimated under­coverage of 
about 2∙4%,22 which is better than most Latin American 
countries.23 For our analysis, we took death counts 
published by the Venezuelan Ministry of Health in its 
mortality yearbooks from 1985 to 2013,24 and reported by 
WHO. These yearbooks include all deaths for which a 
medical certification was issued, regardless of its civil or 
legal registration (appendix p 2). To complete the infant 
mortality rates, we took long­term birth series estimated 
by ECLAC18 and those held as reference by the Venezuelan 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Since 2013, no official mortality estimates have been published 
in Venezuela. Consequently, academic studies attempting to 
quantify infant mortality trends for the most recent years are 
likely to be inaccurate. We used the data released from the 
2014–16 Notifiable Diseases Bulletins and the 2016 National 
Survey of Living Conditions of the Venezuelan Population 
(known as ENCOVI 2016) to produce more realistic infant 
mortality rate estimations.
Added value of this study
This study might be the only attempt to robustly estimate 
annual infant mortality rates for the most recent years in 
Venezuela. In this sense, two pieces of added value can be 
identified: the estimation of long-term updated infant 
mortality rate trends and determination of infant mortality 
rates during times of crisis and absent data.
Implications of all the available evidence
International infant mortality rate estimates for Venezuela do 
not reflect the progressive deterioration in socioeconomic 
conditions. On the contrary, they involuntarily conceal the 
humanitarian crisis when modelling a continuous decreasing 
trend in infant mortality. Venezuela’s case could be an obvious 
exception because of a relatively unexpected shift in mortality 
and fertility patterns. However, monitoring in countries should 
be guided when possible by sound empirical data adjusted for 
known biases, rather than by modelling assumptions.

Ministry of Health for its official infant mortality rate 
estimations.
As indicated previously, neither mortality yearbooks 
nor any other official mortality estimates have been pub­
lished since 2013. However, weekly Notifiable Diseases 
Bulletins25 from 2013 to 2016 were briefly available during 
the year 2017 on the Venezuelan Ministry of Health’s 
official website.4 Although the main aim of these bulletins 
is not to report death counts, they do dedicate a section to 
report weekly hospital deaths of the population who are 
younger than 1 year since 2003. The Notifiable Diseases 
Bulletins annual deaths summary has historically under­
estimated mortality yearbook counts (appendix p 4). This 
underestimation was readily summarised into a linear 
model (appendix pp 2, 3). We created adjusted death 
counts for the years 2013–16, corrected with a linear 
extrapolated underestimation ratio. Birth counts for the 
years 2003–16 came from summaries of registered births 
corrected by the National Institute of Statistics (appendix 
pp 3, 4).26 To estimate this set of infant mortality rates, 
we assumed births of late­registration patterns and 
proportion of hospital deaths kept the same historical 
pattern, meaning data quality and coverage remained 
unchanged despite the crises.
Another important source of information in the 
country is census and survey data. During the period of 
our analysis, the National Institute of Statistics had 
undertaken three population and household censuses in 
1990, 2001, and 2011. Census data remain available and 
allow information to be collected about the numbers of 
children ever born and children dead by women’s age. 
More recently, a National Survey of Living Conditions of 
the Venezuelan Population (ENCOVI) has been done 
annually by three of the most important universities 
in the country. In 2016, the ENCOVI survey included 
questions regarding the number of children ever born 
and still alive. This information is known as a summary 
birth history and is commonly used by demographers to 
apply model­based methods to estimate infant mortality 
rates. Here, we use Brass’s method on Trussell’s variant 
(appendix pp 4, 5). This variant calculates multipliers 
to transform pro 
portions of children who have died 
into cohort­specific probabilities of dying through a 
regression approach.
Data analysis
In short, we used estimations based on direct and 
indirect methods to produce three sets of data. The first 
dataset comprised infant mortality rates from 1985 to 
2013, using a direct method on death counts from the 
mortality yearbooks and birth records published by 
ECLAC and the Venezuelan Ministry of Health. The 
second dataset included infant mortality rates from 2003 
to 2016, using direct methods on adjusted deaths and 
births. The third dataset consisted of a group of infant 
mortality rate estimations, obtained through indirect 
methods based on census data and a recent living 
conditions survey (ie, ENCOVI 2016). In this sense, we 
covered all data sources publicly available in the country 
regarding mortality data from 1985 to 2016.
All previous infant mortality rate estimations were 
synthesised and smoothed in a P­spline model. This 
model allows us to eliminate irregularities in the data 
produce by combining several data sources and methods 
of adjustment, each affected by different types of error,27 
without losing possible changes in the pattern. The 
P­spline method of this research has a cubic thin plate 
base and the smoothing parameter λ is estimated using 
maximum restricted likelihood (appendix pp 6, 7).28 
We used maximum restricted likelihood to set probable 
historical patterns. The assumptions of this model are 
the same as those that underlie the mixed linear models. 
We present the most probable infant mortality rate 
estimations rather than the most exact ones, because of 
the available estimations in the country.
We used the R package SemiPar developed by 
Matt Wand (2003) for the data analyses.

Results
Trends in infant mortality rates started changing from 
2009 onwards (figure 1). Rates stopped declining and 
began increasing, with the steepest increase seen after 
2011. In 2016, the infant mortality rate (21·1 deaths per 
1000 livebirths, 90% CI −17·8 to 24·3) had returned to the 
level observed at the end of the 1990s.

According to Reed and colleagues,29 several stages of 
alerts based on mortality rates can be used as thresholds 
to formally declare a humanitarian emergency. These 
thresholds can be either fixed or assigned according to a 
baseline.30 One way to see it is to link stages to specific 
proportional increases. Thus, an initial phase of a crisis is 
determined by the time in which the rate doubles its value, 
whereas the height of the crisis is the phase between the 
doubling and its maximum increase. In Venezuela, the 
infant mortality rate during the year 2016 was 1·4 times 
the rate of 2008 (15∙0, −14∙0 to 16·1). By Reed and 
colleagues’ measure, then, the country is on the way to 
entering the second stage of a humanitarian crisis.
Although we were unable to determine the causes of 
death from the data gathered, the 2017–18 WHO reports14 
indicate that in Venezuela, during the first decade 
of the 21st century, malaria prevalence stabilised at 
around 1·5 per 1000 inhabitants, with lethality at less 
than 0·05% of the reported cases (appendix pp 12, 13). 
By 2016, incidence had increased five times to 7·5 per 
1000 inhabitants and continued increasing up to 10·1 per 
1000 during the year 2017
.14 Until now, malaria outbreaks 
have been mostly concentrated in the southern region of 
Venezuela, where uncontrolled mining activity has been 
increasing. However, WHO’s most recent reports have 
been identifying cases all over the country. 
Likewise, cases of measles have tripled since 2013. 
727 cases were reported in 2017 and 4605 cases between 
January and August, 2018, whereas in the past there were 
rarely more than 300 cases per year. The age group 
most affected among the confirmed cases is children 
younger than 5 years.15 Diphtheria, a disease eradicated 
in Venezuela in the 1990s, has reappeared. Diphtheria 
outbreaks have continued spreading. 2024 cases in 
total have been reported since 2016 (324 cases in 2016, 
1040 cases in 2017, and 660 cases between January and 
August, 2018). So far, cumulative diphtheria lethality 
exceeds 16∙5% of reported cases16 when it does not 
usually exceed 10%.31 Medicine shortages, elevated costs 
of antibiotics, and a deficit of tetanus–diphtheria booster 
shots impair the situation.
In addition to the alarming malaria, measles, and 
diphtheria outbreaks, reported diseases in the 2014–16 
Notifiable Diseases Bulletins25 showed constant increases 
in cases of diarrhoea (34·6%) and acute bronchitis 
(almost 40%), as well as an increase in already high 
maternal mortality. In 2016, 65·8% more deaths were 
associated with complications during childbirth than in 
previous years. Deterioration of the health system and 
less access to monthly antenatal care programmes might 
have contributed to this increase.
Discussion
Progress achieved in Venezuela during the first decade of 
the 21st century has been completely cancelled out by the 
increase in infant mortality rate over the past 7 years, 
confirming our hypothesis. Different methods have been 
used to produce accurate infant mortality estimations, 
from simple linear regression adjustment to more 
sophisticated techniques such as splines. We have 
provided robust estimations and filled the gap in national 
statistics for the most recent years. The main assumption 
behind these estimates is that, despite the deep crisis, 
registration patterns for both birth and death counts 
remained stable. We acknowledge that this assumption 
might not be realistic because of the deep socioeconomic 
crisis affecting public institution performance. Although 
we were unable to prove and measure possible changes, 
we take the risk of producing conservative estimations. 
This factor constitutes the main limitation of our analysis 
(appendix p 8).
Comparing our results with IGME’s 2017 revision, we 
noticed that the infant mortality rate figures before 2009 
were very similar (figure 2). IGME’s most recent data for 
estimating infant mortality rate come from the 2013 vital 
registration system. These data certainly cannot account 
for the effects of the recent deterioration in living 
conditions in Venezuela. It should, however, give clues 
about increasing mortality rates before 2013. We found 
the same discrepancy with WHO estimations.19 Even 
bigger differences are found with respect to IGME’s 2018 
revision, for the period before 2013 (appendix pp 9–11). 
The inclusion of new infant mortality rate estimation for 
the latest year gives the appearance of a sudden crisis 
shock, which reversed the declining trend after the year 
2013, and our estimations show a progressive deterior­
ation. Digging deeper into the data, it is possible to see 
differences that might come from changes in fertility 
pattern. WHO’s birth figures are considerably higher 
when comparing with our estimations and ECLAC’s 
latest ones (appendix p 11). Following adjusted births in 
vital registration for the most recent years allows us to see

not just declining fertility rates but also important 
changes in the fertility age structure (appendix pp 11, 12). 
Since 2006, fertility has been declining for all age groups 
of women, except the 10–19 year age group (appendix 
p 12). Teenage pregnancy represents higher risks of infant 
mortality than in any other group of women.
More generally, the increasing infant mortality rate is 
likely to derive from the progressively deteriorating 
nutrition status, the collapse in living standards, and a 
breakdown of the health system. This breakdown of the 
health system is reflected in the systematic undercutting 
of vaccination campaigns, and shortage of medicines 
and medical treatment. The UN Millennium Develop­
ment Goals (MDGs) and the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) consider child mortality as a key indicator 
of health, social, and environmental conditions. In this 
framework, and as a member of the UN, Venezuela 
assumed the legal commitment to reduce infant 
mortality to nine or less per 1000 livebirths by the 
year 2015. This commitment has not been kept.32 
During the 2000s, Venezuela had created policies, such 
as health missions, aimed at the most vulnerable 
populations. But these efforts are not reflected in the 
avoidable death rates of Venezuelan children seen 
today. In the concluding year of the MDGs, Venezuela 
committed via the SDGs to eradicate preventable infant 
deaths. Regrettably, far from succeeding, the country is 
showing a deterioration of child survival for the first 
time. Venezuela is the only country in South America 
that has risen back to the infant mortality rate levels of 
the 1990s.
During important crises, the most common causes of 
death are the same as those reported in countries with the 
highest child mortality rates: diarrhoeal diseases, acute 
respiratory infections, measles, malaria, and severe 
malnutrition.21 All these elements are present in Venezuela 
and will certainly adversely affect future infant mortality 
rate trends. Organisations such as the Venezuelan Health 
Observatory,33 International Amnesty,34 and the UN 
Refugee Agency35 have acknowledged the state of the 
humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. In 2016, the Venezuelan 
National Assembly declared a humanitarian crisis in the 
country and requested international humanitarian aid to 
facilitate the importation of medical supplies and 
medicines into the country.4 This attempt and all others 
have been vetoed by the government. This study provides 
a strong evidence base for action to be taken to alleviate 
and aid the humanitarian crisis under way in Venezuela.
