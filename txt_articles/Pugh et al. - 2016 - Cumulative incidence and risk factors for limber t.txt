Limber tail is a condition that typically affects larger working breeds causing tail limpness
and pain, resolving without veterinary intervention. It is poorly understood and the disease
burden has not been well characterised. Data collected from owners of the Dogslife cohort of
Labrador Retrievers have been used to describe incidents and a case–control study was
undertaken to elucidate risk factors with 38 cases and 86 controls. The cumulative incidence
of unexplained tail limpness was 9.7 per cent. Swimming is not a necessary precursor for
limber tail, but it is a risk factor (OR=4.7) and working dogs were more susceptible than
non-working dogs (OR=5.1). Higher latitudes were shown to be a risk factor for developing
the condition and the case dogs were more related to each other than might be expected by
chance. This suggests that dogs may have an underlying genetic predisposition to developing
the condition. This study is the first, large-scale investigation of limber tail and the findings
reveal an unexpectedly high illness burden. Anecdotally, accepted risk factors have been
confirmed and the extent of their impact has been quantified. Identifying latitude and a
potential underlying genetic predisposition suggests avenues for future work on this painful
and distressing condition.
Introduction
Limber tail in dogs is a condition characterised by a flaccid tail,
often with a stiff tail base. There is no clear case definition for
the condition and it is diagnosed on the basis of signalment
(being reported in larger working breeds), the clinical signs and
their rapid self-resolution, which excludes other likely causes of
tail flaccidity and stiffness. Dogs often show signs of pain and
distress when they develop limber tail, although these resolve
with the other clinical signs.
Limber tail was initially described in 1997 in the Veterinary
Record as “acute onset paralysis of the tail (frozen tail or limber
tail)” with onset following “swimming in, or showering with,
cold water” (Hewison 1997). Subsequent letters described
similar cases (Jeffels 1997, Steiss 1997a, Wilkins 1997) and
Wilkins was the first to mention that the signs included a
‘painful tailbase’. The consensus was that the signs typically fol-
lowed exercising in cold water and that they resolved after a
period of as much as 10 days.
The authors of a Norwegian study (Bredal and Thoresen
1999) suggested that limber tail was caused by myositis. This
theory was consistent with the findings of a small clinical and
pathological study of English Pointers (Steiss and others 1999)
comparing four case dogs with three controls from the same
kennels. All affected dogs had flaccidity of the tail, raised creatine
kinase levels indicative of myopathy and histological evidence of
coccygeal muscle damage.
In a wider report on muscle disorders in working dogs (Steiss
2002), limber tail was described as a condition characterised by a
flaccid tail which either hung from the base or extended horizon-
tally for a short distance before hanging. Dogs would typically
recover spontaneously within a few days to two weeks and anec-
dotal evidence indicated that NSAIDs minimised distress. The
author referred to previous studies (Steiss and Wright 1995,
Steiss 1996, 1997b,c), which included a survey of 113 owners of
over 3000 hunting dogs in the Southeastern USA. The findings
from this study have been widely paraphrased online but were
originally published in magazines that are now unavailable.
In the academic literature, the first prevalence estimate for
the condition was reported in 2008 from a convenience survey of
lameness and injury involving over 1300 working dogs across
two hunting seasons in 2005–2007 in Great Britain (Houlton
2008). Just three of 613 Labrador Retrievers (LRs) and one of 66
Flat-Coat Retrievers were reported to suffer from ‘cold tail’ in
the study, resulting in an estimated risk of 0.49 per cent (95 per
cent CI 0.1 to 1.4 per cent) in this group of working LRs. Thus
this condition, which will henceforth be referred to as limber
tail, appeared to have a low prevalence. In addition to the obser-
vation that limber tail is self-limiting, this might explain why
there is a paucity of literature regarding the condition.
The Dogslife project is an ongoing cohort study of LRs in the
UK (Clements and others 2013). Data are collected online dir-
ectly from owners regarding the lifestyle, morphology and
health of the dogs. The Dogslife database currently comprises
information about over 6300 dogs. As such, it is ideally suited to
investigate the prevalence and risk factors of conditions that
may not be presented to veterinarians, such as limber tail.

 The purpose of this study was to describe the incidents of
limber tail reported to Dogslife and undertake a case–control
study to elucidate the risk factors associated with the condition.
Materials and methods
The study was approved by the Veterinary Ethical Review
Committee of the University of Edinburgh.
Dogslife participants are asked to complete an online ques-
tionnaire every month until the dog is one year of age and then
quarterly after that. A description of the lifestyle and morpho-
logical data collected in the first three and a half years of
Dogslife is available in Pugh and others (2015b). In addition to
lifestyle information, owners are asked to report whether their
dog has had any of six clinical signs indicative of illness such as
diarrhoea or lameness and then “Did [dog’s name] have any
other illnesses or problems?” [yes/no]. If they answer [yes], then
a free text box appears for them to detail the issue. They are
asked for the dates when the clinical sign started and ended and
whether they took the dog to their veterinarian with the
problem. The details of the illness section of the online question-
naire were reported by Pugh and others (2015a).
Stage 1
Dog-specific data were extracted from the Dogslife database
based on owner descriptions of tail problems. The descriptions
had to include the word ‘tail’ and any of the following words
‘cold’, ‘dead’, ‘droopy’, ‘drop’, ‘limb’, ‘limber’, ‘limp’, ‘rudder’,
‘staved’, ‘stiff’, ‘stride’, ‘swim’ or ‘swimmers’. Where tail was
found without the additional keywords, the full text was exam-
ined. For example, “She had a problem with her tail, she couldn’t
wag it for 5 days” was included as a possible case. The details of
these incidents were collated.
Stage 2
A case–control study was undertaken whereby provisional con-
trols were chosen from those that had spent at least as much
time in the Dogslife project as the case dogs identified above but
had no report of signs of limber tail. They were chosen at random
from 479 members of the Dogslife cohort whose owners had pre-
viously supplied saliva samples for DNA analysis, as this would
facilitate future investigations of potential genetic predispositions.
The saliva samples were originally collected from owners who
had completed the Dogslife questionnaire at least three times.
Contemporaneously collected data for morphology and life-
style were available for all Dogslife dogs. Additionally, the
owners of the dogs in the case–control study were contacted and
asked to complete one of two tail-specific questionnaires (see
online supplementary materials 1 and 2). The questionnaires
asked about swimming, which is not addressed in the online
Dogslife questionnaire. In addition, information was collected
about tail-related signs and about perceived pain levels and the
impact on quality of life of potential limber tail incidents. In
accordance with Steiss and others (1999), case and control status
was determined using the following case definition: the dog had
some degree of tail flaccidity but no report of tail injury or other
cause. This was ascertained by asking about the following five
signs relating to the tail:
1. It looks abnormally limp at the end
2. It looks abnormally limp along the entire length
3. It looks abnormally stiff at the base (near the body)
4. The hair on the top of it stands on end
5. It appears painful for no reason
All analyses were performed using R 3.2.2 (R Core T
eam.
R: A language and environment for statistical computing. 2013.
www.r-project.org/). The age, sex, coat colour, neuter status,
household type, postcode location as country within the UK,
owner smoking status, dog purpose and swimming activity were
compared between the cases and controls using Fisher’s exact
tests (CIs were calculated using the exact2×2 package (Fay
2010)). Using postcode locations to generate latitude and longi-
tude coordinates as dependent variables, binary logistic regres-
sion models were used to compare case and control status as the
response variable. Similarly, height, weight and exercise as
reported to Dogslife (all scaled using R’s scale function) were
modelled as independent variables but in these instances, dog ID
was included as a random effect to take into account repeated
measures using the lme4 package (Bates and others 2014). Risks
and incidence rates are presented with exact binomial CIs.
In order to assess whether there was a difference in the
relatedness of the cases and controls, permutation testing was
undertaken whereby 10,000 samples the same size as the
number of cases and controls were chosen at random from all
Dogslife dogs and the number of different sires and dams con-
tributing to these samples was determined. The dogs that con-
tributed more than one offspring were weighted and averaged
such that if N dogs were chosen at random and, of the sires
or dams, one contributed three offspring, two contributed
two

contributed

These values were treated as a distribution and compared
with the number of sires and dams that contributed to the cases
and controls.
Results
Between July 2010 and October 2015, there were 53 possible
incidents of limber tail reported to Dogslife, associated with 43
dogs. There were approximately 6000 Dogslife dogs enrolled in
the study at this time. This would give a conservative cumula-
tive incidence of 0.7 per cent (assuming owners of all dogs were
reporting and all dogs were old enough to experience limber
tail). This is similar to the previous value of 0.49 per cent
(Houlton 2008). One dog had four reported episodes of limber
tail, one had three, five had two and 36 had one. The mean age
of the dogs at the first report was 2.13 years (95 per cent CI 1.75
to 2.50 years), median=1.64 years, range 8.6 months–5.0 years.
The owners described the incidents in 31 different ways and
they can be summarised as follows: limp or limber tail (24),
swim or swimmer’s tail (3), frozen tail (3), cold tail (2), any com-
bination of limber, swim, frozen or cold tail (9) and other (11).
Of the owners who reported more than one incident, only one
used the same phrasing for all incidents. Of all 53 incidents, only
11 prompted a veterinary visit and these 11 visits all related to
different dogs. By implication, investigations using data collected
at veterinary practices would miss 74 per cent of dogs exhibiting
signs of the condition (95 per cent CI 58.8 to 86.5 per cent).
Between June and October 2015, the Dogslife project admin-
istrator attempted to contact 170 owners to ask them to com-
plete a tail health questionnaire. The number of responses and
how the dogs were categorised as cases or controls are shown in
Fig 1. Questionnaires were returned by 124 owners (72.9 per
cent). The questionnaires related to 31 of the 43 dogs provision-
ally identified as cases via routine reporting to Dogslife and 93
provisional controls. Responses to the detailed questionnaire
indicated that two of the 31 provisional cases had no tail limp-
ness so were excluded. The 93 provisional controls had a
minimum age of 2.0 years and, in total, their lifetimes comprised
419 years at risk. Fourteen of them had one or more of the five
signs that were identified as possibly indicative of limber tail. Of
these 14, three owners reported that they suspected the signs
(stiff base: two dogs, limp length: two dogs) were related to
impacted anal glands and an additional two dogs had signs that
did not include tail limpness. On this basis, nine of the provi-
sional controls became cases. Although nine dogs were not iden-
tified as affected with limber tail by routine reporting, this was
not unexpected as previous validation indicated under-reporting
of illnesses to Dogslife (Pugh and others 2015c). The cumulative

 incidence of limber tail in these 93 dogs chosen randomly from a
subset of the Dogslife cohort was 9.7 per cent (95 per cent CI
4.5 to 17.6 per cent), which is considerably higher than any pre-
viously reported estimate.
For the 38 cases for which questionnaires were completed,
the signs reported by owners are shown in Fig 2. It should be
noted that 11 of the 12 owners who answered no to the pain
question and two of the three who were unsure then gave
non-zero answers on the pain scale. The mean pain score was
6.0 out of 10 (95 per cent CI 4.4 to 7.5) and in terms of quality
of life where 0 referred to no impact and 10 implied the worst
possible quality of life, the mean score was 4.1 (95 per cent CI
2.6 to 5.8). For both pain and quality of life, the reported range
was 0–10. There was a strong correlation between pain and
quality of life scores (Pearson’s correlation coefficient=0.72).
T
wenty-two of the dogs had a single incident, eight had two
incidents, five had three, two had four and one dog was reported
to have had approximately 30 incidents of limber tail. In terms
of duration, there was considerable variation, both between dogs
and between incidents for individual dogs. In all four cases where
the owner gave different durations for different episodes, the
later episodes were shorter. Overall, the shortest episode lasted
just a few hours and the longest was reported to last about
10 days. If just the first incident for each dog was considered and
‘a few days’ was taken as three days, ‘a week or more’ was taken
as eight days and a few hours was taken as three hours, then the
mean duration was 3.5 days (95 per cent CI 2.9 to 4.2 days).
Owners reported that the incidents followed: swimming
(yes 29, no 9); exposure to cold weather (yes 19, no 19); vigorous
exercise (yes 18, no 18, unsure 2); exposure to wet weather (yes
11, no 26, unsure 1) and/or confinement (crate 5, car 1, no 31,
unsure 1). Fig 3, which is dominated by swimming and cold
weather, shows how the precursors co-occurred. The owners of

 five activities. T
o paraphrase, they suggested that limber tail had
followed ‘over-excited wagging’ and ‘suspected banged tail when
wagging vigorously’.
While it was clear that swimming was not a necessary pre-
cursor to limber tail, it still appeared to be a risk factor. When
the swimming habits of the cases (36 swimmers, 2 non-
swimmers) and controls (68 swimmers, 18 non-swimmers) were
compared, the OR of a case swimming compared with a control
was 4.7 (95 per cent CI 1.1 to 29.9), P=0.03.
Data were extracted from the Dogslife database relating to
the cases and controls assigned according to the questionnaire as
discussed above. The cases comprised 18 females and 20 males
compared with 40 female and 46 male controls. The controls
were slightly older than the cases, which was expected as they
were chosen to have spent at least as much time in the Dogslife
project as the cases. Otherwise, the cases and controls had
similar distributions of neuter status, coat colour, height,
weight, exercise levels, household type (eg ‘retired’) and whether
anyone in the household smoked (see online supplementary
T
ables S1 and S2).
By contrast, there were a disproportionately high number of
working dogs among the cases. The cases and controls were
described, respectively, as household pets (32 and 82), working
dogs (5 and 3), gundog and pet (1 and 0) and co-counsellor
(0 and 1). The OR of a case being a working dog (including the
dog that was a gundog and pet) compared with not being a
working dog was 5.1 (95 per cent CI 1.1 to 24.9; Fisher’s exact
test, P=0.02). It also appeared that there was a geographical
association. Using the postcode of their household, the dogs
came from England (28 and 72), Scotland (9 and 12), Wales (1
and 0) and Northern Ireland (0 and 2) for cases and controls,
respectively. The results of a binary logistic regression model
indicated that the cases were disproportionately from higher lati-
tudes with an OR of 1.47 (95 per cent CI 1.12 to 1.98) for each
unit increase in latitude (regression parameters given in online
supplementary T
able S1).
The results of permutation testing indicated that, in terms of
sires, the cases were more related than the controls and more
related than would be expected from random selection from the
cohort. Fig 4 shows the distribution of sire contributions for ran-
domly generated samples of the same number as the cases and
controls. The 2.5 per cent and 97.5 per cent percentiles are
shown in red for each distribution and the contributions of sires
to the cases and controls are shown in blue. The contribution of
sires to the case dogs lies at the extreme right of the distribution
(well beyond the 97.5th centile) and is significantly different
from the randomly sampled distribution (P=0.0002).
Discussion
This case–control study demonstrates the utility of owner-
reported information regarding illnesses that are often not pre-
sented to veterinarians. It provides more information about a
condition that has been underestimated and is poorly under-
stood. Swimming has been confirmed as a risk factor but,
despite prior suggestions that limber tail is caused by swimming
(Hewison 1997, Jeffels 1997, Wilkins 1997, Houlton 2008), one-
quarter of affected dogs did not swim prior to the onset of signs.
In addition, working dogs have been shown to be more likely to
suffer from the condition.
Increasing latitude has been newly identified as a risk factor
for limber tail. The condition has also been called ‘cold tail’
(Houlton 2008) and given that temperature is intrinsically linked
with latitude, this is the first evidence to support the anecdotal
accounts of association with colder temperatures.
Under-reporting of limber tail was confirmed in the cohort.
Indeed, an initial cumulative incidence of 0.7 per cent was
rapidly superseded by the cumulative incidence in the provi-
sional controls of 9.7 per cent. It is possible that the 93 provi-
sional controls that chose to answer the questionnaire were
disproportionately likely to have suffered from tail-related signs,
making
this
an
over-estimate.
However,
even
if
the
34
non-responders are treated as controls, that still leaves a cumula-
tive incidence of 7.1 per cent (9/127). The potential controls
were considerably older than the wider cohort that contributed
to the 0.7 per cent cumulative incidence, which included dogs of
just a few months of age but 9.7 per cent (or even 7.1 per cent)
was an unexpectedly high value. This may be due to ambiguity
regarding diagnosis; as mentioned previously, limber tail is a
diagnosis of exclusion. Furthermore, given that there appears to
be an environmental component to limber tail, this new esti-
mate may also be an under-estimate in terms of susceptibility
because many more dogs may never be exposed to triggering
environmental risk factors.
While it is surprising that so many of the controls were actu-
ally cases that owners had not mentioned previously, routine
reporting to Dogslife identified more potential cases than were
presented to veterinarians. The study reveals a previously unsus-
pected burden of the condition. This fits with the phenomenon
known as the ‘symptom iceberg’ described in people (Last and
Adelaide 1963) whereby symptoms of illness presented to
doctors are just a small proportion of all symptoms of illness
suffered.
Owner perception of the pain caused and impact on the
dog’s quality of life was quantified with a relatively high mean
of 6.3 out of 10 for pain levels. The subjectivity of both measures
makes the results interesting because while only two owners
reported a zero pain score, five owners, including two owners
who gave pain scores greater than seven, gave zero for the
impact on quality of life. The difference was not obviously
explained by the reported number of episodes and duration of
signs. There was a strong correlation between the two measures,
but some owners perceived high pain levels to have no impact
on the dog’s quality of life. This finding is similar to previous
work indicating that, when considering quality of life, owners
do not consider just pain but also the dog’s ability to perform its
normal daily activities (Brown and others 2013).

 Of all 53 incidents, only 11 prompted a veterinary visit and
all 11 visits related to different dogs. The perception of some
owners that the condition has minimal impact on quality of life
may be one underlying reason for not seeking veterinary advice.
It may also reflect owner familiarity with the condition. Once
encountered, an owner would likely recognise future incidents
and be aware that the signs will resolve without intervention.
Nevertheless, by implication, investigations using data collected
at veterinary practices would miss nearly three-quarters of dogs
exhibiting signs consistent with the condition.
This study has shown that aspects of lifestyle are associated
with limber tail incidence but no associations were found with
dog height, weight, coat colour, household type, owner smoking
status and reported exercise levels in this cohort. Initial compari-
sons of the pedigrees of the cases and controls indicate that there
may be an underlying genetic risk factor, which should be inves-
tigated further to give a better overall picture of disease aeti-
ology. Given the environmental risks, the data suggest that a
gene–environment interaction is responsible for mediating the
disease.
The study demonstrates that it is possible to collect
condition-specific information from Dogslife contributors via
a specific questionnaire. The data were not collected contem-
poraneously so they may be subject to recall bias but the
extra information collated was invaluable for better character-
ising the condition and the risks for its development. It
enabled tail-related signs associated with limber tail to be
described.
The authors highlight the need for further such investiga-
tions. It is hoped that future work by the Dogslife project team
will enable the identification of genes associated with limber
tail. Such an investigation would be complicated by environmen-
tal risk factors because it will be difficult to determine whether
dogs that had no report of limber tail were truly not susceptible
to the condition or had simply not been exposed to factors
which might lead to the development of signs. Nevertheless, it
appears that the extent of limber tail has been underestimated
and if a genetic predisposition could be identified, breeding stock
could be selected to reduce the prevalence of the condition, par-
ticularly in working dogs.
