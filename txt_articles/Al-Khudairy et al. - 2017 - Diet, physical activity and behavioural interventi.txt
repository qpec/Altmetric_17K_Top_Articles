Background
Adolescent overweight and obesity has increased globally, and can be associated with short- and long-term health consequences.
Modifying known dietary and behavioural risk factors through behaviour changing interventions (BCI) may help to reduce childhood
overweight and obesity. This is an update of a review published in 2009.
Objectives
To assess the effects of diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obese adolescents aged
12 to 17 years.
Search methods
We performed a systematic literature search in: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, and the trial registers
ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP Search Portal. We checked references of identified studies and systematic reviews. There were no language
restrictions. The date of the last search was July 2016 for all databases.
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for treating overweight or
obesity in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias, evaluated the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument and
extracted data following the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We contacted trial authors for
additional information.

 Main results
We included 44 completed RCTs (4781 participants) and 50 ongoing studies. The number of participants in each trial varied (10 to
521) as did the length of follow-up (6 to 24 months). Participants ages ranged from 12 to 17.5 years in all trials that reported mean
age at baseline. Most of the trials used a multidisciplinary intervention with a combination of diet, physical activity and behavioural
components. The content and duration of the intervention, its delivery and the comparators varied across trials. The studies contributing
most information to outcomes of weight and body mass index (BMI) were from studies at a low risk of bias, but studies with a high
risk of bias provided data on adverse events and quality of life.
The mean difference (MD) of the change in BMI at the longest follow-up period in favour of BCI was -1.18 kg/m2 (95% confidence
interval (CI) -1.67 to -0.69); 2774 participants; 28 trials; low quality evidence. BCI lowered the change in BMI z score by -0.13 units
(95% CI -0.21 to -0.05); 2399 participants; 20 trials; low quality evidence. BCI lowered body weight by -3.67 kg (95% CI -5.21 to -
2.13); 1993 participants; 20 trials; moderate quality evidence. The effect on weight measures persisted in trials with 18 to 24 months’
follow-up for both BMI (MD -1.49 kg/m2 (95% CI -2.56 to -0.41); 760 participants; 6 trials and BMI z score MD -0.34 (95% CI -
0.66 to -0.02); 602 participants; 5 trials).
There were subgroup differences showing larger effects for both BMI and BMI z score in studies comparing interventions with no
intervention/wait list control or usual care, compared with those testing concomitant interventions delivered to both the intervention
and control group. There were no subgroup differences between interventions with and without parental involvement or by intervention
type or setting (health care, community, school) or mode of delivery (individual versus group).
The rate of adverse events in intervention and control groups was unclear with only five trials reporting harms, and of these, details were
provided in only one (low quality evidence). None of the included studies reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity or socioeconomic
effects.
BCIs at the longest follow-up moderately improved adolescent’s health-related quality of life (standardised mean difference 0.44 ((95%
CI 0.09 to 0.79); P = 0.01; 972 participants; 7 trials; 8 comparisons; low quality of evidence) but not self-esteem.
Trials were inconsistent in how they measured dietary intake, dietary behaviours, physical activity and behaviour.
Authors’ conclusions
We found low quality evidence that multidisciplinary interventions involving a combination of diet, physical activity and behavioural
components reduce measures of BMI and moderate quality evidence that they reduce weight in overweight or obese adolescents, mainly
when compared with no treatment or waiting list controls. Inconsistent results, risk of bias or indirectness of outcome measures used
mean that the evidence should be interpreted with caution. We have identified a large number of ongoing trials (50) which we will
include in future updates of this review.

Review question
How effective are diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions in reducing the weight of overweight or obese adolescents aged
12 to 17 years?
Background
Across the world, more adolescents are becoming overweight and obese. These adolescents are more likely to suffer from health problems
in later life. More information is needed about what works best in treating this problem.
Study characteristics
We found 44 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups)
comparing diet, physical activity and behavioural (where habits are changed or improved) treatments (interventions) to a variety
of control groups delivered to 4781 overweight or obese adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Our systematic review reports on the
effects of multidisciplinary interventions, dietary interventions and physical activity interventions compared with a control group (no

 intervention, ’usual care,’ enhanced usual care or some other therapy if it was also delivered to the intervention group). The adolescents
in the included studies were monitored (called follow-up) for between six months and two years.
Key results
The average age of adolescents ranged from 12 to 17.5 years. Most studies reported the body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure of body
fat and is calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by the square of the body height measured in metres (kg/m2). We summarised the
results of 28 studies in 2774 adolescents reporting BMI, which on average was 1.18 kg/m2 lower in the intervention groups compared
with the control groups. We summarised the results of 20 studies in 1993 adolescents reporting weight, which on average was 3.67 kg
lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. BMI reduction was maintained at 18 to 24 months of follow-up
(monitoring participants until the end of the study), which on average was 1.49 kg/m2 lower in the intervention groups compared with
the control groups. The interventions moderately improved health-related quality of life (a measure of a person’s satisfaction with their
life and health) but we did not find firm evidence of an advantage or disadvantage of these interventions for improving self-esteem,
physical activity and food intake. No study reported on death from any cause, morbidity (illnesses) or socioeconomic effects (such as
days away from school). Three studies reported no side effects, one reported no serious side effects, one did not provide details of side
effects and the rest of the studies did not report whether side effects occurred or not.
We identified 50 ongoing studies which we will include in future updates of our review.
Currentness of evidence
This evidence is up to date as of July 2016.
Quality of the evidence
The overall quality of the evidence was rated as low for most of the outcomes (results) measured, mainly because of limited confidence
in how studies were performed, inconsistent results between the studies and the way that some outcomes used do not capture obesity
outcomes directly. Also, there were just a few studies for some outcomes, with small numbers of included adolescents.

 B A C K G R O U N D
The prevalence of overweight and obese children and adolescents
has increased throughout the world, presenting a global public
health crisis (Ng 2014; WHO 2015a). Although once considered
to be a condition affecting only high-income countries, rates of
paediatric overweight and obesity have started to rise dramatically
in some low- to middle-income countries (Wang 2012). Using
the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) standard definition,
the age-standardised prevalence of overweight and obesity in chil-
dren and adolescents has increased in both high-income and low-
to middle-income countries since the mid-1980s (Cole 2000). In
2013, the prevalence of overweight and obese children and ado-
lescents in high-income countries was estimated at 23.8% (95%
confidence interval (CI) 22.9 to 24.7) for boys and 22.6% (95%
CI 21.7 to 23.6) for girls. In low- to middle-income countries, the
prevalence was estimated as 12.9% (95% CI 12.3 to 13.5) for boys
and 13.4% (95% CI 13.0 to 13.9) for girls (Ng 2014). Very young
children are also affected. In 2010, de Onis 2010 used the World
Health Organization (WHO) growth standards (WHO 2015b)
to estimate that over 42 million children under five years of age
were overweight or obese, with approximately 35 million of these
children living in low- to middle-income countries.
Inequalities in overweight and obesity prevalence have also been
documented. Generally, socioeconomically disadvantaged chil-
dren in high-income countries (Knai 2012; Shrewsbury 2008),
and children of higher socioeconomic status in low- to middle-in-
come countries (Lobstein 2004; Wang 2012) are at greater risk of
becomingoverweight. However, thisrelationshipmayvarybypop-
ulation demographics (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity), and environ-
ment (e.g. country, urbanisation) (Wang 2012). The prevalence of
obesity varies by ethnicity, with large data sets showing substantial
ethnic variation in English (HSCIC 2015), US (Freedman 2006;
Skinner 2014), and New Zealand (Rajput 2014) child popula-
tions.
While there is some evidence that the rate of increase in paedi-
atric obesity may be slowing in some high-income countries, cur-
rent levels remain too high, and continue to rise in many low-
to middle-income countries (Olds 2011; Rokholm 2010). How-
ever, an additional concern in some high-income countries such
as the USA (Kelly 2013; Skinner 2014), and England (CMO
2015; Ells 2015), is the rise in severe paediatric obesity. While
the IOTF published an international definition for severe paedi-
atric (morbid) obesity in 2012 (Cole 2012), often severe obesity
prevalence is reported using country-specific cut-off points mak-
ing international comparisons difficult. However, data from the
USA (Skinner 2014), and England (Ells 2015), have shown that
the prevalence of severe paediatric obesity varies by socioeconomic
status and ethnicity, and may result in a greater risk of adverse car-
diometabolic events and severe obesity in adulthood (Kelly 2013).
Description of the condition
Childhood overweight and obesity results from an accumulation
of excess body fat, and can increase the risk of both short- and
longer-term health consequences. Numerous obesity-related co
morbidities can develop during childhood, which include mus-
cular skeletal complaints (Paulis 2014); cardiovascular risk fac-
tors such as hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperlipidaemia
(Reilly 2003), even in very young children (Bocca 2013); and
conditions such as such as sleep apnoea (Narang 2012), asthma
(Egan 2013), liver disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (Daniels
2009; Lobstein 2004). The condition can also affect psychoso-
cial well-being, with obese young people susceptible to reduced
self-esteem and health-related quality of life (Griffiths 2010), and
stigmatisation (Puhl 2007; Tang-Peronard 2008). Evidence also
shows that childhood obesity can track into adulthood (Parsons
1999; Singh 2008; Whitaker 1997), and is therefore associated
with an increased risk of ill health later in life (Reilly 2003).
Description of the intervention
Given the serious implications associated with childhood and ado-
lescent obesity, effective treatment is imperative. While the fun-
damental principles of weight management in children and ado-
lescents are the same as in adults (i.e. reduced energy intake and
increased energy expenditure), the primary aim of treatment (i.e.
weight reduction or deceleration of weight gain) and the most suit-
able intervention approach vary, and are dependent on the child’s
age and degree of excess weight, among other considerations. Be-
haviour changing interventions combining dietary, physical activ-
ity and behavioural components are effective and are considered
the current best practice in the treatment of childhood obesity in
adolescents under 18 years of age (WHO 2015c).
Adverse effects of the intervention
It is not anticipated that diet, physical activity and behavioural
interventions will lead to adverse outcomes. However, as with all
obesity treatment interventions in children and young people, po-
tential adverse effects should be considered, including effects on
linear growth, eating disorders and psychological well-being.
How the intervention might work
The cause of childhood obesity is multifactorial, including dietary,
activity, behavioural and environmental factors (Orsi 2011). Mod-
ifying these factors by behaviour changing interventions is con-
sidered the line of treatment of childhood overweight and obe-
sity (Spear 2007). Behaviour changing interventions aim to im-
prove dietary intake, increase activity levels, reduce sedentary be-
haviour, provide techniques to sustain healthy lifestyle and may
have parental or family involvement (Kothandan 2014). Interven-
tions may target one behavioural component (diet only or physical
7

 activity only) while other interventions integrate several compo-
nents (diet, physical activity and behavioural modification) that
seem to show promising results in decreasing overweight and obe-
sity in adolescents (Jelalian 1999). Behavioural modification is of-
ten based on theoretical elements such as cognitive behavioural
theory to help adolescents sustain changes and minimise relapse
(Doak 2006). Theory-based interventions address different ele-
ments such as healthy food choices, environmental control, pos-
itive thinking and goal-setting that appear to be linked to pos-
itive weight outcomes (Dewar 2013; MacDonell 2010; White
2004). Earlier systematic reviews showed that behaviour chang-
ing interventions improved weight reduction in children aged 19
and younger (Ho 2012; Wilfley 2007), while one systematic re-
view by Kelly and colleagues showed that interventions address-
ing nutrition, physical activity and behavioural skills with parental
involvement appears to be an effective way to reduce adolescent
obesity (Kelly 2008). One systematic review by Ruotsalainen and
colleagues showed that supervised physical activity interventions
have afavourable effectonadolescentBMI. Ruotsalainenacknowl-
edged the importance of complex interventions that involve be-
havioural modification and management in the implementation
of physical activity in adolescents (Ruotsalainen 2015), while the
effect of dietary interventions remains unclear. One systematic re-
view by Collins and colleagues found inconsistent evidence on
the role of dietetic interventions in the treatment of childhood
obesity (Collins 2006). However, the length, delivery setting and
long-term effect of behaviour changing interventions in the treat-
ment of adolescent obesity remains unclear (Ho 2012; McGovern
2008; Wilfley 2007). The importance of behaviour changing in-
terventions in treating childhood obesity has led to questioning
their effectiveness in adolescents and whether different types of
behavioural modification are more effective than others.
Why it is important to do this review
The first version of this systematic review was published in 2003
and included analysis of childhood obesity treatment trials pub-
lished up to July 2001 (Summerbell 2003). The second version
was published in 2009 providing an update to the 2003 review
(Oude Luttikhuis 2009). To reflect the rapid growth in this field,
the third update to this review has been split across six reviews
focusing on the following treatment approaches: surgery; drugs;
parent-only interventions; diet, physical activity and behavioural
interventions for young children aged 0 to 6 years; school children
aged 5 to 11 years and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. The current
review examines the effectiveness of interventions for adolescents
aged 12 to 17 years. Previous systematic reviews identified gaps
in research assessing interventions specifically for this age group
(Doak 2006). Other systematic reviews did not focus on adoles-
cents specifically (Ho 2012; Peirson 2015; Wilfley 2007) or fo-
cused on specific interventions (Ruotsalainen 2015). This review
has extended the evidence base by including trials of any form of
behaviour changing intervention aimed to treat obesity in adoles-
cents aged 12 to 17 years. It also includes the effect of behaviour
changing interventions on other adiposity indicators (e.g. waist
circumference, body fat), behavioural change, quality of life, self-
esteem and views of the intervention. The results of this current
review and other systematic reviews in this series will provide in-
formation on which to underpin clinical guidelines and health
policy on the treatment of childhood obesity.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled clinical trials (RCT). For
cross-over trials, we only analysed the first phase before cross-over
(if this was six months or more) to avoid the potential of carry over
effects. Included studies observed participants for a minimum of
six months (this time frame refers to the intervention itself or to a
combination of the intervention with a follow-up phase).
Types of participants
We included studies of overweight or obese adolescents with a
mean study age of 12 to 17 years at the commencement of the
intervention. We excluded studies of critically ill people, pregnant
or breastfeeding women, or adolescents with a syndromic cause
for their obesity (e.g. Prader-Willi syndrome).
Diagnostic criteria
Any method of overweight or obesity classification was acceptable.
Types of interventions
We planned to investigate the following comparisons of interven-
tion versus control/comparator.
Intervention
Any form of behaviour changing intervention with a primary aim
to treat overweight or obesity. Behaviour changing interventions
included any form of dietary, physical activity, behavioural ther-
apy, or a combination of these delivered as a single or multicom-
ponent intervention, in any setting, using any delivery method
8

 and included studies which examined weight loss or maintenance
or both.
Comparator
No treatment/wait list control, usual care or an alternative con-
comitant therapy providing it is delivered in the intervention arm.
Concomitant interventions had to be the same in the intervention
and comparator groups to establish fair comparisons.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Changes in measured BMI or body weight.
• Adverse events.
Secondary outcomes
• Health-related quality of life.
• Self-esteem.
• All-cause mortality.
• Morbidity.
• Anthropometric measures other than BMI.
• Behaviour change.
• Participants’ views of the intervention.
• Socioeconomic effects.
• Parenting skill and relationships.
Method and timing of outcome measurement
• Changes in BMI (kg/m2) and body weight (kg): measured
at baseline and at least at six months.
• Adverse events: defined as an adverse outcome that
occurred during or after the intervention but was not necessarily
caused by it, and measured at baseline and at least at six months.
• Health-related quality of life: evaluated by a validated
instrument such as Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory and
measured at baseline and at least at six months.
• Self-esteem: evaluated by a validated instrument such as
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and measured at baseline and at
least at six months.
• All-cause mortality: defined as any death that occurred
during or after the intervention and measured at six months or
later. Morbidity: defined as illness or harm associated with the
intervention and measured at baseline and six months or later.
• Anthropometric measures other than change in BMI:
defined by validated tools such as waist circumference, skin-fold
thickness, waist-to-hip ratio, dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
or bioelectrical impedance analysis and measured at baseline and
at least at six months.
• Behaviour change: defined as validated measures of diet and
physical activity and measured at baseline and at least at six
months. Participants’ views of the intervention: defined as
documented accounts from participant feedback and measured
at baseline and at least at six months.
• Parent-child relationship or assessment of parenting:
evaluated by a validated instrument and measured at baseline
and at least at six months.
• Socioeconomic effects defined as a validated measure of
socioeconomic status such as parental income or educational
status and measured at baseline and at least at six months.

Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We searched the following sources from inception of each database
to 14 July 2016 and placed no restrictions on the language of
publication.
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 6).
• Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed
Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R)
(from 1946).
• Embase Ovid (1974 to 2016 week 28).

Information database) (last update 8 July 2016).
• ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov).
• WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (
ICTRP) ( www.who.int/trialsearch/).
We continuously applied a MEDLINE (via OvidSP) e-mail alert
service established by the Cochrane Metabolic and Endocrine Dis-
orders Group (CMED) to identify newly published studies using
the same search strategy as described for MEDLINE (for details
on search strategies and search platforms, see Appendix 1). Should
we have identified new studies for inclusion, we planned to eval-
uate these, incorporated findings in our review and resubmitted
another review draft (Beller 2013).
If we detected additional relevant key words during any of the
electronic or other searches, we modified the electronic search
strategies to incorporate these terms and documented the changes.

trials, (systematic) reviews, meta-analyses and health technology
assessment reports. We also contacted study authors of included
trials to identify any further studies that we may have missed.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (two of LA-K, RJ, EL, JC, KR, CO, LA, EM,
LE, HF, JO) independently scanned the abstract, title, or both,
of every record retrieved, to determine which studies should be
assessed further. We investigated all potentially relevant articles
as full text. We resolved any discrepancies through consensus or
recourse to a third review author (of KR, EL, LA-K). Where reso-
lution of a disagreement was not possible, we added the article to
those ’awaiting assessment’ and contacted study authors for clari-
fication. We present an adapted PRISMA flow chart showing the
process of study selection (Liberati 2009).
Data extraction and management
For studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, two review authors
(of LA-K, EL, JC, RJ, CO, LA, EM, KR, HF, RV, MM, JO) inde-
pendently abstracted key participant and intervention character-
istics and reported data on efficacy outcomes and adverse events
using standard data extraction templates as supplied by Cochrane
Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group, with any disagree-
ments to be resolved by discussion, or, if required, by consultation
with a third review author (KR or EL) (for details, see Table 1;
Appendix 2; Appendix 3; Appendix 4; Appendix 5; Appendix 6;
Appendix 7; Appendix 8; Appendix 9; Appendix 10).
We provided information including trial identifier about poten-
tially relevant ongoing studies in the Characteristics of ongoing
studies table and in Appendix 5 (Matrix of study endpoints (pub-
lications and trial documents)). We tried to find the protocol of
each included study and reported primary, secondary and other
outcomes in comparison with data in publications in Appendix 5.
We e-mailed all authors of included studies to enquire whether
they were willing to answer questions regarding their trials.
Appendix 10 shows the results of this survey. Thereafter, we sought
relevant missing information on the trial from the primary au-
thor(s) of the article, if required.
Dealing with duplicate and companion publications
In the event of duplicate publications, companion documents or
multiple reports of a primary study, we tried to maximise yield
of information by collating all available data and use the most
complete data set aggregated across all known publications. In case
of doubt, we gave priority to the publication reporting the longest
follow-up associated with our primary or secondary outcomes.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We used the Cochrane ’risk of bias’ assessment tool (Higgins
2011a; Higgins 2011b), and evaluated the following criteria.
• Random sequence generation (selection bias).
• Allocation concealment (selection bias).
• Imbalances in baseline characteristics.
• Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias).
• Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias).
• Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias).
• Selective reporting (reporting bias).
• Other potential sources of bias.
We judged the above ’Risk of bias’ criteria as ’low risk’, ’high risk’
or ’unclear risk’ and evaluated individual bias items as described
in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Higgins 2011a). We present a ’Risk of bias’ graph and a ’Risk of
bias summary’. We assessed the impact of individual bias domains
on study results at endpoint and study levels. In case of high risk
of selection bias, all endpoints investigated in the associated study
were marked as ’high risk’.
We evaluated whether imbalances in baseline characteristics ex-
isted and how these were addressed (Egbewale 2014).
For performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel) and
detection bias (blinding of outcome assessors) we evaluated the
risk of bias separately for each outcome type (objective and subjec-
tive) (Hróbjartsson 2013). We noted whether endpoints were self-
reported, investigator-assessed or adjudicated outcome measures.
We considered the implications of missing outcome data from
individual participants per outcome such as high dropout rates
(e.g. above 15%) or disparate attrition rates (e.g. difference of 10%
or more between study arms).
We assessed outcome reporting bias by integrating the results
of ’Examination of outcome reporting bias’ (Kirkham 2010)
(Appendix 6), in the ’Matrix of study endpoints (publications and
trial documents)’ (Appendix 5), and ’Outcomes (outcomes re-
ported in abstract of publication)’ section of the Characteristics
of included studies table. This analysis formed the basis for the
judgement of selective reporting (reporting bias).
We defined the following endpoints as potentially self-reported
outcomes.
• Adverse events.
• Health-related quality of life.
• Participant’s views of the intervention.
• Changes in body weight.
• Self-esteem.
• Behaviour change.
We defined the following outcomes as potentially investigator-
assessed outcomes.
• Changes in BMI and body weight.
10

 • Adverse events.
• All-cause mortality.
• Morbidity.
Measures of treatment effect
We expressed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk ratios
(RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We expressed con-
tinuous data as mean differences (MD) if they used the same in-
struments or standardised mean differences (SMD) if they used
different instruments with 95% CI. We expressed time-to-event
data as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs.
We included studies reporting multiple comparison groups in this
review. Where this was the case, we considered whether the aim
of the trial was to test for differences between these groups, and
whether the study authors found a significant difference. Where
there were no demonstrated differences, we merged groups as rec-
ommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of In-
terventions (Section 7.7.8, Higgins 2011a). In studies that found a
difference between groups, we used the data for the control group
for each intervention group comparison and reduced the weight
assigned to the control group by dividing the number of partici-
pants in the control group by the number of intervention groups.
Unit of analysis issues
We used data from the first period of cross-over trials if available.
We collected data from the latest available time point in the fol-
low-up reported in the studies to avoid double-counting trials in
the same analysis. For cluster RCTs, we used the denominator re-
ported in the trial and considered how the analysis methods used
took account of the effect of clustering. Due to the small number
of cluster RCTs found, we decided not to adjust the data so we
performed sensitivity analyses to ascertain if the results were sen-
sitive to the inclusion of studies with a cluster design.
Dealing with missing data
We obtained relevant missing data from study authors, if feasible,
and evaluated important numerical data such as screened, eligible,
randomised participants as well as intention-to-treat (ITT), as-
treated and per-protocol populations. We investigated attrition
rates (e.g. dropouts, losses to follow-up and withdrawals), and
critically appraised issues of missing data and imputation methods
(e.g. last observation carried forward (LOCF)).
Where standard deviations (SD) for outcomes were not reported,
and we did not receive information from study authors, we im-
puted these values by assuming the SD of the missing outcome
to be the same as the largest SD from those studies where this
information was reported. We investigated the impact of imputa-
tion on meta-analyses by means of sensitivity analyses. Where pa-
pers did not report results as change from baseline, we calculated
this and for the SD differences followed the methods presented in
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention for
imputing these (Section 16.1.3.2, Higgins 2011a), and assumed
a correlation of 0.5 between baseline and follow-up measures as
suggested by Follmann 1992.
Assessment of heterogeneity
In the event of substantial clinical or methodological heterogene-
ity, we did not report study results as meta-analytically pooled ef-
fect estimates. We identified heterogeneity by visual inspection of
forest plots and by using a standard Chi2 test with a significance
level of α = 0.1, in view of the low power of this test. We exam-
ined heterogeneity using the I2 statistic, which quantifies incon-
sistency across studies to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the
meta-analysis (Higgins 2002; Higgins 2003), where an I2 statis-
tic of 75% or more indicates a considerable level of inconsistency
(Higgins 2011a).
When we found heterogeneity, we attempted to determine po-
tential reasons for it by examining individual study and subgroup
characteristics.
Assessment of reporting biases
If we included 10 studies or more for a given outcome, we used
funnel plots to assess small-study effects. Due to several explana-
tions for funnel plot asymmetry, we interpreted results carefully
(Sterne 2011).
Data synthesis
Unless there is good evidence for homogeneous effects across stud-
ies we primarily summarised low risk of bias data using a random-
effects model (Wood 2008). We interpreted random-effects meta-
analyses with due consideration of the whole distribution of ef-
fects, ideally by presenting a prediction interval (Higgins 2009).
A prediction interval specifies a predicted range for the true treat-
ment effect in an individual study (Riley 2011). In addition, we
performed statistical analyses according to the statistical guidelines
presented in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of In-
terventions (Higgins 2011a).
Quality of evidence
We presented the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome
according to the GRADE approach which takes into account is-
sues related to internal validity (risk of bias, inconsistency, impre-
cision, publication bias)and also to external validity, such as di-
rectness of results. Two review authors (LA-K and KR/EL) rated
the quality for each outcome. We presented a summary of the ev-
idence in a Summary of findings for the main comparison, which
provides key information about the best estimate of the magnitude
of the effect, in relative terms and absolute differences for each rel-
evant comparison of alternative management strategies, numbers
of participants and studies addressing each important outcome
and the rating of the overall confidence in effect estimates for each
11

 outcome. We created the ’Summary of findings’ table based on
the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a). We presented results on
the outcomes as described in Types of outcome measures. If meta-
analysis was not possible, we presented results in a narrative ’Sum-
mary of findings’ table.
In addition, we established an appendix ’Checklist to aid con-
sistency and reproducibility of GRADE assessments’ (Meader
2014) to help with standardisation of ’Summary of findings’ tables
(Appendix 9).
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We expected the following characteristics to introduce clinical het-
erogeneity, and planned to carry out subgroup analyses with in-
vestigation of interactions for our primary outcomes.
• Duration of follow-up.
• Duration of the intervention.
• Duration of postintervention follow-up.
• Type of comparator group.
• Mode of delivery of the intervention.
• Setting.
• Type of intervention.
• Theoretical basis to the intervention.
• Parental involvement.
Sensitivity analysis
We planned to perform sensitivity analyses to explore the influence
of the following factors on effect size.
• Restricting the analysis to published studies, and by
publication language.
• Restricting the analysis taking into account risk of bias, as
specified in the section Assessment of risk of bias in included
studies section.
• Restricting the analysis to studies of adolescents without
specific health conditions.
• Restricting the analysis to studies with no uncertainties
(such as study duration, imputed data).
We also tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analy-
sis using different measures of effect size (RRs, ORs, etc.) and dif-
ferent statistical models (fixed-effect and random-effects models).

Results of the search
This search is up to date as of July 2016 in addition to ongoing e-
mail alerts from MEDLINE. The searches generated 16,106 hits
after duplicates were removed. Fifty-two additional records were
identified through non-database sources. Screening of titles and
abstracts identified 736 records to go forward for formal inclusion
and exclusion. Forty-four completed RCTs fulfilled the inclusion
criteria and were included in the review. For a detailed description
of the included trials, see the Characteristics of included studies
table. The search identified 50 ongoing trials, which are reported
in the Characteristics of ongoing studies table. The flow of trials
through the review is presented in Figure 1.

 Included studies
A detailed description of the characteristics of included studies is
presented elsewhere (see Characteristics of included studies and
Appendix 2; Appendix 3; Appendix 4; Appendix 5; Appendix
6; Appendix 7; Appendix 8; Appendix 11). The following is a
succinct overview.
Source of data
All data presented in the review were obtained from the published
literature. We contacted all study authors for additional informa-
tion and results are presented in Appendix 10.
Comparisons
To meet the inclusion criteria for the review comparators could
be no treatment, usual care or a concomitant therapy provid-
ing it was also included in the intervention group. In nine tri-
als the comparator was either no intervention or a wait list con-
trol (Brennan 2013; Carraway 2014; Ebbeling 2012; Luna-Pech
2014; Pakpour 2015; Patsopoulou 2017; Schranz 2014; Toulabi
2012; Vos 2011). Twenty-three studies used usual care com-
parators (Bean 2014; Boodai 2014; Carrel 2005; Christie 2011;
Daley 2005; Debar 2012; Ebbeling 2003; Ford 2010; Gourlan
2013; Hofsteenge 2014; Jiang 2005; Kong 2013; Love-Osborne
2014; NCT00132132; NCT00807560; Patrick 2013; Pbert
2013; Pitetti 2007; Saelens 2002; Savoye 2007; Vissers 2008;
Visuthranukul 2015; van Egmond-Frohlich 2006). Twelve trials
used a concomitant therapy (Brownell 1983; Chandra 1968; Grey
2009; Jelalian 2016; Kong 2014; Nguyen 2012; Norman 2016;
Resnicow 2005; Sigal 2014; Walpole 2013; Wengle 2011; Wong
2015).
Overview of trial populations
The 44 trials included 4781 participants. Approximately 2555
were randomised to an intervention and 1850 to a comparator.
The proportion of participants finishing the study, where reported,
ranged from 34% to 100% in the intervention groups and from
38% to 100% in the comparator groups. Individual sample size
ranged from 10 to 521.
Study design
Thirty-nine trials were parallel comparisons with individual ran-
domisation. Four trials were cluster RCTs (Grey 2009; Kong
2013; Pbert 2013; Resnicow 2005), and one was a cross-over trial
(Brennan 2013). All 44 trials had a superiority design. Five tri-
als had three arms (Brownell 1983; Daley 2005; Norman 2016;
Pakpour 2015; Patsopoulou 2017), and two trials had four arms
(Patrick 2013; Sigal 2014). The majority (24) were single centre
trials, although the number of centres was unclear or not reported
in 10 trials. Two trials had six centres (Grey 2009; Kong 2013),
and one study each had two (Brennan 2013), eight (Pbert 2013),
10 (Resnicow 2005), 12 (Toulabi 2012), 15 (Patsopoulou 2017)
or 18 (Patrick 2013) centres. Trials were performed from 1968 to
2015. The duration of the intervention ranged from six weeks to
two years, and the duration of follow-up ranged from six months
to two years. Eight trials had some form of run-in period prior to
the start of the study (Brownell 1983; Chandra 1968; Luna-Pech
2014; Norman 2016; Pitetti 2007; Schranz 2014; Sigal 2014;
Wengle 2011). None of the trials was terminated early.
Settings
The interventions were carried out in a variety of settings. These
included in schools in nine trials (Carrel 2005; Grey 2009;
Jiang 2005; Kong 2013; Love-Osborne 2014; Pbert 2013; Pitetti
2007; Toulabi 2012; Vissers 2008), in the community or home
in eight trials (Ebbeling 2012; Nguyen 2012; Patrick 2013;
Patsopoulou 2017; Resnicow 2005; Saelens 2002; Schranz 2014;
Sigal 2014), and various healthcare settings, including outpa-
tients, primary care, research clinics and other hospital sites in
26 trials (based on author locations where the study did not ex-
plicitly report this) (Bean 2014; Boodai 2014; Brennan 2013;
Brownell 1983; Carraway 2014; Chandra 1968; Christie 2011;
Daley 2005; Debar 2012; Ebbeling 2003; Ford 2010; Gourlan
2013; Hofsteenge 2014; Jelalian 2016; Kong 2014; Luna-Pech
2014; NCT00132132; NCT00807560; Norman 2016; Pakpour
2015; Savoye 2007; Visuthranukul 2015; Vos 2011; Walpole
2013; Wengle 2011; Wong 2015).
Participants
The diagnostic criteria for overweight and obesity differed be-
tween the trials. Twelve trials included participants with BMI
on or above the 85th percentile for age and height (Bean 2014;
Carraway 2014; Ebbeling 2012; Grey 2009; Jelalian 2016; Kong
2013; Love-Osborne 2014; NCT00132132; NCT00807560;
Pbert 2013; Walpole 2013; Wengle 2011), nine trials used a cut-
off of on or above the 95th percentile (Boodai 2014; Carrel 2005;
Ebbeling 2003; Ford 2010; Kong2014; Luna-Pech 2014; Norman
2016; Pakpour 2015; Savoye 2007), three trials used a cut-off
of on or above the 90th percentile (Debar 2012; Gourlan 2013;
Resnicow 2005), and two trials used a cut-off of on or above the
98th percentile (Christie 2011; Daley 2005). The remaining trials
used a range of different criteria to define overweight or obesity
for inclusion in the trials (Characteristics of included studies table;
Appendix 3).
Thirty-four trials reported the mean BMI at baseline (Brennan
2013; Brownell 1983; Carrel 2005; Christie 2011; Debar 2012;
Ebbeling 2003; Ebbeling 2012; Ford 2010; Gourlan 2013;
Grey 2009; Hofsteenge 2014; Jelalian 2016; Jiang 2005; Kong
2014; Love-Osborne 2014; Luna-Pech 2014; NCT00807560;
Nguyen 2012; Norman 2016; Pakpour 2015; Patsopoulou 2017;
Pbert 2013; Pitetti 2007; Resnicow 2005; Saelens 2002; Savoye
2007; Schranz 2014; Sigal 2014; Toulabi 2012; Vissers 2008;
Visuthranukul 2015; Vos 2011; Walpole 2013; Wengle 2011)
and ranged from 26 kg/m2 to 37 kg/m2 in all but one study
14

 (Brownell 1983), which was an outlier with BMIs in the three
study groups ranging from 42 kg/m2 to 45.5 kg/m2. Sixteen trials
reported BMI z scores (Bean 2014; Boodai 2014; Brennan 2013;
Carraway 2014; Daley 2005; Love-Osborne 2014; Luna-Pech
2014; NCT00807560; Nguyen 2012; Norman 2016; Pakpour
2015; Patrick 2013; Pbert 2013; Vos 2011; Walpole 2013; Wengle
2011), and these ranged across all trials between 1.8 and 3.2 with
the exception of one study (Vos 2011), which had a mean BMI
Standard Deviation Score (SDS) of 4.2. One study reported BMI
percentile only at baseline (at 94.5%) (Kong 2013), and two trials
did not report BMI measures at baseline (Chandra 1968; Gourlan
2013). Twenty trials reported on change in weight.
Thirty-seven trials reported the gender of the study partici-
pants (Bean 2014; Boodai 2014; Brennan 2013; Brownell 1983;
Carrel 2005; Chandra 1968; Christie 2011; Daley 2005; Debar
2012; Ebbeling 2003; Ebbeling 2012; Ford 2010; Gourlan
2013; Grey 2009; Hofsteenge 2014; Jelalian 2016; Jiang 2005;
Kong 2013; Kong 2014; Love-Osborne 2014; Luna-Pech 2014;
NCT00132132; NCT00807560; Nguyen 2012; Norman 2016;
Pakpour 2015; Patrick 2013; Pbert 2013; Pitetti 2007; Resnicow
2005; Savoye 2007; Schranz 2014; Sigal 2014; Vissers 2008;
Visuthranukul 2015; Vos 2011; Walpole 2013, and the propor-
tion of participants who were female ranged from 33% to 77%
in all cases except the trials by Debar 2012 and Resnicow 2005
where all participants were female, and Schranz 2014 where all
participants were male. Four trials did not report the gender of par-
ticipants at baseline (Saelens 2002; Toulabi 2012; Wengle 2011;
Wong 2015). Participants ages ranged from 12 to 17.5 years in all
trials that reported mean age at baseline, 11 trials did not report
mean age at baseline (Brennan 2013; Brownell 1983; Chandra
1968; Christie 2011; Daley2005; Gourlan2013; NCT00132132;
Resnicow 2005; Saelens 2002; Toulabi 2012; Wong 2015).
Nineteen trials reported ethnicity (Bean 2014; Brownell 1983;
Carraway 2014; Daley 2005; Debar 2012; Ebbeling 2012; Ford
2010; Grey 2009; Hofsteenge 2014; Jelalian 2016; Kong 2013;
Love-Osborne 2014; Norman 2016; Patrick 2013; Pbert 2013;
Resnicow 2005; Savoye 2007; Sigal 2014; Vos 2011). Most trials
reported a mixture of ethnic backgrounds for their participants
as can be seen in Appendix 3, two trials reported exclusively on
African-Americans (Resnicow 2005) and participants described as
’white’ (Brownell 1983).
Three trials focused on participants with specific conditions,
Jelalian 2016 included people with depression, Luna-Pech 2014
included people with asthma and Pitetti 2007 included people
with autism living in a residential school.
Interventions
Thirty-four trials included interventions that were multidisci-
plinary (Bean 2014; Boodai 2014; Brennan 2013; Brownell
1983; Christie 2011; Daley 2005; Debar 2012; Gourlan
2013; Grey 2009; Hofsteenge 2014; Jelalian 2016; Jiang 2005;
Kong 2013; Kong 2014; Love-Osborne 2014; NCT00132132;
NCT00807560; Nguyen 2012; Norman 2016; Pakpour 2015;
Patrick 2013; Patsopoulou 2017; Pbert 2013; Resnicow 2005;
Saelens 2002; Savoye 2007; Sigal 2014; Toulabi 2012; van
Egmond-Frohlich 2006; Vissers 2008; Vos 2011; Walpole 2013;
Wengle 2011; Wong 2015), where the focus was on at least two
components of diet, physical activity and behavioural approaches
to weight management. Five trials were focused solely on di-
etary interventions (Ebbeling 2003; Ebbeling 2012; Ford 2010;
Luna-Pech 2014; Visuthranukul 2015), and five focused solely
on physical activity interventions (Carraway 2014; Carrel 2005;
Chandra 1968; Pitetti 2007; Schranz 2014). Twenty-nine tri-
als had a theoretical basis to their interventions, these included
six which had a cognitive behavioural or social cognitive the-
oretical basis (Hofsteenge 2014; Jelalian 2016; Nguyen 2012;
Norman 2016; Pbert 2013; Vos 2011), eight which used mo-
tivational interviewing approaches (Bean 2014; Brennan 2013;
Christie 2011; Gourlan 2013; Love-Osborne 2014; Pakpour
2015; Resnicow 2005; Walpole 2013), and 15 that used a va-
riety of other psychological approaches (Boodai 2014; Brownell
1983; Daley 2005; Debar 2012; Grey 2009; Jiang 2005; Kong
2013; Kong 2014; NCT00132132; Patrick 2013; Saelens 2002;
Savoye 2007; Toulabi 2012; Vissers 2008; Wengle 2011). Thir-
teen trials did not use a behavioural approach or did not report the
theoretical basis to any behavioural component of their interven-
tion (Carrel 2005; Chandra 1968; Ebbeling 2003; Ebbeling 2012;
Ford 2010; Luna-Pech 2014; NCT00807560; Patsopoulou 2017;
Pitetti 2007; Schranz 2014; Sigal 2014; Visuthranukul 2015;
Wong 2015). Twenty-six trials involved parents in the interven-
tion (Bean 2014; Boodai 2014; Brennan 2013; Brownell 1983;
Carraway 2014; Christie 2011; Daley2005; Debar2012; Ebbeling
2012; Grey 2009; Hofsteenge 2014; Jelalian 2016; Jiang 2005;
Kong 2013; Kong 2014; NCT00807560; Nguyen 2012; Norman
2016; Pakpour 2015; Patrick 2013; Resnicow 2005; Savoye 2007;
Toulabi 2012; Visuthranukul 2015; Vos 2011; Wengle 2011). In
15trials, there wasnoparental involvement(Carrel 2005; Chandra
1968; Ebbeling 2003; Ford 2010; Gourlan 2013; Love-Osborne
2014; Luna-Pech2014; NCT00132132; Pbert2013; Pitetti2007;
Saelens 2002; Schranz 2014; Sigal 2014; Vissers 2008; Walpole
2013), and in three trials there were two intervention groups, one
which included the parent and one which did not (Brownell 1983;
Pakpour 2015; Patsopoulou 2017).
Nineteen trials delivered the intervention in a group format
(Boodai 2014; Brownell 1983; Carrel 2005; Christie 2011;
Daley 2005; Debar 2012; Grey 2009; Hofsteenge 2014;

Toulabi 2012; Visuthranukul 2015; Vos 2011), for specific details
see Characteristics of included studies table. In 14 studies, the
intervention was individually based (Bean 2014; Brennan 2013;
Ebbeling 2012; Ford 2010; Gourlan 2013; Jiang 2005; Kong
2013; Kong 2014; Luna-Pech 2014; Norman 2016; Pbert 2013;
Saelens 2002; Sigal 2014; Walpole 2013), and in 10 studies, there
was a mixture of some group and some individual sessions, or

 the trial did not report the mode of delivery (Carraway 2014;
Chandra 1968; Ebbeling 2003; Jelalian 2016; Love-Osborne
2014; NCT00807560; Patrick 2013; Vissers 2008; Wengle 2011;
Wong 2015).
The duration of the intervention was six months or less in
30 trials (Bean 2014; Boodai 2014; Brennan 2013; Brownell
1983; Carraway 2014; Chandra 1968; Christie 2011; Daley

2012; Norman 2016; Patrick 2013; Pitetti 2007; Savoye 2007;
van Egmond-Frohlich 2006).
Outcomes
Twenty-three trials explicitly stated a primary endpoint in the pub-
lication (Appendix 5); in 20 of these, this was a measure of body
composition such as weight or BMI. In the trial by Schranz 2014,
the primary outcomes were exercise self-efficacy, physical self-
worth and self-esteem. In the trial by Walpole 2013, the primary
outcome was self-efficacy and in Daley 2005 the primary outcome
was physical self-perceptions. All except one of the included trials
(Chandra 1968) reported a BMI variable as an outcome; this was
BMI in 29 trials, BMI z score in 20 trials, BMI percentile in five tri-
als (15 trials reported more than one BMI variable, Brennan 2013;
Debar 2012; Hofsteenge 2014; Jiang 2005; NCT00807560;
Nguyen 2012; Norman 2016; Pakpour 2015; Patrick 2013; Pbert
2013; Saelens 2002; Savoye 2007; Visuthranukul 2015; Walpole
2013; Wengle 2011). Twenty trials reported weight and five tri-
als reported rates of adverse events as described in the Effects of
interventions section. Twenty-nine trials reported other anthro-
pometric measures (Boodai 2014; Brennan 2013; Brownell 1983;
Carraway 2014; Carrel 2005; Chandra 1968; Ebbeling 2003;
Ebbeling 2012; Ford 2010; Grey 2009; Hofsteenge 2014; Kong
2013; Kong 2014; NCT00132132; Nguyen 2012; Norman 2016;
Pakpour 2015; Patrick 2013; Patsopoulou 2017; Pbert 2013;
Saelens 2002; Savoye 2007; Schranz 2014; Sigal 2014; Toulabi
2012; Vissers 2008; Vos 2011; Walpole 2013; Wengle 2011); this
was percent body fat in 14 trials, trunk fat percentage in two
trials, waist circumference in 16 trials, waist-to-height ratio in
three trials, waist-to-hip ratio in two trials, fat mass in five tri-
als, trunk fat mass in two trials, lean mass in three trials and per-
centage of overweight in two trials. Nine trials reported health-
related quality of life (Debar 2012; Ford 2010; Hofsteenge 2014;
Nguyen 2012; Luna-Pech 2014; Pakpour 2015; Patrick 2013; van
Egmond-Frohlich 2006; Vos 2011). Nine trials reported self-es-
teem (Brennan 2013; Carraway 2014; Daley 2005; Debar 2012;
Hofsteenge 2014; Nguyen 2012; Pakpour 2015; Patrick 2013;
Schranz 2014). Eleven trials reported behavioural change in terms
of dietary intake (Brennan 2013; Ebbeling 2003; Ebbeling 2012;
Kong 2013; Kong 2014; Pakpour 2015; Patrick 2013; Pbert 2013;
Saelens 2002; Visuthranukul 2015; Wengle 2011), while four tri-
als reported dietary behaviour (Brennan 2013; Ford 2010; Grey
2009; Pakpour 2015). Twelve trials reported behavioural change
in terms of physical activity (Debar 2012; Ebbeling 2012; Gourlan
2013; Grey 2009; Jelalian 2016; Kong 2013; Kong 2014; Pakpour
2015; Pbert 2013; Saelens 2002; Sigal 2014; Wengle 2011), while
three trials reported physical activity behaviour (Grey 2009; Kong
2013; Pakpour 2015). One trials reported parenting and relation-
ships (Brennan 2013). Eight trials reported views of the interven-
tion (Brennan 2013; Christie 2011; Debar 2012; Jelalian 2016;
Nguyen 2012; Pbert 2013; Saelens 2002; Wengle 2011).
Ten trials reported outcomes at more than one time point (Debar
2012; Ebbeling 2012; Hofsteenge 2014; Jiang 2005; Nguyen
2012; Norman 2016; Patrick 2013; Resnicow 2005; Savoye 2007;
Schranz 2014).
Excluded studies
We excluded 570 of 736 articles after evaluation of the publica-
tion. The main reasons for exclusion were the intervention (aim
not focused on treating overweight/obesity and duration of inter-
vention and follow-up less than six months) and study design (not
an RCT). Many trials had other reasons for exclusion such as lack
of relevant outcomes or the control was not no intervention/usual
care or concomitant intervention as long as this was also provided
in the intervention arm (for further details see Characteristics of
excluded studies table, which lists the 44 studies that closely missed
the inclusion criteria for this review).
Studies awaiting classification
Twelve studies are awaiting classification as we await clarification
from the study authors. These may be included when this review
is updated if they meet the inclusion criteria.
Ongoing studies
Fifty studies are ongoing or have completed but results are not
available. These may be included when this review is updated if
they meet the inclusion criteria.

ments about each risk of bias item for individual studies and across
all studies, see Figure 2 and Figure 3. Many trials did not report
adequate information to assess the risk of bias and we assessed 30
trials at high risk of bias on at least one domain. We assessed 10
trials at high risk of bias on three or more domains (Daley 2005;

 Allocation
The majority of trials provided sufficient information on random
sequence generation and were judged at low risk of bias. How-
ever, most trials provided inadequate information on concealment
of allocation. Twenty-two studies reported adequate random se-
quence generation, but only 11 of these also described adequate
concealment of allocation (Boodai 2014; Christie 2011; Daley
2005; Jelalian 2016; Kong 2014; Nguyen 2012; Schranz 2014;
Sigal 2014; Visuthranukul 2015; Vos 2011; Walpole 2013), and
therefore have a low risk of selection bias. One trial described al-
location concealment and was at high risk of bias (Patsopoulou
2017). One trial was also high risk of bias for allocation conceal-
ment (NCT00807560). The risk of selection bias was uncertain
in the remaining 31 included studies.
Blinding
Only one study had a low risk of performance bias (subjec-
tive and objective outcomes) as participants and personnel were
blinded to treatment allocation (Gourlan 2013). Nineteen studies
had a high risk of performance bias for subjective and objective
outcomes (Christie 2011; Daley 2005; Hofsteenge 2014; Kong
2014; Luna-Pech 2014; NCT00807560; Nguyen 2012; Pakpour
2015; Patsopoulou 2017; Pbert 2013; Schranz 2014; Sigal 2014)
or objective outcomes only (subjective outcomes not reported)
(Bean 2014; Boodai 2014; Carrel 2005; Debar 2012; Ford 2010;
NCT00132132; Savoye 2007). The risk of performance bias was
unclear in the remaining 24 studies.
The risk of detection bias was low for objective outcomes (re-
gardless of whether outcome assessors were blinded to treatment
allocation) in 44 studies. For subjective outcomes, six studies
blinded outcome assessors (Brennan 2013; Gourlan 2013; Jelalian
2016; Nguyen 2012; Norman 2016; Pakpour 2015), and this
was unclear in 17 studies (Carraway 2014; Christie 2011; Debar
2012; Ebbeling 2003; Ebbeling 2012; Grey 2009; Kong 2013;
NCT00807560; Patrick 2013; Patsopoulou 2017; Saelens 2002;
Toulabi 2012; van Egmond-Frohlich 2006; Visuthranukul 2015;
Vos 2011; Wengle 2011; Wong 2015). The risk of detection bias
was judged to be high in the remaining seven studies reporting sub-
jective ouLena1234tcomes (Daley 2005; Hofsteenge 2014; Kong
2014; Luna-Pech 2014; Pbert 2013; Schranz 2014; Sigal 2014).
Incomplete outcome data
The risk of attrition bias was low in 17 studies (Brennan 2013;
Carraway 2014; Ebbeling 2003; Ebbeling 2012; Gourlan 2013;
Grey 2009; Hofsteenge 2014; Nguyen 2012; Norman 2016;
Patrick 2013; Pbert 2013; Pitetti 2007; Resnicow 2005; Savoye
2007; Sigal 2014; Vos 2011; Walpole 2013). Eleven studies had
a high risk of attrition bias on objective and subjective (where re-
ported) outcome measures due to an imbalance in attrition be-
tween study groups (Carrel 2005; Jelalian 2016; Kong 2013; Kong
2014; Love-Osborne 2014; NCT00132132; NCT00807560;
Saelens 2002; Schranz 2014; van Egmond-Frohlich 2006; Vissers
2008). The remaining 16 studies were at unclear risk of bias due
to insufficient reporting of attrition, such as not providing reasons
for missing data.
Selective reporting
Fourteen studies were at high risk of reporting bias (Boodai 2014;
Brennan 2013; Ebbeling 2003; Ford 2010; Hofsteenge 2014;
Love-Osborne 2014; NCT00807560; Norman 2016; Pbert 2013;
Pitetti 2007; Schranz 2014; Sigal 2014; van Egmond-Frohlich
2006; Vos 2011). In 17 studies, this was unclear, as the study
protocol or trial record were unavailable, or the trial had yet to be
fully published. The remaining 13 studies reported all outcomes
as stated.
Other potential sources of bias
There was high risk of bias in one study as the run-in programme
was conducted to minimise participant attrition, but may have
resulted in a more motivated sample of participants and parents
compared with non-run-in trial cohorts (Norman 2016). There
was an unclear risk of other sources of bias in 10 studies (Bean
2014; Boodai 2014; Brennan 2013; Carraway 2014; Grey 2009;
Kong 2013; NCT00132132; NCT00807560; Pbert 2013; Wong
2015). In one of these studies, the participating churches (which
were the unit of randomisation) requested that the comparison
conditionreceivedameaningful intervention, which mayhave had
an impact on results (Resnicow 2005). The remaining 32 studies
were at low risk of other sources of bias.

Diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obese adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Forty-four trials compared a diet, physical activity, behavioural
intervention or a combination of these with usual care, no ac-
tive intervention or wait list control or a concomitant therapy.
Five studies assessed more than one intervention (Brownell 1983;
Pakpour 2015; Patrick 2013; Patsopoulou 2017; Sigal 2014). In
one three arm trial, Brownell 1983 assessed a multicomponent
intervention with three different approaches; mothers attended
sessions with the adolescents, mothers attended separate sessions
to the adolescent or only the adolescents received the interven-
tion. The study by Pakpour 2015 compared motivational inter-
viewing with a passive control (no details); there were two in-
tervention groups, one with parental involvement and one with-
out. In the study by Patsopoulou 2017, there were two interven-
tion groups compared to no intervention, an activity group and
an activity plus diet group with parental involvement. Sigal 2014
allocated participants to four arms comparing different physical
activity interventions with a diet-only control group. All groups
received the dietary intervention and this was compared to a diet
plus aerobic exercise intervention, a diet plus resistance training
intervention and a diet plus aerobic plus resistance training in-
tervention. The study by Patrick 2013 compared three differ-
ent website interventions (website alone, website and group ses-
sions, website and text messages) with a usual care control. There
were no substantial differences in the study between the inter-
ventions and these were therefore merged into one group as de-
scribed in the Measures of treatment effect section. One study pro-
vided gender stratified analyses (Norman 2016). One study had
two control groups, a usual care control and an exercise placebo
of body conditioning (an attention control) (Daley 2005). As
there was no aim in the study to test the difference between
these two control groups, and the attention control was not in-
tended to promote weight control, we merged these two groups
into one control arm for the purpose of the review. The other
37 trials each assessed different interventions as described above
(Bean 2014; Boodai 2014; Brennan 2013; Carrel 2005; Chandra
1968; Christie 2011; Debar 2012; Ebbeling 2003; Ebbeling 2012;
Ford 2010; Gourlan 2013; Grey 2009; Hofsteenge 2014; Jelalian
2016; Jiang 2005; Kong 2013; Kong 2014; NCT00132132;
NCT00807560; Nguyen 2012; Love-Osborne 2014; Luna-Pech
2014; Norman 2016; Pbert 2013; Pitetti 2007; Resnicow 2005;

2012; van Egmond-Frohlich 2006; Vissers 2008; Visuthranukul
2015; Vos 2011; Walpole 2013; Wengle 2011).
Outcomes are considered here at the longest point of follow-up
for each study. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses around
these outcomes are reported below.
Changes in body mass index or body weight
All but one study (Chandra 1968) reported BMI variables as out-
comes. Twenty-nine studies reported BMI and 20 studies reported
BMI z score. Twenty-eight trials (33 comparisons) reported BMI
change data that were suitable for meta-analysis. Pooling the stud-
ies in a random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated a reduction in
BMI in the intervention groups compared with control groups at
the longest point of follow-up (MD -1.18 kg/m2 (95% CI -1.67
to -0.69); P < 0.00001; 2774 participants; 28 studies; 34 compar-
isons; low quality evidence; Analysis 1.1).
Meta-analysis of BMI z score at the longest point of follow-up
showed a reduction in the intervention groups compared with
the control groups (MD -0.13 units (95% CI -0.21 to -0.05);
P = 0.002; 2399 participants; 20 studies; low quality evidence;
Analysis 1.2).
Five studies did not report BMI or BMI z score outcomes in a for-
mat that was suitable for meta-analysis (Carraway 2014; Christie
2011; Love-Osborne 2014; Walpole 2013; Wong 2015). The
study by Walpole 2013 reported median BMI and BMI z scores
and the study reported no substantial differences between groups.
In the study by Wong 2015, the mean BMI z score did not sub-
stantially differ between groups. Christie 2011 reported the effect
estimate for BMI at six months, which was not substantially dif-
ferent between groups. The study by Love-Osborne 2014 reported
the proportion of participants with increases or decreases in BMI
z scores at different thresholds. The only relevant result was that a
higher proportion of participants in the control group decreased
their BMI z score by at least 0.1 compared with the intervention
group. One study has not currently reported BMI outcomes hav-
ing only recently published secondary outcomes (Bean 2014). The
study by Carraway 2014 did not present BMI data for a mentor-
led exercise programme compared with wait list control.
Five studies reported BMI percentiles (Bean 2014; Brennan 2013;
Debar 2012; Kong 2013; Patrick 2013). Analysis 1.3 shows results
from four studies (Brennan 2013; Debar 2012; NCT00807560;
Patrick 2013). The results favoured the interventions in two stud-
ies. In one study, where three interventions were combined, there
was a reduction in the BMI percentile in the control group (Patrick
2013). Kong 2013 reported the median BMI percentile. This re-
duced in the intervention group and increased in the control group
(P = 0.04). Bean 2014 did not report data.
Twenty studies (24 comparisons) reported weight change and were
pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis which demonstrated a
reduction in weight in the intervention groups compared with
controls at the longest point of follow-up (MD -3.67 kg (95%
CI -5.21 to -2.13); P < 0.00001; 1993 participants; 20 studies;
moderate quality evidence; Analysis 1.4).
Adverse events
Five trials reported rates of adverse events (Ebbeling 2012; Ford
2010; NCT00132132; NCT00807560; Sigal 2014). There were
no adverse events reported in either group in the studies by
Ford 2010; NCT00132132; and NCT00807560. In the study
by Ebbeling 2012, 6.4% of participants experienced an adverse
event in the intervention group (no details); it was not reported
20

 whether adverse events occurred in the comparator group. Sigal
2014 reported the proportions of participants experiencing ad-
verse events, the proportion withdrawing owing to adverse events
and detailed the specific adverse events in each of their four groups
(see Appendix 8 for details). Adverse events were experienced in
25% of participants in the diet plus aerobic exercise group; 19%
in the diet plus resistance training group; 21% in the diet plus
aerobic plus resistance training group and 24% in the diet-only
group.
Secondary outcomes
Anthropometric measures other than body mass index
Twenty-eight trials reported anthropometric measures other than
BMI using objective measures (Boodai 2014; Brownell 1983;
Brennan 2013; Carrel 2005; Ebbeling 2003; Ebbeling 2012; Ford
2010; Grey 2009; Hofsteenge 2014; Kong 2013; Kong 2014;
NCT00132132; NCT00807560; Nguyen 2012; Norman 2016;
Pakpour 2015; Patrick 2013; Patsopoulou 2017; Pbert 2013;
Saelens 2002; Savoye 2007; Schranz 2014; Sigal 2014; Toulabi
2012; Vissers 2008; Vos 2011; Walpole 2013; Wengle 2011).
Fourteen studies reported percentage of body fat change that was
suitable for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis demonstrated a reduc-
tion in percentage of body fat in the intervention group compared
with the control group at the longest follow-up points (MD -
1.08% (95% CI -1.69 to -0.46); P = 0.0006; 1886 participants;
14 studies; Analysis 3.1). Three studies reported other measures of
body fat that included percentage of fat (Carraway 2014; Pakpour
2015), and percentage of body fat-SDS (Ford 2010). All three
studies found a reduction in body fat in the intervention group
compared to the control group (see Table 2 for details).
Twotrialsreporteddataforpercentage of trunkfatthatwassuitable
for meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis showed an MD
of -0.84% ((95% CI -3.10 to 1.43); P = 0.47; 123 participants; 2
trials; Analysis 3.2).
Seventeen trials reported data for waist circumference that was
suitable for meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis demon-
strated a reduction in waist circumference in the intervention
group compared with the control group at the longest follow-up
points (MD -2.26 cm (95% CI -3.80 to -0.72); P = 0.004; 1997
participants; 17 trials; Analysis 3.3). Two studies reported other
measures of abdominal adiposity (Kong 2014; Vos 2011). Per-
centage of visceral fat did not change in either the intervention
or control group (Kong 2013). One study found that both waist
circumference minus SDS and waist-to-height ratio significantly
decreased in the intervention arm compared to the control arm
(Vos 2011) (see Table 2 for details).
Pooling three trials in a random-effects meta-analysis showed no
substantial reduction in waist-to-height ratio in the intervention
group compared to control group at the longest follow-up points
(MD 0 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.02); P = 0.98; 276 participants; 3
trials; Analysis 3.4). Waist-to-hip ratio did not substantially reduce
in the intervention group compared to the control group (MD
0.01 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.03); P = 0.22; 211 participants; 2 trials;
Analysis 3.5). In one study, hip circumference seemed to decrease
in the intervention group compared to the control group (Toulabi
2012; see Table 2).
Five trialsreporteddataforfatmassthatwassuitable formeta-anal-
ysis. Pooling the studies in a random-effects meta-analysis demon-
strated a reduction in fat mass in the intervention group compared
to the control group at the longest follow-up points (MD -3.13
kg (95% CI -4.70 to -1.56); P < 0.0001; 673 participants; 5 trials;
Analysis 3.6). The study by Schranz 2014 found no substantial
difference for the reduction in body mass between the interven-
tion and control groups (see Table 2 for details).
Two trials reported data for trunk fat mass that was suitable for
meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analyses showed no substan-
tial reduction in trunk fat mass in the intervention group com-
pared to the control group (MD -0.94 kg (95% CI -2.49 to 0.61);
P = 0.24; 184 participants; 2 trials; Analysis 3.7).
Three trials reported data for lean mass that was suitable for meta-
analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis showed no substantial in-
crease in body lean mass in the intervention group compared to
the control group (MD -0.21 kg (95% CI -0.88 to 0.47); P =
0.55; 417 participants; 3 trials; Analysis 3.8). The Brennan 2013
trial found that participants in the intervention group had lower
truncal lean mass compared to the control group, however, statis-
tical significance was not reported (see Table 2 for details).
Two trials reported data for percentage of overweight that was
suitable for meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis showed
no substantial difference in the percentage of overweight between
the intervention group and control group (MD -5.55% (95%
CI -13.67 to 2.57); P = 0.18; 73 participants; 2 trials; Analysis
3.9). One study reported percentage of BMI reduction and found
that 75% of participants in the intervention group reduced their
BMI compared to 23% of participants in the control group (
NCT00132132). In one trial, percentage of overweight reduced
in both intervention and control at seven months’ follow-up (
Carraway 2014; see Table 2 for details). In one study, percentage
of boys over the median BMI was lower in the intervention group
compared to boys in the control group (Norman 2016). In an
earlier study, average weight loss was not lower in the intervention
group compared to the control (Chandra 1968; see Table 2).
Health-related quality of life and self-esteem
Thirteen trials reported health-related quality of life and self-es-
teem using validated self-reported tools (Brennan 2013; Carraway
2014; Daley 2005; Debar 2012; Ford 2010; Hofsteenge 2014;
Luna-Pech 2014; Nguyen 2012; Patrick 2013; Pakpour 2015;
Schranz 2014; van Egmond-Frohlich 2006; Vos 2011). Seven tri-
als reported data for health-related quality of life change that was
21

 suitable for meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis demon-
strated an improvement in health-related quality of life in the in-
tervention group compared with the control group at the longest
follow-up points ((SMD 0.44 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.79); P = 0.01;
972 participants; 7 studies; low quality evidence Analysis 4.1).
An SD of 0.44 represents a moderate difference between groups
(Higgins 2011a). The study by Ford 2010 reported narrative find-
ings of health-related quality of life that improved in both the in-
tervention and control arms but did not reach statistical signifi-
cance (see Table 3 for further details).
Six trials reported data for self-esteem change that was suitable
for meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated no
substantial improvement in self-esteem for either group at the
longest follow-up points (SMD 0.09 (95% CI -0.08 to 0.27;
P = 0.30, 613 participants; 6 trials; Analysis 4.3). Four trials
reported other measures of self-esteem and found no substan-
tial improvement in either group for body appearance, weight
satisfaction, body attribution (Hofsteenge 2014), weight effi-
cacy (Pakpour 2015), and physical self-worth (Schranz 2014;
van Egmond-Frohlich 2006). One trial reported improvement in
global self-esteem post intervention and at seven months’ follow-
up for both intervention and control (Carraway 2014) (see Table
3 for further details).
All-cause mortality
None of the studies reported all-cause mortality.
Morbidity
None of the studies reported morbidity.
Behavioural change
Dietary intake
Six trials (454 participants) reported macronutrient and glycaemic
consumption assessed by either food record or 24-hour dietary
recall (Ebbeling 2003; Ebbeling 2012; Kong 2014; Pbert 2013;
Saelens 2002; Visuthranukul 2015). Monitored intakes included
fat, protein, carbohydrates, sugar, fibre, glycaemic load and gly-
caemic index.
Three trials reported fat intake as percentage of total energy intake
for 132 participants (Ebbeling 2003; Pbert 2013; Saelens 2002).
There was no substantial reduction in fat intake in either group
in the studies by Pbert 2013 and Saelens 2002. In the study by
Ebbeling 2003, fat intake significantly decreased in the control
group but increased in the intervention group at 12 months (see
Table 4 for details).
Two trials reported protein intake as percentage of total energy
intake for 75 participants (Ebbeling 2003; Kong 2014). At 12
months, there was no substantial increase in protein intake in the
either group in the study by Ebbeling 2003. In the study by Kong
2014 the intervention group increased protein consumption com-
pared to the control group at six months (see Table 4 for details).
The same trials (Ebbeling 2003; Kong 2014) reported carbohy-
drate intake. There was no substantial change in carbohydrate
consumption in either the intervention or control group at six and
12 months (see Table 4 for details).
Two trials reported total sugar intake for 291 participants (
Ebbeling 2012; Pbert 2013). Participants in the intervention
group reported lower intakes compared to the control group in
both studies (Ebbeling 2012; Pbert 2013). See Table 4 for details.
Two trials reported fibre intake for 75 participants (Ebbeling
2003; Kong 2014). At 12 months, fibre intake did not change
substantially in either the intervention or control group in one
study (Ebbeling 2003). The second study reported an increase
in fibre consumption in the intervention group compared to the
control group (Kong 2014). See Table 4 for details.
Three trials reported glycaemic load intake for 157 participants
(Ebbeling 2003; Kong 2014; Pbert 2013). Glycaemic load de-
creased in the intervention group in two studies (Ebbeling 2003;
Pbert 2013), but there was no substantial difference between the
intervention and control groups in one study (Kong 2014). See
Table 4 for details.
Three trials reported glycaemic index intake for 127 participants
(Ebbeling 2003; Kong 2014; Visuthranukul 2015). Glycaemic in-
dex did not change in either group in the studies by Ebbeling
2003 and Kong 2014. At six months, the intervention group (25
participants) reported a higher consumption of low glycaemic in-
dex foods compared to the control group (27 participants) in one
study (Visuthranukul 2015). See Table 4 for details.
Five trials (650 participants) reported fruit and vegetable intake
(Brennan 2013; Kong 2013; Pakpour 2015; Patrick 2013; Wengle
2011), while two trials (408 participants) reported vegetable in-
take (Brennan 2013; Pakpour 2015). Dietary consumption was
assessed using the Fat, Fruit and Vegetable Diet Questionnaire
(FFVDQ), diet record or dietary questions from the Center for
Disease Control Youth Risk Behavior System (YRBS). In all stud-
ies, except for one (Pakpour 2015), fruit and vegetable consump-
tion did not substantially increase. In the study by Pakpour 2015,
the motivational interviewingandparental involvementgrouphad
a significantly higher intake of fruit servings compared to the con-
trol group. See Table 4 for details.
Four trials (668 participants) reported beverage consumption
(juice, milk and sugar-sweetened drinks) assessed by either di-
etary questions YRBS, 24-hour dietary recall or Food Frequency
Questionnaire (FFQ)(Brennan 2013; Ebbeling 2012; Kong 2013;
Pakpour 2015). Juice and milk consumption did not change sub-
stantially in either the intervention and control group in three tri-
als (Brennan 2013; Ebbeling 2012; Pakpour 2015). Reports on
sugar-sweetened drinks (606 participants) were significantly lower
inthe interventiongroupcomparedtothe control group(Ebbeling

 2012; Kong 2013; Pakpour 2015). See Table 4 for details.
Five trials (742 participants) reported several dietary findings as-
sessed by the FFQ, 24-hour dietary recall or the food record
(Brennan 2013; Ebbeling 2012; Pakpour 2015; Pbert 2013;
Wengle 2011) (see Table 4 for details). The consumption of fatty
food items generally decreased in the intervention group compared
to the control group (Pakpour 2015; Wengle 2011). There was no
substantial difference between the intervention and control groups
in healthier dietary consumption such as increasing salad intake
and reducing added sugar (Brennan 2013; Pbert 2013). However,
whole-grain intake (Wengle 2011) and unsweetened beverage con-
sumption (Ebbeling 2012) were higher in the intervention group
compared to the control group.
Dietary behaviour
Four trials (674 participants) reported changes in dietary be-
haviours assessed by either objective (e.g. Mandometer) or vali-
dated self-reported questionnaires (e.g. FFVDQ) (Brennan 2013;
Ford 2010; Grey 2009; Pakpour 2015). Eating behaviours such as
eating speed and usual food choices did not change substantially
in either group in studies by Grey 2009 and Ford 2010. Dietary
self-efficacy improved in the intervention group (118 participants)
but not in the control group in one study (Pakpour 2015), while
there was no change in either group (198 participants) in another
study (Grey 2009). Dietary behaviour in relation to fat intake did
not improve in either the intervention or control group (Brennan
2013). See Table 5 for details.
Physical activity
Thirteen trials (1376 participants) reported several measures of
physical activity assessed using objective tools (Jelalian 2016; Kong
2013; Pbert 2013; Sigal 2014; Wengle 2011), or validated self-
reported tools (Debar 2012; Ebbeling 2012; Grey 2009; Gourlan
2013; Kong 2014; Pakpour 2015; Saelens 2002; Sigal 2014).
Three trials reported data for mild-to-vigorous physical activ-
ity that was suitable for meta-analysis (Kong 2013; Pbert 2013;
Wengle 2011), while the study by Jelalian 2016 could not be meta-
analysed (Table 6). Random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated
no substantial improvement in mild-to-vigorous physical activity
(MD 0.39 (95% CI -15.07 to 15.85); P = 0.96; 129 participants;
3 trials; Analysis 5.1). Two trials reported data for activity length
(hours per day) that was suitable for meta-analysis (Gourlan 2013;
Pakpour 2015). Random-effectsmeta-analysisshowednosubstan-
tial improvement in activity length (MD -0.11 hours/day (95%
CI -0.98 to 0.75); P = 0.80; 129 participants; 2 trials; Analysis
5.2). Only two trials reported screen time (hours per day) that was
suitable for meta-analysis (Ebbeling 2012; Wengle 2011). Ran-
dom-effects meta-analysis showed a favourable effect for the in-
tervention group compared with the control group at the longest
follow-up points (MD -0.60 hours/day (95% CI -0.65 to -0.55);
P < 0.00001; 241 participants; 2 trials; Analysis 5.3).
Overall, physical activity from validated self-reported measures
did not substantially improve in either the intervention or control
groups for increasing number of steps per day (Sigal 2014; Wengle
2011), amount per day (Debar 2012; Saelens 2002), intensity
(Kong 2013), and metabolic equivalent for self-reported physical
activity (Debar 2012; Ebbeling 2012; Grey 2009; Kong 2014).
See Table 6 for details.
Physical activity behaviour
Three trials (566 participants) reported behavioural change in re-
lation to physical activity assessed by self-reported measures (Grey
2009; Kong 2013; Pakpour 2015), or objective measures (Jelalian
2016). There was no substantial reduction in the hours spent view-
ing television for either the intervention or control groups in one
trial (Kong 2013), while one trial showed a decrease in hours spent
in sedentary behaviour in the intervention arm (Jelalian 2016).
Two studies reported improvement in physical activity self-effi-
cacy in the intervention group at 12 months (Grey 2009; Pakpour
2015). See Table 7 for details.
Participants’ views of the intervention
Eight trials reported participants’ views of the multidisciplinary
intervention (Brennan 2013; Christie 2011; Debar 2012; Jelalian
2016; Nguyen 2012; Pbert 2013; Saelens 2002; Wengle 2011).
Participants reported high levels of satisfaction for the compo-
nents (Jelalian 2016; Nguyen 2012; Saelens2002), services (Debar
2012), and overall quality (Brennan 2013) of multidisciplinary in-
terventions. Similarly, participants were satisfied with the person
delivering the intervention whether it was a nurse (Debar 2012),
mentor (Pbert 2013; Wengle 2011), or clinician (Brennan 2013).
Overall, participants thought that a multidisciplinary weight-re-
lated programme met their needs (Debar 2012), and in terms of
comfort in discussing their behaviour (Pbert 2013), and ability to
focus and deal with their concerns (Brennan 2013), and helped
them to make behavioural changes (Christie 2011; Nguyen 2012).
See Table 8 for details.
Socioeconomic effects
None of the studies reported socioeconomic effects.
Parenting and relationships
Only one trial reported parent-adolescent communication (
Brennan 2013). There was no substantial difference between ado-
lescents in the intervention and control groups for parent-adoles-
cent negative, problematic and supportive communication mea-
sures(see Table 9). However, participantsinthe interventiongroup
reported higher positive communication with parents compared
to the control group (Brennan 2013).

 Subgroup analyses
We performed a number of subgroup analyses to test the effects
of different durations of follow-up, duration of the interventions,
different types of comparators, mode of delivery of the interven-
tion, setting, type of intervention, psychological basis for the in-
terventions and involvement of parents on the outcomes of BMI
and BMI z score.
For duration of follow-up, the studies were divided into three
subgroups, six months’ follow-up, 12 months’ follow-up and 18
months’ follow-up or more. Some studies reported follow-up at
more than one time point and are included in the analyses. There
were no subgroup differences regarding duration of follow-up
(Analysis 2.1; Analysis 6.1; Analysis 6.2). For change in BMI score
(Analysis 2.2), combining studies with a duration of the inter-
vention of six months or less and studies with a duration of the
intervention of greater than six months indicated a statistically
significant subgroup difference (P = 0.02).
Studies were furthermore divided by whether they had a period of
postintervention follow-up (defined as the period after the active
intervention and up to the final measurement) and the duration of
that period: no postintervention follow-up, less than six months,
six months to less than 12 months and postintervention follow-up
lasting 12 months or longer. The duration of no postintervention
follow-up was calculated by subtracting the active intervention
period from the total duration of the study (i.e. intervention and
all follow-up duration). There were no subgroup differences for
BMI (Analysis 7.1). For BMI z score, there was a statistically sig-
nificant subgroup difference (P = 0.007). The effect size for BMI
z score appeared greater in studies with a postintervention follow-
up lasting 12 months or longer (Analysis 7.2).
When outcomes from studies with comparators described as no in-
tervention or wait list control, usual care or a concomitant therapy
were combined, the effect sizes for BMI change appeared larger
for studies with no intervention or wait list control comparators
and for studies with usual care controls (P = 0.008; Analysis 8.1).
Studies were divided into three groups to test the effect of the mode
of delivery of the intervention: group, individual and group plus
individual delivery. There were no subgroup differences (Analysis
9.1; Analysis 9.2).
For setting, the studies were divided into three subgroups, school,
community and healthcare settings. There were no subgroup dif-
ferences (Analysis 10.1; Analysis 10.2).
The majority of studies were multidisciplinary interventions; how-
ever, some studies focused on diet alone or physical activity in-
terventions alone. There were no subgroup differences (Analysis
11.1; Analysis 11.2).
Studies were categorised into four groups according to any theoret-
ical basis for the intervention. These were those applying cognitive
behavioural techniques, those applying motivational interviewing
techniques, those reporting any other psychological technique and
those not reporting any theoretical basis to the intervention or
no psychological component to the intervention (BMI: Analysis
12.1; BMI z score: Analysis 12.2). For BMI change, there was a
subgroup difference (P = 0.09).
A number of studies involved parents in their interventions while
others did not explicitly provide any intervention to parents. There
were no subgroup differences (Analysis 13.1; Analysis 13.2).
We performed subgroups analyses to test the effects of different
tools of self-reported measures and different outcomes reported.
For health-related quality of life, studies were divided into two
subgroups, studies using the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL)
tool and studies using other self-reported tools. There were no
subgroup differences (Analysis 4.4).
Studies measuring self-esteem were divided into two subgroups,
studies measuring total self-esteem and studies measuring global
self-worth. There were no subgroup differences (Analysis 4.4;
Analysis 4.5).
Results of the subgroup analyses should be interpreted with cau-
tion given the large number of variable that we assessed.
Sensitivity analyses
We did not perform sensitivity analysis restricting to published
studies as all included studies were published. We did not per-
form sensitivity analysis restricting studies to type of funding as
there was no industrial funding influence. We performed sensitiv-
ity analyses for the following factors: longest follow-up with 20%
or less attrition; longest follow-up with 30% or less attrition; lan-
guage of publication; study design; removal of one trial specifically
aimed at adolescents with severe autism (Pitetti 2007); removal of
one trial specifically aimed at overweight adolescents with asthma
(Luna-Pech 2014); removal of one trial specifically aimed at over-
weight or obese adolescents with depression (Jelalian 2016); re-
moval of one trial where there was some uncertainty over the du-
ration of follow-up and no response was received to a request for
clarification from the authors (Toulabi 2012), and removal of one
study where SDs were imputed from other studies (Pitetti 2007).
These sensitivity analyses were undertaken on both the BMI and
BMI z score meta-analyses as appropriate to each study.
For the sensitivity analysis testing the effect of attrition, results
did not differ between comparisons for either sensitivity analyses
when compared with the main summary effects for studies with
20% or less attrition at the longest follow-up: BMI (MD -1.34 kg/
m2 (95% CI -2.05 to -0.63); P = 0.0002; 1486 participants; 15
studies; 18 comparisons); BMI z score (MD -0.22 (95% CI -0.39
to -0.05); P = 0.01; 951 participants; 11 studies; 11 comparisons)
and for studies with 30% or less attrition at the longest follow-up:
BMI (MD -1.07 kg/m2 (95% CI -1.62 to -0.51); P = 0.0002; 2135
participants; 20 studies; 25 comparisons); BMI z score (MD -0.18
(95% CI -0.32 to -0.05); P = 0.008; 1066 participants; 13 studies;
13 comparisons). Heterogeneity for these sensitivity analyses did
not vary consistently when compared with the heterogeneity seen
in the main analyses (20% or less attrition:BMI: I2 = 72%; BMI
z score: I2 = 91%; 30% or less attrition: BMI: I2 = 77%; BMI z

 score: I2 = 90%). Therefore, we included all studies regardless of
rates of attrition in the analyses and subgroup.
Sensitivity analyses on the primary analyses for BMI and BMI z
score removing individual trials did not have a considerable impact
on the results and these trials were retained in the analyses. The
removal of the study by van Egmond-Frohlich 2006 (published
in German) slightly increased the BMI z score (MD -0.14 (95%
CI -0.23 to -0.05); P = 0.002; 1878 participants; 19 studies; 21
comparisons), but heterogeneity remained the same (I2 = 86%).
The removal of the studybyPitetti 2007 fromthe BMIanalysisdid
notchange the MDorthe CIs(MD-1.18(95%CI-1.67to -0.69);
P < 0.00001; 2764 participants; 27 studies; 33 comparisons). The
removal of the study by Jelalian 2016 changed BMI MD and CIs
by one second decimal point only (MD -1.17 kg/m2 (95% CI
-1.66 to -0.68); P < 0.00001; 2750 participants; 27 studies; 33
studies). The removal of the study by Toulabi 2012 reduced the
MD in BMI slightly and narrowed the CIs slightly (MD -1.15
kg/m2 (95% CI -1.66 to -0.64); P < 0.0001; 2622 participants;
27 studies; 33 comparisons) but the result remained statistically
significant with heterogeneity of I2 = 78%. Removing the study
by Luna-Pech 2014 from the BMI z score meta-analysis reduced
the MD slightly and narrowed the CIs slightly (MD -0.11 (95%
CI -0.19 to -0.03); P = 0.006; 2348 participants; 19 studies; 21
comparisons) but the result remained statistically significant and
only reduced the heterogeneity slightly to I2 = 83%. One study did
not report measures of variance for the BMI z score (Jiang 2005),
and we imputed the SDs from another study. Removing this study
from the meta-analysis reduced the effect size and reduced the
95% CIs; however, the direction of effect remained the same (MD
-0.08 (95% CI -0.14 to -0.02); P = 0.007; 2331 participants; 19
studies; 21 comparisons) and reduced heterogeneity but remained
considerable (I2 = 70%).
The removal of cluster RCTs where it was unclear if the effect of
clustering had been taken account of in the analysis (Grey 2009;
Pbert 2013) from the BMI analysis increased the MD (MD -1.34
(95% CI -1.80 to -0.89); P < 0.00001; 26 studies; 32 comparisons;
2494 participants) but heterogeneity remained highly significant
(I2 = 71%).
Assessment of reporting bias
We generated a funnel plot for the primary outcome of BMI as
this analysis included the highest number of studies on which to
assess publication bias. Inspection of the funnel plot suggested the
possibility of a small-study bias (Figure 4).

 Ongoing studies
We found50ongoing RCTs(see Characteristics of ongoing studies
table). Forty-four of these RCTs are parallel trials, two are cluster
trials, two are cross-over trials, one is a factorial trial and in one the
design is unclear. Eight trials are three-arm trials and one is a four-
arm trial. The ages of the participants in these trials incorporate
the range of five to 18 years in 43 trials and are not clearly reported
in seven trials. In one trial, the target population is classed as over-
weight according to Cole international cut-offs for child obesity,
in 22 trials the target population are children classed as obese (us-
ing different methods), in 23 trials the population is described as
overweight or obese and in four trials the classification is unclear.
Six trials include a physical activity intervention, four trials include
anutritional intervention, three trialsinclude dietarysupplements,
19 trials include a behavioural intervention and 21 trials include
a multicomponent intervention.
Thirty-four trials compare the intervention to usual care or no
intervention, 12 compare to a concomitant therapy also delivered
in the intervention arm, one trial compares to wait list control,
two trials compare the intervention to placebo and in one trial the
control is not clearly defined.
BMI was the primary outcome (BMI, BMI z score, BMI-SDS,
BMI percentile) in 36 trials and secondary outcome in five tri-
als. Weight change ass the primary outcome in four trials and the
secondary outcome in one trial. Two trials did not state if weight
change was the primary or secondary outcome and body composi-
tion (unclear what parameters) are the secondary outcome in one
trial and other outcome in one trial. The estimated study comple-
tion dates, where reported, range from March 2011 to December
2021.

Summary of main results
This systematic review summarised 44 RCTs examining the effect
of behaviour changing interventions for treating overweight and
obesity in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. We only included trials
with at least a six-month outcome assessment with the aim of
assessing the longer-term effects of these types of interventions.
Interventions and comparators varied between the included trials.
Outcomes assessed also varied between groups; although all trials
reported a measure of body weight, the most commonly reported
measures were BMI and BMI z score. To allow comparisons across
trials, we analysed outcome data at the longest follow-up period.
Many trials did not report adequate information to assess the risk
of bias and 27 trials were at high risk of bias on at least one domain.
Overall, behaviour changing interventions were more successful
than the comparators in reducing BMI (low quality evidence),
BMI z score (low quality evidence) and weight (moderate quality
evidence) in overweight and or obese adolescents. The effects of
behaviour changing interventions were maintained at 18 to 24
months’ follow-up for both BMI and BMI z score.
There were subgroup differences showing larger effects for both
BMI and BMI z score where comparison groups were described as
no intervention/wait list control or usual care compared to those
testing concomitant interventions delivered to both the interven-
tion and control group (P = 0.008). There were no subgroup dif-
ferences between interventions with and without parental involve-
ment or by intervention type or setting (health care, community,
school) or mode of delivery (individual versus group).
Adverse events were reported in only five trials (low quality evi-
dence). Minor adverse events occurred in one four-arm study, but
there were no details in the others.
Secondary outcomes were reported less consistently across trials.
Overall, behaviour changing interventions were more successful
than the comparators in reducing percentage of body fat, waist
circumference and total fat mass. Fewer trials measured quality of
life and self-esteem. Behaviour changing interventions improved
qualityof life atthe longestfollow-upperiod(lowqualityevidence)
but not self-esteem.
Overall, trials measuring physical activity showed no improvement
for objective and self-reported activity although evidence was lim-
ited. However, two trials reported improvement in physical activ-
ity self-efficacy at 12 months. Dietary intakes were inconsistently
measured and reported across trials, and trials used different tools
to assess dietary intake and reported outcomes using different units
of measure. The majority of trials reported no substantial effect
of behaviour changing interventions on dietary intake although
again evidence was limited.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
This review identified 44 completed trials and 50 ongoing trials
assessing the effect of diet, physical activity and behavioural in-
terventions at six months or longer. The review included studies
conducted in the US, Europe, Asia and the Middle East including
participants of different ethnicity. Most trials included both gen-
ders except for two trials that were restricted to females and one
trial was restricted to males. Over half of the trials followed the
percentile range to diagnose overweight or obesity. The majority
of interventions had a multidisciplinary approach which included
26

 a combination of behavioural, dietary and physical activity com-
ponents. Most trials reported details of the intervention that were
mainly carried out for six months or less. The theoretical approach
behind the intervention varied across studies with five studies us-
ing only the cognitive behavioural approach and four studies using
only motivational interviewing. The majority of studies used ei-
ther a mixture or other psychological theories (e.g. social cognitive
theory, social learning theory, theory of planned behaviour) or did
not have a theoretical approach behind the intervention. Only five
trials used a mixed delivery approach (both individual and group
mode) while the majority used either an individual or group de-
livery mode of the intervention. Studies were mainly conducted
in healthcare settings while fewer trials were conducted in schools.
All 44 trials reported measures of body weight but BMI and BMI z
score were the commonly assessed outcomes. Adverse events were
only reported in five trials and only one trial provided sufficient
details of adverse events. Reports on quality of life, self-esteem,
diet, physical activity, views of the intervention, and parenting
and relationships were less consistent across trials. There was het-
erogeneity in measurement tools, assessed outcomes and unit of
outcome measures. The duration of follow-up varied across trials
with most trials reporting outcomes at six to nine months and
fewer trials reporting outcomes at two years. Overall, behaviour
changing interventions have a favourable effect on measures of
body weight including BMI, BMI z score and weight change in
adolescents. We found no results for our outcomes of morbidity,
mortality or socioeconomic effects of intervention.
Quality of the evidence
We rated the quality of evidence for the outcomes of interest in
this review as low with the exception of weight which was moder-
ate (Summary of findings for the main comparison). We judged
the risk of bias for many individual studies to be unclear or high
for a number of domains, but we found the impact of bias on
the results for BMI and weight outcomes to be limited due to the
influence of low risk of bias studies in the analysis. For some out-
comes where studies had high loss to follow-up, we saw a bigger
effect size in sensitivity analyses. Anthropometric measures (BMI,
BMI z score, weight) were downgraded for inconsistency (some
variation in point estimates, poor overlap of CIs, significant statis-
tical heterogeneity). Both BMI outcomes were downgraded fur-
ther for indirectness due to the surrogacy of outcome measures
(BMI and BMI z score). We maintained our decision to down-
grade BMI outcomes for inconsistency even though we had some
evidence that variation in effect could be explained by use of active
controls in some studies. Within subgroup analysis heterogeneity
remained high, indicating that there may be factors in addition to
type of control intervention which give a credible explanation for
inconsistency of effects across these outcomes.
Adverse events were downgraded due to risk of bias (inconsistency
in reporting of data, reporting bias and attrition bias). Health-re-
lated quality of life was downgraded for risk of bias (lack of blind-
ing of outcome assessors) and inconsistency (variability in point
estimates, overlap in CI and significant statistical heterogeneity).
Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution.
Potential biases in the review process
We included four cluster randomised trials in this review but did
not adjusted the data to account for the unit of randomisation
due to their limited influence on the review findings. While our
approach risks introducing a unit of analysis error, the impact of
this decision was questionable for the outcomes affected. Most
information in our review came from studies which randomised
participants rather than clusters. Sensitivity analyses restricted to
individually randomised trials provided some indirect evidence
that supported our approach. Given that the removal of cluster
trials did not change the results, calculating effective sample sizes
would reduce their weight in the analysis. Therefore, it is unlikely
that the nature of the results would alter with less weight accorded
to the cluster trials.
The large number of subgroup analyses in our review carries in-
herent risks of multiplicity and the statistically significant results
for subgroup analyses we have found could simply reflect a chance
finding. This should be borne in mind when considering the ap-
plicability of the results to decision-making. We conducted sev-
eral other sensitivity analyses and found no significant differences.
Where data of relevance were missing, either to allow assessment of
eligibility, or at the data extraction stage and assessment of bias, we
contacted the study authors for further information. Twelve trials
are awaiting classification as information is currently unavailable
to the review.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The UK National Institute forHealth andCare Excellence (NICE)
guidance emphasisesthe importance of behaviourchangingweight
management services in the treatment of overweight and obesity
in young people under the age of 18 years (NICE 2013). How-
ever, the guidelines show that there is inconsistent evidence on
the long-term effect of such interventions. The short-term effect
of behaviour changing interventions on weight loss has been re-
ported in a previous review (Wilfley 2007). Our results add to the
evidence base and demonstrate that in trials with longer follow-
up at 18 to 24 months, weight loss is maintained. Group-based
interventions have been recommended by NICE and our review is
consistent in that there were no differences between group-based
and individually delivered interventions.
Overall the findings of our review are consistent with previous
systematic reviews examining the effect of behaviour changing in-
terventions for the treatment of childhood obesity (Kelly 2008;
27
Diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obese adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Ruotsalainen 2015; Whitlock 2010). Several reviews have ques-
tioned the optimal length of behaviour changing interventions
(Ho 2012; Kelly 2008; Wilfley 2007), we found that both short-
term interventions (less than six months) and long-term interven-
tions (greater than six months) have a favourable effect on BMI,
although in subgroup analyses longer interventions seemed to pro-
duce a greater effect on BMI. We found inconsistent evidence on
the effect of behaviour changing interventions on dietary intake as
reported by one previous systematic review (Collins 2006). One
previous review reported the beneficial effect of physical activity
on quality of life (Penedo 2005), we found similar favourable effect
of behaviour changing interventions on quality of life but not self-
esteem. The current review synthesises the most up-to-date and
highest-quality research available on the effectiveness of different
types of behaviour changing interventions for treating overweight
or obesity in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years on a large range of
outcomes. Future updates will incorporate the large number of
ongoing trials which may strengthen this evidence base.

Implications for practice
We explored the impact of different types of behaviour chang-
ing interventions on adolescents being overweight and obese.
Overall, there is low-to-moderate quality evidence that behaviour
changing interventions reduce measures of body weight including
BMI, BMI z score and weight change in adolescents. Additionally,
lifestyle interventions seem to reduce indicators of adiposity such
as percentage of body fat, waist circumference and total fat mass.
There is low quality evidence that behaviour changing interven-
tions have a moderate effect on health-related quality of life. There
is inconclusive evidence on the effects of behaviour changing in-
terventions on self-esteem, dietary intake and physical activity in
adolescents. Most of the evidence is from multicomponent inter-
ventions which include a combination of behavioural, dietary and
physical activity interventions. We found no subgroup differences
for type of intervention, behavioural approach, mode of delivery
or setting. Similar levels of weight reduction are seen in trials with
longer follow-up periods of up to two years suggesting that weight
loss is maintained in these studies. However, the results of this
review should be interpreted with caution as most of the evidence
was rated as low quality due to inconsistency, indirectness or risk
of bias for many of the outcomes measured. The risk of adverse
events could not be assessed reliably as they were not measured by
most of the trials.
Implications for research
This systematic review identified 50 ongoing trials of behaviour
changing interventions targeting adolescent overweight and obe-
sity and incorporation of the results of these when they become
available may strengthen the evidence base. Further research is re-
quired to determine whether the interventions have any adverse ef-
fects. Economic data are needed and trials reporting the costs of be-
haviour changing interventions should be measured and reported.
Consistent measures of health-related quality of life, self-esteem,
dietary and physical activity outcomes using validated tools should
be used in future research and reports should provide adequate
and transparent methodological details such as allocation conceal-
ment, blinding, attrition, selective reporting and validity of tools.
Higher quality trials are required as the current evidence is of low
methodological quality.

Methods
Parallel RCT, randomisation ratio: 1:1, superiority design
Participants
Inclusion criteria: aged 11-18 years; BMI ≥ 85th percentile for age and gender (CDC
2000); parent willing to participate; an identified primary care physician; no underlying
medical condition which would preclude weight loss through behavioural intervention
Exclusion criteria: -
Diagnostic criteria: as above
Interventions
Number of study centres: one
Treatment before study: all participants had been enrolled in the TEENS RCT. Parents
attended biweekly groups. Participants met on alternating weeks with a dietitian and
behavioural support specialist for 6 months. Supervised physical activity at least 3 times
per week
Description of interventions
MI Values : 3 main components of TEENS family-based intervention are physical
activity, dietary intervention and behaviour support. MI Values targets adolescents alone
to enhance autonomy for change. 2 × 30-minute sessions at weeks 1 and 10. Trained
interventionists were independent of TEENS. Participants selected target behaviours
and included TEENS participation, diet, exercise or a combination. Session 1 included a
values clarification exercise, session 2, explored progress in TEENS, re-examined value/
behaviour congruency and elicited participant ideas for change
Education control : 30-minute videos focused on healthy eating and exercise for ado-
lescents at weeks 1 and 10. Participants complete a knowledge quiz to ensure treatment
adherence
All participants proceeded with TEENS multidisciplinary obesity treatment programme
as usual

Interventions
Number of study centres: one
Treatment before study: none
Description of interventions
Low-intensity group programme : 6 sessions of 1 hour. Delivered by a physician with
specialist training in nutrition and a dietitian. Programme adapted from the Scottish
ChildhoodObesityTreatmentTrial. Treatmentmaterialswere provided. Sessionsfocused
on changing behaviours such as reduction in sedentary behaviour (screen-media use);
diet (used a modified ’traffic light diet’ reference given); promotion of physical activity
Theoretically based on behaviour change techniques to all 3 of the targeted behaviours
(including self-monitoring of sedentary behaviour; identifying the main barriers to be-
haviour change; problem solving; goal setting; relapse prevention). Ideally at least 1 par-
ent should have been present
The intervention group split into boys (n = 21) and girls (n = 20) in accordance with
cultural norms of Kuwait. Sessions were delivered on 2 consecutive days
Control : informed that they were obese and advised to attend primary care

Quote from publication: “to test the hypothesis that a ’good practice’ intervention for
the treatment of adolescent obesity in Kuwait would have a greater effect on primary
and secondary outcomes than allocation to a control group. The secondary aims were to
test the feasibility of conducting such a trial in Kuwait and to test the feasibility of using
a good practice intervention and referral to primary care as a control condition.”

Interventions
Number of study centres: 2
Treatment before study: none
Description of interventions
M : individual sessions aimed at improving body composition, cardiovascular fitness, im-
prove eating habits, physical activity habits and promote positive psychosocial function-
ing by moving participants closer to the Australian recommendations. The programme
aimed to instigate small maintainable improvements. Theoretical basis
Sessions included a review of the previous session, discussion of homework, goal achieve-
ment and monitoring; discussion, questions and practice of strategies; setting of exer-
cises for the session and assisted with setting goals; summary of the session material and
setting of home practice tasks. Adolescents were then given the choice of attending the
remaining sessions alone, or with the support of a parent. 12 sessions over 4-6 months
(psycho-education; eating behaviour; physical activity; healthy food choices; exercise;
behaviour charts and barriers; recognising thoughts and emotions; helpful thoughts and
emotions; assertive communication; problem solving and planning; staying on track;
maintenance and closure). Between session 11 and 12 had a telephone call, maintaining
change. Weekly sessions for the first 10 weeks
Parents and adolescents received a programme workbook. Between sessions, adolescents
were encouraged to monitor their behaviour change goals and record their eating and
physical activity habits. The physical activity component aimed to promote physical
activity habits consistent with guidelines recommending at least 60 minutes of mod-
erate-to-vigorous physical activity per day and no more than 2 hours per day in non-
educational screen activities. Rather than specifying goals in terms of specific caloric
intake or expenditure targets, aimed to move participants closer to recommendations
for eating such as consumption of a variety of foods from each of the 5 food groups
(cereals, vegetables, fruit, diary, and meat products and alternatives), the selection of low-
fat alternatives, and the consumption of water
Parental support: provided with written session materials for sessions 7 (strengthening
parent adolescent relationship), 8 (encouraging appropriate behaviour) and 9 (discour-
aging inappropriate behaviour)
Maintenance phase:while the control groupgiventhe interventiontelephone call sessions
were completed every second week and a face-to-face session at 3 months which was
followed by monthly telephone call session and a final face-to-face session conducted at
6 months
Researcher received training in MI
Control : wait list control - offered the intervention after 6 months (postintervention)
Outcomes
Outcomes reported in abstract of publication: weight control behaviour, impulse
regulation, social support from family and parent-adolescent problem communication,
treatment acceptability, body composition (body fat, % body fat, lean mass) and anthro-
pometric measures (weight, BMI, BMI-for-age z score and percentiles), cardiovascular
fitness

Stated aim for study
Quote from publication: “the purpose of the current pilot study was to assess whether
adding a group-based component to increase problem-solving skills, communication
skills, parental social support, and problem-focused coping with teasing as a part of a
mentor-led exercise intervention (MENTOR+CBT) would decrease social avoidance,
improve social support, and increase perceived competence for physical activity as well
as physical activity level in obese adolescents beyond the effects of mentor-led exercise
alone (MENTOR only).”
Notes
Relevant for this review is MENTOR only vs wait list control. The second cohort
examining MENTOR + CBT are not randomised. Contacted author (17 January 2017)

and less time standing in line. The curriculum was personalised to match the student’s
skill levels and encourage student participation. Competitive games were de-emphasised,
and behaviour changing focused activities (walking, cycling and snowshoeing) were
encouraged. A consistent warm-up plan brought students into movement participation
as quickly as possible soon after they entered the gym. Typical movement time was 42
minutes of a 45-minute class period, as children did not change clothes for this class to
increase activity time. Skills were taught with the class broken down into groups of 2 for
promoting more movement and less time watching. The ethos of the class encouraged
physical fitness, less self-conscious focus on appearance and full group participation.
Training for instructors not stated
Standard gym classes : movement time averaged 25 minutes of the 45-minute period.
Participatedinthe traditional physical educationclasses of 35-40 students. The same class
topics (e.g. football, mile run/walk, kickball) were taught as in the intervention group,
but in a different format, as typical issues in the traditional class were a greater range of
skill levels, longer lines during skill development drills and larger numbers of students
on teams when games were played. These issues tended to result in less movement and
a tendency for students to hold back and not enter into play
For both groups: 36-week (9-month) intervention, 90 sessions. The frequency of classes
was 5 times every 2 weeks for a 45-minute class period. All received a small nutrition
education component. This consisted of educational handouts to participants to develop
healthier eating habits. The nutrition portion focuses on the Food Guide Pyramid,
recommended servings of food, appropriate portion sizes, healthier food choices

Diagnostic criteria: as above
Interventions
Number of study centres: 1
Treatment before study: none
Description of interventions
Exercise counselling : knowledge and psychological skills and tools to sustain changes in
their exercise behaviour (Transtheoretical Model) to promote positive exercise attitudes
and experiences. 8 weeks, hourly sessions (1-4: focus on cognitive-based intervention
strategies such as cognitive reappraisal and consciousness raising; 5-8, more behavioural-
based interventions were introduced, e.g. goal setting, self-monitoring and finding social
support). Participants followed a broad structured curriculum of topics over the course
of the intervention (provided in the protocol)
Encouraged participants to discuss their thoughts and feelings about exercise, to assist
with problem-solving. Weight loss per se was not an intervention goal and no weight loss
targets were set, although sensible eating habits were encouraged as part of the exercise
therapy intervention
Offered a range of aerobic exercise modalities, such as stepping, cycling, seated rowing,
dance mat and walking, and asked to exercise intermittently for 30 minutes (4-minute

Primary care-based multicomponent behaviour changing intervention : 90-minute
group sessions over 5 months. Addressed issues associated with obesity in adolescent girls
(e.g. depression, disordered eating patterns, poor body image). Session included review-
ing goals and problem solving to overcome barriers and challenges to increased activity,
discussion of topics particularly pertinent to adolescent girls and specific behavioural and
cognitive tools for coping, including: self-monitoring of dietary intake, physical activity
and screen time; stimulus control and environmental changes, stepwise goal-setting and
problem solving; setting goals for increasing pleasant activities; cognitive restructuring
techniques to combat negative self-talk. Groups met 16 times, weekly for 3 months and
biweekly during months 4 and 5
Increasing physical activity was promoted by using tailored forms of exercise (e.g. ex-
ergaming), goals included 30-60 minutes of physical activity at least 5
days per week; 15 minutes of daily yoga (provided with training in safe and basic yoga
practices, equipment, an instructional booklet and CD), limiting screen time to 2 hours
per day; and increasing “found exercise” opportunities whenever possible. Core activ-
ities chosen to overcome obstacles such as embarrassment. Participants provided with
exergaming equipment (details provided). Also, strategies for increasing physical activity
(e.g. pedometers, resistance bands) promoted
Dietary intake and eating patterns followed caloric guidelines (1600- 1800 kcal daily)
, and 3 main areas for dietary change emphasised: decreasing portion sizes, limiting
consumption of energy dense foods and increasing consumption of lower energy-dense
foods. Other dietary strategies also covered
Parents had 12 separate weekly group sessions in the first 3 months. Nutritional and
physical activity principles the teens would learn discussed, encouraged to increase or
maintain the frequency of family meals
Paediatric providers received study-sponsored training in motivational enhancement
techniques for health behaviour change. Interventionist included Master’s level nutri-
tionists and health educators and Doctoral level clinical psychologists, nutritional and
physical activity principals
Usual care control : participants met with their paediatric primary care providers to
encourage healthybehaviour changing changes. Received a packet of materials, including
outlines of evidence-based approaches to weight management for youths and adults,
a parents’ guide to help adolescents make healthy lifestyle changes, local resources for
weight management and healthy activity, and suggested books and online materials on
healthy lifestyle change

Interventions
Number of study centres: 1
Treatment before study: none
Description of interventions
Both groups received similar behavioural therapy: social cognitive theory provided a
conceptual framework for the educational and behavioural components of treatment
that was consistent between intervention groups. Counselling focused on enhancing
self-efficacy for dietary change using the concepts of behavioural capability (knowledge
and skill) and self-control. Participant expectations (anticipated outcomes), expectancies
(valuesascribedtooutcomes)andperceptionsof environmental influenceswere discussed
during treatment sessions
The topic modules were the primary mechanism for facilitating self-assessment, goal
setting and problem solving. These modules were designed to promote dialogue between
the participant and study dietician. 1 topic module was devoted to physical activity, with
participants in both groups receiving information based on current recommendations
12 sessions over 6 months (12 dietary counselling sessions) and a 6-month follow-up (2
dietary counselling sessions)
Reduced GL diet : written materials included topic modules, food choice lists and a
select-a-meal menu. The topic modules were the primary mechanism for presenting
nutrition intervention messages. These modules were designed to promote dialogue
between the participant and study dietician. Food choice lists were used to enhance
practical application of intervention messages presented in the topic modules. For the
intervention group, lists corresponded to food groups delineated by a reduced GL food
pyramid
The select-a-meal menu contained recipes and ideas for meal planning to complement
the food choice lists. Nutrition bars were offered to participants in the experimental
(Balance Bar; provided by Kraft Foods, Inc, Northfield, IL)
Reduced fat diet, described as a conventional diet : written materials included topic
modules, food choice lists and a select-a-meal menu. The topic modules were the primary
mechanism for presenting nutrition intervention messages. These modules were designed
to promote dialogue between the participant and study dietician. Food choice lists were
used to enhance practical application of intervention messages presented in the topic
modules. For the conventional group, the lists corresponded to the diabetes food pyramid
and were presented as an exchange system. Nutrition bars were offered to conventional
groups (Nature Valley Granola Bar; General Mills, Inc, Minneapolis, MN) for occasional
use as snacks
The interventionist was a dietician trained in the study protocol

Interventions
Number of study centres: -
Treatment before study: none
Description of interventions
Multicomponent intervention : designed to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened
beverages. Emphasis on displacing sugar-sweetened beverages with non-caloric beverages
in the home as a strategy to decrease consumption
Home delivery of non-caloric beverages (e.g. bottled water and ’diet’ beverages) every
2 weeks. Written intervention messages with instructions to drink the delivered bev-
erages and not to buy or drink sugar-sweetened beverages were mailed to participants.
Unsweetened water was recommended over artificially sweetened beverages
Discussions during telephone calls and check-in visits focused exclusively on beverage
consumption, with no attention to other dietary behaviours or to physical activity
3check-invisitswith participants(20minutespervisit). Monthlymotivational telephone
calls with parents (30 minutes per call). Home delivery of non-caloric beverages (e.g.
bottled water and ’diet’ beverages) every 2 weeks
At 6 months (pilot study), each participant received a USD100 gift certificate to a local
shopping mall at the end of the study. Control group received weekly home deliveries
of non-caloric beverages for 4 weeks after completion of follow-up measurements. At 1
year, control group received USD50 supermarket gift cards at 4 and 8 months but did
not receive instructions on what to purchase with the cards
Groups were led by dieticians, Master’s level therapists, psychologists or psychiatrists.

Description of interventions
Mandometer group : computerised device providing real-time feedback during meals
to slow down speed of eating and reduce total intake. Saw a research nurse trained
in use of Mandometer once per week for 6 weeks, every second week for a further
6 weeks, and once every 6th week thereafter. Research nurse telephoned support and
encouragement every second week from week 12 onwards. Participants were trained in
the use of Mandometer including test meals, setting of training lines and eating speed.
Dietary advice by a paediatric dietitian 4 times over 12 months based on the UK Food
Standards Agency ’eatwell plate’ educational tool. Clinician met the participants every
4 months, emphasising the need to change eating habits and improve physical activity
as advocated in the standard clinic
Standard care controls : initial 1-hour discussion about reasons for, and implications
of, obesity and behaviour changing measures that may improve BMI
Multidisciplinary team composed of a clinician, paediatric dietitian and exercise special-
ist. Emphasis placed on implementing changes to increase levels of enjoyable physical
activity to national recommended levels (60 minutes of exercise per day) alongside a
balanced diet, based on the ’eatwell plate.’ Set their own dietary goals and targets, with
practical advice and guidance from the dietician, facilitation to exercise rather than pre-
scription. MI techniques used to engage participants and families in the decision-making
process for changes in behaviour. Appointments at 3-monthly intervals

Description of interventions
MI + standard weight loss : MI-based intervention and self-determination theory to
elicit and reinforce the adolescent’s change talk to minimise resistance and resolve am-
bivalence to change (reference provided). 2 face-to-face, semi-structured interviews for
30 minutes over 3 months where 4 MI principles (making the participant’s acquain-
tance and building awareness, alternatives and problem solving, goal setting and agenda
setting, behaviour modification consequences and perspectives) were used to encourage
adolescents to articulate their concerns and goals, and develop their autonomy
6 × 20-minute telephone sessions over 6 months.
Standard weight loss programme aimed to promote physical activity, provide information
and tips to encourage/help with physical activity and the benefits of performing physical
activity, promote a balance diet and provide information/tips/self-monitoring on how
to achieve healthy behaviour
A sport and exercise sciences Doctoral student delivered MI sessions following MI train-
ing including 40 hours of reading and 32 hours of training formation

Description of interventions
CST : nutrition and exercise educational content enhanced by the inclusion of CST,
based on Bandura’s social learning theory). To increase students’ sense of competence
and mastery, open discussion and questions and answers about events occurring in the
past week with which the youth had difficulty, youth role-playing common situations,
practicing new coping skills. Encouragement and reinforcement provided by other stu-
dents and teacher. Materials developed by a clinical psychologist who was an expert in
CST
13 sessions over 16 weeks. No mention of length of sessions: 8 nutrition and activity
classes + 5 coping skill training (Getting to know you; Change in actions; Get up and
move; Stress identification and reduction; Aim for life skills; Healthy lifestyle tic-tac-toe;
Resolving conflict and effective communication; What’s on your plate?; Size up your
portions; What’s in a food label?; Eating in a fast food world; How to “go out” without
guilt; Recipe makeover)
Physical activity component focused on reducing leisure time sedentary behaviours that
may compete with activity, learned creative ways to increase physical activity in a non-
structured exercise programme, including culturally relevant approaches, such as aerobic
dancing
Materials developed by a registered dietitian. A non-diet, family centred approach used
as nutrition education component. Major dietary goal was to provide highest nutritional
quality for lowest caloric intake. Emphasis placed on lowering dietary fat intake to <
30%, improving food and drink choices, and decreasing total calories by focusing on
appropriate portion sizes, while including culturally specific foods and being sensitive to
the costs of foods

Description of interventions
Family-based behavioural treatment : 104 weeks (2 years). Unclear how many sessions.
Focused on dietary behaviour modification, 1 or 2 main behaviours which were related
to obesity were chosen for each child based on an assessment of relevant dietary and
exercise patterns at baseline. Then a new goal behaviour and interval behaviours were
defined. Each goal and interval behaviour was discussed with the child and the parents
and was agreed to by the child. A diary was kept by the children on their behaviour to
monitor adherence to the recommended lifestyle changes. The parents monitored the
diary and their child’s progress in achieving the new behaviours
Paediatricians (researchers) visited the families once per month to observe the family
environment, look for where foods were stored, cooking styles and what types of foods
were used commonly in the family. The behavioural diary was checked and gaps in the
recordings were discussed. Potential methods of reinforcement and penalty were also
discussed with the parents and children during home visits. A ’traffic light’ food item list
was provided to help decrease energy intake and promote a balanced diet: ’red light’ foods

were those high in fat or calories; ’green light’ foods were low in fat and calories; and
’yellow light’ foods were intermediate. Children encouraged to eat fewer red light foods
and more green light foods and parents encouraged to buy more green light foods instead
of red light foods. Daily calorie requirements, based on the Chinese recommended daily
allowance, were discussed and Chinese food composition tables given to each family.
Dietary behaviours were suggested to the family, including eating slowly, having soup
before meals, eating green light foods first, brushing teeth immediately after each meal
and having meals without staple foods for supper
Exercise for 20-30 minutes per day for 4 days per week (3 weekdays and 1 day on
weekends) was advised. Children were asked to choose from running, playing football,
climbing stairs and using a skipping rope. Children also urged to decrease sedentary
time, e.g. watching television, and to go for a walk after supper instead
Control : normal school and family life and did not receive any special intervention,
the school had a similar curriculum, including physical education, as most other middle
schools in Beijing

Description of interventions
ACTION : based on the Transtheoretical Model, 3 primary components:
• clinical encounters with the school-based health centres clinician every 2-3 weeks
for a total of 8 visits over 1 academic year. First visit dedicated to reviewing pertinent
personal and family history, physical examination and laboratory findings, and
assessment of dietary and physical activity behaviour;
• use of MI;
• obesity risk reduction strategies from a toolkit that was co-created with a
community advisory group made of overweight and obese adolescents and their
parents. The toolkit included a DVD and print materials to provide a ’menu of
options’ during clinical encounters - general content of clinician toolkit used as a
’menu of options’ during clinical encounters with participants. DVD sections:
adolescent motivation for change, strategies targeting energy balance and nutritional
quality, physical aerobic dance and strength training, print materials: weight loss
guidelines for clinicians, MI for clinicians, newsletter for carers, clinic displays,
adolescent session tools.
At the first visit, participants received the DVD, a DVD player and a summary of medical
results, along with American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) obesity prevention/treatment
recommendations
Feedback was provided to the adolescent. Participants were asked to review the DVD and
to follow-up in 2-3 weeks with topics they would like to discuss. Subsequent visits were

individually tailored to the adolescent’s stage of change with the intention of moving
towards goal setting for healthier eating and physical activity. Also had a newsletter for
carers (obesity risk reduction strategies) and after each visit, telephone updates were given
to the carer using MI techniques
The intervention provider received a 2-day training workshop in MI
Standard care : trained clinician with trial protocol. Received 1 clinic visit similar in
content to the first visit of the intervention group given at baseline, except not given the
DVD or DVD player. Published recommendations were provided

Description of interventions
Low GI diet : counselled by dietitian at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 and at 8-week intervals,
total 7 × 30-minute sessions. Parents encouraged to participate. Strategy of increasing
energy expenditure and reducing caloric intake using lifestyle behavioural change. Indi-
vidualised menu plan with 20% caloric restriction based on his/her current diet. Practical
tips were given based on behavioural principles including goal setting, knowledge ac-
quisition, problem solving, feedback and reinforcement. Consumption of low GI food,
use of healthy fat and avoidance of high GI food based on the low GI pyramid empha-
sised. Targeted proportion of energy from carbohydrate and fat: 45-50% and 30-35%,
remainder from protein. 2 booklets were provided, 1 with food portion size exchange
and tips, the other listing low GI foods and meal plans. Encouraged to perform aerobic
exercise ≥ 3 days of 30 minutes per week. Ongoing support and encouragement was
provided, target goals were redefined based on the participant’s feelings and progress,

efforts and achievements were acknowledged to enhance self-efficacy
Motivational telephone calls (10-15 minutes) were made 5 times
Control : conventional Chinese diet, based on the standard food pyramid promoted by
Hong Kong Department of Health with advice on daily proportion of carbohydrate, fat
and protein without information about low GI diet. Emphasis on reducing energy intake
by limiting dietary fat intake and high caloric foods. Targeted proportion of energy from
carbohydrate and fat: 55-60% and 25-30%, remainder from protein. The conventional
Chinese diet was presumed to be a high GI diet (≥ 70). Received counselling from a
research nurse
The contact times, both individual counselling and telephone reinforcement, and the
dietary assessment methods were the same in each group

modelling of healthy lifestyle changes for the family unit. Booklets used for adolescents
and parents/carers during the sessions
• Phase 2: extended therapeutic contact (adolescents only). Main educational
content of sessions was generally new (e.g. healthy take-away food options; eating out)
but key messages from phase 1 were reinforced. Also sessions promoted physical
activity skills development through approximately 20 minutes/session of indoor
resistance activities and fun active indoor games. Group facilitators (and outcome
assessors) received standardised training. A facilitators’ manual was used. Facilitated by
dietitians and could be run by nurses or other healthcare professionals. 14 sessions:
Phase 1: 7 × 75-minute sessions; Phase 2: 5 × 60-minute sessions and 2 outcomes
assessment sessions
Intervention 2 : same interventions as above with additional therapeutic contact of 14
telephone coaching sessions +32 SMS/e-mail messages aimed to enhance adolescents’
knowledge, skills and confidence to initiate and maintain required changes in dietary
and activity behaviours. If there was a parking fee when attending to the community
health centres participants were reimbursed

Diagnostic criteria: as above
Interventions
Number of study centres: not clear
Treatment before study: none
Description of interventions
Stepped-down care: basedonacombinationof ChronicCare Model andsocial cognitive
theory. Chronic Care Model provided a conceptual framework for the healthcare delivery
for adolescents with obesity of chronic illness management in a primary care setting.
Chronic Care Model emphasises interdisciplinary team input. Within the Chronic Care
Model framework, social cognitive theory constructs of behaviour self-management were
applied and included: building self-efficacy, goal setting, feedback, identifying barriers
and social support. The intervention followed modified recommendations from the
American Academy of Pediatrics for treatment of childhood obesity and consisted of 3
× 4-month steps. The goal was for adolescents to lose at least 4 lb every 4 months. If the
participant did not meet the goal, then the step was repeated. If a 4-lb weight loss was
achieved, the participant was ’stepped-down’ to the next level of reduced intensity. The
number and frequency of treatment elements varied for each intervention step. At the
start, the physician provided brief counselling on healthy behaviours. If progress was not
made, then follow-up occurred and focused on weight management strategies. Face-to-
face health educator visits occurred monthly in step 1 and bi-monthly in step 2 and were
available to the child and parent, but the parent was not required to attend. Biweekly
telephone calls were used to review progress and help adolescents set new goals and
discuss barriers and solutions, and speak to parent to reinforce parental involvement and
emphasise importance of healthy changes in the home environment to encourage goal
attainment. Diet and physical activity education materials were distributed to adolescents
and their parents at each visit. Pedometers were distributed at the initial health educator
visit to monitor physical activity and help participants set appropriate physical activity
goals
Enhanced usual care : received an initial counselling session, 1 health education visit,
materials on how to improve weight-related behaviours, monthly follow-up mailings on
weight-related issues and a pedometer. At baseline, and 4- and 8-month assessments,
adolescents in both study groups received USD15, and at 12 months they received a
USD25 incentive for completing measurements. Parents received a USD15 incentive
for completing measures at each assessment and USD20 at each measurement point to
compensate for transportation costs. Physicians, nurse practitioners and health educators
delivered the therapy

Methods
Parallel RCT, randomisation ratio: 1:1:1, superiority design
Participants
Inclusion criteria: aged 13-18 years, obese (≥ 95th percentile for age and gender)
, adolescents lived with a parent or adult carer who was prepared to be involved in
treatment
Exclusion criteria: taking weight-related medication, having a diagnosis of an eating
disorder, being pregnant, having clinical mental health conditions or psychosis

Interventions
Number of study centres: 1
Treatment before study: none
Description of interventions
Weekly sessions: participants in both intervention groups received 6 × 40-minute indi-
vidual counselling sessions on diet and exercise
MI : targeted improved eating and physical activity behaviour. All adolescents were en-
couraged to express their personal motivation to change their physical activity and dietary
behaviour. Adolescents assisted with reducing resistance and overcoming ambivalence
about behaviour change. MI techniques such as reflective listening, open-ended ques-
tions and eliciting self-motivational statements. The intervention was initiated based on
the underlying spirit of the MI
Session included: in the first phase, the counsellors aimed to foster a confident relation-
ship with the adolescents, address the positive and negative effects of obesity, and increase
the adolescents’ awareness of their current weight status. In the second phase, alternative
courses of action were taken into account, costs and benefits of actions were discussed,

and adolescents’ readiness to change was evaluated. In the third phase, adolescents were
invited to engage in goal setting and planning for change. Adolescents were encouraged
to create an action plan
Also encouraged to achieve at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical
activity daily as recommended by the World Health Organization. Encouraged to eat a
variety of foods from each of the 4 major food groups and low-fat alternatives
The facilitators (dietitian or exercise specialist) completed 20 hours of MI training from
a certified and experienced MI trainer
MI + parental Involvement : identical MI sessions to above. In addition, 1 in-person

weight, parents’ attitudes and behaviours regarding children’s physical activity and dietary
habits, parent monitoring and supervision; the goal was to promote progress toward the
child’s intervention goals and attitudes by the parents. The role of parenting in preparing
healthy foods for their child and encouraging/monitoring them for being physically
active were discussed. Delivered at the end of the 6th session and lasted for > 60 minutes

Inclusion criteria: aged 12-16 years, at “high risk” for diabetes, as defined by the Amer-
ican Diabetes Association expert consensus panel, overweight BMI > 85th percentile
for age and gender, weight and height > 85th percentile, or weight > 120% of ideal for
height) + any 2 of the following risk factors: family history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus
in a first- or second-degree relative, race/ethnicity (American Indian, African-American,
Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander), or signs of insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, hy-
pertension, dyslipidaemia, polycystic ovary syndrome)
Exclusion criteria: diagnosis of diabetes, pregnant, not planning to be in the San Diego
area over the entire study period, had any medical condition that would prevent them
from participating in the intervention
Diagnostic criteria: as above
Interventions
Number of study centres: 18
Treatment before study: none
Description of interventions
4 comparator groups, 3 included a website intervention: website only, website and group
and website and SMS, and 1 usual care
Website only : website and tutorials designed to promote weight loss and healthy be-
haviours related to obesity such as educational topics and challenges based on skill build-
ing exercises, a reward system to encourage success, evaluation for assessment of progress
and feedback on progress. Web tutorials on several behaviour change strategies, such as
goal setting, seeking social support and positive self-statements. Theoretical based on the
behavioural determinants model and the Transtheoretical Model of behaviour change
3 phases, phase 1 (weeks 1-17) entailing education on healthy behaviours, phase 2 (weeks
18-34) interactive games and quizzes for the participant to select challenges and goals,
phase 3 (weeks 35-51) interactive and also encouraged working on multiple behaviours
at the same time. Also had weekly “check-in” e-mails, monthly mailed tip sheets and, if
necessary, a telephone call from a health counsellor
Based on the “stoplight approach,” participants were encouraged to limit red-light ac-
tivities (unproductive, low energy), increase green-light activities (high energy) and do
yellow-light activities in moderation
The website also included information on recommended food portion sizes, categorisa-
tion of foods into the stoplight approach, and a resource library that included tip sheets
and recipes. Parent completed an adult version of the programme website and received
monthly group sessions
Website and group : attendance and participation in group sessions in addition to the
website (treatment as ’website only’). Rewarded with mileage incentives and a lottery
for prizes such as cookbooks or other materials to assist with healthy behaviour change.
Providers underwent a 2-hour counselling training
Website and SMS : minimum of 3 text messages per week that related to weekly chal-
lenges and intervention goals as well as the website (treatment as ’website only’). Re-
minder text messages sent if the participant did not log on to the website by the 4th
day of the intervention. Participants could also communicate via text messages with a
health counsellor if they had questions. Participants were provided with mobile phones
and prepaid text message plans that allowed research staff to monitor SMS use
Control : given printed materials produced by the American Diabetes Association and
the American Heart Association

Description of interventions
Activity : training was directed by a professional teacher of physical education. The
training programme was designed according to the type and intensity of exercise that
school children normally performed. Many activities were delivered as games to encour-
age enthusiasm and participation. Endurance type activities accounted for most of the
time spent in training (about 50% team sports and 50% running games), with attention
to co-ordination and flexibility skills
Diet + activity : training programme + the same activity trainer information was pre-
sented about the reasons behind childhood obesity, dietary and cooking habits, and
the motivation for weight loss to involve the whole family in the “battle” against obe-
sity. Discussion with participants on the food pyramid, food choices, food labels, food
preparation and cooking, eating habits, regular meals and controlling environments that
stimulate overeating. The topics discussed were given to the adolescents in the form of
a printed notebook, while parents were also invited to attend these sessions

Description of interventions
“Lookin’ Good Feelin’ Good” intervention : incorporated recommendations for the
prevention and treatment of child and adolescent overweight and obesity and based on
social cognitive theory. 6 × 1-to-1 counselling sessions of 18-29 minutes over 2 months,
during the school day in non-academic classes in the school nurse’s office. Used the 5-3-
2-1-0 approach to support making 5 daily key behaviour changes: ≥ 5 servings of fruit
and vegetables; 3 structured meals; ≤ 2 hours of television, computer, electronic games;
≥ 1 hour moderate physical activity, 0 limit soda and sugar-sweetened drinks
A participant-centred counselling approach allowed school nurses to tailor the interven-
tion to the student’s needs. At each visit there was a weigh-in and feedback, review of
diet and physical activity logs, assessing progress to behaviour change goals, reviewing
successes, problem solving, setting new goals, assessing behaviour and identifying barri-
ers
Provided and instructed in the use of a pedometer.
A USD25 gift certificate was provided at each assessment.
School nurses were trained through a daylong group training session
Control : 6 × 1-to-1 visits with the school nurse for 8.5-9 minutes over 2 months to
review behaviour changes, read 6 informational pamphlets on weight management and
had questions answered

Exclusion criteria: had no medical contraindications (i.e. cardiovascular/respiratory
anomalies) or significant primary sensory or motor impairments that restricted them
from treadmill walking
Diagnostic criteria: not stated
Interventions
Number of study centres: 1
Treatment before study: none
Description of interventions
Treadmill walking group : weekly activity, regular activity classes (i.e. 15-30 minutes,
Monday-Wednesday-Friday) consisted of treadmill walking, when regular activity classes
were not planned (i.e. Tuesday and Thursday), taken to the gym and given the oppor-
tunity to walk on the treadmill, given the opportunity to walk on the treadmill at their
residence in the evenings
All 10 participants trained to walk unassisted on the treadmill during their regular class
time
Initial frequency of twice per week, progression of 1 day every 2 weeks to a peak frequency
of 5 times per week. Duration was for 8 minutes per session, with a progression of 1-2
minutes every 2-3 weeks to a peak duration of 20 minutes per session. Initial treadmill
speed 2.4-3.5 mph, with a progression of 0.1-0.3 mph every 2-3 weeks to a peak speed
of 3.7-4.1 mph. Initial grade of 0%, with progressive increases of 0.5%
The activities took place under the guidance of a staff member with a Master’s degree in
adapted physical activity
Control group : leisure activity of choice 3 times per week. Not a strict schedule.
Student Support Plan designed and implemented by the residential treatment facility
staff members, allowed for 30 minutes of ’leisure activity’, 3 times per week, at the
campus gym. These activities took place under the guidance of a staff member with a
Master’s degree in adapted physical activity. Classes permitted participants to engage in
the following activities; basketball (shooting, dribbling, passing), jumping rope, roller
skating, scooter-board activities, object control skills (i.e. throwing and catching the ball)
, striking a ball (i.e. tennis or nerf) with a tennis racket or plastic bat and cycling skills
(e.g. adult bicycle or tricycle)

Participants
Inclusion criteria: African-American girls aged 12-16 years and BMI > 90th percentile
for age and gender, churches where the majority of members’ household income was
above USD40,000
Exclusion criteria: unclear
Diagnostic criteria: used the 90th percentile as inclusion cut-off point rather than
the 85th percentile based on formative research and pilot studies. Girls on the lower
end of the obesity continuum, i.e. 85th to 90th percentile, were different behaviourally
and psychologically, and combining girls from the low and high ends of the obesity
continuum would adversely affect group cohesion
Interventions
Number of study centres: 10
Treatment before study: none
Description of interventions
High intensity (24-26 sessions) : girls attended weekly group behavioural sessions.
Parents were encouraged to attend sessions (around 12 sessions). Each group session
included an experiential, interactive behavioural activity, at least 30 minutes of mod-
erate-to-vigorous physical exercise, and preparation or consumption (or both) of low-
fat, portion-controlled meals or snacks. Target behaviours included: increased fruit and
vegetable intake, decreased fat intake, decreased fast-food intake, decreased sedentary
behaviour and increased physical activity. Girls were taught to reshape their target be-
haviours using the principles of substitution, moderation and abstinence. Girls focused
their behaviour change on target foods or priority behaviours identified or selected by
the girls. At the beginning of each intervention cycle, girls only attended a 1-day retreat
where participants completed a low ropes course and team building activities, ate healthy
portion-controlled meals and attended a group session on hunger and satiety. All girls
received a 2-way paging device. Messages, developed by the girls based on their target
foods and activity patterns, were sent to them throughout the day and in key times when
they needed reminders about their eating or physical activity. Received 4-6 MI calls by
telephone over the 6 months of intervention to support and help in behavioural change
Moderate intensity (6 sessions) control : sessions were selected from the larger pool of
sessions delivered to the high-intensity group. Parents were encouraged to attend sessions
(3 sessions). Topics included fat facts, barriers to physical activity, fad diets, neophobia
(i.e. fear of new foods) and benefits of physical activity. Girls did not receive the 2-way
pagers, MI telephone calls or kick-off retreat

church representatives and study staff that
6 sessions represented a meaningful inter-

not jeopardise between-group differences.
However, using different timings in the
comparator (once per month instead of
once per week) and this may have had an

Interventions
Number of study centres: unclear
Treatment before study: none
Description of interventions
Healthy Habits : computer and telephone intervention. Adolescents engaged in a com-
puter program after baseline assessment, the program was adapted from PACE+ soft-
ware designed for adolescents and modified for overweight adolescents. It assessed eat-
ing, physical activity and sedentary behaviour and guided adolescents through individ-
ualised plans generated to increase physical activity or decrease sedentary behaviour and
decrease dietary fat or increase fruits/vegetables or decrease overeating/snacking. Plan
generation included identifying benefits, barriers and specific strategies to achieve goals.
Action plan summaries were generated, and a provider summary was produced for the
behaviours targeted by the adolescent. Met with a paediatrician to discuss action plans
(tailored physician counselling), and approximately 1 week after the clinic visit met the
study author to discuss upcoming mail and telephone contacts and to learn food self-
monitoring
Calls from a telephone counsellor 1 week later detailed telephone scripts to address
adolescents’ weight change since the last call, the link between weight change and eating
and physical activity behaviours, instruction and feedback on self-monitoring, goals and
behavioural skills
Provided with a manual and information sheets. Self-monitoring of food and beverage
intake and calories consumed
Foods were categorised into green, red or no colour foods. Green defined as ≤ 1 g of fat
per serving, 150 calories per serving and providing a good source of ≥ 1 valuable dietary
components (e.g. calcium, fibre or protein), red foods were defined as having ≥ 5 g of
fat per serving or were diet versions of high-fat foods. The eventual green food goal was
40 green food servings (based on standard serving sizes) or more per week, and the red
food goal was 15 red food servings per week
Encouraged to self-monitor physical activity daily with a goal of a minimum of 60
minutes of at least moderate-intensity physical activity on 5 days per week with gradual
increases from baseline
Overall duration 16 weeks with 13 sessions.
Paediatricians trained with the study protocol and telephone counsellors (with at least a
Bachelor’s degree in psychology or nutrition) received weekly supervision
Standard care control : non-tailored physician-counselling session. 1 session in the 16-
week treatment period by the same paediatrician as the intervention group. Assessed/
encouraged the adolescent’s motivation for weight-related behaviour change, provided
information about short- and long-term health consequences of high weight status and
benefits of better weight control, made recommendations for healthful eating consistent
with the Food Guide Pyramid, reviewed physical activity recommendations for adoles-
cents (60 minutes per day of at least moderate-intensity physical activity), and encour-
aged consistency and persistence with health behaviour changes. Used a worksheet to fa-
cilitate the discussions. Adolescents encouraged to implement recommended behaviour
changes on their own and with the help of their family
Adolescents received USD25 for post-treatment and USD25 for follow-up assessment.
In the intervention group, a lottery occurred after all adolescents had completed post-
treatment assessment for USD50. Adolescents were awarded 1 point each for meeting
self-monitoring, physical activity, calorie, green food goals and red food goals each week

Participants
Inclusion criteria: BMI > 95th percentile based on the CDC growth chart, aged 8-16
years, English-speaking ability, shown an interest in the weight management programme,
have a carer (e.g. father, mother or grandparent) who was willing to participate in the
educational component of the programme
Exclusion criteria: haddiabetes,psychiatricdisorder(e.g.schizophrenia, severe autismor
mental retardation, or psychosis) or other serious medical condition that would preclude
participation in the programme, taking medications that potentially cause significant
weight gain (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine) as well as using medications for

Description of interventions
Bright Bodies weight management : nutrition/behaviour modification once (40 min-
utes each) per week: behaviour modification classes for participants and carers were held
separately. Topics were provided from the Smart Moves Workbook, a curriculum devel-
oped for overweight children and used in the authors’ pilot study. Sample topics included
Ready, Set, Goal!, Risky Business: Identifying High-risk Situations, Environmental En-
gineering, Mirror, Mirror on the Wall, Bullies, Teasers, and Other Annoying People and

Oops I Slipped - Understanding a Relapse. Attended the programme twice per week for
6 months and then every other week for an additional 6 months
Techniques included self-awareness, goal setting, stimulus control, CST, cognitive be-
haviour strategies and contingency management. Behaviour modification classes for car-
ers included topics that reflected the challenges that parents verbalised. Classes empha-
sised the importance of the parents’ roles in modelling healthy behaviour change. Moti-
vational tools were used to encourage regular attendance
Each class of high-intensity exercise to sustain 65-80% of the age-adjusted maximal
heart rate held twice (50 minutes each) and nutrition/behaviour modification once (40
minutes each) per week. Participants were also encouraged to exercise 3 additional days
at home per week and to decrease sedentary behaviours. The minimum activity that each
participant completed was 100 minutes per week (2 × 50-minute sessions) for the first
6 months and 100 minutes twice per month for the last 6 months
The nutrition education component of the weight management programme used a non-
diet approach that emphasised low-fat, nutrient-dense foods of moderate portion sizes
No details of trainer provided, registered dietitians supervised nutritional component
Control : received diet and exercise counselling by registered dietitians and physicians
along with brief psychosocial counselling by a social worker. The participant and carer
were both involved in setting the nutrition and activity goals to ensure that the clinic plan
was realistic and accepted by both. Exercise counselling included decreasing sedentary
activities (computer and video games) and finding an activity the participant enjoyed
enough to engage in on a regular basis. Nutrition counselling included decreasing intake
of juice, switching to diet beverages, switching from whole-fat to low-fat milk and
bringing lunch to school vs choosing hot lunch. 30-minute session every 6 months

The study initially re-randomised those in the weight management group to either a
meal plan group or a better food choices group. After high levels of attrition in the meal
plan group (at 6 months, 83%) this arm was discontinued. No results for this group
were reported

Description of interventions
All groups had 3 counselling sessions (baseline, 3 months and 6 months) by a registered
dietitian to promote healthy eating, with a daily energy deficit of 250 kcal (see details of
run-in session). Also had telephone support at 6 weeks and 4 months
The 3 exercising groups attended gyms 4 times weekly. Duration 22 weeks. Exercise was
supervised by personal trainers weekly to 3 months, and biweekly from 3-6 months.
Personal trainers monitored attendance and exercise progression by reviewing sign-in
sheets and exercise logs. To encourage adherence and retention, participants completing
all measurement assessments received a USD50 gift certificate. In addition, participants
who maintained good compliance (≥ 70% of sessions attended) obtained a free gym
membership renewal for a subsequent 6-month period (postintervention)
Diet + aerobic exercise : followed diet plan + exercised on treadmills, elliptical machines
or bicycle ergometers. Heart rate monitors used to adjust workloads to achieve target
heart rates. Gradual progressed in exercise duration (20-45 minutes per aerobic exercise
session) and intensity (65-85% of maximum heart rate)
Diet + resistance exercise : followed diet plan + performed 7 exercises using weight
machines or free weights, progressing from 2 sets of 15 repetitions at moderate intensity
to 3 sets of 8 repetitions at the maximum resistance that could be moved 8 times (8-
RM), duration progressed to a maximum of 45 minutes
Diet + aerobic + resistance exercise : followed diet plan + full aerobic training pro-
gramme + resistance training programme during each session
Diet-only control : followed the same eating plan as those in the exercise groups, wait
list control as offered the option to begin an exercise programme (with a free gym
membership) for the subsequent 6 months

were instructed to work out at least 3 times per week. These workout sessions consisted of
a mix of aerobic and strength exercises. In general, a session this would typically include:
short warming up and stretching; 30 minutes of aerobic exercises such as treadmill
running, cycling, rowing, stepping; strength exercises focused on large muscle groups
such as pectoral, upper arm, abdominal and leg muscles; and a cooling down period.
The practical implementation of these general guidelines was left to the respective fitness
centres
Participants in the intervention group were offered nutritional counselling by a dietitian.
Topic of these counselling sessions was healthy food choices and maintaining a proper
energy balance. Every session there was a specific theme, e.g. breakfast, snacks, drinks,
dairy products, fast food, portion sizes, nutritional labelling, motivation and coping
strategies, based on the Flemish model of ’the active food pyramid’, as proposed by the
Flemish institute of Health Promotion, an inventory of specific food product and popular
brands in adolescents, categorised by health effect, was developed as an attractive hang-
up model. Main goals were improving food knowledge, attitude and behaviour
Total sessions: 6 nutrition sessions: individual or group (maximum of 2 group sessions)
once per month. Took place in school after or between school hours. 6 counselling
sessions once per month. No mention of total length of session but they included 30-
minute aerobic exercises

Diagnostic criteria: as above.
Interventions
Number of study centres: 1
Treatment before study: -
Description of interventions
Low-GI diet : individual goals for weight management were set. Emphasis on low-GI
foods was provided. A dietitian emphasised the selection of low-GI carbohydrates that
fit Thai culture and their routine lives. The energy distribution was carbohydrate 50-
55%, protein 15-20% and fat 30-35%. Each visit consisted of a 2-hour, small class
teaching session with parental participation (4-5 families/class). The contents varied
from the 1st to 6th visit, starting from portion size and food exchange, modest energy
restriction, principle of GI, sources of low-GI diet, cooking demonstration of low-GI
dishes, guidance about food labelling and some games about GI of common food and
beverages
Control group : received conventional instructions at the nutrition clinic about low
energy (approximately 1200-1300 kcal/day), low-fat (25% of total energy from fat) and
high-fibre diet by another dietitian who gave the dietary advices with special emphasis
on the energy restriction such as energy count and how to avoid high-fat Thai dishes as

other cognitive behavioural treatment programme with the focus on reducing obesity
Diagnostic criteria: not stated.
Interventions
Number of study centres: 1.
Treatment before study: none.
Description of interventions
Family-based intervention : an individual consultation with the child psychologist,
group intervention with 8-10 participants in each group. Received a treatment manual
with the objectives and goals of the treatment and, per session, information about the
topics discussed. The focus was on the effort to change habits more than weight reduction
goals. Adolescents were made aware of their own actions and their way of living that has
led to their obesity
Several cognitive behavioural techniques were learned (knowledge, skills and attitude)
during the intensive phase of the treatment during 6 bi-weekly sessions of 2.5 hours per
session. Each session contained: determination of body weight, homework discussion
and evaluation, education, physical activity, role playing, discussing homework for next
meeting and set goals linked to educational topics of the session. The educational topics
included group bond to encourage peer support, individual motivation for participating,
nutritional information and the balance between energy intake and energy expenditure,
healthy nutrition, self-control techniques, coping with teasing and being teased, self-
image, cognitive strategies and relapse techniques
Current physical activity level and sedentary behaviour of the child also reviewed, energy
intake versus energy expenditure was evaluated and visualised for the adolescent by a
computer program. Options to change or optimise physical and sedentary activities were
debated and the participants were advised how to find suitable exercise programmes
Taught how to read product labels and obtain information on misleading advertisement
and discuss how to deal with meals (breakfast, lunch, diner, 2 healthy snacks), and how
to make healthy choices and develop healthy eating habits (small bits, slow eating, eating
at the family table, no other activities during eating)
Parents had separate parallel parent group sessions (5 evenings) by a dietitian and a social
worker. Included information on healthy nutrition, product information, quantities,
eating moments, eating locations, how to help their children and parenting styles
Final session was a joint session to celebrate the end of the programme, where participants
were encouraged to bring healthy snacks, games and activities were also planned instead
of the intake of food alone
Deliveredbydietitian, physiotherapistandpsychologist, unclearifsame foreach meeting.
No information on training of those delivering the programme
Wait list control : initial advice on physical activity and nutrition. During the 12-month
study period, the children were seen at start, after 3 months and at end of the period just
before they start the treatment. Wait list control offered the treatment after 12 months

Description of interventions
Motivational interviewing intervention : counselling sessions were approximately 30
minutes long, 6 sessions held at the time of regularly scheduled healthy lifestyles ap-
pointments. Interventionist was a clinical psychology doctoral student trained in MI.
Guided toward increasing awareness of unhealthy behaviours, consideration of whether
current behaviour was consistent with personal values and envision how change may be
helpful. Where ambivalence or resistance to change, agenda setting, decisional balances
and scale questions with empathy and supporting autonomy were used
The interviewer was trained in MI and received professional supervision
Social skills training: counselling sessions were approximately 30 minutes long, 6 ses-
sions held at the time of regularly scheduled healthy lifestyles appointments. Offered
advice rather than attempting to elicit ideas, prescribed goals to work on without specific
regard for the client’s readiness to change. Used a standardised treatment manual, de-
veloped and validated for children and adolescents. Sessions were based around finding
appropriate ways to navigate typical social situations
Different interventionist to the MI group who was provided with feedback at monthly
intervals

Description of interventions
Mentored behaviour changingintervention : adolescents and family members attended
a 1-day group educational workshop at the beginning of the study, given specific instruc-
tions and written materials regarding how to self-assess behaviour and environment, and
successively implement small changes by setting goals toward measurable and attainable
outcomes. Learned about the study recommendations for physical activity and nutrition.
Visits at baseline, 1, 2, 3 and 6 months included nutrition and activity counselling
Met with a mentor in person for 1-2 hours once per week to achieve activity goals,
participate in physical activity, and discuss and set nutritional goals. Additionally, they
agreed to communicate (either through telephone or e-mail) twice per week for support
Mentoring was provided by mentor volunteers were recruited from the University of
Toronto (Ontario). Unclear who delivered the remaining behaviour changing interven-
tions. The mentor had regular contact with study personnel, and monthly group meet-
ings and were trained to standardise the intervention
Control : as above without the additional mentor support

Participants
Condition: obesity
Enrollment: 80
Inclusion criteria: children and adolescents aged 8-18 years referred to Heideheuvel by their own paedia-
trician. They must have BMI-SDS ≥ 2.3 according to the growth curves based on the 4th Dutch National
Growth Study of 1997 (this corresponds to the 99th percentile) and comorbidity related to obesity (e.g.

Exclusion criteria: having syndromal or chromosomal determined obesity, obesity caused by endocrine
disorders (hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, primary hyperinsulinaemia, pseudohypoparathyroidism,
acquired (structural) hypothalamic damage) or medicine use (e.g. oral steroids, antiepileptic drugs, antide-
pressants), severe psychiatric problems, an IQ < 75 or similar school level or if their parents are not willing
to participate in the treatment
Interventions
Intervention A: intensive combined behaviour changing inpatient treatment for 6 months during week-
days, followed by biweekly hospital admissions of 2 days for 4 months
Intervention B: intensive combined behaviour changing inpatient treatment for 2 months during week-
days, followed by biweekly return visits of 2 days during the next 4 months, then followed by 6 monthly
return visits of 2 days

Official title
Health effects of behaviour changing interventions in obese children and adolescents study (Helios) - a
randomised controlled trial
Stated purpose of study
Quote: “to compare the cost-effectiveness of these two intensive one-year inpatient treatments to each
other and to usual care for severely obese children and adolescents.”
Notes
Study only intended to compare the 2 active interventions. The thesis states that for ’logistical reasons’
they randomised to a wait list control group, review authors assumed as they were only able to take a small
number of participants through the interventions at any 1 time. They also randomise to the groups in 2
batches so that every 6 months for 2 years they start a new intervention 1 and 2 with 10 participants each.
The flow chart and number of participants do not show the wait list control group but include them when
they are included in intervention A and B. There is 1 analysis for the 3 groups (6 and 12 months only as
appropriate) which was described as an “additional analysis.” For the purpose of the review, the comparison
with the wait list control would be relevant; however, there are no numbers included in the analysis, no
baseline characteristics and the only data for BMI-SDS is from a figure. Awaiting further clarification from
author or publication of the data to know if this group will be analysable

Participants
Condition: overweight and obesity (≥ 85th centile)
Enrollment: 570
Inclusion criteria: aged 12-17 years; overweight or obese (≥ 85th centile) according to the age- and gender-
specific BMI data from the International Obesity Task Force; Internet access at home or at a location where
regular use is possible (i.e. school, library). Recruitment will be restricted to those living in the Melbourne
metropolitan area (to facilitate complete follow-up assessments by maximising opportunities to collect
height and weight data, and to contain study costs)
Exclusion criteria: young people with a known endocrine or chromosomal cause for their obesity; taking
prescription medication resulting in weight changes (e.g. prednisolone); complications of overweight that
contraindicate moderate physical activity (e.g. orthopaedic disorders); past or current medical diagnosis
of a clinical eating disorder (i.e. anorexia or bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder) or significant health
disability or condition which prevents participation
Interventions
Intervention: Internet-based programme for 12 weeks, 1 session per week for self-directed 30-60 minutes.
Goals will be set by the participant from a framework recommended within the programme (e.g. to
increase moderate activity from 0 to 30 minutes on most days) and reviewed every week, activities will
be specific to intervention group but not to each individual. Participants will receive a pedometer and a
walking programme to help achieve goal of 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity per day. Cognitive
behaviour aspect of the programme will address self-monitoring, goal setting, stimulus control, social
eating, etc
Participants will receive feedback at least weekly. Parents of participants will be sent monthly newsletters
for the 3 months of the intervention programme with tips on creating a supportive environment. After
the 12-week programme is finished, participants will receive monthly follow-up via text or e-mail asking
them to review their eating and physical activity habits, and provide feedback. They can also review the
materials from the programme
Comparator: publicly available generic health information about healthy eating and physical activity at
start of 12 weeks treatment period. Information will be presented in both paper and online format (e.
g. participant will receive a pack with flyers about the physical activity requirements, healthy eating and
planning healthy meals and a sheet with links to websites about the age appropriate healthy eating, physical
activity and mental health). No cognitive behaviour element
Outcomes
Primary outcome: reduction in BMI z score

Environmental strategies & behavior change to reduce overeating in obese children
Stated purpose of study
Quote: “There is a need for effective weight control methods for obese children. Environmental strategies
such as reducing the size of dishware and serving utensils, storing food out of view and reducing food
consumption while watching television may reduce food intake without requiring conscious, cognitive self-
control. The investigators propose to test these methods when added to a current state-of-the-art behavioral
program.”

Inclusion criteria: female military dependents; aged 12-17 years; at high risk for excess weight gain (BMI
≥ 85th percentile) who report lifetime loss of control eating or ≥ 2 current indicators of loss of control
eating (e.g. eating in response to negative affect, feelings of guilt or shame around eating)
Exclusion criteria: presence of a chronic major medical illness (e.g. renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, en-
docrinological); documented, obesity-related medical complication requiring a more intensive intervention
approach; psychiatric conditions (e.g. psychosis, suicidality) that would impede programme participation;
current weight loss treatment; current weight-affecting medication usage; pregnancy (current or recent);
current breastfeeding
Interventions
Intervention:interpersonal psychotherapy-based intervention: 1 initial 1.5-hour individual session,
and 12 weekly 90-minute group sessions that take place after school hours. The interpersonal inventory
interview to identify the strengths, problems and goals of the adolescent. Information used to link problems
to loss of control eating and other disturbed eating attitudes or behaviours. Sessions delivered over different
phases. A psychoeducation phase (sessions 1-3), such as education about the predictors of excess weight
gain, outlining problem areas and discussing the link between feelings and interpersonal interactions.
Intermediate phase (sessions 4-9) where group members practice skills such as hypothetical scenarios and
role-plays. Training on how interpersonal strategies can be applied to different, specific relationships in the
adolescents’ lives, particularly relationships that are linked to loss of control and emotionally induced eating.
A termination phase (sessions 10-12) the group reviews improvements in loss of control eating and related
symptoms, with a focus on identifying possible warning signs of a return or increase in problematic eating
and knowing when to seek help. Finally, group members are encouraged to continue the interpersonal
work on their own
Comparator:health education control: receives a workbook on how to live a healthier life, discussing
topics unrelated to eating. Participants complete 4 monthly 90-minute group meetings during after school
hours to discuss the information presented in the workbook. The workbook will serve as a guide for teens
to improve their self-image, build friendships, resist peer pressure and engage in goal-setting

CBT for depression and healthy lifestyle plus ex-
ercise: CBT treatment adapted into 1 integrated
protocol that addresses depression, an exercise
component, weight and advice regarding healthy
eating. Weekly 60-minute group aerobic exercise
sessions were required and facilitated by a phys-
iotherapist

Stepped down care based on cognitive be-
havioural modification, individual sessions of
counselling health education and telephone calls.
Consisted of 3 × 4-month steps but the number
and frequency of each intervention step varied.
Aimed for adolescents to lose 4 lb every 4 months
and if the 4-lb weight loss was achieved, the par-
ticipant was ’stepped-down’ to the next level of
reduced intensity
Enhanced usual care. 1 counselling visit, 1 health
education visit, materials and monthly mailings
of weight-related materials

aQuestions on risk of bias were answered in relation to the majority of the aggregated evidence in the meta-analysis rather than to
individual studies.
bQuestions on inconsistency were primarily based on visual assessment of forest plots and the statistical quantification of heterogeneity
based on I2.
cWhen judging the width of the confidence interval it was recommended to use a clinical decision threshold to assess whether the
imprecision was clinically meaningful.
dQuestions addressed comprehensiveness of the search strategy, industry influence, funnel plot asymmetry and discrepancies between
published and unpublished trials.

New citation required and conclusions have changed
This review concludes that combined behavioural
lifestyle interventions compared to standard care or self-
help can produce a significant and clinically meaningful
reduction in overweight in children and adolescents
The search was updated to May 2008. Some amend-
ments were made to update the search strategies. No
changes have been made to other aspects of the method-
ology. Forty-six new studies have been included. These
included information on drug interventions for treating
obesity in adolescents. The added evidence suggests that
lifestyle interventions appear to have positive effects in
the treatment of child and adolescent obesity. Further-

Given the rapid growth in the treatment of child and adolescent obesity, the original review was split into six separate reviews, with a
specific intervention and age focus.
• Diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.
• Diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years.
• Diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in infants aged 0 to 4 years.
• Drug interventions for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents.
• Parent-only interventions for childhood overweight or obesity.
• Surgery for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents.
For behaviour changing interventions, we included only randomised controlled trials that were specifically designed to treat obesity in
children and observed participants for a minimum of six months. The rationale for introducing this criterion arose from the belief that
many interventions appear to be effective in the short term (up to three months), but not in the long term (Glenny 1997). It seemed to
be more important to evaluate the longer-term effects of treatments, as this would provide a more valuable indication of effectiveness,
given the chronic nature of obesity.
We did not present prediction intervals as originally described for the suite of reviews for consistency as the other reviews did not do
this either in consultation with the review group.
We did not perform the following sensitivity analyses.
• Restricting the analysis taking into account risk of bias, as specified in the section Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
section, but we did look at the effects of attrition bias and other potential bias introduced by analysis of cluster randomised controlled
trials.

 • Restricting the analysis to very long or large studies to establish how much they dominated the results.
• Restricting the analysis to studies using the following filters: diagnostic criteria, funding source and country.
This is in line with other reviews in this series.
