The current drug regimens for treating tuberculosis are lengthy and onerous, and hence
complicated by poor adherence leading to drug resistance and disease relapse. Previously,
using an output-driven optimization platform and an in vitro macrophage model of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, we identified several experimental drug regimens among
billions of possible drug-dose combinations that outperform the current standard regimen.
Here we use this platform to optimize the in vivo drug doses of two of these regimens in a
mouse model of pulmonary tuberculosis. The experimental regimens kill M. tuberculosis much
more rapidly than the standard regimen and reduce treatment time to relapse-free cure by
75%. Thus, these regimens have the potential to provide a markedly shorter course
of treatment for tuberculosis in humans. As these regimens omit isoniazid, rifampicin,
fluoroquinolones and injectable aminoglycosides, they would be suitable for treating many
cases of multidrug and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.

 T
uberculosis (TB) is a major health problem of global
proportions. In 2014, an estimated 9.6 million people fell ill
with TB and 1.5 million people died, placing TB above
HIV as the number one infectious cause of death worldwide1.
Although drug-sensitive TB, which comprises 96.7% of new cases,
is a treatable disease, the current standard treatment requires
6–8 months of a multi-drug regimen to achieve relapse-free
cure2,3. This long course of treatment is often associated with
toxicity, poor adherence and development of drug resistance.
A more effective drug combination that provides more rapid
sterilization of tissues has the potential to ameliorate these critical
problems4–6.
History suggests that the long duration of treatment required
to achieve relapse-free cure may be attributable more to
limitations in bactericidal activity of the antimicrobial drug
combination than to the intrinsic biology of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis.
The
first
regimen
in
1952,
consisting
of
streptomycin, isoniazid (INH) and para-aminosalicylic acid
required 24 months therapy; replacing para-aminosalicylic acid
by ethambutol (EMB) in the 1960s and subsequently adding
rifampicin (RIF) in the 1970s sequentially shortened treatment
duration first to 18 months and then to 9–12 months, and
substituting pyrazinamide (PZA) for streptomycin in the 1980s
further cut treatment duration to 6–8 months7.
These previous treatment regimens, culminating in today’s
Standard Regimen (INH, RIF, EMB and PZA), in which one drug
was added or substituted at a time, were not based on a systematic
search to identify the most highly synergistic drug combinations.
Indeed, contrary to the concept of synergy, two of the four drugs
in the Standard Regimen (EMB and PZA) are dropped after
2 months to reduce patient exposure to potential toxic side
effects, as by this point they are considered superfluous to
treatment and no longer needed to prevent the emergence of drug
resistance. Thus, it is likely that an approach centred on
identifying the most highly synergistic drug combinations has
the potential to shorten further the duration of treatment
required to achieve relapse-free cure of TB.
Since conventional evaluation of a large number of TB drugs,
even at a few doses, would require testing of an enormous
number of drug-dose combinations, a systematic approach is
required to identify the most promising drug combinations for
treating TB. We have previously developed a method, called
Feedback
System
Control,
Second
Generation
(FSC.II)
or
Parabolic Response Surface (PRS), in which experimental data
is used to solve the second order algebraic equation that describes
the drug dose-efficacy response of a multi-drug combination. The
PRS approach can map out the entire drug dose-efficacy
landscape from a very large search space and rapidly home in
on optimal drug-dose combinations. In previous work, PRS
enabled us to identify numerous combinations of TB drugs that
exhibit higher antimicrobial activity than the Standard Regimen
(INH, RIF, EMB and PZA) in vitro in a human macrophage
model of M. tuberculosis infection8. Both fluorescence-based
bacterial metabolic activity and confirmatory CFU-based killing
studies identified two regimens as having greater efficacy than the
Standard Regimen—PRS Regimen I (Clofazimine (CLZ)/EMB/
Prothionamide (PRO)/PZA) and PRS Regimen II (CLZ/EMB/
Bedaquiline (BDQ)/PZA), in which PRO was replaced with the
recently developed drug, BDQ. However, preclinical studies in
animal models are essential to evaluating the safety and efficacy of
new multidrug regimens and determining which combinations
merit advancement to clinical trials9. While no animal model
is perfect, the BALB/c mouse model of pulmonary TB has
been broadly predictive of human clinical results and provides a
practicable model for comparing multiple TB drug regimens10–12—
such as those that we identified using the PRS method in vitro.
Here, using the mouse model, we apply the PRS method to
model the parabolic drug dose-efficacy response surface13–20 of
two of the regimens and thereby identify optimal drug doses for
use of these regimens in vivo. Since in vivo and in vitro drug dose
ratios can differ markedly, dose re-optimization is a crucial step
for ensuring the success of in vivo studies. As the PRS approach to
transitioning from in vitro to in vivo drug doses is output-driven,
it is agnostic to such considerations as drug mechanism
and bacterial metabolic state, automatically takes into account
drug–drug interactions, and is not dependent on pharmacokinetic
studies. We then compare the two optimized experimental
regimens with the Standard Regimen for time required to
attain culture negativity in infected lung tissues and to achieve
relapse-free cure.
Results
Efficacy study of PRS Regimen I. To determine the optimal dose
for individual drugs in PRS Regimen I, we mapped the drug
dose-efficacy response surface after a 4-week course of treatment
in a mouse model of pulmonary TB. For each drug, the highest
dose used was equal to the highest dose previously used in mouse
models of pulmonary TB in the literature, and the dose range
chosen included the standard human equivalent dose. To reduce
the number of different treatment groups required to map the
drug dose-efficacy response surface with PRS methodology to a
practicable number (10 groups), we held the dose of one (CLZ) of
the 4 drugs constant, while varying the doses of the other three
drugs. We infected mice by aerosol with the highly virulent
M. tuberculosis strain Erdman, delivering 2.22±0.09 (mean±s.e.m.)
log10 colony forming units (CFU) of M. tuberculosis per lung.
Higher challenge doses, such as those used by others10 in similar
types of studies employing the less virulent M. tuberculosis
strain H37Rv (ref. 21), could not be used because mice challenged
with such doses of the Erdman strain died before treatment
could be initiated at two-weeks post-challenge. By two weeks
post challenge, the burden of M. tuberculosis had increased
by 4 logs to 6.24±0.05 log10 CFU per lung, at which point we
initiated antibiotic treatment by oral gavage five times a week
(Monday—Friday).
Ten
groups
of
mice
received
CLZ
at
25 mg kg � 1
and
EMB,
PRO
and
PZA
were
given
at
permutations of high, middle (1/3rd the high dose) or low
(1/9th the high dose) doses as indicated in Table 1; Fig. 1a. As
controls, one group of mice was treated with the Standard
Regimen (INH/RIF/EMB/PZA) and another group received sham
treatment.
On completion of the 4-week treatment, the sham-treated mice
had 6.67±0.09 log10 CFU of M. tuberculosis in their lungs
(Fig. 1a; Supplementary Table 1). Treatment with the Standard
Regimen significantly reduced lung burden by 2.43 log10 CFU
(Po0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction). Mice in
all 10 PRS Regimen I-treated groups had fewer CFU in their lungs
than mice treated with the Standard Regimen. The best PRS
Regimen I group (that is HHHH) had 1.79 logs fewer CFU in
their lungs than mice treated with the Standard Regimen
(Po0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction). These
results correlated with the severity of gross pathology and number
of tubercles on the lung surface (Fig. 2). Thus, PRS Regimen I has
markedly greater bactericidal activity in the mouse model
than the Standard Regimen. On completion of the 4-week
treatment, the sham-treated mice had 4.07±0.19 log10 CFU of
M. tuberculosis in the liver and 5.03±0.11 log10 CFU in the
spleen, while all treated groups had o2.2 log10 CFU in the liver
and less than 1.7 log10 CFU in the spleen.
A parabolic drug dose-efficacy response surface was generated
from the regression equation fitted to the lung log10 CFU data

 from the 10 groups of mice treated with various drug-dose
combinations of PRS Regimen I (Methods, equation 2). This drug
dose-efficacy response surface had a fitting correlation (r) of 0.999
between the measured log10 CFU and the projected log10 CFU
and an adjusted R2 value of 0.993 indicating that the model
explains 99.3% of the variability in the projected log10 CFU.
A comparison of the observed means versus the predicted means
of the response surface model showed a per cent difference
{per cent difference ¼ 100 � (observed mean—predicted mean)/
((observed mean þ predicted mean)/2)} of r1.4% with an
average difference of 0.036%. Levene’s test showed no deviation
from homoscedasticity among the 10 PRS Regimen I s.d.,
satisfying the requirements for s.d. pooling in the parabolic and
ANOVA analyses.
We found that, with CLZ and PZA doses kept constant, the
drug dose-response surface for EMB and PRO was relatively flat,
as dose variations of these two drugs had relatively little influence
on the efficacy of PRS Regimen I to reduce the lung burden of
M. tuberculosis (Fig. 1c, top). In contrast, differences in PZA dose
had a major impact on lung burden reduction of the combination
regimen (Fig. 1c, middle and bottom). Among the 10 PRS
Regimen I-treated groups, mice treated with the individual
drugs at their highest dose had the lowest lung burden of
M. tuberculosis, whereas mice treated with the identical drug
doses except for PZA, which was at low dose, had the
highest lung bacterial burden. The difference in bacterial
burden in the lungs between these two groups was highly
significant (Po0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction).
Thus, both the drugs and the drug ratio in a drug combination are
important to the outcome of the treatment.
Efficacy study of PRS Regimen II. We applied the same strategy
to map the drug dose-efficacy response surface and assess
treatment efficacy for PRS Regimen II (Fig. 1b; Supplementary
Table 2). Mice that were sham-treated had 6.71±0.05 log10 CFU
of M. tuberculosis per lung at the end of the 4-week treatment
period (Supplementary Table 2). Treatment with the Standard
Regimen reduced lung burden of M. tuberculosis by 2.77 logs
(Po0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction). Mice
treated with any of the 10 dose variations of the PRS Regimen II
(with various doses of EMB, BDQ and PZA) reduced bacterial
burden in the lung by 4.75 to 5.95 logs to a level significantly
lower than that achieved by the Standard Regimen (Po0.0001,
one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction). Mice in the best PRS
Regimen II-treated group had 3.2 logs fewer CFU in their lung
than mice treated with the Standard Regimen. Mice treated with
PRS Regimen II also exhibited the least gross lung pathology
and number of tubercles on the lung compared with mice that
were sham-treated or treated with the Standard Regimen (Fig. 3).
Thus, PRS Regimen II is significantly more efficacious than the
Standard Regimen. PRS Regimen II is also more potent than PRS
Regimen I, as indicated by a larger reduction in lung burden;
indeed, in 4 out of 10 groups, no organism was detected in any of
the animals. These two regimens differ by a single drug with PRO
in PRS Regimen I replaced by BDQ in PRS Regimen II. With
BDQ, instead of PRO in the regimen, variation of the PZA dose
had a smaller impact on treatment efficacy (Fig. 1d, middle and
bottom). However, decreasing the dose of BDQ alone or that of
BDQ and PZA together adversely affected the efficacy of PRS
Regimen II (Fig. 1d, bottom).
On the basis of lung log10 CFU data, a parabolic drug dose-
efficacy response surface was generated for PRS Regimen II which
had a fitting correlation of 0.995 and an adjusted R2 value of 0.981
(Methods, equation 3). A comparison of the observed means
versus the predicted means of the response surface model showed
a per cent difference of r6.8% with an average difference of
0.33%. One drug combination group (that is, HMMH) among the
10 PRS Regimen II groups was identified as an outlier under the
model and was omitted in a repeat assessment. The model
estimated that optimal doses of the drugs in the combination
were about the same with or without this group in the model.
Levene’s test showed no deviation from homoscedasticity among
9 of the 10 PRS Regimen II s.d., satisfying the requirements for
s.d. pooling in the parabolic and ANOVA analyses.
PRS regimens rapidly render lungs culture negative. To
determine the treatment time required for the PRS regimens to
render the lung of M. tuberculosis-infected mice culture negative,
we conducted a direct comparison of the treatment efficacy of
these two PRS regimens against the Standard Regimen (Tables 2
and 3). Since the lung burden of M. tuberculosis in PRS Regimen
II-treated mice in the 4-week short-term study was at the
experimental limit of detection when PZA was administered at
both the low and high doses, we assessed PRS Regimen II in an
8-week treatment study with PZA both at the 150 mg kg � 1
middle dose and the 450 mg kg � 1 high dose, which we termed
PRS Regimen IIA and IIB, respectively (Fig. 4; Table 1). In
addition, we included in this study the Enhanced Standard
Regimen, where the dose of PZA was increased to 450 mg kg � 1,
the same as in the optimized PRS Regimen I. Although
the 150 mg kg � 1 dose of PZA is commonly used in mouse
studies22,23 and is thought to match the standard human dose,
a higher 300 mg kg � 1 dose of PZA has been shown to have

 greater efficacy in both mouse and guinea pig24 and the addition
of a 450 mg kg � 1 dose of PZA has been shown to increase the
efficacy of a gatifloxacin, ethionamide combination in a mouse
model of pulmonary TB (ref. 25).
In this 8-week treatment study, at the time treatment was
started two weeks post-challenge, the number of M. tuberculosis
CFU per lung in infected mice was 6.04±0.08 log10 (Fig. 4a;
Supplementary Table 3). Without treatment, M. tuberculosis
continued to multiply, and by two weeks later, the lung burden of
M. tuberculosis plateaued at B7 log10 CFU for the duration of
the experiment. Treatment with the Standard Regimen reduced
M. tuberculosis burden in the lung by 2.6 logs at week 2 and by
5.2 logs at week 8. Although the difference was not statistically
significant at week 3, the Enhanced Standard Regimen was
significantly more efficacious than the Standard Regimen at week
4 (Po0.001) and week 8 (Po0.0001, one-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s correction). At the end of the 8-week treatment study,
M. tuberculosis could still be cultured from the lungs of mice
treated with the Standard Regimen and Enhanced Standard
Regimen. Indeed, in a subsequent 20-week long-term treatment
study, we found that it took 16 weeks for the Standard Regimen
and 12 weeks for Enhanced Standard Regimen to attain culture
negativity in the lungs (Fig. 5a; Supplementary Table 4a).
As in the short-term study, bacterial load in the lungs of mice
treated with PRS Regimen I was significantly less than that of the
Standard Regimen at week 4 (Po0.0001, one-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s
correction;
Fig.
4a,c).
Moreover,
throughout
the
8-week treatment period, lung CFU counts in mice treated with
PRS Regimen I was lower than in mice treated with the Enhanced
Standard Regimen; in both of these regimens, PZA was at the
same dose of 450 mg kg � 1. The time to attain lung culture
negativity for mice treated with PRS Regimen I was 8 weeks, a
much shorter duration than the 16 and 12 weeks of treatment
required for the Standard Regimen and the Enhanced Standard
Regimen, respectively (Fig. 5a; Supplementary Table 4a).
Both PRS Regimen IIA and IIB killed M. tuberculosis at a rate
much faster than the Standard regimen, Enhanced Standard
Regimen, and PRS Regimen I. While treatment with the Standard
Regimen reduced lung burden of M. tuberculosis by 4 logs at week
6 and by 5 logs at week 8, treatment with PRS Regimen II
achieved these levels at week 2 and 3, respectively (Fig. 4c). Thus,
PRS Regimen II is superior to PRS Regimen I, and PRS Regimen I
is significantly better than the Standard Regimen and the
Enhanced Standard Regimen.
The drug dose-efficacy response surface generated for BDQ
and PZA predicts a higher treatment efficacy for PRS Regimen II
with BDQ at 30 mg kg � 1 and PZA at 450 mg kg � 1; this regimen
was designated as PRS Regimen IIC (Fig. 5b; Table 1). Treatment
with PRS Regimen IIC 5 days per week for merely 3 weeks
reduced the number of M. tuberculosis to 1 organism per lung on

 average with 40% of the mice (2 out of 5 mice) culture negative in
their lungs. Daily treatment for 3 weeks led to lung culture
negativity in 80% of the mice (4 out of 5 mice) (Fig. 5a;
Supplementary Table 4a).
PRS regimens rapidly cure mice. To assess relapse after treat-
ment, we held mice for an additional 3 months after the com-
pletion of their antibiotic treatment, at which time they were
killed and their entire lungs and spleens plated for CFU
(Supplementary Table 4b–f). Relapse was defined as the finding of
1 or more CFU in the lung or spleen; however, lung counts alone
would have sufficed to define relapse as all relapsed animals had
at least 1 CFU in the lung, and all of these mice had fewer or no
CFU in the spleen. For the Standard Regimen, it took 16 weeks of
treatment to clear the infection in the lungs and spleen and to
achieve 100% relapse-free cure (Fig. 5c; Supplementary Table 4b).
In contrast, for PRS Regimen I, relapse-free cure was achieved
in 80% of mice (that is, 4 out of 5 mice) after 8 weeks treatment
and 100% of mice after 12-weeks treatment (P ¼ 0.002 versus
Standard Regimen, log rank test) (Fig. 5c; Supplementary

 achieved relapse-free cure in 63% of mice at 3 weeks and 100% at
4 weeks (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 3). Treatment with
PRS Regimen IIC 5 days per week achieved relapse-free cure in
80% of mice at 3 weeks and 100% at 4 weeks (Fig. 5c;
Supplementary Table 4e). Treatment with PRS Regimen IIC daily
further accelerated relapse-free cure, achieving relapse-free cure
in 40% of mice by 2 weeks and 100% by three weeks (Fig. 5c;
Supplementary Table 4f). Thus, compared with the Standard
Regimen, PRS Regimen IIC, when administered at the same
frequency (5 days per week), reduces the duration of treatment
required to achieve 80% relapse-free cure from 12 weeks to
3 weeks and 100% relapse-free cure from 16 weeks to 4 weeks
(Po0.0001 versus Standard Regimen, log rank test), a 75%
reduction in time to relapse-free cure compared with the
Standard Regimen. The difference in time to relapse-free
cure between PRS Regimens I and IIC was highly statistically

In this study, we employed PRS methodology to re-optimize the
doses of two promising TB drug regimens in vivo, and we then
evaluated the optimized regimens using a mouse model of
pulmonary TB. Dose re-optimization by PRS methodology,
as opposed to the conventional approach of dose scaling, can
avoid failures that may occur in transitioning from in vitro to
in vivo studies. Because PRS methodology is output driven, that
is, only the phenotypic response—the final outcome of drug
treatment (CFU of M. tuberculosis in the lung in this case)—is
measured experimentally, it is agnostic to drug mechanism and
such considerations as the metabolic state of the bacteria.
Moreover,
the
experimentally
calibrated
drug
dose-efficacy
response surface automatically allows for drug–drug interactions;
hence, pharmacokinetic studies are not necessary to determine
the optimal drug doses. Thus, this approach describes the optimal
drug doses for achieving the desired endpoint (maximum
efficacy—reflected by the lowest log10 CFU in the lung in this
case) without regard to the biological mechanisms that result in
this outcome.
Both regimens comprised previously approved drugs and the
first regimen (PRS Regimen I) comprised exclusively generic
drugs. Both regimens were markedly more efficacious than the
Standard Regimen in reducing the lung burden of M. tuberculosis.
For example, at four weeks after the start of treatment, mice
treated with PRS Regimen I had 1.3 logs fewer CFU in their lungs
than mice treated with the Standard Regimen, while mice treated
with PRS Regimen IIC had 4.0 logs fewer lung CFU counts
than Standard Regimen-treated mice. Both regimens were also
markedly more efficacious than the Standard Regimen in
achieving relapse-free cure. Whereas the Standard Regimen

 required 12 weeks to achieve 80% relapse-free cure and 16 weeks
to achieve 100% relapse-free cure in our in vivo model, PRS
Regimen I achieved these milestones in 8 and 12 weeks,
respectively, and PRS Regimen IIC in 3 and 4 weeks, respectively.
Thus, compared with the Standard Regimen, PRS Regimens I and
IIC reduced the duration of treatment required to achieve 80%
relapse-free cure by 33 and 75%, respectively, and 100% relapse-
free cure by 25% and 75%, respectively. In addition, as discussed
below, PRS Regimen II achieves lung culture negativity and
relapse-free cure in the mouse model faster than other regimens
shown to accelerate treatment26–29. If our results in mice
extrapolate to humans, PRS Regimen IIC would be expected to
reduce the duration of treatment of TB from 6–8 months, as is
currently the case for the Standard Regimen, to 1½–2 months.
Moreover, as neither PRS Regimen I nor PRS Regimen II includes
INH, RIF, fluoroquinolones or injectable aminoglycosides, these
regimens should allow treatment, with a similar expedited time
frame, of many cases of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB;
defined as TB resistant to INH and RIF) and those cases
of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB; defined as TB
additionally
resistant
to
fluoroquinolones
and
injectable
aminoglycosides) in which susceptibility to PZA is preserved.
As others have done, we compared our PRS regimens to the
Standard Regimen in the mouse model using the conventional
mouse doses. While our PRS regimens were optimized in the
mouse, the Standard Regimen was essentially optimized in
humans and the mouse doses extrapolated from pharmacologic
data. Nevertheless, the Standard Regimen extrapolated pharma-
cologically to mice is an important benchmark that is routinely
used in mouse efficacy studies and provides an important
reference point for comparisons between studies.
PRS Regimen II, in comparison with the Standard Regimen,
reduces the time required to render the lung culture negative and
achieve relapse-free cure by a greater amount (75%) than several
previously reported regimens in the mouse model. For example,
the combination of RIF/PZA/Moxifloxacin reduced the time to
relapse-free cure by 33% (6 months to 4 months)23, and the
combination of INH/PZA/RIF/CLZ by 50% (6 months to
3 months)26. Williams et al. included in their studies a drug
combination of BDQ/PZA/Rifapentine/CLZ that is similar to our
PRS Regimen II in that it shares 3 of the 4 drugs (they used
Rifapentine instead of EMB; in addition, they used a PZA dose of
150 mg kg � 1 rather than 450 mg kg � 1) and observed relapse in
4/15 (27%) mice after 4 weeks treatment and relapse in 0/15 (0%)
mice at 6 weeks22; the regimen was not compared with a standard
regimen. In comparing even very similar regimens, however,
it should be appreciated that because each drug regimen involves
multiple potential positive and negative drug–drug interactions,
that a change of just one drug in a multiple drug regimen
may have a profound impact on efficacy. Rosenthal et al.30

 observed that MXF/PZA (150 mg kg � 1)/Rifapentine cleared
bacteria in the lungs of mice after 2 months of treatment and
reduced the time to relapse-free cure (0% relapse) by 50%
compared with INH/PZA (150 mg kg � 1)/RIF, which required 6
months to achieve relapse-free cure in all of the mice.
So far, our studies in the mouse TB model have explored only
two of the drug combinations that our in vitro PRS study
identified as being substantially more effective than the Standard
Regimen, and in both cases our in vivo mouse studies confirmed
the predictions of our in vitro macrophage studies. However,
while antimicrobial efficacy in macrophages is important and
probably a pre-requisite for efficacy in vivo, the properties of the
drug combinations that make them highly effective in vivo may
differ from the properties that make them effective in macro-
phage cell culture, and it is vitally important to test and optimize
the drug combinations both in vitro and in vivo. For example,
whereas the macrophage cell cultures are bathed in a constant
concentration of antibiotics, it is likely that pharmacokinetics
plays a major role in efficacy in the mouse model and that the
very long half-lives of CLZ and BDQ make them potent
components in the combination cocktails.
All TB drugs can occasionally cause severe adverse effects,
some readily manageable and others not; even when not
manageable, most adverse effects are reversible upon drug
discontinuation. With respect to drug toxicity, the Standard
Regimen comprises three hepatotoxic drugs (INH, RIF, PZA),
three drugs that can cause gastrointestinal intolerance (INH, RIF,
PZA), two drugs that can cause optic neuritis (EMB, INH) and a
drug that can lead to peripheral neuropathy (INH), among other
adverse effects3,31–33. Both PRS regimens share two of these drugs
with the Standard Regimen (EMB, PZA) and also include CLZ,
which can cause gastrointestinal intolerance, prolong the QTc
interval, and result in reversible skin discoloration (bronzing)33.
In addition, PRS Regimen I includes PRO, which can cause
gastrointestinal intolerance and be hepatotoxic33, while PRS
Regimen II includes BDQ, which can prolong the QTc interval
and be hepatotoxic34. All things considered, managing patients
on the PRS regimens should be no more difficult and probably
less difficult than managing patients on the Standard Regimen.
One of the interesting findings in our PRS in vitro studies was
that many of the most promising drug combinations included
CLZ. Although the anti-TB activity of CLZ was identified in the
1950s, it has not featured prominently in TB treatment regimens
because it was initially thought to be poorly active in patients with
TB. However, interest in CLZ has resurfaced consequent to the
challenge of treating MDR- and XDR-TB. A CLZ-containing
regimen (combined with gatifloxacin, EMB, and PZA, and
supplemented with PRO, kanamycin and high-dose INH for an
intensive phase of at least 4 months) was shown both to be highly
effective for treatment of MDR-TB and to allow duration of
therapy for MDR-TB to be shortened from 20 months (or more)
to 9–12 months27. Recent studies in a mouse model of TB have

 shown that addition of CLZ to a first-line regimen provides
more rapid lung sterilization (3 versus 5 months) and shortens
the duration of treatment needed to achieve relapse-free cure
(3 versus 6 months)26. Similarly, addition of CLZ to a second-line
drug regimen in a mouse model of INH-resistant TB also
provided more effective lung sterilization and provided relapse-
free cure after 9 months, whereas in the absence of CLZ,
the mouse lung tissue was not sterilized after 9 months of
treatment28.
As
monotherapy,
CLZ
does
not
show
early
bactericidal activity in mice35 or man29 and it did not
contribute to early bactericidal activity in combination with
other drugs in human studies29. Nevertheless, it is likely that
CLZ is beneficial in combination regimens both because its long
half-life provides sustained antibiotic coverage and because of
synergistic activity with other antibiotics. From the standpoint of
synergistic mechanisms, Williams et al. observed that PZA and
CLZ increased the bactericidal activity of BDQ in their mouse
model of pulmonary TB and hypothesized that BDQ, PZA, and
CLZ may have additive effects through inhibition of ATP
synthesis and that the ATP depleting activity of CLZ and BDQ
could prevent the efflux of pyrazinoic acid22.
In PRS Regimen I, whereas PRO and EMB showed a relatively
flat dose-response relationship, increasing the PZA dose yielded
substantial increases in efficacy. A similar strong dose-response
relationship was demonstrated by Ahmad et al.24 for PZA both as
monotherapy and in combination with RIF, prompting these
authors to suggest clinical studies to evaluate whether the
clinically used dose of PZA should be increased. Although
lower PZA doses of 150–300 mg kg � 1 are more often used in
mouse studies, we found that the 450 mg kg � 1 dose of PZA was
well tolerated by the mice. A surface area-based conversion factor
(‘FDA Guidance for Industry: Estimating the Maximum Safe
Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult
Healthy Volunteers’, available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/
Drugs/.../Guidances/UCM078932.pdf)
predicts
the
mouse
450 mg kg � 1 dose to be equivalent to a 36.6 mg kg � 1 dose for
a 60 kg human, and this dose is only slightly higher than the
clinically recommended dose27, just above the upper end of the
15–30 mg kg � 1 dosing range recommended by the CDC-ATS
guidelines36. Comparison of published PZA PK data in mice and
humans also suggest that the standard 150 mg kg � 1 dose of PZA
in mice yields a lower AUC than a human dose of 30 mg kg � 1. In
humans, an oral PZA dose of 27 mg kg � 1 yielded an AUC of
520 mg h l � 1 in one study37 and in another study a dose of
22–30 mg kg � 1 yielded an AUC of 617–738 mg h l � 1 (ref. 38). In
contrast, an oral PZA dose of 150 mg kg � 1 in BALB/c mice
yielded significantly lower AUCs of 350 mg h l � 1 (ref. 39) and
388 mg h l � 1 (ref. 38). Moreover, PZA doses of 50–60 mg kg � 1
have been used clinically and a systematic review and meta-
analysis determined that higher doses of PZA were not associated
with any dose-dependent increase in hepatotoxicity40. Indeed, the
concerns over PZA related hepatotoxicity have been in the setting
in which it is used in the Standard Regimen in combination with
the hepatotoxic drugs INH and RIF; thus, the Enhanced Standard
Regimen tested in our mouse studies, where the PZA dose was
substantially increased compared with the pharmacologically
equivalent human dose and which showed improved efficacy
compared with the Standard Regimen in the mouse, is not likely
to extrapolate safely to humans. In contrast, PRS Regimens I and
II do not include these additional two hepatotoxic drugs, making
it possible to safely administer a substantially higher dose of PZA.
While higher doses of PZA in the setting of PRS Regimens I and
II could be associated with an increase in other side effects such as
arthralgias and elevated uric acid levels, these are likely to be
manageable and the shorter course of therapy would likely reduce
the incidence of serious adverse events. Of note, however, while
the higher dose of PZA may be ideal, for both PRS Regimens I
and II, our drug dose-efficacy response surface model indicates
that lower doses of PZA can be used without significantly
compromising efficacy.
Our previous in vitro PRS studies employed PRO rather than
ethionamide
(ETA)
because,
although
the
two
drugs
are
considered interchangeable, PRO has been found to outperform
ETA in a clinical trial of leprosy and to be better tolerated than
ETA (ref. 33). Nevertheless, we anticipate that ETA could replace
PRO in our PRS regimens without loss of efficacy.
PRS I Regimen I (CLZ/EMB/PRO/PZA) has the advantage of
being inexpensive and these drugs are readily available on the
formulary in most countries. On the basis of our mouse studies,
we predict that PRS Regimen II (CLZ/EMB/BDQ/PZA) will
provide even more rapid bacterial clearance in the tissues and will
achieve relapse-free cure even sooner.
Whether our mouse model will accurately predict the results in
humans remains to be determined. There are reasons why the
model may overestimate or underestimate the efficacy of various
drug combinations. As others have noted22, some differences
between TB in mouse and human could lead the BALB/c model
to overestimate the clinical efficacy of BDQ and CLZ. For
example, unlike humans, the BALB/c mouse does not develop
cavitary
disease
and
the
bacteria
are
almost
exclusively
intracellular. Since CLZ and BDQ are very hydrophobic, they
become concentrated intracellularly and might be less effective
against extracellular TB (ref. 22). Consistent with this, Irwin
et al.41 recently observed that CLZ showed much greater TB
killing activity in BALB/c mice than in C3HeB/FeJ mice that
develop caseous necrosis with numerous extracellular TB. It is
possible that the duration of treatment may require adjustment
depending on the presence or absence of cavitary disease. On the
other hand, the mouse, which does not develop as strong a
cell-mediated immune response as humans, as reflected by less
organized granulomata and relatively weak cutaneous delayed-
type hypersensitivity responses42, may underestimate the clinical
efficacy of drugs at achieving relapse-free cure. Our studies
indicate that as few as 1 or 2 bacteria remaining in the lung at the
cessation of treatment are sufficient to allow relapse in our mouse
model.
Our studies demonstrate that systematic in vitro and in vivo
PRS methodology can identify and optimize drug combinations
for treatment of TB that are substantially more effective than the
current Standard Regimen. Expanding the PRS methodology to
additional drug combinations, including some of the newly
developed drugs, has the potential to identify combinations that
are even more potent.
Methods
Aerosol infection. Eight-week old, female, pathogen-free BALB/c mice were
obtained from Taconic, housed in groups of five, and provided with unlimited
access to food and water. Mice were challenged by aerosol with the highly virulent
M. tuberculosis Erdman strain (ATCC 35801). One day later, two mice were killed
to determine the initial number of CFU implanted in their lungs. After two weeks,
three mice were killed to determine the number of CFU in the lungs at the start of
treatment.
Drug treatment. Two weeks after infection, mice were treated by oral gavage
five times per week (Monday—Friday) for 3–24 weeks, or sometimes daily
for 2–3 weeks. Mice under treatment with the Standard Regimen were first
administered EMB, INH, and PZA together in 0.1 ml of 0.15% agarose suspension,
and 1 h later administered RIF in water. Mice under treatment with PRS regimens
were first administered CLZ alone in 0.1 ml of 0.15% agarose suspension and
1 h later administered EMB/PRO/PZA (PRS Regimen I) or EMB/BDQ/PZA
(PRS Regimen II) together in 0.1 ml 0.15% agarose suspension. Sham-treated mice
were first administered agarose suspension and 1 h later administered water. CLZ,
EMB, INH, PRO, RIF and PZA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. BDQ was
provided by the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development. Drug doses used in this
study are listed in Table 1.

 Assessment of treatment bactericidal activity. Mice were killed three days after
the last treatment dose. Their lung, liver and spleen were homogenized in 1 ml of
phosphate-buffered saline. The homogenates were serially diluted and spread
100 ml per plate on 7H11 agar containing 0.4% activated charcoal, ampicillin
(12.5 mg ml � 1), amphotericin (5 mg ml � 1) and polymyxin B (20 U ml � 1). The
plates were incubated at 37 �C in a 5% CO2–95% air atmosphere for 31 days, after
which the number of CFU of M. tuberculosis on each plate was enumerated. The
limit of detection for CFU ranged from 4.4 to 5 organisms per lung depending on
the total volume of lung homogenate from each animal. When no organism was
detected on any of the plates, the CFU per lung was plotted as half of the limit of
detection. When only a single colony was detected on all of the plates, the CFU per
lung was plotted as the limit of detection.
Assessment of relapse. Mice were held for 3 months after the last treatment;
killed; the lung and spleen homogenized; and the entire homogenate plated on 60
(20 for each lung and 40 for each spleen) charcoal 7H11 agar plates. CFU on the
plates was determined after incubation for 31 days at 37 �C in a 5% CO2–95% air
atmosphere. The absence of a single CFU in the entire lungs of mice 3 months after
treatment cessation was considered relapse-free cure.
Animal studies. All animal studies were approved and conducted in accordance with
the procedures as set forth by the UCLA Animal Research Committee. The BALB/c
mouse strain was used as this is the established model for studies of the efficacy of
multidrug TB regimens10,22,23,26,28,30,35,43–46. Experience has shown that the results of
multidrug efficacy studies in the mouse model of pulmonary tuberculosis are generally,
albeit not perfectly, predictive of their efficacy in humans10–12.
Parabolic drug dose-efficacy response surface. In a previous study8, we
identified highly promising drug combinations for killing M. tuberculosis in human
macrophages. Here, we evaluate two of these combinations (PRS Regimens I and
II), each consisting of 4 drugs, in vivo in the mouse model of pulmonary
tuberculosis. To transition from in vitro to in vivo studies, we first needed to
identify the optimal doses of these drugs in each PRS regimen in vivo. This was
accomplished using PRS methodology8, which in essence describes the relationship
between a phenotypic response in animals (the output measurement, in this case
the lung burden of M. tuberculosis) and doses of different drugs used to effect this
phenotypic response. Based upon our previous findings in multiple complex
biological settings, including in vitro studies involving eukaryotic cells, in vivo
studies, and clinical studies17–19,47–49, the relationship between the phenotypic
response and the doses of drugs used to effect the phenotypic response fits a
parabolic response surface (sometimes referred to herein as the drug dose-efficacy
response surface). Such a surface can be described by a second order algebraic
(quadratic) equation (see below), as opposed to much more complex surfaces
requiring, for example, third and fourth order algebraic equations to describe them.
A major advantage of the PRS approach is that a relatively small number of tests is
required to determine the coefficients of the second order algebraic equation and
thus define the parabolic response surface. In the current study, the drug
combinations each contained 4 drugs; ordinarily the second order algebraic
equation for four drugs would have 15 coefficients, which can be determined by
15 tests (or in this case groups of animals receiving different drug-dose
combinations). By keeping the dose of one drug (CLZ) in each combination
constant, we reduced the number of tests required to 10, the number of coefficients
in the second order algebraic equation for 3 drugs; this allowed substantial savings
in cost, labour, and time. Thus, only 10 groups of animals, where each group was
treated with a different dose ratio of the three drugs, were needed to map out the
drug-dose efficacy response surface. We chose CLZ as the drug to be kept at a
constant dose because CLZ has an extraordinarily long half-life35. Moreover,
Swanson et al. have recently shown in a mouse model of TB that CLZ exhibits a
threshold effect, such that differences in CLZ concentrations in the blood and
tissues do not translate into dose-dependent differences in antimicrobial activity35.
Specifically, in this study, the lung burden of M. tuberculosis (log10 CFU) in
mice after treatment with PRS Regimen I or II drugs at various drug doses was used
to generate the second-order (parabolic) algebraic model using MATLAB
LinearModel.stepwise function (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA); and the correlation
between experimental and modelled log10 CFU was determined using the
MATLAB linear or rank correlation function. The parabolic response surface is
expressed as:
y ¼ b0 þ b1x1 þ . . . þ bnxn þ b12x1x2 þ . . . þ bmnxmxn þ b11x2
1 þ . . . þ bnnx2
n þ e;
ð1Þ
where y represents the log CFU; xn is the nth drug dosage; b0 is the intercept term;
bn is the single drug coefficient of the nth drug; bmn is the interaction coefficient
between the mth and nth drugs; bnn is the quadratic coefficient for the nth drug;
and e is the residual error assumed to have a normal distribution with constant
s.d. ¼ se.
As noted above, in determining the parabolic response surface, by keeping the
dose of one drug in the combination constant, we reduced the number of unknown
coefficients (bs) in equation (1) above to 10. Therefore, in this study, n ¼ 3 in
equation (1). We applied the Orthogonal Array Composite Designs (OACD)
method to place the 10 drug-dose combinations (experimental groups) at strategic
positions for locating the most accurate parabolic response surface15,16. This was
done by selecting high (H), medium (M) and low (L) drug doses of each drug and
ensuring that each pair of conditions (for example, HH, HM, HL, MH, MM, ML,
LH, LM and LL) for any two drugs occurred equally often for all of the drug pairs
in the combinations being tested. The use of an orthogonal array test design to map
the parabolic response surface allowed us to maximize our coverage of the drug
dose-efficacy response surface, while minimizing the number of combinations to be
tested.
A parabolic regression model was fit to the log10 CFU data using equation (1)
above, giving the expected log10 CFU as a function of the drug dose combinations.
For every observed log10 CFU, a corresponding predicted log10 CFU value was
generated by this equation. The residual errors (e) were defined as the difference
between the observed log10 CFU and the predicted log10 CFU (e ¼ observed log10
CFU—predicted log10 CFU). A normal quantile plot of the residual errors
confirmed that they followed a normal distribution.
In determining the final parabolic response surface, we removed non-significant
terms from the original 10 term equation using a stepwise hierarchical removal
rule50 and a p o0.05 term retention criterion. For PRS Regimen I, the parabolic
drug dose-efficacy response surface determined from the lung log10 CFU data is
given in equation (2), below:
Log10CFU ¼3:3633 þ 0:0017925

where EMB, PRO and PZA represent the dose of EMB, PRO and PZA, respectively,

For PRS Regimen II, the parabolic drug dose-efficacy response surface
determined from the lung log10 CFU data is given in equation (3), below:
Log10CFU ¼2:7846 � 0:13892

where BDQ and PZA represent the dose of BDQ and PZA, respectively, in

Once the parabolic drug dose-efficacy response surface was obtained from the
experimental data, the optimal drug doses were derived as those giving the lowest
projected mean number of M. tuberculosis (log10 CFU) in the mouse lung.
Statistics. On the basis of previous studies10,28 showing that mean differences in
log10 CFU were 2 s.d. or larger, we chose a sample size of 5 mice per group as it
provided 80% power to confirm mean differences of 2 s.d. or larger using the
Po0.05 significance criterion. Per cent relapse versus treatment time were
compared across groups using the log rank test since this data did not follow the
normal distribution and most observations were censored (that is the animal did
not relapse). Means and s.e. of the mean (s.e.m.) are reported. Data collected from
the animal studies were analysed using GraphPad Prism software (version 6.05).
Means were compared across groups by ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for
multiple comparisons. Levene’s test was used to assess error homoscedasticity for
both the parabolic model and the ANOVA.
Additional statistical analyses of the parabolic drug dose-efficacy response
surface model are described in the preceding section entitled Parabolic drug
dose-efficacy response surface.
