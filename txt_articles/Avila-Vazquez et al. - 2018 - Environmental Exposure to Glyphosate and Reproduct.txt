Abstract 
Argentina annually utilizes 240,000 tones of glyphosate in industrial agricul-
ture and a change in the profile of morbidity is perceived for physicians of 
agricultural areas; now reproductive disorders seem to prevail. The objective 
of this study is to determine concurrence of glyphosate exposure and repro-
ductive disorders in a typical argentine agricultural town (Monte Maíz). An 
ecological study was developed with an environmental analysis of pollution 
sources including measurements of glyphosate and other pesticides and a 
cross-sectional study of spontaneous abortions and congenital abnormalities 
prevalence. Glyphosate was detected in soil and grain dust and was found to 
be at an even higher concentration in the village soil than in the rural area; 
650 tonnes of glyphosate are used annually in the region and manipulated in-
ner town contaminating the soil and dust in suspension of the town creating 
an burden of environmental exposure to glyphosate of 79 kg per person per 
year. We do not find other relevant sources of pollution. The spontaneous 
abortion and congenital abnormalities rates are three and two times higher 
than the national average reported by the national health (10% vs. 3% and 3% 
- 4.3% vs 1.4% respectively). Our study verified high environmental exposure 
to glyphosate in association with increased frequencies of reproductive dis-
orders (spontaneous abortion and congenital abnormalities) in argentine 
agricultural village, but is unable to make assertions cause-effect. Further stu-
dies are required with designs for such purposes.

1. Introduction 
In 1996, Argentina began to grow genetically modified (GM) seeds, and used 
currently 25 million hectares where 12 million people live; these crops have gen-
erated a substantial increase in the pesticide consumption. In 2013, Argentina 
sprayed 240,000 tons of Glyphosate [1] [2]. A change in the profile of morbidity 
and mortality is perceived for physicians of agricultural areas; now reproductive 
disorders and cancer seem to prevail [3] and recently the International Federa-
tion of Gynecology and Obstetrics expressed concern about reproductive health 
impacts of exposure to toxic environmental chemical [4]. Monte Maíz town 
(Union District in Province of Cordoba) lies at the heart of Argentina’s agricul-
tural area, the region of greater agricultural productivity in the country, where 
soy, maize, and wheat are grown in the centre of the country. In recent years, 
local governmental authorities along with local residents and doctors were wor-
ried about an increase apparent in the number of spontaneous abortions, conge-
nital abnormalities and cancer, thus requesting an assessment of health status to 
the Faculty of Medical Sciences, National University of Cordoba (UNC). The 
community had conducted a health census in 2007 (unpublished), carried out by 
teachers and other volunteers, in which high rates of spontaneous abortions and 
cancer were identified. There are few epidemiological studies on the environ-
mental health of rural populations in Argentina and very little has been pub-
lished to date. The objective of this study is the Monte Maíz environmental con-
tamination recorded, mainly the presence of glyphosate and other pesticides and 
checking whether spontaneous abortions prevalence and congenital abnormali-
ties prevalence were increased. It was our goal to verify concurrence of glypho-
sate environmental exposure and those reproductive disorders; cancer rates were 
also measured and this outcome has already been recently published by the au-
thors [5]. 
2. Material and Methods  
An exploratory ecological study on reproductive disorders and environmental 
pollution was performed, consisting on the one hand of an epidemiological 
study (a cross-sectional study) with a household survey of health addressed to 
the entire population (population survey), designed to geo-reference each record 
in the village with use of nine ratios census (R) by National Institute Census that 
divide the town into nine sectors outweighed demographically as seen in the 
map of Figure 1
Figure 1. Through the household survey, we checked spontaneous abor-
tions prevalence (women aged between 15 and 45 years old who have suffered

spontaneous or unexplained abortion on the last 5 years and with 5 or more 
years of living in Monte Maíz) and congenital abnormalities prevalence (child-
ren with major congenital abnormalities alive at the time of the interview), these 
were dependent variables, while sex, age, occupation, stay in the village, smoke, 
ratio census residence, educational level and the presence of environmental con-
taminants were the independent variables. On the other hand, an environmental 
analysis recording sources of contamination such as landfills, cell site (cell 
tower), electric power transformers, industrial sites, stockpiles of grains, store-
houses of pesticides, and spraying machines. We interviewed community and 
government stakeholders, business owners, city officials, teachers, farmers and 
workers that sprayed pesticides, in order to recognize the performance of indus-
tries, local public services, and agribusiness (drinking water, sewer management, 
household waste, industries pollutions, routines and doses of pesticides use). 
Samples of environmental matrices (water, soil, grain husks) were collected and 
analyzed by the Center for Environmental Research, Faculty of Exact Sciences of 
National University of La Plata, which selected twelve internal and peripheral 
sites in the town to examine the presence of glyphosate, its metabolite amino-
methylphosphonic acid (AMPA), and currently used pesticides (chlorpyrifos, 
endosulfan, cipermetrina, atrazine, 2.4D, and epoxiconazole). Both pretreatment 
and analysis of pesticides were performed under international regulations using 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry [6] [7]. A dosage of arsenic (As) was 
conducted in domestic water network using hydride generation atomic absorp-

tion spectrometry. 
The study area was Monte Maíz, a town located on Provincial Route N˚11', 
33˚12' South latitude and 62˚36' West longitude of Greenwich, at a height above 
sea level of 114 metres; the town is 113 years old and has 7788 inhabitants (8045 
including residents of surrounding rural areas). Agriculture is the main eco-
nomic activity with complementary metalworking industry that is located on the 
Southern edge of the town [8]. 
2.1. Statistical Analysis  
Crude rates were obtained through a database and numerical matrix, a bivariate 
correlation Pearson analysis was conducted to assess the association of sponta-
neous abortions and congenital abnormalities with independent variables, in-
cluded the spatial distribution according to ratios census in which the town was 
divided (R09-R18). We built maps for spontaneous abortions and congenital 
abnormalities and pollution sources using Quantum GIS 2.4 software and 
created contingency tables to perform relational measurements between expo-
sure and disease. For this end, the following software was used: INFOSTAT 
(UNC), SPSS, and EPIDAT (PAHO). Rates of spontaneous abortions and con-
genital abnormalities of Monte Maíz were compared with the national rates re-
ported by the National Registry of Congenital Abnormalities (RENAC) of the 
National Health Ministry [9]. 
2.2. Study Conduct 
Physicians or medical students carried out the fieldwork during October 2014; 
all health surveys were conducted by final year medicine students of UNC and 
medical professors. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration 
of Helsinki and under the framework of Act 9694 Article 2 of the Province of 
Cordoba in accordance with the law regulating health research and was ap-
proved by the Bioethics Committee established by this law for observational stu-
dies [10]. All surveys were performed after obtaining informed consent.  
3. Results  
3.1. Environmental Analysis 
In Monte Maíz the electrical network is powered by medium-voltage power dis-
tributed in the urban area, with substations of 33 kV to 380 w, no high voltage. 
Has a sewer system with a domestic collection network reaching every home; 
solid urban waste is collected by a municipal service that has a Solid Waste plant. 
Their hinterland has soybeans on 45,000 ha and maize on 20,000 ha which are 
main summer crops and wheat on 15,000 ha as a winter crop. We identified an 
open landfill, 800 meters northeast of the town’s limit, with no evidence of fire 
in the last 5 years. There is an absence of forestry across the periphery of the 
town, which is replaced by soybean and maize crops, starting at the immediate 
edge of houses. These crops are frequently treated, with pesticide, by ground

equipment and crop dusters. At the southwest of Monte Maíz, we found two li-
vestock breeding farms, and, on the west side, a flood zone, with ponds, a park, 
and a sewage treatment plant between the crop fields. 
There are two farm equipment industries, located at the southern tip of the 
town; these factories use methane gas as a source of energy. The sources of elec-
tromagnetic radiation were two cellphone towers, located in R9 and R12 which 
are highlighted on the map of pollution factors on Monte Maíz in Figure 2
Figure 2 
(there are two other towers located outside of the urban area). The population of 
Monte Maíz receives drinking water of very good quality, drinkable and arsen-
ic-free. Within the inhabited village, there are silos of cereal from where soy and 
corn husks are released (grain dust) shown on the map in Figure 2
Figure 2 and were 
identified twenty-two deposits for spraying machines and pesticide containers 
used in the region.  
Local agronomists and agrochemical applicators report that in Monte Maíz 
GM soybean and corn crops use 10 kilograms of glyphosate per ha per year. Six 
hundred and fifty tonnes of glyphosate are aerosolized in the area, creating a 
general burden of environmental exposure to glyphosate of 79 kg per person per 
year, which varies for agricultural or non-agricultural activity and for spatial 
distribution of glyphosate. This region utilizes nine hundred seventy five tonnes 
of all pesticides each year.

3.2. Chemical Contaminants Test 
Herbicide glyphosate and AMPA was detected in 100% samples of soil and husk. 
In grain husks from silos, glyphosate and AMPA prevailed (505 and 607 ppb), 
followed by chlorpyrifos (14 ppb) and epoxiconazole (2.3 ppb) as shown in Ta-
a-
ble
ble 1. Sampling site N˚6 (map in Figure 2
Figure 2), belonging to a children’s play-
ground, contained 68 times more glyphosate than site N˚5, belonging to a farm 
field of resistant to glyphosate corn. Similarly, site N˚8, where the soil sample 
was taken from the sidewalk next to pesticides deposits, had the highest concen-
tration of glyphosate (3868 ppb), AMPA (3192 ppb), and all pesticides. 
Glyphosate also had the highest concentrations among all the matrices studied 
(3868 ppb), exceeding by far the other pesticides: endosulfan II (337.7 ppb) and 
chlorpyrifos (242 ppb) (see Table 1
Table 1). There were minimal concentrations of pes-
ticides in drinking water; also, the arsenic in drinking water was less than 5 ppb.  
3.3. Epidemiological Analysis 
Overall, 92% households were visited, 4.8% corresponds to households that re-
fused to answer the survey. Some houses were uninhabited at the time of the vis-
it. The information was collected from 4859 people (62% of the population), its 
characteristics are available in Table 2
Table 2.  
98 spontaneous abortions occurred in the last 5 years among 981 surveyed 
women of reproductive age; 62 of them had only one event, 15 had two, and 2 of 
them had three abortions, a unintended abortions prevalence rate of 10% per 
100 women of reproductive age; 79 women among 981 were those who suffered 
spontaneous abortions (8%). 
Among the population studied there were 853 births in the last 10 years, 25 
children presented major congenital abnormalities and were alive at the time of 
the study (four abnormalities of nervous system, five genitals, four limbs, three 
renal and urinary, two digestive, four cardiopathies and one biliary atresia, 
cleft lip and thyroglossal cyst), a prevalence rate of 3% (Table 3
Table 3), not including

malformed children who died during this period. Including the dead (calculated 
in twelve cases) the rate of congenital anomalies would reach 4.3% because the 
WHO estimates a congenital anomalies mortality of 40% in ten years [11]. 
Spontaneous abortions shown correlate with young women and women living 
in R16 and R17 with a significance of 0.05%, these radiuses (R) are the ones 
blown by the wind coming from where are the cereal stores. Congenital abnor-
malities showed no significant correlation with independent variables. 
Association levels were measured as occurrence rate (ORs) arising from con-
tingency tables (2 × 2); the OR for spontaneous abortions in women from Ra-
dius 16 and Radius 17 with respect to other Radius was 1.29 (CI 0.71 - 2.34) with 
a non significant p-value, so that despite the existence of apparent risk of abor-
tion in those areas, the presence of bias could not be excluded. 
4. Comments 
Seeds that are genetically manipulated to contain a transgene have the ability to 
survive in saturated environments with glyphosate, an herbicide used to eradi-
cate other plants. Glyphosate interferes with the vital metabolism of plants, but 
not with transgenic plants for which an alternative metabolic pathway was gen-
erated through bioengineering. Since 1996, when GM soy was introduced in Ar-
gentina, its use has continued to expand due to the high profit generated by its

commercialization and easy harvest [12] as the extension of this crop increases, 
so does the use of glyphosate. Currently, Argentina is using 240,000 tons of gly-
phosate per year. This has increased year-on-year as a consequence of herbi-
cide-resistant weeds requiring higher doses of glyphosate and the combined use 
of other herbicides as 2.4D, atrazine, etc. [13]. This increase has resulted in 5 kg 
of glyphosate per person per year as potential exposure burden for all inhabi-
tants of the country, greater in agricultural areas. 
Monte Maíz shows the effects of this agricultural model, as is a production 
boom in the region, a high standard of living among its population, and the re-
location of local farmers  in the village; these farmers left rural areas and moved 
with their families work equipment and supplies. Deposits of agricultural 
equipment are multiplying inside the village (twenty-two in total), the largest 
deposits in town are in R15 and are five pesticide storage sites. A total of 650 
tons of glyphosate per year is concentrated, manipulated and has surrounded the 
town, which now faces fields that are sprayed daily. Glyphosate was found in 
100% of soil and husk dust samples, the concentration was 10 times higher than 
that of other pesticides, this demonstrates that, of all pesticides that pollute the 
environment, glyphosate is the most prevalent. Concentrations found in inner 
town are several times higher than in the soil in cultivated fields (see Table 1
able 1), 
reaffirming the impression that the town is at the operational center of the 
sprayed area. Glyphosate is also high in grain dust, it is also accompanied by 
other pesticides their joint presence discards that glyphosate is high within the 
village due to its use in gardening. 
In metalwork factories, no significant pollution was found; the density per 
km2 of the source of electromagnetic radiation such as cell site, high voltage 
power lines, and electrical voltage transformers is low compared with source 
electromagnetic radiation density in big cities, which minimizes the value of this 
pollution;  for example Nueva Cordoba, a neighborhood of Cordoba city, 
which is located on the same surface as Monte Maíz with a larger population, 
has nine cell sites, while there are only two towers in Monte Maíz [14], although, 
a weakness of the study is the lack of electromagnetic radiation direct measure-
ments.  
Moreover, household garbage management, sewage, and contaminant-free 
water (for 16 years now) remove these contaminating factors from the observed 
pathologies. Thus, pollution with glyphosate and to a lesser extent with other 
pesticides is the predominant factor in the environmental contamination analy-
sis of Monte Maíz. 
The rate of spontaneous abortions in five years (10%) in Monte Maíz was 
three times higher than that reported in a national analysis conducted in 2005 
for the National Health Ministry (0.6% per year) [15], and also higher than that 
of a social-health survey recently conducted (2016) by our team in a neighbour-
hood of Cordoba where the prevalence of spontaneous abortions was 3.7% in 5 
years [16]. The spatial distribution of abortions shows a backlog of cases in the 
sector (R16 and R17) that is most contaminated with glyphosate-impregnated

grain husk, although the association is not significant. This increased prevalence 
is consistent with the findings of Aiassa et al. that detected a spontaneous abor-
tions rate of 19% between 166 households in the farming village of Las Ver-
tientes (Cordoba, 180 km from Monte Maiz) [17]. The “Ontario Farm Family 
Health Study” refers 18.7% of spontaneous abortions rate in farm families with a 
significant risk for preconception exposure to glyphosate [18]. In our population 
young mothers were linked to this perinatal outcome and not the other way 
round; smoking was not linked to abortion either. The population is not inbred 
(it is a large town made up of farmers and steelworkers) and its social structure 
shows an excellent socioeconomic status measured in rate of unmet basic needs. 
Neither maternal age, toxic habits or poverty may explain the high rate of spon-
taneous abortions in Monte Maiz.  
There seems to be a clear link between exposure to pesticides, including gly-
phosate, and pregnancy loss, similar to the observations made by Settini in Italy 
[19], or the systematic reviews of evidence-based medicine of Sanborn et al. in 
MacMaster University, Canada, in 2007 [20] and updated in 2012 [21]. 
On the other hand, the National Registry of Congenital Abnormalities of Ar-
gentina (RENAC) in 2014 Report that between 281.249 newborns a total of 4.120 
major structural congenital abnormalities were recorded, with a prevalence of 
1.4% [9]; in Monte Maiz the prevalence (3%) was twice that of the national pre-
valence (see Table
Table 3). It is worth mentioning that our data does not include 
malformed children who died, which is why the difference could surely be even 
greater. The types of congenital anomalies do not differ significantly from those 
reported by the RENAC for the entire Province [9]. The national rate of anoma-
lies is generated from monthly reports issued by the neonatology services, there 
may be underreporting of cases. By contrast, our data may be biased due to the 
fact that they are self-referenced, and while this is a limiting factor for any study 
of disease through surveys, it is unlikely in some less prevalent pathology where, 
on the contrary, the most common error is type II. Data collected differently 
may reflect discrepancies, thus generating an information bias. In any case, the 
higher frequency of children born with congenital abnormalities in populations 
exposed to agrochemicals is described for records from maternity hospitals [22], 
case control [23] [24], american ecological studies [25] [26], and canadian sys-
tematic reviews [21], among others. 
In 2010 Paganelli demonstrates as glyphosate-based herbicides produce tera-
togenic effects on vertebrates by impairing retinoic acid signaling [27] and in 
recent years information on glyphosate genotoxicity in experimental models was 
published, information that was previously unknown, using test for chromo-
somal aberrations, micronuclei and comet assay the damage to DNA strands was 
verified [28] [29] even in human cells [30] [31]. More recently, these same stu-
dies were conducted in people environmentally and occupationally exposed to 
pesticides in general and glyphosate in particular, which reported rates of genetic 
damage well above those found in populations not exposed to pesticides used as 
reference or control groups [32] [33].

The Monograph Working Group of IARC-WHO in Evaluation of Carcino-
genic Risks to Humans in 2015 reviews 1000 studies on glyphosate and chooses 
200 relevant paper to conclude that there is strong evidence that exposure to 
glyphosate or glyphosate-based formulations is genotoxic based on studies in 
humans in vitro and studies in experimental animals [34], the occurrence of 
damage to the DNA strands that when not repaired nor the cell removed can 
lead to germ cell mutations with impact on reproductive health. Near Monte 
Maíz, in Marcos Juarez City, published studies showed twice frequency of 
chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei in environmentally exposed people to 
glyphosate or other pesticides [35] and genotoxicity in children exposed to pes-
ticides comparing to not expose [36].  
This association is consistent with respect to abortions and malformations, the 
biological plausibility is very rational for reproductive problems in their causal 
link with 600,000 kg of glyphosate polluting the environment of Monte Maiz, 
although recognize that the ecological fallacy cannot be discarded from this 
analysis and the design of this study is limited for causality. The change in time 
sequence could not be stated in this cross-sectional study, but local doctors 
noted changes in the disease profile since the introduction of GM seeds and the 
massive use of glyphosate. Although the methodological limitations of this ex-
ploration suggest that we acknowledge its limited scope, it highlights the associ-
ation at an evidence level and should be considered with caution given the small 
size of the population, the self-referenced nature of the survey and the descrip-
tive modality of the study. The results of this study are also important because 
they describe a health problem in the environment where the people are living. 
5. Conclusion  
This research detected an urban environment severely polluted by glyphosate 
and other pesticides with high environmental exposure to glyphosate in the vil-
lagers and identified elevated frequencies of congenital abnormalities and spon-
taneous abortion, suggesting a link between environmental exposure to glypho-
sate and reproductive problems, although this was an exploratory and observa-
tional design unable to make direct causal assertions. However, from the point 
of view of collective health, this link requires recommending the precautionary 
application of measures to protect the population from this environmental ex-
posure.
