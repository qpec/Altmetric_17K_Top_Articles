abstract
Approximately 3500 infants die annually in the United States from sleep-
related infant deaths, including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS; 
International Classifi
 cation of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10], R95), ill-
defi
 ned deaths (ICD-10 R99), and accidental suffocation and strangulation 
in bed (ICD-10 W75). After an initial decrease in the 1990s, the overall death 
rate attributable to sleep-related infant deaths has not declined in more 
recent years. Many of the modifi
 able and nonmodifi
 able risk factors for SIDS 
and other sleep-related infant deaths are strikingly similar. The American 
Academy of Pediatrics recommends a safe sleep environment that can 
reduce the risk of all sleep-related infant deaths. Recommendations for a 
safe sleep environment include supine positioning, the use of a fi
 rm sleep 
surface, room-sharing without bed-sharing, and the avoidance of soft 
bedding and overheating. Additional recommendations for SIDS reduction 
include the avoidance of exposure to smoke, alcohol, and illicit drugs; 
breastfeeding; routine immunization; and use of a pacifi
 er. New evidence 
is presented for skin-to-skin care for newborn infants, use of bedside and 
in-bed sleepers, sleeping on couches/armchairs and in sitting devices, 
and use of soft bedding after 4 months of age. The recommendations and 
strength of evidence for each recommendation are included in this policy 
statement. The rationale for these recommendations is discussed in detail 
in the accompanying technical report (www. 
pediatrics.

(including sudden infant death 
syndrome [SIDS] and ill-defined 
deaths), occurring during infancy. 
After case investigation, SUID can be 
attributed to suffocation, asphyxia, 
entrapment, infection, ingestions, 
metabolic diseases, arrhythmia-
associated cardiac channelopathies, 
and trauma (unintentional or 
nonaccidental). SIDS is a subcategory 
of SUID and is a cause assigned 
to infant deaths that cannot be 
explained after a thorough case 
investigation, including a scene 
investigation, autopsy, and review 
of the clinical history. 
1 (See  
Table 
1 for definitions of terms.) The 
distinction between SIDS and other 
SUIDs, particularly those that occur 
during an unobserved sleep period 
(sleep-related infant deaths), such 
as unintentional suffocation, is 
challenging, cannot be determined 
by autopsy alone, and may remain 
unresolved after a full case 
investigation. Many of the modifiable 
and nonmodifiable risk factors for 
SIDS and suffocation are strikingly 
similar. This document focuses on 
the subset of SUIDs that occur during 
sleep.
The recommendations outlined 
herein were developed to reduce 
the risk of SIDS and sleep-
related suffocation, asphyxia, and 
entrapment among infants in the 
general population. As defined 
by epidemiologists, risk refers to 
the probability that an outcome 
will occur given the presence of a 
particular factor or set of factors. 
Although all 19 recommendations 
are intended for all who care for 
infants, the last 4 recommendations 
also are directed toward health 
policy makers, researchers, and 
professionals who care for or work 
on behalf of infants. In addition, 
because certain behaviors, such as 
smoking, can increase risk for the 
infant, some recommendations are 
directed toward women who are 
pregnant or may become pregnant in 
the near future.
 
Table 2 summarizes each 
recommendation and provides the 
strength of the recommendation, 
which is based on the Strength-of-
Recommendation Taxonomy. 
2 It 
should be noted that there are no 
randomized controlled trials with 
regard to SIDS and other sleep-
related deaths; instead, case-control 
studies are the standard.
The recommendations are based on 
epidemiologic studies that include 
infants up to 1 year of age. Therefore, 
recommendations for sleep position 
and the sleep environment, unless 
otherwise specified, are for the 
first year after birth. The evidence-
based recommendations that

TABLE 2  
Summary of Recommendations With Strength of Recommendation
A-level recommendations
 Back to sleep for every sleep.
 Use a fi
 rm sleep surface.
 Breastfeeding is recommended.
 Room-sharing with the infant on a separate sleep surface is recommended.
 Keep soft objects and loose bedding away from the infant’s sleep area.
 Consider offering a pacifi
 er at naptime and bedtime.
 Avoid smoke exposure during pregnancy and after birth.
 Avoid alcohol and illicit drug use during pregnancy and after birth.
 Avoid overheating.
 Pregnant women should seek and obtain regular prenatal care.
 Infants should be immunized in accordance with AAP and CDC recommendations.
 Do not use home cardiorespiratory monitors as a strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS.
 Health care providers, staff in newborn nurseries and NICUs, and child care providers should endorse 
and model the SIDS risk-reduction recommendations from birth.
 Media and manufacturers should follow safe sleep guidelines in their messaging and advertising.
 Continue the “Safe to Sleep” campaign, focusing on ways to reduce the risk of all sleep-related infant 
deaths, including SIDS, suffocation, and other unintentional deaths. Pediatricians and other primary 
care providers should actively participate in this campaign.
B-level recommendations
 Avoid the use of commercial devices that are inconsistent with safe sleep recommendations.
 Supervised, awake tummy time is recommended to facilitate development and to minimize 
development of positional plagiocephaly.
C-level recommendations
 Continue research and surveillance on the risk factors, causes, and pathophysiologic mechanisms 
of SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths, with the ultimate goal of eliminating these deaths 
entirely.
 There is no evidence to recommend swaddling as a strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS.
The following levels are based on the Strength-of-Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) for the assignment of letter grades 
to each of its recommendations (A, B, or C). 
2 Level A: There is good-quality patient-oriented evidence. Level B: There is 
inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence. Level C: The recommendation is based on consensus, disease-
oriented evidence, usual practice, expert opinion, or case series for studies of diagnosis, treatment, prevention, or 
screening. Note: “patient-oriented evidence” measures outcomes that matter to patients: morbidity, mortality, symptom 
improvement, cost reduction, and quality of life; “disease-oriented evidence” measures immediate, physiologic, or 
surrogate end points that may or may not refl
 ect improvements in patient outcomes (eg, blood pressure, blood chemistry, 
physiologic function, pathologic fi
 ndings). CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

RECOMMENDATIONS TO REDUCE THE 
RISK OF SIDS AND OTHER SLEEP-
RELATED INFANT DEATHS
1. Back to sleep for every sleep. 
To reduce the risk of SIDS, infants 
should be placed for sleep in a supine 
position (wholly on the back) for 
every sleep by every caregiver until 
the child reaches 1 year of age. 
4 
 
 
–8 
Side sleeping is not safe and is not 
advised. 
5, 
 
7
The supine sleep position does not 
increase the risk of choking and 
aspiration in infants, even those with 
gastroesophageal reflux, because 
infants have airway anatomy and 
mechanisms that protect against 
aspiration. 
9, 
 
10 The American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP) concurs with the 
North American Society for Pediatric 
Gastroenterology and Nutrition 
that “the risk of SIDS outweighs 
the benefit of prone or lateral sleep 
position on GER [gastroesophageal 
reflux]; therefore, in most infants 
from birth to 12 months of age, 
supine positioning during sleep is 
recommended. …Therefore, prone 
positioning is acceptable if the infant 
is observed and awake, particularly 
in the postprandial period, but 
prone positioning during sleep can 
only be considered in infants with 
certain upper airway disorders 
in which the risk of death from 
GERD [gastroesophageal reflux 
disease] may outweigh the risk of 
SIDS.” 
11 Examples of such upper 
airway disorders are those in which 
airway-protective mechanisms are 
impaired, including infants with 
anatomic abnormalities, such as type 
3 or 4 laryngeal clefts, who have not 
undergone antireflux surgery. There 
is no evidence to suggest that infants 
receiving nasogastric or orogastric 
feeds are at an increased risk of 
aspiration if placed in the supine 
position. Elevating the head of the 
infant’s crib is ineffective in reducing 
gastroesophageal reflux 
12 and is not 
recommended; in addition, elevating 
the head of the crib may result in the 
infant sliding to the foot of the crib 
into a position that may compromise 
respiration.
Preterm infants should be placed 
supine as soon as possible. Preterm 
infants are at increased risk of 
SIDS, 
 
13, 
 
14 and the association 
between prone sleep position and 
SIDS among low birth weight and 
preterm infants is equal to, or 
perhaps even stronger than, the 
association among those born at 
term. 
15 The task force concurs with 
the AAP Committee on Fetus and 
Newborn that “preterm infants 
should be placed supine for sleeping, 
just as term infants should, and the 
parents of preterm infants should 
be counseled about the importance 
of supine sleeping in preventing 
SIDS. Hospitalized preterm infants 
should be kept predominantly in 
the supine position, at least from 
the postmenstrual age of 32 weeks 
onward, so that they become 
acclimated to supine sleeping before 
discharge.” 
16 NICU personnel should 
endorse safe sleeping guidelines with 
parents of infants from the time of 
admission to the NICU. 
As stated in the AAP clinical report, 
“skin-to-skin care is recommended 
for all mothers and newborns, 
regardless of feeding or delivery 
method, immediately following birth 
(as soon as the mother is medically 
stable, awake, and able to respond to 
her newborn), and to continue for at 
least an hour.” 
17 Thereafter, or when 
the mother needs to sleep or take 
care of other needs, infants should be 
placed supine in a bassinet. There is 
no evidence that placing infants on 
their side during the first few hours 
after delivery promotes clearance of 
amniotic fluid and decreases the risk 
of aspiration. Infants in the newborn 
nursery and infants who are rooming 
in with their parents should be 
placed in the supine position as soon 
as they are ready to be placed in the 
bassinet.
Although data to make specific 
recommendations as to when it is 
safe for infants to sleep in the prone 
or side position are lacking, studies 
establishing prone and side sleeping 
as risk factors for SIDS include 
infants up to 1 year of age. Therefore, 
the best evidence suggests that 
infants should continue to be placed 
supine until 1 year of age. Once an 
infant can roll from supine to prone 
and from prone to supine, the infant 
can be allowed to remain in the sleep 
position that he or she assumes. 
Because rolling into soft bedding is 
an important risk factor for SUID 
after 3 months of age, 
 
18 parents and 
caregivers should continue to keep 
the infant’s sleep environment clear 
of soft or loose bedding.
2. Use a firm sleep surface.
Infants should be placed on a firm 
sleep surface (eg, mattress in a 
safety-approved crib) covered by a 
fitted sheet with no other bedding or 
soft objects to reduce the risk of SIDS 
and suffocation.
A firm surface maintains its shape 
and will not indent or conform to 
the shape of the infant’s head when 
the infant is placed on the surface. 
3

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
Soft mattresses, including those 
made from memory foam, could 
create a pocket (or indentation) and 
increase the chance of rebreathing or 
suffocation if the infant is placed in or 
rolls over to the prone position. 
19, 
 
20
A crib, bassinet, portable crib, or 
play yard that conforms to the 
safety standards of the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), 
including those for slat spacing 
less than 2-3/8 inches, snugly 
fitting and firm mattresses, and no 
drop sides, is recommended. 
21 In 
addition, parents and providers 
should check to make sure that the 
product has not been recalled. This 
is particularly important for used 
cribs. Cribs with missing hardware 
should not be used, nor should 
the parent or provider attempt to 
fix broken components of a crib, 
because many deaths are associated 
with cribs that are broken or with 
missing parts (including those that 
have presumably been fixed). Local 
organizations throughout the United 
States can help to provide low-cost or 
free cribs or play yards for families 
with financial constraints.
Bedside sleepers are attached to the 
side of the parental bed. The CPSC 
has published safety standards for 
these products, 
 
22 and they may 
be considered by some parents as 
an option. However, there are no 
CPSC safety standards for in-bed 
sleepers. The task force cannot make 
a recommendation for or against 
the use of either bedside sleepers 
or in-bed sleepers, because there 
have been no studies examining the 
association between these products 
and SIDS or unintentional injury and 
death, including suffocation.
Only mattresses designed for the 
specific product should be used. 
Mattresses should be firm and should 
maintain their shape even when the 
fitted sheet designated for that model 
is used, such that there are no gaps 
between the mattress and the wall 
of the crib, bassinet, portable crib, 
or play yard. Pillows or cushions 
should not be used as substitutes 
for mattresses or in addition to a 
mattress. Mattress toppers, designed 
to make the sleep surface softer, 
should not be used for infants 
younger than 1 year.
There is no evidence that special 
crib mattresses and sleep surfaces 
that claim to reduce the chance of 
rebreathing carbon dioxide when the 
infant is in the prone position reduce 
the risk of SIDS. However, there is 
no disadvantage to the use of these 
mattresses if they meet the safety 
standards as described previously.
Soft materials or objects, such 
as pillows, quilts, comforters, or 
sheepskins, even if covered by a 
sheet, should not be placed under a 
sleeping infant. If a mattress cover 
to protect against wetness is used, it 
should be tightly fitting and thin.
Infants should not be placed for 
sleep on beds, because of the risk of 
entrapment and suffocation. 
23, 
 
24 
In addition, portable bed rails should 
not be used with infants, because 
of the risk of entrapment and 
strangulation.
The infant should sleep in an area 
free of hazards, such as dangling 
cords, electric wires, and window-
covering cords, because these may 
present a strangulation risk.
Sitting devices, such as car seats, 
strollers, swings, infant carriers, and 
infant slings, are not recommended 
for routine sleep in the hospital 
or at home, particularly for young 
infants. 
25 
 
 
– 
30 Infants who are younger 
than 4 months are particularly at 
risk, because they may assume 
positions that can create a risk of 
suffocation or airway obstruction 
or may not be able to move out of a 
potentially asphyxiating situation. 
When infant slings and cloth carriers 
are used for carrying, it is important 
to ensure that the infant’s head is 
up and above the fabric, the face is 
visible, and the nose and mouth are 
clear of obstructions. 
31 After nursing, 
the infant should be repositioned 
in the sling so that the head is up, is 
clear of fabric, and is not against the 
adult’s body or the sling. If an infant 
falls asleep in a sitting device, he 
or she should be removed from the 
product and moved to a crib or other 
appropriate flat surface as soon as 
is safe and practical. Car seats and 
similar products are not stable on 
a crib mattress or other elevated 
surfaces. 
32 
 
– 
36 Infants should not 
be left unattended in car seats and 
similar products, nor should they be 
placed or left in car seats and similar 
products with the straps unbuckled 
or partially buckled. 
30
3. Breastfeeding is recommended.
Breastfeeding is associated with a 
reduced risk of SIDS. 
37 
– 
39 Unless 
contraindicated, mothers should 
breastfeed exclusively or feed with 
expressed milk (ie, not offer any 
formula or other nonhuman milk-
based supplements) for 6 months, in 
alignment with recommendations of 
the AAP. 
40
The protective effect of breastfeeding 
increases with exclusivity. 
39 
However, any breastfeeding has been 
shown to be more protective against 
SIDS than no breastfeeding. 
39
4. It is recommended that infants 
sleep in the parents’ room, close to 
the parents’ bed, but on a separate 
surface designed for infants, 
ideally for the first year of life, but 
at least for the first 6 months. 
There is evidence that sleeping in 
the parents’ room but on a separate 
surface decreases the risk of SIDS by 
as much as 50%. 
6, 
 
8, 
 
41, 
 
42 In addition, 
this arrangement is most likely to 
prevent suffocation, strangulation, 
and entrapment that may occur when 
the infant is sleeping in the adult bed.
The infant’s crib, portable crib, play 
yard, or bassinet should be placed 
in the parents’ bedroom until the 
child’s first birthday. Although there 
is no specific evidence for moving an 
infant to his or her own room before 
1 year of age, the first 6 months 
are particularly critical, because 
4

 PEDIATRICS Volume  
138 
, number  
5 
,  
November 2016 
the rates of SIDS and other sleep-
related deaths, particularly those 
occurring in bed-sharing situations, 
are highest in the first 6 months. 
Placing the crib close to the parents’ 
bed so that the infant is within view 
and reach can facilitate feeding, 
comforting, and monitoring of the 
infant. Room-sharing reduces SIDS 
risk and removes the possibility 
of suffocation, strangulation, and 
entrapment that may occur when the 
infant is sleeping in the adult bed.
There is insufficient evidence to 
recommend for or against the use 
of devices promoted to make bed-
sharing “safe.” There is no evidence 
that these devices reduce the risk 
of SIDS or suffocation or are safe. 
Some products designed for in-bed 
use (in-bed sleepers) are currently 
under study but results are not yet 
available. Bedside sleepers, which 
attach to the side of the parental bed 
and for which the CPSC has published 
standards, 
 
22 may be considered by 
some parents as an option. There are 
no CPSC safety standards for in-bed 
sleepers. The task force cannot make 
a recommendation for or against 
the use of either bedside sleepers 
or in-bed sleepers, because there 
have been no studies examining the 
association between these products 
and SIDS or unintentional injury and 
death, including suffocation.
Infants who are brought into the bed 
for feeding or comforting should be 
returned to their own crib or bassinet 
when the parent is ready to return to 
sleep. 
7, 
 
43
Couches and armchairs are extremely 
dangerous places for infants. Sleeping 
on couches and armchairs places 
infants at extraordinarily high risk of 
infant death, including SIDS, 
 
4, 
 
6, 
 
7, 
 
42, 
43 
suffocation through entrapment or 
wedging between seat cushions, 
or overlay if another person is also 
sharing this surface. 
44 Therefore, 
parents and other caregivers should 
be especially vigilant as to their 
wakefulness when feeding infants or 
lying with infants on these surfaces. 
Infants should never be placed on a 
couch or armchair for sleep.
The safest place for an infant to sleep 
is on a separate sleep surface designed 
for infants close to the parents’ bed. 
However, the AAP acknowledges that 
parents frequently fall asleep while 
feeding the infant. Evidence suggests 
that it is less hazardous to fall asleep 
with the infant in the adult bed than 
on a sofa or armchair, should the 
parent fall asleep. It is important to 
note that a large percentage of infants 
who die of SIDS are found with their 
head covered by bedding. Therefore, 
no pillows, sheets, blankets, or any 
other items that could obstruct infant 
breathing or cause overheating should 
be in the bed. Parents should also 
follow safe sleep recommendations 
outlined elsewhere in this statement. 
Because there is evidence that the risk 
of bed-sharing is higher with longer 
duration, if the parent falls asleep 
while feeding the infant in bed, the 
infant should be placed back on a 
separate sleep surface as soon as the 
parent awakens.
There are specific circumstances 
that, in case-control studies and 
case series, have been shown to 
substantially increase the risk of 
SIDS or unintentional injury or death 
while bed-sharing, and these should 
be avoided at all times:
 
• Bed-sharing with a term normal-
weight infant younger than 4 
months 
6, 
 
8, 
 
42, 
 
43, 
45, 
 
46 and infants born 
preterm and/or with low birth 
weight, 
 
47 regardless of parental 
smoking status. Even for breastfed 
infants, there is an increased risk of 
SIDS when bed-sharing if younger 
than 4 months. 
48 This appears to 
be a particularly vulnerable time, 
so if parents choose to feed their 
infants younger than 4 months 
in bed, they should be especially 
vigilant to not fall asleep.
 
• Bed-sharing with a current smoker 
(even if he or she does not smoke 
in bed) or if the mother smoked 
during pregnancy. 
6, 
 
7, 
 
46, 
 
49, 
50
 
• Bed-sharing with someone who is 
impaired in his or her alertness or 
ability to arouse because of fatigue 
or use of sedating medications 
(eg, certain antidepressants, pain 
medications) or substances (eg, 
alcohol, illicit drugs). 
8, 
 
48, 
 
51, 
 
52
 
• Bed-sharing with anyone who is 
not the infant’s parent, including 
nonparental caregivers and other 
children. 
4
 
• Bed-sharing on a soft surface, such 
as a waterbed, old mattress, sofa, 
couch, or armchair. 
4, 
 
6, 
 
7, 
 
42, 
43
 
• Bed-sharing with soft bedding 
accessories, such as pillows or 
blankets. 
4, 
 
53
 
• The safety and benefits of 
cobedding for twins and higher-
order multiples have not been 
established. It is prudent to provide 
separate sleep surfaces and avoid 
cobedding for twins and higher-
order multiples in the hospital and 
at home. 
54
5. Keep soft objects and loose 
bedding away from the infant’s 
sleep area to reduce the risk of 
SIDS, suffocation, entrapment, and 
strangulation.
Soft objects, 
 
19, 
 
20, 
 
55 
– 
58 such as 
pillows and pillow-like toys, quilts, 
comforters, sheepskins, and loose 
bedding, 
 
4, 
 
7, 
 
59 
 
 
– 
64 such as blankets 
and nonfitted sheets, can obstruct 
an infant’s nose and mouth. An 
obstructed airway can pose a risk of 
suffocation, entrapment, or SIDS.
Infant sleep clothing, such as a 
wearable blanket, is preferable to 
blankets and other coverings to 
keep the infant warm while reducing 
the chance of head covering or 
entrapment that could result from 
blanket use.
Bumper pads or similar products 
that attach to crib slats or sides 
were originally intended to prevent 
injury or death attributable to head 
entrapment. Cribs manufactured to 
newer standards have a narrower 
distance between slats to prevent

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
head entrapment. Because bumper 
pads have been implicated as 
a factor contributing to deaths 
from suffocation, entrapment, and 
strangulation 
65, 
 
66 and because 
they are not necessary to prevent 
head entrapment with new safety 
standards for crib slats, they are not 
recommended for infants. 
65, 
 
66
6. Consider offering a pacifier at 
nap time and bedtime.
Although the mechanism is yet unclear, 
studies have reported a protective 
effect of pacifiers on the incidence of 
SIDS. 
67, 
 
68 The protective effect of the 
pacifier is observed even if the pacifier 
falls out of the infant’s mouth. 
69, 
 
70
The pacifier should be used when 
placing the infant for sleep. It does not 
need to be reinserted once the infant 
falls asleep. If the infant refuses the 
pacifier, he or she should not be forced 
to take it. In those cases, parents can 
try to offer the pacifier again when the 
infant is a little older.
Because of the risk of strangulation, 
pacifiers should not be hung around 
the infant’s neck. Pacifiers that attach 
to infant clothing should not be used 
with sleeping infants.
Objects, such as stuffed toys and 
other items that may present a 
suffocation or choking risk, should 
not be attached to pacifiers.
For breastfed infants, pacifier 
introduction should be delayed until 
breastfeeding is firmly established. 
40 
Infants who are not being directly 
breastfed can begin pacifier use as 
soon as desired.
There is insufficient evidence that 
finger sucking is protective against 
SIDS.
7. Avoid smoke exposure during 
pregnancy and after birth.
Both maternal smoking during 
pregnancy and smoke in the infant’s 
environment after birth are major 
risk factors for SIDS.
Mothers should not smoke during 
pregnancy or after the infant’s 
birth. 
71 
 
– 
74
There should be no smoking 
near pregnant women or infants. 
Encourage families to set strict rules 
for smoke-free homes and cars and to 
eliminate secondhand tobacco smoke 
from all places in which children and 
other nonsmokers spend time. 
75, 
 
76
The risk of SIDS is particularly high 
when the infant bed-shares with an 
adult smoker, even when the adult 
does not smoke in bed. 
6, 
 
7, 
 
46, 
 
49, 
50, 
 
77
8. Avoid alcohol and illicit drug use 
during pregnancy and after birth. 
There is an increased risk of SIDS 
with prenatal and postnatal exposure 
to alcohol or illicit drug use.
Mothers should avoid alcohol and 
illicit drugs periconceptionally and 
during pregnancy. 
78 
 
 
 
 
– 
85
Parental alcohol and/or illicit drug 
use in combination with bed-sharing 
places the infant at particularly high 
risk of SIDS. 
8, 
 
51
9. Avoid overheating and head 
covering in infants.
Although studies have shown 
an increased risk of SIDS with 
overheating, 
 
86 
 
– 
89 the definition of 
overheating in these studies varies. 
Therefore, it is difficult to provide 
specific room temperature guidelines 
to avoid overheating.
In general, infants should be dressed 
appropriately for the environment, 
with no greater than 1 layer more 
than an adult would wear to be 
comfortable in that environment.
Parents and caregivers should 
evaluate the infant for signs of 
overheating, such as sweating or the 
infant’s chest feeling hot to the touch.
Overbundling and covering of the 
face and head should be avoided. 
90
There is currently insufficient 
evidence to recommend the use of a 
fan as a SIDS risk-reduction strategy.
10. Pregnant women should obtain 
regular prenatal care.
There is substantial epidemiologic 
evidence linking a lower risk of SIDS 
for infants whose mothers obtain 
regular prenatal care. 
71 
 
– 
74 Pregnant 
women should follow guidelines for 
frequency of prenatal visits.91
11. Infants should be immunized in 
accordance with recommendations 
of the AAP and Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention.
There is no evidence that there 
is a causal relationship between 
immunizations and SIDS. 
92 
 
– 
95 Indeed, 
recent evidence suggests that 
vaccination may have a protective 
effect against SIDS.96 
– 
98
12. Avoid the use of commercial 
devices that are inconsistent with 
safe sleep recommendations. 
Be particularly wary of devices that 
claim to reduce the risk of SIDS. 
Examples include, but are not limited 
to, wedges and positioners and other 
devices placed in the adult bed for the 
purpose of positioning or separating 
the infant from others in the bed. 
Crib mattresses also have been 
developed to improve the dispersion 
of carbon dioxide in the event that the 
infant ends up in the prone position 
during sleep. Although data do not 
support the claim of carbon dioxide 
dispersion unless there is an active 
dispersal component, 
 
99 there is no 
harm in using these mattresses if they 
meet standard safety requirements. 
However, there is no evidence that 
any of these devices reduce the risk of 
SIDS. Importantly, the use of products 
claiming to increase sleep safety 
does not diminish the importance of 
following recommended safe sleep 
practices. Information about a specific 
product can be found on the CPSC 
Web site (www. 
cpsc. 
gov). The AAP 
concurs with the US Food and Drug 
Administration and the CPSC that 
manufacturers should not claim that 
a product or device protects against 
SIDS unless there is scientific evidence 
to that effect.
13. Do not use home 
cardiorespiratory monitors as a 
strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS.
The use of cardiorespiratory 
monitors has not been documented 
6

Downloaded from 
 PEDIATRICS Volume  
138 
, number

to decrease the incidence of 
SIDS. 
100 
 
– 
103 These devices are 
sometimes prescribed for use at 
home to detect apnea or bradycardia 
and, when pulse oximetry is used, 
decreases in oxyhemoglobin 
saturation for infants at risk of these 
conditions. In addition, routine 
in-hospital cardiorespiratory 
monitoring before discharge from the 
hospital has not been shown to detect 
infants at risk of SIDS. There are no 
data that other commercial devices 
that are designed to monitor infant 
vital signs reduce the risk of SIDS.
14. Supervised, awake tummy 
time is recommended to facilitate 
development and to minimize 
development of positional 
plagiocephaly.
Although there are no data to make 
specific recommendations as to 
how often and how long it should be 
undertaken, the task force concurs 
with the AAP Committee on Practice 
and Ambulatory Medicine and 
Section on Neurologic Surgery that “a 
certain amount of prone positioning, 
or ‘tummy time, 
’ while the infant 
is awake and being observed is 
recommended to help prevent the 
development of flattening of the 
occiput and to facilitate development 
of the upper shoulder girdle strength 
necessary for timely attainment of 
certain motor milestones.” 
104
Diagnosis, management, and other 
prevention strategies for positional 
plagiocephaly, such as avoidance 
of excessive time in car seats and 
changing the infant’s orientation in 
the crib, are discussed in detail in the 
AAP clinical report on positional skull 
deformities. 
104
15. There is no evidence to 
recommend swaddling as a 
strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS. 
Swaddling, or wrapping the 
infant in a light blanket, is often 
used as a strategy to calm the 
infant and encourage the use of the 
supine position. There is a high risk 
of death if a swaddled infant is 
placed in or rolls to the prone 
position. 
88, 
 
105, 
 
106 If infants are 
swaddled, they should always be 
placed on the back. Swaddling should 
be snug around the chest but allow 
for ample room at the hips and 
knees to avoid exacerbation of hip 
dysplasia. When an infant exhibits 
signs of attempting to roll, swaddling 
should no longer be used. 
88, 
105, 
 
106 
There is no evidence with regard 
to SIDS risk related to the arms 
swaddled in or out. These decisions 
about swaddling should be made on 
an individual basis, depending on the 
physiologic needs of the infant.
16. Health care professionals, staff 
in newborn nurseries and NICUs, 
and child care providers should 
endorse and model the SIDS risk-
reduction recommendations from 
birth. 
107 
– 
109
Staff in NICUs should model and 
implement all SIDS risk-reduction 
recommendations as soon as the 
infant is medically stable and well 
before anticipated discharge.
Staff in newborn nurseries should 
model and implement these 
recommendations beginning at 
birth and well before anticipated 
discharge.
All physicians, nurses, and other 
health care providers should receive 
education on safe infant sleep. Health 
care providers should screen for 
and recommend safe sleep practices 
at each visit for infants up to 1 year 
old. Families who do not have a safe 
sleep space for their infant should 
be provided with information about 
low-cost or free cribs or play yards.
Hospitals should ensure that hospital 
policies are consistent with updated 
safe sleep recommendations and that 
infant sleep spaces (bassinets, cribs) 
meet safe sleep standards.
All state regulatory agencies should 
require that child care providers 
receive education on safe infant sleep 
and implement safe sleep practices. 
It is preferable that they have written 
policies.
17. Media and manufacturers 
should follow safe sleep guidelines 
in their messaging and advertising. 
Media exposures (including movie, 
television, magazines, newspapers, 
and Web sites), manufacturer 
advertisements, and store displays 
affect individual behavior by 
influencing beliefs and 
attitudes. 
107, 
 
109 Media and 
advertising messages contrary 
to safe sleep recommendations 
may create misinformation about 
safe sleep practices. 
110
18. Continue the “Safe to 
Sleep” campaign, focusing on 
ways to reduce the risk of all 
sleep-related infant deaths, 
including SIDS, suffocation, and 
other unintentional deaths. 
Pediatricians and other primary 
care providers should actively 
participate in this campaign.
Public education should continue for 
all who care for infants, including 
parents, child care providers, 
grandparents, foster parents, and 
babysitters, and should include 
strategies for overcoming barriers to 
behavior change.
The campaign should continue to 
have a special focus on the black and 
American Indian/Alaskan Native 
populations because of the higher 
incidence of SIDS and other sleep-
related infant deaths in these groups.
The campaign should specifically 
include strategies to increase 
breastfeeding while decreasing 
bed-sharing, and eliminating 
tobacco smoke exposure. The 
campaign should also highlight the 
circumstances that substantially 
increase the risk of SIDS or 
unintentional injury or death while 
bed-sharing, as listed previously.
These recommendations should 
be introduced before pregnancy 
and ideally in secondary school 
curricula to both males and females 
and incorporated into courses 
developed to train teenaged and 
adult babysitters. The importance

of maternal preconceptional 
health, infant breastfeeding, and 
the avoidance of substance use 
(including alcohol and smoking) 
should be included in this training.
Safe sleep messages should be 
reviewed, revised, and reissued at 
least every 5 years to address the 
next generation of new parents and 
products on the market.
19. Continue research and 
surveillance on the risk factors, 
causes, and pathophysiologic 
mechanisms of SIDS and other 
sleep-related infant deaths, with 
the ultimate goal of eliminating 
these deaths altogether.
Education campaigns need to 
be evaluated, and innovative 
intervention methods need to be 
encouraged and funded.
Continued research and improved 
surveillance on the etiology and 
pathophysiologic basis of SIDS should 
be funded.
Standardized protocols for death 
scene investigations, as per Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
protocol, should continue to be 
implemented. Comprehensive 
autopsies, including full external and 
internal examination of all major 
organs and tissues including the brain; 
complete radiographs; metabolic 
testing; and toxicology screening 
should be performed. Training about 
how to conduct a comprehensive 
death scene investigation offered to 
medical examiners, coroners, death 
scene investigators, first responders, 
and law enforcement should continue; 
and resources to maintain training 
and conduct of these investigations 
need to be allocated. In addition, child 
death reviews, with involvement of 
pediatricians and other primary care 
providers, should be supported and 
funded.
Improved and widespread 
surveillance of SIDS and SUID cases 
should be implemented and funded.
Federal and private funding agencies 
should remain committed to all 
aspects of the aforementioned 
research.
