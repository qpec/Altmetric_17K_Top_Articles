Summary
Infections with tick-transmitted Borreliella (Borrelia)
burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease, represent an
increasingly large public health problem in North
America and Europe. The ability of these spirochetes
to maintain themselves for extended periods of time
in their tick vectors and vertebrate reservoirs is
crucial for continuance of the enzootic cycle as well
as for the increasing exposure of humans to them.
The stringent response mediated by the alarmone
(p)ppGpp has been determined to be a master
regulator
in
B.
burgdorferi.
It
modulates
the
expression
of
identified
and
unidentified
open
reading frames needed to deal with and overcome the
many nutritional stresses and other challenges faced
by the spirochete in ticks and animal reservoirs. The
metabolic and morphologic changes resulting from
activation of the stringent response in B. burgdorferi
may also be involved in the recently described non-
genetic phenotypic phenomenon of tolerance to
otherwise lethal doses of antimicrobials and to other
antimicrobial activities. It may thus constitute a
linchpin in multiple aspects of infections with Lyme
disease borrelia, providing a link between the micro-
ecological challenges of its enzootic life-cycle and
long-term residence in the tissues of its animal
reservoirs,
with
the
evolutionary
side
effect
of
potential persistence in incidental human hosts.
Introduction
Borreliella (Borrelia) burgdorferi (Adeolu and Gupta,
2014; Barbour et al., 2017), the cause of Lyme disease,
has a small but complex genome consisting of one large
linear chromosome and multiple linear and circular plas-
mids, together comprising approximately 1520 kbp with
a G 1 C content of 28.6% (Fraser et al., 1997; Casjens
et al., 2000). This spirochete has two two-component
regulatory systems (TCS), three sigma factors, is totally
dependent on anaerobic glycolysis to generate ATP (i.e.,
it has no enzymes of the tricarboxylic cycle), and as
such, is unable to synthesize de novo amino acids,
nucleotides and fatty acids (Fraser et al., 1997; Radolf
et al., 2012; Corona and Schwartz, 2015). It is thus a
fastidious auxotroph whose nutritional requirements are
still undetermined (Gherardini et al., 2010; Corona and
Schwartz, 2015).
Despite the paucity of TCS compared to other bacte-
rial pathogens, B. burgdorferi is still able to overcome
the challenges encountered in infecting, colonizing and
surviving long-term in ticks and vertebrates (Radolf
et al., 2012; Corona and Schwartz, 2015). The regula-
tory axis mediated by the histidine kinase 1 (Hk1)-
response regulator 1 (Rrp1) TCS is involved in tick
colonization (Rogers et al., 2009; Freedman et al., 2010;
He et al., 2011; Pappas et al., 2011; Caimano et al.,
2015). It generates the second messenger cyclic digua-
nylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) and stimulates utiliza-
tion
of
glycerol
and
other
functions
necessary
for
survival in ticks (Rogers et al., 2009; Freedman et al.,
2010; He et al., 2011; 2014; Pappas et al., 2011; Novak
et al., 2014). In contrast, the regulatory axis mediated
by RpoN, RpoS and the Hk2-Rrp2 TCS modulates
expression of genes essential for tick transmission and
mammalian infection (H€
ubner et al., 2001; Caimano
et al., 2004; 2007; Fisher et al., 2005; Smith et al.,

 2007; Boardman et al., 2008; Ouyang et al., 2008;
2012). This second TCS regulatory axis also represses
glycerol utilization and many other functions needed by
B. burgdorferi for proliferation in ticks but not in the
mammalian host where glucose, a preferred carbon
source, is
readily available (Caimano et al., 2007;
Corona and Schwartz, 2015).
In many pathogens, the ancestral stringent response
triggered by amino acid starvation and mediated by the
alarmones guanosine tetraphosphate and guanosine
pentaphosphate (collectively referred to as (p)ppGpp or
‘magic spots’) is involved in coordinated regulation of
many genes and regulatory and metabolic pathways
(Fig. 1) (Potrykus and Cashel, 2008; Dalebroux and
Swanson, 2012; Boutte and Crosson, 2013; Hauryliuk
et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Steinchen and Bange,
2016). The stringent response links cell division, bacte-
rial growth, intermediary metabolism, chemotaxis and
motility,
morphotypic
transformations,
and
virulence
properties necessary to survive environmental chal-
lenges. In some bacteria, (p)ppGpp is mainly synthe-
sized and hydrolysed by two enzymes, RelA and SpoT,
in others chiefly by a single bifunctional enzyme, Rel or
RSH (RelA/SpoT homolog), with both activities. Cyto-
plasmic
redundant
short
alarmone
synthetases
and
GTPases in some bacteria provide additional paths to
(p)ppGpp regulation (Gaca et al., 2015a,b). The global
changes
in
transcription
seen
with
the
stringent
response are due to allosteric changes in RNA polymer-
ase that modify its specificity for different promoters and
are caused by the interaction of (p)ppGpp with the RNA
polymerase b0 and x subunits and with the small protein
DksA (Mallik et al., 2006; Doniselli et al., 2015; Ross
et al., 2016). In Escherichia coli, the ability of (p)ppGpp
to repress or trigger transcription of different promoters
is provided by the presence of specific DNA sequences
called discriminators (Potrykus and Cashel, 2008).
The limited number of TCS in B. burgdorferi suggests
that alternative global regulators able to sense environ-
mental conditions will be prominent in modulating gene
expression in this organism (Radolf et al., 2012; Corona
and Schwartz, 2015; Caimano et al., 2016). Extrapola-
tions based on results obtained with E. coli and other
bacteria can provide important clues to this analysis,
with the understanding that the functions and interac-
tions of borrelial orthologs might not always solely be
determinable by extrapolation from these other organ-
isms (Hyde et al., 2006; Caimano et al., 2007). We long
ago suggested that the stringent response was likely to
be involved in the ability of B. burgdorferi to survive and
persist in its vector and vertebrate hosts (Godfrey et al.,
2002). Several studies have subsequently confirmed
that the stringent response is a global regulator in B.
burgdorferi, and in fact is the only such regulator that
can simultaneously modulate DNA replication, synthesis
of stable RNAs (tRNA and rRNA), and synthesis and
translation of mRNA in this organism (Fig. 1) (Bugry-
sheva et al., 2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015). We now
review evidence indicating that the stringent response
plays an important role in the perpetuation of the B.
burgdorferi enzootic cycle, suggest where it may exert
its functions in the enzootic cycle, and indicate how
these might be recruited to pathological ends in hosts
outside it (Figs 2 and 3).

adaptation to microenvironmental challenges in the mammal and in the tick vector. Factors shown in the box on the left induce the activity of
RelBbu, which converts ATP and GTP into the alarmone (p)ppGpp. The effects on the bacteria include altered rates of growth and motility, regu-
lation of transport of metabolites, shifts in sugars (diauxie), amino acids and lipid utilization and different morphotypes. Many of these changes
enable persistence in ticks and mammals and the progression and maintenance of the enzootic cycle.

 RelBbu and (p)ppGpp in B. burgdorferi
Borreliella (Borrelia) burgdorferi contains a single relBbu
gene (BB0198) transcribed from its own r70 promoter
(Fraser et al., 1997; Bugrysheva et al., 2003). It encodes
a bifunctional enzyme able to synthesize and hydrolyse
(p)ppGpp and complement E. coli mutants unable to
produce (p)ppGpp
(Bugrysheva et al., 2003; 2005;
2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015). Null mutants of relBbu of
non-infectious B. burgdorferi B31 and infectious N40 and
B31–5A4 strains failed to generate (p)ppGpp, confirming
its unique responsibility for the presence of the alar-
mone in this bacterium (Bugrysheva et al., 2005; Dreck-
trah et al., 2015). Growth of B. burgdorferi B31 in
nutrient-limited RPMI media in the absence of rabbit
sera and in the presence of tick saliva led to increases
in the transcription of relBbu and levels of (p)ppGpp,
decreased synthesis of motility genes and the appear-
ance of round forms (Alban et al., 2000; Concepcion
and Nelson, 2003; Drecktrah et al., 2015). Experiments
with wild-type infectious B. burgdorferi B31–5A4 and its
null relBbu mutant and complemented derivatives con-
firmed the induction of (p)ppGpp under nutrient deple-
tion and indicated that these markers decreased but did
not totally disappear when B. burgdorferi cells were
returned to an enriched media (Drecktrah et al., 2015).
Moreover, both transcriptional and post-transcriptional
expression of RelBbu were modulated by the host envi-
ronment during growth in rat peritoneal chambers, in the
presence of tick cells, and in ticks. Although regulation
and the levels of (p)ppGpp appeared to be strain depen-
dent, (p)ppGpp was always present in B. burgdorferi
B31 and N40 growing in BSK-H (Bugrysheva et al.,
Fig. 2. Hypothetical role of the B. burgdorferi stringent response in the Ixodes scapularis reservoir and vector. Modulation of bacterial growth
mediated by the stringent response is crucial for its adaptation to nutritional challenges. Internal organs of the tick are shown in the central
panel (dark red, gut; light green, salivary gland). In feeding larvae during acquisition of spirochetes (light blue circle), rapid growth in the gut
(cell layer and magnified inset) results from attenuation of the stringent response within bacterial cells. In flat nymphs (bright green circle), high
levels of (p)ppGpp within the bacteria together with other regulatory molecules stimulate utilization of glycerol and decreased spirochete motil-
ity, and appearance of persister cells in the gut lumen via the stringent response. This state continues at the early transmission stage (yellow
oval) (1) in the feeding nymph where the stringent response might be involved in spirochete bleb formation, generation of reversible
epithelium-associated biofilm-like spirochete networks, round forms and persisters in the gut (cell layers and insets). Later (2), attenuation of
the stringent response associated with irruption of blood into the tick gut activates spirochete motility at the basement membrane and migration
to the haemocele and the salivary glands (3). Degradation of the peritrophic membrane, induced by enzymes from gut cells and the blood,
generates chitobiose, the metabolism of which is derepressed by attenuation of the stringent response and low levels of (p)ppGpp. The shift
from glycerol utilization to chitobiose utilization may also be a stimulus for the generation of persister cells. � 5 (p)ppGpp in borrelia cells.

 2002; 2003; 2005). Further experiments are needed to
characterize the nutritional requirements of B. burgdor-
feri and the stimuli that trigger the stringent response in
various environments.
Absence of (p)ppGpp in a B. burgdorferi 297 relBbu
null mutant grown in BSK-H media was associated with
a paradoxical growth deficit resulting from the slowing of
cell division, most dramatically at the stationary phase
(Bugrysheva et al., 2005). Transition to stationary phase
from exponential phase in this mutant was associated
with abnormally high levels of rRNA, similar to that seen
during unbalanced growth of the relaxed E. coli mutant
(Gallant and Cashel, 1967; Lazzarini et al., 1971; Bugry-
sheva et al., 2011). This suggests that the observed
growth deficit in the stationary phase may be due to
aberrant
gene
expression
and
may
indicate
that
(p)ppGpp is an important regulator of balanced growth
in B. burgdorferi (Fig. 1) (Bugrysheva et al., 2005; 2011;
Potrykus et al., 2011). Furthermore, a B. burgdorferi
B31–5A4 null relBbu derivative grown in RMPI media to
stationary phase lost viability and exhibited a significant
number of borrelial round bodies, structures previously
identified as occurring during the organism’s life cycle
(Brorson
and
Brorson,
1997;
Alban
et
al.,
2000;
Dunham-Ems et al., 2012; Drecktrah et al., 2015).

Fig. 3. Hypothetical role of the B. burgdorferi stringent response in the Peromyscus leucopus reservoir. Transmission of B. burgdorferi into the
dermis of mice, usually by I. scapularis nymphs, generates an acute infection. In the dermal environment with high levels of glucose and other
nutrients, borrelia begin to display an attenuated stringent response with low levels of (p)ppGpp, which in turn enables rapid borrelial division,
multiplication and motility. These rapidly dividing and motile bacteria subsequently invade adjacent areas of the dermis, bloodstream and vari-
ous organs, reaching relatively high concentrations (outer pink circle, attenuated stringent response). After several weeks, as a result of the
immune response, borrelia disappear from blood, and few remain in connective tissues. These low numbers of borrelia display an activated
stringent response and high levels of (p)ppGpp in response to nutritional depletion and other stimuli, including the potential ability of the
immune response to block the uptake of nutrients by borrelial transporters. These spirochetes will probably be slow moving, transcription com-
petent and persisters (inner orange circle, high concentration of (p)ppGpp). � 5 (p)ppGpp in borrelia cells.

 regulator, especially in the stationary phase (Drecktrah
et al., 2015). In these latter studies, (p)ppGpp could shift
gene expression both positively and negatively from that
characteristic of stationary phase to that of starvation and
recovery (Drecktrah et al., 2015). The B. burgdorferi strin-
gent response modulated expression of genes mediating
DNA synthesis and repair, protein synthesis, cell enve-
lope synthesis and cell division, motility and chemotaxis
and intermediary metabolism (Bugrysheva et al., 2015;
Drecktrah et al., 2015). Lipoprotein genes, including sev-
eral adhesins and a decorin-binding protein (dbpB) as
well as the antigenic variation surface exposed lipopro-
teins (VlsEs) were also modulated by (p)ppGpp in the
stationary phase (Drecktrah et al., 2015).
The B. burgdorferi stringent response also modulates
expression of regulatory and structural genes affecting
important biochemical pathways such as carbon source
and amino acid metabolism (Bugrysheva et al., 2015;
Drecktrah et al., 2015). For example, lack of synthesis
of (p)ppGpp was accompanied by increased transcrip-
tion of the genes of the stringent response regulator
DksA, r70 and the Rrp1/Hk1 TCS. This suggests some
repression of these global regulators during the stringent
response (Bugrysheva et al., 2015). Transcription of
genes encoding regulatory proteins CsrA, RpoS and
BosR were also modulated by the borrelial stringent
response, implying that (p)ppGpp may modulate gene
expression indirectly through other global regulators
(Bugrysheva et al., 2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015). Meta-
bolic genes positively regulated during the stringent
response included those involved in metabolism of glyc-
erol, a sugar utilized by B. burgdorferi in ticks, and
genes involved in oligopeptide transport, as would be
expected as a response to lack of nutrients (Bugrysheva
et al., 2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015). Genes negatively
regulated by the stringent response in B. burgdorferi
included those involved in the metabolism of chitobiose,
an alternative sugar also present in ticks and utilized by
B. burgdorferi and the mevalonate pathway genes hmg
and mvaA involved in cell wall and membrane synthesis
(Fig. 2) (Rhodes et al., 2009; Van Laar et al., 2012;
Bugrysheva et al., 2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015).
The alarmone (p)ppGpp is thus an important global
regulator of B. burgdorferi. It can modulate expression of
approximately 30% of its genes during both exponential
and stationary phases of growth and during shifts to and
from
starvation
and
repletion,
and
redirect
borrelia
metabolism accordingly (Bugrysheva et al., 2015; Dreck-
trah et al., 2015). Although more than half of regulated
B. burgdorferi genes encode currently hypothetical pro-
teins, the patterns of altered regulation of known genes
in this organism generally correspond to those associ-
ated
with
the
stringent
response
in
other
bacteria
(Potrykus and Cashel, 2008; Dalebroux and Swanson,
2012; Boutte and Crosson, 2013; Hauryliuk et al., 2015;
Liu et al., 2015). The short half-life of (p)ppGpp means
that reversal of the B. burgdorferi stringent response
triggered by starvation and other still uncharacterized
stimuli is rapid once their stimuli subside which helps it
quickly
accommodate
to
the
microenvironmental
changes associated with borrelial residence in ticks and
vertebrates (Bugrysheva et al., 2015; Drecktrah et al.,
2015; Bergkessel et al., 2016). B. burgdorferi, like other
bacteria, produces basal detectable levels of (p)ppGpp
in the absence of nutritional stimuli (Bugrysheva et al.,
2005; Drecktrah et al., 2015; Gaca et al., 2015a,b); the
function of these basal levels of (p)ppGpp in global gene
regulation deserves further investigation.
The stringent response during acquisition and
transmission of B. burgdorferi by Ixodes larvae and
nymphs
After feeding to repletion on an infected mammalian
host, each larva contains about 500 B. burgdorferi per
tick (Piesman et al., 1990; Soares et al., 2006). By 10
days, this rises to approximately 3000 just before molt-
ing into nymphs is completed and the reservoir blood is
absorbed. Once molting is completed, the concentration
of B. burgdorferi in the unfed nymphs is less than 100
organisms per tick, probably because of a lack of
nutrients and exposure to the tick’s innate immune
responses and microbiome-mediated antibacterial prop-
erties (Piesman et al., 1990; Soares et al., 2006; Nara-
simhan et al., 2014). In contrast, there is a much larger
range in numbers of B. burgdorferi in feeding nymphs
during transmission, with less than 100 spirochetes in
the flat nymph at the start of feeding to close to 105 at
repletion (Fig. 2) (Piesman et al., 1990). These changes
appear to be tied to the increase and/or decrease in
nutritional components provided by the blood meal, the
blood meal’s antibacterial properties and antibacterial
components present in the tick (Piesman et al., 1990;
Soares et al., 2006; Pal and Fikrig, 2010). Involvement
of the stringent response in the ability of B. burgdorferi
to traverse tick metamorphosis and transmission to a
new host (Fig. 2) is suggested by its ability to regulate
growth and modulate expression of genes involved in
glycerol and chitobiose metabolism, both carbon sour-
ces crucial to its survival in larvae and nymphs (Fig. 1)
(He et al., 2011; Pappas et al., 2011; Bugrysheva et al.,
2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015). In fact, B. burgdorferi
relBbu null mutants unable to produce (p)ppGpp acquired
by nymphs from infected mice could not reach suffi-
ciently high concentrations to permit transmission and
completion of the enzootic cycle (Drecktrah et al., 2015).

 acquisition because blood entering the tick gut contains
amino acids, glucose, other sugars and fatty acids
(Fig. 2) (Radolf et al., 2012; Corona and Schwartz,
2015). By the time larvae finish feeding and molting, the
blood
meal
has
been
digested
and
its
nutrients
completely absorbed. This lack of nutrients stimulates
the stringent response and results in non-dividing borre-
lia with inhibited growth and sluggish motility in the flat
nymphs (Dunham-Ems et al., 2009; Pal and Fikrig,
2010;
Corona
and
Schwartz,
2015).
After
the
flat
nymphs start to feed, we assume that the stringent
response continues for a short period of time but is
blunted by the blood entering the tick gut. The hypothe-
sized active B. burgdorferi stringent response in the first
24–48 h of nymph feeding would coincide with observed
borrelial cell blebs, transient round forms and formation
of biofilm-like networks and aggregates, and expression
of borrelial adhesins for tick epithelial cell receptors
together with adhesion-mediated motility through the gut
epithelial cells (Fig. 2) (Pal et al., 2004; Ferullo and
Lovett, 2008; Traxler et al., 2008; Dunham-Ems et al.,
2009; 2012; Srivastava and de Silva, 2009; Zhang et al.,
2011; Meril€
ainen et al., 2015; Gupta et al., 2016). It is
plausible that the stringent response mediates these
processes since the stringent response in B. burgdorferi
(like that in other bacteria) modulates expression of
genes of the mevalonate pathway involved in cell wall
morphogenesis, inhibition of motility, formation of aggre-
gates and biofilms, and quorum sensing (Potrykus and
Cashel, 2008; Dalebroux and Swanson, 2012; Boutte
and Crosson, 2013; Arnold et al., 2015; Bugrysheva
et al., 2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015; Gupta et al., 2016).
After 48 h of feeding, as nutrients from the blood meal
begin to be utilized by tick gut epithelial cells and
increased nutrients are available to the spirochetes, the
stringent response will subside, and spirochetes will
begin to divide and rapidly reach high concentrations
(Piesman et al., 1990; Dunham-Ems et al., 2009). By
the time spirochetes reach the basement membrane of
the tick gut epithelia, motility has been reactivated, and
a fraction of motile borrelia migrate from the gut to the
haematocele and the salivary glands (Fig. 2) (Dunham-
Ems et al., 2009; 2012).
These hypothesized shifts in activity of the B. burgdor-
feri stringent response are consistent with experimen-
tally
observed
changes
in
transcription
of
genes
associated with sugar utilization (He et al., 2011; Pap-
pas et al., 2011; Bugrysheva et al., 2015; Corona and
Schwartz, 2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015). Borrelia prefer-
entially utilize glucose provided in feeding ticks by
ingested blood (von Lackum and Stevenson, 2005;
Corona and Schwartz, 2015). The suggested activation
of the stringent response in flat nymphs is associated
with glycerol being used as a carbon source (He et al.,
2011; Pappas et al., 2011). With the hypothesized blunt-
ing of the stringent response as feeding in nymphs is
being completed, utilization will shift from glycerol to glu-
cose and chitobiose (Fig. 2) (Traxler et al., 2006; Pap-
pas et al., 2011; Corona and Schwartz, 2015). The latter
sugars only become available at this stage because of
the reorganization of the peritrophic membrane pro-
duced by the incoming blood and by the sloughing of
tick gut intestinal cells (Fig. 2) (Zhu et al., 1991;
Dunham-Ems et al., 2009; 2012; Pal and Fikrig, 2010;
Pappas et al., 2011; Corona and Schwartz, 2015).
Regulation of these metabolic shifts in B. burgdorferi
by other global regulators including RpoS, BosR, BadR
and c-di-GMP as well as by (p)ppGpp underlines their
relevance for the bacterial life cycle in the tick (Hyde
et al., 2006; Freedman et al., 2010; Hyde et al., 2010;
He et al., 2011; Pappas et al., 2011; Sze et al., 2012;
Miller et al., 2013; Sze et al., 2013; Caimano et al.,
2015; 2016; Corona and Schwartz, 2015; Ouyang and
Zhou, 2015). The progressive variations described here,
in cell division, growth, morphotypes, motility, carbon
source utilization and potential tolerance to noxious stim-
uli all appear to be necessary for borrelia to complete
the
tick
cycle
(Fig.
2)
(Bugrysheva
et
al.,
2015;
Drecktrah et al., 2015). The stimuli responsible for the
stringent response in their transit through the ticks,
although currently undetermined, can be reasonably
assumed (as in other bacteria) to result from a lack of
amino acids required for protein synthesis (Potrykus and
Cashel, 2008; Dalebroux and Swanson, 2012; Boutte
and Crosson, 2013; Bugrysheva et al., 2015; Drecktrah
et al., 2015). This supposition is supported by the fact
that the stringent response positively regulates the Opp
transporter systems needed for the transport of oligo-
peptides, the intracellular source of these amino acids
(Wang et al., 2002; Medrano et al., 2007; Bugrysheva
et al., 2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015). The stringent
response could also be generated by as yet uncharac-
terized mechanisms including the availability, or lack of,
other nutrients such as fatty acids, sugars, metal ions,
oxidative stress and changes in osmolarity or pH (Revel
et al., 2002; Potrykus and Cashel, 2008; Boutte and
Crosson, 2013; Bontemps-Gallo et al., 2016).
The stringent response and B. burgdorferi residence
in vertebrate reservoirs
The emergence and spread of B. burgdorferi infections
depends on its ability to take up residence in its tick vec-
tors and vertebrate hosts for extended periods of time
(i.e., its persistence) in a fashion that ensures continuity
of the enzootic cycle (Radolf et al., 2012; Schotthoefer
and Frost, 2015; Steere et al., 2016). While the esti-
mated numbers of spirochetes in the salivary glands of

 nymphs during transmission are approximately 60 per
gland, only some of them are injected and only a frac-
tion of those injected are infectious (Leuba-Garcia et al.,
1998; Ohnishi et al., 2001; Lima et al., 2005). This sug-
gests that borrelia undergo a proliferative burst after a
low dose inoculation in the skin (Fig. 3) (Leuba-Garcia
et al., 1998; O’Rourke et al., 2013; Stupica et al., 2015).
This has been directly confirmed both in humans with
Lyme disease and in Peromyscus and Mus musculus
mice infected with B. burgdorferi by either feeding
nymphs or needle injection (Piesman et al., 1987;
Piesman, 1989; Barthold et al., 1991; 2010b; Liveris
et al., 2002; Li et al., 2011).
The few spirochetes inoculated in the mouse dermis
are exposed to appreciable concentrations of tissue
nutrients and glucose, their preferred carbon source
(von
Lackum
and
Stevenson,
2005;
Corona
and
Schwartz, 2015), and the stringent response probably
abates. The rate of cell division in the skin rapidly
increases; concentrations of 1 3 104 to 1 3 105 per mg
tissue are reached in a few days, with dissemination
towards the periphery of the site of inoculation (Liveris
et al., 2002; O’Rourke et al., 2013; Stupica et al., 2015).
This growth is accompanied by active motility mediated
by chemotaxis and hematogenous and lymphatic spread
to distant organs (Barthold et al., 1991; 2010a; Wang
et al., 2001; Wang, 2002; Kumar et al., 2015). Another
burst of cell division and growth occurs on colonization
of organs a few days later, and densities of approxi-
mately 1 3 104 spirochetes per mg tissue can be
reached in this phase of infection (Fig. 3) (Barthold
et al., 1991; 2010b; Wang et al., 2001; Wang, 2002).
In time, bacterial multiplication subsides, probably as
result of antibacterial immune responses and nutrient
limitations. Months after infection, only scattered borrelia
are detected in some organ refugia by light microscopy
and PCR (Fig. 3) (Barthold et al., 1991; 2010a; Zeidner
et al., 2001). In animal models of B. burgdorferi infec-
tion, there is a predilection of the spirochetes for collag-
enous tissues, which may be the result of borrelial
adhesins for receptor molecules on the cells of these
tissues (Coburn et al., 2013; Imai et al., 2013; Brissette
and Gaultney, 2014; Caine and Coburn, 2015; Kumar
et al., 2015; Wager et al., 2015; Zhi et al., 2015), pro-
pensity of the spirochete to invade native collagen matri-
ces (Zambrano et al., 2004; Cabello et al., 2007), and/or
the presence of antibodies preventing multiplication and
invasion of other tissues and organs (Barthold et al.,
1991; 2006; 2010b; Bockenstedt et al., 2001).
In mice, resurgence in the number of B. burgdorferi
can occur many months after infection as antibody lev-
els begin to wane (Barthold et al., 1993; 2010b). The
sparse numbers of bacteria in these tissues display a
quiescent state with low motility and no evidence of
multiplication, but are probably viable as evidenced by
their transcriptional competence that may permit their
resurgence under some conditions (Barthold et al., 1993;
2010b; Liang et al., 2004; Cabello et al., 2007; Imai
et al., 2013). In this apparently quiescent state in the col-
lagenous
tissues,
it
is
expected
that
the
stringent
response will be activated because of nutrient limitation,
and transport mechanisms for amino acids and other
molecules will be stimulated (Wang et al., 2002; Medrano
et al., 2007; Potrykus and Cashel, 2008; Boutte and
Crosson, 2013; Bugrysheva et al., 2015; Drecktrah et al.,
2015; Hauryliuk et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015). This quies-
cent state could have the side effect of making the borre-
lia tolerant to antimicrobials and immune activity and lead
to spirochetal persistence (Fig. 3) (Lusitani et al., 2003;
Barbour, 2012; Feng et al., 2014; 2015a; Caskey and
Embers, 2015; Sharma et al., 2015).
This pattern of infection in the mammalian host sug-
gests that following transmission of B. burgdorferi into
the dermis by feeding nymphs, the stringent response is
turned off because sufficient levels of nutrients are avail-
able in the dermis, blood and other host tissues (Corona
and Schwartz, 2015). This could possibly account for
the finding that mice were not infected following injection
of a low concentration (1 3 104 cells) of a B. burgdorferi
297 relBbu mutant unable to synthetize (p)ppGpp (Bugry-
sheva et al., 2005). However, a similar B. burgdorferi
mutant of a different strain (B. burgdorferi B31–5A4)
was infectious at higher doses of organisms (1 3 105
to 1 3 106) (Drecktrah et al., 2015). The potential rele-
vance of relBbu and (p)ppGpp for B. burgdorferi infection
and continued presence in the mouse reservoir may
thus be dependent on both the inoculated dose and the
B. burgdorferi strain involved (Bugrysheva et al., 2003;
2005; Drecktrah et al., 2015). The ability of the stringent
response to coordinate the changes needed by borrelia
to transition rapidly from actively multiplying to quiescent
states and back in vertebrate reservoirs and to ensure
its persistence and availability for the vector during
acquisition argues for its role in this stage of the enzo-
otic cycle (Fig. 3) (Barthold et al., 1991; Bugrysheva
et al., 2003; 2005; 2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015).
Could the borrelial stringent response mediate
antimicrobial tolerance and persistence as an
adaptation for the enzootic cycle?
While still a matter of dispute, there are numerous
reports of antimicrobial treatment unable to completely
eliminate B. burgdorferi from the tissues of experimen-
tally

rodents
and
non-human
primates
(Bockenstedt et al., 2002; Hodzic et al., 2008; 2013;

 Embers et al., 2012; Wormser et al., 2012; Iyer et al.,
2013). In some instances, bacteria could be rescued
from treated animals by xenodiagnoses; these rescued
bacteria were non-culturable and displayed a decreased
infectious potential (Bockenstedt et al., 2002; Hodzic
et al., 2008; Embers et al., 2012). They appeared to be
transcriptionally active in the reservoir, could be trans-
mitted transstadially in ticks after xenodiagnoses, were
able to infect SCID mice and produce pathological
lesions, and could be transmitted by transplanted tissue
(Hodzic et al., 2008; Barthold et al., 2010b; Embers and
Barthold, 2012). This suggests that antimicrobial-tolerant
forms described in vitro may have relevance in explain-
ing their occurrence in the mammalian reservoir (Feng
et al., 2014; 2015a; 2016; Caskey and Embers, 2015;
Sharma et al., 2015).
Borrelia may become phenotypically (non-heritably)
tolerant to antimicrobials. For example, calprotectin, a
human
neutrophil
antibacterial
protein,
both
inhibits
borrelial growth in vitro and makes the organism tolerant
to penicillin (Lusitani et al., 2003; Montgomery et al.,
2006). Stationary phase B. burgdorferi cells in culture
can also become phenotypically tolerant to antimicro-
bials used in treating Lyme borreliosis such as ceftriax-
one, doxycycline and amoxicillin (Feng et al., 2014;
2015b; Caskey and Embers, 2015; Sharma et al.,
2015). This tolerance appears to be a function of both
cell concentration and growth phase, since experimental
and mathematical analyses show these antimicrobial-
tolerant
bacteria
to
represent
slow-growing
variants
whose prevalence is increased in the stationary phase
(Feng et al., 2014; 2015a; Caskey and Embers, 2015;
Sharma et al., 2015). RNAseq analysis also suggests
that borrelia, like other bacteria, probably have multiple
and redundant mechanisms to draw on for the develop-
ment of such tolerance to antimicrobials (Lewis, 2010;
Feng et al., 2015a; Mok et al., 2015). Intriguingly, B.
burgdorferi tolerant to doxycycline and amoxicillin appear
to have a pattern of gene modulation similar to that
seen with the stringent response (Feng et al., 2015a).
The term ‘bacterial persistence’ is used to describe
the ability of pathogenic bacteria (‘persisters’) to survive
in infected host tissues despite the presence of effective
levels of antimicrobials and antibacterial cellular and
humoral immunity (Lewis, 2010; Nguyen et al., 2011;
Balaban et al., 2013; Amato et al., 2014; Conlon et al.,
2015; Michiels et al., 2016). Though its applicability to
B. burgdorferi has been controversial (Wormser and
Schwartz, 2009; Wormser et al., 2012; Iyer et al., 2013),
persistence is a widely accepted phenomenon in micro-
biology which in some instances can have therapeutic
implications (Dahl et al., 2003; Lewis, 2010; Amato
et al., 2014; Zhang, 2014; Putrins et al., 2015; Brauner
et al., 2016; Chuang et al., 2016; Corrigan et al., 2016).
Persisters, while non-dividing, appear to be metabolically
active (Michiels et al., 2016). They are thus similar to
viable but non-culturable (VBNC) organisms but are pre-
sent at a lower concentration than VBNC organisms,
and potentially capable of being rescued by media with-
out antimicrobials and of generating colonies (Amato
et al., 2013; 2014; Amato and Brynildsen, 2014; Ayra-
petyan et al., 2015; Michiels et al., 2016; Orman et al.,
2016). Persisters also seem to be different from what
have been termed dormant bacteria with a decreased
rate of metabolism (Kim and Wood, 2017). Clearly,
much work needs to be done to clarify these phenotypic
differences. It should be noted that although persistence
is phenotypic, the presence of persisters can also facili-
tate
emergence
of
genetically
antimicrobial-resistant
bacteria, e.g., by mutation (Levin-Reisman et al., 2017).
It is also important to note that bacterial persistence
with tolerance to antimicrobials may be generated by
multiple and redundant mechanisms involving both regu-
latory and non-regulatory genes (Lewis, 2010; Zhang,
2014; Amato and Brynildsen, 2015; Feng et al., 2015a;
Mok et al., 2015; Brauner et al., 2016; Kaldalu et al.,
2016; Michiels et al., 2016). In E. coli and in many other
bacteria (e.g., Salmonella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis),
toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems have been widely character-
ized as responsible for stringent response-mediated
extracellular and intracellular persistence (Korch et al.,
2003; Germain et al., 2013; 2015; Maisonneuve et al.,
2013; Maisonneuve and Gerdes, 2014; Gerdes and
Maisonneuve, 2015; Harms et al., 2016). Because B.
burgdorferi does not appear to have conventional Types
I and II TA systems (most probably as a result of gene
loss associated with its small genome) (Fraser et al.,
1997; Makarova et al., 2009; Harms et al., 2016), unbal-
anced synthesis and hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp might act in
their place to promote a persister phenotype (Amato
and Brynildsen, 2015).
Increased frequency of persisters in B. burgdorferi
might result from increases in the levels of (p)ppGpp
generated by spontaneous variations in the synthetic/
hydrolytic activity of relBbu followed by slow growth and
tolerance to antimicrobials (Terekhova et al., 2002;
Bugrysheva et al., 2005; 2015; Kotte et al., 2014; Amato
and Brynildsen, 2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015). These
borrelia would be expected to have metabolic character-
istics of classical bacterial persisters in utilizing glycerol
and being tolerant to antimicrobial peptides, variations in
osmolarity, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
(Bugrysheva et al., 2005; 2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015).
That such a mechanism might be at work is suggested
by the observed increased frequency of persisters in
stationary phase cultures of B. burgdorferi, since the
observed levels of (p)ppGpp in B. burgdorferi are higher
in
this
growth
phase;

for

 variations in (p)ppGpp levels may also arise under these
conditions (Fig. 1) (Bugrysheva et al., 2005; 2015; Cas-
key and Embers, 2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015; Feng
et
al.,
2015a;
Sharma
et
al.,
2015).
Alternatively,
(p)ppGpp and DksA might play a role in B. burgdorferi
comparable to that in E. coli where they are involved in
mediating the increasing numbers of persisters gener-
ated during the diauxic shift from glycerol to trehalose
utilization (Amato and Brynildsen, 2015; Bugrysheva
et al., 2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015).
The ability to shift between different carbon sources
(diauxie), changes in intermediary metabolism, meta-
bolic challenges and exposure to human sera all appear
to play an important role in the evolution of persisters
(Amato et al., 2013; 2014; Amato and Brynildsen, 2014;
2015; Ayrapetyan et al., 2015; Mok et al., 2015; Putrins
et al., 2015). For example, independent modulation of
glycerol and trehalose metabolism in E. coli is related to
the
formation
of
persisters
(Spoering
et
al.,
2006;
Kuczynska-Wisnik et al., 2015). Such metabolic changes
in carbon utilization would be expected to occur in B.
burgdorferi as it traverses the enzootic cycle and would
therefore be expected to stimulate both the stringent
response and the formation of persisters (Fig. 2) (Tilly
et al., 2001; von Lackum and Stevenson, 2005; Rhodes
et al., 2009; He et al., 2011; Pappas et al., 2011; Bugry-
sheva et al., 2015; Corona and Schwartz, 2015; Dreck-
trah et al., 2015). The role these metabolic alterations
may play in the formation of persisters in B. burgdorferi
therefore deserves detailed examination (Amato and
Brynildsen, 2015; Corona and Schwartz, 2015; Troy
et al., 2016). In addition, B. burgdorferi CgtA is a
GTPase of the Obg family involved in (p)ppGpp degra-
dation. In other bacteria it is involved in persistence and
might be similarly involved in B. burgdorferi because its
repression by the stringent response might increase lev-
els of (p)ppGpp (Drecktrah et al., 2015; Gaca et al.,
2015a; Verstraeten et al., 2015; Steinchen and Bange,
2016).
Nutritional fluctuations in vertebrate tissues during
development of chronic infections might also trigger the
stringent response (Fig. 3) and create a bi-stable hetero-
geneous population of transcriptionally competent borre-
lia growing at different rates, with slow growing bacteria
becoming tolerant to antimicrobials and innate and
adaptive immunity (Kotte et al., 2014; Bugrysheva et al.,
2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015). In infected vertebrate
hosts, such refugia could be found in collagenous and
other avascular tissues where borrelia are not multiply-
ing. These tissues would include the aortic root, tendons
and entheses associated with joints, and synovial and
spinal fluids (Fig. 3) (Barthold et al., 2010b; Barbour,
2012; Bockenstedt et al., 2012; Embers and Barthold,
2012). In these tissues, host antibodies might increase
the nutritional stress of borrelia, for example, by blunting
uptake of oligopeptides and other essential substrates
by Opp and other unknown transporters whose genes
are induced by the borrelial stringent response (Wang
et al., 2002; Medrano et al., 2007; Barthold et al.,
2010a,b;
Raju
et
al.,
2011;
Hodzic
et
al.,
2014;
Bugrysheva et al., 2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015). The
stringent response, by its ability to generate persisters,
may thus be crucial for progression of B. burgdorferi
through its enzootic cycle.
Conclusions and outstanding questions
The ability of B. burgdorferi to utilize the stringent
response to mediate metabolic shifts during cycling
between its tick vector and its vertebrate reservoir likely
involves coordination between global regulators such as
Rel, RpoS, BosR, c-di-GMP
, BadR, CsrA and DksA (Tilly
et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2013; Novak et al., 2014;
Bugrysheva et al., 2015; Corona and Schwartz, 2015;
Drecktrah
et
al.,
2015;
Ouyang
and
Zhou,
2015;
Caimano et al., 2016). The role played by c-di-GMP in
the Hk1-Rrp1 pathway in motility and in glycerol and chi-
tobiose metabolism suggests that it has perhaps parallel
and coordinated functions to that of (p)ppGpp, albeit
most probably in response to different stimuli (Rhodes
et al., 2009; Sultan et al., 2010; He et al., 2011; Pappas
et al., 2011; Sze et al., 2013; Corona and Schwartz,
2015; Caimano et al., 2016). In Mycobacterium smeg-
matis, for example, increased levels of (p)ppGpp and c-
di-GMP act coordinately to decrease motility, facilitate
aggregation and biofilm formation, and increase toler-
ance to antimicrobials (Gupta et al., 2016). Similarly,
since null mutants of relBbu and RpoS increase the fre-
quency of round form morphotypes in vitro and in vivo
(Dunham-Ems et al., 2012; Drecktrah et al., 2015), they
might also act coordinately at specific stages to gener-
ate novel survival-related morphotypes during B. burg-
dorferi migration in nymphal ticks (Dunham-Ems et al.,
2012; Harms et al., 2016).
The global regulator DksA is an important factor in
persistence and virulence in a number of pathogens
(Amato and Brynildsen, 2015; Azriel et al., 2015; Holley
et al., 2015), and while the stringent response in B.
burgdorferi modulates production of DksA, it is not
known whether the regulation achieved by (p)ppGpp in
borrelia is due to interactions with DksA and RNA poly-
merase, or whether, as in other bacteria, an indepen-
dent alternative DksA regulon exists (Bugrysheva et al.,
2015; Holley et al., 2015). Similarly, identification of
sequences functionally homologous to discriminators in
the promoters of B. burgdorferi need further study
(Potrykus and Cashel, 2008). The stringent response,

 regulate expression of a succession of genes between
the different stages of infection in ticks and mammals,
with many common genes expressed across different
stages (Bugrysheva et al., 2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015;
Iyer et al., 2015). This ability creates a continuum of
gene regulation in response to nutritional and other chal-
lenges, and insures the successful perseverance of the
bacteria in its very demanding and complex enzootic
cycle. It thus appears to be another example of the role
the stringent response has in maintenance of the enzo-
otic
cycles
of
vector-transmitted
pathogens
(Charity
et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2009).
Both CsrA and the stringent response can modulate
borrelial motility (Sze et al., 2011; Bugrysheva et al.,
2015; Drecktrah et al., 2015). In E. coli, CsrA is also
involved in glucose utilization through the phosphotrans-
ferase system, a system also present in B. burgdorferi
(Corona and Schwartz, 2015; Leng et al., 2016). Because
the networks of these two global regulators are heavily
interlinked in other bacteria (where they also regulate vir-
ulence) (Edwards et al., 2011; Vinella et al., 2012;
Romeo et al., 2013; Vakulskas et al., 2015), future inves-
tigations of the interactions between CsrA and the borre-
lial stringent response would be of great interest. The
relevance of BadR, the growth phase regulator that upre-
gulates expression of Rel and downregulates RpoS
expression in B. burgdorferi should also be explored
given the centrality of the stringent response and its
potential interconnections with the two well-characterized
B. burgdorferi TCS axes (Miller et al., 2013; Ouyang and
Zhou, 2015; Iyer and Schwartz, 2016).
Since BadR and (p)ppGpp both repress expression of
genes involved in chitobiose utilization, it would clearly
be relevant to determine whether they do so indepen-
dently or if they constitute an epistatic regulatory cas-
cade (Miller et al., 2013; Bugrysheva et al., 2015;
Ouyang and Zhou, 2015). In B. burgdorferi as in other
bacteria, (p)ppGpp might be involved in global regulation
by
directly
binding
to
proteins
and
modifying
their
function, and pppGpp and ppGpp may have different
and independent regulatory roles (Rymer et al., 2012;
Mechold et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015). Global regulation
in B. burgdorferi by (p)ppGpp could also be mediated by
its ability to modulate RNA transcription initiation of pro-
moters depending on nucleotide concentrations (Krasny
and Gourse, 2004; Hauryliuk et al., 2015) as a function
of its ability to modify the GTP/ATP ratio by consumption
of GTP during its synthesis and its inhibition of GTPases
such as CgtA as is the case with other bacteria (Kriel
et al., 2014; Drecktrah et al., 2015; Gaca et al., 2015a;
Hauryliuk et al., 2015; Verstraeten et al., 2015).
If the stringent response is utilized in the enzootic life
cycle of borrelia as we and others have suggested
(Godfrey et al., 2002; Bugrysheva et al., 2005; 2015;
Drecktrah et al., 2015; Caimano et al., 2016), its mobili-
zation in different developmental stages and tissue types
in its arthropod hosts and primary mammalian reservoirs
can be expected to have been under strong evolutionary
pressure with respect to tissue tropism and timing
(Radolf et al., 2012; Caimano et al., 2016; Steere et al.,
2016). In dead-end mammalian hosts such as humans
which are not critical to the spirochete’s propagation, the
spirochete’s ability to evade immune responses and anti-
microbial treatment and take up residence in refugia
would, by implication, be a side effect of selection on
other traits (a ‘spandrel’ in the terminology of Gould and
Lewontin (1979)). Its incidental origin would make it no
less of a potential clinical problem if it were found to be
involved in manifestations of late Lyme disease such as
arthritis and post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome
(Steere et al., 1994; Chandra et al., 2011; Arvikar and
Steere, 2015; Steere et al., 2016).
Readily detectable borrelia tolerant to antimicrobials in
suspension cultures and biofilms in vitro (Terekhova
et al., 2002; Caskey and Embers, 2015; Feng et al.,
2015a Sharma et al., 2015), detection of B. burgdorferi
gene expression in tick stages (Iyer et al., 2015), devel-
opment of models of infection for vertebrate reservoirs,
including
potential
refugia
for
persister
spirochetes
(Akins et al., 1998; Zambrano et al., 2004; Cabello
et al., 2007; Iyer et al., 2015), and the appearance of
apparently quiescent round forms under several kinds of
environmental stresses (Brorson and Brorson, 1997;
Alban et al., 2000; Dunham-Ems et al., 2012; Drecktrah
et al., 2015; Meril€
ainen et al., 2015; Feng et al., 2016)
suggest that mechanisms of these potentially clinically
relevant
phenomena
may
eventually
be
discovered
(Bockenstedt et al., 2012; Marques et al., 2014; Steere
et al., 2016). For example, the genetic and metabolic
make-up of non-culturable B. burgdorferi tolerant to anti-
microbials
rescued
from
animals
by
xenodiagnoses
could provide insight into the relationship between toler-
ance and resistance to these compounds (Bockenstedt
et al., 2002; Embers et al., 2012; Marques et al., 2014).
The use of recently developed genomic tools (Lybecker
et al., 2014; Arnold et al., 2016; Wright et al., 2016;
Adams et al., 2017), should permit ready isolation of
multiple mutants of B. burgdorferi global regulators
including relBbu that will allow assessment of their hierar-
chic order in gene regulation by epistasis and their role
in borrelial permanence in the enzootic cycle and borre-
lial persistence in vitro and in vivo (Avery and Wasser-
man, 1992; Phillips, 2008). Dissection of these networks
of interactions among global regulators of B. burgdorferi
is essential for understanding the ability of this organism
to persist in its hosts, its vectors and its enzootic cycle
(Corona and Schwartz, 2015; Iyer et al., 2015), and
