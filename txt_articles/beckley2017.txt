IMPORTANCE Lead is a neurotoxin with well-documented effects on health. Research
suggests that lead may be associated with criminal behavior. This association is difficult to
disentangle from low socioeconomic status, a factor in both lead exposure and criminal
offending.
OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that a higher childhood blood lead level (BLL) is associated
with greater risk of criminal conviction, recidivism (repeat conviction), conviction for violent
offenses, and variety of self-reported criminal offending in a setting where BLL was not
associated with low socioeconomic status.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 553 individuals participated in a prospective
study based on a population-representative cohort born between April 1, 1972, and March 31,
1973, from New Zealand; the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study
observed participants to age 38 years (December 2012). Statistical analysis was performed
from November 10, 2016, to September 5, 2017.
EXPOSURES Blood lead level measured at age 11 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Official criminal conviction cumulative to age 38 years (data
collected in 2013), single conviction or recidivism, conviction for nonviolent or violent crime,
and self-reported variety of crime types at ages 15, 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 years.
RESULTS Participants included 553 individuals (255 female and 298 male participants) who
had their blood tested for lead at age 11 years. The mean (SD) BLL at age 11 years was 11.01
(4.62) μg/dL. A total of 154 participants (27.8%) had a criminal conviction, 86 (15.6%) had
recidivated, and 53 (9.6%) had a violent offense conviction. Variety scores for self-reported
offending ranged from 0 to 10 offense types at each assessment; higher numbers indicated
greater crime involvement. Self-reported offending followed the well-established age-crime
curve (ie, the mean [SD] variety of self-reported offending increased from 1.99 [2.82] at age
15 years to its peak of 4.24 [3.15] at age 18 years and 4.22 [3.02] at age 21 years and declined
thereafter to 1.10 [1.59] at age 38 years). Blood lead level was a poor discriminator between
no conviction and conviction (area under the curve, 0.58). Overall, associations between BLL
and conviction outcomes were weak. The estimated effect of BLL was lower for recidivism
than for single convictions and lower for violent offending than for nonviolent offending.
Sex-adjusted associations between BLL reached statistical significance for only 1 of the 6
self-reported offending outcomes at age 15 years (r = 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.18; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study overcomes past limitations of studies of BLL and
crime by studying the association in a place and time where the correlation was not
confounded by childhood socioeconomic status. Findings failed to support a dose-response
association between BLL and consequential criminal offending.

ecent discoveries of elevated lead levels in the
drinking water of several US cities have prompted
researchers to reexamine the long-term effects of
lead exposure.1-4 Childhood lead exposure has been associ-
ated with abnormalities in brain structures, such as the
hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and with disrupted neu-
ronal development, myelination, and neurochemical
processing.5-7 Lead exposure has also been associated with
childhood behavioral problems and lasting declines in
intelligence.8-10 One hypothesized behavioral effect of high
levels of lead exposure is increased antisocial and criminal
behavior.11 Criminal offending carries consequences for
offenders’life outcomes, including employment, family life,
and life expectancy.12-14 Research has found that individuals
with elevated childhood blood lead levels (BLLs) show
increased criminal offending throughout adulthood.15-19
Aggregate-level research has also linked estimated exposure
to environmental lead with higher rates of crime.20-27 One of
the most intriguing propositions is that declines in US chil-
dren’
s BLLs, which began in the 1970s as lead was gradually
removed from the environment, contributed to lower rates
of crime across the United States as the children became
adolescents during the mid-1990s.11,28,29
Somefindings,however,indicatethatpaststudiesmayhave
yielded inaccurate estimations of the true associations be-
tween lead and health and behavioral outcomes owing to con-
founding by low socioeconomic status.30,31 New Zealand’
s
Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study
(Dunedin Study) offers the opportunity to study the effects of
lead in the body on crime, independent of socioeconomic sta-
tus. In the Dunedin Study, as previously reported, childhood
BLLs were representative of the BLLs of New Zealand children
and were not associated with childhood socioeconomic
status.9,32,33 New Zealand has a reputation as a “green” (envi-
ronmentally friendly) country, but during the Dunedin Study
cohort’
s childhood in the 1970s and 1980s, there was evidence
oftheassociationbetweenleadedgasolineandelevatedBLLs.34
The BLL measure used in this article has provided evidence, in
the Dunedin cohort, of associations between higher childhood
BLL and lower midlife IQ and higher childhood BLL and socio-
economic attainment.9 This study tested the hypothesis that
BLL is positively associated with crime.
InadditiontotestingwhetherBLLisassociatedwithcrimi-
nal conviction, this study tested 3 additional hypotheses about
crime. First, based on results of past research,19 we tested the
hypothesis that BLL is associated with a greater likelihood of
recidivistic vs one-time criminal conviction. Many people who
experience a criminal conviction never recidivate (have a re-
peat conviction from a new court case); some, however, do
recidivate.35 Recidivating offenders may be etiologically dif-
ferent from one-time offenders and are a concern of the crimi-
nal justice system.36,37 Second, research has also found a spe-
cific link between lead and violence,27,38 leading us to test the
hypothesis that BLL is associated with a greater likelihood of
conviction for violent vs nonviolent offenses. Third, we tested
the hypothesis that higher BLL is associated with more self-
reported offending (ie, offenses committed as reported by a
respondent, regardless of criminal conviction). It is well
establishedthatmoreself-reportedoffendingisassociatedwith
increased risk of criminal conviction, but most offenses go
undetected.39 Self-reports of offending may provide a more
complete picture of the social burden imposed by an individu-
al’
s offending whether or not it resulted in an official record.
Methods
Sample
Participants were members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary
Health and Development Study, a longitudinal investigation
of health and behavior. The full cohort (1037 of 1139
[91.0% of eligible births]; 535 male [51.6%]) included all of the
individuals born between April 1, 1972, and March 31, 1973, in
Dunedin, New Zealand, who were eligible based on residence
in the province and who participated in the first assessment
at age 3 years. The cohort represented the full range of socio-
economic status in the general population of New Zealand’
s
South Island.40 On adult health, the cohort matches the New
Zealand National Health and Nutrition Survey on key health
indicators (eg, body mass index, smoking, and physician
visits).40 The cohort is primarily white, matching the demo-
graphics of the South Island.40 Assessments were carried out
at birth and ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 years,
when 961 of the 1007 participants who were still alive (95.4%)
took part. Written informed consent was obtained from par-
ticipants, and ethical approval for each assessment phase was
obtained from the Otago Research Ethics Committee.
Blood Lead Level
Approximately 30 mL of venous blood was collected from each
11-year-old child who participated in the assessment (carried
out at the Research Unit) and who freely agreed to give blood;
579 of the 803 children (72.1%) in attendance agreed to give
blood. An additional 122 children, aged 11 years and tending
to live outside city limits, were assessed in their schools, where
blood could not be drawn. Whole-blood samples were ana-
lyzed through graphite furnace atomic absorption spectro-
photometry. Blood lead level is reported in micrograms per
deciliter (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by
0.0483). Details on the method of blood collection, division,
Key Points
Question Is childhood lead exposure associated with criminal
offending in a setting where the degree of lead exposure was
not confounded by socioeconomic status?
Findings In this cohort study of 553 New Zealanders observed for
38 years, lead exposure in childhood was weakly associated with
official criminal conviction and self-reported offending from ages
15 to 38 years. Lead exposure was not associated with the
consequential offending outcomes of a greater variety of offenses,
conviction, recidivism, or violence.
Meaning Responses toward lead exposure should focus on
consequences for health, not potential consequences for crime.

Criminal Offending
Official conviction records were obtained through a search of
the central computer system of the New Zealand police, which
provides details of all New Zealand convictions and Austra-
lian convictions communicated to the New Zealand police.
Searches for all convictions occurring from the age from which
conviction was permissible (14 years) were conducted after
each assessment at ages 21, 26, 32, and 38 years (search com-
pleted in 2013). Conviction was coded as 1 for convicted par-
ticipantsandas0forunconvictedparticipants.Subgroupswere
one-time offenders vs those who recidivated and partici-
pants convicted only of nonviolent crime vs those convicted
of a violent crime.
A self-reported offending interview was administered at
ages 15, 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 years using a 1-year retrospec-
tive window at each wave. Four types of offenses were as-
sessed. Property offenses included items such as vandalism,
breaking and entering, motor vehicle theft, embezzlement,
shoplifting, and fraud. Rule offenses included items such as
reckless driving, public drunkenness, soliciting or selling sex,
giving false information on a loan or job application, and dis-
obeying court orders. Drug-related offenses included using
and selling various types of illicit drugs. Violent offenses
includeditemsaboutsimpleandaggravatedassault,gangfight-
ing, robbery, arson, and forced sex. We used offense items to
create a variety score of self-reported offending. Variety scores
are calculated by summing 1 point for a “yes” response to each
different offense. Variety scores typically correlate with
frequency,42 but the variety score is preferred over frequency
because variety is less skewed, does not overweight trivial of-
fenses, and is less affected by recall errors (eg, “Have you shop-
lifted?”ismoreaccuratelyrecalledthan“Howmanytimeshave
you shoplifted?”).43,44 The variety scores ranged from 0 to 30
offensetypes;highernumbersindicatedgreatercrimeinvolve-
ment.Toeliminatepotentialnullfindingsowingtoskewinself-
reported offending, we winsorized self-reported offending
variety scores at 10, which is the 90th percentile or higher self-
reported offending variety score for each age. Results using the
fullvarietyscalesdidnotsubstantivelydifferfromresultsusing
the winsorized scales (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Self-
reported offending across interviews at ages 15, 18, 21, 26, 32,
and 38 years followed the universal age-crime curve36,45; that
is, the mean (SD) variety of self-reported offending increased
from 1.99 (2.82) at age 15 years to its peak of 4.24 (3.15) at
age 18 years and 4.22 (3.02) at age 21 years and declined there-
after to 1.10 (1.59) at age 38 years (Table).
Potential Confounders
Analyses were adjusted for sex. As in prior studies, boys in the
cohort had more criminal offending and slightly higher child-
hood BLLs than did girls (Figure 1).9,44,46 Control for sex was
indicated because a male excess of both BLLs and offending
could yield spurious associations in the cohort. In addition,
higher BLLs and higher rates of crime are usually more likely
to be found among children who come from families with low
socioeconomicstatus.30,45However,wereportinFigure146the
null association between childhood socioeconomic status and
BLLs in this cohort (this null association was previously re-
ported for the subsample of the Dunedin Study having
IQ data9).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed from November 10, 2016,
to September 5, 2017. The analytic sample for this study was
553 participants. Starting with the 579 participants with BLL
data at age 11 years, we excluded 26 individuals who did not
consent to criminal record searching or did not survive to the
age at which we first obtained consent for searches (21 years).
To test whether the participants who were tested for lead were
representative of the untested cohort who met inclusion cri-
teria, we compared the analytic sample of 553 with the sub-
sample of 414 without BLL data. Participants who were tested
for lead did not differ significantly from untested children on
official criminal conviction, self-reported offending, sex, or
childhoodsocioeconomicstatus.Becauseruralchildrentended
to be seen at their schools at age 11 years (where lead could not
be tested), more children tested for lead lived in town, and the
children tested for lead had a 2-points-higher childhood IQ
(eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Study members with BLLs higher than 23 μg/dL (n = 10)
were referred for medical evaluation, following the recom-
mended clinical protocol at that time, and may have been
treated.41 We have retained these study members in our analy-
sis as their removal did not substantively alter results.
We calculated descriptive statistics for the complete ana-
lytic sample and also by BLL (in approximately 5-μg/dL
groups). We analyzed the accuracy of BLLs to discriminate
between no conviction and conviction using receiver operat-
ing characteristic curves and area under the curve (AUC). As
a comparison, we included the receiver operating character-
istic curve and AUC for male sex and a model that combined
male sex and BLL. The receiver operating characteristic
curve plots the estimated true-positive (sensitivity) and
false-positive (1 − specificity) rates for conviction. The AUC
is an indicator of accuracy. An AUC value of 0.5 indicates
that model variables are no better at estimating the outcome
than random chance. An AUC value of 1 indicates that model
variables perfectly estimate the outcome.
We tested the associations between childhood BLLs and
measures of offending using regression models (Table). Using
logistic regression models, we estimated the odds ratio (OR)
of criminal conviction by BLL. Using multinomial logistic re-
gression models, we estimated the OR of being a one-time of-
fender or recidivating vs being a nonoffender by BLL and the
ORofbeinganonviolentoffenderoraviolentoffendervsbeing
a nonoffender by BLL. Blood lead level was analyzed as a con-
tinuous measure; however, it is presented in 5-μg/dL units in
the Table, the current reference level for clinical attention and
therefore a measure that is meaningful to clinicians and poli-
cymakers. Moreover, 5 μg/dL represents approximately 1 SD
of BLL in the cohort. We estimated the amount of self-
reported offending at each assessment age by BLL using ordi-
nary least squares regression. For self-reported offending, all

 model variables were standardized so that the results could be
interpreted as correlation coefficients (r). All models were ad-
justed for the effect of sex; adjusted and unadjusted results
arepresentedintheTable.Modelfitstatisticsandtestsofmodel
fit contrasting adjusted with unadjusted models are in eTable

In sensitivity analyses, we subjected the BLL measure to a
logarithmic transformation and a correction for hematocrit
levels47; the results did not differ substantively from the re-
sults reported here (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Statistical
analyses were conducted in R, version 3.4.0 (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing) using the nnet48 and pROC49 packages.
Results
Childhood BLLs ranged from 4.00 to 31.00 μg/dL, with a mean
(SD) BLL of 11.01 (4.62) μg/dL (Table). There was no signifi-
cant socioeconomic gradient in lead exposure in the cohort
children(r < −0.001;95%CI,−0.08to0.08;P = .99).HighBLLs
were observed among children from all socioeconomic status
groups (Figure 1).46 A total of 154 participants (27.8%) had a
criminal conviction, 68 (12.3%) were one-time offenders, 86
(15.6%) had recidivated, 101 (18.3%) were nonviolent offend-
ers, and 53 (9.6%) were violent offenders.
Criminal conviction was more prevalent and more fre-
quent at higher BLLs: 8 of 33 participants (24.2%) with a BLL
of 5 μg/dL or less had a criminal conviction compared with 24
of 82 participants (29.3%) with a BLL above 15 μg/dL (Table).
ThereceiveroperatingcharacteristiccurveAUC(Figure2),how-
ever, showed that BLL alone poorly discriminated between no
convictionandconviction.Thatis,atnopointorthresholdwas
BLL capable of distinguishing no conviction from conviction
with dependable accuracy. The accuracy of male sex ex-
ceeded that of BLL, and BLL contributed a minimal increase
in accuracy beyond that of male sex.
Logistic regression models supported the positive asso-
ciation between BLL and conviction, but sex-adjusted results
failed to reach statistical significance (Table). Specifically, each
5-μg/dL higher BLL was significantly associated with a 1.29 in-
crease in the odds of criminal conviction (95% CI, 1.06-1.56;
P = .01). After controlling for sex, the association between BLL

Analysis of recidivism revealed that BLL was not signifi-
cantly associated with the odds of recidivism (conviction sub-
group comparison 1 in the Table). Blood lead level was not sig-
nificantly associated with being a one-time offender (OR, 1.29;
95% CI, 0.99-1.68; P = .06; adjusted OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.95-
1.64; P = .11). Initially, when comparing offenders who recidi-
vated with nonoffenders, each 5-μg/dL-higher BLL was sig-
nificantly associated with a 1.28 increase in the odds of being
a recidivating offender (95% CI, 1.01-1.63; P = .046). How-
ever, after controlling for sex, the association between higher
BLL and being a recidivating offender was slightly attenuated
andnotstatisticallysignificant(adjustedOR,1.21;95%CI,0.93-
1.57; P = .15). In each of the models, the estimated OR was
slightly lower for being a recidivating offender than for being
a one-time offender.
Analysis of violence revealed that BLL was not signifi-
cantly associated with conviction for violence (conviction sub-
group comparison 2 in the Table), although it was associated
with conviction for nonviolent offenses. Comparing nonvio-
lentoffenderswithnonoffenders,each5-μg/dL-higherBLLwas
significantlyassociatedwitha1.33increaseintheoddsofbeing

sociation remained significant after controlling for sex (OR,

cantly associated with being a violent offender, and the esti-
mated OR was slightly lower than that for being a nonviolent
offender(OR,1.20;95%CI,0.89-1.62;P = .24;adjustedOR,1.13;
95% CI, 0.82-1.55; P = .45).
The variety of self-reported offenses was weakly associ-
ated with BLL and only reached statistical significant at ages
15, 18, and 26 years (Table). After controlling for sex, the as-
sociation between higher BLL and variety of self-reported of-
fenses remained weak and was statistically significant only at
assessment age 15 years (r = 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.18; P = .02).
Discussion
This study is, to our knowledge, the only study to examine the
association between childhood BLL and criminal offending in
a cohort in which the association is not linked with social class.
We found weak associations between BLL and criminal of-

A, Distribution of blood lead levels by sex (553 participants). Mean blood lead
level is lower for female participants (10.51 μg/dL [to convert to micromoles per
liter, multiply by 0.0483]) compared with male participants (11.44 μg/dL;
P = .02). B, A total of 109 participants from families with low socioeconomic
status. C, A total of 1355 participants from families with middle socioeconomic
status. D, A total of 189 participants from families with high socioeconomic
status. Low, middle, and high socioeconomic statuses are based on the 6-point
Elley-Irving scale46 (categories 1 and 2 [low status], 3 and 4 [middle status], and
5 and 6 [high status]), which codes the occupations of the study members’
parents and their associated income and educational levels. There was no
significant socioeconomic gradient in lead exposure in the cohort children
(r < −0.001; 95% CI, −0.08 to 0.08; P = .99). High blood lead levels were
observed in all status groups. The box and whisker plots show the median
(vertical black line inside the box), lower and upper interquartile ranges (IQRs;
left and right borders of the box), lower-bound value equal to the 25th
percentile minus 150% of the IQR and upper-bound value equal to the 75th
percentile plus 150% of the IQR (whiskers), and outlier observations (circles).
The histogram interval bins represent whole integers of blood lead level.

 fending. Blood lead level was associated with criminal con-
viction at chance levels and was outperformed by male sex.
Contrarytoexpectations,theestimatedeffectofBLLwaslower
for recidivism than for 1-time conviction and lower for vio-
lent than nonviolent offending. Associations with self-
reported offending were weak and, with the exception of age
15 years, not statistically significant. Our results failed to sup-
port a consistent dose-response association between BLL and
criminal offending, measured through official reports and self-
reports, from adolescence to adulthood. This finding does not
negate the evidence of the detrimental health effects of lead.
At-risk children should continue to be tested for lead, and ef-
forts to reduce lead exposure should continue.
Our findings of a tenuous association between BLL and
criminal offending run contrary to past research, which has
shownadose-responseassociationbetweenBLLandcrime.15-19
Our findings are unlikely owing to poor-quality measure-
ment of BLL because past research from the Dunedin Study
that used the same measure of BLL as used in the present study
found that higher childhood BLL was associated with de-
clines in intelligence test scores and downward social mobil-
ity at age 38 years.9
Our results may be owing to the absence of 3 factors
found to be problematic in past studies indicating dose-
response effects of BLL. First, past studies of the association
between BLL and crime, in which high BLL and low socio-
economic status were associated, may not have completely
overcome confounding.30,31 Second, many past studies of
the association between BLL and crime used high-risk or
clinical samples, which meta-analysis has shown to yield
higher effects of BLL on crime.50 Third, past longitudinal
studies of the association between BLL and crime have
notable attrition, which may upwardly bias estimates if indi-
viduals with high BLL and low crime rates or individuals
with low BLL and high crime rates disproportionately leave
the sample.
Limitations
This study has limitations. First, BLL was measured at only 1
point, age 11 years. Multiple BLL measures are desirable.
However, evidence indicates that the mean of BLL measure-
ments across childhood can yield results similar to those
from a single, later-childhood measurement, as used here.51
Past research analyzing multiple BLL measures from early to
middle childhood also found the strongest effects among
BLL measurements most proximal to the outcome, as we
found with self-reported offending at age 15 years.52,53 Sec-
ond, this study’
s findings may not generalize to nonwhite
children. High BLLs are prevalent among children in many
non-Western countries and in African American children in
the United States.54,55 There is currently no evidence to sug-
gest that racial or ethnic groups differ on lead metabolism.
In the United States specifically, the effects of lead may be
amplified by the stress of racial disparity and discrimination
or by malnutrition, which are often experienced by African
American children.5,56 Third, the study was also predomi-
nantly of children from nonrural areas. Mean BLL in the
Dunedin Study, 11.01 μg/dL, was comparable with BLLs in
other developed locations in the 1980s, but this BLL limits
our ability to make inferences about the effects of lower
BLLs seen in present-day US children.54 Fourth, our crime
outcomes were assessed at age 15 years and older; there is
evidence that elevated BLLs are associated with childhood
and preteen problem behaviors.52,54
Conclusions
This study fails to support a dose-response association
between BLL and criminal offending in a sample in which
there was no association between BLL and childhood socio-
economic status. Previously detected associations between
BLL and criminal offending may be owing to the toxic effect
of lead disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups.
Responses toward lead exposure should focus on health
consequences, not potential criminal consequences.

Blood lead level and male sex
We assessed the ability of blood lead levels to discriminate between no
conviction and conviction. The area under the curve (AUC) is an indicator of a
model’
s accuracy. An AUC value of 0.5 (the diagonal line) indicates poor
accuracy; that is, the model variables are no better at estimating the outcome
than random chance. Points above the diagonal represent better-than-random
accuracy at estimating the outcome. An AUC value of 1 indicates perfect
accuracy. Blood lead level (AUC, 0.58) was a poorer discriminator between no
conviction and conviction in the Dunedin cohort than was male sex (AUC, 0.66)
and added little to the model beyond sex (AUC for blood lead level and
male sex, 0.69).
