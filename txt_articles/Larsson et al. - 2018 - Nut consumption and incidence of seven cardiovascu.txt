background nut consumption has been found to 
be inversely associated with cardiovascular disease 
mortality, but the association between nut consumption 
and incidence of specific cardiovascular diseases is 
unclear. We examined the association between nut 
consumption and incidence of seven cardiovascular 
diseases.
Methods this prospective study included 61 364 
swedish adults who had completed a Food Frequency 
Questionnaire and were followed up for 17 years 
through linkage with the swedish national Patient and 
Death registers.
results nut consumption was inversely associated 
with risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial 
fibrillation and abdominal aortic aneurysm in the age-
adjusted and sex-adjusted analysis. however, adjustment 
for multiple risk factors attenuated these associations 
and only a linear, dose–response, association with atrial 
fibrillation (ptrend=0.004) and a non-linear association 
(pnon-linearity=0.003) with heart failure remained. compared 
with no consumption of nuts, the multivariable hrs 
(95% ci) of atrial fibrillation across categories of nut 
consumption were 0.97 (0.93 to 1.02) for 1–3 times/
month, 0.88 (0.79 to 0.99) for 1–2 times/week and 
0.82 (0.68 to 0.99) for ≥3 times/week. For heart failure, 
the corresponding hrs (95% ci) were 0.87 (0.80 to 
0.94), 0.80 (0.67 to 0.97) and 0.98 (0.76 to 1.27). nut 
consumption was not associated with risk of aortic valve 
stenosis, ischaemic stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage.
Conclusions these findings suggest that nut 
consumption or factors associated with this nutritional 
behaviour may play a role in reducing the risk of atrial 
fibrillation and possibly heart failure.

InTroduCTIon
Nuts are rich sources of unsaturated fatty acids, 
protein, fibre, minerals (eg, magnesium, potassium 
and zinc), vitamin E, folate and other bioactive 
compounds such as phenolics and phytosterols.1 
Nut consumption may influence cardiovascular 
health by improving blood lipid levels1 2 and endo-
thelial function,3 reducing the risk of weight gain,4 
and via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.1 
Meta-analyses of prospective studies have shown 
that nut consumption is inversely associated with 
death from cardiovascular disease (CVD), total 
coronary heart disease and total stroke.5–7 Data 
from prospective studies on nut consumption in 
relation to incidence of specific CVD outcomes, 
such as myocardial infarction,8 9 heart failure,10 11 
atrial fibrillation,12 aortic valve stenosis and abdom-
inal aortic aneurysm are scarce.
To further evaluate the potential role of nut 
consumption for prevention of CVD and in 
particular to elucidate whether there are CVD 
outcome-specific 
associations, 
we 
used 
data 
from two population-based cohort studies of 
Swedish adults. We investigated the association 
of nut consumption with incidence of seven CVD 
outcomes.
MeThods
study population
The study population for the present study was 
participants of the Cohort of Swedish Men and the 
Swedish Mammography Cohort. In the autumn of 
1997, 48 850 men (born 1918–1952) and 39 227 
women (born 1914–1948) from three Swedish 
counties completed a questionnaire that sought 
information on diet, lifestyle and other risk factors 
for chronic diseases. For this analysis, we excluded 
participants with a missing or an erroneous personal 
identity number (a unique number assigned to each 
Swedish resident at birth), those with prevalent 
CVD or cancer recorded in the Swedish registers, 
those with extreme energy intake (ie, 3 SD from 
the loge-transformed mean energy intake among 
men and women separately), and those who did 
not answer the question about nut consumption 
(online supplementary figure S1). This left 61 364 
participants (32 911 men and 28 453 women), aged 
45–83 years, for analyses. 
exposure assessment
Participants completed a baseline questionnaire that 
inquired about diet, smoking status and history, 
weight, height, physical activity, alcohol consump-
tion, family history of myocardial infarction, 
aspirin use and history of diabetes, hypertension 
and hypercholesterolaemia. We defined a history of 
diabetes based on self-report or a previous (before 
baseline) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes recorded in 
the Swedish National Patient or Diabetes Registers. 
The average consumption of nuts/almonds (here-
after referred to as nuts) and other foods and food 
items during the previous year was assessed with a 
96-item Food Frequency Questionnaire. Nuts did 
not include coconut or chestnut. Participants could 
choose from eight predefined frequency categories 
of nut consumption (none, 1–3 times/month, 1–2 
times/week, 3–4 times/week, 5–6, times/week, 1 
time/day, 2 times/day and ≥3 
times/day).

Cardiac risk factors and prevention
Case ascertainment
Cases of CVD were ascertained through linkage with the Swedish 
National Patient and Cause of Death Registers (using the unique 
personal identity number assigned to each Swedish resident) 
and classified according to the International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision codes. The endpoints in the present 
study were acute myocardial infarction (I21), heart failure (I50 
and I11.0), atrial fibrillation (I48), aortic valve stenosis (I35.0 
and I35.2), abdominal aortic aneurysm (I71.3 and I71.4), isch-
aemic stroke (I63)and intracerebral haemorrhage (I61). We 
further divided myocardial infarction into non-fatal and fatal 
events. Fatal myocardial infarction was defined as death from 
myocardial infarction within 28 days from the event. The validity 
of diagnoses in the Swedish National Patient Register is high, 
with a positive predictive value close to 100% for some diseases 
(eg, myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation) and >85% for 
many other diagnoses.13
statistical analysis
Person-time of follow-up for each participant was calculated 
from 1 January 1998 to the date of diagnosis of each endpoint, 
date of death or 31 December 2014, whichever occurred first. 
Participants were classified into one of the following categories 
of nut consumption: none, 1–3 times/month, 1–2 times/week 
and ≥3 
times/week. HRs with their 95% CIs for each endpoint by 
categories of nut consumption were estimated using Cox propor-
tional hazards models with age as the time scale and stratified 
by sex. The first multivariable model was additionally adjusted 
for education (less than high school, high school or university), 
family history of myocardial infarction before 60 years of age 
(yes/no), smoking (never, past <20 pack-years, past ≥20 pack-
years, current <20 pack-years or current ≥20 pack-years), 
walking/bicycling (almost never, <20 
min/day, 20–40 
min/day 
or >40 
min/day), exercise (<1 
hour/week, 1–2 
hours/week, 
3–4 
hours/week or ≥5 
hours/week), aspirin use (never, 1–6 
tablets/week or ≥7 
tablets/week) and consumption of alcohol 
(never drinkers, past drinkers or current drinkers of <1 
drink/
week, 1–6 drinks/week, 7–14 drinks/week, 14–21 drinks/week 
or >21 
drinks/week), fruits (quintiles), vegetables (quintiles) 
and total energy (kcal/day; continuous). A second multivariable 
model further adjusted for potential intermediates of the associ-
ation between nut consumption and CVD, including body mass 
index (weight divided by the square of height (kg/m2): <22.5, 
22.5–24.9, 25.0–29.9 or ≥30.0), history of diabetes (yes/no), 
history of hypertension (yes/no) and history of hypercholestero-
laemia (yes/no). A separate missing category for each covariable 
was used to handle missing data (<5% missing). We considered 
adjustment for other foods and beverages, including whole grain 
foods, low-fat dairy products, fish, processed and unprocessed 
red meat, chocolate, sweets, and sweetened beverages. Because 
adjustment for these foods did not alter the results, they were 
not included in the multivariable model. The proportionality 
assumption was verified using Schoenfeld residuals.
To test for a linear trend, we assigned the midpoint to each 
category of nut consumption and modelled this variable as a 
continuous variable. In a sensitivity analysis, we excluded indi-
viduals with a history of diabetes at baseline as they may have 
changed their nut consumption after the diagnosis. Furthermore, 
we conducted a sensitivity analysis with follow-up time restricted 
to 10 years. The rationale for this is that the impact of regression 
dilution bias due to changes in nut consumption would be less 
with shorter follow-up. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis 
excluding the first 2 
years of follow-up to evaluate potential bias 
due to reverse causality. All statistical tests were two sided and p 
values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The 
analyses were conducted using SAS V
. 9.4 and Stata V
.14.2.
resulTs
Characteristics of study participants by categories of nut 
consumption are shown in table 1. Compared with non-con-
sumers of nuts, those with high nut consumption were more 
likely to have a postsecondary education and to be physically 
active, but were less likely to be current smokers and to have a 
history of hypertension. Those with high nut consumption were 
also, on average, younger and had lower body mass index and 
higher consumption of alcohol, fruits and vegetables compared 
with non-consumers of nut. There was a U-shaped association 
between nut consumption and history of diabetes.

Cardiac risk factors and prevention
The number of incident CVD events ascertained during 17 
years of follow-up of 61 364 participants was 4983 for myocar-
dial infarction (4066 non-fatal and 917 fatal), 3160 for heart 
failure, 7550 for atrial fibrillation, 972 for aortic valve stenosis, 
983 for abdominal aortic aneurysm, 3782 for ischaemic stroke 
and 543 for intracerebral haemorrhage.
In the age-adjusted and sex-adjusted analysis, nut consumption 
was inversely associated with risk of total and non-fatal myocar-
dial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and abdominal 
aortic aneurysm (table 2). Adjustment for multiple risk factors 
attenuated these associations and only a linear, dose–response, 
association with atrial fibrillation (ptrend=0.004) and a non-linear 
association (pnon-linearity=0.003) with heart failure remained in 
the fully adjusted model (multivariable model 2) (table 2). The 
main confounder was education in the analysis of myocardial 
infarction and fruit consumption in the analysis of abdominal 
aortic aneurysm. Compared with no nut consumption, the HRs 
of atrial fibrillation across categories of nut consumption were 
0.97 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.02) for 1–3 times/month, 0.88 (95% 
CI 0.79 to 0.99) for 1–2 times/week and 0.82 (95% CI 0.68 to 
0.99) for ≥3 
times/week. For heart failure, the corresponding 
HRs were 0.87 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.94), 0.80 (95% CI 0.67 to 
0.97) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.27). Nut consumption was not 
associated with risk of aortic valve stenosis, ischaemic stroke or 
intracerebral haemorrhage (table 2 and figure 1). Each additional 
portion of nuts per week was associated with a 4% reduction in 
risk of atrial fibrillation, but was not significantly associated with 
the other CVD outcomes (figure 1).
In sensitivity analyses, the results for all CVD outcomes were 
similar after exclusion of individuals with a history of diabetes 
(online supplementary table S1) or when the follow-up time was 
restricted to 10 years (online supplementary table S2). Likewise, 
omitting the first 2 
years of follow-up did not change the results 
appreciably (online supplementary table S3).
In analyses stratified by sex, nut consumption was inversely 
associated with risk of atrial fibrillation in both men and women 
but results did not attain statistical significance (online supple-
mentary figure S2). A borderline statistically significant associ-
ation between nut consumption and risk of abdominal aortic 
aneurysm was observed in women but not in men (p-interaction 
by sex=0.02) (online supplementary figure S2).
dIsCussIon
In this large prospective study, we observed a previously unrec-
ognised inverse association between nut consumption and 
incident atrial fibrillation, which remained after adjustment 
for multiple risk factors. Nut consumption ≥3 
times/week was 
associated with an 18% reduced risk of atrial fibrillation. We 
also observed inverse associations of nut consumption with risk 
of total and non-fatal myocardial infarction, heart failure and 
abdominal aortic aneurysm after adjustment for age and sex 
only. However, adjustment for other risk factors attenuated 
these associations and only a non-linear association with heart 
failure persisted. Nut consumption was not associated with risk 
of fatal myocardial infarction, aortic valve stenosis, ischaemic 
stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage.
Few prospective studies and randomised trials have reported 
on the association between nut consumption and incidence of 
specific CVD outcomes, and the findings are inconsistent. Nut 
consumption was not associated with risk of non-fatal myocar-
dial infarction,9 heart failure11 or atrial fibrillation12 in the Physi-
cians’ Health Study or with heart failure in the Atherosclerosis 
Risk in Community Study.10 The Adventist Health Study showed 
an inverse association between nut consumption and risk of 
non-fatal myocardial infarction but the number of cases was 
limited (n=134).8 The PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea 
(PREDIMED) randomised controlled trial, a Mediterranean 
diet supplemented with mixed nuts, compared with a control 
diet (reduced fat diet), did not significantly reduce the risk of 
the non-primary endpoints of myocardial infarction (n=69 
total 
cases in the nut and control groups; HR 0.74, 95% 
CI 0.46 to 
1.19),14 heart failure (n=65 cases; HR 0.92, 95% 
CI 0.56 to 
1.49)15 or atrial fibrillation (n=181 cases; HR 0.89, 95% 
CI 
0.65 to 1.20).16 However, with such small incidence numbers, 
there is a high risk of statistical type 2 error. While results on nut 
consumption and incidence of myocardial infarction are incon-
clusive, the overall evidence indicates that nut consumption 
is inversely associated with mortality from CVD,5–7 in partic-
ular coronary heart disease.5 In a meta-analysis of 11 prospec-
tive studies, the HR of coronary heart disease was 0.76 (95% 
CI 0.69 to 0.84) for the highest versus lowest category of nut 
consumption.5
The association between nut consumption and abdominal 
aortic aneurysm was examined in a retrospective cohort of 
3.1 
million US adults who were evaluated by ultrasound imaging 
for the presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.17 In that large 
study, consumption of nuts >3 
times/week was associated with 
lower odds of abdominal aortic aneurysm prevalence (OR 0.90, 
95% 
CI 0.89 to 0.93).17 In the present study, an inverse associ-
ation of nut consumption with incidence of abdominal aortic 
aneurysm was observed after adjustment for age and sex only, 
but the association did not persist after adjustment for other 
factors related to risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm in the these 
cohorts, such as smoking, alcohol and fruit consumption.18–20 
The discrepancy in results could be explained by the lower 
number of incident cases in this study, or by reverse causation 
bias or residual confounding in the US study.
Aortic stenosis shares several traditional cardiovascular risk 
factors with coronary and cerebrovascular disease but the asso-
ciation of dietary factors with this valvular heart disease has 
remained unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, no previous 
study has investigated the possible association between nut 
consumption and risk of aortic valve stenosis, which could not 
be verified in the present study.
The overall evidence from this study along with previous 
cohort studies indicates that nut consumption is not associated 
with a reduced risk of ischaemic21–25 or haemorrhagic21 22 24 25 
stroke in European and US adults. If anything, a positive asso-
ciation has been reported.21 23 In contrast, a prospective study 
of Chinese adults found a significant lower risk of mortality 
from ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage among 
those with as little as 1.45 
g/day or more of nuts (two highest 
quintiles).25 Although observational data provide little support 
(except for in Chinese adults) that nut consumption lowers the 
risk of stroke, the PREDIMED trial showed that individuals 
randomised to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts 
experienced a 46% reduced risk of stroke (HR 0.54, 95% 
CI 
0.35 to 0.84) compared with the control group (advise to follow 
a low-fat diet).14 The reason for the inconsistent findings is 
unclear but might be related to the type and amount of nuts 
consumed. In the PREDIMED trial, those randomised to the nut 
group received 30 
g/day of mixed nuts (walnuts, almonds and 
hazelnuts). In the prospective observational studies, however, 
nut consumption was lower and likely a mixture of unsalted and 
salted nuts.

Cardiac risk factors and prevention
heart failure (non-linear association) might in part be mediated 
by weight changes as previous prospective studies have shown 
that high nut consumption is associated with significantly less 
weight gain during follow-up.4 In the present cohorts, over-
weight and obesity are strongly associated with increased risk 
of atrial fibrillation26 and heart failure27 but also with aortic

Cardiac risk factors and prevention
valve stenosis28 and abdominal aortic aneurysm (abdominal 
obesity only).29 The reduced risk of heart failure associated 
with moderate but not high nut consumption might be related 
to that high nut consumption increases rather than decreases 
body weight. Nuts may also beneficially influence cardiovas-
cular health through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects,1 
improvement of endothelial function3 and reduction of total 
and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.1 2 However, the 
effect of nut intake on cholesterol appears to be non-linear 
with an effect primarily seen at intakes of at least 60 
g/day.2 Nut 
consumption in this study population may have been too low to 
have a meaningful impact on cholesterol levels. Atrial fibrosis 
has been identified as a fundamental structural change respon-
sible for the perpetuation of atrial fibrillation.30 Whether the 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of nuts could have a 
preventive effect on atrial fibrosis is to the best of our knowledge 
unknown.
Strengths of this study include the large sample size, the large 
number of incident cases for most CVD endpoints and the 
assessment of nut consumption at baseline in relation to risk of 
multiple CVD endpoints in the same population. Another major 
strength is the objective and virtually complete case ascertain-
ment accomplished by record linkage with the unique personal 
identity number used in all the registries.
Regression dilution bias due to measurement error in the 
assessment of nut consumption at baseline and changes in nut 
consumption during follow-up may have attenuated the results. 
Attenuation of the risk estimates due to changes in nut consump-
tion is expected to increase with longer follow-up. We conducted 
a sensitivity analysis restricted to the first 10 years of follow-up 
and observed somewhat stronger associations (HRs further away 
from the null) but with less precision in the estimates because 
of fewer incident cases. Because this was an observational study, 
we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed associations 
are due to unmeasured or residual confounding. Participants 
who frequently consumed nuts were more likely to adhere to 
healthy lifestyle behaviours and had fewer other risk factors for 
CVD compared with non-consumers of nuts. We cannot rule 
out residual confounding by income and occupation because 
we could not adjust for these potential confounders. Another 
potential concern is reverse causation bias, which was addressed 
by excluding the first 2 
years of follow-up. Results were similar 
in this sensitivity analysis. Since multiple CVD outcomes were 
analysed, we cannot exclude the possibility of chance findings. 
Finally, as this study population comprised Swedish middle-aged 
Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
 
► Previous studies have found that nut consumption is inversely 
associated with cardiovascular disease mortality.
What might this study add?
 
► This study shows that consumption of nuts ≥3 times/week 
is associated with an 18% reduced risk of atrial fibrillation. 
Moderate (up to 1–2 times/week) but not high consumption 
of nuts was associated with a reduced risk of heart failure.
how might this impact on clinical practice?
 
► These findings suggest that nut consumption may play a role 
in reducing the risk of atrial fibrillation and possibly heart 
failure.

Cardiac risk factors and prevention
and older adults only, our findings might not be generalisable to 
other populations with potentially other proportions and types 
of nuts consumed.
In conclusion, results from this large prospective study suggest 
that nut consumption or factors associated with this nutritional 
behaviour may play a role in reducing the risk of atrial fibrilla-
tion and possibly heart failure. Since only a small proportion of 
this population had moderate (about 5%) or high (<2%) nut 
consumption, even a small increase in nut consumption may 
have large potential to lead to a reduction in incidence of atrial 
fibrillation and heart failure in this population.
