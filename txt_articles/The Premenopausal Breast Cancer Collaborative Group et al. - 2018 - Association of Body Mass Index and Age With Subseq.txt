 Association of Body Mass Index and Age With Subsequent
Breast Cancer Risk in Premenopausal Women
The Premenopausal Breast Cancer Collaborative Group
IMPORTANCE The association between increasing body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and risk of breast cancer is unique in cancer
epidemiology in that a crossover effect exists, with risk reduction before and risk increase
after menopause. The inverse association with premenopausal breast cancer risk is poorly
characterized but might be important in the understanding of breast cancer causation.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of BMI with premenopausal breast cancer risk, in
particular by age at BMI, attained age, risk factors for breast cancer, and tumor characteristics.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter analysis used pooled individual-level
data from 758 592 premenopausal women from 19 prospective cohorts to estimate hazard
ratios (HRs) of premenopausal breast cancer in association with BMI from ages 18 through
54 years using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Median follow-up was 9.3 years
(interquartile range, 4.9-13.5 years) per participant, with 13 082 incident cases of breast
cancer. Participants were recruited from January 1, 1963, through December 31, 2013, and
data were analyzed from September 1, 2013, through December 31, 2017.
EXPOSURES Body mass index at ages 18 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, and 45 to 54 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Invasive or in situ premenopausal breast cancer.
RESULTS Among the 758 592 premenopausal women (median age, 40.6 years; interquartile
range, 35.2-45.5 years) included in the analysis, inverse linear associations of BMI with breast
cancer risk were found that were stronger for BMI at ages 18 to 24 years (HR per 5 kg/m2
[5.0-U] difference, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73-0.80) than for BMI at ages 45 to 54 years (HR per
5.0-U difference, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86-0.91). The inverse associations were observed even
among nonoverweight women. There was a 4.2-fold risk gradient between the highest and
lowest BMI categories (BMI�35.0 vs <17.0) at ages 18 to 24 years (HR, 0.24; 95% CI,
0.14-0.40). Hazard ratios did not appreciably vary by attained age or between strata of other
breast cancer risk factors. Associations were stronger for estrogen receptor–positive and/or
progesterone receptor–positive than for hormone receptor–negative breast cancer for BMI
at every age group (eg, for BMI at age 18 to 24 years: HR per 5.0-U difference for estrogen
receptor–positive and progesterone receptor–positive tumors, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.70-0.81] vs
hormone receptor–negative tumors, 0.85 [95% CI: 0.76-0.95]); BMI at ages 25 to 54 years
was not consistently associated with triple-negative or hormone receptor–negative breast
cancer overall.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this study suggest that increased adiposity is
associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer at a greater magnitude than
previously shown and across the entire distribution of BMI. The strongest associations of risk
were observed for BMI in early adulthood. Understanding the biological mechanisms
underlying these associations could have important preventive potential.

reast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer
among women worldwide, accounting for 25% of fe-
male cancer cases at all ages and a greater percentage
among young women.1 Its complex etiology involves an un-
usually large range of factors, of which adiposity, often as-
sessed as body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared), is important and
appears to have opposing effects at premenopausal and post-
menopausal ages.
Increased adiposity in childhood and before menopause
has been reported to be inversely associated with the risk of
breast cancer diagnosed at premenopausal and postmeno-
pausal ages, whereas increased adiposity after menopause is
positively associated with risk.2-11 However, because inci-
dence rates are lower among premenopausal than postmeno-
pausal women, individual studies have had limited ability to
investigate the association of BMI with the risk of premeno-
pausal breast cancer. Past studies have been case-control stud-
ies, with potential for bias, and most prospective studies have
had modest numbers of cases, except for some recent studies
in Asian12,13 or Jewish Israeli14 populations, but have not as-
sessed risk at different ages, by tumor type, and by meno-
pausal status at breast cancer diagnosis. Meta-analyses have
aggregated studies that differed in age at BMI assessment, at-
tained age of participants, and degree of adjustment for po-
tential confounding, and results were not stratified by other
risk factors.2-5,15-18 Some studies suggest that the association
of premenopausal adiposity with risk varies by tumor
characteristics,2,7,17-19 but larger studies are needed to pro-
vide stable estimates by hormone receptor status or intrinsic
tumor subtype.
To undertake a more powerful and systematic analysis of
the association of BMI with breast cancer risk in premeno-
pausal women, we pooled individual-level data from 758 592
women, including 13 082 cases of breast cancer, from 19 pro-
spective cohort studies using data from recruitment and fol-
low-up questionnaires. We aimed to estimate the relative risk
associated with BMI at different ages, age at breast cancer
diagnosis, and breast cancer characteristics and to explore
whether associations were modified by other risk factors for
breast cancer.
Methods
Information on the Premenopausal Breast Cancer Collabora-
tive Group, a collaboration facilitated by the National Cancer
Institute Cohort Consortium, has been published previously.20
In short, individual-level data were pooled from 19 prospec-
tivecohortsinNorthAmerica(n = 9),Europe(n = 7),Asia(n = 2),
and Australia (n = 1),20 with participants recruited from Janu-
ary 1, 1963, through December 31, 2013 and at least 100 breast
cancer cases diagnosed before 55 years of age. Data were har-
monizedtoacommontemplatefor1to16questionnairerounds
per study. Full details of the study cohorts are given in the
eMethods in the Supplement. All contributing studies gained
approval from institutional review boards and obtained con-
sent from participants as per country-specific requirements.
We used information on self-reported or measured cur-
rentweightandheightfrommultiplequestionnaireroundsand
information reported on questionnaires about weight at ages
before study entry to construct BMI within the age ranges of
18 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, and 45 to 54 years. We categorized
BMI according to World Health Organization definitions.21 The
analysis included all participants who were premenopausal,
had no personal history of breast cancer at study entry, and
had data for premenopausal BMI available.
All breast cancers included in this analysis occurred be-
fore menopause, with the main analytic end point being in-
vasive or in situ premenopausal breast cancer overall. How-
ever,wealsoanalyzedseparatelybyinvasiveandinsitucancer,
by immunohistochemistry data on estrogen receptor (ER) and
progesteronereceptor(PR)status,andbyclinicopathologicsur-
rogate definitions of intrinsic breast cancer subtype.
Hazard ratios (HRs) were obtained as estimates of the rela-
tive risk of breast cancer from Cox proportional hazards re-
gression models22 with attained age as the underlying times-
cale. Follow-up for breast cancer started at study entry or the
age after enrollment to which the BMI applied. Follow-up
ended at breast cancer diagnosis, menopause (or hysterec-
tomy), last follow-up, death, or age 55 years, whichever oc-
curred first.
We first generated cohort-specific relative risk estimates
and obtained a pooled estimate with a 2-stage model.23 Be-
cause no appreciable between-study heterogeneity was de-
tectedusingtheI2statistic,24thedatawereanalyzedinapooled
data set. All presented analyses were adjusted for attained age
(implicit in the Cox proportional hazards regression model),
cohort, year of birth, age at menarche, age at first birth, time
since last birth, parity, and family history of breast cancer.
Covariate information was time updated, when possible, with
information from follow-up questionnaires.
We analyzed BMI separately as categorical and continu-
ous variables (per 5 kg/m2 [5.0-U] difference), assuming a log-
linear dose-response association, the validity of which was
checked using restricted cubic spline models.25 We tested for
effect modification by other risk factors for breast cancer and
by attained age using log-likelihood ratio tests.26 Analyses by
breast tumor subtype were conducted using an augmenta-
tion method.27 This method allows estimation of separate risk
Key Points
Question What is the association between body mass index and
risk for breast cancer diagnosed before menopause?
Finding In this large pooled analysis of data on 758 592
premenopausal women, an inverse association of breast cancer
risk with body mass index at 18 through 54 years of age was found,
most strongly for body mass index at ages 18 through 24 years.
The inverse association was strongest for hormone
receptor–positive breast cancer, was evident across the entire
distribution of body mass index, and did not materially vary by
attained age or other characteristics of women.
Meaning Increased adiposity, in particular during early adulthood,
may be associated with reductions in the risk of premenopausal
breast cancer.

stratified on outcome type, obtained from a data set in which
separate observations on each participant have been created
for each outcome. Conducted sensitivity analyses are out-
lined in the eMethods in the Supplement. We used Stata, ver-
sion 14.2 (StataCorp) for all analyses, with P < .05 indicating
signficance.28
Results
Theanalysesincluded758 592women(medianage,40.6years;
interquartile range, 35.2-45.5 years), among whom 13 082 in
situ or invasive breast cancer cases occurred during 7.2 mil-
lion premenopausal years of follow-up (median, 9.3 years; in-
terquartile range, 4.9-13.5 years) (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). Weight was provided at 1 to 14 (median, 2) follow-up
rounds per study and was self-reported for 88.9% to 99.6% of
weights, depending on age. Weight at ages 18 to 24 years was
retrospectivelyreportedfor96.9%andatlateragesforlessthan
10% of women. Obesity (BMI≥30.0) was more common in
women who were 45 years or older (11.1%), were nulliparous
(12.4%), had an early menarche (17.0%), had a family history
of breast cancer (12.8%), or were black (26.8%) (Table).
IncreasingBMIwaslinearlyassociatedwithdecreasingrisk
of breast cancer in the restricted cubic spline models (eFig-
ures 1 and 2 in the Supplement), except that, for some ages and
tumor types, there appeared to be a leveling of risk for under-
weight women (BMI<18.5) compared with those in the nor-
mal weight range (BMI, 18.5-24.9). We therefore restricted the
linear modeling of BMI to values of 18.5 or greater.
Hazard ratios for breast cancer decreased with increasing
BMI category (Figure 1), more for BMI at younger than older
ages, with a risk reduction of 23% per 5.0-U difference
(HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73-0.80) for BMI at ages 18 to 24 years and
12% (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86-0.91) for BMI at 45 to 54 years.
The risk gradient was 4.2-fold between the highest and low-
est BMI categories (BMI≥35.0 vs <17.0) at ages 18 to 24 years
(HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.14-0.40). Significant differences in rela-
tive risk were present even within the normal range of BMI (for
23.0-24.9 vs 18.5-22.9: HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75-0.86). The HRs
for BMI at ages 18 to 24 years remained statistically signifi-
cant after additional adjustment for most recent BMI (HR per
5.0-U increase, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.76-0.84). We found no appre-
ciable heterogeneity in the association between studies
(eFigure 3A-D in the Supplement).
Weight at ages 18 to 24 years was correlated with weights
atolderages(r = 0.70forages25-34,r = 0.63forages35-44,and
r = 0.55 for ages 45-54 years). When we adjusted the analyses
of breast cancer risk in Figure 2 for BMI at ages 18 to 24 years,
the HRs per 5.0-U increase were 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.97) for
BMI at ages 25 to 34 years, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.91-0.96) at ages 35
to 44 years, and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88-0.95) at ages 45 to 54 years
(Figure 2 and eTable 2 in the Supplement). The magnitude of
the inverse associations was similar between categories of at-
tained age to age 55 years (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
Incident cases of breast cancer included 10 836 invasive
and 2138 in situ breast cancers. Associations with risk per
5.0-U difference in BMI were significantly larger for in situ
(HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69-0.85) than for invasive breast cancer
(HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.84-0.92) (P = .02 for interaction) for
BMI at ages 25 to 34 years; difference in associations were
also found for in situ (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76-0.86) and inva-
sive breast cancer (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86-0.90; P = .01 for
interaction) at 35 to 44 years (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
The percentage of all breast cancers that were in situ did not
appreciably vary by BMI, and women with higher BMI were
more likely to have had a screening mammogram (eTable 4
in the Supplement).
The ER and/or PR status was known for 7812 cases, 7002
(89.6%) of which were invasive. We did not observe consis-
tent significant differences in HRs for ER-positive vs ER-
negative or PR-positive vs PR-negative breast cancer (eTable
5 in the Supplement). When considering ER and PR jointly,
ER-positive and/or PR-positive breast cancer showed stron-
ger associations with BMI at ages 18 to 24 years (eg, for ER-
positive and PR-positive, HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.70-0.81) than did
hormone receptor–negative breast cancer; however, the asso-
ciation was still significant for ER-negative and PR-negative
breast cancer (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76-0.95) (eFigure 5 in the
Supplement). Body mass index at older ages was not associ-
ated with hormone receptor–negative breast cancer risk. In
analyses by intrinsic breast cancer subtype (Figure 3), the non-
luminal (ER-negative and PR-negative) subtype was in-
versely associated with BMI at ages 18 to 24 (HR, 0.86; 95%
CI, 0.77-0.96) and 45 to 54 years (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-
0.98), but not with BMI at ages 25 to 34 and 35 to 44 years. No
association of BMI at 25 years or older with triple-negative
breast cancer or of BMI at 35 years or older with ERBB2/HER2-
enriched breast cancer was found.
Hazard ratios per 5.0-U difference in BMI were not signifi-
cantly different between strata of most risk factors for breast
cancer, including race/ethnicity (for BMI at ages 18 to 24 years:
HR for black women, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76-0.93]; HR for Asian
women, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.40-1.18]; and HR for white women,
0.73 [95% CI, 0.70-0.77]; P = .08 for interaction) (eFigure 6 and
eTable 6 in the Supplement). Hazard ratios were greater for
never users compared with than ever users of oral contracep-
tives (at baseline for most studies) for BMI at ages 18 to 24 years
(HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.61-0.76] vs 0.79 [95% CI, 0.75-0.83];
P = .02 for interaction) and ages 35 to 44 (HR, 0.81 [95% CI,
0.77-0.86] vs 0.88 [95% CI, 0.86-0.91]; P = .009 for interac-
tion). The HR was also greater for nulliparous than parous
women (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.73-0.87] vs 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-
0.93]; P = .03 for interaction) for BMI at ages 25 to 34 years.
Results were not materially affected in the sensitivity analy-
ses (eTables 7-9 in the Supplement) except for those shown in
Figure 1.
Discussion
In this large prospective analysis investigating the associa-
tion between adiposity and breast cancer risk in premeno-
pausal women, we analyzed relative risk by BMI in a larger
number of categories than possible in previous studies, re-

 vealing a 4.2-fold risk gradient between women who were un-
derweight vs obese at ages 18 to 24 years and a 1.9- to 2.5-fold
risk gradient between these BMI categories at later ages. We
demonstrated that the inverse associations apply to the en-
tire distribution of BMI, with risk variations evident even
among women in the nonoverweight range of BMI.

 The observed inverse associations are unlikely to be
attributable to bias, given that they were present in multiple
studies and across strata of birth cohort and risk factors for
breast cancer. Too few women died during follow-up (3.3%
of women with a BMI≥35.0 vs 1.7% with BMI of 18.5-24.9) to
explain the inverse associations for death as a competing
risk. Our results are also supported as causal rather than arti-
factual by a mendelian randomization study29 reporting
genetically predicted BMI to be inversely associated with
breast cancer risk.
The stronger inverse associations of risk with BMI at
younger than older ages suggest that adiposity in young adult-
hood or earlier, if adiposity at approximately 20 years of age
is a proxy marker for adiposity in childhood, is the critical fac-
tor. No cohorts in our collaboration had information on BMI

 at younger than 18 years, but published analyses of subjec-
tive body size compared with peers at these ages7-9 have found
strong inverse associations with premenopausal and post-
menopausal breast cancer risk.
Our estimated 12% to 23% reduction in premenopausal
breast cancer risk per 5.0-U difference in BMI depending
on age is substantially stronger than that from
meta-analyses,3-5,15,16 which have reported 5% to 9% reduc-
tions among women overall without analysis by age at BMI,
and a study reporting a 10% reduction using measured BMI at
ages 16 to 19 years.14 We observed that associations of BMI and
breast cancer risk did not depend on attained age. We found
no previous analyses by premenopausal attained age, but risk
reductions with increased early-life BMI have been reported
to continue after menopause.7,8 The associations of BMI with
risk also did not appear to be appreciably modified by risk fac-
tors for breast cancer later in life, with the possible exception
of nulliparity and oral contraceptive use.
The stronger associations of BMI at ages 25 to 44 years for
in situ than for invasive breast cancer might reflect type-
specific etiology or the association for in situ cancer being in
part attributable to an association of body size with breast
screening attendance. However, we found no evidence for
this association, given that percentages of in situ cancer were
similar across BMI groups.
No previous analyses of hormone receptor status–
specific breast cancer by BMI assessed at different premeno-
pausal ages have been performed, to our knowledge. We found
that hormone receptor–positive breast cancer was associated
withBMIatallagesandthathormonereceptor–negativebreast
cancer overall was associated with BMI at ages 18 to 24 years,
but not consistently associated with BMI at later ages; meta-
analyses of ER- and PR-negative tumors15,17 have found no as-
sociation, based on age at recruitment. The absence of an as-
sociation of triple-negative breast cancer with BMI at 25 years
or older in our analysis is contrary to previous reports18,19 in-
dicating an increased risk of this tumor type with obesity; how-
ever, these reports were based on case-control studies18 and
a pooled analysis of women younger than 50 years based on
studies of mixed design19 and therefore are subject to poten-
tial biases that are of less concern in prospective cohorts. We
observed that ERBB2/HER2-enriched breast cancer was asso-
ciated with BMI at 35 years or younger but not at later ages;
the Nurses’Health Study, included in this analysis, previ-
ouslyreportedastrongassociationwithBMIat18yearsofage,7
but we are not aware of studies investigating the association
with later premenopausal ages.
Obesity has many adverse effects on general health,30 and
we do not advocate weight gain as a preventative measure
against premenopausal breast cancer. However, understand-
ing the mechanistic action underlying the inverse associa-
tion of premenopausal adiposity with breast cancer risk could
potentially identify modifiable pathways. Because the asso-
ciation with BMI at ages 18 to 24 years is significant for
ER-positive and ER-negative tumors, hormonal and nonhor-
monal mechanisms might be involved. Breast tissue is par-
ticularlysusceptibletocarcinogensbetweenmenarcheandfirst
childbirth,31 and the extent of this susceptibility may be influ-
enced by childhood adiposity. Increased adiposity has a strong
association with early pubertal onset but also slower puber-
tal tempo,32 including slower peak growth,33 and rapid ado-
lescent growth has been associated with increased breast can-

Body mass index (BMI) is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared. The luminal A–like subtype includes estrogen receptor
(ER)–positive, progesterone receptor (PR)–positive, and ERBB2/HER2-negative
tumors; luminal B–subtype, all ER-positive and/or PR-positive tumors that are
not luminal A–like (subtypes luminal B–like ERBB2/HER2-negative and luminal
B–like ERBB2/HER2-positive); and nonluminal subtype, all ER-negative and
PR-negative tumors, regardless of ERBB2/HER2 status (subtypes ERBB2/HER2
enriched: ER-negative, PR-negative, and ERBB2/HER2-positive; triple-negative:
ER-negative, PR-negative, and ERBB2/HER2-negative).

end points with tests for heterogeneity in effect by tumor type (for BMI at
ages 18-24 years, P = .07; at ages 25-34 years, P = .002; at ages 35-44 years,
P < .001; at ages 45-54, P < .001). Estimates for subtypes of luminal B–like
and nonluminal breast cancer were obtained from a second model fitting
luminal A–like, luminal B–like ERBB2/HER2-positive, luminal B–like
ERBB2/HER2-negative, ERBB2/HER2-enriched, and triple-negative breast
cancer as end points.

 cer risk.34 The estrogenic effects of being overweight in
childhood, when adipose tissue is the major site of estrogen
release, have been proposed to induce early breast differen-
tiation or to increase the expression of tumor suppressor
genes.35 Being underweight during adolescence, in contrast,
might result in immature differentiation due to lack of breast
fat and/or low levels of ovarian hormones during breast
development.36
Early-adulthood adiposity is associated with intermedi-
ate markers of breast cancer risk, such as benign breast
disease,37mammographicdensity,38andinsulinlikegrowthfac-
tor 1 levels.39 Greater mammographic density has a positive as-
sociation with breast cancer risk,40 and a more endomorphic
somatotypeinchildhoodandearlyadulthoodisassociatedwith
lower mammographic density throughout adulthood.38 In the
Nurses’HealthStudy,4182%oftheassociationofBMIat18years
of age with breast cancer risk was explained by mammo-
graphicdensity,andbreastdensitymaybeanintermediatefac-
tor in the biological pathway for breast cancer development.
However, the mechanism of how density affects risk is not well
understood,andtheamountofnondense(ie,fatty)tissue,with
which BMI is strongly correlated, is also inversely associated
withbreastcancerrisk,independentlyofpercentagedensity.40
Early-life body size might also affect long-term insulinlike
growth factor 1 levels implicated in breast cancer risk,42 given
that plasma insulinlike growth factor 1 levels at ages 32 to 70
years were reported to be 14% lower in women who were over-
weight compared with those who were lean at age 18 years.39
The inverse association of BMI in premenopausal women
25 years or older with predominantly hormone receptor–
positive rather than hormone receptor–negative breast can-
cer implies a hormonal mechanism. Estrogen synthesis,
through the aromatase enzyme in subcutaneous fat, repre-
sents about 5% of total estradiol synthesis in premenopausal
women, but with extreme obesity, negative feedback in the hy-
pothalamic-pituitary-axiscanleadtoswitchoffofnormalovar-
ian function and be reflected in amenorrhea.43 Irregular men-
strual or fewer ovulatory cycles have therefore been suggested
as possible explanations for the inverse association,44 but this
suggestion has not been supported by studies that could ad-
just for menstrual cycle pattern.9-11 However, BMI-related
differences in sex-hormone profile may contribute to the in-
verse association of BMI and breast cancer risk. A study45 re-
ported that premenopausal women with higher BMI had lower
estradiol, total testosterone, sex hormone–binding globulin,
andprogesteronelevelsbutgreaterfreetestosteronelevelsthan
premenopausal women with lower BMI. Positive associa-
tions of premenopausal breast cancer risk have been re-
portedwithestradiol46-49andtestosteronelevels,46-48,50,51pos-
sibly stronger for ER-positive and/or PR-positive breast
cancer,47 but studies have been inconsistent. Studies investi-
gatingendogenousprogesteronelevels,46,47,49-51however,have
not found associations with breast cancer risk. Circulating lev-
els of leptin, a peptide hormone produced primarily by adi-
pocytes that is overexpressed in breast cancer, were also as-
sociated with reduced premenopausal breast cancer risk in a
prospective study, although not independently from BMI.52
Strengths and Limitations
Thestrengthsofthiscollaborationareitslargenumberofcases,
providing precise estimates of relative risk by age at adiposity
and allowing for stratified and breast cancer subtype–
specific analyses. All contributing studies were prospective,
and most had multiple follow-up rounds, facilitating deter-
mination of menopausal status and time-updated covariate
information.
However, the use of BMI has its limitations in that women
with the same BMI can have different body fat distributions
and overall body fat levels.53 Body mass index was recalled for
early adulthood, but a good correlation (r = 0.87) has been re-
ported between recalled and measured weight at 18 years of
age.54 Current weight was usually self-reported, but in the Sis-
ter Study,55 66% of women accurately reported their current
weightwithin1.35kg,andunderweightwomentendedtoover-
report and obese women tended to underreport, although
rarely by more than 10%. If such misclassification applied to
all studies, we might have slightly overestimated the trends
but not to a sufficient degree to account for them fully. On the
other hand, random misclassification would have led to at-
tenuated effect sizes. Study-specific differences in method of
assessment and cut points for hormone receptor and ERBB2/
HER2 status of breast cancer, given that these data were fre-
quently obtained from medical records, may have led to dif-
ferential classification of the tumor types between studies,
potentially leading to underestimation of relative risks. More
than 1000 breast cancer cases occurred in black women, al-
lowing for stable estimation of relative risks in that popula-
tion; results were similar to results from white women. How-
ever, we had insufficient statistical power to address the
hypothesisthatassociationsmightbeweakerorabsentinAsian
populations.12,13,16,56
Conclusions
The results of our study suggest that increased BMI is in-
versely associated with the risk of breast cancer diagnosis be-
fore menopause, to a greater magnitude than suggested in pre-
vious analyses, and with the strongest associations for BMI at
youngages.TheassociationwithBMIinearlyadulthoodisuni-
versal across strata of other risk factors and across breast can-
cer subtypes. Understanding the biological mechanism un-
derlyingthisassociationcouldhaveimportantimplicationsfor
breast cancer prevention.
