Albuminuria affects millions of people, and is an independent risk factor for kidney failure,
cardiovascular morbidity and death. The key cell that prevents albuminuria is the terminally
differentiated glomerular podocyte. Here we report the evolutionary importance of the
enzyme Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) for maintaining podocyte function in mice and
the equivalent nephrocyte cell in Drosophila. Developmental deletion of both GSK3 isoforms
(α and β) in murine podocytes causes late neonatal death associated with massive albumi-
nuria and renal failure. Similarly, silencing GSK3 in nephrocytes is developmentally lethal for
this cell. Mature genetic or pharmacological podocyte/nephrocyte GSK3 inhibition is also
detrimental; producing albuminuric kidney disease in mice and nephrocyte depletion in
Drosophila. Mechanistically, GSK3 loss causes differentiated podocytes to re-enter the cell
cycle and undergo mitotic catastrophe, modulated via the Hippo pathway but independent of
Wnt-β-catenin. This work clearly identifies GSK3 as a critical regulator of podocyte and hence
kidney function.

 N
early 700 million people, representing 10% of the global
population, are affected by kidney disease manifesting as
albuminuria or a reduction in the glomerular filtration
rate (GFR)1. Even small increases in albuminuria (micro-
albuminuria) or reductions of GFR increase the relative risk of
progressing to end-stage renal failure (ESRF), having a cardio-
vascular event or dying2,3. In recent years, it has become clear
that a key mammalian kidney cell in preventing albuminuria and
preserving renal function is the glomerular podocyte. Podocytes
are epithelial-like cells, located on the urinary side of the glo-
merular filtration barrier. They consist of large cell bodies with
radiating major and minor processes that wrap around the fil-
tering glomerular capillaries to form the foot processes with
regularly spaced slit diaphragms, that provide the final barrier for
glomerular filtration. Importantly, podocytes, similar to neu-
rones4, become terminally differentiated soon after birth, with
minimal capacity to re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate.
Mutations in over 40 human genes have been shown to cause
albuminuria5, which are expressed in the podocyte and their
mutations are deleterious. Therefore, understanding important
cellular processes that regulate the unique biology of this cell is of
fundamental importance.
Understanding of podocyte biology has been greatly facilitated
in recent years by the discovery of equivalent cell types in more
tractable organisms that can be rapidly genetically manipulated to
study their function. A good example of this is the Drosophila
nephrocyte. Nephrocytes have several similarities to podocytes,
including expression of many analogues of the critical mamma-
lian slit diaphragm podocyte proteins such as nephrin (stick and
stones and hibris), NEPH1 (dumbfounded), podocin (Mec 2) and
CD2AP (GC31012). Nephrocytes function as endocytotic filtra-
tion cells, maintain adult haemolymph6 and are involved in
cardiac and immune homeostasis7.
Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) is a multi-functional
serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates several distinct
biological pathways8. It was initially described as a component of
glycogen metabolism and was later shown to be downstream of
insulin signalling. GSK3 is rapidly phosphorylated and inhibited
in response to this hormone through activation of the phos-
phoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, contributing to deposition
of glycogen9. GSK3 has two major biological actions; as a scaf-
folding protein and a kinase enzyme to catalyse a variety of down-
stream targets10.
GSK3 is evolutionarily conserved across all eukaryotic spe-
cies. In Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster it
is encoded by a single gene11. In contrast, in mammals GSK3
exists as two isoforms, GSK3α and GSK3β, encoded by different
genes on different chromosomes11. These isoforms have 85%
overall structural homology with highly conserved kinase
domains (97%), with the differences largely confined to the N
and C terminal regions12. Mammalian GSK3 activity is dyna-
mically regulated through phosphorylation of key residues.
Phosphorylation at serine 21 (GSK3α) and serine 9 (GSK3β)
results in reduced activity13. Although GSK3α and β are
structurally similar they also have some distinct functions:
GSK3β null mice die during late embryogenesis due to liver
apoptosis and defective activation of NF-kappa B14, together
with cardiac abnormalities;15 in contrast GSK3α null mice are
viable, have a normal life span and, interestingly, exhibit
enhanced insulin sensitivity when on a susceptible genetic
background16. This suggests that, although the isoforms share
structural similarity, they have differing biological functions
and are not entirely redundant. Multiple cell-specific GSK3
knockout mouse models have been published that illustrate that
the functions of the two mammalian GSK3 isoforms are also
cell-type dependent17–21.
Recently it has been reported that inhibiting GSK3 in the
podocyte may be therapeutically beneficial for a variety of
experimental renal diseases. These studies have focused on the
GSK3β isoform with less consideration of the α isoform and have
either used specific genetic inhibition of GSK3β exclusively in the
podocyte22 or pharmacological inhibitors such as lithium, 6-
bromoindirubin-3ʹ-oxime (BIO), and thiadiazolidinone (TDZD-
8)22–27. The beneficial effects of these agents are postulated to be
due to inhibition of GSK3β. However, there are no isoform-
specific GSK3 inhibitors currently available, and those that are
used inhibit both isoforms similarly. The most common GSK3
inhibitor used in clinical practice is lithium carbonate, in the
treatment of bipolar disorders. Intriguingly, lithium can cause
glomerulosclerosis and ESRF in some patients given this drug for
prolonged periods28,29 but the reason for this effect is unclear30.
As GSK3 and its isoforms exhibit different roles in different cell
types17,19–21, in this study, we investigate GSK3’s importance in
the podocytes of mice and in the equivalent nephrocytes of
Drosophila using genetic and pharmacological approaches. We
find that GSK3 is critically important for the function of these
cells both during development and in maturity. Furthermore, the
evolutionary segregation of GSK3 into two isoforms (α and β)
appears protective as either isoform can fully compensate for the
other’s loss. Mechanistically, GSK3 maintains the podocyte in its
terminally differentiated form and prevents it from re-entering
the cell cycle and undergoing mitotic catastrophe, modulated by
Hippo pathway signals.
Results
Developmental genetic loss of podocyte/nephrocyte GSK3 is
catastrophic. To study the developmental importance of GSK3,
podocyte-specific GSK3α, GSK3β and combined GSK3 α/β
knockout (podGSK3DKO) transgenic mice were generated. This
was achieved by crossing floxed GSK3α16 and/or GSK3β mice17
with a podocin Cre mouse31 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Mice were
genotyped and genomic excision of GSK3α and β DNA verified
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). Furthermore, GSK3 isoform protein loss
was confirmed using IHC (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
All genotypes were born with normal Mendelian frequency
(Supplementary Table 1) indicating that there was no pre-natal
lethality. Single isoform podocyte-specific deletion of GSK3α or
β, as well as deletion of three out of four of the GSK3 alleles
(i.e. podCreGSK3αfl/fl βfl/wt or podCreGSK3αfl/wtβfl/fl) caused
no discernible phenotypes, with mice surviving normally to
two
years
of
age.
However,
when
both
isoforms
were
simultaneously deleted (i.e. all four floxed GSK3 alleles
inactivated [podCreGSK3αfl/flβfl/fl or podGSK3DKO]) the mice
all died between postnatal day 10 and 16 (p = 0.003 [Fig. 1a]).
Prior to death these mice were indistinguishable from their
littermates with regard to external appearance, weight and
behaviour (Supplementary Fig. 1e). However, at time of death
they had pronounced renal involvement with enlarged pale
kidneys (Supplementary Fig. 1f), renal failure (Fig. 1b), acidosis
(Fig. 1c), and high levels of albuminuria (Fig. 1d; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1g). Renal disease evolved rapidly after birth as
evidenced by a 25-fold increase in albuminuria from P2 to
P10 (Fig. 1d). Histological examination using light and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) also revealed that
glomerular and renal abnormalities were initially subtle in
podGSK3DKO mice, but these rapidly progressed over the first
10 days of life to show glomerulosclerosis, multiple tubular
protein casts and major disruption of the glomerular filtration
barrier on TEM (Fig. 1e). By P10 highly abnormal, cystic and
vacuolated, glomeruli were evident in the podGSK3DKO mice
(Fig. 1f).

 To assess whether GSK3 plays similar roles in Drosophila
nephrocytes we used the dKlf15-Gal4 driver to silence the GSK3
gene here, which is called shaggy. This resulted in a total loss of
pericardial nephrocytes, indicative of a critical requirement for
shaggy during nephrocyte development (Fig. 1g, h). Interestingly,
complete absence of nephrocytes was not overtly detrimental to
Drosophila.
Mature genetic loss of podocyte/nephrocyte GSK3 is detri-
mental. After establishing the developmental importance of
GSK3 in the podocyte/nephrocyte we evaluated the role of GSK3
in
mature
cells.

 Figs. 2a–d). These mice were compared to Cre negative and non-
doxycycline treated control littermates. All but one of the
mpodGSK3DKO mice developed albuminuric kidney disease
(Fig. 2a, b), but none of the control mice did. This occurred
rapidly in the majority of mpodGSK3DKO mice with many
developing albuminuria that was detectable within one week of
finishing doxycycline (Fig. 2a, b). There was variability in the
severity of their renal disease (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 3a),
with some mpodGSK3DKO mice only mildly albuminuric at
22 weeks of age, but in all there was evidence of mesangial
hypercellularity and glomerular fibrosis on trichrome staining
(Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 3a). In contrast ~30% of animals had
raised serum creatinine relative to controls (Supplementary
Fig. 3b), associated with global glomerulosclerosis and widespread
interstitial fibrosis throughout the kidney (Fig. 2c; Supplementary
Fig. 3a). One mouse was found to have severe hypertension (204
mmHg (SEM ± 2.67) / 158 mmHg (SEM ± 2.37) c/w systolic 115
(SEM ± 3.34) and diastolic 85 (SEM ±
2.46) in controls).
mpodGSK3DKO mice had fewer podocytes and reduced nephrin
expression compared to littermate controls (Supplementary
Figs. 3c, d). Fascinatingly, approximately 20% of mpodGSK3DKO
mice developed a florid crescentic glomerulopathy (Fig. 2d). To
elucidate the cellular origin of the infiltrating crescentic cells we
crossed the mpodGSK3DKO mouse with the mT/mG fluorescent
reporter mouse to lineage tag the podocytes. This revealed
extracapillary cells were of podocyte origin (Fig. 2e).
High-powered TEM demonstrated foot process effacement in
mpodGSK3DKO podocytes together with basement membrane
thickening in some mice. Low power TEM images confirmed our
observations of mesangial hypercellularity and enlarged glomer-
uli. However, glomerular endothelial appearance and fenestra-
tions were unchanged (Fig. 2f).
We also temporally deleted GSK3 (shaggy) from the mature
nephrocyte in adult Drosophila using the dkfl15-TARGET system.
This caused cellular dysfunction with reduced nephrocyte
number and a significant loss and mislocalisation of the NEPH1
homolog dumfounded expression on the cells (Fig. 2g, h).
Pharmacological suppression of podocyte/nephrocyte GSK3 is
detrimental. Complete genetic deletion of GSK3α and β in the
podocyte was highly detrimental. However, of more clinical
relevance is the pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 as there are
multiple pharmacological compounds that can do this, and there
is great interest in their potential use in a variety of important
diseases including diabetes, cancer and dementia32,33. The most
common agent of use in clinical practice is lithium, which is used
for bipolar conditions. It is unknown how lithium precisely
inhibits GSK3 activity but it is proposed that it has a dual inhi-
bitory action by interfering with a secondary magnesium binding
site as well as increasing inhibitory phosphorylation of both
serine 21 for GSK3α, and serine 9 for GSK3β10. We initially
confirmed that lithium caused phosphorylation of these inhibi-
tory sites in conditionally immortalised human and murine
podocytes (Supplementary Figs. 4a–d). To assess the functional
significance of prolonged podocyte GSK3 inhibition we then
studied Wistar rats that were chronically treated with lithium for
6-months. This caused inhibitory phosphorylation of the GSK3
isoforms, together with stabilization of β-catenin specifically in
their podocytes within their glomeruli (Fig. 3a). β-catenin acti-
vation occurs when GSK3 is sufficiently inhibited and thus unable
to regulate the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of β-
catenin via its ubiquitinylation and destruction by the 26S pro-
teasome21. Lithium-treated rats developed significant proteinuria
(Fig. 3b) and glomerulosclerosis (Fig. 3c, d) in comparison to
their age and sex matched controls.
We then examined the direct impact of lithium on nephrocyte
function in Drosophila using an ex vivo culture system involving
semi-intact fly preparations. Within 48 h of lithium treatment
dose-dependent nephrocyte hypertrophy was observed (Fig. 3e),
coupled with mislocalisation of dumbfounded from uniformly
short linear arrays, consistent with previous reports34, and to an
accumulation of bright, punctate Duf foci across the nephrocyte
surface (Fig. 3f). Furthermore, lithium caused severe functional
abnormalities to the nephrocytes’ endocytic function. At lower
doses (1 mM), there was an increase in the Dextran signal within
nephrocytes (Fig. 3g). However, when the cells were exposed to
20 mM lithium for 48 h it resulted in major issues with their
endocytic capabilities with the formation of large lacunae and
uptake of large Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) (Fig. 3h). In
similar experiments, flies provided with food containing 5 mM
lithium for 1 week showed nephrocyte loss, reduced Duf staining
and increased large protein WGA accumulation (Fig. 3i). These
phenotypes are consistent with progressive loss of diaphragm
integrity and comparable to foot process effacement seen in
injured mammalian podocytes (Supplementary Fig. 4e). Finally,
we examined a kidney biopsy from a patient who had been on
long-term lithium therapy and found that they also had
inhibitory GSK3 phosphorylation in their podocytes compared
to control human kidney samples (Fig. 3j).
Podocyte GSK3 loss activates Wnt-β-catenin but this is not
responsible for pathology. Genetic deletion of GSK3αβ in the
podocytes of podGSK3DKO mice caused substantive activation
and nuclear translocation of β-catenin in this cell type. Interest-
ingly β-catenin was also activated throughout the kidney in the
tubular compartment (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Fig. 5a),
which we subsequently identified was probably a consequence
of massive albuminuria (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Similarly,

 pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 also activated β-catenin in
the podocyte (Fig. 3a).
As β-catenin activation and transcription of its target genes
have been shown to be detrimental in other cell types when GSK3
is lost35,36, we hypothesized that β-catenin activation was the
critical factor causing kidney damage in this model. We therefore
generated transgenic mice models in which GSK3α, GSK3β and
β-catenin were all contemporaneously deleted specifically from
the podocyte
both developmentally and
in maturity.

confirmed that β-catenin was knocked down in these models

 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry
(IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) (Supplementary Figs. 5c–e).
However, a loss of podocyte β-catenin did not improve survival or
kidney involvement in the developmental model (Fig. 4c–e) or
renal damage in the mature model (Fig. 4f).
To support these findings, and given the contribution of Wnt/
β-catenin along with Notch and Hedgehog pathways to the
detrimental phenotype observed in other cells lacking GSK335 we
also used pharmacological inhibitors of these pathways in a
genetic GSK3αβ podocyte knockout cell line we developed
(described in detail in next section). We inhibited Wnt signalling
with iCRT3, NOTCH with DAPT and Hedgehog with GANT 61
but none of these improved cell survival (Fig. 4g–i; Fig. 8c).
Interestingly, and unexpectedly, inhibiting Hedgehog signalling
significantly increased cell death in this model (Fig. 4i; Fig. 8c).
Podocyte GSK3 loss causes mitotic catastrophe. To elucidate the
mechanisms causing cellular damage when GSK3 was lost we
generated a conditionally immortalised temperature-sensitive
SV40 antigen podocyte cell line from a GSK3αfl/flβfl/fl mouse.
This allowed us to initially culture healthy podocytes and then
temporally delete GSK3 using lentiviral delivered Cre recombi-
nase to make a GSK3α/β knockout cell line (cipodGSK3DKO)
(Supplementary Figs. 6a–c). Three days after Cre transduction
there was ~85% reduction of GSK3α and a ~70% reduction of
GSK3β (Fig. 5a; Supplementary Fig. 6d) but the podocytes
appeared healthy without any detectable cell loss. Therefore, we
elected to interrogate this time point to identify early GSK3 dri-
ven mechanistic processes. More prolonged loss of GSK3, for
7 days, caused podocytes to be lost and microscopically appear
unhealthy (Fig. 5b; Supplementary Fig. 6e).
Non-biased Tandom Mass tagged (TMT) LC-MS/MS proteomic
analysis of the cells 3 days after Cre transduction identified 486
proteins that were up-regulated more than 30% in cipodGSK3DKO
cells compared to their controls (non-Cre treated GSK3αfl/flβfl/fl
podocytes or lentiviral Cre expressing wild-type podocytes) at a
statistical significance p < 0.01. STRING (search tool for the retrieval
of
interacting
genes/proteins)
was
used
to
visualise
the
protein–protein interactions and biological processes enriched in
this data set. It revealed enrichment of multiple proteins involved in
the cell cycle, including many involved in mitosis and mitotic
spindle formation (Fig. 5c; Supplementary Fig. 7; Supplementary
Table 3). To explore these findings further we performed fixed
(Fig. 5d), and live (Supplementary Movie 1 and 2), phase contrast
light microscopy of the cipodGSK3DKO cells. These confirmed that
the cells were re-entering the cell cycle and attempting to divide as
shown by significantly increased numbers of bi-nucleate and multi-
nucleate cells in comparison to controls. However, many podocytes
were unable to complete cytokinesis and appeared to be undergoing
apoptosis and dying (Supplementary Movie 1 and 2). Detailed
analysis of ciGSK3DKO cell numbers using an IN-Cell analyser
confirmed these observations (Fig. 5b). The presence of multiple
nuclei suggested that mitosis was occurring in ciGSK3DKO cells
and western blot analysis of ciGSK3DKO cells 5 days after GSK3
knockdown showed a significant increase in phosphorylated
Histone H3 (Fig.
5e and Supplementary Fig. 6f), a commonly
used marker of mitosis associated with chromatin condensation37.
Cyclin B1 is not usually detectable in healthy, mature podocytes38
but our proteomic analysis revealed that it was one of the most up-
regulated proteins in ciGSK3DKO cells (Fig. 5c and Supplementary
Table 3). This was confirmed by western blotting along with
increased phosphorylation of Cdk1 (Fig. 5e; Supplementary Fig. 6f).
Levels of the Cyclin B1/Cdk1 complex increase during G2 of the cell
cycle with dephosphorylation occurring at the G2/M transition39.
The absence of this dephosphorylation event suggests impaired
mitotic progression in ciGSK3DKO cells. cipodGSK3DKO cells
then appeared to undergo apoptosis as Western blot analysis of cells
at 7 days revealed increased cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP (Fig. 5f;
Supplementary Fig. 6g). Collectively, these data demonstrate that
cipodGSK3DKO cells were undergoing mitotic catastrophe. We
also looked at our podGSK3DKO and mpodGSK3DKO models and
found evidence of DNA accumulation in their podocytes with
nuclear PCNA staining suggesting they were attempting to re-enter
the cell cycle (Fig. 5g). Furthermore, in the mature mpodGSK3DKO
mice we detected occasional mitotic figures in their differentiated
podocytes (Fig. 5h).
Hippo signalling is disrupted in GSK3 deficient podocytes.
Proteomic analysis also identified that an important protein in
the Hippo-signalling pathway, Ajuba, was significantly increased
by 200–300% in the ciGSK3DKO cells (Figs. 5c and 6a). This was
validated by western blotting in the ciGSK3DKO cells (Fig. 6b;
Supplementary Fig. 8a). Furthermore, an increased level of Ajuba
was also detected in podocytes which had GSK3 pharmacologi-
cally supressed using either lithium and a more specific GSK3
inhibitor called CHIR99201 (Fig. 6c and d; Supplementary
Figs. 8b and 8c). The Hippo pathway leads to phosphorylation of
YAP/TAZ proteins and prevents these proteins from translocat-
ing from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where they bind with
TEAD transcription co-activators and ultimately promote tran-
scription of a number of genes that are associated with pro-
liferation and apoptosis40. Our proteomic analysis revealed
significant up-regulation of a range of YAP/TAZ TEAD targets41
(Supplementary Table 4). Classically, when Ajuba increases it

 inhibits Hippo signalling by preventing the phosphorylation of
YAP/TAZ thereby resulting in the nuclear translocation of these
proteins42. In support of this mechanism we detected nuclear
YAP/TAZ translocation in ciGSK3DKO cells (Fig. 6e), as well as
the lithium and CHIR99201 treated podocytes (Fig. 6f and g).
This was associated with induction of Cyclin B1 in all these
models (Figs. 5e and 6c, d; Supplementary Figs. 6f and 8c).

 protein and a recognised target of YAP/TAZ-TEAD40 (Fig. 7e).
We also detected an increase of another YAP/TAZ TEAD target,
c-myc43 in both podGSK3DKO and mpodGSK3DKO mice
(Fig. 7f and Supplementary Figs. 9c, d). Finally, we examined the
glomeruli of our lithium treated rats and human biopsy. These
both showed increased podocyte Ajuba staining (Fig.7g).
Nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ also occurred in the
podGSK3DKO/β-cateninKO and mpodGSK3DKO/β-cateninKO
mice (Supplementary Fig. 9b) indicating that this process is
independent of Wnt- β-catenin signalling.
We then investigated if inhibiting YAP/TAZ activity in the
nuclei of GSK3α/β knockdown podocytes was beneficial. Treating
ciGSK3DKO podocytes with the YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibitor
verteporfin,
improved
cell
survival
by
approximately
50%
demonstrating that at least some of the adverse effects of
podocyte GSK3 loss are mediated through the Hippo pathway
(Fig. 8a, c; Supplementary Fig. 10a). Western blot analysis showed
that verteporfin was also able to attenuate Cyclin B1 accumula-
tion in ciGSK3DKO cells (Fig. 8b; Supplementary Fig. 10b). This
was also the case in lithium and CHIR99201 treated podocytes
(Fig. 8d, e; Supplementary Figs 10c,10d).
Finally, we assessed the role of Hippo signalling in the
nephrocytes of Drosophila. Verteporfin protected inducible
genetic shaggy knockout nephrocytes from the loss and mis-
localisation of dumfounded (Fig. 9a–c) and also lithium induced
nephrocyte damage (Fig. 9d, e). Collectively this data supports a
key role of dysregulated Hippo signalling when podocyte or
nephrocyte GSK3 activity is lost (Fig. 9f).
Discussion
Here,
we
have
comprehensively
assessed
the
evolutionary
importance of GSK3 in podocytes and nephrocytes, which are key
cells that control excretory function in mammals and Drosophila.
Our findings show that GSK3 is critically important in these cells
both developmentally and in maturity, as sufficient loss of this
enzyme results in severe phenotypes in both distinct species.
We initially assessed the developmental importance of GSK3
using a genetic approach to study the mammalian podocyte in
transgenic mice. This revealed a high level of compensation
between the GSK3 isoforms in the podocyte. Indeed, possessing a
single allele of GSK3α or β was sufficient to maintain normal
function of this cell. In contrast, simultaneous loss of both iso-
forms caused an extreme phenotype with all mice dying in renal
failure in the neonatal period. This severe phenotype was
mimicked in our Drosophila model, where nephrocyte-specific
silencing of shaggy resulted in the complete loss of this cell. This
shows firstly that GSK3’s action in these excretory cell types is
fundamentally
important
and
has
likely
been
preserved
throughout evolution. Secondly, the evolutionary duplication of
GSK3 into two mammalian isoforms is beneficial for the podocyte
as it allows a high level of compensation within this system
should a single isoform be lost. This contrasts to some other cell
types where the β isoform appears to be the predominant
mammalian isoform that maintains normal homeostatic cellular
function44–46.
We then investigated GSK3’s importance in maturity. We
found that mpodGSK3DKO mice developed a spectrum of kidney
disease, ranging from albuminuric mesangial hyper-cellularity to
glomerulosclerosis, severe hypertension and renal failure. In some
mice a proliferative crescentic glomerulopathy ensued, suggesting
that the terminally differentiated podocyte cells had re-entered
the cell cycle. We suspect the variety of kidney disease we
observed was due to variable degrees of efficiency of excision of
GSK3 in this model, and because the mice were on mixed genetic
backgrounds. The crescentic glomerulopathy in 20% of mice is
interesting as the capacity of the mature podocyte to re-enter the
cell cycle and proliferate is widely debated and controversial, but
our studies support previous work suggesting that terminally
differentiated podocytes can re-enter the cell cycle, divide and
form crescents in inflammatory glomerulonephritis47 and in HIV
associated nephropathy48. Conceivably, GSK3αβ loss in the
podocyte could be a common final pathway in a variety of cres-
centic conditions and this is currently under investigation. Our
mature Drosophila studies confirmed that GSK3 is also important
for maintaining nephrocyte function after development in this
species, showing this is also evolutionarily conserved.
After evaluating the key role of podocyte/nephrocyte GSK3 in
our genetic models we investigated whether in vivo pharmaco-
logical inhibition of GSK3 was also detrimental to excretory
function, which we found to be the case both in rodents and
Drosophila. We did this for three reasons: firstly because recent
experimental work has suggested that pharmacologically inhi-
biting podocyte GSK3 activity could be beneficial in treating a
variety of renal diseases, predominantly through suppression of
the β isoform;22,25,26 secondly because there is great therapeutic
interest in pharmacologically inhibiting GSK3 in a number of
important disease processes including type 2-diabetes49, bipolar
disorders21, Alzheimer’s disease21, cardiovascular disease50 and
several cancers51, thereby making it likely that new GSK3 inhi-
bitors will be trialled in patients in the future; and thirdly because
some pharmacological GSK3 inhibitors are currently already
widely used in clinical practice. The commonest of these is the
mood-stabilizer lithium52. This drug is normally well tolerated,
and when administered at doses that achieve therapeutic levels,
only suppresses cellular GSK3 activity by approximately 25%21.
Unfortunately some patients taking lithium develop renal side
effects, the most common being diabetes insipidus, but the most
severe is ESRF, which is 6–8 times more common in these
patients, especially when they have taken the medication for a
prolonged period of time53–55. It has previously been postulated
that lithium-associated ESRF is due to interstitial fibrosis56,

 however, there are multiple reports showing that glomerulo-

deteriorates28,29,57. We suspect that in some patients receiving
lithium there is excessive suppression of GSK3α/β activity in their
podocytes and this leads to glomerular and kidney damage. Going
forward it will be desirable to define precisely which downstream
pathways are differentially regulated by GSK3α and GSK3β in the
podocyte as this could elucidate both the beneficial and detri-
mental pathways that are regulated by this multi-functional
enzyme. Our work, and the recent studies proposing the potential

 therapeutic benefit of suppressing the β isoform alone22,25,26, also
support the development of isoform-specific GSK3 inhibitors as it
is possible that these could be therapeutically beneficial, without
the unwanted side-effects associated with excessive suppression of
both GSK3α and β. Finally, it may be prudent to monitor the
levels of albuminuria in patients who have been on long-term or
high-dose GSK3 inhibitors, such as lithium. Detecting albumi-
nuria would suggest excessive GSK3 inhibition in the podocyte
and may result in reduction of the drug dose or change of ther-
apeutic approach. This could conceivably prevent the patient
from developing chronic or end-stage renal failure.
Mechanistically, we initially hypothesized that the activation of β-
catenin within the podocyte was the major pathway causing cellular
damage when GSK3 activity was lost here, as this is the case in other
cell types lacking GSK3, including neurones35 and mammary cells36.
Furthermore, podocyte β-catenin deletion has been shown to be
protective in a variety of experimental glomerular diseases58, sug-
gesting that its activation is detrimental. However, we did not find
that β-catenin activation was responsible for the detrimental
pathology we observed. Instead we discovered that a lack of podo-
cyte GSK3αβ caused these terminally differentiated cells to re-enter,
but not exit, the cell cycle and to undergo mitotic catastrophe. We
were surprised that this differed from neural progenitors lacking
GSK3α/β, as these cells have several similarities to podocytes
including being terminally differentiated4. Neural progenitors lack-
ing GSK3α and β proliferate uncontrollably due to activation of
Wnt-β-catenin, Notch, and Hedgehog pathways35, which is not the
case in podocytes. Rather, podocytes enter, but fail to exit, the cell
cycle and then undergo apoptosis as a result of mitotic catastrophe
in a manner similar to mature cardiomyocytes that completely lack
GSK359. We suspect that the necessity of GSK3 in controlling cell
cycling in the podocyte explains why our podGSK3DKO mice were
initially unaffected at birth but then developed severe kidney disease
and subsequently died after 10–16 days. This indicates that GSK3
activity is important in the later stages of podocyte development,
facilitating transition from a proliferating to a functional, terminally
differentiated cell. We do not know of any other gene that has been
developmentally knocked out in the podocyte that causes a similar
phenotype.
Sufficient genetic or pharmacological suppression of GSK3 in
the podocyte caused the Hippo pathway to be switched off,
preventing the phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ, resulting in its
subsequent nuclear translocation. Importantly, inhibiting the
effects of nuclear YAP/TAZ translocation with verteporfin
improved podocyte cell survival in ciGSK3DKO cells, showing
that this is an important pathway modulated by this enzyme. This
was also the case in genetic or pharmacologically GSK3-
suppressed nephrocytes showing again that this is an evolutio-
narily conserved pathway in these cell types.
Interestingly, our results show that nuclear YAP/TAZ trans-
location caused by GSK3 loss in podocytes is independent of
Wnt/β-catenin signaling in contrast to observations in other cell
types60. We note that inhibiting nuclear YAP/TAZ actions only
rescued survival in ciGSK3DKO podocytes by 50% and that
inhibiting Notch, Wnt-β catenin, or Hedgehog did not enhance
the survival of the cells. It will therefore be interesting to define
the other critical pathways regulated by GSK3 in the podocyte.
In conclusion, this study has shown that GSK3 is a critical
regulator of cellular function in podocytes and nephrocytes.
Mechanistically it is important for maintaining the differentiated
phenotype of these cells and preventing them from re-entering
the cell cycle resulting in apoptosis through mitotic catastrophe. If
treating patients with GSK3 inhibitors, care needs to be taken to
ensure adequate GSK3 function remains in the podocyte in order
to protect against the development of severe kidney disease.
Methods
Rodent models. Mice in which exon two of GSK3α16 or GSK3β17 has been flanked
by loxP sites were crossed with podocin-Cre mice31 to generate podocyte-specific
GSK3α and/or GSK3β knockout animals from embryonic day 12 (podGSK3DKO
mice) (Supplementary Fig. 1a for breeding scheme). Cre negative mice, or mice
with 2 or 3 of the 4 GSK3 alleles inactivated, served as controls. For the maturity
model podocin rtTA and tet-o-Cre61 mice were crossed with GSK3α/β floxed mice
to generate doxycycline inducible podocyte specific GSK3α/β knockout mice
(mpodGSK3DKO mice) (Supplementary Fig. 2a for breeding scheme). To induce
GSK3 deletion, 4-week old mice were given doxycycline (Sigma) via their drinking
water (2 mg/ml doxycycline in 5% sucrose) for 3 weeks. Controls were podocin
rtTA or tet-o-Cre negative mice together with podocin rtTA and tet-o-cre positive
but without floxed GSK3 genes who also received doxycycline. We confirmed the
cellular specificity of the Cre drivers by crossing the podocin-Cre mouse and the
pod rtTA tet-o-cre mouse with a membrane-targeted dimer Tomato/ Cre mediated
membrane-targeted Green Fluorescent Protein reporter mouse (mT/mG)62 (Sup-
plementary Figs. 1d and 2b).
For the triple GSK3α /GSK3β /β-catenin podocyte specific transgenic mice we also
crossed in the floxed β-catenin mouse floxed Ctnnb1gene encoding β-catenin63 (The
Jackson Laboratory).
All mice were on a mixed genetic background with contributions from 129/SV,
FVB, DBA2J and C57BL/6. Both sexes were studied, and no phenotypic differences
observed.
Transgenic mouse work was carried out in accordance with the University of
Bristol’s institutional guidelines and procedures approved by the United Kingdom
(UK) Home Office in accordance with UK legislation.
For the rat experiments seven male Wistar rats were given lithium at an initial
dose of 40 mmol lithium/kg dry food for 7 days and then 60 mmol lithium/kg dry
food until 6 months of age. Rats given lithium had access to a salt block to maintain
sodium balance and prevent lithium intoxication. This resulted in the rats having
lithium levels similar to those found in humans of 0.3 to 1.3 mmol/l. These rats
were compared to 6 age-matched control male Wistar rats given standard rodent
diet (Speciality Foods, Perth, Australia) for 6 months. This study had ethical
approval from the University of Otago Animals Ethics committee under New
Zealand National Animal Welfare guidelines.
Drosophila husbandry. The Oregon R wild type Drosophila stock, tub-Gal80ts and
shaggy RNAi lines were ordered from Bloomington. dKlf15-Gal4 flies and dKlf15-
TARGET flies were used as previously described64. For temporal shaggy knockout,
adults were reared at 18 °C until eclosure, then transferred to 29 °C. This temperature
shift permits the expression of RNAi to shaggy specifically in nephrocytes at the higher
but not the lower temperature. Driver and RNAi over-expression combinations were
generated by standard crosses. Flies were maintained under standard laboratory
conditions (12 h: 12 h light dark, @ 25 °C, with ad lib access to food).
Cell lines. Conditionally immortilsed podocyte cell lines were cultured in
RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and 1% penicillin/strep-
tomycin. Cells were initially grown at 33 °C to allow proliferation before switching
to 37 °C for 10–14 days to allow cells to differentiate. Cell lines were authenticated
by western blotting for typical podocyte marker proteins.
End point PCR. Genomic DNA was isolated from mouse tissues using a blood and
tissue DNA extraction kit (Qiagen). 500–1000 ng DNA was used in end point PCR
reactions using hotmaster taq polymerase (5 Prime).
Urine and blood analyses. Gross albuminuria was detected using Coomassie
staining of 2 μl of urine run on an SDS-PAGE gel and comparing to bovine specific

 Suite. Image analysis was performed with ImageJ; all images were contrast
enhanced using the same parameters.
Histological abnormalities in mpodGSK3DKO mice were assessed by an
experienced pathologist and scored as follows: 0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate;
3 = severe.
Tissues for electron microscopy were fixed in 0.1 M sodium cocodylate, 2%
glutaraldehyde, and imaged on a Technai 12 transmission electron microscope.
Imaging nephrocytes. The abdomen of adult flies was dissected open and evis-
cerated to reveal the heart and adjacent pericardial nephrocytes. Under phase
optics, nephrocytes are readily identifiable by their characteristic size and anato-
mical location. Specific markers were generated by raising antisera to a peptide
corresponding to amino acids 32–46 of dumbfounded, the Drosophila orthologue
of human KIRREL/NEPH1. Tissues were counterstained with WGA and DRAQ5
to see nuclei. Fixed tissues were imaged using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope and
micrographs taken with Leica Application Suite. Image analysis was performed
with ImageJ; all images were contrast enhanced using the same parameters.
Immunohistochemistry. Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin,
processed and paraffin embedded. Three-micrometre sections were deparaffinised
in Histo-Clear and rehydrated through a graded alcohol series. Antigen retrieval
was in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH6 for either 1 h at 65 °C (activated β-catenin) or by
boiling for 5 min (pGSK3α/β, YAP/TAZ). Sections were quenched using 3% H2O2,
followed by a blocking step in 1% BSA in PBS (activated β-catenin and pGSK3α/β)
or tris buffered saline with 1% tween 20 (TBST) and 5% normal goat serum (Ajuba;
YAP/TAZ; pYAPs127) for 30–45 min. Sections were incubated with primary
antibodies overnight at 4 °C (activated β-catenin 1:500; pGSK3α/β 1:20; Ajuba
1:100; YAP/TAZ 1:100; pYAPs127 1:100). Sections were washed then incubated
with Signalstain Boost detection reagent (Cell Signalling Technology) for 30 min at
room temperature. Signalstain DAB substrate kit (Cell Signalling Technology) was
applied for 1–2 min and the sections dehydrated and mounted in DPX (Sigma).
Tissues were imaged using a Leica DM2000 microscope and micrographs taken
with Leica Application Suite. Image analysis was performed with ImageJ; all images
were contrast enhanced using the same parameters.
IF staining of kidney sections. Frozen kidneys were sectioned at 5 μm. Sections
were blocked in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 3% Bovine Serum
Albumin (BSA) and 0.3% triton X-100 for 1 h, then incubated with primary
antibodies overnight at 4 °C (nephrin 1:300; total β-catenin 1:100; c-myc 1:100).
Following 3 phosphate buffered saline (PBS) rinses, sections were incubated with
fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Fisher) for 1 h at room temperature.
Tissues were imaged using a Leica DM2000 microscope and micrographs taken
with Leica Application Suite. Image analysis was performed with ImageJ; all images
were contrast enhanced using the same parameters.
Stimulation of cultured podocytes with LiCl and CHIR99201. Conditionally
immortalised mouse and human podocytes were incubated with LiCl (Sigma) at
20 mM or CHIR99201 (Sigma) at 3 μM for the times indicated.
Western blotting. Cultured cells or tissue samples were lysed in radio-
immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with protease and phos-
phatase inhibitors (Sigma). Ten to 30 μg of protein was resolved by electrophoresis
then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore).
Membranes were blocked in TRIS-buffered saline with 0.1% tween 20 and 5% BSA
for 1 h then incubated overnight with primary antibody at a dilution of 1:1000.
Membranes were washed before incubation with horseradish peroxidase con-
jugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Immunoreactive bands were visualised using
Clarity ECL Western blotting substrate (Biorad) on a GE AI600 imager. Densi-
tometry was performed using ImageJ software. All uncropped blots can be found in
Supplementary Figs. 11–13.
Lentiviral transduction of GSK3αβ floxed podocyte cell line. Kidneys were
isolated from GSK3αfl/flβfl/fl mice and used to make a temperature-sensitive SV40
conditionally immortalised podocyte cell line as described previously65. Cells were
cultured at 33 °C and when 50% confluent were transduced with a lentivirus
expressing Cre recombinase. Transduction was in RPMI media with hex-
adimethrine bromide (Sigma) at 4 μg/ml and the virus used at a multiplicity of
infection of 1. Following a 24-h incubation, the lentivirus was removed and
replaced with fresh media. Cells were thermo-switched to 37 °C and incubated for a
further 3–7 days before imaging and protein extraction.
Proteomics. GSK3α/β floxed podocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 3 days fol-
lowing overnight transduction with Cre expressing lentivirus. Untransduced cells
and wild-type mouse podocytes transduced with the lentivirus served as controls.
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and subjected to LC-MS/MS using isobaric TMT
labelling using methodology as previously described66.

 Fixed and live imaging of cipodGSK3DKO podocytes. The signalling pathway
agonists/inhibitors Verteporfin (Tocris); iCRT3 (Sigma); DAPT (Merck Millipore)
and GANT61(R and D Systems) were applied at the concentrations indicated
during a 7-day incubation following 24-hour transduction of GSK3α/β floxed cells
with Cre recombinase expressing lentivirus. Cells were stained with Hoechst
(Sigma) at 1 µg/ml, imaged, using an IN Cell analyser 2200 (GE Healthcare) and
cell number determined using IN Cell analyser workstation software (GE
Healthcare).
Live cell imaging was carried out 5–7 days after viral transduction using an
IncuCyte ZOOM cell imaging system (Essen Biosciences).
YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation assay. ciGSK3DKO podocytes or wild-type
podocytes treated with LiCl or CHIR99201 were cultured in 96 well plates
(Corning). Cells were washed three times in PBS, blocked using 3% BSA, 0.3%
triton X-100 for 1 h before overnight incubation at 4 °C with a YAP/TAZ antibody
at 1:100. Following 3 PBS washes, cells were incubated for 1 h with fluorophore-
conjugated secondary antibody. Nuclei were visualised using Hoescht at 1 μg/ml
and cells imaged using an IN Cell analyser 2200 (GE Healthcare). Nuclear/cyto-
plasmic fluorescence intensity was determined using In Cell analyser workstation
software (GE Healthcare).

Fig. 9 Verteporfin attenuates the effects of GSK3 loss in Drosophila. a Knock down of shaggy (sgg) in nephrocytes prevents Duf translocation to the cell
surface and is rescued by verteporfin. Flies were raised at the non-permissive temperature (18 °C, which does not allow sgg RNAi expression) and then
cultured for 48 h at either the same temperature, or at the higher temperature (29 °C, which allows sgg RNAi expression). Cells were maintained in the
presence or absence of 400 nM verteporfin. Nephrocytes were stained with antisera raised to the slit diaphragm protein Dumbfounded (Duf, cyan) as well
as wheatgerm agglutinin (magenta). Duf was expressed at the surface of nephrocytes when RNAi was prevented but surface expression was completely
prevented in when sgg RNAi was initiated. The lack of surface expression was rescued by the presence of verteporfin. Scale bar = 50 µm. b High
magnification images showing rescue of surface expression by verteporfin Sale bar = 40 µm. c Knock down of shaggy (sgg) in nephrocytes prevents Duf
translocation to the cell surface and is rescued by verteporfin. n = 6–7 flies per genotype. ANOVA, **p < 0.01 for sgg TARGET at 29 °C having fewer Duf +
ve nephrocytes than other groups. d Verteporfin rescues lithium induced toxicity in nephrocytes. Adult wild-type flies were reared to between 3–7 days of
age, dissected to reveal the heart and nephrocytes and cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of lithium (20 mM), verteporfin (400 nM) or both.
Scale bar top panel = 30 μm; bottom panel = 10 μm. e Nephrocyte viability was assessed with the vital stain calcein-AM, with nephrocytes being visualised
using wheatgerm agglutinin. Lithium had a significant impact on nephrocyte viability (****p < 0.0001) and this was rescued by the addition of verteporfin
(****p < 0.0001). Means compared by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD. n = 12 flies from two independent experiments. f Cartoon showing the
effect of podocyte GSK3 loss on hippo signalling. GSK3 deletion increases the expression of Ajuba, preventing the phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ and
allowing its translocation into the nucleus. This results in cell cycle re-entry, mitotic catastrophe and ultimately apoptosis. Data are presented as the mean
