AbstrAct
Objective Several clinical trials of cardiovascular disease 
prevention with statins have reported increased risk of 
type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with statin therapy. However, 
participants in these studies were at relatively low risk 
for diabetes. Further, diabetes was often based on self-
report and was not the primary outcome. It is unknown 
whether statins similarly modify diabetes risk in higher risk 
populations.
Research design and methods During the Diabetes 
Prevention Program Outcomes Study (n=3234), the 
long-term follow-up to a randomized clinical trial of 
interventions to prevent T2DM, incident diabetes was 
assessed by annual 75 g oral glucose tolerance testing 
and semiannual fasting glucose. Lipid profile was 
measured annually, with statin treatment determined by a 
participant’s own physician outside of the protocol. Statin 
use was assessed at baseline and semiannual visits.
Results At 10 years, the cumulative incidence of statin 
initiation prior to diabetes diagnosis was 33%–37% among 
the randomized treatment groups (p=0.36). Statin use 
was associated with greater diabetes risk irrespective 
of treatment group, with pooled HR (95% CI) for incident 
diabetes of 1.36 (1.17 to 1.58). This risk was not materially 
altered by adjustment for baseline diabetes risk factors 
and potential confounders related to indications for statin 
therapy.
Conclusions In this population at high risk for diabetes, 
we observed significantly higher rates of diabetes with 
statin therapy in all three treatment groups. Confounding 
by indication for statin use does not appear to explain this 
relationship. The effect of statins to increase diabetes risk 
appears to extend to populations at high risk for diabetes.

InTROduCTIOn
The health benefits of the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-
glutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A reductase inhib-
itors (‘statin’ medications) are thought to 
extend beyond their cholesterol-lowering 
properties. Such pleiotropic actions of statins 
may include favorable effects on systemic 
inflammation, endothelial function and 
oxidative stress,1 important mechanisms 
involved in the etiology of cardiometabolic 
diseases. These effects might be predicted 
to reduce diabetes risk; instead, accumu-
lating evidence suggests that the use of statins 
may increase the risk of developing type 2 
diabetes. Following an initial publication 
reporting this observation,2 meta-analyses of 
randomized clinical trials of lipid-lowering 
with statins have confirmed this effect, and 
suggest that statin treatment is associated with 
a small increase, approximately 10%–12%, in 
the risk of incident diabetes compared with 
placebo,3–6 although not all such analyses find 
increases in diabetes risk.7 
In these cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
prevention trials, diabetes was not the 
primary outcome, diabetes ascertainment 
was not always based on laboratory testing, 
and the absolute risk of developing diabetes 
was relatively low in the study populations. 
These factors may have limited the sensi-
tivity of the evaluations for observing effects

Original research
significance of this study
What is already known about this subject?
 
► In observational studies, statin use has been 
associated with increased risk for diabetes.
 
► Data from randomized statin trials also suggest 
incident diabetes is increased.
What are the new findings?
 
► In a population at high risk for diabetes in which 
incident diabetes was rigorously detected, statin 
use remains a diabetes risk factor.
 
► Incident diabetes among statin users was 
accompanied by a decline in insulin secretion.
How might these results change the focus of 
research or clinical practice?
 
► Patients at high risk for diabetes should be 
monitored during statin therapy.
 
► Additional studies are needed to explore the 
mechanisms for statin-associated diabetes.

Cardiovascular and Metabolic Risk
of statins on diabetes incidence. Diabetogenic effects 
of statins may be more important among individuals 
with higher risk of diabetes. In a post-hoc analysis of 
two of the studies contributing to the meta-analyses, 
the elevated risk appeared to be focused on the subset 
of study participants who had pre-diabetes based on 
elevated glucose readings.8 We therefore conducted an 
analysis to evaluate the statin–diabetes association using 
data from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), 
which studied a cohort of overweight and obese indi-
viduals at high risk for diabetes, followed specifically for 
incident diabetes.
MeTHOds
The DPP was a randomized clinical trial testing interven-
tions to prevent or delay the development of diabetes 
mellitus (DM) among high-risk individuals.9 The 27 
clinical centers in the USA recruited 3234 partici-
pants of both sexes, approximately 50% of whom were 
members of ethnic or racial minority groups and 20% 
of whom were ≥60 years old. The eligibility criteria 
included ≥25 years of age, body mass index (BMI) 
≥24 kg/m2 (≥22 kg/m2 in Asian–Americans), and both 
fasting plasma glucose levels of between 95 and 125 mg/
dL and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (2-hour 75 g 
postload glucose of 140–199 mg/dL). Major exclusions 
included a recent myocardial infarction, symptoms of 
coronary heart disease, major illness, prior diagnosis of 
DM, or treatment with glucose-lowering medications, 
use of medications known to impair glucose tolerance 
and a triglyceride level ≥600 mg/dL. Eligible partici-
pants received standard advice on healthy diet and phys-
ical activity, and were randomly assigned to an intensive 
lifestyle intervention, metformin or placebo. At the end 
of the main trial (mean follow-up 3.2 years), all partici-
pants were offered a group-administered version of the 
lifestyle intervention and were invited to enroll in the 
DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS).10 During the DPPOS, all 
participants were offered quarterly lifestyle sessions, the 
former metformin group received open-label metformin 
and the former intensive lifestyle group was offered two 
additional lifestyle program per year. This report includes 
data up to August 31, 2008, with the median follow-up 
from randomization to the most recent evaluation being 
10.0 years. The protocol was approved by each center’s 
institutional review board and all participants provided 
written informed consent.
Lipid profiles and blood pressure were measured annu-
ally during DPP and DPPOS, and reports were provided 
to the participants, including information as to whether 
lipid levels had reached recommended treatment targets 
as defined by Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III. Prescrip-
tions for lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medications 
were managed by the participant’s own medical provider, 
outside of the study protocol.
Assessment of statin use
In the DPP and DPPOS, statins use was recorded along 
with other concomitant medications based on self-re-
port. This information was collected at baseline and at 
each semiannual follow-up visit, based on the question 
‘Has the participant taken any prescription medications 
within the past 2 weeks?’ Participants were asked to bring 
all prescription pill bottles to each visit and drug name 
was recorded. Cumulative statin use was defined as the 
number of semiannual visits with reported use.
diagnosis of diabetes
Diabetes diagnosis was the primary endpoint for DPP/
DPPOS. This was determined by an annual 75 g oral 
glucose tolerance test or by a semiannual fasting plasma 
glucose level with confirmation by a second test, using 
the standardized criteria of the American Diabetes Asso-
ciation11 and the WHO.12
Assessment of covariate data
Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg semian-
nually. Waist circumference was measured annually in 
the standing position, midway between the highest point 
of the iliac crest and the lowest point of the costal margin 
in the midaxillary line. Semiannual blood pressure meas-
urements were conducted using calibrated anaeroid or 
mercury sphygmomanometers by certified clinic staff, 
calculated as the average of two readings in seated 
participants.13 Data on age, family history of diabetes 
and race/ethnicity were based on self-reports. Fasting 
plasma glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 
and lipid profiles were measured in the Central Biochem-
ical Laboratory (University of Washington, Seattle, Wash-
ington, USA).14 The Insulinogenic Index (I30−I0/Glu30−
Glu0) was used to assess insulin secretion.15
statistical analyses
Between-group comparisons were performed using the 
χ² test of independence for qualitative variables and 
using analysis of variance or t-tests for quantitative varia-
bles. Triglycerides, which have a highly skewed distribu-
tion, were evaluated using the non-parametric Kruskal-
Wallis or Wilcoxon tests. For analyses of changes over 
time in quantitative measures, we used the normal errors 
longitudinal regression model.16 Interaction between 
treatment groups and time was assessed to determine if 
changes over time varied across treatment groups. Anal-
ysis of change from DPP randomization until the anal-
ysis closing date was adjusted for the DPP baseline value. 
The time to statin initiation was censored at the time of 
diabetes diagnosis or at the last visit for those who did not 
develop diabetes, and assessed with the use of life-table 
methods. Modified product-limit curves for the cumula-
tive incidence of diabetes were compared with the use of 
the log-rank test.
Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards 
models were used to assess the time-dependent associa-
tion between statin use and diabetes onset risk. The Wald

test provided p values and R2 values for individual covari-
ates, and the likelihood ratio test was used to evaluate 
contributions of covariates in the combined model. To 
facilitate comparisons of contributions across variables, 
HRs were reported for convenient increments approx-
imating 1 SD of continuous measure. Models were 
run separately for each treatment group, and a test of 
heterogeneity was used to evaluate whether an effect 
differed across treatment groups. Metabolic variables in 
the time-dependent proportional hazards analyses were 
entered as values from the visit immediately preceding 
diabetes evaluation.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 
V.9.4 software. All statistical tests conducted were 
two-sided and p values less than 0.05 were considered 
statistically significant, without adjustment for multiple 
testing.
ResulTs
Statin use was infrequent at DPP baseline (~4%), but 
increased progressively over the duration of the study. 
At 10 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of 
reported statin use prior to diabetes diagnoses was similar 
among the treatment groups, with 35%, 37% and 33% in 
the placebo, metformin and lifestyle groups, respectively 
(p=0.36) (figure 1). The most commonly used statins 
were simvastatin and atorvastatin (40% and 37%, respec-
tively), followed by lovastatin (9%) and pravastatin (8%). 
The prevalence of statin use increased over time and was 
substantially higher following the diagnosis of diabetes 
(online supplementary figure A).
Baseline characteristics of the full study cohort 
(n=3234) according to statin use (at any time during DPP 
or DPPOS) are shown in table 1. Participants who used 
statins were older and more likely to be male, but did not 
differ by race/ethnicity. Statin users had modestly higher 
baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c, and 
lower Insulinogenic Index, than non-statin users, biasing 
these participants toward higher risk for diabetes. Baseline 
levels of LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were higher 
in participants who took statins compared with those not 
on statins. A history of CVD and hypertension was also 
more frequent among statin users. Socioeconomic status 
(defined by years of education and income level) did not 
differ by reported statin use (data not shown). None of 
these variables differed by treatment group assignment.
The HRs for the development of diabetes associated with 
prior statin use are shown in table 2 (and online supple-
mentary figure B). We used sequential models that 
controlled for demographics (age, sex and race/ethnicity; 
model 1); demographics plus baseline diabetes risk 
factors (fasting glucose, Insulinogenic Index, 1/fasting 
insulin and waist circumference; model 2); and models 
for further adjustment for potential confounders related 
to indication for statin use (HDL-C, LDL-C, DBP, SBP, 
history of CVD, SES and antihypertensive use at the visit 
prior to diabetes assessment; model 3). Intervention-re-
lated changes in diabetes risk factor levels (1/fasting 
insulin, Insulinogenic Index, waist circumference) were 
added in model 4, and model 5 represents concurrent 
adjustments of model 2 for indications for statin use and 
changes in diabetes risk factors. In the placebo group, 
the HRs (95% CIs) for diabetes were 1.21 (0.93 to 1.57) 
(model 1, demographics), 1.18 (0.90 to 1.54) (model 
2, baseline diabetes risk factors) and 1.15 (0.87 to 1.53) 
(model 3, indications for statin use). For the metformin 
group, the HR in model 1 was 1.33 (1.02 to 1.73), essen-
tially unchanged following adjustment for diabetes risk 
factors (model 2), but lost statistical significance with a 
modestly lower HR after adjustment for indications for 
statin use in model 3 (HR 1.31 (0.99 to 1.73). Among 
lifestyle participants, the HR was 1.59 (1.21 to 2.10) in 
model 1, essentially unchanged in model 2 (HR 1.53 
(1.16 to 2.03)), and (similar to the metformin group) 
was modestly attenuated and lost significance after 
adjustment for potential statin treatment confounders in 
model 3 (HR 1.36 (1.00 to 1.86)) and changes in diabetes 
risk factors (model 4). Concurrent adjustment for indi-
cations for statin use and updated diabetes risk factors 
(model 5) did not substantially alter the HR in any of the 
treatment groups. The test of heterogeneity comparing 
randomized treatments was not significant in each of 
the models, indicating these HRs were not statistically 
different across treatment groups. With all three treat-
ment groups combined, the HR associated with statin 
use corresponding to model 1 was 1.36 (1.17 to 1.59). We 
found no interaction between sex and statin use (or total 
statin exposure) on diabetes risk.
We also analyzed diabetes risk in relation to duration of 
statin exposure (figure 2), defined as number of semian-
nual visits with reported statin use. Baseline statin users 
(n=141) were excluded from this analysis since dura-
tion of use prior to study enrollment was not available. 
Longer duration of statin use was significantly associated 
with greater diabetes risk in the lifestyle group (HR per 
visit with statin use: 1.06 (1.02 to 1.11), p=0.007). In the

Cardiovascular and Metabolic Risk
metformin and placebo group, the HRs per visit reported 
with statin use were 1.01 (0.96 to 1.06) and for placebo 
1.02 (0.97 to 1.07), respectively. Although neither of 
these reached statistical significance, the relationship of 
duration of exposure with diabetes risk was not statisti-
cally different between groups (p=0.26 testing heteroge-
neity of these relationships across treatment groups).
To assess whether statin potency was related to diabetes 
risk, we grouped reported statin use into ‘low potency’ 
(pravastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, 19%) or ‘high potency’ 
(atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, cerivastatin, 81%) 
categories. Diabetes risk did not differ by low versus high 
potency statins, with HR of 0.96 (0.68 to 1.35), using the 
same adjustments in model 5. Information about statin 
dose was not available, but statin dose and/or potency 
may be reflected in the magnitude of LDL reduction. 
We therefore assessed diabetes HR according to change 
in LDL-cholesterol, but found no association (data not 
shown). There was no apparent effect of statin potency 
to modify the effect of statin use on diabetes incidence.

Figure 2 Diabetes hazard rates by number of visits 
with reported statin use. The risk of developing diabetes 
associated with the duration of exposure to statin therapy 
estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. The 
symbol on each line indicates the expected hazard rate 
for a subject with a number of visits with reported statin 
therapy equal to the mean value for the group over the 
group-specific range (5th–95th percentile). The risk for 
progression to diabetes by number of visits with reported 
statin use was calculated for each treatment group with 
model 5 from table 2. The number of semiannual visits 
with reported statin use significantly predicted progression 
to diabetes only in the lifestyle group (p=0.007); this 
relationship was not significantly different across the three 
groups (heterogeneity p=0.26).
Cardiovascular and Metabolic Risk
We explored potential mechanisms by which statins 
may promote diabetes by analyzing mean change from 
baseline in insulin sensitivity (fasting insulin) and insulin 
secretion (Insulinogenic Index), according to statin use 
(table 3). In the active treatment groups, diabetes preven-
tion was associated with favorable reductions in glucose 
and weight, and improvements in beta cell function.17 18 
Statin use was associated with significantly smaller favor-
able changes in fasting glucose, 2-hour glucose, HbA1c 
and BMI. In the lifestyle group, Insulinogenic Index 
declined with statin use, compared with modest increase 
without statin use (p=0.013). There were no significant 
changes in fasting insulin in any of the groups, and no 
apparent pattern of change that would suggest an effect

that the statin-treated participants were relatively resis-

obesity and beta cell function.
dIsCussIOn
This report is the first to evaluate the statin–diabetes 
association within a randomized clinical trial designed to 
carefully ascertain diabetes incidence in subjects at high 
risk for diabetes. In this analysis, statin use was associ-
ated with a clear increase in diabetes risk in the cohort 
as a whole, with point estimates of the HRs suggesting 
this risk is increased by close to 30%. This augmented 
risk was only modestly attenuated with adjustment for 
variables related to the indication for statin treatment, 
suggesting that the indications for therapy were not 
themselves major contributors to diabetes risk. Partici-
pants who were prescribed statins had modestly higher 
levels of glucose at baseline, yet this also did not explain 
the higher rates of diabetes among statin users. Our 
data suggest the statin-associated diabetes risk did not 
differ significantly by treatment group, based on a test

of statistical interaction. Nonetheless, the lower point 
estimate of the HR in the placebo group could reflect 
their more rapid progression to diabetes,9 providing less 
opportunity for statin exposure to demonstrably modify 
the rate of progression to overt diabetes. It is also possible 
that the somewhat higher HRs in the active treatment 
groups could reflect a less robust response to the inter-
vention among those with greater baseline diabetes risk, 
who were also more likely to receive statin therapy (atten-
uation in model 4).
The earliest report of a statin–diabetes association19 
suggested a protective effect of pravastatin on diabetes 
incidence, although diabetes incidence was not deter-
mined using standardized criteria. Subsequent statin 
trials did not confirm this protective effect, and in the 
Justification of the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Inter-
vention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) statin 
treatment was associated with an increase in physician-di-
agnosed diabetes (relative risk: 1.25; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.49). 
In a meta-analysis of six statin trials (including JUPITER), 
statin use was again associated with increased diabetes 
risk (OR: 1.13; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.23).20 This finding 
has subsequently been confirmed by others, including 
a large meta-analysis that included seven additional 
studies, which together included over 90 000 partici-
pants, of whom 4.9% were assigned to statins and 4.5% 
were assigned to placebo-developed diabetes (OR: 1.09; 
95% CI 1.02 to 1.17).3 Similar HRs for statin-associated 
diabetes have been reported by other investigators.5 6 21 22 
In the Women’s Health Initiative,21 statin use at base-
line was associated with increased risk of self-reported 
diabetes during follow-up (HR 1.71 (1.61 to 1.83)). 
Further, risk appeared to increase with longer duration 
of statin therapy. Similar to our analysis, adjustment for 
possible confounders related to statin use attenuated but 
did not eliminate the increased risk (adjusted HR 1.48 
(1.38 to 1.59)), indicating that the factors leading to 
statin use were not themselves sufficient to explain the 
observed increase in diabetes.
It has been suggested that statins may ‘uncover’ diabetes 
in individuals at high risk, which, on a population basis, 
could result in modest increase in diabetes risk. In a 
post-hoc analysis of the Treat to New Targets and Incre-
mental Decrease in Clinical Endpoints Through Aggres-
sive Lipid Lowering trials, the effects of statins to magnify 
diabetes risk were much more strongly evident among 
those with pre-diabetes than those without pre-diabetes.8 
Similarly, within the JUPITER trial,20 77% of those in 
the intervention arm who developed diabetes during 
follow-up had impaired fasting glucose at study entry, and 
further analysis showed that increased statin-associated 
diabetes risk in this study was limited to participants who 
had at least one major diabetes risk factor. In an analysis 
of three other statin trials, fasting glucose, triglycerides, 
BMI and hypertension emerged as baseline clinical 
predictors of incident diabetes.23 These observations, 
along with the numerically higher estimates of statin-as-
sociated HRs observed in our analyses in DPP partic-
ipants, suggest that the statin effect is more important 
among those with pre-existing diabetes risk. Paradoxi-
cally, however, variation in baseline diabetes risk factors 
failed to explain the further risk associated with statin 
therapy in our cohort, and the HR estimate was greatest 
among our lifestyle participants, who experienced the 
largest study-related reductions in diabetes risk.
The mechanisms contributing to effects of statins to 
modify diabetes risk are poorly understood. A number of 
studies have assessed changes in insulin sensitivity (mostly 
using Homeostasis Model Assessement - insulin resis-
tance (HOMA-IR)) during statin treatment. A meta-anal-
ysis by Baker et al showed that statins differ in their effect 
on insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic subjects, with simvas-
tatin decreasing insulin sensitivity, pravastatin increasing 
sensitivity, and atorvastatin and rosuvastatin showing no

effect.24 In vitro data suggest that some statins may impair 
insulin signaling and reduce expression of the insulin-re-
sponsive glucose transporter, GLUT-4.25 26 We saw no 
evidence of an effect of statins to modify insulin resis-
tance, assessed as fasting insulin concentrations. Statins 
have been reported to reduce pancreatic beta cell insulin 
secretion in vitro, but the relevance to insulin secretion 
in vivo is not known.27 28 A recent report in metformin-
treated subjects with type 2 diabetes demonstrated a 
reduction in insulin secretion (HOMA-β), no effect of 
1 year of treatment with atorvastatin or pravastatin on 
insulin sensitivity (measured by euglycemic clamp) and 
modest deterioration in glycemic control (HbA1c).29 
Our data show evidence for greater deterioration in 
insulin secretion among statin users, although this was 
only statistically demonstrated in subjects randomized 
to the lifestyle arm. This pattern is consistent with previ-
ously described metabolic changes underlying progres-
sion to diabetes among high-risk individuals30 and with 
our observation that participants in the DPP/DPPOS 
lifestyle arm who progressed to diabetes had a higher 
genetic risk score, which largely reflects polymorphisms 
related to beta cell functioning.31 Overall, this suggests 
an acceleration of typical glycemic deterioration, rather 
than a unique or statin-specific mechanism.
The strengths of the current analysis include rigorous 
diabetes 
ascertainment, 
prolonged 
follow-up 
and 
updated information about statin use every 6 months. 
The main limitation of this analysis is that statin treat-
ment was not randomized or protocol-driven, but was 
based on non-study physician assessments of need for 
statin treatment based on factors related to CVD risk. 
The observed association between statin use and diabetes 
risk in this population was not significantly attenuated 
after controlling for potential confounders related to 
indication for statin use. In addition, statin use was based 
on self-report, which could have resulted in some misclas-
sification. Intensity of statin therapy has been reported to 
affect diabetes risk,32 33 but since statin dose is not avail-
able in our cohort, our ability to assess this is limited. 
For individual patients, a potential modest increase in 
diabetes risk clearly needs to be balanced against the 
consistent and highly significant reductions in myocar-
dial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death associ-
ated with statin treatment. Nonetheless, glucose status 
should be monitored and healthy lifestyle behaviors rein-
forced in high-risk patients who are prescribed statins for 
CVD prophylaxis.
