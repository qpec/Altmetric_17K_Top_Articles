ABSTRACT
Aims
This review provides an up-to-date curated source of information on alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use and their
associated mortality and burden of disease. Limitations in the data are also discussed, including how these can be ad-
dressed in the future. Methods
Online data sources were identified through expert review. Data were obtained mainly
from the World Health Organization, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and Institute for Health Metrics and Eval-
uation. Results
In 2015, the estimated prevalence among the adult population was 18.4% for heavy episodic alcohol
use (in the past 30 days); 15.2% for daily tobacco smoking; and 3.8, 0.77, 0.37 and 0.35% for past-year cannabis, am-
phetamine, opioid and cocaine use, respectively. European regions had the highest prevalence of heavy episodic alcohol
use and daily tobacco use. The age-standardized prevalence of alcohol dependence was 843.2 per 100 000 people; for can-
nabis, opioids, amphetamines and cocaine dependence it was 259.3, 220.4, 86.0 and 52.5 per 100 000 people, respec-
tively. High-income North America region had among the highest rates of cannabis, opioid and cocaine dependence.
Attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were highest for tobacco smoking (170.9 million DALYs), followed by
alcohol (85.0 million) and illicit drugs (27.8 million). Substance-attributable mortality rates were highest for tobacco
smoking (110.7 deaths per 100 000 people), followed by alcohol and illicit drugs (33.0 and 6.9 deaths per 100 000 people,
respectively). Attributable age-standardized mortality rates and DALYs for alcohol and illicit drugs were highest in eastern
Europe; attributable age-standardized tobacco mortality rates and DALYs were highest in Oceania. Conclusions
In 2015
alcohol use and tobacco smoking use between them cost the human population more than a quarter of a billion disability-
adjusted life years, with illicit drugs costing further tens of millions. Europeans suffered proportionately more, but in abso-
lute terms the mortality rate was greatest in low- and middle-income countries with large populations and where the qual-
ity of data was more limited. Better standardized and rigorous methods for data collection, collation and reporting are
needed to assess more accurately the geographical and temporal trends in substance use and its disease burden.

GLOBAL STATISTICS ON ADDICTION
doi:10.1111/add.14234
 INTRODUCTION
Alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use are major global risk
factors for disability and premature loss of life [1]. Their
health burden is accompanied by significant economic
costs, namely expenditure on health care and law enforce-
ment, lost productivity and other direct and indirect costs,
including harm to others [2]. Estimating the prevalence of
use and associated burden of disease and mortality at
country, regional and global levels is critical in quantifying
the extent and severity of the burden arising from sub-
stance use. This knowledge should inform allocation deci-
sions by governments, policymakers and funding bodies
about service provision and policy and assist in evaluations
of the impact of policies [3]. These estimates must be devel-
oped rigorously, updated regularly and be geographically
comprehensive to quantify and detect change in indicators
over time.
There are various research groups that regularly com-
pile estimates of the global prevalence of substance use, de-
pendence and related disability and mortality. It is useful to
collate these collections to provide an overall global picture
of the distribution of substance use and associated mortal-
ity and burden of disease and to highlight key gaps in
evidence. Indeed, these data are critical to monitoring
progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals [4],
particularly those requiring quantification of the preva-
lence of substance use and dependence to calculate appro-
priate treatment and intervention coverage. This review is
part of an ongoing series [5] which has two purposes, to: (i)
curate recent estimates of the prevalence of use, depen-
dence, mortality and burden of disease associated with al-
cohol, tobacco and illicit drugs at country, regional and
global levels and (ii) comment on the availability and qual-
ity of existing data collections and identify challenges in es-
timating and comparing substance use and related burden
geographically and temporally. For the purpose of this
review, illicit drug use was defined as use of a substance
where consumption has been prohibited by international
drug control treaties except for medical purposes [3]. For
illicit drugs, we focused upon use of cannabis, noting that
policy regarding cannabis use and supply varies in some
countries, (e.g. United States, the Netherlands [6]), meth-
amphetamine, cocaine, as well as extra-medical opioid
use, (i.e. use that is without a prescription or not as directed
by a doctor [7]). We also briefly considered estimates
related to use of new psychoactive substances (NPS;
see Box 1 for details about NPS).
METHODS
Design
We identified online data sources on alcohol, tobacco and
illicit drug use, dependence and attributable burden of
disease and mortality through web searches and e-mail
consultations with experts in the epidemiology of sub-
stance use. This review focused upon data collections at
the global level, which also disaggregate estimates at
country and/or regional levels. These collections are held
mainly by the following organizations: World Health Orga-
nization (WHO); United Nations Office on Crime and Drugs
(UNODC); and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evalua-
tion’s (IHME) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2015.
Details of data collections and reporting by these organiza-
tions (including links to downloadable data) are provided in
Table 1, and regional classifications of countries for each
organization are provided in Supporting information,
Appendix S1. The section below overviews the indicators
of interest, and data sources used, for the present paper.
It should be noted that these organizations use different
approaches for identifying source data and modelling
estimates,
and
thus
comparison
of
estimates
from
different organizations may not be valid (see Discussion
for further details).
Prevalence of substance use
Indicators of interest comprised the annual prevalence of
alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use (including NPS and
injecting drug use) among the adult population in 2015.
Estimates of the prevalence of alcohol use for 2015 for
the adult population (aged ≥ 15 years) by region and glob-
ally were obtained from the WHO Collaborating Centre for
Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) for validation and
later inclusion into the Global Status Report on Alcohol
and Health 2018 and the Global Information System on
Alcohol and Health [14].
Global and regional estimates of the age-standardized
prevalence of daily tobacco smoking in the adult popula-
tion were obtained from the GBD study 2015 [15]. This
indicator underestimates total prevalence in countries
such as the United States, where non-daily smoking is
relatively common but still represents substantial use.
Figures on non-daily smoking were not available for many
countries. This indicator also does not include non-smoked
forms of tobacco (which is common in many parts of
the world). Global and regional estimates of the annual
prevalence of illicit drug use and NPS use among the adult
population (age 15–64 years) in 2015 were obtained from
the UNODC World Drug Report 2017 [10], with reference
to the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and
Other Drugs 2015 report [11]. Estimates of the prevalence
of injecting drug use for 2015 in the adult population
(age 15–64 years) were obtained from the UNODC
World Drug Report 2017 [10], the GBD study 2015 [15]
and from a recent multi-stage systematic review of peer-
reviewed and grey literature on the global epidemiology
of injecting drug use [16].

 Box 1: Monitoring new psychoactive substance (NPS) use and harms
• New psychoactive substances (NPS) are substances which have similar acute psychoactive effects to established illicit
drugs but are not controlled under international drug controls [8].
• There has been a growth in the number of NPS notified to the European Union (EU) early warning system for the
first time (see figure below), although the rate growth in 2016 declined [9].
• This expanding production makes monitoring the prevalence of NPS use challenging, and there are substantial gaps
in knowledge about the extent of NPS use. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) World Drug
Report 2017 [10] has listed estimates of prevalence of NPS use for only 15 countries since 2006.
• UNODC’s country-level estimates of past year NPS use [10] are typically < 1% of the sampled population. They
are derived mainly from adolescent and young adult samples and are typically specific to a NPS class (e.g. piperazines)
or substance (e.g. mephedrone) [10].
• Higher rates have been reported from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs 2015 [11],
with 3% of 15–16-year-old European school students reporting any NPS use at least once in the past 12 months,
and higher prevalence in Estonia and Poland (8%).
• Reported prevalence may be low among the general population, but needs to be considered in the context of
considerable epidemiological challenges in this area, which include problems with the definition of NPS and a lack
of standardized measurement tools.
• Indeed, self-report data are becoming less reliable for assessing drug groups such as NPS, where consumers may be
unaware or misinformed of the substance they have consumed. Various indicators can be monitored and triangu-
lated to better quantify NPS use and associated harms, e.g. ambulance attendances, emergency department presen-
tations, poisons and toxicology data, and law enforcement drug seizures [12].
• Key to monitoring NPS is early detection of NPS entering the market which have the capacity to cause
substantial harm to the consumers, as illustrated by the recent emergence of highly potent synthetic
opioids [9].
• Although NPS comprise a minority of the drugs for sale on surface and darknet websites [13], monitoring these sites
can yield timely and regular data on changes in the NPS market.

The table lists global data sources used in the current paper; details in the above table were correct as of 6 September 2017. aReporting on these indicators may not be available for all substances listed in the prior column. Excluding alcohol and
tobacco, ‘use’ typically refers to unsanctioned use of psychoactive drugs whose possession and/or supply is illegal in most jurisdictions or prescription medications (primarily opioids) that are being used in an unsanctioned way
. Hazardous/
problem use varies in definition according to substance and organization. bDownloadable data may not be available for all substances/indicators. DALYs = disability-adjusted life years; YLL = years of life lost; YLD = years lost due to disability;
HCV = hepatitis C virus; HBV = hepatitis B virus; TB = tuberculosis.

 Prevalence of substance dependence
Indicators of interest comprised the prevalence of past-
year alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug dependence among
the adult population in 2015. Modelled estimates of
global and regional all-age number and age-standardized
rate (per 100 000 people) of past-year dependence on al-
cohol, amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and opioids were
obtained from the GBD study 2015 by region [15]. Esti-
mates of smoked tobacco dependence are not modelled
in the GBD study. Daily smokers have a very low proba-
bility of successful quitting in any given attempt [17],
and so daily smoking was considered indicative of a sig-
nificant level of dependence in the current study. Sub-
stance
dependence
was
defined
according
to
the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
IV edition [18] and the International Classification of
Diseases 9th or 10th editions [19]. We used this rather
than ‘substance use disorder’ as defined in DSM 5th edi-
tion, because that is the most commonly available indi-
cator globally.
All-cause substance-attributable mortality
Estimates of smoked tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug all-
cause attributable mortality from all disease and injuries
were obtained from the GBD study 2015 [15]. The re-
gional and global number of all-age attributable deaths
and age-standardized death rate (per 100 000) are
presented.
Substance attributable burden of disease
Disease burden caused by alcohol use, tobacco smoking
and illicit drug use as risk factors are presented. Burden
of disease was presented for substance use attributable
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which are the sum
of years of life lost (YLLs) to premature mortality and years
of life lived with disability (YLDs). Modelled estimates of
global and regional attributable DALYs (all-ages) and age-
standardized (per 100 000 people) attributable DALYs for
alcohol, smoked tobacco and illicit drugs for the adult
population were obtained from the GBD study 2015 [15].
We also obtained estimates of the serological prevalence
of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody among the
adult population (age 15–64 years) who inject drugs from
the UNODC World Drug Report 2017 [10] and from a re-
cent multi-stage systematic review of peer-reviewed and
grey literature on the global epidemiology of injecting drug
use [16].
Analyses
Modelled estimates are presented as obtained from source
documents. Uncertainty intervals (UI) are presented
where available to indicate the uncertainty range around
the estimate; the way in which these intervals were
generated differs across data collections (see details in
Table notes).
RESULTS
Substance use
Globally, CAMH [14] estimated that 6.43 litres of pure
alcohol per capita were consumed by the adult popula-
tion (aged ≥ 15 years) in 2015 (Table 2). Approximately
one-fifth (18.4%) of the adult population [or two-fifths
(39.6%) of all adult alcohol consumers] reported heavy
episodic drinking (≥ 60 g alcohol on one occasion) in
the past 30 days (Table 2; Fig. 1a). Central, Eastern and
Western Europe recorded consistently higher alcohol
consumption per capita (11.64, 11.55 and 11.13 litres,
respectively) and a higher percentage of heavy consump-
tion among consumers (49.5, 46.9 and 40.2%, respec-
tively). North Africa and the Middle East recorded the
lowest alcohol consumption per capita (0.90 litres pure
alcohol) and the lowest percentage of alcohol consumers
who reported heavy drinking (15.4%). Central sub-
Saharan Africa showed unique findings, with the highest
proportion of heavy consumption (78.9%) despite a
relatively low per capita consumption (4.14 litres).
The GBD study 2015 [15] estimated that the same
European
regions
also
recorded
the
highest
age-
standardized prevalence of daily tobacco smoking [east-
ern Europe 24.2% (22.7, 25.7), central Europe 23.7%
(22.6, 24.8) and western Europe 20.9% (20.2, 21.7)],
with the lowest prevalence recorded in western sub-
Saharan Africa [4.7% (4.3, 5.1)]. The European regions
and southeast Asia had a smoking prevalence that was
significantly higher than the global prevalence (Table 2
; Fig. 1b). Globally, the age-standardized prevalence of
daily smoking was 15.2% (14.7, 15.7). There were
933.1 (901.5, 966.5) million people who smoked to-
bacco daily. China [268.3 million (263.3, 273.5)],
India [104.2 million (99.2, 109.6)] and Indonesia
[53.7 million (49.6, 58.3)] had the largest number of
smokers that together accounted for 45.7% of daily
smokers globally.
Global estimated annual prevalence of illicit drug use
as reported in the UNODC World Drug Report 2017 [10]
was highest for cannabis [3.8% (2.7, 4.9) of adults
aged 15–64 years], followed by amphetamines [0.77%
(0.30, 1.24)], opioids [including prescription opioids
and opiates; 0.37% (0.27, 0.49)] and cocaine [0.35%
(0.27, 0.46); Table 3]. There was substantial subregional
variation in prevalence, particularly for cannabis use
[1.8% (1.0, 3.0) in Asia to 10.3% in Oceania (8.7,
14.7)]. The UNODC World Drug Report 2017 [10] also
collates estimates of NPS use. Fewer than 1% of sampled
populations (typically household surveys or surveys of

aGrouping of countries reflect Global Burden of Disease (GBD) classification. bData were made available by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, as reported 18 January 2018, for 2015 by country, for validation and
later inclusion into the Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health 2018 and the Global Information System on Alcohol and Health [14]. cRecorded APC is the recorded amount of alcohol consumed per capita (15+ years) over a calendar year
in a country, in litres of pure alcohol, calculated according to the mid-year resident population (15+ years) for the same calendar year, according to the UN World Population Prospects. dHeavy episodic drinking is the proportion of adults (15+
years) who have had at least 60 grams or more of pure alcohol on at least one occasion in the past 30 days (computed from the total number of participants (15+ years) responding to the corresponding question(s) in the survey plus abstainers).
eHeavy episodic drinking (drinkers only) is the proportion of adult drinkers (15+ years) who have had at least 60 grams or more of pure alcohol on at least one occasion in the past 30 days [computed from the total number of respondents (15+
years, appropriately weighted) to the corresponding survey question(s) who reported having consumed an alcoholic standard drink (10 grams) within the past 12 months on the same survey (or 1-abstainers)]. fLife-time and past 12-month
abstainers are the proportion of adults (15+ years) in a given population who have not consumed any alcohol during their life-time or past 12 months, respectively, assessed at a given point in time (computed from the total number of participants
(15+ years) responding to the corresponding question in a given survey). Former drinkers is the proportion of adults (15+ years) in a given population who did not consume alcohol in the last 12 months, but who did previously, assessed at any
given point in time (computed from the total number of participants (15+ years) responding to the corresponding question in a given survey). gData on daily tobacco smoking were extracted from the GBD study 2015 [15]. In the GBD study, 95%
uncertainty intervals (UIs) are derived from 1000 draws from the posterior distribution of each step in the estimation process. The UIs capture uncertainty from multiple modelling steps and from sources such as model estimation and model
specification.

 school students) reported use of specific NPS in the past
year (see Box 1 for discussion of limitations and future
directions of monitoring NPS use).
In the UNODC World Drug Report 2017 [10] it was
estimated that 0.25% (0.18, 0.36) of the adult popula-
tion aged 15–64 years reported injecting drug use in
2015, equating to 11.8 million (8.6, 17.4) people
(Table 3). In contrast, a recent global systematic review
[16] estimated that 0.33% (0.21, 0.49) of the adult
population reported injecting drug use in the past
year in 2015. This equates to 15.6 million (10.2, 23.7)
people (Fig. 2).
Substance dependence
Globally, alcohol dependence was the most prevalent sub-
stance of dependence (Table 4), with 63.5 million (57.5,
69.9) estimated cases in 2015: an age-standardized rate
of 843.2 (763.7, 927.3) per 100 000 people. Cannabis
and opioid dependence were the most common types of il-
licit drug dependence, with 19.8 (18.0, 21.8) and 16.8
(14.7, 19.1) million cases in 2015 [age-standardized rates
of 259.3 (235.7, 285.5) and 220.4 (193.1, 251.0) per
100 000 population], respectively. Amphetamine and co-
caine dependence were less prevalent, with 6.6 million

Data in the table above were extracted from the ‘Maps and Tables’ of the UNODC World Drug Report 2017 [10], and estimates here were as reported by UNODC on 6 September 2017. The annual prevalence rate is defined as the number of
people who have consumed the drug at least once during the 12 months prior to the study, expressed as a percentage of the population aged 15–64 years, as provided by the United Nations Population Division for 2015. Estimates refer to
unsanctioned use; that is, where possession and/or supply is illegal or prescription medications are being used in an unsanctioned way. Estimates are derived from country-level annual report questionnaire data and other official sources. Sub-
regional estimates are computed where prevalence estimates for at least two countries covering at least 20% of the population were available; � denotes that an estimate was not available. Uncertainty ranges were calculated using UNODC’s
regional and global estimation methods, taking the 10th percentile of the lower bounds of the uncertainty ranges and the 90th percentile of the upper bounds of the uncertainty ranges, based on the 90% confidence intervals or best available
estimates available for countries with data within the regions (see [31] for further details of calculation uncertainty ranges). aGrouping of countries reflect United Nations Statistics Divisions, showing regions and within these sub/intermediate
regions, noting that some intermediate regions are clustered (e.g. West and Central Africa). bAmphetamines include both amphetamine and methamphetamine. cCocaine includes cocaine salt, ‘crack’ cocaine and other types such as coca paste,
cocaine base, basuco, paco and merla. dOpioids includes prescription opioids and opiates (including heroin and opium). ePrevalence for Caribbean and Latin America is 0.21 (0.11–0.39) for injecting drug use. fPrevalence for Near and Middle East
Asia (0.07, 0.02–0.12) and South-West Asia (0.38, 0.29–0.48) are reported separately for prevalence of injecting drug use.

 (5.3, 8.0) and 3.9 million (3.4, 4.3) cases globally in 2015
[corresponding to age-standardized rates of 86.0 (69.2,
104.6) and 52.5 (46.6, 58.7) people per 100 000 popula-
tion], respectively.
The high prevalence of different types of substance de-
pendence in some regions reflected their higher prevalence
of substance use. For example, the high-income North
America region (the United States and Canada) had one
of the most prevalent rates of cannabis, opioid and cocaine
dependence [748.7 (694.8, 812.3), 650.0 (574.5, 727.3)
and 301.2 (269.3, 333.7) per 100 000 people, respec-
tively]. Australasia (Australia and New Zealand) had the
highest prevalence of age-standardized rates of amphet-
amine dependence [491.5 per 100 000 people (441.4,
545.5)], as well as high rates of cannabis, opioid and
cocaine use dependence [693.7 (648.1, 744.4), 509.9
(453.7, 577.8) and 160.6 (136.4, 187.1) per 100 000
people,
respectively].
Age-standardized
prevalence
of
amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and opioid dependence
were largely lowest in central sub-Saharan Africa, eastern
sub-Saharan Africa and western sub-Saharan Africa.
The most marked regional variation was in alcohol depen-
dence: the highest age-standardized rate was in eastern
Europe [2786.7 (2487.3, 3109.6) per 100 000 people]
and the lowest in North Africa and the Middle East
[274.2 (241.7, 309.3) per 100 000 people].
Substance use attributable mortality and burden of disease
Globally, the highest age-standardized rates of mortality
were for smoked tobacco as a risk factor at 110.7 (101.0,
120.3) per 100 000 deaths, compared to 33.0 (28.0,
37.7) and 6.9 deaths 6.9 (6.1, 7.6) per 100 000 people
in 2015 for alcohol and illicit drugs, respectively (Table 5;
Supporting information, Appendix S2). Alcohol and illicit
drug attributable age-standardized mortality rates were
highest in eastern Europe [108.0 (63.5, 152.4) and 23.7
(21.0, 25.9) deaths per 100 000 deaths, respectively]. To-
bacco smoking attributable mortality rates were highest
in Oceania [which includes, e.g. Papua New Guinea,
Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Solomon Islands;
269.3 (184.4, 382.9) deaths per 100 000 deaths].
Variations in burden of disease estimates by types of
substance as risk factors largely reflected those for mortal-
ity. Absolute burden was highest for tobacco smoking, with
170.9 million (156.2, 186.0) tobacco smoking attributable
DALYs (see Supporting information, Appendix S2 for
smoking and second-hand smoking attributable DALYs).
This was followed by 85 million (77.2, 93.0) alcohol attrib-
utable DALYs and 27.8 million (24.4, 31.2) illicit drug at-
tributable DALYs 2015 (Table 4; Fig. 3). Estimates of
alcohol and illicit drug attributable burden rates were
highest in eastern Europe [4033.5 (3259.9, 4795.1) and
1386.5 (1229.6, 1535.4) age-standardized DALYs per
100 000 population, respectively]. Tobacco-attributable
burden rates was highest in Oceania [7149.7 (4888.1,
10491.5)
age-standardized
DALYs
per
100 000
population].
Alcohol-attributable burden was due primarily to cir-
rhosis [17.0 million DALYs (15.6, 18.3) all ages], transport
injuries [16.8 million DALYs (14.9, 18.9)] and cancers
[12.1 million DALYs (11.1, 12.9)] [15]. Illicit drug attrib-
utable burden was concentrated in drug use disorders
[16.9 million (14.0, 19.9), of which 12.9 (9.9, 14.1) were

 opioid use disorders-attributable], cirrhosis [4.7 million
(3.8, 5.5)], HIV infection [3.0 million (2.6, 3.6)] and liver
cancer [1.8 million (1.4, 2.1)] [15].
A recent global systematic review [16] estimated that
there are 8.2 million (4.7–12.4) people who inject drugs
who are HCV antibody-positive, and that 2.8 million
(1.5–4.5) people who inject drugs are living with HIV
. This
is equivalent to 52.3% (42.4–62.1%) and 17.8% (10.8–
24.8%) of people who inject drugs globally, respectively.
The UNODC World Drug Report [10] also included esti-
mates of HCV among people who inject drugs (51.7%,
equating to 6.1 million people, no uncertainty interval
available) and of HIV among people who inject drugs
[13.1%, equating to 1.6 million (0.9–3.2)].
DISCUSSION
Main findings
Alcohol use and tobacco smoking are far more prevalent
than illicit substance use globally and in most regions.
Global estimates suggest that one in five adults report
at least one occasion of heavy episodic alcohol use in the
past month, increasing their risk of acute harm, e.g. injury
[14]. Nearly one in seven adults were estimated to engage
in daily tobacco smoking, increasing their risk of 12 types
of cancer, non-malignant respiratory diseases, cardiovas-
cular disease and a wide array of other chronic health con-
ditions [21]. In contrast, use of illicit drugs was far less
common. Fewer than one in 20 people were estimated to
use cannabis in the past year, and much lower estimates
were observed for amphetamines, opioids and cocaine.
The majority of the health burden from substance use
was attributable to tobacco smoking (the most prevalent
substance) and the smallest attributable to use of illicit
drugs. There was substantial geographical variation in
these estimates and several caveats (discussed below) need
to be borne in mind when interpreting these data.
Data availability
Certain countries and regions (e.g. Africa, Caribbean and
Latin America, Asia regions) have limited or no data on
substance use and associated health burden. These are typ-
ically low- or middle-income countries that frequently have
punitive drug policies, and may experience serious political
and social unrest. These countries often warrant enhanced
monitoring because they are at risk of rapid escalation in
substance use and related health burden. For example, a
recent review found evidence of injecting drug use in 23
countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where it had not been
documented previously [16]. However, only seven of the
37 countries that had evidence of injecting drug use in
the sub-Saharan Africa region offered needle–syringe
programmes, and only eight offered medication-assisted

Data in the table above were extracted from the GBD study 2015 [15]. Age-standardized rates (age SDR) is the rate per 100 000 people, estimated using the GBD world population age standard. Substance dependence was defined according to
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [18] and the International Classification of Diseases [19]. Data are derived from systematic review of peer-review and grey literature, including estimates from studies published since
1980, and data were modelled using DisMod-MR 2.1; 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were derived from 1000 draws from the posterior distribution in the estimation process. Data were available for 180 countries for alcohol dependence, 55
countries for amphetamine dependence, 151 countries for cannabis dependence, 43 countries for cocaine dependence and 32 studies for opioid dependence. In the GBD study, 95% UIs are derived from 1000 draws from the posterior distribution
of each step in the estimation process. The UIs capture uncertainty from multiple modelling steps and from sources such as model estimation and model specification. aGrouping of countries reflect GBD classification.

Data in the table above were extracted from the GBD study 2015 related to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths attributable to substance use disorders [15]. Age-standardized rates is the rate per 100 000 people, estimated using the
GBD world population age standard. Data are derived from systematic review of peer-review and grey literature, including estimates from studies published since 1980, and data were modelled using DisMod-MR 2.1; 95% uncertainty intervals
(UIs) were derived from 1000 draws from the posterior distribution in the estimation process. In GBD, 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) are derived from 1000 draws from the posterior distribution of each step in the estimation process. The UIs
capture uncertainty from multiple modelling steps and from sources such as model estimation and model specification. Uncertainty associated with estimation of mortality and YLLs reflects sample sizes of data sources, adjustment and stan-
dardization methods applied to data, parameter uncertainty in model estimation and uncertainty within all-cause and cause-specific mortality models. For estimation of prevalence and YLDs, UIs incorporated variability from sample sizes within
data sources, adjustments to data to account for non-reference definitions, parameter uncertainty in model estimation, and uncertainty associated with establishment of disability weights [20]. aGrouping of countries reflect GBD classification.

 treatment for opioid dependence. The coverage of interven-
tions, where they were offered, was very low [22]. These
countries face the risk of a rapid escalation in HIV infection
among people who inject drugs.
In countries where no data have been collected, an al-
ternative is to impute prevalence. Imputed prevalence
can be based on prevalence in neighbouring countries
and country-level predictors. The GBD study uses disease
modeling—Metaregression DisMod [23] to fill gaps where
data are incomplete to produce prevalence and disease bur-
den estimates for each disease cause, age group, sex, coun-
try and year. There are, however, substantial uncertainties
in these modelled estimates. This can be reduced only as
better epidemiological evidence becomes available.
Data quality and estimation
The quality of estimates is often poor when data are avail-
able. For example, there is greater geographical coverage in
estimates of alcohol use because consumption can be mon-
itored more effectively via surveys [24], and taxation, pro-
duction, import and export data are available to produce
estimates of consumption [25]. However, unrecorded con-
sumption, which is estimated to account for approximately
25% of all alcohol use globally, introduces marked mea-
surement error [26]. Similarly, prevalence of daily tobacco
smoking obtained from the GBD study 2015 did not in-
clude non-daily smoking and abstinence among those
who have ever smoked; see [27] for further details of
estimation of prevalence of tobacco smoking in GBD, which
varies considerably across countries [28]. Indeed, a review
of 16 countries showed a substantially lower rate of absti-
nence among people who formerly smoked tobacco daily
in China, India, Egypt, Russia and Bangladesh (< 20%) rel-
ative to similar indicators in the United Kingdom, United
States, Brazil and Uruguay (> 35%) [28]. Further, the esti-
mates of prevalence of daily tobacco smoking did not in-
clude smokeless tobacco product use, as well as the use of
e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn tobacco products. Given
the emerging trends of non-cigarette products, it would
be useful to have these modelled separately to monitor
changes in prevalence over time for different types of to-
bacco products in the population.
The need to measure progress towards various targets
for improving global health has facilitated progress in stan-
dardizing epidemiological indicators throughout studies
[4,29]. Nonetheless, there is no gold-standard method for
estimating how many people use or are dependent upon al-
cohol, tobacco and illicit drugs, and no single method is
ideal for all substances in all national contexts (Table 6).
General population surveys rely on honest self-report of
substance use. Marginalized groups with high levels of
problematic substance use (e.g. prisoners, homeless peo-
ple), or those living in countries where substance use is for-
bidden or stigmatized for religious or cultural reasons, are
often excluded from such surveys. This leads to underesti-
mates of the prevalence of the most stigmatized and
harmful forms of substance use in ways that can vary
Table 6 Estimating the size of the population that uses drugs.
Method
Summary
Limitations
Population surveys
Representative sample is directly asked
about drug use in a specified time-period
Participants may be reluctant to disclose drug use
due to illegality, stigma or concerns about confidentiality
Typically exclude groups with high levels of problematic
drug use e.g. prisoners; homeless people [3]
Multiplier
A benchmark (e.g. number of people receiving drug
treatment in a year) is adjusted by a multiplier (e.g.
proportion of people who use drugs who report
receiving drug treatment in a year) to give a population
size estimate
Data used to generate multiplier may not be
representative of the population of people who use drugs,
giving a multiplier that is too small or too large [8]
Capture–recapture
Population size is modelled based on the proportion of
the population that is identified within more than one
data source
Data sources may not be independent; e.g. criminal
justice agencies may refer individuals to treatment
agencies. This violates assumption of independence of
capture–recapture models [30]
Network
scale-up
Population size is modelled based on reports from
participants in general population samples on the
number of people in the target population who are in
their personal social network
Assumes that participants are aware of their social
contacts being members of the target population and that
members of the target population have a personal
network of the same size as the general population [32]
Multiple parameter
evidence synthesis
Bayesian synthesis of all available evidence, including
potential biases affecting such evidence, to give an
estimate that is consistent with all evidence and
internally validated
Complex relative to other methods and technically
difficult to implement [32]

 geographically [3]. Indirect methods of estimating preva-
lence for more stigmatized forms of substance use (e.g.
multiplier, capture–recapture, network scale-up) may be
biased by data limitations, e.g. dependencies between data
sources in capture–recapture studies [30]. Even the use of
multiple indirect methods to estimate a single population
size may not remedy biases in individual methods, as
estimates may be inconsistent with each other, and
simply averaging across estimates is not guaranteed to re-
duce
bias
[31].
Multi-parameter
evidence
synthesis
addresses these limitations by triangulating all available
evidence (including estimates of potential biases), but this
approach is complex and technically challenging to im-
plement [32].
Differences in estimates also occur throughout data col-
lections. For example, we reported estimates of global prev-
alence of injecting drug use from the UNODC World Drug
Report 2017 0.25% (0.18, 0.36) [10] and a recent system-
atic review of peer-review and grey literature 0.33% (0.21,
0.49) [16]. In this instance, data sources used within each
country to model prevalence were mostly the same and the
uncertainty intervals overlapped, suggesting that preva-
lence lies somewhere within this range. However, the var-
ious collections are based on different search processes,
criteria for source data inclusion and modelling approaches
to derive global estimates. For example, crude data in-
cluded as input for analysis in the GBD study 2015 were
extracted from national data systems (e.g. vital statistics,
disease registries, demographic surveillance systems), sur-
veys (e.g. household surveys), clinical informatics (e.g. dis-
ease notification data, health service encounter data such
as hospital in-patient episodes), grey literature [e.g.
government/country reports, European Monitoring Centre
for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)] and scientific
literature, e.g. peer-reviewed papers containing health-
related data [33]. The GBD study 2015 used disease model-
ing—Metaregression DisMod [23], which checks internal
consistency of existing estimates and fills gaps where data
are incomplete to produce prevalence and disease burden
estimates [34]. The GBD study 2015 also produced UIs
which capture uncertainty from sample sizes of data
sources, multiple modelling steps and from sources such
as model estimation and model specification [20]. In con-
trast, the UNODC [35] derive data primarily from the An-
nual
Reports
Questionnaire
(ARQ)
completed
by
Governments of Member States each calendar year. Esti-
mates are computed using various adjustments, and impu-
tation for countries where data are missing based on
countries in the same subregion. Upper and lower uncer-
tainty range estimates are calculated at a 90% confidence
interval among those aged 15–64 years; see [35] for fur-
ther details of methods. However, global estimates from
these organizations cannot be combined to identify the
‘true’ prevalence. Instead, we require the collection of
high-quality data and interrogation of estimation methods
to maximize their consistency.
Quantifying burden of disease and mortality
There must be direct evidence that exposure to alcohol, to-
bacco or illicit drugs is (to some degree) linked to a health
outcome before any such injury or disease is quantified
within attributable burden [36]. This is challenging, be-
cause risk can vary according to substance type, frequency
and quantity of use, route of administration, and concom-
itant use of substances. The quality of epidemiological data
also varies across substances, with stronger evidence for
the effects of alcohol and tobacco than for illicit drugs.
The GBD study [15] represents one effort to review, synthe-
size and evaluate the weight of evidence regularly to sup-
port attribution (wholly or in part) to use of the specific
substance (see Supporting information, Appendix S3 for
disease conditions included in attributable burden quantifi-
cation in 2015).
There are a number of injury and disease categories
where there is growing epidemiological evidence for cau-
sality, (e.g., depression attributable to alcohol and drugs
[37]) and biologically plausible attribution based on the
pharmacodynamics of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs.
These factors suggest that we underestimate the true bur-
den of alcohol, tobacco and especially illicit drug use. The
degree of underestimation will be reduced by high-quality
studies on the acute and chronic causal effects of sub-
stances (e.g. emergency room studies, autopsy studies
and, in particular, longitudinal cohort studies with record
linkage to administrative health data) and comprehensive
systematic reviews of these studies that assess the relative
risk for incidence of injuries and diseases.
There are also limitationsin the mortalitydata modelled
in the GBD study. Data on causes of death are dependent
upon the quality of death certificates, verbal autopsies and
the study’s method for code reassignment to probable cause
of death when deaths are assigned codes that cannot be the
underlying causes of death. For example, recent US re-
search has showncorrectedopioid-relatedmortalitycounts
and rates 21–35% higher than original estimates from
1999–2015 when missing data on the specific opioid un-
derlying drug poisoning deaths were imputed [38]. Future
research on the validity of code redistribution methods
(e.g. for drug overdose deaths) and higher-quality original
data (including integrating verbal autopsies with vital sta-
tistics) will improve mortality estimates [39]. Further de-
tails on the limitations on the cause of death modelling
method in the GBD study are published elsewhere [40].
It is important to acknowledge that estimates of burden
quantify only the health consequences primarily for the
consumer and largely omit effects on others (with some ex-
ceptions, e.g. effects of fetal alcohol exposure, second-hand

 smoking). They also do not quantify broader social and
economic burdens imposed by substance use.
Measuring trends
We did not investigate trends over time in substance use
and related burden in this review, although trend analyses
have been conducted in other publications, e.g. [41]. The
quality of trend data is considerably poorer for illicit drugs
than for alcohol and tobacco consumption, where many
countries have high-quality epidemiological data on use
and consumption data over many years.
To assess change in substance use and burden validly
we need national surveillance systems that have been con-
ducted regularly and consistently over time in their defini-
tion of indicators, data collection methods, sampling and
geographical coverage. Guidelines on epidemiological indi-
cators, e.g. [28], and methods of measuring indicators, e.g.
[42], will facilitate use of consistent approaches over time
and between countries. The ability to implement regular
studies are limited by the significant costs and resources
needed to establish and regularly conduct surveillance
studies, particularly population surveys. Improved data
collection and estimation may mean that apparent tempo-
ral changes reflect variation in methods rather than ‘true’
changes in the indicator of interest.
One potentially useful new approach, particularly for il-
licit drug use, is to monitor levels of drug metabolites and
residues in wastewater. Wastewater analyses can provide
trends in total population-level consumption of licit and
illicit drugs, as indexed by a population-normalized load of
drug residue within the catchment area of wastewater
treatment plants typically mg/1000 people/day [43,44].
Direct inferences about changes in the number of people
who use drugs or their patterns of use cannot be made
using these data, but it may provide objective information
that is not subject to under-representation of population
groups or self-report bias as with surveys. Wastewater anal-
ysis may help to identify the full spectrum of pharmacolog-
ical compounds consumed, including low prevalence drugs
(e.g. NPS) and substances that are unknowinglyconsumed,
e.g. mephedrone where sold as MDMA [44]. Further,
wastewater can be sampled and tested regularly in near
real-time. Various surveillance systems globally [44] now
include wastewater data alongside survey results and indi-
rect statistical methods to monitor spatiotemporal trends.
CONCLUSIONS
Alcohol, tobacco and illicit substance use are important
contributors to global burden of morbidity and mortality.
Tobacco and alcohol are used more commonly and make
larger contributions to disease burden that illicit drugs,
we know the latter’s burden has greater issues of
underestimation because of greater limitations of data
availability and quality. Regular compilations of global data
on geographical variations in prevalence of substance use
and disease burden, such as this, may encourage the im-
provements in data and methods required to produce bet-
ter future estimates.
