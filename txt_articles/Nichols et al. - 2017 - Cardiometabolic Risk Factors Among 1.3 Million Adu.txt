Abstract
Introduction
Various phenotypes of overweight and obesity pose various health
risks. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence
of 4 commonly measured cardiometabolic risk factors (CRFs)
among adults with overweight or obesity, but not diabetes, at the
time of the study.
Methods
We analyzed data for 1,294,174 adults (aged ≥20 y) who were
members of one of 4 integrated health systems. Each cohort mem-
ber had a body mass index in 2012 or 2013 that indicated over-
weight or obesity. We determined the presence of 4 CRFs within 1
year of the first BMI measurement: elevated blood pressure
(systolic ≥130 mm Hg or diastolic >85 mm Hg or ICD-9-CM [In-
ternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification] diagnosis code 401.0–405.9); elevated triglycerides
(≥150 mg/dL or ICD-9-CM 272.1); low high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (<40 mg/dL for men or <50 mg/dL for women or ICD-
9-CM 272.5); and prediabetes (fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dL or
HbA1c 5.7%–6.4% or ICD-9-CM 790.2x). We tested the risk of
having 1 or more CRFs after adjusting for obesity class and demo-
graphic characteristics with multivariable logistic regression.
Results
Among participants with overweight (52.5% of the sample),
18.6% had none of the 4 CRFs. Among the 47.5% of participants
with obesity, 9.6% had none; among participants with morbid
obesity, 5.8% had none. Age was strongly associated with CRFs in
multivariable analysis.
Conclusion
Almost 10% of participants with obesity had no CRFs. Over-
weight or obesity increases cardiometabolic risk, but the number
and type of CRFs varied substantially by age, even among parti-
cipants with morbid obesity.
Introduction
More than two-thirds of US adults have a body mass index (BMI)
that indicates overweight or obesity (1), yet the prevalence of dia-
betes is approximately 9% (2), and the estimated lifetime risk of
diabetes (40%) is lower than the prevalence of overweight or
obesity (3). Thus, although obesity is a major risk factor for type 2
diabetes, the condition does not develop in many individuals with
excess weight. A study based on the National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES) for 1999 through 2004,
which included individuals with diabetes, showed that 51% of
adults with overweight and 32% of adults with obesity had no car-
diometabolic risk factors (CRFs) or only one (4), which suggests
that various phenotypes of overweight and obesity may pose vari-

 ous health risks. Because diabetes is a consequence of CRFs, pre-
ventive efforts should be implemented before diabetes develops.
Characterization of individuals with overweight or obesity, but not
diabetes, is needed. The ability of health systems to identify phen-
otypes of overweight or obesity through the use of electronic
health records (EHRs) would facilitate efficient allocation of pre-
ventive resources to reduce the incidence of diabetes and cardi-
ovascular disease (CVD). The objective of our study was to de-
termine the proportion of adults whose BMI indicated overweight
or obesity and who did not have diabetes but did have 4 com-
monly measured CRFs (elevated blood pressure, elevated trigly-
cerides, low high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, and pre-
diabetes) in a large diverse cohort in a consortium of 4 health care
delivery systems.
Methods
Patient Outcomes Research to Advance Learning (PORTAL) is a
consortium of 4 health care delivery systems — Kaiser Perman-
ente (Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Mid-Atlantic States, Northern
California, Northwest, and Southern California), GroupHealth Co-
operative (Washington State), HealthPartners (Minnesota), and
Denver Health — and their 10 research centers (5). Together,
these health care delivery systems serve 12 million individuals in
11 states and the District of Columbia. PORTAL was one of 11
clinical data research networks (CDRNs) funded by the Patient-
Centered Outcomes Research Institute (6). Each CDRN was re-
quired to create a “weight cohort” of individuals in its network.
The development and analysis of the PORTAL cohort were ap-
proved by the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Institution-
al Review Board; the other sites ceded review to this board.
Study sample
The PORTAL weight cohort is described elsewhere (7). Briefly,
the cohort consisted of adults (aged ≥18 y) who were members on
December 31, 2013; each member had at least 12 months of con-
tinuous membership at some point between January 1, 2012, and
December 31, 2013, and each had a primary care encounter in
2012 or 2013, during which a weight was recorded. We excluded
members whose EHRs lacked data on a height measurement and
women who were pregnant in 2012 or 2013. The PORTAL weight
cohort consisted only of adults with a body mass index (BMI,
weight in kilograms [kg] divided by height in meters [m] squared)
of 23.0 or greater, so the full range of data on adults with normal
weight (BMI, 18.5−24.9) or underweight (BMI <18.5) were not
available. We excluded adults aged 18 or 19 to make our data
comparable with data from NHANES. We also excluded adults
who had any indication of diabetes in their EHR, regardless of dia-
gnosis, using the SUPREME-DM (SUrveillance, PREvention, and
ManagEment of Diabetes Mellitus) algorithm; this algorithm re-
quires 1 inpatient diagnosis (250.x) from the International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-
9-CM) or any combination of 2 outpatient events (diagnoses, dia-
gnostic laboratory tests, or fulfillment of anti-hyperglycemic med-
ication) (8).
These exclusions resulted in a cohort of 3,434,066 adults. We fur-
ther excluded adults who lacked complete data on the 4 CRFs of
interest, resulting in an analytic sample of 1,294,174. To assess the
effect of missing data, we compared the demographic characterist-
ics of adults with complete CRF data and adults without complete
CRF data and conducted sensitivity analyses by repeating our
primary analyses among the total cohort, assuming adults with a
missing CRF value did not have that risk factor.
Classification of overweight and obesity
We used the first available record of weight in 2012 or 2013 as the
index date and calculated BMI from the nearest available height as
the index value and classified the adult as overweight (BMI of
23.0–27.4 if Asian or 25.0–29.9 otherwise) or obese (BMI ≥27.5 if
Asian or ≥30.0 otherwise) (9). Our large cohort allowed us to fur-
ther categorize adults with obesity: obese (Class I, BMI 27.5–34.9
if Asian or 30.0–34.9 otherwise); severely obese (Class II, BMI
35.0–39.9); or morbidly obese (Class III, BMI ≥40.0).
Cardiometabolic risk factors
Blood pressure and laboratory values (triglycerides, HDL choles-
terol, fasting plasma glucose, and glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c])
were collected from the EHR by using the value closest to and up
to 1 year before the index date. We defined 4 dichotomized (yes/
no) CRFs: 1) elevated blood pressure (systolic value of ≥130 mm
Hg or diastolic value of >85 mm Hg or an ICD-9-CM code from
401.0 to 405.9); 2) elevated triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL or an ICD-
9-CM code of 272.1); 3) low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dL for
men and <50 mg/dL for women or an ICD-9-CM code of 272.5);
and 4) prediabetes (HbA1c value of 5.7%–6.4% or a fasting gluc-
ose value of 100–125 mg/dL or an ICD-9-CM code of 790.2x).
We included ICD-9-CM codes for each CRF to allow for treated
adults to be assigned appropriately to a category of elevated risk,
regardless of clinical values.
Statistical analyses
We first tabulated data on our cohort descriptively. Because of the
cohort’s large size, we chose not to tabulate P values because even
small clinically insignificant differences were statistically signific-
ant at a P value <.001 (1-way analysis of variance). We stratified
the data by age group to demonstrate the importance of age to the

 type and number of CRFs; we constructed a multiple logistic re-
gression model using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North
Carolina) to assess the independent contribution of demographic
characteristics and overweight or obesity to the probability of hav-
ing at least 1 CRF.
Results
Of the 1,294,174 adults included in the study, 52.5% were over-
weight and 47.5% were obese (Table 1). Adults with obesity were
about 3 years younger and more likely to be women and non-His-
panic black or Hispanic than adults with overweight. In each suc-
cessive obesity class (Class I through Class III), we observed a
younger age and a higher proportion of women and non-Hispanic
black adults. Crude and age-adjusted mean and median values of
the CRFs were generally similar among adults with overweight
and adults with obesity across obesity classes; age adjustment
slightly magnified the differences, particularly for blood pressure
and triglycerides.
Of the 4 CRFs studied, elevated blood pressure was the most pre-
valent (59.9%), followed by prediabetes (47.2%), low HDL cho-
lesterol (33.7%), and elevated triglycerides (32.2%) (Table 2). The
prevalence of these CRFs increased across overweight and obesity
classes, except for triglycerides, where prevalence for obesity
Class III was lower than for obesity Classes I and II. The preval-
ence of each CRF varied widely among age groups.
The prevalence of having none of the CRFs was 14.3% and varied
by degree of overweight or obesity and age (Table 3). Among
adults with overweight (52.5% of the sample), 18.6% had none of
the 4 CRFs. Among the 47.5% adults with obesity, 9.6% of had
none of the CRFs, and among adults with morbid obesity, 5.8%
had none. Prevalence of having none of the CRFs was 29.2%
among adults aged 20 to 34 but ranged in this age group from
40.0% (overweight) to 10.4% (obesity Class III). Only 6.3% of
adults aged 65 to 79 had no CRFs; prevalence in this age group
ranged from 8.4% (overweight) to 1.4% (obesity Class III).
Compared with overweight, obesity Class I was associated with a
90% greater probability (OR, 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.88–1.91) of having at least 1 CRF; Class II was associated with
a nearly 3-fold greater probability (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.80–2.87);
and Class III was associated with a 4-fold greater probability (OR,
4.07; 95% CI, 4.00–4.14) (Figure). Older age was associated with
a greater probability of having a CRF: by age 65, the probability
of having at least 1 CRF was 5-fold greater (OR, 5.07, 95% CI,
5.00–5.14) than it was at age 20 to 34. Men were 45% more likely
than women to have at least 1 CRF. Compared with non-Hispanic
white adults, Hispanic, Asian, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islander
adults were significantly more likely to have at least 1 CRF, and
non-Hispanic black adults were 28% less likely.

2013. Because of the large sample size, 95% confidence intervals were
narrow and cannot be depicted in the graphic. The logistic model equation
was Y = −1.44 + 0.66 (Age Category 1) + 1.16 (Age Category 2) + 1.62 (Age

Probability(Outcome) = [exp(Y)]/(1+ exp(Y).
 
Adults with complete clinical data were older but were otherwise
similar to those with incomplete data; we found nearly identical
distributions of overweight or obesity classes. Results were al-
most the same as those of the primary analytic sample when we
reanalyzed the data using the entire 3,434,066-person sample and
assumed those with a missing CRF value did not have that risk
factor. The prevalence of each CRF was lower, but the odds ratios
in the logistic regression were similar and the patterns were con-
sistent with those of the primary analytic sample.
Discussion
In this observational cohort study of approximately 1.3 million
adults with overweight or obesity, we found that 4 commonly
measured CRFs often associated with excess weight were preval-
ent. The prevalence of elevated blood pressure, elevated trigly-
cerides, low HDL cholesterol, or prediabetes varied overall from
32% to 60% and, depending on the category of overweight or
obesity, from 27% to 72%. However, 14% of the cohort had none

 of the 4 CRFs. Among adults with morbid obesity, 6% had none
and 23% had only 1 CRF. Thus, although overweight or obesity is
itself a CRF, the prevalence and number of the 4 CRFs of interest
varied.
The prevalence of CRFs varied across age groups; increased age
was strongly and independently associated with CRFs. One inter-
pretation of this finding is that young adults had not had sufficient
time to develop risk factors. BMI is an imperfect measure of
obesity for any age group and may inaccurately indicate the ef-
fects of obesity on adults older than 65 (10). Thus, we suggest
caution when interpreting the associations of age-related CRFs and
BMI on adults older than 65. However, in our study, adults in the
3 obesity classes were on average 3 years younger than adults in
the overweight category, and adults with morbid obesity were on
average 7 years younger than adults with overweight. Addition-
ally, low HDL cholesterol was the most common CRF among
adults younger than 35. Although our findings on age and HDL
cholesterol may seem counterintuitive, they may have resulted
from the study design, which excluded adults who had diabetes. If
so, our results reflect the distribution of adults with overweight or
obesity who are at risk for diabetes more accurately than previous
reports. Our results underscore the concern that increases in the
prevalence of obesity at ever younger ages is perhaps the most im-
portant public health problem in the United States. Low HDL cho-
lesterol among young adults may be an early warning sign of
CVD.
We limited our data to adults who had contact with the health sys-
tem: each cohort member had at least 1 primary care visit recor-
ded in the EHR. As a result, our cohort may not have included
healthy adults who perceived no need for medical care. This po-
tential bias was somewhat mitigated by our limiting the cohort to
adults with overweight or obesity. Furthermore, even among
adults with morbid obesity, some had none of the 4 CRFs. To the
extent that healthy adults were excluded, we may have under-
stated the proportion with none of the CRFs, especially among rel-
atively young adults and those with low excess weight.
Individuals with obesity but no cardiometabolic abnormalities
have been considered to have “metabolically healthy obesity”
(MHO) (11), but the meaningfulness of this term is controversial.
Individuals with MHO are at increased risk of type 2 diabetes
(12–14), and a recent study showed that the obese phenotype, re-
gardless of metabolic abnormalities, increases the risk of chronic
kidney disease (15). MHO, however defined, is not a harmless
condition, and may simply be evidence of slower metabolic re-
sponses to obesity that will equalize in the long run. Nevertheless,
the risk of CVD and death among individuals with MHO is not
clear. In a study using data from the third NHANES, rates of mor-
tality risk among participants with obesity and cardiometabolic ab-
normalities and participants with MHO were similar and were
nearly 3 times greater than rates for cardiometabolically normal
participants with normal weight (16). Conversely, a clinical study
of nearly 15,000 cardiometabolically healthy participants found
that levels of coronary artery calcium were significantly greater
among participants with obesity than among normal-weight parti-
cipants, but the association was no longer significant after adjust-
ment for CRFs (17). An observational study of more than 22,000
participants found that participants with MHO were not at higher
risk of all-cause mortality or CVD (18). A recent systematic re-
view  reported  that  a  minority  of  studies  found  associations
between MHO and CVD and mortality, although 4 of 6 studies
that examined subclinical CVD reported greater risk for patients
with MHO than for cardiometabolically healthy patients with nor-
mal weight (19). Lack of uniformity in the definition of MHO is
likely contributing to these conflicting results.
Given that nearly 35% of the US adult population has a BMI that
indicates obesity (1), the variation in the number and type of CRFs
that we report suggests the need for further research to clearly
define the phenotypes of body weight to better identify risk and
deliver appropriate interventions. Development of risk factors is a
dynamic process: with each additional CRF, CVD risk rises expo-
nentially (20). However, phenotypes may vary by CVD risk,
which in turn depends on which CRFs are present and the order in
which they develop (20). Study of the progression of cardiometa-
bolic risk is a vitally important area for further research and re-
quires a large data set with several years of longitudinal data. Our
study’s observational design and cross-sectional data did not al-
low us to assess morbidity or mortality risk over time, but several
more years of data have now accumulated at each participating
site. Because PORTAL is just one of 11 CDRNs, all of which
were required to generate a weight cohort using a common data
model, the possibility of conducting such a study that includes pa-
tients from all 50 states is a reality (6).
The size of our cohort allowed us to explore differences in the pre-
valence of CRFs across classes of obesity among a diverse group
of adults without diabetes. To our knowledge, such data have not
been reported until now. Compared with non-Hispanic white
adults, we found that Hispanic, Asian, and Hawaiian/Pacific Is-
lander adults were substantially more likely to have CRFs, but
non-Hispanic black adults were less likely. Although this finding
may seem counterintuitive, it is consistent with a previous report
(4). Furthermore, as with younger age, non-Hispanic black indi-
viduals with greater levels of obesity may have greater mortality
and higher diabetes incidence rates than individuals in other racial/
ethnic groups, factors that would disproportionately exclude them
from our analytic data set. Our findings within and between racial/
ethnic categories demonstrated disparities in the association

 between overweight or obesity and CRFs. Research is needed to
determine whether current cut-points for assessing CRFs are ap-
propriate for all races, ethnicities, and age groups and to determ-
ine how the presence or absence of CRFs affects cardiometabolic
outcomes differently.
Our study has several limitations in addition to those mentioned
previously. We were unable to include several other potential ex-
planatory factors that differentiate patients within categories of
overweight or obesity. First, the ratio of visceral fat to subcu-
taneous fat differentially affects a person’s risk of CVD and mor-
tality (10,21), which is why most accepted definitions of metabol-
ic syndrome require assessment of waist circumference rather than
BMI (20). Second, cardiorespiratory fitness may play a more im-
portant role than body composition in developing CRFs, such that
the “fat but fit” patient has less risk than the “lean but unfit” pa-
tient (22). The incidence of diabetes decreases as cardiorespirat-
ory fitness increases, regardless of obesity (23). Third, in conjunc-
tion with exercise that produces cardiorespiratory fitness, diet can
affect CRFs (24,25). Adults with overweight or obesity in our
study who had no risk factors may have been actively attempting
to lose weight through diet and exercise, thus producing a more fa-
vorable risk profile. Fourth, systemic inflammation, often meas-
ured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, contributes to cardi-
ometabolic risk (26), although it is not commonly included in
definitions of cardiometabolic health (14). Fifth, cigarette smoking
independently affects CRFs and cardiometabolic events (24,25).
Sixth, family history as a marker for genetic predisposition affects
CRFs and cardiometabolic risk (27). Each of these 6 unmeasured
variables, alone or in combination, could explain the differential
distribution of the number of CRFs across overweight or obesity
categories but were not available in our data set. However, the in-
clusion of these data as explanatory variables would not have
changed the distributions of CRFs across the weight and demo-
graphic categories reported herein.
The comprehensiveness of the EHR data collected by the particip-
ating health systems fostered the assessment of cardiometabolic
measurements among much of their patient populations. Neverthe-
less, a potential weakness of our study was that data for at least 1
of the CRFs studied were missing from the EHRs of more than
half of the otherwise-eligible adults. The sensitivity analyses,
which considered missing data as equivalent to not having the
CRF,  reduced  the  prevalence  of  CRFs,  but  the  relationship
between demographic characteristics and the probability of cardi-
ometabolic health was not affected. This finding suggests our res-
ults are robust.
The size and diversity of our study population allowed us to exam-
ine overweight or obesity levels and classes of obesity in numbers
sufficiently large to identify meaningful associations. However,
the large sample size also resulted in statistically significant res-
ults even when differences were minute and clinically insignific-
ant. In some of the participating health plans, individuals with low
socioeconomic status may be underrepresented. However, all
health plans (except one) included individuals covered by state-
subsidized insurance, and Denver Health’s mission is to serve
those with limited ability to pay for medical services. Neverthe-
less, our sample may not fully represent the unemployed and un-
deremployed, all levels of education, and other social determin-
ants of health. Adults with high incomes may also have been un-
derrepresented. Although the PORTAL cohort is large, it does not
include individuals from all 50 states and, therefore, may not be
fully representative of the United States. Because adults with a
BMI of less than 23.0 were not included in the data set, the over-
all effect of overweight or obesity on the prevalence of CRFs rel-
ative to normal weight cannot be evaluated. We could not ascer-
tain whether triglyceride levels were measured in a fasting state or
nonfasting state, which could have led to some misclassification of
that CRF.
The number and type of adverse CRFs varied substantially among
1.3 million adults with overweight or obesity but not diabetes. Al-
though most adults had at least 1 CRF, some had none. As re-
cently recommended (20), future studies should examine the or-
der in which CRFs develop in individuals with overweight or
obesity and identify the characteristics of individuals who have
none.

a We defined 4 dichotomized (yes/no) cardiometabolic risk factors: 1) elevated blood pressure (systolic value of ≥130 mm Hg or diastolic value of >85 mm Hg or
ICD-9-CM code from 401.0 to 405.9); 2) elevated triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL or an ICD-9-CM code of 272.1); 3) low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dL for men and <50
mg/dL for women or an ICD-9-CM code of 272.5); and 4) prediabetes (HbA1c value of 5.7%–6.4% or a fasting glucose value of 100–125 mg/dL or an ICD-9-CM
code of 790.2x). Individuals were required to have either a fasting glucose test (84.7% of the total) or an HbA1c test (40.4%).
b Data source: PORTAL weight cohort (7).
c All values are column percentages.
d All between-group comparisons are significant at P < .001 (1-way analysis of variance) because of the large sample size.
e Overweight defined as BMI of 23.0–27.4 for Asians and 25.0–29.9 for all other race/ethnicities.
f Class 1 obesity defined as BMI of 27.5–34.9 for Asians and 30.0–34.9 for all other race/ethnicities.
