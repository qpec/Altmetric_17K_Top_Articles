Genetic amplification, overexpression, and increased signaling from the epidermal growth factor re-
ceptor (EGFR) are often found in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and thus EGFR is frequently
targeted molecularly by the therapeutic antibody cetuximab. We assessed effects of cetuximab in control
of EGF-driven malignant traits of OSCC cells. EGF stimulation promoted progression level of mesen-
chymal traits in OSCC cells, which were attenuated by cetuximab but incompletely. We pursued a po-
tential mechanism underlying such incomplete attenuation of OSCC malignant traits. Cetuximab
promoted secretion of EGFR-EVs by OSCC cells and failed to inhibit EGF-driven secretion of EGFR-EVs.
Cetuximab was also found to be robustly secreted with the EGFR-EVs by the OSCC cells. Thus, EGF
promotes the level of mesenchymal traits of OSCC cells and secretion of EGFR-EVs, which involve
cetuximab resistance.

1. Introduction
The EGF receptor (EGFR/ErbB1/Her1) is a member of ErbB/EGFR
receptor family and is one of the crucial transforming receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC), including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) [1]. Inci-
dence and progression of HNSCC is correlated with habitual usage
of tobacco, leading to release of nicotine [2]. Nicotine then triggers
secretion of EGF, which binds to EGFR and activates the PI3K-AKT,
RAS-MEK-ERK, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, thus promoting
proliferation and survival of cancer cells [3]. In addition, activating
genetic aberrations such as amplification and mutation of EGFR are
found in approximately 15% of human papillomavirus-negative
[HPV (�)] HNSCC such as OSCC [1].
The molecular targeting drug cetuximab (cmab, Erbitux®) is an
anti-EGFR IgG1 monoclonal antibody effective in the therapy of
HNC locoregionally advanced or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC and
KRAS wild-type, EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer
[4,5]. Cetuximab has 5-fold higher affinity for EGFR compared to
EGF, and thus is able to block EGFR-ligand interaction, inhibit
dimerization of EGFR, and inhibit downstream RAS-MEK-ERK
signaling pathway [6]. However, several resistance mechanisms
to this therapeutic antibody have been found [7].
We recently showed that OSCC cells secrete EGFR-containing
extracellular
vesicles
(EGFR-EVs)
and
this
EGFR-EV-secretory
phenotype was more prominent in lymph-node-metastatic OSCC
cells [8]. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted structures sur-
rounded by lipid bilayer membranes containing a variety of mo-
lecular cargoes [9e13]. According to the secretory mechanism and
vesicle
size,
EVs
are
classified
as
exosomes
(30e200 nm),

 microvesicles (MVs) (100e1000 nm), apoptotic bodies (1000 to
5000 nm), and matrix vesicles (found in extracellular matrices and
carrying abundant minerals) [14e17]. EVs, in particular exosomes
usually contain tetraspanins including CD9 [18]. We recently
showed that OSCC cells secrete EGFR-EVs as well as heat shock
protein-enriched EVs (HSP-EVs) and this EV-secretory phenotype
was more prominent in lymph-node-metastatic OSCC cells [8]. In
addition, EpCAM-EVs were abundantly secreted by highly resistant
prostate cancer cells [19]. Recently, it has become clear that EVs
play a key role in cell-to-cell communication and participate a
range of biological events [20,21]. Particularly, the “seed and soil”
theory has been advocated in the field of cancer EVs [22]. EVs
secreted by cancer cells can educate the local tumor milieu, while
small vesicles such as exosomes can reach to and influence distant
organ milieu via the circulation, indicating a role in influencing the
“soil” component [23] [24]. These significant properties of tumor-
derived EVs prompted us to ask whether EGFR-EVs secreted by
OSCC cells could affect surrounding normal squamous epithelial
cells within the tumor milieu.
The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular
transformation, important in many aspects of cell biology, which
involves a switch from an epithelial to mesenchymal shape [25,26].
Normal epithelial cells are tightly connected to each other through
intercellular adhesion, cell junctions and desmosomes and loss of
these connections is accompanied by altered cellular shapes,
increased motility, and EMT [27]. Pre-cancerous cells often exhibit
EMT, promoting migration and invasion of the cells within the tu-
mor milieu [28]. EMT is a complex process consisting of multiple
sequential steps and pathways [28]. It has been shown that cancer
cells can be reprogrammed to new phenotypes by features in the
tumor milieu, changes including transition between EMT and its
reverse process MET [19,29]. Recent studies have shown that
extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes and microvesicles, can
trigger cell differentiation and transformation through transferring
oncogenic components to recipient cells [30,31].
These studies prompted us to investigate potential roles for anti-
EGFR antibody cetuximab in control of EGF-driven progression of
mesenchymal traits in OSCC cells that secrete EGFR-EVs.
2. Methods
2.1. Cells
The human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line HSC-3 was
obtained from JCRB Cell Bank at National Institutes of Biomedical
Innovation, Health, and Nutrition. The human oral squamous
(epithelial) cell line RT7 was provided by Dr. Nobuyuki Kamata
(Hiroshima University, Japan). HSC-3 cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS for maintenance and in serum-free
DMEM for preparation of EVs. RT7 cells were cultured in KGM-
Gold or KGM-2 supplemented with recombinant human EGF
(0.125 ng/ml), bovine pituitary extract (0.004 ml/ml), recombinant
human insulin (5 mg/ml), hydrocortisone (0.33 mg/ml), epinephrine
(0.39 mg/ml), human holo-transferrin (10 mg/ml), CaCl2 (0.06 mM),
gentamycin and amphotericin B (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland).
2.2. Reagents
Recombinant human EGF (carrier free) (585506, BioLegend, San
Diego, CA). Cetuximab (Erbitux® Injection, MerckSerono, Tokyo,
Japan).
2.3. Preparation and analysis of EVs
EVs were prepared using a polymer-based method with
modifications
[8].
Cells
cultured
were
washed
with
Hanks'
balanced salt solution (HBSS), and then further cultured in serum-
free medium for 2 days. Cell culture supernatant was centrifuged at
2000 � g for 30 min at 4 �C to remove detached cells. The super-
natant was then centrifuged at 10,000 � g for 30 min at 4 �C to
remove cell debris. The concentrate was applied to a polymer
method using Total Exosome Isolation (ThermoFisher Scientific).
The EV fractions were eluted in 100 ml PBS (�). For protein assay,
10 � RIPA buffer containing 10% NP-40, 1% SDS, and 5% deoxy-
cholate in PBS (�) and an EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma) were added to the EV fraction, incubated on ice for 15 min
and applied to micro BCA protein assay system (ThermoFisher
Scientific). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was carried
out as described [8,19] with 20,000 times magnification using an H-
7650 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at
Central Research Laboratory, Okayama University Medical School.
Particle diameter distribution was analyzed using a Zetasizer as
described [8].
2.4. Western blotting analysis
Protein samples from the EV and cellular fractions were pre-
pared as described [8,19]. For analysis of CD9, protein samples were
mixed with an SDS sample buffer without any reducing agent and
boiled. For analysis of cetuximab, both reduced and non-reduced
conditions were tested. Otherwise, protein samples were mixed
with the SDS sample buffer containing b-mercaptoethanol and
then boiled. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE in 4e20%
TGX-GEL (BioRad) and transferred to PVDF membranes by using
semi-dry or tank method. The antibodies used were mouse anti-
CD9 (1:1000, MBL), anti-EGFR (1:1000, abcam), rabbit anti-
vimentin (1:1000, D21H3, CST), rabbit anti-E-cadherin (1:1,000,
24E10, CST), rabbit anti-HSP 90b (1:1000, GeneTex, Irvine, CA),
HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H þ L chain) (1:5,000, MBL)
for detection of cetuximab, and rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:5000,
D16H11, CST).
2.5. Cell morphology analysis
Phase contrast cell images of random three fields were taken
using Olympus CK30 equipped with a Digital Microscope Eyepiece
Model MA88 (Premiere®). Spindle shaped cells were defined as the
cells with more than two-fold length/width ratio as described [32].
2.6. Cancer gene panel analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated from HSC-3 cells using DNeasy Blood
& Tissue kit (Qiagen) and analyzed with TruSight Tumor 15 (Illu-
mina, San Diego, CA).
2.7. Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was calculated using GraphPad Prism
software. Three or more mean values were compared using one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with pair-wise comparisons by
the Tukey's multiple comparison test. Data were expressed as the
mean ± S.D.

 mesenchymal markers such as vimentin [19,26,33]. We assessed
whether EGF could alter progression of EMT in OSCC cells, which
could be reversed by cetuximab. We examined expression of
vimentin, a marker of the mesenchymal transition and E-cadherin,
a marker of epithelial adhesion. EGF stimulation increased levels of
vimentin and reduced the levels of E-cadherin in the OSCC cells
(Fig. 1A). Exposure to cetuximab attenuated the EGF-dependent
vimentin expression although it did not restore the levels of E-
cadherin in the OSCC cells (Fig. 1A). These findings indicated that
the EGF caused the OSCC cells to undergo progression towards EMT,
a change that cetuximab partially attenuated. Coincidently, the EGF
stimulation increased the number of cells with spindle shapes in
the OSCC cells (Fig. 1B and C). Cetuximab partially inhibited such
EGF-driven morphological changes, although this effect was
incomplete (Fig. 1B and C). These finding indicated that cetuximab
attenuated EGF-driven progression of EMT in OSCC cells while
potential cetuximab resistance of OSCC cells was implicated.
3.2. EGF and cetuximab promoted secretion of EGFR-EVs by OSCC
cells
A definition of EVs is that they are particles surrounded by lipid
bilayers, although the sizes of EVs, including exosomes and MVs,
depend on the cell of origin and other contexts [34,35]. We showed
that EVs secreted by OSCC cells contained exosome marker CD9 and
EGFR while the size of the EVs are between 50 and 200 nm, which
could contain exosomes and microvesicles [8]. Hence, we use the
term “EVs” in the present study as well. We examined morphology
and size of the EVs secreted by the OSCC cells treated with or
without EGF. The EVs analyzed under transmission electron mi-
croscopy (TEM) appeared to be surrounded by lipid bilayers and
were sized at approximately 50e200 nm in either EGF-stimulated
or unstimulated conditions (Fig. 2A). Their particle diameter dis-
tribution peaked between 150 and 230 nm in either EGF-treated or
untreated conditions (Fig. 2B).
We next assessed whether secretion levels of EGFR-EVs by the
OSCC cells were altered in response to EGF and/or cetuximab.
Notably, secretion of EGFR-EVs by oral cancer cells was promoted
by the administration of either EGF, cetuximab or their combina-
tion (Fig. 2C). Cetuximab did not inhibit the EGF-driven secretion of
EGFR-EVs but co-stimulated it (Fig. 2C). These finding suggested
that cetuximab first bound with EGFR and cetuximab/EGFR-EVs
were secreted. Simultaneously with such EGF-driven secretion of
EGFR-EVs, cellular EGFR levels were profoundly reduced (Fig. 2C).
Conversely, cetuximab, which competes with EGF, appeared to bind
to and retain cellular EGFR within cells, but also promoted secretion
of EGFR-EVs (Fig. 2C). These findings indicated that EGF and
cetuximab stimulated secretion of EGFR-EVs by OSCC cells.
3.3. The anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab is secreted by OSCC cells
According to these findings, we made a working hypothesis that
the OSCC cells were able to secrete cetuximab within EGFR-EVs, a
property which could void a potential neutralization role of
cetuximab to the EGF-EGFR signaling. We therefore examined
whether cetuximab was secreted with the OSCC-EVs by the OSCC
cells. Cetuximab was detected in the EV fraction that contained CD9
(Fig. 3). The concentration of cetuximab in the EV and cellular
fractions increased with the dose-dependent manner of the
cetuximab added to the OSCC cells (Fig. 3). Coincidently, intracel-
lular CD9 level was increased with cetuximab concentration
dependent manner. These findings indicated that OSCC cells could
secrete EGFR-EVs and cetuximab. Cetuximab-bound EGFR could be
retained in OSCC cells yet simultaneously OSCC cells can secrete
cetuximab/EGFR-EVs.
3.4. Genetic alterations in the OSCC cells
To exclude the possibility that any activating mutations in the
RAS-MEK-ERK signaling pathway participates in EGF-dependent
and/or cetuximab-dependent EGFR-EV secretion by oral cancer
cells, we examined genetic aberrations in the HSC-3 cells by using
cancer gene panel analysis. A nonsense mutation TP53 R306* was
detected with frequency value 0.935 by performing upon full
coding DNA sequencing (CDS) of TP53. However, neither potential
mutations in EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PDGFRA, KIT
nor focal amplification in MET were found in the HSC-3 OSCC cells.
We next confirmed mutations occurred in HSC-3 oral cancer cells
by searching the cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE) [36]. Frame-
shift insertions in PRKDC (encoding DNA-dependent protein ki-
nase), a nonsense mutation in CASP8 (encoding caspase 8),
missense mutations in SMAD4, CLTCL1 (encoding clathrin heavy
chain) and PCDH15 (encoding proto-cadherin) were found in the
HSC-3 cells (Table S1). Thus, although alterations were seen in some
pathways, these findings implied a minimal role for activating
mutation in RTK/RAS/RAF/PI3K signaling pathways and suggested
other genetic aberrations involve the observed transforming vesi-
cles generated by the malignant phenotype of the HSC-3 OSCC cells.
4. Discussion
Stimulation of EGF promoted progression level of mesenchymal
traits in OSCC cells, which were attenuated by cetuximab but not
completely (Fig. 1). We pursued a mechanism underlying such
incomplete attenuation. Cetuximab promoted secretion of EGFR-
EVs by OSCC cells and failed to inhibit EGF-driven secretion of
EGFR-EVs (Fig. 2). It was thus suggested that cetuximab could alter
trafficking of EGFR-EVs toward their secretion. Finally, cetuximab
was found to be secreted with the EGFR-EVs by the OSCC cells
(Fig. 3). Hence, it was suggested that secretion of cetuximab with
EGFR-EVs by OSCC cells is a mechanism underlying cetuximab
resistance of OSCC cells. EGF was shown previously to trigger EGFR

 dimerization and internalization into endosomes. The generation of
EGFR-EVs appears to be an alternative mechanism, involving entry
of lipids into multivesicular bodies (MVBs), fusion of such bodies
with plasma membranes and release of EVs. Furthermore, EGFR-
EVs can be directly processed out from plasma membranes.
Indeed, EGF stimulation triggered loss of cellular EGFR and gain of
EGFR-EVs (Fig. 2C). Thus, the data suggested that EGF triggers
endosome-mediated degradation of EGFR as well as secretion of
EGFR-EVs.
Genetic aberrations in somatic cells underlie tumor incidence
and cancer progression. Amplification and activating mutation in
oncogenes, as well as inactivating mutation and deletion of tumor
suppressor genes, can initiate and promote cancer progression [37].
Genetic aberrations in the EGFR gene, including amplification and
mutation,
are
found
in
approximately
15%
of
human
papillomavirus-negative [HPV (�)] head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma [1]. Overexpression of EGFR was seen in the HSC-3 oral
squamous carcinoma cells as compared to RT7 oral squamous cells
(unpublished data), suggesting that the EGFR gene can be amplified
and thus overexpressed in the HSC-3 cells. Indeed, EGFR-EVs were
abundantly secreted by the HSC-3 OSCC cells and thus effectively
bound to cetuximab. Several mechanisms of drug resistance to
EGFR-targeted therapy have been demonstrated [38]. We classify
these resistance mechanisms as follows: The first resistance class is
the amplification and activation of alternative RTK, e.g. ErbB/EGFR
family, IGF1R, PDGFRb, FGFR, MET, and the EGFR-S492R mutation
that inhibits cetuximab binding [38]. The EGFR gene can be
amplified in the HSC-3 OSCC cells, which overexpressed EGFR,
potentially contributing cetuximab resistance. The second resis-
tance class is through activating mutations in intracellular signaling
proteins such as PIK3CA, RAS family (KRAS-Q61K or NRAS), BRAF-
V600E, MEK (C121S or P124L) [38]. These mutations have been
found in colorectal cancer, lung cancer and melanoma. Among
these, activating mutations in PIK3CA have been often detected in
HNC [1]; however none of these mutations were not found in the
HSC-3 OSCC cells (Table S1). The third resistance class involves
stromal signals, including HGF-high stroma that activates HGF-MET
signaling [38,39]. We have previously shown that HGF-MET
signaling can be driven under HSF1-HSP regulation in breast can-
cer [39]. HGF-high stroma in OSCC cases is under intense investi-
gation. In addition to these recognized mechanisms of drug
resistance, we have shown that highly-resistant cancer stem-like
cells robustly secrete EpCAM-EVs [19]. Here we suggest a fourth
class of the drug resistance involving vesicle-mediated secretion of
the molecularly targeted anti-EGFR antibody which leads to pro-
tection of cancer cells (Fig. 4).
In conclusion therefore, we have demonstrated that OSCC-
derived EVs trigger the secretion of a molecularly targeted anti-
body drug cetuximab, whose secretion could be a novel mechanism
underlying antibody drug resistance in OSCC.

Fig. 4. Summary. EGF stimulation of OSCC cells increased secretion of EGFR-EVs and
level of EMT (left). Cetuximab attenuated EGF-driven progression of EMT but incom-
pletely (right). Coincidently, cetuximab was secreted with EGFR-EVs by OSCC cells,
implicating a mechanism underlying incomplete inhibition of EMT and cetuximab
resistance.
