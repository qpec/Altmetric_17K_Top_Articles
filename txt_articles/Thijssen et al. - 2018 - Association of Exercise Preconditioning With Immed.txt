We will first summarize evidence from population-based stud-

with clinical events. Subsequently, we summarize studies in ani-

Understanding the immediate cardiovascular benefits of exercise
preconditioning will support the development of strategies in the

cept of exercise preconditioning indicates that, after engagement
inregularexercise,cardioprotectionoccurswellbeforeanychanges
in CVD risk factors. This suggests that clinically relevant cardiopro-
tection is present after 1 episode of exercise.
What Is the Evidence for Exercise Preconditioning?
Can the Heart Be Preconditioned?
In 1986, Murry et al14 introduced the concept of ischemic precon-
ditioning, which involves 3 to 4 brief repetitions of ischemia, typi-
IMPORTANCE Exercise reduces the risk of cardiovascular events, including through an
underrecognized, clinically useful form of acute cardioprotection accessible after a single
episode of exercise, which is called cardiovascular preconditioning.
OBSERVATIONS Preclinical evidence shows that 1 to 3 episodes of exercise per week will
provide strong cardioprotection; gradual, modest cardiovascular risk factor modification or
physiological artery remodeling cannot fully explain these benefits. This review highlights
preclinical evidence that acute exercise-induced cardiac preconditioning has the ability to
activate multiple pathways to confer immediate protection against ischemic events, reduce
the severity of potentially lethal ischemic myocardiac injury, and act as a physiological first
line of defense.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Independent of the protective benefits of long-term exercise
training on risk factors and adaptation of the cardiovascular system, cardiovascular
preconditioning may contribute to the immediate cardioprotection of exercise. In practical
terms, this means that 1 episode of exercise can create clinically relevant cardioprotection.

Can Acute Exercise Precondition the Heart?
An acute episode of exercise is characterized by intermittent expo-
sure to local effects (by exercising specific muscle groups) or sys-
tematic effects (by inducing myocardial ischemia). The similarity of
this stimuli with ischemic preconditioning supports the idea that
acuteexerciseisaformofpreconditioningwiththepotentialtome-
diate similar cardioprotective effects.9,19
Another important similarity is that the temporal nature in car-
dioprotection observed in an acute episode of exercise resembles
that of ischemic preconditioning. Classic ischemic preconditioning
shows potent early protection and disappears approximately 2 to
4 hours after the stimulus; it shows a somewhat slighter degree of
late protection, which reappears after approximately 24 hours and
can last for several days.20,21 Exercise also elicits this characteristic
biphasic protection response. A study of rats22 found that 30 min-
utesofrunningevokedanimmediatereductionininfarctsize,which
wassubsequentlylostbutthenreappeared36to60hoursafterex-
ercise. Others have also reported the characteristic biphasic re-
sponsetoacuteexercise,withprotectionevidentinthesecondphase
for up to 9 days after a single episode of exercise.23 Accordingly, it
is tempting to speculate that acute exercise can precondition the
heart.
Does Exercise Acutely Attenuate Cardiac Ischemia
in Humans?
The ability of exercise to precondition the heart was first sug-
gestedmorethan200yearsagowhenitwasobservedthatexercise-
induced ischemia (eg, clinical symptoms such as angina) was sig-
nificantly reduced or even abolished on a second exercise effort.24
Several subsequent studies25 have confirmed observations of so-
called warm-up angina. In addition to clinical symptoms, exercise-
induced ischemia can also be quantified by electrocardiographic
measurement of ST-segment depression. A meta-analysis of 34
studies25reportedasignificantlylateronsetofST-segmentdepres-
sion (91 seconds) and a decrease in peak ST-segment depression

 ing of 1053 patients with angina. This supports the idea that exer-
cisecaninduceimmediateattenuationofcardiacischemia.Preclini-
cal evidence has found that warm-up angina requires a preceding
periodofischemia,26whichinturnactivatespathwaysthatprotect
the myocardium against ischemia.24 Moreover, similar to classic is-
chemic preconditioning, warm-up angina shows biphasic protec-
tion.ThereductionsinST-segmentdepressionandanginaonsetdur-
ingthesecondepisodeofexercisewereevidentforthefirst6hours
and subsequently returned 24 hours after the exercise ended.27,28
This suggests that exercise attenuates cardiac ischemia in patients
with angina during the second episode of exercise, which seems at
least partly the result of exercise preconditioning.
Emergingevidencesuggeststhatexercisepreconditioningisnot
only present in those with angina. Using a rat model, Yamashita
et al22 was one of the first to examine if an acute episode of exer-
cisecanreduceischemicmyocardialinjuryinindividualswithoutan-
gina. A single episode of exercise prior to ischemic myocardial in-
jury reduced damage to the heart in a biphasic manner, involving
earlyandlateprotection.Inafollow-upstudy,29theyconfirmedthat
exercise protects the myocardium from ischemia-reperfusion in-
jury for 24 hours after cessation of the episode of exercise. In a se-
ries of studies, Domenech et al30 explored if intermittent exercise
resulted in early and late cardiac preconditioning. They found that
exercise prior to coronary occlusion induces early and late precon-
ditioning,leadingtoreductionsininfarctsizeof46%to52%30,31and
56% to 78%,30-32 respectively.
The underlying mechanisms of exercise preconditioning were
examined in a novel human-to-animal crossover study. Michelsen
et al33 examined healthy individuals who underwent exercise (4 in-
termittentepisodesofrunningin2-minutebursts)andischemicpre-
conditioning (4 repetitions of arterial occlusion of 5 minutes each,
using blood pressure cuffs). Blood was taken from human partici-
pantsafterpreconditioningandusedasadialysatetoperfusearab-
bit heart in a Langendorff model of myocardial infarction. This was
followed by a 40-minute occlusion of a coronary artery in the rab-
bitheartandassessmentoftheinfarctsizerelativetotheareaatrisk.
Exercise and ischemic preconditioning both reduced infarct size by
approximately 50%. To understand the underlying mechanisms,
analyses were repeated with coadministration of an opioid recep-
torantagonisttotheLangendorffmodelheart,whichabrogatedthe

Does Acute Exercise Reduce Infarct Size in Humans?

lower in-hospital mortality and more nonfatal (as opposed to fatal)
cardiac events. Similarly, engaging in physical activity in the week
prior to coronary artery bypass grafting was linked to higher rates
ofsurvival.37Finally,repetitiveexercisewithbriefrestperiodsinpa-

 effects of physical activity patterns in the experimental setting and
thoseofphysicalactivityinthedaysprecedingtheexperiment.Un-
tilclinicalstudiesinhumansareperformedwithdistinctphysicalac-
tivitypatternsbeforeischemicinjury,itwillremaindifficulttoclearly
answer this question.
Can Acute Exercise Precondition the Cardiovascular System?
Can Exercise Training Precondition Arteries?
The first study to describe the cardioprotective effects of exercise
preconditioning in rats39 was published in 1978 and demonstrated
that 5 weeks of swimming exercise resulted in a smaller myocardial
infarct size. Several subsequent studies in animals have supported
these original findings.12,40-45 These studies adopted 2 to 12 weeks
of regular, frequent exercise (5-7 d/wk), involved running or swim-
ming,andconsistentlyreportedsignificantlysmallerinfarctsizesthan
inthesedentarycontrols.Theattenuatedmyocardialinjury,atleast
in part, is related to an accelerated recovery of myocardial tissue
oxygenation40 and/or improved myocardial contractile perfor-
mance during reperfusion.46 Interestingly, the cardioprotective ef-
fects were preserved for 1 week after cessation of the 4-week exer-
ciseprogram,47supportingthesustainabilityofthesebenefits.This
study47alsorevealedthatnitricoxidemetabolitescontributetothe
sustained cardioprotective effects. More specifically, exercise up-
regulated cardiac endothelial nitric oxide synthase, resulting in in-
creased storage of the nitric oxide metabolites nitrite and nitroso-
thiols, which might contribute to an increase in nitric oxide
bioavailability during myocardial injury.
Limitations of Existing Evidence
Animportantlimitationofanimalstudiesthatexamineexercisepre-
conditioningisthatmoststudiesonlypresentinfarctsize.However,
severalinvestigatorshavealsoexploredfunctionalconsequences.For
example, 1 study48 performed surgical ligation of the left coronary
artery in rats after 7 weeks of swimming exercise. After allowing an-
other4weeksofrecovery,exercise-trainedratsdemonstratedsmaller
scar size and higher arteriole density on postmortem tissue exami-
nation than untrained rats; the changes were associated with im-
proved cardiac function on in vivo echocardiography.48 The ability
of exercise training to prevent postinfarct cardiac dysfunction was
supportedbyothers,12whilethesebenefitsfurthertranslatedtoim-
proved survival.12 Interestingly, improved survival was not present
in mice trained after myocardial injury.12 This suggests that prior ex-
ercise can improve cardiac function and survival after ischemic car-
diac injury.
Another important limitation to animal studies is the difficulty
of extrapolating the data to humans with CVD. In addition, care is
also required when extrapolating from 1 part of the human body to
another.Amodelfrequentlyusedtostudyischemia-reperfusionin-
jury in humans involves applying prolonged ischemia to the fore-
armthrough15to20minutesofcuffinflationaroundtheupperarm,
followed by 15 to 20 minutes of reperfusion. This leads to a de-
crease in brachial artery endothelial function, which is prevented
when preceded by ischemic preconditioning.49 Although the fore-
arm vascular response shows good correlation with coronary vas-
cular responses,50 care is warranted to extrapolate these findings
to cardiac tissue. Using this model, Seeger et al51 explored the abil-
ity of exercise, similar to limb-ischemic preconditioning, to prevent
endothelial ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo. A single episode of
interval exercise, but not an isocaloric endurance exercise, induced
protectionagainstendothelialischemia-reperfusioninjury.Whilethis
observationindicatesthepotencyofexercisepreconditioning,italso
raises questions regarding the stimuli mediating these responses.
Apotentialexplanationisthatenduranceexercisewasunabletoin-
duce local ischemia, while interval exercise evidently could induce
it.51 Nevertheless, Brunt et al52 reported in 2016 that a single expo-
sure to warm water immersion, a stimulus not associated with is-
chemia, prevented endothelial ischemia-reperfusion injury. This
suggests that the potential mechanisms underlying exercise pre-
conditioning might not simply relate to ischemia alone.
Apreviouscross-sectionalstudy53inhumansfoundthatthemag-
nitudeofbrachialarteryendothelialischemia-reperfusioninjurywas
lowerinthoseengagedinhabitualresistanceexercise.Inafollow-up
study,54 the same researchers compared endothelial ischemia-
reperfusioninjurybetweenyoungandmiddle-agedendurance-trained
individualsvssedentaryindividuals.Theyreportedthatmiddle-aged
individualshadgreaterendothelialischemia-reperfusioninjury,while
habitualenduranceexercisepartlyprotectedagainsttheseage-related
effects.In2017,Maessenetal55providedfurtherevidencethatlong-
termexercisetrainingcanpreventischemia-reperfusioninjury.They
found that lifelong athletes had reduced endothelial ischemia-
reperfusioninjuryandpreservedlocalpreconditioningefficacy,com-
paredwiththeirsedentarypeers.Thiswouldsuggestthat,inlinewith
animalstudies,exercisetrainingreducesischemia-reperfusioninjury
inhumansandthat,accordingly,exercisemayserveasaprecondition-
ing stimulus. Future studies are needed to better understand the ef-
fectsofexercisepreconditioninginhumans,preferablydirectlyexam-
ining cardiac and coronary artery responses.
What Is the Time Course of Training-Induced Myocardial
Preconditioning?
Experimental studies in animals have demonstrated the remark-
able potency of exercise preconditioning to mediate rapid cardio-
protection. In addition to the immediate cardioprotection after a
singleepisodeofexercise,5to7daysofexercisetrainingalsoevoke
strong cardioprotective effects, demonstrated by a significantly
smaller infarct size56,57 and better postischemic recovery (ie, myo-
cardial contractile performance).10 Also, 3 days of exercise for 60
minutesperdayissufficienttoinducecardioprotectiveeffects,evi-
denced by smaller infarct size58,59 and better postinjury
recovery.10,11,60Giventheseeffectsofshort-termtraining,onemight
question whether the duration of training affects the ability to re-
duce infarct size. To examine this question, Sun and Pan42 com-
paredeffectsof3-dayvs3-weekintermittentrunningexerciseinrats.
Using isoproterenol-induced cardiac injury, they observed no dif-
ferencesinmyocardialdamagebetweenthe3-dayor3-weektrain-
ing groups. These data42 further support the concept that exercise
training-inducedpreconditioningoccursimmediatelyandthatben-
efitsareindependentofthedurationoftraining.Becausethesestud-
ies showed no structural adaptation, this further supports exercise
preconditioning as an explanation for immediate cardioprotection
on short-term exercise.
Is Cardioprotection From Exercise Training Summative
or Related to the Last Episode of Exercise?

ter a single episode of exercise raises the question of whether the

 cardioprotective effects of repeated exercise preconditioning are
summative,oriftheysimplyrelatetothebenefitsgeneratedbythe
lastepisode(s)ofexercise.Whenexploringthesustainabilityofthese
effects, exercise training in animals for 5-day or 4-week spans pre-
served cardioprotection up to 7 to 9 days after the last episode of
exercise.23,47 This is longer than was reported in a previous study
thatexploredthetimecourseoftheinfarct-sparingeffectsofasingle
episode of exercise, which was present up to 60 hours
postexercise.61 While the duration of protection is somewhat un-
clear,thesestudiessuggestthatthecardioprotectiveeffectofasingle
episode of exercise might be prolonged when followed by re-
peated exercise training.
Tomoredirectlyexaminethistopic,1study62foundthat2weeks
of running exercise in mice was associated with increased myocar-
dial tolerance against ischemia-reperfusion injury. Although these
effectswerelostafter1weekofinactivity,1to3daysofexercisefully
restored the cardioprotective effects. The comparable effects of 2
weeks of training vs 1 to 3 episodes of exercise were paralleled by
changesinglycogensynthasekinase-3βandepidermalgrowthfac-
tor receptor, proteins related to injury and survival, respectively.62
However, other proteins related to survival were up-regulated af-
ter 2 weeks of training (ie, AKT, adenosine monophosphate-
activated protein kinase, heat shock protein 27) but remained un-
altered on 1 to 3 episodes of exercise.62 Another study61 explored
the time course of a single and 2 subsequent episodes of exercise.
The single episode of exercise showed the typical biphasic pattern
of cardioprotection, whereas 2 episodes of exercise (separated by
48hours)resultedinprotectionthatwasconsistentlypresentacross
the 60-hour period. This suggests that subsequent episodes of ex-
ercise, with the second episode timed during late preconditioning,
provide continuous protection against myocardial ischemia-
induced injury. Possibly, long-term benefits of exercise precondi-
tioning might at least partly relate to the continuous activation of
late preconditioning (Figure 2).
Moderating Factors of Exercise Preconditioning
Do Risk Factors for CVD Impair Exercise Preconditioning?
Studies suggest that efficacy of classic preconditioning is attenu-
ated in the presence of risk factors for CVD.63 Studies have
assessed if exercise training restores the attenuated efficacy of
classic preconditioning associated with obesity. Regular exercise
training in obese rats64 or obese mice65 can partly restore the
attenuated efficacy of preconditioning in experimental myocardial
infarction. These effects of exercise were related to the
up-regulation of prosurvival signaling pathways, increase in kinase
phosphorylation, decreased levels of phosphates, and increased
resistance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore
opening.64-66 Because no effect of 4-week exercise training was
found on glucose level, cholesterol level, insulin level, fat mass, or
body mass,66 the restoration of preconditioning occurs indepen-
dent of changes in traditional CVD risk factors. Although more
work is required, these preliminary studies highlight the ability of
exercise training (in obese animals) to restore attenuated cardio-
protection afforded by classic ischemic preconditioning.
Older age is another risk factor that is strongly associated with
impaired ability of classic preconditioning to prevent ischemia-
reperfusion injury.67 Emerging evidence suggests that these ef-
fects of older age are partly reversible through exercise training.
Abete et al68 found that in trained older rats, but not in sedentary
older rats, local preconditioning reduced postischemic myocardial
injury. This study also revealed an important role for exercise-
induced release of norepinephrine because these effects of train-
ing were abolished when exercise-induced release of norepineph-
rinewasblocked.68Follow-upstudiesprovidedfurtherevidencethat
exercise training in older rats can restore the ability to reduce car-
diac injury using preconditioning.69,70 These findings are in agree-
ment with 2017 cross-sectional findings in humans, where lifelong
older athletes showed preserved ability of preconditioning to pre-
vent endothelial ischemia-reperfusion injury.55 This indicates that
theage-relatedimpairedpreconditioningisatleastpartlyrelatedto
physical inactivity and, importantly, can be restored by training.
Which Exercise Factors Mediate Exercise Preconditioning?
Various factors might mediate exercise preconditioning. Of these,
variationsinexercise-inducedischemia,exercisequalityortype,and
exercise intensity require further exploration.
Based on our understanding of classic preconditioning, ische-
mia may be obligatory for exercise preconditioning. Nevertheless,
studiesdirectlyexaminingthishypothesisprovidelittlesupportfor
this idea. First, repeated exposure to tachycardia, in the absence of
ischemia, reduced myocardial infarct size in a canine model.71 Sec-
ond,exerciseisassociatedwiththereleaseofseveralhormones,in-
cludingwell-knownfactorsthattriggerischemicpreconditioning(eg,
adenosine, bradykinin, and opioids). Although these hormones are
released in a dose-dependent manner, an episode of moderate-
intensity exercise (ie, below the lactate threshold) already releases
thesehormones.Finally,moderate-intensityexercisehasshownto
evoke infarct-sparing effects.72,73 These data suggest that pres-
ence of ischemia during exercise is not obligatory for cardioprotec-
tion via exercise preconditioning.
Toourknowledge,nopreviousstudieshavecomparedtheeffect
ofdifferentmodesofexercise(eg,swimmingandrunning),whilesome
exploredtheimportanceofperformingmoderate-intensityendurance
vshigh-intensityintervalexercise.Astudyperformedinrats74found
that6weeksofhigh-intensitysprintintervaltraining,butnotendur-
ancetraining,wereassociatedwithimprovedtolerancetomyocardial
ischemia-reperfusion.Nevertheless,therelativelylowintensityofthe
endurance exercise might have confounded these effects. In a 2015
studyinhumans,51theeffectofacuteexercisetoprotectagainsten-
dothelial ischemia-reperfusion injury was compared between high-
intensityintervalexerciseand(isocaloric)moderate-intensityendur-
anceexercise.Inlinewithobservationsinanimals,intervalexercise,but
notenduranceexercise,preventedendothelialischemia-reperfusion
injury of the brachial artery. These results suggest that interval exer-
cise might yield larger benefits than endurance exercise. However,
follow-upstudies,includinginterventionstudiesthatincludebothtypes
ofexerciseforprolongedperiodsinhumans,arerequiredtobetterun-
derstand these effects.
To our knowledge, only 2 studies have directly compared the
effects of different exercise intensities to precondition the heart.

These studies suggest that the intensity of exercise does not alter

other factors, such as the time course of adaptation, may have in-

Future Perspective
Exercisepreconditioningrepresentsanattractiveexplanationforthe
immediatecardioprotectiveeffectsevokedbyexercise,whichmay
be present after a single episode or a few episodes of exercise. The
conceptofexercisepreconditioningisunderrecognized,evenwhile
emerging evidence supports its presence in the heart and other or-
gans. For example, a 2014 meta-analysis75 including studies per-
formed in animals that underwent cerebral ischemic injury re-
vealed that exercise was associated with a 25% smaller cerebral
infarctsizeand38%betterneurobehavioralscore.Thisfurthersup-
ports the validity and clinical relevance of exercise preconditioning
to explain the immediate protective benefits of exercise training.
An important area of future research relates to translating this
knowledge to clinical scenarios. First, knowledge on exercise pre-
conditioning will contribute to the evidence-based prescription of
exercise(eg,clinicalguidelinesandcost-effectivenessplanning),and
it will also contribute to health promotion to patients. Second, this
knowledge will alter expectations from both patients and clini-
cians, in that strong and sustainable cardioprotective effects are
present after episodes of exercise, even in the absence of changes
in CVD risk factors. This will help to motivate patients to start and
continue exercise training and will provide impetus for clinicians to
recommendexerciseasafirst-lineandlifelongtreatment.Finally,the
immediatebenefitsofpreconditioningachievedthroughafewses-
sions of exercise can initiate novel training strategies. For example,
exercise in the days preceding planned cardiac interventions (“pre-
habilitation”) may reduce in-hospital mortality and morbidity.

tion may be found. Exercise induces a cardioprotective precondi-
tioning stimulus with early protection of the cardiovascular system
for 2 to 3 hours and a more robust and longer period of protection
that emerges after 24 hours and remains for several days. Impor-
tantly, these associations are present on the first episode of exer-
cise,withsubsequentexercisesessionsreactivatingprotectivepath-
ways and leading to ongoing beneficial effects with myocardial
ischemia. In practical terms, this suggests that cardioprotection in
individuals who start exercising begins after the first training epi-
sode.Althoughmoderatingfactors(eg,obesityandage)impairthe

so often the case with the benefits of exercise, its prescription fol-
lows the cardinal rule: use it or lose it.
