Coping Styles of Men With Rheumatoid Arthritis

Objective. To explore the experiences, coping styles, and support preferences of male rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
Methods. Six focus groups comprised 22 men with RA. Transcripts were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.
Results. Three overarching themes describe the experiences, coping styles, and support preferences of men with RA. In
“challenges to masculinity,” the men described a “reduction in strength and abilities,” which can lead to loss of independence,
“challenges to masculine identity and role,” and “loss of power and control.” Coping by “getting through life with RA” meant
dealing with RA by “just getting on with it,” “information seeking,” engaging in “destructive behaviors,” and “withdrawing
socially.” Preferred “sources of support” tended not to include friends, as they were perceived to lack understanding or sup-
port. For acceptable support the men reported a preference for information-giving sessions rather than a discussion group,
but there was no agreement on whether these should be mixed-sex or men only, or who should run the sessions.
Conclusion. Male patients reported a range of coping styles and support preferences to address their experiences of living
with RA, many of which may not be shared with women. Further research is needed to investigate whether these findings
exist in a larger sample and whether the support preferences of men with RA are broadly different from those of women
with RA to decide whether there is a clinical need to design a service for the potentially different needs of men.
INTRODUCTION
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive, and sys-
temic autoimmune disease, characterized by fluctuating
symptoms such as pain and fatigue with associated emo-
tional, social, financial, and societal burden (1,2). RA affects
more women than men, with approximately 30% of the RA
population being male (3,4), and RA may take a different
course in women compared to men (5,6).
Evidence from several diseases indicates that long-term
conditions impact differently on men compared to women
(7,8), suggesting that men need their own health strategy (9).
However, there is a dearth of literature exploring the impact
of RA on men and their self-management strategies. A com-
prehensive literature review (10) found no consensus on
whether sex affects ability to cope with RA. However,
findings did suggest that men use fewer and less diverse cop-
ing strategies than women (11,12). If men do cope differently
than women, it is likely they would have different support
needs to suit these different coping styles. It is therefore of
note that current self-management interventions in RA have
been designed and tested mainly in women, with random-
ized controlled trials of RA self-management interventions
reflecting the preponderance of women with the condition
(13–16).
Despite these indications that men may experience and
deal with RA differently than women, only 2 studies (both
qualitative) have focused solely on men with RA. One (17)
recruited patients from only 1 UK hospital and did not
explore coping strategies. The other (18) was conducted
with US war veterans, who may have very different expe-
riences of life and therefore have developed different

 coping strategies than the general male population. Nei-
ther of these studies explored the support preferences of
men.
While research in other conditions suggests that men
need their own health strategy, this has not been suffi-
ciently investigated in RA. As a first step it is necessary to
qualitatively explore and understand in greater depth how
men experience and cope with their RA and to decide
whether this is an issue worthy of further investigation in
a larger sample of patients. Therefore, the current study
aimed to explore the experiences of male RA patients and
the impact RA has on their lives, how they are currently
coping with and managing their RA, and whether they
would like a support intervention, and if so, then their
preferred delivery style and broad content.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients and focus groups. Male patients with clinician-
diagnosed RA (19–21) were invited to participate in focus
groups by the researcher (CAF) or local research nurse.
Every man attending a rheumatology outpatient appoint-
ment at 1 of 3 UK hospitals on the days of recruitment was
invited to take part.
A topic guide (Table 1) was developed based on a literature
review and discussions with the study team, including a
male patient research partner (RN), and was used to facilitate
discussion in the focus groups. These followed an iterative
process (22), with new concepts emerging during data analy-
sis being explored in subsequent focus groups. A prestudy
questionnaire captured demographic data and disability
(Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]) (23) (Table 2).
The focus groups were conducted by the first author (CAF)
with a subset cofacilitated by a patient research partner (RN).
As both a man and a person with RA (the lead researcher is
neither), the patient research partner brought a different per-
spective and insight to the focus groups to inform followup
questions (24). The focus groups lasted approximately 2
hours, were digitally recorded, and transcribed verbatim.
Ethics
approval
was
granted
by
the
London-Bromley
Research Ethics Committee (reference 13/LO/0852) and writ-
ten informed consent was obtained from each participant
before each focus group.
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using inductive
thematic analysis, a method for identifying, analyzing, and
reporting patterns (themes) within data without trying to fit it
into a preexisting coding frame, or the researcher’s pre-
conceptions (25). Data were analyzed according to Braun and
Clarke’s guidelines (25) and managed using NVivo 8 (26).
The first author (CAF) analyzed all the transcripts, and a sam-
ple was independently analyzed (27,28) by 3 researchers
(SH, KR, and AW) and a patient research partner (RN). Team
discussions and comparison showed that they reached com-
parable conclusions to the first author (CAF).
RESULTS
Twenty-two men with RA participated in the study with a
median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 64 years (60–70.5
years), range 44–75 years, which is slightly older than the
RA population (29). Median (IQR) disease duration was 9.5
years (5–12 years), range 2 months to 19 years; HAQ score
was 1.25 (0.69–1.90), range 0–2.375 (Table 2); and all

Significance & Innovations
� Men with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) report a
challenge to their masculine identity due to the
impact of RA. They therefore employ strategies
to hide their RA in public in order to maintain
their masculine image.
� Some men use destructive behaviors to cope
with their RA, potentially causing more pain
and joint damage.
� Many men reported not talking to their friends
about their RA due to a perceived lack of under-
standing and support.
� Men with RA report being reluctant to discuss
emotional issues with their rheumatology team
unless explicitly asked with a direct question.
Experiences and Coping Styles of Men With RA
331
 participants were white and British. Six focus groups (A–F)
were conducted. Small focus groups of 4 to 6 participants
were planned to allow the men to feel comfortable dis-
cussing thoughts and feelings openly (30). However, due to
nonattendance
some
focus
groups
were
smaller
than
planned (2 to 5 participants in each). Thematic analysis
identified 3 overarching but interconnected themes relating
to the way men experience and manage their RA, and the
support they require (Figure 1).
Challenges to masculinity: “it’s not a very macho
thing.” Participants described the various challenges to
masculinity they experience due to their RA and how they
dealt with this.
Reduction in strength and abilities. A reduction in
strength and the ability to do things previously taken for
granted was raised as an important issue. For some this
reduction in strength alters their ability to do their job as
they used to: “Some of these radiators I have to lift up are so
heavy. Years ago I’d just sling them on my shoulder and
walk about. Not anymore” (Mark). Participants explained
that this reduction in strength and ability leads to the need
to ask for help, which some men view as a challenge to their
masculinity: “It puts you in a position where you have to
ask for help and it’s not a very sort of macho thing” (Will).
This is particularly apparent when they need to ask for help
with physical tasks from their wives or partners, causing
them to challenge their assumption that men are physically
stronger than women: “It is horrible, you’ve got to say to
your wife, ‘I can’t undo this bottle,’ and she just goes like
that and it’s undone” (Alan). Some participants explained
that it is more acceptable to pay a tradesman to do a job they
need help with rather than accept a favor: “I find it easier to
get a stranger in than a friend of the family, a lot easier, per-
sonally. I’ve got a grandson, he’s a carpenter, anything we
need to do he’ll come and do. Then you’ll have an argument
with him because he won’t take any money and I find that
embarrassing. So I don’t ask him anymore” (Frank).
Reduction in abilities also leads to a loss of indepen-
dence, and the emotional and physical impact of this reso-
nated with all participants: “One of the worst things you
can do, when you’ve got it bad, is get down on your knees.
Cause you can’t get up. . .it’s so soul destroying because
what it does, it takes away your. . .” (James). “. . .Yeah,
your dignity” (Robert). Some participants discussed the
loss of financial independence due to a reduction in work:
“Generally, financially and all that sort of thing, you lose
your independence and that’s what I found now I’ve
stopped, earning extra money” (Edward).
Challenges to masculine identity and role. The impact
of RA on valued roles and self-image can challenge mascu-
line identity. These men’s altered self-image seems to con-
flict with their idea of themselves as a healthy man: “When I
first got it. ..it was quite a shock...I thought initially, why

 me? Because I’ve always been active” (Charles). To protect
their masculine identity in public these participants often
made attempts to conceal their RA: “You go to shake their
hands, and I don’t know what it is about certain guys but
they’ve really got to grip you, and you obviously just have to
put on a brave face, because it really hurts” (Mark). The dom-
inant discourse in these discussions was around gendered
roles, and the loss of ability to carry out the “man’s tasks”
within the home was felt by many of the participants: “As a
man you should be the main person doing the lawns, the
gardens, round the house” (Richard). Another important
part of masculine identity is the man’s role as the breadwin-
ner, and work was therefore raised as an important issue:
“When we were kids we were brought up that a fella goes to
work, a wife stays at home” (Mike). “I couldn’t do my job
anymore so they laid me off like, made me redundant and
that hurt” (Frank). Some men also felt their role in the family
was compromised: “I used to play fight with him [son] and
everything, pick him up and chuck him up the garden and
stuff like that and I just can’t anymore.. .Sons look at dads as
being just like, ‘Dad, you’re invincible,’ and then all of sud-
den you can’t do it” (Steve).
Loss of power and control. Underlying the challenges to
strength, ability, independence, and identity is the loss of
power and control, which can lead to feelings of helplessness.
This lack of control due to a body that no longer behaves as
expected or desired can extend to other areas of life, causing
anger and frustration: “Well I can’t pick that box up guvnor.”
“Well, you ain’t working for me,” sort of thing, you know
what I mean” (Paul). “That makes you angry” (Tom). “Yeah,
angry ain’t the word for it” (Paul).
A further loss of power and control for some participants
was through power imbalance during interactions with health
care professionals. This was particularly felt when they did
not feel believed or treated with care, which could leave them
feeling helpless: “They know that men don’t go [to the doctor]
unless they’ve really got to, and even then they’ll still fob you
off” (Robert). “I had a similar problem... I was leaning against
the x-ray plate, and this nurse...” (Richard). “Tried to yank
your arm behind your back” (John). “...just dragged my arms
back and pulled...It was so painful” (Richard).
The men appreciated efforts by health care profession-
als to reduce this power imbalance, and seemed to value
the approach of a clinician that reinforced their masculine
status: “He’s [rheumatologist] really down at your level
isn’t he, he’s a man’s man. . .he’s just a bloke” (Ron).
Getting through life with RA: “Just get on with
it.” Participants found different ways of dealing with their
RA, which could be both proactive and passive.
Just get on with it. Participants discussed the need to
just get on with things rather than complaining about their
RA: “I just accept it and get on with it, what else do you
do?” (Ian). “Yeah, exactly. My last visit to the rheumatolo-
gist, his actual words to me were I’m too stoic” (Henry).
They discussed practical self-management strategies such
as pacing and planning, and acknowledged the importance
of keeping active: “You just pace yourself” (Robert). “Pace
yourself and have a little rest between things” (James).
Participants also discussed using tools to help them
manage. The tools that were talked about were often those
used to make masculine tasks (such as do-it-yourself) eas-
ier rather than for disability, such as walking aids: “You
get a little electric thingy for screws [electric screwdriver]”
(Robert). Some men explained that they make their own
devices or disability aids to help with their RA: “It helps if

arthritis (RA).
Experiences and Coping Styles of Men With RA

 you are a bit that way, that you can make things to help
yourself” (David). “I’ve actually made the sofa about that
much higher, put extra legs on it” (Robert).
Information-seeking. In an attempt to retain control of
their RA, these male patients sought information to keep
themselves informed. This came from many sources,
including journals, newspapers. and the internet: “I saw
that in The Mail” (Tom). “This was in the Lancet”
(George). They valued medical intervention, and the dis-
course in the focus groups often centered around medica-
tion, with all the men knowing their medication regimen
in detail: “What dose of methotrexate are you on?” (Rich-
ard). “15 mg subcut, that’s injected” (Will). They also val-
ued regular monitoring by their medical team, which
provided current information about their condition: “I go
for monthly checks, so you know you’re being monitored,
you can’t ask for more than that” (George).
Destructive behaviors. In an attempt to get on with their
lives despite their RA, some men discussed pushing them-
selves to their limits, while disregarding any consequences:
“I will work all day and then wonder the next day why I
can’t use my hands.. .and my knees have had it” (Edward).
“...I feel you’ve got to finish the task” (Ron). Some men
reported using exercise as a way to vent frustration and
anger. This was sometimes at the expense of putting strain
on the body and joints: “I use [running] as a way of getting
rid of the frustration and the anger; I just run and run and
run until I can’t run anymore. ..I just feel like just punishing
myself. I know I shouldn’t because I know I’m going to pay
for it in the long run” (Steve). Risk-taking behaviors were
also discussed, such as skipping medication to accommo-
date their social life and drinking more alcohol than recom-
mended with their medication: “If I’m going out, like the
weekend, I don’t take one methotrexate that week. I know
slap on the wrist there” (Steve). “[Rheumatologist] said you
can drink, as long as it’s within moderation.. .well, I’m going
on holiday in 6 weeks’ time. I mean, what do you go on holi-
day for? To get drunk and fall down” (Will).
Social withdrawal. Some men reported dealing with the
emotional aspects of their RA by avoiding people: “I live on
my own. . .so I can rattle around, chuck stuff and just be
thoroughly frustrated and just lay in bed all day” (Steve).
Social involvement could also be withdrawn due to no lon-
ger feeling able to join in with activities. Some men
appeared black and white in their thinking and were there-
fore unable to consider ways to replace lost activities: “I’ve
lost my social life as it is now, because I don’t go out
playing pool, I don’t go out playing golf, which are the two
main things I done” (John). “. . .I gave up going to pubs com-
pletely because I just didn’t feel right going into a pub and
having soft drinks” (Mike).
Sources of support. Many of the men reported receiving
support from wives and partners, and some were supported
by other family members such as adult children: “Luckily
I’ve got a very understanding wife” (Frank). “I talk to my
daughter sometimes about it. ..she seems more understand-
ing than anyone else” (Alan). While some participants felt
able to talk to health care professionals about the emotional
impact of RA, others found this difficult: “I’ve always been
able to speak to [nurse] about” (Alan). “I wouldn’t want to
discuss it with [rheumatologist], not interested, no” (Paul).
Some men indicated they would need to be explicitly asked
about emotional impact to enable them to discuss it: “No they
didn’t [discuss support options], on the other hand I didn’t
tell them I was depressed either. ..I went and seen [rheuma-
tologist], we talked and we came out” (Frank). “I think when
you’re in the state you’re in with this and you know, it
depends on the questions what’s being asked” (George).
However, the rheumatology team may not always explic-
itly ask about emotional well-being, and less direct ques-
tions are not interpreted by the men to include emotional
impact: “They ask how I’ve been and how I am being, I tend
to take that from an RA perspective rather than an overall
perspective. . .they never split the question” (Richard).
The majority of participants reported that their friends
are not understanding and they would be unlikely to dis-
cuss their RA with them: “I go [clay] shooting. . .if I com-
plain just for a minute. . .they’ll say ‘stop bloody moaning.’
That’s all you get” (James). “No, they’re not understanding
at all, no, not unless they’ve got something wrong with
them” (Mark). “That’s why we all keep schtum” (Paul).
What type of support is acceptable? “We’d end up just
moaning.” Styles of acceptable support packages. Many
participants agreed that a group session would be useful, but
it was important that the group had a purpose. They empha-
sized their lack of interest in a discussion about their condi-
tion, as this was seen as unhelpful and something women
do: “Just speaking to other people with the same complaint, I
can’t see what good that would do. Cause all we’d end up is
just moaning at one another” (Frank). “Like a gaggle of
women and they’re cracking their jaws and...sometimes
they talk a lot and say nothing” (Fred).
Despite these views, many participants seemed to value
the opportunity to talk to other men with RA in the
research focus groups: “They [other people] just don’t
understand at all how it gets you, whereas you can recog-
nize everything that everybody [in the focus group] is say-
ing because you’ve been through it” (George). “I’ve never
done it [talked to other men with RA] before” (David).
However, when asked if they would come to a similar
group as a support service, the majority emphasized that
they had attended for the purpose of research and not to
help themselves: “I don’t know what I’d say [in a support
group]. I’m here to help you [researcher]” (Frank).
Ideas for group sessions were information giving, or a
question and answer session: “Something coming the
other way in relation to what research has been done and
what the findings are” (George). “Say for instance, every
two months, a consultant is in a room and maybe there’s
twenty people could all discuss what’s going on” (John).
Who should attend and run a support package? The
men had different views on whether the group should be
mixed or single sex. Some preferred an all-male group due to
potential difficulties opening up with women present, while
others were interested in hearing women’s views: “I went to
one [support group] and it was a mixed group, and I didn’t
say anything, sat there and didn’t say anything...There were
quite a few women there, they were talking and I thought I
don’t want any of this” (Frank). “I’d like to hear how
334
Flurey et al
 [women] cope with it and how theirs differs and how they
feel compared to how we feel” (Steve).
In terms of who should run the group, some patients val-
ued the knowledge of medical professionals, while others
would prefer an expert patient helping to run the group:
“Medical people I would say because they could answer
questions if you have them” (Mark). “Staff led but patient
run.. .the staff should sort of stand back, or be there for refer-
ence, and let the patients get on with talking, because they
are the ones who are actually experiencing it” (Will).
DISCUSSION
These male RA patients reported the impact of RA on their
life through reduction in strength and ability, challenges to
masculine identity and role, and loss of power and control.
They dealt with these issues by just getting on with things,
information seeking, concealing their RA in public, engaging
in destructive behaviors, and withdrawing socially. The
majority of participants would not discuss their RA with
friends due to a perceived lack of understanding or support.
Acceptable support was suggested as an information-giving
session rather than a group discussion. This raises the ques-
tion as to whether these issues are pertinent to all (or most)
men with RA and whether they are more common in men
than women with RA, as this would have important impli-
cations for the design of support services.
Loss of independence and increased need to ask for
help has been identified in previous qualitative studies
with predominantly female patients (31). However, partic-
ipants in the current study reported asking for help as a
direct challenge to their masculinity. The need to incorpo-
rate RA into identity has been identified in previous RA
research with both men (17) and women (31). However,
the men in the current study were reluctant to incorporate
RA into their public identity and reported employing
strategies to conceal their RA in public. This may be an
attempt to “pass” as fully and self-evidently masculine for
either a real or imaginary audience (32).
The coping strategies reported by the men in this study to
deal with the physical and emotional impacts of RA support
the idea that men try to behave according to traditional
(American and British) ideals of stoicism and emotional self-
sufficiency (33–35). These male patients reported being will-
ing to talk to their rheumatology team if directly asked about
their emotional well-being, which may be because they value
emotional support, but feel uncomfortable acknowledging
this (36). Thus, rather than asking open-ended questions (e.g.,
“How are you doing?”), clinicians should be encouraged to
explicitly ask men about psychological and emotional issues.
There is also value in taking an indirect approach, such as
talking about “safe issues” like work or family, as opposed to
direct questioning about feelings (37). Patients reported a per-
ceived lack of support from friends, supporting the proposal
that men have poorer social capital than women (38,39).
A comprehensive literature review of the acceptability of
different types of support for men with long-term conditions
(36) found that men need support interventions to have a
purpose, be structured, and provide opportunities to gather
new information (35,40). The men in the present study
report preferring information sessions to group discussions.
This supports the theory that while women prefer face-to-
face conversation, many men find this too personal and
instead benefit from “covert intimacy” (41), which tends to
take the form of shoulder-to-shoulder conversations, while
engaging in shared activities such as the Men’s Sheds project
(42). The men participating in this study emphasized that
they were attending the focus groups to help with the
research project rather than to help themselves. This
supports previous findings that suggest men may be more
likely to attend support services as a volunteer (42).
This study may have limitations because the whole sample
was white and British and the majority were over age 55
years. However, the opinions of relatively younger men from
the age range with RA were captured in this sample, and due
to the nature of qualitative research a separate study would
be necessary to fully capture the potentially different experi-
ences of men with RA from different ethnic backgrounds. It is
possible that this study is missing the voices of men who
were unable to take part in scheduled focus groups (e.g., due
to work commitments), or the “strong, silent” men who may
be reluctant to participate in qualitative research (43). Focus
groups can be criticized for producing consensus opinion or
favoring the most dominant members of the group (44). How-
ever, they were chosen due to the potential for group discus-
sion to elicit ideas (e.g., suggestions for support provision)
that may not arise from one-to-one interviews (45). Further,
focus groups were useful in identifying whether the men val-
ued the opportunity to talk to other men with the same condi-
tion. A further limitation of this study is the small size of
some of the focus groups. In an attempt to keep the groups of
an acceptable size for men (n 5 4–6) (30), we avoided over-
recruitment, which may have increased the likelihood of low
attendance (46). Strengths of the study are that it sampled
patients for a range of disease duration and disability and
from 7 consultants across 3 UK hospitals, thereby accessing a
range of disease experiences and care pathways. Further, a
patient research partner contributed to the study design, data
collection, and interpretation (RN).
These novel data focusing on men with RA suggest that
men have a range of experiences living with RA and a range
of coping styles to address the issues they experience. The
similarities between the issues identified as specific to men
with other long-term conditions suggest that some of these
experiences, coping styles, and support preferences may not
be shared with women. Thus, there is a realistic possibility
that many men with RA are not being served by current self-
management interventions. Further research should investi-
gate the generalizability of these findings and whether the
coping styles and support preferences of men with RA are
broadly different than those of women with RA. This is now
being addressed through a survey study informed by these
findings, which will enable an informed judgement of
whether there is a clinical need to provide services tailored
toward the potentially different needs of men.
