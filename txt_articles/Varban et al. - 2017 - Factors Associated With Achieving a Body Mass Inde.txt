IMPORTANCE Achieving a body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared) of less than 30 is an important goal of bariatric surgery, given the
increased risk for weight-related morbidity and mortality with a BMI above this threshold.
OBJECTIVE To identify predictors for achieving a BMI of less than 30 after bariatric surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective study used data from the Michigan
Bariatric Surgery Collaborative, a statewide quality improvement collaborative that uses a
prospectively gathered clinical data registry. A total of 27 320 adults undergoing primary
bariatric surgery between June 2006 and May 2015 at teaching and nonteaching hospitals
in Michigan were included.
EXPOSURE Bariatric surgery.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Logistic regression was used to identify predictors for
achieving a BMI of less than 30 at 1 year after surgery. Secondary outcome measures included
30-day postoperative complications and 1-year self-reported comorbidity remission.
RESULTS A total of 9713 patients (36%; mean [SD] age, 46.9 [11.3] years; 16.6% male)
achieved a BMI of less than 30 at 1 year after bariatric surgery. A significant predictor for
achieving this goal was a preoperative BMI of less than 40 (odds ratio [OR], 12.88; 95% CI,
11.71-14.16; P < .001). Patients who had a sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass, or duodenal
switch were more likely to achieve a BMI of less than 30 compared with those who
underwent adjustable gastric banding (OR, 8.37 [95% CI, 7.44-9.43]; OR, 21.43 [95% CI,
18.98-24.19]; and OR, 82.93 [95% CI, 59.78-115.03], respectively; P < .001). Only 8.5% of
patients with a BMI greater than 50 achieved a BMI of less than 30 after bariatric surgery.
Patients who achieved a BMI of less than 30 had significantly higher reported rates of
medication discontinuation for hyperlipidemia (60.7% vs 43.2%, P < .001), diabetes (insulin:
67.7% vs 50.0%, P < .001; oral medications: 78.5% vs 64.3%, P < .001), and hypertension
(54.7% vs 34.6%, P < .001), as well as a significantly higher rate of sleep apnea remission
(72.5% vs 49.3%, P < .001) and higher satisfaction rate (92.8% vs 78.0%, P < .001)
compared with patients who did not.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with a preoperative BMI of less than 40 are more
likely to achieve a BMI of less than 30 after bariatric surgery and are more likely to experience
comorbidity remission. Policies and practice patterns that delay bariatric surgery until the
BMI is 50 or greater can result in significantly inferior outcomes.

 I
t is estimated that more than 34% of adults in the United
States are classified as obese, with a body mass index (BMI,
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared) greater than or equal to 30.1 Obesity is related to
more than 40 diseases including type 2 diabetes, heart dis-
ease,hypertension,stroke,osteoarthritis,obstructivesleepap-
nea, and cancer.1-4 Moreover, individuals with a BMI of 30 or
greater have a 50% to 100% increased risk for premature death
when compared with individuals of a healthy weight.5
Bariatric surgery has been shown to be the most effective
treatment for morbid obesity, resulting in significant improve-
ment of multiple weight-related comorbidities and a reduc-
tion in a person’
s risk for premature death.2,4,6-14 However,
given that weight loss after bariatric surgery varies depend-
ing on procedure type, age, and comorbid conditions, not all
patients achieve a target weight that promotes optimal
health.15-17 Among patients with diabetes, Schauer et al18 dem-
onstrated a paradoxical effect in which the gain in life expec-
tancy after bariatric surgery decreased as the preoperative BMI
increased above 62.
In this context, we analyzed data from a statewide clini-
cal registry to determine how many patients achieve a target
BMI of less than 30 at 1 year after bariatric surgery and iden-
tified predictive factors for achieving this goal. We also com-
pared 30-day postoperative complication rates and 1-year self-
reported comorbidity remission between patients who did and
did not achieve this goal.
Methods
Study Design
Thisisaretrospectivereviewofapayer-fundedstatewideclini-
cal data registry that is used by the Michigan Bariatric Sur-
gery Collaborative (MBSC) for quality improvement. In this
study, patients who had achieved a BMI of less than 30 at 1 year
after bariatric surgery were compared with patients who had
not. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors for
achieving a BMI of less than 30. Overall 30-day postoperative
complications and 1-year self-reported comorbidity remis-
sion were also compared between the 2 groups. This study was
approved by the institutional review board of the University
of Michigan for the MBSC; written consent was obtained from
participants.
Study Population
The MBSC is composed of 38 bariatric surgery programs and
70 surgeons across the state of Michigan and includes both
teaching and nonteaching hospitals. The program adminis-
ters a prospective, externally audited clinical outcomes reg-
istryandparticipatinghospitalssubmitdataonallpatientswho
undergo primary and revisional bariatric procedures. Data in-
clude information on patient demographics, socioeconomic
status, preoperative weight and comorbid conditions, post-
operative complications, and weight loss outcomes. Patient
data are obtained by data abstractors from in-hospital rec-
ords 30 days after surgery as well as from patient surveys ob-
tained at 1, 2, and 3 years after surgery. Centrally trained ab-
stractors review medical records using a standardized and
validated instrument and each hospital within the MBSC is au-
dited annually by nurses from the coordinating center to verify
that the data are complete and accurate.
For this study, we identified all patients 18 years and older
who underwent primary bariatric surgery between June 2006
and May 2015 and had a weight reported at 1 year after sur-
gery (N = 27 320), which represented 50% of all primary bar-
iatric cases during the study period. Among these patients, we
also identified patients who submitted both a baseline sur-
vey and a 1-year follow-up survey (n = 19 764). Bariatric pro-
cedures included laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding
(LAGB),laparoscopicoropenRoux-en-Ygastricbypass(RYGB),
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), and biliopancreatic di-
version with duodenal switch (BPD/DS). Patients who had re-
visional bariatric surgery or did not have a reported weight at
1 year after surgery were excluded. Given that the study popu-
lation represents 50% of the entire clinical registry, we com-
pared demographic, socioeconomic, and preoperative comor-
bidities between those who did and did not have 1-year
follow-up data (eTable in the Supplement).
Study Outcomes and Data Collected
The primary outcome variable was BMI at 1 year after bariat-
ric surgery. Secondary outcome measures included 30-day
postoperative complications and 1-year self-reported comor-
bidity remission. Data on patient characteristics included age,
sex, preoperative and postoperative weight and BMI, weight
loss percentage prior to surgery, race/ethnicity, income level,
education, private insurance, and comorbidities including dia-
betes, cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, hy-
pertension, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux dis-
ease, obstructive sleep apnea, venous thromboembolism,
history of smoking, lung disease, liver disease, kidney dis-
ease, peptic ulcer disease, mobility limitation, arthritis, psy-
chological disorders, and urinary incontinence. Data on op-
erative characteristics included procedure type (LAGB, RYGB,
LSG, or BPD/DS) and 30-day complication rates were also col-
lected. Complications included bowel obstruction, leak, ab-
dominal abscess, wound complication, dehiscence, hemor-
rhage, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction or
cardiac arrest, renal failure, pneumonia, reintubation, pro-
longed ventilator use, shock, hospital-acquired infections, and
Key Points
Question Which patients achieve a body mass index (BMI) of less
than 30 after bariatric surgery?
Findings In this study using a statewide clinical registry, 36% of
patients achieved a BMI of less than 30 at 1 year after bariatric
surgery. Significant predictors for success included a preoperative
BMI of less than 40 and undergoing a metabolic procedure such as
sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass, or duodenal switch.
Meaning Bariatric surgery is optimal in patients with a BMI of
less than 40; delaying surgical treatment for obesity can lead to
inferior results.

 death. Serious complications were defined as potentially life-
threatening complications including those that required in-
vasive interventions such as percutaneous drainage or reop-
eration, blood transfusions of 4 or more units of blood,
respiratory failure requiring more than 2 days of intubation,
renal failure requiring in-hospital or long-term dialysis, ve-
nous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction or cardiac ar-
rest, and death. Comorbidity remission was defined as self-
reported discontinuation of treatment for the condition in
patients receiving treatment on baseline surveys. Data on co-
morbidity remission included discontinuation of medication
for hyperlipidemia, diabetes (oral medication and/or insu-
lin), hypertension, and discontinuation of continuous posi-
tive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnea.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics between those achieving a BMI of less
than 30 at 1 year and those who did not were compared using
χ2 square and t tests as appropriate. Logistic regression analy-
sis was used to identify predictors of achieving a BMI of less
than 30 among patient characteristics and procedure type. Lo-
gistic regression analysis was also used to compare comorbid-
ity remission, complication rates, and patient satisfaction be-
tween patients who achieved a BMI of less than 30 at 1 year vs
those who did not. The odds ratio (OR) and associated confi-
dence intervals and P values are reported. To adjust for the ef-
fects of procedure type, age, and preoperative BMI on post-
operative BMI, we fitted a multivariable logistic model with
these factors as additional covariates. Rates are presented as
percentages for categorical variables or means (SDs) for con-
tinuous variables.
Results
A total of 27 320 patients were included in the study. The over-
all mean (SD) BMI at 1 year after bariatric surgery was 33 (6.8)
and the mean (SD) preoperative BMI was 48 (8.2). The most
common procedure performed during the study period was
RYGB (44%), followed by LSG (38%), LAGB (16%), and BPD/DS
(1%). A total of 9713 patients (36%) achieved a BMI of less than
30 at 1 year after surgery. The mean (SD) age of these patients
was 46.9 (11.3) years and the mean (SD) preoperative BMI was
42.66 (4.89). The most common procedure performed in this
group was RYGB (57%) followed by LSG (36%).
Table 1 compares patient demographics, preoperative co-
morbidities, and procedure types between patients who did
and did not achieve a BMI of less than 30 at 1 year after sur-
gery. Significant predictors for achieving the target BMI in-
cluded a preoperative BMI of less than 40 (OR, 12.88; 95% CI,
11.71-14.16; P < .001) and private insurance (OR, 1.09; 95% CI,
1.02-1.16; P = .002). Only 8.5% of patients with a BMI of 50 or
greater achieved a BMI of less than 30 after bariatric surgery.
Patients who underwent LSG, RYGB, or BPD/DS also had a
higher likelihood of achieving a BMI of less than 30 when com-
paredwiththosewhounderwentLAGB(OR,8.37[95%CI,7.44-
9.43]; OR, 21.43 [95% CI, 18.98-24.19]; and OR, 82.93 [95% CI,
59.78-115.03], respectively; P < .001).
Patients who achieved a BMI of less than 30 were signifi-
cantly more likely to discontinue treatment for hyperlipid-
emia (60.7% vs 43.2%, P < .001), diabetes (insulin: 67.7% vs
50.0%, P < .001; oral medications: 78.5% vs 64.3%, P < .001),
hypertension (54.7% vs 34.6%, P < .001), and sleep apnea re-
mission (72.5% vs 49.3%, P < .001) and to report feeling highly
satisfied with their surgery (92.8% vs 78.0%, P < .001) when
compared with patients who did not (Table 2 and Table 3).
Overall and serious risk-adjusted 30-day complication rates
were similar between the patients who did and did not achieve
a BMI of less than 30 at 1 year after surgery (8.29% vs 7.08%,
P = .87 and 2.28% vs 1.97%, P = .73, respectively).
Discussion
In this population-based study of morbidly obese patients un-
dergoing bariatric surgery in Michigan, we found that 36% of
patients achieved a BMI of less than 30 at 1 year after surgery.
A key predictor of achieving this important weight loss goal
was having a preoperative BMI of less than 40. Notably, the
likelihood of achieving a BMI of less than 30 after surgery was
only 8.5% when a patient’
s preoperative BMI was 50 or greater.
Patients who achieved this weight loss goal demonstrated sig-
nificant health benefits as they had a higher likelihood for co-
morbidity remission and were more likely to be satisfied with
their surgery.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess what pro-
portion of bariatric surgery patients achieve a BMI of less than
30 and to identify predictors for reaching this weight loss goal.
Our results echo those of similar studies that have evaluated
preoperative predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery.
In a systematic review of 115 articles between 1988 and 2010,
Livhits et al19 reported that baseline BMI was a significant pre-
dictor of weight loss and noted a 10.1% decrease in excess
weightloss(EWL)forsuperobesepatients(definedasBMI≥50).
Similarly, Ortega et al20 found that younger individuals with
a lower BMI had higher EWL and a higher rate of successful
weight loss (defined as EWL ≥60%) after RYGB and LSG. Fur-
ther, Lutfi et al21 reported that weight loss at 1 year after gas-
tric bypass was suboptimal in superobese patients and that pa-
tients with a BMI of less than 50 had the best chance of
achieving greater weight loss. It is important to note that EWL
percentage may appear exaggerated in relation to actual mass
lost in patients with lower initial BMI in these studies. How-
ever, it also highlights the advantages of early surgical man-
agement of obesity in that smaller amounts of weight loss are
required to achieve the desired effect. As with other studies,
we also found that metabolic procedures, such as gastric by-
pass, sleeve gastrectomy, and duodenal switch, are more likely
toachievegreaterweightlossthangastricbanding.11,15,22More-
over, metabolic procedures appear to have a more durable ef-
fect, particularly in patients with higher BMIs. Adams et al12
demonstrated improved survival among gastric bypass pa-
tients only when comparing a control group with patients with
a BMI of greater than 45.
Our results suggest that patients with morbid obesity
should be targeted for surgery when their BMI is still less

 than 40, as these patients are more likely to achieve a target
BMI that results in substantial reduction in weight-related
comorbidities. Our findings are supported by a recent study
of bariatric surgery outcomes by Schauer et al.18 They exam-
ined patients undergoing bariatric surgery at a single center
and demonstrated that the gain in life expectancy after bar-
iatric surgery decreases with increasing BMI. Furthermore,
they found no increase in life expectancy for patients with a
BMI greater than 62.18 Although it stands to reason that
patients with the highest BMI benefit the most from bariatric
surgery, they may remain morbidly obese even after excel-
lent weight loss and thus still have the same weight-related
comorbidities.
Despite evidence that patients with lower BMI may have
the most success from bariatric surgery, the mean BMI in our
cohort was 48, which is well above the National Institutes of
Health–established threshold for bariatric surgery (ie, BMI
>40 or BMI >35 with weight-related comorbidities). There
are several likely reasons that patients are not being referred
for surgery at a lower BMI. Bariatric surgery is commonly
considered as an intervention for morbid obesity only after
all other methods have failed and patients are at high
risk for morbidity and mortality from weight-related
comorbidities.23,24 Limited knowledge about the safety and
efficacy of bariatric surgery by both patients and referring
physicians have also been noted in prior studies.25,26
Patients may also wait until they experience worsening of
health issues or low energy levels that limit their activities.27
In turn, this may contribute to additional weight gain prior
to considering surgery.

 ance carriers mandate 3, 6, or 12 months of medically super-
vised weight loss. Although preoperative weight loss is typi-
cal of most surgery programs, its practice is still unproven.28-31
In some cases, the medically supervised weight loss require-
ment is waived if the BMI is 50 or greater. This may serve as
anincentiveforpatientsandreferringphysicianstopursuebar-
iatric surgery only after they have met this BMI threshold. Our
data suggest that these practices may have a detrimental ef-
fect on outcomes.
This study should not be interpreted to mean that pa-
tients with a higher BMI should be excluded from surgery.
WhilemanyofthesepatientswillnotachieveaBMIoflessthan
30, surgery continues to offer substantial benefits in terms of
weight loss, comorbidity reduction, and quality of life for these
patients when compared with medical management
alone.6,8,10,11Infact,withoutbariatricsurgery,theannualprob-
ability of achieving a healthy weight when the BMI is be-
tween40and44.9is1in1290formenand1in677forwomen.32
Instead, we interpret our data as demonstrating the benefits
of earlier surgical intervention for obesity as well as appropri-
ate counseling of expectations postoperatively. We also rec-
ognize the impact of certain regulations, such as mandatory
weight documentation, which may fail to optimize patient
selection.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, it is a retrospective
study that is limited to bariatric procedures performed in a
single state. In addition, we only had 1-year weight data on
50% of patients in the MBSC registry, which can lead to
selection bias. Despite these limitations, this study uses the
largest data set (>27 000 patients), to our knowledge, to
evaluate predictors for weight loss to date. Our bariatric-
specific registry also provides a more accurate assessment
than administrative data as the data are captured prospec-
tively and are audited annually for accuracy. It also includes
hospitals from a variety of settings (teaching and nonteach-
ing hospitals) with a diverse patient population. Also, our
study population was found to have similar mean BMI, dis-
tribution of BMI categories, and rates of diabetes, mobility
limitations, and gastroesophageal reflux disease when com-
pared with the remaining patients in the data registry.
Another limitation is that our study does not measure
patient behavioral characteristics that may be associated
with weight loss after bariatric surgery, according to Mitchell
et al.33 Data on binge eating behaviors, support group atten-
dance, level of physical activity, and social support are not
captured within the MBSC owing to concerns that survey
length may impact response rate. Our data did reveal that
patients who achieved a BMI of less than 30 reported less
mobility limitations, indicating that they may be more likely
to engage in physical activity, which may improve weight
loss. Furthermore, given the known alterations in neuroen-
docrine signaling after bariatric surgery, it is unclear whether
weight loss through a change in energy intake is simply a
matter of “will power” or compliance alone.
Conclusions
Patients who achieved a BMI of less than 30 at 1 year after bar-
iatric surgery had a significantly higher rate of comorbidity re-
mission and were more satisfied than those who did not. Pa-
tients with a preoperative BMI of less than 40 were more likely
to reach the weight loss goal, while less than 9% of patients
achieved this goal when their preoperative BMI was 50 or
greater.Metabolicprocedures,suchassleevegastrectomy,gas-
tric bypass, and duodenal switch, were more successful than
purelyrestrictiveones,suchasgastricbanding.Patientsshould
be counseled appropriately with respect to weight loss expec-
tations after bariatric surgery. Furthermore, policies and prac-
tice patterns that delay or incentivize patients to pursue bar-
iatric surgery only once the BMI is highly elevated can result
in inferior outcomes.
