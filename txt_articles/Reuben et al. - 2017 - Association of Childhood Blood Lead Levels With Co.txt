Abstract
Importance—Many children in the US and around the world are exposed to lead, a 
developmental neurotoxin. The long-term cognitive and socioeconomic consequences of lead 
exposure are uncertain.
Objective—To test the hypothesis that childhood lead exposure is associated with cognitive 
function and socioeconomic status in adulthood and with changes in IQ and socioeconomic 
mobility between childhood and midlife.
Design, Setting, and Participants—Prospective cohort study based on a population-
representative 1972–73 birth cohort from New Zealand, the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and 
Development Study, followed to age 38 years (December, 2012).

 Exposure—Childhood lead exposure ascertained as blood-lead levels measured at 11 years. 
High blood-lead levels were observed among children from all socioeconomic status levels in this 
cohort.
Main Outcomes and Measures—The IQ (primary outcome) and indexes of Verbal 
Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed (secondary 
outcomes) were assessed at 38 years using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–IV (WAIS-IV; 
IQ range 40–160). Socioeconomic status (primary outcome) was assessed at 38 years using the 
New Zealand Socioeconomic Index-2006, (NZSEI-06; range 10=lowest-90=highest).
Results—Of 1037 original participants, 1007 were alive at 38 years, of whom 565 (56%) had 
been lead tested at 11 years (54% male; 93% white). Mean blood-lead level at 11 years was 
10.99μg/dL (SD=4.63). Among blood-tested participants included at 38 years, mean WAIS-IV 
score was 101.16 (SD=14.82) and mean NZSEI-06 score was 49.75 (SD=17.12). After adjusting 
for maternal IQ, childhood IQ, and childhood socioeconomic status, each 5μg/dL higher level of 
blood-lead in childhood was associated with a 1.61-point lower score (95%CI:−2.48, −0.74) in 
adult IQ, a 2.07-point lower score (95%CI: −3.14, −1.01) in Perceptual Reasoning, and a 1.26-
point lower score (95%CI: −2.38, −0.14) in Working Memory. Lead-associated deficits in Verbal 
Comprehension and Processing Speed were not statistically significant. After adjusting for 
confounders, each 5μg/dL higher level of blood-lead in childhood was associated with a 1.79-unit 
lower score (95%CI: −3.17, −0.40) in socioeconomic status. An association between greater 
blood-lead levels and a decline in IQ and socioeconomic status from childhood to adulthood was 
observed, with 40% of the association with downward mobility mediated by cognitive decline 
from childhood.
Conclusion and Relevance—In this cohort born in New Zealand in 1972–1973, childhood 
lead exposure was associated with lower cognitive function and socioeconomic status at age 38 
years and with declines in IQ and downward social mobility. Childhood lead exposure may have 
long-term ramifications.
Introduction
Lead is a ubiquitous pollutant. Policies that eliminated lead from paint and gasoline were 
thought to have eliminated lead from most communities in the developed world. But the 
water crisis in Flint, Michigan has triggered renewed concern about lead poisoning.1 
Inhabitants of many U.S. cities are still exposed to high lead levels.2
Exposure to lead in childhood may adversely affect brain health and disrupt cognitive 
development.3 It is unknown if this disruption results in cognitive decline and altered 
socioeconomic trajectories by midlife, yet young adults with histories of childhood lead 
exposure have been reported to have lowered intellectual function4,5 and altered brain 
structure,6,7 suggesting that cognitive impairment persists at least to young adulthood. Few 
studies have yet documented longer-term cognitive consequences of childhood lead 
exposure, however, and none appear to have evaluated socioeconomic repercussions, apart 
from one study of highly-exposed, lead-poisoned children.8 To our knowledge, the longest-
term cognitive follow-ups have been to age 30 years, in a cohort too small (N=43) to 
adequately detect associations after adjusting for potential confounds.9

 The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study follows a population-
representative cohort of children born in New Zealand in 1972–1973. The most recent 
assessment included cognitive and socioeconomic evaluations and was completed when 
participants were 38 years old. In the 1970s and 1980s, lead exposures in New Zealand cities 
were consistently higher than international standards, largely due to poor air quality related 
to motor-vehicle emissions.10 Consequently, childhood blood-lead levels in the Dunedin 
cohort were similar to those of other cohorts tested in the early 1980s from larger developed 
cities.11,12 However, unlike with other cohorts,13,14 a social gradient in lead exposure was 
not observed. This provided an opportunity to test the hypothesis that childhood lead 
exposure is associated with cognitive impairment and downward socioeconomic mobility by 
midlife without having to disentangle such exposure from correlated socioeconomic 
disadvantages. Analyses also tested if the association between blood-lead levels and 
downward social mobility was mediated by cognitive decline.
Methods
Study Design and Population
Participants are members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, 
a longitudinal investigation of health and behavior in a birth cohort. The full cohort were all 
of the individuals born between April 1972 and March 1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand, who 
were eligible based on residence in the province and who participated in the first assessment 
at age 3. The cohort represented the full range of socioeconomic status in the general 
population of New Zealand's South Island.15 On adult health, the cohort matches the New 
Zealand National Health and Nutrition Survey on key health indicators (e.g. body mass 
index, smoking, visits to a physician).15 The cohort is primarily white; fewer than 7% self-
identify as having non-Caucasian ancestry, matching the demographics of the South 
Island.15 Assessments were carried out at birth and ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26, 32, 
and the most recent data collection was completed in December 2012, at age 38 years. 
Written informed consent was obtained from cohort participants and study protocols were 
approved by the institutional ethical review boards of the participating universities.
Measurement of childhood blood-lead levels
Approximately 30 ml of venous blood was collected from each 11-year-old who participated 
in the assessment carried out at the Research Unit and who freely agreed to give blood; 579 
of the 803 children (72%) who attended the Unit agreed to give blood. A further 122 
children were assessed at age 11 years in their schools, where blood could not be drawn; 
these children tended to live outside city limits. Whole blood samples were analyzed through 
graphite fumance atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Blood-lead is reported in 
micrograms per deciliter (1μg/dL=0.0483μmol/l). Details on the method of blood collection, 
division, storage, quality assurance and analysis procedures have been described 
previously.11,12
Measurement of cognitive functioning
Cognitive performance in adulthood was a primary outcome. It was assessed using the 
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale –IV (WAIS-IV; score range 40–160) at age 38 years.16

 The WAIS-IV generates the overall full-scale IQ, and in addition four WAIS-IV index scores 
assess abilities that make up the IQ: secondary outcomes Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual 
Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed. Cognitive performance in childhood 
was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R; score 
range 40–160)17,18 at ages 7 and 9 years (measured prior to blood-lead evaluation at age 11 
years) and averaged.
Measurement of socioeconomic status
Socioeconomic status in adulthood was a primary outcome. Socioeconomic status was 
assigned based on each participant’s current occupation at age 38 years. The New Zealand 
Socioeconomic Index (NZSEI-06) codes each occupation based on its associated education-
level and income in the NZ Census.19 (19 unemployed participants’ socioeconomic status 
was assigned based on their most recent occupation in their thirties; 14 homemakers’ 
socioeconomic status was imputed from their education, following the NZSEI-06 
algorithm.) Scores range from 10 (low status) to 90 (high status). The NZSEI-06 scores are 
further grouped into six socioeconomic status groups.19 Examples of occupations in the six 
groups include medical practitioner (NZSEI code = 90; group 6); engineering professional 
(66; group 5); database administrator (59; group 4); personal assistant (44; group 3); office 
cashier (28; group 2); fish filleter (23; group 1). Childhood socioeconomic status was 
defined as the mean of the highest occupational status level of either parent across Study 
assessments from the participants’ birth through age 15 years, measured using the Elley-
Irving scale,20 the forerunner of NZSEI, which also assigned occupations into one of six 
socioeconomic status groups (6 = professional; 1 = unskilled laborer).20 (A continuous 
measure was not available when childhood socioeconomic status was measured).
Statistical analysis
First, sample descriptive statistics were generated for the sample as a whole and separately 
for study members with and without blood-lead data. Differences between those with and 
without blood-lead data were examined using t-tests or chi-square tests as appropriate. 
Pearson correlations between all study variables were calculated using standard procedures 
(i.e., PROC CORR) in SAS v 9.3.
Second, the association between childhood blood-lead levels and adult outcomes was tested 
using Ordinary Least Squares multiple regression. The two pre-specified primary outcome 
variables were adult IQ (measured with the WAIS-IV) and adult socioeconomic status 
(measured with the NZSEI-06 score), respectively. Each outcome was examined using two 
models: (1) a “sex adjusted” model in which the outcome was regressed on childhood blood-
lead levels and sex, and (2) a “fully adjusted” model in which the outcome was regressed on 
childhood blood-lead levels and the following covariates: sex, childhood IQ, maternal IQ 
(assessed via the Science Research Associates verbal test21 administered to the Study 
mothers when the participants were 3 years old) and childhood socioeconomic status. The 
goal of the fully adjusted model was to evaluate the association between childhood blood-
lead levels and adult IQ and socioeconomic status using an analysis of covariance model of 
IQ and socioeconomic status change. Lead level was analyzed as a continuous measure. 
However, it is presented in terms of 5μg/dL units because the historic “level of concern”

 during the participants’ childhood was 10μg/dL and today it is 5μg/dl, making this unit 
meaningful to clinicians and policymakers. Moreover, 5μg/dL represents approximately 1 
SD of blood-lead level in the cohort. We also compared mean primary outcomes for 
participants with versus without childhood blood-lead levels above the historic international 
“level of concern” during their childhood (>10μg/dL).
Prespecified exploratory analyses tested associations between childhood blood-lead level 
and the four constituent abilities making up the IQ. No adjustments were made for the four 
multiple comparisons of secondary outcomes, so these should be interpreted as exploratory.
Only participants who had complete data on all covariates for each outcome were included 
in each model; no data were imputed. For adult IQ, 533 (94%) participants were analyzed; 
for adult socioeconomic status, 541 (96%) of participants were analyzed.
Third, in addition to the analysis of covariance, for illustrative purposes, change in IQ from 
childhood to adulthood as well as socioeconomic mobility were evaluated using change 
scores. Childhood IQ was subtracted from adulthood IQ where both IQs were measured on 
matched scales. IQ decline relative to cohort norms was signified by negative scores. 
Childhood (i.e., parental) socioeconomic status was subtracted from adult socioeconomic 
status, where both variables were measured on matched 6-category scales.19,20 Downward 
mobility was signified by negative scores.
Fourth, whether cognitive decline from childhood to adulthood mediated the association 
between childhood blood-lead levels and downward change in socioeconomic status was 
tested. Ordinary Least Squares regression was used to estimate a single-mediator model, 
using the Sobel test22 to estimate the significance of the mediation effect (see 
Supplementary Materials).
Analyses were conducted using SAS v9.3. Regression coefficients refer to dose increments 
of 5μg/dL in childhood blood-level. The threshold for statistical significance was P<.05, 
two-tailed. For sensitivity analyses all statistical analyses were repeated after subjecting the 
lead measure to a logarithmic transformation and a correction for hematocrit levels,23 and 
after incorporating two additional covariates into the fully-adjusted analysis of covariance: 
maternal smoking during pregnancy (assessed via maternal interview) and child birth weight 
(from hospital records).
Results
Of 1037 original cohort particiants, 1007 were still alive at age 38 years, 565 (56%) of 
whom had been lead tested at age 11 years (303[54%] male; 525[93%] white). Participants 
alive at age 38 years with childhood blood-lead data (N=565) and without childhood blood-
lead data (N=442) did not differ to a statistically significant extent from each other in terms 
of their mothers’ IQs, or their social class origins, but those without blood-lead data did have 
lower mean childhood IQs as a group (children not tested at the Unit tended to live outside 
city limits and such non-urban residents tended to have marginally lower IQs, 98.91 vs 
101.01),24 DifferenceNo Lead – Lead=−2.10, 95%CI (−3.99, −0.19), P=0.03 (Table 1). 
Correlations among primary study variables are shown in Table 2.

 Childhood blood-lead levels ranged from 4 to 31 μg/dL (mean=10.99, SD=4.63). 259 
participants (46%; 157[61%] male) had blood-lead levels above the historic international 
“level of concern” (10μg/dL) and 531 (94%; 288[54%] male) had levels above the current 
normal reference value (5μg/dL).25 Females had lower lead levels than males (Female 
N=262, mean=10.42; Male N=303, mean=11.49, DifferenceFemale – Male=−1.07; 95%CI 
(−1.82, −0.30); P=.007). There was no significant socioeconomic gradient in lead exposure 
in the Dunedin cohort children. High blood-lead levels were observed among children from 
all socioeconomic status groups (Figure 1).
Higher childhood blood-lead level was associated with poorer adult cognitive performance. 
Children with higher blood-lead levels at age 11 years scored lower than cohort peers on 
mean IQ tested at age 38 years (Table 3, Panel A). After controlling for participants’ own 
childhood IQ score, their mothers’ IQ score, and their socioeconomic background, each 
5μg/dL higher level of blood-lead in childhood was associated with an additional 1.61-point 
lower score (95%CI: −2.48, −0.74, P<.001) in full-scale IQ. Pre-specified exploratory 
analyses of the four constituent abilities making up the IQ showed children with higher 
levels of blood-lead at age 11 years scored lowest on indexes tapping perceptual reasoning 
and working memory (Table 3, Panel A). Figure 2 Panel A depicts the mean IQs at age 38 
years of participants at each childhood blood-lead level. Participants with childhood blood-
lead levels above the historic international “level of concern” (>10μg/dL) tested 4.25 mean 
IQ points lower in adulthood (95%CI: −6.75, −1.75, P<.001) than their peers with lower 
blood-lead levels (after adjusting for childhood IQ and the other covariates, 2.73 IQ points 
lower, (95%CI: −4.34, −1.12, P<.001). To evaluate IQ decline from childhood to adulthood, 
participants’ adult IQ scores were compared to their childhood IQ scores (Figure 3A). 
Participants above the “level of concern” exhibited a mean decline of 1.68 IQ points from 
childhood to adulthood. In contrast, those at or below the “level of concern” exhibited a 
mean increase of 1.22 IQ points from childhood to adulthood, a significant difference of 
2.90 IQ points (95%CI: 1.20, 4.61, P<.001).
Higher childhood blood-lead level was also associated with lower adult socioeconomic 
status. Children with higher blood-lead levels at age 11 years attained lower levels of 
socioeconomic status as adults than cohort peers (Table 3, Panel B). After controlling for 
participants’ own childhood IQ score, their mothers’ IQ score, and their socioeconomic 
background, each 5μg/dL higher level of blood-lead in childhood was associated with an 
additional 1.79-unit lower score (95%CI: −3.17, −0.40, P=.01) in socioeconomic status. 
Figure 2 Panel B depicts the mean socioeconomic status at age 38 years of participants at 
each childhood blood-lead level. Participants with childhood blood-lead levels above the 
historic international “level of concern” (>10μg/dL) attained a mean socioeconomic level 
4.51 points lower in adulthood (95%CI: −7.38, −1.64, P=.002) than their peers with lower 
blood-lead levels (after adjusting for childhood socioeconomic status and the other 
covariates, 3.42 units lower, 95%CI: −5.98, −0.85, P=.009). To evaluate socioeconomic 
mobility directly, participants’ adult socioeconomic status was compared to that of their 
parents’ on the same 6-point social class scale (Figure 3B). Participants above the “level of 
concern” exhibited an absolute mean decline of 0.18 social class scale points on the 6-point 
scale. In contrast, those at or below the “level of concern” exhibited a mean increase of 0.12

 social class scale points from childhood to adulthood, a significant difference of 0.30 scale 
points (95%CI: 0.04, 0.55, P=.02).
The association between childhood blood-lead levels and socioeconomic status decline from 
childhood to adulthood was partially but significantly mediated by decline in IQ from 
childhood to adulthood, after adjusting for covariates. IQ decline accounted for 40% of the 
association between childhood blood-lead levels and downward socioeconomic mobility, 
significantly reducing the association between childhood blood-lead levels and 
socioeconomic status change, Sobel test of mediation P=.002 (see Supplementary Materials 
Figure S1).
Descriptive statistics for study variables used in sensitivity analyses are presented in 
Supplementary Materials (Table S1) along with the results of the sensitivity analyses (Table 
S2). Subjecting the lead measure to a logarithmic transformation, correcting for hematocrit 
levels, and adding additional covariates did not materially alter the results.
Discussion
This longitudinal analysis of the association between childhood blood-lead levels and adult 
cognitive function and socioeconomic status revealed three findings. First, childhood blood-
lead level was associated with lower adult cognitive performance nearly three decades later, 
particularly on tests assessing perceptual reasoning and working memory ability, reflecting 
cognitive decline following childhood lead exposure. These associations were significant 
after adjusting for the participant’s own childhood IQ, their mother’s IQ, and their social 
class background. Second, childhood blood-lead level was associated with lower adult 
socioeconomic status, reflecting downward social mobility following childhood lead 
exposure. These associations too were significant after adjusting for the participant’s own 
childhood IQ, their mother’s IQ, and their social class background. Third, the relationship 
between childhood lead exposure and downward social mobility by midlife was partially, but 
significantly, mediated by cognitive decline following childhood lead exposure.
These results suggest that cognitive impairment associated with childhood lead exposure can 
persist and may worsen somewhat across decades (27 years in this study) to age 38 years. 
Each 5μg/dL higher blood-lead level in childhood was associated with an additional 1.61-
point lower score in adult IQ after adjusting for covariates. The effect sizes for adult 
cognitive impairment that were detected are small and do not constitute the extent of 
impairment that would attract clinical treatment. They are, however, similar to IQ deficits 
associated with other notable childhood risk factors, such as very low birth weight.26 
Despite being mild, the cognitive decline evident among lead-exposed children was 
accompanied by altered socioeconomic life trajectories, measurable as small but detectable 
downward social mobility by midlife for the most-exposed children regardless of their 
origins.
This study had the advantage of being able to use lead assays archived three decades ago, in 
a representative sample of children that is relatively large by the standards of research 
studies on lead exposure, and which has been followed to midlife. A strength of this study

 was the lack of social gradient in lead exposure observed in the Dunedin cohort. This 
afforded the opportunity to examine the long-term association between childhood lead 
exposure and adult outcomes without having to first disentangle exposure to lead from 
exposure to other harmful and often intertwined adversities, particularly poverty. The study’s 
findings are thus consistent with, but cannot prove, the hypothesis that lead exerts a 
degradative effect on cognitive ability and a downward pull on socioeconomic status over 
time regardless of where children start off in life. That said, these findings may not 
generalize to those settings where, as in the U.S., lead exposure is concentrated among the 
poor in larger cities and near former lead-emitting industries.27 As this study’s sample was 
primarily Caucasian, the findings also require replication in more ethnically-diverse 
samples.
There are limitations to this study. Although mean blood-lead levels in this New Zealand 
cohort were comparable to other developed-city cohorts born in the early 1970’s, the lead 
level gradient observed in the Dunedin cohort was nearly entirely (94% of participants) 
above the current blood-lead reference value for clinical attention (5μg/dL).25 This study’s 
results may not, therefore, be informative about the long-term consequences of very low lead 
exposures (<7.5μg/dL).28 Because the only measure of childhood lead exposure was taken at 
age 11 years this study could not evaluate sensitive periods of vulnerability to lead or 
evaluate cumulative exposure across childhood, although blood-lead level measured at 
school-age may be “a reasonable proxy for lifetime exposure” up to that point.3 (p174) 
There were also no measures of cumulative lead exposure to midlife, such as cortical bone-
lead level. This study could not, therefore, evaluate the differential influences of early-life 
versus later-life lead exposure. Recent studies of older adults suggest that lead exposure in 
adulthood associates with impaired cognitive function and accelerated cognitive decline in 
late life.29,30,31 While cumulative lead exposure in adulthood is an important metric for 
understanding the potential harms of lead absorbed across the lifespan, this study was 
focused on understanding the long-term consequences of early-life lead exposure. During 
the lifetime of the Dunedin cohort participants, lead exposure was reduced after childhood, 
as New Zealand began to phase lead out of its gasoline in the late 1980’s and removed it 
entirely in 1996.10 In many similar developed-country cities, adults now in their middle age 
will have also experienced their greatest lead exposures during childhood.3,12,13 In addition, 
this study was observational and correlational, and therefore does not establish a causal 
relation between lead exposure and outcomes, such as would be the case in a hypothetical 
experiment with children randomly assigned to lead exposure.
Notwithstanding its limitations, this study may hold implications for clinical practice and 
public policy. The results indicate that childhood exposures to lead can be linked with 
cognitive and socioeconomic outcomes detectable more than three decades later. For the 
clinician, evidence of cognitive decline from childhood to adulthood may argue for 
increased attention to possible early intervention with lead-exposed children.32 For 
communities that have experienced collective lead exposure events, and for countries where 
lead exposures are still routinely above health standards, the findings raise questions about 
the reasonable duration and magnitude of public responses. Just as the problem of toxic lead 
exposure in homes appears to persist, so too do the poor outcomes associated with such 
exposure. Short-lived public responses to community lead exposure may not be enough.

 Conclusion
In this cohort born in New Zealand in 1972–1973, childhood lead exposure was associated 
with lower cognitive function and socioeconomic status at age 38 years and with declines in 
IQ and downward social mobility. Childhood lead exposure may have long-term 
ramifications.

 Key Points
Question
Is childhood lead exposure associated with cognitive and socioeconomic outcomes in 
adults in a country where the degree of childhood lead exposure was not related to 
socioeconomic status?
Findings
In 565 New Zealanders followed for four decades, lead exposure in childhood was 
significantly associated with lower cognitive function and socioeconomic status at age 38 
years. Greater childhood lead exposure was also associated with greater declines in IQ 
from childhood to adulthood and greater declines relative to parents in occupational 
socioeconomic status. Downward socioeconomic mobility was partly explained by lead-
related cognitive impairment.
Meaning
Childhood lead exposure was associated with long-term cognitive and occupational 
ramifications.

 Figure 1. Distribution of blood-lead levels at age 11 years in Dunedin cohort children grouped by 
socioeconomic status
Note. Histograms and box plots depicting the distribution of childhood blood-lead levels for 
participants from low, middle, and high socioeconomic status families based on the 6-point 
Elley-Irving scale coding participants’ parents’ occupations and their associated income and 
education levels. Low childhood family socioeconomic status includes categories 1 and 2 on 
the 6-point scale; middle status includes categories 3 and 4; high status includes categories 5 
and 6. Histogram interval bins represent whole integers of blood-lead level. Shown in each 
box plot are the median value (white line), the 25th and 75th percentiles (box outer borders), 
and a lower-bound value equal to the 25th percentile minus 150% of the interquartile range 
and an upper-bound value equal to the 75th percentile plus 150% of the interquartile range 
(whiskers). High blood-lead levels were observed in all status groups. N=563 (two 
participants were not assigned a childhood socioeconomic status score).

 Figure 2. Association of childhood blood-lead level with WAIS-IV IQ (Panel A) and 
socioeconomic status (Panel B) in adulthood (unadjusted for covariates)
Note. Mean outcomes in adulthood with 95% confidence intervals (error bars) for each 
5μg/dL higher level of blood-lead in childhood. Each 5μg/dL higher level of blood-lead in 
childhood was associated with an additional 1.97-point lower score (95%CI: −3.34, −0.59, 
P=.005) in adult WAIS-IV full-scale IQ and an additional 1.94-unit lower score (95%CI: 
−3.50, −0.37, P=.02) in adult socioeconomic status (see Table 3). Socioeconomic status was 
assessed at age 38 years using the New Zealand Socioeconomic Index-2006 (NZSEI-06; 
range 10 = lowest – 90 = highest).

 Figure 3. Association of childhood blood-lead level with cognitive decline (Panel A) and 
downward socioeconomic mobility (Panel B) into adulthood (unadjusted for covariates)
Note. Mean change in outcome from childhood to adulthood with 95% confidence intervals 
(error bars) for each 5μg/dL higher level of blood-lead in childhood. To create IQ change 
scores, childhood IQ was subtracted from adulthood IQ where both IQs were measured on 
matched scales (WISC-R for child IQ and WAIS-IV for adult IQ). To create socioeconomic 
status change scores, childhood (i.e., parental) socioeconomic status was subtracted from 
adult socioeconomic status where both status variables were measured on comparable 6-
category scales (the Elley-Irving scale for childhood and the New Zealand Socioeconomic 
Index for adulthood) assessing socioeconomic status in New Zealand by assigning 
occupations into one of six socioeconomic status groups (6 = professional; 1 = unskilled 
laborer). Each 5μg/dL higher level of blood-lead in childhood was associated with a 1.61-
point decline (95%CI: −2.48, −0.74, P<.001) in full-scale IQ and with a 1.79-unit decline 
(95%CI: −3.17, −0.40, P=.01) in socioeconomic status (see Table 3).

Note. CI = Confidence Interval. Covariates in the fully adjusted model were sex, maternal IQ, participants’ childhood IQ and childhood socioeconomic status. N= 533–541. Of the Study participants alive at 
age 38 years with childhood blood-lead measured, 533 (94%) also had present data on all the covariates and the IQ outcome measures. Of those alive at age 38 years with childhood blood-lead measured, 
541 (96%) had present data on all the covariates and the socioeconomic status outcome measure. IQs are standardized to M=100, SD=15. Socioeconomic status was assessed at age 38 years using the New 
Zealand Socioeconomic Index-2006 (NZSEI-06; range 10 lowest – 90 highest). Regression coefficients indicate change in outcome per 5μg/dL increase in childhood blood-lead level.
