Abstract
Transient, multi-protein complexes are important facilitators of cellular functions. This includes 
the chaperome, an abundant protein family comprising chaperones, co-chaperones, adaptors, and 
folding enzymes—dynamic complexes of which regulate cellular homeostasis together with the 
protein degradation machinery1–6. Numerous studies have addressed the role of chaperome 
members in isolation, yet little is known about their relationships regarding how they interact and 
function together in malignancy7–17. As function is probably highly dependent on endogenous 
conditions found in native tumours, chaperomes have resisted investigation, mainly due to the 
limitations of methods needed to disrupt or engineer the cellular environment to facilitate analysis. 
Such limitations have led to a bottleneck in our understanding of chaperome-related disease 
biology and in the development of chaperome-targeted cancer treatment. Here we examined the 
chaperome complexes in a large set of tumour specimens. The methods used maintained the 
endogenous native state of tumours and we exploited this to investigate the molecular 
characteristics and composition of the chaperome in cancer, the molecular factors that drive 
chaperome networks to crosstalk in tumours, the distinguishing factors of the chaperome in 
tumours sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition, and the characteristics of tumours that may benefit 
from chaperome therapy. We find that under conditions of stress, such as malignant transformation 
fuelled by MYC, the chaperome becomes biochemically ‘rewired’ to form a network of stable, 
survival-facilitating, high-molecular-weight complexes. The chaperones heat shock protein 90 
(HSP90) and heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) are nucleating sites for these physically and 
functionally integrated complexes. The results indicate that these tightly integrated chaperome 
units, here termed the epichaperome, can function as a network to enhance cellular survival, 
irrespective of tissue of origin or genetic background. The epichaperome, present in over half of

 all cancers tested, has implications for diagnostics and also provides potential vulnerability as a 
target for drug intervention.
To investigate the chaperome in tumours we first analysed HSP90, the most abundant 
chaperome member in human cells1,2. In cultured non-transformed cells and in normal 
primary breast tissue (NPT, the normal tissue surrounding or adjacent to the corresponding 
primary tumour) (Fig. 1a, b), HSP90 focused primarily as a single species at the predicted 
isoelectric point (pI) of 4.9. However, cancer cell lines analysed by this method contained a 
complex mixture of HSP90 species spanning a pI range of 4.5 to 6; HSP90α and HSP90β 
isoforms were part of these complexes. Furthermore, although all cancer cell lines contained 
a number of HSP90 complexes with pI < 4.9, a subset was enriched in HSP90 complexes 
with the unusual pI of ≥5, herein referred to as ‘type 1’ cells. We refer to cancer cell lines 
that contained mainly complexes with pI < 4.9 as ‘type 2’ cells. This distinction in HSP90 
complexes was also evident in primary tumours (Fig. 1b). The total levels of HSP90 were 
essentially identical among all analysed samples, irrespective of whether they were type 1 or 
type 2 (Fig. 1a; see further analyses).
Under denaturing conditions, HSP90 in type 1 tumours focused mainly at the pI of ~4.9 
(Fig. 1c). We therefore directed our attention on proteins interacting with HSP90 as the main 
instrument for pI change in type 1 tumours. HSP90 is known to interact with several co-
chaperones including activator of HSP90 ATPase homologue 1 (AHA1, also known as 
AHSA1), cell division cycle 37 (CDC37), and HSP70–HSP90 organizing protein (HOP, also 
known as stress-inducible phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1)) which links HSP90 to the HSP70 
machinery. Each of these co-chaperones has a distinct role. CDC37 facilitates activation of 
kinases, AHA1 augments HSP90 ATPase activity, and HSP70 and HOP participate in the 
chaperoning of proteins2–5,13. We observed that cultured cells and primary tumours enriched 
in the high pI HSP90 species were also enriched in high-molecular-weight, multimeric 
forms of HSP90 and of other essential chaperome members (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 
2c–e).
We found that PU-H71, an HSP90 inhibitor that binds to HSP90 more strongly when HSP90 
is complexed with co-chaperones and onco-client proteins7,18,19, also bound HSP90 more 
tightly in type 1 than in type 2 cells (Extended Data Fig. 3a–j). This was independent of 
chaperome expression or intracellular ATP levels (as PU-H71 is an ATP competitor) 
(Extended Data Fig. 4). At the molecular level, and unlike the anti-HSP90 antibody H9010, 
the small fraction of cellular HSP90 that was part of the high-molecular-weight species 
enriched in type 1 tumours was most sensitive to PU-H71 (Extended Data Fig. 3c, h).
Our data suggested that a biochemically altered chaperome exists in type 1 tumours, so we 
investigated its composition (Fig. 1e–h). HSP90 protein isolates in type 1 tumours contained 
a significant enrichment of a number of chaperome proteins known to function as chaperone, 
co-chaperone, scaffolding, adaptor, interface mediators, foldase and isomerase proteins. 
Surprisingly, they also incorporated a large number of HSP70 chaperone regulators, in 
addition to the expected and known HSP90 regulators (Supplementary Discussion). 
Similarly, an HSP70- directed bait isolated numerous HSP90 regulators in type 1 tumours 
(Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 5a–e). Multiple connectivity networks that integrate the

 HSP90 and HSP70 machineries and expand their functional reach through participating 
scaffolding proteins were characteristic of type 1 but not of type 2 tumours or non-
transformed cells (Fig. 1g). High-molecular-weight complexes that incorporate HSP90, 
HOP, HSC70 (heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein, the constitutively expressed HSP70 
paralogue also known as HSPA8)2 and its co-chaperone HSP110 (heat shock 105 kDa/110 
kDa protein 1)2, were present in type 1 but not in type 2 or non-transformed cells. The 
HSP90 bait readily depleted these multimeric species but left the non-bound HSC70 and 
HSP110 species unaltered (Fig. 1h). Similarly, dual knock-down of HSP90α and HSP90β or 
AHA1 modulated the high molecular HSC70 complexes only in type 1 tumours; knockdown 
of HSP110 modulated the multimeric HSP90 complexes only in type 1 tumours. Only the 
HOP knockdown modulated HSP90 and HSP70 complexes in both tumour types (Extended 
Data Fig. 5f, g). HSP90 was functional in both tumour types (chaperoned the kinases EGFR 
and p-S6K) and knockdown of HSP90 and AHA1 inhibited this activity in both tumour 
types (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Both the HSP90α and HSP90β paralogues, but mainly 
HSC70 and not HSP70 (the inducible HSP70 paralogue also known as HSP72 or 
HSP70-1)2, participated in the reconfiguration of the chaperome in type 1 tumours 
(Extended Data Fig. 5h, i). Substantial reconfiguration of the chaperome organization only 
modestly affected the total chaperome levels (Extended Data Fig. 5g, h).
Together, these results lend support for the existence in type 1 tumours of HSP90- and 
HSP70-centric complexes that incorporate the co-chaperones of both machineries and 
integrate the chaperome into a large functional and physical network (Fig. 1h). Through 
scaffolding, adaptor, and interface modulator proteins, they bridge the chaperome to 
numerous cellular processes vital for tumour cell function. We refer to this highly integrated 
chaperome network of type 1 tumours as the epichaperome. Only a fraction of the entire 
chaperome pool participates in the chaperome rewiring of type 1 tumours. In contrast to the 
integrated epichaperome found in type 1 cells, no such integration is found in normal cells 
and type 2 tumours. In those cases, the HSP90 machinery only loosely interacts with the 
HSP70 machinery, mainly through the ubiquitous HSP90–HOP–HSP70 connection. In type 
2 tumours, the two major chaperome machineries co-exist as insular chaperome 
communities that are only partially connected to each other.
Next, we investigated the functional relevance of the integrated epichaperome as compared 
to that of individual chaperome members or individual chaperome machineries. First, we 
investigated the reliance of type 1 and type 2 tumours on individual chaperome members 
(Fig. 2). In cells with essentially identical HSP90 levels, targeting of both HSP90α and 
HSP90β was toxic to type 1 but not type 2 tumours (Fig. 2a). We confirmed this in mice 
bearing xenograft tumours (Fig. 2b), in primary specimens ex vivo (Fig. 2c), and in human 
patients (Extended Data Fig. 6a). By contrast, while being toxic only to type 1 tumours, 
targeting of HSP90 inactivated its chaperone activity in both tumour types (see inhibition 
and/or degradation of HSP90 regulated proteins and pathways, such as EGFR and PI3K/
AKT, and cell growth inhibition with similar half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) 
potencies; Extended Data Fig. 6b–i). As observed for HSP90, downregulation of other 
individual chaperome members led to cell death in type 1 but not in type 2 cells (Fig. 2d). 
When we interfered with epichaperome formation by reducing the levels of one of its 
components, AHA1, cells became less amenable to killing by PU-H71 (Extended Data Fig. 
Rodina et al.

 7a). From these observations, we propose that the epichaperome has a role as the survival 
facilitator of type 1 tumours. In type 1 tumours, we observed that a striking decline (>95% at 
protein level, Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 7b–f) in overall total HSP90 levels was 
initially paralleled by an increase in the epichaperome. This occurred by an increased 
production of chaperome members that presumably sequestered the remaining HSP90 into 
the high-molecular-weight complexes. Under these conditions of low total HSP90 but high 
epichaperome levels, no cell death was observed. HSP90 function was also not impaired (see 
EGFR and p-S6K). As HSP90 levels continued to drop, however, an inflection was 
observed. At this point, the epichaperome levels dropped, chaperome members were 
depleted, a sudden drop in HSP90 function occurred, and cell death ensued. Epichaperome 
expression significantly correlated with cell viability (Fig. 2f). In contrast, in type 2 cells, a 
similar drastic reduction of HSP90 levels halted its activity, but failed to re-wire the 
chaperome into the epichaperome and did not result in cell death (Extended Data Fig. 7g). 
Together, these findings are consistent with the formation of the epichaperome as a survival 
mechanism for type 1 tumours. When the epichaperome is dismantled by ablation of a 
chaperome component, the network collapses and leads to cell death. In type 2 tumours in 
which the integration of the chaperome is only partial and most chaperome members 
function as insular communities, depletion of a chaperome member only ‘locally’ 
compromises the chaperome, while overall cellular survival is maintained (Fig. 2g).
To understand the molecular mechanisms leading to epichaperome formation, we 
investigated the HSP90 interactome in type 1 and type 2 cells (Extended Data Fig. 5b). We 
identified MYC as a transcription factor that could most probably explain the protein 
signature observed in type 1 tumours. MYC target genes were significantly enriched in type 
1 tumours, as was a MYC transcriptional signature and positive regulators of MYC 
expression/function (Extended Data Fig. 8). We experimentally confirmed a significantly 
higher MYC transcriptional activity in type 1 versus type 2 cancer cells (Fig. 3a). 
Knockdown of MYC re-wired type 1 cells into type 2; this was reflected in the composition 
of the chaperome complexes, the binding to PU-H71 and reduced sensitivity to HSP90 
inhibition (Fig. 3b–d). We also observed a decrease in MYC mRNA and protein levels in 
type 1 cells that became resistant to HSP90 inhibitors after long-term treatment with 
suboptimal HSP90 inhibitor concentrations, and demonstrated their rewiring into type 2 cells 
(Fig. 3b–d and Extended Data Fig. 9a–e). However, the introduction of a functional MYC 
gene into a type 2 cancer cell rewired it to become type 1 (Fig. 3b–d and Extended Data Fig. 
9f–l). Oncogenes that require single chaperome machinery activity for sufficient 
transformative power (for example, vSRC and mutated MET kinase require HSP90 (ref. 3)) 
were unable to induce the formation of the epichaperome, nor was epichaperome formation 
necessary to buffer their oncogenic function (Extended Data Fig. 9m–p). Together these 
findings suggest that the transcription factor, MYC, at least in part, causes the molecular 
rewiring of the chaperome into the epichaperome as observed in type 1 tumours (Fig. 3e).
The data point to the epichaperome and not the individual chaperome members as potential 
targets of chaperome-directed intervention in cancer. We thus assessed the prevalence of 
tumours expressing the epichaperome complexes. In probing cancer cell lines representing 
pancreatic, gastric, lung, and breast cancers, as well as lymphomas and leukaemias, we 
found that approximately 60–70% presented medium to high levels of epichaperome

 complexes (Fig. 4a). Similar results were obtained with primary liquid tumours (Fig. 4b) and 
solid tumours including lymphomas (Fig. 4c). This establishes that over half of tumours 
tested use the epichaperome irrespective of their subtype, provenance or genetic background. 
Toxicity to HSP90 inhibition correlated with the presence of the epichaperome (P = 0.0006; 
R2 = 0.71) but was independent of the levels of chaperome members, HSP90 client proteins, 
anti-apoptotic proteins and genetic alterations. This correlation held in over 90 cell lines 
encompassing breast cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic and gastric cancers, leukaemia and 
lymphomas (P < 0.0001; R2 = 0.44) and was true for several HSP90 inhibitors19,20 
(Extended Data Fig. 10). The data thus indicate that it is the abundance of the epichaperome, 
and not merely its existence, that is indicative of the reliance of tumours on the 
epichaperome. If patients were to be selected for epichaperome therapy, not only the 
existence of this species but also its abundance should be measured. To further confirm these 
findings, we collected primary breast cancer specimens (n = 40) obtained from surgery. Of 
these, 23 specimens were suitable samples to be evaluated for PU-H71 sensitivity and/or 
epichaperome abundance by isoelectric focusing (IEF) (that is, HSP90 of a pI > 4.9) and 
total HSP90 by SDS–PAGE (Fig. 4d). In these specimens, we found a spectrum of 
sensitivities, ranging from 0% to 100% for apoptotic response, with 56% undergoing at least 
50% apoptosis when challenged with 0.5 μM PU-H71. Abundance of the epichaperome but 
not of total HSP90 significantly correlated with sensitivity (Fig. 4d, P < 0.0001).
Here we report the discovery of a new mechanism of tumour regulation. Our study unveils a 
novel usage of the chaperome in epichaperome networks for cancer cell survival. The 
epichaperome results from changes in the chaperome that are driven by a change in the 
cellular milieu, that is, activation of MYC, rather than defects in the chaperome members, 
composition, number or structure. It manifests as an enhanced physical integration of the 
HSP90 and HSP70 machineries, resulting in the utilization of their capacities in the tumour 
cell environment, and thereby also presenting a vulnerability that might possibly be 
exploited therapeutically with pharmacological modulators. Our results offer a blueprint for 
the future development of therapeutic inhibitors specific for multimeric chaperome 
complexes, and might encourage further drug developments and advances in innovative 
companion diagnostics (Extended Data Fig. 1).
Methods
Reagents
HSP90 inhibitors used in this study including PU-H71, PU-DZ13, NVP-AUY922, and 
SNX-2112 were synthesized as previously reported7,19. 17-DMAG was purchased from 
Sigma. HSP90 bait (PU-H71 beads)21, HSP70 bait (YK beads)22, biotinylated YK (YK-
biotin)22, fluorescently labelled PU-H71 (PU-FITC)23, the control derivatives PU-TEG and 
PU-FITC9 (ref. 24), and the radiolabelled PU-H71-derivative 124I-PU-H71 (ref. 25) were 
generated as previously described. The specificity of PU-H71 for HSP90 and over other 
proteins was extensively analysed7. Thus binding of PU-H71 in cell homogenates, live cells 
and organisms denotes binding to HSP90 species characteristic of each analysed tumour or 
tissue. Combined with the findings that PU-H71 binds more tightly to HSP90 in type 1 than 
in type 2 cells, an observation true for cell homogenates, live cells, and in vivo, at the

 organismal level, we propose that labelled versions of PU-H71 are reliable tools to perturb, 
identify and measure the expression of the high-molecular-weight, multimeric HSP90 
complexes in tumours. The specificity of YK probes for HSP70 was previously 
reported22,26–28.

NIH-3T3 cell lines stably expressing either mutant MET (Y1248H) or vSRC, were provided 
by L. Neckers, National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA, and were previously reported29,30.
Primary breast cancer specimens
Patient tissue was obtained with informed consent and authorized through institutional 
review board (IRB)-approved bio-specimen protocol number 09-121 at Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Centre (New York, New York). Specimens were treated for 24 h or 48 h 
with the indicated concentrations of PU-H71 as previously described31. Following treatment, 
slices were fixed in 4% formalin solution for 1 h, then stored in 70% ethanol. For tissue 
analysis, slices were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, slide-mounted, and stained with 
haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Apoptosis and necrosis of the tumour cells (as percentage) 
was assessed by reviewing all the H&E slides of the case (controls and treated ones) in toto, 
blindly, allowing for better estimation of the overall treatment effect to the tumour. In 
addition, any effects to precursor lesions (if present) and any off-target effects to benign 
surrounding tissue, were analysed. Tissue slides were assessed blindly by a breast cancer 
pathologist who determined the apoptotic events in the tumour, as well as any effect on 
adjacent normal tissue31.
Primary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)
Cryopreserved primary AML samples were obtained with informed consent and Weill 
Cornell Medical College IRB approval (IRB number 0910010677 and IRB number 
0909010629). Samples were thawed and cultured for in vitro treatment as described 
previously32.
Clinical trials
The microdose 124I-PU-H71 PET-CT (Dunphy, M. PET imaging of cancer patients using 
124I-PUH71: a pilot study available from: http://clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01269593) and 
phase I PU-H71 therapeutic (Gerecitano, J. The first-in-human phase I trial of PU-H71 in 
patients with advanced malignancies available from: http://clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01393509) 
studies were approved by the institutional review board (protocols 10-139 and 11-041, 
respectively), and conducted under an exploratory investigational new drug (IND) 
application approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Patients provided signed 
informed consent before participation. 124I-PU-H71 tracer was synthesized in-house by the 
institutional cyclotron core facility at high specific activity.
Epichaperome detection by PU-PET (124I-PU-H71 positron emission tomography)
For PU-PET, research PET-CT was performed using an integrated PET-CT scanner 
(Discovery DSTE, General Electric). CT scans for attenuation correction and anatomic 
coregistration were performed before tracer injection. Patients received 185 megabecquerel 
(MBq) of 124I-PU-H71 by peripheral vein over two minutes. PET data were reconstructed 
using a standard ordered subset expected maximization iterative algorithm. Emission data 
were corrected for scatter, attenuation, and decay. 124I-PU-H71 scans (PU-PET) were 
performed at 24 h after tracer administration. Each picture shown in Fig. 4c and Extended

 Fig. 6a is a scan taken of an individual patient. PET window display intensity scales for 
FDG and PU-PET fusion PET-CT images are given for both PU-PET and FDG-PET. 
Numbers in the scale bar indicate upper and lower SUV thresholds that define pixel intensity 
on PET images. The phase I trial included patients with solid tumours and lymphomas who 
had undergone prior treatment and currently had no curative treatment options. Patient 
cohorts were treated with PU-H71 at escalating dose levels determined by a modified 
continuous reassessment model. Each patient was treated with his or her assigned dose of 
PU-H71 on day 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 21-day cycle.
Neurons
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were differentiated with a modified dual-SMAD 
inhibition protocol towards floor plate-based midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons as 
described previously33. hESCs were maintained on mouse embryonic fibroblasts and 
passaged with Dispase (STEMCELL Technologies). For each differentiation, hESCs were 
harvested with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technology). At day 30 of differentiation, hESC-
derived mDA neurons were replated and maintained on dishes precoated with polyornithine 
(PO; 15 μg ml−1), laminin (1 μg ml−1), and fibronectin (2 μg ml−1) in Neurobasal/ B27/l-
glutamine-containing medium (NB/B27; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10 μM 
Y-27632 (until day 32) and with BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, 20 ng ml−1; 
R&D), ascorbic acid (AA; 0.2 mM, Sigma), GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic 
factor, 20 ng ml−1; R&D), TGFβ 3 (transforming growth factor type β 3, 1 ng ml−1; R&D), 
dibutyryl cAMP (0.5 mM; Sigma), and DAPT (10 nM; Tocris). Two days after replating, 
mDA neurons were treated with 1 μg ml−1 mitomycin C (Tocris) for 1 h to kill any 
remaining non-post mitotic contaminants. Assays were performed at day 65 of neuron 
differentiation.
Epichaperome abundance measurement using the PU-FITC flow cytometry assay
The PU-FITC assay was performed as previously described7,23. Briefly, cells were incubated 
with 1 μM PU-FITC at 37 °C for 4 h. Then cells were washed twice with FACS buffer (PBS/
0.5% FBS), and resuspended in FACS buffer containing 1 μg ml−1 DAPI. HL-60 cells were 
used as internal control to calculate fold binding for all cell lines tested. The mean 
fluorescence intensity (MFI) of PU-FITC in treated viable cells (DAPI negative) was 
evaluated by flow cytometry. For primary AML specimens, cells were also stained with anti-
CD45-APC-H7, to identify blasts and lymphocyte populations (BD biosciences). Blasts and 
lymphocyte populations were gated based on SSC versus CD45. The fold PU-FITC binding 
of leukaemic blasts (CD45dim) was calculated relative to lymphocytes (CD45hiSSClow). 
The FITC derivative FITC9 was used as a negative control.
PU-FITC microscopy
Cells were seeded on coverslips in 6-well plate and cultured overnight. Cells were treated 
with 1 μM PU-FITC or negative control (PU-FITC9, an HSP90 inert PU-H71 derivative 
labelled with FITC). At 4 h post-treatment, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde at room 
temperature for 30 min, and the coverslips were mounted on slides with DAPI-Fluoromount-
G Mounting Media (Southern Biotech). The images were captured using EVOS FL Auto 
imaging system (ThermoFisher Scientific) or a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM5).

 HSP90 immunofluorescence staining
Cells were seeded on coverslips and cultured overnight. Cells were fixed with 4% 
formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min, washed three times with PBS, and 
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in blocking buffer (PBS/5% BSA) for 10 min. Cells 
were incubated in blocking buffer for 30 min, and then incubated with rabbit anti-human 
HSP90α antibody (1:500, Abcam 2928) and mouse anti-human HSP90β (1:500, Stressmarq 
H9010), or rabbit and mouse normal IgG, in blocking buffer for 1 h. Cells were washed 
three times with PBS, and incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 and goat anti-
rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1,000, ThermoFisher Scientific) in blocking buffer in the dark for 
1 h. Cells were then washed three times with PBS, and the coverslips were removed from 
the plate, and mounted on slides with DAPI-Fluoromount-G Mounting Media (Southern 
Biotech). The images were captured using EVOS FL Auto imaging system (ThermoFisher 
Scientific) or a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM5). Fluorescence intensity was quantified by 
the integrated density algorithm as implemented in ImageJ.
PU-FITC or GM-cy3B binding to HSP90 in cell homogenates
Assays were carried out in black 96-well microplates (Greiner Microlon Fluotrac 200). A 
stock of 10 μM PU-FITC (or GM-cy3B34) was prepared in DMSO and diluted with Felts 
buffer (20 mM Hepes (K), pH 7.3, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM 
Na2MoO4, and 0.01% NP40 with 0.1 mg ml−1 BGG). To each well was added the 
fluorescent dye-labelled HSP90 ligand (3 nM PU-FITC or 6 nM GM-cy3B), and cell lysates 
(7.5 μg) in a final volume of 100 μl Felts buffer. For each assay, background wells (buffer 
only), and tracer controls (PU-FITC only) were included on assay plate. To determine the 
equilibrium binding of GM-cy3b, increasing amounts of lysate (up to 20 μg of total protein) 
were incubated with tracer. The assay plate was placed on a shaker at room temperature for 
60 min and the FP values in mP were measured every 5 min. At time t = 60 min, dissociation 
of fluorescent ligand was initiated by adding 1 μM PU-H71 in Felts buffer to each well and 
then placing the assay plate on a shaker at room temperature and measuring the FP values in 
mP every 5 min. The assay window was calculated as the difference between the FP value 
recorded for the bound fluorescent tracer and the FP value recorded for the free fluorescent 
tracer (defined as mP – mPf). Measurements were performed on a Molecular Devices 
SpectraMax Paradigm instrument (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and data were 
imported into SoftMaxPro6 and analysed in GraphPad Prism 5.
Protein analysis by the NanoPro capillary-based immunoassay platform
To identify and separate chaperome complexes in tumours, and to overcome the limitations 
of classical protein chromatography methods for resolving complexes of similar composition 
and size, we took advantage of a capillary-based platform that combines isoelectric focusing 
(IEF) with immunoblotting capabilities35. This methodology uses an immobilized pH 
gradient to separate native multimeric protein complexes based on their isoelectric point 
(pI), and allows for subsequent probing of immobilized complexes with specific antibodies. 
The method uses only minute amounts of sample, thus enabling the interrogation of primary 
specimens. Cultured cells were lysed in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 
0.01% NP40, 20 mM Na2MoO4 buffer, containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors.

 Primary specimens were lysed in either Bicine-Chaps or RIPA buffers (ProteinSimple). Total 
protein assay was performed on an automated system, NanoPro 1000 Simple Western 
(ProteinSimple), for charge-based separation. Briefly, total cell lysates were diluted to a final 
protein concentration of 250 ng μl−1 using a master mix containing 1× Premix G2 pH 3-10 
separation gradient (Protein simple) and 1×isoelectric point standard ladders 
(ProteinSimple). Samples diluted in this manner maintained their native charge state, and 
were loaded into capillaries (ProteinSimple) and separated based on their isoelectric points 
at a constant power of 21,000 μ Watts for 40 min. Immobilization was performed by UV-
light embedded in the Simple Western system, followed by incubations with anti- HSP90β 
(SMC-107A, StressMarq Biosciences), anti-HSP90α (ab2928, Abcam), anti-HSP70 
(SPA-810, Enzo), AKT (4691), P-AKT (9271) or BCL2 (2872) from Cell Signaling 
Technology and subsequently with HRP-conjugated anti-Mouse IgG (1030-05, 
SouthernBiotech) or with HRP-conjugated anti-Rabbit IgG (4010-05, SouthernBiotech). 
Protein signals were quantitated by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Dura 
Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Scientific), and digital imaging and associated 
software (Compass) in the Simple Western system, resulting in a gel-like representation of 
the chromatogram. This representation is shown for each figure.
Western blotting
Protein was extracted from cultured cells in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 
buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors added (Complete tablets and PhosSTOP 
EASYpack, Roche). Ten to fifty μg of total protein was subjected to SDS–PAGE, transferred 
onto nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with indicated antibodies. HSP90β 
(SMC-107) and HSP110 (SPC-195) antibodies were purchased from Stressmarq; HER2 
(28-0004) from Zymed; HSP70 (SPA-810), HSC70 (SPA-815), HIP (SPA-766), HOP 
(SRA-1500), and HSP40 (SPA- 400) from Enzo; HSP90β (ab2927), HSP90α (ab2928), p23 
(ab2814), GAPDH (ab8245) and AHA1 (ab56721) from Abcam; cleaved PARP (G734A) 
from Promega; CDC37 (4793), CHIP (2080), EGFR (4267), S6K (2217), phospho-S6K 
(S235/236) (4858), P-AKT (S473) (9271), AKT (4691), P-ERK (T202/Y204) (4377), ERK 
(4695), MCL1 (5453), Bcl-XL (2764), BCL2 (2872), c-MYC (5605) and HER3 (4754) from 
Cell Signaling Technology; and β-actin (A1978) from Sigma-Aldrich. The blots were 
washed with TBS/0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with appropriate HRP-conjugated 
secondary antibodies. Chemiluminescent signal was detected with Enhanced 
Chemiluminescence Detection System (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer’s 
instructions.
Native-cognate antibodies
We screened a panel of anti-chaperome antibodies for those that interacted with the target 
protein in its native form. We reasoned that these antibodies were more likely to capture 
stable multimeric forms of the chaperome members. These native-cognate antibodies were 
used in native-PAGE and IEF analyses of chaperome complexes. HSP90β (SMC-107) and 
HSP110 (SPC-195) antibodies were purchased from Stressmarq; HSP70 (SPA-810), HSC70 
(SPA-815), HOP (SRA-1500), and HSP40 (SPA-400) from Enzo; HSP90β (ab2927), 
HSP90α (ab2928), and AHA1 (ab56721) from Abcam; CDC37 (4793) from Cell Signaling 
Technology.

 Native gel electrophoresis
Cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% NP40, and 10% 
glycerol buffer by a freeze-thaw procedure. Primary samples were lysed in either Bicine-
Chaps or RIPA buffers (ProteinSimple). Twenty-five to one hundred μg of protein was 
loaded onto 4–10% native gradient gel and resolved at 4 °C. The gels were immunoblotted 
as described above following either incubation in Tris-Glycine-SDS running buffer for 15 
min before transfer in regular transfer buffer for 1 h, or directly transferred in 0.1% SDS-
containing transfer buffer for 1 h.
siRNA knockdown
Cells were plated at 1 × 106 per 6 well-plate and transfected with an siRNA against human 
AHA1 (AHSA1; 5′-TTCAAATTGGTCCACGGATAA-3′), HSP90α (HSP90AA1; no. 1 
5′-ATGGCATGACAACTACTTTAA-3′; no. 2 5′-AACC CTGACCATTCCATTATT-3′; no.
3 5′-TGCACTGTAAGACGTATGTAA-3′), HSP90β (HSP90AB1; no., 5′-
CAAGAATGATAAGGCAGTTAA-3′; no. 5′-TACGTT GCTCACTATTACGTA-3′; no.3 
5′-CAGAAGACAAGGAGAATTACA-3′) HSP90α /β (no.1 5′-
CAGAATGAAGGAGAACCAGAA-3′, no.2 5′-CACAACGA TGATGAACAGTAT-3′), 
HSP110 (HSPH1; 5′-AGGCCGCTTTGTAGTTC AGAA-3′) from Qiagen or HOP (STIP1) 
(Dharmacon; M-019802-01), or a negative control (scramble; 5′-
CAGGGTATCGACGATTACAAA-3′) with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen), 
incubated for 72 h and subjected to further analysis.
qRT–PCR
Total mRNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s 
recommended protocol. Reverse transcription of mRNA into cDNA was performed using 
QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen). qRT–PCR was performed using PerfeCTa 
SYBR (Quanta Bioscience), 10 nM AHSA1 (forward: 5′-
GCGGCCGCTTCTAGTAGTTT-3′ and reverse: 5′-CATCTCTCTCCGTCCAGTGC-3′) 
and GAPDH (forward: 5′-CAAAGGCACAGTCAAGGCTGA-3′ and reverse: 5′-
TGGTGAAGACG CCAGTAGATT-3′) primers, or 1× QuantiTect Primers for HSP110 
(HSPH1), HSP90α (HSP90AA1), HSP90β (HSP90AB1), HSP70 (HSPA1A), HOP (STIP1) 
(Qiagen) following recommended PCR cycling conditions. Melting curve analysis was 
performed to ensure product uniformity.
Protein depletion
To investigate which of the two HSP70 paralogues is involved in epichaperome formation 
we performed immunodepletions with HSP70 and HSC70 antibodies. Protein lysates were 
immunoprecipitated consecutively three times with either an HSP70 (Enzo, SPA-810), 
HSC70 (Enzo, SPA-815) or HOP (kindly provided by M. B. Cox, University of Texas at El 
Paso), or with the same species normal antibody as a negative control (Santa Cruz). The 
resulting supernatant was collected and run on a native or a denaturing gel.

 Native gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing (IEF) under denaturing conditions
Tumour lysates were mixed with 10 M urea (dissolved in Felts buffer) to reach the indicated 
final concentrations of 2 M, 4 M and 6 M. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature 
or frozen overnight at −80 °C, the lysates were loaded onto 4–10% native gradient gel and 
resolved at 4 °C or applied to the IEF capillary. The HSP90β bands were detected by using 
antibody purchased from Stressmarq (SMC-107).
MYC knockdown by lentiviral-delivered shRNA
A lentiviral vector expressing the MYC shRNA, as previously described36, was requested 
from Addgene (Plasmid 29435, c-MYC shRNA sequence: 
GACGAGAACAGTTGAAACA). Viruses were prepared by co-transfecting the shRNA 
vector, the packaging plasmid psPAX2 and the envelop plasmid pMD2.G into HEK293 
cells. OCI-LY1 cells were then infected with lentiviral supernatants in the presence of 4 μg 
ml−1 polybrene for 24 h. Following flow cytometry selection for positive cells, cells were 
expanded for further experiments. The MYC protein level was confirmed at 10 days post-
infection by western blot using the anti-MYC antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 5605).
Exogenous MYC expression
Viruses were prepared by co-transfection of the lentiviral vector expressing the MYC 
shRNA with pLM-mCerulean-2A-cMyc (Addgene, 23244) or pCDH-puro-cMYC 
(Addgene, 46970), the packaging plasmid psPAX2, and the envelope plasmid pMD2.G into 
HEK293 cells. ASPC1 cells were then infected with lentiviral supernatants in the presence 
of 4 μg ml−1 polybrene for 24 h and sorted for mCerulean positive cells or selected with 
puromycin treatment. Changes in cell size after infection were monitored by analysing the 
forward scatter (FSC) of intact cells via flow cytometry. MYC protein levels were analysed 
at 4 days post-infection by western blot.
MYC transcription factor binding activity assay
Whole cell extracts were prepared by homogenizing cells in RIPA buffer (20 mM HEPES 
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, protease 
inhibitors). MYC activity was determined using the TransAM c-Myc Kit (Active Motif, 
43396), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell viability assessment ATP assay
Cell viability was assessed using CellTiter-Glo luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) 
after a 72 h PU-H71 treatment. The method determines the number of viable cells in culture 
based on quantification of the ATP present, which signals the presence of metabolically 
active cells, and was performed as previously reported37. For the annexin V staining, cells 
were labelled with Annexin V-PE and 7AAD after PU-H71 treatment for 48 h, as previously 
reported38. The necrotic cells were defined as annexin V+/7AAD+, and the early apoptotic 
cells were defined as annexin V+/7AAD−. For the LDH assay the release of lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) into the culture medium only occurs upon cell death. Following 
indicated treatment, the culture medium was collected and centrifuged to remove living cells

 and cell debris. The collected medium was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 
the Cytotox-96 Non-radioactive Assay kit (Promega) LDH substrate.
In vivo studies
All animal studies were conducted in compliance with MSKCC’s Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines. Female athymic nu/nu mice (NCRNU-M, 20–25 
g, 6 weeks old) were obtained from Harlan Laboratories and were allowed to acclimatize at 
the MSKCC vivarium for 1 week before implanting tumours. Mice were provided with food 
and water ad libitum. Tumour xenografts were established on the forelimbs for PET imaging 
and on the flank for efficacy studies. Tumours were initiated by sub-cutaneous injection of 1 
× 107 cells for MDA-MB-468 and 5 × 106 for ASPC1 in a 200 μl cell suspension of a 1:1 
v/v mixture of PBS with reconstituted basement membrane (BD Matrigel, Collaborative 
Biomedical Products). Before administration, a solution of PU-H71 was formulated in 
citrate buffer. Sample size was chosen empirically based on published data39. No statistical 
methods were used to predetermine sample size. Animals were randomly assigned to 
groups. Studies were not conducted blinded.
Small-animal PET imaging
Imaging was performed with a dedicated small-animal PET scanner (Focus 120 microPET; 
Concorde Microsystems, Knoxville, TN). Mice were maintained under 2% isoflurane 
(Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL) anaesthesia in oxygen at 2 litres per min during the entire 
scanning period. To reduce the thyroid uptake of free iodide arising from metabolism of 
tracer, mice received 0.01% potassium iodide solution in their drinking water starting 48 h 
before tracer administration. For PET imaging, each mouse was administered 9.25 MBq 
(250 μCi) of 124I-PU-H71 via the tail vein. List-mode data (10 to 30 min acquisitions) were 
obtained for each animal at various time points post-tracer administration. An energy 
window of 420–580 keV and a coincidence timing window of 6 ns were used. The resulting 
list-mode data were sorted into 2-dimensional histograms by Fourier rebinning; transverse 
images were reconstructed by filtered back projection (FBP). The image data were corrected 
for non-uniformity of scanner response, dead-time count losses, and physical decay to the 
time of injection. There was no correction applied for attenuation, scatter, or partial-volume 
averaging. The measured reconstructed spatial resolution of the Focus 120 is 1.6-mm 
FWHM at the centre of the field of view. Region of interest (ROI) analysis of the 
reconstructed images was performed using ASIPro software (Concorde Microsystems, 
Knoxville, TN), and the maximum pixel value was recorded for each tissue/organ ROI. A 
system calibration factor (that is, μCi per ml per cps per voxel) that was derived from 
reconstructed images of a mouse-size water-filled cylinder containing 18F was used to 
convert the 124I voxel count rates to activity concentrations (after adjustment for the 124I 
positron branching ratio). The resulting image data were then normalized to the administered 
activity to parameterize the micro- PET images in terms of per cent injected dose per gram 
(%ID per g) ( corrected for decay of 124I to the time of injection). Post-reconstruction 
smoothing was applied only for visual representation of images in the figures. Upon 
euthanasia, radio-activity (124I) was measured in a gamma-counter (Perkin Elmer 1480 
Wizard 3 Auto Gamma counter) using a 400–600 keV energy window. Count data were 
background- and decay-corrected to the time of injection, and the percent injected dose per

 gram (%ID per g) for each tumour sample was calculated using a calibration curve to 
convert counts to radioactivity, followed by normalization to the total activity injected.
Efficacy studies
Mice (n = 5) bearing MDA-MB-468 or ASPC1 tumours reaching a volume of 100–150 mm3 
were treated i.p. using PU-H71 (75mg per kg) or vehicle, on a 3 times per week schedule, as 
indicated. Tumour volume (in mm3) was determined by measurement with Vernier calipers, 
and was calculated as the product of its length × width2 × 0.5. Tumour volume was 
expressed on indicated days as the median tumour volume ± s.d. indicated for groups of 
mice. Mice were euthanized after similar PU-H71 treatment periods, and at a time before 
tumours reached a size that resulted in discomfort or difficulty in physiological functions of 
mice in the individual treatment group, in accordance with our IUCAC protocol.
LC-MS/MS analyses
Frozen tissue was dried and weighed before homogenization in acetonitrile/H2O (3:7). PU-
H71 was extracted in methylene chloride, and the organic layer was separated and dried 
under vacuum. Samples were reconstituted in mobile phase. The concentrations of PU-H71 
in tissue or plasma were determined by high-performance LC-MS/MS. PU-H71-d6 was 
added as the internal standard40. Compound analysis was performed on the 6410 LC-
MS/MS system (Agilent Technologies) in multiple reaction monitoring mode using positive-
ion electrospray ionization. For tissue samples, a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (2.1 × 
50 mm, 3.5 μm) was used for the LC separation, and the analyte was eluted under an 
isocratic condition (80% H2O + 0.1% HCOOH: 20% CH3CN) for 3 min at a flow rate of 0.4 
ml min−1. For plasma samples, a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (4.6 × 50 mm, 5 μm) 
was used for the LC separation, and the analyte was eluted under a gradient condition (H2O 
+ 0.1% HCOOH:CH3CN, 95:5 to 70:30) at a flow rate of 0.35 ml min−1.
Chemical bait precipitation and proteomics
Protein extracts were prepared either in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 
1% NP40, and 20 mM Na2MoO4 for PU-H71 beads pull-down, or in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 
150 mM NaCl, and 1% NP40 for YK beads pull-down. Samples were incubated with the 
PU-H71 beads (HSP90 bait) for 3–4 h or with the YK beads (HSP70 bait, for chemical 
precipitation) overnight, at 4 °C, then washed and subjected to SDS–PAGE with subsequent 
immunoblotting and western blot analysis. For HSP70 proteomic analyses, cells were 
incubated with a biotinylated YK-derivative, YK-biotin. Briefly, MDA-MB-468 cells were 
treated for 4 h with 100 μM biotin-YK5 or d-biotin as a negative control. Cells were 
collected and lysed in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% NP40 buffer. Protein 
extracts were incubated with streptavidin agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) for 1 h at 4 °C, 
washed with 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% NP40 buffer and applied onto 
SDS– PAGE. The gels were stained with SimplyBlue Coomassie stain (Invitrogen Life 
Science Technologies). Proteomic analyses were performed using the published 
protocol7,18,22. Control beads contained an inert molecule as previously described7,18,22.

 Protein identification by nano-liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis
Affinity-purified protein complexes from type 1 tumours (n = 6; NCI-H1975, MDA-
MB-468, OCI-LY1, Daudi, IBL1, BC3), type 2 tumours (n = 3; ASPC1, OCI-LY4, Ramos) 
and from non-transformed cells (n = 3; MRC5, HMEC and neurons) were resolved using 
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by staining with colloidal, SimplyBlue 
Coomassie stain (Invitrogen Life Science Technologies) and excision of the separated 
protein bands. Control beads that contained an inert molecule were subjected to the same 
steps as PU-H71 and YK beads and served as a control experiment. To ensure that we 
captured a majority of the HSP90 complexes in each cell type, we performed these studies 
under conditions of HSP90-bait saturation. The number of gel sections per lane averaged to 
be 14. In situ trypsin digestion of gel bound proteins, purification of the generated peptides 
and LC–MS/MS analysis were performed using our published protocols7,18,22. After the 
acquisition of raw files, Proteowizard (version 3.0.3650)41 was used to create a Mascot 
Generic Format (mgf) file containing accurate mass for each peak and its corresponding ms2 
ions. Each mgf was then subjected to search a human segment of Uniprot protein database 
(20,273 sequences, European Bioinformatics Institute, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and 
Protein Information Resource) using Mascot (Matrix Science; version 2.5.0; http://
www.matrixscience.com). Decoy proteins were added to the search to allow for the 
calculation of false discovery rates (FDR). The search parameters were as follows: (i) two 
missed cleavage tryptic sites were allowed; (ii) precursor ion mass tolerance = 10 p.p.m.; 
(iii) fragment ion mass tolerance = 0.8 Da; and (iv) variable protein modifications were 
allowed for methionine oxidation, deamidation of asparagine and glutamines, cysteine 
acrylamide derivatization and protein N-terminal acetylation. MudPit scoring was typically 
applied using significance threshold score P < 0.01. Decoy database search was always 
activated and, in general, for merged LS–MS/MS analysis of a gel lane with P < 0.01, false 
discovery rate averaged around 1%. The Mascot search result was finally imported into 
Scaffold (Proteome Software, Inc.; version 4_4_1) to further analyse tandem mass 
spectrometry (MS/MS) based protein and peptide identifications. X! Tandem (The GPM, 
http://thegpm.org; version CYCLONE (2010.12.01.1) was then performed and its results are 
merged with those from Mascot. The two search engine results were combined and 
displayed at 1% FDR. Protein and peptide probability was set at 95% with a minimum 
peptide requirement of 1. Protein identifications were expressed as Exclusive Spectrum 
Counts that identified each protein listed. Primary data, such as raw mass spectrometry files, 
Mascot generic format files and proteomics data files created by Scaffold have been 
deposited onto the Massive site (https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp; 
MassIVE Accession ID: MSV000079877). In each of the Scaffold files that validate and 
import Mascot searched files, peptide matches, scoring information (Mascot, as well as X! 
Tandem search scores) for peptide and protein identifications, MS/MS spectra, protein views 
with sequence coverage and more, can be easily accessed. To read the Scaffold files, free 
viewer software can be found at (http://www.proteome-software.com/products/free-viewer/). 
Peptide matches and scoring information that demonstrate the data processing are available 
in Supplementary Table 1f–q.

 Bioinformatics analyses
The exclusive spectrum count values, an alternative for quantitative proteomic 
measurements42, were used for protein analyses. CHIP and PP5 were examined and used as 
internal quality controls among the samples. Statistics were performed using R (version 
3.1.3) limma package43,44. For entries with zero spectral counts, and to enable further 
analyses, we assigned an arbitrary small number of 0.1. The data were then transformed into 
logarithmic base 10 for analysis. Linear models were fit to the transformed data and 
moderated standard errors were calculated using empirical Bayesian methods. For Fig. 1f 
and Extended Data Fig. 5a, a moderated t-statistic was used to compare protein enrichment 
between type 1 cells and combined type 2 and non-transformed cells45. For Extended Data 
Fig. 5b, the t-statistic was performed to compare protein enrichment among type 1 cells, 
type 2 cells and non-transformed cells (see Supplementary Table 1). Heat maps were created 
to display the selected proteins using the package “gplots” and “lattice”46,47. See 
Supplementary Table 1 in which the table tab ‘a’ corresponds to Fig. 1f and contains core 
chaperome networks in type 1, type 2 and non-transformed cells; the table tab ‘b’ 
corresponds to Extended Data Fig. 5a and contains comprehensive chaperome networks in 
type 1, type 2 and non-transformed cells; the table tab ‘c’ corresponds to Extended Data Fig. 
5b and Extended Data Fig. 8b and contains the HSP90 interactome as isolated by the HSP90 
bait in type 1, type 2 and non-transformed cells; the table tab ‘d’ corresponds to Extended 
Data Fig. 8a and contains upstream transcriptional regulators that explain the protein 
signature of type1 tumours and the table tab ‘e’ contains metastasis-related proteins 
characteristic of type 1 tumours.
The protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and upstream transcriptional regulators
To understand the physical and functional protein-interaction properties of the HSP90-
interacting chaperome proteins enriched in type 1 tumours, we used the Search Tool for the 
Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database48. Proteins displayed in the heat 
map were uploaded in STRING database to generate the PPI networks. STRING builds 
functional protein-association networks based on compiled available experimental evidence. 
The thickness of the edges represents the confidence score of a functional association. The 
score was calculated based on four criteria: co-expression, experimental and biochemical 
validation, association in curated databases, and co-mentioning in PubMed abstracts48. 
Proteins with no adjacent interactions were not shown. The colour scale in nodes indicates 
the average enrichment of the protein (measured as exclusive spectral counts) in type 1, type 
2, and non-transformed cells, respectively. The network layout for type 1 tumours was 
generated using edge-weighted spring-electric layout in Cytoscape with slight adjustments 
of marginal nodes for better visualization49. The layout for type 2 and non-transformed cells 
retains that of type 1 for better comparison. Proteins with average relative abundance values 
less than 1 were deleted from analyses. The biological processes in which they participate 
and the functionality of proteins enriched in type 1 tumours were assigned based on gene 
ontology terms and based on their designated interactome from UniProtKB, STRING, 
and/or I2D databases48,50–53. The Upstream Regulator analytic, as implemented in Ingenuity 
Pathways Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN Redwood City, http://www.qiagen.com/ingenuity), was 
used to identify the cascade of upstream transcriptional regulators that can explain the 
observed protein expression changes in type 1 tumours. The analysis is based on prior

 knowledge of expected effects between transcriptional regulators and their target genes 
stored in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. The analysis examines how many known targets of 
each transcription regulator are present in the data set, and calculates an overlap P value for 
upstream regulators based on significant overlap between dataset genes and known targets 
regulated by a transcription regulator. For Extended Data Fig. 8b, proteins were selected 
based on 3 pre-curated lists (MYC target genes based on the analysis report from 
INGENUITY, MYC signature genes based on the reported list provided in ref. 54 and MYC 
expression/ function activators were manually curated from UniProt and GeneCards 
databases).
Sequencing data
Cell lines with information available in the cBioPortal for cancer genomics (http://
www.cbioportal.org) were evaluated for mutations in pathways implicated in cancer: P53, 
RAS, RAF, PTEN, PIK3CA, AKT, EGFR, HER2, CDK2NA/B, RB, MYC, STAT1, STAT3, 
JAK2, MET, PDGFR, KDM6A, KIT. Mutations in major chaperome members (HSP90AA1, 
HSP90AB1, HSPH1, HSPA8, STIP1, AHSA1) were also evaluated.
Statistical analysis
Data were visualized and statistical analyses performed using GraphPad Prism (version 6; 
GraphPad Software) or R statistical package. In each group of data, estimate variation was 
taken into account and is indicated in each figure as s.d. or s.e.m. If a single panel is 
presented, data are representative of 2 or 3 biological or technical replicates, as indicated. P 
values for unpaired comparisons between two groups with comparable variance were 
calculated by two-tailed Student’s t-test. Pearson’s tests were used to identify correlations 
among variables. Significance for all statistical tests was shown in figures for not significant 
(NS), * P < 0.05, * * P < 0.01, * * * P < 0.001 and * * * * P < 0.0001. No samples or 
animals were excluded from analysis, and sample size estimates were not used. Animals 
were randomly assigned to groups. Studies were not conducted blinded, with the exception 
of all patient specimen histological analyses.

 Extended Data
Extended Data Figure 1. Summary of the experimental design and findings
a, Schematic of the experimental approach to address four key questions concerning the 
chaperome in cancer: (1) what are the molecular characteristics and composition of the 
chaperome in cancer; (2) what molecular factors drive chaperome networks to crosstalk in 
tumours; (3) what distinguishes the chaperomes of tumours that are sensitive to 
pharmacologic inhibition from those that are not; and (4) what are the characteristics of 
tumours that may benefit from chaperome therapy? To retain the endogenous proteome/
chaperome make-up and function, we applied a variety of chemical biology tools and 
biochemical methods that retain native protein conformations and complexes. This approach 
minimally interferes with the system it interrogates, thus providing answers closer to the 
reality of disease. When applicable, data were validated by alternative and complementary 
methods, as indicated. This approach led to the discovery of a novel mechanism of tumour 
regulation. Specifically, we have identified and characterized the epichaperome, a modified 
chaperome network. Our data demonstrate that heterogeneous and stable, multimeric 
chaperome complexes nucleating on HSP90 and HSP70, and incorporating co-chaperones, 
isomerases, scaffolding proteins, and transport proteins, bring about the effective physical 
and functional integration of the chaperome machinery into the epichaperome. Chaperome 
rewiring into the epichaperome is fuelled by powerful transcription activators such as MYC. 
Only under conditions in which the chaperome becomes tightly integrated both functionally

 and physically to form the epichaperome are tumours addicted to individual chaperome 
members. The epichaperome is the survival mechanism for type 1 tumours; when the 
epichaperome is dismantled by ablation of a component chaperome, the chaperome network 
collapses leading to cell death. In contrast, in type 2 tumours in which the integration of the 
chaperome is only partial and most chaperome members function as insular communities, 
depletion of chaperome members only ‘locally’ compromises the chaperome, maintaining 
overall cellular survival. b, c, Therapeutic and diagnostic implications of the findings. We 
propose the epichaperome as a biomarker to stratify patients for chaperome therapy, such as 
HSP90 inhibitors. This work also provides several ways to measure the epichaperome in 
clinic, that is, a non-invasive imaging assay (PU-PET) for solid tumours, a flow cytometry 
assay based on PU-FITC for liquid tumours and a native protein separation and analysis for 
minute biopsy specimens (isoelectric focusing; NanoPro technique) (b). We also propose 
that HSP90 is a cancer target when integrated into the epichaperome. Thus, HSP90 
inhibitors that are specific for HSP90 when part of the epichaperome would be preferred for 
clinical use. Non-discriminate pharmacological agents that target chaperome members 
regardless of whether they are in the epichaperome or are part of dynamic complexes, such 
as in normal cells, could lead to toxicities and a low therapeutic index. For example, GI and 
ocular toxicities have been associated with some HSP90 inhibitors and not others due to 
chronic HSP90 inhibition in these normal tissues.

of PU-H71 from type 1 and 2 tumours, measured in vivo. Biodistribution of 124I-PU-H71 (a 
124I radiolabelled version of PU-H71) was monitored live in tumour-bearing mice. Each 
mouse bears one xenografted MDA-MB-468 and one ASPC1 tumour, of similar volume, as 
indicated. Following intraveneous (iv) injection of a tracer amount of the 124I-PU-H71 
agent, mice were monitored by micro-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. 
Representative images taken at the indicated times post-injection are shown. Note that 
immediately after injection (1 h timepoint image), the agent is widely and uniformly 
distributed throughout the body and in each tumour. The off rate from type 1 tumours is 
slower compared to type 2 and non-transformed tissues (that is, distinct koff from type 1 
tumours versus type 2 tumours). The image is representative of five individual mice. In an 
independent experiment, radioactivity was measured in a gamma-counter upon mouse 
euthanasia and data were graphed to monitor the time-dependent distribution of PU-H71.

Induction of apoptosis, as demonstrated by the appearance of cleaved PARP (cPARP), is 
however, specific to type 1 tumour cells. β-actin, protein loading control. The HSP90 
biochemical signature of the select cells is shown on the right. The blue arrows indicate the 
close relationship between the growth inhibitory IC50 values and HSP90 function inhibition, 
suggesting that HSP90 inactivation is sufficient to inhibit growth (that is, have a static effect) 
in both type 1 and 2 tumours. In contrast, substantial induction of apoptosis is specific to 
type 1 tumours. Thus, HSP90 is functional in type 2 and is engaged by the HSP90 inhibitors
—the resistance phenotype of type 2 tumours cannot be explained by an inability of the 
HSP90 inhibitor to engage HSP90. Data are representative of two independent experiments.

 Extended Data Figure 10. The apoptotic response profile of a panel of cancer cells following 
HSP90 inhibition is independent of levels of chaperome members, HSP90 client proteins and 
anti-apoptotic molecules, tissue of origin or causal genetic mutations
a, Total levels of the indicated chaperome members, HSP90 client proteins and anti-
apoptotic molecules were analysed by western blot in a panel of pancreatic cancer cells (n = 
12). GAPDH and β-actin, protein loading controls. Protein levels were quantified and 
graphed against the viability of these cells upon HSP90 inhibition. A correlative analysis 
was performed (Pearson’s r, two-tailed). Each data point represents a cell line. PU-FITC 
binding is shown for comparison. b, Correlative analysis of epichaperome abundance, as 
measured by PU-FITC staining, and cell viability upon a 48 h treatment with PU-H71 (1 
μM), as measured by annexin V staining (Pearson’s r, two-tailed). Each data point represents 
a cell line (n = 95); data are the mean from two orthree biological replicates. Cells 
representing pancreatic, gastric, lung, and breast cancers, along with lymphomas and 
leukaemias were chosen for analysis. c, Same as above for the treatment of cancer cells (n = 
12) with three chemically distinct HSP90 inhibitors. d, Same as b, but for each cell line, 
known genetic lesions were added. No specific genetic alteration could be found 
distinguishing the two tumour types; whereas p53-, Ras-, Myc-, HER-, PI3K/AKT-, and 
JAK- cell cycle-related defects were found in tumours that were sensitive to PU-H71, they

members to be rare, with BCP-1 cells only carrying an HSP90AA1 missense mutation 
(P596S). No mutations in HSP90AB1, HSPH1, HSPA8, STIP1 and AHSA1 were reported 
in this large panel of cell lines. These were obtained from the cBioPortal for Cancer
