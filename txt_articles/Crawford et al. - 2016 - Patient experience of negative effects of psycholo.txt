 A number of psychological and pharmacological interventions
have been shown to be effective for the treatment of mental dis-
orders. Although both the effects and side-effects of pharmacological
treatments have been widely investigated,1 there is less information
about negative effects of psychological treatments.2–4 Research
trials of psychological therapies do not monitor or report negative
effects adequately compared with pharmacological trials.5 It is
estimated that between 5 and 10% of people have higher levels of
psychiatric symptoms following psychological treatment than before
they start it,6 but it is not possible to attribute this to the treatment
itself. Very few studies have examined patient experiences of negative
effects of psychological treatments, and those that have, have been
small and restricted to selected groups of patients.7,8
The National Audit of Psychological Therapies is a large-scale
examination of state-funded psychological therapy services for
adults with depression and anxiety in England and Wales.9 The
audit comprises an examination of routine clinical records and a
survey of people using a wide range of primary and secondary care
services to evaluate their performance against agreed standards of
care. We analysed data from the audit to determine the prevalence
of patient-reported negative effects of psychological treatments
and to identify factors that may influence the likelihood that
patients experience these.
Method
Setting and participants
Data for the study were collected as part of the second round of
the audit in 2012–2013. To identify eligible services we contacted
medical directors and chief executives of all National Health
Service (NHS) providers in England and Wales asking them to
submit contact details for the psychological treatment services
they provide. We supplemented this with data from the national
Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme
in England, and contact details of services that participated in
an earlier round of the audit.10 A total of 220 services took part
(approximately 60% of the 350–380 services that we estimate were
eligible to take part in the audit at that time). All those aged 18
years or older who were on the case-load of participating
services and receiving out-patient treatment for anxiety and/or
depression on an agreed census date within the period 1 July
to 31 October 2012 were invited to complete an anonymous
service-user questionnaire that examined people’s experience of
the process and outcomes of treatment. All participants were given
written information about the audit and invited to complete a
paper or web-based questionnaire. Those who opted to complete
a paper version were given a pre-paid envelope to return the
questionnaire directly to the audit team. Demographic data were
not collected from people who did not participate in the survey,
but were available from the audit of clinical records that was
conducted along with the survey.
Main outcome measure and covariates
As part
of
a parallel qualitative study examining
patient
experiences of negative effects of psychological therapies, we
recruited patients who may have had these experiences through
adverts in local newspapers and online fora. Patients who were
interviewed made a distinction between short-lived unsettling
or upsetting experiences that occurred during therapy, and

Background
To make informed choices, patients need information about
negative as well as positive effects of treatments. There is
little information about negative effects of psychological
interventions.
Aims
To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for
perceived negative effects of psychological treatment for
common mental disorders.
Method
Cross-sectional survey of people receiving psychological
treatment from 184 services in England and Wales.
Respondents were asked whether they had experienced
lasting bad effects from the treatment they received.
Results
Of 14 587 respondents, 763 (5.2%) reported experiencing
lasting bad effects. People aged over 65 were less likely to
report such effects and sexual and ethnic minorities were
more likely to report them. People who were unsure what
type of therapy they received were more likely to report
negative effects (odds ratio (OR) = 1.51, 95% CI 1.22–1.87),
and those that stated that they were given enough
information about therapy before it started were less likely to
report them (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.54–0.79).
Conclusions
One in 20 people responding to this survey reported lasting
bad effects from psychological treatment. Clinicians should
discuss the potential for both the positive and negative
effects of therapy before it starts.

 longer-lasting negative effects. Some patients felt the term ‘nega-
tive’ did not properly capture how difficult their experience had
been. Based on these accounts we asked all patients who took part
in the survey to indicate whether they had experienced ‘lasting bad
effects from the treatment’
. People were asked whether they
strongly or slightly agreed with this statement, whether they were
not sure, or slightly or strongly disagreed with it.
The survey also included a series of questions on demographic
factors (age, gender, sexual orientation and ethnicity), type of
therapy received, and the person’s experience of the process of
care. The latter included questions on how long people had to wait
before the start of treatment, the number of sessions they received,
whether they thought they were referred at the right time, whether
the time they waited was reasonable, whether they thought they
had received enough information about treatment before it began
and whether they were asked to give feedback on their progress in
treatment. These items were based on guidelines for delivering
psychological treatments and feedback from an expert group of
service users and providers.
Statistical methods
The primary outcome was a self-report of having experienced
‘lasting bad effects from the treatment’. Having calculated the
prevalence of those who agreed, disagreed or were neutral about
whether they had experienced lasting bad effects from treatment,
this item was converted into a dichotomous variable: whether
people strongly or slightly agreed that they had experienced
lasting bad effects or disagreed or were unsure whether this was
the case. We then examined univariate associations between this
variable and demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity and
sexual orientation) and factors associated with the process of care.
Differences
in
levels
of
self-reported
negative effects
were
examined between those receiving different forms of therapy. A
multivariate analysis of factors associated with the likelihood of
having experienced negative effects of therapy was subsequently
conducted. To restrict the number of factors in this analysis, only
variables showing some evidence of an association with the
outcome in the univariate analysis (P50.1) were included in
the multivariate analysis. A backwards selection procedure was
used to retain only the statistically significant variables.
A feature of the data was that patients were clustered within
different services. Outcomes from patients from the same service
may be more similar than outcomes from patients from different
services. Therefore, to allow for this data structure, and the
dichotomous nature of the outcome, all analysis was performed
using multilevel logistic regression. Two-level models were used
with patients nested within services. The analyses were implemented
using the software package Stata (version 12.1).
Results
Of 220 psychological treatment services that took part in the
audit, 184 (83.6%) collected data for the patient survey. Patient
questionnaires were sent out to 76 950 people who were either
receiving therapy or had recently completed it and 15 078
(19.6%) responded. Returns from ineligible patients who were
aged under 18 or had not started therapy at the time of the survey
were removed and data from 14 587 (19.0%) were included in this
analysis. Characteristics of those who took part in the study are
presented in Table 1 together with aggregate data from the audit
of clinical records of people using the 220 treatment services
during this period. Types of therapy received by patients are listed
in Table 2. Among the 14 384 who provided information on the
type of therapy they received, the most commonly reported
treatment was cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT, n= 7 340,
51.03%). Whereas most people reported receiving one therapy,
1208 (8.40%) reported receiving two or more, usually a low-
intensity psychological treatment together with CBT, and 163
(1.13%) reported receiving three or more therapies. Most people
received individual therapy, but 66 (4.59%) reported receiving
group-based treatment either
alone or combined with an
individual therapy. A minority of patients indicated that they
received another type of therapy not featured in the list they were
presented with (n = 563, 3.77%) or reported that they were unsure
what type of therapy they received (n = 161, 1.11%).
Regarding treatment process, most people were referred to
treatment by a family doctor or other healthcare professional,
but 2041 (15.66%) referred themselves to the service (Table 3).
Most people were seen by a therapist within 3 months of referral
to the service (n = 10 114, 73.33%), and received fewer than 10
sessions of treatment (n = 10 229, 74.35%). Patient views about
the process of treatment they received are presented in Table 4;
most patients reported being referred at the right time, being
offered the right number of sessions and being given sufficient
information about treatment before it started.
Of 14 270 people who provided information about the impact
of therapy, 763 (5.23%, 95% CI 4.88–5.60) strongly or slightly
agreed that it had resulted in lasting bad effects, and an additional

 Crawford et al
1099 (7.70%, 95 CI 7.27–8.15) reported that they were unsure
whether therapy had resulted in lasting bad effects. Relationships
between demographic factors, type of therapy, process of care and
the likelihood of reporting lasting bad effects taking into account
clustering by service, are presented in Tables 2–5.
In the multivariate analysis, factors associated with the
likelihood of negative effects included some patient characteristics,
types of therapy and aspects of the process of care (Table 6).
Likelihood of reporting lasting bad effects of therapy was
associated with receiving ‘other’ forms of treatment or being
unsure what type of therapy the person had received.
Discussion
Data from almost 15 000 people receiving psychological treatment
for anxiety and depression in England in Wales suggest that about
1 in 20 think that it had a lasting bad effect. The likelihood of

 Patient experience of negative effects of psychological treatment
patients reporting bad effects from treatment varied according
to both demographic and clinical factors. People over the age
of 65 were less likely to report negative effects than younger
patients. People from Black and minority ethnic groups and
non-heterosexuals were more likely to report such problems.
Patients were less likely to report lasting bad effects of treatment
if they felt they had been given sufficient information about
therapy before it started. Whereas the results of the multilevel
univariate analysis suggested different levels of patient experience
of bad effects among different types of therapy, multivariate
analysis suggested that it is only those offered ‘other’ therapies
or those who were unsure what type of therapy they received that
were more likely to report this type of negative experience.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of the study are that it is based on a large sample
recruited from a broad geographical spread of services that
included a wide variation of treatment modalities and settings.
Our primary outcome was based on a question that was developed
following in-depth interviews with patients who reported negative
experiences of psychological treatments. However, the study has a
number of limitations that need be taken into account when
considering the results. These include a low response rate to the
survey and a reliance on patient recall of information about the
type and duration of treatment that they received. Although we
do not have demographic data from those who did not respond
to the survey, comparative data from the case-note audit suggests
that the response rate may have been different in different groups
of patients. Nonetheless, differences in the proportion of patients
in different age groups and from different ethnic backgrounds
who reported experiencing negative effects are greater than
differences in the proportion of people from these groups who
responded to the survey. Another limitation is we do not have
information about diagnoses or other clinical details. Previous
studies examining outcomes of in-patient mental healthcare

 Crawford et al
indicate that people with some conditions, such as somatoform or
personality disorders, may be more likely to deteriorate during
treatment than others.11 Qualitative data about negative effects
were not collected in the survey, but data from an ongoing analysis
of in-depth interviews of people who report these experiences
suggest that these include exacerbations of existing symptoms
and emergence of new ones including anxiety, anger and loss of
self-esteem. Finally, it is important to note that survey data were
collected from people who were in treatment or had recently
completed it and we do not know the extent to which these
negative experiences subsequently resolved. However, even when
negative experiences do not turn out to be lasting, they are
unpleasant for the patient and have the potential to erode the
patient’s confidence in the therapist or therapy process and limit
further engagement with the treatment.
Implications
A substantial minority of patients who responded to the survey
reported that they experienced lasting bad effects from their
treatment. To give informed consent to treatment it is important
that patients are informed about possible costs and benefits.12
Although far more people reported beneficial effects than reported
harm, it is important that people being referred to psychological
therapy services are informed that a minority of people experience
negative effects from treatment. With well over a million people
receiving psychological treatment for common mental disorders
in England alone over recent years,13 these data imply that many
thousands of patients could have experienced negative effects from
treatment. Our finding that people who did not know what type
of therapy they received or stated that they were not given enough
information about treatment before it started were more likely
to report lasting bad effects is noteworthy. It is possible that
people who were properly informed about treatment before it
started had a better sense of what was involved and more realistic
expectations of what it might achieve.
The finding that ethnic and sexual minority groups are more
likely to report negative effects is of concern. Although available
evidence suggests psychological therapies are at least as effective
among people from minority ethnic groups as they are among
White patients in Western countries,14 we are not aware of any
previous research that has examined the likelihood of negative
effects. Previous reports have highlighted the role that attitudes
to homosexuality can have on patient experience of psychological
therapies among gay people.15 Our findings may indicate a need
to place greater emphasis on the development of therapists’
cultural competence during initial training and subsequent
professional development activities.16
There is some evidence that helping therapists become aware
of poor response to treatment can help avoid negative treatment
outcomes.17,18 More research is needed to establish whether this
can reduce the incidence of negative experiences of treatment
and it is clearly important for therapists and patients to discuss
both the positive and negative effects of treatment during therapy.
Future research should also include longitudinal studies that
examine the course of negative effects of treatment and what
can be done to help people who experience them.
Meanwhile,
clinicians
delivering
psychological
therapies
should
ensure
that
people
feel
that
they
have
sufficient
information about treatment before it starts and obtain informed
consent to treatment by ensuring that people considering
psychological treatment for their condition are aware that there
is the potential for both positive and negative effects.

Night Visit
Ann Lilian Jay
Four a.m.
Hunting for a dairy farm
somewhere up there, where
the windmills scrape the sky,
red kite hover.
Headlights scatter, lose themselves,
fog rolls down the windscreen,
trees lurch from the shadows.
Nothing stirs. Only a dog barking at a fox
and ghosts.
Signs summon me to unreadable villages.
Gaps in the hedge inch by
sheep whispering at
stubs of grass crooked with cold.
Pale light filters around the edges of blinds,
sidles nervously through an open door.
A work hardened hand clutches mine.
‘Diolch am ddod bach.
It’s really bad this time.’
