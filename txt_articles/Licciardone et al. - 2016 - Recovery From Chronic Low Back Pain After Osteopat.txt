Manipulative Treatment: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Context: Little is known about recovery after spinal manipulation in patients with 
low back pain (LBP). 
Objective: To assess recovery from chronic LBP after a short regimen of osteo-
pathic manipulative treatment (OMT) in a responder analysis of the OSTEOPAThic 
 
Health outcomes In Chronic low back pain (OSTEOPATHIC) Trial.
Methods: A randomized double-blind, sham-controlled trial was conducted to 
determine the efficacy of 6 OMT sessions over 8 weeks. Recovery was assessed 
at week 12 using a composite measure of pain recovery (10 mm or less on a 100-mm 
visual analog scale) and functional recovery (2 or less on the Roland-Morris 
Disability Questionnaire for back-specific functioning). The RRs and numbers-
needed-to-treat (NNTs) for recovery with OMT were measured, and corresponding 
cumulative distribution functions were plotted according to baseline LBP intensity 
and back-specific functioning. Multiple logistic regression was used to compute 
the OR for recovery with OMT while simultaneously controlling for potential con-
founders. Sensitivity analyses were performed to corroborate the primary results.
Results: There were 345 patients who met neither of the recovery criteria at base-
line in the primary analyses and 433 patients who met neither or only 1 of these 
criteria in the sensitivity analyses. There was a large treatment effect for recovery 
with OMT (RR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.31-4.24; P=.003), which was associated with a 
clinically relevant NNT (8.9; 95% CI, 5.4-25.5). This significant finding persisted 
after adjustment for potential confounders (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.43-5.97; P=.003). 
There was also a significant interaction effect between OMT and comorbid de-
pression (P=.02), indicating that patients without depression were more likely 
to recover from chronic LBP with OMT (RR, 3.21; 95% CI, 1.59-6.50; P<.001) 
(NNT, 6.5; 95% CI, 4.2-14.5). The cumulative distribution functions demonstrated 
optimal RR and NNT responses in patients with moderate to severe levels of 
 
LBP intensity and back-specific dysfunction at baseline. Similar results were 
 
observed in the sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions: The OMT regimen was associated with significant and clini-
cally relevant measures for recovery from chronic LBP. A trial of OMT may be 
useful before progressing to other more costly or invasive interventions in the 
medical management of patients with chronic LBP. (ClinicalTrials.gov number 
NCT00315120)

institutional review board at the University of North Texas 
Health Science Center, and overseen by an independent 
data and safety monitoring board. The trial was registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00315120). 
 
Patients were randomly allocated by computer- 
generated pseudorandom numbers to OMT or sham 
OMT within a 2×2 factorial design. The second factor 
studied was ultrasound therapy, which was found to be 
nonefficacious and to not have statistical interaction with 
OMT. Randomization in blocks of 24 was used to 
achieve a balanced number of patients in the OMT and 
sham OMT groups. Patient assignments were conveyed 
directly to the OMT and sham OMT providers before the 
first treatment session using consecutively numbered and 
sealed envelopes. Patients and members of the research 
staff who enrolled patients or collected data were blinded 
to treatment assignments. The OMT package9 was deliv-
ered during 15-minute sessions provided by osteopathic 
physicians, fellows, or residents at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 
and 8, and outcomes were assessed at week 12. Sham 
OMT involved hand contact, active and passive range of 
motion, and techniques that simulated OMT but used 
such maneuvers as light touch, improper patient posi-
tioning, purposely misdirected movements, and dimin-
ished force by the treatment provider.9 
Patient-Reported Recovery Measures
Recovery from chronic LBP was determined by a com-
posite measure based on outcomes measured with a 
100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) for LBP intensity and 
the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) for 
back-specific functioning.13 The dual criteria for re-
covery were a VAS score of 10 mm or less and an RMDQ 
score of 2 or less at week 12. These were selected be-
cause of their utility in discriminating between patients 
who considered themselves recovered or not recovered 
from LBP.6 These criteria are also consistent with the 
finding that few patients require complete pain resolution 
or restoration of functioning to consider themselves re-
covered from LBP.5
L
ow back pain (LBP) affects an estimated 632 
million people worldwide and is the leading 
cause of disability.1 Measures of LBP inten-
sity and back-specific functioning are frequently used 
to assess trajectories of LBP,2,3 and they are the 2 core 
outcomes important to researchers, health care profes-
sionals, and patients alike.4 The concept of recovery 
from LBP varies substantially from person to person, 
and researchers often disagree on such basic questions as 
whether to have a common recovery measure for acute 
and chronic LBP.5 Nevertheless, empirical data support 
the use of absolute pain thresholds, below which patients 
may be considered to be recovered from LBP.6 
 
 Little is known about recovery after osteopathic ma-
nipulative treatment (OMT) despite its common use in 
patients with LBP.7 The OSTEOPAThic Health outcomes 
In Chronic low back pain (OSTEOPATHIC) Trial is the 
largest single-site efficacy trial of spinal manipulation for 
chronic LBP, as evidenced by a comparison with 26 trials 
included in a Cochrane Review.8 In that trial, 145 pa-
tients (63%) who received OMT vs 103 patients (46%) 
who received sham OMT reported a minimally impor-
tant change in LBP, and 114 OMT patients (50%) vs 79 
sham OMT patients (35%) reported substantial improve-
ment.9 We report herein the recovery outcomes of pa-
tients who received OMT in the OSTEOPATHIC Trial 
based on a composite measure of LBP intensity and 
back-specific functioning and present the corresponding 
cumulative distribution functions as recently recom-
mended by the National Institutes of Health Task Force 
on Research Standards for Chronic Low Back Pain.10

smoothing has the advantage of more effectively dis-
playing general trends in the data rather than simply 
identifying the maxima and minima for RRs and 
NNTs, respectively. 
 
We used multiple logistic regression17 to compute 
ORs and 95% CIs for recovery with OMT, while control-
ling for patient demographic and LBP characteristics, 
general health and comorbid depression at baseline, 
concurrent medication use for LBP, and adverse events 
during the trial. Sensitivity analyses were performed to 
assess the potential impact of excluding 110 randomized 
patients in the primary analyses because they met at 
 
least 1 of the dual recovery criteria at baseline. In the 
sensitivity analyses, 22 randomized patients who met 
both of the dual recovery criteria were excluded, thereby 
leaving a sample of 433 (95%) of the originally random-
ized patients for analysis. All analyses were based on 
intention to treat, with missing data imputed using the 
last observation carried forward. Data were analyzed 
with SPSS software (version 21; IBM), and Microsoft 
Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corporation) was used to plot 
cumulative distribution functions.
Results
Baseline Patient Characteristics  
and Flow Through the Trial
We assessed 1161 patients for eligibility, and 455 men 
and women aged 21 to 69 years with nonspecific chronic 
LBP of at least 3 months duration were enrolled between 
August 2006 and January 2011 to participate in this 
double-blind, sham-controlled trial in the Dallas-Fort 
Worth metroplex. Of the 455 randomized patients, 
 
230 (51%) were assigned to the OMT group and 225 
(49%) were assigned to the sham OMT group. The pri-
mary analyses conducted herein included 345 of 
 
455 randomized patients (76%) who met neither of the 
dual recovery criteria at baseline (ie, baseline VAS scores 
were greater than 10 mm and RMDQ scores were greater 
than 2). The median age of 345 patients in the primary 
Safety Monitoring 
An independent safety officer reviewed and adjudicated 
all reported adverse events. Serious adverse events 
were defined as deaths, life-threatening situations, 
 
hospitalizations, severe or permanent disability, or 
other important medical events.
Statistical Analysis
The original trial sample size was conditioned upon 
analysis of pre- to posttreatment differences between 
groups on the VAS for LBP intensity. Data were 
 
summarized as median (interquartile range [IQR]) for 
continuous variables, and groups were compared using 
the Mann-Whitney test. The number (%) were used to 
 
summarize categorical variables, and groups were com-
pared using contingency table methods, including 
 
RRs and 95% CIs. The clinical relevance of RRs was 
assessed using guidelines established by the Cochrane 
Back Review Group14: RR<1, negative effect or harm; 
1≤RR<1.25, small effect; 1.25≤RR≤2, medium effect; 
and RR>2, large effect. The numbers-needed-to-treat 
(NNTs) were computed as the reciprocal of the 
 
absolute difference in proportion of patients reporting 
recovery with OMT relative to sham OMT, and 
 
95% CIs were computed using the Wilson score 
method.15 We considered NNTs less than 10 to represent 
clinically relevant treatment effects based on a system-
atic review of clinical trials involving oral analgesics.16
 
We estimated and plotted cumulative distribution 
functions for RRs and NNTs for recovery with OMT. 
Undefined values of RRs or NNTs attributable to 
small cell sizes and division by 0 at the lower ends of 
the cumulative distribution functions were imputed 
using the first defined data point. Numbers-needed-to-
treat in excess of 100 or having negative values were 
assigned a value of 100 (ie, minimal treatment effect). 
The cumulative distribution function plots were 
smoothed by using the moving average of RRs over 
successive 10-mm intervals of baseline VAS scores 
and 3-point intervals of baseline RMDQ scores. Such

analyses was 42 (IQR, 31-52) years and 225 (65%) were 
women. Median baseline scores were 50  (IQR, 34-64) mm 
on the VAS for LBP intensity and 6 (IQR, 4-11) on the 
RMDQ for back-specific functioning. The baseline char-
acteristics of patients in each treatment group were gener-
ally comparable (Table 1). Overall, 14 patients (4%) 
discontinued treatment and another 26 (8%) were lost to 
follow-up. A total of 271 (79%) attended all 6 treatment 
sessions and the week-12 exit visit. Follow-up and treat-
ment adherence measures were similar for patients in 
each treatment group (Figure 1).
Primary Analyses
The median (IQR) reduction in the VAS score for LBP 
intensity over 12 weeks was 20 (2-36) mm in the OMT 
group vs 12 (–5 to 25) mm in the sham OMT group 
(P=.002). The median (IQR) reduction in the RMDQ 
score for back-specific dysfunction was 2 (0-5) in the 
OMT group vs 2 (0-4) in the sham OMT group (P=.66). 
A total of 34 patients in the OMT group (19%) met the 
dual recovery criteria vs 14 in the sham OMT group (8%) 
(RR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.31-4.24; P=.003). This composite 
recovery finding was consistent with a large treatment 
effect with OMT. The maximum RR for recovery with 
OMT was observed in patients with baseline VAS scores 
of 41 mm or less (RR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.36-6.41; P=.003). 
Correspondingly, for back-specific functioning, the 
maximum RR for recovery was observed in patients with 
baseline RMDQ scores of 6 or less (RR, 2.57; 95% CI, 
1.32-5.01; P=.003). However, the cumulative distribu-
tion function plots for RRs for recovery with OMT indi-
cate that large treatment effects were observed in 221 
patients (64%) with baseline VAS scores of 40 mm or 
greater and in 170 patients (49%) with RMDQ scores of 
6 or greater (Figure 2). There was substantially greater 
variability in RR response with the baseline VAS score 
than with the RMDQ score. 
 
The overall NNT for recovery with OMT was 
 
8.9 (95% CI, 5.4-25.5). The NNT minima for recovery 
were observed in the same patient subgroup that 
 
generated the RR maxima (ie, those with baseline VAS 
scores of 41 mm or less and RMDQ scores of 6 or less). 
 
The corresponding NNTs for these patients were 
 
4.5 (95% CI, 2.8-12.9) and 5.5 (95% CI, 3.4-16.4), 
 
respectively. The cumulative distribution function plots 
for recovery with OMT show that clinically relevant 
NNTs were observed in 273 patients (79%) with base-
line VAS scores of 30 or greater, and in 245 patients 
(71%) with RMDQ scores of 4 or greater (Figure 3). 
 
As with RRs, there was greater variability in NNT 
 
response with the baseline V
AS score than with the RMDQ 
score, particularly at the lower end of the cumulative 
baseline LBP intensity distribution.
Multivariate Analyses
Baseline pain intensity was inversely associated with 
recovery from chronic LBP in the multiple logistic re-
gression model that simultaneously adjusted for other 
variables (Table 2). The OR for each incremental mil-
limeter on the VAS for LBP intensity was 0.96 (95% CI, 
0.94-0.98; P<.001). Osteopathic manipulative treat-
ment was the other variable associated with recovery in 
this multivariate regression model (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 
1.43-5.97; P=.003). Neither prescription nor nonpre-
scription medication use for LBP during the trial was 
associated with recovery. There were also significant 
OMT×age (P=.04) and OMT×comorbid depression 
(P=.02) interaction effects. Further analysis revealed 
that OMT was most efficacious in effecting a recovery 
from chronic LBP in the 50- to 69-year-old patient 
 
subgroup (RR, 7.50; 95% CI, 1.00-56.47; P=.03) 
 
(NNT, 6.9; 95% CI, 3.9-39.2) and in patients without 
comorbid depression (RR, 3.21; 95% CI, 1.59-6.50; 
P<.001) (NNT, 6.5; 95% CI, 4.2-14.5). 
Harms
Thirteen patients (7%) in the OMT group and 10 (6%) 
 
in the sham OMT group had adverse events (P=.56). 
Correspondingly, there were 5 patients (3%) and 
 
3 patients (2%), respectively, who had serious adverse

treatment group. The median (IQR) reduction in the VAS 
score for LBP intensity over 12 weeks was 20 (2-32) mm 
in the OMT group vs 10 (–3 to 25) mm in the sham OMT 
group (P=.001). The median (IQR) reduction in the 
RMDQ score for back-specific dysfunction was 2 (0-4) 
in the OMT group vs 2 (0-4) in the sham OMT group 
(P=.76). A total of 51 patients (24%) in the OMT 
 
group met the dual recovery criteria vs 29 (13%) in the 
sham OMT group (RR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.16-2.65; 
P=.007). The RR maxima were observed in patients with 
baseline VAS scores of 67 mm or less (RR, 1.91; 95% CI, 
1.25-2.93; P=.002) and with baseline RMDQ scores 
 
of 10 or less (RR, 1.79; 1.17-2.73; P=.006). The cumula-
tive distribution functions for RRs for recovery with 
events (P=.72). The latter consisted exclusively of hospi-
talizations or other important medical events that were 
not causally related to study interventions. Adverse 
events were not associated with recovery after adjusting 
for potential confounders (Table 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
The median age of 433 patients in the sensitivity analyses 
was 41 (IQR, 29-51) years and 275 (64%) were women. 
Median baseline scores were 46 (IQR, 29-61) mm on the 
VAS for LBP intensity, and 6 (IQR, 3-10) on the RMDQ 
for back-specific functioning. The baseline characteris-
tics (Table 1) and follow-up and treatment adherence 
measures (Figure 1) were similar for patients in each

Figure 2. 
Cumulative distribution functions for the RR for recovery with osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT).  
Data are plotted as the RR for recovery in patients with cumulative baseline scores at or below the indicated 
level. Plots were smoothed by using the moving average of RRs over successive 10-mm intervals of baseline 
visual analog scale (VAS) scores and 3-point intervals of Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) 
scores. Primary analyses included patients with baseline VAS scores greater than 10 and RMDQ scores

Cumulative distribution functions for the number-needed-to-treat for recovery with osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT). 
Data are plotted as the number-needed-to-treat for recovery in patients with cumulative baseline scores at or below the indicated 
level. Plots were smoothed by using the moving average of numbers-needed-to-treat over successive 10-mm intervals of baseline 
visual analog scale (VAS) scores and 3-point intervals of Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) scores. Primary analyses 
included patients with baseline VAS scores greater than 10 and RMDQ scores greater than 2. Sensitivity analyses included 
patients with baseline VAS scores greater than 10 or RMDQ scores greater than 2. The numbers-needed-to-treat (95% CIs)  
were 8.9 (5.4-25.5) in the primary analyses and 9.9 (5.8-36.2) in the sensitivity analyses. Abbreviations: LBP, low back pain;

wide spectrum of patients with chronic LBP regardless 
of demography, baseline LBP and general health, and 
concurrent use of prescription and nonprescription medi-
cation for LBP. Patients with comorbid depression did 
not appear to experience a favorable recovery response 
to OMT in our study. Overall, our findings have impor-
tant implications because chronic LBP is often refractory 
to conventional medical treatment, including invasive 
and costly interventions.18 
 
The large and clinically relevant treatment effects for 
recovery from chronic LBP with OMT observed in the 
current study may have potentially enormous impact at 
the population level. Osteopathic manipulative treatment 
such as that provided by osteopathic physicians in this 
study is safe, particularly when integrated with the med-
ical management of patients in the context of their 
 
history and physical findings.19 The wisdom of restricting 
use of efficacious interventions, such as OMT in this 
study, to osteopathic physicians has been questioned.20 
Allopathic physicians represent an untapped resource in 
combating the large burden of suffering from LBP in 
 
the United States and may potentially integrate basic 
OMT techniques such as those used in the current study 
to treat patients with chronic LBP. Other studies21,22 have 
described how allopathic family medicine physicians 
and internists have learned such basic maneuvers during 
an 18-hour course and subsequently reported greater 
confidence and skills in managing LBP. Perhaps the 
 
transition to a single accreditation system for graduate 
medical education in the United States affords an 
 
opportunity to promote interest and training in OMT 
among allopathic residents and physicians.23
 
To our knowledge, the current study is the first 
major trial to implement the recommendation of the 
National Institutes of Health Task Force on Research 
Standards for Chronic Low Back Pain to report cumu-
lative distribution functions of responses in treatment 
and control groups.10 We extended their recommenda-
tion by using RRs and NNTs as summary measures 
according to baseline levels of LBP intensity and 
OMT exhibited less variability according to baseline 
scores for LBP intensity and back-specific functioning 
than did the corresponding plots in the primary analyses 
(Figure 2). 
 
The overall NNT for recovery with OMT was 
 
9.9 (95% CI, 5.8-36.2). The NNT minima were observed 
in patients with baseline VAS scores of 41 or less 
 
(NNT, 6.0; 95% CI, 3.4-26.3) and with baseline RMDQ 
scores of 6 or less (NNT, 7.1; 95% CI, 4.1-29.9). There 
were virtually no differences between the cumulative 
distribution function plots for NNTs for recovery with 
OMT derived from the primary and sensitivity analyses 
(Figure 3). The cumulative distribution function plots 
 
for recovery with OMT show that clinically relevant 
NNTs were observed in 248 patients (57%) with baseline 
VAS scores of 40 or greater and in 177 patients (41%) 
with RMDQ scores of 6 or greater.
 
In the multivariate analyses, the baseline VAS score 
(OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99; P<.001), the RMDQ 
score (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.98; P=.01), and ciga-
rette smoking (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.92; P=.03) 
were each inversely associated with recovery, whereas 
OMT was directly associated with recovery (OR, 
 
2.36; 95% CI, 1.35-4.14; P=.003) (Table 2). There 
 
was an OMT×comorbid depression interaction effect 
comparable to that observed in the primary analyses. 
Harms of treatment were also comparable to those 
 
reported in the primary analyses.
Discussion
Our findings indicate that one-fifth to one-fourth of 
 
patients receiving OMT may experience improvements 
in both pain intensity and back-specific functioning 
 
consistent with recovery from chronic LBP. These find-
ings represent a large treatment effect as defined by the 
Cochrane Back Review Group.14 Multivariate analyses 
corroborated that OMT was independently associated 
with recovery after adjusting for potential confounders, 
thereby suggesting that our findings are relevant to a

Conclusion
The management of LBP is discordant with published 
clinical practice guidelines.26 Our OMT regimen of 
 
6 sessions over 8 weeks is consistent with guidelines 
such as those established by the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence.27 Our findings indicate 
that such an OMT regimen is more efficacious in 
treating and effecting a recovery from chronic LBP 
than reported in a Cochrane review of spinal manipula-
tion.8 By comparison, large increases in magnetic reso-
nance imaging, epidural steroidal injections, and spinal 
surgery for chronic LBP have not improved patient 
outcomes or disability rates.18 Thus, a trial of OMT 
may be useful before progressing to other more costly 
or invasive interventions in the medical management 
of patients with chronic LBP, particularly in patients 
with moderate to severe levels of pain intensity and 
back-specific dysfunction.

back-specific functioning, and we demonstrated the 
efficiency of such metrics in explaining recovery 
from chronic LBP. The simultaneous use of both mea-
sures, anchored by established guidelines for inter-
preting RRs,14 may help define the clinical relevance 
of NNT outcomes in future trials. The cumulative 
distribution functions suggest that patients with base-
line VAS scores of about 40 mm or greater on a 
100-mm scale for LBP intensity may be targeted for 
optimal OMT response based on RRs, NNTs, and 
numbers at risk for recovery from chronic LBP. On the 
RMDQ, patients with baseline scores of 6 or greater 
may be targeted. 
 
There are potential limitations to this study. The 
use of cumulative distribution functions to measure 
recovery was not specified when the trial was planned 
over a decade ago because such analytical methods 
were not used at that time. These analyses were under-
taken in response to emerging criteria for recovery6 
and recent recommendations for reporting outcomes 
relating to chronic LBP.10 Because we originally ran-
domized patients representing the entire ranges of 
LBP intensity and back-specific functioning scores at 
baseline, we subsequently excluded 110 patients who 
met either recovery criterion at baseline from the pri-
mary analyses herein. Consequently, confounding 
variables may no longer have been distributed at 
random in the remaining 345 patients.24 Nevertheless, 
the efficacy of OMT in effecting a recovery from 
chronic LBP persisted after adjusting for potential 
confounders and in the sensitivity analyses, which 
retained 433 patients. We used the last-observation-
carried-forward method to impute missing data. Al-
though more complex methods for data imputation 
have been previously used in the OSTEOPATHIC 
Trial, they have not yielded materially different re-
sults.9,25 Finally, the data cannot be extrapolated to 
determine if the observed recovery rate with OMT 
would be diminished, maintained, or enhanced over a 
longer period of follow-up.
