Abstract
Study Objectives: The high prevalence of chronic insufficient sleep in the population has been a concern due to the 
associated health and safety risks. We evaluated secular trends in sleep duration over the most recent 14-year period.
Methods: The American Time Use Survey, representative of US residents ≥15 years, was used to investigate trends in self-
reported sleep duration and waking activities for the period 2003–2016 (N = 181 
335 respondents).
Results: Sleep duration increased across survey years both on weekdays (+1.40 min/year) and weekends (+0.83 min/year, 
both p < .0001, adjusted models). This trend was observed in students, employed respondents, and retirees, but not in those unemployed 
or not in the labor force. On workdays, the prevalence of short (≤7 hr), average (>7–9 hr), and long (>9 hr) sleep changed by −0.44% 
per year (p < .0001), −0.03% per year (p = .5515), and +0.48% per year (p < .0001), respectively. The change in sleep duration 
was predominantly explained by respondents retiring earlier in the evening. The percentage of respondents who watched 
TV or read before bed—two prominent waking activities competing with sleep—decreased over the same time period, 
suggesting that portions of the population are increasingly willing to trade time in leisure activities for more sleep. The 
results also suggest that increasing online opportunities to work, learn, bank, shop, and perform administrative tasks from 
home freed up time that likely contributed to increased sleep duration.
Conclusions: The findings indicate first successes in the fight against sleep deficiency. Public health consequences of the 
observed increase in the prevalence of long sleep remain unclear and warrant further investigation.

Statement of Significance
Chronic insufficient sleep in the US population is a concern, and it is unknown whether ongoing campaigns have been 
effective in increasing sleep duration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that sleep duration 
increased in many segments of the US population over the period 2003–2016. The analyses indicate a greater willingness 
of Americans to trade time spent in discretionary activities for more sleep. They also point to additional time provided 
by online opportunities to work, learn, bank, shop, and perform administrative tasks from home as drivers for increased 
sleep time. The wealth of information derived from the American Time Use Survey stresses the importance of tracking 
sleep patterns longitudinally using surveys representative for the US population.

 Introduction
Although more research is needed to understand the range of 
functional benefits of sleep, there is no disputing that it is a daily 
biological imperative. According to Tononi and Cirelli, sleep is the 
price we pay for the brain’s plasticity—its ability to modify its wir-
ing in response to experience [1, 2]. Cognitive performance and 
vigilant attention will decline quickly if wakefulness is extended 
past the typical 16 hr, increasing the risk for errors and accidents 
[3–5]. Experimental studies have demonstrated that both acute 
total and chronic partial sleep restriction in healthy adults are 
associated with physiological changes that can be considered 
precursors of manifest diseases (e.g. decreased insulin sensi-
tivity) [6–10]. These changes provide biological plausibility for a 
causal relationship between chronic insufficient sleep and nega-
tive health outcomes [11]. Accordingly, epidemiological studies 
consistently find associations between habitual short sleep and 
negative health outcomes, including obesity [12, 13], diabetes [13, 
14], hypertension [15], cardiovascular disease [16], declines in cog-
nitive function [17], and all-cause mortality [18, 19].
The relationship between sleep duration and negative health 
outcomes is often found to be U-shaped, with minimal risks 
for 7–8 hr of self-reported sleep duration on weekday nights. 
Although the number of studies providing biological plausibility 
for a causal role of short sleep in the genesis of negative health 
outcomes is considerable, the role of long sleep is less clear [20]. 
Although pathways for how long sleep could induce increased 
morbidity and mortality have been proposed [21], both reverse 
causation and residual confounding are plausible mechanisms 
which would make long sleep merely a surrogate marker of other 
factors (like depression and low socioeconomic status) [22] that 
predispose to these outcomes [23]. Accordingly, the American 
Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and the Sleep Research 
Society (SRS) concluded that “it is uncertain whether sleeping 
more than 9 hr per night is associated with health risk” [20].
The latter statement is based on a review of the literature 
on the effects of sleep duration on cognitive performance and 
health by an expert panel convened by AASM and SRS [20]. Based 
on a modified RAND approach, the experts came to the conclu-
sion and recommendation that “adults should sleep 7 or more 
hours per night on a regular basis to promote optimal health” [24]. 
Despite the apparent benefits of sufficient sleep for cognitive per-
formance, safety, and health, and the recognition that sleep is as 
important for health as a balanced nutrition and regular exercise 
[25], representative surveys suggest that 35%–40% of the adult 
US population report to sleep less than 7 hr on weekday nights, 
whereas ca. 15% report to sleep less than 6 hr [26].
The high prevalence of habitual short sleep and its association 
with morbidity and mortality warrant the identification of risk 
factors for short sleep and interventions to increase sleep dur-
ation in those with insufficient sleep. For example, AASM, SRS, 
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initi-
ated the National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project in 2013, with 
the goal to improve public health by promoting adequate sleep 
[27]. The project website provides a wealth of information geared 
towards the general population related to sleep disorders and 
the importance of adequate sleep for health. At the same time, 
public interest in short sleep and its consequences has clearly 
increased over recent years, and the press is reporting on the 
topic on a regular basis. However, it is unclear whether campaigns 
like the National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project are effective in 
lowering the prevalence of short sleep. It is therefore important 
to investigate secular trends in sleep duration. A further decrease 
in average sleep duration would warrant increased efforts to pro-
mote adequate sleep that go beyond current campaigns.
Although there is some evidence that sleep duration has 
declined in adolescents over recent years, the findings for adult 
sleep duration are less conclusive and vary internationally, with 
both decreases and increases in sleep duration [28–31]. For the 
United States, Knutson et al. investigated trends in the preva-
lence of short sleep between 1975 and 2006 and concluded that 
the increase in the odds of short sleep (defined as <6 hr) over 
the investigated period was significant among full-time work-
ers only [32]. Bin and colleagues compared US time use surveys 
from the years 1985, 1992, 1994, and 2003–2007. They found a 
decline in short sleep duration (≤6 hr) and an increase in long 
sleep duration (>9 hr) from surveys collected before 2000 to sur-
veys collected after 2000, but no notable trend between 2003 
and 2007 [29]. Similar findings were reported by Luckhaupt et al. 
for National Health Interview Survey data collected in 1985 or 
1990 or between 2004 and 2007 [33]. Finally, Youngstedt and col-
leagues investigated secular trends in sleep duration in stud-
ies objectively (actigraphy or polysomnography) assessing sleep 
time that were conducted between 1968 and 2013 [34]. Their 
analyses showed no significant association of sleep duration 
with study year. In conclusion, a systematic investigation of 
secular trends in sleep duration in the United States including 
data from the more recent past is missing but urgently needed.
The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) is representative for 
Americans 15 and older and has been performed annually by 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) since 2003. ATUS respond-
ents report their activities (including sleeping) on a minute-by-
minute basis during a 24 hr period. The goal of this analysis was 
to investigate secular trends in sleep duration over the period 
2003–2016 using ATUS data (N = 181 
335 respondents). This 
extends previous ATUS analyses by Knutson et al. (2003–2006) 
and Bin et al. (2003–2007). The unique structure of ATUS allowed 
us to also investigate secular trends in waking activities, with 
the objective to explain any secular trend in sleep duration.
Methods
ATUS is a federally administered, continuous survey on time 
use in the United States sponsored by the BLS and conducted 
by the U.S. Census Bureau. ATUS covers all residents living in US 
households who are at least 15 years of age, with the exception 
of active military personnel and people residing in institutions 
such as nursing homes and prisons. The major purpose of ATUS 
is to develop nationally representative estimates of how peo-
ple spend their time. It involves a 15–20 min computer-assisted 
telephone interview in which people are asked about how they 
spent their time, with a 1 min resolution, between 04:00 am on 
the previous day and 04:00 am on the interview day (e.g. Sunday 
covers the period from Sunday morning 04:00 am until Monday 
morning 04:00 am), as well as where they were, and whom they 
were with during this time. Details on ATUS survey history, sur-
vey design, data collection procedures, coding, imputation, and 
weighting can be found in the ATUS User’s Guide [35]. The analy-
ses presented in this article are based on 181 
355 respondents 
from the survey years 2003–2016. The number of respondents 
and survey response rates are listed in Table 1.

 Activities are coded using a three-tiered activity classifica-
tion system, with 17 major, or first-tier, categories, each having 
two additional levels (tiers) of detail. By combining activities at 
first-, second, or third-tier level, we generated 41 distinct activi-
ties that captured 99.1% of the 24 hr day (Table 2). This coverage 
ranged from 98.7% in 2010 to 99.4% in 2004. ATUS sleep duration 
estimates and coverage rates were not significantly correlated 
across survey years (r = −0.261; p = .3669). Section 9 of Title 13, 
United States Code, ensures that all respondent and household 
information obtained via ATUS remains confidential. The ATUS 
advance letter also advises designated persons that this is a vol-
untary survey. The US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
approved the survey.
Data analyses
For all analyses presented in this article, ATUS weights and rep-
licate weights were used in SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC) to calculate representative estimates with the SURVEYREG

 procedure using the Balanced Repeated Replication method 
with a Fay coefficient of 0.5 to reflect the factor of 4 in the 
ATUS variance formula (see ATUS User’s Guide [35]). Survey 
year (the main variable of interest) was entered either as a 
categorical or continuous variable (to reflect linear secular 
trends). To investigate whether changes in sleep duration 
across survey years can be observed in short (≤7 hr), normal 
(>7–9 hr), and long (>9 hr) sleepers, we calculated the percent-
age of respondents falling in these categories across survey 
years. We also calculated the percentage of  
respondents fall-
ing in the following 1 hr sleep duration bins across survey 
years: ≤5, >5–6, >6–7, >7–8, >8–9, >9–10, >10–11, and >11 hr. To 
 
investigate whether trends observed in all respondents could 
also be observed separately in employed respondents, full-
time high school students, full-time college or university stu-
dents, retirees, unemployed respondents, and those not in the 
labor force, the analyses were repeated restricting the data to 
these classes of respondents.
For the other categories that were used for model adjust-
ment (age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, presence of spouse 
or unmarried partner, number of household children, educa-
tional attainment, income, multiple job status, region, day of the 
week, and season; see below), we introduced interaction terms 
between each level of a given category (reference coding) and 
survey year (continuous variable) while adjusting for all other 
categories to investigate differences in secular trends in sleep 
duration between the levels of each category. We ran separate 
models for each category and for weekdays and weekends/
holidays.
The following in-depth analyses were restricted to those 
respondent groups that showed a significant increase in sleep 
duration across survey years either on weekdays or weekends 
(or both): employed respondents, full-time students, and retir-
ees. Average duration spent in each of the 40 waking activities 
was calculated for each of the 14 survey years and correlated 
with sleep duration estimates across the same 14 years. Pearson 
correlation coefficients were calculated using Fisher’s z-trans-
formation. p-Values were adjusted for bias.
We used ATUS activity files to investigate secular trends in 
the time respondents went to bed in the evening or got up in the 
morning. Only respondents going to bed on or after 06:00 pm 
and before 04:00 am were included in the “time to bed” analysis. 
Only respondents who were asleep at 04:00 am were included in 
the “time out of bed” analysis. In an effort to capture brief dis-
ruptions of sleep (e.g. for voids), we determined the time of last 
wake up for sleep periods initiated before noon.
To investigate the percentage of respondents who read for 
personal interest or watched TV or movies before bed, and the 
duration of reading or watching in those who participated, 
we determined the first sleep period on or after 06:00 pm and 
investigated whether respondents read for personal interest or 
watched TV/movies immediately before sleep or two activities 
before sleep. Many participants visit the bathroom one more 
time before retiring, so we felt that we needed to include not 
only the last but second to last activity in this analysis. The 
reading category also includes the activity “writing for personal 
interest” (Table 2), which, however, accounted for less than 2% of 
the total time spent in reading or writing. We thus refer to “read-
ing for personal interest” going forward only.
All statistical models were adjusted for age, sex, race/
ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, presence 
of spouse or partner, number of household children, family 
income, employment category, multiple job status, survey 
region, survey day, and season. All confounders were entered 
as categorical variables to allow for nonlinear effects. We used 
effect coding for all variables so that each parameter estimate 
reflected the deviation from the mean of all categories, and 
the intercept reflected the overall mean. We repeated each 
analysis with different reference categories to obtain esti-
mates for all categories. Models on employed respondents 
were restricted to those ≤65 years. Models on high school stu-
dents were restricted to the age range 15–20 years and not 
adjusted for educational attainment, marital status, employ-
ment category, and multiple job status. Models on college 
and university students were not adjusted for educational 
attainment, employment category, and multiple job status. 
Models on retired respondents were restricted to the age 
range ≥65 years and not adjusted for employment category 
and multiple job status.
We used Google Trends to obtain monthly estimates for 
Google searches on the word “sleep” for the United States in the 
period 2004–2017 (data before 2004 were not available). Google 
divides each data point by the total number of searches of the 
geography and time range it represents. The resulting num-
bers are then scaled on a range of 0 to 100 based on a topic’s 
proportion to all searches on all topics. Finally, we used Web 
of Science to search for original research publications with the 
terms “sleep duration” or “sleep time” or “short sleep” or “long 
sleep” in the title for the time frame 2003 to 2016. For each year 
from 2003 to 2016, Google searches, research publications, and 
ATUS sleep duration estimates were averaged. Google searches 
and research publications were then correlated with ATUS sleep 
duration estimates (Pearson’s r). The rationale for this analysis 
was to investigate whether public and professional interest in 
the topic “sleep” was associated with increases in sleep time.
Results
Associations of sociodemographic characteristics 
and sleep duration
Table 3 shows the effects of survey year (linear trend) and 
several sociodemographic characteristics on ATUS sleep dura-
tion estimates for all respondents separately for weekdays 
and weekends/holidays. Sleep duration was longest in the 
18–24 year age bracket, decreased with increasing age, and 
was shortest in the 45–54 year age bracket on weekdays and 
in the 55–64 year age bracket on weekends. Men slept shorter 
than women. Compared with the mean across categories, 
sleep duration was longer in Hispanics, Asians, and Black 
respondents and shorter in white respondents and those clas-
sified as “other race/ethnicity.” Widowed respondents slept 
significantly shorter and respondents never married slept sig-
nificantly longer compared with the mean across marital cat-
egories. Sleep duration was shorter if a spouse or unmarried 
partner was present. It decreased with an increasing number 
of household children. Sleep duration also decreased mono-
tonically with increasing educational attainment. A similar 
trend was found for family income, with shorter sleep in the 
higher income categories. Students and employed respondents 
slept shorter (high school students on weekdays only) while 
retirees, unemployed respondents, and those not in the labor

 force or absent from work slept longer compared with mean 
sleep duration across categories. Those working multiple jobs 
obtained on average 24.2 min less sleep on weekdays and 30.8 
min less sleep on weekends than those not working multiple 
jobs. Sleep duration was significantly longer in the West cen-
sus region on workdays only. Sleep duration showed a decreas-
ing trend across weekdays. It was 20.6 min longer on Mondays 
compared with Fridays. It was 35.9 min shorter on Saturdays 
compared with Sundays. Sleep duration was longest during the 
winter months and shortest during the summer months.
Secular trends in sleep duration
Figure 1 shows trends in sleep duration across survey years for 
all respondents on weekdays and weekends/holidays. Sleep 
duration increased on average by 1.40 min per 24 hr per year 
on weekdays (linear trend; unadjusted model: 1.37 min, 95% CI 
1.11–1.63 min, p < .0001) and by 0.83 min per 24 hr per year on 
weekends (unadjusted model: 0.71 min, 95% CI 0.46–0.97 min, 
p < .0001).
On workdays, the prevalence of short (≤7 hr), average (>7–9 
hr), and long (>9 hr) sleep changed by −0.44% per year (p < .0001), 
−0.03% per year (p = .5515), and +0.48% per year (p < .0001), respec-
tively. Figure 2 shows changes in the size of 8 sleep duration cat-
egories across survey years for all respondents on weekdays. The 
percentage of respondents in the short sleep duration categories 
≤5, >5–6, and >6–7 hr decreased significantly across survey years, 
whereas the percentage of respondents in the long sleep dura-
tion categories >9–10, >10–11, and >11 hr increased significantly 
across survey years. The percentage of respondents in the >7-8 
and >8-9 hr sleep duration categories did not vary systematically 
across survey years. The change was most pronounced in the 
>6–7 hr category (−0.23% per year) and in the >9–10 hr category 
(+0.24% per year), i.e. those categories adjacent to what would be 
considered average or normal sleep duration (>7–9 hr).
These analyses were repeated for weekends and for the sub-
populations employed respondents, full-time high school students, 
full-time college or university students, retirees, unemployed 
respondents, and those not in the labor force (Table 4). Statistically 
significant increasing trends in sleep duration on both weekdays 
and weekends/holidays were found for employed respondents and 
retirees only. College or university students showed a statistically 
significant trend on weekdays only, with the largest linear increase 
in sleep duration among all subgroups (+3.08 min per year). High 
school students showed a statistically significant trend on week-
ends only. In contrast, unemployed respondents and those not 
in the labor force did not show a statistically significant trend in 
sleep duration across survey years. The latter two groups were thus 
excluded from all further in-depth analyses.
Figure 3 shows differences in secular trends in sleep duration 
between the levels of several sociodemographic variables. On 
weekdays, significantly lower increases in sleep duration were 
observed for 65- to 74-year-old respondents (compared with 
15- to 24-year-old respondents; p = .0462) and Hispanic respond-
ents (compared with white respondents; p = .0493). Significantly 
higher increases in sleep duration were observed for the income 
categories $75K–$100K and for respondents with no income data 
available (compared with <$25K; p = .0411 and p = .0225, respec-
tively), for Fridays (compared with Mondays; p = .0373), and for 
spring (compared with winter; p = .0095). On weekends, the only 
significant difference was observed for black respondents who 
showed a decrease in sleep duration across survey years (com-
pared with white respondents; p = .0040).
Figure 4 shows the magnitude of linear trends in the change 
of activity duration across survey years for 40 waking activities 
and sleeping on weekdays and weekends/holidays. On week-
days, the greatest absolute linear change in activity duration 
by far was observed for sleeping (+1.46 min/year), followed by 
watching television and movies (+0.57 min/year). Activities 
with the largest negative linear trends in activity duration 
across survey years included working (−0.62 min/year), read-
ing for personal interest (−0.43 min/year), traveling unrelated 
to work or education (−0.40 min/year), eating and drinking 
(−0.39 min/year), and household management (−0.25 min/year).

 Figure 5 shows correlations between changes in sleep duration 
and changes in the duration of 40 waking activities across survey 
years. On weekdays, the most prominent negative correlations 
were found for travel unrelated to work/education (r = −0.843, 
p < .0001), household management (r = −0.843, p < .0001), eat-
ing and drinking (r = −0.837, p = .0001), housework (r = −0.827, 
p = .0001), and consumer purchases (r = −0.815, p = .0002). On 
weekends/holidays, the most prominent negative correla-
tions were found for reading for personal interest (r = −0.763, 
p = .0009), arts and entertainment (r = −0.728, p = .0022), caring 
for and helping nonhousehold children (r = −0.723, p = .0025), 
caring for nonhousehold adults (r = −0.678, p = .0062), and social-
izing and communicating (r = −0.668, p = .0074).
On weekdays, “time to bed” shifted significantly to earlier bed 
times by 1.1 min/year across survey years, whereas “time out of 
bed” shifted significantly to later wake up times by 0.4 min/year 
(Figure 6). Thus, the change in sleep duration across survey years 
on weekdays can mostly be explained by respondents going to 
bed earlier at night, and to a lesser degree by getting up later in 
the morning (relationship approximately 2:1). On weekends/hol-
idays, “time to bed” shifted significantly to earlier bed times by 
1.1 min/year across survey years, which was comparable to the 
shift observed on weekdays, whereas “time out of bed” showed 
no significant linear trend across survey years.
The percentage of respondents who read for personal inter-
est before bed decreased significantly by 0.24% per year across 
survey years on weekdays and by 0.20% per year on weekends/
holidays, respectively (Figure 7). In those respondents who 
did read, the duration of reading increased significantly on 
weekday nights (+0.57 min/year, p = .0047), but not on week-
end/holiday nights (+0.08 min/year, p = .6979). Similarly, the 
percentage of respondents who watched TV or movies before 
bed decreased significantly by 0.22% per year across survey 
years on weekdays and by 0.11% per year on weekends/holi-
days, respectively. In those respondents who watched TV or 
movies, the duration of watching did not increase on weekday 
nights (+0.23 min/year, p = .0702), but it did increase signifi-
cantly on weekend/holiday nights (+0.45 min/year, p = .0022). 
In employed respondents, work duration decreased nonsignificantly 
by 0.39 min/year across survey years (p = .1913). It was lowest 
during the economic crisis year 2010, but recovered thereafter 
(data not shown).

 Figure 8 illustrates that Google searches for the term 
“sleep,” original research publications with the terms “sleep 
duration” or “sleep time” or “short sleep” or “long sleep” in 
the title, and ATUS sleep time estimates increased in a similar 
fashion over the period 2003–2016. ATUS sleep time esti-
mates were highly correlated with both Google searches for 
 
the term “sleep” and original research publications on sleep 
duration.

 Discussion
Based on time use data representative for the noninstitution-
alized population of the United States 15 years and older, this 
study investigated trends in sleep duration over the period from 
2003 to 2016. In an analysis with all respondents, sleep duration 
increased significantly over this 14 year period on both week-
days and weekends/holidays. This increase in sleep duration was 
observed in both short sleepers (≤7 hr of sleep) and long sleepers 
(>9 hr of sleep), whereas the percentage of participants sleeping 
>7–9 hr showed no linear trend across survey years. Sleep dura-
tion increased across survey years in employed respondents, 
retirees, full-time high school students (weekends/holidays only), 
and full-time college/university students (weekdays only). In 
contrast, no significant secular trend was found for unemployed

times (black lines), 95% confidence intervals (dashed lines), and overall average time across years (gray line) for employed respondents, full-time students, and retirees 
on weekdays (N = 72 
098, upper panels) and weekends/holidays (N = 74 
246, lower panels). Linear trends across survey years are reported in the lower left of each panel. 
On weekdays, the advance in evening bed time was more pronounced than the delay in morning wake-up time (−1.1 min/year vs. +0.4 min/year, respectively). On 
weekends/holidays, evening bed time advanced significantly by −1.1 min/year, but there was no significant change in wake-up time across survey years.

 respondents or those not in the labor force on either weekdays 
or weekends/holidays. The observed increase in sleep duration 
across survey years was predominantly explained by retiring 
earlier and to a lesser degree by getting up later in the morning. 
The latter explains the shift in midsleep times to earlier times on 
weekends observed in analyses also based on the ATUS [36].
Any increase in sleep duration has to be offset by less time spent 
in waking activities. We therefore calculated linear trends across 
survey years for 40 waking activities and also investigated how 
the change across survey years was correlated with the change 
in sleep duration. No other waking activity showed a change of 
similar magnitude across survey years compared with sleeping 
on weekdays. Sleep is a cumulative process, and despite a 1.4 min 
change in 24 hr sleep duration per year sounding unimpressive, it 
can matter greatly [37]. For example, the lowest/highest sleep dura-
tion for employed respondents on weekdays was found in 2004

Figure 7. Changes in the prevalence of reading or writing for personal interest before bed and watching movies and TV before bed over the period 2003–2016. The panels 
show estimates for the mean (black line), 95% confidence intervals (dashed lines), and overall average across years (gray line) for employed respondents, full-time stu-
dents, and retirees on weekdays (N = 72 
098, upper panels) and weekends/holidays (N = 74 
246, lower panels). The prevalence of reading or writing for personal interest 
decreased by 0.24% per year on weekdays and by 0.20% per year on weekends/holidays, whereas the prevalence of watching TV or movies decreased by 0.22% per year 
on weekdays and by 0.11% per year on weekends/holidays (linear trends).

 (8.05 hr) and 2015 (8.37 hr), respectively. This difference translates 
to 83.4 hr (or 3.5 days) more sleep per year just on weekdays.
Time spent reading for personal interest declined significantly 
across survey years, and changes in time spent reading across 
survey years were strongly negatively correlated with increases in 
sleep duration on both weekdays and weekends/holidays. An in-
depth analysis showed that the percentage of participants read-
ing before bed decreased significantly across survey years. This 
suggests that more and more respondents decided not to read 
before bed, contributing to the observed decrease in time spent 
reading and the concomitant increase in sleep duration.
Watching TV and movies was identified earlier as the most 
prominent waking activity in the 2 hr period preceding individual 
bed time [38]. It is therefore the #1 evening candidate activity for 
increasing sleep duration. However, our analyses showed a sig-
nificant increasing trend in time spent watching TV and movies 
across survey years, and changes in watching TV and movies were 
positively correlated with changes in sleep duration across survey 
years. At the same time, an in-depth analysis showed that the per-
centage of participants watching TV or movies before going to bed 
decreased significantly across survey years. As watching TV shows 
or movies on a computer is also coded as watching TV or movies, 
the change in how respondents watched TV or movies across sur-
vey years was likely not responsible for this declining trend. Rather, 
these findings suggest that more and more respondents chose not 
to watch TV or movies at night, likely contributing to the observed 
increase in sleep duration. It also illustrates that changes in activi-
ties that surround the sleep period are more important for sleep 
duration than changes in overall 24 hr activity duration.
Other activities that decreased across survey years and were 
negatively correlated with the change in sleep duration included 
travel time (both related and unrelated to work and education), 
household management, and consumer purchases. This sug-
gests that increasing online opportunities to work, learn, bank, 
shop, and perform administrative tasks from home freed up 
time related to the activity itself or related to traveling to and 
from the site of the activity, and that some of this extra time was 
used for increasing sleep duration.
Several earlier studies identified time spent working as the 
waking activity predominantly exchanged for less sleep [39–41]. 
Although working showed a decreasing linear trend across sur-
vey years in employed respondents in this study, the estimate 
was highly variable. Also, changes in work and sleep time across 
survey years were only moderately negatively correlated. Time 
spent working was lowest during the economic crisis year 2010 
but increased again in the following years. Therefore, despite the 
close association of time spent working and sleeping, it is unlikely 
that changes in work duration can explain the observed increase 
in sleep duration. The fact that a secular trend in sleep dura-
tion was observed for large parts of the population, but did not 
include unemployed respondents and those not in the labor force, 
is a key finding of this study. Long work hours in combination 
with other societal pressures (e.g. caring for household children, 
housework, household management, food and drink preparation) 
decrease the opportunity for sleep. Collectively, our findings sug-
gest that decreases in time spent in activities other than working 
were central for the observed increasing trend in sleep duration 
across survey years. This would also explain why the increas-
ing online opportunities to work, learn, bank, shop, and perform 
administrative tasks from home described above did not translate 
to increases in sleep duration in those groups that are not forced 
to accommodate both work and other societal demands within 
the limits of the 24 hr day (i.e. the unemployed and those not 
in the labor force). Retirees showed the lowest increase in sleep 
duration across survey years compared with employed respond-
ents and students and therefore took an intermediate position 
between employed respondents and students, on the one hand, 
and unemployed respondents and those not in the labor force, on 
the other hand.
Time spent in eating and drinking also decreased signifi-
cantly across survey years and was negatively correlated with 
sleep duration. In a chronic sleep restriction protocol, Spaeth 
and colleagues showed that participants gained weight across 
5 days with only 4 hr sleep opportunity relative to a control group 
with 8 hr sleep opportunity [42]. Interestingly, the additional 
calories were exclusively consumed by the sleep-restricted 
group during times when the control group was sleeping. Our 
analyses suggest a similar phenomenon for ATUS respondents. 
Increasing sleep duration may thus help decrease caloric intake 
by decreasing opportunities for food consumption.

Figure 8. Comparison of internet searches on the topic sleep, published manuscripts on sleep duration, and ATUS sleep time estimates over the period 2003–2016. 
(A) shows (1) a Google Trends analysis of searches for the word “sleep” between 2004 and 2017 for the United States (blue line; each data point is divided by the total 
searches of the geography and time range it represents [based on a query performed on August 31, 2017]; the resulting numbers are then scaled on a range of 0 to 100 
based on a topic’s proportion to all searches on all topics), (2) the number of published original articles with the terms “sleep duration” or “sleep time” or “short sleep” 
or “long sleep” in the title for the time frame 2003 to 2016 (red line; based on a Web of Science Core Collection search performed on August 31, 2017), and (3) the change 
in ATUS sleep duration estimates for all respondents (N = 88 
799) on weekdays over the period 2003 until 2016. (B) and (C) show Pearson correlations of ATUS sleep 
duration estimates with Google searches and the number of published manuscripts, respectively.

 Notably, sleeplessness also increased significantly across sur-
vey years and was positively correlated with the increase in sleep 
duration. Advancing bed time poses a challenge for respondents 
with a late circadian preference and may explain the observed 
increase in sleeplessness to some extent [39, 43]. Similarly, it is 
unclear whether the observed increase in long sleep duration 
across survey years poses a threat to public health. As discussed 
above, the role of long sleep in the genesis of negative health out-
comes is still unclear. Reverse causation and residual confounding 
are plausible mechanisms that could partly explain the long sleep/
negative health relationship, which would make long sleep merely 
a surrogate marker of other factors that predispose to these nega-
tive health outcomes [22, 23]. More research based on prospective 
studies is needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis.
Strengths and limitations
Strength of this study include the timeliness of the data, the 
consistency of the ATUS across survey years, the fact that the 
data are representative for the United States, the large number 
of relevant confounders available for adjustment, and the large 
number of respondents.
The cross-sectional nature of the ATUS and the fact that 
information on secondary activities (performed at the same 
time as the primary activity) was not collected are limitations of 
this study. We had no detailed information on the respondents’ 
health status or on the content of some behaviors (e.g. which 
type and how much alcohol, caffeine, or drugs were consumed) 
that may act as confounders and influence sleep duration. As 
health status is not measured in ATUS (or the Current Population 
Survey [CPS]), our analyses cannot directly show whether and 
how sleep patterns contribute to health disparities.
The ATUS response rate averaged 53.7% across survey 
years (range 46.8%–57.8%, Table 1). A survey conducted by BLS 
and the Census Bureau in early 2004 analyzing responses and 
operations data indicated that the primary reason for refusal 
is survey fatigue: the designated persons are tired of par-
ticipating in the CPS and do not want to respond to another 
survey [35]. The general trend of declining survey response 
rates was also found for the ATUS with a 0.85% decline in 
response rate per year across survey years (linear trend). It 
is therefore possible that the observed trends in sleep dura-
tion can at least partially be explained by secular trends in 
survey nonresponse. However, the complex survey design 
of the ATUS accounts for survey nonresponse by weighing 
participants relative to their likelihood of responding. These 
weights ensure that each group is adequately represented in 
the population.
In ATUS, the following examples are provided in the cod-
ing lexicon for the sleep category (coded as tier 010101): sleep-
ing, falling asleep, dozing off, napping, getting up, waking up, 
dreaming, cat napping, getting some shut eye, and dozing. Some 
of these examples describe rest or transitions in or out of sleep 
rather than sleep itself. Also, the ATUS sleep category covers 
24 hr sleep (including naps), not nighttime sleep or, in case of 
participants working the night shift, the dominant sleep period 
(importantly, a category “sleeplessness” does exist, and thus try-
ing but not being able to fall asleep is not counted as sleep). Thus, 
ATUS sleep time estimates are not directly comparable with 
those derived from a single question asking, e.g. about average 
sleep duration on weekday nights. According to a comparison 
of ATUS sleep time estimates with self-reported sleep time for 
weekdays/workdays from the 2005–2008 National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [26], ATUS sleep time 
exceeded NHANES self-reported sleep time by approximately 
1 hr on average. For the reasons noted above, readers should 
refrain from translating ATUS sleep time estimates to objectively 
assessed sleep time in a 1:1 fashion (even single-question esti-
mates of sleep time have been shown to overestimate physiolog-
ical sleep [44, 45]). However, due to the consistency of the ATUS 
across years, it is unlikely that sleep duration estimates across 
years were systematically biased. Also, as Mattriciani et al. [28] 
point out (p. 319), time use surveys are “arguably more objective 
than asking individuals how long they usually sleep using a sin-
gle question, since participants are blind to the focus on sleep 
and the diary structure applies an external constraint that activi-
ties conducted during a 24 hr day does indeed total 24 hr.”
Finally, due to the cross-sectional nature of the data, the 
findings reflect associations. Some of the potential causal mech-
anisms discussed above warrant further investigation and will 
optimally be based on prospective data gathered using objective 
measures of sleep duration (e.g. actigraphy).
Conclusions
This is the first study to show a significant increase in sleep 
duration over the period 2003–2016 in large parts of the US 
population. This increase was predominantly caused by earlier 
bed times in the evening and to a lesser extent by respondents 
getting up later in the morning. The percentage of respondents 
who watched TV or read before bed—two prominent waking 
activities competing with sleep time—decreased over the same 
time period. This can be interpreted as a sign of increasing will-
ingness in parts of the population to relinquish these popular 
prebed activities to obtain more sleep and may in part be attrib-
uted to educational campaigns, scientific reports of the health 
risks of reduced sleep duration, and the increasing interest in 
sleep loss and its consequences in both the scientific and the 
popular literature—all factors that could have been reflected in 
the increase in Google searches on “sleep,” and in publication of 
more scientific articles on the importance of obtaining adequate 
sleep. Analyses of decreases in waking activities concomitant 
to the increase in sleep duration suggest that increasing online 
opportunities to work, learn, bank, shop, and perform adminis-
trative tasks from home freed up time related to the activities 
themselves and related to traveling to and from the sites of the 
activities, and that some of this extra time was used for increas-
ing sleep duration. The findings presented here suggest that 
we are on the right track for a successful fight against chronic, 
widespread sleep deficiency, even if there is still a long way to go. 
Health consequences of the observed increase in the prevalence 
of long sleep remain unclear and warrant further investigation.
