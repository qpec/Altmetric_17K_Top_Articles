ABSTRACT
Observational studies have reported that black and Hispanic adults receiving maintenance dialysis survive
longer than non–Hispanic white counterparts. Whether there are racial disparities in survival of children with
ESRD is not clear. We compared mortality risk among non–Hispanic black, Hispanic, and non–Hispanic white
children who started RRT between 1995 and 2011 and were followed through 2012. We examined all-cause
mortality using adjusted Cox models. Of 12,123 children included for analysis, 1600 died during the median
follow-up of 7.1 years. Approximately 25% of children were non-Hispanic black, and 26% of children were of
Hispanic ethnicity. Non–Hispanic black children had a 36% higher risk of death (95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 1.21 to 1.52) and Hispanic children had a 34% lower risk of death (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.77) than non–Hispanic
white children. Adjustment for transplant as a time-dependent covariate abolished the higher risk of death in
non–Hispanic black children (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.12) but did not attenuate the finding of a
lower risk of death in Hispanic children (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.68). In conclusion, Hispanic
children had lower mortality than non–Hispanic white children. Non–Hispanic black children had higher mor-
tality than non–Hispanic white children, which was related to differences in access to transplantation by race.
Parity in access to transplantation in children and improvements in strategies to prolong graft survival could
substantially reduce disparities in mortality risk of non–Hispanic black children treated with RRT.

Although black and Hispanic patients generally ex-

black and Hispanic adults treated with maintenance
dialysis (especially hemodialysis) have consistently
been observed to have a lower risk of death
compared with white adults on dialysis.1–10 This ob-

closer examination, the lower risk of death in black

those who are older than 50 years of age and Hispanic
patients of all ages treated with dialysis, but it was not
observed in younger black adults.6,8 Whether there
are differences in survival among black and Hispanic
children compared with white children treated with
RRT in the United States remains unclear.
Racial disparities in access to transplantation
have been previously recognized among children
with ESRD in the United States. Specifically, black
and Hispanic children are less likely to receive de-
ceased donor kidney transplantation, preemptive
transplantation (without first receiving dialysis),
and living donor transplantation.24–27 This racial
disparity in transplantation was not eliminated by
implementation of programs designed to prioritize
transplantation for children, such as Share 35, a
policy that preferentially allocates organs from
young deceased donors (,35 years old) to recipi-
ents ,18 years of age.24,26 It is possible that lower

 access to kidney transplantation in black or Hispanic children
could lead to lower overall survival given that transplantation
is a much more common occurrence in children compared
with adults as a result of their high priority on the transplant
waitlist and confers a survival benefit over dialysis.24,28
A recent European registry study of children treated with
RRT suggested a trend toward lower risk of death in black
children, although few black children were included in the
study, and the observation did not achieve statistical signifi-
cance.29 A prior study using the US Renal Data System
(USRDS) suggested a higher relative risk of death in black
versus white children treated with dialysis,30 but the focus of
this study was not on racial disparities and their potential
explanatory factors. Because children have ready access to
health care, higher priority on the transplant waitlist than
most adults, and fewer comorbid conditions, which may re-
duce the potential for confounding, the study of racial dispar-
ities in the survival of children may be informative to our
overall understanding of differences in mortality outcomes
by race.6,8
The objectives of this study were to determine whether
children who initiate RRT in the United States experience dis-
parities in survival according to race and whether lower access
to transplantation mediates any racial disparities in mortality
risk. We hypothesized that the overall risk of death would be
higher in non–Hispanic black and Hispanic children treated
with RRT, regardless of treatment modality (dialysis or trans-
plantation) and contrary to observations in the adult dialysis
population. We also hypothesized that access to transplanta-
tion would mediate, at least in part, the higher risk of death in
non–Hispanic black or Hispanic children treated with RRT.
RESULTS
Study Cohort
We identified 12,123 black, Hispanic, or non–Hispanic white
children in the USRDS with available race and covariates of
interest at the time of first RRT for inclusion in our study.
There were significant differences in the characteristics of
black, non–Hispanic white, and Hispanic children at the
time of first RRT initiation (Table 1). The median age was
slightly higher in non–Hispanic black children, and there
was a higher prevalence of FSGS as the cause of ESRD among
non–Hispanic black children. In contrast, non–Hispanic
white children had a higher prevalence of congenital anoma-
lies of the kidney and urinary tract as the cause of their ESRD,
and Hispanic children had a higher prevalence of GN (exclud-
ing FSGS) as the cause of their ESRD. Medicaid use was higher
in non–Hispanic black and Hispanic children. Non–Hispanic
black and Hispanic children were more likely obese and re-
ceiving hemodialysis as their initial dialysis modality than
non–Hispanic white children. Non–Hispanic black and His-
panic children were also less likely to receive multiple trans-
plants during the follow-up period.
Association between Race and Mortality
Approximately 13% of the cohort (n=1600) died during 90,374
person-years of follow-up (median follow-up period =7.1 years;
interquartile range, 3.5–11.0). The absolute rate of death dur-
ing the follow-up period was 2.67 per 100 person-years in
non–Hispanic black children, 1.57 per 100 person-years
in non–Hispanic white children, and 1.21 per 100 person-years
in Hispanic children. Non–Hispanic black children were more
likely to die of cardiovascular causes, whereas Hispanic children
were more likely to die of infectious causes (Table 1).
In multivariable analysis, the risk of death was 36% higher
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.21 to 1.52) in black
versus non–Hispanic white children and 34% lower (95%
CI, 0.57 to 0.77) in Hispanic versus non–Hispanic white chil-
dren (Table 2). Adjustment for transplant as a time-dependent
covariate attenuated the higher risk of death in black children
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.12) but did not
substantially alter the lower risk of death in Hispanic children
compared with non–Hispanic white children.
In sensitivity analysis, we examined outcomes according to
the duration of follow-up time attributed to treatment with
dialysis or transplantation separately. Thirty percent of the
total follow-up time of non–Hispanic white children was
spent on dialysis (and 70% with a functioning allograft),
whereas Hispanic children spent 43% of their follow-up
time on dialysis, and non–Hispanic black children spent
56% of their follow-up time on dialysis (Table 3). During
the follow-up period attributed to dialysis, the risk of death
was similar in non–Hispanic black children (HR, 0.96; 95%
CI, 0.85 to 1.09) and 43% lower in Hispanic children (95% CI,
0.48 to 0.67) compared with that of non–Hispanic white chil-
dren (Table 3). During the follow-up duration attributed to
the presence of a functional allograft, the risk of death was not
statistically significantly different in non–Hispanic black chil-
dren (HR, 1.21, 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.61), and the risk was 34%
lower in Hispanic children (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.93) compared
with non–Hispanic white children.
Subgroup Analyses
We examined whether the association of race with mortality
varied according to characteristics of interest, including initial
RRT modality. Approximately 75% of individuals (n=9152)
received at least one kidney transplant, and 1690 children re-
ceived preemptive transplants, of whom only 8.4% were in
non–Hispanic black children and 15.9% were in Hispanic
children. Although the interaction between race and initial
treatment modality (preemptive transplant, hemodialysis, or
peritoneal dialysis) was not statistically significant (P.0.05),
we examined the subgroup that initiated RRT with dialysis to
ensure that the lower survival among non–Hispanic black
children was not mediated entirely by lower access to preemp-
tive transplantation. The results were similar to those of the
primary analysis, with an HR of 1.27 (95% CI, 1.12 to 1.42) for
death in non–Hispanic black children compared with non–
Hispanic white children who did not receive preemptive

 transplants and a HR of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.72) for
Hispanic children (Table 2).
In additional subgroup analysis, we also did not find a statis-
ticallysignificantinteractionbyage(asacontinuousorcategorical
variable), body mass index (BMI) category, cause of ESRD, in-
surance status, or calendar year of dialysis initiation (before or
after 2006) in either non–Hispanic blackorHispanicchildren (all
P.0.05). We did find geographic variations in the risk of death
among black (P,0.01 for interaction between black race and
residence in the south) but not Hispanic children. Whereas the
risk of death was statistically significantly higher in non–
Hispanic black children in the west (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.17 to
2.40), Midwest (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.66), and northeast
(HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.43 to 2.87) census tracts, the risk of death
was not significantly higher in the south (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.98
to 1.36). There was no interaction between geographic region of
residence and Hispanic race (all P.0.05), such that the risk of
death was consistently lower in Hispanic children compared
with non–Hispanic white children across all regions of the
United States.

 DISCUSSION
Black and Hispanic adults treated with dialysis have been shown to
have longer survival compared with non–Hispanic white adults,
despite potential adverse social and socioeconomic positions that
may predispose to poorer health outcomes, including lower access
to transplantation.8–11,24,26,29,31–33 Although studies in the pedi-
atric population have also shown marked disparities in access to
transplantation in non–Hispanic black and Hispanic children
and worsened graft survival in non–Hispanic black chil-
dren,24,26,29,34 our study is novel in its focus on the risk of death
by race and ethnicity in children treated with dialysis and trans-
plantation using data from a large United States cohort. We
found that the risk of death was significantly higher in non–
Hispanic black children beginning RRT compared with non–
Hispanic white children but that access to transplantation
seemed to mediate the differential risk of mortality. However,
Hispanic children had a consistent survival advantage com-
pared with non–Hispanic white children, despite their known
lower access to transplantation.24 This finding was contrary to
our hypothesis but is consistent with the better survival that has
been observed in Hispanic adults treated with RRT. These ob-
servations were consistent across all subgroups of interest that
were examined in our study, including age, BMI category, cause
of ESRD, calendar year, and treatment modality.
Our study highlights the important contribution of trans-
plantation to the inequities in survival of non–Hispanic black
children with ESRD. There was a higher overall relative risk of
death in non–Hispanic black (versus non–Hispanic white)
children during the full duration of follow-up in our study,
which was attenuated from 1.36 to 0.99 with adjustment for
transplant as a time-dependent covariate. Furthermore, non–
Hispanic black children spent the least amount of follow-up
time with a functional allograft (44% in non–Hispanic black
children versus 70% for non–Hispanic white children and
57% for Hispanic children). When we examined the risk of
death in children in analyses separated according to time at-
tributed to dialysis or transplant, we did not find a statistically
significant difference in the risk of death of non–Hispanic
black versus non–Hispanic white children, suggesting that
black and non–Hispanic white children fare similarly on di-
alysis or with transplant, contrary to our hypothesis. These
results suggest that the lower access to transplantation in non–
Hispanic black children and conversely, better survival con-
ferred by higher access to transplantation in non–Hispanic
white children24 are the major explanations for our findings.
This is consistent with the fact that the risk of death was not
higher in non–Hispanic black versus non–Hispanic white
children in the south, where many states have shorter than
average wait times and a higher number of pediatric–quality
cadaveric kidneys per pediatric candidate.34 Our results
suggest that substantial improvements in the parity of mor-
tality outcomes by race may be possible with the adoption of
additional strategies to equalize access to kidney transplanta-
tion in non–Hispanic black children and improve allograft
survival among those who do receive transplants.34 The extent
to which racial disparities in access to kidney transplantation
persist under the new organ allocation system should be ex-
amined in the near future when data become available.
Prior studies in the adult dialysis population have noted the
importance of age as a determinant of the presence or absence of
an observed survival advantage for black patients.6,8,33,35 In par-
ticular, younger black adults ,50 years of age have been ob-
served to have a similar or higher risk of death compared with
white adults in the same age range, whereas among older pa-
tients on dialysis, the risk of death is lower among blacks.6,8,33,35
Several reasons have been postulated for the variation in survival
rates across the age spectrum, including the presence of greater
inequities in socioeconomic status and access to health care in
younger versus older black adults.6,8 Our data are consistent
with prior reports of the presence of significant effect modifica-
tion by age in black adult patients on dialysis and extend these

 observations to children ,18 years of age, in whom the obser-
vation of better survival in non–Hispanic black children is not
just absent but reversed.6 Given the lower overall burden of
comorbid conditions among children with ESRD (such as di-
abetes, malignancy, or advanced coronary artery disease), this
finding may suggest that differences in the survival of older
adults treated with dialysis could be related to the presence or
severity of such comorbid conditions.
We also observed a consistently lower risk of death in His-
panic children in our study, despite their lower access to trans-
plantation. Although the reasons for the survival advantage of
Hispanic children are unclear, our findings may inform the
likelihoodofprior proposedhypothesesforthesurvivaladvan-
tage of adult Hispanic patients with ESRD. Some studies have
suggested that the longer survival of Hispanic patients may be
due to lower burden of atherosclerotic disease at the time of
ESRDonsetintheHispanicpopulation.36,37,38However,inour
study, Hispanic children did not have a statistically signifi-
cantly higher risk of cardiovascular-related death, and
children are generally less likely than adults to die of atheroscle-
rotic disease given the duration of time needed for such disease to
develop. Because the overall survival of children with ESRD is
higher compared with that of adults with ESRD,39 the likelihood
of survivor bias would be low in a pediatric ESRD cohort. Other
hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the survival
advantage ofHispanic patients treated with dialysishave included
the salmon bias and the healthy migrant hypothesis, where sicker
migrants may return to their country of origin and therefore,
their deaths may not be accounted for in studies, whereas health-
ier migrants tend to immigrate to the United States and contrib-
ute to the better survival of Hispanic patients.40 However, given
that our study focuses on children who are more likely to have
been born in the United States and stay in this country, the
salmon bias and the healthy migrant hypothesis seem less plau-
sible as explanations for the observed Hispanic survival advan-
tage in children.
The strengths of our study include the large size of the co-
hort, the contemporary nature of the data, and a relatively large
number of clinical outcomes, particularly given the relative
youth of our cohort members. Limitations include the obser-
vational nature of these data, potential errors in data used for
determination of race and misclassification of ethnicity, and
missing data in the USRDS, which may have caused some mis-
classification of transplant status or excluded some children
from our study. We do note that there are racial differences in
the most common causes of ESRD in children, which may
contributetosomeoftheobservedracialdifferencesinsurvival
ofchildren,althoughwehaveadjusted forcauseofESRDinour
models. However, it is possible that residual confounding may
be present, despite our adjustment for important potential
confounders.
In conclusion, we observed a significantly higher risk of
death in non–Hispanic black versus non–Hispanic white chil-
dren initiated on RRT over the last two decades that seems
mediated by differences in access to kidney transplant. In
contrast, we noted a significantly lower risk of death in His-
panic children treated with RRT that was independent of age,
BMI, cause of ESRD, geographic location, or treatment mo-
dality. Our study suggests a critical need to develop strategies
to ensure parity in access to transplantation for non–Hispanic
black children with ESRD and the need for additional studies
to understand the reasons for the survival advantage of His-
panic children with ESRD.
CONCISE METHODS
Study Population
We performed a retrospective cohort study of children between the
agesof2and19yearsoldwhorequiredtheirfirstRRTbetweenJanuary
1, 1995 and December 31, 2011 using data from the USRDS, the
national ESRD registry. We included only children whose initial onset
ofESRDfellwithinourstudyperioddefinedbyavailabilityofaCenters
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ESRD Medical Evidence
Report (Form CMS-2728-U3) filed within 6 months of the first ESRD
service date (n=14,024) (Figure 1). Children under the age of 2 years
old were excluded, because standards for BMIs are not available for
this age group from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), and BMI was a covariate of interest because of its known
association with the likelihood of transplantation and risk of mortal-
ity in children.4,41 We excluded patients whose forms had missing
BMI (n=442) or missing median income (n=454) (Figure 1).
Predictor and Covariates of Interest
Race was abstracted from the Patient Files in the USRDS, and children
were first categorized by ethnicity (Hispanic versus non-Hispanic).
Subsequently,among thenon-Hispanicchildren,racewascategorized
as non-Hispanic black or non-Hispanic white. If Hispanic ethnicity
was unknown, but race was known, these children were classified
as non–Hispanic black or non–Hispanic white children. We chose

 non–Hispanic white children as the reference comparator in this
study due to the known differences in survival of Hispanic adults
treated with dialysis compared with non–Hispanic white adults. Chil-
dren with unknown or other race were excluded (n=1005).
Patient demographic characteristics (age at incident ESRD, race, and
sex), cause of ESRD, insurance coverage (Medicaid, none, or other) as an
indicatoroflowerincomestatus,zipcode,dateofESRDonset,andBMIat
incident ESRD were abstracted from the CMS-2728 Form (Medical Ev-
idence [MEDEVID]) and Patient Files in the USRDS. BMI values were
age and sex standardized to z scores using the 2000 CDC standards for
United States children.41 We defined underweight as BMI,5th percen-
tileforage(corresponding toa z score ,21.64) andobese asBMI$95th
percentile for age (corresponding to a z score $1.64) according to the
CDC criteria because of a known U–shaped association between BMI
andmortality fromprior studies in childrentreated withRRT.41We used
zip code to determine median household income of patients’ neighbor-
hood using median income values from the American Community Sur-
vey between 2006 and 2010 as a continuous variable.42 Initial ESRD
treatment modality (transplant versus dialysis) was determined at the
first ESRD service date as listed in the MEDEVID File. We determined
the date of transplant procedures using USRDS Patient and Transplant
Files, which contain data reported by transplant centers to the United
Network for Organ Sharing.
Outcome Ascertainment
We abstracted death dates from the USRDS Patient Files and ascertained
deaths up to June 30, 2012. Cause of death was determined from the
USRDSPatientFilesandcategorizedascardiovascular,infectious,orother.

income, calendar year of ESRD onset (to account for potential secular
trends in survival), and BMI category. We did not censor patients at the
time of transplantation in our primary analysis, because transplantation
is expected to improve outcomes and a very common occurrence in
children. To examine whether the association between race and risk of
death was potentially mediated by transplantation, we used the same
multivariable Cox proportional hazards model and further adjusted for
transplant as a time-dependent covariate.
Association between Race and Mortality According to Treat-
ment Modality
Weassessedtheassociationbetweenraceandriskofdeathinsubgroup
analysis among those who were treated with dialysis as the first mo-
dality of RRT. In sensitivity analysis, we repeated our time–dependent
Cox models, partitioning the duration of follow-up to time attributed
to dialysis versus time attributed to the presence of a functional al-
lograft to separately examine the risk of death by treatment modality.
Association between Race and Mortality in Subgroup Analyses
To determine whether racial disparities in survival may be amplified
within particular subgroups, we tested for interactions between race
and prespecified factors of interest, including age (categorized as ,13
versus $13 years old to account for potential differences in mortality
risk in adolescents who may be prone to nonadherence),43 BMI cat-
egory, initial RRT modality, cause of ESRD, and calendar period of
follow-up (before or after 2006 to assess for the potential effect of
Share 35 implementation in September of 2005).24 We also tested for
the presence of interaction by initial treatment modality (hemodial-
ysis versus peritoneal dialysis versus transplant) and insurance status
to examine risk of death. In sensitivity analysis, we also tested for
interaction between race and age as a continuous variable. P values
,0.05 were considered statistically significant for interaction terms.
Finally, because of known variations in transplantation and mor-
tality risk by geographic region in the United States, we performed
stratified analysis of the association between race and mortality by
United States census tracts (using patients’ zip codes).44 We chose to
use these relatively wide geographic divisions to assess any potential
differences in mortality risk by geography, because some states may
not have transplant or dialysis centers that treat children with RRT
and given the likelihood that some children may travel to different
states to receive pediatric subspecialty care.45,46
With the exception of conversion of BMI into standardized BMI z
scores, which was performed using a Statistical Analysis System Tool
provided by the CDC,45 all data analyses were conducted using Stata 13.
