ABSTRACT
Objective: The incidence of depression is significantly compounded by obesity. Obesity arising from excessive intake of high-fat food provokes
anxiodepressive behavior and elicits molecular adaptations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region well-implicated in the hedonic deficits
associated with depression and in the control of food-motivated behavior. To determine the etiology of diet-induced depression, we studied the
impact of different dietary lipids on anxiodepressive behavior and metabolic and immune outcomes and the contribution of NAc immune activity.
Methods: Adult C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to isocaloric high-fat/high-sucrose diets (HFD), enriched in either saturated or monounsaturated
fat, or a control low-fat diet (LFD). Metabolic responses, anxiodepressive behavior, and plasma and NAc inflammatory markers were assessed
after 12 weeks. In separate experiments, an adenoviral construct inhibiting IKKb, an upstream component of the nuclear factor kappa-b (NFkB)
pathway, was a priori injected into the NAc.
Results: Both HFDs resulted in obesity and hyperleptinemia; however, the saturated HFD uniquely triggered anxiety-like behavior, behavioral
despair, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, peripheral inflammation, and multiple pro-inflammatory signs in the NAc, including reactive
gliosis, increased expression of cytokines, antigen-presenting markers and NFlB transcriptional activity. Selective NAc IKKb inhibition reversed
the upregulated expression of inflammatory markers, prevented anxiodepressive behavior and blunted compulsive sucrose-seeking in mice fed
the saturated HFD.
Conclusions: Metabolic inflammation and NFlB-mediated neuroinflammatory responses in the NAc contribute to the expression of anx-
iodepressive behavior and heightened food cravings caused by a diet high in saturated fat and sugar.

1. INTRODUCTION
Obesity considerably elevates the odds of developing depression [1].
Depressed mood not only affects psychological well-being but also
considerably increases the risks of obesity complications and di-
minishes adherence to treatment strategies. In turn, higher body mass
index in depressed individuals is associated with poorer prognosis [2].
Obesity in humans and murine models is characterized by a state of
chronic low-grade inflammation including elevated circulating in-
flammatory cytokines, adipokines and triglycerides [3]. Several lines of
evidence implicate a neuroimmune etiology in a subset of depressed
individuals; thus, persistent immune activation in obesity may give rise
to mood impairments. Indeed, an elevation in plasma levels of the
inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP), which correlates with
depressive symptoms [4e6], is one of the best predictors of
depression onset in obese individuals [6]. Moreover, increased brain
expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b) [7e9], tumor-necrosis factor
(TNF) [8,10], and interferon-gamma (IFN-g) [10], characteristic of
rodent models of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like

 behavior [7e10], is also evident in mice consuming a high-fat diet
(HFD) [11,12].
As a neuroanatomical substrate integrating signals from diverse in-
puts, several lines of evidence highlight a major role for the nucleus
accumbens (NAc) in the control of motivation and reward-seeking
[13,14], the response to stress [15], and the regulation of anx-
iodepressive behavior [16,17]. Anhedonia and motivational deficits are
key symptoms of depression that are well-tied to neuroplastic changes
in the NAc [18]. We previously found that prolonged high-fat feeding
resulting in diet-induced obesity (DIO) elicits anxiodepressive behavior
and NAc molecular adaptations that correlate with the extent of
behavioral despair [19]. Dietary-derived changes in the NAc may also
underlie enhanced palatable food-seeking exhibited by obese in-
dividuals and rodent models of obesity [18e20]. Indeed, as a means to
offset the negative emotional state, depressed mood can stimulate
food cravings [18,20] and thereby enable a detrimental cycle whereby
caloric overload intensifies metabolic disturbances and strengthens
risk of depression comorbidity.
Obese individuals characterized as ‘metabolically healthy’ (without
hypertriglyceridemia, inflammation, insulin resistance) do not present
with increased risk of depression [21]. Likewise, the anxiogenic effects
of a HFD are absent in conditions that preclude obesity and associated
metabolic impairments in rodents [22,23]. Dietary fats can have
distinct metabolic, endocrine, and behavioral effects according to their
predominant lipid class. In contrast to monounsaturated lipids, excess
intake of saturated fat is tied to greater metabolic dysfunction that
includes increased visceral fat accumulation and peripheral inflam-
mation [23e25,49]. Consistently, depressive symptoms are positively
associated with total and saturated fat consumption while inversely
correlated with monounsaturated fat intake [26]. Along these lines, we
demonstrated that a saturated, but not a monounsaturated, HFD blunts
NAc dopaminergic tone and function [27] and perturbs hypothalamo-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity in rats [23]; however, the mecha-
nisms mediating saturated fat intake and neurobehavioral impairments
are unknown.
Consuming a HFD can elicit immune activation in hypothalamus and
hippocampus in rodents [11,12,28e30] whereas human obesity is
associated with signs of hypothalamic gliosis and injury [11]. It re-
mains to be elucidated however, if excessive dietary fat can stimulate
immune activity in the NAc to gives rise to mood impairments. Given
the involvement of the NAc in the hedonic deficits associated with
mood disorders [18], as well as its vulnerability to neural adaptations
following high-fat feeding [19], the present study sought to identify
neuroinflammatory responses in the NAc and determine if they un-
derlie anxiodepressive behavior provoked by DIO. We investigated the
impact of two isocaloric HFDs, enriched either in palm oil (saturated) or
olive oil (monounsaturated), on energy metabolism, immune activation,
and anxiodepressive behavior in mice. A secondary objective was to
determine if neuroinflammation propagated by the inhibitor of nuclear
factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKKb)-NFlB pathway e a tran-
scription factor playing a key role in driving cytokine gene expression
[31] - contributes to anxiodepressive behavior and palatable food-
seeking elicited by a HFD. Contrary to the largely protective effect of
the monounsaturated HFD, we found a saturated HFD enhances weight
gain, metabolic complications, systemic inflammation, and anxiety-like
and despair responses in behavioral tests. Concurrently, the saturated
HFD was found to increase the expression of several immune markers,
trigger reactive gliosis, and stimulate NFlB transcriptional activity in
the NAc. Exposing a functional role of NAc NFlB in obesity-induced
anxiodepressive and food-motivated behavior, viral-mediated inhibi-
tion of IKKb/NFlB in the NAc prevented neuroinflammation and
anxiodepressive behavior and suppressed cue-induced compulsive
sucrose-seeking in mice fed the saturated HFD.
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1. Animals and diets
All procedures involving the use of animals were approved by the
CRCHUM Animal Care Committee in accordance with Canadian Council
on Animal Care guidelines. Male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory,
Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and NFlB-LacZ reporter mice [32] (C57BL/6
background; in-house colony) were housed in a reverse 12 h lighte
dark cycle (lights off at 10 AM) with ad libitum access to water and
food. Colony-derived heterozygous NFlB-LacZ reporter mice and
wildtype littermates were weaned at P21-23 and genotyped as
described [32].
Beginning at 8 weeks of age, singly-housed (for food intake measures)
or group-housed (2e4/cage; for all remaining experiments) mice were
given free access to one of three custom, ingredient-matched diets
(Table 1; Dyets, Bethlehem, PA, USA) described in detail previously
[27]: a 50% kcal palm oil saturated high-fat diet (“Palm”), an isocaloric
50% kcal olive oil monounsaturated high-fat diet (“Olive”) or a 16.8%
kcal soybean oil low-fat diet (“Control”). Eight cohorts of adult male
C57BL/6 wildtype and NFLB-LacZ colony mice were employed to
investigate the metabolic, behavioral, and biochemical consequences
of each diet as described in supporting information. All measures were
taken after 12 weeks on the diets.
2.2. Metabolic profiling
Mice from each of the three diet conditions (n ¼ 8/group) were fasted
overnight for basal blood glucose measurements. For oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT), mice were fasted overnight followed by oral
gavage of dextrose (2 g/kg of body weight). For intraperitoneal insulin
tolerance tests (ITT), food was removed from the cage at 9 AM for 4 h
fasting prior to intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of insulin. For both OGTT
and ITT, blood glucose was measured at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and
120 min. Body mass composition was measured via Echo MRI and
subcutaneous, perigonadal, and perirenal fat depots were extracted at
Table 1 e Diet composition.

 sacrifice and weighed. Blood was collected from a new cohort of mice
(n ¼ 7e13/group) at the time of sacrifice to measure plasma insulin
(Cedarlane Labs, Burlington, Canada), corticosterone (at circadian
peak; Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA), TNF (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany), IL-1b (Qiagen) and CRP (Life Diagnostics, Inc., West-
Chester, PA, USA) levels via ELISA. Plasma insulin and leptin from
adenovirus treated mice was measured by alpha-ELISA (Perkine
Elmer, MA, USA).
2.3. Behavioral testing
2.3.1. Elevated-plus maze (EPM)
Separate cohorts of mice were used to measure changes in anx-
iodepressive behavior induced by diet and in response to diet � NAc
IKKb/NFlB inhibition. For the EPM test, mice were placed in the center
of an elevated-plus platform composed of two open arms and two
closed arms. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed by quantifying the
proportion of time spent and number of entries in the open arms over a
5-minute trial. Each trial was video recorded and analyzed using the
EthoVision software as described previously [19].
2.3.2. Forced swim test (FST)
Assessment of behavioral despair using the FST was carried out as
described previously [19]. Briefly, mice were placed in a water-filled
glass container for 6 min. The first 2 min of the trial served as
habituation and velocity was measured in order to assess locomotor
capacity. Immobility time during the last 4 min was indicative of
behavioral despair. Each trial was video recorded and analyzed using
the EthoVision software.
2.4. Quantitative PCR
Tissue punches of NAc (core and shell) were obtained from frozen
coronal sections (200 mm) and RNA extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). cDNA was synthetized from 700 ng of total RNA
using random hexamers and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invi-
trogen). Real-time PCR was performed using the Rotor Gene SYBR
Green PCR kit (Qiagen). Primers were designed using BLAST (U.S.
National Library of Medicine) and synthesized by Integrated DNA
Technologies, Inc. based on the sequences listed in Table 2. Data were
extrapolated from standard curves and normalized to the house-
keeping genes (Beta-actin, Cyclophilin or HPRT), which were not
affected by diet (Fig. S1). The most stable housekeeping gene across
experimental groups was selected according to GeNorm and Norm-
Finder algorithms. Mean � standard error of mean values for each
group are expressed in fold changes relative to Control (Figure 3A) or
ControlGFP (Figure 4H) normalized at 1.0.
2.5. Beta-galactosidase histochemistry
Heterozygous NFkB-LacZ mice subjected to the diet protocol (n ¼ 4/
group) were injected with a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital prior to
cardiac perfusion with 30 mL of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline
(PBS), followed by 30 mL of 10% buffered formalin. Following 4 h
immersion in 10% buffered formalin, brains were transferred to 30%
sucrose for 24e48 h. Coronal brain sections (30 mm) containing the
rostro-caudal extent of the NAc were sliced with a microtome (Leica
SM2000R). Free floating slices were washed in PBS and incubated in a
blocking buffer (3% normal goat serum þ 0.1% Triton þ 0.02% PBS-
azide) for 2 h at room temperature. Cell membranes were then per-
meabilized by incubating sections in 0.2% Tween in PBS solution for
9 min and then rinsed with PBS prior to overnight incubation in
blocking solution with a primary polyclonal chicken antibody against
bgal, Ab9361 (1:1000), Abcam (Cambridge, UK) at 4 �C. Following
washes, sections were incubated with an Alexa Fluor� 568 conju-
gated goat anti-chicken IgG antibody (Abcam, 1:1000) for 2 h, at room
temperature. Following washes, sections were mounted onto micro-
scope slides with DAPI aqueous mounting media (Vectashield, Vector
Labs, Burlingham, CA, USA) and visualized (Zeiss AxioImager.M2
ApoTome.2).
2.6. Glia immunostaining
Following the diet protocol, wildtype mice (n ¼ 3/group) were perfused
and brains post-fixed, cryoprotected, and sliced as above. Free-
floating slices (30 mm) were incubated with a primary polyclonal
rabbit antibody against GFAP (Ab5804), Millipore (Darmstadt, Ger-
many) or Iba-1 (019e19741), Wako Chemicals USA (Richmond, VA,
USA) at a dilution of 1:500. Following washes, sections were incubated
with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immu-
noglobulin G antibody provided in Vectastain Elite ABC HRP kit (Vector
Labs) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 2 h at room temperature. Sections
were immersed in avidin/biotin complex solution for 1 min, rinsed with
PBS, and mounted onto microscope slides. Prior to application of
mounting media (Vectashield, Vector Labs) and coverslip, slides were
dehydrated in 95% ethanol solution in PBS and 100% ethanol for 30 s
and 1 min, respectively.
2.6.1. Morphometric analysis of microglia
Images acquired (Zeiss AxioImager.M2 ApoTome.2) were converted to
8-bit using ImageJ. Density, perimeter, maximum ferret, and minimum
ferret for the soma of each microglia (n ¼ 3e4/mouse) were
measured using the “analyze particles” function of ImageJ. Soma ratio
was calculated by dividing the minimum ferret value by the maximum
ferret value, giving an indicator of circularity from 0.00 to 1.00. The
total number of visible processes per cell was counted and the length
of each process was measured as distance from the border of the
soma to the end of the process.
2.7. Viral-mediated inhibition of IKKb/NFkB
2.7.1. Viral construct
Adenoviral constructs consisted of a sequence coding for a dominant
negative mutation of the inhibitor of kappa-B kinase beta subunit
(AdIKKdn) [33] or green fluorescent protein (AdGFP) under the control of a
cytomegalovirus promoter. In view of the modulatory role of NFlB in

 inflammatory gene expression in glia and neurons, a recombinant
adenovirus (serotype 5) was selected to enable high transduction ef-
ficiency and broad host range. Adenoviruses were amplified and pu-
rified by Vector Biolabs (Malvern, PA, USA).
2.7.2. Validation of viral inhibition
Viral titer and placement validation was performed in heterozygous
NFlB-LacZ mice microinjected with AdIKKdn in NAc of right hemi-
sphere and AdGFP in NAc of left hemisphere. Mice were sacrificed 2
weeks after surgery and 6 h following intraperitoneal lipopolysac-
charide (LPS; Escherichia Coli 0127:B8, Millipore Sigma) injection
(500 mg/kg). Coronal NAc slices were subjected to the bgal immu-
nofluorescence protocol to visualize changes in LPS-induced NFlB
transcriptional.
2.7.3. Stereotaxic surgery
Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and placed into a mouse
ultraprecise stereotaxic instrument (Kopf, Inc.) with Bregma and
Lambda in the same horizontal plane. AdIKKdn or AdGFP (0.5mL/side;
3.0 � 107 PFU/side) was delivered bilaterally into the NAc
(AP:þ1.7 mm. ML:�1.1 mm, DV: �4.5 mm, relative to bregma and
skull surface) using a 0.5 mL NeuroSyringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA).
Bearing in mind the observed distinct neurobehavioral impact of the
palm HFD, viral manipulations were carried out in mice submitted to
the palm HFD and control diet, providing four groups: ControlGFP;
ControlIKKdn; PalmGFP and PalmIKKdn. Mice (n ¼ 17e21/group) were
injected with adenoviruses following 8 weeks on their respective diets
and then continued on these diets for an additional 4 weeks post-
surgery before behavioral and biochemical testing. Mice were indi-
vidually housed after surgery.
2.8. Operant conditioning
2.8.1. Sucrose motivation
Training mice to respond for sucrose on a progressive ratio (PR)
schedule was as described [22,34]. Briefly, chow-fed mice were food
restricted to maintain 90% of their body weight and trained daily in an
operant task to press one of two levers to receive a sucrose pellet.
Once stable responding in the PR task was achieved, all mice were
provided ad libitum access to the Control or Palm HFD and subjected to
operant training at least once a week to maintain PR responding. After
8 weeks, baseline breakpoint values were measured over 3 consec-
utive days followed by stereotaxic microinjections of AdIKKdn or AdGFP
adenovirus in to the NAc as described above. Two weeks post-surgery,
ControlGFP, ControlIKKdn, PalmGFP, and PalmIKKdn mice were reintro-
duced into the operant chambers for PR training and testing. Break-
point thresholds (the last response ratio successfully completed)
obtained over 3e5 consecutive days during the 11th week of diet were
used in the analysis. Data are presented as breakpoint values before
(8th week of diet) and after stereotaxic microinjection (11th week).
2.8.2. Conditioned suppression test
To assess compulsive sucrose seeking, we adapted a protocol of cue-
induced suppression of feeding [35] to the operant setting (Figure 5D).
At the end of the operant protocol above, PalmGFP and PalmIKKdn mice
were transitioned from the palm HFD to standard chow, a manipulation
which stimulates craving and food-seeking [22]. Mice were trained to
lever-press for sucrose pellets on a fixed-ratio 5 schedule of rein-
forcement in operant cages equipped with grid floors capable of
delivering electrical current (Med Associates, Inc., St Albans, VT, USA).
During each 30-minute operant session, in the first 10-minute block
the house light was illuminated, in the second 10 min block the house
light was off, and in the last 10-minutes the house light was illumi-
nated. Baseline measures of lever pressing represented the mean of 3
consecutive daily sessions. The conditioning phase consisted of 4
consecutive daily sessions with delivery of a foot-shock paired to the
illuminated house light (1s 0.45 mA/min for 20 min; total of 20
shocks), active lever, and the availability of sucrose reward. On the test
day (Day 5), lever responses were measured under the same condi-
tions except that no foot-shocks were delivered. Data are presented as
the total number of lever-presses per session.
2.9. Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 6 and are presented as
mean � standard error of the mean (SEM). A one-way ANOVA was
used to compare the three diet groups. Viral intervention results were
analysed via 2-way ANOVA (diet � genotype) with Bonferonni post-hoc
as well as differences in sucrose motivation (time � virus). Criterion for
significance was set to p < 0.05 in all comparisons.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Saturated high-fat feeding potentiates metabolic impairments
and inflammation
We first sought to determine the impact of prolonged intake of HFDs
enriched in either palm or olive oil on multiple metabolic endpoints.
Both the palm and olive HFDs resulted in greater weight gain relative to
controls; however, mice fed the palm HFD gained an average of
3.0 g � 1.3 g (equating 8.5% � 2.8%) more body weight than the
olive HFD group (Figure 1A). Similarly, significant fat accumulation was
exhibited by both HFD groups, but total fat mass (Figure 1B), and

 visceral (perirenal and perigonadal) fat deposition were more pro-
nounced in the palm HFD mice (Figure 1C). This was accompanied by
greater caloric intake in the palm HFD group compared to controls and
olive HFD (Figure 1D). While no changes were observed in plasma total
non-esterified free fatty acid levels (Figure 1E), plasma leptin levels
increased in both the palm and olive HFD groups with no difference
between the two HFDs (Figure 1F). As compared to both the control
and olive HFD groups, mice fed palm HFD had higher insulin
(Figure 1G) and glucose levels (Figure 1H). Consistently, oral glucose
tolerance tests demonstrate that the palm HFD provoked glucose
intolerance (30, 45 and 60 min) (Figure 1I). Moreover, mice fed the
palm HFD demonstrated a trend towards reduced insulin sensitivity
relative to controls (Figure 1J). Plasma CRP and TNF levels were
elevated by palm HFD relative to the olive HFD and control diet
(Figure 1K,L). Finally, plasma IL-1b and corticosterone concentrations
increased in the palm HFD group relative to controls (Figure 1M, N).
3.2. Stimulation of anxiodepressive behavior by a saturated (but
not monounsaturated) high-fat diet
To establish if the development of anxiodepressive behavior relies on
diet lipid composition and associated metabolic consequences, naïve
mice were tested in the elevated-plus maze (EPM) and forced swim
test (FST) following the 12-week diet period. The palm HFD reduced
the proportion of time spent and number of entries into the open arm of
the EPM as compared to controls and olive HFD (Figure 2A,B). Mice fed
the palm, but not the olive, HFD had increased immobility time in the
FST compared to controls (Figure 2C). Swim speed (velocity) was
similar across the three diet conditions (Figure 2D), suggesting that
changes in locomotor capacity do not account for reduced mobility
exhibited by palm HFD mice in the EPM and FST. In addition, locomotor
activity measured during the last 2 h of light phase (period when
behavioral testing was carried out) was similar between palm HFD and
control mice (data not shown).

 3.3. Saturated high-fat feeding triggers inflammation in the
nucleus accumbens
Structural and functional alterations in the NAc have been well asso-
ciated with anhedonia, anxiodepressive behavior, and manifestation of
depressive disorders [18,36,37]. Thus, we next sought to determine if
NAc inflammation accompanies peripheral immune activation evoked
by the palm HFD. NAc mRNA levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1),
astrocyte and microglia/macrophage markers respectively, were
potentiated by the palm HFD (Figure 3A). In addition, IFN-g and heat
shock protein-72 (HSP-72; marker of neural injury) expression
increased and there was a trend (p ¼ 0.08) for elevated expression of
CD45 (leukocyte common antigen) in palm HFD mice relative to con-
trols (Figure 3A).
Considering the key contribution of the NFlB pathway in the expres-
sion of pro-inflammatory genes, we assessed NFlB activity in
response to the three diets. For effective readout of NFlB transcrip-
tional activity [32], we next submitted NFkB-LacZ (beta-galactosidase,
bgal) reporter mice to the diets to measure and visualize changes of
NAc NFlB activation. bgal immunolabeling revealed greater bgal
expression in the palm HFD group (Figure 3B). The palm HFD produced
a significant increase in bgal signal intensity relative to the control diet
and olive HFD (Figure 3C).
Heightened GFAP and Iba-1 mRNA levels observed in palm HFD mice
persuaded further examination of diet-induced reactive gliosis in the
NAc. Consistent with gene expression data, GFAP immunohisto-
chemistry revealed an elevation in the number of GFAP þ astrocytes in
palm HFD mice compared to controls (Figure 3D,E). Although increases
in Iba-1þ microglia/macrophage number were not significant
(Figure 3F,G), Iba-1þ microglia of palm HFD mice displayed greater
amoeboid (active state) morphology as evidenced by fewer (Figure 3H)
and shorter (Figure 3I) processes as well as reduced soma ratio
(Figure 3J). Retraction of microglia processes, characteristic of in-
flammatory conditions, is a morphological change associated with
greater mobility and phagocytic activity in response to immune threat.
Density and perimeter of soma (Figure 3K,L) remained unchanged
across all three diets.
3.4. Nucleus accumbens viral inhibition of IKKb/NFkB prevents
diet-induced anxiodepressive behavior and neuroinflammation
In order to evaluate the involvement of NFlB signaling in diet-induced
NAc neuroinflammation and anxiodepressive behavior, we applied a
viral strategy for targeted delivery of a dominant negative form of IKKb,
an upstream component of the canonical IKK complex conferring NFlB
activation (AdIKKdn), or a control adenovirus expressing green fluores-
cent protein (AdGFP) in mice fed the control diet or the palm HFD
(Figure 4A). Histology and bgal immunofluorescence in LPS-treated
NFkB-LacZ reporter mice injected with AdIKKdn or control (AdGFP)
confirmed NAc injection coordinates and the effectiveness of AdIKKdn to
reduce NFlB activity (Figs. S2A and B). bgal immunofluorescence was
unchanged in the dorsal and ventrolateral areas of the striatum (data
not shown). bgal gene expression was also compared between the
AdGFP-infected and AdIKKdn-infected hemispheres of LPS-treated
NFlB-LacZ reporter mice (Fig. S2C). While the palm HFD increased

 body weight relative to control as expected, no effect of the virus
injected (AdGFP vs. AdIKKdn) was observed (Figure 4B). Accordingly, viral
inhibition of IKKb/NFlB in the NAc did not affect locomotor activity,
energy expenditure and respiratory exchange (Fig. S3). In agreement
with our previous results, Palm HFD mice receiving AdGFP (“PalmGFP”)
showed a significant reduction in the proportion of time spent
(Figure 4C) and frequency of entries (Figure 4D) into the open arm of
the EPM as compared to ControlGFP mice. Targeted inhibition of IKKb/
NFlB in the NAc of Palm HFD mice (“PalmIKKdn”) normalized EPM
anxiety-like behavior to that of controls (Figure 4C,D) without differ-
ences in distance travelled (Figure 4E). Similarly, the effect of Palm
HFD to increase behavioral despair in the FST was reproduced as
shown by increased immobility time in PalmGFP mice as compared to
ControlGFP mice (Figure 4F), an effect that was blocked in PalmIKKdn
mice (Figure 4F). These changes occurred without any differences
between groups in swim velocity during the FST (Figure 4G). Moreover,
the 24 h assessment of locomotor activity in metabolic chambers,
notably during the light phase when behavioral testing occurred,
suggests that normalization of behavioral despair in PalmIKKdn mice is
not attributed to increased locomotion (Fig. S3).
NAc IKKb mRNA expression was reduced by 58.5% � 4.4% in Pal-
mIKKdn mice (0.97 fold change vs. ControlGFP) relative to PalmGFP mice
(2.33 fold change vs. ControlGFP) (Figure 4H). PalmGFP mice demon-
strated enhanced NAc mRNA expression of GFAP, Iba-1, vimentin, TNF,
IL-1b, IFN-g, CD45, and CD11b (macrophage and microglia marker)
compared to ControlGFP mice (Figure 4H). As these results suggested
recruitment of immune cells, major histocompatibility complex class I
(MHC-I) and class II (MHC-II) genes were quantified and found to be
highly elevated in PalmGFP relative ton ControlGFP mice (Figure 4H). On
the other hand, HFDIKKdn mice showed marked reductions in the
expression of GFAP, Iba-1, vimentin, TNF, IL-1b, MHC-I, and MHC-II
compared to PalmGFP mice (Figure 4H). In contrast, mRNA levels of
vimentin, TNF, MHC-I and MHC-II tended to increase in ControlIKKdn
mice compared to ControlGFP controls, a finding that likely reflects the
bimodal influence of NFlB on inflammatory gene expression [38].
3.5. Nucleus accumbens IKKb/NFkB signaling modulates sucrose
reward and compulsive seeking
Obesity is strongly tied to heightened food reward and food cue
reactivity [39,40], and depressed mood can trigger overconsumption of
palatable foods as a means to offset the negative emotional state
[18,20]. Moreover, numerous lines of evidence implicate the NAc in the
control of food-motivated behavior and cue-induced food-seeking
[13,14,41]. To determine if NAc IKKb/NFlB inhibition blunts sucrose-
motivated behavior, PR operant testing was carried out in ControlGFP,
ControlIKKdn, PalmIKKdn and PalmGFP immediately before and after
adenoviral injections. There were no differences in breakpoint
thresholds between ControlGFP and ControlIKKdn as well as between
PalmIKKdn and PalmGFP mice before surgery (Figure 5A); however,
PalmIKKdn mice breakpoint values significantly dropped after adenoviral
injections relative to pre-surgery baseline (Figure 5A,B) despite no
differences in preference for correct lever between ControlGFP, Con-
trolIKKdn, PalmIKKdn and PalmGFP mice (Figure 5C). Viral injections had
no impact on post-injection body weights, food intake, plasma insulin
and leptin and the capacity of mice to discriminate between correct
and incorrect levers (Fig. S4). As a final step, we sought to investigate
if NAc IKKb/NFlB inhibition could counteract heightened sucrose
seeking elicited by withdrawing access to HFD (transition to chow [19])
using the cue conditioned suppression test of compulsive food seeking
(Figure 5D) [35,42]. PalmGFP mice transitioned to a normal chow diet
failed to show a significant reduction in sucrose responding despite
exposure to aversive conditioning (Figure 5E) to suggest the presence
of compulsive sucrose seeking. Conversely, lever-pressing was
markedly suppressed by aversive conditioning in PalmIKKdn mice
(Figure 5E), providing evidence that moderating palm HFD-evoked
NFkB/IKKb signaling can diminish compulsive sucrose-seeking.
4. DISCUSSION
Obesity and mood disorder comorbidity poses a major threat to the
management of obesity, depression, and overall health. Obesity is
estimated to escalate the risk of major depressive disorder by 58% [1],
a relationship that is absent when obesity presents without major
metabolic deficits [21,43]. Dietary lifestyle is a key determinant of
metabolic outcomes and is increasingly linked to changes in brain
function and the development of neuropsychiatric and neurodegen-
erative diseases. Unraveling the complex interactions between nutrient
intake and metabolism, endocrine output, immune activity, and neural
function is germane to identifying the pathophysiological mechanisms
through which diet and obesity can perturb emotional and motivational
processes.
The present findings demonstrate that overconsumption of saturated
fat (in combination with excess sugar) that leads to the development of
DIO stimulates anxiodepressive behavior. The use of an olive oil-based
HFD permitted identification of the unique impact of saturated lipids
on behavioral indices and anxiety and despair. Stimulation of
anxiodepressive behavior by the palm HFD was accompanied by
elevated adiposity, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, hyper-
corticosteronemia and circulating pro-inflammatory markers - features
of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome [44]. As we reported
previously, the palm HFD also raises plasma concentrations of the long
chain fatty acid palmitate in a manner proportional to diet content [23].
Largely protective effects of the isocaloric olive HFD on glucose ho-
meostasis, peripheral and central immune activity and anxiodepressive
behavior, despite significant increases in body weight, fat mass, and
leptin levels, underscore the distinct action of the saturated HFD.
Consistent with these observations, monounsaturated fatty acids can
provide cardio-metabolic [25] and mood benefits [26] while Mediter-
ranean diets characterized by a higher proportion of monounsaturated
fats confer reduced risk of metabolic [45] and mood disorders [46,47].
Moreover, a large component of the olive oil HFD and Mediterranean
diets is oleate, a fatty acid reported to have anti-inflammatory prop-
erties [48]. Thus, oleate may help protect against the priming of
microglia observed in the olive group of the current study. This
observation is consistent with oleic acid inhibition of LPS-induced
NFkB activation in cultured microglia [49]. On the other hand,
plasma levels of the saturated fatty acid palmitate are associated with
depression severity in humans [50] whereas acute palmitate treatment
in mice, a manipulation tied to increase hypothalamic inflammation
[51,52], has anxiogenic actions [53]. Collectively, the present results
are largely consistent with clinical and epidemiological observations
and with rodent studies from our lab and others suggesting that
metabolic impairments underlie the expression of anxiodepressive
behavior in obesity [21,43,44,46,47,54e60].
Multiple lines of evidence point to the immune-activating actions of
saturated fats in the development of anxiodepressive behavior.
Increased visceral adiposity, which correlates with inflammatory profile
and metabolic dysfunction [55], manifested in mice fed the saturated
but not the monounsaturated HFD. In addition, as seen here and in
previous studies [23,61], the saturated HFD caused a substantial rise
in CORT which may have well generated heightened peripheral and
central immune responses. These changes were accompanied by

 significantly higher circulating levels of CRP, TNF, and IL-1b, inflam-
matory signals well-associated with depression risk and severity. CRP,
in particular, was highlighted as a primary variable predicting
depression onset in obesity [6]. Concomitantly, several indicators of
inflammation in the NAc were distinguished in saturated HFD mice,
including heightened NFlB activation, reactive gliosis, and elevated
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune markers. Of
key importance, reversal of all of these upregulated genes by the
saturated HFD mice was accomplished by selective NAc IKKb/NFlB
inhibition that was sufficient to protect from diet-induced anx-
iodepressive behavior.
Peripheral cytokines can access the central nervous system and in-
crease production of local inflammatory mediators including cytokines
and chemokines by endothelial cells, perivascular macrophages,
microglia, and astrocytes. The saturated HFD increased mRNA
expression of microglia and astrocyte markers (Iba-1 and GFAP) in the
NAc and augmented their activity and number, respectively. This result
is in line with reports of reactive gliosis in the hypothalamus in
response to a HFD [11,28]. Also evident was increased gene expres-
sion of IFN-g, a cytokine promoting immune cell infiltration produced
by resident microglia and macrophages as well as astrocytes and
lymphoid cells [62,63]. IFN-g is also an important activator of mac-
rophages and inducer of MHC-I and MHC-II expression, molecules that
were substantially increased in PalmGFP mice. The trend for increased
CD45 expression observed could additionally suggest macrophage
recruitment; however, while it was previously shown that DIO can
provoke infiltration of peripheral immune cells [64] establishing
whether or not they are increased in the NAc would require local cell
quantification. Elevated HSP-72 expression serves as added evidence
of NAc cellular insult and inflammation by the saturated HFD as this
protein protects from apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Finally,
immunohistochemistry data revealed heightened transcriptional ac-
tivity of NFlB. Taken together, these findings uncover NAc immune
activation in response to prolonged saturated high-fat feeding and
obesity.
Increases in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes by palm HFD
was more pronounced in mice receiving adenovirus injections
(magnitude of gene expression increases more pronounced in PalmGFP
vs. ControlGFP), owing perhaps to the combined immune-stimulating
effect of the diet and the injection and/or virus. In view of this, we
measured the expression of additional immune markers, which prove
more difficult to quantify in less inflammatory conditions. In agreement
with the role of IKKb/NFlB pathway, saturated HFD increased IKKb
mRNA expression and this was normalized by viral-mediated inhibition
of IKKb in PalmIKKdn mice. Additionally, NAc inhibition of the IKKb/NFlB
signaling pathway reduced signs of reactive gliosis (GFAP, Iba-1,
vimentin) as well expression of cytokines (TNF, IL-1b) and antigen
markers (CD11b, MHC-II). These molecular changes corresponded
with a reversal of behavioral signs of despair and anxiety. Importantly,
viral injections did not alter metabolic measures and thus cannot
explain the biochemical and behavioral changes found. Together, these
observations resonate with the link between peripheral immune cells
infiltration and anxiodepressive behavior [9,65] as well as reduced
bloodebrain barrier permeability by high-fat feeding [66,67]. In
contrast, IKKb/NFlB inhibition failed to reduce the expression of in-
flammatory markers in mice fed the control LFD given that markers of
astrogliosis (vimentin), inflammation (TNF) and immune responses
(MHC-I, MHC-II) had a tendency to be higher in ControlIKKdn as
compared to ControlGFP mice. We suspect this to be related to the
additional functions of the NFlB signaling pathway outside of in-
flammatory regulation [32]. As NFlB is constitutionally active in
neurons, attempts to inhibit this pathway under basal conditions may
be challenged by homeostatic mechanisms. These findings suggest
that improvements in anxiodepressive behavior in this metabolic
inflammation model can be explained, at least in part, by reduction of
the NFlB pathway in the NAc, and are consistent with reports of
neuroinflammation-induced
anxiodepressive
behavior
in
rodents
[65,68e70] and impairments in NAc function following peripherally-
induced inflammation in humans [71].
Depression and anxiety can stimulate palatable food cravings and hy-
perphagia in a subset of individuals [44,72]. Mice fed the saturated HFD
and then subjected to a dieting manipulation known to increase
palatable food craving (transition to a low-fat diet) [22] were resistant to
an aversive conditioning procedure that suppresses food-seeking under
normal conditions [35,42,73]. NAc-specific inhibition of the NFlB
signaling pathway not only reduced sucrose motivation in PalmIKKdn, but
not ControlIKKdn, mice but also prevented compulsive sucrose-seeking
behavior upon withdrawal of the palm HFD. These data are in agree-
ment with the involvement of the NFlB signaling pathway in rein-
forcement and motivated behaviors [74e76]. As the NFlB signaling
pathway has been shown to mediate morphological and molecular
changes in NAc medium spiny neurons [36,37,75,77,78], we posit that
saturated HFD-induced NFlB transcriptional activity in the NAc favors
neural adaptations underlying changes in mood and motivation. Despite
observations of diminished sucrose-seeking by NAc NFlB inhibition
there were no changes in body weight in PalmIKKdn mice that could be
anticipated if mice are less motivated to consume palatable food. We
speculate that this is due to the fact that ad libitum access to HFD (as
was provided in home cage where majority of daily calories were
consumed) demands little effort to consume and thus does not engage
the NAc-mediated motivational processes at play in the operant task, a
view that is consistent with NAc interventions differentially modulating
free-feeding vs. effort-based food seeking [41]. Nevertheless, identi-
fying high-fat feeding-related neural adaptations underlying the
pervasive nature of palatable food consumption in typical environmental
conditions in which there is a cost for food is likely to provide important
insights for hyperphagia and obesity treatment.
5. CONCLUSIONS
Collectively, this work identifies the capacity of excess saturated di-
etary fat to elicit metabolic impairments, peripheral and neural immune
activation, anxiodepressive behavior, and sucrose motivation. The link
between obesity and depression may thus involve overconsumption of
saturated lipids (and perhaps other pro-inflammatory food/diets) and
ensuing NFlB-mediated inflammatory processes in the NAc, and
thereby suggests that anti-inflammatory strategies may prove valuable
for treating depression in obese individuals. Resulting immune acti-
vation in the NAc is suspected to induce neuroplastic adaptations that
generate mood impairments, although further work is needed to
identify the neural modifications and NAc output pathways involved in
this phenomenon.
