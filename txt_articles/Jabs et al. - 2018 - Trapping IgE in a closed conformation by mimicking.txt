Anti-IgE therapeutics interfere with the ability of IgE to bind to its receptors on effector cells.
Here we report the crystal structure of an anti-IgE single-domain antibody in complex with an
IgE Fc fragment, revealing how the antibody inhibits interactions between IgE and the two
receptors FcεRI and CD23. The epitope overlaps only slightly with the FcεRI-binding site but
significantly with the CD23-binding site. Solution scattering studies of the IgE Fc reveal that
antibody binding induces a half-bent conformation in between the well-known bent and
extended IgE Fc conformations. The antibody acts as functional homolog of CD23 and
induces a closed conformation of IgE Fc incompatible with FcεRI binding. Notably the anti-
body displaces IgE from both CD23 and FcεRI, and abrogates allergen-mediated basophil
activation and facilitated allergen binding. The inhibitory mechanism might facilitate strate-
gies for the future development of anti-IgE therapeutics for treatment of allergic diseases.

llergic diseases can be linked to IgE antibodies present in
the circulation and on the surface of a variety of cell
types1. Although the least abundant type of antibodies,
IgE exhibits a variety of structural peculiarities with major
functional consequences. IgE acts as a key molecule in a network
of proteins, including the high-affinity IgE receptor FcεRI, the
low-affinity receptor CD23, and galectins, e.g., galectin-32. Upon
crosslinking by allergens, IgE bound to FcεRI on mast cells and
basophils triggers degranulation, release of proinflammatory
mediators, and immediate reactions2.
IgE is an evolutionarily conserved and heavily glycosylated
heterotetramer (Fig. 1a) with the epsilon heavy chain having four
constant domains. The IgE Fc binds to the human FcεRI complex
that is expressed as an αβγ2 tetramer or an αγ2 trimer lacking the
signal amplifying β-subunit3–5. The α-chain of the FcεRI displays
an affinity for IgE in the range of 1011 M–1, providing the basis for
long-term stability on effector cells and half-life of ~10 days6.
Strategies to reduce increased levels of IgE and to limit effector
cell degranulation included the development of antagonistic anti-
IgE antibodies and antibody alternatives including a DARPin and
aptamers7. The only approved anti-IgE antibody, omalizumab,
primarily prevents interaction of free IgE with its receptor on
effector cells8–10 and eventually reverses phenotypic and func-
tional effects of IgE such as enhanced FcεRI levels on effector
cells11,12. Not all patients with allergic asthma benefit from
treatment13 and failure may also be caused by pharmacologically
active IgE:omalizumab complexes14 that hamper correct dosing
of anti-IgE15. Second-generation anti-IgE molecules such as
ligelizumab and MEDI4212 are currently under investigation, but
initial results suggest limited improvement. Basic structural and
functional aspects of anti-IgE, e.g., the mechanism of rapid
improvement in chronic urticaria, remain unclear16,17.
Key for receptor binding and therefore anti-IgE concepts is the
IgE Fc that may adopt strongly bent or extended structures with
most
striking
differences
in
the
positioning
of
the
Cε2
domains18,19. Furthermore, the Cε3–4 sub-fragment adopts dif-
ferent conformational states ranging from closed to open
depending on the spacing of the Cε3 domains and their distance
to the Cε4 domains20. This conformational flexibility allows the
Cε3 domains to rotate (swing) closer to or farther away from each
other (Fig. 1b, c).
Structural studies have unraveled how IgE interacts in a highly
ordered and specific manner with its receptors. The FcεRI-
binding site on the IgE Fc is located primarily on the Cε3 domain
whereas CD23 binds to a site involving both the Cε3 and Cε4
domains (Fig. 1a)21,22. FcεRI binds to the open and CD23 to the
closed conformation of Cε3–4 domains (Fig. 1b) making binding
of the two receptors mutually exclusive and preventing overlap of

 the two pathways. Generally, anti-IgE antibodies are supposed to
bind in proximity to the FcεRI-binding site in order to interfere
with the receptor binding. A recent study of the omalizumab:IgE
complex defined steric interference with FcεRI as the main
mechanism for its inhibitory effects23.
Single-domain antibodies (sdabs) are the antigen-binding
moiety of heavy chain antibodies occurring in camelid species
and cartilaginous fishes24,25. Their small size and peculiar bio-
chemical features render sdabs highly versatile molecules. Here
we report the crystal structure and structure in solution of the
human IgE Fc in complex with the sdab 026, a llama-derived,
humanized sdab that was selected against IgE. Our data show that
each IgE Fc is targeted by two sdab having an epitope largely
distinct from the FcεRI binding site but overlapping significantly
with the CD23-binding site. Inhibition of IgE binding to FcεRI
occurs through an allosteric mechanism where the IgE Fc is
trapped in a closed, less bent conformation similar to the CD23-
bound conformation. Hence, our data provide evidence for a
mechanism of inhibition with major implications for the biology
and therapeutic targeting of IgE.
Results
Structure of IgE Fc bound by two single-domain antibodies.
The 026 sdab, recently developed for IgE targeting in allergic
diseases26, was produced in bacteria and purified from super-
natant in yields of up to 80 mg l−1. The IgE Fc Cε2–4 was purified
from the supernatant of mammalian cell culture (Supplementary
Figure 1a). The proteins exhibited immunoreactivity in ELISA
(Fig. 1d). Sandwich ELISA analysis using immobilized 026 sdab
as capturing antibody suggested the presence of two 026 sdab
binding sites in the IgE Fc as bound IgE could be detected using a
bivalent 026 sdab Fc fusion molecule (Fig. 1e). Residual binding
of omalizumab to 026 sdab bound IgE Fc suggests a partial
overlap of the 026 sdab epitope with the omalizumab epitope. In
contrast, the lack of ligelizumab binding might indicate either
significant overlap of the epitopes or conformational changes
incompatible with ligelizumab binding (Fig. 1e). Surface plasmon
resonance analysis using IgE Fc coupled to the sensor surface
revealed a dissociation constant KD = 1.4 nM for the sdab, slightly
higher than that reported for binding to IgE (Fig. 1f)26. Mediator
release assays verified biological activity of the IgE Fc and rele-
vance of the glycan at N394 (Fig. 1g).
After purification of the IgE Fc:026 sdab complex (Supple-
mentary Figure 1), we obtained crystals that diffracted X-rays to a
maximum resolution of 3.4 Å (Table 1) and determined the
structure by molecular replacement. The asymmetric unit
contains two copies of the 026 sdab and one IgE Fc molecule.
During the process of structure determination it became clear
that the crystals contained the IgE Fc Cε3–4 fragment and not the
IgE Fc Cε2–4 as expected. Apparently a small fraction of IgE Fc
Cε3–4 was sufficient for crystallization of the complex between
the sdab and this Fc fragment. Iterative rebuilding and refinement
resulted in a final structure with Rwork/Rfree values of 0.2123/
0.2408 (Table 1). Most residues could be traced with confidence
and clear electron density is present for the majority of residues at
the sdab:Fc interface (Supplementary Figure 2). The 026 sdab
binds symmetrically to the IgE Cε3–4 forming a 2:1 complex
where each sdab:Fc interaction buries ~800 Å2 upon complex
formation (Fig. 2a, b). The contacts involve surface areas that are
clearly different from the FcεRIα binding loops (Fig. 2b, c and
Supplementary Figure 3a); thus, the 026 sdab does not inhibit IgE:
FcεRI interactions by blocking the binding site. Instead, the sdab
is positioned between Cε3 and Cε4 from two different ε-chains, a
region also containing the binding site of CD2322.
As expected the complementarity determining regions (CDRs)
in the sdab are responsible for the majority of the IgE
contacts. The sdab bridges the Cε3 and Cε4 domains from
each ε-chain in the IgE Fc dimer (Fig. 2a, b) with the Cε3 and the
Cε4 domains contributing with 30% and 70%, respectively, of
the total buried surface area on IgE Fc. Although the resolution
of the diffraction data is limited to 3.4 Å, the quality of the
electron density map at the sdab:IgE Fc interface allowed us to
suggest putative intermolecular hydrogen bonds and salt bridges.
The CDR3 is inserted between the Cε3 and Cε4 domains
and contacts several residues in the D–E loop of Cε4. Residues
D99 and D110 in the sdab possibly engage in electrostatic
interactions with the side chain of IgE K497, and E108 appears to
make hydrogen bonds to IgE Fc residues 498–501 (Fig. 2c).
Several residues in sdab CDR1 and CDR3 may recognize R393 in
the Fc C-D loop through hydrogen bonds and salt bridges
(Fig. 2d). In addition to the contacts mediated by the CDRs,
residues in framework region 2 (FR2) also contribute. A
glutamine (Q39) is likely to engage in two hydrogen bonds with
the main chain of IgE R440 in the linker between Cε3 and Cε4,
and sdab R44 is in position for forming hydrogen bonds to A442
and N468 (Fig. 2e).
In order to validate the crystal structure we mutated residues
within sdab CDRs observed to contact IgE (Supplementary
Figure 4a–c). Most mutations led to a significant reduction of
sdab binding to IgE Fc (Supplementary Figure 4d). In particular,
mutation of residues E108, D110 and Y112 in CDR3 abolished
IgE binding suggesting a critical role in the interaction and

 supporting that the contribution of CDR3 to the interaction is
essential.
In IgE, N394 carries an oligomannosidic glycan that is essential
for biological activity27. In our structure, we observe this as a (N-
acetylglucosamine)2(mannose)5 (NAG2MAN5) hepta-saccharide,
which represents the major form in natural IgE derived from
myeloma cells as well as allergic patients (Supplementary
Figure 5)28. The hepta-saccharide has been reported for the
structure of free IgE Fc and in both structures the glycans contact
the same residues suggesting limited flexibility of the glycan29.
Despite proximity of the sdab epitope to the glycan there is no
direct contact, but water-mediated contacts not visible at this
resolution may be present.
Structural basis for the inhibitory activity of the sdab. Recently,
structures of the Fab fragments of omalizumab23, two other anti-
IgE antibodies18,30, and a DARPin31 in complex with IgE Fc
domains have been described. All these molecules preferentially
bind to the Cε3 domain of IgE critically involved in FcεRIα
binding (Supplementary Figure 3). The sdab in contrast exhibits a
binding mode clearly different from the DARPin and the Fab
fragments, and the IgE residues interacting with sdab CDRs are
also largely distinct from those that engage FcεRIα. Hence, direct
competition between the sdab and FcεRI for binding must be
negligible (Supplementary Figure 3a). In contrast, there is a sig-
nificant overlap between the sdab and the CD23 epitopes (Fig. 3a,
b). In particular, IgE Fc residues S437-R440 interact with the sdab
and also provide an important part of the CD23 epitope (Fig. 3c).
Binding to FcεRI and CD23 stabilizes different conformations
of the IgE Cε3–4 domains, the open and closed state, respectively.
A direct comparison shows that within the sdab complex IgE Fc
adopts a closed conformation similar to that adopted upon CD23
binding, which is incompatible with binding to FcεRI (Fig. 3d and
Supplementary Figure 6). The sdab-mediated stabilization of the
closed conformation provides a rationale for the sdab’s inhibitory
mechanism with respect to IgE/FcεRI interaction, whereas CD23
binding to IgE is prevented by steric hindrance.
Effect of single-domain antibody on FcεRI and CD23 binding.
From the structural data it is evident that the binding sites of
FcεRI and the sdab, which was developed as anti-IgE blocking IgE
binding to FcεRI, are without significant overlap that could
explain an inhibitory activity of the sdab by competition. As
expected, the anti-IgE sdab prevented binding of IgE and release

 of mediators from RBL-SX38 effector cells (Fig. 4a). Recently an
anti-IgE DARPin (and omalizumab at higher concentrations) was
shown to accelerate dissociation of IgE from FcεRI23,31. Therefore
we assessed the effect of the sdab on IgE bound to the FcεRI.
Flow cytometry analysis of surface IgE on human basophils
obtained from three allergic patients sensitized to inhalative and
injected allergen showed that treatment with the 026 sdab for
15 min reduced the amount of surface IgE to ~30% (Fig. 4b,
Supplementary Table 1). Prolonging the incubation time further
reduced surface IgE to ~20%. Neither the inactive sdab mutant
112 nor omalizumab exhibited comparable reduction. Incubation
of
immobilized
IgE:FcεRI
complexes
with
026
sdab
and
omalizumab supported the displacement of IgE by the 026 sdab
(Supplementary Figure 7).
Next, we analyzed the impact on basophil activation for a panel
of six patients with birch pollen allergy (Supplementary Table 1).
The high prevalence of birch pollen allergy and the fact that birch
pollen major allergen Bet v 1 is the predominant allergen for the
vast majority of birch pollen allergic patients in Northern Europe
allows for a good comparability of obtained results. Therefore we
analyzed changes in basophil allergen threshold sensitivity,
CDsens, to Bet v 1 in basophil activation tests. CDsens is a
well-established measure to quantify effector cell sensitivity to an
allergen and reflects the amount of allergen needed for efficient
activation. In accordance with the reduced surface IgE, the
026 sdab significantly reduced CDsens for patient’s basophils by
50–95%. (Fig. 4c–e). Levels of specific IgE (sIgE) to Bet v 1 and
total IgE (tIgE) in serum suggest that lower concentrations of sIgE
and as a consequence thereof smaller ratios of sIgE to tIgE
translate into a more efficient reduction of CDsens (Supplemen-
tary Figure 8). These findings are in line with the observation
that polysensitization can be accompanied with a less severe
phenotype of the allergic response.
To validate the observed overlap between the sdab and CD23
epitopes, we next assessed the capability of the sdab for
interfering with CD23 binding of IgE. ELIFAB assays are able
to detect the binding of preformed oligovalent IgE:allergen
complexes to CD2332. The monovalent sdab has a significantly
higher affinity to IgE as compared to monovalent CD23
(Kd: 2 µM). Sera of patients with elevated level of specific IgE

the birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 and the major yellow jacket
venom allergen Ves v 5 were incubated with the respective
allergen and the IgE:allergen complexes applied to CD23. The
sdab efficiently prevented binding of the IgE:allergen complexes
to CD23 (Fig. 4f). Moreover, even when applied after binding of
the complexes to CD23, the sdab displaced IgE efficiently within
minutes (Fig. 4g).
SAXS analysis of single-domain antibody binding to IgE Fc.
We next asked how sdab binding influences the conformation of
an IgE Fc including the Cε2 domain. Contaminating IgE Fc
Cε3–4 was first removed by hydrophobic interaction chromato-
graphy after which the IgE Fc:026 sdab complex was isolated by
size-exclusion chromatography (Supplementary Figure 9). Syn-
chrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data were then
collected for both unbound IgE Fc and in complex with 026 sdab

Fig. 4 Functional activity of the sdab. a Inhibition of mediator release from effector cells by 026 sdab was assessed in RBL-SX38 cells providing the human
FcεRI. Cells were sensitized with IgE Fc in presence of decreasing amounts of 026 sdab. Degranulation was induced by anti-IgE antibody and monitored by
released β-hexosaminidase activity. Data are the mean ± standard deviation of triplicate measurements. b Removal of IgE from the surface of basophils by
the 026 sdab, the inactive sdab mutant 112 and omalizumab was analyzed by surface staining of IgE using flow cytometry. Basophils of three patients with
allergy to different major allergens were used. Concentration of omalizumab was identical to sdab concentrations, but doubled to 90 µmol l−1 in the
prolonged periods. c The capability to reduce basophil sensitivity by displacement of IgE from FcεRI was assessed by basophil activation test (BAT).
Basophils were incubated with 026 sdab followed by incubation with Bet v 1. Activation of basophils was then assessed by detecting CD63+ basophils in
flow cytometry (exemplary BAT of one donor included in panel d). Data are mean ± s.d. d The effect of the 026 sdab on basophil activation was analyzed
for six birch pollen-sensitized patients. Reduction of effector cell sensitivity was evaluated by CDsens analysis. Comparison of paired samples ±sdab 026
treatment was done by using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p values < 0.05.
e Inhibition of IgE binding to CD23 by 026 sdab analyzed by ELIFAB. The binding of allergen:IgE complexes to surface bound CD23 was detected by anti-IgE
antibodies. Complexes were formed using sera of allergic patients having highly elevated specific IgE to Api m 1, Bet v 1 and Ves v 5 (>100 kUA l−1),
respectively. f The displacement of preformed IgE:allergen complexes from CD23 using sera as in panel e by the sdab was analyzed by detecting remaining
binding of allergen:IgE complexes after incubation with 026 sdab

 (Supplementary Figure 10a–d, Supplementary Table 2). The
pair–distance distribution plots showed very similar mass dis-
tributions in the two cases but with the IgE Fc:026 sdab complex
being slightly larger (Supplementary Figure 10e). Rigid body
modeling of the IgE Fc:026 sdab complex with the Cε3 domains
fixed in the closed conformation as in our crystal structure,
resulted in a tightly clustered ensemble of solutions fitting the
SAXS curve well with an average χ2 = 1.06 ± 0.04 according to
CORAL (Fig. 5a, b). Likewise, we conducted rigid body refine-
ment against the SAXS data collected from unbound IgE Fc with
the Cε3 domains fixed in either the closed or the open con-
formation during refinement. Both scenarios resulted in solutions
fitting the data with χ2 values in the range 1.8–2.3 according to
CORAL. Qualitatively output models from both scenarios were in
the bent conformation with the Cε2 domains located toward the
Cε3 domains (Fig. 5c, d). In roughly 95% of the output models
with the Cε3 domains fixed in the closed conformation, a sub-
stantial overlap between the Cε2 domains and a bound sdab 026
would occur. In agreement with this, a comparison of our crystal
structure of the IgE Fc:026 sdab complex not containing the Cε2
domains with the crystal structure of unbound IgE Fc (pdb ID:
2WQR)21 reveals that in the sdab complex, IgE Fc must adopt a
significantly less bent conformation than that observed in the
crystal structure of unbound IgE Fc to avoid overlap between the
Cε2 domains and bound sdab (Fig. 5e). Hence, the rigid body
modeling provided evidence for a sdab-mediated displacement of
the Cε2 and unbending of the IgE Fc resulting in a so far
undescribed conformation of the Fc Cε2–4 domains. But an
~100° rotation would still be required to reach the fully extended
conformation of IgE Fc (Fig. 5f).
To investigate whether the SAXS data for IgE Fc and IgE
Fc:026 sdab complex could be better explained by a mixture of
conformations, we also employed the ensemble optimization
method (EOM)33. For the IgE Fc:026 sdab complex the selected
structures clustered around a higher Dmax than the average
generated

 identical to the rigid body structures output from CORAL,
whereas the second conformation was slightly more extended.
The ensemble fitted the experimental data with χ2 = 1.27 as
calculated by GAJOE (Supplementary Figure 11b). The corre-
sponding EOM analysis of the unbound IgE Fc SAXS data
resulted in ensemble optimized structures falling in two separate
clusters with either a significantly smaller Dmax or a significantly
larger Dmax than the average generated structure (Supplementary
Figure 11c). The ensemble fitted the experimental data with
χ2 = 2.43 (Supplementary Figure 11d). The low Dmax cluster
accounting for ~70% of the scattering corresponded to a bent
conformation similar to the CORAL rigid body solutions,
whereas the high Dmax cluster corresponded to a conformation
falling in between the fully extended and bent and accounted for
~30% of the total scattering. Overall, the EOM analysis of the
solution scattering data confirmed the models obtained by rigid
body refinement but in addition provided evidence of a second
conformation in both cases. Altogether our SAXS analysis
suggested that IgE Fc in solution mainly adopts the bent
conformation as anticipated and that binding of 026 sdab induces
IgE Fc unbending to a conformation that is in between the
classical bent and the fully extended two-fold symmetric
conformation.
Discussion
Key to intervention in allergic diseases is the reduction of IgE in
the serum and eventually on effector cells. In this study, we show
that the anti-IgE sdab 026 targets IgE by binding to an epitope
within the Fc domains that does not significantly overlap with the
FcεRI-binding site. Notably the epitope is a conformational epi-
tope involving two domains and a buried surface of ~800 Å2 that
is larger than the omalizumab epitope23. Both epitope and inhi-
bition mode of sdab 026 are different from those previously
observed for anti-IgE molecules. The sdab blocks interaction with
FcεRI by trapping IgE Fc in a closed conformation of the Cε3
domains incompatible with FcεRI binding and a slightly more
extended conformation of the Cε2 domains.
The sdab epitope shows significant overlap with the CD23-
binding site. Although additional importance of the stalk region
of CD23 in binding to IgE has been postulated34 the shared motif
of the sdab and CD23 epitopes and the high affinity of the
026 sdab render an effect of the stalk on the inhibitory activity of
the sdab unlikely. As observed in the ELIFAB analyses the inhi-
bition of IgE binding to CD23 and displacement of IgE from
CD23 strongly supports the epitope inferred from the structure
and the mode of action of the anti-IgE sdab. Recently it has been
verified that omalizumab also blocks the interaction with CD2334,
most likely due to minor overlap of the epitope with the binding
site23.
Binding of allergen:IgE complexes to CD23, a C-type lectin and
low affinity IgE receptor, is crucial for facilitated antigen pre-
sentation and transport across the epithelium, and amplifies the
generation and epitope spread of specific IgE2,35. The inhibition
of CD23 binding by patients’ serum IgG correlates with the
activity of blocking IgG induced by successful allergen immu-
notherapy36 and leads to reduced T-cell activation37. Combining
immuno-therapy with omalizumab results in clear benefits for
treatment efficacy38. The main target of anti-IgE approaches
however remains interference with FcεRI-mediated immediate
effects.
IgE Fc adopts conformational states within the Cε3–Cε4
domain pairs ranging from an open conformation when in
complex with FcεRI to the closed conformation when bound to
CD23. Binding of FcεRI and CD23 to IgE is mutually exclusive as
each is dependent on the conformation of Fc. FcεRI binding to
free IgE moves the two Cε3 domains away from each other,
decreases the angle between Cε3 and Cε4 and makes the binding
site for CD23 inaccessible. Conversely, binding of CD23 to free
IgE increases the angle between Cε3 and Cε4, moves the Cε3
domains to a more closed conformation and prevents IgE Fc
interactions with FcεRI. In complex with the sdab, the Cε3 and
Cε4 domains adopt the closed conformation, which is incom-
patible with FcεRI binding. CD23 is contacting residues in Cε3
and Cε4 within the same chain and enforces the closed con-
formation by pushing the Cε3 domains closer together. With a
similar result, the sdab binds Cε3 and Cε4 from different ε chains
forcing a closed conformation by pulling the Cε3 from one chain
toward the other.
Most of the structures available for IgE Fc contain only the
Cε3–4 domains, and likewise we did not obtain crystals with the
entire IgE Fc probably since the flexibility of the Cε2 domains in
the IgE Fc hampers crystallization. The Cε3–4 fragment is often
used in a stabilized form having artificial disulfide bridges or
reduced glycosylation as a result of mutagenesis or choice of the
expression host. Here we use the authentic IgE Fc and thereby
minimize the risk of trapping the molecules in a rare or artificial
conformation.
Being unable to crystallize sdab in complex with the full IgE Fc
we used SAXS to analyze the complex and free IgE Fc in solution.
This allowed insights into the positioning of the Cε2 domain in
solution for both the free Fc as well as in the complex with the
sdab. Two different approaches to SAXS based modeling sug-
gested that with respect to the sdab complex, the IgE Fc Cε2
domains appear to adopt a primary conformation in between the
two well-established bent and extended IgE Fc conformations. In
unbound IgE Fc, the dominating conformation appears to be the
bent conformation. In addition, EOM analysis suggested that one
minor conformation somewhat different from the major con-
formation may be present in both cases.
Recently, the displacement of IgE from FcεRI by a DARPin IgE
antagonist was described23,31, and a similar, but lower activity has
been reported for omalizumab. Our data suggest that the 026 sdab
displaces IgE from FcεRI more efficiently than omalizumab. An
even four-fold molar excess of omalizumab Fab fragment over the
sdab did not result in significant IgE displacement. Apparently, the
sdab removes IgE from the surface of effector cells as shown for
basophils obtained from patients with different types of allergies.
The reduction of IgE correlates with a decreased sensitivity of the
effector cells to allergen-dependent activation as shown in a cohort
of birch pollen-sensitized patients. It is imperative to consider that
sensitivity of effector cells is shaped by the characteristics of surface
IgE, e.g., ratio of specific and total IgE, affinity and repertoire
complexity39. Although we used the dominant birch pollen allergen,
Bet v 1, patient-specific sensitization profiles influence the reduction
of cellular sensitivity, an effect likely to be even more pronounced in
multisensitized individuals.
With respect to the accessibility of one sdab-binding site on the
IgE even when bound to the FcεRI, the disruptive activity of the
sdab is most likely driven by the conformational rearrangement
upon sdab binding to the FcεRI bound IgE. With the capability of
the E2_79 DARPin, omalizumab and the 026 sdab for displacing
IgE it appears reasonable that the majority of anti-IgE molecules
might exhibit similar activity, at least to a certain extent.
Increasing this activity could become an important strategy for
improving efficacy of anti-IgE therapeutics40. Although the
removal of IgE from both circulation and effector cells could
represent a benefit, the in vivo effect has not been fully proven
yet. It has been shown that reduction of IgE on effector cells is
counterbalanced by increased sensitivity41. Additional studies are
therefore needed to address the displacement of IgE and its
consequences and implications in detail.

 Single-domain antibodies exhibit high production yield in
simple expression systems and extraordinary stability, properties
that render them interesting for numerous biotechnological and
biomedical applications42. Targeting IgE with sdabs could offer a
variety of benefits. Their 10-fold smaller size as compared to IgG
allows efficient targeting of less accessible sites and the mono-
valent format prevents formation of larger complexes. State-of-
the-art strategies for half-life extension and multiple targeting can
easily be applied to sdabs. Delivery in functional form via mucosal
and airway tissues is possible using sdabs43 and could improve
the use of difficult routes for anti-IgE application44.
The sdab’s mode of action identified in this study could also
open up for the development of novel anti-IgE molecules of even
lower molecular mass. It seems reasonable that high affinity
targeting of an epitope similar to the sdab epitope by smaller
molecules might drive similar conformational rearrangements.
Thus, our description of the 026 sdab mode of action is likely to
accelerate the development of anti-allergy and asthma drugs in
the future.
Methods
Crystallization. The 026 sdab:IgE Fc complex was concentrated to 5 mg ml−1 in
20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.2, and crystallized by vapor diffusion in sitting
drops formed by mixing protein and reservoir solution containing 0.1 M imidazole
pH 7.0, 11–12% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 20,000 in the ratio 1:1. Crystals were
cryocooled in liquid nitrogen after transfer to a cryo-protectant composed of 0.1 M
imidazole pH 7.0, 12% w/v PEG 20,000 and 30% glycerol.
Data collection and structure determination and refinement. Data were col-
lected at Diamond I2445 and processed with XDS46. The structure was determined
by molecular replacement with PHASER47 using the pdb ID: 2WQR as search
model21. The model was rebuild in Coot48 and refined with Phenix.refine and
iMDFF49,50. Figures were prepared with the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System
(Schrödinger LLC).
Protein expression and purification. The IgE Fc constant region cDNA was
obtained from an IgE expression vector initially constructed from a human cDNA
library. The cDNA was introduced into an expression vector providing a human
immunoglobulin signal sequence via SmiI and MssI restriction enzymes51. Point
mutations were introduced by PCR Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293,
ATCC) were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supple-
mented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 IU ml−1 peni-
cillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin. HEK-293 cells were transfected with the
expression vector using Nanofectin (GE Healthcare) according to the recommen-
dations of the manufacturer. After selection by addition of zeocin stably transfected
cells showed an expression yield of 10–15 mg l−1. Cell culture supernatant obtained
in roller flasks (Greiner) was collected and subsequently subjected to purification of
the IgE Fc via nickel based affinity chromatography. The supernatant was loaded
on a 1 ml HisTrap excel column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with PBS (500 mM
NaCl, 40 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4). After washing with 10 column
volumes (CV) of PBS and 20 CV of 5% PBS/imidazole (100 mM NaCl, 40 mM
Na2HPO4, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM imidazole, pH 7.4) the IgE Fc was eluted in
a 5–100% gradient of PBS/imidazole. Pooled fractions were dialyzed against Buffer
A (20 mM NaOAc, 50 mM NaCl, pH 6.5) and subsequently applied to a 1 ml Mono
S 5/50 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer A. After washing with
Buffer A, the protein was eluted with 20 CV of Buffer B (20 mM NaOAc, 1 M NaCl,
pH 6.5) with a 0–50% gradient. The IgE Fc was further purified by size exclusion
chromatography using a 24 ml Superdex 200 20/300 GL column (GE Healthcare)
equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.2.
The DNA of the sdab 026 (patent WO 2012’/175740 A1) was obtained as a
synthetic gene and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET22+ providing a
pelB signal sequence and a C-terminal histidine tag (Supplementary Table 3).
Expression of the sdab 026 and its variants was performed for 3 h at 30 °C after
IPTG induction. The supernatant was subjected to nickel-based affinity
chromatography on a 1 ml HisTrap excel column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated
with PBS. After washing with 10 CV of PBS and 20 CV of 5% PBS/300 mM
imidazole the protein was eluted with a 5 CV gradient from 5–100% of PBS/
imidazole. The sdab mutants were purified accordingly. After dialysis against
Buffer A (20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.5) the sdab was further purified using
ion exchange chromatography using a 6 ml Resource Q column (GE Healthcare)
equilibrated in Buffer A. After washing with 5 CV of Buffer A, the protein was
eluted with a 5 CV gradient from 0–50% Buffer B (20 mM Tris, 1 M NaCl, pH 8.5).
Prior to SAXS data collection IgE Fc was further purified to remove the Cε3–4
fragment by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using a 1 ml Source 15PHE
column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer A (1.6 M NH3SO4, 20 mM HEPES,
pH 7.2). The sample obtained from size exclusion chromatography was dialyzed
against Buffer A and applied to the column. After washing with 5 CV of Buffer A,
the protein was eluted with a 15 CV gradient from 0–100% Buffer B (50 mM NaCl,
20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2). IgE Fc Cε2–4 from the Source 15Phe purification was
mixed with purified 026 sdab and the complex was purified by size-exclusion
chromatography as described above.
Characterization of IgE Fc and 026. The binding of 026 sdab to IgE Fc was
assessed in ELISA. Purified IgE Fc (50 µg ml−1) was coated on microtiter plates
(Greiner) at 4 °C and blocked with 40 mg ml−1 milk powder in PBS. Thereafter,
026 sdab at a concentration of 10 µg ml−1 was incubated for 2 h at RT. After
washing, binding to IgE Fc was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
anti-human kappa antibody and anti-human IgG antibody diluted 1:30,000 and 30
µl of substrate solution.
For comparative assessment of anti-IgE antibodies, ELISA microtiter plates
were coated with 026 sdab (25 µg ml−1) at 4 °C and blocked with 40 mg ml−1 milk
powder in PBS. After incubation with IgE Fc, the anti-IgE antibodies were
incubated in a final volume of 20 µl for 4 h at room temperature. After washing
bound antibodies were detected using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-
human IgG antibody diluted 1:20,000, and 30 μl of substrate solution (5 mg ml−1 4-
nitro-phenylphosphate, AppliChem).
Affinity measurements. The affinity of the sdab was determined by using a T200
Biacore system. IgE Fc was immobilized to a total of 110 resonance units (RU) onto
a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) using NHS/EDC coupling procedures. Ana-
lyses were performed at 25 °C in a buffer containing 10 mM monosodium phos-
phate, 40 mM disodium phosphate and 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 supplemented with
0.01% Tween-20. For kinetic analyses the 026 sdab was injected at concentrations
from 0.003 to 50 µg ml−1 at a flow rate of 25 µl min−1. Association and dissociation
were assessed for 600 s. Regeneration of sensor surfaces was performed by sub-
sequent injection of 1 M Tris buffer, pH 10. The dissociation constant at equili-
brium KD was calculated using a 1:1 binding model and the Biacore T200
evaluation software.
Basophil activation tests and mediator release assays. Peripheral EDTA blood
from allergic donors was preincubated with 026 sdab, mu112 or omalizumab
(Novartis) at concentrations from 0 to a maximum of 45 µmol l−1 (sdab 026 and
mu112) and from 0 to 90 µmol l−1 (omalizumab), respectively, in IL-3-containing
stimulation buffer (Bühlmann) for up to 60 min on a shaker. Samples were stained
with anti-CCR3-PE in a 37 °C water bath for 15 min and anti-IgE-FITC (both
BioLegend) for 20 min at 4 °C. Erythrocytes were lysed for 7 min followed by
centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 µl washing
buffer and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IgE on CCR3+SSClow baso-
phils was measured by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences).
To analyze the impact of IgE026 on basophil activation, peripheral EDTA blood
from six patients with birch pollen allergy was incubated ±45 µmol l−1 sdab 026 for
60 min on a shaker. Afterwards, Bet v 1 (Biomay) diluted at different
concentrations (0.01–1000 ng ml−1) in stimulation buffer was added. In each case
one sample was left unstimulated to exclude background activation. Next, all
samples were incubated with 15 µl of staining reagent (Bühlmann) consisting of
anti-CCR3-PE and anti-CD63-FITC in a 37 °C water bath for 15 min. As above,
erythrocytes were lysed for 7 min followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min.
Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 µl washing buffer and basophil activation was
measured by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences). Basophils were
identified as CCR3+SSClow cells and CD63+ basophils were considered as activated.
All results were analyzed using BD FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).
CDsens analyses were performed as basophil allergen threshold stimulation.
Basophil allergen sensitivity was measured as the allergen concentration eliciting
50% (EC50) of maximum CD63 upregulation. The CDsens is defined as inverted
value for EC50 multiplied by 100, and was calculated by the following formula:
CDsens = 1/EC50 × 10052.
In order to analyze in vitro degranulation RBL-SX38 cells (kindly provided by
J.P. Kinet) were sensitized with rIgE Fc53. After washing with incomplete Tyrode’s
buffer, receptor cross-linking was performed by incubation with goat anti-human
IgE for 60 min at 37 °C. Release of β-hexosaminidase from viable vs. lysed cells was
assessed for 60 min at 37 °C using p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-glucosaminide (Sigma-
Aldrich) as a substrate. After stopping the reaction by addition of carbonate buffer
(0.1 M, pH 10) the absorbance was recorded at 405 nm.
Analyses of CD23 binding using the ELIFAB assay. In order to evaluate the
capability of 026 sdab to inhibit the binding of IgE:allergen complexes to CD23 the
ELISA-based ELIFAB assay, a cell-free variant of the FAB assay, was per-
formed32,54. To allow for formation of IgE:allergen complexes 20 μl of indicator
serum containing either high Api m 1-, Bet v 1- or Ves v 5-specific IgE con-
centrations (all >100 kUA l−1) was preincubated with the respective allergen at 37 °
C for 1 h in the presence of different 026 sdab concentrations. Following pre-
incubation, IgE:allergen complexes were transferred to plates coated with CD23
(R&D Systems, Bio-Techne) and incubated for 1 h at RT. IgE:allergen complexes
bound to immobilized CD23 were detected by adding biotin-conjugated anti-

 human IgE antibody (BD Biosciences), streptavidin-peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich),
and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Calbiochem, Merck Milli-
pore). All samples were analyzed in duplicates.
In a second set of ELIFAB experiments, preformed IgE:allergen complexes
bound to CD23 were incubated with 5 µl 026 sdab up to 60 min evaluating the
ability of 026 sdab to displace IgE:allergen complexes from CD23. Displacing IgE:
allergen complexes from immobilized CD23 was determined at a 026 sdab
concentration of 12 μg ml−1 for Api m 1 (Latoxan), 8 μg ml−1 for Bet v 1 (Biomay)
and 11 μg ml−1 for Ves v 5, respectively.
Small-angle X-ray scattering data collection and modeling. The SAXS mea-
surements of IgE Fc and IgE Fc in complex with sdab 026 were performed in batch
mode at the BM29 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility
(ESRF), Grenoble, France55. The data were collected using a PILATUS 1 M pixel
detector and λ = 0.992 Å in a temperature controlled capillary at 4 °C. The sample-
to-detector distance was 2.872 m, covering a range of momentum transfer 0.04 < q
< 5 nm−1 (q ¼ ð4 ´ π ´ sinθÞ � λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle). Samples in
20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.2 were investigated in the concentration ranges
0.5–1.7 and 2.2–9.0 mg ml−1 for the IgE Fc:026 sdab complex and IgE Fc,
respectively. Data were collected with 10 exposures of 2 s. Radial averaging, buffer
subtraction and concentration scaling were performed using the beamline pipe-
line56. Bovine serum albumin (Sigma, A7638-5GP) used for calculation of the
molecular weight (Supplementary Table 1) was solubilized in a buffer containing
50 mM Hepes pH 7.5 at concentration of 5 mg ml−1. For the IgE Fc:026 sdab
complex a concentration of 1.7 mg ml−1 was used for further modeling. For IgE Fc
the measurements at 2.2 and 9.0 mg ml−1 were merged using ALMERGE57. The
pair distribution function was calculated by indirect Fourier Transform using
GNOM58. Rigid body refinements were performed using a momentum transfer
range of q < 3.0 nm−1 with CORAL59. The 026 sdab and the Fc Cε3 and Cε4
domains were used as a single rigid body taken directly from our crystal structure.
The two Cε2 domains from the pdb entry 2WQR were grouped into a single rigid
body, and the C-terminal of both of the Cε2 domains were linked to the N-
terminal residue of their corresponding Cε3 domain with a distance restraint of 25
Å. Calculation of the angle of rotation between the SAXS models and the extended
(RCSB: 4J4P) and bent (RCSB: 2WQR) conformation of IgE Fc was performed
using DynDom60. Ensemble optimization of both unbound IgE Fc and the IgE
Fc:026 sdab complex was performed using the EOM 2.0 programs RANCH and
GAJOE33. A total of 5000 models were generated utilizing the same rigid bodies as
for CORAL rigid body modeling, but with a randomly generated alpha carbon
trace connecting the two rigid bodies, instead of a distance restrain. GAJOE was
then used to select the ensemble of models best representing the scattering curve.
Patient material. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical
Faculty of Philipps University, Marburg, Germany; all patients provided written
informed consent to participate in the trial.
Data availability. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the
Protein Data Bank under accession code 5NQW. Other data are available from the
