There is evidence for differential stability in personality trait differences, even over decades. The authors
used data from a sample of the Scottish Mental Survey, 1947 to study personality stability from childhood
to older age. The 6-Day Sample (N � 1,208) were rated on six personality characteristics by their
teachers at around age 14. In 2012, the authors traced as many of these participants as possible and invited
them to take part in a follow-up study. Those who agreed (N � 174) completed a questionnaire booklet
at age 77 years, which included rating themselves and asking someone who knew them well to rate them
on the same 6 characteristics on which they were rated in adolescence. Each set of 6 ratings was reduced
to the same single underlying factor, denoted dependability, a trait comparable to conscientiousness.
Participants’ and others’ older-age personality characteristic ratings were moderately correlated with
each other, and with other measures of personality and wellbeing, but correlations suggested no
significant stability of any of the 6 characteristics or their underlying factor, dependability, over the
63-year interval. However, a more complex model, controlling rater effects, indicated significant 63-year
stability of 1 personality characteristic, Stability of Moods, and near-significant stability of another,
Conscientiousness. Results suggest that lifelong differential stability of personality is generally quite low,
but that some aspects of personality in older age may relate to personality in childhood.

“Personality refers to an individual’s characteristic patterns of
thought, emotion, and behavior, together with the psychological
mechanisms—hidden or not—behind those patterns” (Funder,
2013, p. 5). Individual differences in personality traits are associ-
ated with many important aspects of life, including job perfor-
mance (Hurtz & Donovan, 2000), criminal behavior (Samuels et
al., 2004), and health behaviors (Mõttus et al., 2013). Although
personality traits show mean level change across the life course,
there also appears to be substantial stability of individual differ-
ences in personality, even over several decades (Caspi & Roberts,
2001; Caspi, Roberts, & Shiner, 2005; Hampson & Goldberg,
2006; Roberts & DelVecchio, 2000). In this study, we assessed
differential stability of personality across the life course, from
adolescence (14 years) to older age (77 years).
Personality stability into older age has been observed before.
For example, Leon, Gillum, Gillum, and Gouze (1979) followed a
group of 281 middle-aged men who first completed the Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) in 1947. Of the surviv-
ing members of the sample, 99 completed the MMPI again in 1977
at a mean age of 77 years. Correlations for each of the 13
personality scales between 1947 and 1977, across three decades of
later adulthood, ranged from .28 to .74, indicative of moderate to
strong stability of relative personality differences from middle to
older age.
Such relative stability has also been observed over similar periods
earlier in adulthood, and even from childhood. For example, Hamp-
son and Goldberg (2006) followed a cohort of over 2000 Hawaiians,
first studied as elementary schoolchildren (aged 6–12 years) between
1959 and 1967. At that time, participants were rated by their teachers
on a number of attributes. Approximately 40 years later, 799 of the
surviving members of the cohort completed questionnaires measuring
the Big Five personality traits. Although trait stability correlations
across later childhood and early adulthood were low for Neuroticism
(.00) and Agreeableness (.08), modest correlations were apparent for
Openness (.16), and particularly Conscientiousness (.25) and Extra-

 version (.29). Edmonds, Goldberg, Hampson, and Barckley (2013)
reassessed stability in the same cohort using interviewer ratings in
adulthood, which garnered higher stability correlations for Agreeable-
ness (.19) and Openness (.24).
However, very few studies have assessed the relative stability of
personality over longer periods. Soldz and Vaillant (1999) assessed
stability across the majority of adulthood in a group of Harvard
alumni, first assessed upon completing their studies at around age 22,
then again at around age 67 years. The observed stability correlations
for Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Openness from early to late adult-
hood were .20, .19, and .38, respectively. Further, Haan, Millsap, and
Hartka (1986) observed stability correlations of .16 to .38 for six
personality dimensions from early childhood (age 5–7 years) to late
adulthood (age 55–62 years). However, as far as we are aware, there
is no existing evidence of lifelong personality stability, both starting in
early life, before adulthood, and extending into older age, after around
70 years of age. The study presented here assessed the relative
stability from adolescence to older age of six single-item characteristic
measures, devised by Terman (1925), and their underlying factor,
dependability. Although dependability is not defined within the same
reference frame as more widely known personality traits, it is perhaps
most closely related to conscientiousness (Deary, Batty, Pattie, &
Gale, 2008).
The construct of wellbeing is closely related to and perhaps even
overlaps with personality, but also reflects maintenance of a life
situation that fosters an ability to thrive (Weiss, Bates, & Luciano,
2008). Personality has at least been observed to correlate with con-
temporaneous wellbeing (DeNeve & Cooper, 1998; Schmutte & Ryff,
1997; Steel, Schmidt, & Shultz, 2008), and others have also shown
personality to predict wellbeing over time. In particular, Friedman,
Kern, and Reynolds (2010) found correlations between Neuroticism
(�.29), Conscientiousness (.15) and Agreeableness (.15) in 1940 (at
a mean age of 29 years), and subjective wellbeing 46 years later. Gale,
Booth, Mõttus, Kuh, and Deary (2013) also assessed subjective well-
being in participants aged 60 to 64 years, previously assessed on
personality at ages 16 and 26 years. Each measure of wellbeing in
later adulthood was positively associated with Extraversion and neg-
atively associated with Neuroticism scores collected in youth (in each
case a latent factor underlying measurements of the trait at both 16
and 26 years). Because of the association or overlap between person-
ality and wellbeing, such results provide further insight into the
longitudinal stability of personality. The present study therefore also
assessed the relations between teachers’ ratings of personality char-
acteristics in adolescence and measures of subjective wellbeing in the
eighth decade of life.
Associations between personality and intelligence have been
investigated for at least 100 years (Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997;
Webb, 1915; Wechsler, 1950). Generally, socially desirable per-
sonality factors, such as Conscientiousness and Openness, are
associated with higher cognitive performance, whereas traits such
as Neuroticism and Psychoticism are negatively associated with
intelligence (Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997; Chamorro-Premuzic,
Furnham, & Ackerman, 2006; Schaie, Willis, & Caskie, 2004).
However, these associations are generally quite weak and may
change over time, becoming weaker in older age (Baker & Bichsel,
2006; Meier, Perrig-Chiello, & Perrig, 2002). Nonetheless, if in-
telligence is associated with personality, this should be considered
when assessing the relative stability of personality. Intelligence
was therefore also included in the present study.
We assessed the stability of personality differences and their
relations with wellbeing and intelligence over more than six de-
cades, from age 14 to age 77 years, thus spanning late childhood
development and also extending well into what is generally con-
sidered to be older age. We made use of data from the 6-Day
Sample, a representative sample of participants from the almost
whole-year-of-birth Scottish Mental Survey, 1947 (Deary & Brett,
2015; Deary, Whalley, & Starr, 2009; Maxwell, 1969), who are
described in further detail below. Childhood personality ratings on
the 6-Day Sample have already been linked to later life outcomes.
Deary et al. (2008) found that a measure of low adolescent de-
pendability rated by teachers at about age 14 years—predicted
mortality up to age 66 years, with a hazard ratio per standard
deviation increase of .77 (95% confidence interval [CI]: .63, .94).
This is comparable to other work predicting late-life outcomes
from childhood personality assessments (Friedman et al., 1993,
1995a, 1995b). Although lifelong personality stability has not
previously been assessed, existing evidence of personality stability
from childhood to middle-late adulthood, and from early middle
adulthood to older age suggests that personality shows some
stability across the entire life course. We therefore expected to
observe small to moderate stability of each of the six assessed
personality characteristics, as well as their underlying factor, de-
pendability, from later childhood right through to older age.
To frame this less widely known personality trait within the context
of a more familiar and widely validated model of personality, we
compared childhood and older-age dependability to older-age scores
on the Big Five traits. We also assessed relations between depend-
ability and measures of constructs related to personality, wellbeing
and cognitive ability. We hypothesized that older-age wellbeing
would also show substantial correlations with contemporaneous rat-
ings of dependability, and a weak to moderate association with
childhood dependability. Finally, we hypothesized at least a weak
positive correlation between dependability and intelligence in child-
hood, but that this correlation might be even weaker in older age, and
particularly over the interval of more than six decades.
Method
Participants
The process of selection of the present study’s sample from the
entire cohort of people born in Scotland in 1936 is shown in Figure
1 (adapted from Deary & Brett, 2015, Figure 1, p. 3). The majority
of this cohort who were at school in Scotland on 4th June 1947
(mean age 10.9 years) took part in the Scottish Mental Survey,
1947, which consisted of a 45-min, group-administered intelli-
gence test, the Moray House Test No. Twelve (Scottish Council
for Research in Education [SCRE], 1933, 1949). The 1947 Scottish
Mental Survey tested 70,805 children, that is, almost all Scottish
schoolchildren born in 1936. A subsample of this cohort (N �
1,208) were selected for further study. As they were selected
according to their date of birth being on one of 6 days of 1936—
the 1st of February, April, June, August, October, and December—
the sample became known as the 6-Day Sample. This method of
sampling also meant that the sample was representative of the
cohort (MacPherson, 1958). These 1,208 original 6-Day Sample
members were then studied more thoroughly, almost yearly, until
the age of 27 (Deary et al., 2009). This began with an individually
863
PERSONALITY STABILITY FROM AGE 14 TO AGE 77 YEARS
 administered Stanford-Binet IQ test in 1947, followed by a series
of home visits, during which data on a wide range of environmen-
tal factors were collected. In 1950 (mean age 13.9 years), these
children’s teachers also rated them on six personality characteris-
tics, described in further detail below.
In 2012, we traced as many of the original 6-Day Sample
members as possible through the United Kingdom National Health
Service Central Register. By 2012, 417 of the original sample
members had died, another 89 had emigrated, and 68 could not be
traced. The 635 who were found to be still alive and (with one
exception) resident in Scotland, England, or Wales were invited to
participate in a follow-up study (Brett & Deary, 2014; Deary &
Brett, 2015). Most either declined to participate or did not respond
to the invitation, but in 2013,1 those 174 individuals (92 female;
mean age 76.7 years) who agreed to take part completed a detailed
questionnaire booklet, which, among many other things, incorpo-
rated several questionnaires assessing personality and health. Par-
ticipants who completed the questionnaire booklet were also asked
to take part in a telephone interview, and 131 (72 female; mean age
77.1 years) agreed to do so. During the interview they completed
a number of cognitive tests, based on sealed materials sent via post
in advance (Deary & Brett, 2015). Surviving through to older age
and agreeing to participate in the follow-up study was not random

HARRIS, BRETT, JOHNSON, AND DEARY
 (Johnson, Brett, Calvin, & Deary, 2016). Those 174 who com-
pleted the questionnaire (and particularly those 131 who com-
pleted the telephone interview) had higher cognitive ability scores
as children and were rated by teachers as more dependable, on
average, than the population as a whole (Deary & Brett, 2015).
Further details of participants included at each stage of the study
are shown in Table 1 and further information on the follow-up
subsample in relation to the full original 6-Day Sample can be
found in Johnson et al. (2016).
Measures
Personality characteristics in adolescence and older age.
Around 1950, at about age 14 years, the 6-Day Sample members
were rated on six personality characteristics by their teachers.
These six characteristics—Self-Confidence, Perseverance, Stabil-
ity of Moods, Conscientiousness, Originality, and Desire to Ex-
cel—were selected from the longer list of traits devised by Terman
(1925) for his longitudinal study of over 1,500 gifted children.
Teachers assessed their pupils on each characteristic using a single
item rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from severely lacking to
strongly displaying the characteristic. The six characteristics did
not provide a comprehensive assessment of personality; in fact, the
six items were quite correlated with one another (Self-Confidence:
.01–.35; Perseverance: .11–.72; Stability of Moods: .01–.49; Con-
scientiousness: .01–.72; Originality: .08–.45; Desire to Excel:
.21–.50), which allowed us to reduce them to a single dimension,
which we termed dependability (as previously described; Deary et
al., 2008). This factor only describes one aspect of personality, and
not in terms of currently familiar personality models, such as the
Big Five, which had not been articulated when our assessment was
made. It appears to relate fairly closely to conscientiousness. As is
usual in personality models, dependability did not explain all the
variance in the six characteristics, but they did not provide enough
information to identify additional factors.
Personality was assessed in older age using exactly the same
measure as in childhood. At around age 77 years, those partici-
pants who completed the questionnaire booklet rated themselves
on these same six items using the same rating scale, in relation to
other people of roughly their current age. Participants were also
requested to ask another person who knew them well (a spouse,
friend or family member) to rate them on these characteristics in
the same way. Including this additional set of ratings allowed us to
assess self-other consistency, which could be taken as an index of
validity of each personality measure; these correlations are re-
ported in the Results section. All responses were converted to
numerical values between 1 and 5.
International Personality Item Pool.
Personality was also
assessed at 77 years using the International Personality Item Pool
(IPIP; Goldberg, 1999; Gow, Whiteman, Pattie, & Deary, 2005),
which was also included in the questionnaire booklet. The IPIP
provided measures of Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientious-
ness, Emotional Stability (the polar opposite of Neuroticism), and
Intellect/Imagination (similar to Openness). The version used in
this study comprised 50 items, including five subscales of 10 items
measuring each trait. Each item was a first-person statement, for
example, “I spend time reflecting on things.” Participants rated the
accuracy of each statement, in relation to their own personalities,
on a 5-point scale from 1 (very inaccurate) to 5 (very accurate). In
the current sample, the five subscales showed internal consisten-
cies of .84, .76, .74, .80, and .77, respectively.
Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale.
Mental
wellbeing was assessed using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental
Well Being Scale (WEMWBS; Tennant et al., 2007), another
measure included in the questionnaire booklet. This is a 14-item
questionnaire that asks people to report on their experiences of
positive feelings; for example, “I’ve been feeling optimistic about
the future” and “I’ve been feeling close to other people.” For each
item, participants indicated how often they had felt that way, over

 the prior 2-week period, on a 5-point scale from 1 (none of the
time) to 5 (all of the time). Tennant et al. provide an internal
consistency of .89 and a test–retest reliability of .83 for the
WEMWBS; we also measured internal consistency at .89 in the
current sample.
Satisfaction With Life Scale.
The five-item Satisfaction With
Life Scale (SWLS; Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985),
also included in the questionnaire booklet, was used as an addi-
tional measure of subjective wellbeing. Each item asked partici-
pants to indicate their agreement with a statement about their life
satisfaction on a 7-point scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 7
(strongly disagree). Diener et al. (1985) reported that the SWLS
has an internal consistency of .87 and a test–retest reliability of .82.
In the current sample, we found the internal consistency to be .86.
Terman-Merrill Stanford-Binet Test.
In 1947, at around age
11 years, all members of the 6-Day Sample completed Form L of
Terman and Merrill’s (1937) revision of the Stanford-Binet Test,
providing a measure of childhood intelligence (SB IQ; SCRE,
1947).
Moray House Test No. 12.
Another measure of age-11 intel-
ligence (MHT IQ) was derived from scores on the Moray House
Test No. 12, completed by participants in the Scottish Mental
Survey, 1947. The test is described and reproduced in full by the
SCRE (1933). This is a group-administered test with a preponder-
ance of verbal reasoning items. Whereas all subjects in the 6-Day
sample had SB IQ scores, not all have MHT IQ scores, because 96
of the original 1,208 6-Day Sample participants (including 12 of
those who completed the follow-up questionnaire) were absent
from school on the day of the 1947 Scottish Mental Survey testing.
National Adult Reading Test.
Before the telephone inter-
view, testing materials were sent via post to participants in a sealed
envelope. Verbal ability at age 77 years was measured using the
National Adult Reading Test (NART; Nelson & Willison, 1991),
which involves reading aloud a written list of 50 irregular words.
During the interview, participants were instructed to open the
sealed envelope, remove the list of words and read it aloud. The
number of words pronounced correctly provided a measure of
older-age verbal ability. As reported by Nelson and Willison, the
NART shows high internal consistency (.91) and test–retest reli-
ability (.98).
Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices.
A second cogni-
tive test in older age, also administered by telephone, was Raven’s
Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM; Raven, 1938), a test of
nonverbal reasoning. The RSPM comprises five sets of 12 pro-
gressively more difficult nonverbal problems, each of which asks
participants to select the missing piece of a two-dimensional
pattern from six (sets A and B) or eight (sets C to E) possible
answer options. Participants also received the RSPM question
booklet in the sealed envelope sent out before the telephone
interview, and provided their answers verbally. The number of
correct responses in 20 min provided a measure of fluid cognitive
ability at age 77 years. Raven (1948) assessed the test–retest
reliability of the RSPM in a range of age groups, providing
estimates of up to .93 in young adults and .83 for those aged over
50 years.
Dementia.
Participants who completed the questionnaire
booklet provided details of their health, including whether or not
they had been diagnosed with dementia.
Analysis
Data were analyzed in SPSS Statistics 19, using the accompa-
nying AMOS package for all statistical modeling. Three partici-
pants who reported having been diagnosed with dementia were
excluded from all analyses due to the impact that dementia can
have upon personality (Rubin, Morris, & Berg, 1987; Smith-
Gamble et al., 2002). Other health factors may also impact on
personality, but many of our participants reported at least some
health problems and consistent impacts have rarely been sug-
gested, so we only excluded those with dementia, most likely to
affect personality due to neurodegeneration. Teachers’ ratings of
adolescent characteristics were thought to be heavily influenced by
intelligence (Maxwell, 1969) and were observed to be substantially
correlated with the test scores, so were analyzed both with and
without removing childhood IQ (the mean of the scores derived
from each of the two tests taken at age 11). We used confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA) for dimension reduction of personality char-
acteristics, to assess construct continuity over time and across
raters. Deary et al. (2008) previously subjected the 6-Day Sam-
ple’s adolescent personality characteristic ratings to principal com-
ponent analysis, attributing much of the variability in the data to a
component they denoted dependability. We therefore modeled the
six characteristics as indicators of a single underlying factor, taken
to represent the same trait.
This model was applied to the three sets of ratings—those
provided by teachers (at age 14 years), and participants and others
(at age 77 years)—first with all parameters allowed to be free, and
subsequently with regression weights, intercepts, structural cova-
riances, and residuals progressively constrained to be equal across
the three rater groups. The final model, with residuals as well as all
configural, metric, and scalar parameters constrained, tested strict
invariance of the dependability factor across 63 years and different
rater groups. We repeated this process, testing alternative two-
factor models of the raw and residualized personality characteris-
tics. For each two-factor model, we initially specified paths from
individual characteristics to both underlying factors, except for the
characteristic with the highest loading in the single-factor model,
loading only on the first factor, and that with the lowest single-
factor loading, loading only on the second factor. Weaker paths
were then removed in turn until only six remained, with each
characteristic loading on one underlying factor.
The latent variable scores estimated by the final constrained
single-factor models were then used as our measure of depend-
ability. We assessed personality stability by calculating Spear-
man’s coefficients of correlation between ordinal ratings of each
characteristic provided at different times and by different raters. To
adjust systematic rater bias, we residualized each individual char-
acteristic over the latent dependability factor. We then repeated the
longitudinal and interrater correlations using the residuals for each
characteristic. We also accounted for participants who were not
reassessed in older age by making full information maximum
likelihood (FIML) estimates of the longitudinal stability correla-
tions and older-age interrater correlations. We then calculated
Pearson’s coefficients for correlations between dependability fac-
tors derived from the characteristic ratings provided by each rater,
as well as for correlations between dependability and other mea-
sures of personality, wellbeing and intelligence. We calculated
866
HARRIS, BRETT, JOHNSON, AND DEARY
 95% CIs for each correlation and corrected for multiple compar-
isons according to the Holm-Bonferroni method (Holm, 1979).
As an alternative method of assessing stability of individual
personality characteristics, while controlling systematic rater
group effects, we tested a more complex model of all characteristic
ratings. For each set of six ratings, we modeled an underlying rater
group factor, intended to represent any systematic effects. We also
modeled a latent variable representing each personality character-
istic in older age, with loadings on corresponding self- and other-
ratings constrained equal. Finally, the model included paths from
teachers’ adolescent characteristic ratings to the older-age latent
characteristics, representing the stability of each characteristic over
the 63-year interval.
Results
Personality Construct Continuity
We first ran the CFAs described above to evaluate the degree to
which the ratings reflected a single common underlying construct
across the long time span and different raters. The factor structure
and regression weights are illustrated in Figure 2 and model fit
statistics are presented in Table 2. As shown, the single-factor
model did fit the data, although not perfectly (CFI � .84, RMSEA �
.11), but constraining all parameters equal across rater groups,
testing strict invariance of the dependability factor, did not, over-
all, impair model fit (CFI � 81, RMSEA � .08). Perseverance,
Conscientiousness, and Desire to Excel were strongly associated
with this factor, and Stability of Moods and Originality were
moderately associated. These results were similar to the previous
analyses of the 6-Day Sample’s adolescent characteristic ratings,
which identified a dependability component on which Persever-
ance, Conscientiousness, and Stability of Moods loaded most
heavily (Deary et al., 2008). Dependability therefore represents a
trait describing motivation and diligence; an individual scoring
high on this trait can be depended upon to get things done, to resist
giving up, and perhaps to be more rational than emotional. On the
other hand, confidence in oneself may facilitate this dependability
but is less important.
Repeating this analysis after removing childhood IQ from
teacher ratings produced similar results, with only slightly lower
estimated regression weights, although particularly for Self-
Confidence and Originality (Figure 2). Again, the initial three-
group model fit the data to an extent (CFI � .83, RMSEA � .11),
and constraining all parameters equal across raters did not lead to
an overall loss of fit (CFI � .79, RMSEA � .08). These results
relate to CFAs that included older-age data (self and other ratings)
for the 171 participants who participated in the follow-up and did
not report having been diagnosed with dementia. The CFAs were
repeated including self and other ratings from the three participants
who did report a dementia diagnosis, and differences in the results
were negligible.
We also tested alternative two-factor models of raw and residu-
alized ratings, with Self-Confidence and Originality loading on the
second factor. As reported in online supplementary materials (sup-
plemental Figure S1; supplemental Table S1), these models did not
fit the data as well as the single-factor models (raw ratings: CFI �
.75, RMSEA � .09; residualised ratings: CFI � .74, RMSEA �
.10). Scores on the latent variable estimated by the final con-
strained single-factor model were therefore taken to represent
dependability and used as such in subsequent analyses.

PERSONALITY STABILITY FROM AGE 14 TO AGE 77 YEARS
 Longitudinal Personality Stability Correlations
We next investigated the associations between personality item
characteristic ratings from adolescence, with and without control-
ling childhood IQ, and those provided approximately 63 years
later, by the participants themselves and others who knew them.
Correlations were assessed using Spearman’s coefficient for each
individual personality characteristic, and Pearson’s coefficient for
the underlying dependability factor extracted by CFA. The rela-
tions between older-age characteristic self-ratings and those made
by others were analyzed in the same ways. All correlation coeffi-
cients are reported in Table 3. The strongest positive longitudinal
correlation was between teachers’ and others’ ratings of Stabil-
ity of Moods (p � .12, 95% CI [�.03, .27]; p � .11), but this
did not achieve significance at � � .05, even without correcting
for multiple comparisons and was weaker still (p � .10 [�.05,
.24]; p � .20) for IQ-residualized teacher ratings. There was
one significant longitudinal correlation, between residualized
teachers’ ratings and others’ ratings of Desire to Excel
(p � �.19, 95% CI [�.033, �.04]; p � .04), but this was a
negative correlation and would not have remained significant
after correcting for multiple comparisons. In contrast, correla-
tions between participants’ self-ratings and others’ ratings in
older age were moderate for all characteristics and dependabil-
ity, ranging from .26 (CI [.11, .40]; p � .001) to .48 (CI [.35,
.59]; p � .001). All were significant at � � .001, even after
correcting for multiple comparisons.
We reran the stability correlations for teachers’, participants’
and others’ individual characteristic ratings, after adjusting for
systematic rater bias. We did this by residualizing each of the
individual six characteristics over dependability, which, as the
factor underlying all six ratings, was bound to reflect any rater
bias, as well as considerable content-relevant variance. This did
not have substantial effects on the results (supplemental Table
S2). All correlations between self-ratings and others’ ratings
remained significant, ranging between .20 (CI [.12, .40]; p �
.001) and .42 (CI [.29, .54]; p � .001). There were no signif-
icant longitudinal correlations, although the closest to achieving
significance was between teachers’ and others’ ratings of Con-
scientiousness (r � .13 [�.02, .28]; p � .09). We repeated the
correlations including the three participants with dementia, but
again, this made negligible difference to the results. For all
subsequent analyses, neither controlling rater effects nor ex-
cluding participants with dementia had a substantial effect on
the results. To account for those participants assessed on the six
personality characteristics in adolescence but not in older age,
we also made FIML estimates of the stability correlations.
These estimates did not differ substantially from the calculated
correlation coefficients (supplemental Table S3).
Longitudinal Model of Personality
We modeled all characteristic ratings together as an alternative
method of assessing longitudinal stability of personality (Figure 3).
For each set of ratings, we modeled an underlying rater group
factor, designed to control any systematic effects, whether related
to intelligence or other factors. Individual self- and other-ratings
were modeled as indicators of six latent variables representing
each of the assessed personality characteristics in older age. The
standardized regression weights estimated for paths from each
childhood teacher-rating to each corresponding older-age latent
characteristic were taken to represent the 63-year stability of each
characteristic. Under this model, teachers’ ratings directly re-
flected the corresponding latent characteristics, which in turn di-
rectly determined later self- and other-ratings; a rather strong set of
assumptions about causal relations. The model fit the data fairly
well (CFI � .826; RMSEA � .063; Table 4). As shown in Figure
3 and Table 4, the regression weights representing stability
were �.05 (95% CI [�.26, .15]; p � .62) for Self-Confidence, .05
(CI [�.18, .28]; p � .66) for Perseverance, .26 (CI [.02, .50]; p �
.03) for Stability of Moods, .22 (CI [�.01, .45]; p � .06) for
Conscientiousness, .13 (CI [�.11, .37]; p � .30) for Originality,
and �.16 (CI [�.41, .09]; p � .20) for Desire to Excel. For
Stability of Moods and Conscientiousness, these estimates were
above .2 (and significant or close to achieving significance at p �
.05), indicating stability of these personality characteristics from
childhood to older age.

 between the dependability factor derived from each set of ratings
and scores on the five scales measured by the IPIP. Furthermore,
as four of the Big Five personality traits have been shown to relate
to wellbeing, we also assessed correlations between dependability
and scores on the WEMWBS and SWLS. As shown in Table 5,
dependability in older age, based on participants’ self-ratings,
showed moderate positive correlations with each of the five IPIP
scales, ranging from .24 (CI [.10, .38]; p � .01) for Emotional
Stability to .53 (CI [.41, .63]; p � .001) for Conscientiousness.
Correlations between self-rated dependability in older age and
measures of wellbeing were also moderate, at .54 (CI [.42, .64];
p � .001) and .38 (CI [.24, .50]; p � .001). All these correlations
were significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. De-
pendability derived from others’ ratings also showed moderate
positive correlations with all five IPIP scales and both wellbeing
measures, ranging from .20 (CI [.05, .34]; p � .01) for Emotional
Stability to .36 (CI [.22, .48]; p � .001) for Conscientiousness.
Correlations between teacher-rated dependability and older-age
measures of personality and wellbeing were much weaker, ranging
between �.17 (CI [�.31, �.02]; p � .03) for Conscientiousness
(in the opposite direction to that which we had predicted) and .17
(CI [.02, .31]; p � .03) for Emotional Stability. These were the
only two results that achieved significance at � � .05; neither was
still significant when dependability was derived from residualized
teacher ratings, and nor did they remain significant after correcting
for multiple comparisons.
Personality and Intelligence
Finally, we tested the relations between personality and intelli-
gence over 66 years by calculating the correlations among adoles-

 cent and older-age dependability, two measures of childhood IQ,
and performance on two cognitive tests in older age. These results
are included in Table 5. Contemporaneously, adolescent depend-
ability correlated with SB IQ (r � .39 [.34, .44]; p � .001) and
MHT IQ (r � .38 [.33, .43]; p � .001). Older-age self-rated
dependability only correlated weakly with scores on the NART
(r � .09 [�.08, .26], p � .31) and RSPM (r � .08 [�.10, .25], p �
.40), but for older-age dependability as rated by others, the corre-
lation with NART performance was slightly stronger (r � .17
[�.00, .34], p � .05) and that with RSPM performance was
stronger still (r � .29 [.12, .44], p � .001). Longitudinally, there
was no significant correlation between adolescent dependability
and performance on the RSPM (r � .16 [�.02, .32], p � .08), nor
between either SB IQ (r � .04 [�.11, .19], p � .61) or MHT IQ
(r � .08 [�.08, .23], p � .34) and older-age dependability, as
derived from self-ratings. However, both measures of childhood
IQ predicted older-age dependability when rated by others (SB IQ:
r � .23 [.08, .37], p � .01; MHT IQ: r � .18 [.03, .33], p � .02).
Childhood dependability also predicted performance on the NART
(r � .20 [.03, .36], p � .02), although these correlations did not
remain significant after correcting for multiple comparisons.
Discussion
The main objective of this study was to assess the differential
stability of personality characteristics from late childhood through
to older age, in the eighth decade of life. Our participants were
rated on the same characteristics at around age 14 and again at
around age 77, making this the longest-spanning study of person-
ality stability of which we are aware. We found that personality
characteristic ratings provided by teachers in adolescence, and by
participants and others in older age, all showed a similar underly-
ing structure, with each set able to be reduced to a single factor we
termed dependability. Contrary to our hypotheses, there were no
positive correlations strong enough to achieve significance be-
tween adolescent and older-age characteristic ratings or depend-
ability. However, a more complex model, controlling rater effects,
estimated longitudinal stability effect sizes of more than .2 for two
characteristics, Stability of Moods and Conscientiousness. Older-
age self- and other-rated dependability was, as expected, correlated
with the five other personality scales, particularly Conscientious-
ness, and both wellbeing measures, although we had also expected
adolescent dependability to relate to these later-life measures, and
it did not. We did find some evidence indicating that personality
and intelligence are related throughout the life span; childhood IQ
was correlated with dependability in adolescence, and also pre-
dicted dependability in older age when it was rated by others.
Older-age cognitive ability also showed weak associations with
dependability in older age and in adolescence.
Previous studies have demonstrated relative stability of person-
ality, even over as much as 40 or 50 years, from childhood to
middle age (Haan et al., 1986; Hampson & Goldberg, 2006;
Edmonds et al., 2013), early to late adulthood (Soldz & Vaillant,
1999), and from middle age to older age (Leon et al., 1979). We
hypothesized that we would find evidence of personality stability
over an even longer period of 63 years, but our correlations did not
support this hypothesis, appearing inconsistent with previous re-
sults. One major difference between our study and most previous
studies is that our participants’ later-life characteristic ratings were
provided in older age, rather than middle to late adulthood. The
lack of evidence for personality stability in our study may be
related to the impact of changes in life circumstances, and declines
in physical and cognitive abilities common in older age (Weiss et
al., 2005). However, previous research suggests that personality is
relatively stable over short periods in older age (Mõttus, Johnson,
& Deary, 2012), and even over 30 years from middle age to old
age (Leon et al., 1979).
Our study differed from that of Leon et al. (1979) in assessing
stability from late childhood. Childhood is a period of intense
learning and many new experiences, leading to much more fre-
quent small changes in personality, or much more substantial
changes over time (Caspi & Roberts, 2001; Glenn, 1980). Even
over relatively short periods, test-retest correlations are much
weaker in childhood than in later life (Caspi et al., 2005; Hampson
& Goldberg, 2006; Mõttus et al., 2012; Roberts & DelVecchio,
2000). Adolescence is a particularly dynamic period of personality
development, as individuals tend to become more mature as they
enter adulthood (Blonigen, Carlson, Hicks, Krueger, & Iacono,
2008; Johnson, Hicks, McGue, & Iacono, 2007; Roberts, Caspi, &
Moffitt, 2001). As our participants were first rated at an average
age of around 14, subsequent maturational development likely
contributed substantially to the incongruence between adolescent
and older age characteristic ratings. However, prior studies as-
sessed personality stability from childhood and would therefore
have been affected in the same way, yet they still showed evidence
of greater stability.
Although previous studies have assessed personality stability
either from childhood or from some time in younger adulthood
into older age, to our knowledge, no previous studies have as-
sessed stability over such a long interval, incorporating both pe-
riods of more rapid change in personality. Furthermore, it is
generally recognized that personality continues to change through-
out life, and stability correlations tend to be weaker over longer
intervals (Caspi et al., 2005; Roberts & DelVecchio, 2000). Al-
though our correlational results initially appear inconsistent with

HARRIS, BRETT, JOHNSON, AND DEARY
 previous findings of personality stability over several decades,
these previous studies did not by any means demonstrate perfect
stability, and therefore also provide evidence that personality
changes. Our findings and previous findings, taken together, pro-
vide support for the hypothesis that personality changes gradually
throughout life, which can lead to personality in older age being
quite different from personality in childhood.
Although the correlations did not provide evidence of person-
ality stability from adolescence to older age, a more complex
model did indicate some stability of two characteristics, Stability
of Moods and Conscientiousness. This model included a latent
variable for each set of ratings, which should have controlled
systematic rater group effects better than simply removing IQ from
the teacher-ratings. It also combined older-age self- and other-
ratings, thereby likely representing a better estimate of each as-
sessed characteristic in later life. At the same time, however, it
required rather strong assumptions regarding causal relations
among teacher ratings, and later self- and other-ratings of their
characteristics. This set of assumptions may not have been met but
would tend to increase the likelihood of perceiving stability. None-
theless, at least four of the six characteristics still showed no clear
evidence of stability from age 14 to age 77 years, consistent with
the results of the correlations, and with a conclusion that person-
ality in older age may be quite different from personality in
childhood.
However, Stability of Moods and Conscientiousness did show
moderate 63-year stability under this model, indicating that older-
age personality and childhood personality may not be completely
unrelated. The higher stabilities of these two characteristics in
particular were also consistent with previous research showing
stability of related personality traits, neuroticism/emotional stabil-
ity (Soldz & Vaillant, 1999) and particularly conscientiousness
(Edmonds et al., 2013; Hampson & Goldberg, 2006). Interestingly,
residualizing teacher-rated Stability of Moods reduced its correla-
tion with older-age self-rated Stability of Moods to almost zero,
suggesting that intelligence played a role in the stability of this
characteristic observed in the more complex model. For example,
to the extent it was stable, higher intelligence may have led to
higher actual Stability of Moods through better ability to manage
environmental circumstances to advantage, and could serve as a
resource for emotional stability in older age.
Further, we did find that the structure of personality was fairly
similar across the 63-year interval and three rater groups. We were
able to assess this by CFA as, in contrast to many prior studies of
long-term personality stability, we used the same measures in
older-age that were used in adolescence. Each set of six charac-
teristic ratings was reduced to the same single underlying factor by
CFA, each showing fairly good fit, and better fit than an alternative
two-factor model. Further, all parameters of the model could be
constrained equal across the three sets without a marked loss of fit.
This invariance also indicated validity of dependability as a per-
sonality trait. However, the fit of each model was not perfect,
because not all characteristics were similarly closely related to
dependability. Other aspects of personality must have influenced
variation in these characteristics, but from the data provided by
these six characteristics alone, we could not reliably derive any
additional underlying factors.
Further, differences across raters could have manifested in the
variation of the actual data from the specified model. In particular,
teacher ratings were more closely related to intelligence, while
residualising these ratings likely removed some valid shared vari-
ance with intelligence. Regression weights for Self-Confidence
and Originality were reduced by almost .1, suggesting that these
characteristics were either particularly related to intelligence in
childhood, or particularly susceptible to the influence of intelli-
gence on teachers’ ratings. As raw ratings included the erroneous
influence of intelligence on teacher-ratings, although residualized
ratings may have been missing some valid shared variance with
intelligence, neither derived measure of childhood dependability
was likely to be exactly the same factor as those derived in older
age. The fact that the underlying structure may have varied slightly
across time and rater groups does limit the interpretation of our
results on the stability of dependability. In addition, the individual
characteristics varied in longitudinal stability, which may have
reduced the stability of their common factor.
As dependability is not a commonly used measure of personal-
ity, we also assessed its relation to the Big Five personality traits.
Whether derived from self-ratings or from others’ ratings, depend-
ability was at least modestly related to all five of these other
measures of personality in older age. Although this indicated that
dependability describes an aspect of personality using a different
frame of reference to the five-factor model, it also demonstrated
that it can be represented in terms of these five factors, and fits
within its nomological network. Older-age dependability also cor-
related with both measures of wellbeing, consistent with our hy-
pothesis and with previous work demonstrating close relations
between personality and wellbeing (DeNeve & Cooper, 1998;
Schmutte & Ryffe, 1997; Steel et al., 2008). We had also hypoth-
esized that adolescent dependability would predict measures of
older-age wellbeing, but this hypothesis was not supported. How-
ever, in light of our finding that adolescent dependability did not
significantly predict older-age dependability, it would not neces-
sarily be expected to predict wellbeing either.
Our results did indicate an association between personality and
intelligence over 66 years. Teachers’ characteristic ratings were
related to IQ in childhood, and others’ ratings were related to
cognitive ability in older age. Adolescent dependability also pre-
dicted NART performance in older age, whereas childhood IQ
predicted older-age dependability (when derived from others’ rat-
ings). However, these longitudinal associations reflected the sta-
bility of intelligence, previously demonstrated in the 6-Day Sam-
ple (Deary & Brett, 2015) and the influence of intelligence on
teachers’ and others’ ratings of personality. Childhood dependabil-
ity no longer predicted older-age intelligence when controlling
childhood IQ, and childhood IQ no longer predicted later depend-
ability when controlling older-age intelligence.
In fact, the convolution of teachers’ and others’ characteristic
ratings with contemporaneous measures of intelligence was a
limitation of this study. In contrast to subjective ratings, any
observer ratings of personality are necessarily based on social
interaction and observable behavior, which is guided not only by
personality, but also by cognitive ability. For example, more
intelligent individuals should be better able to understand and
thereby to interact with others, as well as better able to understand
and know how to behave appropriately in different situations. This
illustrates how observers may be influenced by intelligence when
rating personality, an important consideration for future studies of
personality and intelligence. Observers could also be influenced by
871
PERSONALITY STABILITY FROM AGE 14 TO AGE 77 YEARS
 a number of other irrelevant factors, such as appearance, their
opinion of a subject’s family, or prejudices regarding the area in
which a subject lives.
Of course, there were likely differences among individual raters
within each group in how much intelligence (or any of a number
of other factors) influenced their personality ratings. This was
demonstrated by the correlations between self- and other-ratings in
older age, which ranged from .26 to .48. These correlations may
seem low for assessments of the same constructs, but self- and
other-ratings of personality are known to diverge, sometimes sub-
stantially. For example, Watson, Hubbard, and Wiese (2000) ob-
served self-other correlations for ratings on the Big Five traits of
.34 to .48 among friends and .49 to .61 among married couples,
and lower correlations for other personality traits. Vazire (2010)
observed correlations of .20 to .54 participants’ and their friends’
ratings of facets of neuroticism, extraversion and intellect. Our
results were comparable, or perhaps a little lower, but this may be
related to personality change in older age.
Rater bias may have been more consistent among teachers, who
would have all had more similar relationships with the participants to
one another. The teachers’ ratings within their context may make this
up in the form of less measurement error, as the varied circumstances
and relationships to the subject in more general groups of others’
ratings introduce considerable additional sources of measurement
error. Nonetheless, Laidra, Allik, Harro, Merenäkk, and Harro (2006),
who assessed personality ratings completed by a group of over 500
adolescents, their parents and their teachers, found that teachers’
ratings were least closely related to those of other raters. This may
have been due to a relatively consistent bias among all teachers; a halo
effect that could be expected to lead teachers to rate pupils who
performed better academically as higher on the six personality char-
acteristics as well. Previous evidence does suggest that halo effects
influence teachers’ opinions of their pupils (Abikoff, Courtney, Pel-
ham, & Koplewicz, 1993) and, more specifically, that teachers’ per-
sonality ratings are related to academic achievement (Scandette &
Richter, 1971).
Among the 6-Day Sample, teacher ratings were indeed moderately
correlated with childhood IQ, a bias we attempted to control by
residualizing teacher ratings over IQ. This still may not have made
their ratings any more comparable to those provided by participants
themselves and their friends and relatives, because each rater type is
subject to different kinds of bias. However, the Hawaii cohort studies
discussed above also used teacher ratings of personality in childhood,
and found that they were predictive of self-ratings (Hampson &
Goldberg, 2006) and peer ratings (Edmonds et al., 2013) of person-
ality in middle age. Similarly, Pulkkinen, Kokko, and Rantanen
(2012) were able to predict personality at age 42 from teacher ratings
in childhood and adolescence. Furthermore, in contrast to the findings
of Laidra et al. (2006); Baker, Victor, Chambers, and Halverson
(2004) found that, in a sample of 165 students of a small high school,
teacher ratings of the Big Five personality factors were particularly
reliable in comparison to self and peer ratings.
Finally, our more complex model, which should have better
controlled for systematic effects of rater group, did indicate some
possible stability of Conscientiousness and Stability of Moods.
Although the model required rather strong causal assumptions, for
which independent evidence would need to be developed, the
results suggested that rater effects could have distorted the corre-
lational results for these characteristics. However, the stability
estimates for these two characteristics were still fairly low,
whereas the estimated stabilities of the other four characteristics
were even lower, suggesting that weakness of the longitudinal
correlations could not be attributed solely to rater bias.
This study was limited by the representativeness of the follow-up
sample. Although the original 6-Day Sample included 1,208 partici-
pants, almost perfectly representative of the entire cohort of Scottish
people born in 1936, not all of the original participants were able and
willing to take part in the follow-up study. However, the follow-up
sample was less representative, as inclusion depended on the original
members having survived to age 77 years, and being both able and
willing to participate. Those who were still alive and who volunteered
to participate were, on average, more intelligent and more dependable
(Johnson et al., 2016). Variances in childhood IQ and dependability in
our follow-up sample were reduced to 53% and 82%, respectively, of
the original variances in the entire sample. This was not specific to the
6-Day Sample follow-up study’s recruitment or assessment methods,
as variance in relations to mortality would be similarly subject to
effect by restriction of population-representativeness of sample in this
age group. However, the reduction in variance may have led to
underestimation of the stability of personality characteristics.
A related limitation was that the follow-up sample of 171
participants may have been too small to detect any significant
stability of personality, as some of the correlations observed would
have achieved significance if observed in a larger sample. How-
ever, this sample size still provided enough power to detect small
correlations of around .2, and a larger sample would not of course
be expected to increase the strength of the correlations. Regardless
of significance, the relative stability correlations we observed were
much weaker than those of previous studies of personality stability
over shorter periods. The sample size, however, had very low
power to assess measurement invariance. This was compounded
by the rather poor fits of the models. Thus, the conclusion that
dependability was measured in the same way across the 63 years
should be considered tentative.
One further limitation of the study is the number of items used to
assess personality both in adolescence and in older age. Each char-
acteristic was measured by a single item, meaning that the underlying
factor, dependability, was derived from only six items. Single-item
assessments of personality are sometimes useful, particularly when
personality is not the primary focus of a study, and therefore does not
warrant more extensive assessment (as was the case in the original
6-Day Sample study). Furthermore, Woods and Hampson (2005)
assessed the test-retest reliabilities of their single-item measures of
personality (SIMPs) over periods of between a month and a year,
observing mean correlations of between .060 for agreeableness and
.78 for extraversion. Spörrle and Bekk (2014) observed slightly higher
mean reliabilities of between .71 for agreeableness and .81 for extra-
version using the same SIMPs translated into German. However, the
short-term stability of ratings on the characteristics used in the present
study has not been assessed, and it is unlikely to be as high as that of
multi-item measures of more established personality factors. The
reliability of the assessed characteristics may also be lower in older
age, particularly if aging-related cognitive and physical impairments
affect individuals’ abilities to provide accurate ratings, but again, this
has not been established. It is possible that we may have found more
evidence for personality stability had the original assessment of ado-
lescent personality been more extensive. Finally, we had access to
assessments of personality at only two time points; including addi-
872

 tional intermediary assessments would help future studies identify
how personality changes throughout life. With personality assess-
ments at additional time points, lifelong change could be assessed
using nonlinear trajectories, which may be more appropriate.
In this study, we assessed the stability of personality over an
interval of 63 years, from adolescence through to older age. We
observed that individual differences in personality characteristics
in later life were not closely related to the same traits in early life.
Controlling rater-group effects did reveal marginally significant
and near-significant stability of two of the six assessed personality
characteristics at the expense of imposing other assumptions, but
results generally indicated very low stability of personality from
age 14 to age 77 years. Previous studies have demonstrated that
personality is subject to a lifelong series of relatively small changes—
particularly in adolescence and early adulthood, but continuing
even into older age. As a result of this gradual change, personality
can appear relatively stable over short intervals—increasingly so
throughout adulthood. However, the longer the interval between
two assessments of personality, the weaker the relationship be-
tween the two tends to be. Our results suggest that, when the
interval is increased to as much as 63 years, there is hardly any
relationship at all. If so, personality changes only gradually
throughout life, but by older age it may be quite different from
personality in childhood. Future studies should focus on develop-
ing better understanding of how and why personality changes
throughout the life course.
