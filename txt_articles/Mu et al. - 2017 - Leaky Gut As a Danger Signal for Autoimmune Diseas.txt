The intestinal epithelial lining, together with factors secreted from it, forms a barrier that 
separates the host from the environment. In pathologic conditions, the permeability of 
the epithelial lining may be compromised allowing the passage of toxins, antigens, and 
bacteria in the lumen to enter the blood stream creating a “leaky gut.” In individuals 
with a genetic predisposition, a leaky gut may allow environmental factors to enter 
the body and trigger the initiation and development of autoimmune disease. Growing 
evidence shows that the gut microbiota is important in supporting the epithelial barrier 
and therefore plays a key role in the regulation of environmental factors that enter the 
body. Several recent reports have shown that probiotics can reverse the leaky gut by 
enhancing the production of tight junction proteins; however, additional and longer term 
studies are still required. Conversely, pathogenic bacteria that can facilitate a leaky gut 
and induce autoimmune symptoms can be ameliorated with the use of antibiotic treat-
ment. Therefore, it is hypothesized that modulating the gut microbiota can serve as a 
potential method for regulating intestinal permeability and may help to alter the course of 
autoimmune diseases in susceptible individuals.

iNTRODUCTiON
For digestion and absorption purposes, mammals have developed a very complicated and highly 
specialized gastrointestinal system maintained by the mucosal barrier (1). However, apart from 
absorbable nutrients, the intestinal mucosa also faces tremendous exterior antigens, including food 
antigens, commensal bacteria, pathogens, and toxins. Thus, a specialized barrier function is required 
to block the entry of diverse exterior antigens while absorbing nutrients. Impressively, in the intes-
tine, the front line of this barrier is maintained by only a single layer of specialized epithelial cells that 
are linked together by tight junction (TJ) proteins. Many other factors aid in support of this barrier 
including mucins, antimicrobial molecules, immunoglobulins, and cytokines. If any abnormalities 
occur among these factors, the intestinal permeability may increase, which is termed a “leaky gut.” A 
leaky gut allows the entry of exterior antigens from the gut lumen into the host, which may promote 
both local and systemic immune responses. Multiple diseases may arise or be exacerbated due to 
a leaky gut, including autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, 
autoimmune hepatitis, type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) (2–6). Numerous factors can affect gut permeability, such as various diet-derived compounds, 
alcohol consumption, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. While this review is focused on chronic inflam-
mation and gut barrier functions in mammals, it is worth noting that leaky gut is a phenomenon 
that is widespread in both mammalian and non-mammalian animals (7). Thus, studies in systems

outside of mammals, such as zebrafish (7, 8), can be also helpful 
in our understanding of the relationship between inflammation 
and the intestinal barrier.
The gut microbiota has drawn intense attention in the past 
decade (9). Although scientists have studied gut microbiota for 
many years, recent advancements in molecular biology including 
next-generation sequencing technology has enabled researchers 
to gain new insight in this research field. While we are still far away 
from clearly understanding the exact roles and effecting modes of 
gut microbiota, growing evidence suggests that gut microbiota is 
important in modulating gut permeability and intestinal barrier 
functions. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the 
understanding of the leaky gut, bacterial translocation, and gut 
microbiota dysbiosis, with a particular focus on their association 
with extraintestinal autoimmune diseases, such as T1D and SLE.
THe iNTeSTiNAL BARRieR
A large variety of exogenous substances colonize the gut lumen, 
such as microorganisms, toxins, and antigens. Without an intact 
and properly functioning intestinal barrier, these substances 
can penetrate the tissues beneath the intestinal epithelial lining, 
diffuse into blood and lymphatic circulations, and disrupt tissue 
homeostasis. However, there is an efficient multifaceted intestinal 
barrier system with physical, biochemical, and immunological 
components that prevents the entry of most pathogens (Figure 1). 
These components coordinate with each other to prevent uncon-
trolled translocation of luminal contents into the body. Below is a 
brief synopsis of the main components comprising the intestinal 
barrier.
Physical Barrier
In humans, the intestinal epithelium covers as large as 400 m2 of 
surface area (1). Though only a single layer of cells, the intestinal 
epithelial cells (IECs) are the mainstay of the intestinal barrier 
and serve as a physical barrier (Figure 1). There are at least seven 
types of functional IECs—enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, 
microfold cells (M cells), enteroendocrine cells, cup cells, and tuft 
cells, although the functions of the last two cell populations are 
not well understood (10). Among all these cell types, enterocytes 
represent the absolute majority, accounting for at least 90% of 
crypt cells or villus cells. Enterocytes are absorptive cells and vital 
for nutrient uptake. However, growing evidence indicates that the 
functions of enterocytes are not limited to nutrient absorption. 
For example, enterocytes can control the abundance of Gram-
positive bacteria by expressing RegIIIγ, one type of antimicrobial 
proteins (AMPs) (11–13). All epithelial cell types originate from 
Lgr5+ intestinal epithelial stem cells, which reside within the 
crypts (14). The turnover rate of IECs is high and the cells are 
renewed every 3–5 days in the mammalian intestine (10, 15), with 
the exception being the Paneth cells, which have a life span of 
about 2 months.
The IEC lining is continuous, and the contact between IECs is 
sealed by TJs (16). The paracellular pathway, in contrast to tran-
scellular pathway, allows the transport of substances across the 
gut epithelium through the spaces between IECs. A large variety 
of molecules, mainly proteins, control the plasticity of TJs. More 
than 40 TJ proteins have been recognized, including occludin, 
claudins, junctional adhesion molecule A, and tricellulin (17). 
Under various pathological conditions, paracellular permeability 
may be increased, resulting in the entry of unwelcome, potentially 
harmful molecules.
On top of the gut epithelium, there are two layers of mucus, 
the inner and outer layers, that cover the whole intestinal epithe-
lial lining and provide physical protection to separate luminal 
microorganisms from the epithelium. Organized by its major 
component, a highly glycosylated gel-forming mucin MUC2, 
the mucus contains diverse molecules including IgA as well as 
enzymes and proteins, such as lactoferrin (18). Goblet cells are 
the central cell type for the formation of mucus. They not only 
produce MUC2 mucin but also secret other mucus components 
such as ZG16, AGR2, FCGBP, CLCA1, and TFF3 (19, 20). Colitis 
would spontaneously develop in Muc2-deficient mice, indicat-
ing a critical role for MUC2 in mucosal protection (21). In addi-
tion to gel-forming mucins, there is another type of mucin that 
is in close proximity to epithelial cells, called transmembrane 
mucins. Enterocytes are the main producers of transmembrane 
mucins (20).
The gut commensal bacteria have been described as one 
component of the intestinal physical barrier primarily due to 
its two major functions (22). The first is to promote resistance 
to the colonization of harmful or pathogenic bacteria species 
by competing for nutrients, occupying attachment sites, and 
releasing antimicrobial substances (23, 24). Additionally, the gut 
microbiota regulates the digestion and absorption of nutrients to 
supply energy to epithelial cells, which are a major component 
of the physical barrier (25). A good example of the direct energy 
supply is the production of short-chain fatty acids by the gut 
microbiota, which are used by colonocytes for their development 
and metabolism (26). Taken together, IECs, the mucus layers, 
and gut microbial residents serve as the physical barrier to limit 
the entry of unfriendly luminal contents into host tissues.
Biochemical Barrier
Biochemical molecules with antimicrobial properties exist in 
the mucus as well as far into the lumen and include bile acids 
and AMPs (27, 28) (Figure 1). These diverse molecules form a 
complicated network to reduce the load of colonized bacteria 
and decrease the chance of contact between luminal antigens 
and host cells. They are a good supplement to the physical 
barrier and an essential component of the intestinal barrier 
function.
The proximal small intestine harbors very few microorgan-
isms (29). But as the distance from the stomach increases, the 
pH rises and the number of colonized bacteria esculates (30). 
Facing a large number of microorganisms, which likely out-
number the number of host cells, multiple AMPs are generated 
to fight against invaders. These AMPs are divided into several 
types, including α- and β-defensins, C-type lectin, cathelici-
din, lysozyme, and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) (27). 
Their detailed antimicrobial mechanisms are discussed else-
where (31). As a major, but not exclusive, producer of AMPs, 
Paneth cells support and mediate the biochemical barrier 
 
function.

immunological Barrier
Below the intestinal epithelium, there are organized lymphoid 
follicles, including the Peyer’s patches and isolated lymphoid 
follicles. Inside the follicles, a variety of immune cells, including 
B cells, T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and neutrophils, orchestrate 
the immune response by presenting antigens, secreting cytokines, 
and producing antigen-binding antibodies (Figure 1). In the 
intestinal epithelium where lymphoid follicles are found, M cells 
are present that transcytose antigens across the intestinal epithe-
lium to the Peyer’s patches underneath (14). In addition, goblet 
cells present acquired luminal antigens to CD103+ DCs in lamina 
propria in small intestine by forming goblet cell-associated anti-
gen passages (GAPs) (32, 33). Interestingly, spontaneous antigen 
presentation was also observed in the colon, but only when the 
mice were raised germ-free (GF), or housed conventionally but 
with oral antibiotic treatment (34). This suggests that the antigen 
uptake process and formation of GAPs are regulated by the 
colonic microbiota (35). In addition, goblet cells and GAPs are 
capable of sensing invasive pathogens and inhibiting the translo-
cation of pathogenic bacteria into the host immune system (36). 
Furthermore, intestinal mononuclear phagocytescan sense and 
sample luminal contents (37, 38). CX3CR1-expressing cells are 
responsible for this process, and antigen sampling is dependent 
on structures called transepithelial dendrites (TEDs) (39, 40). The 
formation of TEDs is regulated by CX3CR1+ macrophages and 
the expression of CX3CL1 by certain IECs (41, 42).
Another component of the immunological barrier is secre-
tory IgA (SIgA). As the most abundant immunoglobulin in 
the body, IgA resides primarily on intestinal mucosal surfaces. 
While some people with selective IgA deficiency appear to 
be healthy, SIgA is important as it presumably interacts with 
commensal bacteria to provide protection against pathogens. 
A unique feature about SIgA is that is structurally resilient in 
protease-rich environments allowing it to remain functionally 
active compared to other antibody isotypes on mucosal surfaces 
(43). In adult humans, about 50 mg/kg of SIgA is produced daily 
by plasma cells residing in the intestinal lamina propria. Finally, 
SIgA can be transcytosed through the epithelium and secreted 
into the gut lumen.
Though not mentioned here, self-modulating factors, such as 
nerves and diverse cytokines, are also important for maintaining 
the normal functions of the intestinal barrier.

GUT MiCROBiOTA AND THe iNTeSTiNAL 
BARRieR
Microbiota can be sensed by the host through pattern recognition 
receptors (PRRs), such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucle-
otide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors 
(NLRs). In the gut, the bacteria–host communications are largely 
dependent on the recognition of microbe-associated molecular 
patterns by PRRs expressed on immune and non-immune cells. 
Certain microbiota, bacterial products, and metabolites affect the 
intestinal barrier function and are responsible for the subsequent 
breakdown of tissue homeostasis. When there is a leaky gut, 
commensal bacteria in gut lumen, together with their products, 
are able to escape the lumen of the gut, which may induce inflam-
mation and cause systemic tissue damages if translocated into 
peripheral circulation (Figure 1). This process of translocation is 
called microbial translocation (44).
Evidence from GF animals suggests that the development and 
function of the intestinal barrier are dependent on microbiota. 
In GF animals, due to the lack of bacterial stimulations, the 
thickness of the mucus layers is extremely reduced (45–48). The 
important role of gut microbiota in modulating mucin produc-
tion from goblet cells is further evidenced in animals with lower 
loads of bacteria (49, 50). The thinner mucus layers would allow 
for bacteria penetration, which may initiate inflammation and 
inflammatory diseases such as colitis (46, 51). Commensal bac-
teria, or bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 
peptidoglycan, can restore the mucus layers (46, 47). A balance 
exists between commensal bacteria and the mucus layers, and 
together they contribute to the maintenance of gut homeostasis 
(48). Within the mucus layers, there are diverse secreted AMPs 
that can clear pathogens and control the colonization of com-
mensal bacteria. Reciprocally, the production of some AMPs 
is regulated by microbiota and/or their products. For instance, 
RegIIIγ is the AMP necessary for physically separating com-
mensal bacteria from intestinal epithelium (11). RegIIIγ has been 
shown to be suppressed in alcoholic patients and mice receiving 
ethanol treatment (52, 53). Prebiotics administration, or increas-
ing probiotic Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, has been shown to 
restore the properties of RegIIIγ and control bacterial overgrowth 
(53). Ang4, a member of angiogenin family, is another example 
where gut commensals are known to modulate AMP production. 
In one study, Gordon and coworkers found that the production 
and secretion of Ang4 from mouse Paneth cells were induced by 
a predominant gut microflora, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (54). 
Therefore, the antibacterial activity of Ang4 against microbes 
in gut lumen is, in turn, dependent on the existence of certain 
commensal species.
In addition, an interaction exists between gut microbes and 
AMPs, such as IAP. Predominately produced by IECs, IAP is 
active either anchored on the epithelium membrane or secreted 
into gut lumen (55, 56). In IAP-deficient mice, it was noted that 
there were fewer microbes and an altered bacteria composition 
compared to control wild-type animals. In particular, the research-
ers noted a decrease in Lactobacillaceae (57, 58). Upregulated 
IAP activity can selectively increase LPS-suppressing bacteria 
(e.g., Bifidobacterium), while reducing LPS-producing bacteria 
 
(e.g., Escherichia coli) (59). Having the capacity to inactivate LPS 
in vivo, IAP is vital in preventing the translocation of LPS, the 
pro-inflammatory stimulus originated from bacteria (60, 61). Of 
note, the expression of IAP relies on the presence of microbiota. 
In GF zebrafish, the colonization of commensals, or even sup-
plying LPS alone, could sufficiently induce IAP expression (62). 
It is worth mentioning that IAP can also regulate TJ proteins to 
enhance barrier function through increasing ZO-1, ZO-2, and 
occludin expression (63). Several others have also reported on 
the various types of AMPs and their function in the microbiota 
(64, 65).
Intestinal epithelial cells compose the single layer of intestinal 
epithelium, and the generation of new IECs from local intestinal 
stem cells is vital in maintaining the barrier function due to the 
high frequency of apoptosis and shedding of IECs (66). As much 
as 10% of all the gene transcriptions, especially genes related 
to immunity, cell proliferation, and metabolism, in IECs are 
regulated by gut microbiota (67). In GF and antibiotic-treated 
mice, epithelial proliferation rate is reduced, suggesting the role 
of microbiota on epithelium cell renewal (68, 69). LPS from 
 
E. coli can induce cell shedding in a dose-dependent manner 
 
(70, 71). Colonization of Bifidobacterium breve, or more precisely 
its surface component, exopolysaccharide, can positively modu-
late LPS-induced epithelium cell shedding through epithelial 
MyD88 signaling (70). The renewal of IECs relies on the activ-
ity of intestinal stem cells that are located at the base of crypts 
and express TLR4, the LPS receptor. TLR4 activation has been 
demonstrated to inhibit proliferation and promote the apoptosis 
of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells. In mice bearing selective TLR4 
deletion in intestinal stem cells, LPS is no longer able to inhibit 
the renewal of IECs (72). This process was found to be mediated 
by the p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) as TLR4 
activation in mice lacking PUMA was unaltered. Apart from LPS, 
bacterial metabolites, particularly butyrate, have also been iden-
tified as inhibitors of intestinal stem cell proliferation (73). The 
intestinal crypt architecture protects the intestinal stem cells from 
the negative effect of butyrate. As gatekeepers for the paracellular 
pathway, TJ complexes are also major targets of microbiota regu-
lation (74). This is particularly true for certain probiotic species 
including, but not limited to, Lactobacillus rhamnosus (75–78), 
Streptococcus thermophilus (79), Lactobacillus reuteri (80), and 
Bifidobacterium infantis (81).
MeCHANiSMS OF LeAKY GUT
A large variety of gut barrier disruptors and/or gut microbiota 
disturbers may potentially result in microbial translocation and 
subsequent inflammation locally and systemically. These include 
diet, infections, alcohol consumption, and burn injury.
Diet-induced Gut Leakiness
Nutrients and food ingredients have been reported to contribute 
to the maintenance or alterations of gut microbiota and the 
intestinal barrier function (82). A recent review by De Santis 
et al. detailed many dietary factors that may modulate the 
intestinal barrier (83). Here, we review some recent publications 
and emphasize the effects of diet-induced alterations of gut 
 5

microbiota on compromising the gut barrier function. Vitamin 
D (VD) has been recognized as an intestinal permeability 
protector by inducing the expression of TJ proteins ZO-1 and 
claudin-1. In VD receptor (VDR)-knockout mice, more severe 
experimental colitis has been observed, suggesting the protec-
tive effect of VD on the mucosal barrier (84). However, another 
group have recently found that VDR deficiency lowers, whereas 
VD treatment upregulates, the expression of claudin-2, a pore-
forming TJ protein, which renders the intestinal epithelium leaky 
(85). Further analysis confirmed that VDR enhanced claudin-2 
promoter activity. The exact role of VD and VDR on modulating 
intestinal permeability is therefore unclear and should be inves-
tigated carefully in association with gut microbiota. In a recent 
study by Desai et al., a low-fiber diet consumption was found to 
trigger the expansion of mucus-degrading bacteria, including 
Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides caccae (45). As a result, 
the thickness of mucus is significantly decreased in mice fed with 
fiber-deficient diets, although the transcription of Muc2 gene was 
surprisingly heightened, possibly as a compensatory response. 
The thinner mucus and compromised intestinal barrier function 
lead to a higher susceptibility to certain colitis-causing pathogens 
(45). Moreover, a diet high in saturated fat has been shown to 
greatly decrease Lactobacillus and increase Oscillibacter, and these 
changes were correlated with significantly increased permeability 
in the proximal colon (86). Furthermore, studies revealed that 
the abundance of the Oscillospira genus was negatively correlated 
with the mRNA expression of barrier-forming TJ protein ZO-1.
Stress-induced Gut Leakiness
Under certain circumstances, stress-induced alterations of gut 
microbiota and the impaired intestinal barrier would allow the 
occurrence of microbial translocation. Burn injury and alcohol 
consumption are examples of such stress. Burn injury results in 
increased intestinal permeability, which is mediated by increased 
activity of myosin light-chain (MLC) kinase (87, 88). It is known 
that MLC phosphorylation or kinase activation can trigger epi-
thelial TJ opening (89–91). In burn injury, TJ proteins, including 
ZO-1, occluding, and claudin-1, are redistributed, which can 
be reversed by adding an MLC phosphorylation inhibitor (87). 
In addition, both humans and mice experiencing burn injury 
undergo similar alterations of gut microbiota, in particular, with 
increases of the abundance of bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae 
family (88). Importantly, microbial translocation of these Gram-
negative aerobic bacteria has been observed. Another research 
group, using a different burn injury mouse model reported 
increased colonic permeability together with reduced aerobic 
and anaerobic bacterial populations in the gut microbiota, par-
ticularly those producing butyrate (92). As a consequence, the 
butyrate level in the stool was significantly decreased in mice with 
burn injury. Interestingly, when the experimental mice received 
fecal microbiota transplant, their altered bacterial counts and 
impaired mucosal barrier function were reversed, suggesting 
direct involvement of microbiota in causing gut leakiness after 
burn injury.
Chronic alcohol consumption is responsible for intestinal 
barrier dysfunction, alterations on both the quality and quantity 
of gut microbiota, LPS translocation, and alcoholic liver disease 
(ALD). In both human and mouse, it has been well established 
that alcohol can disrupt intestinal barrier function, which is 
closely related to increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) produc-
tion from intestinal monocytes/macrophages and enterocytes 
bearing TNF-receptor 1, followed by downstream activation of 
MLC kinase (93). Notably, when mice given chronic alcohol also 
received oral antibiotic treatment, to remove the microbiota, the 
level of TNF production and intestinal permeability decreased 
to levels comparable to those in control mice (93). This indicates 
that the alcohol-induced, TNF-mediated gut leakiness is greatly 
dependent on gut microbiota. Indeed, though the mechanism is 
unknown, alcohol administration alters microbiota qualitatively 
and quantitatively in both human and mouse (94). Bacterial 
 
overgrowth has been observed with alcohol consumption, 
whereas antibiotics can decrease the bacterial load and attenu-
ate ALD (53, 93, 95–97). Interestingly, probiotic Lactobacillus is 
significantly suppressed during alcohol consumption (53, 97). 
Directly supplying Lactobacillus strains or indirect stimulation of 
Lactobacilli with prebiotics or diets can decrease bacterial over-
growth, restore mucosal integrity of the intestine, and suppress 
microbial translocation (53, 94, 98, 99). Microbial translocation, 
especially the translocation of LPS, is involved in ALD develop-
ment and progression as evidenced by the lack of ALD in mice 
deficient of TLR4 (100, 101). It is worth noting that some bacteria 
species can produce alcohol, including E. coli and Weissella con-
fusa, and this may be the mechanism by which they compromise 
the intestinal barrier function (102, 103).
Infections can play a role in regulating the mucosal barrier. A 
good example is Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative bacterium 
infecting the human stomach (104). H. pylori is known to directly 
increase epithelial permeability by redistributing TJ protein ZO-1 
(105, 106). In addition, bacteriophages, which are usually not 
considered pathogenic to mammals, can have an impact on the 
leaky gut. When rats were given a bacteriophage cocktail contain-
ing phages against Salmonella enterica, disruption of the intestinal 
barrier integrity was observed (107). The authors speculated that 
the gut microbiota might have been affected by bacteriophages, 
but sequencing data were not supplied to support their claims.
Taken together, perturbation of gut microbiota, which may be 
the consequence of diverse interventions, can lead to increased 
intestinal permeability and translocation of bacterial components 
and products. Such microbial translocation can subsequently 
trigger an abnormal immune response, causing inflammation 
and/or tissue damage in extraintestinal organs.
LeAKY GUT AND AUTOiMMUNe 
DiSORDeRS
Several disease states have been associated with gut microbiota 
dysbiosis, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and microbial trans-
location. These include Alzheimer’s disease, ALD, cancer, and 
multiple autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders are 
characterized by the generation of autoantibodies against self-
antigens that attack the body’s own tissues, resulting in damage. 
Genetic and environmental triggers have been long known as 
the major contributors to the development of autoimmunity.

Increasing evidence in recent years suggests that microbial 
 
translocation and intestinal barrier dysfunction, which may be 
affected by gut microbiota, are another important causative ele-
ment for autoimmune disorders (2–6). T1D and SLE are examples 
discussed below that reveal advancements in the understanding 
of the mechanisms behind the interaction between the leaky gut 
and autoimmune disorders.
Type 1 Diabetes
Type 1 diabetes is an organ-specific autoimmune disorder chara-
cterized by an autoimmune response against the host’s own pan-
creatic β cells, leading to insufficient insulin production from the 
pancreas (108). Some argue that the leaky gut is only an outcome of 
disease progression rather than an initiator or exacerbator of disease 
(109), but this should not be the case for T1D. This is supported 
by the following evidences. First, studies utilizing human subjects 
affected by T1D or T1D-prone animal models have indicated that 
impaired intestinal barrier function occurs before disease onset 
(110–112). Second, the pathogenic role that increased intestinal 
permeability plays in T1D is zonulin-dependent, and the produc-
tion of zonulin relies on bacterial colonization (113). Reversion 
of intestinal barrier dysbiosis by adding a zonulin inhibitor ame-
liorated T1D manifestations in disease-prone rats (114). Third, a 
recent study has provided evidence that microbial translocation 
contributes to T1D development (115). In streptozotocin-induced 
T1D, mice treated with streptozotocin harbor a distinct microbiota 
compared to vehicle-treated controls. Importantly, gut bacteria 
were shown to be able to translocate into pancreatic lymph nodes 
(PLNs) and contribute to T1D development (115). When mice 
were treated with oral antibiotics, PLNs appeared to be sterile 
and the disease was attenuated. Further analysis revealed that 
the translocated bacteria in PLNs triggered NOD2 activation and 
exacerbated T1D. Altogether, these results suggest an essential role 
for the leaky gut in driving the progression of T1D.
Systemic Lupus erythematosus
Systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, is an autoimmune 
disorder characterized by severe and persistent inflammation 
that leads to tissue damage in multiple organs (116). Although 
SLE affects both men and women, women of childbearing age 
are diagnosed about nine times more often than men. LPS, a cell 
wall component of Gram-negative bacteria, can promote SLE 
development and disease progression upon penetration of the 
intestinal epithelium and translocation into tissues (117). In SLE 
patients, the higher level of soluble CD14 suggests an increase 
in LPS, as soluble CD14 is released from monocytes when the 
cells are exposed to LPS (118). Activation of TLR4 exacerbates 
lupus development (119–121). Mice spontaneously develop lupus 
when TLR4 responsiveness is increased, whereas the exacerbated 
disease phenotype can be significantly ameliorated when the 
commensal gut flora is removed by antibiotic treatment (121). 
This clearly indicates that TLR4 hyperresponsiveness to gut flora 
(which contains LPS) contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE. 
Moreover, the development of lupus in wild-type mice (C57BL/6 
or BALB/c) immunized with phospholipid-binding proteins can 
be facilitated by the administration of LPS (122–124). Conversely, 
inhibition of TLR4 results in reduced autoantibody production 
and lowered renal glomerular IgG deposits in lupus-prone mice 
(125, 126). Taken together, these data suggest that LPS stimula-
tion and TLR4 activation as disease-initiating factors for SLE. 
Lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a component of the Gram-positive 
bacterial cell wall, can also promote lupus disease. The expression 
of TLR2, the receptor of LTA, has been reported to be increased in 
SLE patients (127). In lupus-prone mice, TLR2 activation triggers 
lupus nephritis, whereas TLR2 knockout attenuates lupus-like 
symptoms (125, 128–130). Recently, another bacterial antigen 
that may mimic self-antigens has been recognized to induce 
autoantibody production (131).
Several downstream proteins in the TLR signaling cascade 
are highly relevant to the pathogenesis of SLE and are potential 
therapeutic targets, including MyD88, IRAKs, and IFNα (132). 
Deficiency of MyD88, in particular, has been shown to ameliorate 
lupus disease in MRL/lpr mice (133, 134), suggesting a potential 
role for TLRs to communicate with harmful bacteria in the gut 
microbiota. Conversely, there is a paucity of data pertaining to 
members of the NLR family. The most extensively characterized 
NLRs are associated with inflammasome formation (135, 136). 
Loss of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome function was found to 
significantly contribute to lupus pathogenesis (137). Interestingly, 
both of these inflammasomes were found compromised in NZB 
mice, a lupus-prone model. Consistent with this finding, loss of 
ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD), 
a common adaptor protein required for inflammasome forma-
tion in B6-Faslpr mice led to exacerbation of lupus-like disease 
(138). These results suggest a potential role for NLRs to recognize 
protective bacteria in the gut microbiota. Therefore, it appears 
that TLRs and NLRs make distinct contributions to lupus patho-
genesis by sensing harmful and protective bacteria, respectively. 
Both types of bacteria can come from gut microbiota through 
microbial translocation, especially in the presence of a leaky gut.
ReveRSiNG THe LeAKY GUT AS A 
POTeNTiAL THeRAPY
Considering the contributions of leaky gut and bacterial translo-
cation to inflammation and multiple diseases, reversing gut leaki-
ness appears to be an attractive therapeutic strategy. Prebiotics 
and probiotics, for example, can be used to reduce intestinal 
permeability (139). Diverse probiotic species have been uncov-
ered that possess the properties to protect the intestinal barrier 
through targeting different components of the mucosal barrier 
system. The human commensal Bacteroides fragilis may serve 
as such a probiotic (140). In a mouse model, autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD) has been shown to be accompanied by intestinal 
barrier dysfunction, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and leakiness of 
4-ethylphenylsulfate (4EPS), which originates from the commen-
sal bacteria. When 4EPS was given to wild-type mice, it directly 
caused behavioral abnormalities similar to ASD mice. Treatment 
with B. fragilis reduced the translocation of disease-causative 
4EPS, and significantly ameliorated the behavior defects. The 
therapeutic benefit of B. fragilis is believed to be due to its ability to 
alter microbial composition and enhance intestinal barrier func-
tion (140). B. fragilis is also known for its capability to induce the

development of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, a process regulated by 
another product of B. fragilis, polysaccharide A (PSA) (141, 142). 
B. fragilis and PSA are beneficial against inflammatory diseases, 
such as colitis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 
(141, 143). The application of B. fragilis to prevent the leaky gut 
and reverse autoimmunity warrants further investigation. In a 
practical point of view, probiotic candidates with different targets 
on reversing the leaky gut may synergistically act to attenuate 
disease as thus may serve as a probiotic cocktail. As probiotics are 
generally considered safe, it is anticipated that they will become 
cost-effective treatment options for people with autoimmune 
diseases in the foreseeable future. This is a very young but exciting 
field in which much still remains to be learned.
