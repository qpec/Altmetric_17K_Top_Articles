Methods
and results
In QUALIFY, an international, prospective, observational, longitudinal survey, 6669 outpatients with HFrEF were
recruited 1–15 months after heart failure (HF) hospitalization from September 2013 to December 2014 in 36
countries and followed up at 6 months. A global adherence to guidelines score was developed for prescription
of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers (BBs),
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and ivabradine and their dosages. Baseline global adherence score
was good in 23% of patients, moderate in 55%, and poor in 22%. At 6-month follow-up, poor adherence was associated
with significantly higher overall mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42–3.44, P=0.001],
cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.36–3.77, P=0.003), HF mortality (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.21–4.2, P=0.032),
combined HF hospitalization or HF death (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08–1.71, P=0.024) and cardiovascular hospitalization
or cardiovascular death (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08–1.69, P=0.013). There was a strong trend between poor adherence
and HF hospitalization (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04–1.68, P=0.069).

Conclusion
Good adherence to pharmacologic treatment guidelines for ACEIs, ARBs, BBs, MRAs and ivabradine, with
prescription of at least 50% of recommended dosages, was associated with better clinical outcomes during
6-month follow-up. Continuing global educational initiatives are needed to emphasise the importance of guideline
recommendations for optimising drug therapy and prescribing evidence-based doses in clinical practice.

Introduction
Despite improvements in understanding of the pathophysiology of
heart failure (HF) and significant progress in pharmacological ther-
apy, the disease remains a substantial cause of morbidity and mor-
tality and a considerable global burden for healthcare systems.1–4
Prescription of evidence-based therapies recommended by inter-
national guidelines is the most effective way of ensuring that
patients receive optimal care.5 Although physicians are encour-
aged to implement such guidelines in practice, it has been repeat-
edly observed that a sizeable proportion of HF patients do not
receive evidence-based treatments. A study analysing care deliv-
ered to over 15 000 HF patients in outpatient settings found that
a median of 27% of patients received all HF therapies for which
they were potentially eligible, and use of guideline-recommended
therapies varied widely between practice settings.6 More recently,
data from the National Heart Failure Audit of nearly 57 000 HF
admissions in England and Wales in 2014–2015 showed that only
42% of HF patients were discharged on angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs),
beta-blockers (BBs) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
(MRAs).7
There is some evidence that good adherence to guidelines can
improve clinical outcomes. For example, in a multicentre, observa-
tional study on the medical management and cost of chronic HF
carried out in six European countries between 2001 and 2002,
adherence to treatment guidelines was a strong predictor of fewer
cardiovascular (CV) hospitalizations.8 However, even when pre-
scription of guideline-based HF treatment is high, there is evidence
of frequent failure to reach target doses9 and there is evidence from
some, though not all studies, that sub-optimal dosing may adversely
influence outcomes.10,
11
We therefore decided to gain a global perspective on the impact
of adherence to guideline-recommended medication for HF, includ-
ing prescription of recommended doses, on clinical outcomes. The
international survey QUALIFY (QUality of Adherence to guideline
recommendations for LIFe-saving treatment in heart failure surveY)
assessed adherence to five classes of medications recommended
for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) by the European
Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, ACEIs, ARBs, BBs, MRAs
and ivabradine.12 We have previously reported baseline character-
istics and guideline adherence scores for the study population at
enrollment.13 In the present analysis, we report the impact of physi-
cians’adherence to the same guideline-recommended classes of
HF medication, including prescription of recommended doses, on
clinical outcomes at 6-month follow-up.
Methods
Study design and population
QUALIFY is an international, prospective, observational, longitudinal
survey of outpatients with HFrEF treated at 547 centres in 36 countries
in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, and North, Central
and South America.
Survey participants were adult outpatients (>18 years old) with
chronic HF diagnosed according to the participating investigator’

clinical judgement, with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40%
(on the most recent echocardiogram, ≤2 years), who had been hos-
pitalized for worsening HF within the previous 1–15 months. Infor-
mation collected at baseline included demographics, medical history,
CV risk factors and lifestyle, results of physical examination, cur-
rent symptoms, most recently available investigations, including elec-
trocardiogram, echocardiography and laboratory data, and current
medical treatments. Details of the study design, baseline evaluation
and data management have been published previously.13 The sur-
vey involved physicians and we assessed physicians’ adherence to
guideline-recommended medications in HFrEF.13
Key clinical outcomes assessed at 6-month follow-up were all-cause
mortality, CV death, HF death, HF hospitalization, HF hospitalization
or HF death, CV hospitalization or CV death. Events were reported
by investigators and were not centrally adjudicated. Between 10%
and 15% of the centres in each country were audited as a means
of face-to-face quality control (1397 patients in total at baseline and
follow-up visits). Data in source documents were compared with data
recorded and the results of the audit were satisfactory in most cases.
When quality control problems occurred, a face-to-face discussion was
organized with investigators and cross checks made between source
documents and recorded data.
Global adherence to guideline score
The global adherence to guideline score used in QUALIFY was based
on physicians’adherence to the latest ESC HF guideline recommenda-
tions at the time the study registry was established.12 The score related
to five classes of medications associated with significant improvement
in morbidity or mortality in large randomised controlled trials (RCTs),
and recommended by the ESC for reduction of mortality and/or HF
hospitalization: ACEIs, ARBs (if ACEIs not tolerated), BBs, MRAs [if
New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II–IV] and ivabradine (sinus
rhythm, heart rate ≥70 or 75 b.p.m., NYHA class II–IV).12 Having previ-
ously identified under-dosage of recommended medications as an issue
in our baseline QUALIFY analysis,13 we integrated adherence to target
doses of recommended medications into the adherence score for the
current 6-month outcome analysis.
The adherence score was the ratio of the treatment actually
prescribed to the treatment that should theoretically have been
prescribed. The theoretical treatment score was calculated for
every patient, taking into account treatment eligibility criteria,
guideline-based contraindications to drugs or treatments and use in
≥50% of recommended dosages (Table S1). The number of patients
prescribed medication at ≥50% target dose was assessed using doses
defined by the ESC guidelines when available;12 for ivabradine, we used
the therapeutic regimen used in the Systolic Heart Failure Treatment
with the If Inhibitor Ivabradine Trial (SHIFT).14
The score was calculated for each patient by summing the points
attributed as follows: 0 points for non-prescription in the absence
of contraindications, 0.5 points for use of <50% of target dosage
(<100% of target dose for MRA as the majority of patients were
treated with ≥50% of target dose of MRA) or 1 point for use in
≥50% of target dosage (target dose for MRA). Non-administration of
recommended drugs due to specific contraindications or intolerance
was scored as adherence to guidelines. The score ranged from 0
(very poor) to 1 (excellent) and we defined three levels of adherence:
good adherence (score =1); moderate adherence (score >0.5 to
<1) and poor adherence (score ≤0.5). In this survey, our term
‘
adherence’ relates solely to physicians following guidelines, not to
patient compliance or persistence.

The survey was conducted according to the rules of the dec-
laration of Helsinki and was approved by relevant ethics commit-
tees and/or regulatory bodies in all 36 participating countries. All
patients gave written informed consent to participate, in accordance
with national and local regulations. The QUALIFY survey is regis-
tered in the ISRCTN registry of clinical trials under the number
ISRCTN87465420.
Statistical analysis
This analysis has been conducted in patients with 6-month follow-up
information and known adherence score at baseline. Baseline char-
acteristics for three adherence groups – good (score =1), moderate
(score >0.5 to <1) and low (score ≤0.5) are presented using descrip-
tive statistics as numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and
means ± standard deviation or median for continuous variables. Base-
line values were compared between groups using an analysis of variance
(ANOVA) test for quantitative variables and chi-square test or Fisher’
s
exact test for qualitative variables.
Individual and composite clinical outcomes were analysed based
on the time to first event. The data were analysed using Cox pro-
portional hazards regression models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs),
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and P-values, for each
adherence group.
Univariate analysis was conducted using potential covariates such as

hypertension, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic
kidney disease, heart rate and LVEF. Significant covariates were selected
with a threshold of 1% in the univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis
was conducted using a stepwise method by selecting significant covari-
ates with a threshold of 5%.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS Insti-
tute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
A total of 7256 patients were screened between September 2013
and December 2014 and baseline treatment adherence scores
were analysed and reported for 7117 patients (data extraction July
2016) (Figure 1). Follow-up data were unavailable for 448 patients,
and results are reported for the remaining 6669 patients.
The global adherence score at baseline (ACEIs/ARBs, BBs, MRAs
and ivabradine) was good in 23% of patients, moderate in 55%,
and poor in 22% (Figure 2). The influence of age, sex, ethnicity,
co-morbidities and symptoms at baseline is shown in Table 1. Mean
age was similar in groups with good, moderate or poor adher-
ence scores, though there was a non-significant trend towards
more patients ≥74 years in the poor adherence group (P = 0.109).
Approximately three quarters of patients were male, with a slightly
higher proportion of women in the poor adherence group than
in the good or moderate groups (P = 0.008). Significantly more

patients with a good adherence score were Caucasian than Asian
(including Middle East population) (P < 0.001). A significantly higher
proportion of patients with a good adherence score had atrial fibril-
lation/flutter (P < 0.001), coronary artery bypass graft (P = 0.002),
diabetes mellitus (P < 0.001), dyslipidaemia (P < 0.001), or history
of hypertension (P < 0.001). In addition, a significantly higher pro-
portion had a medical history of asthma or chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (P < 0.001), or chronic kidney disease (P < 0.001).
In contrast, a significantly higher proportion of patients with a poor
adherence score had a history of cancer than those with a high
score (P = 0.043). Amongst patients with a good adherence score,
49.3% had ≥3 co-morbidities, compared to 37.9% in the group with
poor adherence score (P < 0.001). Body mass index and systolic
and diastolic blood pressure were significantly higher in the group
with a good adherence score than in the moderate or poor adher-
ence groups (P < 0.001 for all parameters).
A higher proportion of patients in the good adherence group
were in NYHA class I (P < 0.001) compared with patients in the
poor adherence group, while slightly more patients in the poor
adherence group had NYHA class IV compared with patients in the
good adherence group (P < 0.001). Median LVEF was comparable
across the high, moderate and poor adherence groups (32.2%,
31.6% and 32.3%, respectively; P = 0.004).
Adherence according to baseline
medication
Table 2 and Table S2 show adherence score to prescription of
medication at baseline. In the group with poor adherence scores,
significantly fewer patients were prescribed ACEIs (P < 0.001),
BBs (P < 0.001), MRAs (P < 0.001), ivabradine (P < 0.001), diuret-
ics (P < 0.001), anticoagulants (P < 0.001), and statins (P < 0.001).
With the exception of BBs, patients in the good adherence
group had highest prescribing levels for these classes of drugs.
Beta-blockers were most commonly prescribed in the moderate
adherence group.

There was also a trend towards greater use of devices in patients
in the good adherence group, with significantly more patients having
implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (P = 0.001).
Outcomes at 6 months
Good adherence score at baseline was consistently associated
with better clinical outcomes at 6-month follow-up than moderate
or poor adherence score (Table 3 and Figure 3). Multivariate
analysis showed that poor adherence score was associated with
significantly higher all-cause mortality than good adherence score
(HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.42–3.44, P = 0.001). Poor adherence score was
also associated with significantly higher CV mortality (HR 2.27, 95%
CI 1.36–3.77, P = 0.003), HF mortality (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.21–4.2,
P = 0.032), combined HF hospitalization or HF death (HR 1.26, 95%
CI 1.08–1.71, P = 0.024) and CV hospitalization or CV death (HR
1.35, 95% CI 1.08–1.69, P = 0.013). In addition, there was a strong
trend between poor adherence score and HF hospitalization (HR
1.32, 95% CI 1.04–1.68).
Discussion
Our current analysis showed that (i) adherence to five classes of
medications recommended for HFrEF by the ESC at the time the
study was initiated12 was satisfactory; (ii) integration of dosages of
these medications into the adherence assessment reduced signif-
icantly the proportion of patients with good adherence to 23%;
(iii) good adherence to ESC guidelines for the prescription of
ACEIs/ARBs, BBs, MRAs and ivabradine, with ≥50% of recom-
mended dosages, was associated with improved clinical outcomes
during 6-month follow-up.
Adherence versus outcomes: evidence
from observational studies
As demonstrated by our initial analysis and in several observational
studies including data from the British National HF audit, adherence
to HF guidelines regarding use of appropriate classes of therapy has
improved considerably over the past decade from approximately a
quarter of prescriptions in 20086 to nearly two thirds in 2016.7,
13
However, our earlier analysis showed that simple calculation of the
percentage of treated patients may not be an adequate measure
to indicate the quality of healthcare provided for HF patients, and
that under-dosing of recommended therapies is a major issue.
In that analysis, the proportion of patients at target dose and
≥50% of target dose was low for most medications (28% and
63% for ACEIs, 7% and 39% for ARBs, 15% and 52% for BBs,
71% and 99% for MRAs, and 27% and 86% for ivabradine).13 Data
from the ESC Heart Failure Long-Term Registry reported in 2013
showed similar trends, with fewer than one-third of patients on
guideline-recommended target dosages (29% for ACEIs, 24% for
ARBs, 17% for BBs, and 30% for MRAs).9
Similarly, a recent European survey (BIOSTAT-CHF) conducted
in 11 countries and enrolling 2500 patients showed that only a
minority of patients reached the target dose of ACEIs and BBs
recommended by the ESC guidelines.15

*Number of patients at TD or at ≥50% TD was assessed for doses defined by the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines when available.12 For ivabradine, the TD
was 7.5 mg b.i.d. based on the therapeutic regimen used in SHIFT.14
Several observational studies have explored the association
between class adherence to guideline-recommended therapies and
clinical outcomes in HF,8,
16 but the use of dosage as a marker of
good adherence has been used less frequently.15
The Austrian Heart Failure Registry showed that improvement
in guideline adherence related to dose escalation towards optimal
levels is associated with reduced long-term mortality in ambulatory
HFrEF subjects surviving 1 year after registration.17 Similarly the
BIOSTAT-CHF registry showed that patients receiving >50% or
recommended doses of ACEIs and BBs had better outcomes than
those taking lower doses.15
There is therefore evidence from observational studies that
dosage of recommended therapies matters.
Dosage and outcomes: evidence from
clinical trials
Several randomised clinical trials have explored the relationship
between dosage and clinical outcomes. The Assessment of Treat-
ment with Lisinopril and Survival (ATLAS) trial demonstrated that
although there were no significant differences in all-cause or CV
mortality in patients using higher versus lower doses of lisinopril,
there was a lower relative risk of the composite endpoint of total
mortality plus hospitalization for any reason, as well as for HF
hospitalizations.10 However, high doses of lisinopril were associ-
ated with more adverse events, such as hypotension, dizziness and
worsening renal function. The Multicenter Oral Carvedilol Heart

Failure Assessment (MOCHA) trial evaluated three carvedilol
doses in patients with HF.18 Although this trial was not designed
to evaluate the effect of carvedilol on survival, the lowest 6-month
mortality was noted in the highest dose group. Finally, the Heart
failure Endpoint evaluation of Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan
(HEAAL) trial showed that high-dose losartan, compared with
low-dose losartan, can reduce mortality and readmission to hos-
pital in patients with HF, supporting the value of up-titrating ARB
doses to confer clinical benefit.11
Other large-scale HF trials have performed post-hoc analyses
evaluating the effect of dose on mortality reduction. In the Meto-
prolol CR/XL Randomised Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart
Failure (MERIT-HF), risk reduction was similar in the high- and
low-dose subgroups which, at least partly, may be the result of sim-
ilar beta-blockade as judged from the heart rate response.19 The
results support the idea of an individualised dose-titration regimen,
which is guided by patient tolerability and the heart rate response.
A similar outcome was reported in a secondary analysis of the Car-
diac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II (CIBIS II), showing significant
and similar relative reductions in mortality by low, moderate and
high daily doses of bisoprolol versus the corresponding randomised
placebo groups.20
Although post-hoc analyses have limitations, these results
together with those of the randomised trials mentioned above
suggest that reaching a high dose of recommended medications
may favourably influence clinical outcomes.

Adherence level: a multifactorial
situation
Different factors, both medical (patients and physicians) and eco-
nomic, play an important role in adherence level. Patient factors
can influence the adherence level through contraindications, poor
tolerability of recommended medications and poor compliance.
We did indeed observe that poor adherence was more common
in older patients, in patients with the most severe HF (NYHA class
IV) and in those with cancer, suggesting that patient frailty may
have played a role. In the BIOSTAT-CHF registry, it was observed
that patients not reaching recommended doses owing to symp-
tom severity, side effects and non-cardiac organ dysfunction had
the highest mortality rate.15 In the QUALIFY population, we found
that more patients had co-morbidities in the good adherence group
compared with moderate and poor adherence groups. This obser-
vation is counter-intuitive and in contrast with the perception
that multimorbidity implies polypharmacy with a consequent poor
adherence to treatments. However, research has shown that the
relationship between the number of co-morbidities and adherence
is inconsistent, due to conflicting results. Some data suggest that
having more co-morbidity is related to a lower level of adherence,21
whereas other studies have shown no impact of co-morbidities
on adherence.22,
23 When analysed, drug adherence appears to be
quite a complex phenomenon. A poor adherer to treatments is
also a poor adherer to a healthy lifestyle and has characteristics
of a phenotype carrying a high risk of premature death. In several
RCTs and in a meta-analysis, patient non-adherers to placebo have
a nearly 40% higher probability of dying than patient adherers to
placebo.24,

In addition, we could not exclude the fact that some patients
were still in the uptitration phase of disease-modifying medications
since the lower time window for inclusion in our registry was
1 month after hospitalization for HF. Data from the ESC-HF
Long-Term Registry showed that in approximately one-third of
patients not achieving target dosages, a drug up-titration was still
ongoing, while for about another third of patients not achieving the
target, a clear reason was not reported.9 However, we did not find
any significant differences in adherence score and dosages between
patients included less than 6 months after previous hospitalization
for HF and those included 6 months or later. Finally, if the achieved
dosage provides useful information about the quality of care, it is
not sufficient in isolation as it may be influenced by the fact that
some patients tolerate higher doses because their cardiac reserve
is better. Body mass index may also play a role and was, for example,
lower in our Asian population than in other patient groups (data
not shown).
Physicians’awareness is another important factor. It has been
shown that dissemination of guidelines through communication
campaigns improves the rate of prescription of recommended
medications.26 In the advanced elderly patient population with HF,
physicians’reluctance to provide disease-modifying drugs and focus
on symptom relief is well documented.27
Adherence to recommended clinical practices is also strongly
related to access to treatments and affordability, which are the con-
sequence of national economic status. The general organization of
healthcare systems and the existence of reimbursement schemes,
as well as incentives or obligations to comply with guideline rec-
ommendations, play an important role.28,
29 Inevitably, these factors
influence any adherence score, particularly the use of expensive

procedures such as implantable defibrillators or cardiac resynchro-
nization therapy, which have demonstrated clear benefit in ran-
domised trials. Overall use of these interventions was low in our
survey, especially in countries with low income.
Limitations
The population enrolled in our survey was relatively young and
this may not necessarily reflect the overall profile of HF in elderly
patients.
As with all observational studies, the possibility for unmeasured
bias exists, leading to overestimation or underestimation of treat-
ment effects. In particular, adherence behaviour to treatments
is known to influence outcomes in itself, as shown by measures
of adherence to placebo.30 Although the registry was conducted
in five continents, some geographic areas are underrepresented
such as Africa, South America and the United States, as well as
some large European countries including the UK and Italy. As

centres were selected by national coordinators, on a voluntary
basis, selection bias cannot be excluded. Recommendations were
made to each centre to recruit consecutively but we were unable
to verify this procedure.
In particular, we may have underestimated the role of economic
factors in countries with low gross national product per capita. This
probably explains the low rate of use of devices such as implantable
defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy, which have
demonstrated benefit in clinical trials.
The vast majority of the investigators were cardiologists, and
our survey does not therefore necessarily reflect adherence to
guidelines and drug dosage in patients in the care of general
practitioners or internists.
We used our adherence score (good, moderate, poor) in rela-
tion to prescription and dosages of the five core therapies rec-
ommended for HFrEF at the time QUALIFY was initiated. It was
therefore based on the ESC HF recommendations published in

201212, and the use of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor
therapy was not captured.
Although drug dosage was integrated into our adherence score,
the current analysis of QUALIFY data does not include information
about reasons for under-dosing, such as intolerance.
Clinical outcomes were reported by investigators and, although
they were given guidance about how these should be assessed, we
cannot exclude some variability in reporting.
Conclusion
Our analysis demonstrates that good adherence to contempo-
rary pharmacologic treatment guidelines as determined by pre-
scription of ACEIs/ARBs, BBs, MRAs and ivabradine, in dosages
at least 50% of those recommended, is associated with improved
mid-term clinical outcomes. Our results reinforce the importance
of full implementation of guideline recommendations into clinical
practice, and suggest that quality performance metrics for HF in
hospitals or healthcare systems should involve global adherence
to all medications and dosages. They provide further rationale for
performance improvement, and the global use of educational initia-
tives and disease management programmes to support implemen-
tation of guideline-recommended HF therapies, at evidence-based
target doses, into clinical practice. Further research is needed to
investigate the common causes for failure to adhere to guideline
recommendations for drug doses of HF medications, including the
potential role of physician-related factors as well as patient-related
factors including lack of awareness or intolerance.
