Abstract
Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent agent of human malaria, shares a recent common 
ancestor with the gorilla parasite P. praefalciparum. Little is known about the other gorilla and 
chimpanzee-infecting species in the same (Laverania) subgenus as P. falciparum but none of them

 are capable of establishing repeated infection and transmission in humans. To elucidate underlying 
mechanisms and the evolutionary history of this subgenus, we have generated multiple genomes 
from all known Laverania species. The completeness of our dataset allows us to conclude that 
interspecific gene transfers as well as convergent evolution were important in the evolution of 
these species. Striking copy number and structural variations were observed within gene families 
and one, stevor shows a host specific sequence pattern. The complete genome sequence of the 
closest ancestor of P. falciparum enables us to estimate the timing of the beginning of speciation to 
be 40,000-60,000 years ago followed by a population bottleneck around 4,000-6,000 years ago. 
Our data allow us also to search in detail for the features of P. falciparum that made it the only 
member of the Laverania able to infect and spread in humans.
The evolutionary history of Plasmodium falciparum, the most common and deadly human 
malaria parasite, has been the subject of uncertainty and debate1,2. Recently it has become 
clear that P. falciparum is derived from a group of parasites infecting African Great Apes, 
known as the Laverania subgenus2. Until 2009, chimpanzee-infecting P. reichenowi was the 
only other species known in this subgenus, for which only one isolate was available3. It is 
now clear that there are a total of at least seven species in Great Apes that naturally infect 
chimpanzees (P. gaboni, P. billcollinsi and P. reichenowi), gorillas (P. praefalciparum, P. 
blacklocki and P. adleri)4,5, or humans (P. falciparum) (Fig. 1a). Within this group, P. 
falciparum is the only parasite that has successfully adapted to humans after a transfer from 
gorillas and subsequently spread worldwide2.
Over time there have been various estimates concerning the evolutionary history of P. 
falciparum with the speciation event having been estimated to be anywhere between 10,000 
to 5.5 million years ago, the latter falsely based on the date of the chimpanzee–human 
split6,7. Others report a bottleneck less than 10,000 years ago8, but suggest a drop to a 
single progenitor parasite. The latter seems unlikely due to the presence of allelic 
dimorphisms that predate speciation events and could not have both been transmitted if a 
new species were founded by a single individual infection. Also, the dating of the speciation 
cannot be accurately estimated without the genome sequence of P. praefalciparum, the 
closest living sister species to P. falciparum.
The absence of in vitro culture or an animal model has precluded obtaining sufficient DNA 
for full genome sequencing and has hindered investigation of the Laverania. So far the full 
draft genome of P. reichenowi9 and a nearly complete draft sequence of P. gaboni6 are 
available. These data together with additional PCR based approaches10 have provided 
important insights into the evolution of this subgenus, including the lateral gene transfer of 
the rh5 locus, the early expansion of the FIKK gene family and the observation that the 
common ancestor also had var genes. Our data confirm and significantly extend these 
findings. However, the lack of whole genome information for the whole subgenus 
(particularly P. praefalciparum) has severely constrained the scope of subsequent analyses.
To investigate the evolutionary history of all known members of the Laverania subgenus and 
to address the question of why P. falciparum is the only extant species to have adapted 
successfully to humans, we have sequenced multiple genotypes of all known Laverania 
species.

 Genome sequencing from six Laverania species
Fifteen blood samples that were positive for ape malaria parasites by PCR were taken during 
successive routine sanitary controls, from four gorillas and seven chimpanzees living in a 
sanctuary or quarantine facility prior to release (see Methods). Despite low parasitemia, a 
combination of host DNA depletion, parasite cell sorting and amplification methods enabled 
sufficient parasite DNA templates to be obtained for short- (Illumina) and long- read (Pacific 
Bioscience) sequencing (Supplementary Table 1). Mixed-species infections were frequent 
but resolved by utilising sequence data from single infections, resulting in 19 genotypes 
(Supplementary Table 1). The dominant genotype in each sample was assembled de novo 
(see Methods) using long read technology into a reference genome for six malaria parasite 
species: P. praefalciparum, P. blacklocki, P. adleri, P. billcollinsi, P. gaboni and P. reichenowi. 
The assemblies comprised 44-97 scaffolds (Supplementary Table 1), with large contigs 
containing the subtelomeric regions and internal gene clusters that house multigene families 
known in P. falciparum and P. reichenowi to be involved in virulence and host-pathogen 
interactions. The high quality of the assemblies compared to those obtained previously is 
illustrated by the good representation of multi-gene families (Supplementary Table 2) and 
the large number of one-to-one orthologues obtained between the different reference 
genomes (4,350 among the seven species and 4,826 between P. falciparum, P. 
praefalciparum and P. reichenowi). Two to four additional genomes were obtained for each 
species except for P. blacklocki (Supplementary Table 1).
Speciation history in the Laverania sub-genus
Conservation of synteny is striking between these complete genomes and enabled us to 
reconstruct the relationships between different Laverania species, to compare their relative 
genetic diversity (Fig 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1) and to estimate the age of the different 
speciation events that led to the extant species. The latter has been problematic in the past 
due to the lack of both complete genome data and accurate estimates of mutation rate and 
generation time. Using the most divergent estimates of generation time and measured 
mutation rates from the P. falciparum literature, we found the data converge to 0.9-1.5 
mutations per year per genome (Supplementary Note 1). We observed a similar substitution 
rate in vivo by examining existing sequence data for five geographically diverse isolates, 
covering a 200-kb region surrounding the PfCRT gene that is relatively conserved due to a 
selective sweep resulting from chloroquine use (Supplementary Note 1; Supplementary 
Figure 2). The fact that these two figures are similar suggests that the in vitro mutation rate 
may have been underestimated since many mutations will be lost by genetic drift. Since no 
data is available for the other species we have assumed hereon that these values generalise 
across the subgenus. From Bayesian whole-genome estimates, the ancestor of all current day 
parasites of this subgenus existed 0.7–1.2 million years ago, a time at which the subgenus 
divided into two main clades, A (P. adleri and P. gaboni) and B that includes the remaining 
species (Fig. 1a). Our range of values is far more recent than previous estimates3,11. 
Following the Clade A/B subdivision, several speciation events occurred leading either to 
new chimpanzee or gorilla parasites. Interestingly, the divergence between P. adleri and P. 
gaboni in one lineage and P. reichenowi and the ancestor of P. praefalciparum/P. falciparum 
in the other lineage occurred at approximately the same time (140–230 thousand years ago;

 Fig. 1a, Table 2). Based on coalescence estimates, P. falciparum begun to emerge in humans 
from P. praefalciparum around 40–60 thousand years ago (Fig. 1a), significantly later than 
the evolution of the first modern humans and their spread throughout Africa12. Our analysis 
also indicates significant gene flow between these two parasite species after their initial 
divergence (Supplementary Table 3).
P. falciparum has strikingly low diversity (π =0.0004), compared with the other Laverania 
species (0.002–0.0049) (Supplementary Fig. 1). It has been proposed that P. falciparum 
arose from a single transfer of P. praefalciparum into humans6 and based in part on the 
paucity of neutral SNPs within the genome, that P. falciparum emerged from a bottleneck of 
a single parasite around 10,000 years ago, after agriculture was established6,8. In light of 
our results, we estimate that the P. falciparum population declined around 11,000 years ago 
and reached a minimum about 5,000 years ago (Fig. 1b) with an effective population size 
(Ne) of around 3,000 (Supplementary Note 1; generally the census number of parasites is 
higher than Ne13). The hypothesis of a single progenitor is also inconsistent with the 
observation of several ancient gene dimorphisms that have been observed in P. falciparum. A 
previous analysis using P. reichenowi and P. gaboni sequence data, provided some evidence 
that different dimorphic loci diverged at different points in the tree14. Looking at each of 
these P. falciparum loci across the Laverania, we found different patterns of evolution at the 
msp1, var1csa, and msp3 loci (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Most strikingly, a mutually exclusive 
dimorphism (described as MAD20/K115) in the central 70% of the msp1 sequence, clearly 
pre-dates the P. falciparum–P. praefalciparum common ancestor and dimorphism in var1csa 
(an unusual var gene of unknown function that is transcribed late in the asexual cycle) 
occurred before the split with P. reichenowi.
In contrast, the gene eba-175 that encodes a parasite surface ligand involved in red blood cell 
invasion contains a dimorphism that arose after the emergence of P. falciparum 
(Supplementary Fig. 3b). The time to the most recent common ancestor of eba-175 has been 
estimated as 130–140 thousand years in an analysis16 that assumed P. falciparum and P. 
reichenowi diverged 6 million years ago. However, based on our new estimate for P. 
falciparum–P. reichenowi divergence, we recalibrated their estimate of the most recent 
common ancestor of the eba-175 alleles to be around 4,000 years ago, which is in good 
agreement with our divergence time for P. falciparum (Supplementary Note 1). The recent 
dimorphism cannot however explain the observation of an ancient dimorphism near the 
human and ape loci for glycophorin17 – an EBA-175 binding protein. The formation and 
maintenance of all of these dimorphic loci has therefore been shaped by different balancing 
selection pressures over time.
P. falciparum-specific evolution
During its move away from gorillas, P. falciparum had to adapt to a new vertebrate host 
(human) and new vector species (e.g. Anopheles gambiae)18. To infer P. falciparum specific 
adaptive changes, we considered the P. falciparum / P. praefalciparum /P. reichenowi genome 
trio and then applied two lineage based tests to find positive selection that occurred in the P. 
falciparum branch (see methods). The two tests identified 172 genes (out of 4,826) with 
signatures of positive selection in the human parasite species only (Supplementary Table 4).

 Two genes (rop14 and PF3D7_0609900) were significant in both tests. Among the 172 
genes, almost half (n=82) encoded proteins of unknown function. Analysis of those with 
functional annotation indicated that genes involved in pathogenesis, entry into host, actin 
movement and organization and in drug response were significantly over-represented. Other 
genes, expressed in different stages of the P. falciparum life cycle (e.g. sera4 and emp3, 
involved during the erythrocytic stages; trsp and lisp1, involved in the hepatic stages; and 
plp4, CelTOS and Cap380, involved in the mosquito stages) also showed a significant signal 
of adaptive evolution (Supplementary Table 4).
Evolution through introgression, gene transfer and convergence
Frequent mixed species infections in apes and mosquitoes18 provide clear opportunities for 
interspecific gene flow between these parasites. A recent study6 reported a gene transfer 
event between P. adleri and the ancestor of P. falciparum and P. praefalciparum of a region 
on chromosome 4 including key genes involved in erythrocyte invasion (rhr5 and cyrpA). 
Because such events preserve the phylogenetic history of the genes involved, we 
systematically examined the evidence for introgression or gene transfer events across the 
complete subgenus by testing the congruence of each gene tree to the species tree for genes 
with one-to-one orthologues. Beyond the region that includes rh5 (Fig 2b, Supplementary 
Fig. 4a), few signals of gene flow between parasites infecting the same host species were 
obtained (n=11) suggesting that these events were rare or usually strongly deleterious 
(Supplementary Fig. 5).
The Laverania subgenus evolved to infect chimpanzees and gorillas but, on a genome-wide 
scale, the convergent evolution of host-specific traits has not left a signature (Supplementary 
Note 2). We therefore examined each CDS independently and were able to identify genes 
with differences fixed within specific hosts, falling into three categories: 53 in chimpanzee-
infective parasites, 49 in gorilla-infective and 12 with fixed traits in both host species (Fig. 2; 
Supplementary Table 5a). For at least 67 genes, these differences were unlikely to have 
arisen by chance (p <0.05) and GO term enrichment analysis revealed that several of these 
genes are involved in host invasion and pathogenesis (Supplementary Table 5b) including 
rh5 (which has a signal for convergent evolution even when the introgressed tree topology is 
taken into consideration; Supplementary Fig. 4b). Rh5 is the only gene identified in P. 
falciparum that is essential for erythrocyte recognition during invasion, via binding to 
Basigin. P. falciparum rh5 cannot bind to gorilla Basigin and binds poorly to the chimpanzee 
protein19. We notice that one of the convergent sites is known to be a binding site for the 
host receptor Basigin20 (Supplementary Fig. 4b). The gene eba-165 encodes a member of 
the erythrocyte binding like (EBL) super family of proteins that are involved in erythrocyte 
invasion. Although eba-165 is a pseudogene in P. falciparum21, it is not a pseudogene in the 
other Laverania species and may therefore be involved in erythrocyte invasion, like other 
EBL members. The protein has three convergent sites in gorillas. One falls inside the F2 
region, a domain involved in the interactions with erythrocyte receptors. The role of this 
protein and of these convergent sites in the invasion of gorilla red cells remains to be 
determined. Finally, genes involved in gamete fertility (the 6-cysteine protein P230) or 
implicated in Plasmodium invasion of erythrocytes (doc222) also displayed signals of 
convergent evolution. Twelve parasite coding sequences had fixed differences at the same

 amino-acid position in chimpanzees and gorillas. Of these P230 was the only one found with 
a position that was different and fixed across all three host species. P230 is involved in 
gamete development and trans-specific reproductive barriers23, possibly through enabling 
male gametes to bind to erythrocytes prior to exflagellation24. Host-specific residues 
observed in P230 might affect the efficiency of the binding to the erythrocyte receptors and 
result from co-evolution between the parasite molecule and the host receptor.
Subtelomeric gene families
To date, the only in-depth data on the subtelomeric gene families of the Laverania have 
come from P. reichenowi and P. falciparum. These important families are well represented in 
our assemblies (Supplementary Tables 2 and 6A) and we provide a comprehensive picture of 
their evolution.
Most gene families were likely present in the ancestor of all Laverania. The same general 
pattern of one-to-one orthology throughout the subgenus indicates that many underwent 
gene duplication early (e.g. FIKK) or prior (e.g. ETRAMP, PHIST and SURFIN) to the 
development of a distinct Laverania lineage. Only a subset displayed contractions or 
expansions between specific Laverania species (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 6a, 
Supplementary Figure 7). For these latter families, Clade A and most species of Clade B 
clearly differ in their composition. P. blacklocki (Clade B) is intermediate in its composition. 
Some gene families, like the group of exported proteins hyp4, hyp5, mc-2tm and EPF1, have 
expanded only in P. praefalciparum and P. falciparum (and even more in P. falciparum for 
hyp4 and hyp5). Since all four are components of Maurer’s clefts, an organelle involved in 
protein export25, some evolution of function in this organelle may have been an important 
precursor to human infection. The family of acyl-CoA synthetase genes, reported to be 
expanded and diversified in P. falciparum26 is in fact expanded across the Laverania and has 
four fewer copies in P. falciparum (Supplementary Fig. 6). Other genes that show clade or 
group specific expansion include DBLmsp, glycophorin binding protein and CLAG 
(Supplementary Fig. 7).
One striking inter-clade difference concerns the largest gene family that is likely common to 
all other malaria species: the Plasmodium interspersed repeat family (pir, which includes the 
rif and stevor families in P. falciparum) (Fig. 3, 4). This family has been proposed to be 
involved in important functions such as antigenic variation, immune evasion, signalling, 
trafficking, red cell rigidity and adhesion27 and yet has expanded only in Clade B, after the 
P. blacklocki split (Fig 3). The rif genes comprise a small conserved group and a much larger 
group of more diverse members that contains just 13 genes from Clade A species and at least 
180 members per Clade B species (Fig. 4). There is however no evidence for host-specific 
adaptation in these sequences.
In contrast, a subset of stevor genes showed strong host-specific sequence diversification 
(Fig 4 and Supplementary Fig. 8). Based on full-length alignments, there is a deep 
phylogenetic split between stevor genes but when only short conserved protein motifs are 
considered, a group of Stevor proteins (stevor II, Fig 4a) forms a cluster comprising almost 
entirely of members from gorilla-infecting species. Since stevor genes are known to be

 involved in host–parasite interactions (such as binding to host glycophorin C in P. 
falciparum28), this host specific sequence may reflect sequence differences in host-specific 
factors in gorillas.
Evolution of var genes
The var genes, crucial mediators of pathogenesis and the establishment of chronic infection 
through cytoadherence and immune evasion, are the best studied P. falciparum multi-gene 
family and unique to the Laverania29. They are two-exon genes and their products have 
three types of major domain; exon 1 encodes Duffy Binding like (DBL) and Cysteine Rich 
Interdomain Regions (CIDR) and exon 2 encodes Acidic Terminal Sequence (ATS)30. 
Similar to P. falciparum, our data are consistent with all Laverania species having var genes 
(Fig. 3) that retain a two-exon structure and are organized into subtelomeric or internal var 
gene clusters. There are however three notable features of var evolution within the sub-
genus.
First, there is a deep division in how the repertoire is organised between the major clades. 
The var genes of Clade B parasites, with the exception of P. blacklocki, resemble those of P. 
falciparum in terms of genomic organisation, domain types and numbers (Fig 5, 
Supplementary Table 7). In contrast, the repertoires of Clade A parasites and P. blacklocki 
(treated as one group hereafter in this section) differ in their domain composition, contain a 
novel CIDR-like domain (CIDRn, Fig 5a, Supplementary Fig. 9) and have lower sequence 
diversity per domain but cluster into more sub-groups than Clade B domains (Fig 5b, 
Supplementary Fig. 10). The paucity of domains similar to those in P. falciparum (such as 
CIDRα) that are involved in cytoadherence to some specific and common host receptors, 
means that if endothelial cytoadherence was important in Clade A, some alternative 
receptors must have been utilised.
Second, in total there are 10 internal var gene clusters (confirmed by contiguous sequence 
data) but 8 are oppositely oriented between the two clades (Supplementary Fig. 11, 
Supplementary Table 8). Clade B parasites also show a much greater number of associated 
GC-rich RNAs of unknown Function (RUF) elements than Clade A (Supplementary Table 
8).
Third, the ATS domains cluster tightly within Clade A. Within Clade B there is clear 
evidence of species-specific diversification, except in P. praefalciparum and P. falciparum 
reflecting their recent speciation. There is one intact ATS from P. falciparum as well as 
several pseudogenes that cluster with Clade A (Fig 5c). Moreover, of seven internal var 
arrays (Supplementary Fig. 11) in P. falciparum, containing a functional var gene, five 
terminate with one of these pseudogenes (on the opposite DNA strand) suggesting that they 
may be remnants from ancient rearrangements. The intact P. falciparum gene is var2csa, a 
var-like gene that is highly conserved between P. falciparum isolates31, involved both in 
cytoadherence in the placenta in primigravidae, and proposed to be a central intermediate in 
var gene switching during antigenic variation32. We therefore propose var2csa is a remnant 
of an ancient multigene family that has been maintained as a single complete gene in P. 
falciparum, for the dual purposes of var-switching and placental cytoadherence.
Otto et al.

 There is other evidence of retention of ancient var gene sequence across the subgenus. First, 
in Clade B we find a nearly full length var pseudogene that has highest similarity to P. adleri 
and P. gaboni var genes, within an internal var cluster on chromosome 4 in P. falciparum and 
P. praefalciparum but on the opposite strand to the other var genes. It is found in all P. 
falciparum isolates, but not in P. reichenowi. Second, in P. gaboni and P. adleri, three genes 
have the N-terminal DBLα/CIDRα architecture typical of Clade B genes and their domains 
cluster within Clade B based on similarity (Fig. 5b, larger nodes). Directly adjacent to two of 
these var genes are two rif pseudogenes that also show greatest similarity to those from 
Clade B. Last, we find a further nine rif pseudogenes of Clade A parasites that cluster with 
Clade B rif genes (Fig. 4). If these observations reflect retention of ancient copies, their high 
sequence conservation suggests that they are under extremely unusual selection pressure. 
Alternatively, they may represent relics of gene transfer between species that occurred after 
the Clade A/B split.
Conclusion
We have produced high quality genomes and used mutation rates and generation times, 
covering the full range of most recent estimates, to calculate the date of speciation for all 
known members of the Laverania, with only a small margin of error. In our analysis, we 
have shown that the successful infection of humans by P. falciparum occurred quite recently 
and involved numerous parasites rather than a single one as previously proposed. After the 
establishment in its new host, the parasite population went through a bottleneck around 
5,000 years ago during the period of rapid human population expansion due to farming (Fig. 
1b). We summarise the major genomic events during the evolution of the Laverania in Fig. 6.
As a result of our analyses we propose the following series of events for the emergence of P. 
falciparum as a major human pathogen. First, the crucial lateral transfer event of the rh5 
locus between Clade A and B parasites may also have involved var and rifin genes in other 
parts of the genome that, because of their orientation on the opposite strand, were not lost 
during later recombination. Next, facilitatory mutations are likely to have occurred in rh5 
that in the first instance allowed invasion of both gorilla and human red cells. Modern 
humans emerged more than 300,000 years ago33 and existed as small isolated 
populations12. Our evidence suggests that P. falciparum and P. praefalciparum started to 
diverge around 40,000-60,000 years ago. In the following 40,000 years with low population 
densities in humans and gorillas there would have not been high selection pressure to 
optimise infectivity in either the hosts or vectors, enabling at least some movement of 
parasites between hosts. We find evidence for gene flow between lineages throughout this 
period. The expansion of the human population with the advent of farming likely led to 
strong evolutionary pressure for mosquito species (specifically An. gambiae) to feed 
primarily on humans34. Therefore, the existing human infective (P. falciparum) genotypes 
would be selected for human and appropriate vector success and the fittest would rapidly 
expand. Subsequent rapid accumulation of mutations that favoured growth in humans, and in 
the anthropophilic vectors such as An. gambiae, are likely to have occurred to increase 
human-specific reproductive success. The resulting specific parasite genotypes that 
expanded (and appeared as an emergence from a bottleneck), would have had a much lower 
probability of a direct transfer back to apes. With experiments on gorillas and chimpanzees

 not possible it will be difficult directly to prove the precise combination of different alleles 
that allowed the emergence of P. falciparum. However, for the genes that we have implicated 
in this process, existing data (www.genedb.org, plasmodb.org) suggest they are expressed 
throughout the life cycle but that only half have been characterised. This opens up new 
opportunities for future studies on host specificity and host adaptation in Plasmodium.

Sample collection
All but two infected blood samples from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and 
gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) were obtained from the sanctuary “Parc de La Lékédi”, 
Bakoumba (Haut-Ogooué, Gabon), during routine sanitary controls of the animals. This park 
holds various primate species, including gorillas, chimpanzees and monkeys 
(Cercopithecinae), that have been orphaned due to bushmeat-poaching activities and have 
been confiscated by the Gabonese Government, quarantined at the Centre International de 
Recherches Médicales de Franceville (CIRMF, Gabon) and finally released into semi-free 
ranging enclosures in the sanctuary. Every six months, chimpanzees (12 individuals) and 
gorillas (2 individuals) are anesthetized for medical check up. Blood samples were collected 
from the animals during sanitary controls (July 2011, September 2012, May 2013 and 
December 2013). Two additional infected blood samples were obtained from gorilla orphans 
(GG05, GG06) seized by the Gabonese government in 2011 and 2013 and sent to the 
CIRMF for a quarantine before being released in a sanctuary. All animal work was 
conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. From each animal, 15 
ml of whole blood were collected in EDTA tubes. For all samples but three, white blood cell 
depletion was performed on 10 ml of the freshly collected samples using cellulose columns 
as described in 35. Remaining blood was subsequently used for DNA extraction and 
detection of Plasmodium infections as described in Ollomo et al3. Overall, 15 blood samples 
from 7 chimpanzees and 4 gorillas were found to contain the Laverania samples used in the 
present study (Supplementary Table 1).
Ethical consideration
The animal well-being was guaranteed by the veterinarians of the "Parc of la Lékédi" and 
the CIRMF who proceeded to the sanitary controls and the blood sampling. Because these 
blood samples were collected as part of the standard protocol for the sanitary controls (and 
not specifically for our experiment), our study did not need the approval of an Institutional 
Animal Care or Use Committee. Note also that our study did not involve randomisation nor 
blinding.
Sample preparation
Three methods were used for DNA amplification prior to sequencing (Supplementary Table 
1). For all but one sample, whole genome amplification (WGA) was performed with a 
REPLI-g Mini Kit (Qiagen) following a modified protocol36 to enrich genomic DNA. The 
genome of P. blacklocki was generated using selective WGA (sWGA) as indicated in37 
using 20 primers, followed by a WGA. Finally, for the PprfG03 (a P. praefalciparum isolate) 
and PadlG02 (a P. adleri isolate) samples, we used a cell sorting approach38.

 Sample sequencing
All samples were first sequenced with Illumina. Amplification-free Illumina libraries of 
400-600 bp were prepared from the enriched genomic DNA39 and run on MiSeq and HiSeq 
2000 (v3 chemistry) Illumina machines.
After the Illumina sequencing, six samples with a combination of the least number of 
multiple infections (see below) and the lowest level of host contamination were chosen for 
long read sequencing, using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio). The DNA of the samples (after 
WGA) was size-selected to 8 kb and sequenced with the C3/P5 chemistry. The number of 
SMRT cells (Pacific Bioscience sequencing runs) used varied between samples 
(Supplementary Table 1).
Genome assembly, genome QC, split of infection & annotation
Determination of multiple infections—To initially quantify multiple infections and so 
allow samples to be selected for PacBio sequencing from those comprising a low number of 
species, Illumina reads from each sample were mapped against a concatenation of all 
available Cox 3 and CytB genes of the Laverania from NCBI, using SNP-o-Matic40 
(parameter chop=5) to position reads only where they aligned perfectly. SNP-o-Matic 
returns all the positions of repetitive mapping reads. This output allowed us to count the read 
depth of these two genes across all species and therefore determine the number and relative 
amount of different malaria species per sample.
Whole genome amplification (WGA) bias—The uneven coverage that resulted from 
WGA bias, host contamination and multiple infections presented a challenge for sequence 
assembly. To overcome the bias and the host contamination, each DNA sample was 
sequenced deeper than normally necessary. Lower coverage of the subtelomeres was 
obtained for the sWGA sample (P. blacklocki) meaning that the subtelomeres in that 
assembly were not as complete as those in the assemblies for other species.
Long reads (Pacific Bioscience) assemblies—Six reference genomes were 
assembled using HGAP41, with different settings for the genome size parameter, ranging 
from 23 Mb (P. reichenowi) to 72 Mb (P. billcollinsi). This parameter encodes how many 
long reads are corrected for use in the assembly and depends on the host contamination and 
the amount of different isolates in the samples. The obtained contigs from HGAP were 
ordered with ABACAS42 against a P. falciparum 3D7 reference that has no subtelomeric 
regions. Assembly errors and WGA artefacts were manually corrected using ACT43. After 
this step, three iterations of ICORN244 were run, followed by another ABACAS step, 
allowing overlapping contigs to be merged (parameter: ABA_CHECK_OVERLAP=1). For 
the PrG01, PgabG01 and PadlG01 assembly, we also ran PBjelly to close some of the 
sequencing gaps45.
Host decontamination—To detect and remove sequence data derived from host DNA, 
contigs were compared with the chimpanzee or gorilla genomes using BLAST. Contigs were 
considered as host contamination if more than 50% of their BLAST hits had higher than 
95% identity to any of the great ape genomes. Unordered contigs with a GC content >32%

 were searched against the non-redundant nucleotide database, to detect and remove further 
contaminants.
Resolving multiple infections—The first assembled genome was a single P. reichenowi 
infection, PrG01. We detected low levels of P. vivax-like and virus contamination (TT virus, 
AB038624.1), which were excluded. For quality control, the assembly was compared against 
the existing PrCDC9 reference genome. The number of Plasmodium interspersed repeats 
(PIRs) was similar, and there were no breaks in synteny. There were however significantly 
fewer sequencing gaps and 17 Rep20 regions could be found (a known repeat close to the 
telomeres in P. falciparum). Thus, the assembly of PacBio data (PrG01; Supplementary 
Table 2) appears to be of higher quality than the existing P. reichenowi PrCDC reference.
The P. adleri sample comprised a single infection. Because a large number of cycles of 
amplification were used, a greater number of SMRT cells were sequenced (Supplementary 
Table 1) to overcome the problem of uneven coverage resulting in under-represented regions. 
An estimated genome size of 60 Mb was chosen for the HGAP analysis to ensure that all 
regions were covered.
PgabG01 was a P. gaboni isolate with a P. vivax-like co-infection. To detect contigs of P. 
vivax, unordered contigs (those that could not be placed against Pf3D7 using ABACAS) 
were searched against the protein sequences of P. falciparum 3D7 and the P. vivax PvP01 
reference genome using TBLASTx. For each contig, the relative number of genes hitting 
against the two genomes was used to assign it to P. gaboni or P. vivax. In most cases, all 
genes for a given contig consistently hit only one genome so that the attribution to either 
species was clear. Overall, 14 Mb of P. vivax-like sequences were obtained that will be 
described elsewhere.
The P. billcollinsi genome (PbilcG01) was obtained from a co-infection with a P. gaboni 
genome (PgabG02). Rather than ordering the contigs just against Pf3D7 with ABACAS, 
contigs were ordered against a combined reference comprising P. gaboni (PgabG01) and the 
Pf3D7 (parameters: overlap 500 bp, identity 90%). The species designation of contigs was 
confirmed with a TBLASTx searches of annotated genes against a combination of the 
proteomes of PgabG01 and PrCDC. For subtelomeric gene families, contigs were attributed 
to species if the hit was significant for one species, not the other. Some of the contigs could 
not be attributed unambiguously and were discarded. Due to sequencing gaps, some of the 
core genes are missing from the final assembly.
The sample used to produce the P. praefalciparum genome (PprfG01) had a high level of 
host contamination, a low level of co-infection with P. adleri and contained two distinct P. 
praefalciparum genotypes. For the core genome, we used iCORN to select the dominant 
genotype at each position. Where it was not possible to phase the genotypes, due to a lack of 
variation, we assumed that they were identical. In the subtelomeres however, it was possible 
to distinguish but not phase the two P. praefalciparum genotypes resulting in approximately 
twice the number of var genes as seen in P. falciparum. Due to contamination of construction 
vectors (E. coli) and host, 29 SMRT cells were sequenced and the HAGP parameter for the 
assembly size was set to 60 Mb. Contigs were screened against P. adleri and P. falciparum to 
Otto et al.

 exclude a P. adleri co-infection. All of the contigs that had a P. falciparum BLAST hit or had 
no clear hit (such as those containing species-specific gene families) were attributed to the P. 
praefalciparum assembly. Last, all samples (Supplementary Table 1) including five P. 
falciparum genomes were mapped against the Pf3D7, P. praefalciparum and P. adleri 
assemblies. Contigs were excluded where more normalized hits to the three P. adleri samples 
were found than to one of the two other P. praefalciparum samples. Similarly, this method 
was used to eliminate the remote possibility that any of the contigs in the P. praefalciparum 
assembly were in fact derived from P. falciparum co-infection.
The P. blacklocki sample was from a single infection. Due to sWGA, the PacBio sequence 
data covered regions not covered by Illumina but due to the bias of the primers, the 
subtelomeres were not covered fully. However, the internal var gene clusters are all 
assembled. Some of the core genes from this species are also missing.
Annotation—The genomes were annotated as described in46. In short, the annotation of P. 
falciparum (version July 2015) was transferred with RATT47 and new gene models were 
called with Augustus48. Obvious structural errors in core genes were manually corrected in 
Artemis49.
Mapping - generation of further samples
To generate the gene sequence for different samples, Illumina reads were mapped against a 
set of reference genomes using BWA50 and default parameters. For the gorilla samples, we 
mapped against the combined PacBio reference genomes of P. adleri, P. blacklocki and P. 
praefalciparum and for the chimpanzee samples, the combined references of P. gaboni 
(PgabG01), P. billcollinsi and P. reichenowi (PrG01). SNPs with Phred score ≥ 100 were 
called using GATK UnifiedGenotyper51 v2.0.35 (parameters: -pnrm POOL -ploidy 2 -glm 
POOLBOTH). From these SNP calls we constructed the new gene set, masking regions in 
genes with less than 10x coverage of ‘properly’ (correct distance and orientation) mapped 
paired reads. To generate the sequences of the other 13 isolates, homozygous SNP calls were 
obtained (consensus program from bcftools-1.252). We quality controlled the SNP calling 
by regenerating PrCDC and PgabG02 gene set from PrG01 and PgabG01, respectively and 
confirmed that they were placed with nearly no differences in a phylogenetic tree.
Orthologous group determination and alignment
Orthologous groups were identified using OrthoMCL v1.453 across: (i) the seven core 
Laverania genomes; (ii) the seven core genomes, the Laverania isolates PgabG02, PrCDC 
and P. falciparum IT, as well as two outgroup genomes Plasmodium vivax Sal1 and 
Plasmodium knowlesi strain H; and (iii) just Pf3D7, PprfG01 and PrG01. P. praefalciparum 
II was excluded due to its partial genome. From these groups, different complete sets of 1:1 
orthologues were extracted:
(1)
“Lav12sp” set of 3,369 orthologues across the seven core Laverania species, the 
PrCDC and P. falciparum IT isolates, P. vivax and P. knowlesi
Otto et al.

 (2)
“Lav25st” set of 424 1:1 orthologues from across the 25 Laverania isolates, 
including the previously published P. reichenowi CDC and five P. falciparum 
isolates (3D7, IT, DD2, HB3 and 7G89).
(3)
“Lav7sp” set of 4,350 orthologues from across the seven Laverania reference 
genomes
(4)
“Lav15st” set of 3,808 orthologues, with at least two representative sequences 
per species, excluding P. blacklocki and the most divergent P. praefalciparum 
lineage Pprf3.
(5)
“Lav3sp” set of 4,826 1:1 orthologues across all the P. reichenowi, P. 
praefalciparum and P. falciparum isolates
The first two sets were used to reconstruct the species tree, the third one for the comparative 
genomic analyses (introgression, convergence and gene family evolution), the fourth one for 
the analyses of within species polymorphism and the fifth one for the analysis of P. 
falciparum adaptive evolution.
To reduce the rate of false positives in the evolutionary analyses due to misalignments (e.g.
54), codon-based multiple alignments were performed using PRANK55,56 with the -codon 
and +F options, as it was shown to outperform other programs in the context of the detection 
of positive selection57,58. Prior to aligning codons, low complexity regions were excluded 
in the nucleotide sequences using dustmasker59 and in amino acid sequences using 
segmasker60 from NCBI-BLAST. Poorly aligned regions were excluded using Gblocks61, 
with default settings.
Analysis of interspecific gene flow, introgression or gene transfer
Species-tree inference—Two ML trees were performed using RAxMLv8.1.2062 to 
illustrate the phylogenetic relationships between the Laverania species and genotypes 
studied here using the “Lav12sp” and the “Lav25st” set of orthologues. For each tree, 
multiple nucleotide alignments of each orthologous group were conducted as described 
above. Trees were then constructed from the concatenated alignments of the “Lav12sp” set 
of orthologues for the species tree and the “Lav25st” set for the strain tree using RAxML 
and the following options “-m GTRGAMMA –f a -# 100”. Trees were rooted afterwards 
using P. vivax and P. knowlesi for the species tree and the P. adleri/P. gaboni clade for the 
genotype tree.
Tree topology test—Interspecific gene flow was investigated by testing congruence 
between each gene tree topology and the species tree topology. We performed the 
Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (SH test63) using RAxMLv8.1.20 to test whether the 
phylogenetic tree for each gene significantly differed from the Laverania species tree. 
Topology tests were based on multiple nucleotide alignments of the 4,350 “Lav7sp” set of 
orthologues. For each coding sequence, RAxML was called with the options “-m 
GTRGAMMA –f h”.

 Convergent evolution analyses
Genome-wide test of convergent evolution—Convergent substitutions can occur by 
chance and the number of random convergent substitutions between two lineages is 
correlated with the number of divergent substitutions observed in these two lineages64,65. 
Excess of convergent substitutions in specific branch pairs can thus be identified by 
analyzing the correlation between the number of convergent and divergent substitutions 
between all the branch pairs in a phylogeny using orthogonal regression, and looking for 
outlier branch pairs: branch pairs with a high positive residual show an excess of convergent 
substitutions relatively to the number of divergent substitutions64. We used the software 
Grand-Convergence (available at https://github.com/dekoning-lab/grand-conv) to estimate 
for each chromosome the numbers of divergent and convergent substitutions between all 
branch pairs in the Laverania tree and investigate whether branch pairs including Laverania 
species infecting the same host species (gorilla or chimpanzee) presented an excess of 
convergence. Analyses were performed under different models of amino-acid evolution: LG, 
WAG, JONES and DAYHOFF.
Gene-based detection of convergent evolution throughout the Laverania—For 
each orthologue of the “Lav7sp” set, the number and percentage of fixed amino acid 
differences between parasites infecting the same host were calculated, i.e. the number of 
positions showing the same amino acid within a host species but different amino acid 
between host species. Alignments of all the available sequences (“Lav15st”) from all the 
sequenced isolates were then used to determine what number of host-specific differences 
were fixed within each host and each species. To evaluate whether the observed number of 
host-specific fixed differences in an alignment can be attributed to neutral evolution/
purifying selection alone (with no positive selection), we used a simulation-based approach. 
For each coding sequence, 1,000 sequences of the same size were simulated, evolving along 
the same tree with the same specified branch lengths, substitution model, codon frequencies 
and omega (dN/dS), using the program Evolver from PAML v4.8a66. The program Codeml 
from PAML v4.8a66 was first used to estimate the tree, the codon frequencies and the 
average omega values for each of the coding sequences with fixed amino acid differences. 
For each simulated dataset, the number of fixed amino-acid differences between the 
parasites infecting a same host was estimated. The probability of observing n fixed 
differences was then computed as the proportion of the simulated dataset of 1000 sequences 
that showed at least the same number of fixed differences as observed in the real data.
Tests for positive selection
Branch site tests—To search for genes that have been subjected to positive selection in 
the P. falciparum lineage alone after the divergence from P. praefalciparum, we used the 
updated Branch site test 67 implemented in PAML v4.4c 66. This test detects sites that have 
undergone positive selection in a specific branch of the phylogenetic tree (foreground 
branch). The “Lav3sp” set of 4,826 orthologuous groups between P. reichenowi, P. 
praefalciparum I and P. falciparum was used for the test. dN/dS ratio estimates per branch 
and genes were obtained using Codeml (PAML v4.4c) with a free-ratio model of evolution. 
This identified 139 genes with a significant signal of positive selection in P. falciparum only.

 A Branch Site test was also applied, for each gene, on each terminal branch of the entire 
species tree using the “Lav7sp” dataset. dN/dS ratio estimates per branch and genes were 
obtained using Codeml (PAML v4.4c) with a free-ratio model of evolution, Figure 2.
McDonald–Kreitman (MK) tests—Selection in P. falciparum was also tested using 
McDonald–Kreitman (MK) tests 68 to compare the polymorphism within species to the 
divergence between species, using P. praefalciparum as the outgroup. Analyses were 
performed using the 4,826 “Lav3sp” set of orthologues. MK tests were performed as 
described before9. Thirty-five genes had an MK ratio significantly higher than 1.
Gene Ontology enrichment analyses
Analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) term-enrichment was performed in R, using TopGO69 
with default parameters. GO annotations from GeneDB were used but with unreviewed 
automated annotations excluded.
Gene family analyses
To estimate the differential abundance of gene families across species, the Gene products 
and the Pfam domains were counted and analysed by the variance of the occurrence. Unless 
otherwise stated, trees were constructed using PhyML70 (default parameters) or RAxML62 
(model estimated) from alignments generated with Muscle71 and trimmed with Gblocks61 
in Seaview72 with default values. Many of the findings were confirmed manually through 
ACT and bamview49. The analysis of the var genes was performed on var genes larger than 
2.5kb. Domains were called with the HMMer models from varDom73. Distance matrices 
were generated based on BLASTp scores, without filtering low complexity regions. 
Representation was done in R through the heatmap.2 program from gplot (see also 
Supplementary Note 3).
Allelic dimorphisms—For the analysis of dimorphism in msp, all sequences available for 
the Laverania were downloaded from Uniprot74. Data were subsampled to obtain a similar 
number of sequences for each group. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with PhyML70, 
using default parameters and drawn in Figtree. The eba-175 alignment was visualized with 
Jalview75.
Divergence Dating
Alignments of the Laverania included intergenic regions where possible. Assuming 402–681 
mitotic events per year (Supplementary Note 1) and a mutation rate of 3.78E-10 for 4 
mitotic events76,77(mutation rate from latter paper was taken from Pf3D7 line without 
drugs), equivalent to around 0.9–1.5 mutations per genome per year. Although we observed 
similar mutation rates in clinical samples (Supplementary Note 1), these estimates have 
potential errors and therefore we report ratios of divergence times in the figures that are 
robust to errors in these parameters. For coalescence based estimates of speciation times, G-
Phocs78 was used and multiple sequentially Markovian coalescent (MSMC) on segregating 
sites79 was used to estimate the P. falciparum bottleneck.

 Figure 1. Overview of the dating of the evolution of the Laverania.
(a) Maximum likelihood tree of the Laverania based on the “Lav12sp” set of orthologues. 
All bootstrap values are 100. Coalescence based estimates of the timing of speciation events 
are displayed on nodes (MYA - million years ago), based on intergenic and genic 
alignments. (b) Multiple sequentially Markovian coalescent estimates of the effective 
population size (Ne) in the P. falciparum and P. praefalciparum population. Assuming our 
estimate of the number of mitotic events per year, a bottleneck occurred in P. falciparum 
4,000-6,000 years ago. The y-axis shows the natural logarithm (Ln) of Ne. Bootstrapping 
(pale lines) was performed by randomly resampling segregating sites from the input 50 
times.

regions closest to the Pfam Duffy binding domain. CIDRn is a new domain discovered in 
this study in Clade A. Only domains from var genes longer than 2.5 kb were considered. 
Heat map colours blue-yellow-white indicate decreasing copy numbers. (b) Graphical 
representation of similarity between domains, using domains from var genes longer than 
2.5kb. Domains are coloured by species and clustered by a minimum BLAST cut-off of 45% 
global identity. Larger circles denote var genes in the opposite orientation. (c) Maximum 
likelihood trees of the Acidic Terminal Sequence (ATS). Apparent ATS sequences from 
clade A that cluster with clade B are indicated (**).
