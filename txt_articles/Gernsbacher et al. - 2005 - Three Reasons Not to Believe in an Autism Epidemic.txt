Abstract
According to some lay groups, the nation is experiencing an autism epidemic—a rapid escalation 
in the prevalence of autism for unknown reasons. However, no sound scientific evidence indicates 
that the increasing number of diagnosed cases of autism arises from anything other than purposely 
broadened diagnostic criteria, coupled with deliberately greater public awareness and intentionally 
improved case finding. Why is the public perception so disconnected from the scientific evidence? 
In this article we review three primary sources of misunderstanding: lack of awareness about the 
changing diagnostic criteria, uncritical acceptance of a conclusion illogically drawn in a 
California-based study, and inattention to a crucial feature of the “child count” data reported 
annually by the U.S. Department of Education.
Keywords
autism; epidemiology; epidemic
If you have learned anything about autism lately from the popular media, you most likely 
have learned—erroneously— that there is “a mysterious upsurge” in the prevalence of 
autism (New York Times, October 20, 2002, Section 4, p. 10), creating a “baffling … 
outbreak” (CBSnews.com, October 18, 2002), in which new cases are “exploding in 
number” (Time, May 6, 2002, p. 48), and “no one knows why” (USA Today, May 17, 2004, 
p. 8D). At least a handful of U.S. Congress members decree on their .govWeb sites that the 
nation is facing an autism epidemic. Several national media have erroneously concluded that 
a set of data from California “confirms the autism epidemic,” and the largest autism-
advocacy organization in the world has expressed alarm over astronomical percentage 
increases in the number of autistic children served in the public schools since 1992. 
However, no sound scientific evidence indicates that the increase in the number of 
diagnosed cases of autism arises from anything other than intentionally broadened 
diagnostic criteria, coupled with deliberately greater public awareness and conscientiously 
improved case finding. How did public perception become so misaligned from scientific 
evidence? In this article, we review three major sources of misunderstanding.

 THE CHANGING DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM
The phenomenon of autism has existed most likely since the origins of human society. In 
retrospect, numerous historical figures—for instance, the 18th-century “wild boy of 
Aveyron”— fit autism diagnostic criteria but were not so diagnosed in their day (Frith, 
1989). Only in the 1940s did a constellation of differences in social interaction, 
communication, and focused interests come to be categorized by Leo Kanner as “autism.” 
However, another 40 years would elapse before American psychiatric practice incorporated 
criteria for autism into what was by then the third edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III; American Psychiatric Association, APA, 1980). 
Thus, estimates of the prevalence of autism prior to 1980 were based on individual 
clinicians’ (e.g., Kanner & Eisenberg, 1956) or specific researchers’ (e.g., Rutter, 1978) 
conceptions—and fluctuated because of factors that continue to introduce variation into 
current-day estimates (e.g., variation in the size of the population sampled and the manner of 
identification).
Autism has remained in the DSM (under the title, Pervasive Developmental Disorders), but 
not without modification through subsequent editions. Whereas the 1980 DSM-III entry 
required satisfying six mandatory criteria, the more recent 1994 DSM-IV (APA, 1994) offers 
16 optional criteria—only half of which need to be met. Moreover, the severe phrasing of 
the 1980 mandatory criteria contrasts with the more inclusive phrasing of the 1994 optional 
criteria. For instance, to qualify for a diagnosis according to the 1980 criteria an individual 
needed to exhibit “a pervasive lack of responsiveness to other people” (emphasis added; 
APA, 1980, p. 89); in contrast, according to 1994 criteria an individual must demonstrate 
only “a lack of spontaneous seeking to share … achievements with other people” (APA, 
1994, p. 70) and peer relationships less sophisticated than would be predicted by the 
individual’s developmental level. The 1980 mandatory criteria of “gross deficits in language 
development” (emphasis added; APA, 1980, p. 89) and “if speech is present, peculiar speech 
patterns such as immediate and delayed echolalia, metaphorical language, pronominal 
reversal” (APA, 1980, p. 89) were replaced by the 1994 options of difficulty “sustain[ing] a 
conversation” (APA, 1994, p. 70) or “lack of varied … social imitative play” (p. 70). 
“Bizarre responses to various aspects of the environment” (emphasis added; APA, 1980, p. 
90) became “persistent preoccupation with parts of objects” (APA, 1994, p. 71).
Furthermore, whereas the earlier 1980 (DSM-III) entry comprised only two diagnostic 
categories (infantile autism and childhood onset pervasive developmental disorder), the 
more recent 1994 (DSM-IV) entry comprises five. Three of those five categories connote 
what is commonly called autism: Autistic Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not 
Otherwise Specified (PDDNOS), and Asperger’s Disorder. Autistic Disorder requires 
meeting half of the 16 criteria, but Asperger’s Disorder, which did not enter the DSM until 
1994, involves only two thirds of that half, and PDDNOS, which entered the DSM in 1987, 
is defined by subthreshold symptoms. Therefore, Asperger’s Disorder and PDDNOS are 
often considered “milder variants.” These milder variants can account for nearly three 
fourths of current autism diagnoses (Chakrabarti & Fombonne, 2001). Consider also the 
recent practice of codiagnosing autism alongside known medical and genetic conditions 
(e.g., Down syndrome, Tourette’s syndrome, and cerebral palsy; Gillberg & Coleman, 
Gernsbacher et al.

 2000); the contemporary recognition that autism can exist among people at every level of 
measured intelligence (Baird et al., 2000), the deliberate efforts to identify autism in 
younger and younger children (Filipek et al., 2000), and the speculation that many 
individuals who would meet present-day criteria were previously mis- or undiagnosed 
(Wing & Potter, 2002), including some of the most accomplished, albeit idiosyncratic, 
historical figures such as Isaac Newton, Lewis Carroll, W.B. Yeats, Thomas Jefferson, and 
Bill Gates (Fitzgerald, 2004).
THE CALIFORNIA DATA
In California, persons diagnosed with autism (and other developmental disabilities) qualify 
for services administered by the statewide Department of Developmental Services (DDS). In 
1999, the California DDS reported that from 1987 to 1998 the number of individuals served 
under the category of “autism” had increased by 273% (California DDS, 1999). Alarmed by 
this 273% increase, the California legislature commissioned the University of California 
Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (M.I.N.D.) Institute to determine 
whether the increase could be explained by changes in diagnostic criteria. The M.I.N.D. 
Institute (2002) concluded, on the basis of data we describe next, that there was “no 
evidence that a loosening in the diagnostic criteria has contributed to the increased number 
of autism clients served by the [California DDS] Regional Centers” (p. 5). Although this 
unrefereed conclusion made national headlines and continues to be articulated on 
innumerable Web sites, it is unwarranted.
The study involved two samples of children who had been served under the California DDS 
category of “autism”: One sample was born between 1983 and 1985 (the earlier cohort); the 
other sample was born between 1993 and 1995 (the more recent cohort). Both cohorts were 
assessed with the same autism diagnostic instrument (an interview conducted with care 
providers). However, the autism diagnostic instrument was based on DSM-IV criteria—
criteria that were not even published until 1994. When the same percentage of children in 
the earlier and the more recent cohort met the more recent DSM-IV criteria, the researchers 
imprudently concluded that the “observed increase in autism cases cannot be explained by a 
loosening in the criteria used to make the diagnosis” (M.I.N.D. Institute, 2002, p. 7).
To understand the fallacy of the conclusion, consider the following analogy, based on male 
height and graphically illustrated in Figure 1. Suppose the criterion for “tall” was 74.5 in. 
and taller in the mid-1980s, but the criterion was loosened to 72 in. and taller in the 
mid-1990s. A diagnostic instrument based on the looser, more recent criterion of 72 in. 
would identify males who met the 74.5-in. criterion as well as those who met the 72-in. 
criterion.1 Although a perfectly reliable diagnostic instrument based on a looser criterion 
would identify 100% of the individuals who meet the looser criterion along with 100% of 
the individuals who meet the more restricted criterion, a highly reliable instrument might 
1Wing and Potter (2002) provide a similar illustration. The same percentage of children who met Kanner’s earlier, more restricted 
criteria met DSM-IV’s more recent, broadened criteria; if the child was autistic according to Kanner’s restricted criteria, the child was 
autistic according to DSM-IV’s broadened criteria. Of course, the reverse was not true. Only 33 to 45% of the children who met more 
recent DSM-IV criteria met earlier Kanner criteria.

 identify about 90% of each group; this is the percentage of each cohort in the California 
study who met the more recent autism criteria.
Most crucially, broadening the criterion will result in a dramatic increase in diagnosed cases. 
For instance, census data allow us to estimate that 2,778 males in McClennan County, Texas 
would be called tall by the more restricted 74.5-in. criterion, and 10,360 males would be 
called tall by the broader 72-in. criterion; if those two criteria had been applied a decade 
apart, a 273% increase in the number of males called tall would have emerged—without any 
real increase in Texans’ height. In the same way, the 273% increase from 2,778 versus 
10,360 California children who received services for “autism” in 1987 versus 1998 could 
well be a function of broadened criteria.
As we have already detailed, the commonly applied diagnostic criteria for autism broadened 
nationally from the 1980s to the 1990s; thus, it would be unusual if the criteria used for 
eligibility in California had not also broadened during this time. Two further aspects of the 
California data suggest that the criteria must have broadened. First, children in the more 
recent cohort were dramatically less likely to have intellectual impairment: Whereas 61% of 
the children in the earlier cohort were identified as having intellectual impairments, only 
27% of the children in the more recent cohort were so identified. The lower rate of 
intellectual impairment in the more recent cohort matches recent epidemiological data, and 
the difference between the two rates suggests a major difference between the two cohorts 
(e.g., that the more recent cohort was drawn from a less cognitively impaired population).
Second, on two of the three dimensions measured by the autism diagnostic instrument, the 
children in the more recent cohort were, on average, less symptomatic than the children 
from the earlier cohort. The researchers stated that although these differences were 
statistically significant (i.e., they exceeded the criterion of a statistical test), they were likely 
not clinically significant (i.e., they were likely not of significance to the clinical 
presentation); therefore, the researchers suggested that these differences should not be taken 
as evidence that the diagnostic criteria had broadened. However, refer again to the tallness 
analogy: Comparing two cohorts of males in McClennan County diagnosed according to our 
more restricted (74.5-in.) versus our broader (72-in.) criterion would probably result in a 
statistically significant difference between the two cohorts’ average height—but the 
difference would be just about an inch (i.e., most likely not a clinically significant 
difference).
THE “CHILD COUNT” DATA
The purpose of the federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), passed in 
1991, is to ensure that all children with disabilities are provided a free, appropriate, public 
education including an individually designed program. Schools comply with the IDEA by 
reporting to the federal Department of Education an annual “child count” of the number of 
children with disabilities served. It is the data from these annual child counts that have been 
the most egregiously misused in arguments for an autism epidemic.
For example, in October 2003, the Autism Society of America sent its 20,000 members the 
following electronic message: “Figures from the most recent U. S. Department of 
Gernsbacher et al.

 Education’s 2002 Report to Congress on IDEA reveal that the number of students with 
autism [ages 6 to 21] in America’s schools jumped an alarming 1,354% in the eight-year 
period from the school year 1991–92 to 2000–01” (emphasis added). What the Autism 
Society failed to note is the following fact (available in the Report to Congress, immediately 
under the autism data entries): Prior to the 1991–1992 school year, there was no child count 
of students with autism; autism did not even exist as an IDEA reporting category. Moreover, 
in 1991–1992, use of the autism reporting category was optional (it was required only in 
subsequent years).
Whenever a new category is introduced, if it is viable, increases in its usage will ensue. 
Consider another IDEA reporting category introduced along with autism in 1991–1992: 
“traumatic brain injury.” From 1991–1992 to 2000–2001, this category soared an 
astronomical 5,059%. Likewise, the reporting category “developmental delay,” which was 
introduced only in 1997–1998, grew 663% in only 3 years.
After the initial year, the number of children reported under the IDEA category of autism 
has increased by approximately 23% annually. Why the continuing annual increase? As is 
the case with new options in the marketplace, like cellular phones and high-speed Internet, 
new reporting categories in the annual child count are not capitalized upon instantaneously; 
they require incrementally magnified awareness and augmentation or reallocation of 
resources. Currently no state reports the number of children with autism that would be 
expected based on the results of three recent, large-scale epidemiological studies, which 
identified 5.8 to 6.7 children per 1,000 for the broader autism spectrum (Baird et al., 2000; 
Bertrand et al., 2001; Chakrabarti & Fombonne, 2001). In 2002–2003, front-runners Oregon 
and Minnesota reported 4.3 and 3.5 children with autism per 1,000, respectively, while 
Colorado, Mississippi, and New Mexico reported only 0.8, 0.7, and 0.7 children with autism 
per 1,000. Thus, most likely IDEA child counts will continue to increase until the number 
reported by each state approaches the number of children identified in the epidemiological 
studies.
Why do states vary so widely in the number of children reported (or served)? Each state’s 
department of education specifies its own diagnostic criteria, and states differ (as do school 
districts within states, and individual schools within school districts) in the value given to a 
diagnosis in terms of services received. States also vary from year to year in the number of 
children served and reported. For instance, Massachusetts historically reported the lowest 
percentage of children with autism: only 0.4 or 0.5 per 1,000 from 1992 through 2001. Then, 
in 2002, Massachusetts reported a 400% increase in one year, when it began using student-
level data (i.e., actually counting the students) rather than applying a ratio, which was 
calculated in 1992, based on the proportion of students in each disability classification as 
reported in 1992. In their 2002 IDEA report to Congress, Massachusetts state officials 
warned that the increase will continue for several years as “districts better understand how to 
submit their data at the student level” (IDEA, 2002, p. 4) and “all districts comply 
completely with the new reporting methods” (IDEA, 2002, p. 4).

 OTHER REASONS NOT TO BELIEVE IN AN AUTISM EPIDEMIC
In this article we have detailed three reasons why some laypersons mistakenly believe that 
there is an autism epidemic. They are unaware of the purposeful broadening of diagnostic 
criteria, coupled with deliberately greater public awareness; they accept the unwarranted 
conclusions of the M.I.N.D. Institute study; and they fail to realize that autism was not even 
an IDEA reporting category until the early 1990s and incremental increases will most likely 
continue until the schools are identifying and serving the number of children identified in 
epidemiological studies. Apart from a desire to be aligned with scientific reasoning, there 
are other reasons not to believe in an autism epidemic.
Epidemics solicit causes; false epidemics solicit false causes. Google autism and epidemic to 
witness the range of suspected causes of the mythical autism epidemic. Epidemics also 
connote danger. What message do we send autistic children and adults when we call their 
increasing number an epidemic? A pandemic? A scourge? Realizing that the increasing 
prevalence rates are most likely due to noncatastrophic mechanisms, such as purposely 
broader diagnostic criteria and greater public awareness, should not, however, diminish 
societal responsibility to support the increasing numbers of individuals being diagnosed with 
autism. Neither should enthusiasm for scientific inquiry into the variety and extent of human 
behavioral, neuroanatomical, and genotypic diversity in our population be dampened.
