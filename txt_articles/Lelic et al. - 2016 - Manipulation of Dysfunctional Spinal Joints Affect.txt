Objectives. Studies have shown decreases in N30 somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) peak amplitudes following spinal
manipulation (SM) of dysfunctional segments in subclinical pain (SCP) populations. This study sought to verify these findings
and to investigate underlying brain sources that may be responsible for such changes. Methods. Nineteen SCP volunteers attended
two experimental sessions, SM and control in random order. SEPs from 62-channel EEG cap were recorded following median nerve
stimulation (1000 stimuli at 2.3 Hz) before and after either intervention. Peak-to-peak amplitude and latency analysis was completed
for different SEPs peak. Dipolar models of underlying brain sources were built by using the brain electrical source analysis. Two-
way repeated measures ANOVA was used to assessed differences in N30 amplitudes, dipole locations, and dipole strengths. Results.
SM decreased the N30 amplitude by 16.9 ¬± 31.3% (ùëÉ = 0.02), while no differences were seen following the control intervention
(ùëÉ = 0.4). Brain source modeling revealed a 4-source model but only the prefrontal source showed reduced activity by 20.2¬±12.2%
(ùëÉ = 0.03) following SM. Conclusion. A single session of spinal manipulation of dysfunctional segments in subclinical pain patients
alters somatosensory processing at the cortical level, particularly within the prefrontal cortex.
1. Introduction
Over the past decade, there has been a growing body of
evidence to suggest that neural plastic changes occur follow-
ing chiropractic spinal manipulation [1]. Investigators uti-
lizing techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation
and somatosensory evoked electroencephalographic (EEG)
potentials have suggested that neuroplastic brain changes
occur in structures such as the primary sensory cortex,
primary motor cortex, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and
cerebellum [2‚Äì6]. However, the evidence for the involvement
of these brain structures is indirect. Although EEG measures
neuronal activity directly (with high millisecond time reso-
lution), it has poor spatial resolution, making it difficult to
know exactly where in the brain the changes are occurring.
Studies with only a few recording EEG electrodes [3, 6] allow
investigation of evoked potential amplitudes and latencies
and have shown changes in the N30 somatosensory evoked
potential (SEP) amplitudes following spinal manipulation,
but they do not allow identification of changes in the
individual areas of the brain generating the neural activity
that underlies the evoked signals.
In recent decades, efforts have been made to improve
the spatial resolution of EEG [7]. These methods have

successfully been used in a number of SEP studies, gen-
erally showing a five-dipole model involving primary and
secondary somatosensory cortices, insula, cingulate, and
prefrontal cortex [8‚Äì10].
With this study, we set out to utilize brain electrical source
analysis to explore which brain sources are responsible for
changes in N30 amplitude following a single session of spinal
manipulation. We hypothesized that a single session of chiro-
practic spinal manipulation would reduce the N30 amplitude
and that this amplitude reduction would be attributed to
decreased strength of one or more of the underlying brain
sources. Therefore, the aims of this study were to
(1) compare amplitudes of N30 potential between base-
line and postcontrol intervention (sham chiropractic
treatment),
(2) compare amplitudes of the N30 potential between
baseline and postspinal manipulation session,
(3) assess whether there are differences in N30 ampli-
tudes between the control and the spinal manipula-
tion session,
(4) assess whether there are differences between the chi-
ropractic and the control sessions in the underlying
brain sources.
2. Experimental Procedures
2.1. Subjects. Nineteen subclinical pain volunteers were
included in the study (9 males, 25.6 ¬± 3.9 years). Subclinical
pain (SCP) refers to recurrent spinal ache, pain, or stiffness
for which the person has not yet sought treatment [11, 12].
The study was conducted according to the Declaration of
Helsinki. The local Ethics Committee (N-20140027) approved
the study. The study was conducted in the laboratories at the
Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Aalborg
University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.
2.2. SEP Stimulating and Recording Parameters. The EEG
signals were recorded with Neuroscan System (version 4.5,
El Paso, TX) from 62 scalp electrodes using the extended 10-
20 system montage (Quick-Cap International, Neuroscan, El
Paso, TX). The subjects were seated comfortably in supine
position with eyes open throughout the entire recording.
The subjects received electrical stimulations applied to the
median nerve at the right wrist to evoke somatosensory
potentials. Two trials of 1000 pulses were given in each
session: one trial before treatment (control or chiropractic)
and one trial after the treatment. The pulses were given at
2.3 Hz stimulation frequency and were of 0.2 ms length. The
intensity of the stimulus was modified to be 1 mA above the
stimulation intensity that elicited clear twitch of the thumb.
The EEG signal was sampled at 10,000 Hz with open online
filters.
2.3. Experimental Protocol. The subjects were asked to attend
three sessions. A screening session for inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria was followed by the two experimental ses-
sions (control and chiropractic) in random order. During
the screening session, a chiropractor assessed the subject‚Äôs
spine and history to assure that they fit the criteria for subclin-
ical pain, had no contraindications to receiving spinal manip-
ulation, and displayed the presence of spinal dysfunction. The
subjects were excluded from the study if any of the following
was true: no evidence of spinal dysfunction was present, they
were in current pain, they had sought previous treatment for
their spinal issues, or they had contraindications to receiving
spinal manipulation.
2.4. Interventions
2.4.1. Spinal Manipulation. The entire spine and both sacroil-
iac joints were assessed for segmental dysfunction (also
referred to as vertebral subluxation by many members of
the chiropractic profession) and treated where they were
deemed necessary by a registered chiropractor with fifteen
years of clinical experience. The clinical indicators that were
used to assess the function of the spine prior to and after
each spinal manipulation intervention included assessing
for tenderness to palpation of the relevant joints, manually
palpating for restricted intersegmental range of motion,
assessing for palpable asymmetric intervertebral muscle ten-
sion, and any abnormal or blocked joint play and end-feel of
the joints. All of these biomechanical characteristics are used
by the chiropractic profession as clinical indicators of spinal
dysfunction [13]. All of the spinal manipulations carried out
in this study were high-velocity, low-amplitude thrusts to
the spine or pelvic joints. This is a standard manipulation
technique used by chiropractors and is also referred to as
spinal adjustments. The mechanical properties of this type of
central nervous system perturbation have been investigated;
and although the actual force applied to the subject‚Äôs spine
depends on the therapist, the patient, and the spinal location
of the manipulation, the general shape of the force-time
history of spinal manipulations is very consistent [14] and the
duration of the thrust is always less than 200 milliseconds
[15]. The high-velocity type of manipulation was chosen
specifically because previous research has shown that reflex
electromyographic activation observed after manipulations
only occurred after high-velocity, low-amplitude manipula-
tions (as compared with lower-velocity mobilizations) [16].
This manipulation technique has also been previously used in
studies that have investigated the neurophysiological effects
of spinal manipulation [1].
2.4.2. Control Intervention. As the subjects in this study were
na¬®
ƒ±ve to chiropractic care, we provided a sham treatment
session. One of the investigators, who was not a chiropractor,
therefore simulated a chiropractic treatment session. This
included passive and active movements of the subject‚Äôs head,
spine, and body, similar to what was done by the chiroprac-
tor who provided the actual chiropractic treatment during
the spinal manipulation intervention. Thus, this control
intervention involved the subjects being moved into the
manipulation setup positions similar to how the chiropractor
would normally set up a subject prior to applying the thrust to
the spine to achieve the manipulations. The sham treatment

provider was particularly careful not to put pressure on any
individual spinal segments. Loading a joint, as is done prior
to spinal manipulation, has been shown to alter paraspinal
proprioceptive firing in anesthetized cats [17] and therefore
was carefully avoided by ending the movement prior to
end-range-of-motion when passively moving the subjects.
No spinal manipulation was performed during any control
intervention. This control intervention was intended to act as
a sham treatment session as well as to act as a physiological
control for possible changes occurring due to the cutaneous,
muscular, or vestibular input that would occur with the type
of passive and active movements involved in preparing a
subject/patient for a manipulation. It also acted as a control
for the effects of the stimulation necessary to collect the
dependent measures of the study, and for the time required
to carry out the manipulation intervention.
2.5. Data Analysis
2.5.1. Preprocessing of the Evoked Potentials. The preprocess-
ing of SEP data was done in Neuroscan (version 4.5, El
Paso, TX). SEP data were first bandpass-filtered between 1
and 1000 Hz. Then, the raw data were divided into epochs
and visually cleaned for artifacts. Baseline and treatment
recordings were then compared in order to see whether one
recording had more epochs deleted due to artifacts; if this
was the case, then the recording that had less epochs deleted
was further cleaned by deleting the last few epochs such
that the two recordings would have the same number of
epochs. This was done to reduce the influence of number of
epochs on SEP amplitude. The epochs were then averaged
and the noisy channels were interpolated. Finally, data were
referenced to the parietal-temporal electrode contralateral to
the stimulated arm (TP7) to increase the amplitude of N30
potential at the frontal electrodes.
2.5.2. Amplitude Analysis of N30. Amplitude analysis of the
N30 peak was done at the frontal electrode contralateral to
the stimulated arm (F3). This electrode was chosen because
visual inspection revealed that the N30 peak tended to be the
highest at this sight. The amplitude was measured as peak-to-
peak from amplitude of the positivity preceding the N30 to
the amplitude where N30 was the highest.
2.5.3. Source Localization. Dipolar source modeling was
performed in brain electrical source modeling (BESA) (BESA
Research 5.3; MEGIS Software GmbH, Gr¬®
afelfing, Germany).
The potential distributions over the scalp from preset voltage
dipoles within the brain were calculated. Then, the agreement
between the recorded and calculated field distributions was
evaluated. The percentage of data that could not be explained
by the model was expressed as residual variance (RV). A
spherical three-shell model with an 85 mm radius was
used and it was assumed that the brain surface was 70 mm
from the centre of the sphere [8]. For both experimental
sessions, the model was first created on grand-averages of
each baseline recording. Then, these models were applied
to their respective posttreatment grand mean files in order
to get an idea of whether any changes existed. Then, these
models were applied to the individual data. In order to
obtain an idea of the number and location of sources, the
dipolar models were LORETA-guided. LORETA is a current
density method which yields blurred source images. The
advantage of LORETA is that no a priori constraints regarding
the number and location of sources are required and its
accuracy has been proven to be high [18]. Once the dipolar
models for all the subjects and sessions were done, the source
activation waveforms were exported to MATLAB (version
8.4.0, The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) and brain
source strengths were computed by means of area under
the curve (AUC). The AUC was calculated between 25 and
45 ms after stimulus such that mainly the source strength
during the N30 peak was taken into consideration. The model
calculated by BESA is a hypothetical one and does not exclude
other solutions, but, nevertheless, it can be validated when
applicable to individual data and consistent with anatomical
and physiological knowledge of identified source areas [19].
2.5.4. Statistics. Descriptive statistics are reported as mean ¬±
SD. To compare data between the control session and chi-
ropractic session, two way repeated measures analysis of
variance was used (ANOVA). N30 amplitudes and brain
source strengths were compared between the two sessions.
If overall significance for any of the ANOVA tests was
found, all pairwise multiple comparison procedures (Holm-
Sidak method) were done in order to see which variables
were significantly different. The software package SigmaStat
version 3.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for
statistical analysis.
3. Results
SEPs were successfully recorded in all 19 volunteers. The
stimulation intensity used during session one was 8.7¬±3.7 mA
and during session two it was 7.9 ¬± 3.1 mA. There were no
significant differences between the two sessions (ùëÉ = 0.5).
Upon questioning, after both sessions were conducted,
and despite the subjects being totally na¬®
ƒ±ve to chiropractic,
the majority of the subjects guessed correctly in which
session they received the actual spinal manipulations and
which was the sham. When asked why they were sure which
session was real, the majority noted they could feel that the
chiropractic session actually changed the way their body felt
and functioned.
3.1. N30 Amplitude Results. There was a significant postinter-
vention difference between the two groups. Post hoc analysis
revealed that the N30 amplitude was reduced in the spinal
manipulation group following the treatment (ùëÉ = 0.02),
while it remained stable in the control group (ùëÉ = 0.4). Please
see Figure 1.
3.2. Brain Source Localization. One of the subjects had
poor signal-to-noise ratio and the peaks could not be iden-
tified when looking at all the electrodes simultaneously;
this subject was excluded from source localization analysis.

For the remaining subjects, the time interval between 20
and 60 ms with respect to stimulation was chosen for brain
source analysis. The LORETA solution revealed four distinct
solutions during this time interval: contralateral primary
somatosensory cortex (SI), prefrontal cortex, cingulate, and
bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). Therefore,
we assumed a 4-source solution in these brain areas. We
placed the first dipole in contralateral SI, a second dipole
in contralateral prefrontal cortex, third dipole in cingulate
cortex, and fourth dipole in contralateral SII, and fifth dipole
had a symmetry constraint to the contralateral SII dipole
based on the symmetry assumption of the two hemispheres
[20]. Once all the dipoles were fixed in their position, the
orientations were allowed to move freely and the solution
shown in Figure 2 was obtained. This model was then applied
to all the individual data and the final solution shown in
Table 1 was obtained. It can be seen that the prefrontal cortex
tended to have the highest strength during this time interval.
The RV values were below 10% for all the subjects/sessions.
Source strength analysis revealed that chiropractic treat-
ment reduced the strength of the prefrontal source (ùëÉ = 0.03),
while all the other strengths remained stable (ùëÉ > 0.2). Please
see Figure 3.
4. Discussion
This study resulted in two major findings. Firstly, this study
reproduced previous findings of SEPs studies that have shown
that adjusting dysfunctional spinal segments alters early sen-
sorimotor integration (SMI) of input from the upper limb (as
evidenced with a decrease in N30 SEP complex amplitudes)
[3, 6, 21]. The second major finding of this study was that
we were able to show, using dipole source localization, that
this change in SMI that occurs after spinal manipulation
predominantly happens in the prefrontal cortex.
4.1. The N30 Peak. The N30 SEP peak has been shown to have
multiple neural generators including primary sensory cortex,
basal ganglia, thalamus, premotor areas, and primary motor
cortex [22‚Äì28]. The frontal N30 peak is therefore thought to
reflect early SMI [29, 30].

The N30 component is the most vulnerable SEP compo-
nent to the gating effect that occurs during voluntary muscle
contraction [31] and is known to occur even when subjects
only mentally imagine moving muscles [31, 32]. Despite early
theories to the contrary [26, 27, 33], the supplementary
motor area (SMA) has been ruled out as a source for the
N30 in studies with intracortical electrodes stereotactically
implanted in the frontal lobe of epileptic patients, as they
demonstrated that no early SEP was generated in pre-SMA
or SMA-proper in the first 50 ms after stimulation [34, 35].
Research has shown that the frontal N30 component
has independent cortical generators with a separate thala-
mocortical input [25, 36]. Intracortical human recordings
have also shown afferent information following median nerve
stimulation project directly to the primary motor cortex [36],
as has been documented previously in primates [37, 38]. The
frontal N30 component is therefore subject to more complex
inputs than those flowing on from the parietal N20 generator
(i.e., S1) alone.
The primary motor cortex is one of the known sources
of the N30 [28]. Waberski et al. [28] applied dipole source
localization and current density reconstruction within indi-
vidual realistically shaped head models and demonstrated
that the source of the N30 peak resided within the pre-
central motor cortex (area 4). More recently, Cebolla et
al. [30] have used swLORETA (standardized weighted Low
Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography) taking into
account both phasic and oscillatory generators to determine

the neural generators of the N30. They demonstrated that the
N30 is generated by network activity in the motor, premotor,
and prefrontal cortex, adding further weight to its role as a
marker of neural processing relevant to SMI.
Several studies have linked the basal ganglia with the N30
SEP component [39‚Äì41] and consider it to reflect activity
in basal ganglionic thalamocortical loops linking primary
motor cortex, premotor cortex, and prefrontal cortex [41].
There is a number of clinical research studies to support this
view since the N30 peak amplitude is decreased in Parkinson‚Äôs
disease patients [39, 40, 42], and deep brain stimulation of
basal ganglia nuclei such as the subthalamic nucleus can pro-
duce a selective increase of the N30 amplitude, thought to be
due to improved SMA functional activity [39]. Furthermore,
blocking the neuromuscular junction in Parkinson‚Äôs disease
patients also increases the N30 amplitude as well as reducing
the rigidity of their muscles [40].
The current study adds to previous work by not only
confirming that spinal manipulation of dysfunctional joints
decreases the N30 SEP peak amplitude but also demonstrat-
ing that this decrease occurs predominantly in one of the
known neural generators of N30, that is, the prefrontal cortex.

4.2. The Prefrontal Cortex and Executive Function. Our cur-
rent study findings confirmed that spinal manipulation of
dysfunctional spinal segments reduces the N30 SEP peak
amplitude and using dipole source localization demonstrated
that this change is taking place in the prefrontal cortex. This
suggests that, at least in part, the mechanisms by which spinal
manipulation improves performance are due to a change in
function at the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is
known to play a vital role in SMI and is also responsible for a
number of other functions. The prefrontal cortex is known to
be a key structure responsible for the performance of what is
known as ‚Äúexecutive functions‚Äù [43, 44]. Executive function is
the mechanism by which the brain integrates and coordinates
the operations of multiple neural systems to solve problems
and achieve goals based on the ever-changing environment
around us [44, 45]. Executive function is considered to be
a product of the coordinated operation of various neural
systems and is essential for achieving any particular goal. The
prefrontal cortex is believed to be the main brain structure
responsible for enabling this coordination and control. It
requires planning a sequence of subtasks to accomplish a
goal, focusing attention on relevant information as well as
inhibiting irrelevant distractors, being able to switch attention
between tasks, monitoring memory, initiation of activity, and
responding to stimuli [44‚Äì46]. A change in prefrontal activity
following chiropractic care may therefore explain and/or
link some of the varied improvements in neural function
previously observed in the literature, such as improved
joint position sense error [47], reaction time [48], cortical
processing [3, 48], cortical sensorimotor integration [3, 5, 6],
reflex excitability [49‚Äì52], motor control [5, 53], and lower
limb muscle strength [54].
To accomplish the coordinated operations of multiple
neural systems and structures, the prefrontal cortex must
monitor the activities in other cortical and subcortical struc-
tures and control and integrate their operations by sending
command signals in a so-called ‚Äútop-down‚Äù manner. This is
a complex operation, and the importance of this monitoring,
integration, and coordination is highlighted in studies where
damage to the prefrontal cortex has been shown to impair
the ability to create new and adaptive action programs or
choose the best among several equally probable alternatives,
despite such individuals displaying normal IQs in most psy-
chological tests, having normal long-term memory functions,
and exhibiting normal perceptual, motor, and language skills
[43]. The change in prefrontal cortex as seen in this study
therefore suggests that the altered input from dysfunctional
joints that leads to altered processing of somatosensory inputs
can influence processing of somatosensory information by
the prefrontal cortex. Chiropractic care, by treating the joint
dysfunction, appears to change processing by the prefrontal
cortex. This suggests that chiropractic care may as well
have benefits that exceed simply reducing pain or improving
muscle function and may explain some claims regarding this
made by chiropractors [55, 56].
4.3. Study Considerations. Although the change in N30 due
to chiropractic treatment is an important finding, it is not
clear how long this finding lasts. To date, some of the authors
of this study have shown that the N30 changes on average are
present for at least 20‚Äì30 minutes after spinal manipulation
[3]. For some subjects, the changes were still evident at
30 minutes after spinal manipulation and we have not yet
followed up for longer than 30 minutes, due to the length of
the study as is.
The authors of this study assume that since spinal manip-
ulation is known to reduce pain and improve function in
clinical trials [57‚Äì59], the observed reduction of the N30
amplitudes reflects a beneficial change. However, it should
be noted that reduced N30 SEP peak amplitudes have been
found in the literature in pathological condition such as
Parkinson‚Äôs disease [42]. This should therefore be followed up
in future studies.
The calculated dipolar sources from the surface EPs
should not be seen as precise indicators of where brain activ-
ity is, but more as an estimate of where dominant activity
is occurring (the so-called ‚Äúcenter of gravity‚Äù). Brain source
localization, therefore, allows us to estimate where the dom-
inant brain activity is occurring due to sensory stimulation
and how this activity is modified following chiropractic
treatment.
5. Conclusion
This study has reproduced the findings of previous SEP
studies that have shown that adjusting dysfunctional spinal
segments alters early SMI of input from the upper limb (as
evidenced with a decrease in N30 SEP complex amplitudes).
It also expands on this finding by using dipole source
localization to show that this change in SMI that occurs after
spinal manipulation predominantly happens in the prefrontal
cortex. Hence, the mechanisms behind pain relief following
spinal manipulation in low level pain patients are likely due
to improved SMI and appropriate motor control, as this is the
key function of the prefrontal cortex.
