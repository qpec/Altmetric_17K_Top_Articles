Abstract
Importance—Initial results of this intergroup trial of imatinib for patients with metastatic/ 
unresectable GIST were reported in 2008 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18235122). 
Updated results reported here show long-term survival with a significant subset of patients 
surviving 10 or more years, as well as new molecular disease insights.
Obective—To determine long-term survival of patients treated on SWOG study S0033, and to 
present new molecular data regarding treatment outcomes.
Design, Setting and Participants—Patients were required to have advanced GIST that was 
not surgically curable. Updated clinical information was obtained, including post-progression 
therapies. Using modern sequencing technologies, we analyzed 20 cases originally classified as 
“wild-type”. This intergroup study was coordinated by SWOG, a cooperative group member 
within the National Clinical Trials Network, with participation by member/affiliate institutions.
Interventions—Patients were randomly assigned to one of two dose levels of imatinib: 400 mg 
once daily vs. 400 mg twice daily, and were treated until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity.
Main Outcome Measure—The primary end point was overall survival. The primary aim of this 
report was to correlate updated survival with clinical and molecular factors, as well as to 
enumerate and describe patterns of post-imatinib therapies in long-term survivors.
Results—Of 695 eligible patients, 189 survived 8 years or longer, 95 on the 400 mg dose arm 
and 94 on the 800 mg arm. The 10-year estimate of overall survival (OS) is 23%. Among 142 
long-term survivors, imatinib was the sole therapy administered in 49%, with additional systemic 
agents administered to 54 patients (38%). Resequencing studies of 20 cases originally classified as 
KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GIST revealed that 17 (85%) harboring a pathogenic mutation, most 
commonly a mutation of a subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex. We report the 
first data on SDH-deficient GIST patients treated with imatinib in a prospective therapeutic study.
Conclusions and Relevance—A subset of patients with metastatic GIST enjoys durable long-
term overall survival on imatinib. Although this study provides guidance for management of GIST 
harboring the most common KIT and PDGFRA mutations, optimal management of other 
genotypic subtypes remains unclear.
INTRODUCTION
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common sarcoma of the gastro-intestinal 
tract. It comprises less than 1% of all gastrointestinal tumors and has an annual incidence of 
approximately 7-10 cases per million as determined by multiple population-based studies.1–5 
A major breakthrough occurred with the discovery of activating mutations of the KIT gene

 resulting in oncogenic constitutive signaling in the majority of GISTs and the subsequent 
use of KIT (CD117) immunostaining as the first diagnostic marker for GIST.6,7
Prior to the year 2000, GIST was documented to be highly resistant to cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, with no available effective treatment and a uniformly grim prognosis for 
patients with metastatic or unresectable disease.8, 9,10 A brief report published in 2001 
described the impressive effects of a pilot proof-of-concept protocol using the tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate in a patient with metastatic GIST harboring a KIT exon 
11-mutation that had been previously refractory to chemotherapy.11 Since then, several 
phase II and III trials in metastatic disease were conducted, confirming the efficacy of 
imatinib in metastatic GIST.12–16
A phase II study (B2222) initially reported in 2002, was the first multicenter trial designed 
specifically for advanced GIST to report that imatinib produced high response rates and 
lasting disease control.12,15 A follow-up report from this study in 2008 showed an overall 
median survival of 4.75 years for the 147 patients treated, with 41 patients (28%) remaining 
on the drug long-term. The presence of a KIT exon 11 mutation was associated with better 
survival. Estimated median survival was 5.25 years for patients with KIT exon 11 mutations 
and 3.67 years for those with KIT exon 9 mutations.15, A subsequent analysis of this trial 
found that 26 (17.7%) of the total 147 patients entered onto this study had remained on 
imatinib therapy, with a median follow-up time of 9.4 years. 17 The estimated 9-year OS rate 
for all patients was 35%. No data was provided about other therapeutic modalities, such as 
surgical resection of metastatic lesions or other post-progression systemic therapies, which 
might have contributed to these overall survival results.
A large SWOG-directed randomized phase III intergroup study, S0033, was designed and 
conducted to compare the outcome of patients with metastatic and/or unresectable 
(“surgically incurable”) GIST randomized to be treated with imatinib either at an initial dose 
of 400 mg or 800 mg daily. We previously reported a median OS of 4.58 years for 345 
patients treated with conventional dose imatinib, and 4.25 years for 349 patients treated on 
the high dose arm.14 Further long-term results of this study are now described in this paper, 
along with additional analyses of GIST tumors originally classified as “KIT/PDGFRA wild-
type” (KIT/PDGFRA WT) GIST, using next generation sequencing techniques. We also 
have correlated GIST genotypes with clinical outcomes during treatment, including a cohort 
of patients with SDH-deficient GIST.
METHODS
S0033 Study Population
The S0033 trial accrued patients from December 15, 2000 to September 1, 2001 from four 
cancer clinical trial cooperative groups (SWOG, CALGB, ECOG and NCIC-CTG) and from 
the UT MD Anderson Cancer Center. For the original analysis, approval by the Institutional 
Review Board of each participating institution was obtained, with written informed consent 
obtained from each participant. Data collection and analyses for the trial, registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00009906, were performed by the SWOG Statistical 
Center (Figure 1, Consort Figure).

 Patients were required to have biopsy proven metastatic and/or unresectable GIST of 
visceral or abdominal origin and with immunohistochemical demonstration of KIT 
expression documented by DAKO antibody staining. Complete details and results from the 
clinical study were previously reported.14 Tumor samples were sent to the Oregon Health & 
Science University where tumor genotyping was centrally assessed. Initial results of the KIT 
and PDGFRA genotyping and correlation with clinical outcomes were also previously 
published.18
Ten years after initiation of accrual on this study, investigators following patients last known 
to be alive were contacted to update follow-up. Patients known to have lived eight years or 
more were defined as long-term survivors. A two page data form was created to obtain 
fadditional information about these long-term survivors. Use of additional therapies after 
discontinuation of imatinib on this study was tabulated for these long-term survivors. The 
primary aim of this report was to correlate updated survival with clinical and molecular 
factors, as well as to enumerate and describe patterns of post-imatinib therapies of the long-
term survivors.
Statistical Analysis
The distribution of overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.19 
Proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the prognostic impact of the 
following variables on OS: age, sex, performance status (0, 1, 2, 3), time from initial 
diagnosis (in years), primary disease site (small bowel vs. other), maximum diameter of 
largest tumor, prior surgery, chemotherapy or RT, baseline WBC, hemoglobin, ANC, 
platelets, bilirubin, albumin and creatinine. For baseline WBC, HGB, ANC, PLT, bilirubin 
and creatinine, a log transformation was used in the regression models. Initially, each factor 
was assessed in a univariate fashion. Subsequently, multivariable models were performed 
using the factors found to be significant in the univariate models at the p=0.05 using a 
backward selection model. Associations between genotype and patient characteristics were 
tested using Chi-Square of Fisher’s exact test. P-values are unadjusted for multiple 
comparisons.
Targeted Exome Sequencing methods
These analyses were performed as previously described. 20 Additional details are included in 
our supplemental methods section.
RESULTS
Our initial clinical report found no statistical difference in OS, PFS or response between the 
treatment arms of imatinib 400 mg daily vs. 400 mg twice daily.14 Similarly, neither the 
B2222 phase II study reported by Blanke et al. nor the EORTC phase III study using an 
identical study design reported by Verweij et al. found an OS difference in outcomes 
between standard and higher doses of imatinib. However, Verweij et al. reported a PFS 
difference in the KIT exon 9 mutant subset in favor of the high-dose imatinib treatment 
arm.13, 16 In our study of 695 patients, 556 have died with a median OS of 52 months (95% 
CI: 48 to 61 months) (Figure 2A, Supplemental Table 1). The 10-year OS estimate is 23%

 (95% CI: 20% – 26%). The 10 year PFS estimate is 7% (95 CI: 6% - 10%), Figure 2B, 
Supplemental Table 1).
Of the 346 patients initially assigned to the 400 mg daily dose arm, there were 95 (27%) 
long-term survivors; this included 72 subjects that remained on low dose imatinib, and 23 
subjects who were crossed over to the 800 mg/day dose arm. A total of 130 patients crossed 
over during study conduct. Amongst the 349 patients initially assigned to the 800 mg daily 
dose arm, there were 94 (27%) long-term survivors.
The following prognostic factors were identified by univariate analysis as statistically 
significant with respect to OS: age, sex, performance status, prior chemotherapy, maximum 
tumor diameter, baseline platelets, hemoglobin, ANC, WBC, bilirubin and albumin. In the 
multivariate model, 551 of the 695 eligible patients had complete data for all baseline 
prognostic variables. Using backward selection, multivariate analyses showed that younger 
age, female gender, good performance status, smaller tumor diameters, lower WBC values 
and higher albumin values were associated with significantly improved OS. The p-values 
and hazard ratios are given below (Supplemental Table 2) for both univariate and 
multivariate analyses. The influence of these prognostic factors on the estimate of 10-year 
survival is listed in Supplemental Table 3. For example, the 10 year survival estimate for 
patients with a performance status of 0-1 at the time of treatment initiation was 26% (95% 
CI: 22-30%) compared with 7% (95% CI: 2-13%) for patients with a performance status of 
2-3 at the time of starting imatinib therapy.
Genotype results from our original analysis were available for 395 eligible patients, of which 
282 (71%) had KIT exon 11 mutations, 67 (17%) had KIT/PDGFRA wild-type (WT) 
genotype, 32 (8%) had KIT exon 9 mutations, and 14 (4%) had other KIT or PDGFRA 
mutations. A univariate analysis of OS by KIT exon 11 mutant, KIT exon 9 mutant, and 
KIT/PDGFRA WT genotypes was performed and revealed median survival times of 66, 38, 
and 40 months, respectively. When adjusted for all prognostically significant factors found 
in the analysis of eligible patients, patients with KIT exon 11 mutation had significantly 
longer OS than those with KIT/PDGFRA WT (p=0.004; Figure 3A, Supplemental Table 1). 
We also analyzed survival for different classes of KIT exon 11 mutations, including any type 
of KIT exon 11 deletion vs. insertion/duplication mutations vs. point mutations. No 
significant difference in OS was found for patients whose GIST harbored different subsets of 
KIT exon 11 mutations (Figure 3B, Supplemental Table 1).
When mutation status in long-term survivors was correlated with response [complete 
response (CR) + partial response (PR)], more responses were seen in the KIT exon 11 
mutant genotype group (n=92) than in the KIT/PDGFRA wild-type (WT) (n=21) or KIT 
exon 9 (n=4) groups: 64 patients (70%), 10 (48%) and 2 (50%), respectively. Median 
progression free survival (PFS) estimates by arm and mutation status are summarized in 
Supplemental Table 1. The median PFS for patients with KIT exon 11 mutations was 25 
months (95% C.I.: 21-28 months) compared to 17 months (95% C.I.: 9-25 months) for 
patients with KIT exon 9 mutations and 13 months (95% C.I.:8-18 months) for those with 
WT genotype (Supplemental Figure 1A). As with our OS analysis, no difference in PFS

 were found amongst patients whose GIST had different classes of KIT exon 11 mutations 
(Supplemental Figure 1B, Supplemental Table 1).
Post-Imatinib Progression Therapies during Survival Follow-up
Descriptions of additional therapies received after discontinuation of imatinib on this 
protocol were obtained for patients defined as long-term survivors (i.e., those known to have 
lived for at least eight years after enrollment on this trial). This additional follow-up was not 
planned as part of the initial study. Of the 189 long-term survivors, additional treatment 
information obtained from 142 patients indicates that 73 (51%) received other therapies. 
Fifty-four (38%) patients received additional systemic agents; sunitinib (41/142; 30%) and 
sorafenib (17/142; 12%) were the most commonly utilized additional therapies among the 
long-term survivors. Subsequent surgeries, radiofrequency ablation and radiation therapy 
were also reported in 29%, 7%, and 4%, respectively (Supplemental Table 4). Of the 395 
eligible patients with a known GIST genotype, 117 are long-term survivors (survival known 
to be at least eight years after randomization). Of these, 90 (81%) had information on 
additional non-protocol therapy.
Resequencing studies from a subset of cases previously identified as KIT/PDGFRA WT
At the time of study initiation, KIT mutations were the only known pathogenic abnormality 
associated with GIST. Following the completion of enrollment of patients to this study 
(September, 2001), a number of additional pathogenic events in GIST were described, 
including PDGFRA, RAS, and BRAF mutations, loss of SDHB protein expression due to 
mutation or epimutation, and the association of GIST with neurofibromatosis.21–24 KIT and 
PDGFRA mutations were the only analyses performed in our original report, due to 
limitations of testing that existed at that time. However, significant advances have improved 
our ability to sequence tumor DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tumors and to 
test for multiple genomic abnormalities in the same analysis. We identified 20 KIT/
PDGFRA WT cases for which there was sufficient residual DNA from our original studies 
for re-analysis using a targeted exome panel for GIST-associated pathogenic abnormalities. 
We identified the putative causative mutation in 17 of the 20 cases (85%) (Supplemental 
Table 5). The most commonly mutated pathway in our analysis was the succinate 
dehydrogenase complex (SDH), with mutation in 12/20 cases (60%; SDHA 9, SDHB 2, 
SDHC 1). We also identified two cases with NF1 loss as the presumed pathogenic mutation. 
Finally, we found three cases with KIT mutations that were missed in our original analysis 
(KIT exon 13 K642E, KIT exon 11 V559D, and KIT exon 9 K509I, 1 case each). Three 
cases (15%) of our original KIT/PDGFRA WT cohort did not contain an identifiable 
pathogenic mutation using our targeted panel. Due to the lack of residual unstained slides, 
we could not perform SDHB immunohistochemistry on these three cases. Therefore, we do 
not know whether these represent so called “quadruple WT GIST” or cases with SDH 
deficiency with alterations that could not be detected using our methods (e.g. 
epimutation).25,26
Our collection of 12 patients with SDH-deficient GIST represents the largest series of such 
patients treated uniformly with imatinib as part of a prospective clinical study. The 
demographics and baseline characteristics of these patients are detailed in Table 1, and

 compared to patients with KIT exon 11-mutant GIST. As expected, the patients with SDH-
mutant GIST were younger than the patients with KIT exon 11-mutant GIST treated 
patients, and 100% of the primary tumors arose outside the small bowel (presumably all 
gastric), compared with 66% non-small bowel for KIT exon 11-mutant tumors (p=0.02). The 
response rate of the SDH-mutant GIST patients was 8% (0% CR, 8% PR) versus 66% (6% 
CR, 59% PR, p=0.0001), for the patients with KIT exon 11-mutant tumors. Median OS was 
similar for both groups, although the confidence interval for the small SDH-deficient 
population was quite broad (116 months vs. 66 months, p= 0.38; Table 1, Figure 4A). 
Likewise, median PFS was not significantly different for patients with SDH-deficient tumors 
compared with KIT exon 11-mutant GIST (9 vs. 24 months, p= 0.07; adjusted for all 
prognostically significant variables; Table 1, Figure 4B).
DISCUSSION
As previously noted, prior to the clinical development of imatinib, metastatic GIST was a 
uniformly fatal disease with a rapidly progressive course and a median overall survival of 
less than two years. In the initial publication of the results from S0033, we reported on 
median survival and molecular biomarkers associated with response to imatinib. With a 
much longer follow up period, we now report that a significant subset of GIST patients 
experience long-term survival with front-line imatinib treatment of advanced and metastatic 
disease, with an estimated 8-year and 10-year survival of 31% and 23%, respectively. 
Notably, patients with advanced GIST treated with imatinib alone have experienced survival 
without report of progression for periods that approach, and even exceed, one decade. In the 
subset of patients who have survived more than 8 years since study entry, 51% received 
additional non-protocol therapy, with less than 40% receiving further systemic therapies 
beyond imatinib.
In this study, tumor bulk at the time of initiation of imatinib therapy significantly influences 
PFS and OS. This finding is in agreement with previous studies of imatinib therapy of 
advanced GIST.28,29 The influence of tumor bulk (CR vs PR vs SD) on PFS was also noted 
in the randomized imatinib discontinuation studies reported by the French Sarcoma Group.30 
Taken together, these observations raise the hypothesis that surgical tumor debulking may 
enhance the duration of imatinib response and disease control, at least in some patients. 
Several non-randomized, retrospective surgical series have suggested a benefit to surgical 
removal of metastatic lesions in imatinib-treated patients. This hypothesis was tested in a 
randomized phase III study, reported by Du et al.31 In their study, patients were randomized 
between 3 and 13 months after starting imatinib to eitherundergo surgery for residual disease 
with the goal of removing macroscopic disease as completely as possible or to remain on 
imatinib therapy without surgical intervention. The primary endpoint was 2-year PFS. 
Unfortunately, the study was closed early due to poor accrual with only 41 patients enrolled 
out of a planned 210. There was no advantage to surgery in terms of PFS (2-year PFS 88% 
for combined treatment vs. 58% for medical therapy only, p=0.09). However, the secondary 
endpoint of OS was significantly improved by combination treatment (median OS not 
reached for surgery vs. 49 months for imatinib-only treatment, p=0.024). These data suggest 
that surgical debulking may maximize the imatinib response for some patients, but it

 remains unclear how to optimally integrate surgery and imatinib treatment in the 
management of patients with metastatic GIST.
The resequencing studies reported here confirm the hypothesis that the vast majority of 
GISTs harbor identifiable pathogenic mutations. In our original report, we were able to 
identify the presumed causative mutation in 85% of GIST (KIT and PDGFRA analysis 
only). Using next-generation sequencing technologies, such as those described above, we 
now estimate that 97.5% of GIST can be assigned a pathogenic genotype. The remaining 
2.5% of GIST represent either GIST with SDH deficiency due to mutations outside of the 
four SDH subunits that affect SDH complex function or GIST with undiscovered pathogenic 
mechanisms (quadruple WT GIST). The objective response rate to imatinib treatment was 
significantly lower for SDH-mutant GIST when compared with KIT exon 11-mutant GIST 
(8% vs. 66%, Fisher’s exact p=0.001) based on post-hoc analyses. The single responding 
SDH-mutant GIST patient had a verified 62% decrease in tumor size which lasted for 4 
years before progression was noted. These results are consistent with a recent retrospective 
case series that reported 1 partial response out of 49 SDH-deficient GIST patients treated 
with imatinib. Our results also identify GIST with KIT exon 11 mutations or lacking KIT/
PDGFRA mutations (most of which are SDH-deficient) as having longer median OS when 
compared with KIT exon 9-mutant GIST. Given prior reports of cases of indolent behavior 
of untreated SDH-deficient metastatic GIST, it is unclear whether imatinib alters the natural 
history of most cases of KIT/PDGFRA WT GIST. Further studies are required to better 
define the role of imatinib therapy in the treatment of this type of GIST.
CONCLUSION
In summary, our results provide important data on the long-term outcomes of patients with 
metastatic GIST treated with imatinib. Further studies are needed to improve on these results 
using other strategies that might incorporate surgery, combination medical therapy 
(additional signaling pathway inhibitors or immune modulation agents), or some form of 
intermittent therapy. Alternatively, enhanced imaging and biomarker analysis to detect 
residual GIST cells in long-term responding patients may identify those patients who might 
benefit from less intense medical therapy.
