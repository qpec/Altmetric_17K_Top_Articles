ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate a “telephone first” approach, in which 
all patients wanting to see a general practitioner (GP) 
are asked to speak to a GP on the phone before being 
given an appointment for a face to face consultation.
DESIGN
Time series and cross sectional analysis of routine 
healthcare data, data from national surveys, and 
primary survey data.
PARTICIPANTS
147 general practices adopting the telephone first 
approach compared with a 10% random sample of 
other practices in England.
INTERVENTION
Management support for workload planning and 
introduction of the telephone first approach provided 
by two commercial companies.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Number of consultations, total time consulting 
(59 telephone first practices, no controls). Patient 
experience (GP Patient Survey, telephone first 
practices plus controls). Use and costs of secondary 
care (hospital episode statistics, telephone first 
practices plus controls). The main analysis was 
intention to treat, with sensitivity analyses restricted 
to practices thought to be closely following the 
companies’ protocols.
RESULTS
After the introduction of the telephone first approach, 
face to face consultations decreased considerably 
(adjusted change within practices −38%, 95% 
confidence interval −45% to −29%; P<0.001). An 
average practice experienced a 12-fold increase in 
telephone consultations (1204%, 633% to 2290%; 
P<0.001). The average duration of both telephone 
and face to face consultations decreased, but there 
was an overall increase of 8% in the mean time spent 
consulting by GPs, albeit with large uncertainty on 
this estimate (95% confidence interval −1% to 17%; 
P=0.088). These average workload figures mask wide 
variation between practices, with some practices 
experiencing a substantial reduction in workload 
and others a large increase. Compared with other 
English practices in the national GP Patient Survey, 
in practices using the telephone first approach there 
was a large (20.0 percentage points, 95% confidence 
interval 18.2 to 21.9; P<0.001) improvement in 
length of time to be seen. In contrast, other scores 
on the GP Patient Survey were slightly more negative. 
Introduction of the telephone first approach was 
followed by a small (2.0%) increase in hospital 
admissions (95% confidence interval 1% to 3%; 
P=0.006), no initial change in emergency department 
attendance, but a small (2% per year) decrease in 
the subsequent rate of rise of emergency department 
attendance (1% to 3%; P=0.005). There was a small 
net increase in secondary care costs.
CONCLUSIONS
The telephone first approach shows that many 
problems in general practice can be dealt with over 
the phone. The approach does not suit all patients or 
practices and is not a panacea for meeting demand. 
There was no evidence to support claims that the 
approach would, on average, save costs or reduce use 
of secondary care.
Introduction
Many UK general practices are struggling with rising 
demand from patients, more work being transferred 
from secondary to primary care, and increasing 
difficulty in recruiting general practitioners.1 2 
Countries other than the UK are also facing issues of 
matching workforce supply to increasing demand for 
primary care, including the US3 4 and Australia.5 The 
US Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) has 
suggested a wide range of strategies to try to match 
capacity with demand, including more use of nurses, 
email consultations, pharmacy clinics, telephone 
consulting, 
and 
carefully 
planned 
scheduling 
to balance supply with periods of high and low 
demand.6 7
One response that has been adopted by around 150 
general practices in England is a “telephone first” 
approach, a practice-wide change in which every 
patient asking to see a GP is initially phoned back by

a GP on the same day, so that patients are unable to 
see a GP unless they have spoken to a doctor on the 
phone first. At the end of this phone call the GP and 
the patient decide whether the problem needs a face to 
face consultation (usually on the same day) or whether 
it has been satisfactorily resolved on the phone. Two 
commercial companies (advertised as Doctor First and 
GP Access)8 9 provide similar types of management 
support for practices adopting the new approach, with 
claims that the approach dramatically reduces the 
need for face to face consultation, reduces workload 
stress for GPs and practice staff, increases continuity 
of care, reduces attendance at emergency departments 
and emergency hospital admission, and increases 
patient satisfaction. Both companies advocate a GP led 
approach in which GPs (rather than nurses) telephone 
patients to determine if the problem can be resolved 
satisfactorily on the phone.
Some of these claims are repeated in NHS England 
literature, including the assertion that practices using 
the approach have a 20% lower use of emergency 
departments and that “the model has shown cost 
savings of about £100 000 (€111 000, $133 000) per 
practice through prevention of avoidable attendance 
and admissions to hospital.”10 Several clinical 
commissioning groups have subsequently paid for 
the management support required for the approach to 
be adopted by practices in their area. In part because 
claims of benefit for the telephone first approach 
are based solely on data from the two commercial 
companies, the National Institute for Health Research 
commissioned this independent service evaluation. 
The evaluation determined the impact for practices 
using the telephone first approach supported by the 
two commercial companies on practice workload, 
satisfaction among patients and staff, continuity of 
care, emergency department attendance, emergency 
hospital admission, and the associated costs of the 
approach.
Methods
We carried out patient surveys in practices using 
the telephone first approach and analysed trends in 
consultations in those practices using appointment 
systems data. We also compared practices using 
the telephone first approach with control practices 
in England using data on patient experience from 
the national GP Patient Survey and data on use of 
secondary care from hospital episode statistics. Subject 
to exclusions, we used the same control practices in all 
analyses. Full details of the analytical methods used 
are in appendix 1.
Use of primary care
One commercial provider (GP Access) provided data 
from routine practice records of 59 practices, which 
enabled us to examine changes in number and type of 
appointment, time between booking an appointment 
and the appointment taking place, length of 
consultation (judged from the time the patient record 
was opened until it was closed), and continuity of 
care (quantified as the proportion of consultations 
that were with the GP most commonly seen in that 
month). We included in the analysis GP appointments 
only on weekdays (full details of inclusion criteria 
are given in table A in appendix 1). We used mixed 
effects regression analysis to investigate step changes 
within a practice associated with the introduction of 
the telephone first approach and changes in trends 
relative to the start date. Regression coefficients for 
step changes and trends were used to quantify the 
effect of the intervention. When we used Poisson 
regression (for numbers of appointments) or log 
transformed data (total time spent consulting), we 
exponentiated regression coefficients to give effects 
in terms of ratios. Wald tests of regression coefficients 
were used throughout. No control data were available 
for this before and after analysis.
As the intervention started at different times in each 
practice, we identified the date when each practice 
started using the new system; when data were available 
over a period of time we analysed the data relative to 
this point (the start date).
Use of secondary care
We obtained hospital episode statistics data from NHS 
Digital for April 2008 to March 2016. For each practice 
operating the telephone first approach, we calculated 
rates of attendance at emergency departments, 
emergency 
admission, 
elective 
admission, 
and 
outpatient attendance for 12 months before and 
after the date when the telephone first approach was 
introduced. To allow for external factors, we compared 
data from all practices known to be operating the 
telephone first approach (n=145, both commercial 
providers) with data from a random 10% sample of 
practices in England (n=829). We used a mixed effects 
Poisson regression to identify step changes within a 
practice around the start date and changes in trends 
relative to the start date. Regression coefficients have 
been exponentiated to give effects in terms of rate 
ratios. Wald tests of regression coefficients are used 
throughout.
Patient surveys
We analysed responses to the national GP Patient 
Survey from July 2011 to April 2016, comparing 
all practices known to be using the telephone first 
approach (n=146, both commercial providers) with 
a random 10% sample of other practices in England 
(n=842). Survey responses were available from 29 472 
patients in telephone first practices during this period. 
We linearly rescaled responses to patient experience 
items to give a scale from 0 to 100, as in previous 
work,11 12 to facilitate comparison between items. 
We used mixed effects linear regression analysis to 
investigate step changes within a practice associated 
with adoption of the telephone first approach and 
changes in trends relative to the start date compared 
with background trends seen in control practices. 
Finally, we performed a supplementary analysis 
to investigate if the effect of the intervention was

differential between those in or not in employment by 
including a main effect for working status (based on GP 
Patient Survey responses) and an interaction between 
working status and the intervention variable.
We also sent a questionnaire to 80-100 patients 
who had telephone contact with a GP in each of 
20 practices using the telephone first approach 
(appendix 2). These were practices (out of 101 that 
had been operating the telephone first approach for at 
least six months at the time) that agreed to take part in 
the patient survey. If there were fewer than 80 patient 
contacts in the day that was sampled, we extracted 
data on all patients who had spoken to a GP in the two 
previous days. If there were more than 100 patients 
(either in a single day or across multiple days needed 
to get to a sample size of at least 80), we took a random 
sample of 100 patients. We posted the survey to adult 
patients and to the parents of patients aged under 13 
with a letter from the practice inviting them to respond 
(patients aged 13-17 were excluded for reasons of 
patient confidentiality). A reminder was posted to 
non-responders two weeks after the original mailing. 
To reduce non-response bias we weighted the results 
based on the age and sex of the patients who were sent 
a survey. The survey asked about the experience of 
the telephone first approach and whether the patient 
preferred it to the previous system, as well as basic 
demographic information.
Economic analysis
In the economic analysis, we estimated primary care 
costs of introducing the telephone first approach and 
changes to costs of secondary care and prescribed 
medicines in practices known to be using the telephone 
first approach compared with a 10% random sample 
of English practices (829). We analysed data before 
and after the intervention start date and against pre-
intervention trends. Full details of the methods used in 
the economic analysis are given in appendix 1.
Intention to treat analysis
For use of primary and secondary care and national 
GP Patient Survey data, we conducted the main 
analyses on an intention to treat basis, including all 
146 practices identified by the commercial companies, 
even when the companies informed us that the 
practices had adopted a hybrid form of triage or were 
no longer running the system. This was done to avoid 
selection bias that would occur if we included only 
successful practices that continued with the system in 
the recommended form. We also asked the commercial 
companies which of the practices they believed were 
operating the new approach fully or largely consistent 
with their protocols, and, on the basis of their replies, we 
performed per protocol sensitivity analyses restricted 
to this subset of practices. The results presented in 
the paper are those of the intention to treat analysis, 
with the sensitivity per protocol analyses, which gave 
broadly similar results, in appendix 3.
We also carried out a survey of practice managers, 
which is reported in appendix 4.
Patient involvement
A study steering group was established, which included 
four patients. The steering group met on three occasions 
and provided input into the design and conduct of the 
study including advice on patient materials produced 
during the study. Patients were not involved in 
recruiting practices or patients to the study (patients 
surveyed were those who had recently had a telephone 
consultation in one of the intervention practices). As 
we do not have contact details of these patients are 
unable to share results with them (questionnaires were 
sent by the practices). Patient representatives from 
the steering group attended a learning event at which 
practices shared their experiences of the telephone 
first approach and commented on our initial findings. 
Patients from practices using the system also attended 
this event and contributed to discussions.
Results
Table 1 shows the characteristics of practices using the 
telephone first approach.
Use of primary care
There was an overall increase in the number of 
consultations after the introduction of the telephone 
first approach from a mean of 16.5 (SD 6.3) to 21.8 
(SD 8.1) consultations/day/1000 patients. The change 
was made up of a substantial reduction in face to face 
consultations, which reduced from a mean of 13.0 
(SD 4.5) to 9.3 (SD 5.5), and an increase in telephone 
consultations from a mean of 3.0 (SD 4.5) to 12.2

(SD 7.5) telephone consultations/day/1000 patients. 
Figures 1 and 2 show these results.
These changes were reflected in the regression 
results within practices (table 2), which showed a 
28% step increase in total consultations and a further 
increase over the next year. After the introduction of 
the telephone first approach, face to face consultations 
decreased considerably (adjusted change within 
practices −38%, 95% confidence interval −45% to 
−29%; P<0.001). An average practice experienced a 
12-fold increase in telephone consultations (1204%, 
633% to 2290%; P<0.001). These average workload 
figures mask wide variation between practices, with 
some practices experiencing a substantial reduction 
in workload and others a large increase. Disparities 
between the regression results and crude average 
change reflect the fact that regression results relate 
to changes within practices, and when there is an 
association between pre-intervention level and change, 
the average of changes might not reflect the overall 
difference. This is particularly noticeable for telephone 
consultations, where the increase is likely to be smaller 
for those already performing large number of telephone 
consultations. Including changes in the number and 
duration of face to face and telephone consultations, 
we estimated an overall increase of 8% in the mean 
time spent consulting by GPs, although with large 
uncertainty on this estimate (95% confidence interval 
−1% to 17%; P<0.09). There was a small increase 
in continuity of care index after the introduction of 
the new system, though with some decline over the 
following years. Figures illustrating these changes 
(superposed epoch analyses similar to figures 1 and 
2, which show changes for each individual practice 
as well as averages) and further details of regression 
results are shown in appendix 3. Per protocol analyses 
of the subset of practices operating the telephone 
first approach in line with the companies’ protocols 
throughout showed broadly similar results and are also 
shown in appendix 3. It is important to note that all the 
average figures mask wide variation between practices, 
as indicated by the model random effects. This ranged, 
for example, from practices experiencing a doubling 
in the total number of consultations to others in which 
there was overall net reduction in workload, with 
face to face consultations reduced by over two thirds 
(table 2).
Patient surveys
Table 3 compares the responses to the national GP 
Patient Survey from practices using the telephone 
first approach and other practices in England. There 
was a large and immediate improvement in patients’ 
rating of time to be seen or spoken to (increase of 20 
points on a 0-100 point scale) compared with national 
trends. All other differences were small in comparison 
and included small negative effects on scores for 
communication with the GP, ability to see the patient’s 
preferred GP, and willingness to recommend the 
surgery to others. The per protocol analysis carried 
out for the subset of practices operating the telephone 
first approach in line with the companies’ protocols 
throughout showed similar results (appendix 3). As 
with the use of primary care data, these average figures 
mask large variation between practices (as evidenced 
by random effects) except in the rating of time to be seen 
or spoken to, when all practices showed improvement. 
The supplementary analysis found no evidence that 
the effect of the intervention was differential between 
those patients in or not in work (P>0.1 for all, results 
not shown).
We sent the patient questionnaire we developed 
(appendix 2) to 1873 patients from 20 practices 
using the telephone first approach. We received 837 
responses, a 44.7% response rate. Table 4 shows 
the results. Nearly two thirds of patients (weighted 
percentage 64.9%) reported being called back within 
an hour. In half of the calls (weighted percentage 
50.6%) the patient was asked to come into the surgery 
for a face to face consultation with a GP or nurse. Advice 
only was given in 17.3% of phone calls (weighted 
percentage 16.8%), and 21.9% of phone calls resulted 
in a prescription being given (weighted percentage 
23.9%). In response to the question “Did you find the 
telephone appointment more or less convenient than 
just attending a face to face appointment, without 
being able to talk to the doctor on the phone first?” 
over half said that the telephone first approach was

more convenient with similar percentages reporting 
that it was less convenient or made no difference. Just 
under a quarter reported that it was more difficult to 
communicate with the GP on the phone, the main 
reasons being given that it was difficult to explain the 
problem or that the doctor could not see the problem, 
but nearly two thirds found it made no difference, and 
11.7% found it easier to communicate on the phone. 
Respondents were fairly equally divided over whether 
they preferred the new system, would prefer to return 
the old system, or didn’t mind.
To get agreement from 20 practices to take part in 
this survey, we had to approach all 101 practices that 
had been operating the telephone first approach for at 
least six months at the time of recruitment. Because 
these might be practices that were operating the new 
system more successfully, we compared practices that 
agreed and declined to take part in our survey using 
national GP Patient Survey data, and confirmed that 
patient experience was more positive in practices 
that agreed to take part in our survey (based on GP 
Patient Survey data, 86% of patients rated the overall 
experience of making an appointment as good or 
very good in practices that agreed to take part in the 
survey compared with 80% in practices that declined). 
The results of our survey (but not the comparison 
with the national GP Patient Survey) might therefore 
be a positively biased representation of patients’ 
experiences.
Patients had the opportunity to provide free text 
comments at the end of the questionnaire. Box 1 
provides examples of quotations, which illustrate the 
wide range of views expressed about the new approach. 
These mirror the range of strongly held positive and 
negative views that were also found in qualitative 
interviews with patients (not reported in this paper).

Use of secondary care
Table 5 shows the changes in use of secondary 
care within practices. When practices changed to 
the telephone first approach, there was no change 
in attendance at emergency departments and a 
small (2%) increase in emergency admissions, an 
increase that was greater (4%) for admissions for 
ambulatory care sensitive conditions (conditions for 
which admissions could, in principle, be avoided by 
good primary care). In the year after the change to 
the new system, there were small (2%) reductions 
in the previous rate of increase in emergency 
department attendance and outpatient attendance, 
compared with national trends, but an acceleration 
in the previous rate of increase for admissions for 
ambulatory care sensitive conditions. Heterogeneity 
identified with a random effect shows that these 
figures mask considerable differences between 
individual practices, some of which had large 
increases in emergency department attendances, 
with others showing large decreases. The per protocol 
analysis carried out for the subset of practices 
operating the telephone first approach in line with 
the companies’ protocols throughout showed similar 
results (appendix 3).
Economic analysis
Eighteen practices provided detailed information 
on costs of adopting the telephone first approach. 
The median amount paid to commercial companies 
for supporting the change was £10 810 per practice 
(range £7200 to £13 803). In some cases this had 
been paid by the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) 
rather than by the practice itself. Several practices 
installed additional phone lines and/or bought new 
mobile phones. Some practices reported substantial 
initial increases in the costs of calls, though this 
could have been a short term issue as more suitable 
contracts were negotiated. No practices purchased 
new computer hardware or software as existing 
systems were able to implement the new approach. 
Six practices incurred costs related to informing 
patients about the new system, including updating 
the practice website, newspaper advertisements, and 
leaflets. When these were done in house this did not 
incur any additional cost other than the opportunity 
cost of administrator time. One practice mailed all 
their patients with information about the new system

Box 1: Examples of positive and negative views about the telephone first approach from free text comments included in the patient survey
Examples of positive comments
I think to be able to pick up a phone and speak to your GP, who will either see you, leave a prescription, or advise you to see a nurse, is excellent 
(practice 104)
On the rare occasions it’s been an emergency, the ring back has been almost immediate—I cannot fault the system (practice 105)
It saves wasting the time of the GP if the matter can speedily be dealt with over the phone (practice 116)
Excellent service. It’s much easier to speak to doctor and the few times I’ve phoned in, my problem has been sorted out over the phone which 
saves time for both parties (practice 117)
With this system, if it’s necessary, you usually get to see the doctor the same day—it saves time for serious cases to see the doctor. Much better 
than the old system (practice 108)
Examples of negative comments
Speaking to the doctor isn’t the problem: it’s getting through on the phone that’s the difficulty (practice 111)
I think this system is stupid. Once I waited six hours for a call back—I could have been dead (practice 110)
The call back system is truly awful—I cannot plan my day as I work from site to site over long distances (practice 103)
If you work in a job where you can’t take phone calls it can be almost impossible to get a call back from a doctor (practice 121)
The only difficulty for me is that it’s sometimes difficult to explain more intimate matters to a GP over the phone—I work in an office with other 
people and it can be difficult to find a quiet confidential place to talk (practice 116)

at a cost of £7600 (covered by the CCG). Five practices 
employed additional staff after the change, though 
they said it was hard to attribute this to the adoption of 
the telephone first approach. Two practices reported 
that they had recruited staff because of an increased 
list size, which they attributed to patients switching 
from other practices because of easier access to GPs 
in their practices. One of the 18 practices interviewed 
appointed an additional full time nurse because of 
a perceived increase in consultations, though they 
subsequently decided that the additional nurse 
was excess to requirements. The introduction of the 
telephone first approach was not associated with 
differences in cost or numbers of prescriptions issued 
except for some minor changes which we judged 
unlikely to be of clinical importance (see details in 
tables M and N in appendix 3).
Table 6 shows the change in costs of use of secondary 
care. When we combined the step change at the 
introduction of the telephone first approach with the 
change in underlying trend over the subsequent year, 
we found small non-significant reductions in costs for 
emergency department and outpatient attendance and 
a significant increase in costs of admissions, leading 
to an estimated overall increase in secondary care 
costs of £11 766 per 10 000 patients in the first year 
after the change to the new approach (aggregating 
emergency department and outpatient attendance 
(−£577, −£2762) and admissions coded as emergency 
or elective (+£7993, +£7112)).
discussion
Our study shows that adoption of the telephone first 
approach in general practice had a major effect on 
patterns of consultation, with large increases in 
phone consultations and decreases in face to face 
consultations. Our patient survey suggests that up 
to half of patients’ problems could be dealt with on 
the phone, which could offer potential for practices 
struggling with demand for face to face consultations. 
The telephone first approach, however, is not a 
panacea for management of demand and is on average 
associated with increased overall GP workload. 
Consistent with previous work on telephone triage,14 
there was an average increase in overall time spent 
consulting, though our uncertainty on this estimate is 
large. We also note wide variation between practices 
ranging from large reductions in GP workload to large 
increases. The introduction of the telephone first 
approach is associated with dramatic improvements 
in patients’ perception of the time to be seen or 
spoken to but a quarter of patients found it more 
difficult to communicate with their GP on the phone. 
Nevertheless, more than half of patients surveyed said 
they preferred the telephone first approach to their 
practice’s previous arrangement.
We found no evidence that the approach substantially 
reduced overall attendance at emergency departments 
or emergency hospital admissions and some evidence 
that overall costs of secondary care increased slightly. 
While we found evidence here and in qualitative results

not reported in this paper that some working patients 
disliked the approach (for example, if they could not 
take calls at work), there was no net difference in 
the survey responses of working and non-working 
patients to new approach. This probably indicates that 
other working patients found it more convenient (for 
example, because they no longer needed to take time 
off work for a consultation with their GP). Although 
we found evidence of wide variation in the impact of 
the telephone first approach in different practices, 
we were not able to fully explain why, for some 
practices, the approach had transformed their ability 
to cope with patient demand whereas for others the 
approach seemed to open floodgates of demand that 
at times overwhelmed the practice. Supported by 
informal observations in practices not reported here, 
our impression is that the approach worked better in 
highly organised data driven practices that already 
had a handle on demand and was less likely to prove 
successful in practices where the ability to cope 
with demand was already out of control. It was also 
important that practices had sufficient telephone lines 
to meet periods of high demand. The management 
support provided by the two commercial companies 
enabled practices to have a detailed understanding 
of patterns of demand during the week so that they 
could anticipate periods of high demand and allocate 
resources appropriately, though this seemed to have 
been implemented more successfully in some practices 
than others. It was also clear that, though some 
practices had organised the new system to improve 
continuity of care, in others patients found it more 
difficult to see or speak to the doctor of their choice.
Strengths and limitations of this study
We used a combination of quantitative methods, when 
possible comparing the telephone first approach with 
background trends in control practices in England. 
Strengths of the study include the multi-method 
approach and the inclusion of all practices that 
had been using the telephone first approach for at 
least six months at the start of the study. Among the 
limitations is the likelihood that practices operating 
the telephone first approach successfully were more 
likely to participate in our patient survey and surveys 
with practice managers, and we found that practices 
that participated in our survey had, on average, 
better national patient survey scores than those that 
were operating the telephone first approach but 
did not participate. It is possible that the telephone 
first approach also added to nursing workload in 
the practices, though we did not measure this. Our 
economic analysis, however, provided no evidence 
that practices needed to increase nurse staffing levels 
as a result of introducing the new system, and in the 
ESTEEM study15 increases in nursing workload were 
much greater when nurses, rather than GPs, took 
triage calls (as in this study). We did not include 
home visits in the analysis as the small numbers 
made analyses difficult. Some hard to reach groups 
of patients, including those with poor English, might 
also have been under-represented in the patient survey 
responses, and these might be patients who had 
particular problems with the telephone first approach. 
In addition, we relied on workload data from practice 
records that were not originally collected for research 
purposes. In particular, there was a substantial amount 
of missing data for consultation length, for which we 
used imputation when calculating the total time spent 
consulting, and the corresponding results should 
be treated with caution. The study also provides no 
information on health outcomes.
Comparison with other studies
While most UK practices offer some facility for telephone 
consultations,16 previous research has focused on 
a triage approach where, for example, requests for 
on the day consultations or home visits are triaged 
on the phone by a doctor or nurse. While the impact 
of these depends on the particular approach being 
adopted,17 and while triage might be an appropriate 
way of prioritising work within a general practice, it 
has not consistently been associated with reductions 
in practice workload.18 19 For example, a large 
randomised trial of GP and nurse led triage for patients 
seeking same day consultations (ESTEEM) found that 
it was associated with an increase in the number of 
primary care contacts over the subsequent 28 days and 
no evidence of reduction in NHS costs.15 20 Likewise, 
in the US, provision of telephone access for patients 
increases the availability of medical advice for patients 
but does not decrease cost, with most telephone 
consultations in “telehealth” services representing 
new use.21 While the telephone first approach that 
we evaluated offers a more radical approach to 
management of demand, the overall conclusion about 
effect on workload is similar. Concerns have also been 
expressed that increased use of telephone consulting 
could compromise patient safety.22 Although we have 
not directly examined patient safety in this paper, staff 
and patients more often expressed a view that safety 
was improved by being able to deal with patients’ 
problems without long waits for appointments.
Conclusions
For clinicians, this study provides clear evidence that 
a considerable part of patient workload can be dealt 
with through phone consultations. This might increase 
the practice’s control over day to day workload but 
does not necessarily decrease the need for GP time and 
could increase it. We found no evidence to support 
claims reproduced in NHS England literature5 that the 
approach would be substantially cost saving or reduce 
use of secondary care.
The pure form of the telephone first approach 
advocated by the commercial companies requires 
that all face to face consultations are preceded by a 
phone call (that is, no advance booking is allowed). 
Though some practices adopted this approach, many 
had modified the system to allow a degree of advance 
booking. Unanswered questions remain about the 
balance between meeting the needs of patients for

different types of appointment and a system that 
allows practices to keep tight control on patients’ 
requests for face to face consultations. Consistent 
with our qualitative work (not reported here), patients 
expressed strong views for and against the new system, 
and better understanding is needed of the requirements 
of practices that make the difference between the 
approach becoming described as excellent or awful.
