Abstract
Purpose: While immune checkpoint inhibitors are disrupting
the management of patients with cancer, anecdotal occurrences of
rapid progression (i.e., hyperprogressive disease or HPD) under
these agents have been described, suggesting potentially delete-
rious effects of these drugs. The prevalence, the natural history,
and the predictive factors of HPD in patients with cancer treated
by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 remain unknown.
Experimental Design: Medical records from all patients (N ¼
218) prospectively treated in Gustave Roussy by anti-PD-1/PD-L1
within phase I clinical trials were analyzed. The tumor growth rate
(TGR) prior ("REFERENCE"; REF) and upon ("EXPERIMENTAL";
EXP) anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy was compared to identify patients
with accelerated tumor growth. Associations between TGR, clinico-
pathologic characteristics, and overall survival (OS) were computed.
Results: HPD was defined as a RECIST progression at the first
evaluation and as a �2-fold increase of the TGR between the REF
and the EXP periods. Of 131 evaluable patients, 12 patients (9%)
were considered as having HPD. HPD was not associated with
higher tumor burden at baseline, nor with any specific tumor type.
At progression, patients with HPD had a lower rate of new lesions
than patients with disease progression without HPD (P < 0.05).
HPD is associated with a higher age (P < 0.05) and a worse
outcome (overall survival). Interestingly, REF TGR (before treat-
ment) was inversely correlated with response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1
(P < 0.05) therapy.
Conclusions: A novel aggressive pattern of hyperprogression
exists in a fraction of patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1. This
observation raises some concerns about treating elderly patients
(>65 years old) with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy and suggests
further study of this phenomenon. Clin Cancer Res; 23(8); 1920–8.

Introduction
Immune checkpoint blocking antibodies are profoundly
changing the management of patients with cancer. At the
forefront of this novel anticancer agent class, anti-PD-1/PD-
L1 antibodies can exhibit a significant activity by restoring
an efficient antitumor T-cell response. As a result, these
agents are now approved in various tumor types such as
melanoma, squamous, and nonsquamous non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), bladder cancer, and
Hodgkin lymphomas (1–7). Interestingly, these new immu-
notherapies also result in novel tumor response patterns such
as delayed tumor responses or pseudoprogressions (8, 9). As
experience grows with these therapeutics, anecdotal reports
are relating rapid disease progressions, which could suggest
that immune checkpoint blockade may have a deleterious
effect by accelerating the disease in a subset of patients (Fig.
1; refs. 10, 11).
Briefly, the tumor growth rate (TGR) estimates the increase in
tumor volume over time. It incorporates the time between imag-
ing examinations, allowing for a quantitative and dynamic eval-
uation of the tumor burden along the treatment sequence. Inter-
estingly, this method uses each patient as his/her own control.
This simple but powerful method has already been successfully
used to evaluate the activity of multiple agents and tumor types
and it can be instrumental to identify the specific therapeutic effect
of anticancer agents regardless of the disease course of each patient
(12–15).
To explore the prevalence, the natural history, and the predic-
tive factors of a potential hyperprogressive disease (HPD) phe-
nomenon in patients with cancer treated by anti-PD-1/PD-L1, we

 sought to compare TGRs of tumors during REFERENCE (i.e., prior
to treatment onset; REF) and EXPERIMENTAL (i.e., between
baseline and the first tumor evaluation; EXP) treatment periods.
Materials and Methods
Patients
The medical records of all consecutive patients (n ¼ 218)
prospectively enrolled and treated in phase I clinical trials treated
with monotherapy by anti-PD-1 or an anti-PD-L1 at Gustave
Roussy between December 2011 and January 2014 were analyzed.
All the CT scans were independently reviewed by 2 senior
radiologists.
Definition of TGR
Tumor size (D) was defined as the sum of the longest
diameters of the target lesions as per the Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria (16, 17). Let t be
the time expressed in months at the tumor evaluation. Assum-
ing the tumor growth follows an exponential law, Vt, the tumor
volume at time t, is equal to Vt ¼ V0 exp(TG.t), where V0 is the
volume at baseline and TG is the growth rate. We approximated
the tumor volume (V) by V ¼ 4 p R3/3, where R, the radius of
the sphere is equal to D/2. Consecutively, TG is equal to TG ¼ 3
Log(Dt/D0)/t. To report the TGR results in a clinically mean-
ingful way, we expressed TGR as a percentage increase in tumor
volume during 1 month using the following transformation:
TGR ¼ 100 [exp(TG) �1], where exp(TG) represents the expo-
nential of TG.
Translational Relevance
Rapid progressions have been anecdotally reported in
patients with cancer treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs. A
total of 131 patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in phase I
clinical trials at Gustave Roussy were evaluable for their tumor
growth rate (TGR) before treatment ("REFERENCE period";
REF) and upon treatment ("EXPERIMENTAL period"; EXP).
Patients with hyperprogressive disease (HPD) were defined as
patients with disease progression by RECIST criteria with a �2-
fold increase in the TGR EXP versus REF. Thus, we identified 12
patients (9%) with an HPD pattern. HPD was not associated
with advanced disease and was equally observed with PD-1/
PD-L1 blockers and was observed across tumor types. Impor-
tantly, HPD was associated with an older age and with worse
overall survival. Overall, this suggests that HPD is a new
pattern of progression observed in a fraction of patients and
argues potentially caution when using anti-PD-1/PD-L1
monotherapy in patients older than 65 years.

 We calculated the TGR across clinically relevant treatment
periods: (i) TGR REF assessed during the wash-out period (off-
therapy) before the introduction of the experimental drug and (ii)
TGR EXP assessed during the first cycle of treatment (i.e., between
the drug introduction and the first evaluation, on-therapy). To
compute the TGR REF, additional imaging exploring the wash-out
period (off-therapy) immediately before the introduction were
included when available. As per the RECIST system, patients with
nonmeasurable disease only at baseline could not be assessed by
TGR. For patients who had disease progression with new lesions,
the TGR was computed on the target lesions only (new lesions
were not included in the RECIST sum).
Statistical analysis
We performed pairwise comparisons to test the variation of
TGR along the treatment sequence using Wilcoxon signed-rank
tests. The tumor progression was assessed using RECIST 1.1 at the
first treatment evaluation after the onset of the experimental drug
(16, 17). According to RECIST 1.1, patients' tumor responses were
classified into the following classes: complete response (CR),
partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease
(PD). Landmark survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan–
Meier method (18). As per the different protocols, most patients
had to be evaluated after 6 to 8 weeks of drug exposure. Conse-
quently, we set the landmark point at 2 months. Overall survival
(OS) was determined as the time between the landmark point and
the death from any cause. The comparisons between categorical
variables were performed using the log-rank test. HRs were
estimated from Cox proportional hazard models and were adjust-
ed to the standard clinicopathologic prognostic factors, assessed
by the Royal Marsden prognostic score (RMH), as previously
described (19). All the tests were 2-sided and significance was
assumed if P < 0.05. All the analyses were carried out using the R
statistical software (R version 3.3.0, http://www.R-project.org/.),
the `survival' R package (version 2.37.4, published by T. Ther-
neau), and controlled by a senior statistician.
Results
Description of the cohort
We analyzed a total of 218 patients treated with anti-PD-1 or
anti-PD-L1 monotherapy and with a baseline CT scan. As
illustrated in the flowchart (Fig. 2), a total of 18 (8%) and 5
(2%) patients stopped because of clinical progression and of
toxicity before the first tumor evaluation, respectively. Of these
patients, 27 patients did not have a previous CT scan available
and 2 had no tumor burden measurable by RECIST at the
imaging before baseline. Thus, data on 166 patients (76%)
could be explored for TGR during both the REF periods (i.e.,
most often, between the imaging exam indicating prior pro-
gression and baseline) and the EXP periods. As tumor kinetics
cannot be representative if measured within a too short or too
long period, we excluded 35 patients because the reference
period lasted less than 2 weeks or was greater than 3 months.
Thereby, 131 patients (60%) with a clinically meaningful TGR
were evaluable in our analysis (Fig. 2). Patient characteristics
are described in Tables 1 and 2. The distribution of the EXP and
the REF period are shown in Fig. 3A.
By RECIST, a total of 49 (37%) 66 (50%) 15 (12%), and 1 (1%)
patients exhibited PD, SD, PR, or CR, respectively. The distribu-
tion of TGR across the 2 periods is as follows: REF period: median
49.7 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0–441.7] and EXP period:
median 3.7 (95% CI, �61.9–147.8).
Exploring the HPD phenotype in patients using the variation of
TGR between the REF and the EXP periods
To investigate whether anecdotal cases of accelerated tumor
growth observed by oncologists (Fig. 1) were related to actual
increase in the tumor kinetics, we computed the variation of
TGR between the REF and the EXP periods across all patients.
An increase in the TGR between the REF and the EXP periods
was observed in a total of 34 patients (26%; Fig. 3A and B),

 suggesting an absence of therapeutic effect in this subgroup.
However, among patients with increase in tumor growth, there
were some patients with a marked increase in tumor growth
(Fig. 3A and B). To identify such a population, we computed
the number of patients satisfying the condition: TGR EXP > TGR
REF � t with t being an integer threshold (from 1 to 5; Fig. 3C).

 We observed a plateau in the number of patients satisfying this
condition when t > 2, revealing a specific subset of patients with
aggressive disease. Consecutively, we defined as having HPD
those patients who were defined as having disease progression
by RECIST at the first evaluation and who presented a �2-fold
increase in the TGR EXP compared with the REF period.
Overall, we identified 12 patients with HPD, representing
9% of the evaluable patients and 24% of patients with disease
progression by RECIST at the first evaluation (Fig. 3D and E). As
illustrated by Supplementary Fig. S1A, the median of the TGR
EXP/TGR REF ratio in patients with HPD is 20.7-fold (range,
2.0–141.3). Interestingly, among patients with PD by RECIST at
the first evaluation, patients with HPD exhibited a lower rate of
new lesions than patients with non-HPD progression (33% vs.
84%, P ¼ 0.0019; Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Association between HPD and anatomoclinical variables
We first assumed that advanced disease and poor performance
status were associated with HPD. However, we found no associ-
ation between HPD and tumor burden at baseline (estimated
by the RECIST sum; P ¼ 0.64; Supplementary Fig. S1C), the
number of metastatic sites (P ¼ 0.76), or the Royal Marsden
Hospital (RMH) prognostic score (P ¼ 0.43; Supplementary
Fig. S1D; Tables 1 and 2).
Furthermore, we examined the potential influence of previous
therapies. Again, we did not observe any association between
HPD status and the number of previous lines (P ¼ 0.69), the
occurrence of corticosteroids at baseline (P ¼ 0.16), or the type of
previous treatment line (conventional chemotherapy, P ¼ 0.75;
targeted therapy, P ¼ 0.55; radiotherapy, P ¼ 0.77; immunother-
apy, P ¼ 0.39).
Although anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agents might have a different
mechanism of action (e.g., PD-L2 and B7-1 partners) and there-
fore potentially different mechanisms of escape, we did not find
any differences in the rate of HPD between these 2 classes (P ¼ 1).
Moreover, we were able to access to the PD-L1 tumor status for 35
patients (27%) and did not find any difference (P ¼ 0.24) between
HPD and other patients.
Interestingly, HPD status was observed across many tumor
types and was therefore independent of histology (P ¼ 0.29). In
addition, there was no difference between HPD and non-HPD
patients for the blood characteristics at baseline such as lympho-
cytes (P ¼ 0.64), neutrophils (P ¼ 0.69), albumin (P ¼ 0.23),
fibrinogen (P ¼ 0.43), or lactate dehydrogenase (P ¼ 0.097;
Supplementary Fig. S1E and S1F).
Importantly, we observed a significant difference between HPD
status and age. Patients with HPD were older than patients
without HPD (66 vs. 55, P ¼ 0.007; Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we
explored the influence of age on the response by RECIST. We
observed a significant correlation (Spearman r ¼ 0.18, P ¼ 0.036)
between age as a continuous variable and RECIST response (Fig.
4B and C). Practically, we observed that 19% (7 of 36) patients
older than 65 years presented HPD compared with 5% (5 of 95)
patients younger than 64 years (Fisher exact test, P ¼ 0.018). It
should be noted that the strength of all of these associations is
limited by sample size.
Association between HPD and OS
To investigate the association between HPD status and prog-
nosis, we computed the Kaplan–Meier OS estimates (landmark
survival analysis) according to the following classes: CR-PR, SD,
PD, non-HPD, and HPD. There was a clear trend toward worse
outcome for the patients with HPD (median OS, 4.6 months; 95%
CI, 2.0–NA) compared with the patients with non-HPD disease
progression (median OS, 7.6 months; 95% CI, 5.9–16.0),
although this was not significant due to a small number of
patients (P ¼ 0.19). However, the overall log-rank test was highly
significant (P < 1e-5) among all groups (Fig. 4D). The median
survival of the CR-PR and the SD groups is described in Supple-
mentary Table S1.
We further investigated whether the HPD status remained
associated with OS when adjusting to the Royal Marsden prog-
nostic score (RMH). In a multivariate cox model analysis, we
observed that both RMH prognostic score and the HPD-RECIST
(defined as CR-PR, SD, PD, non-HPD, HPD) were strongly
associated with OS: RMH (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.99–2.62; P ¼
0.06); HPD-adapted RECIST classes (HPD vs. CR-PR: HR, 25.94;
95% CI, 5.57–120.74; P ¼ 3.3 e-5). Practically, patients with SD,
PD, and HPD lead to a 4.94-, 16.54-, and 25.94-fold increase in
the death hazard compared with patients with CR-PR, respectively
(Supplementary Table S2).
Response by RECIST is inversely correlated with TGR during the
REF period in patients treated by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents
As observed in Fig. 3F, patients with PD by RECIST appeared
to have lower REF TGR. Conversely, patients with partial
response by RECIST appeared to have higher REF TGR. We
thus formally computed the correlation between REF TGR with
the RECIST evaluation (%) at the first tumor evaluation (Fig.
4E). We found a significant inverse correlation between TGR
during the REF period and the response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (P
¼ 0.0039).
When fitting a multivariate linear regression model of RECIST
(%), both the variables age >65 (estimate: 0.16; P ¼ 0.037) and
the TGR REF (estimate: �2.5e-4, P ¼ 8e-4) remained significant
(Supplementary Table S3). These latter data suggest that both of
these characteristics are crucial for the response to PD-1/PD-L1
blocking agents.

 Discussion
Although anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monotherapy can lead
to profound and durable tumor responses in some cases, our
results demonstrate that a subset of patients appears to expe-
rience a tumor flare under these agents. To our knowledge, this
study is the first to define this hyperprogressive feature in
immunotherapy-treated patients. The use of TGR was instru-
mental to shed light on the manifest tumor growth acceleration
after treatment onset. A total of 9% of evaluable patients (n ¼
12 of 131) were identified as experiencing HPD (defined as a
�2-fold increase of TGR in patients with disease progression).
Interestingly, we also observed that 18 patients (N ¼ 18 of 218,
8% of the total cohort) could not be evaluated because of a
clinical progression before the tumor evaluation, thus raising
the possibility that HPD frequency might be higher than the
here reported 9% frequency. In addition, as the TGR was
computed on the target lesions only (i.e., new lesions are not
included in the RECIST sum), patients who exhibit a fast
growing rate in new lesions only were not considered as HPD.
All together, these data may suggest a possible underestimation
of the HPD rate.
We observed that age is higher in patients with HPD versus
non-HPD. This may be explained by a different immunological
background in older patients such as modification of T-cell co-
stimulatory/co-inhibitory proteins expression or higher con-
centrations of inflammatory cytokines (20, 21). More impor-
tantly, this is consistent with previous and recurrent publica-
tions of 3 independent phase III trials, indicating that older

 patients appear to benefit less than younger patients (3–5, 22).
Future prospective studies are warranted to specifically address
this issue.
As reported here, we did not observe any difference in the
rate of HPD across the different histologies of cancers including
melanoma, urothelial, colorectal, ovarian, biliary tract carcino-
mas, and lymphomas. Others have reported similar flare-up
phenomenon in NSCLC and in head and neck cancers (10, 11).
These consistent observations may still be limited by the small
number of patients in the series and the multiple tests per-
formed in this study.
Opposing effects of immunotherapy have already been
described in melanoma using adjuvant IFNa where patients in
the treatment group who died during the study period displayed a
significantly reduced time from relapse to death compared with
control individuals (23). Interestingly, the phase III study of
nivolumab versus docetaxel in nonsquamous NSCLC shows that
the OS and progression-free survival curves in patients with PD-
L1–negative tumors tend to favor docetaxel until a time point
between 3 and 6 months (4). This may indicate that a subset of
patients may have had disease progression and/or death earlier
than expected. In our analysis, we did not find any difference (P ¼
0.24) between PD-L1–positive versus -negative tumors for HPD,
although these assertions may be limited by the low number
of patients with accessible PD-L1 status (N ¼ 35, 27% TGR
evaluable patients). This phenomenon of disease progression
acceleration is not specific for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents and was
sometimes observed with other therapeutic agents (24, 25). Also,
rapid progression at treatment discontinuation after long-term
response under VEGFR or EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
has been reported (12, 26–28). In this study, the fact that we did
not observe any effect related to the type of previous therapy
minimizes the risk that the HPD was related to the previous line of
therapy.
The striking acceleration of tumor disease observed in patients
with HPD could suggest an oncogenic signaling activation. It has

 been demonstrated that PD-1/PD-L1 signaling has cell-intrinsic
functions in tumor cells (29). Thus, depending on tumor cell
genetic alterations, it is possible that PD-1/PD-L1 blockade might
affect alternative signaling networks and enhance growth and/or
tumorigenesis.
Alternatively, immune compensatory mechanisms through the
upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints or the modula-
tion of other protumor immune subsets could have occurred
(30, 31). Activation of tumor lymphocytes could trigger local
inflammation, angiogenesis, matrix/tissue remodeling, or metab-
olism modification that could lead to tumor escape (32). Finally,
adaptive immune resistance may be a source of tumor heteroge-
neity and even a cancer-promoting mechanism in several cancers
(33–35).
In this study, we observed a significant inverse correlation
between TGR during the REF period and the response to anti-
PD-1/PD-L1 (P ¼ 0.0039). This association remained significant
even after adjustment for age and RMH score (data not shown).
These results showing slower growing tumors are less likely to
respond are opposite to what was observed previously for targeted
therapy (12, 13, 15). Indeed for molecular targeted agents, higher
TGR during the REF period was associated with higher risk of
disease progression at the first evaluation. These data demonstrate
important differences regarding mechanistic and kinetic antitu-
mor effects between antiproliferative agents and immune check-
point inhibitors.
For the first time ever, oncologists now face drugs with an
extraordinary antitumor potential in some patients, but which
also may induce a dramatic tumor surge in a fraction of
patients. Overall, the HPD phenomenon under immune check-
point blockade appears to be restricted to a small group of
patients (�10%). Our results show that it might represent a
concern for the use of PD-1 or PD-L1 blockers in the elderly
population. Early tumor assessment with TGR evaluation might
help decipher between HPD and PD from SD or PR patients in
this subsets of patients. Prospective evaluations of TGR for
patients who receive these agents are warranted to better
appraise this HPD phenomenon. Pre and early (1 month)
posttreatment biopsies would allow to explore the biologic
mechanisms behind HPD and identify predictive biomarkers to
avoid the patients at risk to be treated with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1.
Also, this HPD phenomenon might be limited to anti-PD-1/
PD-L1 monotherapy and might not be an issue upon combi-
nation therapies. This question shall be addressed in the
ongoing immunotherapy combination studies.
