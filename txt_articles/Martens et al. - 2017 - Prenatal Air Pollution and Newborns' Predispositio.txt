Abstract
Importance—Telomere length is a marker of biological aging that may provide a cellular 
memory of exposures to oxidative stress and inflammation. Telomere length at birth has been 
related to life expectancy. An association between prenatal air pollution exposure and telomere 
length at birth could provide new insights in the environmental influence on molecular longevity.
Objective—To assess the association of prenatal exposure to particulate matter (PM) with 
newborn telomere length as reflected by cord blood and placental telomere length.
Design, Setting, and Participants—In a prospective birth cohort (ENVIRONAGE 
[Environmental Influence on Ageing in Early Life]), a total of 730 mother-newborn pairs were 
recruited in Flanders, Belgium between February 2010 and December 2014, all with a singleton 
full-term birth (≥37 weeks of gestation). For statistical analysis, participants with full data on both 
cord blood and placental telomere lengths were included, resulting in a final study sample size of 
641.
Exposures—Maternal residential PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) 
exposure during pregnancy.
Main Outcomes and Measures—In the newborns, cord blood and placental tissue relative 
telomere length were measured. Maternal residential PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy was 
estimated using a high-resolution spatial-temporal interpolation method. In distributed lag models, 
both cord blood and placental telomere length were associated with average weekly exposures to 
PM2.5 during pregnancy, allowing the identification of critical sensitive exposure windows.
Results—In 641 newborns, cord blood and placental telomere length were significantly and 
inversely associated with PM2.5 exposure during midgestation (weeks 12-25 for cord blood and 
weeks 15-27 for placenta). A 5-μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 exposure during the entire pregnancy 
was associated with 8.8% (95% CI, −14.1% to −3.1%) shorter cord blood leukocyte telomeres and 
13.2% (95% CI, −19.3% to −6.7%) shorter placental telomere length. These associations were 
controlled for date of delivery, gestational age, maternal body mass index, maternal age, paternal 
age, newborn sex, newborn ethnicity, season of delivery, parity, maternal smoking status, maternal 
educational level, pregnancy complications, and ambient temperature.
Conclusions and Relevance—Mothers who were exposed to higher levels of PM2.5 gave 
birth to newborns with shorter telomere length. The observed telomere loss in newborns by 
prenatal air pollution exposure indicates less buffer for postnatal influences of factors decreasing 
telomere length during life. Therefore, improvements in air quality may promote molecular 
longevity from birth onward.
Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that cap the end of chromosomes. They can consist 
of several thousands of tandem-repeated TTAGGG sequences.1,2 With each cellular 
division, telomeres shorten. Telomere length (TL) has been associated with age-related 
diseases and mortality and is considered a marker of biological aging.3–8 Telomere length is 
also associated with environmental and lifestyle factors that influence the oxidative stress

 and inflammatory status in humans, such as smoking,9 obesity,10 Mediterranean diet,11 
exposure to violence,12 and life stress,13 which underscores the vulnerability of telomeres 
to reactive oxygen species (ROS). In a 2015 update of the Global Burden of Disease study, 
ambient particulate matter (PM) was ranked as the sixth most leading risk factor influencing 
public health worldwide.14 Increased oxidative stress and inflammation are proposed as 
underlying mechanisms through which PM may influence human health.15,16 Exposure to 
air pollution during in utero life may have adverse effects on the fetus and neonate.17–19 
The ability of PM air pollution to generate ROS has led to the hypothesis that telomere 
attrition is influenced by air pollution exposure.20 Occupational and population-based 
studies have described both positive and negative associations between different types of air 
pollution and TL in adults.21–27 In general, long-term exposure to PM25 and black carbon 
(BC)24,26 are associated with shorter TL in adults. Because TL is highly variable at birth,
28,29 potential determinants, such as newborn sex,28 paternal age,28 maternal prepregnancy 
body mass index (BMI),20 maternal stress,30 maternal educational level,31 maternal 
smoking during pregnancy,32 and maternal residential proximity to a major road,33 have 
recently been explored for explaining this phenomenon. In this regard, we hypothesized that 
exposure to PM air pollution during pregnancy may contribute to telomere setting at birth. 
Because in utero life is believed to be a critical time window in the early programming of 
diseases later in life,34 unravelling the connection between prenatal air pollution exposure 
and TL at birth may help to gain new insights in the causes of diseases linked with telomere 
biological characteristics. In this study, we assessed the association between prenatal 
exposure to PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) and TL at 
birth.
Methods
Study Population
From the ongoing population-based prospective Environmental Influence on Ageing in Early 
Life (ENVIRONAGE) birth cohort study, 730 mothers with a singleton full-term birth (≥37 
weeks of gestation) were selected.35 These mother-newborn pairs were recruited between 
February 2010 and December 2014 from noon on Fridays to 7 AM Mondays. The study 
protocol was approved by the ethical committees of Hasselt University and East-Limburg 
Hospital in Genk, Belgium, and has been carried out according to the Helsinki declaration.
36 The mother’s ability to fill out questionnaires in Dutch was a criterion for selection. 
Owing to missing exposure data (n = 10), the unavailability of DNA or bad DNA quality for 
cord blood (n = 12) and placenta (n = 51), and too high a variability of TL measurement 
between triplicates of cord blood (n = 10) or placental tissue (n = 9), we obtained cord blood 
TL samples from 698 mother-newborn pairs and placental TL samples from 660. For 
statistical analysis, we used participants with full data on both cord blood and placental TLs, 
resulting in a final study sample size of 641.
Mean Relative TL Measurement
DNA was extracted from cord blood buffy coat and placental tissue (details on sample 
collection are provided in eMethods 1 in the Supplement). Mean relative TL was determined 
in triplicate with a previously37 described modified quantitative, real-time polymerase chain

 reaction (qPCR) protocol.38 For cord blood, the triplicates of the telomere runs showed a 
coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.68%, those of single-copy gene runs a CV of 0.41%, and 
those of T/S ratios a CV of 6.4%. For placental telomeres, the triplicates of the telomere runs 
showed a CV of 0.70%, those of the single-copy gene runs a CV of 0.45%, and those of T/S 
ratios a CV of 6.9%.
Exposure Assessment
Based on the mother's residential address, daily mean PM2.5 concentrations (in micrograms 
per cubic meter) were estimated using a high-resolution spatial-temporal interpolation 
method (kriging)39 in combination with a dispersion model.40,41 This interpolation method 
uses hourly measured PM2.5 pollution data collected at the official fixed-site monitoring 
stations (n = 34) and land-cover data obtained from satellite images.42 The model chain 
provides daily PM2.5 values on a dense, irregular receptor grid by using data both from the 
Belgian telemetric air-quality network and emissions from point sources and line sources. In 
the Flemish region of Belgium, more than 80% (R2 = 0.8) of the temporal and spatial 
variability was explained by this interpolation tool.43 For each week of pregnancy from the 
date of conception onward, a mean PM2.5 concentration was calculated using daily mean 
PM2.5 concentrations at the mother’s residence. In case the mother had a gestation of less 
than 40 weeks, exposure was set at zero for the weeks after giving birth. The number of 
mothers who changed address during pregnancy (69 of 641 [10.7%]) was taken into account 
when calculating the weekly exposures. Weekly mean ambient temperatures were calculated 
based on the daily mean temperatures in degrees Celsius provided by the Royal 
Meteorological Institute, Brussels, Belgium.
General Study Procedures
At the first antenatal visit (weeks 7-9 of pregnancy), maternal BMI was determined by 
calculating weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. The date of conception 
was estimated on the basis of the first day of the mother’s last menstrual period combined 
with the first ultrasonographic examination. After delivery, mothers provided written 
informed consent and completed the study questionnaires in the post-delivery ward. We 
collected detailed information about the mothers, fathers, and newborns from questionnaires 
and medical records. Parity was categorized in mothers having their first newborn, having 
their second newborn, or having their third or more newborn. Maternal educational level was 
coded “low” when mothers did not obtain any diploma, “middle” when they obtained a high 
school diploma, and “high” when they obtained a college or university degree. Maternal 
smoking status was categorized as “never smoker,” “former smoker” when the mother had 
quit smoking before pregnancy, and “smoker” when smoking continued during pregnancy. 
Newborns were classified as white European when 2 or more grandparents were Europeans, 
and non-European when at least 3 grandparents were of non-European origin. The presence 
of pregnancy complications was defined as the experience by the mother of 1 or more of the 
following conditions during pregnancy: gestational diabetes, hypertension, infectious 
disease, preeclampsia, vaginal bleeding, and hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Perinatal 
measures, such as birth date, newborn sex, birth weight, and Apgar score were obtained after 
birth.

 Statistical Analysis
We used distributed lag models (DLMs) to model the association between log10-transformed 
TL and mean weekly PM2.5 exposures during gestational weeks 1 to 40. A distributed lag 
(nonlinear) model (DLNM) is defined through a “cross-basis” function, which allows the 
simultaneous estimation of an (nonlinear) exposure-response association and nonlinear 
effects across lags, the latter termed lag-response association.44The exposure-response 
function was assumed to be linear and the lag structure was modeled using a natural cubic 
spline with 5 df, setting the knots at equally spaced values in the original lag scale (1-40 
weeks). The number of knots was chosen based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC).
45 We also included a cross-basis for weekly mean temperature in the model. We used a 
natural cubic spline with 4 df for the temperature-TL function and a natural cubic spline 
with 5 df for the lag structure (with knots at equally spaced values in the original lag scale). 
In addition, we accounted for a priori selected covariates that include known determinants of 
newborn or adult TL and variables with a potential link with PM2.5 and TL, such as date of 
delivery, gestational age, maternal BMI, maternal age, paternal age, newborn's sex, ethnicity, 
season of delivery, parity, maternal smoking status, maternal educational level, and 
pregnancy complications. We calculated cumulative effect estimates for the 3 trimesters of 
pregnancy (weeks 1-13, weeks 14- 26, and weeks 27-40) and the overall (40-week) 
cumulative estimate. Final estimates are presented as percentage change (with 95% CI) in 
TL for a 5-μg/m3 increment in PM2.5. Details on secondary analyses (ie, average exposure 
models, effect modification by sex, and nonlinear dose-response models) and sensitivity 
analyses are provided in eMethods 2 in the Supplement. All analyses were performed with 
the statistical software R, version 3.3.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing) using the dlnm 
package.46
Results
Characteristics of the Study Population
Table 1 describes the general characteristics of the study population (n = 641). The 
newborns, among them 318 girls (49.6%), had a mean (SD) gestational age of 39.4 (1.0) 
weeks and a mean (SD) birth weight of 3451 (428) g. Most (n = 567, 88.5%) of the 
newborns were Europeans of white ethnicity. The mean relative TL of newborns ranged 
from 0.51 to 1.75 in cord blood and from 0.52 to 1.89 for placental tissue. Associations of 
covariates with newborn TL are reported in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Mean (SD) 
maternal age was 29.1 (4.6) years, and mean (SD) maternal BMI was 24.3 (4.5). Among the 
mothers, 351 (54.8%) were primiparous and 224 (34.9%) secundiparous. Mean weekly 
PM2.5 exposure was 13.4 μg/m3 (5th-95th percentile, 4.3-32.5 μg/m3). eFigure 1 in the 
Supplement shows the contours of the annual PM2.5 exposure in the recruitment area and the 
places of residence of the mothers during pregnancy.
Association Between Prenatal PM2.5 Exposure and Newborn TL
Scatterplots showing newborn TL in association with average PM2.5 exposure during the 
entire pregnancy are shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement. Lag-specific (weekly) DLM 
estimates of the association between PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy and TL at birth are 
presented in the Figure. Cord blood as well as placental TL were inversely associated with

 PM2.5 exposure during midgestation: significant estimates were observed for weeks 12 to 25 
in cord blood (Figure, A), with the largest negative association in week 19 and for weeks 15 
to 27 in placenta (Figure, B), with the largest negative association in week 21. In contrast, a 
positive association between PM2.5 and cord blood TL was observed for exposure in weeks 
32 to 34. The estimated overall (weeks 1-40) change in TL for a 5-μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 
exposure was −8.8% (95% CI, −14.1 to −3.1%) for cord blood and −13.2% (95% CI, 
−19.3% to −6.7%) for placenta (Table 2). Trimester-specific cumulative estimates were only 
significant for the second trimester: −9.4% (95% CI, −13.1 to −5.6%) for cord blood and 
−7.1% (95% CI, −11.6% to −2.4%) for placental TL.
The existence of vulnerable exposure windows (ie, the hypothesis that exposure during some 
weeks of pregnancy is more critical than during others) was tested by comparing the main 
DLM model with a DLM model assuming a constant risk during the different weeks of 
pregnancy (likelihood ratio test on 4 df). The main DLM model provided a better fit than the 
constant-risk model for cord blood (AIC, -1418.4 vs -1407.0, P = .001) but not for placental 
telomeres (AIC, -1173.2 vs -1177.4, P = .46). The DLM estimates are corroborated by 
results from the average exposure models (Table 2). For instance, the change in TL for a 5-
μg/m3 increment in mean PM2.5 over the entire pregnancy was -8.4% (95% CI, -13.5% to 
-2.9%) in cord blood and -12.5% (95% CI, -18.4% to -6.2%) in placenta. We did not observe 
a significant modification in the association by newborn sex for cord and placental TL, and 
we observed a nonlinear dose-response correlation (eTables 2 and 3 in the Supplement, 
respectively). Assuming constant associations within the strata of lags 1 to 10, 11 to 20, 21 
to 30, and 31 to 40 (eFigure 3 in the Supplement), evidence for the positive association 
between cord blood TL and PM2.5 toward the end of pregnancy is less evident. Cumulative 
estimates from sensitivity analyses were similar to those from the main model (Table 3).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting an association between PM2.5 exposure 
during in utero life and newborn TL. After adjustment for several covariates and potential 
confounders, maternal exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy was associated with 8.8% 
shorter newborn cord blood and 13.2% shorter placental telomeres. By applying distributed 
lag models based on weekly mean PM2.5 exposures, we identified specific vulnerable 
periods during pregnancy. Both cord blood and placental TLs were negatively associated 
with PM2.5 exposure during the second trimester of pregnancy. The finding that early-life TL 
might forecast life span, as observed in an animal-based study of zebra finches,47 underlines 
the importance of the identification of early-life TL determinants. In this regard, our results 
may have important health consequences later in life because a shorter TL at birth indicates 
less buffer capacity for postnatal influence of insults (eg, inflammation on TL). Particulate 
air pollution may generate ROS in a direct manner via the Fenton reaction operating at the 
particle surface,48 or in an indirect manner via altered mitochondrial and nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase functions or via inflammatory cell activation.49 
Telomeres contain a great amount of guanine bases, which are vulnerable to ROS. Reactive 
oxygen species can induce DNA breakage, leading to increased telomere shortening in 
addition to cellular replication.50 The major route for airborne particles to enter the maternal 
organism is via inhalation. Ultrafine particles (UFPs) with a diameter less than 0.1 μm (<100

 nm) are able to cross the airway-blood barrier, may enter the bloodstream, and are 
transported to different body compartments.51–53 Whether particles can cross the placental 
barrier is still debated because of the rather limited evidence. Nevertheless, it has been 
shown recently that nanoparticles up to 240 nm can cross the human placental barrier and 
nanoparticles up to 500 nm may enter the fetal circulation in mice.54,55 An elevated 
oxidative stress status in both mother and newborn may be a potential explanation for our 
findings concerning PM2.5 exposure observed in the present study. Earlier studies present 
positive associations between air pollution exposure and placental tissue nitrosative stress56 
and mitochondrial oxidative stress.57 We identified the mid-pregnancy period as a critical 
time window for the association of PM2.5 exposure with newborn TL. This finding is in 
agreement with the development of the placental barrier and maternal-fetal circulation. In 
the first months of pregnancy, the placental barrier remains thick with no perfusion but 
becomes thinner during the course of pregnancy concomitantly with increased fetal capillary 
development until week 10, which from then onward will facilitate an enhanced maternal-
fetal exchange of nutrients and waste products.58 Exposure to PM2.5 late in pregnancy (from 
weeks 32-34) is associated with longer telomeres in cord blood, although evidence is not 
conclusive. This finding may suggest the presence of a potential compensatory or 
overcompensatory mechanism in response to air pollution exposure in cord that is absent in 
placenta. Positive associations between leukocyte TL and recent exposure to air pollution 
have been observed previously in adults.21,22,25 An increase of telomerase activity in 
lymphocytes and a clonal expansion of subpopulations of lymphocytes with longer 
telomeres following acute exposure have been suggested as potential underlying 
mechanisms.21,59,60 Telomere length as assessed in the present study is a result of the 
combination between shortening and elongating processes prior to the telomere assessment 
time point. However, owing to the cumulative burden of oxidative stress during the entire 
pregnancy, overall newborn TL was inversely associated with prenatal exposure to air 
pollution. The stronger overall influence of PM on placental telomeres compared with cord 
blood may be due to this potential compensatory mechanism in cord blood, as we observed 
both positive and negative estimates for PM2.5 exposure and cord blood TL during 
pregnancy, whereas all estimates were negative for placental TL.
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several strengths. First, we have a large sample size of newborns with 
matching cord blood and placental tissue to study TL in relation to PM2.5 air pollution 
exposure. Second, we used high-resolution exposure estimates based on the home addresses 
of the mothers, and we integrated daily concentrations to estimate weekly mean exposure 
during pregnancy. Compared with the more conventional approach of averaging exposures 
over relatively large time windows (trimesters or the entire pregnancy), the use of DLM 
allowed a more detailed investigation of prenatal exposure windows and enabled the 
identification of midpregnancy as a critical period for the association of PM2.5 with TL in 
cord blood as well as placenta. Third, our findings are generalizable because our study 
population is representative of the gestational segment of the population at large.35
However owing to spatial variations in PM2.5 concentrations, differences in exposure may 
exist, as our population was recruited in a relatively small area. Our study should also be

 interpreted within the context of its potential limitations. Our results are based on exposure 
at the maternal residence, and potential misclassification may be present because we could 
not account for other exposure sources that contribute to personal exposure, such as 
exposure during a commute, at work, and elsewhere. However, proxies of exposure, such as 
residential proximity to major roads, have been shown recently to be associated with internal 
exposure to nanosized particles, reflecting exposure to black carbon.61 The assessment of 
TL at birth represents a specific snapshot in the gestational period. We were not able to 
evaluate telomere dynamics throughout the entire pregnancy period, and, in view of our 
results, the role of telomerase needs further evaluation. Parental TL may be a determinant of 
the initial telomere length setting of the next generation.28 Because parents exposed to 
PM2.5 may have shorter telomeres, the association between PM2.5 exposure and newborn TL 
may be mediated by parental TLs. Unfortunately, this mediation could not be evaluated in 
the ENVIRONAGE study because data on parental TLs were not available.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this study is the first to report an association between prenatal exposure 
to PM2.5 air pollution and TL at birth, both in cord blood and placental tissue. We theorize 
that biological aging is associated with PM2.5 air pollution exposure, even before birth, 
which may underlie potential adverse health consequences later in life. This study adds to 
the growing body of evidence that even relatively low levels of prenatal exposure to air 
pollution contributes to fetal programming at the molecular level and more precisely at the 
level of telomere biological features. Adequate reduction of environmental fine-particle air 
pollution levels may promote longevity as from birth onwards and may enhance overall 
quality of life. Prospective follow-up studies are needed to further elucidate the outcome of 
PM2.5-linked telomere shortening at birth in relation to pediatric and adult health and disease 
later in life.

 Key Points
Question
Is telomere length at birth (a marker of biological aging) influenced by exposure to 
particulate matter air pollution during in utero life?
Findings
In this birth cohort study of 641 mother-newborn pairs, mothers with higher residential 
exposure to PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm air 
pollution) gave birth to newborns with significantly lower telomere length that could not 
be explained by other factors including socioeconomic class. For a 5-μg/m3 increase in 
residential PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy, cord blood telomeres were 9% shorter and 
placental telomeres 13% shorter.
Meaning
Improved air quality may promote molecular longevity from birth onward.

Prenatal PM2.5. Exposure During Pregnancy
Week-specific estimates provided as a percentage change in mean relative TL (with 95% CI) 
for a 5-μg/m3 increment of PM2.5 air pollution exposure. Models were adjusted for date of 
delivery, gestational age, maternal body mass index, maternal age, paternal age, newborn 
sex, newborn ethnicity, season of delivery, parity, maternal smoking status, maternal 
educational level, pregnancy complications, and ambient temperature. PM2.5 indicates 
particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less.
