Association between electronic cigarette use and changes in quit 
attempts, success of quit attempts, use of smoking cessation 
pharmacotherapy, and use of stop smoking services in England: 
time series analysis of population trends

ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To estimate how far changes in the prevalence of 
electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use in England have 
been associated with changes in quit success, quit 
attempts, and use of licensed medication and 
behavioural support in quit attempts.
Design
Time series analysis of population trends.
PartiCiPants
Participants came from the Smoking Toolkit Study, 
which involves repeated, cross sectional household 
surveys of individuals aged 16 years and older in 
England. Data were aggregated on about 1200 smokers 
quarterly between 2006 and 2015. Monitoring data 
were also used from the national behavioural support 
programme; during the study, 8 029 012 quit dates 
were set with this programme.
setting
England.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Prevalence of e-cigarette use in current smokers and 
during a quit attempt were used to predict quit 
success. Prevalence of e-cigarette use in current 
smokers was used to predict rate of quit attempts. 
Percentage of quit attempts involving e-cigarette use 
was also used to predict quit attempts involving use of 
prescription treatments, nicotine replacement therapy 
(NRT) on prescription and bought over the counter, and 
use of behavioural support. Analyses involved 
adjustment for a range of potential confounders.
results
The success rate of quit attempts increased by 0.098% 
(95% confidence interval 0.064 to 0.132; P<0.001) and 
0.058% (0.038 to 0.078; P<0.001) for every 1% increase 
in the prevalence of e-cigarette use by smokers and 
e-cigarette use during a recent quit attempt, respectively. 
There was no clear evidence for an association between 
e-cigarette use and rate of quit attempts (β 0.025; 95% 
confidence interval −0.035 to 0.085; P=0.41), use of NRT 
bought over the counter (β 0.006; −0.088 to 0.077; 
P=0.89), use of prescription treatment (β −0.070; −0.152 
to 0.013; P=0.10), or use of behavioural support (β 
−0.013; −0.102 to 0.077; P=0.78). A negative association 
was found between e-cigarette use during a recent quit 
attempt and use of NRT obtained on prescription (β 
−0.098; −0.189 to −0.007; P=0.04).
COnClusiOn
Changes in prevalence of e-cigarette use in England have 
been positively associated with the success rates of quit 
attempts. No clear association has been found between 
e-cigarette use and the rate of quit attempts or the 
use of other quitting aids, except for NRT obtained on 
prescription, where the association has been negative.

Introduction
There has been concern that the increase in population 
use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) could be under-
mining quitting activities.1-7  If this is true, then e-ciga-
rettes could have a negative effect on public health, even 
if they might increase the chances of success for an indi-
vidual smoker using them in a given quit attempt.8 9 
 
England is a country with a relatively liberal regulatory 
framework for e-cigarettes and has seen a considerable 
growth in their use.10 
11  It also has unique time series 
data to be able to estimate changes over time in key quit-
ting activities as a function of changes in prevalence of 
e-cigarette use while adjusting for other potential con-
founding variables.10 12 This study used data from 
England to address the concerns that have been raised.
One source of concern about the potential impact of 
e-cigarettes on quitting activity arises from a fall in the 
use of licensed treatments and behavioural support pro-
grammes in England to stop smoking.10 
13  This may be a 
result of smokers using e-cigarettes instead.14- 
16  How-
ever, the decrease could also be due to other factors or a 
secular trend unconnected to the rise in e-cigarette use. 
In a related study, we found that the increase in popula-
tion rates of e-cigarette use while smoking was probably 
not responsible for a decline in use of nicotine replace-
ment therapy (NRT) for smoking reduction.10
It has also been proposed that smokers who currently 
use or have used e-cigarettes in the past are less likely 
subsequently to quit smoking.1-7  However, data on the

prevalence of e-cigarette use in quit attempts—com-
bined with evidence from randomised controlled trials 
and a real world effectiveness study suggesting that 
e-cigarettes are about as effective as NRT obtained on 
prescription8 9 17-20 —leads to an estimate of an addi-
tional 16 000-22 000 ex-smokers created each year from 
the use of e-cigarettes in England.21 If e-cigarette use is 
harming or promoting smoking cessation in a popula-
tion, it should be possible to observe an association 
between changes in e-cigarette use over time and 
changes in quit attempts and successful quit attempts, 
adjusting for potential confounding variables in the 
population such as tobacco control policies. This would 
provide a direct estimate of the public health impact of 
the rise in e-cigarette use.
Time series analysis of population trends affords this 
ability by directly estimating the population level 
impact of policies and events. Where associations are 
found, they cannot establish a causal association but 
can be indicative. For example, these associations have 
been used to estimate the effect of price of cigarettes on 
population consumption, mass media expenditure on 
use of specialist stop smoking services, and introduc-
tion of varenicline to the market on the prevalence of 
use of smoking cessation treatment.22-24 If associations 
are not found, or they go in a direction opposite to that 
expected, this can also be informative.
Therefore, this study aimed to assess, using time 
series analysis, whether changes in e-cigarette use at a 
population level have been associated with changes in 
key smoking cessation activities and use of licensed 
smoking cessation treatment. More specifically, we 
were interested in:
• The association between success rates of individuals 
who made a quit attempt in the past 12 months, and 
(a) prevalence of e-cigarette use among current 
smokers and (b) prevalence of e-cigarette use during 
quit attempts.
• The association between the proportion of past year 
smokers who attempted to quit smoking and preva-
lence of e-cigarette use among current smokers.
• The associations between the percentage of quit 
attempts involving e-cigarette use and (a) the propor-
tions of past year quit attempts that involved the use of 
licensed smoking cessation treatments (any prescrip-
tion treatment, NRT on prescription, and NRT bought 
over the counter), and (b) the number of smokers who 
set a quit date with the English stop smoking services.
A set of covariates were added to the models to take 
account of potential confounding, including tobacco 
control policies, mass media expenditure, and smoking 
prevalence.
Methods
Data sources
Data came from two main sources: the Smoking Toolkit 
Study and the English national health service (NHS) 
stop smoking services. The Smoking Toolkit Study 
involves a series of monthly household, face-to-face, 
computer assisted surveys of representative samples of 
the population in England aged 16 years or more.12 The 
study has been collecting data since November 2006, 
and uses a type of random location sampling, which is 
a hybrid between random probability and simple quota 
sampling. England is first split into over 170 000 output 
areas, comprising about 300 households. These areas 
are then stratified according to ACORN characteristics 
and geographical region (http://acorn.caci.co.uk) and 
are randomly allocated to interviewers. Data are col-
lected on approximately 1200 smokers each quarter.
Participants from the Smoking Toolkit Study seem to be 
representative of the population in England, having simi-
lar sociodemographic composition and smoking charac-
teristics to large national surveys based on probability 
samples, such as the Health Survey for England.12 The 
study’s website (www.smokinginengland.info)  
provides 
further details, including the published  
protocol.12
Statistics on use of the NHS stop smoking service 
were obtained from the NHS Information Centre.25 
 
These statistics include the quarterly number of indi-
viduals setting a quit date at stop smoking services. 
Before April 2013, these data were collected at the stra-
tegic health authority and primary care trust level, 
before moving to the regional and local authority level 
after a change in commissioning arrangements.26
Measures
The dataset consisted of quarterly data on the explana-
tory, outcome, and covariates of interest. Details of the 
questions used to derive these variables are given below.
Explanatory variables
Quarterly data on e-cigarette use among current smok-
ers and among those who made a quit attempt was 
obtained from the Smoking Toolkit Study. Participants 
who reported that they smoked cigarettes (including 
hand rolled cigarettes) every day or less often were 
asked to answer the following questions by selecting an 
option from a list of nicotine products (which included 
e-cigarette use):
1. Which, if any, of the following are you currently using 
to help you cut down the amount you smoke?
2. Do you regularly use any of the following in situa-
tions when you are not allowed to smoke?
3. Can I check, are you using any of the following either 
to help you stop smoking, to help you cut down, or 
for any other reason at all?
Prevalence of use of e-cigarettes in current smokers was 
obtained for each quarter by counting the number of 
respondents who endorsed use of e-cigarettes in 
response to any of the three questions above, divided by 
the number of cigarette smokers. Data were first  
collected 
in 2011; prior to this, prevalence was assumed to be sta-
ble at 0.1% of smokers based on previous  
estimations.27 
28
E-cigarette use during a recent quit attempt was also 
ascertained from the Smoking Toolkit Study. In the study, 
past year smokers who had made a quit attempt in the pre-
vious 12 months were asked the following question: 
“Which, if any, of the following did you try to help you stop 
smoking during the most recent serious quit attempt?”

Past year smokers answered the question by selecting 
from a list of cessation aids (including e-cigarette use).
Prevalence of use of e-cigarettes in a quit attempt was 
calculated for each quarter by dividing the number of 
respondents who reported having used e-cigarettes by 
the number of those who reported having made a quit 
attempt. Data were first collected in 2009; prior to this, 
prevalence was assumed to be stable at 0.1%.
Outcome variables
Data on outcome variables also came from the Smoking 
Toolkit Study. Past year smokers were asked three 
 
questions:
1. How many serious attempts to stop smoking have you 
made in the last 12 months? By serious attempt I 
mean you decided that you would try to make sure 
you never smoked again. Please include any attempt 
that you are currently making and please include any 
successful attempt made within the last year.
2. How long did your most recent serious quit attempt 
last before you went back to smoking?
3. Which, if any, of the following did you try to help 
you stop smoking during the most recent serious 
quit attempt?
The prevalence of quit attempts in each quarter was cal-
culated as the number of respondents who reported 
having made one or more quit attempts in the past 12 
months divided by the number of past year smokers. 
The success rate in each quarter was calculated as the 
number of respondents reporting that they were still 
not smoking divided by the number reporting having 
made a quit attempt.
For each quarter, we calculated the prevalence of use 
of (1) NRT over the counter, (2) NRT on prescription, and 
(3) any treatment on prescription (NRT, bupropion, or 
varenicline) by dividing the number of respondents 
reporting use of each aid by the number reporting that 
they had tried to quit in the past 12 months. In England, 
over-the-counter treatments, or the self medication 
market, refer to all products that can be brought in 
pharmacies and other shops (including supermarkets) 
without a prescription.
Statistics on the use of the NHS stop smoking service 
were obtained from the NHS Information Centre.25 Data 
were available up to the first quarter of 2015.
Other covariates
In England, tobacco mass media campaigns have been 
run as part of a national tobacco control programme. 
Spending was almost completely suspended in 2010 
and then reintroduced in 2011 at a much lower level. 
Previous studies have shown that such cuts were 
 
associated with a decreased use of smoking cessation 
support.23 29 Thus, advertising expenditure was 
included as adjustment. Data were obtained from Pub-
lic Health England.
Several tobacco control policies were adjusted for in 
the analyses (assuming pulse effects). These adjusted 
policies included the change in commissioning of stop 
smoking services from central to local authorities in 
April 2013,26  the introduction of a smoking ban in July 
2007
,30  and the change in the minimum age of sale of 
cigarettes from 16 to 18 years in October 2007
.31
Smoking prevalence, estimated from the Smoking 
Toolkit Study, was also included as an additional 
covariate when assessing the impact on the number of 
smokers setting a quit date at the stop smoking services. 
This covariate allows adjustment for the fact that any 
fall in absolute numbers of people using the services 
could reflect the overall decline over time in smoking 
prevalence.
Price of cigarettes increased linearly over time with a 
correlation of 0.99. Therefore, any effect of price on out-
come measures could not be distinguished from a linear 
change over time for which we were already account-
ing, by differencing the time series (that is, using the 
difference between successive values of the outcome 
variables rather than the values themselves).
analysis
The analysis plan was registered on the Open Science 
Framework before data analysis (https://osf.io/fbgj2/). 
We analysed all data in R version 3.2.1, using autoregres-
sive integrated moving average with exogeneous input 
(ARIMAX) modelling.32  ARIMAX is an extension of autore-
gressive integrated moving average analysis, which pro-
duces forecasts based on prior values in the time series 
(autoregressive terms) and the errors made by previous 
predictions (moving average terms). Such models have 
been used to explore the effect of tobacco price and mass 
media campaigns on smoking prevalence.33
We followed a standard ARIMAX modelling 
approach,32  which is detailed in supplementary appen-
dix 1. The series were first log transformed to stabilise the 
variance, and first differenced and seasonally differ-
enced if required. First differencing involves calculating 
the change between one observation and the next, while 
seasonal differencing involves calculating the change 
between one year and the next. The autocorrelation and 
partial autocorrelation functions were then examined to 
determine the seasonal and non-seasonal moving aver-
age and autoregressive terms. To identify the most appro-
priate transfer function for the continuous explanatory 
variables, we checked the sample cross correlation func-
tion and compared models with varying lags using the 
Akaike information criterion.  
Coefficients can be inter-
preted as estimates of the  
percentage change in the out-
come of interest for every percentage increase in use of 
e-cigarettes and mass media, and absolute change as a 
consequence of tobacco control policies (or 100×(exp(co-
efficient−1)) in terms of absolute percentage change). 
STROBE guidelines were followed throughout.34
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for recruitment, design, or implemen-
tation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results. There are no 
plans to disseminate the results of the research directly 
to study participants or any specific patient community.

Results
sample characteristics
Data were collected on 170 490 individuals aged 16 
years and over taking part in the Smoking Toolkit Study 
who reported their smoking status. Of these partici-
pants, 41 301 (weighted 23.1% (95% confidence interval 
22.9% to 23.3%; unweighted 24.2% (24.0% to 24.4%)) 
were past year smokers and 37 765 (21.0% (20.8% to 
21.2%); 22.2% (22.0% to 22.3%)) were current smokers. 
During the study, 8 029 012 individuals set a quit date 
with their stop smoking service.
Figure 1 shows a fall followed by an increase and then 
a further decline in the proportion of past year smokers 
reporting a quit attempt. The proportion changed from 
45.4% at the start of the study to 31.2% in the last quar-
ter of the study (mean 37
.6% (standard deviation 3.8)). 
There was an overall increase in the success rate of 
those who reported a quit attempt (from 10.6% in the 
last quarter of 2006 to 18.6% in the first quarter of 2015; 
overall mean 15.2% (standard deviation 2.8)). Over the 
same period, current use of e-cigarettes among smokers 
increased from negligible use in the last quarter of 2006 
to 21.3% at the end of the study (mean 6.4% (standard 
deviation 8.2)), and e-cigarette use in a quit attempt 
also rose from negligible use in the last quarter of 2006 
to 35.0% in the first quarter of 2015 (8.6% (12.5)).
Table 1  shows the proportion of smokers using vari-
ous treatments during their most recent quit attempt, 
and the number of smokers setting a quit date with stop 
smoking services. Figure 2 shows that use of prescribed 
treatment and stop smoking services rose up to the 
fourth quarter of 2011, after which there was a decline. 
In contrast, use of NRT obtained over the counter and on 
prescription declined steadily. Supplementary figure 1 
shows the changes in smoking prevalence and mass 
media expenditure over time, and the time points for the 
introduction of the relevant tobacco control  
policies.
association between e-cigarette use among current 
smokers and during a quit attempt among those 
who made a quit attempt and the success of quit 
attempts
In adjusted analyses, e-cigarette use by smokers was 
positively associated with the success of attempts to 
stop, such that for every 1% increase in e-cigarette use, 
the success of quit attempts increased by 0.098%. 
 
E-cigarette use in quit attempts was also positively asso-
ciated with quit success, with every 1% rise in use asso-
ciated with a 0.058% increase in the success of 
attempts. In addition, there was evidence of a rise in 
successful quitting following the increase in the age of 
sale of cigarettes, and a positive association between 
mass media spending and quit success (table 2).
association between use of e-cigarettes among 
current smokers and quit attempts
In adjusted and unadjusted analyses, the data were 
inconclusive as to whether an association was present 
between current use of e-cigarettes by smokers and 
attempts to quit smoking (table 3).
association between use of e-cigarettes during a 
quit attempt among those who made a quit attempt 
on use of prescription treatment, prescription nrt, 
over-the-counter nrt, and specialist services
After adjustment, the findings were inconclusive as to 
whether an association was present between e-cigarette 
use during a quit attempt and the use of stop smoking 
services, NRT over the counter, and prescription treat-
ment. However, a significant association was found 
with use of NRT on prescription: for every 1% increase 
in e-cigarette use in a quit attempt, the use of

e-cigarette use
• 0.034% and 0.113% change in the success of quit

• 0.113% change in use of stop smoking services
• 0.137% change in use of any prescription treatment
• 0.145% change in use of NRT on prescription
• 0.116% change in the use of NRT obtained over the 
counter.
discussion
Principal findings
The increase in e-cigarette use in England has been pos-
itively associated with the success rates of quit attempts 
after adjustment for a range of confounding variables. 
No clear association has emerged between e-cigarette 
use and prevalence of quit attempts or use of licensed 
NRT bought over the counter, prescription treatment, or 
behavioural support. However, use of e-cigarettes in 
quit attempts has been negatively associated with use 
of NRT on prescription.
strengths and limitations of study
To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to 
estimate the population impact of e-cigarettes on 
attempts to quit smoking and their success, the use of 
smoking cessation pharmacotherapy, and the use of 
stop smoking services, using a time series approach. 
Strengths of the study are the use of a large representa-
tive sample of the English population, in addition to 
service use data.
The study had several limitations. Firstly, estimates 
of the impact of some tobacco control policies were 
implausibly large and confidence intervals wide, partic-
ularly for the increase in age of sale of cigarettes from 16 
to 18 years, suggesting caution when drawing conclu-
sions about these variables. Event type explanatory 
variables with short time periods before their occur-
rence in ARIMA type models often give inaccurate esti-
mates and wide standard errors.37  Thus, the short lead 
in period could have created a spurious association in 
the present study,35  although the increase in age of sale 
in England has been previously associated with a 
decline in smoking prevalence in younger age groups.31 
 
Future studies should consider variations in the impact 
of tobacco control policies, such as more prolonged 
pulse effects, delayed effects, and sustained effects.32
Secondly, the impact of the move from central to local 
authority control may be better explained by the inclusion 
of a variable reflecting expenditure by stop smoking ser-
vices. However, such data were not available. Thirdly, the 
Smoking Toolkit Study required participants to recall use 
of aids during the previous 12 months, which could have 
introduced bias. Fourthly, the findings might not gener-

alise to other countries. England has a strong tobacco con-
trol climate and generally high motivation to quit among 
smokers, and relatively liberal regulation of e-cigarettes. 
In countries with weaker tobacco control, or stricter regu-
lation of e-cigarettes, different effects may be observed. 
Fifthly, although we are unaware of any other major popu-
lation level interventions or other events during the study 
period, we cannot rule out residual confounding. Sixthly, 
caution should be taken when interpreting null effects, 
and readers should not assume that they represent no 
association.38  Instead, we can only conclude that in the 
presence of a P value greater than 0.05, the data are incon-
clusive as to whether an association exists39; although this 
study was powered to detect relatively small associations.
Finally, for a full assessment of the impact of e-ciga-
rettes on public health, future studies should assess the 
impact on use among never smokers. Although previ-
ous studies report a rise in experimentation by never 
smokers, regular use is rare at below 1%.40-43  Consider-
ation is also needed as to what might have contributed 
to the decline in rates of attempts to quit smoking in 
recent years. Studies suggest a possible role of reduced 
spending on mass media campaigns23 ; that smokers 
have become inured to smoking cessation messages44 ; 
and the financial crisis and austerity measures within 
Europe.45 We did not find a clear impact of any of our 
measures on quit attempts over the period studied.
Comparison with other studies
The findings of the present study conflict with the hypoth-
esis that an increase in population use of e-cigarettes 
undermines quitting in general, but it may have reduced 
the use of NRT on prescription. If the link between change 
in e-cigarette use and smoking cessation rate is causal, 
then every 10 percentage point increase in e-cigarette use 
in quit attempts would result in a 0.58 percentage point 
change in successful quit attempts, other things being 
equal. With quit attempts at 32.5% of eight million smok-
ers (2.6 million) in 2015, and prevalence of e-cigarette use 
in quit attempts at 36% in that year, this equates to 54 288 
additional short to medium term quitters in 2015 com-
pared with no use of e-cigarettes in quit attempts.21  We 
would expect up to two thirds of these individuals to 
relapse at some point in the future, so we would estimate 
that e-cigarettes may have contributed about 18 000 addi-
tional long term ex-smokers in 2015. This figure is similar 
to that estimated indirectly using the estimated effect size 
of e-cigarettes and the numbers using them.21
Although these numbers are relatively small, they are 
broadly similar to previous estimates,21  and are clini-
cally significant because of the huge health gains from 
stopping smoking. A 40 year old smoker who quits per-
manently can expect to gain nine life years compared 
with a continuing smoker.46-48 This number of addi-
tional quitters is unlikely to produce a detectable effect 
on smoking prevalence in the short term, but might be 
picked up over a period of several years.
The finding of an impact on prevalence of use of NRT 
obtained on prescription but not over the counter is 
 
difficult to explain. One possibility is that health profes-
sionals are discussing the options with patients who are 
then choosing to use e-cigarettes, perhaps having already 
tried NRT.49-51  This issue requires further research. These 
findings suggest that e-cigarettes have possibly not been 
responsible for the large decline in NRT obtained over the 
counter market.10 It is possible that the trend reflects lon-
ger term disillusionment with licensed nicotine products, 
which warrants further investigation.
Conclusion and policy implications
The increased prevalence of e-cigarettes in England does 
not appear to have been associated with a detectable 
change in attempts to stop smoking. However, the increase 
in e-cigarette use has been associated with an increase in 
success of quit attempts. Growth in the use of e-cigarettes 
for quitting has also been associated with a decline in use 
of NRT obtained on prescription, but has not clearly been 
associated with the use of other quitting support.
