IMPORTANCE Novel approaches to perioperative surgical care focus on optimizing nutrition,
mobility, and pain management to minimize adverse events after surgical procedures.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the outcomes of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program
among 2 target populations: patients undergoing elective colorectal resection and patients
undergoing emergency hip fracture repair.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A pre-post difference-in-differences study before and
after ERAS implementation in the target populations compared with contemporaneous
surgical comparator groups (patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery and
emergency orthopedic surgery). Implementation began in February and March 2014 and
concluded by the end of 2014 at 20 medical centers within the Kaiser Permanente Northern
California integrated health care delivery system.
EXPOSURES A multifaceted ERAS program designed with a particular focus on perioperative
pain management, mobility, nutrition, and patient engagement.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was hospital length of stay.
Secondary outcomes included hospital mortality, home discharge, 30-day readmission rates,
and complication rates.
RESULTS The study included a total of 3768 patients undergoing elective colorectal resection
(mean [SD] age, 62.7 [14.1] years; 1812 [48.1%] male) and 5002 patients undergoing
emergency hip fracture repair (mean [SD] age, 79.5 [11.8] years; 1586 [31.7%] male).
Comparator surgical patients included 5556 patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal
surgery and 1523 patients undergoing emergency orthopedic surgery. Most process metrics
had significantly greater changes in the ERAS target populations after implementation
compared with comparator surgical populations, including those for ambulation, nutrition,
and opioid use. Hospital length of stay and postoperative complication rates were also
significantly lower among ERAS target populations after implementation. The rate ratios for
postoperative complications were 0.68 (95% CI, 0.46-0.99; P = .04) for patients undergoing
colorectal resection and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.45-0.99, P = .05) for patients with hip fracture.
Among patients undergoing colorectal resection, ERAS implementation was associated with
decreased rates of hospital mortality (0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.86; P = .03), whereas among
patients with hip fracture, implementation was associated with increased rates of home
discharge (1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.44; P = .007).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Multicenter implementation of an ERAS program among
patients undergoing elective colorectal resection and patients undergoing emergency hip
fracture repair successfully altered processes of care and was associated with significant
absolute and relative decreases in hospital length of stay and postoperative complication
rates. Rapid, large-scale implementation of a multidisciplinary ERAS program is feasible and
effective in improving surgical outcomes.

o Err Is Human, the landmark Institute of Medicine
report1 published in 1999, detailed the substantial toll
that medical errors exact on patients, practitioners, and
the health care system and elevated patient safety to a na-
tional priority. Ensuring patient safety has been particularly
relevant in US surgical care, where more than 50 million in-
patient procedures are performed annually2 and where peri-
operative complications are common and costly.3-11

gery,bundledsurgicalcareapproacheshavebeenproposedthat

been limited by modest sample sizes and relatively few imple-

In this study, we assessed the concurrent implementa-
tion of an ERAS program among patients undergoing elective
colorectal resection and patients undergoing emergency hip
fracture surgery within the Kaiser Permanente Northern Cali-
fornia (KPNC) integrated health care delivery system. We
sought to evaluate how care and patient outcomes changed as
a result of program implementation by comparing process and
outcome measures in the ERAS target populations with those
in similar surgical populations that received usual care be-
fore and after implementation.
Methods
This study was approved by the KPNC Institutional Review
Board with a waiver of informed consent.
The KPNC ERAS Program
Program Design
In 2014, KPNC implemented an ERAS program across 20 hos-
pitals in Northern California that targeted 2 surgical popula-
tions:patientsundergoingelectivecolorectalresectionandpa-
tients undergoing emergency hip fracture repair. Program
design and implementation were led by a regional team com-
posed of multidisciplinary subject matter experts, including
clinicians, performance improvement staff, and patient en-
gagement teams. The KPNC ERAS program aimed to standard-
ize surgical care (Table 1) with a specific focus on 4 core peri-
operative elements: (1) pain management, (2) mobility, (3)
nutrition, and (4) patient engagement. Pain management fo-
cused on opioid-sparing interventions through the use of
multimodal analgesia, which included preoperative and post-
operative intravenous acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory medication, and perioperative intravenous
lidocaine (colorectal) or peripheral nerve blocks (hip frac-
ture). For mobility, ambulatory patients were encouraged to
begin ambulation within 12 hours of surgery completion and
maintain a daily goal of walking at least 21 ft in the first 3 post-
surgical days. Nutrition was enhanced by reducing pro-
longed perioperative surgical fasting through the use of a pre-
operative high-carbohydrate beverage within 2 to 4 hours
and/or solids within 8 to 12 hours before surgery. Postopera-
tive nutrition was provided within 12 hours after surgery. To
improve patient engagement in care, an infographic-based cal-
endar was distributed to patients detailing expected care pro-
cesses starting from the night before surgery through hospi-
tal discharge; an informational video series was also designed
to improve patient education.
Program Implementation
The ERAS program was implemented in a staggered, nonran-
domized fashion across 20 medical centers throughout 2014
(eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement). Two pilot sites were
chosen based on leadership interest, performance improve-
ment expertise, and clinician engagement. Pilot site imple-
mentation was undertaken in February and March 2014, fol-
lowed by secondary site implementation at an additional 6
centers between April and May 2014. In June 2014, a regional
ERAS summit, including more than 400 regional and medi-
cal center staff members, detailed the full implementation ele-
ments and time line, the data analytic strategy and perfor-
mance dashboards, and the patient education materials. All
remaining medical centers implemented the ERAS program in
both target populations by the end of 2014. To support imple-
mentation, new electronic tools were created, including (1) 13
electronic medical record order sets to facilitate standardized
practice and (2) performance dashboards to facilitate low-
latency case review at the patient, pathway, medical center,
and regional levels.
Study Design
We used a pre-post difference-in-differences study design to
comparechangesinpracticesandoutcomesbetweentargetand
comparator groups after implementation of the ERAS pro-
gram. Starting with the ERAS implementation month, stan-
dardized as time zero for each medical center and pathway, we
collected practice and outcomes data from the preceding (pre)
12 months and subsequent (post) 12 months (eFigure in the
Supplement).
Key Points
Question What is the influence of implementation of an
enhanced recovery after surgery program on outcomes among
patients undergoing elective colorectal resection and emergency
hip fracture repair?
Findings In this pre-post difference-in-differences study of 15 849
surgical patients at 20 medical centers in Northern California,
implementation of a multifaceted enhanced recovery program was
associated with a one-third reduction in postoperative
complication rates in the target population relative to comparator
surgical populations. The program was also associated with
decreased hospital mortality among patients undergoing
colorectal resection and increased rates of discharge to home
among patients undergoing hip fracture repair.
Meaning Large-scale implementation of an enhanced recovery
after surgery program significantly improved many processes and
outcomes of surgical care in 2 distinct populations.

 ERAS Target and Comparator Groups
We identified ERAS target patients based on International Clas-
sification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
(ICD-9-CM) hospital and diagnosis procedure codes (eTable 3
intheSupplement).Weidentifiedinpatientcomparatorgroups
undergoing similar surgical procedures within their first 3 days
of hospital admission using ICD-9-CM procedure codes and
Clinical Classification Software procedure level 2 categories
(eTable 4 in the Supplement). For patients undergoing elec-
tive colorectal resection, comparator patients included those
not admitted through the emergency department who also un-
derwent gastrointestinal surgery. For patients undergoing
emergency hip fracture repair, comparator patients included
those admitted through the emergency department who un-
derwent orthopedic surgery.
Hospitalization Data
We linked ERAS target and comparator patients with existing
hospitalization data to include validated risk scores quantify-
ing acute severity of illness at hospital admission (Laboratory
and Acute Physiology Score, version 2) and comorbid disease
burden (Comorbidity Point Score, version 2).22-24 We also iden-
tified patients admitted directly to the intensive care unit
because patients requiring critical care have higher rates of ad-
verse outcomes. We determined hospital death, length of stay,
discharge disposition, and 30-day readmission based on
previously described methods.22-26
Process of Care Metrics
We selected 3 process of care metrics within each ERAS peri-
operative care element, excluding patient engagement, in our
analysis. For mobility, we evaluated (1) ambulation within 12
hours of surgery (early ambulation), (2) ambulation of 21 ft or
more in the first 3 postoperative days (sustained ambula-
tion), and (3) the elapsed time from surgery to first ambula-
tion (time to ambulation). For nutrition, we evaluated (1) the
provision of solids and/or liquids in the preoperative period
(no prolonged fast), (2) the provision of postoperative oral nu-
trition within 12 hours of surgery (early nutrition), and (3) the
elapsed hours from surgery to first nutrition (time to nutri-
tion). For pain management and sedation, we evaluated (1) the
use of any benzodiazepines in the first 3 postoperative days
(benzodiazepine use), (2) the total intravenous morphine-
equivalent dosage of opioid medication administered from
hospitalization through the third postoperative day (opioid
use),and(3)theproportionoftimeinwhichpatientsratedtheir
current pain as acceptable (acceptable pain scores). We quan-
tified these metrics based on medication administration
records, preoperative checklists, and/or nursing shift assess-
ments recorded in the electronic medical record.
Outcome Metrics
Ourprimaryoutcomemetricwashospitallengthofstay.Oursec-
ondary outcomes included hospital mortality, discharge to
home, and 30-day readmission. We evaluated surgical compli-
cation data, available for a subsample of patients (eTable 5 in
the Supplement), based on data abstracted manually accord-
ingtoNationalSurgicalQualityImprovementProgram(NSQIP)
guidelines and procedures.3 We quantified surgical complica-
tions based on NSQIP categories. The NSQIP data abstraction
was regionalized in January 2014 along with a decision to stan-
dardize the NSQIP participation model to multispecialty or tar-
get the model for all medical centers, preferentially targeting
patients undergoing colorectal and hip fracture surgery. In a
post hoc analysis, we evaluated major complication rates,
which included septic shock, myocardial infarction, stroke,
cardiac arrest, progressive kidney injury or renal failure,
respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and
venous thromboembolic disease.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean (SD), median (interquartile range),
and number (percentage). Unadjusted comparisons between
groups are based on unpaired, 2-tailed t tests, Wilcoxon rank
sum tests, or Ï2 tests.

 Process Measure Rate Ratios
To evaluate the comparative effect of implementation on pro-
cess metrics after ERAS care vs usual care, we used general-
ized linear models to estimate the rate ratios for each metric,
including a preperiod vs postperiod indicator flag, an ERAS vs
comparator group indicator flag, and the interaction between
the period and ERAS indicators. We reported rate ratios based
on the interaction term indicating the postimplementation pe-
riod among the ERAS-targeted group. For binary values, we
used a Poisson distribution with a log-link function, whereas
for continuous values, we used a gaussian distribution with a
log-linkfunction,bothwithrobustSEs.Weusedthesamemod-
els in an interrupted time-series approach to evaluate the
monthly rates of process metric change between ERAS and
comparator groups.
Outcome Measure Rate Ratios
To estimate rate ratios for the outcome metrics, we used gen-
eralized linear models while also including age, severity of ill-
ness at admission metrics (Laboratory and Acute Physiology
Score, version 2, and Comorbidity Point Score, version 2), and
direct admission to the intensive care unit as fixed effects and
facility as a random effect. We considered 2-sided P â¤ .05 to
be statistically significant. All analyses were performed in
STATA/SE, version 14.1 (StataCorp).
Results
ERAS Cohorts
The study included a total of 3768 patients undergoing elec-
tive colorectal resection (mean [SD] age, 62.7 [14.1] years; 1812
[48.1%] male) and 5002 patients undergoing emergency hip
fracture repair (mean [SD] age, 79.5 [11.8] years; 1586 [31.7%]
male) (Table 2). Mean severity of illness and comorbid
disease burden was higher among patients undergoing emer-
gency hip fracture repair than among those undergoing elec-
tive colorectal resection.
ERAS Process and Outcome Metrics
Most process metrics among ERAS patients demonstrated
significant changes between the preimplementation and post-
implementation phases (Table 3). The rate of early ambula-
tion increased from 22.3% to 56.5% (P < .001) among pa-
tients undergoing elective colorectal resection and from 2.8%
to 21.2% (P < .001) among patients undergoing hip fracture re-
pair. Similarly, the use of early nutrition increased from 13.0%
to 39.2% in patients undergoing elective colorectal resection
and from 45.6% to 57.1% in patients undergoing hip fracture
repair (P < .001). The total dose of morphine equivalents also
decreased significantly in both groups (52.4 vs 30.6 mg in the
colorectal resection group and 38.9 vs 27.0 mg in the hip
fracture group; P < .001). Hospital length of stay decreased
significantly in both ERAS groups (5.1 to 4.2 days in the colo-
rectal resection group and 3.6 to 3.2 days in the hip fracture
group; P < .001), whereas postoperative complication rates de-
creased from 18.1% to 14.7% (P = .02) in patients undergoing
elective colorectal resection and from 30.8% to 24.9%
(P = .003) in patients undergoing hip fracture repair.
Comparator Groups
We identified 5556 patients for the colorectal resection com-
parator group and 1523 patients for the hip fracture repair com-
parator group (eTable 6 in the Supplement). Among the com-
parator group patients, many process metrics also changed
significantly between the preimplementation and postimple-
mentation phases, albeit more modestly (eTable 7 in the
Supplement). The Figure shows the comparative attainment
of process metrics between the ERAS target populations and
their comparators and several patterns indicated by esti-
mates from interrupted time-series analyses (eTable 8 in the
Supplement), including similar changes over time (eg, benzo-
diazepine use in both groups), frameshifts after ERAS imple-
mentationthatresultedinsimilarlevelsofattainment(eg,early
ambulation in both groups), and frameshifts after implemen-
tation that resulted in differing levels of metric attainment (eg,
early nutrition and no prolonged fasting among patients un-
dergoing colorectal resection).
Rate Ratios
We found favorable rate ratios in most process metrics among
ERAS target populations compared with their respective com-
parator groups (eTable 9 in the Supplement). For example,
ERAS implementation was associated with a significantly

pitalmortality(0.17;95%CI,0.03-0.86;P = .03)andmajorcom-
plications (0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.68; P = .005). Among pa-
tients undergoing hip fracture repair, implementation was
associated with an increased rate of discharge to home (1.24;
95% CI, 1.06-1.44; P = .007). In neither patients undergoing
colorectal resection (0.94; 95% CI, 0.74-1.20; P = .65) nor pa-
tients undergoing hip fracture repair (0.96; 95% CI, 0.74-
1.26; P = .78) was ERAS implementation associated with rela-
tive differences in the rate of 30-day readmission.
Discussion
System-level implementation of an ERAS program resulted in
significant practice changes across a heterogeneous set of pa-
tients, clinicians, and hospitals. Compared with other surgi-
cal populations treated at the same hospitals over identical pe-
riods, ERAS-driven practice changes were associated with
significantlydecreasedhospitallengthofstayandratesofpost-
operative complications. In patients undergoing elective co-
lorectal resection, program implementation was associated
with decreased surgical mortality and major complications. In
patients undergoing emergency hip fracture repair, imple-
mentation was associated with improved rates of discharge to
home.
Most prior studies12,14-18,27 that evaluated ERAS imple-
mentation have included patients undergoing colorectal sur-
gery. A Cochrane systematic review12 of ERAS in 2011 identi-
fied4randomizedclinicaltrialsincludingatotalof237patients
who met the review criteria. Similar to our results, length of
stayandoverallcomplicationratesdecreasedwithERASimple-
mentationwithoutsignificantdifferencesinreadmissionrates.
A more recent meta-analysis by Greco et al14 identified 16 trials
that enrolled a total of 2376 patients and reported a signifi-
cant reduction in length of stay and nonsurgical complica-
tion rates without an accompanying difference in readmis-
sion rates. Although these prior studies12,14-18,27 are broadly
consistent with our findings, we also identified a significant
reduction in hospital mortality after ERAS implementation in
our population undergoing elective colorectal resection.
Considerably fewer studies have robustly evaluated ERAS
implementation outside colorectal surgery. A meta-analysis28
of ERAS programs in several surgical domains that included
38 trials and 5099 patients found significant reductions in
length of stay and 30-day complication rates, without signifi-
cant differences in mortality or readmission. Of these trials,
only 3 included patients undergoing lower extremity joint
replacement. Macfie et al29 evaluated 232 patients with fem-
oral neck fractures and found that an ERAS program reduced
postoperative complications without significant differences in
mortality or length of stay. With a pre-post study design, Ped-
ersen et al30 reported significant reductions in inpatient com-
plication rates with a significant reduction in hospital mortal-
ityamongcommunity-dwellingpatients.Weidentifiedasimilar
reduction in complication rates along with a modest reduc-
tion in length of stay.
Strengths and Limitations
This study has several strengths compared with prior stud-
ies. First, we evaluated 2 heterogeneous surgical populations
to assess for similar and differential effects of implementa-
tion.Patientsundergoingcolorectalresectionwereyoungerand
healthierthanpatientsundergoinghipfracturerepair;theyalso
underwent elective procedures. Before implementation, their
care processes differed as well. For example, the rates of early
ambulation were much higher among the patients undergo-
ing colorectal resection, whereas the rates of postoperative nu-
trition were much higher among patients undergoing hip frac-
ture repair. Despite these substantial differences in baseline
patient and care characteristics, the effect of program imple-
mentation on complications was a similar one-third relative
decrease in complication rates; length of stay also decreased
in both groups. Most prior studies12-15,18-21 have been limited
to more homogeneous target populations. This study demon-
strates the effectiveness of a systems-level approach to ERAS
program implementation even across widely divergent tar-
get populations.
Second, we included contemporaneous comparator pa-
tients to isolate the effect of program implementation rather
than effects that arise from secular change in surgical prac-
tice. Despite the fact that comparator patients were treated by
thesamesurgicalteamsandexperiencedsomemodestchanges
in process metrics, their outcomes were largely unchanged be-
foreandafterimplementation,strengtheningtheassertionthat
thechangesinoutcomesinthetargetpopulationsresultedfrom
the implementation of the ERAS program itself. Most prior
multicenter studies14,18 have not used contemporaneous
comparator groups, limiting their study conclusions because
of inherent limitations of standard pre-post study designs.

 Third, prior studies12,20 have had limited ability to evalu-
ate program implementation at scale in real-world settings.
During a 2-year period, we were able to evaluate care patterns
in more than 15 000 surgical patients. Program implementa-
tion affected the practice of thousands of clinicians and oc-
curred in a diverse set of hospitals that differ significantly in
size,patientcasemix,teachingstatus,geographiclocation,and
on-site specialty service availability, strengthening the gen-
eralizability of our findings. Our study was aided by evaluat-
ing electronic medical recordâbased metrics that were al-
ready used by clinicians, allowing us to precisely quantify a
large panel of performance measures populated during rou-
tine care delivery. Thus, we were able to demonstrate the fea-
sibility of large-scale ERAS program implementation during a
relatively short interval.
The study also has important limitations. First, the evalu-
ation was not a randomized clinical trial, and the program roll-
out was not randomized by site. Thus, the results may be af-
fected by residual confounding and baseline differences in
intervention and usual care patients. Our comparator groups
also underwent different surgical procedures than the target
populations, limiting our ability to directly compare 2 identi-
cal groups. Second, we did not have standardized and vali-
dated complications data on all patients; there was also an im-
balance in the acquisition of these data over time and between
the target and comparator groups. Because of the size and
speed of the implementation effort, program resources were
not available to perform data abstraction for every surgical
patient. Third, as a highly integrated health care delivery
system, the KPNC may differ from other health care systems
in the United States. Thus, implementation and results
may vary depending on the particular model of surgical
practice and performance improvement method. Fourth, our
study evaluated short-term outcomes; future studies are nec-
essary to evaluate the effect of enhanced recovery on longer-
term outcomes, especially functional and cognitive ability af-
ter surgery.
Conclusions
Implementation of the ERAS program successfully altered the
process-of-caremetricsforpatientsundergoingemergencyhip
fracture repair and patients undergoing elective colorectal re-
section across 20 hospitals. In this study of more than 15 000
surgicalpatients,programimplementationwasassociatedwith
significant absolute and relative improvements in hospital
length of stay and surgical complication rates.
