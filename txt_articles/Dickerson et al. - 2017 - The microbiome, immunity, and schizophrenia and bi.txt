Abstract
Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are serious neuropsychiatric disorders of uncertain etiology. 
Recent studies indicate that immune activation may contribute to the etiopathogenesis of these 
disorders. Numerous studies in animal models indicate that the mucosal microbiome may 
influence cognition and behavior by altering the functioning of the immune system. It is thus 
likely that the microbiome plays a role in human psychiatric disorders. The study of immune 
alterations and the microbiome in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is in its infancy. Two recent 
investigations of the oro-pharyngeal microbiota in schizophrenia found differences between cases 
and controls. Other studies have found increased gastrointestinal inflammation in schizophrenia 
and bipolar disorder based on measures of microbial translocation. Several studies have also found 
an association between the receipt of antibiotics and an increased incidence of psychiatric 
disorders, perhaps due to alterations in the microbiome. Studies to characterize the intestinal 
microbiome of individuals with these disorders are in progress. The ultimate test of the role of the 
microbiome and immune-mediated pathology in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder will come 
from clinical trials of therapeutic agents which alter gut microbiota or gastrointestinal 
inflammation. The successful development of such modalities would represent a novel strategy to 
prevent and treat serious psychiatric disorders.

1. Introduction
Schizophrenia is a neuropsychiatric disorder with an onset typically in adolescence or young 
adulthood and a course which usually persists throughout the lifespan. Characteristic 
symptoms include hallucinations and delusions as well as apathy and social withdrawal; 
many affected individuals also have reduced cognitive abilities and impaired social

 functioning. Because the disorder disrupts multiple life domains and typically persists for 
decades, the global burden of disease is high (Whiteford, Ferrari, Degenhardt, Feigin, & Vos, 
2015). Bipolar disorder is another serious mental illness and shares many features with 
schizophrenia including some of the characteristic symptoms and the lifelong course.
(Dacquino, De Rossi, & Spalletta, 2015; Jobe & Harrow, 2005). Both disorders are 
categorized by their phenotypic features rather than any biological markers and their 
etiology is not fully understood. Genome-wide association studies show a great deal of 
genetic overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Lichtenstein et al., 2009; Van 
Snellenberg & de Candia, 2009) However, while genetic factors are involved in both 
disorders, risk genes which have been identified account for a small portion of disease risk. 
For example, a recent genome wide study in schizophrenia found 108 independent loci that 
account for approximately 7% of the risk of developing schizophrenia from polygenic 
scores, (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014) Of 
note, many of the genetic loci that were identified are known to modulate inflammation and 
the immune response.
Previous studies have demonstrated that both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are 
associated with alterations of the systemic immune system including low-grade chronic 
inflammation (increased plasma cytokines, soluble cytokine receptors, chemokines, acute 
phase reactants) and T-cell activation features; these findings are delineated in previously-
published review articles(Anderson & Maes, 2015).(Rosenblat, Cha, Mansur, & McIntyre, 
2014) (Leboyer et al., 2016). The immune system provides a two way communication 
pathway between the gut and the brain via the vagus nerve, short chain fatty acids, and a 
number of soluble mediators(Erny, de Angelis, & Prinz, 2016; Hyland & Cryan, 2016; 
Levite, 2016; Sherwin, Sandhu, Dinan, & Cryan, 2016). It has been established that the gut 
microbiota can influence brain function and thus may play a role in diseases such as 
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder which are traditionally seen as brain-based (Fond et al., 
2015).
The study of the microbiome is relatively new and most of the investigations to date have 
taken place in animal models. Multiple studies have documented an interaction between the 
gut microbiome, immunity, cognitive functioning and behavior in a number of models, most 
of which involve rodents (Desbonnet et al., 2015). Studies linking these findings to human 
psychiatric disorders are more limited.
2. Scope of review
The purpose of this article is to summarize what is known about immune alterations and the 
microbiome based on human studies in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This field of 
inquiry is still in its infancy and the number of studies to date is small. However, the 
groundwork is being laid to better understand immune abnormalities which contribute to the 
etiology of these major psychiatric disorders and to identify how knowledge of the 
microbiome might result in novel methods for the treatment of these disorders.

 3. Results
Research about immune alterations and the microbiome in schizophrenia and bipolar 
disorder falls into several categories as described below.
3.1. Studies of the oropharyngeal microbiota in schizophrenia
There have been numerous studies of the fecal microbiome in otherwise healthy children 
and adults (Collado, Rautava, Isolauri, & Salminen, 2015; Lozupone, Stombaugh, Gordon, 
Jansson, & Knight, 2012). However the collection and prompt processing of fecal samples 
from individuals with severe psychiatric disorders is problematic. Published studies 
analyzing the fecal microbiome of individuals with schizophrenia are currently lacking. The 
oropharyngeal microbiome can be assessed from throat swab samples which are more easily 
accessed than samples from the gastrointestinal tract and thus allow potentially for larger 
sample sizes. Furthermore, while there are many differences in the microbial composition of 
the fecal and oral microbiome, some studies have documented overlapping metabolic 
pathways in the different sites (Segata et al., 2012). For this reason many of the studies in 
our population have focused on the oral microbiome. Furthermore, we have relied on 
metagenomic sequencing rather than the commonly used 16S sequencing since studies have 
documented a role for viruses (Houenou et al., 2014), fungi(Severance et al, 2016) and 
protozoa (Torrey, Bartko, & Yolken, 2012) in the pathogenesis of the psychiatric disorders.
A meta-genomic analysis of the oropharyngeal microbiome in 16 adults with schizophrenia 
and 16 non-psychiatric controls found differences at both the phylum and the genus levels.
(Castro-Nallar et al., 2015) At the phylum level, schizophrenia samples exhibited higher 
proportions of Firmicutes across samples in comparison to controls; in the controls a higher 
relative proportion of Badteroidetes and Actinobacteria was observed. Regarding species 
diversity, controls were richer in the number of species compared to schizophrenia samples 
but less even in their distribution (Figure 1).
Out of a total of 25 differentially abundant species (bacteria and fungi), 6 microbial species 
were more abundant in cases than controls after adjusting for relevant covariates. Lactic acid 
bacteria were relatively more abundant in schizophrenia including Lactobacillus and 
Bifidobacterium with the largest effect found in Lactobacillus gasseri which appeared to be 
at least 400 times more abundant in schizophrenia patients than in controls. The study also 
found that 18 metabolic pathways that were enriched and 14 decreased in schizophrenia 
relative to controls. Pathways that were significantly altered in schizophrenia were related to 
environmental information processes such as saccharide, polio, and lipid transport systems 
(Figure 2).
Another study of the oropharyngeal microbiome focused on bacteriophages, viruses that 
infect bacteria and alter their metabolism and replication, in samples from 41 adults with 
schizophrenia and 33 non-psychiatric controls.(R. H. Yolken et al., 2015) Of the 79 distinct 
bacteriophage samples that were identified, one, Lactobacillus phage phiadh, was 
significantly more abundant in schizophrenia cases than in controls after adjustment for 
multiple comparisons and demographic covariates (Figure 3). Interestingly the group

 differences were larger for the phage than for its host bacteria underscoring the importance 
of examining viral sequences in studies of the microbiome relating to psychiatric disorders.
Within the schizophrenia group, the level of this phage was significantly associated with the 
presence of immunological disorders such as diabetes, which are common co-morbid 
conditions in individuals with schizophrenia (Schoepf, Uppal, Potluri, & Heun, 2014). The 
level of Lactobacillus phage phiadh was also relatively increased in individuals who were 
being treated with therapeutic valproate, a medication commonly used for the adjunctive 
treatment of schizophrenia (Tseng et al., 2016). This finding is of interest since valproate has 
been shown to modify the microbiome in mouse models of autism in the context of in utero 
exposure, probably related to us homology with short chain fatty acids(de Theije et al., 
2014)). This finding is of note since the mechanisms by which valproate improves the 
symptoms in some individuals with schizophrenia was not previously known. This finding 
suggests that other molecules which alter the microbiome may be found that are effective as 
adjunct therapies for schizophrenia, including ones with less toxicity than valproate 
(Haddad, Das, Ashfaq, & Wieck, 2009).
3.2. Studies of intestinal inflammation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
Gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies are long-standing comorbidities of psychiatric disorders, 
supporting the centuries old hypotheses that gut and brain physiologies are inter-dependent 
(Severance, Prandovszky, Castiglione, & Yolken, 2015). In schizophrenia and bipolar 
disorder, a low-grade inflammatory state is prevalent in a subset of individuals (Bechter, 
2013; Fillman, Sinclair, Fung, Webster, & Shannon Weickert, 2014; Miller, Buckley, 
Seabolt, Mellor, & Kirkpatrick, 2011) The origin of this inflammation is not currently well 
understood, but recent as well as older studies suggest that it stems from processes related to 
dysbiosis of the gut microbiome. This dysbiosis provides a mechanism to generate a GI-
based inflammatory state through the process of microbial translocation of gut microbes into 
systemic circulation.
One of the earliest specific documentations of GI inflammation associated with 
schizophrenia was a post-mortem study of 82 individuals with schizophrenia, where 
researchers found that 50% had gastritis, 88% enteritis and 92% colitis.(Buscaino, 1953) 
Interestingly, a converse phenomenon also holds true with reports of psychiatric 
comorbidities in people with intestinal disorders which have an inflammatory component. 
Prevalence estimates for any psychiatric comorbidity in patients diagnosed with irritable 
bowel syndrome (IBS), for example, range from 54–94% (Whitehead, Palsson, & Jones, 
2002), and specifically estimates for a schizophrenia comorbidity approach 20%(Gupta, 
Masand, Kaplan, Bhandary, & Hendricks, 1997). In a large-scale case-control cohort of 
4689 IBS patients and 18756 matched controls without IBS, a diagnosis of IBS increased the 
risk for anxiety and mood disorders as well (Lee et al., 2015). Collectively, these 
epidemiological studies illustrate that GI inflammation and psychiatric disorders are 
connected. However the delineation of the magnitude of the correlation is limited by the 
difficulty in making an accurate diagnosis of intestinal diseases in individuals with 
psychiatric symptoms and the possible confounding effects of medications.

 Numerous biological indices corroborate a role for GI inflammation in schizophrenia and 
bipolar disorder pathophysiology. GI-derived inflammation is often measured based on 
biomarkers of the microbial translocation process. The panel of markers used to diagnose 
Crohn’s Disease for example includes detection of antibodies to the yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, an organism that is part of the normal human gut microbiome (Desplat-Jego et 
al., 2007) The presence of antibodies to this yeast indicates that an immune response has 
been generated against the organism presumably due to its presence at a potentially 
compromised gut mucosa-blood vasculature interface. Elevated antibodies to S. cerevisiae 
were found in individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and these levels were 
particularly increased in individuals experiencing a recent onset of their disorder (Severance 
et al., 2012; Severance, Gressitt, et al., 2014). Furthermore, antibody levels were 
significantly higher in those with schizophrenia who were antipsychotic-naïve than in those 
who were medicated suggesting that the relationship between these disorders and 
gastrointestinal inflammation cannot be attributed solely to the effect of antipsychotic 
medications. In a follow-up study of a different commensal yeast species, Candida albicans, 
antibody levels were not only significantly increased in subsets of individuals with 
schizophrenia, but were particularly elevated in those who had GI symptoms(Severance, 
Gressitt, et al., 2016). In a similar investigation, markers of bacterial translocation were 
altered in individuals with schizophrenia and to a certain degree bipolar disorder (Severance 
et al., 2013).
The theme for translocation of microbial components into circulation via a breached gut 
barrier can be expanded to include other GI-derived substances such as digested foods. 
There is a long literature on the anti-milk casein and anti-wheat gluten immune response 
associated with schizophrenia and a sensitivity to these foods is known to also generate an 
inflammatory response in the intestinal tract (Severance, Yolken, & Eaton, 2014). Finally, 
exposure to the neurotropic protozoan pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, is a well-studied risk 
factor for the development of schizophrenia(Torrey et al., 2012). Interestingly, T. gondii 
enters and establishes itself in its host via the intestinal tract and is used in experimental 
animal models to generate intestinal disorders associated with inflammatory processes 
(Bereswill et al., 2010). In human studies, antibodies to this parasite were significantly 
associated with markers of food sensitivity in those with schizophrenia (Severance et al., 
2012). Thus, it cannot be ruled out that the association of exposure to this parasite with 
psychiatric disorders may be a function of its pathological effects in the gut.
3.3. Study of bacterial infections and antimicrobial agents in acute mania
Bacterial infections are a source of immune activation and have been shown to be a risk 
factor for the subsequent development of schizophrenia and mood disorders(Benros, 
Mortensen, & Eaton, 2012; Benros et al., 2013; Nielsen, Benros, & Mortensen, 2013) 
Consistent with some previous population-based studies (Kohler et al., 2014), a recent study 
employed the prescription of antibiotic agents as a measure of bacterial infections. The study 
population consisted of 234 individuals hospitalized for acute mania, most diagnosed with 
bipolar disorder, in either an inpatient unit or a day hospital and also individuals hospitalized 
for schizophrenia, bipolar depression, major depression, as well as non-psychiatric 
controls(R. Yolken et al., 2016). The study found that in patients with acute mania, but not

 those hospitalized for the other conditions, had a substantially increased rate of recent 
antimicrobial prescription when adjusting for demographic variables. Within the mania 
group, the prescription of antibiotics was associated with having increased mania symptom 
severity but not with other clinical ratings. The urinary tract was the most common site of 
infection in women while the respiratory tract and mucosal surfaces were the most common 
sites in men. An association between antibiotic exposure and mood disorder has also been 
found in population based studies performed in the United Kingdom (Lurie, Yang, Haynes, 
Mamtani, & Boursi, 2015) and Denmark (Kohler et al., 2016).
There are several mechanisms by which antibiotic usage might be associated with episodes 
of acute mania. One possibility is that the underlying bacterial infections responsible for the 
antibiotic prescriptions result in immune activation which then leads to the onset of mania. A 
second possibility is that the higher rate of presumed bacterial infections in individuals with 
mania is reflective of decreased levels of ability of the immune system to prevent infections 
in this population. A third possibility is that the administration of antibiotics can result in 
changes in the microbiome which themselves increased the risk of altered mood states. This 
finding is consistent with a number of studies in animal models linking the microbiome to 
altered behavior and cognition. However, the possible role of alterations in the microbiome 
in the onset of mania in this study population was rendered less likely by the fact that, in 
many cases, antibiotics were not administered to patients until after they had been admitted 
to the hospital. However, the possibility that the microbiome may have been altered in these 
individuals by past administration of antibiotics cannot be excluded. It is of note that these 
proposed mechanisms of action are not mutually exclusive but might be interacting in 
different degrees to result in mania or other psychiatric symptoms in different individuals.
3.4. Trials of probiotic compounds in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
Another research strategy to probe the role of the microbiome in schizophrenia and bipolar 
disorder involves clinical trials with compounds that may alter the gut microbiome and 
modulate the immune response and thus potentially have an effect on psychiatric illness 
symptoms. Probiotic compounds provide a safe and well tolerated means for the modulation 
of the immune response to harmful antigens such as food-derived proteins. Probiotics have 
been studied in animal models and have shown benefits in trials of individuals with some 
gastrointestinal disorders and allergic conditions (De Angelis et al., 2006; Guerra et al., 
2011; Saulnier, Kolida, & Gibson, 2009).
One of the first trials of probiotic compounds in schizophrenia involved an add-on probiotic 
compound (combined Lactobacillus rhammosus strain GG and Bifidobacterium animals 
subsp. Lactis strain Bb12 (F. B. Dickerson et al., 2014). Results showed no significant 
difference in psychiatric symptom severity between probiotic and placebo supplementation 
at the end of the trial thought those patients who received the probiotic compound vs. the 
placebo were less likely to develop severe bowel difficulty over the course of the trial, 
consistent with an effect of probiotics on the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the probiotic 
supplementation did significantly alter the levels of several serum proteins assessed before 
and after the trial including von Willebrand factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(Tomasik, Yolken, Bahn, & Dickerson, 2015). Probiotic treatment also lowered the level of

 antibodies to the fungus Candida albicans and associated gastrointestinal symptoms in male 
individuals in the trial (Severance, Gressit, et al., 2016).
Another trial of probiotic supplementation is underway in psychiatric patients, this one in 
mania. This trial is based on a longitudinal observational study of individuals with acute 
mania, which found that levels of immune makers, IgG antibodies to gliadin, a measure of 
gluten sensitivity and levels of antibodies to the NR2 peptide of the NMDA receptor, were 
significantly increased during the acute manic episode but did not differ from the levels of 
controls at a 6 month follow up(F. Dickerson, Stallings, Origoni, et al., 2012; F. Dickerson, 
Stallings, Vaughan, et al., 2012) (F. Dickerson et al., 2013) In addition, a combined 
inflammation score, calculated by factor analysis of the levels of class specific antibodies to 
the NR peptide of the NMDA receptor, gliadin, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus protein 24, and 
Toxoplasma gondii, differed from the controls during the acute episode but not at the 6 
month follow up(F. Dickerson et al., 2013). In addition, within the mania group, an elevated 
inflammation score during the acute episode predicted rehospitalization for a new mood 
episode during the follow-up period. Clinical trials of therapeutic agents which alter gut 
microbiota or gastrointestinal inflammation will be the ultimate test of the role of the 
microbiome and immune-mediated pathology in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
4. Limitations in Current Knowledge
There are a number of limitations in the current state of knowledge regarding the role of the 
microbiome in etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These include the 
following
1.
There are as yet no published descriptions of the fecal or intestinal microbiome 
of individuals with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. This limitation is 
undoubtedly related to the difficulty of obtaining relevant sample in this study 
population. Of particular importance in this regard would be longitudinal studies 
in which changes in the fecal or intestine microbiome could be studies over time. 
Such studies could also address the effects of environmental factors such as 
medications (Bahra et al., 2015), hospitalization, cigarette smoking and living 
conditions on the composition of the microbiome. Since there are also 
differences in the microbiome at different levels of the human gastrointestinal 
tract, studies of the microbial composition of the small bowel and colon in 
individuals with psychiatric disorders might provide information supplementary 
to that obtained from analyses of fecal samples in this population.
2.
It is not known whether changes in the microbiota associated with schizophrenia 
and bipolar disorder are state or trait related and how the microbiome may be 
involved in mood switching in bipolar disorder and in psychotic exacerbations in 
schizophrenia.
3.
Animal studies directed specifically at models of serious psychiatric disorders 
are limited. Of particular importance would be the interaction of immune related 
risk genes such as those involved in the complement system (Xiao et al., 2016) 
with the composition of the microbiome. Animal models would also be useful to 
Dickerson et al.

 better define the effects of psychiatric medications on the composition of the 
microbiome in terms of both psychiatric activity and side effects such as weigh 
gain (Bahr et al., 2015).
Conclusions and Perspectives
Studies to date indicate a role for the microbiome in the etiopathogenesis of serious human 
psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While animal models focus 
on the bacterial composition of the intestinal tract, studies to date in individuals with 
psychiatric disorders also point to the possible role of viruses and fungi as well as the 
involvement of other mucosal body sites such as the nasopharynx. Critical research needs 
include prospective studies to define risk prior to the onset of therapeutic interventions as 
well as methods for the accurate assessment of the microbiome at different mucosal sites in 
a practical manner. There is also a need for effective modalities for the modulation of the 
microbiome and the control of inflammation in a population of individuals who are taking a 
range of psychiatric medications. Despite these limitations the analysis of the microbiome in 
individuals with psychiatric disorders and the development of methods for its modulation 
offer great promise in terms of developing new methods for the prevention and treatment of 
these devastating disorders.
