Abstract 
This study examined effects of four weeks of caffeine supplementation on endurance 
performance. Eighteen low-habitual caffeine consumers (<75 mg·day−1) were 
randomly assigned to ingest caffeine (1.5 – 3.0 mg·kg−1day−1; titrated) or placebo for 
28 days. Groups were matched for age, body mass, V
̇ O2peak and Wmax (P>0.05). 
Before supplementation, all participants completed one V
̇ O2peak test, one practice trial 
and two experimental trials (acute 3 mg·kg−1 caffeine [precaf] and placebo [testpla]). 
During the supplementation period a second V
̇ O2peak test was completed on day 21 
before a final, acute 3 mg·kg−1 caffeine trial (postcaf) on day 29. Trials consisted of 
60 min cycle exercise at 60% V
̇ O2peak followed by a 30 min performance task. All 
participants produced more external work during the precaf trial than testpla, with 
increases in the caffeine (383.3 ±75 kJ vs. 344.9 ± 80.3 kJ; Cohen’s d effect size [ES] 
=0.49; P=0.001) and placebo (354.5 ± 55.2 kJ vs. 333.1 ± 56.4 kJ; ES=0.38; 
P=0.004) supplementation group, respectively. This performance benefit was no 
longer apparent after four weeks of caffeine supplementation (precaf: 383.3 ± 75.0 
kJ vs. postcaf: 358.0 ± 89.8 kJ; ES=0.31; P=0.025), but was retained in the placebo 
group (precaf: 354.5 ± 55.2 kJ vs. postcaf: 351.8 ± 49.4 kJ; ES=0.05; P>0.05). 
Circulating caffeine, hormonal concentrations and substrate oxidation did not differ 
between groups (all P>0.05). Chronic ingestion of a low dose of caffeine develops 
tolerance in low-caffeine consumers. Therefore, individuals with low-habitual intakes 
should refrain from chronic caffeine supplementation to maximise performance 
benefits from acute caffeine ingestion.

Introduction 
1 
Acute caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) supplementation approximately one hour 
2 
before exercise improves endurance performance in laboratory-based studies (Burke, 
3 
2008). The same occurs in the field (Berglund & Hemmingsson, 1982), leading to its 
4 
widespread use by athletes during competition (Desbrow & Leveritt, 2006). To 
5 
determine optimum conditions by which caffeine improves performance, factors such 
6 
as dose (Desbrow et al., 2012), source (Hodgson, Randell, & Jeukendrup, 2013), 
7 
and the timing of intake (Cox et al., 2002) have been investigated. However, 
8 
habituation to chronic caffeine intake has received less attention (Bell & McLellan, 
9 
2002). This is important from a practical standpoint given the high prevalence of daily 
10 
caffeine intake in the general population (Fitt, Pell, & Cole, 2013) and by athletes 
11 
during competition (Desbrow & Leveritt, 2006).   
12 
Caffeine probably improves exercise performance through its role as a non-selective 
13 
adenosine receptor antagonist (Fredholm, Bättig, Holmén, Nehlig, & Zvartau, 1999). 
14 
A prominent role for the adenosine A1 receptor in mediating the acute performance 
15 
enhancing effects of caffeine has been demonstrated (Snyder, Katims, Annau, Bruns, 
16 
& Daly, 1981). However, more recent studies with adenosine A2A receptor knockout 
17 
mice confirmed that central blockade of this adenosine receptor isoform is largely 
18 
responsible for the performance enhancing properties of the drug (El Yacoubi et al., 
19 
2000). Chronic caffeine intake influences the concentration of A1 and A2A receptors in 
20 
several brain regions (Svenningsson, Nomikos, & Fredholm, 1999; Johansson et al., 
21 
1993). This includes A2A expression in the striatum (Svenningsson et al., 1999), a 
22 
sub-cortical region essential for coordinating voluntary actions (Tepper, Wilson, & 
23 
Koós, 2008). Therefore it is possible that habituation influences performance benefits 
24 
typical of acute caffeine supplementation. Data from animal studies support this 
25 
 4 
 
hypothesis, as chronic exposure to caffeine in the drinking water of rats resulted in 
26 
tolerance to the performance benefit of a subsequent acute caffeine dose (Karcz-
27 
Kubicha et al., 2003). Although these findings have been confirmed in other animal 
28 
models (Quarta et al., 2004), the doses administered have been large (i.e. 130 
29 
mg·kg·day−1) and much greater than those typically consumed by the general 
30 
population (Fitt et al., 2013). Whether the same tolerance develops after habituation 
31 
to doses typically consumed by the general population is not clear. 
32 
The magnitude of performance benefit after an acute 5 mg·kg−1 caffeine dose was 
33 
less pronounced in individuals already habituated to caffeine (>300 mg·day−1) than 
34 
their caffeine-naive counterparts (Bell & McLellan, 2002). Similar metabolic 
35 
responses have occurred after an acute caffeine dose in comparisons of low-and 
36 
high-habitual caffeine users (Bangsbo, Jacobsen, Nordberg, Christensen, & Graham, 
37 
1992). However, sub-chronic intake (5 days) both of low (3 mg·kg−1) and moderate 
38 
(6 mg·kg−1) caffeine doses did not influence thermoregulatory or cardiovascular 
39 
responses during exercise in the heat (Roti et al., 2006). Furthermore, time-trial 
40 
performance was similar when individuals received an acute 3 mg·kg−1 caffeine dose 
41 
subsequent to either a four-day habituation (3 mg·kg−1day−1) or withdrawal period 
42 
(Irwin et al., 2011). These data suggest that a greater duration of supplementation is 
43 
required before the performance benefit of an acute caffeine dose becomes 
44 
compromised. To date, no study has systematically evaluated a prolonged period of 
45 
controlled caffeine intake and its influence on endurance performance. Hence, the 
46 
aim of this study was to examine the effect of a four-week period of controlled 
47 
caffeine supplementation on endurance performance.

Methods  
50 
Participants 
51 
Eighteen healthy, recreationally active men (age: 21.2 ± 1.8 y; body mass: 74.1 ± 8.6 
52 
kg; stature: 1.75 ± 0.06 m; V
̇ O2peak: 51.4 ± 8.7 ml·kg−1·min−1; Wmax: 289 ± 46 W) were 
53 
recruited and completed this study. All participants were free from chronic disease 
54 
and deemed eligible to participate after the completion of a health screen 
55 
questionnaire. Habitual caffeine intake was assessed using a modified version of a 
56 
semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (Addicot, Yang, Peiffer, & Laurienti, 
57 
2008) to ensure intake did not exceed 75 mg·day−1. This cut-off point was chosen as 
58 
it equates to approximately one cup of caffeinated instant coffee (Fitt et al., 2013) 
59 
and is similar to what has been used previously (Bell & McLellan, 2002). The study 
60 
was approved by the Ethics Approvals (Human Participants) Sub-Committee at 
61 
Loughborough University, UK. 
62 
 
63 
Experimental Design 
64 
The experimental design is illustrated in Fig 1. All participants attended the 
65 
laboratory on six occasions. During the initial visit each participant undertook an 
66 
incremental exercise test to volitional exhaustion on an electronically braked cycle 
67 
ergometer (Lode Corival, Groningen, the Netherlands) to determine V
̇ O2peak and 
68 
peak power output at V
̇ O2peak (Wmax) After this visit, each participant completed one 
69 
practice trial. This was undertaken to ensure that all participants were accustomed to 
70 
procedures, to minimise order effects from learning or anxiety and ensure attainment 
71 
of a maximal effort during the performance task.  
72 
 6 
 
After these initial tests, each participant completed one acute caffeine trial (precaf) 
73 
and one placebo trial (testpla), each separated by 5-7 days. Thereafter, participants 
74 
were randomly assigned to ingest daily doses of caffeine (BDH Ltd, Poole, UK) or 
75 
starch (250 mg: BHD Ltd, Poole, UK) for 28 days. Both supplementation groups 
76 
were matched for age, stature, body mass, V
̇ O2peak and Wmax (P>0.05). During the 
77 
first seven days of supplementation, the caffeine group ingested half of the 
78 
prescribed caffeine dose (1.5 mg·kg−1) in their morning capsule (7-9 am) followed by 
79 
a placebo capsule (250 mg starch) in the afternoon (1-3 pm). From days 8 to 28, the 
80 
caffeine group received the full 3 mg·kg−1 dose, equally divided between the morning 
81 
and afternoon capsules. This titrated approach minimised negative influences of 
82 
caffeine on daily activities in caffeine-naive individuals (e.g. jitteriness, disturbed 
83 
sleep etc). The placebo group followed the same pattern of intake, but received 
84 
starch (250 mg) in both capsules. All participants were instructed to ingest the 
85 
capsules at the same time of day throughout the supplementation period and 
86 
compliance was verified by telephone contact, email and in person. Both the placebo 
87 
and caffeine capsules were visually identical and blinded by an external party not 
88 
involved in any stage of data collection. A second incremental exercise test was 
89 
completed on the morning of day 21, before the ingestion of any capsules. This 
90 
followed the same procedure as the initial visit and was undertaken to account for 
91 
any changes in V
̇ O2peak before the final single-blind acute 3 mg·kg−1 caffeine trial on 
92 
day 29 (postcaf). 
93 
The order of the testpla and precaf trials and assignment to either supplementation 
94 
group was via a double-blind, randomised design. Participants were instructed to 
95 
record their dietary intake and physical activity patterns in the 24 hr before their first 
96 
experimental trial and replicate this on the day before each subsequent experimental 
97 
 7 
 
trial. No strenuous exercise, alcohol, or caffeine ingestion was permitted during the 
98 
24 hr before any laboratory visit. However, the caffeine provided in the capsules was 
99 
permitted during the 24 hr before the postcaf trial (caffeine group). No additional 
100 
dietary caffeine was permitted during the supplementation period in both groups and 
101 
participants were provided with a list of commonly consumed caffeinated foods and 
102 
beverage to help achieve this. Participants were also instructed to maintain their 
103 
usual dietary and exercise patterns throughout the supplementation period. 
104 
Compliance to these measures was verified at the start of each visit, before any data 
105 
collection. Finally, all trials were performed at the same time of day to minimise 
106 
circadian-type variations in performance. 
107 
 
108 
Experimental trials 
109 
Participants arrived at the laboratory after an overnight fast (8-10 hr) with the 
110 
exception of ingesting 500 mL of plain water approximately 90 min before. Upon 
111 
arrival, post-void nude body mass was recorded to the nearest 10 g (Adam AFW-
112 
120K, Milton Keynes, UK) and a heart rate telemetry band (Polar Beat, Kempele, 
113 
Finland) positioned. After 10 min of supine rest, a 21g cannula was inserted into an 
114 
antecubital vein to allow repeated blood sampling. The cannula was flushed with a 
115 
small volume of saline after each sample to ensure patency. A baseline blood 
116 
sample (7 mL) was collected before participants ingested either 3 mg·kg−1 of 
117 
anhydrous caffeine (precaf and postcaf) or 250 mg of starch (testpla). After 60 min 
118 
rest, a second 7 mL venous blood sample was drawn before participants cycled for 
119 
60 min at an intensity equivalent to 60% V
̇ O2peak. During this period heart rate and 
120 
rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded every 5 and 10 min, respectively 
121 
 8 
 
(Borg, 1982). One-minute expired air samples were collected into Douglas bags 
122 
every 15 min to determine the rates of fat and carbohydrate oxidation (Peronnet & 
123 
Massicotte, 1991). Oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations in each bag were 
124 
determined with a paramagnetic analyser (Servomex 1400, Sussex, UK) calibrated 
125 
against gases of known concentration on the morning of each trial. Total volume was 
126 
quantified (Harvard Dry Gas Meter, Harvard Apparatus, USA) and gas values were 
127 
expressed as STPD.  After each sample was collected, participants were provided 
128 
with 100 mL of plain water. A third 7 mL blood sample was collected immediately 
129 
after the fixed-intensity exercise.  
130 
After this, there was a 2-3 min delay while the ergometer was set for the 
131 
performance task. Performance was assessed as the maximum amount of external 
132 
work (kJ) that could be completed in 30 min. This method is consistent with previous 
133 
studies (Jenkins, Trilk, Singhal, O’Connor, & Cureton, 2008) and reflected the high 
134 
ecological 
validity 
associated 
with 
similar 
cycle-based 
performance 
tests 
135 
(Jeukendrup, Saris, Brouns, & Kester, 1996). Participants began exercise at 75% 
136 
V
̇ O2peak, but were free to adjust the intensity of exercise from the outset. During the 
137 
performance task participants were instructed to maintain a constant cadence. No 
138 
verbal encouragement was given during this period and contact was limited to the 
139 
recording of the physiological and perceptual variables. Heart rate was recorded 
140 
every 5 min and RPE at 10 and 20 min, respectively. A final 7 mL blood sample was 
141 
collected at completion of exercise, after which the cannula was removed.  
142 
 
143 
 
144 
 
145

Blood collection and analysis  
146 
Blood samples (7 mL) were collected directly into dry syringes. A small sample (2 mL) 
147 
was dispensed into tubes containing K2EDTA. Duplicate 100 μL sub-samples were 
148 
rapidly deproteinised in 1 mL of ice-cold 0.3 M perchloric acid. These were 
149 
centrifuged and the resulting supernatant was used to determine blood glucose 
150 
concentrations (GOD-PAP, Randox Ltd, UK). Haemoglobin was measured in 
151 
duplicate 
(cyanmethemoglobin 
method) 
and 
haematocrit 
in 
triplicate 
152 
(microcentrifugation). These values were used to estimate percentage changes in 
153 
blood and plasma volumes relative to the resting sample (Dill & Costill, 1974). The 
154 
remaining blood (5 mL) was dispended into tubes containing clotting activator and 
155 
left at room temperature for at least 60 min before centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 
156 
min at 4°C. The supernatant was stored at -21°C for the determination of serum 
157 
prolactin and cortisol in duplicate via ELISA (DRG diagnostics, Germany) and serum 
158 
caffeine in duplicate with reverse-phase HPLC as previously described (Holland, 
159 
Godfredsen, Page, & Connor, 1998). The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) for 
160 
serum prolactin, cortisol and caffeine was 4.9%, 5.3% and 2.9%, respectively.   
161 
 
162 
Statistical analysis 
163 
All data were analysed using IBM SPSS statistics version 21.0. Normality was 
164 
assessed with the Shapiro Wilk test. Between-group comparisons of self-reported 
165 
habitual caffeine intake, stature, body mass, age, V
̇ O2peak and Wmax were determined 
166 
with t-tests for independent samples. Repeated measurements of body mass, 
167 
V
̇ O2peak and Wmax were analysed using a two-way (group x time) mixed-design 
168 
factorial ANOVA. Exercise performance and fasting plasma glucose were analysed 
169 
 10 
 
using a two-way (group x trial) mixed-design factorial ANOVA. Variables measured 
170 
throughout each trial were analysed using a three-way (group x trial x time) mixed-
171 
design factorial ANOVA. Where a main effect or interaction occurred, Bonferroni 
172 
adjusted paired t-tests for normally distributed data or Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests 
173 
for non-normally distributed data were used. Between-group comparisons during the 
174 
testpla, precaf and postcaf trials were determined with t-tests for independent 
175 
samples. In addition to null-hypothesis testing, magnitude-based inferences were 
176 
made to examine whether the observed differences in total external work produced 
177 
were meaningful (Hopkins, 2000). The magnitude of the smallest worthwhile change 
178 
in performance was set at 3% (~12 kJ), based on the findings of Jenkins et al. (2008) 
179 
using habituated, recreationally active participants. Cohen’s d effect size (ES) 
180 
examined the magnitude of individual differences in total external work produced 
181 
([Mean 1 - Mean 2]/pooled SD) and were interpreted as trivial (0-0.19), small (0.2-
182 
0.49), medium (0.5-0.79) or large (>0.8) as previously described (Cohen, 1992). 
183 
Data are presented as means ± SD unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance 
184 
was accepted at P<0.05. 
185 
 
186 
Results 
187 
Baseline measures  
188 
Self-reported habitual caffeine intake was similar between groups (placebo: 66 ± 6 
189 
mg·day−1 vs. caffeine: 60 ± 8 mg·day−1; P=0.076) There were no between-group 
190 
differences for baseline measures of age (placebo: 21.3 ± 2.2 y; caffeine: 21.0 ± 1.5 
191 
y; P=0.710), stature (placebo: 1.75 ± 0.06 m; caffeine: 1.76 ± 0.08 m; P=0.781), 
192 
body mass (placebo: 73.3 ± 7.4 kg; caffeine: 74.8 ± 10.1 kg; P=0.708), V
̇ O2peak 
193 
 11 
 
(placebo: 51.6 ± 9.6 ml·kg−1·min−1; caffeine: 51.2 ± 8.4 ml·kg−1·min−1; P=0.860) or 
194 
Wmax (placebo: 286 ± 47 w; caffeine: 296 ± 55 w; P=0.667). Day 21 body mass 
195 
(placebo: 73.1 ± 6.8 kg; caffeine: 74.8 ± 10.2 kg), V
̇ O2peak (placebo: 51.0 ± 9.2 
196 
ml·kg−1·min−1; caffeine: 50.6 ± 8.3 ml·kg−1·min−1) and Wmax (placebo: 282 ± 43 W; 
197 
caffeine: 289 ± 47 W) was similar to baseline between both supplementation groups 
198 
(trial x group interactions, P>0.646).  
199 
 
200 
Exercise performance 
201 
Total external work produced during the testpla trial was similar between the caffeine 
202 
(344. 9 ± 80.3 kJ) and placebo (333.1 ± 56.4 kJ) group (ES=0.17; P=0.723; Fig. 2A). 
203 
Compared with testpla, total external work produced during the precaf trial increased 
204 
12.0 ± 7.4% in the caffeine group (383.3 ± 75 kJ vs. 344. 9 ± 80.3 kJ; ES=0.49; 
205 
P=0.001) and 6.7 ± 4.2% in the placebo group (354.4 ± 55.2 kJ vs. 333.1 ± 56.4 kJ; 
206 
ES=0.38; P=0.004; Fig. 2A). Based on a smallest worthwhile change in performance 
207 
of 12 kJ, these within-group increases represent an ‘almost certainly beneficial’ 
208 
(caffeine group) and ‘probably beneficial’ (placebo group) effect on performance, 
209 
respectively (Table. 1). 
210 
Chronic caffeine supplementation resulted in a 7.3 ± 6.3% decrease in total external 
211 
work produced during the postcaf trial compared with precaf (358 ± 89 kJ vs. 383.3 ± 
212 
75 kJ; ES=-0.31; P=0.025; Fig. 2A). This diminished response represents a ‘probably 
213 
harmful’ effect on performance (Table. 1). Total external work produced during the 
214 
postcaf trial and tetspla was not statistically different (358 ± 89 kJ vs. 344.9 ± 80.3 kJ; 
215 
ES=0.16; P=0.188). However, inferences suggest the difference between these trials 
216 
represents a ‘possibly beneficial’ effect (Table. 1). Hence, chronic caffeine 
217 
 12 
 
supplementation might have not completely eliminated the performance benefit of 
218 
caffeine (i.e. postcaf vs. testpla; Table. 1).  
219 
Participants in the placebo group produced 6.1 ± 2.4% more external work during the 
220 
postcaf trial than testpla (351.8 ± 49.4 kJ vs. 333.1 ± 56.4; ES=0.33; P=0.004; Fig. 
221 
2A), with this increase representing a ‘probably beneficial’ effect on performance 
222 
(Table. 1). Accordingly, there was no difference between the precaf and postcaf trials 
223 
(354.4 ± 55.2 kJ vs. 351.8 ± 49.4 kJ; ES=0.05; P>0.05). 
224 
There were no between-group differences during the precaf (28.7 ± 74.8 kJ; 
225 
ES=0.44; P=0.368) or postcaf (6.2 ± 90.7 kJ; ES=0.09; P=0.858) trials (Fig. 2A; 
226 
Table. 1).  
227 
The order of the experimental trials was correctly guessed by two participants in 
228 
each 
supplementation 
group. 
Furthermore, 
three 
participants 
in 
each 
229 
supplementation group correctly guessed whether they received the caffeine or 
230 
placebo treatment during the habituation period. Therefore, blinding can be 
231 
considered successful as these odds are less than what could occur purely by 
232 
chance.  
233 
 
234 
Blood data 
235 
Circulating caffeine, cortisol, prolactin and glucose values recorded during exercise 
236 
are shown in table 2. Acute caffeine supplementation increased serum 
237 
concentrations during the precaf and postcaf trials, peaking 60 min after ingestion 
238 
and remaining greater throughout exercise than baseline and testpla (trial x time 
239 
interaction, P<0.05). There were no changes in serum caffeine concentrations during 
240 
 13 
 
testpla, with values remaining close to baseline throughout exercise in both groups. 
241 
The habituation protocol did not influence caffeine metabolism (P=0.605). 
242 
Serum cortisol increased progressively throughout exercise (P<0.05), peaking at the 
243 
end of the performance task in both groups. No influence from trial (P=0.535) or 
244 
supplementation group (P=0.628) occurred. Similarly, prolactin concentrations 
245 
increased during exercise (P<0.05), but the rate of increase was similar across trials 
246 
(P=0.498) and between groups (P=0.649). The greatest concentrations were at the 
247 
end of the performance task across all trials in both groups (P<0.05). Neither cortisol 
248 
(P=0.552) or prolactin (P=0.965) were influenced by the habituation protocol.  
249 
Fasting plasma glucose was similar across all three trials in both supplementation 
250 
groups (P=0.465). During exercise, plasma concentrations increased steadily 
251 
(P<0.05), with similar values across trials (P=0.096) and between groups (P=0.443). 
252 
Compared with baseline, both blood and plasma volumes were reduced during 
253 
exercise (P<0.05). No influence of trial (P>0.135) or group (P>0.649) occurred. 
254 
 
255 
Heart rate, substrate oxidation and RPE  
256 
Mean heart rate, expired gas and RPE values recorded during exercise are shown in 
257 
table 3. Exercise caused a progressive increase in heart rate throughout the fixed-
258 
intensity exercise (P<0.05). This increase remained similar across trials (P=0.169) 
259 
and between supplementation groups (P=0.984). Similarly, heart rate increased 
260 
during the performance task (P<0.05), but this increase was similar across trials 
261 
(P=0.891) and between groups (P=0.887). Within-group differences in mean heart 
262 
 14 
 
rate occurred across trials. The greatest values were during the precaf trial in both 
263 
groups (Table. 3). There were no between-group differences (P>0.274). 
264 
Rates of carbohydrate oxidation decreased (P=0.026) while rates of fat oxidation 
265 
increased (P<0.05) during the fixed-intensity exercise. Neither of these were 
266 
influenced by trial (P>0.784) or group (P>0.328). Furthermore, RER values 
267 
decreased (P<0.05) while V
̇ O2 increased (P<0.05) during exercise. No influence 
268 
from trial (P>0.691) or group (P>0.189) occurred.  
269 
Exercise induced a steady increase in RPE during the fixed intensity exercise 
270 
(P<0.05), with similar values across trials (P=0.265) and between groups (P=0.441). 
271 
Similarly, RPE increased throughout the performance task (P<0.05), but this 
272 
response was independent of trial (P=0.174) and group (P>0.05).

Discussion:  
275 
This study examined whether four weeks of controlled caffeine intake influenced 
276 
endurance performance in a group of recreationally active men with low-habitual 
277 
caffeine intakes. The results of the present study indicate that chronic 
278 
supplementation with a titrated low dose of caffeine developed tolerance to the 
279 
ergogenic effect a subsequent acute caffeine dose. While these results contrast with 
280 
previous studies that have examined effects of sub-chronic caffeine supplementation 
281 
(Irwin et al., 2011), this is the first study to examine effects of a prolonged period of 
282 
controlled caffeine intake typical of the general population (Fitt et al., 2013). This 
283 
suggests that supplementation protocols in previous studies (Irwin et al., 2011) were 
284 
too short to influence mechanisms that develop tolerance.  
285 
 15 
 
Previous research demonstrated caffeine prolonged time-to-exhaustion because it 
286 
enhanced fat oxidation late in exercise with a subsequent sparring of muscle 
287 
glycogen (Costill, Dalsky, & Fink, 1978). The results of the present study are contrary 
288 
to this as substrate oxidation was not influenced either by acute or chronic caffeine 
289 
supplementation. Alternatively, chronic caffeine intake could influence caffeine 
290 
metabolism (Svenningsson et al., 1999). This might lead to an increase in the 
291 
concentrations of paraxanthine and theophylline, caffeine’s primary metabolites 
292 
(Svenningsson et al., 1999). As these possess a greater affinity for adenosine 
293 
receptors than caffeine (Fredholm et al., 1999), this could result in enhanced 
294 
development of tolerance. However, caffeine concentrations were similar between 
295 
the precaf and postcaf trials in the caffeine group (Table. 2), suggesting the 
296 
habituation protocol failed to influence caffeine metabolism. Although paraxanthine 
297 
and theophylline concentrations were not measured, these methylxanthines do not 
298 
penetrate the blood-brain-barrier with the same efficacy as caffeine (Svenningsson 
299 
et al., 1999). Therefore, any subtle change in the peripheral concentrations of these 
300 
metabolites attributable to the chronic supplementation protocol is unlikely to explain 
301 
the development of tolerance.  
302 
Serum cortisol and prolactin were assessed as these are indirect indicators of central 
303 
noradrenergic (Tsigos & Chrousos, 2002) and dopaminergic (Ben-Jonathan & 
304 
Hnasko, 2001) activity, respectively. Chronic caffeine supplementation did not 
305 
influence the circulating concentrations of these hormones (Table. 2), suggesting 
306 
that neurotransmitter release along these neural pathways does not explain the 
307 
development of tolerance. Direct analysis of neurotransmitter release with 
308 
microdialysis (Acquas, Tanda, & Di Chiara, 2002; De Luca, Bassareo, Bauer, & Di 
309 
Chiara, 2007) and brain imaging techniques (Volkow et al., 2015) also support this 
310 
 16 
 
hypothesis. Although high acute caffeine doses increase striatal dopamine release 
311 
(i.e. 30 mg·kg−1; Solinas et al., 2002), lower doses (i.e. 0.25-5 mg·kg−1), typically 
312 
consumed by the general population (Fitt et al., 2013), have not influenced dopamine 
313 
release both in rat (Acquas et al., 2002; De Luca et al., 2007) and human (Volkow et 
314 
al., 2015) striatum. Therefore, an alternative mechanism is likely responsible. 
315 
Chronic caffeine supplementation has been associated with changes in A2A 
316 
expression across several brain regions (Svenningsson et al., 1999). However, a 
317 
cross-tolerance to the A1 receptor probably plays a more important role in mediating 
318 
the development of tolerance (Karcz-Kubicha et al., 2003). This could involve a 
319 
functional change in the striatal A1/A2A heteromer (Ciruela et al., 2006), while others 
320 
have reported changes in A1 receptor expression throughout the brain after chronic 
321 
caffeine supplementation (Johansson et al., 1993). A recent positron emission 
322 
topography study demonstrated that almost half of in vivo cerebral A1 receptors were 
323 
occupied by caffeine when participants received an intravenous dose of 4.3 mg·kg−1, 
324 
which corresponded to a plasma concentration of ~8 μg∙mL-1 (Elmenhorst, Meyer, 
325 
Matusch, Winz, & Bauer, 2012). Participants in the present study were habituated to 
326 
daily doses of 3 mg·kg−1 from days 8 to 28, resulting in serum concentrations of 
327 
approximately 3.5 μg∙mL-1 (Table. 2). Based on these observations, it could be that 
328 
the 3 mg·kg−1 caffeine dose administered in the present study resulted in the 
329 
occupation of approximately a quarter of cerebral A1 receptors. This suggests 
330 
supplementation with larger daily caffeine doses (i.e. 6-9 mg·kg−1), which will 
331 
ultimately occupy more A1 receptors, results in accelerated and/or total development 
332 
of tolerance. 
333 
The influence of caffeine habituation in participants is often overlooked in many 
334 
studies, despite evidence which demonstrates that this influences effects after acute 
335 
 17 
 
supplementation (Bell & McLellan, 2002). To minimise this confounder, all 
336 
participants in the present study were low caffeine consumers before participation. 
337 
Differences in habitual caffeine consumption are associated with single nucleotide 
338 
polymorphisms in the ADORA2A gene encoding for the A2A receptor (Cornelis, El-
339 
Sohemy, & Campos, 2007). These findings demonstrated individuals with the 
340 
homozygous recessive (TT) genotype consumed less caffeine than their 
341 
homozygous dominant (CC) counterparts (Cornelis et al., 2007). Recently, TT 
342 
carriers performed better during a short performance task (10 min) than CC carriers 
343 
when supplemented with an acute 5 mg·kg−1 caffeine dose (Loy, O’Connor, 
344 
Lindheimer, & Covert, 2015). Perhaps this could explain the small between-group 
345 
difference in total external work produced during the precaf trial (28.7 ± 74.8 kJ; 
346 
ES=0.44), with more TT carriers present in the caffeine group. However, genotype 
347 
determination was not undertaken in the present study, which limits the extent to 
348 
which this relationship can be inferred. 
349 
Well-trained individuals produce more reliable performance data during cycle-based 
350 
time-trials than their recreationally active counterparts (Zavorsky et al., 2007). 
351 
However, recreationally active individuals produced a CV of 1.7% (Zavorsky et al., 
352 
2007) and 0.7% (Fleming and James, 2014) during cycle and running-based time-
353 
trials, respectively. Furthermore, similar performance tests to that in the present 
354 
study had a CV of approximately 3% (Jeukendrup et al., 1996). This variability is less 
355 
than the percentage increase in performance during the precaf trials (caffeine: 12.0 ± 
356 
7.4%; placebo: 6.7 ± 4.2%) and the percentage decrease in performance during the 
357 
postcaf trial compared with precaf in the caffeine group (-7.3 ± 6.3%). Therefore, 
358 
neither the participant group nor the performance test used in the present study 
359 
adversely influenced the validity of the performance data. 
360 
 18 
 
Ideally, the study design would have incorporated a post-supplementation placebo 
361 
trial, hence providing a direct comparison with the postcaf trial after the chronic 
362 
supplementation protocol. It was deemed difficult to implement as timing both trials 
363 
to occur at the end of the supplementation period was not possible. For example, 
364 
two randomised trials, undertaken seven days apart, means the supplementation 
365 
period before the postcaf trial would be twenty-eight days for half the participants 
366 
and thirty-five days for the remaining participants. Importantly, peak power output 
367 
and maximal oxygen uptake were similar between the two V
̇ O2peak tests. Furthermore, 
368 
heart rate and oxygen uptake during the fixed-intensity exercise was similar during 
369 
all three trials. This suggests participants maintained similar fitness throughout the 
370 
study period and exercise intensity was matched before the performance task during 
371 
each of the experimental trials. Hence, any influence on performance during the 
372 
postcaf trial in either supplementation group is likely due to participants receiving 
373 
caffeine or placebo during the chronic supplementation period. 
374 
In conclusion, the present findings demonstrate that chronic ingestion of a titrated 
375 
low dose of caffeine results in the development of tolerance in a group of healthy, 
376 
recreationally active males with low-habitual caffeine intakes. This occurred despite 
377 
no changes before and after supplementation in circulating caffeine, hormonal 
378 
concentrations or substrate oxidation. The influence of chronic caffeine intake should 
379 
be examined in well-trained individuals with low-habitual caffeine intakes. In addition, 
380 
futures studies should identify when the tolerance to caffeine occurs and examine 
381 
whether supplementation with larger daily doses (i.e. 6-9 mg·kg−1) influences the 
382 
rate and extent of the development of tolerance.

Table 1: Differences in total external work produced (kJ) during the experimental trials within and between 
supplementation groups 
PLA, Placebo group; CAF, Caffeine group; ES, Cohen’s d effect size. Qualitative outcome numbers 
indicate the percentage chance the true value is beneficial, trivial or harmful based on a 12 kJ 
difference in external work produced during the performance task. An effect was deemed unclear 
when the percentage chances of benefit and harm were >5%.
