IMPORTANCE Findings suggest that infections might be linked to the development of
psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior. Large-scale studies are needed to investigate the
effect of infection on the risk of suicide.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the association between hospitalization with infection and the risk of
death by suicide.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Nationwide, population-based, prospective cohort
study with more than 149 million person-years of follow-up. Data were analyzed with survival
analysis techniques and were adjusted for sex, age, calendar period, cohabitation status,
socioeconomic status, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Individual data were drawn from
Danish longitudinal registers. A total of 7.22 million individuals 15 years or older living in
Denmark between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2011, were observed during a 32-year
follow-up period.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The risk of death by suicide was identified in the Danish
Cause of Death Register. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and accompanying 95% CIs were used as
measures of relative risk.
RESULTS In 7 221 578 individuals (3 601 653 men and 3 619 925 women) observed for a total
of 149 061 786 person-years, 32 683 suicides were observed during the follow-up period.
Among the suicides, 7892 (24.1%) individuals had previously been diagnosed as having an
infection during a hospitalization. Hospitalization with infection was linked to an elevated risk
of suicide, with an IRR of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.38-1.46) compared with those without prior
infection. Dose-response relationships were observed with respect to the number of hospital
contacts for different infections. For example, having 7 or more infections was linked to an
IRR of 2.90 (95% CI, 2.14-3.93). The number of days of treatment for infections was
associated with an elevated risk of suicide in a dose-response relationship. More than 3
months of hospital treatment was linked to an IRR of 2.38 (95% CI, 2.05-2.76). The
population-attributable risk associated with hospitalization with infection accounted for
10.1% of suicides.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An increased risk of death by suicide was found among
individuals hospitalized with infection in prospective and dose-response relationships. These
findings indicate that infections may have a relevant role in the pathophysiological
mechanisms of suicidal behavior.

I
nfection is one of the most common causes of illness in the
world,1 and it is increasingly recognized that infection and
inflammation can have a critical role in psychiatric
disorders2-6 and in suicidal behavior.7-10 Suicide is a major
healthproblemworldwide.11However,whilepsychologicalpre-
dictors of suicide, such as psychiatric disorders and history of
suicide attempts,12 have been examined extensively, there is
a dearth of longitudinal studies investigating the effect of bio-
logical factors, such as infection.
Although certain infectious agents infect the brain di-
rectly, others reach the brain from the periphery, and yet oth-
ers generate molecular mediators of inflammation that cross
from the periphery into the brain and thereby increase the risk
of suicide.13 Examples of agents infecting the brain are influ-
enza B virus14 and the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which have
been linked to suicidal behavior.15-18 In addition, an associa-
tion between T gondii and phenotypes of suicidal behavior,
such as impulsivity and aggression, has been reported in
healthy adults19 and psychiatric patients.20
Inflammation might also lead to dysregulation of trypto-
phan metabolites,21,22 with state-dependent elevation of the
excitotoxic metabolite quinolinic acid in the cerebrospinal
fluid23 and increased brain barrier free crossing of the metabo-
lite kynurenine (a precursor of quinolinic acid), increased in
the blood from patients with suicidal behavior compared
with healthy and psychiatric controls.24 Quinolinic acid is an
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist with the capability of
altering glutamate neurotransmission.25 Furthermore, site-
specificchangesinbrainconcentrationsofquinolinicacidwere
reported in patients with severe depression who died by
suicide.26,27 In addition, postmortem brain samples of pa-
tients who died by suicide have shown increased messenger
RNA levels of inflammatory cytokines.28,29 Elevated levels of
peripheral inflammatory markers, such as cytokines, have also
been found in the blood of people who attempted suicide and
patients with high ratings of suicidal ideation.30-32 However,
most previous studies9,14,16,23,24,26,28-32 have been limited by
small sample size and cross-sectional study designs.
The research on the neurobiological basis of suicidality is
in rapid development, but large-scale studies are needed to
clarify the role of infection in suicide. In the present study, we
investigated associations between infectious diseases and the
risk of death by suicide using Danish nationwide registers. To
address possible causality, we examined the risk of suicide as-
sociated with the number of hospitalizations with different in-
fections, the number of days hospitalized with treatment for
infection, and the time since the last hospitalization with treat-
ment for infection.
Methods
Study Population
All individuals 15 years or older who were living in Denmark
between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2011, were in-
cluded in our analyses. Those who turned 15 years old or who
immigrated into the country were included beginning on the
respective dates. The cohort consisted of 7 221 578 individu-
als followed up until death, emigration from Denmark, disap-
pearance, or December 31, 2011, whichever came first.
Danish Registers
The Danish Civil Registration System contains complete and
continuously updated administrative data on all residents liv-
ing in Denmark.33 A unique personal identification number
assigned to each person enables accurate and complete link-
age between various national registries. Data were obtained
from the following registers: the National Hospital Register,34
the Psychiatric Central Research Register,35 and the Cause of
Death Register.36 Diagnoses were recorded according to the
diagnostic system of the International Classification of Dis-
eases, Eighth Revision (ICD-8) until January 1, 1994, after
which date the International Statistical Classification of Dis-
eases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)
was used. All registers have full national coverage, and infor-
mation from the registers are anonymized when used for
research. This study was approved by the Danish Data Pro-
tection Agency. Because of the nature of the data, informed
consent was not required.
Assessment of Hospitalization With Infection
A history of infection was defined as 1 or more infection diag-
noses listed since 1977 in the National Hospital Register.34
After 1995, outpatient visits and visits to emergency depart-
ments were included. All infections were grouped into
subcategories, including pathogen (ie, bacterial, viral, and
remaining pathogens), as well as type of infection (ie, sepsis,
hepatitis, gastrointestinal tract, skin, respiratory tract, uro-
logical, genital, pregnancy-related [among women 49 years
or younger], otitis media, central nervous system, and
human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or AIDS infections).
All ICD-8 and ICD-10 codes for the included pathogens and
types of infection are listed in eTable 1 in the Supplement. In
addition, we assessed the effect by the number of hospital-
izations with different infections (measured as different
2-digit ICD codes [eg, A40 and A41]), the number of days hos-
pitalized with treatment for infection (measured as the num-
ber of bed-days in the hospital), and the time since the last
hospitalization with treatment for infection (measured as the
number of days since discharge from a hospitalization with
infection).
Key Points
Question What is the effect of hospitalization with infection on
the risk of death by suicide?
Findings In this nationwide register-based cohort study, a
significantly increased risk of death by suicide was found among
individuals hospitalized with infection compared with individuals
with no infection. Risk of suicide was observed in both prospective
and dose-response relationships and adjusted for a range of
possible confounders.
Meaning These findings indicate that infections may have a
relevant role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of suicidal
behavior.

Assessment of Psychiatric Diagnosis
Data on psychiatric diagnoses were obtained from the Psychi-
atric Central Research Register,35 which lists hospitaliza-
tions since 1968. After 1995, visits to psychiatric outpatient
clinics and psychiatric emergency units were included.
For the examined psychiatric diagnoses, the date of onset
was defined as the first date of a recorded diagnosis in the
register. Included diagnoses are listed in eTable 2 in the
Supplement.
Assessment of Cause of Death
Theoutcomeofinterestwasdeathbysuicide.Suicidewasiden-
tified in the Cause of Death Register as ICD-8 codes E950 to
E959 or ICD-10 codes X60 to X84 or Y87 or if the manner of
death was listed as suicide.
Statistical Analysis
We used logistic regression models, assuming a Poisson dis-
tribution to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs.
We measured the risk of suicide among individuals diag-
nosed as having an infection relative to individuals without
an infection. The risk estimates were obtained for different in-
fection categories, including pathogen and type of infection,
number of hospitalizations with different infections, number
ofdayshospitalizedwithtreatmentforinfection,andtimesince
the last hospitalization with treatment for infection. No dif-
ferenceswerenotedbetweenthesexesexceptthatwomenhad
a higher incidence of death by suicide after infection, which
is why the basic model was adjusted for sex, age (15-29, 30-
49, 50-64, 65-79, and ≥80 years), and calendar period (1980-
1989, 1990-1999, and 2000-2011). In the fully adjusted model,
we further adjusted for cohabitation status (cohabitation vs no
cohabitation), socioeconomic status (working, unemployed,
disability pension, early retirement, student, or other), and the
CharlsonComorbidityIndex(nonevs≥1comorbiddisorders).37
To investigate whether psychiatric disorders might have a me-
diating role, the risk of suicide relative to the timing of infec-
tion and psychiatric diagnosis was examined in a sensitivity
analysis. We also calculated the population-attributable risk38
and used the IRR of suicide from the fully adjusted model with
the following formula:
Population-AttributableRisk = Pe(IRRe − 1) / 1 + Pe(IRRe − 1)
,where Pe is the prevalence of exposure and IRRe is the IRR of
suicide due to that exposure. All included covariates except
sex were time-varying covariates and were updated either on
the exact date of a change in status or on a yearly basis. For all
the estimates, the same individual could, at different stages,
contribute with risk time to different groups (eg, number of
infections).
We conducted a sensitivity analysis by restricting the
sampletoasubcohortbornafter1962,amongwhommorecom-
plete coverage of exposure to infections was secured (ie, only
childhood exposure was not included). In a second sensitiv-
ity analysis, the sample was restricted to persons with no
previous psychiatric diagnoses.
All data presented in this article were analyzed using sta-
tistical software. The software package used was SAS, ver-
sion 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
The cohort consisted of 7 221 578 individuals (3 601 653 men
and 3 619 925 women) observed for a total of 149 061 786 per-
son-years. During the follow-up period, 809 384 (11.2%) indi-
viduals had a hospitalization with infection. A total of 32 683
suicides were observed during the follow-up period. Of those,
7892(24.1%)individualshadpreviouslybeendiagnosedashav-
ing an infection during a hospitalization.
In the fully adjusted model, the relative risk of suicide was
increased among individuals with any hospitalization with
infection, with an IRR of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.38-1.46) compared
with individuals without infection (Table 1). Except for
pregnancy-related infections, all examined types of infec-
tions were linked to an increased risk of suicide, which was
most pronounced for HIV or AIDS, hepatitis, respiratory
tract, and sepsis infections.
The risk of suicide increased in a dose-response relation-
ship with the number of hospitalizations with different
infections (Figure, A). The highest incidence of suicide was
found for having 7 or more infections, with an IRR of 2.90
(95% CI, 2.14-3.93), while individuals with one hospitaliza-
tion had an IRR of 1.34 (95% CI, 1.30-1.38) compared with
those with no hospitalization. After receiving treatment for
infection in the hospital for 1 to 4 days, the IRR was 1.46
(95% CI, 1.41-1.52), while the risk was 2.38 (95% CI, 2.05-
2.76) after 94 days in treatment (Figure, B). The time since
the last hospitalization with treatment for infection was
linked to an elevated risk of suicide (P < .001), with the
strongest effect after 1 and 2 years compared with those
without infection (Figure, C).
Our analysis yielded a population-attributable risk asso-
ciated with hospitalization with infection of 10.1% of sui-
cides. The implication is that 1 in 10 suicides could be pre-
vented if infections were to be eliminated entirely, provided
that the association was causal.
In a sensitivity analysis, hospitalization with infection was
still significantly associated with suicide when we restricted
the study sample to individuals who had never been diag-
nosed as having a psychiatric disorder (ie, comparable to ad-
justing for psychiatric disorders). A 1.31-fold (95% CI, 1.27-
1.36) higher risk of suicide was observed among persons who
did not have a history of any psychiatric diagnosis. Similarly,
restricting the sample to individuals with no diagnosis of
schizophrenia or affective disorder was linked to an elevated
risk of suicide (IRR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.36-1.44). When only
assessing the effect of infections among individuals who
had never been diagnosed as having a substance use diag-
nosis, a significant effect was also observed (IRR, 1.35; 95%
CI, 1.36-1.39).
To examine the time relationship, we stratified the analy-
sis to individuals with a history of psychiatric diagnosis
according to the time of infection. We found that individuals
diagnosed as having an infection before a psychiatric diagno-
sis had an IRR of 1.21 (95% CI, 1.15-1.28) for suicide compared
with individuals with a psychiatric diagnosis and no infection
(Table 2). Individuals diagnosed as having an infection after a

Discussion
To our knowledge, this investigation is the largest study to
date to examine infections as a predictor of death by sui-
cide. In this nationwide population-based cohort study, we
found a 42% significantly increased risk of death by suicide
in those with a history of hospitalization with infection and
subsequent death by suicide. The data are consistent with a
dose-response relationship with respect to the number of
hospitalizations with different infections and the number of
days hospitalized with treatment for infection. Also, an
increased risk of suicide was noted relative to the time since
the last hospitalization with treatment for infection. These
risk estimates remained significantly increased after adjust-
ing for important confounding variables, including sex, age,
calendar period, cohabitation status, socioeconomic status,
and the Charlson Comorbidity Index.
In this large-scale study, we found that all pathogens are
linked to an elevated risk of suicide, as well as most types of
infections. The only exceptions were pregnancy-related
infections and otitis media infections. While the protective
effect of parenthood on an individual’
s risk of suicide39
could explain the lack of association with pregnancy-related
infections, otitis media infections often occur early in life
and generally induce a lower systemic response, which
might explain a lack of influence. Types of infection, such
as sepsis, respiratory tract, and genital infections, induce
a more severe systemic response that could be more likely
to affect the brain, which adds support to the hypothesis
of a biological link between infections and death by
suicide.13
The highest risk of suicide was found among individuals
with hepatitis infection and HIV or AIDS infection, which is
in line with previous findings that these patients report
higher levels of suicidal ideation and behavior than the gen-
eral population.40-42 Furthermore, HIV or AIDS infection is
strongly linked with psychiatric disorders (eg, depression
and substance use).41,42 However, after excluding indivi-
duals with psychiatric diagnoses, including substance
use diagnoses, the risk estimates herein remained signifi-
cant, implying that this finding may only explain part of the
association.
Psychiatric disorders are potential mediators, and a psy-
chiatric diagnosis before an infection can act as a potential
effect modifier. In a sensitivity analysis, an increased risk of
death by suicide was found among individuals diagnosed as
having an infection before a psychiatric disorder compared
with individuals with a psychiatric diagnosis and no infec-
tion. Notably, the risk of suicide was not elevated among
those with an infection after a psychiatric diagnosis. How-
ever, it is well known that individuals with severe mental ill-
ness experience increased mortality after infection.43 Hence,
individuals diagnosed as having a psychiatric disorder and
then admitted for an infection seem to die of causes other
than suicide. An effect related to infections was also noted
herein after excluding individuals diagnosed as having psy-
chiatric disorders, including substance use. This finding sug-
gests that the association between infection and death by sui-
cide is not solely explained by psychiatric disorders. Still,
substance use may be underdiagnosed among psychiatric
inpatients.44
As previously mentioned, there are several potential
causal links between infection and suicide. Our findings
support the literature in this field, in which small-scale
studies9,14,16,23,24,26,28-32 have linked infections, proinflamma-
torycytokines,andinflammatorymetabolitestoincreasedrisk

The association between infection and suicide could also
be an epiphenomenon or mediated through other related pre-
dictors. The psychological effect of being hospitalized with a
severe infection might affect the risk of suicide. However, af-
ter adjusting for the effect of long-term and physical diseases
using the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the association be-
tween infection and suicide was still significant. It is also pos-
sible that immune alterations that lead to or are the conse-
quence of past or long-term infections, as well as potentially
reactivating infections, could lead to suicidal behavior.13 Fur-
thermore, infection and treatment with antibiotics can have
an effect on the human microbiome,45 which could also in-
fluence the associations indicated by recent research on the
microbiome-gut-brainaxisanditseffectsonhumanbehavior.46
Bacterialinfectionswereonlyslightlymoreassociatedwithsui-
cide than viral infections, indicating that the associations are
less likely to merely be due to antibiotic treatment affecting
the microbiome.
Although psychiatric disorders and previous suicide
attempts might constitute stronger predictors of suicide,12
we found that hospitalization with infection accounted for a
population-attributable risk of 10.1%. Admittedly, infections
might not be amenable to direct interventions. While our
findings do not exclude the possibility that genetic vulner-
ability factors for suicide exist, they indicate that genetic
factors and environmental factors, such as infections, are
both linked to suicide.
Strengths of the study are the use of nationwide registers
with individual-level data, which allows investigation of out-
comes with low frequency, such as suicide. By adjusting for a
rangeoftime-varyingcovariates,ourriskestimatesgainedpre-
cision. All data were collected prospectively and studied dur-
ing a long follow-up period of 32 years. There is free access to
and treatment in Danish hospitals, full national coverage in all
registers, and no loss to follow-up.
Our study had some limitations. First, data on infec-
tions were limited to inpatient hospitalizations before 1995.
Consequently, milder infections treated in primary care set-
tings or untreated infections that did not require hospital
admission were not included during this period. The inclu-
sion of all outpatient visits from 1995 onward might render
the risk estimates as conservative because more visits for
less severe infections are included. Future research should
investigate infections among inpatients only, and hospital
admissions with infections in early childhood and their
effect on outcomes should also be investigated, which was
beyond the scope of the present study. Second, we cannot
determine whether the hospital treatment itself or disability
due to severe infection might explain some of the observed
risks, although the possibility is minimized by the fact that
elevated risks were also noted years after the last hospital-
ization. There is also the possibility of mediation, in which
risk factors for suicide, such as depression, may be associ-
ated with self-care issues and thereby linked to the inci-
dence and severity of infections. Third, we did not have
information on hospitalizations before January 1, 1977.
However, a subcohort born after 1962 with full adult life-
time follow-up in all registers supported the association
between infection and suicide. Fourth, there is a dearth of
knowledge about suicide risk among minority groups in the
Danish society, although persons with a foreign background
were still included in the analyses. Fifth, residual confound-
ing by variables not captured in the registers, such as undi-
agnosed infections or psychiatric disorders, cannot be
excluded, and it is possible that the risk estimates might be
influenced by circumstances for which we did not or were
unable to adjust for. It would also have been preferable to
adjust for previous self-harm in individuals and their rela-
tives. However, this event is underrecorded in Danish hospi-
tal data and could potentially lead to bias in the results.47
Likewise, underrecording of suicides is possible, although
the registration of suicides has been found to be reliable in
Denmark.48
Risk of suicide was observed in both prospective and dose-
response relationships. Our findings indicate that infections
may have a relevant role in the pathophysiological mecha-
nisms of suicidal behavior. Provided that the association be-
tween infection and the risk of death by suicide was causal,
identification and early treatment of infections could be ex-
plored as a public health measure for prevention of suicide.
Still, further efforts are needed to clarify the exact mecha-
nisms by which infection influences human behavior and risk
of suicide.
Conclusions
We found an increased risk of death by suicide among indi-
viduals hospitalized with infection. The association re-
mained after adjusting for a range of possible confounders.
