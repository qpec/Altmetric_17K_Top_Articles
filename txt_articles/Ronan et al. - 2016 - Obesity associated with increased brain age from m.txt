Common mechanisms in aging and obesity are hypothesized to increase susceptibility to neuro-
degeneration, however, direct evidence in support of this hypothesis is lacking. We therefore performed
a cross-sectional analysis of magnetic resonance image-based brain structure on a population-based
cohort of healthy adults. Study participants were originally part of the Cambridge Centre for Ageing
and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) and included 527 individuals aged 20e87 years. Cortical reconstruction
techniques were used to generate measures of whole-brain cerebral white-matter volume, cortical
thickness, and surface area. Results indicated that cerebral white-matter volume in overweight and
obese individuals was associated with a greater degree of atrophy, with maximal effects in middle-age
corresponding to an estimated increase of brain age of 10 years. There were no similar body mass
index-related changes in cortical parameters. This study suggests that at a population level, obesity
may increase the risk of neurodegeneration.

1. Introduction
The link between obesity and adverse health outcomes such as
diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease is well established and
poses a major challenge to current and future health care provision.
Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that obesity may act to
accelerate or advance the onset of age-related changes such as
neurodegeneration, either directly or through associated comor-
bidities (Doherty, 2011). These associations, taken together with the
increased rate of obesity in elderly populations (Flegal et al., 2012)
render it critical to understand the full impact of obesity on brain
health, in particular as evidence suggests that adverse outcomes
may be mitigated through intervention (Gunstad et al., 2011).
A number of strands of evidence have related biological pro-
cesses associated with obesity to changes found in normal aging.
For example, as with normal aging, obesity increases oxidative
stress (Furukawa et al., 2004) and promotes inflammation through
the production of proinflammatory cytokines produced in adipose
tissue (Arnoldussen et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2009). In turn, cyto-
kines and proinflammatory markers such as interleukin 6 and
tumor necrosis factor-a have been linked to cognitive decline
(Chung et al., 2009; Griffin, 2006; Wilson et al., 2002) and have
been shown to be upregulated in regions undergoing neuro-
degeneration (Wilson et al., 2002). Inflammatory biomarkers have
been associated with increased brain atrophy, a common marker of
aging (Jefferson et al., 2007), as have other endophenotypes such as
shortened telomere length (Wikgren et al., 2014). Conversely, a
considerable body of evidence exists suggesting that caloric re-
striction may be neuroprotective, leading to a delay or slowing of
aging (Colman et al., 2014, 2009; Masoro, 2005; Sohal and
Weindruch, 1996), a reduction in age-related apoptosis (Someya
et al., 2007), and age-related production of proinflammatory cyto-
kines (Kalani et al., 2006; Spaulding et al., 1997).
In short, the growing body of literature that relates common
markers of aging to those observed in obesity supports the hy-
pothesis that obesity may accelerate or advance the onset of brain
aging. However, direct studies in support of this link are lacking.
For example, although many studies have reported a link between
increased body mass index (BMI) and declining cognitive function

 (Cournot et al., 2006; Debette et al., 2011), as well as increased risk
of dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease (Gustafson et al., 2004;
Whitmer et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2011), other studies contradict
these findings (Qizilbash et al., 2015), and indeed, it has even been
suggested that lower, rather than higher, body mass may be pre-
dictive of the onset of AD in the years immediately preceding the
onset of clinical symptoms (Fielding et al., 2013; Knopman et al.,
2007). The literature on brain structural changes too is complex.
Although many studies report a negative correlation between BMI
and gray matter volume (GMV) (increased BMI linked to lower
GMV) (Brooks et al., 2013; Debette et al., 2014; Gunstad et al.,
2008; Hassenstab et al., 2012; Veit et al., 2014), other reports are
contradictory (Haltia et al., 2007; Pannacciulli et al., 2007; Sharkey
et al., 2015). More significantly, despite a considerable number of
often highly powered studies across the adult lifespan (Taki et al.,
2008), there is a conspicuous lack of either global findings related
to obesity or evidence of an aging interaction (for a review, see
Willette and Kapogiannis, 2015).
Thus, although current neuroimaging evidence certainly sug-
gests altered brain structure is associated with obesity, it fails to
support the hypothesis that obesity influences age-related atrophy
of the brain. There are a number for reasons for why this might be.
Different tissue types in the brain age at different rates (Walhovd
et al., 2005), perhaps limiting the sensitivity of cross-sectional
studies over limited age-periods. Moreover, there is a complex
and somewhat compensatory interaction between the change in
cortical thickness and surface area (Storsve et al., 2014), that may
confound analysis by morphometric methods such as voxel-based
morphometry
commonly
employed
in
structural
studies
of
obesity. In addition, voxel-based morphometry
methods are
designed to obviate global changes in favor of regional analyses. If
obesity, like aging affects the brain globally, it may be the case that a
significant global interaction may be obfuscated. Analysis of white
matter too may be confounded. Although some studies suggest
obesity and inflammation are both associated with smaller frac-
tional anisotropy in diffusion tensor imaging (Stanek et al., 2011;
Verstynen et al., 2013), it is also the case that additional factors
related to obesity and aging such as blood pressure are positively
associated with fractional anisotropy (Verstynen et al., 2013),
raising the possibility that competing effects may hamper identi-
fication of an age-by-BMI interaction. The alternative to these
propositions is that obesity may increase the rate of aging of brain
tissue but that these effects are subtle and within the scope of
normal aging parameters.
In this cross-sectional population-based study, we assessed the
impact of obesity on brain structure across the adult lifespan using
global parameters of volume, cortical thickness, and surface area.
The goal of our study was to establish the overall effect of obesity on
gray (i.e., cortical thickness and surface area) and white matter; to
determine whether obesity affected tissue types differentially; and
crucially to investigate whether obesity was associated with an
increase in brain age, evaluated with reference to lean controls. We
were particularly interested in whether changes associated with
obesity (i.e., deviations from lean age-matched controls) might
occur during a particular vulnerable period.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Subjects
A total of 527 subjects with an age range of 20e87 years were
included in this study. Participants were cognitively healthy adults
recruited from the local community over a period of 5 years as part of
an ongoing project to investigate the effects of aging on memory and
cognition at the Cambridge Centre for Aging and Neuroscience (Shafto
et al., 2014). Ethical approval for the Cam-CAN study was obtained
from the Cambridgeshire 2 (now East of EnglandeCambridge Central)
Research Ethics Committee. Of these, 54 subjects were excluded on
the basis of being underweight (BMI < 18.5kgm�1), under the age of
20, or for reasons of poor MR image quality (see below). Subject de-
mographics are detailed in Table 1. The mean age was 54 years (range
20e87), and mean BMI was 26 kg/m2 (18.5e45.5). The final cohort
included 246 (51%) lean controls (BMI between 18.5e25 kgm�2), 150
overweight subjects (31%; BMI 25e30 kgm�2), and 77 obese subjects
(BMI >30 kgm�2). There was a significant positive correlation be-
tween age and BMI (r ¼ 0.24, p < 0.001). Various health and lifestyle
factors were recorded including self-reported history of diagnosis of
diabetes, stroke, cancer, myocardial infarction, high blood pressure,
and high cholesterol. A self-report questionnaire was used to calcu-
lated total estimated physical activity per week (measures as kJ/d/Kg).
Education level was binarized to those with or without degree-level
qualifications. Gross household income was also included, defined
as those above and below a threshold income of £30,000. There were
no incidences of Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis. Cognitive

 performance was quantified using Cattell Culture Fair (scale 2, form A)
(Shafto et al., 2014).
2.2. MR acquisition and image analysis
2.2.1. MR acquisition
Structural images were acquired on a 3T Siemens TIM Trio system
employing a 32-channel head coil. A high resolution 3D T1-weighted
structural image was acquired using a magnetization prepared rapid
gradient echo sequence with the following parameters: repetition
time ¼ 2250 milliseconds; echo time ¼ 2.99 milliseconds; inversion
time ¼ 900 milliseconds; flip angle ¼ 9�; field of view ¼ 256 mm �
240 mm � 192 mm; voxel size ¼ 1 mm isotropic; GRAPPA (general-
ized
autocalibrating
partially
parallel
acquisitions)
acceleration
factor ¼ 2; acquisition time of 4 minutes and 32 seconds.
2.2.2. Cortical reconstruction and structural measures
Cortical reconstructions were generated using the software Free-
Surfer (Dale et al.,1999; Fischl et al.,1999a; Fischl and Dale, 2000). The
FreeSurfer program was specifically developed for cortical recon-
struction and has been extensively validated (Han et al., 2006;
Kuperberg et al., 2003; Rosas et al., 2002). Measures of cerebral
white-matter volume and intracranial volume were generated. We
further quantified whole-brain cerebral surface area, which was
based on the pial surface, and whole-brain cortical thickness, which
was taken as the mean thickness across each hemisphere, where
thickness was first estimated at each vertex in the reconstruction
measured as the minimum distance between the grayewhite and pial
surfaces. Surface reconstruction processes were conducted in native
space. Examples of gray-white-matter segmentation for representa-
tive age-matched lean and obese subjects are included in Fig. 1. All
reconstructions were quality controlled (see below).
2.2.3. Quality assurance
All reconstructions were qualitativelyassessed bya single rater (LR)
and categorized as “good” (n ¼ 411, 81%), “adequate” (n ¼ 62, 12%), or
“poor” (n ¼ 33, 7%). There was a statistically significant interaction
betweenageandqualityofsurfacereconstruction(z¼ �8.6,p< 0.001),
with older subjects more likely to have poor reconstruction quality.
Because manual edits of the entire data set was unfeasible, we
decided to test the effect of edits on a subsample of the data. For this,
manual edits were done on 100 brains chosen at random, and the
cortical reconstructions recomputed. New values of cortical surface
area, thickness, and white-matter volume were these generated and
contrasted to the original, unedited values. Bland and Altman plots
(Supplementary Figure 1) and linear regression were used to assess
the variability and bias of values pre-editing and postediting (Bland
and Altman, 1986). Results suggest that for reconstructions deemed
“good” and “adequate”, editing did not statistically significantly affect
morphometric values (white-matter volume F ¼ 2.9, p ¼ 0.09; sur-
face area F ¼ 1.7, p ¼ 0.2; thickness F ¼ 0.7, p ¼ 0.4). The mean dif-
ference between pre-edits and postedits for each measure was zero,
indicating no bias between measurements. On this basis we excluded
all reconstructions deemed “poor” (n ¼ 33).
2.2.4. Regional analysis of thickness and surface area
Cortical thickness was further explored at a regional level using
FreeSurfer. Each individual cortical reconstruction was aligned to a
template using a hierarchical spherical averaging method (Fischl et al.,
1999b). Thereafter, group (lean vs. overweight or obese)-by-age in-
teractions were explored using a general linear model with total
intracranial volume and gray-white-matter contrast (see Section 2.3
below) as covariates. Monte Carlo correction (10,000 iterations, p <
0.01) was used to account for multiple comparisons at the cluster-level.
2.3. Statistical analysis
Previous studies have demonstrated although the cortex ages
linearly, white-matter volume has a nonlinear aging trajectory. For
this reason, we used penalized spline mixed-effect models to
describe the age-dependent variation in each measure. Details of
these methods have been described elsewhere (Alexander-Bloch
et al., 2014; Wood and Scheipl, 2015). Data were Box-Cox-
transformed and mean-centered where appropriate to control for
non-normal distribution and mean-centering, respectively. All anal-
ysis was done in R (version 3.2, www.cran.r-project.org) using the
packages nlme, methcomp, and gamm4 (Wood and Scheipl, 2015).

 All brain parameters were controlled for the effects of sex and
total intracranial volume (derived from the FreeSurfer pipeline).
There were no hemispheric differences for any measure (i.e., white-
matter volume, cortical surface area, and thickness); thus, left and
right data of each measure were aggregated into a single value per
subject. Independent parameters for the following were included as
regressors: self-reported diagnosis of high blood pressure, diabetes,
cancer, myocardial infarction, stroke, and high cholesterol. Socio-
demographic parameters such as education level as well as house-
hold income were additionally included, as were self-reported levels
of physical activity per week. The numbers of individuals who
described themselves as current smokers were low (Table 1) and did
not differ across groups, thus smoking was not included as a covar-
iate. Mindful of the potential confound of cognitive decline in older
subjects, we repeated our regression analysis using cognitive scores
from the Cattell measure as an additional regressor.
As well as total intracranial volume, cortical thickness was addi-
tionally corrected for grayewhite-matter percentage. This latter
parameter is derived from the gray-scale values of cortical gray
matter and the cerebral white-matter and is used as a surrogate of
myelination changes, which are hypothesized to affect the contrast
between tissue types and thus may confound measures of thickness
(Grydeland et al., 2013; Storsve et al., 2014; Westlye et al., 2009).
2.3.1. Estimating brain age in lean and overweight/obese
To compute the white mattererelated age difference between lean
and overweight or obese, we again divided the data into 2 categories
basedonweight(i.e.,leanvs.overweightorobese).Wethenusedspline
methods(seeabove)tomodelthewhite-mattervolumeforeachgroup.
In turn, these models were used to estimate the difference in brain age
between the 2 groups. To do this, we calculated the mean difference in
age between the groups for every white-matter volume. For example,
for the volume 445 cm3, the model for lean subjects indicated a cor-
responding age of 60 years,whereas the model foroverweightorobese
subjects indicated a corresponding age of 50 years. Thus, we estimated
a difference in brain age of 10 years for this age range.
Because of the sensitivity of splines to outliers (Supplementary
Figure 2), we further generated CIs for these values. In doing this,
analysis was limited to the age range 37e87 years to obviate diffi-
culties in subtracting a maturational increase (in overweight or obese
subjects) from a decrease (in lean subjects) (owing to inverted
U-shaped trajectory of the data). In other words, we aimed to prevent
the situation of comparing data from mature overweight and obese
subjects with data from younger, lean adults with the same volume.
For example, owing to the inverted-U shape, lean subjects have an
average white-matter volume of 445 cm3 at 26 years and 60 years,
whereas overweight and obese subjects have the same volume at
50 years. Thus, by excluding subjects below 37 years, we can ensure
that our calculation of brain age difference between groups is based
on subjects with the same degree of maturity. We also set the
following limitations (1) prevent bootstrapping from finding ages
younger than max of inverted-U; (2) set to zero if obese is larger than
normal; and (3) if there is no one old enough, then set to last age
when there was someone old enough. Bootstrapping was performed
for 10,000 iterations. We then calculate the 95% and 90% CIs.
3. Results
3.1. White matter volume
In line with previous studies, subjects showed a nonlinear change
in white-matter volume with age, increasing to a maximum in
middle-age, and decreasing thereafter (Fig. 2A; F ¼ 25, p < 0.0001).
Critically, there was a statistically significant age:BMI interaction
(t ¼ �3, p ¼ 0.003). The inclusion of Cattell cognitive scores did not
affect this result. Comparing models of white-matter volume be-
tween lean and overweight or obese subjects, we estimated an
average increase in brain age associated with adiposity of approxi-
mately 10 years, with slight increases in middle-age subjects
(approximately 40 years) (Fig. 2B).
Detailed examination of the data revealed that a previous diagnosis
of elevated cholesterol (as described in self-reported health question-
naire) independently negatively impacted on white-matter volume
over and above the effects of age and BMI (t ¼ �2.3, p ¼ 0.02), sug-
gesting that some common metabolic comorbidities associated with
obesity may have an additional and distinct role in increasing sus-
ceptibility to neurodegeneration. However, there was no evidence of a
mitigating effect of exercise, income, or education on the BMI-related
impact on brain structure when other factors were taken in to account.
3.2. Cortical surface area
There was a significant negative effect of age on cortical
surface area (based on the pial surface) for each adiposity group
(F ¼ 191, p < 0.0001). However, there was no BMI-related dif-
ference in total cortical surface area and no age:BMI interaction
(Fig. 3A) even after including Cattell scores as an additional
regressor.
3.3. Cortical thickness
Like surface area, cortical thickness also decreased in a
near-linear trajectory across the lifespan for both groups (Fig. 3B;

overweight (BMI 25e30 kgm�2), and obese (BMI >30 kgm�2). The difference in “brain
age” between the groups was calculated by comparing the difference in age between
groups for each value of white-matter volume. For example, at 50 years, overweight or
obese subjects have an estimated volume white-matter volume of 445 cm3 whereas
lean subjects reach the same volume at the average age of 60 years, equating to an
average 10 years increased brain age for overweight or obese subjects. (B) Estimated

 F ¼ 338, p < 0.0001), however, overweight and obese subjects had
increased mean thickness compared to lean controls (t ¼ 2.2, p ¼
0.03). There was no age:BMI interaction, even after including
Cattell scores as an additional regressor.
To investigate the group differences in cortical thickness further,
we performed a per-vertex analysis. There were no statistically
significant regional changes in thickness between the groups and
no age:BMI interactions at a regional level.
3.4. Cognitive scores
Cattell scores were available for 463 of the 473 subjects included
in the analysis. Scores displayed a significant nonlinear decline with
age (F ¼ 79, p < 0.001) and were independently predicted by brain
size (t ¼ 4.4, p < 0.001), however, there were no trait (BMI) or
trajectory (age:BMI) effects between lean and overweight or obese
individuals (Fig. 3C).
4. Discussion
These results indicate that obesity has a modulating impact on
age-related brain structural changes. We thus provide direct evi-
dence of a relationship that has been strongly suggested by prior
epidemiological and biological work. Strikingly, the overall effects
of obesity are redolent of those seen with normal aging. In showing
obesity-related alterations in global brain structure, our data sup-
port the idea that, like aging, obesity’s impact is widespread across
the brain. Specifically, our results indicate that increased body mass
has a differential effect on brain tissue type, with differences only
observed in cerebral white-matter volume and not cortical gray
matter. These effects were determined to be maximal in middle-age
(approximately 40 years) and equivalent to an increase in white
matterebased brain age of 10 years in overweight and obese adults.
Although
the
exact
biological
mechanisms
are
complex
(Arnoldussen et al., 2014; Bruce-Keller et al., 2009; Cai, 2013; Chung
et al., 2009),1 suggestion is that proinflammatory cytokines (such as
interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-a) and associated hormones
such as leptin, produced by adipose tissue, elicit an inflammatory
response in microglia which prompts a self-sustaining feedback
loop of more cytokines and more inflammation (Arnoldussen et al.,
2014; Griffin, 2006; Wilson et al., 2002; Wisse, 2004). These in turn
have been linked to white-matter changes (Bolzenius et al., 2013;
Kullmann et al., 2015). This biological mechanism suggests that
the initial insult of obesity may lead to self-perpetuating damage,
which is manifested as structural changes akin to those seen in
normal aging. However, it is also observed that obesity itself in-
creases the susceptibility to neurodegeneration (Sriram et al., 2002).
Indeed, epidemiological studies suggest that obese people have
increased complications and mortality associated with traumatic
brain injury compared with lean subjects (Chabok et al., 2013). Thus,
it may be that obesity represents an initial insult to the brain that
precipitates a cascade of pathologic changes or that it leads to an
increased susceptibility to normal aging mechanisms.
Interestingly, our data suggest that middle-age (approximately
40 years) rather than later life may represent a particular period of
vulnerability to the effects of increased adiposity. Multiple studies
have linked the onset of white-matter changes to middle-age
(Bartzokis et al., 2004; Fotenos et al., 2005), and indeed, previous
analyses have also related later life structural and cognitive changes
to vascular risk factors in midlife (Debette et al., 2011). Moreover,
white-matter hyperintensities, a common marker of normal aging,
are not usually present in adults before midlife, further empha-
sizing this as a period of rapid age-related changes (Hopkins et al.,
2006). The susceptibility of cerebral white matter to adiposity-
related influences may be related to the biology of oligodendro-
cytes, which continue to differentiate into the 50th decade and are
particularly vulnerable to insults (Bartzokis, 2004). The finding that
increased body mass equates to an average brain age increase of
10 years further stress the need to tackle obesity, particularly in
early adult life. Interventions such as caloric restriction indicate the
potential efficacy in preventing or amelioration normal age-related
degeneration (Colman et al., 2014). Other studies have suggested
that socioeconomic and lifestyle factors which covary with obesity
such as income (Sattler et al., 2012), education (Stern et al., 1992),
and exercise (Radak et al., 2010; Scarmeas et al., 2009) have all been
associated as risk factors for cognitive decline or increased risk of
neurodegeneration, however, our analysis failed to find such links.
We did find that self-reported hypertension was significantly
negatively associated with white-matter volume, suggesting that
comorbidities associated with obesity may independently influence
neurogeneration. Moreover, although we confirmed that age and
brain
structure
were
significant

 cognition, we did not find a mediating pathologic effect of body
mass on this relationship.
Normal age-related white-matter breakdown has been observed
independent of changes or loss of neurons or synapses suggesting
that white-matter variations associated with obesity do not
necessarily imply associated cortical changes (Bartzokis et al.,
2004). This is in line with our results which demonstrated a dif-
ferential effect of adiposity on cortical gray and cerebral white
matter. However, unexpectedly, our cortical thickness measures
indicated significantly less thinning in overweight or obese subjects
compared with lean controls. Why this might be is unclear. One
possible explanation is that the accuracy of the thickness measures
are compromised by myelination changes associated with normal
aging, which affect the gray-white contrast ratio. As explored
elsewhere (Grydeland et al., 2013; Storsve et al., 2014; Westlye
et al., 2009), this may have the effect of blurring the boundary
between gray and white matter, leading to an artifactual increase in
measured cortical thickness. If such myelin changes are augmented
in obesity, it may be that this will give rise to apparent reduced rates
of cortical thinning with age in overweight and obese subjects. In
our experiment, we attempted to account for the possible myelin-
related confounds on cortical thickness. However, if such effects
are significantly increased beyond that observed in normal aging, it
may be that this correction is insufficient. In summary, although it is
possible that adiposity is associated with an increase in cortical
thickness, we must conservatively consider the possibility that
these results reflect an artifact of tissue contrast as a product of
demyelination effects. The possible confounds associated with
cortex-based measures in obesity, as well as the differential effects
of its comorbidities on white matter (Verstynen et al., 2013) high-
light the subtleties in assessing BMI-related effects on brain
structure.
To date there is some evidence in support of the obesity paradox
in terms of morbidity and mortality, in that some studies seem to
suggest that obesity may in fact be protective. However, the specific
relation to neurodegeneration is unclear. Indeed, although some
studies have suggested that weight loss may actually precede de-
mentia (Knopman et al., 2007), other studies suggest that increased
adiposity is linked to poorer cognition (Whitmer, 2005). In this
study, we failed to find any such link using the Cattell battery, which
is used to capture fluid intelligence by measuring abstract
reasoning ability. Although crystallized intelligence increases with
age, fluid intelligence decreases with declining brain function (Horn
and Cattell, 1967; Salthouse, 2009). Although previous studies have
linked white-matter integrity, processing speed and fluid intelli-
gence (Kievit et al., 2016), our results suggest that BMI does not
additionally influence the age and brain structure relationship with
cognition. More generally, differences in demographic, clinical (e.g.,
cognitive status), and socioeconomic variables controlled for may
also contribute to the heterogeneity in the literature regarding the
relationship
between
adiposity
and
neurodegeneration
in
population-based studies. Similarly the precise way in which
adiposity is measured may also be an important consideration. In
this study, we used the commonly applied and readily measured
variable BMI, however, recent studies indicate that adiposity
measured
in
this
way
may
misclassify
subjects
as
car-
diometabiolocally unhealthy (Tomiyama et al., 2016). Moreover,
BMI is insensitive to the more clinically relevant distribution of fat
on the body, and thus may mask important effects. For example,
although waist circumference has been shown to be predictive of
cognitive decline, overall obesity has been demonstrated to be
neuroprotective in the same sample (West and Haan, 2009). In this
study, the absence of more direct measures of relevant health pa-
rameters, it is not clear whether our results reflect a relationship
between increased adiposity and white-matter volume, or whether
BMI is simply a proxy for more fundamental covariates. The use of
BMI as a measure of adiposity in this study must be considered a
limitation. Finally, the omission of extremely obese subjects (due to
scanner limitations) may also be considered to be a limitation of
this analysis, potentially obfuscating the true scale of the effect of
adiposity on brain age.
Finally, it is important to acknowledge the cross-sectional nature
of this analysis and the associated limitations when trying to infer
rates of brain aging. Although it is not possible to definitively state
that obesity is associated with an increased rate of neuro-
degeneration, our results however do indicate that across the adult
lifespan, an increase in body mass is associated with significantly
less cerebral white-matter volume compared with age-matched
lean controls and that this change is augmented with increasing
age. Previous studies have established the similarity between cross-
sectional and longitudinal results when assessing brain structural
change with age (Fotenos et al., 2005), which may support the
hypothesis that increased adiposity may be associated with
increased rates of brain aging, however, a longitudinal analysis
taking into account change in body mass as well as brain structure
is required to fully establish this link.
5. Conclusion
In the global climate of an increasingly aged population, with
rising levels of obesity, it is critical to establish the full health impact
of an increased body mass. The results of our study suggest that
increased adiposity has a significant impact on brain structure that
it modulates the relationship between white-matter volume and
age and that such effects may be equivalent to an increase in brain
age of up to 10 years in overweight and obese individuals. These
results support the hypothesis that adiposity confers a significant
risk of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.
