SUMMARY
Tumor relapse is associated with dismal prognosis, but responsible biological principles remain incompletely
understood. To isolate and characterize relapse-inducing cells, we used genetic engineering and prolifera-
tion-sensitive dyes in patient-derived xenografts of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We identified a
rare subpopulation that resembled relapse-inducing cells with combined properties of long-term dormancy,
treatment resistance, and stemness. Single-cell and bulk expression profiling revealed their similarity to pri-
mary ALL cells isolated from pediatric and adult patients at minimal residual disease (MRD). Therapeutically
adverse characteristics were reversible, as resistant, dormant cells became sensitive to treatment and
started proliferating when dissociated from the in vivo environment. Our data suggest that ALL patients might
profit from therapeutic strategies that release MRD cells from the niche.
Significance
After initially successful chemotherapy, relapse frequently jeopardizes the outcome of cancer patients. To improve the
prognosis of ALL patients, treatment strategies that eliminate tumor cells at minimal residual disease (MRD) and prevent
relapse are required. Toward a better understanding of the underlying biology, we established preclinical mouse models
mimicking MRD and relapse in patients. Primary and surrogate MRD cells shared major similarities in expression profiles,
demonstrating the suitability of our model. MRD cells revealed major functional plasticity in vivo and treatment resistance
was reversible; MRD cells became sensitive toward treatment once released from their in vivo environment. Effective ther-
apeutic strategies might aim at dissociating persistent cells from their protective niche to prevent relapse in ALL patients.

 INTRODUCTION
Relapse represents a major threat for patients with cancer. After
initially successful treatment, rare tumor cells might survive and
re-initiate the malignant disease with dismal outcome. Acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is associated with poor prognosis
in infants and adult patients and is the most frequent malignancy
in children (Inaba et al., 2013). In many patients, the majority of
ALL cells respond to chemotherapy but a minority display resis-
tance, survive therapy, and cause relapse with poor outcome
(Gokbuget et al., 2012).
Despite its clinical importance, basic biologic conditions
underlying relapse remain partially elusive. For example, it is un-
clear whether relapse-inducing cells exist before onset of treat-
ment or develop as result of therapy, and whether permanent
or reversible characteristics determine relapse-inducing cells
(Kunz et al., 2015). Of translational importance, understanding
basic mechanisms opens perspectives for effective therapies
to eradicate relapse-inducing cells.
Relapse-inducing cells, by their clinical definition, self-renew
and give rise to entire tumors indicating tumor-initiating poten-
tial, a typical characteristic of cancer stem cells (Essers and
Trumpp, 2010). In numerous tumor entities including acute
myeloid leukemia, cancer stem cells were identified as a bio-
logically distinct subpopulation that displays specific surface
markers, has leukemia-inducing potential in mice, and gives
rise to a hierarchy of descendant cells that lack such properties
(Bonnet and Dick, 1997; Visvader and Lindeman, 2008). In ALL,
however, many different subpopulations display stem cell prop-
erties; neither a stem cell hierarchy nor phenotypic markers
defining stem cells could be identified (Kong et al., 2008; le Vi-
seur et al., 2008; Rehe et al., 2013). Thus, up to now, stemness
represents an insufficient criterion to define the subpopulation
of relapse-inducing cells in ALL.
An additional feature of relapse-inducing cells is their treat-
ment resistance, as, again by definition, they survive chemo-
therapy and eventually give rise to relapse with decreased
chemosensitivity. Resistance against chemotherapy is closely
related to dormancy as chemotherapy mainly targets prolifera-
tion-associated processes that are inactive in dormant cells
(Clevers, 2011; Zhou et al., 2009). Dormant cells, by definition,
do not divide or divide very slowly over prolonged periods of
time, might survive chemotherapy, persist in minimal residual
disease (MRD), and give rise to relapse (Schillert et al., 2013;
Schrappe, 2014). Indeed, an increased frequency of non-
dividing tumor cells has been described in patients after chemo-
therapy for defined subtypes of ALL (Lutz et al., 2013).
So far, technical obstacles have hampered characterizing
phenotypic and functional features of relapse-inducing cells in
ALL in detail. Established ALL cell lines represent inappropriate
models as they display continuous proliferation. In patients,
relapse-inducing cells are very rare and defining cell surface
markers that reliably identify these rare ALL cells from the multi-
plicity of normal bone marrow cells remains intricate, at least in
certain ALL subtypes (Hong et al., 2008; Ravandi et al., 2016).
Moreover, primary ALL cells do not grow ex vivo, disabling their
amplification in culture.
An attractive possibility to experimentally study patients’
tumor cells in vivo is the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model,
which uses immuno-compromised mice to expand tumor cells
from patients (Kamel-Reid et al., 1989). As shown previously,
PDX ALL cells retain important characteristics of primary ALL
cells (Castro Alves et al., 2012; Schmitz et al., 2011; Terziyska
et al., 2012). While PDX models are mostly used for preclinical
treatment trials (Gao et al., 2015; Townsend et al., 2016), we
used them here to study relapse-inducing cells in ALL.
RESULTS
To characterize the challenging subpopulation of relapse-in-
ducing cells in ALL, we used the individualized xenograft mouse
model as a preclinical model, molecular cell marking as an
unbiased approach, and in vivo dormancy as a functional bench-
mark. To mimic the heterogeneity of ALL, samples from nine
different ALL patients were studied including children and adults,
B cell precursor-ALL and T-ALL, first diagnosis, and relapse
(Table S1).
Molecular Marking Allows Unbiased, Sensitive Isolation
of Rare PDX ALL Cells
To study ALL growth starting very early after disease onset in the
PDX mouse model, the technical challenge consisted in reliably
enriching very low numbers of human ALL cells from mouse
bone marrow. As expression levels of endogenous surface anti-
gens across potentially relevant, but yet undefined, subpopula-
tions are unknown, we used lentiviral transduction for unbiased
molecular marking and in vivo imaging (Figure 1A).
PDX ALL cells were lentivirally transduced to express a
luciferase for in vivo imaging (Terziyska et al., 2012), an artificial
antigen (truncated nerve growth factor receptor [NGFR]) for
magneto-activated cell sorting (Fehse et al., 1997) and a red
fluorochrome for cell sorting by flow cytometry (Figures S1A
and S1B). Transgenes allowed effective and reliable enrichment
of minute numbers of PDX cells from mouse bone marrow in
this two-step procedure. Quantification of PDX cells isolated
with the magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS)/fluorescence-
activated cell sorting approach closely correlated with other
methods monitoring leukemic proliferation, such as in vivo imag-
ing and flow cytometry-based quantification of leukemia cells
(Figure S1C). Quality controls showed that the procedure was
highly efficient and reliable with minor cell loss (Table S2).
The procedure enabled addressing basic questions with
translational potential in ALL biology. Homing capacity of PDX
cells to mouse bone marrow differed by more than two orders
of magnitude between the nine samples studied (Figure 1B).
Homing efficiency decreased significantly when smaller cell
numbers were injected (Figure S1D). These data argue in favor
of sample-specific characteristics determining homing, and
against the presence of a preformed, fixed number of leukemia
homing sites within the niche. Spontaneous growth of PDX
ALL cells in mouse bone marrow was logarithmic over the first
2 weeks of in vivo growth (Figures 1C and S1C). Growth slowed
down thereafter and as early as at 10% blasts in bone marrow,
when space restriction appears unlikely to be causative. Model
selection indicated overall logistic growth which is typical for
insufficient nutrient supply (Figure S1E). Thus, PDX ALL cells
show sample-specific homing followed by logistic growth in
mouse bone marrow.

 CFSE Staining Allows Reliable Monitoring of PDX ALL
Growth in Mice
Proliferation-dependent dyes such as bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)
remain stable in mice over several months, enabling the charac-
terization of a heterogeneous growth pattern in normal hemato-
poiesis (Takizawa et al., 2011). We adapted the use of these
dyes in PDX tumor models. As BrdU staining requires the perme-
abilization and destroying of cells, fluorescent CFSE was mainly
used as it allows flow cytometric enrichment of living cells for
functional experiments including re-transplantation. Loss of
CFSE was used to distinguish subpopulations of slowly and
rapidly growing cells (Figures 1D and S1F) that were called la-
bel-retaining cells (LRC) and non-label-retaining cells (non-LRC),
respectively (Takizawa et al., 2011). LRC were defined as those
cells that had undergone at most three CFSE bisections resem-
bling cell divisions (see the Supplemental Experimental Proced-
ures for details). Loss of CFSE tightly correlated with increase in
PDX cell numbers and loss of BrdU (Figures 1E and S1G) and
confirmed that PDX ALL cells grow in vivo, but not ex vivo (Fig-
ure S1H). Thus, CFSE staining represents a reliable approach to
monitor proliferation of PDX ALL cells in mice.

Monitoring of PDX ALL Growth in Mice

ALL cells expressing several transgenes, staining

stained PDX cells from mouse bone marrow.
(B) Of each PDX sample, 107 triple transgenic PDX
cells were injected intravenously into mice and re-
isolated from the bone marrow 3 days later; each
dot represents data from one mouse, except that a
mean of eight mice plus SE is shown for samples
ALL-199 and ALL-265.

mice per time point; shown is mean and SE.
(D) Gating strategy defining LRC, non-LRC, and
others. MFI of CFSE at the start of the experiment
(3 days after cell injection) was divided by factor 2
to model bisections; upon no more than three bi-
sections, cells were considered as LRC, upon
more than seven bisections as non-LRC; inter-
mediate cells were considered as others.
(E) Similar experiment as in (C), except that the
donor mouse was fed with BrdU in the last 7 days
before cell harvesting. Each dot represents data
from one mouse.

A Rare, Long-Term Dormant
Subpopulation Exists in ALL PDX
Cells
Importantly, CFSE staining disclosed the
existenceofararefractionofPDXALLcells
that hardly divided over prolonged periods
of time (Figure 2A). LRC, by definition, had
undergone no more than three cell divi-
sions within 21 days, during which the leu-
kemia burden had risen by several orders
of magnitude so that mice would succumb to leukemia within a
few days. Inall nine PDX ALL samples studied, LRC were identified
after prolonged periods of leukemic growth; (Figures 2B and S2A).
Thus, similarly to normal hematopoiesis (Trumpp et al., 2010),
PDX ALL contains a rare subpopulation of LRC. LRC might
resemble the dormant tumor cells described in ALL patients
(Figure S2B) (Lutz et al., 2013). As an advantage over work
with primary cells, our preclinical approach allows repetitive
work on pure, vivid LRC, which gave us the chance to function-
ally and phenotypically characterize this interesting population.
LRC Localize to the Endosteum, but Are Not Enriched for
Stem Cells
Both normal hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia stem cells
were reported to preferentially localize close to the endosteum,
where a supportive niche might exist (Morrison and Spradling,
2008). We also found that LRCs preferentially localized close
to the endosteum (Figures 3A–3C and S3), suggesting that
they might use the same niche as normal hematopoietic stem
cells and cancer stem cells.
We therefore asked whether LRC might resemble cancer stem
cells. To compare leukemia-initiating potential between LRC and
Cancer Cell 30, 849–862, December 12, 2016
851
 non-LRC, we performed limiting dilution transplantation assays
and monitored engraftment by bioluminescence in a total of 83
mice (Table S3). To our surprise, we found highly similar stem
cell frequencies in LRC and non-LRC and similar engraftment
rates after transplantation of, e.g., ten cells per mouse (Fig-
ure 3D). The 95% confidence interval of the estimated frequency
of leukemia-inducing cells ranged between 1/19 and 1/84 cells
for LRC and between 1/40 and 1/179 cells in non-LRC of ALL-
265 (Table S3). Similar findings were obtained for ALL-199 (Table
S3). Thus, although only LRC display typical characteristics of
stem cells such as reduced proliferation rate and localization
close to the endosteum, LRC and non-LRC exhibited similar
leukemia-initiating potential.
LRC Survive Systemic Drug Treatment In Vivo
Dormant cells are known for their resistance against drug treat-
ment, complicating elimination by anti-cancer therapy (Essers
and Trumpp, 2010). We compared in vivo drug response of
LRC and non-LRC by transplanting CFSE-labeled PDX ALL cells,
treating mice with systemic chemotherapy on day 7 and
analyzing surviving LRC and non-LRC on day 10 (Figure 4A).
Chemotherapy reduced the overall leukemic burden by over
90% (Figures 4B and S4A) and eradicated most non-LRC. As a
prominent difference, most LRC survived chemotherapy so
that LRC increased in relative proportions (Figures 4C–4E and
S4B–S4D). A 10- to 100-fold less efficient elimination of LRC
compared with non-LRC became obvious across all PDX ALL

 samples tested that were derived from either primary disease or
relapse, suggesting that this phenomenon is not restricted to a
certain disease stage. Treatment-surviving LRC harbored leuke-
mia-initiating potential as they gave rise to leukemias upon re-
transplantation at a kinetic similar to that of untreated LRC
(Figures 4F and S4E).
Taken together, LRC share the most important functional fea-
tures that impede the cure of cancer: (1) dormancy, (2) in vivo
drug resistance, and (3) leukemia-initiating potential. LRC might
thus serve as preclinical surrogate for relapse-inducing cells
in ALL.

and non-LRC, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
wasperformed onsingle cells and bulkpopula-
tions (Figure 5A). Data from single cells corre-
lated with data from bulk populations and
different ALL PDX samples showed similar
expression profiles (Figures S5A and S5B).
Preliminary expression arrays on pools of 40
LRC and non-LRC showed mainly similar re-
sults (data not shown).
Single LRC differed consistently from single
non-LRC as revealed by clustering differently
expressed genes (Figures 5B and Table S4)
and by a principle component analysis of the
most variable genes (Figure 5C). Single LRC
also had an overall reduced RNA content (Fig-
ure S5C), indicating a less active metabolism
that is a prerequisite of dormant cells. We
combined single-cell and bulk data of all six
sample pairs to identify differently expressed
genes (Table S5). Enrichment analysis re-
vealed that genes expressed less in LRC
were most strongly enriched in cell cycle and DNA replication
and that genes more expressed in LRC were most strongly en-
riched in cell adhesion (Figures 5D, S5D, and Table S6). Hence,
expression profiling of single cells and in bulk confirmed the
quiescent state of LRC and an LRC signature of at least 2-fold
differently expressed genes ranked by their significance (Figures
5E and Table S5) was used for further comparisons.
LRC Resemble MRD Cells in the PDX Mouse Model
Relapse often results from treatment-resistant tumor cells that
survive chemotherapy and persist at MRD. MRD cells contain
a major fraction of dormant tumor cells (Lutz et al., 2013).
Here, we hypothesized that LRC might represent surrogates
for MRD cells.
To experimentally test this hypothesis, we established a pre-
clinical model of MRD for ALL-265 and ALL-199. When untreated
Cancer Cell 30, 849–862, December 12, 2016
853
 control samples were harvested at advanced leukemia, they
contained a leukemic burden of �30% human blasts in mouse
bone marrow, mimicking the situation at diagnosis. Remaining
mice received a systemic treatment with conventional chemo-
therapeutic drugs over 2–3 weeks (Figure 6A), which needs care-
ful dosing as supportive therapy is mainly unfeasible in mice. A
combination treatment of vincristine and cyclophosphamide
reduced tumor burden substantially according to in vivo imaging
(Figures 6B, 6C, and S6A). Postmortem analysis revealed that
chemotherapy had reduced leukemic burden by more than two
orders of magnitude to �0.1% leukemia cells in bone marrow.
This resembled not only complete morphologic, but also com-
plete molecular remission criteria (Figures 6D and S6B). MRD
cells revealed relapse-inducing potential as they re-grew in
mice when treatment was stopped (Figure S6C).
MRD cells were isolated from mouse bone marrow using ex-
pressed transgenes as above, and RNA sequencing of single
cells and bulk samples was performed. Resulting transcriptomes
showed marked differences between MRD and untreated con-
trol cells (Figure S6D). Enrichment analysis revealed significantly
reduced expression of MYC and E2F target genes in MRD
compared with untreated cells. Genes expressed less in MRD
cells were most strongly enriched in cell cycle and DNA replica-
tion, while genes expressed more in MRD cells were most
strongly enriched in cell adhesion (Figures 6E and S6E). This sug-
gests a dormant phenotype of MRD cells similar to the dormant
phenotype seen in LRC (Figure 5D). KEGG pathway analysis

highlighted
that
MRD
cells
were
of
dormant nature and expressed increased
adhesion molecules (Figure S6E). Indeed,
single MRD cells clustered together with
single LRC in a principal component
analysis separated from non-LRC and
cells from untreated mice (Figure S6F).
Accordingly, the LRC signature (Figure 5E
and Table S5) was strongly enriched in MRD cells and genes in
MRD and LRC cells were similarly regulated compared with their
respective controls (Figure 6F). This suggests that LRC mimic
MRD cells in our preclinical mouse model.
LRC Resemble Primary MRD Cells from Patients
To relate these findings to the clinical situation, expression pro-
files from primary tumor cells from five children and two adults
with B cell precursor (BCP) ALL were profiled at diagnosis and
at MRD (Figure 7A and Table S7). Children and adults were
treated according to the BFM-2009 and GMALL-0703 protocols,
respectively, and MRD cells were enriched by flow cytometry at
days 33 and 71 of treatment, respectively. In adults, we chose
BCR-ABL-positive ALL and enriched the subpopulation of
StemB cells at MRD, as Lutz et al. (2013) had shown that these
cells exhibit a dormant phenotype. As dormancy in StemB cells
might have persisted for a long period during treatment in pa-
tients, LRC might especially resemble StemB cells at MRD. We
could obtain single-cell transcriptomes from one patient and
one bulk transcriptome from another patient. K-means clustering
and principal component analysis revealed that single StemB
cells clustered together with single LRC and MRD cells, while
single non-LRC clustered together with single untreated control
cells (Figures 7B and 7C). The bulk StemB sample was distinct
from diagnostic tumor cells of untreated adult patients with
BCR-ABL-positive ALL (Figure S7A). Although limited by small
cell and sample numbers, the data indicate that LRC resemble

 the dormant subpopulation of StemB cells in adult ALL patients
at MRD.
This is also supported when comparing the LRC profiles with
further published transcriptomes. Genes differently expressed
in CD34-positive chronic myeloid leukemia cells (Graham et al.,
2007), in leukemia stem cells (Saito et al., 2010), in hematopoietic
stem cells (Eppert et al., 2011; Georgantas et al., 2004), as well
as in pediatric ALL cells with high risk of relapse (Kang et al.,
2010) were all significantly enriched in LRC versus non-LRC cells
(Figures 7D, S7B, and S7C).
To further analyze the similarity of LRC to MRD cells from
patients, we generated bulk transcriptomes of primary samples
from five children with BCP-ALL before the onset of treatment
and three matched MRD samples collected 33 days after the
onset of treatment. Expression profiles differed significantly be-
tween diagnosis and MRD (Figure 7E and Table S8) and MRD
cells regulated genes in the same direction as LRC compared
with their respective controls, as revealed by a significant
overlap of up- and downregulated genes (hypergeometric test,
p = 1.9 3 10�23) and by a significant enrichment of the LRC
signature (p < 0.001; Figure 7F). Finally, we combined these tran-
scriptomes with all bulk samples isolated from the LRC and MRD
mouse models and analyzed them unsupervised in a principal
component analysis (Figure 7G). The first principal component
separated all dormant and drug-resistant cells (PDX-LRC,
PDX-MRD, and primary MRD) from all control cells (PDX-non-
LRC, PDX untreated, and primary diagnosis).
In summary, we show that a distinct subpopulation of LRC
exists in our ALL PDX model that combines the unfavorable char-
acteristics of stemness, drug resistance, and dormancy. These
LRC show high similarities to MRD cells in our mouse model
and to MRD cells in ALL patients. Hence, LRC might represent
preclinical surrogates for relapse-inducing cells in patients and
could be used to develop therapeutic strategies to prevent
relapse.
Release from the Environment Induces Proliferation
in LRC
As the first step toward therapies, we studied whether unfavor-
able drug resistance and dormancy represented permanent or
reversible features in LRC. Dormancy and drug resistance might
exist as genuine, constant biological characteristics of a special
ALL subpopulation or as reversible functional phenotypes of
putatively every ALL cell depending on the context.
To address this question, LRC and non-LRC were dissociated
from their environment, isolated, and re-transplanted into recip-
ient mice (Figures 8A and S8A). When non-LRC were re-stained
with CFSE and re-transplanted at high numbers, they gave rise
to an identical LRC population as re-transplanted bulk cells (Fig-
ures 8B and S8A); transplantation of high cell numbers of LRC
was impossible, as only low numbers of LRC can be recovered
from mice. When low cell numbers were re-transplanted, LRC,
non-LRC, and bulk cells initiated identical leukemic growth in
mice as monitored by bioluminescence in vivo imaging (Figures
8C and S8A). These data indicate that dormancy represents a
reversible feature of LRC, as LRC lose their dormant nature
once they are retrieved from their specific environment and
transferred into a different surrounding.
Release from the Environment Sensitizes LRC and MRD
Cells for Drug Treatment
As dormancy emerged as a reversible phenotype, we asked
whether drug resistance might be equally reversible. Isolated
LRC and non-LRC or MRD and previously untreated cells from
the PDX mouse model were treated ex vivo with common ALL
chemotherapy drugs or drug controls. Here, the technical chal-
lenge lay in the very minor cell numbers of LRC and MRD that
can be isolated from mice and used for ex vivo experiments (Fig-
ure S8B). Co-culture with feeder cells resembling bone marrow
stroma reduced drug response in all samples, suggesting the in-
fluence of the bone marrow environment on drug resistance (Fig-
ures S8C–S8F) (Tesfai et al., 2012). Ex vivo, neither LRC nor MRD
cells displayed increased drug resistance compared with their
respective controls (Figures 8D and S8G).
Taken together, LRC and MRD cells showed a marked gain in
drug sensitivity ex vivo compared with in vivo after isolation from
the bone marrow environment. Both LRC and MRD cells lost
their enhanced drug resistance, distinguishing them from non-
LRC or untreated cells, once they were retrieved from their in vivo
environment and cultured ex vivo (Figure 8E). Dormancy was
reversible in LRC and drug resistance was reversible in both
LRC and MRD cells. As LRC might represent surrogates for
relapse-inducing cells in patients, our data suggest that the inter-
action between LRC and their environment represents an attrac-
tive therapeutic target for preventing relapse. Relapse-inducing
cells might gain sensitivity toward treatment once mobilized
from their in vivo environment.
DISCUSSION
The present work aimed at a better understanding of the cells
that induce relapse in ALL and thereby limit prognosis of pa-
tients. We identified a rare, long-term dormant subpopulation
termed LRC exhibiting the adverse characteristics of dormancy,
in vivo drug resistance, and leukemia-initiating properties. LRC
highly resemble primary MRD cells from adult and pediatric pa-
tients with ALL. MRD cells require preferential eradication by
anti-leukemia treatment. LRC in preclinical models can now be
used as surrogates for relapse-inducing cells in patients for
developing therapies to prevent relapse. Upon removal from
their in vivo environment, LRC lost dormancy and drug resis-
tance, suggesting a reversible nature of adverse characteristics
and an important role for the interaction between ALL and the
environment. The data suggest that drug resistance and
dormancy are linked and represent an acquired stem-like
phenotype. Our data imply developing treatment approaches
that dissociate ALL cells from their protective niche to sensitize
them toward anti-leukemia treatment.

 Here, we provide a preclinical tool to study dormant human
ALL cells in vivo and show that long-term resting cells exist in
ALL. This fact was previously unknown, as primary patients’
samples allow quantifying non-cycling cells in a snapshot at a
given moment, but fail to distinguish between short- and long-
term resting cells (Lutz et al., 2013). As monitoring functionally
defined cellular subpopulations such as LRC in longitudinal
studies is still impossible in patients, our preclinical model en-
ables the gaining of insights into ALL biology that cannot be ob-
tained in patients: here the presence of long-term resting cells in
ALL. Beyond its use in preclinical treatment trials, PDX models
harbor major potential in basic research and enable unique in-
sights into disease biology.
The emergence of relapse is a complex process involving ge-
netic and non-genetic factors. Early relapse might be caused by
a putatively pre-existing clone with additional mutations respon-
sible for drug resistance, especially in adult patients. The genetic
stability of most cases of ALL suggests that many relapses may
not be mediated by mutational mechanisms. Late relapse might
be caused by persisting, dormant tumor cells in the absence of
additional mutations, and relapse cells often respond to the iden-
tical drugs used to treat the primary disease. LRC represent sur-
rogates for late relapse and relapse in the absence of additional
mutations, as often seen in children.
The fact that LRC exist might explain why ALL patients benefit
from maintenance therapy, even in prognostically favorable,

 chemo-sensitive ALL subtypes. ALL patients are routinely treated
with oral low-dose chemotherapy from end of intensive chemo-
therapy until, e.g., 2 years after diagnosis, and maintenance ther-
apy improves patients’ prognosis (Schrappe et al., 2000). Low-
dose maintenance therapy might act by removing LRC-type
ALL cells with relapse-inducing potential that remained quiescent
over prolonged periods of time and turned on their cell cycle at
late time points in the months following intensive chemotherapy.
Tumor cells often display both dormancy and drug resistance.
It is unclear whether either dormancy or drug resistance is pivotal
in respect to the other, so that dormancy is a consequence of
resistance or vice versa (Blatter and Rottenberg, 2015). Our
two complementary mouse models show that LRC were defined
by their dormant nature and displayed drug resistance, while
MRD cells were defined by their ability to survive drug treatment
and displayed a dormant phenotype. Thus, both characteristics
might be equally sufficient to determine each other and coincide
interdependently.
Our study shows that ALL consists of functionally heteroge-
neous cells regarding proliferation rate and drug resistance,
similar to the functional heterogeneity shown in other tumor
entities (Kreso et al., 2013). As LRC did not substantially
participate in proliferation during growth of leukemia over
weeks, in our model LRC existed before onset of therapy
and were not developed as a consequence of treatment. As
both LRC and non-LRC contain similar amounts of stem cells,
but show different sensitivity toward drug treatment in vivo,
our data imply that stemness and drug resistance are not
directly connected in ALL.
So how does a rare subpopulation acquire the three clinically
challenging features dormancy, resistance, and stemness? LRC
might represent a cell subpopulation with genuinely different
biology harboring distinct intrinsic, constant characteristics, or
being an LRC might represent a reversible, temporary, functional
phenotype depending on circumstances. In the first case, LRC
and non-LRC might be organized in a hierarchical way similar
to the known stem cell hierarchy existing in many tumors
including AML (Kreso and Dick, 2014). In the second case, ALL
cells might mimic the phenotypic reversibility of normal hemato-
poiesis, where long-term dormant hematopoietic stem cells start
cycling in response to stress for a defined period of time and turn
back into dormancy later (Trumpp et al., 2010).
Our data favor the second scenario as LRC exhibit their
specific characteristics as reversible, temporary, transient func-
tional phenotypes. Re-transplantation experiments showed that
formerly dormant LRC started proliferating as soon as they were
dissociated from their in vivo environment and transferred into
next recipient mice. Upon re-transplantation, LRC converted
into non-LRC, while certain non-LRC converted into LRC. Both
LRC and non-LRC thus harbored plasticity to switch between
slow and rapid proliferation depending on the current context.
This fact might explain the area of overlap between LRC and
non-LRC detected in single-cell RNA sequencing.
Besides proliferation, drug resistance also proved to be a tran-
sient characteristic. Drug-treatment experiments showed that
LRC lost their in vivo drug resistance upon ex vivo culture. The
discrepancy between drug sensitivity ex vivo and in vivo might
at least partly explain the limited predictability of ex vivo drug-
screening tests for the outcome of cancer patients (Wilding
and Bodmer, 2014). Thus, localization of LRC to the bone
marrow niche influences both dormancy and drug resistance.
These insights have translational implications. For diagnostics,
as LRC lose their clinically relevant characteristics upon release
from their niche, rapid sample processing might be critical for reli-
able profiling, which represents a challenge in clinical routine
(Bacher et al., 2010). Our data at least in part explain the limited
power of in vitro assays using, e.g., proliferating cell lines, for
studies on MRD cells or primary leukemia cells for drug testing
in the absence of feeders. Most importantly for putative treatment
strategies, the transient nature of the adverse characteristics of
LRC suggests aiming at removing MRD cells from their protective
environment to sensitize them toward treatment (Essers et al.,
2009; Essers and Trumpp, 2010). The interaction between
MRD cells and their bone marrow niche represents a promising
target for therapeutic approaches to prevent relapse. Beyond
the tumor cell itself, its interaction with the environment repre-
sents a suitable therapeutic target. As a caveat, a persistent ther-
apeutic inhibition of the bone marrow niche might be required
over prolonged periods of time, as in principle each and every re-
maining non-LRC ALL cell could convert into a drug-resistant
LRC, as soon as it gets access to the protective niche.
At this point, we can only speculate which signals might deter-
mine whether an ALL cell behaves like an LRC or a non-LRC. In
theory, external as well as internal factors or conditions might be
influential; stimuli might be sent or received either stochastically
or within a well-regulated process. As our studies were restricted
to bone marrow, the bone marrow niche is a likely candidate for a
regulatory function and requires investigatory work (Raaij-
makers, 2011). Further research is required to address these
important questions. Obvious candidates for therapeutic inter-
vention are cell surface molecules expressed on LRC, the
inhibition of which might release cells from their environment.
Similarly, niche cells could be targeted to aim at reducing envi-
ronmental support.
Our study shows that ALL growing in vivo contains a rare
subpopulation of LRC that exhibits typical challenging adverse
characteristics of relapse induction, which proved to be of a
reversible nature. Our model might help to develop future anti-
leukemia treatment strategies allowing the eradication of the
precarious subpopulation of drug-resistant stem cells to prevent
relapse and improve the prognosis of patients with ALL.

 Enriching and Quantifying PDX and LRC from Mouse
Bone Marrow
PDX ALL cells were genetically engineered as described using
lentiviruses (Terziyska et al., 2012; Vick et al., 2015) to express
the transgenes’ truncated NGFR, a red fluorochrome, and lucif-
erase; cells were stained with BrdU and/or CFSE before re-
transplantation of fresh cells into mice.
For determining the fraction of dormant PDX ALL cells, mouse
bone marrow was harvested from numerous bones and enriched
for human PDX ALL cells using NGFR for MACS and the red fluo-
rochrome for flow cytometry cell sorting. LRC were discrimi-
nated from non-LRC using CFSE staining as shown in Figure 1D.
CFSE mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured at day 3
after injection, when bleaching had ceased, and defined cells
before the onset of proliferation (‘‘0 divisions’’). Day 3 CFSE
MFI was divided by factor 2 to calculate CFSE bisections
mimicking cell divisions. Seven CFSE MFI bisections or more
were defined as entire loss of the CFSE signal characterizing
non-LRC. The LRC gate was set to include all cells harboring
high CFSE signal of below three bisections of the maximum
CFSE MFI (Schillert et al., 2013) (Figure 1D).
PDX Single-Cell RNA-Seq Library Construction
Single cells were isolated at 4�C and processed on the Fluidigm
C1 platform. In brief, 500 cells were loaded on the 10–17 mm
mRNA-seq IFC (Fluidigm) with External RNA Controls Con-
sortium spike-in controls. Cell lysis, reverse transcription, and
pre-amplification of cDNA was done on-chip using the SMARTer
Ultra Low RNA Kit for C1 (Clontech). Harvested cDNA libraries of
the samples (2.5 mL) were used as input for tagmentation with the
Nextera XT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) at half the volume of
Illumina’s protocol. Barcoding PCR was performed for 12 cycles.
Equal amounts of libraries were pooled.
RNA-Seq
Single-cell Smart-seq and bulk Smart-seq2 libraries were
sequenced at 1 3 50 bases on an Illumina HiSeq1500. SCRB-
seq and UMI-seq libraries were sequenced paired-end with 16
cycles on the first read to decode sample barcodes and unique
molecular identifiers and 50 cycles on the second read into the
cDNA fragment.
