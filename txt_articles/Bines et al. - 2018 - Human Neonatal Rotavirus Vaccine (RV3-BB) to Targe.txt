BACKGROUND
A strategy of administering a neonatal rotavirus vaccine at birth to target early preven-
tion of rotavirus gastroenteritis may address some of the barriers to global implementa-
tion of a rotavirus vaccine.
METHODS
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Indonesia to evaluate 
the efficacy of an oral human neonatal rotavirus vaccine (RV3-BB) in preventing rotavirus 
gastroenteritis. Healthy newborns received three doses of RV3-BB, administered according 
to a neonatal schedule (0 to 5 days, 8 weeks, and 14 weeks of age) or an infant schedule 
(8 weeks, 14 weeks, and 18 weeks of age), or placebo. The primary analysis was conducted 
in the per-protocol population, which included only participants who received all four doses 
of vaccine or placebo within the visit windows, with secondary analyses performed in the 
intention-to-treat population, which included all participants who underwent randomization.
RESULTS
Among the 1513 participants in the per-protocol population, severe rotavirus gastroen-
teritis occurred up to the age of 18 months in 5.6% of the participants in the placebo 
group (28 of 504 babies), in 1.4% in the neonatal-schedule vaccine group (7 of 498), and 
in 2.7% in the infant-schedule vaccine group (14 of 511). This resulted in a vaccine ef-
ficacy of 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 91) in the neonatal-schedule group 
(P<0.001), 51% (95% CI, 7 to 76) in the infant-schedule group (P 
= 
0.03), and 63% (95% 
CI, 34 to 80) in the neonatal-schedule and infant-schedule groups combined (combined 
vaccine group) (P<0.001). Similar results were observed in the intention-to-treat analysis 
(1649 participants); the vaccine efficacy was 68% (95% CI, 35 to 86) in the neonatal-
schedule group (P 
= 
0.001), 52% (95% CI, 11 to 76) in the infant-schedule group (P 
= 
0.02), 
and 60% (95% CI, 31 to 76) in the combined vaccine group (P<0.001). Vaccine response, 
as evidenced by serum immune response or shedding of RV3-BB in the stool, occurred 
in 78 of 83 participants (94%) in the neonatal-schedule group and in 83 of 84 partici-
pants (99%) in the infant-schedule group. The incidence of adverse events was similar 
across the groups. No episodes of intussusception occurred within the 21-day risk pe-
riod after administration of any dose of vaccine or placebo, and one episode of intus-
susception occurred 114 days after the third dose of vaccine in the infant-schedule group.
CONCLUSIONS
RV3-BB was efficacious in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis when adminis-
tered according to a neonatal or an infant schedule in Indonesia. (Funded by the Bill

espite evidence of the success of 
rotavirus vaccines, more than 90 million 
infants still lack access to a rotavirus 
vaccine.1,2 Barriers to global implementation of 
the vaccine include cost, suboptimal efficacy in 
low-income countries, and lingering safety con-
cerns.3,4 An oral rotavirus vaccine administered 
at birth has the potential to address some of 
these challenges.
Rotavirus disease occurs early in life in infants 
in low-income countries.5 A rotavirus vaccine 
administered at birth could provide early protec-
tion and could maximize the opportunity to 
complete a full vaccine schedule.6 Administra-
tion of an oral vaccine at the time of birth pre-
sents a unique opportunity that may assist the 
uptake of the vaccine, since the presence of 
gastric acid is limited at birth, and environmen-
tal enteropathy is not yet established.7,8 Because 
intussusception is rare in newborns, administra-
tion of the vaccine at birth may offer a safety 
advantage.9
The oral human neonatal rotavirus vaccine 
(RV3-BB) was developed from the human neona-
tal rotavirus strain RV3 (G3P[6]), which was 
identified in the stool of infants with asympto-
matic infection.10 Wild-type infection with RV3 
was reported to provide protection from severe 
gastroenteritis in the first 3 years of life and 
resulted in strong heterotypic serologic responses 
to community rotavirus strains.11,12 RV3 appears 
to be naturally attenuated and adapted to the 
newborn gut; it has been shown to replicate ef-
fectively despite the presence of maternal anti-
bodies and despite the baby being breast-fed.13 
Vaccination with RV3-BB is intended to take 
advantage of the intrinsic characteristics of this 
novel strain for use in a strategy of vaccination 
at the time of birth. In a phase 2a trial in New 
Zealand, RV3-BB was immunogenic when admin-
istered according to a neonatal or infant sched-
ule, and no safety concerns were identified.14
The primary objective of this trial was to as-
sess the efficacy of three doses of RV3-BB 
against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis up to the 
age of 18 months. Secondary objectives included 
assessment of the efficacy against severe rotavi-
rus gastroenteritis, immunogenicity, and safety 
of RV3-BB administered according to a neonatal 
schedule (first dose administered at 0 to 5 days 
of age) or an infant schedule (first dose admin-
istered at 8 to 10 weeks of age), with each of 
these trial groups compared with placebo. The 
vaccine efficacy was also assessed against rota-
virus gastroenteritis of any severity and against 
severe gastroenteritis of any cause, up to the age 
of 12 months.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
This phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, place-
bo-controlled trial involving 1649 participants 
was conducted from January 2013 through July 
2016 in primary health centers and hospitals in 
Central Java and Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Indone-
sia is a low-middle–income country; the per 
capita gross regional product in Yogyakarta and 
Central Java is $2,164 to $2,326 (in U.S. dollars), 
and the mortality rate is 30 to 38 deaths per 
1000 live births among children younger than 
5 years of age.15,16
The protocol, which is available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org, was approved 
by the ethics committees at Universitas Gadjah 
Mada, the Royal Children’s Hospital Melbourne, 
and the National Agency of Drug and Food Con-
trol, Republic of Indonesia. The use of a placebo 
was deemed to be acceptable because vaccina-
tion against rotavirus disease is not currently 
being implemented under the Indonesian Nation-
al Immunization Program and the cost of the 
vaccines limits private purchase.17
The trial was conducted in accordance with 
International Conference on Harmonisation Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines and was monitored by 
an independent contract research organization 
(Quintiles). The conduct of the trial was over-
seen by Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, 
with local input from PT Bio Farma. An indepen-
dent data and safety monitoring board regularly 
reviewed the safety data. Data management was 
performed by Biophics Thailand. Statistical analy-
sis was conducted by INC Research, Australia, 
and by an independent statistical consultant. The 
National Health and Medical Research Council, 
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and PT 
Bio Farma funded the trial but had no role in the 
trial design, data collection, or data interpreta-
tion, or in the decision to submit the manuscript 
for publication. All the authors reviewed the

pleteness of the data and analysis and for the 
fidelity of the trial to the protocol.
Participants, Randomization, and Blinding
Pregnant women provided preliminary written 
informed consent before a sample of cord blood 
was obtained. Final written informed consent 
was obtained from the parent or guardian after 
birth, before eligibility for the infant’s participa-
tion in the trial was confirmed. Infants were eli-
gible if they were healthy, full-term babies 0 to 
5 days of age who had a birth weight of 2.5 to 
4.0 kg. Eligible infants were randomly assigned, 
in a 1:1:1 ratio, to one of three groups: a neonatal-
schedule vaccine group, an infant-schedule vac-
cine group, or a placebo group. Randomization 
was performed according to a computer-generated 
code with a block size of 6, with stratification 
according to province. The doses of vaccine 
(RV3-BB) or placebo were drawn into syringes 
for dispensing by a pharmacist who was located 
at the central pharmacy in each province and 
was aware of the trial-group assignments. Inves-
tigators, trial monitors, data managers, statisti-
cians, and other trial staff, as well as the families 
of the participants, remained unaware of the trial-
group assignments for the duration of the trial.
Participants received four 1-ml oral doses of 
vaccine or placebo according to their trial-group 
assignment, with doses administered at 0 to 5 days 
of age (dose 1), 8 to 10 weeks of age (dose 2), 14 to 
16 weeks of age (dose 3), and 18 to 20 weeks of 
age (dose 4) (see Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available at NEJM.org). Each of the two 
vaccine groups received three doses of RV3-BB 
and one dose of placebo. In the neonatal-schedule 
vaccine group, doses 1, 2, and 3 were RV3-BB 
and dose 4 was placebo, and in the infant-
schedule vaccine group, dose 1 was placebo and 
doses 2, 3, and 4 were RV3-BB. Doses 2, 3, and 
4 were preceded by a 2-ml dose of an antacid 
solution (Mylanta Original). Feeding was with-
held for 30 minutes before and after each dose. 
The vaccine or placebo was administered at the 
same time as vaccines that were provided as part 
of the Indonesian National Immunization Pro-
gram. Participants were followed by means of 
weekly telephone contact and monthly visits 
until the age of 18 months. All the participants 
received oral polio vaccine, with the exception of 
a subgroup of 282 participants (the first cohort 
of participants recruited) who received an inac-
tivated polio vaccine.
Vaccine
Clinical trial lots of RV3-BB were prepared at 
Meridian Life Science to a titer of 8.3×106 to 
8.7×106 focus-forming units per milliliter in a 
serum-free medium that was supplemented with 
10% sucrose. Placebo consisted of the same me-
dium with 10% sucrose and was visually indis-
tinguishable from RV3-BB. Vials of vaccine or 
placebo were stored at −70°C until they were 
thawed within 6 hours before administration.
Efficacy
Gastroenteritis of any severity was defined as 
having three or more stools that were looser 
than normal for a given child within a 24-hour 
period. The severity of gastroenteritis was de-
fined on the basis of the Vesikari clinical sever-
ity scoring system (scores range from 0 to 20, 
with higher scores indicating more severe dis-
ease) that takes into account clinical symptoms 
(diarrhea and vomiting), clinical signs (elevated 
body temperature and dehydration), and type of 
treatment, if any.18 A modified Vesikari score 
was applied in cases in which intravenous, naso-
gastric rehydration or 6 hours of supervised oral 
rehydration was scored as hospitalization, regard-
less of whether the rehydration was adminis-
tered at a primary health center or at a hospital. 
Rotavirus gastroenteritis was defined as gastro-
enteritis coincident with the presence of rotavi-
rus antigen in the stool that was detected with 
the use of an enzyme-linked absorbent assay 
(ProSpecT Rotavirus Microplate Assay, Oxoid). 
Severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was defined as 
rotavirus gastroenteritis with a modified Vesikari 
score of at least 11.
Vaccine Response and Immunogenicity
Vaccine response (often called “vaccine take”), 
as evidenced by serum immune response or 
shedding of RV3-BB in the stool, was assessed 
in the first cohort recruited (282 participants). A 
blood sample was obtained from the cord (which 
represented baseline for the neonatal schedule), 
immediately before dose 2 of vaccine or placebo 
(which represented baseline for the infant sched-
ule), 28 days after dose 3, and 28 days after dose 4.

neutralizing antibody titers were measured with 
the use of previously described methods.14,19 The 
methods used to detect serologic responses to 
RV3-BB also detect responses to wild-type rota-
virus strains. To determine the background 
exposure to wild-type rotavirus strains, serum 
immune response and shedding of RV3-BB in 
the stool were also assessed in participants in 
the placebo group. The shedding of RV3-BB in the 
stool was detected with the use of a rotavirus 
VP6–specific reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-
chain-reaction assay and confirmed by sequence 
analysis.14 Vaccine response was defined quanti-
tatively as a serum immune response (a serum 
rotavirus IgA antibody titer or a serum neutral-
izing antibody titer three times as high as the 
titer at baseline) 28 days after administration of 
the vaccine or shedding of RV3-BB between days 
3 and 7 after administration of the vaccine. Cumu-
lative vaccine response was defined as evidence 
of vaccine response after dose 1, 2, or 3 in the 
neonatal-schedule vaccine group and after dose 
2, 3, or 4 in the infant-schedule vaccine group.
Safety
Vital signs were evaluated before, and in the 30 
minutes after, administration of the vaccine or 
placebo. Parents reported the participant’s tem-
perature and solicited gastrointestinal and sys-
temic symptoms on diary cards for 7 days after 
each dose. Parents were instructed to contact the 
trial staff immediately if blood was present in 
the stool so that further investigations to exclude 
intussusception, including ultrasonography, could 
be performed if clinically indicated. All unsolic-
ited adverse events that were reported up to 28 
days after administration of a dose of the vac-
cine or placebo were assessed according to the 
Division of AIDS grading table, version 1.0 (up-
dated August 2009)20 for the grading of labora-
tory abnormalities reported as adverse events 
and according to standard criteria defined in the 
protocol for the grading of clinical adverse 
events. A serious adverse event was defined as an 
adverse event that resulted in death or in new 
or prolonged hospitalization or was considered 
to be medically significant or life threatening and 
occurred within 28 days after a dose of vaccine 
or placebo. Causality and severity grading of 
adverse events were determined by the local In-
donesian investigators.
Statistical Analysis
In the primary analysis of efficacy, we compared 
the percentage of participants in the neonatal-
schedule vaccine group and infant-schedule vac-
cine group combined (combined vaccine group) 
who had an episode of severe rotavirus gastro-
enteritis during the period from 2 weeks after 
the administration of dose 4 through 18 months 
of age with the percentage in the placebo group 
who had such an episode during the same time 
period, using Pearson’s chi-square test. The pri-
mary analysis was conducted in the per-protocol 
population, which included only the participants 
who received all four doses of vaccine or placebo 
within the visit windows. In a secondary analy-
sis, which was conducted in the intention-to-
treat population (all participants who underwent 
randomization), we compared events of severe 
rotavirus gastroenteritis that occurred from ran-
domization through 18 months of age. Vaccine 
efficacy is presented as 1 minus the relative risk 
of an event in the vaccine group as compared 
with that in the placebo group and multiplied by 
100, and its exact 95% confidence interval was 
calculated with the use of the Clopper–Pearson 
method.21
Efficacy was assessed in the neonatal-sched-
ule vaccine group from 2 weeks after dose 3 of 
the vaccine to 12 months and to 18 months and 
in the infant-schedule vaccine group from 2 weeks 
after dose 4 of the vaccine to 12 months and to 
18 months. The assessment schedule resulted in 
two different presentations of data in the placebo 
group (denoted as neonatal-schedule placebo 
group and infant-schedule placebo group). In the 
analysis of vaccine response, data were consid-
ered to be missing for a given participant only if 
data on all the components of the outcome were 
missing for that participant. The Kaplan–Meier 
method was used to estimate the cumulative risk 
of a first episode of severe rotavirus gastroen-
teritis from the time of randomization, and the 
trial groups were compared with the use of a 
log-rank test. All statistical tests were two-sided.
On the basis of local surveillance data, we 
assumed that 3% of the participants in the pla-
cebo group would have an episode of severe ro-
tavirus gastroenteritis during the trial,22,23 and 
we calculated that an enrollment target of 549 
participants in each of the three trial groups 
would provide the trial with 80% power to reject

the null hypothesis of no difference between the 
combined vaccine group and the placebo group 
if the true efficacy of the vaccine was 60%, at 
a one-sided alpha level of 0.1. The estimated 
sample size would allow for a rate of nonadher-
ence to the trial regimen of 10%. We calculated 
that a minimum of 282 participants would be 
required to reject the null hypothesis of no dif-
ference in the percentage of participants with 
vaccine response, at a two-sided alpha level of 
0.05, assuming that 25% of participants in the 
placebo group would be exposed to rotavirus14 
and that 50% of the participants in each of the 
two vaccine groups would have vaccine response, 
and allowing for a rate of nonadherence of 10%.
Results
Of the 1649 newborns who underwent random-
ization (intention-to-treat population), 1640 re-
ceived at least one dose of vaccine or placebo 
(safety population) and 1588 (96%) were fol-
lowed until they were 18 months of age (Fig. 1). 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed in 
the 1513 participants (92%) who received all 
four doses of vaccine or placebo within the visit 
windows (per-protocol population). The demo-
graphic characteristics at baseline and the age of 
receipt of the first dose of vaccine or placebo 
were similar across the three trial groups (Table 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Vaccine Efficacy
In the per-protocol population, severe rotavirus 
gastroenteritis was reported in 28 of the 504 
participants (5.6%) in the placebo group as com-
pared with 21 of the 1009 participants (2.1%) in 
the combined vaccine group, resulting in a vac-
cine efficacy of 63% (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 34 to 80) at 18 months of age (P<0.001). 
Similar results were observed in the intention-
to-treat analysis (vaccine efficacy, 60%; 95% CI, 
31 to 76; P<0.001) (Table 1).
When three doses of RV3-BB were adminis-
tered according to the neonatal schedule, the 
vaccine efficacy against severe rotavirus gastro-
enteritis was 75% (95% CI, 44 to 91; P<0.001) 
at 18 months of age (Table 1) and 94% (95% CI, 
56 to 99; P 
= 
0.006) at 12 months of age (Table 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The vaccine 
efficacy against rotavirus gastroenteritis of any 
severity in the neonatal-schedule vaccine group 
at 18 months of age was 63% (95% CI, 37 to 81; 
P<0.001) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
In the infant-schedule vaccine group, the vac-
cine efficacy against severe rotavirus gastroen-
teritis was 51% (95% CI, 7 to 76; P 
= 
0.03) at 18 
months of age (Table 1) and 77% (95% CI, 31 to 
92; P 
= 
0.008) at 12 months of age (Table S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The vaccine effi-
cacy against rotavirus gastroenteritis of any se-
verity at 18 months of age when RV3-BB was 
administered according to the infant schedule 
was 45% (95% CI, 12 to 69; P 
= 
0.01) (Table S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
The time from randomization to the first 
episode of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was 
significantly longer among the participants who 
received RV3-BB than among those who received 
placebo (Fig. 2). G3P[8] rotavirus was detected 
in the stool of 46 of the 49 participants in whom 
severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was reported.
Vaccine Response and Immunogenicity
Cumulative vaccine response (a serum immune 
response or shedding of RV3-BB in the stool af-
ter the administration of any dose of RV3-BB) 
was detected in 78 of 83 participants (94%) in 
the neonatal-schedule vaccine group and in 83 of 
84 participants (99%) in the infant-schedule vac-
cine group. The difference in the proportion of 
participants who had a cumulative vaccine re-
sponse between the neonatal-schedule vaccine 
group and the neonatal-schedule placebo group 
was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.64; P<0.001), and the 
difference in the proportions between the infant-
schedule vaccine group and the infant-schedule 
placebo group was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.63; 
P<0.001) (Fig. 3, and Table S3 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). A cumulative serum immune 
response was observed after the administration 
of any dose of RV3-BB in 76% of the participants 
in the neonatal-schedule vaccine group and in 
87% of the participants in the infant-schedule 
vaccine group. A serum IgA response was ob-
served in 66% of the participants in the neonatal-
schedule vaccine group and in 81% of the par-
ticipants in the infant-schedule vaccine group. 
After the administration of two doses, cumula-
tive vaccine response was observed in 87% of the 
participants in the infant-schedule vaccine group

as compared with 28% of the participants in the 
infant-schedule placebo group; the difference in 
the proportions of participants who had a cumu-
lative vaccine response was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.45 to 
0.71; P<0.001). This comparison could not be 
evaluated in the neonatal-schedule vaccine group 
because no blood sample was obtained at that 
time point. RV3-BB shedding was detected in 
69% of the participants in the neonatal-schedule 
vaccine group and in 75% of the participants in 
the infant-schedule vaccine group.
Safety
The incidence of serious adverse events (Table 2) 
and unsolicited and solicited adverse events was 
similar across the trial groups (Tables S4 and S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 11 
participants died (5 in the neonatal-schedule 
Figure 3. Cumulative Vaccine Response.
The cumulative vaccine response is presented according to the dose administration schedule in each vaccine group 
and the placebo group (Panels A and B) and according to individual components of vaccine response in the neona‑
tal‑schedule vaccine group and the infant‑schedule vaccine group (Panels C and D). Vaccine response was defined 
quantitatively as a serum immune response (a serum rotavirus IgA antibody titer or a serum neutralizing antibody 
titer three times as high as the titer at baseline) 28 days after administration of the vaccine or shedding of RV3‑BB 
between days 3 and 7 after administration of the vaccine. Cumulative vaccine response was defined as evidence of 
vaccine response after dose 1, 2, or 3 in the neonatal‑schedule vaccine group and after dose 2, 3, or 4 in the infant‑
schedule vaccine group. In the neonatal‑schedule vaccine group, doses 1, 2, and 3 were RV3‑BB and dose 4 was pla‑
cebo, and in the infant‑schedule vaccine group, dose 1 was placebo and doses 2, 3, and 4 were RV3‑BB. No assess‑
ment of serum immune response was conducted after administration of dose 2, which corresponded to the second 
dose of RV3‑BB in the neonatal‑schedule vaccine group and to the first dose of RV3‑BB in the infant‑schedule vac‑
cine group.

Human Neonatal Rotavirus Vaccine (RV3-BB)
vaccine group and 6 in the placebo group); the 
serious adverse events that resulted in death are 
listed in Table S6 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix. No episodes of intussusception were reported 
within the 21-day risk period after administra-
tion of any dose of vaccine or placebo, and one 
episode of intussusception occurred 114 days 
after the third dose of vaccine in the infant-
schedule vaccine group.
Discussion
Our results showed that the human neonatal 
vaccine RV3-BB provided protection against se-
vere rotavirus gastroenteritis. When administered 
according to the neonatal schedule, RV3-BB had 
a vaccine efficacy of 94% at 12 months of age 
and 75% at 18 months of age, findings that sup-
port the administration of RV3-BB starting from 
the time of birth. These results compare favor-
ably with the results of studies of licensed vac-
cines that were evaluated in similar low-income 
and low-middle–income countries in which the 
disease burden is high. The administration of 
two doses of Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline) had a 
combined 1-year and 2-year vaccine efficacy of 
34% in Malawi.24 When a three-dose schedule 
was implemented, the combined 1-year and

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
2-year vaccine efficacy of Rotarix was 42.3% (in 
Malawi),24 that of RotaTeq (Merck) was 17.6 to 
63.9% (in Mali, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Ghana, 
and Kenya),25,26 and that of Rotavac (Bharat Bio-
tech) was 55.1% (in India).27 Administration of 
three doses of Rotasil (Serum Institute of India) 
resulted in a vaccine efficacy of 66.7% after a 
mean follow-up of 9.8 months in Niger.28
The concept of vaccination at the time of 
birth is not new. Birth is an established immu-
nization time point in many countries. The use 
of a neonatal dose was investigated in the early 
phase of development of the rotavirus vaccine 
but was not pursued because of concerns regard-
ing inadequate immune responses and safety.29-31 
The VP4 proteins of human neonatal P[6] rotavi-
rus strains have specific residues at the basal 
surface of VP8* that may allow them to adhere 
to cell-surface receptors in the newborn gut.32 
This characteristic may provide an advantage for 
the strategy of vaccination at the time of birth. 
The P[6] VP4 protein of RV3-BB may also offer 
an advantage in Africa and Asia where the 
Lewis-negative phenotype is common.33 Lewis 
(FUT3) and secretor (FUT2) genes appear to me-
diate susceptibility to rotavirus infection.33 P[8] 
rotaviruses infect only persons who are Lewis-
positive and secretor-positive, whereas P[6] rota-
viruses infect persons irrespective of the Lewis 
or secretor status.34 This phenomenon may ex-
plain the high prevalence of disease caused by 
P[6] rotaviruses in Africa and the lower efficacy 
of vaccines with a P[8] genotype in this region.35 
RV3-BB is currently the only vaccine with a P[6] 
VP4 protein.
The incidence of adverse events was similar in 
the vaccine and placebo groups, and there were 
no evident safety concerns. Because intussuscep-
tion is rare in newborns, the administration of a 
rotavirus vaccine at the time of birth may offer 
a safety advantage.9 On the basis of a global base-
line risk of intussusception that is estimated at 
74 cases per 100,000 children younger than 1 year 
of age, we anticipated that 1.22 cases of intus-
susception would occur in our trial cohort.36 
Consistent with this estimate, one case of intus-
susception was identified in an 8.5-month-old 
infant in the infant-schedule vaccine group; the 
episode occurred 114 days after the third dose 
of vaccine. No episodes of intussusception were 
reported within the 21-day risk period37 after 
administration of any dose of vaccine or placebo. 
However, this trial was not powered to detect 
the risk of a rare adverse event such as intus-
susception.
Unlike IgG, IgA is not transferred through 
the placenta, and the immune system of a new-
born may not produce a significant serum IgA 
response after the administration of an oral vac-
cine, such as RV3-BB, at birth, despite evidence 
that the neonatal schedule is efficacious.38 Simi-
lar dissonance has been shown with other vac-
cines administered during the newborn period.39 
An equinelike G3P[8] strain of rotavirus was 
responsible for most of the episodes of severe 
gastroenteritis in this trial and reflects the 
global emergence of this strain.40 On the basis of 
the strong heterotypic serologic responses to 
community strains (G1 or G2 dominant) pro-
vided by the parent strain RV3,11,12 it is antici-
pated that RV3-BB will also offer protection 
against a range of circulating rotavirus strains, 
but this assumption could not be assessed in the 
current trial.
Despite the success of rotavirus vaccines, 
challenges to global implementation remain and 
will need to be overcome if all infants are to be 
protected against rotavirus disease.
