Objective To evaluate a potential reduction in injury 
related healthcare costs when using the ’11+ Kids’ injury 
prevention programme compared with a usual warmup 
in children’s football.
Methods This cost effectiveness analysis was based 
on data collected in a cluster randomised controlled 
trial over one season from football teams (under-9 to 
under-13 age groups) in Switzerland. The intervention 
group (INT) replaced their usual warmup with ’11+ 
Kids’, while the control group (CON) warmed up as 
usual. Injuries, healthcare resource use and football 
exposure (in hours) were collected prospectively. We 
calculated the mean injury related costs in Swiss Francs 
(CHF) per 1000 hours of football. We calculated the cost 
effectiveness (the direct net healthcare costs divided by 
the net health effects of the ’11+ Kids’ intervention) 
based on the actual data in our study (trial based) and 
for a countrywide implementation scenario (model 
based).
results Costs per 1000 hours of exposure were 
CHF228.34 (95% CI 137.45, 335.77) in the INT group 
and CHF469.00 (95% CI 273.30, 691.11) in the CON 
group. The cost difference per 1000 hours of exposure 
was CHF−240.66 (95%CI −406.89, −74.32). A 
countrywide implementation would reduce healthcare 
costs in Switzerland by CHF1.48 million per year. 
1002 players with a mean age of 10.9 (SD 1.2) years 
participated. During 76 373 hours of football, 99 injuries 
occurred.
Conclusion The ’11+ Kids’ programme reduced the 
healthcare costs by 51% and was dominant (ie, the INT 
group had lower costs and a lower injury risk) compared 
with a usual warmup. This provides a compelling case for 
widespread implementation.
InTrOduCTIOn 
A physically active lifestyle and active participa-
tion in sport at a young age can promote lifelong 
healthy active behaviour.1–3 Football (soccer) is one 
of the most popular sports worldwide, and a suit-
able physical activity setting for children.4 Although 
there are many health benefits of sport participa-
tion, sport is the main cause of injury in children 
and adolescents.5–9 Injuries in young athletes can 
reduce current and future involvement in phys-
ical activity and lead to substantial healthcare and 
societal costs.10 11 This economic burden associated 
with injury involves medical, financial and human 
resources at many levels.11–13
The football specific warmup and injury preven-
tion programme, ‘11+’, prevents injuries in recre-
ational youth football.14–17 There is, however, a 
dearth of data on sport injury prevention in chil-
dren.18 Based on our epidemiological data,19 20 
we developed and evaluated an injury prevention 
programme for children’s football (‘11+ Kids’).21 
In a randomised controlled trial, this warmup 
programme reduced the overall injury risk in chil-
dren’s football by 48% and the risk for severe inju-
ries by 74%.22 Here we report the cost effectiveness 
study that ran alongside that randomised controlled 
trial.22
Our cost effectiveness analysis compared direct 
healthcare costs of the ‘11+ Kids’ intervention 
group with costs in a control group who undertook 
their usual warmup.22 The intervention was inves-
tigated from a societal perspective, considering all 
relevant costs and effects, regardless of who pays or 
who benefits from the effects.
MeThOds
sample, design and data acquisition
We followed the CHEERS statement for the 
reporting of this cost effectiveness analysis.23 Study 
participants were boys and girls, aged 7–12 years, 
participating in the 2014/2015 football season 
(August to June). Boys and girls train and compete 
together in these age categories. Healthcare 
resource use was collected prospectively in the Swiss 
study arm of a cluster randomised controlled trial. 
This trial was conducted to test the efficacy of the 
‘11+ Kids’ injury prevention programme compared 
with a regular warmup programme in children’s 
football. The study involved four countries (Swit-
zerland, The Netherlands, Germany and the Czech 
Republic). The primary outcome was the potential 
reduction of all football related injuries. The study 
(

complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was 
approved by the local ethics committee (Ethikkom-
mission Nordwest- und Zentralschweiz, EKNZ, 
approval No 2014–232). All children and their 
parents received written information about the 
project prior to the start of the study. Participation 
was voluntary and all parents of injured children 
gave their active consent. Study specific details of 
the randomised controlled trial are described in the

beginning of each training session throughout the season. The 
‘11+ Kids’ is a 15 
min warmup programme designed to prevent 
injuries in children’s football, consisting of seven different exer-
cises each with five levels of difficulty.22 The exercises focus on 
dynamic stability, power, core strength and falling techniques. 
‘11+ Kids’ has been proven to be efficacious in preventing inju-
ries.22 Participants in the control group (CON) performed their 
usual warmup routine.
Outcome measures
Injury
During the football season, football related injuries that resulted 
in at least one of the following were recorded and followed-up 
by the research coordinators for up to 3 
months following the 
end of the season19: (a) inability to complete the current match 
or training session and/or (b) absence from subsequent training 
sessions or matches and/or (c) injury requiring medical atten-
tion. Injury type, location and mechanism as well as time loss 
(ie, absence from sport participation) were documented via an 
internet based injury registration platform. Coaches entered 
injuries on a weekly basis. Directly after an injury was entered 
in the online system, study coordinators contacted coaches, 
parents and injured children to get more details on the injuries 
using a standardised questionnaire. Injuries were followed-up on 
a weekly basis at least until the child was back in training. In 
the case of an injury, parents forwarded the medical diagnosis 
and cost relevant information to the study coordinators.
Healthcare resource use and costs
Costs considered included direct healthcare costs and interven-
tion costs. Intervention costs included actual expenses for the 
printed manuals and the organisation of instruction courses for 
the coaches, and potential opportunity costs of coaches due to 
their attendance at the ‘11+ Kids’ instruction course (table 1, 
for further information see online supplementary material 1).24 
We used the sum of these costs and the number of players to 
calculate the total intervention costs per player (ie, player 
season).
The healthcare resource use of injured players (ie, infor-
mation on the number of visits to healthcare professionals, 
medical examinations, treatments and equipment used by 
injured players) was derived by contacting the parents of 
injured children via telephone. We applied the cost analysis 
from a healthcare perspective (direct costs). Standardised 
medical fees according to the national medical association 
(‘Tarmed’, V
.1.08) enabled a precise estimation of the medical 
treatment costs of injuries.25 This approach has been applied 
previously and allowed for valuing the healthcare resources 
used (eg, visits to physicians, X-rays, casts).24 Out of pocket 
healthcare costs borne by the parents of injured players (eg, 
physical therapy, braces and visit to a chiropractor) were esti-
mated based on the prices of various providers of such services 
and products. All costs are reported in Swiss Francs (CHF, 
2015).
Projected costs and health effects for a nationwide 
implementation scenario of ‘11+ Kids’ in switzerland 
(model based scenario)
In a further analysis, we estimated the costs of a nationwide 
implementation of ‘11+ Kids’ in Switzerland (table 1). These 
costs include expenses for printing and shipping the ‘11+ Kids’ 
manual, organisation of instruction courses to reach foot-
ball coaches (including time expenditure for travel), loss of 
productivity during attendance of the course as well as the 
development and hosting of a website to provide the digital 
version of the manual over a time horizon of 5 seasons (see 
online supplementary material 1). We estimated a 50% turn-
over of coaches (ie, new coaches replacing coaches who retire/
resign) over the course of 5 seasons. Therefore, we multi-
plied the costs for the manuals and the courses by an infla-
tion factor of 1.5. The resulting overall costs for the printed 
manuals, education courses and the website were CHF568 
533 over a 5 season period. Based on the actual number of 
players in children’s football in Switzerland (58 622 in the 
2014/2015 season), this relates to CHF9.70 per player over a 
5 season period and CHF1.94 per player season.
statistical analysis
We calculated the mean cost per player (ie, player season) as 
the total cost in each group divided by the total number of 
players in each group, as well as the mean cost per injured 
player as the total cost in each group divided by the total 
number of injured players in each group. Further, we calcu-
lated the cost of injuries per 1000 hours of football exposure 
in each group. To obtain the corresponding 95% CI, we used 
non-parametric bootstrapping with 1000 samples to account 
for the skewed cost distributions.24
We calculated injury incidence density for both groups with 
corresponding 95% CI. Further, we analysed the time to event 
data using a mixed effects Cox model. The model accounted 
for clustering effects on team level and allowed analysis of 
multiple injuries to individual players while accounting for 
potential correlations on the intra-person level. We used age 
and age adjusted body height as covariates, as described previ-
ously.20 22
Cost effectiveness analysis
We calculated the differences in mean cost per player (ie, player 
season), mean cost per injured player and cost per 1000 hours 
of football exposure between the INT and CON groups.

We estimated the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
to summarise the cost effectiveness of ‘11+ Kids’ and created 
cost effectiveness planes (figures 1 and 2).24 26 The ICER is the 
difference in cost per player between the INT and CON groups, 
divided by the difference in the number of injuries per player 
between the INT and CON groups. We calculated the ICERs 
for the ‘trial based’ data (figure 1) and for the ‘model based’ 
(countrywide implementation) scenario (figure 2).

showed lower costs and a lower injury incidence density. In 
contrast, the northwest quadrant (dominated) indicates that the 
intervention leads to higher costs and a higher injury incidence 
density. The southwest quadrant indicates that the intervention is 
less effective but less expensive and the northeast quadrant indi-
cates that the intervention is more effective but more expensive.
If the intervention was ‘dominant’, an ICER was not calcu-
lated. We applied the cost evaluation with a time horizon of one 
football season and from a societal perspective, considering all 
relevant costs and effects, regardless of who pays or who benefits 
from the effects.
resulTs
Initially, 846 clubs in Switzerland were invited to participate. A 
total of 55 clubs (with 78 teams) agreed to take part in the study 
and were randomised according to the age groups of the teams 
and the size of the club. In total, 62 teams with 1002 players 
completed the study (for study flow of participants, see online 
supplementary material 2). Anthropometric characteristics were 
similar in the INT and CON groups. During the study period, 
99 injuries (INT=42 injuries, CON=57 injuries) occurred, of 
which 53 were medically treated (table 2). For more details on 
injury characteristics (number, percentage and injury incidence 
density by injury location, type and mechanism for the INT 
and CON groups) and intervention effects on injury risk, see 
online supplementary material 2. T
wo of these 53 injuries were 
sustained by girls (both in the INT group). Table 3 shows the 
healthcare resource use of injured players and respective medical 
costs in both groups.
Trial based cost effectiveness analysis
We took the actual costs of the ‘11+ Kids’ intervention in the 
study setting into account. These costs include expenditures for 
the manuals, organisation of education courses for the coaches 
as well as costs of coaches attending the ‘11+ Kids’ instruction 
course. Total intervention costs were CHF4.02 per player (ie,

Figure 1 depicts the cost effectiveness plane of the INT 
group in comparison with the CON group. The ICER for the 
INT group in comparison with the CON group was dominant 
(95% 
CI dominant, dominant), based on a difference in the 
mean cost per player (ie, player season) of CHF−23.12 and a 
difference in the mean efficacy of 7.9% (ie, 14.7% of players 
injured in the CON group versus 6.8% in the INT group). Of 
all bootstrapped ICERs, 94.6% were located in the southeast 
(dominant) quadrant (figure 1), indicating that there were 
considerably lower costs and fewer injuries compared with the 
CON group.
Incremental cost effectiveness ratio for a countrywide 
implementation scenario in switzerland
For a countrywide implementation scenario (model based), 
the ICER was dominant (95% 
CI dominant, dominant), based 
on a difference in the mean cost per player of CHF−25.20 
and assuming the same difference in efficacy of 7.9%. For 
this scenario, 95.5% of the bootstrapped ICERs of the INT 
group were located in the southeast quadrant, demonstrating 
dominance of the INT group above the CON group (figure 2).
estimated injuries and costs avoided with implementing 
‘11+ Kids’ in switzerland
Table 1 displays the data on which we based our estimation of 
costs for implementing the programme in Switzerland (further 
information in online supplementary material 1). Based on the 
difference in the mean cost per player (CHF−25.20) between 
the INT group and the CON group and the number of players 
in Switzerland, CHF1.48 million in healthcare costs could be 
avoided with the ‘11+ Kids’ injury prevention strategy in just 
one season.
dIsCussIOn
Main study findings
The new injury prevention programme ‘11+ Kids’ has 
been shown to reduce football injuries in children in a multi-
centre cluster randomised controlled trial compared with 
a standard warmup.22 Based on data from Switzerland, we 
analysed direct medical costs of injuries. This exercise based 
injury prevention programme is efficacious in reducing 
the number of football injuries by 50%. In addition to the 
number of injuries, healthcare costs per player season were 
59% lower (CHF−23.12, 95% CI −39.09 to –7.14) and 
costs per 1000 hours of football exposure were 51% lower 
(CHF−240.66, 95% CI −406.89 to –74.32) compared with 
the team’s usual warmup. Further, the cost effectiveness anal-
ysis showed a 94.6% likelihood (trial based data) and a 95.5% 
likelihood (model based implementation scenario) for the 
intervention programme being dominant (ie, more effective 
and less costly) over the usual warmup routine.
Comparison with previous studies
A previous study investigating the cost effectiveness of a neuro-
muscular training programme in youth football (13–18 years) 
found both a reduction in injuries (−38%) and costs (−43%). 
These findings highlight the importance of widely implementing 
exercise based injury prevention strategies in youth football.27 
No study has previously investigated the economic impact of 
exercise based injury prevention in children’s football. Our 
findings (in players <13 years of age) show similar beneficial 
injury and cost reduction effects as the above mentioned study 
in older players. A randomised controlled trial in adult male 
amateur football players, however, did not show an overall 
reduction in injury, but did show a reduction in direct health-
care costs related to injury (−27%). The authors concluded 
that the cost savings might be related to the preventive effect 
of knee injuries in the INT group.28
In The Netherlands, annual cost savings of €35.9 million 
(CHF38.4 million, EUR-CHF 1.07, 2015; USD39.8 million, 
EUR-USD 1.11, 2015; GBP26.0 million, GBP-EUR 1.38, 
2015) have been estimated, given a widespread application 
of a programme to reduce the recurrence of lateral ankle 
sprains, compared with usual care.29 A further study from 
this group concluded that bracing is the dominant secondary 
preventive intervention over both neuromuscular training and 
the combination of neuromuscular training and bracing.24 In 
contrast with other intervention programmes, the proposed 
‘11+ Kids’ does not require special training equipment, 
like balance boards, which is a major advantage regarding 
cost effectiveness.27
strengths and limitations
The proportion of girls was representative of the population 
of football playing children in Switzerland. However, the 
absolute number was too low to draw conclusions about girls 
specifically. In older players, similar preventive effects of the 
‘11+’ have been described for young female and male football 
players.30 31 Hence comparable effects could be expected for 
girls and boys in children’s football.
Costs related to side line treatment of injuries (eg, first aid, 
tape) were not recorded. However, it could be assumed that the 
total costs of these treatments were low and did not substan-
tially influence the results. If there was an influence, it could 
be speculated that it would be in favour of the INT group, as 
the risk for mild and moderate injuries was also reduced.22
We did not investigate indirect costs related to injury (eg, 
loss in productivity of parents when nursing the injured 
child). In a study on Dutch schoolchildren aged 10–12 years, 
indirect costs accounted for 40% of the total injury related 
costs.11 Therefore, it can be assumed that the reduction in 
injury costs observed in our study substantially underesti-
mates the total financial savings.
In common with previous high quality studies, injury data 
were reported by coaches. Only if an injury was reported 
by the coach, parents and players were contacted to gather 
detailed information.30–32 To maximise the quality of 
reporting, all coaches of the INT and CON groups were 
thoroughly instructed on the injury definitions and were 
regularly contacted by our study assistants to ensure timely 
and complete data entry. To minimise potential recall bias, 
coaches received an automated reminder via email within a 
week if they did not enter data into the online system. After 
2 weeks without data entry, our study assistants contacted 
the coaches personally (via telephone and/or email).
Data recording in the INT teams started after the 
‘11+ Kids’ instruction session. Therefore, the exposure time 
was lower in the INT group than in the CON group. We 
performed a sensitivity analysis by cutting the respective 
time period (exposure time and injury events) in the CON 
group at the beginning of the season. The results were 
similar compared with the regular analysis. Consequently, 
the observed intervention effect was very likely not biased.

What are the new findings?
 
► The ‘11+ Kids’ programme reduced the injury related 
healthcare costs by 51% in players aged 7–12 years.
 
► The cost effectiveness analysis showed a 94.6% likelihood 
(trial based data) and a 95.5% likelihood (model based 
implementation scenario) for ‘11+ Kids’ being dominant (ie, 
more effective and less costly) over usual warmup.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the near 
future?
 
► The clear reduction in injury related costs provides strong 
evidence for a widespread implementation of the ‘11+ Kids’.
 
► A countrywide application of ‘11+ Kids’ in Switzerland could 
prevent approximately 2500 medically treated injuries and 
save CHF1.48 million in direct healthcare costs per year.
 
► Countrywide implementation campaigns have started already 
in New Zealand and the Czech Republic
The statistical approach does not allow controlling for 
potential confounders. However, in the corresponding 
publication on the efficacy of ‘11+ Kids’, we controlled the 
analysis for team and intra-person clustering, age, age inde-
pendent body height and match training ratio.22 It was, 
however, not possible to control the analyses for previous 
injury as the level of detail of these retrospectively collected 
data was too heterogeneous. The observed point estimate of 
the intervention effect got stronger (ie, in favour of the INT 
group) by controlling for the above mentioned confounders. 
Therefore, the reported cost reductions could be considered 
conservative.
Societal costs may be additionally reduced through less 
dropouts from sport, leading to higher physical activity levels 
in the long term. Children remain active and are more likely 
to become active adults with a lower risk of lifestyle related 
diseases.1 3 33 34 However, our data provide only a snapshot of 
the potential short and long term effects of implementing such 
a sports injury prevention programme.
Future perspective
A major argument for coaches to use exercise based injury preven-
tion is the positive effect on athletes’ performance.21 35 36 It is 
important to convince coaches and players to regularly use the 
programme, as compliance with the programme is directly linked 
to the reduction in injury risk.22 35 37 38 It has been shown that inju-
ries had a significant negative influence on team performance in 
male professional football.39 This underlines the importance of 
injury prevention to increase a team’s chances to win matches.
Injuries are among the most important reasons for dropping out 
from sport.40 Dropout from sport is directly associated with lower 
physical activity levels. The resulting reduction in physical activity 
negatively affects health and well being.2 41 Injury prevention not 
only supports the individual to stay injury free but it is also posi-
tively associated with physical activity in the long term.3 As such, it 
can be stated that the relevance of injury prevention at an early age 
is widely underestimated.
An efficacious preventive programme needs to be adopted and 
used in the real world setting to achieve health benefits in the popu-
lation.42 When developing ‘11+ Kids’, we worked closely with 
researchers, clinicians, practitioners and members of the target 
community.43 Therefore, the programme has a good chance of 
fulfilling the requirements of being adopted by the wider commu-
nity. Including the ‘11+ Kids’ in coaches’ education could enable 
a countrywide reach. Countrywide campaigns have started in New 
Zealand (see http://

co. 
nz/ 
the- 
11plus/ 
11plus- 
kids) and 
the Czech Republic. It is planned that other countries will follow 
soon.
Conclusion
The warmup and injury prevention programme for chil-
dren’s football ‘11+ Kids’ substantially reduced injury related 
costs and was cost effective compared with a usual warmup 
routine, in terms of realistic implementation costs. These find-
ings provide strong evidence for the implementation of this 
programme.
