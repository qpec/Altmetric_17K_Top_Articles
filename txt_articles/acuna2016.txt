Background. Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) with a pretransplant malignancy (PTM) are at increased risk for cancer
recurrence. However, it is unclear whether differences in survival and incidence of posttransplant de novo malignancies exist
between recipients with PTM and those without PTM. We designed a systematic review to synthesize all available evidence
assessing these outcomes. Methods. A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library
to identify studies comparing the following outcomes in SOTR by PTM status: (1) all-cause mortality, (2) cancer-specific mortality,
and (3) incidence of posttransplant de novo malignancy. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results.
Thirty-two cohort studies were included. Recipients with PTM were at increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to recip-
ients without PTM (pooled hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.81). Similarly, recipients with PTM were
3 times more likely to die of cancer (pooled HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 2.29-4.27). The pooled HR for developing posttransplant de novo
malignancy was also increased (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.52-2.42). The association of all-cause mortality and SOTR with PTM did
not vary by transplanted organ. Conclusions. Pretransplant malignancy is associated with increased risk of all cause-
mortality, cancer-specific mortality and of developing de novo malignancies after transplantation compared with those without
PTM. These results reaffirm the need for careful selection of transplant recipients with PTM. Tailored screening and manage-
ment strategies should be developed for this group of patients.
(Transplantation 2016;00: 00–00)
P
retransplant malignancy (PTM) in remission has long
been considered a relative contraindication for solid or-
gan transplantation due to the concern that immunosuppres-
sion required to prevent graft rejection would allow the
growth of dormant malignant cells in these patients.1-4 His-
torical data from the Israel Penn International Transplant Tu-
mor Registry, a voluntary registry, found the overall rate of
recurrence for these patients after transplant was 21%.5
However, more contemporary population-based registries
have reported lower recurrence rates.6,7
Recommendations for the listing of transplant candidates
with PTM have centered on the recurrence risk. However, re-
cently published studies report that differences in overall sur-
vival and incidence of posttransplant de novo malignancies
exist between recipients with PTM and those without a previ-
ous cancer diagnosis. An increased incidence of posttransplant
de novo malignancies is not unexpected in patients with PTM
because patients with a history of cancer have an increased in-
cidence of a second primary when compared with patients
without a previous malignancy diagnosis.8,9

 In recent years, cancer has emerged as an important cause
of death in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) and is
anticipated to overtake cardiovascular disease as the leading
cause of death in transplant recipients within the next
10 years.10-12 Additionally, because older patients are now
being accepted for transplantation, the number of transplant
candidates with preexisting malignancies continues to grow.
A more thorough evaluation of the impact of PTM on the
outcomes of transplant recipients is therefore timely. We de-
signed a systematic review to synthesize all available evidence
assessing the risks of all-cause mortality, cancer-specific mor-
tality, and posttransplant de novo malignancy in SOTR with
PTM when compared with recipients without such history.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Search Strategy
The protocol for this systematic review was prospectively
registered with PROSPERO (registration no. 42014009155),
and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for System-
atic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement.13 A comprehen-
sive literature search strategy was developed in consultation
with senior information specialists to identify eligible studies
in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (each
from its inception to week 3 of December 2015). The full elec-
tronic search strategies are included in Appendix 1, SDC,
http://links.lww.com/TP/B260. Thesis dissertations and grey
literature were also searched to identify any relevant articles
(see Appendix 2, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B260). Addi-
tionally, citation tracking from eligible studies was performed
to identify additional potential studies. Finally, authors were
contacted to obtain missing information.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Studies were included if they compared SOTR with PTM
to transplant recipients without history of malignancy for
any of the following outcomes: (1) all-cause mortality;
(2) cancer-specific mortality; or (3) incidence of posttransplant
de novo malignancies. Studies were limited to cohort studies
including at least 5 patients with a PTM and to those pub-
lished in English, French, Spanish, or Portuguese. Studies de-
scribing only patients with active or incidentally diagnosed
malignancies at the time of transplantation, and those who
underwent transplantation as a treatment for malignancy,
such as liver transplantation for the treatment of hepatocellu-
lar carcinoma, were excluded.
Study Selection and Data Extraction
Two investigators (S.A., J.H.) independently assessed all
titles and abstracts for eligible studies, and then reviewed
full-text articles for all included citations. In the case of dis-
agreement, consensus was achieved by discussion with a
third adjudicator (C.D.). Data extraction was carried out
using electronic standardized data extraction forms. We ex-
tracted study-level information including study design, pub-
lication characteristics, patient inclusion/exclusion criteria,
patient demographics of importance to determine the clini-
cal similarity of populations across studies (age, sex, type
of transplant, comorbidities), detailed prior malignancy his-
tory information (type of malignancy, time in remission),
length of follow-up or person-years at risk, and the out-
comes of interest. For studies with overlapping patient
populations, we included data from only the most recent
or comprehensive study.
Outcomes
Measures of effect for the outcomes of interest included:
number of events; risk ratio; odds ratio; incidence rate;
and/or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI),
when available. Hazard ratio, the most appropriate statistic
for meta-analysis of time-to-event outcomes, was directly used
in the meta-analyses when available; when not available, they
were estimated, provided that sufficient statistical information
was included (eg, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, P values for
log-rank test) using established methods described by Parmar
et al.14-16 For studies that only presented Kaplan-Meier sur-
vival curves, survival endpoints were extracted using DigitizeIt
visualization software17 and used to estimate the HR. For the
analysis of posttransplant de novo malignancies, only inci-
dence rate ratios per person-years of follow-up and incidence
density ratios could be estimated in some cases. Although
modeled under different assumptions, incidence rate ratios
can be considered approximations of hazard ratios18 and have
been previously included in meta-analyses using HR.15 For
this study, incidence density ratios were considered equivalent
to HR, assuming the hazards of posttransplant de novo malig-
nancy were constant over time. Cases per person-years of
follow-up were calculated for each study that provided the
number of observed cases and the length or person-years
of follow-up. When follow-up time for recipients with and
without preexisting malignancies was not reported sepa-
rately, we assumed the follow-up time for both groups was
the same. When studies included adjusted and unadjusted
estimates, both estimates were collected, as well as the covar-
iates included in the models.
Quality Assessment
The methodological quality of all included studies was
assessed independently by 2 authors (S.A., J.H.) using a mod-
ified score system based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for
Cohort Studies Quality Assessment19 (see Appendix 3, SDC,
http://links.lww.com/TP/B260). Studies with scores of 6 or
greater were considered good quality, studies with scores of
4 or greater and less than 6 were considered fair quality, and
studies with scores less than 4 were considered poor quality.
Reviewers were not blinded to the journal or authors' infor-
mation. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by
discussion between the 2 reviewers. When no consensus was
achieved, a third party resolved the dispute (C.D.).
Data Synthesis and Statistical Analyses
Only studies from which hazard ratios could be estimated
were included in the meta-analyses. Studies that included
only a particular age group or assessed only 1 type of cancer
were excluded from pooled analyses. An approximate stan-
dard error of the log rate ratio was calculated using the ge-
neric inverse-variance method. A correction of 0.5 was
added to each count in the case of zero events. Studies that
separately presented results by type of PTM were combined
using a fixed-effects model before incorporating the out-
comes into the meta-analyses as previously described and re-
ported in the literature.20-23 Heterogeneity of the data was
evaluated visually using forest plots. Between-study heteroge-
neity was assessed with the Cochran Q test and quantified

 using the I2 statistic.24 Pooled HR were determined using
weights from random effects models and reported with their
corresponding 95% CI. Analyses were stratified by trans-
planted organ and type of malignancy when possible. Sensitiv-
ity analysis was performed by excluding studies that reported
only unadjusted estimates or that used nonpopulation-based
cohorts. For meta-analyses including 10 or more studies, publi-
cation bias and small studies effect were assessed using funnel
plots.25 Statistical analyses were performed using Review
Manager 5.0 (Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark).
RESULTS
Study Selection
The literature search identified 9113 articles collectively
from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central, citation
tracking and grey literature search (see Appendix 2, SDC,
http://links.lww.com/TP/B260). After excluding duplicates,
of the 4482 unique articles identified, 4370 were excluded
based on title and abstract screening. A full-text review of
the remaining 402 articles led to further exclusion of 369 ar-
ticles, primarily because they did not compare recipients with
PTM to SOTR without a previous cancer diagnosis, they in-
cluded recipients with incidentally discovered malignancies,
or they included recipients whose indication for transplanta-
tion was cancer. A total of 33 articles6,26-57 which examined
at least one of the outcomes for patients with PTM remained
after the full text review. Figure 1 presents the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis
flow chart of article selection. Meta-analyses for all-cause
mortality, cancer-specific mortality, and posttransplant de
novo malignancy were performed on 10, 3, and 7 studies,
respectively.
Quality Assessment and Publication Bias
The quality assessment scores of the included studies are
presented in Table 1. Four of the 33 studies were conference
abstracts that provided sufficient information for meta-
analysis, but insufficient details for quality assessment, and
therefore did not receive a score. Out of the 14 studies that
reported all-cause mortality and could be assessed, eleven
were of good quality and the remaining three studies were
of fair quality. Only 8 of the 14 studies provided estimates ad-
justed for confounding variables. All 5 studies that reported
cancer-specific mortality and could be assessed were of good
quality, although 2 did not adjust for confounding vari-
ables.43,44 One conference abstract and 5 studies reported
cancer-specific mortality, out of which 3 adjusted for con-
founding variables.27,45,58 Of the 14 studies that reported
the incidence of posttransplant de novo malignancy and were
not conference abstracts, 11 studies were of good quality, 2
studies were of fair quality and 1 of poor quality (not in-
cluded in the meta-analysis because the HR could not be esti-
mated).6 Only 8 of the 14 studies provided estimates adjusted
for confounding variables.
Publication bias was not assessed for the meta-analyses
of incidence of posttransplant de novo malignancy and de
novo nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) as both included
fewer than 10 studies.25 Although some asymmetry was
present in the funnel plot of studies included in the all-
cause mortality meta-analysis, the interpretation of this
finding is difficult given the small number of studies in-
cluded. There is a possibility that smaller studies showing
no association could have been missed (see Figure S1, SDC,
http://links.lww.com/TP/B260).
All-Cause Mortality
A total of 17 studies compared all-cause mortality in
SOTR with and without PTM (Table 2). In 13 studies, pa-
tients with a single type of transplanted organ were included
(kidney, 7; heart, 5); the remainder reported on outcomes for
patients with various types of solid organ transplants (N = 4).
Studies were performed in North America, Europe, and Asia.
Eleven studies were conducted in a population-based setting,
while the remaining 6 were single-centered. All studies but
one included any malignancy. A study that included only
patients with pretransplant melanoma39 and 2 studies that
included specific age groups (pediatric heart transplant re-
cipients,31 and elderly kidney transplant recipients34) were

 not included in the meta-analysis. Of the 14 remaining
studies, 11 provided HR for long-term all-cause mortality
or statistical information that allowed the estimation of
HR (Figure 2). The pooled HR for all-cause mortality in
SOTR with PTM was 1.51 compared with those without
PTM (95% CI, 1.28-1.80; I2, 74%). The pooled HR was
not significantly different from the overall estimate when
we conducted the following sensitivity analyses: (a) by in-
cluding studies with a reported (not estimated) HR only;
(b) including studies that reported adjusted HR only;
(c) by restricting the analysis to population-based studies
to explore reasons for statistical heterogeneity; or (d) when
removing studies with unknown length of follow-up (see
Figure S2, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B260). Stratified
analyses suggested the observed hazard were similar for
kidney (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22-1.92) and nonkidney (HR,
1.61; 95% CI, 1.17-2.22) transplant recipients (see Figure S3,
SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B260).
Of the 5 studies not included in the pooled HR calculation,
3 demonstrated no difference,31,33,35 whereas 2 demon-
strated statistically significantly worse overall survival for re-
cipients with PTM.36,39 In a small study of cardiac transplant
recipients, the 2-year overall survival of patients with PTM
was comparable to that of patients without a preexisting can-
cer diagnosis.33 Similarly, in the 2003 report of the Registry of
the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation,
PTM was not significantly associated with mortality at 1 year
and 5 years.35 When looking at specific age groups using the
United Network for Organ Sharing database, Shah et al31
identified 7169 pediatric heart transplant recipients; 107 patients
had PTM. Survival was similar between children with versus

the contrary, Doyle et al34 evaluated the outcomes of kidney

ysis, pretransplant history of nonskin malignancies was asso-
ciated with decreased overall survival (HR, 5.0; 95% CI,
1.92-13.04).36 The study by Arron et al39 evaluated the out-
comes of 336 SOTR recipients with pretransplant melanoma
compared to 191 471 recipients with no prior cancer history
using data from the Transplant Cancer Match Study. Recipi-
ents with pretransplant melanoma had an increased risk of
all-cause death (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.5).
Cancer-Specific Mortality
Cancer-specific mortality in transplant recipients with
PTM was evaluated in 6 studies (Table 3). Of these, 1 study
evaluated melanoma-associated mortality only,39 and an-
other only examined NMSC-specific mortality44; the other
studies evaluated any cancer-related mortality. Three studies
included patients undergoing kidney transplants, whereas 3
studiesincludedpatientsundergoingdifferentsolidorgantrans-
plants. The studies included populations in North America,

were population-based.27,38,39,44,45 Meta-analysis for cancer-
specific mortality was performed on 3 studies. The pooled
analysis showed that patients with PTM were at greater risk
of cancer-specific mortality compared with those without
PTM (HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 2.29-4.27; I2, 71%) (Figure 3).
Although all studies included in the meta-analysis reported
significantly increased HR for cancer-specific mortality, the
heterogeneity of the analysis was moderately high. Of the 3
studies that were not included in the pooled HR, a retrospec-
tive study of 334 lung and heart-lung transplant recipients by
Metcalfe et al43 reported no difference in cancer-specific mor-
tality between the 21 (6.3%) SOTR with PTM and the 334
SOTR without (estimated odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.19-
12.82). Two studies evaluated the mortality risk of skin malig-
nancy. Arron et al39 reported that patients with pretransplant
melanoma had an increased risk of melanoma-specific death
(HR, 27; 95% CI, 11.2-65.2). In contrast, Bavinck et al44 re-
ported that 46 kidney recipients with pretransplant NMSC
did not experience a greater risk of NMSC-specific mortality.
Incidence of Posttransplant De Novo Malignancy
A total of 16 studies explored the incidence of post-
transplant de novo malignancy in patients with PTM (Table 4).
Thestudypopulationswerekidney(N=6),heart(N=5),lung
(N = 2), liver (N = 1), and various multiple solid organ trans-
plants (N = 3) performed in North America, Europe, and
Australia. Eight studies were conducted in a population-
based setting and 8 were single-centered. In 7 studies, HR
for all posttransplant de novo malignancy in patients with
PTM was reported or could be estimated from the available
data.Inthese7studies,thepooledestimateshowedthatSOTR

malignancy compared with those without (HR, 1.92; 95%
CI, 1.52-2.42; I2, 30%) (Figure 4). Pooled HR did not de-
pend on any single outlying study. Excluding studies that re-
quired estimation of an HR did not alter our findings.
Moreover, the exclusion of unadjusted estimates did not have
a significant effect on the pooled HR (see Figure S4, SDC,
http://links.lww.com/TP/B260).
Stratified
analyses
sug-
gested the observed hazard for kidney transplant recipients
(HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.39-2.98) was similar to nonkidney
transplant recipients (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.36–2.55) (see
Figure S5, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B260). Of the 3
studies that could not be included in the pooled HR calcula-
tion, 2 reported consistent findings with the meta-analysis.6,31
In a single-center audit of 474 heart transplant recipients, PTM
was not associated with increased incidence of posttransplant
de novo malignancies in multivariable analyses.51
Several studies explored the effect of PTM on site-specific
posttransplant de novo malignancies. Pretransplant malig-
nancies were significantly associated with an increased risk
of posttransplant NMSC (pooled HR, 4.64; 95% CI, 2.54-
8.49; I2, 74%; Figure 5). Sensitivity analysis using the leave-
one-study-out technique revealed that the study by Modaresi
Esfeh et al significantly changed the pooled estimate (data not
shown). Excluding this study reduced the HR and heteroge-
neity (see Figure S6, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B260).
One study evaluated patients with pretransplant melanoma.
Arron et al39 reported that 336 recipients with pretransplant
melanoma had an increased incidence of melanoma after
transplant (HR, 5.38; 95% CI, 2.9-9.8) compared with
191 471 subjects without PTM. The 5-year cumulative inci-
dence of incident primary melanoma was 0.75% in patients
with PTM compared with 0.14% in subjects without PTM,
an absolute risk difference of 0.61%. Additionally, 1 study

 evaluated the effect of PTM on the incidence of posttrans-
plant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD).53 Data from
the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) were linked
to health administrative databases to identify 25 127 kidney
transplant recipients and their incidence of PTLD. In this
study, PTM was an independent risk factor for the develop-
ment of PTLD (adjusted HR, 3.54; 95% CI, 2.31-5.43), but
not for death after PTLD (adjusted HR, 2.04; CI, 0.96-4.3).53
DISCUSSION
This systematic review reports on the risk of all-cause mor-
tality, cancer-specific mortality, and transplant de novo ma-
lignancy in 10 856, 1544, and 4302 SOTR with PTM,
respectively. Our analysis indicated that for patients who re-
ceived SOTR, PTM is associated with increased risk of all
cause-mortality, cancer-specific mortality and of developing
de novo malignancies after transplantation, compared with
those without PTM. The association of all-cause mortal-
ity and SOTR with PTM did not vary by the type of trans-
planted organ.
The critical shortage of suitable organs for transplantation
means that clinicians and policy makers must ensure scarce
deceased donor organs are allocated to the patients who
would benefit from them the most. Although transplant re-
cipients with PTM experience worse outcomes, increasing
the current waiting times between successful cancer treat-
ment and transplantation will probably not improve out-
comes in this group of patients. Current recommendations
for listing transplant candidates with PTM have been based
on the high risk of cancer recurrence reported by the Israel
Penn International Transplant Tumor Registry and the natu-
ral history of the malignancy.1,2,5,59 However, more contem-
porary population-based registries, such as the Australia and
New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry and the
United Network for Organ Sharing in the United States have
reported lower recurrence rates, similar to those observed in
the general population.6,7
Prolonging the requirement for remission times may not
improve overall survival. Solid organ transplant recipients
with PTM are more likely to receive organs from expanded
criteria donors and to have prolonged time on dialysis before
transplantation, factors associated with increased risks of
cardiovascular mortality and graft failure.60,61 Importantly,
simply prolonging mandatory remission times before trans-
plantation may not have an impact on survival outcomes in
patients with PTM. In the study by Brattstrom et al,27 the
lower cancer-specific mortality observed in SOTR with
longer intervals between cancer and transplantation did not
translate into a reduction in all-cause mortality, possibly be-
cause an increase in noncancer mortality. Lastly, although
prolonging remission times may reduce the risk of cancer re-
currence, patients with PTM will remain at increased risk for
de novo malignancies.
Although there is solid evidence for the risk of post-
transplant de novo malignancy and cancer mortality after
transplantation,10,12,45,58,62 little is known about the out-
comes of transplant recipients with PTM. This study pro-
vides a systematic evaluation of the literature, including
large numbers of patients with PTM. The findings of this re-
view highlight the need to better understand and mitigate the
cancer risk in recipients with PTM and to improve their over-
all survival. Future research is needed to explore whether
the association of all-cause mortality in SOTR with PTM
is explained solely by the increased cancer mortality or by
other factors, such as cardiovascular disease and graft fail-
ure. Other aspects worth investigating include effects of
immunosuppression in cancer recurrence, identification of
pretransplant factors associated with worse outcomes, the
effectiveness of enhanced posttransplant screening strate-
gies, and the use of alternative immunosuppressive regimens
in this high-risk group.
As the mean age of transplant candidates rises, the number
of SOTR with PTM is expected to increase. Although the
proportion of patients with PTM ranges from 0.4% to
5.4% in population-based cohorts, these patients accounted
for as many as 7.4% of the SOTR in Ontario in 2010.10
Our synthesis of the literature has important clinical implica-
tions as it provides prognostic information for SOTR with
PTM and the knowledge base to improve the outcomes of
these patients. Our finding of an increased risk of second ma-
lignancies in this group is also important because there are
currently no specific recommendations on screening for sec-
ond malignancies in transplant recipients with PTM. Although
not evaluated in this study, modification of immunosuppres-
sion regimens may have an impact on cancer outcomes in this
population. Our findings highlight the need for further studies
in this high-risk population.
Some limitations must be considered when interpreting
these findings. Our search strategy was limited to select lan-
guages, which may have resulted in a language or cultural bias.
Nonetheless, our expansive search across several databases
has incorporated numerous studies conducted outside of the
English-speaking world.27-29,32,37,47,49,51,52 We also acknowl-
edge the presence of heterogeneity between studies reporting
all-causeandcancer-specific mortality.Statisticalheterogeneity

 was high between studies examining all-cause mortality; how-
ever, we used a random effect model for all our meta-analyses
and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity. We ex-
plored if the heterogeneity was due to variation in organ
types transplanted, methodological quality, or study design
(population-based vs. nonpopulation based). These factors
did not explain the heterogeneity. The sources of the ob-
served heterogeneity are likely multifactorial. For example,
differences in selection of transplant candidates with PTM
across jurisdictions (0.4% of kidney transplant recipients
had a PTM in the United Kingdom vs 2.4% of in the
United States),6,58 and large variations in the comprehensive-
ness of risk-adjustment across studies may explain some of
the residual heterogeneity. Lastly, there is a possibility that
smaller studies showing no association between PTM and
all-cause mortality could have been missed. Despite these
limitations, the vast majority of point estimates were associ-
ated with increased risks for all-cause mortality, cancer-
specific mortality, and incidence of posttransplant de novo
malignancies. These findings strengthen our conclusions.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that SOTR with PTM
have worse outcomes in terms of cancer mortality, all-cause
mortality, and posttransplant de novo malignancies than
those without PTM. As a risk factor for long-term all-cause
mortality, PTM confers a similar risk to that of pretransplant
cardiac events in kidney and heart recipients.63,64 These re-
sults reaffirm the need for careful selection of transplant re-
cipients with PTM, tailored screening and management
strategies, and justify further research to explore risk factors
for adverse outcomes in this population.
