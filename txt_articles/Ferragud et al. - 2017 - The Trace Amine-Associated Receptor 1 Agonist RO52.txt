Compulsive, binge eating of highly palatable food constitutes a core feature of some forms of obesity and eating disorders, as well as of the
recently proposed disorder of food addiction. Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a highly conserved G-protein-coupled
receptor bound by endogenous trace amines. TAAR1 agonists have been shown to reduce multiple behavioral effects of drugs of abuse
through their actions on the mesocorticolimbic system. In this study, we hypothesized that TAAR1 may have a role in compulsive, binge-
like eating; we tested this hypothesis by assessing the effects of a TAAR1 agonist, RO5256390, in multiple excessive feeding-related
behaviors induced by limiting access to a highly palatable diet in rats. Our results show that RO5256390 blocked binge-like eating in rats
responding 1 h per day for a highly palatable sugary diet. Consistent with a palatability-selective effect, drug treatment selectively reduced
the rate and regularity of palatable food responding, but it did not affect either baseline intake or food restriction-induced overeating of the
standard chow diet. Furthermore, RO5256390 fully blocked compulsive-like eating when the palatable diet was offered in an aversive
compartment of a light/dark conflict box, and blocked the conditioned rewarding properties of palatable food, as well as palatable food-
seeking behavior in a second-order schedule of reinforcement. Drug treatment had no effect on either anxiety-like or depressive-like
behavior, and it did not affect control performance in any of the tests. Importantly, rats exposed to palatable food showed decreased
TAAR1 levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and RO5256390 microinfused into the infralimbic, but not prelimbic, subregion of
the mPFC-reduced binge-like eating. Altogether, these results provide evidence for TAAR1 agonism as a novel pharmacological treatment
for compulsive, binge eating.

INTRODUCTION
Binge eating constitutes a core feature of forms of obesity
and eating disorders (eg binge eating disorder, bulimia
nervosa, and anorexia nervosa of the binge/purge type), as
well as of the recently proposed disorder of food addiction
(APA, 2013; Gearhardt et al, 2014). During a typical binge
eating episode, individuals consume large amounts of highly
processed, palatable foods in short periods of time, resulting
in a very rapid eating behavior (APA, 2013; Micioni Di
Bonaventura et al, 2014; Murray et al, 2014). Binge eating
episodes also occur when not feeling physically hungry and
can be triggered by conditioned environmental stimuli, even
in absence of food per se (Giuliano and Cottone, 2015). Binge
eaters experience lack of control over eating, an attribute
which underlines the compulsive nature of this maladaptive
feeding behavior (APA, 2013).
Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a G-pro-
tein-coupled receptor bound and activated by trace amines, a
group of endogenous amines related to classical neurotrans-
mitters, such as dopamine and serotonin (Borowsky et al,
2001; Bunzow et al, 2001; Burchett and Hicks, 2006; Grandy
et al, 2016). TAAR1 is the only subtype of the TAAR family
(TAAR1–9) to be phylogenetically conserved in all species
studied, including humans, and it is sensitive to all trace
amines
(Borowsky
et
al,
2001;
Bunzow
et
al,
2001;
Lindemann and Hoener, 2005).
Growing evidence suggests that TAAR1 has a major role in
regulating the behavioral actions of drugs of abuse, in
particular those of psychostimulants. Indeed, both gene
deletion and pharmacological studies have shown that
TAAR1 activation reduces the reinforcing and rewarding
effects of cocaine and methamphetamine, their locomotor
stimulant effects, as well as reinstatement of seeking behavior

 (Harkness et al, 2015; Liu et al, 2016; Pei et al, 2015;
Sukhanov et al, 2016; Thorn et al, 2014; Wolinsky et al,
2007). These actions are thought to occur via a TAAR1-
mediated negative modulation of dopaminergic transmission
in the mesocorticolimbic system (Espinoza et al, 2015; Miller
et al, 2005; Xie et al, 2007); particularly, lack of TAAR1 has
been shown to result in an elevated dopaminergic firing rate,
whereas TAAR1 activation suppresses such firing (Bradaia
et al, 2009; Lindemann et al, 2008; Revel et al, 2011). As a
result, TAAR1 agonism has been proposed as a potential
therapeutic option for addictive disorders (Pei et al, 2016).
On the basis of the above described observations, as well as
the well-established role of dopaminergic transmission in food
reward (Michaelides et al, 2012), we hypothesized that TAAR1
agonism may reduce compulsive, binge-like eating. To test this
hypothesis, we first assessed whether the systemic activation of
TAAR1 would block the excessive feeding-related behaviors
induced by limiting access to highly palatable food in rats
(Blasio et al, 2014; Velazquez-Sanchez et al, 2014). Next, we
determined the role played by the mesocorticolimbic TAAR1
system in excessive eating of palatable food first by measuring
TAAR1 expression levels in selected brain regions (ie, medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsal striatum, and nucleus
accumbens) and, then, based on the information acquired,
by site-specifically microinfusing the TAAR1 agonist into the
relevant brain regions (ie, infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PrL)
subregions of the mPFC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
One hundred sixty four male Wistar rats, 45-day old, and
triple-housed upon arrival (200–225 g; Charles River, Wil-
mington, MA), were housed in a 12 : 12 h reverse light cycle
(lights off at 1100 hours), in a humidity- and temperature-
controlled vivarium. Rats were given access to corn-based chow
(Harlan Teklad LM-485 Diet 7012 (65% (kcal) carbohydrate,
13% fat, 21% protein, 341 cal per 100 g); Harlan, Indianapolis,
IN) and water ad libitum, unless otherwise specified. Experi-
mental procedures were performed during rats’ active cycle
(dark cycle). Procedures adhered to the National Institutes of
Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and
were approved by Boston University Medical Campus Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Drugs
The highly selective TAAR1 full agonist RO5256390 (Revel
et al, 2012) was synthesized by F. Hoffman-La Roche. Doses
for Experiment 1 (0, 1, 3, 10 mg/kg) were based on a
previously published report (Pei et al, 2014). In the other
experiments, the most effective dose from Experiment 1 was
used.
For
intracranial
administration,
RO5256390
was
administered at the doses of 0, 1.5, 5 and 15 μg per side;
these doses were chosen based on preliminary observations
obtained
in
our
laboratory.
For
intraperitoneal
(i.p.)
administration, RO5256390 was freshly dissolved in 0.3%
Tween 80 and 0.9% saline; for intracranial administration,
RO5256390 was freshly dissolved in a mixture of ethanol:
cremophor:saline (2 : 2 : 18 ratio). For within-subject drug
testing, 2–4 intervening days were allowed, until subjects’
performance returned to baseline conditions. All drug
treatments were counterbalanced, unless otherwise specified.
Apparatus for Self-administration Procedures
The individual operant test chambers (Med Associates Inc.,
St Albans, VT) had a grid floor and were located in
ventilated, sound-attenuating enclosures (Cottone et al, 2012;
Smith et al, 2015). Food reinforcers were delivered by a pellet
dispenser into a head entry magazine and water reinforcers
by a solenoid into a head entry liquid cup magazine. Two
retractable levers were placed on the opposite wall of the
chamber. 28 V stimulus cue-lights were located above each
lever and above the food magazine. In all the procedures,
pellet acquisition occurred following a nose poke response,
except for the food seeking experiment in which food pellets
delivery occurred following responding on a lever based on a
second order schedule of reinforcement.
Operant Binge-like Eating Procedure in Ad libitum-fed
Rats
Training.
As previously described (Blasio et al, 2014;
Velazquez-Sanchez et al, 2014), rats were allowed to self-
administer food pellets (45-mg precision pellets, 5TUM: 65.5%
(kcal) carbohydrate, 10.4% fat, 24.1% protein, 330 cal per
100 g; TestDiet, Richmond, IN) and water (100 μl) during
daily 1 h experimental sessions under a Fixed Ratio 1 (FR1)
schedule of reinforcement in the operant chambers; head
entry within the food magazine was detected by a photobeam,
which resulted in the delivery of a food pellet within the same
food magazine. A 1.0 sec timeout period, where no additional
pellets were delivered, was used. Spillage is negligible (4.8% of
total responses, n = 23). At the end of the self-administration
procedure, rats were returned to their home cages and fed
with the same standard chow diet provided in the operant
procedure, but in a 5 g format Cottone et al, 2012.
Escalation of palatable food intake.
After stable baseline
training performance was achieved, rats were divided into a
Chow control group, which received the same 45-mg chow
pellets offered during the training phase, and a Palatable
group, which received a nutritionally complete, chocolate-
flavored, high sucrose (50% kcal) AIN-76A-based diet
(45-mg precision pellets, chocolate-flavored, 5TUL: 66.7%
(kcal) carbohydrate, 12.7% fat, 20.6% protein, metabolizable
energy 344 cal per 100 g; formulated as 45-mg precision food
pellets; TestDiet). It was previously shown that the 5TUL diet
is strongly preferred over the standard chow diet by all rats
(91.2% ± 3.7 preference; Cottone et al, 2008, 2009).
Experiment 1: effects of the TAAR1 agonist RO5256390 on
operant binge-like eating.
Rats in the Chow and Palatable
food groups (n = 12 per group) were administered the
TAAR1 agonist RO5256390 (0, 1, 3, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min
prior to the operant sessions.
High Rate of Responding for Standard Chow Induced by
Food Restriction
To reach a higher rate of responding for chow during the
operant sessions, rats were food restricted in their home

 cages for 12 days (to reach a total daily intake equal to 70% of
a rat’s daily intake; Cottone et al, 2012).

by food restriction.
Food-restricted rats (n = 9 per group)
were

agonist
RO5256390
(0, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min prior to the operant sessions.
Rate and Regularity of Sustained Eating: Inter-feeding
Intervals and Return Map Analyses
Inter-feeding interval analysis.
To identify between group
differences in the rate and regularity of sustained eating,
analysis of the ln-transformed duration of consecutive inter-
feeding intervals (IFIs) was performed (Cottone et al, 2012).
IFI, defined as the time between two consecutive food
nosepoke responses, is a variable inversely correlated to
eating rate, and it was automatically recorded by the
computer. The mean, total IFI time, entropy, kurtosis, and
skewness of the ln-transformed duration of each subject’s
consecutive IFIs were individually determined and then
averaged across subjects.
Decreases in the IFI mean indicate a faster pellet-to-pellet
responding and, therefore, an increased eating rate, which
has been proposed to be an index of food palatability
(Cottone et al, 2007; Iemolo et al, 2015). Decreases in the
total IFI time mean a decrease in the total pellet-to-pellet
time. Decreases in the histogram entropy (a measure of
categorical variability, reflected in a decreased number of
populated histogram bins, each with less similar event
frequencies) indicate an increased regularity of intake.
Conversely, an increase in the kurtosis of the IFI distribution
(a measure of the distribution’s ‘peakedness’, reflected in a
more peaked top and smaller tails of the distribution) is
consistent with an increased regularity of pellet-to-pellet
responding. Finally, a significant increase in the skewness (a
measure of the distribution’s symmetry, reflected in a
selective increase of the frequency of the IFI falling to the
left of the histogram) is consistent with a selective increase of
the fast pellet-to-pellet responding. Total IFI time was
calculated as the sum of all the IFIs within a session.
Return map analysis.
For return map analysis, each IFI in
the time series was scatter-plotted against its subsequent IFI
(IFI+1) in a Cartesian plane (Cottone et al, 2007; Iemolo
et al, 2015).
Experiment 3: effects of the TAAR1 agonist RO5256390 on
rate and regularity of sustained eating.
Rats in the Chow,
food-restricted Chow, and Palatable food groups (n = 7–10
per
group)
were
administered
the
TAAR1
agonist
RO5256390 (0, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min prior to the operant
sessions.
Compulsive-like Eating of Palatable Food: Light/Dark
Box Conflict Test
In this test, a light/dark rectangular box (50 × 100 × 35 cm)
was used, in which the aversive, bright compartment
(50 × 70 × 35 cm) was illuminated by a 60 lux light. The dark
compartment (50 × 30 × 35 cm) had an opaque cover and
~ 0 lux of light. The two compartments were connected by an
open doorway, which allowed the subjects to move freely
between the two. A shallow, metal cup containing a pre-
weighed amount of the same food received during self-
administration (45-mg chow or 45-mg chocolate pellets for
rats in the Chow or Palatable food group, respectively) was
positioned
in
the
center
of
the
light
compartment.
Apparatus-naive rats were habituated to an ante-room 2 h
prior to testing. Under normal, control conditions, eating
behavior is typically suppressed when a rat is in the aversive,
bright compartment; a significant increase in food intake in
spite of the adverse conditions, as compared with control
conditions, was operationalized as a construct of ‘compul-
sive-like eating’ (Cottone et al, 2012; Velazquez-Sanchez
et al, 2014).
Experiment 4: effects of the TAAR1 agonist RO5256390 on
compulsive-like eating.
Rats in the Chow and Palatable
food groups (n = 21–23 per group) were administered the
TAAR1 agonist RO5256390 (0, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min prior
to the testing session, using a between-subjects design.
Conditioned Food Reward: Conditioned Place
Preference Test
The conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure was
performed as previously described (Velazquez-Sanchez et al,
2015).
Experiment 5: effects of the TAAR1 agonist RO5256390 on
conditioned food reward.
Rats in the Chow and Palatable
food groups (n = 16–22 per group) were administered the
TAAR1 agonist RO5256390 (0, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min prior
to the post-conditioning phase, using a between-subjects
design.
Food-seeking Behavior: Second-order Schedule of
Reinforcement
The second-order schedule of reinforcement procedure was
performed as previously described (Smith et al, 2015;
Velazquez-Sanchez et al, 2015).
Experiment 6: effects of the TAAR1 agonist RO5256390 on
food-seeking.
Rats in the Chow and Palatable food groups
(n = 6–10 per group) were administered the TAAR1 agonist
RO5256390 (0, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min prior to the second-
order sessions.
Anxiety-like Behavior: Defensive Withdrawal Test
For this 10-min test (Cottone et al, 2009; Parylak et al, 2012),
rats were placed into a withdrawal chamber (2 l Pyrex beaker
wrapped in black tape) within an open field facing the rear.
Latency to first emerge (all four paws in the open field) and
withdrawal time were used as indices of anxiety-like
behavior, although the number of entries into the chamber
was used as an index of locomotor activity (Cottone et al,
2009; Parylak et al, 2012).

Rats were placed into a clear acrylic cylinder (25 cm
diameter) filled with water (24 ± 1 °C; 42 cm deep) for
15 min during the pre-test day and 5 min during the test

test, using a between-subjects design.
Western Blot
Brain punches from a separate cohort of rats trained in the
operant binge-like eating procedure were processed for
western blotting as previously described (Cottone et al,
2012). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a
primary anti-TAAR1 mouse polyclonal antibody (1:5000;
provided by Roche Diagnostics) and primary anti-β-tubulin
mouse monoclonal antibody, (1:30 000; sc-53140, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The anti-TAAR1 primary antibody was
validated previously (Harmeier et al, 2015). Membranes
were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a secondary
anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody (1:5000 or 1:10 000; sc-2004,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, for TAAR1 and β-tubulin,
respectively).

TAAR1 protein levels in mesocorticolimbic brain areas.
mPFC, dorsal striatum, and nucleus accumbens from rats in
Chow and Palatable food groups (n = 10–12 per group) were
compared for TAAR1 protein levels.
Intracranial Surgeries, Microinfusion Procedure, and
Cannula Placement
Rats were stereotaxically implanted with bilateral, intracra-
nial cannulas targeting the IL and the PrL subregions of
the mPFC, as described previously (Dore et al, 2013; Sabino
et al, 2007).
Experiments 10–11: effects of microinfusion of the TAAR1
agonist RO5256390 into the IL cortex and PrL cortex on
operant binge-like eating.
Rats in the Chow and Palatable
food groups were microinfused with the TAAR1 agonist
RO5256390 (0, 1.5, 5, 15 μg per side) into either the IL
(n = 8–10 per group) or the PrL (n = 11–12 per group) cortex
10 min prior to the operant sessions.
Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed by simple or factorial ANOVAs followed
by Bonferroni post hoc test. Statistical significance level was
set at p ⩽ 0.05. The software/graphic packages used were
SigmaPlot 11.0, Statistica 7.0, and Origin 8.5.
RESULTS
Experiment 1: Effects of the TAAR1 Agonist RO5256390
on Operant Binge-like Eating
Rats, initially trained to respond for the standard chow diet,
were split in two matched groups and assigned to either the
Chow or the Palatable condition (M ± SEM of last four self-
administration sessions, 18.6 ± 1.3 and 18.8 ± 0.8 kcal for
Chow and Palatable respectively, t22 = 0.13, p = 0.897, not
shown). Rats allowed to self-administer the sugary, highly
palatable diet 1 h per day markedly escalated food intake,
unlike the control Chow group, whose intake remained
stable across the 15 days of observation (Diet, F1,22 = 49.83,
p = 0.001; Diet × Day, F14,31 = 16.95, p = 0.001; Figure 1a).
When the effects of the TAAR1 agonist RO5256390 on
food intake were tested, results showed that rats from the
Palatable food group consumed significantly more food
compared with the Chow controls under vehicle conditions
(Diet, F1,22 = 62.72, p = 0.001; Figure 1b). Drug treatment
selectively and dose dependently blocked the binge-like
eating of the Palatable food group in the operant task,
without affecting intake of the control Chow group (Dose,
F3,66 = 22.17, p = 0.001; Diet × Dose, F3,66 = 10.02, p = 0.001).
In rats fed with the Palatable diet, RO5256390 treatment
significantly decreased palatable food responding, compared
with vehicle, at all doses tested. At the highest dose tested
(10 mg/kg), drug treatment fully blocked binge-like eating, as
treated rats’ intake in the Palatable food group did not differ
from either Chow/Vehicle or Chow/RO5256390 10 mg/kg.
Figure 1c shows the time course of responding (Diet × Dose,
F3,66 = 3.41, p = 0.022).
Experiment 2: Effects of the TAAR1 Agonist RO5256390
on High Rate of Responding for Standard Chow Induced
by Food Restriction
Figure 1d shows the escalation of the standard chow
responding during daily home-cage food restriction (Day,
F11,88 = 30.17, p = 0.001). Responding for the standard chow
diet in food-restricted rats was comparable to the responding
of vehicle-treated ad libitum-fed rats in the Palatable food
group in the RO5256390 administration FR1 study (t20= 0.21,
p = 0.832). Systemic treatment with the 10 mg/kg dose of
RO5256390 had no effect on the high rate of responding for
standard chow in the operant FR1 food intake task in food-
restricted rats (t8 = 0.53, p = 0.610; Figure 1c).
Experiment 3: Effects of the TAAR1 Agonist RO5256390
on Rate and Regularity of Sustained Eating
As shown in Figure 2, vehicle-treated binge-eating rats in
the Palatable food group showed a significantly smaller
IFI mean, but no different total IFI time compared with
ad libitum-fed rats in the Chow food group; surprisingly,
TAAR1 agonism blocks compulsive, binge-like eating

1461
Neuropsychopharmacology
 vehicle-treated food-restricted chow rats showed a similar
IFI mean but a much higher total IFI time than control
ad libitum-fed rats in the Chow food group (IFI mean: Diet,
F2,23 = 18.78, p = 0.001; total IFI time: Diet, F2,23 = 20.12,
p = 0.001; Figure 2a and b). Therefore, even though both
Palatable and food-restricted group rats ate significantly
more pellets than control ad libitum-fed rats in the Chow
food group (Diet, F2,23 = 37.71, p = 0.001; not shown), rats
fed with the palatable diet consumed food at a higher rate
within a similar time, while food-restricted chow rats ate at a
similar rate but in a longer time. In addition, both rats in the
Palatable food group and food-restricted chow rats showed
an increased regularity of sustained eating as revealed by a
decreased entropy, compared with ad libitum-fed Chow
controls (entropy: Diet, F2,23 = 49.85, p = 0.001; Figure 2c).
However, although rats’ IFI distribution in the Palatable
food group was more skewed and leptokurtic than that of
ad libitum-fed rats in the Chow food group, the shape of the

when compared with the homogeneous distribution across a
wide range of IFI values of Chow controls, food responding
of vehicle-treated rats in the Palatable food group was
characterized by a denser cluster of IFIs skewed in the
bottom left of the map, while responding in food-restricted
chow rats was characterized by an overall increase of events
across the entire range of IFIs, with sporadic clustered events
(Figure 2d).
When RO5256390 (10 mg/kg) was administered, only
Palatable food group responding was affected by drug
treatment. Indeed, although the drug treatment had no
effect on either ad libitum-fed Chow rats or food-restricted
chow rats, rats in the Palatable food group RO5256390
increased the IFI mean (Dose, F1,23 = 5.82, p = 0.024; Diet ×

(Dose,

revealed that drug treatment did not meaningfully affect total
IFI time, skewness, or kurtosis (total IFI time: Dose,

 RO5256390 treatment resulted in a more diffuse and less
skewed pellet-to-pellet responding, as compared with the
vehicle condition. Therefore, RO5256390 treatment tended
to normalize the rate and the regularity of responding in
bingeing of rats in the Palatable food group.
Experiment 4: Effects of the TAAR1 Agonist RO5256390
on Compulsive-like Eating
When food was placed in the bright, aversive compartment
of the light/dark apparatus, control Chow intake was
suppressed. Under vehicle conditions, rats in the Palatable
food group consumed 10-fold more food as compared with
the
control
Chow
group
(Diet,
F1,83 = 5.34,
p = 0.023;
Figure 3a (see Supplementary Figure S2 for the grams of
food consumed). In addition, RO5256390, administered at
the 10 mg/kg dose, fully blocked compulsive-like eating of
the palatable diet (Dose, F1,83 = 10.37, p = 0.002; Diet × Dose,
F1,83 = 4.10, p = 0.046), as drug-treated rats’ intake in the
Palatable food group did not differ from that of Chow
controls.
Experiment 5: Effects of the TAAR1 Agonist RO5256390
on Conditioned Food Reward
Rats in all conditions were matched to spend a similar
amount of time in the least preferred compartment, as
revealed by similar preconditioning CPP scores (Diet,
F1,71 = 0.27, p = 0.635; Dose, F1,71 = 0.38, p = 0.541; Diet ×
Dose: F1,71 = 0.31, p = 0.577; Figure 3b). The analysis of the
post-conditioning CPP scores indicated that, under vehicle
condition, rats in the Palatable, but not Chow food group,
displayed place conditioning, as they spent significantly more
time in the initial non-preferred compartment as compared
with their score in the pre-conditioning phase (biased
protocol). However, RO5256390, injected at the 10 mg/kg
dose, fully blocked the expression of the place preference in
rats in the Palatable food group, as their post-conditioning
score did not significantly differ from their pre-conditioning

In the second order schedule of reinforcement, the analysis
of the first interval, which occurs before food ingestion,
revealed that the rats in the Palatable food group showed
a higher number of active lever responses compared with
the Chow control rats (Diet, F1,14 = 6.52, p = 0.023; Figure

on Anxiety-like Behavior
When anxiety-like behavior was assessed in Chow and
Palatable food groups using the defensive withdrawal test,
under vehicle conditions the two diet groups did not differ in
the latency to exit the sheltered chamber (Diet, F1,39 = 0.28,
p = 0.600; Figure 4a/left). In addition, latency was not

by

treatment
(Dose,

vehicle-treated Chow and Palatable food groups rats did not
differ in the time spent in the sheltered chamber (Diet,

not affect the time spent in the sheltered chamber either
(Dose,

15 μg per side dose). No effect was observed in control Chow
rats,

Conversely,
when

was

DISCUSSION
RO5256390 Blocks Binge-like Eating and Reduces the
Rate of Palatable Food Intake
In this study, we found that the selective TAAR1 agonist
RO5256390 dose dependently blocked binge eating of highly
palatable food induced by a 1 h per day limited access
procedure. Drug treatment was effective at all doses tested,
and the highest dose (10 mg/kg) reduced palatable food
intake by 51.2 ± 4.4% (M ± SEM). This effect was selective
for the palatable diet, as the standard chow control intake
was unaffected by drug treatment. Therefore, drug effect was
not secondary to an overall behavioral deficit and was
specific for palatability-rather than energy homeostatic-
dependent food consumption.
Consistent with a palatability-selective effect, the highest
dose (10 mg/kg) of RO5256390 did not affect standard chow
diet overeating induced by a food restriction procedure,
excluding the alternative interpretation that drug effects were
dependent on a high rate of responding. Notably, our food
restriction protocol was performed over 12 days before any
pharmacological treatment, a time sufficient to induce
neurochemical and behavioral adaptations in the reward
system, which increase susceptibility to drugs of abuse
(D'Cunha et al, 2013). Further evidence of a palatability-
selective effect of RO5256390 was provided by the analysis of
the IFIs. As a result of the increased palatability of the diet,
responding in binge eating rats was characterized by highly
clustered and short IFIs, as opposed to the much more
diffuse and long IFIs of chow control rats. The increased

 sustained eating rate was independent from the high rate of
response, as food-restricted rats, which ate the same number
of pellets as rats bingeing on the palatable diet, ate much
more slowly and in a longer time frame. Treatment with
RO5256390 selectively decreased the rate and the regularity
of pellet-to-pellet responding in binge eating rats, without
affecting responding for standard chow in either ad libitum
fed or food-restricted rats. Thus, agonism of TAAR1
specifically disrupted the ability of palatable food, but not
standard chow (consumed at any rate of response or in any
feeding state) to sustain clustered feeding responses. Overall,
these findings strengthen the concept that, despite being
quantitatively
equivalent,
binge
eating
induced
by
an
increased palatability of the food is different at a behavioral,
pharmacological, and neurobiological level than overeating
induced by increased energy needs due to food restriction/
deprivation (Cottone et al, 2012).
The observed decrease in palatable food responding
following RO5256390 treatment is in line with previous
reports obtained with full agonists of TAAR1. RO5256390
was able to decrease, as well as slow down, responding for
chocolate flavored pellets at the 10, but not the 3 mg/kg dose
(Pei et al, 2014). Here we observed that the decrease in
palatable food responding occurs at all the doses tested (1, 3
and 10 mg/kg). However, in the previous study the rats’
intake was capped to 40 food pellets per session (Pei et al,
2014), whereas here rats obtained an average of 332.8 ± 19.0
(M ± SEM) palatable pellets. Furthermore, our data are
consistent with a recent study showing that the TAAR1 full
agonist RO5166017 was able to reduce the intake of a high-
fat diet in diet-induced obesity mice (Raab et al, 2016).
RO5256390 Blocks Compulsive-like Eating
We observed that RO5256390 blocked compulsive-like eating
behavior in a light/dark box conflict test. Compulsivity is a
behavioral construct observed in multiple disorders, includ-
ing addictions, as well as certain disorders of pathological
eating, where maladaptive behavior perseverates in spite of
medical, psychological, emotional, and social impairment
(APA, 2013; Gearhardt et al, 2014). In our conditions,
feeding is suppressed when the control rats face the aversive
bright compartment of the light/dark box, whereas bingeing
rats compulsively consume the palatable diet in face of the
potentially risky circumstances (Cottone et al, 2012; Dore
et al, 2014; Velazquez-Sanchez et al, 2014). TAAR1 activation
fully blocked compulsive eating of palatable food, reducing
intake in the bright compartment by 75.8 ± 8.2% (M ± SEM)
as compared with vehicle-treated rats in the same group.
Importantly, the alternative interpretation that this effect was
induced by a potential anxiogenic profile of drug treatment
can be confidently excluded as RO5256390 exerted no effect
on either anxiety- or depressive-like behavior.

 RO5256390 Blocks the Strength of Palatable-food-
associated Stimuli
In this study, RO5256390 blocked the strength of palatable-
food associated stimuli in driving behavior, as observed in
two different tasks: the CPP test, which measures food
reward, and the second-order schedule of reinforcement,
which measures food-seeking behavior. Evolutionarily, food,
and in particular energy-dense highly palatable food, has the
ability to increase the salience of associated contextual
stimuli. Through this mechanism, contextual stimuli can,
therefore, exert a strong control over behavior even in
absence of food per se, and in pathological conditions they
have the power to initiate and sustain binge eating (Giuliano
and Cottone, 2015). Our results show that tactile and visual
cues associated with the highly palatable food were able to
induce a strong place preference, unlike stimuli associated to
the standard chow diet. We observed that RO5256390
treatment fully and selectively blocked the expression of
CPP in rats of the Palatable food group. Furthermore, a
palatable food-associated stimulus light was able to induce a
vigorous food-seeking behavior in a second-order schedule
of reinforcement (Everitt and Robbins, 2000), which was
fully and selectively blocked by RO5256390 treatment.
Importantly, the drug effect on food seeking was observed
during the first interval, and, therefore, before food ingestion
occurred, suggesting an effect on incentive value of palatable
food. Once again, we can confidently exclude that this effect
was induced by an overall behavioral deficit induced by the
drug as inactive lever responding was unaffected. In addition,
responding for the cue associated with the standard chow
diet was not affected by drug treatment.
Role of mPFC TAAR1 in Binge-like Eating of Palatable
Food
In this study, we found that binge-like eating of palatable
food decreased TAAR1 protein levels in the mPFC. The
mPFC is a key area involved in inhibitory control and
decision making, and dysfunctions of this region are thought
to contribute to compulsive, binge-like eating behavior
(Blasio et al, 2014; Calu et al, 2013; Cottone et al, 2012;
Mena et al, 2013). TAAR1 KO mice have been shown to
display behaviors consistent with cortical dysfunctions, such

Neuropsychopharmacology
 as perseverative behavior and impulsivity; consistently,
TAAR1 agonism improves these behaviors in wild-type
animals (Espinoza et al, 2015), suggesting that a deficiency in
TAAR1, like the one we observed in the mPFC of rats in the
Palatable food group, may result in deficits in cognitive
function and behavioral flexibility. Therefore, it can be
hypothesized that TAAR1 agonism may reduce compulsive,
binge eating of palatable food by normalizing the palatable-
induced impairment in TAAR1 signaling in the mPFC. In
support of this hypothesis, as well as of a functional role of
the TAAR1 protein reduction observed in mPFC, is our
finding that intra-mPFC administration of the TAAR1
agonist decreased binge-like eating in rats from the Palatable
food group, without affecting the intake of regular chow.
Interestingly, only intra-IL (and not intra-PrL) administra-
tion of TAAR1 reduced intake in binge eating rats,
supporting the widely accepted notion that these two
subregions have separable roles in behavior due to their
very distinct connectivity. It should be acknowledged that,
although unlikely, a potential explanation for the differential
effect of RO5256390 microinfusion within either the IL or
the PrL cortices may be the large variability of operant
responding under vehicle conditions in the two cohorts of
rats. Of relevance in this context are the observations that the
IL has been shown to have elevated basal dopamine levels as
compared with PrL, potentially consistent with higher
dopaminergic innervation, and that the IL subregion is
crucial for the development and expression of inflexible
reward seeking, as well as habitual behavior (Barker et al,
2014). To be noted is that the degree of reduction observed
following intra-IL RO5256390 microinfusion was lower than
that observed following intraperitoneal administration of the
drug, suggesting that other TAAR1-expressing brain areas in
addition to the IL may be contributing to the systemic drug
effects (eg ventral tegmental area, dorsal raphe, and so on).
CONCLUSIONS
The TAAR1 system has been reported to regulate the
behavioral actions of drugs of abuse. Indeed, consistent with
our results, TAAR1 agonists were shown to be able to block
cocaine seeking (Pei et al, 2014), suppress the reinforcing
and rewarding effects of cocaine (Pei et al, 2015), attenuate
cocaine
behavioral
sensitization,
and
reinstatement
of
cocaine seeking, as well as the expression of cocaine-
induced CPP (Liu et al, 2016; Thorn et al, 2014). In line
with the results from the pharmacological studies, TAAR1
KO mice
display heightened
locomotor
response and
context-dependent locomotor sensitization to amphetamine,
and increased sensitivity to reinstatement of amphetamine-
induced
CPP,

mice
(Harkness et al, 2015; Lindemann et al, 2008; Lynch et al,
2013; Sukhanov et al, 2016; Wolinsky et al, 2007). It is
hypothesized that TAAR1 involvement on drug-related
behaviors may occur through the modulation of dopami-
nergic transmission. Indeed, TAAR1 knockout mice display
a spontaneously elevated firing rate of dopaminergic neurons
in the ventral tegmental area (Lindemann et al, 2008), and
TAAR1 agonists have been shown to suppress the firing of
dopamine neurons (Bradaia et al, 2009; Lindemann et al,
2008; Revel et al, 2011), suggesting that endogenous TAAR1
activation may dampen dopaminergic neuronal firing.
Therefore, here it can be speculated that the effects of
TAAR1 agonism on food reward may occur through
modulation of the dopaminergic terminals in the mPFC.
Palatable food consumption activates the reward circuitry
and releases dopamine in the mPFC (Babbs et al, 2013;
Volkow et al, 2008). In addition, limited access to palatable
food results in neuroadaptations in the reward circuitries,
which contribute to compulsive overeating (Volkow et al,
2013). Moreover, obese and binge eating individuals display
sensitized responses to conditioned food cues, such as
increased prefrontal activation as well as higher dopamine
release when exposed to food cues (Dimitropoulos et al,
2012). Hence, the observed effects of TAAR1 activation on
food reward may be due to the ability of RO5256390
treatment to restore an impaired prefrontocortical dopami-
nergic transmission induced by excessive consumption of
highly palatable food, although additional studies will be
needed to confirm this hypothesis.
In summary, our results substantiate the potential for
RO5256390 as a pharmacological treatment for disorders
characterized by compulsive, binge eating.
