Retinal Tumors: Understanding Clinical
Features, OCT Morphology, and Therapy
Carol L. Shields, MD1, and Jerry A. Shields, MD1
Abstract
Purpose: To review the current state of the art of retinal tumors with respect to clinical features, imaging, and management.
Methods: Review of published literature and personal experience from an ocular oncology service. Results: There are several
tumors that arise from the sensory retina including those of glial origin (astrocytic hamartoma, acquired astrocytoma, and solitary cir-
cumscribed retinal astrocytic proliferation), neural origin (retinoblastoma), and vascular origin (hemangioblastoma, cavernous heman-
gioma, racemose hemangioma, and vasoproliferative tumor). Most retinal tumors are benign with the exception of retinoblastoma and
retinal metastasis. Some retinal tumors are associated with systemic oculoneurocutaneous syndromes such as tuberous sclerosis
complex(TSC),13qdeletionsyndrome,VonHippel–Lindaudisease,and systemiccavernousandracemosehemangiomasyndromeswith
ocular, cutaneous, neurologic, and other findings. Regarding management, recent data indicate that retinal astrocytic hamartoma and
retinal achromic patch are key to the diagnosis of TSC and imply greater risk for brain and kidney tumors. Some children with TSC
respond to mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, controlling brain, kidney, and eye tumors. Children with retinoblastoma are all
screened genetically, and systemic evaluation is provided for detection of metastasis and secondary-related tumors. Newer chemo-
therapy regimens by intravenous or intra-arterial routes have revolutionized retinoblastoma control. Retinal vascular tumors are
uncommonbutcanhaveserioussystemicimplications.Therefore,imagingofthebrainforrelatedcerebellarhemangioblastoma,midbrain
racemose hemangioma, or multifocal cavernomas is performed. Genetic testing for each disease can be revealing. Conclusions: Retinal
tumors are often benign, can be recognized by clinical and imaging features, and can be associated with important systemic syndromes.

Introduction
The Founders Award of the American Society of Retina Spe-
cialists is an annual award bestowed upon a member in honor of
the founding ‘‘fathers’’ of the Vitreous Society, including Jerald
A. Bovino, MD, Roy A. Levit, MD, and Allen Z. Verne, MD.
The Vitreous Society was established in 1982 to represent, in an
open and unrestricted fashion, the rapidly growing number of
retina specialists in the United States and abroad and to promote
camaraderie, exchange of information, and progress in the field
of retina. In 2002, the society name was amended to The
American Society of Retina Specialists to better represent the
entirety of its membership including those physicians who
specialize in surgical retina, medical retina, uveitis, ocular
oncology, and retinal research. Currently, the membership tops
3000 retina specialists from the United States and approximately
60 other countries. In this study, we share with you the 2016
Founders Award Lecture on the subject of retinal tumors.
There are several neoplasms, both benign and malignant,
that can arise in the sensory retina.1-3 Tumors in the retina can
arise from the glial cells (astrocytic hamartoma, acquired astro-
cytoma), neural tissue (retinoblastoma), and vascular tissue
(hemangioma, hemangioblastoma). Some of these tumors can
be associated with systemic oculoneurocutaneous syndromes.
Less common tumors such as solitary circumscribed retinal
astrocytic proliferation (SCRAP) and retinal metastasis have
been reported.

 In this report, we review the pertinent, current clinical and
imaging features of retinal tumors. In particular, we highlight
recently published information on specific tumors that have
improved our understanding on clinical features, systemic rela-
tionships, and therapeutic outcomes.
Astrocytic Hamartoma
Astrocytic Hamartoma Compared to Other Glial Tumors
The retinal glial tumors include astrocytic hamartoma,
acquired astrocytoma, and SCRAP. These lesions are usually
benign and can have overlapping clinical features, but there are
important differences. Astrocytic hamartoma tends to occur in
children as a quiescent, asymptomatic retinal mass with mini-
mal potential for growth, whereas acquired astrocytoma tends
to occur in an older age-group, more often in the peripapillary
region, and can be associated with more aggressive features of
exudative retinopathy, macular edema, vision loss, and occa-
sionally slow tumor enlargement. Solitary circumscribed ret-
inal astrocytic proliferation is a recently described condition
seen as a pearl-white nodule in older patients.
Clinical Features and Relationship of Astrocytic
Hamartoma With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex
Retinal astrocytic hamartoma can be translucent and quite subtle
when small, appearing as an ill-defined thickening of the inner
retina,oftenwithslightretinaltraction(Figure1).4-6Largertumors
are more opaque, often with glistening intrinsic calcification and
mild retinal vascular traction and typically without dilated feeder
vessels. These features serve to differentiate this tumor from reti-
noblastoma, which shows ‘‘chalk-white’’ calcification, with little
to no retinal traction and dilated feeder vessels. Astrocytic hamar-
toma is usually stable, but vitreous or subretinal hemorrhage can
occur. Rarely, this tumor can grow uncontrollably, leading to total
retinal detachment and neovascular glaucoma.7
Retinal astrocytic hamartoma can occur as a manifestation of
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). A solitary astrocytic hamar-
toma may or may not be associated with TSC, whereas patients
with multifocal tumors likely have underlying TSC. The TSC is a
multisystem disorder that primarily involves the skin, brain, and
eye. This autosomal dominant condition displays 2 genetic loci
including 9q34 (TSC1) and 16p13 (TSC2). These 2 sites control
products of hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2) that act syner-
gistically to regulate cellular growth and differentiation. Dereg-
ulation of these products leads to hamartomatous tumors.
The diagnostic criteria for TSC were established by the Tuber-
ous Sclerosis Consensus Conference in 1998 (Table 1).8,9 A
definitediagnosisofTSCisestablishedbythepresenceof2major
or 1 major plus 2 minor features. There are 2 important eye
findings incorporated in these criteria, including retinal astrocytic
hamartoma as a major criterion and retinal achromic patch as a
minor criterion. Retinal achromic patch is a focal region of retinal
pigment epithelial (RPE) loss, appearing as a pinpoint or slightly
larger RPE ‘‘punched out’’ depigmentation.10 Shields et al

 reviewed the fundus features of 112 eyes of 56 patients with
retinal astrocytic hamartoma and found retinal achromic patch
in 12 (21%) patients, appearing as solitary or multifocal, round
or oval flat RPE defects of approximately 0.5 mm diameter that
are located throughout the fundus.10
Relationship of Retinal Astrocytic Hamartoma
and Retinal Achromic Patch With Systemic Findings
Aronow et al investigated the correlation of retinal findings in
TSCwithsystemicfindings.11Inareviewof211patientsfromthe
Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance and 132 patients from the Cleveland
Clinic TSC program who had retinal evaluation, they found ret-
inal astrocytic hamartoma in 34% and 36%, respectively, and
retinal achromic patch in 2% and 12%, respectively. If either
lesion was present, this served as a marker for TSC systemic
problems including subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (37%;
P ¼ .018), renal angiomyolipoma (60%; P ¼ .003), cognitive
impairment (77%; P ¼ .002), and epilepsy (91%; P ¼ .022).11
Optical Coherence Tomography Features of Retinal
Astrocytic Hamartoma
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) reveals astrocytic
hamartoma with sharp borders, arising in the nerve fiber layer
(NFL), compressing the posterior retinal layers and occasion-
ally involving full thickness retina.2,3 In 2006, Shields et al
published the original time domain OCT (TD-OCT) features
of retinal astrocytic hamartoma and observed that this tumor
involved the ‘‘inner portion’’ of the retina and demonstrated
intrinsic optically empty spaces (OES) that appeared ‘‘moth-
eaten,’’ which is attributed to intralesional calcification or cavi-
tation.12 In 2016, Shields et al evaluated higher resolution spec-
tral domain OCT (SD-OCT) in 42 patients with retinal
astrocytic hamartoma and confirmed that the tumor arose in
the NFL in all cases and demonstrated OES in 91% of cases.13
The number of OES per tumor correlated with OES diameter
(P ¼ .01) and macular tumor location (P ¼ .03). The OES size
correlated with tumor basal diameter (P < .01), tumor thickness
(P < .01), calcification (P ¼ .01), and visual acuity (P ¼ .02).13
Pichi et al proposed a clinical/SD-OCT classification of retinal
astrocytichamartomabasedontumorsize,retinaltraction,andSD-
OCT features in 43 patients.14 This classification included type I
(circular/oval, semitransparent, flat, within the NFL), type II
(slightly elevated above NFL, mild surface traction), type III
(calcified, moth-eaten), and type IV (dome-shaped, large single
central cavity). Correlation of the classification with systemic
features revealed type II with greater number of cutaneous plaques
(odds ratio [OR] 65), type III with higher incidence of subependy-
mal giant cell astrocytoma (OR 43), and type IV with higher
incidence of pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis (OR 126).14
Management of Astrocytic Hamartoma
Most retinal astrocytic hamartomas are asymptomatic and non-
progressive, requiring no intervention. Annual examination is
warranted. If there is related serous retinal detachment, then
photodynamic therapy, plaque radiotherapy, or systemic siro-
limus (mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors) can be
employed. Sirolimus is generally employed to control brain
(subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and kidney angiomyo-
lipomas) tumors of TSC. Zhang et al reviewed 7 consecutive
patients with TSC and a total of 20 retinal astrocytic hamarto-
mas who required sirolimus for TSC-related systemic tumor
control and found that the retinal hamartomas showed a
response with mean 14% reduction in thickness over 7 months
of medication.15
Acquired Retinal Astrocytoma
Clinical Features of Acquired Retinal Astrocytoma
The acquired retinal astrocytoma is a rare glial tumor unrelated
to TSC or other syndromes. Unlike astrocytic hamartoma that
is usually found in children, the acquired astrocytoma can
develop at any age, generally occurs in a peripapillary region,
can have slightly dilated feeder vessels, and can occasionally
demonstrate slow progressive growth with exudative retinopa-
thy and rarely vitreous seeding (Figure 2).16 In some

surrounding exudative retinopathy involving the foveal region, imaged by

 instances, this tumor can enlarge and simulate amelanotic
choroidal melanoma. There are no genetic abnormalities asso-
ciated with this condition.
Management of Acquired Retinal Astrocytoma
Management involves control of exudative retinopathy with
intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs),
laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, plaque radio-
therapy, or enucleation.16-18 Those tumors with stable features
and no leakage are monitored.
Solitary Circumscribed Retinal Astrocytic
Proliferation
Clinical Features of SCRAP
This condition was initially described in 2011 by Shields et al
and termed SCRAP.19 This solitary retinal mass usually
demonstrates a striking yellow-white ‘‘pearl-like,’’ circum-
scribed and abruptly elevated mass on the inner retinal surface
(Figure 3).19,20 Occasionally there are surrounding localized
RPE alterations.20 There is no relationship with TSC.
The original description of this rare tumor in 7 patients
revealed median age of 53 years and small tumor size of mean
1.8 mm basal diameter and 1.4 mm in thickness.19 Subsequent
description in 4 additional cases of SCRAP confirmed the
‘‘pearl-white’’ color and round ‘‘snowball’’ configuration and
location in the macula to equatorial region most often.20
Imaging Features of SCRAP
By fluorescein angiography, SCRAP demonstrates notable
hypofluorescence signifying vascular absence and tissue stain-
ing in late frames, suggestive of fibrous tissue.20 By autofluor-
escence, this tumor is completely hypoautofluorescent.20
Ultrasonography depicts a tiny noncalcified intraocular mass,
often barely visible due to the small thickness.
By TD-OCT, this mass demonstrates a vertical ‘‘derby hat’’
configuration with abrupt posterior shadowing.19 Initial
TD-OCT findings lead to speculation that this lesion might
represent focal astrocytic proliferation on the inner retina.19
However, more recent evaluation with SD-OCT reveals the mass
to be mostly localized in the deep retina or even at the level of
the RPE.20 Although the pathogenesis and histopathology are
unknown, this pearly white lesion could represent an unusual
deep glial mass or atypical fibrous metaplasia of the RPE.
Management of SCRAP
The management of SCRAP involves annual monitoring, and
rarely does this tumor enlarge or require treatment. In 1 case, it
was found to spontaneously resolve.21
Retinoblastoma
Clinical Features and Classification of Retinoblastoma
Retinoblastoma is a highly malignant tumor that arises within
the sensory retina, typically in young children.22 The patient

escence of the tumor and adjacent retinal pigment epithelium ‘‘window’’ defect. Optical coherence tomography (C) demonstrating abruptly

 usually present with painless leukocoria or strabismus in chil-
dren under 5 years of age. Retinoblastoma appears as a yellow-
white retinal mass, commonly with surrounding subretinal
fluid and scattered subretinal and vitreous seeding. Dilated,
tortuous retinal feeder vessels are noted. This tumor rarely
produces exudation or traction.
Retinoblastoma can occur as a somatic or germline mutation
on chromosome 13q14 locus. Those with germ line mutation
carry additional risks for pinealoblastoma up to age 5 years and
lifelong risk for the second cancers. Additional risks include 13q
deletion syndrome with facial dysmorphism and failure to thrive.
A new International Classification of Retinoblastoma was
established in 2003. This classification is based on tumor
extent and seeding as follows: group A—small tumor(s)
�3 mm in size; group B—tumor(s) >3 mm size or location
within 1.5 mm of the optic disc and/or foveola, or with sub-
retinal fluid; group C—tumor(s) with localized subretinal/
vitreous seeding; group D—tumor(s) with nonlocalized sub-
retinal/vitreous seeding; group E—massive tumor(s) filling
>50% of the globe or iris neovascularization and/or with vitr-
eous hemorrhage (Table 2).22-24
The OCT Features of Retinoblastoma and Detection
of Subclinical (Invisible) Tumors
The use of SD-OCT for retinoblastoma in young children is
usually performed in the operating room under general sedation
of the child using a handheld device. This allows for precise
monitoring of small tumors in their entirety and larger tumor
margins, especially those encroaching the foveal region.25-29
The SD-OCT can improve detection of clinically invisible small
retinoblastomas and is often useful for prediction of visual out-
come following treatment, as the foveal status can be depicted
(Figure 4). Saktanasate et al documented clinically invisible
retinoblastoma seen only on SD-OCT as an ovoid lesion in the
outer nuclear layer.27 Rootman et al described SD-OCT features
of small retinoblastomas showing spherical and isodense appear-
ance, with smooth distinct border, and located mostly in the
inner nuclear layer.25 Although the retinal layer of retinoblas-
toma cell of origin is still under debate, SD-OCT demonstrates
tiny retinoblastoma generally in the outer nuclear layer.25,27,29
Additionally, SD-OCT is currently being employed for detec-
tion of subclinical recurrence following therapy.30
In addition to tumor imaging, SD-OCT allows precise
foveal imaging, providing estimation of visual potential.26,28
Cao et al used SD-OCT to evaluate 3 eyes with retinoblastoma
before and after chemotherapy, noting foveolar morphology
reconstituted in all cases.26 They also recognized that small
retinoblastoma demonstrates abrupt transition from normal to
tumor-laden retina. Other various configurations of the fovea
with tumor has been described including regressed retinoblas-
toma and fovea admixed, fovea draped over remnant scar, and
normal fovea immediately adjacent to a regressed tumor.
Management of Retinoblastoma in the Developed
and Undeveloped World
According to Kivela, there are approximately 8000 cases of
retinoblastoma annually worldwide.31 In 2009, patient survival
was estimated to parallel economic status, as survival was about

 30% in Africa, 60% in Asia, 80% in Latin American, and 95%
to 97% in Europe and North America, respectively.31 In many
nations, particularly in Africa, enucleation is the only available
therapy. In developed nations, methods of chemotherapy prevail
and enucleation is reserved for the most advanced cases.32-34
In developed countries, there has been remarkable progress
over the past decade in the management of retinoblastoma.32-34
Newer therapies using chemotherapy by intravenous, intra-
arterial, and intravitreal routes have greatly improved tumor
control, globe salvage, and visual acuity. According to the
International Classification of Retinoblastoma, intravenous
chemotherapy provides successful control (without need for
enucleation or external beam radiotherapy) in 100% of group
A, 93% of group B, 90% of group C, 47% of group D, and 25%
of group E.23 Intra-arterial chemotherapy provides control of

comparison of intravenous versus intra-arterial chemotherapy for
unilateral retinoblastoma found significantly better tumor control
with intra-arterial chemotherapy for eyes with group D disease.35
This success must be balanced against potential complications of
intra-arterial chemotherapy with ischemic events to the eye and
brain.36,37 Most recently, Shields et al have recognized a higher
than expected risk for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in eyes
treated with intra-arterial chemotherapy, particularly those with
endophytic tumors.38 They speculated that the rapid tumor
response following chemotherapy left gaping holes in the retina
that subsequently lead to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.38
Retinal Hemangioblastoma
Clinical Features of Retinal Hemangioblastoma and
Relationship With Von Hippel–Lindau Syndrome
Retinal hemangioblastoma is a benign, vascular hamartoma
that usually is detected in the first 2 decades of life. Bilateral
or multiple retinal hemangioblastomas are associated with Von
Hippel–Lindau (VHL) syndrome, and patients should be eval-
uated for this condition with brain and renal imaging (Table 3).
Solitary retinal hemangioblastoma may or may not be associ-
ated with VHL syndrome.

 Retinal hemangioblastoma appears as a reddish orange
mass, randomly located in the fundus, and with dilated and
tortuous feeding retinal artery and draining vein (Figure 5).1,39
This tumor produces subretinal fluid, subretinal and intraretinal
exudation, and vitreoretinal fibrosis. Those tumors located near
or on the optic disc might not display a feeding vessel. Regard-
less of tumor location, accumulation of subretinal fluid with
exudation can lead to profound visual loss.
In the VHL syndrome, the stromal cells have mutation on
chromosome 3p25-26, which leads to dysfunctional VHL pro-
tein.40-44 These cells cannot degrade hypoxia-indicible factor
1a, which causes production of VEGF, platelet-derived growth
factor, erythropoietin, and transforming growth factor alpha, all
of which lead to proliferation and vascularization of the tumor.
There are 3 types of mutation in the VHL gene including type
1 with deletion or nonsense mutation and manifesting mainly
hemangioblastomas only; type 2 with missense mutation at risk
for hemangioblastomas and pheochromocytomas (type 2A) or
additional renal cell carcinoma (type 2B) or only pheochromo-
cytoma (type 2C); and type 3 with risk for polycythemia.
Imaging of Retinal Hemangioblastoma
The most efficientstudyfor detectionof retinal hemangioblastoma
is fluorescein angiography. This test characteristically shows rapid
filling of the vascular tumor through a feeding artery and rapid exit
throughadrainingvein.Largertumorsshowleakageoffluorescein
dye from the mass into the adjacent retina and vitreous cavity.
Optical coherence tomography can depict the intraretinal
tumor, typically occupying full thickness retina as an optically
dense mass, with related subretinal fluid, intraretinal edema,
and epiretinal membrane.2,3 The OCT is important in judging
treatment response, particularly with resolution of macular
findings. Schoen et al has illustrated clinically invisible,
asymptomatic retinal hemangioblastoma detection by
SD-OCT in twins with known family history of VHL.45
Management of Retinal Hemangioblastoma
Management of retinal hemangioblastoma consists of both sys-
temic and ocular monitoring. Systemic evaluation includes
testing for VHL-related tumors, such as cerebellar hemangio-
blastoma, pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, and others
according to published protocols.
The treatment of a retinal hemangioblastoma varies with
tumor size and location.46-51 All hemangioblastomas associated
with VHL are considered for treatment. If the tumor is of small
size (<3 mm), laser photocoagulation or photodynamic therapy
can be used; if medium size (3-6 mm), photodynamic therapy or
cryotherapy is considered; large tumors (>6 mm) might respond
to photodynamic therapy or cryotherapy but usually require pla-
que radiotherapy or internal resection by pars plana vitrectomy.

 There have been anecdotal cases that have shown response
to oral propranolol, oral acetazolamide, and oral prednisolone,
but large studies have not been performed. Intravitreal anti-
VEGFs have not been successful for tumor control but can
assist with related macular edema.50
In an analysis of retinal hemangioblastomas in 335 patients
with VHL, Wong et al found tumor location in the periphery
(85%) or juxtapapillary (15%) regions.51 They noted that visual
outcome depended on tumor location, number of tumors, and
extent of tumors. Compared to peripheral tumor only, risk for
ultimate visual acuity of <20 of 160 was increased for juxtapapil-
lary tumor (OR 2.9) and combination juxtapapillary and periph-
eral tumors (OR 6.4). Compared to fewer peripheral tumors, risk
for visual acuity of <20 of 160 was increased for �3 peripheral
tumors(OR4.2)and�5peripheraltumors(OR8.3).Comparedto
<1 quadrant of tumor(s), poor visual acuity of <20 of 160 was
increased for �1 quadrant of tumors (OR 26.6).51
Retinal Racemose Hemangioma
Clinical Features of Retinal Racemose Hemangioma
The retinal racemose hemangioma is a simple or complex arter-
iovenous communication that can occur as a solitary condition
or as a manifestation of Wyburn-Mason syndrome (also called
Bonnet-Dechaume-Blanc syndrome), which is anatomically
referred to as retinoencephalofacial angiomatosis.1,52-55 This
arteriovenous malformation can affect the retina, visual path-
ways, midbrain, and facial bones including the mandible and
maxilla. There is no hereditary tendency.
The retinal racemose hemangioma is characterized by a
large, dilated, tortuous retinal artery emanating from the optic
disc into the retina, with communication directly with a dilated
retinal vein that passes back into the optic disc (Figure 6).53-59
This anomaly can be a simple vascular anomaly or a complex
vascular arrangement. There is rarely exudation or hemor-
rhage, unless a branch retinal vein obstruction occurs. The
Archer classification has organized this condition according
to the size and location of the malformation (Table 4).52
There is evidence that genetic or developmental factors
occur early in gestation that leads to dysgenesis of the embry-
ologic vascular plexus. The time of insult determines the loca-
tion and extent of manifestations.
Management of Retinal Racemose Hemangioma
The management of retinal racemose hemangioma includes
both systemic and ophthalmic monitoring. Magnetic resonance
imaging ofthe brainisrecommendedtoevaluateforsimilaranom-
aly in the midbrain, mandible, or other sites. The retinal anomaly
generally remains stable, and treatment is rarely indicated.
Retinal Cavernous Hemangioma
Clinical Features of Retinal Cavernous Hemangioma
Retinal cavernous hemangioma is a venous-fed vascular mass
that can be associated with similar cutaneous and central ner-
vous system cavernous tumors (cavernoma). The retinal caver-
nous hemangioma appears as a cluster of dark-blue intraretinal
venous aneurysms, sometimes resembling ‘‘concord grapes’’
and located along the course of a vein.1,60-67 This tumor can
be asymptomatic or associated with visual impairment result-
ing from vitreous hemorrhage, macular scarring, and retinal
traction. This mass can be located in a peripapillary or

glial tissue on the hemangioma surface is common, suggesting
prior vitreous or preretinal hemorrhage. This tumor is usually
nonprogressive but can rarely show minimal enlargement. The
main complication is vitreous hemorrhage.
Retinal cavernous hemangioma can be found with cerebral
cavernous malformations (CCM) as a sporadic or familial auto-
somal dominant disorder with incomplete penetrance. Mag-
netic resonance imaging of the brain is suggested in all
patients. There are 3 CCM genes including CCM/KRIT1,
CCM2/MGC4607, and CCM3/PDCD10.65,66 The CCM3 is
related to a higher risk for cerebral hemorrhage in childhood.
Imaging of Retinal Cavernous Hemangioma
The most useful diagnostic test is fluorescein angiography,
which reveals hypofluorescence in the arterial phase and
slowly gravity-dependent fluorescence in the late angiograms.
The fluorescein is contained within the mass and occupies the
superior portion of each cavernous aneurysm, whereas red
blood cells occupy the inferior portion. There is no dye leakage.
This produces a ‘‘fluorescein-erythrocyte interface’’ in the late
angiogram characteristic for cavernous hemangioma.
Vitreous hemorrhage can obscure visibility of cavernous
hemangioma, and ultrasonography can depict the underlying
irregular, acoustically solid mass.
Optical coherence tomography demonstrates the numerous
cavernous spaces within the inner and outer retina causing an
irregular retinal surface.2,3,55
Management of retinal cavernous hemangioma. Management of
this condition includes systemic and ocular monitoring. Brain
magnetic resonance imaging is suggested for detection of caver-
noma. Most retinal tumors require no treatment. For those with
vitreous hemorrhage, observation or vitrectomy is employed.
For repetitive hemorrhage, the tumor can be sclerosed with pla-
que radiotherapy or cryotherapy. Genetic testing for the CCM
genes is advised, especially if there is positive family history.
Retinal Vasoproliferative Tumor
Clinical Features of Retinal Vasoproliferative Tumor
The retinal vasoproliferative tumor is a vascular mass that typi-
cally occurs in the peripheral retina and can lead to exudative
retinopathy, epiretinal membrane, and remote macular edema
and exudation. This lesion can occur as a primary (80%) or
secondary (20%) tumor (Table 5 and Figures 8 and 9).68-71 The
most common predisposing diseases include retinitis pigmen-
tosa, pars planitis, Coats disease, and chronic retinal detach-
ment.68,70 Secondary vasoproliferative tumor follows the
primary eye disease by a mean of 13 years. A comparison of
clinical features (primary vs secondary tumors) revealed signif-
icant differences (P < .05) in mean age at presentation (46 vs
38 years), visual symptoms (74% vs 87%), poor visual acuity
worse than 20 of 200 (15% vs 28%), bilaterality (4% vs 20%),
multifocality(5% vs15%),postequatorialtumorlocation(20% vs
33%), tumor basal dimension (6 vs 7 mm), anterior chamber cells
(16% vs 30%), and vitreous cells (19% vs 48%).68 The retinal
vasoproliferative tumor typically has no systemic associations

 except for rare cases associated with neurofibromatosis and some
patients with chronic hypertension or hyperlipidemia.71
This mass appears as a sessile or dome-shaped tumor usually
situated in the inferotemporal equatorial region. Occasionally,
this tumor is ill-defined and appears as a fusiform peripheral
retinal thickening. The feeding retinal artery and draining vein
are usually minimally dilated but not to the extent seen with
retinal hemangioblastoma. Vision loss from intraretinal and sub-
retinal exudation, subretinal fluid, remote epiretinal membrane,
cystoid macular edema, retinal hemorrhage, and vitreous hemor-
rhage can occur. The exudation typically commences at the
tumor margin and gradually creeps posteriorly into the macular
region. There are no genetic abnormalities associated with this
condition, but for those associated with underlying retinitis pig-
mentosa or neurofibromatosis, testing can be explored.
Imaging of Retinal Vasoproliferative Tumor
By fluorescein angiography, slightly dilated and minimally
tortuous retinal artery and draining vein are present. Slow-
onset hyperfluorescence with late staining and leakage is com-
mon. By OCT, remote epiretinal membrane and macular edema
are often detected. The OCT of retinal vasoproliferative tumor
is not often possible as the tumor is usually too peripheral for
imaging, but in selected cases where imaging was achieved,
this mass shows full thickness replacement of retinal tissue
with ill-defined mass and intralesional cystoid edema.
Management of Retinal Vasoproliferative Tumor
Small peripheral tumors can be cautiously observed if without
leakage. Those with leakage should be treated with laser photo-
coagulation, indocyanine green-enhanced thermoablation,
photodynamic therapy, or plaque radiotherapy.72-76 Intravitreal
anti-VEGF can assist in reducing macular edema, and sub-
Tenon’s fascia injection of triamcinolone can minimize inflam-
matory response at treatment.77 Brockman et al recently
reviewed 39 eyes with vasoproliferative tumors treated with
ruthenium 106 brachytherapy and found tumor control in
72%.76 Tumors at greatest risk for nonresponse included those
with diameter >7.5 mm (relative risk [RR] 8), whereas thick-
ness was not a factor.
Histopathology of the retinal vasoproliferative tumor in the
early phases, when the tumor is mostly vascular, has not been
clearly established, as most patients are treated without biopsy;
however, it is believed to represent a proliferation of blood
vessels, glial tissue, and RPE. Later, as the tumor becomes
more fibrotic, histopathologic evidence of reactive retinal
astrocytic proliferation has been documented.78
Retinal Metastasis
Clinical Features of Retinal Metastasis
Metastatic cancer to the retina is rare. Most intraocular metas-
tases affect the uveal tract, and <1% are found within the
retina.79,80 Metastasis to the retina has been published in single
case reports from breast, lung, gastric, and colon carcinomas as

rounding exudative retinopathy and with minimally dilated feeding vessels.

 well as cutaneous melanoma.80 A series of 8 cases from a single
institution disclosed the most common primary site to be cuta-
neous melanoma, as found in 50% of cases (Figure 10).80 Most
retinal metastases appear as a yellow-white, ill-defined mass
within the sensory retina, often with vitreous seeds or subret-
inal fluid, and commonly mistaken for infectious/inflammatory
retinitis or a vascular mass.
In 2014, Shields et al reviewed 8 cases of retinal metastasis
and commented on the frequent delay in diagnosis, as infec-
tious or inflammatory retinitis was considered prior to referral
in most cases.80 However, retinal metastases show features
different from infectious/inflammatory retinitis in that patients
lack photophobia, vitreous fibrosis, or related cataract. Fluor-
escein angiography shows focal tumor staining but no remote
leakage elsewhere in the fundus. In that series, the tumors
originated from cutaneous melanoma in 4 cases and all
appeared yellow or brown, whereas metastasis from breast
carcinoma appeared yellow and those from lung or esophageal
carcinoma appeared white in color.
In most cases, the primary cancer is established prior to the
detection of the retinal mass, and in rare cases, cutaneous mel-
anoma or other malignancy can be found afterward. In most
cases, systemic metastasis is known prior to or within a few
weeks following ophthalmic diagnosis.
Imaging Features of Retinal Metastasis
On fluorescein angiography, early hypofluorescence with late
hyperfluorescence and staining is typical. Ocular ultrasonogra-
phy depicts the mass as echodense. The OCT demonstrates
inner or full thickness retinal density and possible surrounding
subretinal fluid.
Management of Retinal Metastasis
Fine needle aspiration biopsy into the retinal mass can assist in
establishing the diagnosis. Most patients are managed with
plaque radiotherapy if the tumor is localized, external beam
radiotherapy if the retina is diffuse, enucleation if there is pain,
or observation if the patient is too ill for therapy. Local control
of retinal metastasis is often achieved, but systemic prognosis
is poor with disseminated metastasis leading to death, usually
within a few months.
