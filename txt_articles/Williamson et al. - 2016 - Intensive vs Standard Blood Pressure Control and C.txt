IMPORTANCE The appropriate treatment target for systolic blood pressure (SBP) in older
patients with hypertension remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of intensive (<120 mm Hg) compared with standard
(<140 mm Hg) SBP targets in persons aged 75 years or older with hypertension
but without diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A multicenter, randomized clinical trial of patients aged
75 years or older who participated in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT).
Recruitment began on October 20, 2010, and follow-up ended on August 20, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg
(intensive treatment group, n = 1317) or an SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard
treatment group, n = 1319).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary cardiovascular disease outcome was a
composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome not resulting in a
myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal acute decompensated heart failure, and death
from cardiovascular causes. All-cause mortality was a secondary outcome.
RESULTS Among 2636 participants (mean age, 79.9 years; 37.9% women), 2510 (95.2%)
provided complete follow-up data. At a median follow-up of 3.14 years, there was a
significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcome (102 events in the intensive
treatment group vs 148 events in the standard treatment group; hazard ratio [HR], 0.66
[95% CI, 0.51-0.85]) and all-cause mortality (73 deaths vs 107 deaths, respectively; HR, 0.67
[95% CI, 0.49-0.91]). The overall rate of serious adverse events was not different between
treatment groups (48.4% in the intensive treatment group vs 48.3% in the standard
treatment group; HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.89-1.11]). Absolute rates of hypotension were 2.4% in
the intensive treatment group vs 1.4% in the standard treatment group (HR, 1.71 [95% CI,
0.97-3.09]), 3.0% vs 2.4%, respectively, for syncope (HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.76-2.00]), 4.0% vs
2.7% for electrolyte abnormalities (HR, 1.51 [95% CI, 0.99-2.33]), 5.5% vs 4.0% for acute
kidney injury (HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.98-2.04]), and 4.9% vs 5.5% for injurious falls (HR, 0.91
[95% CI, 0.65-1.29]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among ambulatory adults aged 75 years or older, treating to
an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg compared with an SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg
resulted in significantly lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events
and death from any cause.

ntheUnitedStates,75%ofpersonsolderthan75yearshave
hypertension, for whom cardiovascular disease complica-
tions are a leading cause of disability, morbidity, and
mortality.1-3 Current guidelines provide inconsistent recom-
mendationsregardingtheoptimalsystolicbloodpressure(SBP)
treatment target in geriatric populations.4 European guide-
line committees have recommended treatment initiation only
above 160 mm Hg for persons aged 80 years or older.5 A re-
cent US guideline, a report from the panel appointed to the
Eighth Joint National Committee, recommended a SBP treat-
ment target of 150 mm Hg for adults aged 60 years or older.6
However, a report from a minority of the members argued to
retain the previously recommended SBP treatment goal of
140 mm Hg, highlighting the lack of consensus.7
Whether treatment targets should consider factors such
as frailty or functional status is also unknown. Observational
studies have noted differential associations among elevated
blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular disease, stroke, and
mortality risk when analyses are stratified according to mea-
sures of functional status.8-10 A recent secondary analysis of
the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program showed that
the benefit of antihypertensive therapy was limited to partici-
pants without a self-reported physical ability limitation.11 In
contrast, analyses from the Hypertension in the Very Elderly
Trial (HYVET) showed a consistent benefit with antihyperten-
sive therapy on outcomes irrespective of frailty status.12
The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)
recently reported that participants assigned to an intensive
SBP treatment target of less than 120 mm Hg vs the standard
SBPtreatmentgoaloflessthan140mmHghada25%lowerrela-
tive risk of major cardiovascular events and death, and a 27%
lower relative risk of death from any cause.13 This trial was spe-
cifically funded to enhance recruitment of a prespecified sub-
group of adults aged 75 years or older, and the study protocol
(appearsinSupplement1)alsoincludedmeasuresoffunctional
statusandfrailty.Thisarticledetailsresultsfortheprespecified
subgroup of adults aged 75 years or older with hypertension.
Methods
Population
The design, eligibility, and baseline characteristics of SPRINT
have been described.14 The trial protocol was approved by
the institutional review board at each participating site.
Study participants signed written informed consent and were
required to be at increased risk for cardiovascular disease
(based on a history of clinical or subclinical cardiovascular
disease, chronic kidney disease [CKD], a 10-year Framingham
General cardiovascular disease risk ≥15%, or age ≥75 years). A
person was excluded if he or she had type 2 diabetes, a his-
tory of stroke, symptomatic heart failure within the past 6
months or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (<35%), a
clinical diagnosis of or treatment for dementia, an expected
survival of less than 3 years, unintentional weight loss (>10%
of body weight) during the preceding 6 months, an SBP of
less than 110 mm Hg following 1 minute of standing, or
resided in a nursing home.
Study Measurements
Sociodemographic data were collected at baseline, whereas
both clinical and laboratory data were obtained at baseline and
every 3 months. Race and ethnicity information was ob-
tained via self-report. Blood pressure was determined using
the mean of 3 properly sized automated cuff readings, taken 1
minute apart after 5 minutes of quiet rest without staff in the
room. Gait speed was measured via a timed 4-m walk per-
formed twice at the participant’
s usual pace from a standing
start. The use of an assistive device was permitted if typically
used by the participant to walk short distances. The faster of
the 2 gait speeds (measured in meters/second) was used in the
analysis. Frailty status at randomization was quantified using
a previously reported 37-item frailty index.15
Clinical Outcomes
A committee unaware of treatment assignment adjudicated
theprotocol-specifiedclinicaloutcomes.Theprimarycardiovas-
cular disease outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial
infarction, acute coronary syndrome not resulting in a myocar-
dial infarction, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal acute decompensated
heartfailure,anddeathfromcardiovascularcauses.Secondary
outcomesincludedall-causemortalityandthecompositeofthe
SPRINT primary outcome and all-cause mortality.
The primary renal disease outcome was assessed in par-
ticipants with CKD at baseline (estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate [eGFR] <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 based on the 4-variable
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation). It was based
onthecompositeincidenceofeitheradecreaseineGFRof50%
or greater (confirmed by subsequent laboratory test ≥90 days
later) or the development of end-stage renal disease requir-
inglong-termdialysisortransplantation.Asecondaryrenaldis-
ease outcome (assessed in participants without CKD at base-
line) was based on incidence of a decrease in eGFR from 30%
or greater at baseline to a value less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2
(also confirmed by a subsequent test ≥90 days later).
Definition of Serious Adverse Events
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as events that
were fatal or life threatening, resulted in significant or
persistent disability, required hospitalization or resulted in
prolonged hospitalization, or medical events that the investi-
gator judged to be a significant hazard or harm to the partici-
pant and required medical or surgical intervention to prevent
any of these. The following conditions of interest were
reported as adverse events if they were evaluated in an emer-
gency department: hypotension, syncope, injurious falls,
electrolyte abnormalities, and bradycardia. Episodes of acute
kidney injury (or acute renal failure) were monitored if they
led to hospitalization and were reported in the hospital dis-
charge summary.
Statistical Analysis
Power to detect a 25% treatment effect for the primary out-
comewithinthesubgroupofparticipantsaged75yearsorolder
was estimated assuming an enrollment of 3250. With a 2-year
recruitment period, maximum follow-up of 6 years, and an-
nual loss to follow-up of 2%, power was estimated to be 81.9%,

assuming an event rate of 3.25% per year in the standard treat-
ment group (Appendix B in Supplement 1).
Linear-mixedmodelswithanunstructuredcovariancema-
trix, assuming independence across participants, were used
to model longitudinal differences in SBP between treatment
groups. Fixed effects in the model were BP at randomization
and a treatment group indicator. The time to first occurrence
of the primary composite outcome, all-cause mortality, pri-
mary composite outcome plus all-cause mortality, SAEs, and
loss to follow-up or withdrawing consent were compared be-
tween the 2 randomized groups using Cox proportional haz-
ardsregressionmodelswiththebaselinehazardfunctionstrati-
fied by clinic site (participants were recruited at 100 clinics).
Follow-up time was censored on the date of last event ascer-
tainment on or before August 20, 2015, the date on which the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute director decided to
stop the intervention.
Exploratory secondary analyses were conducted to exam-
inemodificationofthetreatmenteffectbyfrailtystatusandgait
speed. Neither frailty status nor gait speed was a prespecified
subgroup in the trial protocol. We fit separate Cox regression

hazard model of Fine and Gray.19 All hypothesis tests were
2-sided at the 5% level of significance.
Additional analyses compared the total burden of SAEs be-
tween the randomized groups (allowing for recurrent events)
using the mean cumulative count estimator (standard errors
computed using bootstrap resampling).20 Hazard ratios (HRs)
were computed to compare the randomized groups using the
gap-time formation of the Prentice, Williams, and Peterson re-
current events regression model.21 All analyses were per-
formed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) and the R Sta-
tistical Computing Environment (http://www.r-project.org).
Results
Baseline Characteristics and Study Retention
Participants aged 75 years or older were randomized to an SBP
target of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment group,
n = 1317) or an SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard
treatment group, n = 1319) (Figure 1). The treatment groups
were similar for most characteristics with the exception of
frailty status and aspirin use (Table 1). Overall, 815 partici-
pants (30.9%) were classified as frail and 1456 (55.2%) as less
fit (Table 1). A total of 2510 (95.2%) participants provided com-
plete follow-up data.

In the intensive treatment group, 440 participants (33.4%)
were classified as frail compared with 375 participants (28.4%)
in the standard treatment group. A total of 740 participants
(28.1%) were classified as slow walkers (<0.8 m/s). There was
nobaselinetreatmentgroupdifferenceintheproportionofpar-
ticipants classified as slow walkers or in performance on the
Montreal Cognitive Assessment screening test.22
Even though participants who were less fit, frail, or with
reduced gait speed exhibited higher rates of loss to follow-up
or withdrawal of consent, there were no significant differ-
encesbetweenthetreatmentgroupsforfrailtyorlowgaitspeed
(eTable 1 in Supplement 2). The frequency at which partici-
pants discontinued the intervention but continued follow-up
was 6.2% in the intensive treatment group vs 6.4% in the stan-
dard treatment group (P = .87).
Blood Pressure Levels
Throughout follow-up, the mean SBP in the intensive treat-
ment group was 123.4 mm Hg, and it was 134.8 mm Hg in the
standard treatment group. The between-group difference in
mean SBP was 11.4 mm Hg (95% CI, 10.8-11.9 mm Hg), which
is a smaller relative difference than the mean SBP of
14.8 mm Hg observed in the trial overall (Table 2). Mean dia-
stolic BPs during follow-up were 62.0 mm Hg in the inten-
sive treatment group and 67.2 mm Hg in the standard treat-
ment group.
On average, participants in the intensive treatment
group required 1 more medication to reach the achieved
lower BP (eTable 2 and eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). Within
the intensive treatment group, mean SBP during follow-up
was higher for participants classified as less fit or frail com-
pared with those considered fit. Differences in mean SBP by
treatment group differed by frailty status (P = .01), with frail
participants exhibiting smaller intertreatment group differ-
ences (10.8 mm Hg) compared with less fit participants
(11.3 mm Hg) and fit participants (13.5 mm Hg). Treatment
group differences in SBP were similar across subgroups
defined by gait speed.
Clinical Outcomes
A primary composite outcome event was observed for 102
participants (2.59% per year) in the intensive treatment
group and for 148 participants (3.85% per year) in the stan-
dard treatment group (HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.51-0.85];
Table 3). Results were similar for all-cause mortality (there
were 73 deaths in the intensive treatment group and 107
deaths in the standard treatment group; HR, 0.67 [95% CI,
0.49-0.91]). Inference for the primary outcome was
unchanged when non–cardiovascular disease death was
treated as a competing risk (HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.52-0.85]).
At 3.14 years, the number needed to treat (NNT) estimate for
the primary outcome was 27 (95% CI, 19-61) and for all-
cause mortality it was 41 (95% CI, 27-145).
Because the treatment effect estimate was not sta-
tistically significant for cardiovascular disease death, the
NNT estimate (using the abbreviations of Altman23) was an

In participants without CKD at the time of randomization,
more participants in the intensive treatment group com-
pared with the standard treatment group experienced the
secondary CKD outcome (a 30% decrease in eGFR from
baseline to an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 [1.70% vs 0.58%
per year, respectively]; HR, 3.14 [95% CI, 1.66-6.37]). There
were no significant treatment group differences in the pri-
mary renal outcome in those with baseline CKD; however,
power to detect differences was limited due to low numbers
of events.
Exploratory Subgroup Analyses
Resultsstratifiedbybaselinefrailtystatusshowedhigherevent
rates with increasing frailty in both treatment groups (Table 4
and Figure 2). However, within each frailty stratum, absolute
event rates were lower for the intensive treatment group
(P = .84 for interaction). Results were similar when partici-
pantswerestratifiedbygaitspeed(P = .85forinteraction),with
the HRs in favor of the intensive treatment group in each gait
speed stratum (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).
Serious Adverse Events
Detailed information regarding SAEs appears in eTable 3 and
eTable 4 in Supplement 2. Data on SAEs in participants older
than 75 years have been previously reported (Table S613). In
the intensive treatment group, SAEs occurred in 637 partici-
pants (48.4%) compared with 637 participants (48.3%) in the
standard treatment group (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.89-1.11];
P = .90). The absolute rate of SAEs was higher but was not sta-
tisticallysignificantlydifferentintheintensivetreatmentgroup

HR, 1.71 [95% CI, 0.97-3.09]), syncope (3.0% vs 2.4%, respec-

kidney injury or renal failure (5.5% vs 4.0%; HR, 1.41 [95% CI,

lower but was not statistically significantly different in the in-
tensive treatment group (4.9% vs 5.5% in the standard treat-
ment group; HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.65-1.29]).

[95% CI, 0.76-1.07]); however, the absolute rate of ortho-
static hypotension in combination with a report of dizziness
was higher but was not statistically significantly different in
the intensive treatment group (1.9% vs 1.3% in the standard
treatment group; HR, 1.44 [95% CI, 0.77-2.73]). Even though
the SAE rates were higher with greater frailty or slower walk-
ing speed, these rates were not statistically different by treat-
ment group when stratified by frailty status or gait speed.
Discussion
These results extend and detail the main SPRINT study find-
ings in community-dwelling persons aged 75 years or older,
demonstrating that a treatment goal for SBP of less than
120 mm Hg reduced incident cardiovascular disease by 33%
(from3.85%to2.59%peryear)andtotalmortalityby32%(from
2.63%to1.78%peryear).13Translatingthesefindingsintonum-
bers needed to treat suggests that a strategy of intensive BP
control for 3.14 years would be expected to prevent 1 primary
outcome event for every 27 persons treated and 1 death from
any cause for every 41 persons treated. These estimates are
lower than those from the overall results of the trial due to the
higher event rate in persons aged 75 years or older. In addi-
tion, exploratory analysis suggested that the benefit of inten-
sive BP control was consistent among persons in this age range
who were frail or had reduced gait speed.
The overall SAE rate was comparable by treatment group,
including among the most frail participants. There were no dif-
ferences in the number of participants experiencing injuri-
ous falls or in the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension mea-
sured at study visits. These results complement results from
other trials demonstrating improved BP control reduces risk
for orthostatic hypotension and has no effect on risk for inju-
rious falls.24-26 The numbers of participants aged 75 years or
older who dropped out of the study, were lost to follow-up, or
decided to discontinue the intervention but continued with
outcome assessment were low and did not differ by treat-
ment group.
There are several limitations to these results from SPRINT
involving participants aged 75 years or older. Even though the
trialwasdesignedtoenhancerecruitmentofaprespecifiedsub-
groupofadultsaged75yearsorolder,randomizationinSPRINT
was not stratified by categories of age. In addition, the trial did
not enroll older adults residing in nursing homes, persons with
type 2 diabetes or prevalent stroke (because of concurrent BP
lowering trials),27,28 and individuals with symptomatic heart

trol in this condition. Therefore, the results reported in this

study among persons aged 75 years or older do not provide evi-
dence regarding treatment targets in these populations. Indi-
viduals with these conditions also represent a subset of older
persons at increased risk for falls.
No other chronic conditions were excluded from this trial,
and the frailty index applied in this study combined with the
assessment of gait speed contribute to assessing possible ef-
fect modification by comorbidity and functional status. In ex-
ploratory analyses, there was no evidence of heterogeneity for
the cardiovascular benefit of intensive BP management by
frailty or gait speed. However, these analyses should be inter-
preted cautiously. The analyses were not prespecified in the
trialprotocolandwerepossiblyunderpoweredbecauseSPRINT
was designed to consider only the ability to detect a treat-
ment effect in participants aged 75 years or older as a whole.
Despite excluding some chronic conditions, 30.9% of par-
ticipants aged 75 years or older in this trial were categorized
as frail at baseline, and the distribution of frailty status paral-
lels that estimated for ambulatory, community living popula-
tions of similar age.15 In addition, the proportion of US adults
aged 75 years or older who have hypertension and meet the
studyentrycriteriahasbeenestimatedtorepresent64%ofthat
population using the 2007-2012 National Health and Nutri-
tion Surveys (approximately 5.8 million individuals).29 There-
fore, participants aged 75 years or older in this trial are repre-
sentative of a sizeable fraction of adults in this age group with
hypertension.
There are several important comparisons to make with
HYVET,30 which randomized 3845 patients aged 80 years or
older within Europe and Asia (mean age, 83 years [3 years older
than SPRINT]; mean entry SBP, 173 mm Hg [31 mm Hg higher
thanSPRINT])toeithertherapywithindapamide,withorwith-
out the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindo-
pril, or placebo with an SBP treatment goal of less than
150 mm Hg. The 2-year between-group SBP difference was
15 mm Hg (the active treatment group achieved a mean SBP
of 143 mm Hg, slightly higher than the SPRINT baseline SBP).
Similar to SPRINT, HYVET was terminated early (at a median
follow-up time of 1.8 years) due to significant reductions in the
incidence rate of total mortality. A retrospective analysis of the
HYVET population conducted to determine its frailty status
identified that (1) the cohort’
s frailty status was similar to that
ofcommunitylivingpopulationsofsimilarageand(2)thetreat-
mentbenefitsweresimilareveninthemostfrailparticipants.12
Taken together, current results from SPRINT also reinforce and
extend HYVET’
s conclusions that risk reductions in cardio-
vascular disease events and mortality from high BP treat-
ment are evident regardless of frailty status.
Among all participants aged 75 years or older, the SAEs re-
lated to acute kidney injury occurred more frequently in the
intensive treatment group (72 participants [5.5%] vs 53 par-
ticipants [4.0%] in the standard treatment group). The differ-
ences in adverse renal outcomes may be related to a revers-
ible intrarenal hemodynamic effect of the reduction in BP and
more frequent use of diuretics, angiotensin-converting en-
zyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers in the in-
tensive treatment group.31,32 Although there is no evidence of
permanent kidney injury associated with the lower BP goal,
the possibility of long-term adverse renal outcomes cannot be
excluded and requires longer-term follow-up.
Considering the high prevalence of hypertension among
older persons, patients and their physicians may be inclined
to underestimate the burden of hypertension or the benefits
of lowering BP, resulting in undertreatment. On average, the
benefits that resulted from intensive therapy required treat-
ment with 1 additional antihypertensive drug and additional
early visits for dose titration and monitoring. Future analyses

of SPRINT data may be helpful to better define the burden,
costs, and benefits of intensive BP control. However, the
present results have substantial implications for the future of
intensive BP therapy in older adults because of this condi-
tion’
s high prevalence, the high absolute risk for cardiovascu-
lar disease complications from elevated BP, and the devastat-
ing consequences of such events on the independent function
of older people.3,29,33,34
Conclusions
Among ambulatory adults aged 75 years or older, treating to
an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg compared with an SBP
target of less than 140 mm Hg resulted in significantly lower
rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and
death from any cause.
