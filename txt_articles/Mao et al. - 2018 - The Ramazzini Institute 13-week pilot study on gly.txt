Abstract
Background: Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are broad-spectrum herbicides that act on the shikimate
pathway in bacteria, fungi, and plants. The possible effects of GBHs on human health are the subject of an intense
public debate for both its potential carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects, including its effects on microbiome.
The present pilot study examines whether exposure to GBHs at doses of glyphosate considered to be “safe” (the US
Acceptable Daily Intake - ADI - of 1.75 mg/kg bw/day), starting from in utero, may modify the composition of gut
microbiome in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats.
Methods: Glyphosate alone and Roundup, a commercial brand of GBHs, were administered in drinking water at
doses comparable to the US glyphosate ADI (1.75 mg/kg bw/day) to F0 dams starting from the gestational day
(GD) 6 up to postnatal day (PND) 125. Animal feces were collected at multiple time points from both F0 dams and
F1 pups. The gut microbiota of 433 fecal samples were profiled at V3-V4 region of 16S ribosomal RNA gene and
further taxonomically assigned and assessed for diversity analysis. We tested the effect of exposure on overall
microbiome diversity using PERMANOVA and on individual taxa by LEfSe analysis.
Results: Microbiome profiling revealed that low-dose exposure to Roundup and glyphosate resulted in significant
and distinctive changes in overall bacterial composition in F1 pups only. Specifically, at PND31, corresponding to
pre-pubertal age in humans, relative abundance for Bacteriodetes (Prevotella) was increased while the Firmicutes
(Lactobacillus) was reduced in both Roundup and glyphosate exposed F1 pups compared to controls.
Conclusions: This study provides initial evidence that exposures to commonly used GBHs, at doses considered safe,
are capable of modifying the gut microbiota in early development, particularly before the onset of puberty. These
findings warrant future studies on potential health effects of GBHs in early development such as childhood.

 Background
Glyphosate
(IUPAC
chemical
name
N-(phosphono-
methyl) glycine) is the active ingredient of the most
widely applied herbicide worldwide, glyphosate-based
herbicides (GBHs), including the best-known formula-
tion Roundup. The substance glyphosate was initially
discovered in 1950 by a Swiss chemist, Henri Martin, at
the pharmaceutical company Cilag [1]. Its herbicidal
properties were not discovered for another 20 years.
Since glyphosate was patented in 1974 by Monsanto as a
herbicide, approximately 9.4 million tons of GBHs have
been sprayed, nearly half a pound of glyphosate on every
cultivated acre of land globally [2]. Furthermore, after
the introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops that
are glyphosate-tolerant in 1996, usage of GBHs has sky-
rocketed; about two-thirds of the total GBHs usage took
place in recent decades. According to the National
Academy of Sciences report [3], in 2014 alone, annual
glyphosate usage in agriculture industry exceeded 110
million kilograms. Besides GM crops, farmers also apply
GBHs on non-GM crops in order to accelerate the har-
vest. This practice, also known as desiccation, has led to
significant dietary exposure to the residues of glyphosate
and its primary metabolite AMPA (aminomethylpho-
sphonic acid) [4, 5].
The primary herbicidal function of glyphosate is to in-
hibit a key plant enzyme, namely 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-
3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). This enzyme participates
in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids (phenylalan-
ine, tyrosine and tryptophan) via the shikimate pathway in
bacteria, fungi, and plants. The only enzyme known to
catalyze a similar reaction in bacteria is the enzyme MurA
(UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase, EC 2.
5.1.7), which catalyzes the first committed step in the syn-
thesis of the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell.
Growth and survival of bacteria relies on the functionality
of the enzyme MurA that is the target of the broad-
spectrum antibiotic fosfomycin. Glyphosate appears to oc-
cupy a binding site of MurA, mimicking an intermediate
state of the ternary enzyme-substrates complex [6]. The
similarity
between
the
two
enolpyruvyl
transferases
EPSPSe and MurA appears to clarify the antibacterial ac-
tivity of Glyphosate. As the EPSPS-driven pathway does
not exist in vertebrate cells, many scientists and environ-
mental regulating agencies believed that glyphosate would
impose minimal risks to mammals, in particular, humans
[7–9]. For this reason, the shikimate pathway has been the
target for the development of new anti-microbial and
anti-parasite agents. In fact, glyphosate formulation has
been patented as anti-parasite drug [10]. However, several
emerging evidence suggested that glyphosate or GBHs
(such as Roundup) can adversely affect mammalian biol-
ogy via multiple mechanisms [11–13]. Downstream ana-
lyses of the functional interactions between the host and
its microbiome are starting to provide mechanistic in-
sights into these interactions. The mechanisms in which
the enteric microbiome modulates specific effects on the
host is not completely clear, although several mediators
have been suggested as potential vehicles for such influ-
ence and might behave as effectors, enzyme cofactors and
signal molecules. Such mediators include lipopolysaccha-
rides, peptidoglycans, short-chain fatty acids, neurotrans-
mitters and gaseous molecules [14, 15]. Recent advances
in characterizing the composition and function of individ-
ual microbial species and complex microbial communities
are revealing the importance of microbial metabolism for
the host immune system [16]. The gut microbiota pro-
duces an extremely diverse metabolite repertoire (such as
propionic acid, a short-chain fatty acids) from the anaer-
obic fermentation of exogenous undigested dietary com-
ponents (such as fibers) that reach the colon, as well as
endogenous compounds that are generated by microor-
ganisms and the host [17]. The single layer of epithelial
cells that makes up the mucosal interface between the
host and microorganisms allows microbial metabolic
products to gain access to and interact with host cells, and
thus influence immune responses and disease risk, in
particular at high concentration [18].
GBHs have been reported to alter microbiota in soil
[19], plants [20] and animals [21, 22]. A number of stud-
ies have suggested that GBHs could act as antibiotics in
the mammalian gut microbiome. Recent studies have
raised concerns about the health effects of glyphosate on
gut microbiota of farm animal when fed feed containing
residues of glyphosate. For example, farm animal studies
linked epidemics of C. Botulinum-mediated diseases in
dairy cows [23] to glyphosate exposure. It has been pro-
posed that glyphosate has a potential inhibiting effect on
growth of commensal bacteria, normally occupying the
gut of farm animals. For example, a reduction of such
beneficial bacteria could be a predisposing factor for
Campylobacteriosis (campylobacter infection) described
as an emerging food-borne disease [24]. Poultry is a
major reservoir and source of transmission of campylo-
bacteriosis to humans [22]. Furthermore, GBHs were
also found to be capable of inducing multiple-antibiotic
resistance phenotype in potential pathogens [25]. There-
fore, GBHs may have the potential to modify the animal
and human microbiota, which, in turn, could influence
human health. However, up to date, no direct evidence
has been reported to suggest any interplay between
GBHs exposure and the microbiome in humans, espe-
cially during early development or in animal models ex-
posed to GBH with low dosage relevant to humans. As
denoted in the Developmental Origins of Health and
Disease (DOHaD) paradigm [26], early environmental
exposures are important to human health. In particular,
the prenatal and neonatal period represent a narrow but

Page 2 of 12
 critical window of susceptibility to myriad environmental
exposures and conditions with potentially lifelong im-
pacts on health and disease. A number of human and
animal studies [27–29] associate several diseases with
early-life imbalances of the gut microbiota, but it was re-
cently pointed out the need for further evidence that
GBHs, in particular at environmentally relevant doses,
can result in disturbances in the gut microbiome of hu-
man and animal populations with negative health impli-
cations [30]. Furthermore, exploring the effects of GBHs
on the microbiota from early-life until adulthood in
different windows of susceptibility, may give a more
accurate portrayal of the microbial conditions that are
involved in pathogenesis. Possible alterations of the
mammalian gut microbiota and its metabolites by envir-
onmental concentrations of GBHs in early development,
starting from in utero, have never been explored in a
controlled laboratory animal study. The present pilot
study examines whether exposure to GBHs at doses of
glyphosate considered to be “safe”, the US ADI of 1.
75 mg/kg bw/day, defined as the chronic Reference Dose
(cRfD) determined by the US EPA [31], affect the
composition and diversity of the gut microbiome at early
developmental stages in Sprague-Dawley rats.
Methods
Experimental model
The entire animal experiment was performed following
the rules by the Italian law regulating the use and treat-
ment of animals for scientific purposes (Legislative
Decree No. 26, 2014. Implementation of the directive n.
2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for sci-
entific purposes. - G.U. General Series, n. 61 of March
14th 2014). All animal study procedures were per-
formed at the Cesare Maltoni Cancer Research Centre/
Ramazzini Institute (CMCRC/RI) (Bentivoglio, Italy).
The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Com-
mittee of Ramazzini Institute. The protocol of the ex-
periment was also approved and formally authorized by
the ad hoc commission of the Italian Ministry of Health
(ministerial approval n. 710/2015-PR). The CMCRC/RI
animal
breeding
facility
was
the
supplier
for
the
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Female breeders SD rats
were
placed
individually
in
Polycarbonate
cage
(42x26x18cm; Tecniplast Buguggiate, Varese, Italy) with
a single unrelated male until evidence of copulation
was observed. After mating, matched females were
housed separately during gestation and delivery. New-
borns were housed with their mothers until weaning.
Weaned offspring were co-housed, by sex and treat-
ment group, not more than 3 per each cage. Cages were
identified by a card indicating: study protocol code, ex-
perimental and pedigree numbers, dosage group. A
shallow layer of white fir wood shavings served as
bedding (supplier: Giuseppe Bordignon, Treviso, Italy).
Analysis of chemical characteristics (pH, ashes, dry
weight, specific weight) and possible contamination
(metals,
aflatoxin,
polychlorobiphenyls,
organophos-
phorus and organochlorine pesticides) of the bedding
was performed by CONSULAB Laboratories (Treviso,
Italy). The cages were placed on racks, inside a single
room prepared for the experiment at 22 °C ± 3 °C
temperature
and
50 ± 20%
relative
humidity.
Daily
checks on temperature and humidity were performed.
The light was artificial and a light/dark cycle of 12 h
was maintained. Husbandry factors stress-related were
controlled: rats were kept together (same room, same
rack, no more than 3 per cage) and we did not relocate
cages. Noise and handling time were minimized [32].
Experimental protocol
Two groups of SD rat dams and relative pups were
treated with either glyphosate or Roundup diluted in
drinking water at the glyphosate concentration of 1.
75 mg/kg bw/day. There were in total 24 F0 dams, entire
litter at postnatal day (PND) 7 and PND 14, 108 F1 off-
spring at PND 31 and PND 57 and 60 F1 at PND 125 in
this study. The F0 female breeders received the treat-
ment through drinking water from gestation day (GD) 6
to the end of lactation. During pregnancy and lactation,
embryos and offspring (F1) were all retained in the litter
and might receive the test compounds mainly through
their dams (F0). After weaning on PND 28 offspring
were randomly distributed in two cohorts: animals be-
longing to the 6-week cohort were sacrificed at PND 73
± 2, i.e. 6 weeks after weaning, animals belonging to the
13-week cohort were sacrificed at PND 125 ± 2, i.e.
13 weeks after weaning. The F1 offspring might receive
the treatment from their dams starting from in utero
and mainly through milk during lactation. After wean-
ing, the offspring (F1) were treated through drinking
water until sacrifice.
The timeline of the experimental animal treatment
and fecal sample collection is shown in Fig. 1. As illus-
trated, rat fecal samples were individually collected from
all animals of the F0 generation (8 dams) from each
group before mating, at GD 5 (before the starting of the
treatment), GD 13, lactation day (LD) 7 and LD 14.
Fecal samples were also collected from 108 F1 pups, 18
males and 18 females from each group during lactation
at PND 7 and PND 14 (corresponding to LD 7 and 14
for dams), before the achievement of puberty at PND 31,
after puberty at PND 57 and in adulthood at PND 125.
Due to technical difficulty to identify fecal samples from
individual pups during lactation, only pooled samples at
PND 7 and PND 14 were collected for each cage from
the whole litter, not distinguished by gender. After wean-
ing, fecal samples from each pup were individually

 collected. About 2–3 droppings, collected directly from
the anus of each animal, were preserved in cryovials on
an ice bed then stored at − 20 °C until shipment on dry
ice to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. For-
ceps used for collecting droppings were washed and
cleaned using sterile water and 1% sodium bicarbonate
between each sampling to avoid cross contamination.
Bacterial 16S PCR and sequencing
Rat fecal DNA was extracted using the QIAamp PowerFe-
cal DNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Total DNA concentration was
determined by Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life technologies,
Norwalk, CT). The phylogenetically informative V3–V4
region of 16S rRNA gene was amplified using universal
primer 347F/803R [33, 34] with dual-barcoding approach
previously described [35]. The integrity of the 16S PCR
amplicons was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The
resulting ~ 460-bp sized amplicons were pooled and then
sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq 2 × 250 paired-end se-
quencing platform at OCS genome technology center of
New York University Langone Medical Center.
16S data analysis
The sequencing data were merged and filtered to
remove the merged reads with a length of < 400 bp or
the quality score of < Q30 at more than 1% of bases.
Sequentially, all filtered high quality reads were split by
dual-barcode and trimmed of primer regions using a
self-defined bash script to integrate several sequencing
processing commands from fastx [36], QIIME [37, 38],
and seqtk [39]. Duplicated measurements of four sample
were processed and sequenced using different barcodes
to test the sequencing reproducibility. Five blank sam-
ples were also sequenced and referenced to filter the
possible environmental contamination during the sample
procession. The split high-quality reads were further
processed by QIIME 1.9.0 [37]. We used the command
pick_open_reference_otus.py with the defaulted green_
gene 97_otus reference sequences to cluster of > 97%
similar sequencing reads as an OTU using uclust [40].
Representative sequences for each OTU were aligned
using PyNAST and build the phylogenetic tree. Finally,
the QIIME generated biom-formatted OTU table con-
tains the taxonomic information and absolute counts for
each identified taxon in each sample.
The diversity within each microbial community, so-
called alpha-diversity, was calculated using the Shannon
Index [41] as metric and represented the measure of the
diversity at the family and genus level. The overall micro-
biome dissimilarities among all samples were accessed
using the weighted UniFrac distance matrices [42]. Non-
metric multiple dimensional scaling (NMDS) were used to
visualize the dissimilarities. The permutational multivari-
ate analysis of variance PERMANOVA test [43], with the
maximum number of permutations = 999, was performed
to assess the significance of the overall microbiome differ-
ences between groups by collection timepoints and treat-
ment. The PERMANOVA procedure using the [Adonis]
function of the R package vegan 2.0–5 [44] partitions the
distance matrix among sources of variation, fits linear
models to distance matrices and uses a permutation test
with pseudo-F ratios to obtain the p values. Using the
LEfSe method [45], we further selected the microbiome
features significantly associated to time of collection and
treatments at various taxonomic ranks.
Results
No unexpected clinical signs or symptoms were ob-
served in the experimental animals during the in vivo

 phase. In particular, no sign of changes in maternal be-
havior during lactation (nesting and nursing) were ob-
served during the experiment. There was no clinical
evidence of alterations in activity or behavior in pups.
Body weight, water and feed consumption both in dams
and pups were no different across the groups. Litter
sizes were fully comparable among groups, with mean
number of live pups: control group 13.6 (range 10–16);
glyphosate group 13.3 (range 11–17); Roundup group
13.9 (range 11–16).
We extract the total DNAs from 433 SD rat fecal sam-
ples. Following the timeline illustrated in Figs. 1, 120
fecal samples were collected from 24 F0 dams in three
treatment groups and at five time points (before mating,
GD5, GD13, LD7 and LD14). From F1 pups, we col-
lected 313 fecal samples, in which 13 at PND 7, 24 at
PND 14, 108 each at PND 31 and PND 57, and 60 at
PND 125. We observed that the fecal samples of pups at
PND 7 and PND 14 showed significant low DNA yields
(Additional file 1: Figure S1A). We further performed
microbiome survey on 433 SD rat fecal samples, and 5
water blanks using bacterial 16S sequencing on Illumina
MiSeq 2 × 250 pair-end platform. After merging and
filtering by read length > 400 bp and the quality score >
Q30 at more than 99% of bases, we obtained ~ 2 million
high quality reads (the average number of reads = 4576
per sample with standard deviation = 6567). The number
of reads were not significant different by exposure type
(Additional file 1: Figure S1A). The taxa composition
was grouped by age and the exposure types and summa-
rized in Additional file 1: Figure S1B. We also provided
the complete taxonomic OTU tables in Additional file 2.
The overall microbiome dissimilarity, defined by beta-
diversity,
was
visualized
by
non-parametric
multi-
dimensional scaling (NMDS) plot of all samples (Fig. 2a)
, dams only (Fig. 2b) and pups only (Fig. 2c). We found
that the early postnatal samples at PND 7 and PND 14
were far apart from the dams at LD 7 and LD 14 while
the later postnatal samples at PND 31, PND 57 and
PND 125 were clustering with the dams (Fig. 2a). The
mean and variance of the within-community diversity
(α diversity) measured by Shannon index showed that
the samples from dams possessed higher, while early
postnatal samples from pups showed lower α diversity
(Fig. 2d). Student t-test showed significantly increased
α diversity from PND 14 to PND 31 (p-value< 0.05 for
all treatment groups) but no differences between sam-
ples at same age but different treatment group.
We compared the overall microbiome changes by
treatment at different age groups from pups and dams.
Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots visu-
alized the overall microbiome dissimilarities by treat-
ment at PND 31 and 57 (Fig. 3a). The PERMANOVA
test was used at each age group to test the significance
of the differences at overall rat gut microbiome between
treatment and control. The test results (p-values shown
in Fig. 3b) showed that the overall microbiome was sig-
nificantly altered by both Roundup and glyphosate treat-
ment compared to controls. Similarly, we also found
significant differences in microbiota between Roundup
and glyphosate exposed F1 pups. We also observed that
the overall microbiome was significantly different by sex
at PND 125 (p-value = 0.028, 0.007 and 0.013 by PER-
MANOVA test for Glyphosate, Roundup and control
group, respectively). To adjust for the sex effect, we per-
formed additional multivariable PERMANOVA test with
both treatment and sex as predictive variables. We found
that those test results were consistent (Fig. 3b). However,
none of the F0 dam groups showed significant differ-
ences in overall microbiota diversity..
The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) ana-
lysis was performed using 16S sequencing data from rat
fecal samples in order to select particular discriminative
features of the glyphosate exposure. Consistently with the
overall microbiome changes by exposure at different age
groups (Fig. 3), we found several significant differential
taxa features associated with exposure. In particular, at
PND 31, the results showed that the microbiota of both
glyphosate and Roundup exposed pups had significantly
higher prevalence of
Prevotella genus
(Bacteroidetes
phylum)
and
Mucispirillum
genus
(Deferribacteres
phylum) and lower prevalence of Lactobacillus genus (Fir-
micutes phylum) and Aggregatibacter genus (Proteobac-
teria phylum) (Fig. 4a 1–2). However, some of the selected
features were treatment specific. For instance, among the
most significant features with LDA score > 3.0 and p-
value< 0.05, we found increased Blautia genus (Firmicutes
phylum) and decreased Streptococcus genus (Firmicutes
phylum) and Rothia genus (Actinobacteria phylum) only
in glyphosate exposed PND 31 pups, but not in Roundup
exposed samples. In contrast, increased Parabacteroides
genus (Bacteroidetes phylum) and Veillonella genus (Fir-
micutes phylum) were only found in Roundup exposed
pups, but not in glyphosate exposed samples at PND 31.
Between two exposures (Fig. 4a 3), Roundup exposed pups
showed increased Clostridia class (Firmicutes phylum), in
particular, Blautia genus and Actinobacteria class (Actino-
bacteria phylum), in particular, Rothia and Bifidobacter-
ium genera at PND 31. Furthermore, we found the
treatment associated taxa features were not consistent at
different postnatal time points. Many features selected at
PND 31 did not appeared at PND 57 (Fig. 4a 4–6,
Additional file 3: Figure S2), suggesting the less stability of
early-life microbiota and continuous effect on gut micro-
biota by the exposure. When counting the total abun-
dance % of the significant differential taxa by treatments,
the pups showed much higher impact by exposure than
the dams (Fig. 4b).

 Discussion
GBHs
are
the
most
applied
herbicides
worldwide;
humans are commonly exposed to these environmental
chemicals at a wide range of doses depending upon the
job setting (farming vs. food consumption) and route of
exposure (ingestion vs. inhalation). Environmental con-
tamination from GBHs is now ubiquitous and residues
of glyphosate has been found in air [46], groundwater
[47], drinking-water [48], crops [49], food [50] and ani-
mal feed [51]. The possible effects of GBHs on human
health are the subject of an intense public debate, for
both its potential carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic ef-
fects, including endocrine disruption [52, 53], neurotox-
icity [54], developmental and reproductive toxicity [55],
autoimmunity [56], gastrointestinal disorders [57], obes-
ity,
diabetes
[58–60],
and
other
metabolic
and
cardiovascular disorders [61] and central nervous system
dysfunctions such as learning and memory impairment,
anxiety, stress, depression [62] and autism [63]. These
chronic
pathologies
(non-communicable
diseases
–
NCDs) may occur even at doses that are much lower
than the ones considered during risk assessment, in par-
ticular during sensitive periods of life (such as fetal de-
velopment) [7, 22].
Recent advances in human microbiome research sug-
gested that the gut microbiome is a key player in human
metabolism [64–66]. It is thus reasonable to hypothesize
that exposure to environmental chemicals may modify
the gut microbiome and its metabolites and ultimately
influence human health. Microbiota-generated metabo-
lites and their cellular and molecular components are in-
creasingly being recognized as an essential part of

 human physiology, with profound effects on the homeo-
stasis of the host organism. Unfortunately, determining
the concentrations of these biologically active substances
in target cells presents serious difficulties related to the
extraction and processing of samples, especially faecal
material, and the limitations of currently available meas-
urement techniques [15]. Meta-omics and evolving com-
putational
frameworks
will
hopefully
lead
to
the
systematic prediction and discovery of more microbial
metabolites and components involved in neuroendo-
crine, immune, metabolic, and epigenetic pathways.
Rats are proposed to be more representative of the hu-
man gut microbiota than mice because the gut bacterial
communities of humanized rats more closely reflect the
gut microbiota of human donors [67, 68]. We have previ-
ously used our animal model, SD rats, to study the effect
of postnatal low-dose exposure to environmental chemi-
cals on windows of susceptibility and on the gut micro-
biome. The study [69] showed the low-level phthalate,
paraben and triclosan exposure altered the gut micro-
biome of adolescent rats. These results are consistent with
other studies, indicating our animal model as a suitable
model for studying microbiome [70, 71].
Since glyphosate has shown enzyme inhibition activity
in plants and microorganisms, we therefore postulate
that low-dose exposure to glyphosate or GBHs may also
modulate the composition of the gut microbiome. In this
study, when compared to the adult rat dams, the gut
microbiome of pups at PND 7 and 14 showed lower
taxonomical richness but higher variance within sample
and higher sample-to-sample dissimilarity [69]. One pit-
fall of our study was that direct measurements of expos-
ure to GBHs in milk was not performed [72]. In our
pilot study we simply reproduced the human exposure,
which includes lactation as only source of nourishment
for pups from birth until around PND 21. The short-
comings concerning the analysis of glyphosate in breast
milk are mainly related to the difficulty and stressing
technical procedure for collecting milk from dams and
to the complex nature of the breast milk matrix. Indeed,
milk is an aqueous mixture of carbohydrates, proteins
and fat. Analytical methods developed for watery matri-
ces cannot be directly transferred to breast milk. In April
2014, a non-peer-reviewed report was published, in
which glyphosate in breast milk of American mothers
was detected in 3 out of 10 samples ranging from 76 to
166 ng/mL. In this study, the concentration of glypho-
sate in milk samples was determined by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [73]. The limit of quanti-
fication (LOQ) of the assay was given as 75 μg/L in milk.

 chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/
MS) methods, have found no evidence of transfer of gly-
phosate into milk. Both methods have been fully vali-
dated and reported as suitable for the determination of
glyphosate with an LOQ of 1 ng/mL [72, 74]. Neverthe-
less, future independent research is needed, considering
different educational and ethnic backgrounds, location
of residence (e.g., urban compared with rural), occupa-
tional and dietary glyphosate exposure and adequate
sample size of the cohort.
Our results revealed that both glyphosate and glypho-
sate formulated Roundup, at doses admitted in humans,
including children and pregnant women, significantly al-
tered the microbiota diversity and resulted in prominent
changes at multiple taxon in exposed pups. However,
those effects on microbiota were not significant in the
adult dams. Previous evidence has shown that the gut
microbiota at postnatal age is less stable than at adult
age and it changes over the first several years of life [75].
The maturation of the gut microbiota has been proven
to be affected by multiple factors, for instance, diet,
medications, host genetics, etc. [76]. Disruption of the
microbiota during its maturation by low doses of various
environmental chemicals has been showed to alter host
phenotypes, such as weight, metabolism and other dis-
ease risk [77]. Our data suggests that the prepubertal
age microbiota is more sensitive to GBH exposure com-
pared to the adult microbiota, therefore the postnatal
age is likely a “window of susceptibility” for GBHs to
modulate the gut microbiome.
Furthermore, our results showed that the overall
microbiome diversity and composition were significantly

 different between Roundup and glyphosate, suggesting
possible synergistic effects of the mixed formulation on
gut microbiota. As most of GBHs contains multiple sur-
factants and adjuvants might act differently than glypho-
sate alone, it is not only important to understand the
individual effects of glyphosate, but also the synergistic
impact of mixed formulations. In fact adjuvants might
act alone or in a synergistic manner and increase the
toxic effects of glyphosate [78–81].
In addition, both clinical and experimental studies
showed impact of gut microbiota on the gut-brain axis
(which mainly includes the immune, neuroendocrine,
and neural pathways) [82–84] in an age-dependent man-
ner [85]. Gut bacteria communicating with the host
through the microbiota-gut-brain axis could influence
brain and behavior [86]. In particular, the changes at
postnatal microbiota may affect the neurvous system,
reflecting by changes in levels of pituitary hormones in-
cluding ACTH [83, 87], cortisol, BNDF [88] and etc.
Sprague-Dawley
rats
represent
an
excellent
animal
model to explore these early-life effects as their micro-
biome is more similar to that of humans than the micro-
biota profile of mice [67].
This study has some limitations. First, the actual levels
of GBHs that reached the fetus during gestation or
through milk consumption postnatally by the offspring
cannot be accurately estimated. Second, we only col-
lected maternal feces so that we cannot fully evaluate
the role of maternal microbiota in the fetal development
without the maternal sample/data collection from oral,
vaginal and other body sites. Indeed, in recent years it is
becoming apparent that, besides breast milk, other
sources could allow maternal-offspring microbial trans-
fer. Rodents “inherit” their microbiomes in a similar
fashion to all placental mammals, including humans:
through vaginal delivery and close maternal association
throughout the neonatal period (vertical transmission).
Maternal vaginal, skin, mammary fecal and oral micro-
biomes, microbial spreading in bedding are efficiently
transmitted to offspring and represent other possible
mechanisms of maternal influences on pups intestinal
colonization [89]. Finally, the microbiome survey used a
cost-effective 16S amplicon targeted sequencing ap-
proach. This technique allows us to identify differential
taxa compositions by exposure only to genus level. Add-
itional meta-genomics and meta-transcriptomic analysis
may need to visualize the functional and metabolic alter-
nations and identify bacterial features at species/strain
level. In addition, given the differences in taxonomic
composition of the microbiomes of rats and humans,
the extent to which the results of this analysis can be
relevant to humans is not clear. Future work should in-
vestigate how the route and concentration of exposure
impact the rat microbiome, and quantify how these
perturbations may impact subsequent health outcomes.
Nevertheless, these data strongly indicate that GBHs ex-
posure can exerts biological effects early in development
which may have long-lasting health effects later in life.
Conclusion
Our pilot study provides initial evidence that maternal ex-
posure to commonly used GBHs, at doses currently con-
sidered as acceptable in humans, is capable of modifying
the gut microbiota in rat pups, in particular before puberty
(PND 31). Further long-term investigations are necessary
to elucidate if the shift in the microbiota induced by GBHs
exposure is contributing to the downstream other health
effects.
Nevertheless,
understanding
the
microbiota
changes during this critical window of susceptibility could
be of great importance for disease prevention. The poten-
tial health effects of GBHs during development, such as
childhood, warrant further investigation.
