Understanding virus assembly mechanisms is important for developing therapeutic inter-
ventions. Nipah virus (NiV) is of interest because of its high mortality rate and efficient
human–human transmissions. The current model for most enveloped viruses suggests that
matrix proteins (M) recruit attachment glycoproteins (G) and fusion glycoproteins (F) to the
assembly site at the plasma membrane. Here we report an assembly model that differs in
many aspects from the current one. Examining NiV proteins on the cell plasma membrane
using super-resolution microscopy reveals that clusters of F and G are randomly distributed
on the plasma membrane regardless of the presence or absence of M. Our data suggests a
model in which the M molecules assemble at the plasma membrane to form virus-like
particles (VLPs), while the incorporation of F and G into the nascent VLPs is stochastic.

any virus families, such as the togaviruses, the rhab-
doviruses, the para- and orthomyxoviruses, and the
retroviruses, undergo assembly at the plasma mem-
brane1. For example, extensive electron microscopic and western
blot analyses have been carried out for the paramyxoviruses and
suggest that the matrix proteins recruit the nucleocapsid and
glycoproteins to the assembly sites2–8. However, neither electron
microscopic studies nor western blot analyses are done on intact
cells9. Recent breakthroughs in optical super-resolution micro-
scopy have improved the resolution from about 200 nm to as low
as 10 nm10–12, so it is now possible to visualize the organization
of the viral proteins at the plasma membrane. An important
question in the assembly of enveloped viruses is how the key
components for producing a virion are organized and assembled
on the plasma membrane.
Nipah virus (NiV) is a member of the Paramyxoviridae
family13. It is an emerging zoonotic virus that causes severe
diseases in both animals and humans14. Recent NiV outbreaks in
southeast Asia have a 40–90% mortality rate14. NiV infection can
cause fatal encephalitis with a pathological hallmark of endo-
thelial cell–cell fusion13. It has been proposed that the NiV matrix
proteins (M) recruit the attachment glycoproteins (G) and fusion
glycoproteins (F) to the assembly sites either by direct interac-
tions7 or by co-targeting the same domain at the plasma
membrane15,16.
Here we report a new model for NiV assembly using single-
molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). Our images show that
small clusters of F and G are randomly distributed on the plasma
membrane regardless of the presence or absence of M. The
assembly process of NiV virus-like particles (VLPs) is not asso-
ciated with higher concentrations of F or G co-localizing with the
clusters of M. Our data suggests a model in which the M mole-
cules assemble at the plasma membrane to form VLPs while the
incorporation of F and G into the nascent VLPs is stochastic. This
model predicts that the amount of F and G on the VLPs can be
manipulated by controlling the expression levels of F and G in the
host cell. We have analyzed 10,000 VLPs expressing both F and G
at different times and confirmed that the amount of F and G on
VLPs increases with the expression levels of F and G rather than
requiring a fixed stoichiometry dependent on M.
Results
NiV-M clusters organize into dome-like structures. The intra-
cellular protein NiV-M underneath the plasma membrane is
thought to direct the assembly and budding process of NiV
VLPs7. It is known that the expression of M alone is sufficient for
the production of NiV VLPs4. To study the organization of M, pig
kidney fibroblast cells (PK13) expressing NiV-M with green
fluorescent protein (GFP) at the N-terminus were fixed, per-
meablized, and immunostained with Alexa Fluor 647. Three-
dimensional (3D) fluorophore localizations were carried out
using a home-built SMLM with dual focal planes which allows an
imaging depth of several microns while using the fiducial markers
on the coverslip for real-time 3D drift correction17. Forty thou-
sand images were acquired at 45 Hz to reconstruct a SMLM
image. During image acquisition, sample drift was controlled
within 1 nm (root mean square, RMS) in the lateral directions
and 3 nm in the axial direction17. The fluorophore localization
precisions were ~10 nm (standard deviation, SD) laterally and 30
nm axially17,18. Images taken through the middle of the cell
(position 1 in Fig. 1a) show distinct M puncta with a diameter of
20–40 nm inside the cell (Fig. 1b). However, images at the plasma
membrane (position 2 in Fig. 1a) reveal clusters with diameters of
a few hundred nanometers (Fig. 1c). Our findings provide in situ
evidence showing that M proteins further assemble at the plasma
membrane, which is consistent with the self-assembly model
proposed for the human metapneumovirus M in the presence of
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine in solution19.
We observed that some M clusters were organized into dome-
like structures at the plasma membrane. An example is shown in
the boxed region in Fig. 1d on the dorsal surface of the cell
(position 3 in Fig. 1a). These dome-like structures could not be
observed at the ventral surface of the cell in contact with the

 coverslip. The z-stacks of the dome-like structure are shown in
Fig. 1e, and the 3D surface reconstructed by using the M
localizations is shown in Fig. 1f. The organization of M on these
dome-like structures was fragmented, not continuous. This is in
agreement with the recent cryo-electron microscopy studies
showing fragmented M patches in the virions of Newcastle
Disease Virus20.
NiV glycoproteins form clusters on the plasma membrane. To
investigate the organization of the viral envelope glycoproteins on
the plasma membrane, we used FLAG-tagged F21 and hemag-
glutinin (HA)-tagged G22 constructs (Supplementary Fig. 1).
PK13 cells expressing either F or G were fixed at 24 h post
transfection, immunostained for F or G via tags, and imaged at
the dorsal surface of the cell without permeabilization (position 3
in Fig. 1a). F formed distinct clusters (Fig. 2a) compared to the
more dispersed clusters formed by G (Fig. 2b). Since both F and
G were abundant on the plasma membrane, the localizations
delineated the entire plasma membrane (Fig. 2a, b). The observed
membrane structures resembled those imaged by scanning elec-
tron microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 2). Both F (Fig. 2a) and G
(Fig. 2b) were detected on the cell body and membrane protru-
sions, which are shown as tubular structures with a relatively
uniform diameter of ~200 nm. To determine whether the locali-
zation densities of F or G were different between the cell body and
membrane protrusions, we sampled a total of ~20 areas from each
type of region and compared their localization densities. To
account for the cell-to-cell variation in the expression levels of F
and G, the localization densities on the protrusions were nor-
malized against the average density of the cell body. We found
that the localization densities of F or G on membrane protrusions
were not statistically different from those on the cell body
(Fig. 2c). A similar conclusion was obtained for cells fixed at 16 h
post transfection (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Therefore, our data
show that the distribution of the viral envelope glycoproteins is
generally uniform over the plasma membrane.
F generally exhibited a greater Hopkins’ index than G (Fig. 2d),
suggesting more extensive clustering of F than G at the plasma
membrane23. This observation is similar to the recent SMLM
study on HIV Env and Influenza hemagglutinin, both of which
demonstrate clustering behavior at the plasma membrane24,25.
Similar distribution patterns of the envelope glycoproteins were
obtained on the plasma membrane of PK13 cells at a shorter
expression period (16 h). This suggests that the distribution and
arrangement of F and G are not significantly dependent on the
cell surface expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 3).
To determine the co-localization of F and G, we acquired dual-
color SMLM images of F and G at the plasma membrane
(Fig. 2e). A numerical co-localization analysis was carried out
using the coordinate-based co-localization algorithm previously
developed by Malkusch et al26. The degree of co-localization
(DoC) is calculated for every single-molecule localization and has
a value from −1 for segregation, through 0 for random
distributions, to 1 for a high probability of correlated co-
localization26–28. A random distribution indicates that the co-
localization of two molecules is a random event rather than
regulated by a specific mechanism. In this algorithm, the DoC
value is dependent on the maxima radius (Rmax) used for the DoC
analysis26,27. A Rmax of 100 nm was used in this study to reflect
the size of a typical VLP. The effect of the selected Rmax on the
DoC values is demonstrated in the Supplementary Fig. 4. The
analysis indicates that F and G are mostly localized in segregated
clusters as the DoC values show a maximum in the negative range
(Fig. 2f). The analysis partially explain that the association of the
glycoproteins observed by co-immunoprecipitation assays can be
due to random events22,29,30. Furthermore, we found that the
coexistence of these two NiV envelope glycoproteins did not
affect each other’s clustering behavior (Fig. 2e): F formed distinct
clusters and G formed more dispersed clusters. PK13 cells are
non-permissive for NiV entry because they lack the NiV receptors
ephrinB2/B313. Nonetheless, similar behaviors were also observed
on NiV permissive HeLa cells, which expressed the ephrinB2/B3
receptors13 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Therefore, the organization of
F and G is independent of the presence of the receptors.
NiV-M does not alter the distribution of glycoproteins. To
investigate whether M actively recruits F and G at the plasma
membrane, three-color images were collected for cells simulta-
neously expressing M, F, and G. Both F and G were imaged using
SMLM, while diffraction-limited images of M-GFP were used to
identify regions with large M clusters. Figure 3a shows the F (red),
G (green), and M (blue) clusters at the plasma membrane of the
cell body (position 3, Fig. 1a). At a higher z position above the cell
body, the membrane protrusions could be seen (Fig. 3b). We
observed that the clusters of F and G were situated on dome-
like structures (1 and 2 in Fig. 3b, c) in the M-positive regions.
The shape of the dome-like structures recapitulated those formed
by M localizations when expressed alone in the cell (Fig. 1e, f).
Figure 3d shows the 3D reconstructed surface using the locali-
zations of F and G in region 1 of Fig. 3b. These dome-like
structures of G and F could not be observed when M was absent
(Fig. 2a, b). Therefore, it is plausible that these dome-like struc-
tures formed by M are the assembly sites of the VLPs.
Interestingly, the localization densities of F and G at the M-
positive regions were not statistically different from those at the
M-negative regions (Fig. 3e). Additionally, the Hopkins’
indices (Fig. 3f) and DoC values (Fig. 3g) of F and G were
comparable
in
the
M-positive
and
M-negative
regions.
Furthermore,
dual-color
SMLM
images
indicate
non-
correlated distributions among M, F, and G with negative
averaged DoC values (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 6). These
observations disagree with the commonly believed model that
the viral envelope glycoproteins coalesce to the matrix protein
for the assembly of the nascent virions7,8,31,32. Previous studies
using western blot analysis suggest that F may facilitate G to
incorporate into VLPs7. Nonetheless, we did not observe a
significant difference on the DoC values between M and G with
or without the presence of F (Supplementary Fig. 6c, d and e).
Figure 3h shows the z-stacks of a representative VLP, marked
by the GFP signal from M (blue). We found that the spatial
organization and distribution of F and G on the VLP
membrane were similar to that of the host cell’s plasma
membrane (Fig. 2e and 3a–c). This observation indicates that
the clusters of the envelope glycoproteins on the plasma
membrane have not been considerably rearranged when
incorporated into the VLPs. All together, these findings suggest
an alternative assembly model for NiV, in which no active
recruitment of the envelope glycoproteins to M is involved.
Instead, the incorporation of the envelope glycoproteins occurs
stochastically upon the envelopment of the M assemblies at the
host cell’s plasma membrane.
Incorporation of the glycoproteins into VLPs is stochastic. If
the incorporation of the envelope glycoproteins into VLPs occurs
stochastically, the model predicts that the amounts of the envel-
ope glycoproteins in VLPs should correlate with their expression
levels on the host cell membrane rather than showing a fixed
stoichiometry of G/M or F/M. To test this model, we collected
images of ~10,000 VLPs at 18 and 45 h post transfection of the
viral envelope glycoproteins and analyzed the intensity of M, F,

 and G on VLPs. Fig. 4a, b shows the intensity distributions of F
and G in the VLPs, respectively. Both F and G showed sig-
nificantly higher intensity at 45 h than those at 18 h post trans-
fection, which was consistent with the cell surface expression
levels of F and G on the host cells measured by flow cytometry
(Fig. 4e). Moreover, the VLPs collected at 45 h post transfection
also showed higher intensity ratios for both G/M and F/M. This
observation indicates the stoichiometries of G/M and F/M in the
NiV VLPs vary with the expression level on the host cells (Fig. 4c,
d). These results confirm that the incorporation levels of the
envelope glycoproteins are highly dependent on their expression
levels at the host cell membrane and may not be regulated by M.
Discussion
Our images suggest that the co-localization of the F and G
clusters is random. Since NiV-induced membrane fusion requires
F and G to act in concert22, our finding indicates that a specific
spatial organization of F and G may not be needed to trigger
membrane fusion. Although previous analyses using the co-
immunoprecipitation assay29,30 and flow cytometry-based pro-
tein interaction assay21 have detected interactions between F and
G proteins, these methods do not provide information on whe-
ther these interactions are non-random or even occur in intact
cells.
Since NiV is a biosafety level-4 agent, most models of the NiV
life cycle have been proposed using plasmid transfection-based
methods33. Whether these models can be applied to the real virus
remains an open question. Nonetheless, our studies reveal a virus
assembly model previously unrecognized by electron microscopy
and biochemical analyses. Our findings suggest that the assembly
process of some enveloped viruses could be much simpler than
previously envisioned.

 AY816745.1)29. NiV-M-GFP was generated by fusing enhanced GFP sequence in
frame to the N-terminus of a codon-optimized NiV-M construct (genbank acces-
sion no. EU480491.1). The VLP assembly and budding ability of this NiV-M-GFP
construct is comparable to the untagged NiV-M35. A FLAG tag was inserted after
residue 104 of the codon-optimized NiV-F (genbank accession no. AY816748.1).
The FLAG-tagged F construct is functional in a cell–cell fusion assay shown in
Supplementary Fig. 1 and by Stone et al.21. All constructs were cloned into the
pcDNA 3.1+ (Invitrogen, V79020) expression plasmid. PK13 or HeLa cells were
seeded on coverslips (18 mm, 1.5 H, Marienfeld) coated with 2.5 μg per well
fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 12-well plate, and transfected with 1 μg of plasmids
per well using Turbofect (Thermofisher Scientific) on the next day.
Antibodies and immunofluorescence. At 16 or 24 h post transfection, cells were
fixed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)
and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 90 min (Electron Microscopy Sciences)36. Plasma
membranes were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for the
detection of the GFP-tagged NiV-M in SMLM. Cells were incubated in signal
enhancer Image-IT-Fx (Life Technologies) for 45 min, and then blocked using
BlockAid (Life Technologies) blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The
HA.11 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Biolegend, 902301) was used at a 1:900 dilution to
detect the HA-tagged NiV-G and the M2 mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich, F1804) was used at a 1:200 dilution to detect the FLAG-tagged NiV-
F. NiV-M was detected either by imaging GFP fluorescence or by using a goat anti-
GFP antibody at a 1:600 dilution (abcam, ab5450) followed by a secondary antibody.
Alexa Fluor 647- (Life Technologies, A21235, A21447, A21244, and A31571) and
Cy3B (GE Healthcare, PA63101)-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:300
and 1:100 dilutions, respectively. The Cy3B-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, 111-005-008, 711-055-152, and 705-005-147) were manufactured
by Ablab (Vancouver, Canada). Cells were incubated with primary antibodies over-
night at 4 °C, and then with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Each
antibody binding step was followed by five washes with PBS. Cells were then fixed in
PBS containing 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature.
SMLM setup. Imaging was performed using a home-built microscope with a sample
stabilization system. The details of the microscope has been published previously18.
Briefly, four lasers were used in the excitation path: a 639 nm laser (Genesis MX639,
Coherent) for exciting the Alexa Fluor 647; a 532 nm laser (Opus, Laser quantum) for
exciting the photo-switchable Cy3B; a 488 nm laser (DHOM-100B, Fine Mechanics)
for exciting GFP; and a 405 nm laser (LRD 0405, Laserglow Technologies) for reac-
tivating the Alexa Fluor 647 and Cy3B. All four lasers were coupled into an inverted
microscope equipped with an apochromatic TIRF oil-immersion objective lens (60×;
numerical aperture 1.49; Nikon). The emission fluorescence was separated using
appropriate dichroic mirrors and filters (Semrock)17, and detected by electron mul-
tiplying charge-coupled device cameras (Ixon, Andor). A feedback loop was employed
to lock the position of the sample during image acquisition. Sample drift was con-
trolled to be <1 nm laterally and 2.5 nm axially.
SMLM image acquisition and reconstruction. Fluorescent beads (F8799, Ther-
moFisher Scientific) were added to the sample as fiducial markers. Samples were
immersed in oxygen-savaging buffer supplemented with 50 mM mercaptoethyla-
mine or 140 mM β-mercaptoethanol during imaging acquisition37. The expression
level of the protein of interest in individual cells was determined by measuring the
average emission fluorescence intensity of an area of 27 × 27 μm2. Cells with an
emission fluorescence intensity of threefold or greater than that of the mock-
transfected cells were selected for imaging. For SMLM imaging, cells were exposed
to a laser power density of 1 kW cm−2 for the 639 and 532 nm lasers to activate the
Alexa Fluor 647 and Cy3B, respectively. In all, 40 000 images were acquired at
45 Hz to reconstruct each SMLM image. For dual-color SMLM, image acquisition
at each channel was performed sequentially. Overlapping of these two colors were
carried out using ~40,000 images of fluorescent beads recorded at various positions
of these two cameras to find an optimal geometric transformation. The resulting
color-overlapping error is ~10 nm (RMS). Custom software written in MATLAB
(Mathworks) was used to reconstruct SMLM images.17
VLP production and immunofluorescence. VLP were manufactured by sequen-
tially transfecting the PK13 cells with the aforementioned NiV-M, -F, and -G
encoding plasmids using polyethylenimine (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, the NiV-M
plasmids were transfected at time 0, and F and G plasmids were transfected at 0 or
27 h post transfection of M. At 45 h post transfection of M, VLPs were collected on
a 20% sucrose cushion by centrifugation of the cell supernatant at 100 000 × g. The
VLPs were resuspended in 5% sucrose-NTE buffer38. VLPs were immobilized on
the coverslips (12 mm, Thermofisher Scientific) coated with 1.5 μg fibronectin for
2 h at room temperature, followed by 4% PFA fixation. The procedures for VLP
SMLM imaging are exactly the same as that of the cells. For confocal microscopy
imaging, VLPs were incubated with BlockAid blocking solution at room tem-
perature for 1 h. NiV-F and G proteins were stained with the primary and sec-
ondary antibodies mentioned above, and embedded in prolong diamond
antifade mountant (Thermofisher). A 3D Z-scanning protocol was performed
to image VLPs on a Zeiss III spinning disk confocal microscopy (Zeiss). The
intensities of F and G on VLPs were analyzed using custom software written in
MATLAB. The VLPs were marked by GFP signals, and the signals of F and G
were analyzed only if they co-localized with the GFP signal. The GFP-positive
cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer (FACSARIA III, BD Biosciences) and
FLOWJO v10 software.
Statistical analysis. The p values of the localization density and the Hopkins’
index data sets were determined by two-tailed, unpaired t-tests with the Welch
correction. All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 software. Dot
plots include a horizontal line representing the mean value and whiskers repre-
senting SD.

Fig. 4 The incorporation of the envelope glycoproteins is related to the cell surface expression levels, not the stoichiometry of F/M or G/M. VLPs described
in Fig. 3h were subjected to confocal microscopy imaging. The VLPs were located by the GFP signal from M; the intensities of the F and G signals co-
localized with M were analyzed. a, b Histograms of F (a) and G (b) incorporation levels in VLPs collected at 18 (gray) and 45 (red) h post transfection of F
and G. c, d Histograms of F/M (c) and G/M (d) ratios in VLPs collected at 18 (gray) and 45 (red) h post transfection of F and G. e Expression levels of F
(top) and G (bottom) in the GFP-positive and VLP-producing cells at 18 (gray) and 45 (red) h post tranfection. Cells expressing M alone were set as
control (blue dotted line). Three independent experiments were performed
