Summary
Background The risk of tuberculosis outbreaks among people fleeing hardship for refuge in Europe is heightened. 
We describe the cross-border European response to an outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among patients 
from the Horn of Africa and Sudan.
Methods On April 29 and May 30, 2016, the Swiss and German National Mycobacterial Reference Laboratories 
independently triggered an outbreak investigation after four patients were diagnosed with multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis. In this molecular epidemiological study, we prospectively defined outbreak cases with 24-locus 
mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) profiles; phenotypic 
resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and capreomycin; and corresponding drug resistance 
mutations. We whole-genome sequenced all Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates and clustered them using a threshold 
of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We collated epidemiological data from host countries from the 
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
Findings Between Feb 12, 2016, and April 19, 2017, 29 patients were diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 
in seven European countries. All originated from the Horn of Africa or Sudan, with all isolates two SNPs or fewer 
apart. 22 (76%) patients reported their travel routes, with clear spatiotemporal overlap between routes. We identified 
a further 29 MIRU-VNTR-linked cases from the Horn of Africa that predated the outbreak, but all were more than 
five SNPs from the outbreak. However all 58 isolates shared a capreomycin resistance-associated tlyA mutation.
Interpretation Our data suggest that source cases are linked to an M tuberculosis clone circulating in northern Somalia 
or Djibouti and that transmission probably occurred en route before arrival in Europe. We hypothesise that the shared 
mutation of tlyA is a drug resistance mutation and phylogenetic marker, the first of its kind in M tuberculosis sensu 
stricto.

Introduction
WHO’s 2017 global tuberculosis report1 contained the 
sobering news that the tuberculosis epidemic is larger 
than previously thought. Worse still, among an estimated 
10·4 million new cases were 600 000 patients with 
rifampicin resistance or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 
in 2016. Although the global burden of disease is unequally 
shared, population movement does lead to appearance of 
strains normally associated with one country or region in 
another country or region—a phenomenon historically 
linked to human migration, trade, and conquest.2 War, 
government oppression, and economic inequality are the 
modern day forces driving people to Europe from its 
southern borders.3 Climate change is likely to amplify 
these push factors in years to come.4 In 2015 alone, more 
than 1 000 000 people did the dangerous journey to Europe 
in search of sanctuary or a better life than before.5
A common route for refugees and migrants who make 
the journey from the Horn of Africa is through Libya 
where human traffickers detain their clients in 
overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. With a high 
prevalence of infectious diseases in their countries of 
origin, risk of transmission is heightened under these 
conditions, while access to health care is restricted. 
Ectoparasite infestations and skin and respiratory tract 
infections have all been described as common in these 
detention centres where people are kept for as long as it 
takes to pay the traffickers’ fees.3 Those able to pay

attempt the Mediterranean crossing to Italy, a journey 
associated with the highest mortality of all routes to 
Europe in 2016, with one out of 47 people dying.5
Estimated tuberculosis incidence in the Horn of Africa 
ranges from 65 cases per 100 000 population per year in 
Eritrea to 192 cases per 100 000 per year in Ethiopia, 
274 cases per 100 000 in Somalia, and 378 cases per 
100 000 per year in Djibouti; Somalia has the highest 
estimated multidrug-resistant tuberculosis incidence, 
with 29 cases per 100 000 population per year.1 These 
numbers are only approximate6 and migration is expected 
to result in a higher incidence still among the 
subpopulation making the journey to Europe.7,8 Of the 
many challenges for European authorities, early case 
finding and provision of adequate health care to this 
population are key to prevention of outbreaks.9,10 In this 
study, we describe how a European response to a cluster 
of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in patients from the 
Horn of Africa was jointly guided by rapid whole-genome 
sequencing (WGS) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, 
epidemiological investigations, and data sharing. The 
aim of the outbreak investigation was to elucidate the 
origin of the cluster, identify possible locations of 
transmission, and interrupt further transmission where 
possible.
Methods
Study design and participants
On April 29 and May 30, 2016, the Swiss and German 
National 
Mycobacterial 
Reference 
Laboratories 
independently triggered an outbreak investigation after 
four patients were diagnosed with multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis. Isolates had matching 24-locus mycob- 
acterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number 
tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) profiles and shared a rare 
pncA mutation. These patients had recently arrived from 
the Horn of Africa or Sudan. Retrospective and 
prospective data collection was initiated according to a 
case definition (inclusion criteria) based on mycobacteria 
growth indicator tube-based phenotypic resistance to 
isoniazid (≥3 mg/L), rifampicin (≥20 mg/L), ethambutol 
(2·5 mg/L to <5 mg/L), pyrazinamide (≥100 mg/L), and 
capreomycin (≥5 mg/L), with susceptibility to amikacin 
and fluoroquinolones (Loewenstein-Jensen media was 
used in France); and at least the shared MIRU-VNTR 
profile (multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed using the search terms “whole genome 
sequencing”, “tuberculosis”, and “outbreak” for articles 
published in English up to Sept 1, 2017. Previous studies 
support whole-genome sequencing (WGS) as a method to 
direct Mycobacterium tuberculosis outbreak investigations with 
unprecedented resolution. However, it remains a new tool to 
which many high-income countries are only now considering a 
transition. Although its better resolution than more 
established typing methods has been repeatedly shown, the 
effect of WGS on international epidemiological investigations 
is only now being realised. We are not aware of it being used 
before in an as wide-ranging and complex investigation as 
described in this study.
Added value of this study
This analysis has provided further evidence of how WGS can 
both enrich and build on existing mycobacterial interspersed 
repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) 
data. First, among isolates sharing an MIRU-VNTR profile, it 
was able to distinguish those related through recent 
transmission from those with a distant common ancestor. 
Second, it has provided a clear example of how WGS data can 
be hypothesis generating with regards to transmission, 
especially its timing. Third, it provides an important example 
of how samples with matching MIRU-VNTR profiles, although 
not necessarily meeting the case definition, can be selected 
for sequencing to provide a genetic context for 
epidemiological analysis. The added value of the analysis is 
identification of what could be the first phylogenetic marker 
that confers drug resistance outside of that conferring 
intrinsic pyrazinamide resistance to Mycobacterium bovis. 
Such markers are of diagnostic value, while also providing the 
basis for rapid PCR assays that screen for further clustered 
isolates, a goal that the Network of the European Union, Latin 
America and the Caribbean Countries on Joint Innovation and 
Research Activities has lent its support to. Finally, our 
experience has shown that with ever-improving access to 
WGS platforms, these data can all be shared and analysed 
with ease across national boundaries. This approach shows 
the way forward to an improved European or wider 
international, cross-border alerting system for potential 
outbreaks. Standardisation of sequence data and metadata 
will no doubt facilitate data sharing across boundaries, 
helping public health practitioners, clinicians, and 
microbiologists who might wish to adjust diagnostic 
algorithms and techniques according to the bespoke 
requirements best fitting the epidemiological background of 
the local patient population.
Implications of all the available evidence
The benefits of WGS are now widely accessible. We have shown 
proof of principle that WGS can be incorporated 
contemporaneously into an international outbreak response. 
Although our efforts were somewhat ad hoc, facilitated by 
collaboration between university-based academics, state-level 
institutions, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention 
and Control, we are now at the point where WGS is ready to be 
incorporated into national and European standard programmes 
for cross-border identification, management, and prevention 
of tuberculosis outbreak scenarios.

Investigations were done under local public health law 
in each country as part of an outbreak response. As such, 
no further ethical approval was necessary for most of the 
countries involved. For patients diagnosed in Switzerland, 
we obtained ethical approval and individual informed 
consent (Business Administration System for Ethics 
Committee ethics approval number 2016-02092). 
Procedures
The European Commission issued an Early Warning and 
Response System message to European Union member 
states after notification by the Swiss public health 
authorities of clustered cases in several European countries 
on Nov 17, 2016. Further suspected cases in Europe were 
reported to the European Centre for Disease Prevention 
and Control (ECDC) between Nov 17, 2016, and 
April 19, 2017
. All isolates had WGS in their country of 
diagnosis or at the Research Centre Borstel, Borstel, 
Germany. All countries used Illumina (San Diego, CA, 
USA) platforms, except for Sweden, which used an Ion 
Torrent platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, 
MA, USA). We mapped short reads to the M tuberculosis 
reference (National Center for Biotechnology Information 
GenBank NC_000962.3) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner 
version 0.7
.12-r1039 and refined them using the Genome 
Analysis Toolkit and SAMtools. We used custom Perl 
scripts for variant-calling, with thresholds of a four-times 
coverage in both forward and reverse orientation, 
four-times coverage with a Phred score of at least 20, and 
75% allele frequency. Variants in repetitive regions or 
genes were masked. We used only single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) for concatenated sequence 
alignments. Molecular clusters were defined for isolates 
with a minimum genome-wide distance of five SNPs to at 
least one other isolate. We prepared sequencing runs for a 
mean 20–50-times coverage, depending on the laboratory. 
We did statistical analyses in Stata (version 13.1). 
We deposited all sequences in the European Nucleotide 
Archive (accession PRJEB22358).
We investigated the molecular epidemiology following 
Strengthening the Reporting of Molecular Epidemiology 
for Infectious Diseases guidelines.12 To contextualise the 
outbreak against its genomic background, we sequenced 
additional MIRU-VNTR-matching isolates obtained from 
European countries’ collections of isolates previously 
gathered from the Horn of Africa. Each month during the 
outbreak investigation, we built maximum likelihood 
(PhyML 3.1) and parsimony (Bionumerics 6.7) phylogenies 
to inform epidemiological investigations (appendix p 2).13
We did patient interviews in each country to establish 
migration routes and symptom onset dates. We 
reassured patients that interviews were confidential 
and 
independent 
of 
immigration 
authorities. 
We 
solicited certified translators if necessary. Structured 
questionnaires were used (appendix pp 3–27) and free 
narratives were recorded within them. Although each 
country’s procedures differed, we gathered data for places 
of residence for 2 years preceding migration, route and 
means of migration, types of accommodation or detention 
centres, people they encountered en route, symptom onset, 
health-care seeking behaviour, and disease risk factors. We 
sought details of medical and treatment history from 
attending physicians in some countries. Whenever 
possible, we compared results with data from surveillance 
and screening systems. We reported results to the ECDC. 
When data were imprecise, we chose the first day of each 
month as the entry date into a new country where the 
month was given. We calculated each subsequent country 
visited in the same month as having been entered at 5-day 
intervals.
Role of the funding source
With the exception of the Swiss Federal Office of Public 
Health (PH is an employee of the Swiss Federal Office of 
Public Health), the funders of the study had no role in 
study design, data collection, data analysis, data 
interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding 
author had full access to all the data in the study and had 
final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.
Results
29 patients fitting the case definition were identified 
across Europe between Feb 12, 2016, and April 19, 2017 
(table). 14 (48%) were diagnosed in Germany, eight (28%) 
were diagnosed in Switzerland, two (7%) were each 
diagnosed in France and Austria, and one (3%) was each 
diagnosed in Sweden, Finland, and the UK. Before travel, 
the patients resided in Somalia (21 [72%] patients), Eritrea 
(three [10%]), Sudan (two [7%]), Ethiopia (two [7%]), and 
Djibouti (one [3%]); three (10%) patients were women 
and all were younger than 26 years of age (median 
18 years [IQR 16·5–19·0]) at the time of diagnosis. 
One (3%) patient was lost to follow-up, with all others 
remaining on antituberculosis treatment under the care 
of the respective countries of their diagnosis. A further 
29 patients whose isolates had related MIRU-VNTR types 
were identified after European collaborators searched 
their archives for matches; these cases all predated the 
outbreak (appendix pp 28, 29). Of these cases, 
23 (79%) were isolated from patients resident in Europe 
at the time of diagnosis and six (21%) were isolated from 
patients resident in Djibouti. All patients originated from 
the Horn of Africa.
WGS analysis identified 549 nucleotide variants and 
placed the 58 samples into sublineage 4.6.2 (Cameroon 
genotype), part of the European-American lineage.14 Any 
two of the original 29 outbreak isolates were separated by 
a maximum of two SNPs, whereas the 29 other samples 
were separated by more than five SNPs, and in 18 cases, 
by more than 100 SNPs (figure 1). These additional

isolates enabled a phylogenetic analysis of the stepwise 
evolution of drug resistance mutation characteristics for 
this cluster. Whereas resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, 
and ethambutol was ancestral to both the outbreak 
samples and all of the outlier samples from Djibouti, 
pyrazinamide resistance, which completed the original 
outbreak case definition, was acquired later. In addition 
to all of the original outbreak samples, pyrazinamide 
resistance was limited to just a single isolate from the 
Djibouti outlier samples, which was seven SNPs away 
from the main cluster (figure 1). All 58 isolates shared 
the tlyA N236K mutation and underlying resistance to 
capreomycin,15,16 but none were resistant to the 
aminoglycosides. 45 (96%) of 47 isolates tested for 
capreomycin resistance were indeed phenotypically 
resistant, including isolates that were susceptible to all 
antituberculosis drugs, suggesting that this mutation 
could be both a phylogenetic marker and a drug 
resistance mutation.
Considering molecular clock estimates for M tuberculosis 
of around 0·3–0·5 SNPs per genome per year,17–20 the 
degree of genomic homogeneity among the 29 outbreak 
isolates (figure 1) suggests recent transmission. Interviews 
therefore focused especially on establishing locations of 
likely transmission. One (3%) patient was lost to follow-up, 
and travel details for six (21%) were unavailable. Of the 
22 (76%) patients for whom data were available, all reported 
making the journey across the Mediterranean from Libya 
to Italy, and none described a plausible alternative route. 
Because patients originated from different locations within 
different countries and because of the range of countries in 
which these journeys ended, patients are most likely to 
have met en route through Sudan, Libya, or Italy.
17 (77%) patients reported transiting through Sudan, 
with a 15 day median length of stay (IQR 5–30), but few 
further details about patients’ stays in Sudan were 
available. All 22 patients for whom data were available 
recounted transiting through Libya (median 100 days 
[60–180]), where at least 12 were held by human 
traffickers for extended periods of time. Libya’s main 
bottleneck appears to have been the town of Bani Waleed, 
where the median length of stay was longer 
(53 days [30–73]) than the entire time spent in Sudan. 
12 (55%) of 22 patients either named Bani Waleed, 
180 km southeast of Tripoli and 135 km southwest of 
Misrata, as the location of their detention, or recounted a 
detention centre matching its description.3 Conditions 
were described as overcrowded and unsanitary. Several 
patients reported that they were detained with about 
300 other people in a closed hall or hangar, with a roof 
and no windows. Multiple reports emerged of physical 
abuse by the captors and widespread disease and 
coughing. Of the 12 patients likely to have stayed in Bani 
Waleed between February, 2015, and May, 2016, each 
overlapped with at least one other, and five overlapped at 
once in November, 2015 (figure 2). Six (50%) of these 
patients were eventually diagnosed in Switzerland, 
four (33%) were diagnosed in Germany, and one (8%) was 
each diagnosed in Austria and Finland. All countries 
responded to the outbreak by providing patients with 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, including 
hospital admission where necessary, and did contact 
investigations to prevent further transmission.
The most detailed epidemiological information was 
available for seven of eight patients diagnosed in 
Switzerland (SW1–3 and SW5–8). Among these seven 
patients, five mentioned passing through Bani Waleed 
and one described a location consistent with it.

We considered whether or not any of these cases could 
have been the outbreak source case. SW1, who was the 
first known outbreak case to arrive in Bani Waleed, lived 
approximately 60 km south of Hargeisa in northern 
Somalia. Although he reported having haemoptysis in 
2014 before migration, he reported no further symptoms 
between 2014 and arrival in Switzerland. SW5, who lived 
approximately 80 km from Hargeisa, over the Ethiopian 
border, also reported haemoptysis in 2014 before 
migration. However, he was eventually diagnosed with 
mediastinal lymph node disease in Switzerland, where 
no evidence of parenchymal lung disease was identified 
to account for the history of haemoptysis. Both patients 
passed through Hargeisa at different times, one spending 
2 months and the other spending 10 days there.
An alternative candidate source case was SW8, who 
grew up in a refugee camp in Djibouti more than 200 km 
northwest of Hargeisa and reported a family tuberculosis 
contact before migration. However, he was eventually 
diagnosed with pleural tuberculosis and therefore not 
considered infectious. SW2 came from Mogadishu where 
he reported a family tuberculosis contact. Although he 
passed through Hargeisa, he only stayed for one night. 
Although his symptoms are thought to have started in 
Bani Waleed, he arrived there after other outbreak 
patients had already arrived in Europe (figure 2), so he 
could not have been the source. SW6 originated from 
Mogadishu and travelled with a cousin who died with 
haemoptysis shortly after they both left Bani Waleed. 
Assuming that they travelled together all the way, they 
would have arrived too late to have infected FI1, the first 
of the known outbreak patients to leave Bani Waleed 
(figure 2). FI1 was never infectious himself. More detailed 
data for other patients passing through Bani Waleed were 
not available.
Italy’s bottleneck was wider, with various ports of 
disembarkation 
described, 
including 
Lampedusa, 
mainland Sicily, Sardinia, and Apulia (figure 3). Further 
details of when patients passed through other Italian 
cities and the location and conditions in which they 
stayed were not available, making inferences about the 
likelihood of transmission between individuals in Europe 
difficult. So far, no cases of transmission to people 
already living in Europe have been reported, and a search 
of the ECDC MIRU-VNTR-based database of isolates 
covering the period of 2003–15 identified only those 
isolates that we had already included as outliers.
Discussion
This investigation involved a coordinated effort across 
seven European countries over 6 months. A process of 
local sequencing of isolates and centralised analysis of 
WGS data in Borstel was rapidly coordinated to confirm 
patients’ links to the cluster. Epidemiological data were 
simultaneously collected at a country level and shared 
with national tuberculosis surveillance programmes, the 
ECDC, and the international team of researchers aiding 
the analysis. All patients remain on treatment under the 
supervision of local health-care teams, with the exception 
of one who was lost to follow-up. No reports have 
emerged of transmission of this outbreak strain to people 
other than those making the perilous journey from the 
Horn of Africa or Sudan to Europe.
Somalis made up just 8·1% of migrants or refugees 
crossing the Mediterranean northwards in 2015,9 but 
22 (76%) of 29 patients in the outbreak, suggesting social 
clustering along cultural or linguistic lines as patients 
travelled. From the available epidemiological data, the 
most likely hotspot of transmission is Bani Waleed, 
where 12 patients are thought to have passed through; 
additionally, transmission is likely to have happened 
elsewhere along the route to account for the other 
genomically tightly clustered cases. Given the low 
genomic variation between the outbreak isolates, the 
most parsimonious interpretation is that a single 
introduction of the strain to Bani Waleed occurred or 
several patients were infected en route before arrival or 
shortly after leaving. The alternative hypothesis that 
geographically dispersed patients whose M tuberculosis 
isolates share a very recent ancestor were infected before 
starting their travels within the same time window is 
most unlikely.
Identification of the likely source case is difficult. 
Although other patients might well have been involved, 
among the patients for whom data were available, SW1 
might be the most likely source if one assumes that he 
was symptomatic en route, despite what he reported. 
This 
hypothesis 
would 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
phylogeographical signal in the sequence data that shows 
that all of the serendipitously obtained outlier isolates—
ie, those from Djibouti—share the closest common 
ancestor with the outbreak isolates. The other outlier 
isolates originate from a wider area than Djibouti and are 
likely to represent a larger regional clonal expansion of a 
strain that we have subsampled here.
A major limitation of the epidemiological data is that 
patient interviews were, by their nature, retrospective. 
The refugees or migrants might easily have lost sense of 
both time and location during their journeys and their 
accounts might have lacked precision. They often 
travelled at night, in trucks, under direction of human 
traffickers, held in detention camps without access to 
communications. Moreover, some patients were un-
comfortable giving an accurate account of their journey 
even if they did recall it. This reluctance might have been 
due to the trauma—accounts emerged of executions, 
rape, forced labour, and refugees being sold into slavery 
by the human traffickers—or to fear of the data being 
shared with immigration authorities and it affecting their 
asylum claims. The main limitations of the genomic data 
were the few available contextualising isolates and the 
fact that they were obtained from a convenience sample.
The five-SNP threshold that separated our outbreak 
isolates from the outliers was calibrated in a low-burden

setting where it was considered predictive of recent 
transmission. However, in a high-intensity transmission 
setting, a lower threshold than this one might be 
warranted.18,21 The fact that a maximum of two SNPs 
separate any two outbreak isolates does, however, suggest 
a recent common ancestor, if not necessarily direct 
transmission between patients. The existence of 
additional perhaps intermediary cases unknown to us 
somewhere between the Horn of Africa and Europe is 
very likely.
The presence of the tlyA N236K mutation in all 
58 samples, both multidrug-resistant and susceptible, 
suggests that this mutation is a phylogenetic marker for 
this sub-branch of the Cameroon sublineage. Further 
sampling will be required to assess how deep this 
mutation lies on the tree. Although it was not featured by 
Coll and colleagues14 as part of their SNP barcode for 
typing of M tuberculosis, a distance of more than 100 SNPs 
between the most remotely related of the 58 isolates 
suggests a common ancestor likely to predate the 
antibiotic era. An allelic exchange experiment would be 
one way to definitively explore whether or not this SNP is 
the first phylogenetic marker in M tuberculosis sensu 
stricto underlying resistance to an antituberculosis drug, 
but now substantial supporting circumstantial evidence 
exists. Not only were 45 (96%) of 47 tested isolates resistant 
to capreomycin, regardless of their susceptibility to other 
drugs, but also isolates were simultaneously susceptible to 
amikacin and kanamycin. Variation in tlyA is specific to 
capreomycin resistance and unlike variation in rrs does 
not also confer resistance to the aminoglycosides. Since 
this mutation was the only non-synonymous mutation 
within tlyA and rrs, the case appears strong.16,22,23 In the 
absence of selection through a historically indiscriminate 
use of capreomycin in the Horn of Africa, which we 
believe to be unlikely, this mutation is likely to have arisen 
through genetic drift, only coincidentally leading to 
capreomycin resistance. Its fixation implied absence of 
fitness cost.24,25 All multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 
isolates from this sublineage should therefore by 
definition be considered pre-extensively drug resistant.
More refugees and migrants are expected to attempt the 
Mediterranean crossing from Libya in summers to come, 
increasing the chances of seeing additional cases linked to 
this cluster in Europe. Until mid-July, 2017, at the time of 
writing, four additional isolates derived from patients 
diagnosed in Germany and one from a patient diagnosed 
in Italy, with the characteristic antibiotic susceptibility 
profile, were confirmed as part of the outbreak by WGS 
analysis. Each had a maximum number of two SNPs 
difference to any other outbreak isolate. Because of the 
unstable political situation in Libya, direct public health 
intervention was not possible in what is most likely to 
have been the main hotspot of transmission in this 
outbreak. The chances of achievement of this intervention 
in northern Somalia or Djibouti might be marginally 
greater than in Libya, but clearly still very challenging. 
However, this investigation has served to heighten 
awareness of the small but consequential risk of 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in this population, and 
linkage of patients to what might be an ongoing reservoir 
of source cases in Bani Waleed or elsewhere will 
nevertheless be useful. An understanding that ongoing 
transmission might be occurring in such centres will 
inform plans for more targeted screening and follow-up of 
patients who report passing through them than have been 
done so far. The investigation has also provided the data 
from which a rapid PCR-based screening test can be 
designed for laboratories serving the refugee and migrant 
reception centres for whom WGS platforms might still be 
out of reach. The mutations in pncA and tlyA could easily 
be incorporated into such a screening test that could be 
used alongside the usual commercial tests, such as the 
Xpert MTB/RIF test (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), as 
identification and treatment of multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis is of primary importance, whatever the 
strain. Indeed, a parallel E-detect TB initiative has already 
stationed 
the 
Xpert 
test 
in 
Sicily 
for 
migrant 
screening, with a plan to whole-genome sequence all 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cases identified and 
improve on some of the previously identified shortcomings 
in screening.26
A molecular epidemiological approach synthesising 
WGS and epidemiological data has helped delineate a 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis outbreak against the 
broad setting of a clonal expansion of a strain of 
M tuberculosis in the Horn of Africa and informed the 
hypothesis that this strain might have emerged in northern 
Somalia or Djibouti, with ongoing transmission in a 
detention camp in Libya. The WGS data have incidentally 
also helped identify what we hypothesise is the first 
phylogenetic marker in M tuberculosis sensu stricto that 
also causes drug resistance. By contrast, MIRU-VNTR data 
were not able to distinguish between outbreak and 
background isolates. This outbreak has shown how 
high-resolution WGS data can be produced rapidly, across 
borders, through effective collaboration between micro-
biological laboratories and national and supranational 
institutions, to good effect. To optimise the gain from such 
technology, it needs to be integrated as a routine component 
of outbreak response efforts. Consequently, the ECDC is 
now piloting a European Union-wide sequencing study 
(EUSeqMyTB),27 with an initial focus on multidrug-
resistant 
tuberculosis. 
Provision 
of 
a 
supportive 
environment allowing patients to adhere to treatment 
without fear of deportation is equally important, however.
