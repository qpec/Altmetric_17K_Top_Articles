Abstract
Background
Pharmaceutical company representatives likely influence the prescribing habits and profes-
sional behaviors of physicians. The objective of this study was to systematically review the
association between physicians’ interactions with pharmaceutical companies and their clini-
cal practices.
Methods
We used the standard systematic review methodology. Observational and experimental
study designs examining any type of targeted interaction between practicing physicians and
pharmaceutical companies were eligible. The search strategy included a search of MED-
LINE and EMBASE databases up to July 2016. Two reviewers selected studies, abstracted
data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate and independently. We assessed the quality of
evidence using the GRADE approach.
Results
Twenty articles reporting on 19 studies met our inclusion criteria. All of these studies were
conducted in high-income countries and examined different types of interactions, including
detailing, industry-funded continuing medical education, and receiving free gifts. While all
included studies assessed prescribing behaviors, four studies also assessed financial out-
comes, one assessed physicians’ knowledge, and one assessed their beliefs. None of the
studies assessed clinical outcomes. Out of the 19 studies, 15 found a consistent association

 between interactions promoting a medication, and inappropriately increased prescribing
rates, lower prescribing quality, and/or increased prescribing costs. The remaining four stud-
ies found both associations and lack of significant associations for the different types of
exposures and drugs examined in the studies. A meta-analysis of six of these studies found
a statistically significant association between exposure and physicians’ prescribing behav-
iors (OR = 2.52; 95% CI 1.82–3.50). The quality of evidence was downgraded to moderate
for risk of bias and inconsistency. Sensitivity analysis excluding studies at high risk of bias
did not substantially change these results. A subgroup analysis did not find a difference by
type of exposure.
Conclusion
There is moderate quality evidence that physicians’ interactions with pharmaceutical com-
panies are associated with their prescribing patterns and quality.
Introduction
Promotional activities within pharmaceutical industries were relatively high in the past few
years. In 2012, the pharmaceutical industry in the USA spent more than US$27 billion on drug
promotion [1]. In Canada, promotional activities were estimated to cost US$30000 per physi-
cian per year [2]. Pharmaceutical companies appear to spend much more on promotion than
they do on research and development (R&D) [3]. For example, a study based on annual reports
of pharmaceutical companies found that ten of the largest global pharmaceutical companies
spent a total of US$739 billion on ‘marketing and administration’ between 1996 and 2005
compared to US$288 billion on R&D for the same period [3].
The industry claims that the promotional activities aim to provide health care professionals
with scientific and educational information [4]. Also, surveys suggest that many physicians
believe that marketing does not influence their prescribing habits or acknowledge that it may
have an influence on some physicians but not on themselves [5–7]. Despite these claims, there
is evidence suggesting that the interaction of pharmaceutical companies with physicians may
have a negative effect on their clinical practice [8–11].
The last identified systematic review assessing the interaction of pharmaceutical com-
panies with physicians was published by Spurling et al. in 2010. The population under
study included both physicians in practice and residents in training [11]. The review
found high degrees of heterogeneity that may have been due to the diverse populations
under study (i.e., both practicing and in-training physicians). The review by Spurling et al.
could not reach definitive conclusions about the degree to which information from phar-
maceutical companies decreases, increases or has no effect on the quality, cost or fre-
quency of prescribing.
Since the publication of Spurling’s review, at least eight original studies have been published
[12–19]. One of these was a large study of the association between physicians’ receipt of meals
from industry and the rates of prescribing the promoted drug to Medicare patients [15]. That
study appears to be at lower risk of bias than the previously published studies, and thus would
contribute the improving the quality of the evidence. Therefore, the objective of our study was
to systematically review the association between physicians’ interactions with pharmaceutical
companies and their clinical practice.

 Methods
Protocol
We followed a detailed methodology that we describe in the protocol included in S1 Appendix.
The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines (S2 Appendix).
Eligibility criteria
The inclusion criteria were:
• Type of study design: observational design (e.g., cohort, time series analysis, before-after
design, case control, cross sectional), and experimental design (non-randomized controlled
trials, and randomized controlled trials);
• Type of participants: practicing physicians as defined in the primary studies
• Type of exposure: targeted interaction between physicians and pharmaceutical companies,
where there is direct interaction with the physician. Direct interactions could include indi-
vidual invitation to a continuing medical education (CME) event; active presentation of
industry-related information to the physician; or provision of gifts to the individual;
• Type of control: either no interaction or a lower level of interaction. The intention was to
capture studies that stratified the levels of interaction of physicians with medical representa-
tives, e.g., according to the number of visits within a specified period of time.
• Types of outcomes:
� Knowledge of physicians (e.g., accuracy of knowledge related to a specific medication);
� Attitude of physicians (e.g., perceived influence of information from pharmaceutical
company on their behavior);
� Behavior of physicians (e.g., prescribing quality; prescribing quantity/frequency; reliance
on pharmaceutical companies for drug information; giving drug sample to patients; sub-
mitting a formulary request for a drug made by a specific company);
� Financial outcomes (e.g., patient out of pocket expenses; prescription costs);
� Patients’ clinical outcomes.
The exclusion criteria were:
• Qualitative studies, ecological studies, econometric studies, editorials, letters to the editor,
and non-English studies.
• Studies focusing on medical students and physicians in training.
• Studies assessing the relationship between attitudes and behavior
• Studies assessing non-targeted interactions (e.g., journal advertisement) and research
funding
• Studies assessing interventions to share industry-independent drug information or interven-
tions to reduce interactions between physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The latter
has been addressed in a recent systematic review [20].
We did not exclude studies based on date of publication. We did not exclude any study
based on risk of bias. Instead, we conducted sensitivity analyses excluding studies at high risk

 of bias, and also took risk of bias into account when grading the quality of evidence using
GRADE approach.
Search strategy
We used OVID interface to electronically search MEDLINE and EMBASE in July 2016. The
search included both free text words and medical subject headings. It combined terms for phy-
sicians and pharmaceutical industry and did not use any search filter. A medical librarian
assisted with designing the search strategy (see supporting file S3 Appendix for full search
strategy). In addition, we reviewed the references lists of included and relevant primary studies
and literature reviews.
Selection of studies
Two reviewers screened the title and abstracts of identified citations for potential eligibility in
duplicate and independently. We retrieved the full text for citations considered potentially eli-
gible by at least one of the two reviewers. The two reviewers then screened the full texts in
duplicate and independently for eligibility. The reviewers resolved disagreement by discussion
or with the help of a third reviewer. They conducted calibration exercises and used a standard-
ized and pilot tested screening form.
Data collection
Two reviewers abstracted data from eligible studies using a standardized and pilot tested
screening form with detailed written instructions. When needed, disagreement was resolved
with the help of a third reviewer. The data abstracted included: type of study, funding source,
characteristics of the population, exposure, outcomes assessed, and statistical data. For studies
including both attending physicians and residents, we attempted to contact authors for data
relating to the former group.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two reviewers assessed the risk of bias in each eligible study in duplicate and independently.
They resolved disagreements by discussion or with the help of a third reviewer. We used the
tool suggested by the GRADE working group for assessing the risk of bias for observational
studies [21].
We calculated the risk of bias using the following criteria:
• Failure to develop and apply appropriate eligibility criteria (e.g., no clear eligibility criteria,
convenient sampling, under- or over-matching in case-control studies, selection of exposed
and unexposed in cohort studies from different populations, and low response rate (<60%)
with no attempts to compare non-respondents to respondents) [22].
• Flawed measurement of exposure (e.g., differences in measurement of exposure such as
recall bias in case- control studies, and subjective or self-reported assessment of exposure)
• Flawed measurement of outcome (e.g., differential surveillance for outcome in exposed and
unexposed in cohort studies, and subjective or self-reported assessment of outcome)
• Failure to adequately control confounding (e.g., failure of accurate measurement of all
known prognostic factors, absence of control group in a before-after study, failure to match
for prognostic factors and/or adjustment in statistical analysis
• Incomplete follow-up or failure to control for loss-to-follow up

 We graded each potential source of bias as high, low or unclear risk of bias. We used
unclear when the authors did not report enough information for us to make the judgment.
Data synthesis
We calculated the kappa statistic to assess the agreement between reviewers for full text
screening.
We conducted a meta-analysis to pool the results across studies for the association between
‘targeted interactions with physicians’ as the exposure of interest, and ‘changes in physician
prescribing behavior’ as the outcome of interest. We contacted the authors of studies that
appeared to have measured the outcome and exposure of interest, but did not report data
(such as odds ratio or standard error) that we could include directly. We received responses
from authors of 7 out of 9 relevant studies. The authors provided us with the needed informa-
tion for only two out of the seven studies. Please refer to S1 Table for a summary of author
contacts.
We used the following a priori plan for choosing which data to include in the meta-
analysis:
• For studies reporting on more than one type of exposure (e.g., gifts, detailing), we treated
each exposure as a separate unit of analysis.
• For studies measuring the same outcome at several points in time, we chose the first time
point to avoid any potential confounding effects from subsequent measures.
• For studies assessing the association of interest for more than one drug (i.e., reporting more
than one association), we included the value that is the closest to the mean of all reported val-
ues amongst those associations.
We used the generic inverse variance technique with a random-effects model to pool the
association measures across included studies that reported the needed statistical data. We car-
ried out statistical analysis using RevMan (version 5.2).
To take into account the heterogeneity introduced by the different types of exposures (i.e.,
gifts, detailing, and CME), we stratified the meta-analyses by type of exposure. We tested the
results for homogeneity using the I2 test and considered heterogeneity present if I2 exceeded
50%.
In addition, we conducted three post-hoc sensitivity analyses by respectively excluding:
• Studies at high risk of bias;
• Studies funded by pharmaceutical industry;
• Studies measuring the outcome of interest as ‘changes in generic prescription’ or ‘formulary
request’ (as these were considered indirect measures compared with the ‘changes in the pre-
scribing of promoted drug’).
Although we had planned to construct funnel plots to assess publication bias, the number
of included studies in the meta-analyses was too low to allow for that. Indeed, funnel plots are
encouraged for interventions that include at least 10 studies, with a substantially higher num-
ber required if significant heterogeneity is present.[23].
We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the body of evidence [21]. The
GRADE methodology involves rating the initial quality of evidence for an association as high
(with observational data), followed by downgrading based on five criteria (risk of bias, incon-
sistency, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias), and upgrading based on three criteria
(large effect size, dose-response gradient, and plausible confounding) [24].

 We narratively reported any additional results that we were not able to include in the meta-
analysis from eligible studies (this includes studies that could have contributed data to the
meta-analysis). Whenever provided, we included the p-value to denote significance of results.
Results
Selection of studies
Fig 1 shows the study flow. Of the 12, 400 article titles identified by the electronic literature
search, 20 articles reporting on 19 studies met our inclusion criteria (two articles reported on
different outcomes for the same study) [25, 26]. A list of the excluded studies along with rea-
sons for exclusion is provided in S2 Table. The kappa statistic value for full text screening was
0.89, suggesting high levels of agreement.
Characteristics of included studies
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 19 included studies. The design for the majority of stud-
ies was cross-sectional (n = 13). Four studies reported using pre-post study designs, [17, 27–29]
one was a retrospective cohort study [12] and one was a nested case-control study [30]. The
sample sizes in these studies varied between 10 and 279, 669 with a median of 206. One study
did not provide adequate information on the exact sample size [18]. The included studies were
conducted in the USA (n = 13), Australia (n = 1), Spain (1), Denmark (n = 1), Germany (n = 1)
and the Netherlands (n = 2). The publication year ranged from 1972 to 2016. The specialties of
the physicians in the majority of studies were primary care (including general practitioners,
family medicine, internal medicine) (n = 8); obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) (n = 1); der-
matologists (n = 1); mix (n = 3); and unclear (n = 6). The types of exposure assessed were sales
representatives’ visits or detailing (n = 10), industry-funded continuing medical education
including travel funds (n = 4), and receiving free gifts (e.g. drug samples, meals, gifts in the
form of office stationery, and grants and payments) (n = 11). One study assessed a mix of expo-
sures without reporting data specific to each exposure [31]. The types of outcomes assessed
were physicians’ prescribing behaviors (n = 19), physicians’ beliefs (n = 1), physicians’ knowl-
edge (n = 1) and financial outcomes (n = 4). Physicians’ prescribing behavior was defined as the
changes in quantity or quality of prescriptions. None of the studies assessed clinical outcomes.
Risk of bias
The detailed judgments about each risk of bias item for included studies are displayed in
Table 2. Fig 2 shows the corresponding risk of bias summary for these studies. For the majority
of the studies, the risk of bias was judged to be low for ‘appropriate eligibility criteria’, ‘mea-
surement of intervention’, and ‘measurement of outcome’, except for the ‘completeness of
data’ that was judged as unclear. For ‘controlling for confounding’ the risk of bias was judged
as low for nine studies, unclear for four studies, and high for six studies.
Findings of studies
Table 3 provides a summary of the outcomes and the statistical results reported for each
included study. Out of the 19 included studies, six reported data in a format that could be
included in the meta-analysis of the association between the exposure and the behavior (i.e.,
reported odds ratio or risk ratio or provided raw data allowing the calculation of an odds ratio)
[15, 17, 19, 27, 28, 30]. Below, we present the results of those six studies and their meta-analy-
sis. We then narratively report any additional results that we were unable to include in the
meta-analysis from eligible studies.

 Results of the meta-analysis
The study design of the six included studies were retrospective (n = 2), nested-case control

ing types of interactions (with some studies reporting on more than one type): detailing

Sondergaard et al. conducted a retrospective cohort study and reported a statistically signif-
icant effect of the first visit of drug representatives on the general practitioner’s drug prefer-
ence favoring the marketed drug (odds ratio (OR) 2.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72–
3.32) [17]. The effect on drug preference increased further after the second visit (OR = 1.51;
95% CI: 1.19–1.93), but no significant change was noted after the third visit (OR = 1.06; 95%
CI: 0.94–1.20). We considered the data for the first visits only as the analysis for subsequent
visits may be confounded by the effect of the previous visits as highlighted by the authors: “the
effect of promotional visits could in part be caused by representatives selecting practices with a
higher probability of adopting the promoted drug. Although we have controlled for the time
until first visit, a selection effect cannot be excluded.” Also, none of the remaining studies
included in the meta-analysis reported data for subsequent visits.
Bowman et al. conducted a pre-post survey showing the effects of attendance of three con-
tinuing medical education courses, each subsidized by a single but different drug company,
and the changes in rate of prescribing by physicians of course-related drugs [27]. We excluded
the results for courses I and II, given data were not matched. In course III, Diltiazem was the
sponsoring company’s drug. Prescribing Diltiazem most frequently to new patients statistically
increased from 22.3% to 33.9% pre-post course (p<0.05). In addition, the number of new pre-
scriptions for Diltiazem increased statistically from 31.4% to 50.1% pre-post course (p<0.05%)
[27]. We considered the first outcome and conducted sensitivity analysis that demonstrated no
important changes in results.
Pinckney et al. examined in a cross-sectional study the interaction between the availability
of medication samples in the clinics and the prescription preference of primary care prescrib-
ers (stated as the name of the medication) in response to two clinical vignettes [19]. Clinicians
who did not have samples in their offices were more likely to prescribe hypertension medica-
tion according to clinical practice guidelines (p<0.01), and more likely to prescribe a depres-
sion medication that was generic (p = 0.02) [19]. Multivariable regression models were
conducted only for the hypertension vignette. The findings showed that clinicians with sam-
ples were still less likely to select thiazide diuretic that is the preferred treatment for hyperten-
sion (OR = 0.15; 95% CI: 0.04–0.56).
Miller et al. conducted a retrospective study to look at the association of a pre-post removal
of drug sample closet and the percentage of medications prescribed to uninsured or Medicaid
patients as generics. Following a logistic regression model, the authors found that the absence
of the sample closet was associated with uninsured patients receiving a generic prescription
(OR = 4.54; 95% CI: 1.37–15.0) [28].

• Detailing
• Receiving free drug
Behavior: prescription of Temazepam routinely in
preference to alternatives, the timing of prescription of
Temazepam
• Physicians who had contact with detailmen regarding
Temazepam reported earlier awareness of it (p < 0.041),
were more likely to rate it as a moderate advance (as
opposed to a minor advance or no advance at all) (p<
0.028), were more likely to have prescribed it (p< 0.0031),
reported prescribing it earlier (p< 0.005) and were more
likely to prescribe it routinely in preference to alternatives
(p< 0.014).
• Physicians who had received a sample of Temazepam,
compared to those who had not, were more likely to have
prescribed it (p < 0.001) and more likely to say that they
now usually prescribe it rather than the alternatives
(p < 0.006).

• Detailing
• Attending industry-sponsored
educational symposia
• Speaking at industry-sponsored

Behavior: Physicians’ formulary request for a drug
made by a specific company
• Physicians who had met with pharmaceutical
representatives were significantly more likely to have
requested that drugs manufactured by specific companies
be added to the formulary, than other physicians
(OR = 3.4; 95% CI: 1.8–6.6).
• Increased odds of formulary requests were obtained for
physicians who had accepted money from those
companies to attend educational symposia (OR = 7.9;
95% CI: 1.1–55.6).
• Increased odds of formulary requests were obtained to

[25]
Detailing
Behavior: quality of drug prescribed, reflected via 3
indicators combined to produce a global indicator
variable; Utilization of information obtained from
visiting sales representatives
• Using information obtained from pharmaceutical
representatives is associated with a higher percentage of
prescription drug not included in the primary care
formulary and with a higher “global indicator variable”,
thus reflecting lower prescription quality.
• Utilization of the visiting marketers’ information remained
significantly associated with higher amounts of
prescription (p = 0.048) Utilization of the visiting
marketers’ information was significantly associated with
higher expenditure per physician (p = 0.035); however
number of sales representative visits was not statistically
associated with expenditure.

Receiving free samples
• Behavior: prescription preference of physicians in
response to two clinical vignettes
• Beliefs: agreeing with statements about sample use,
measured on 5-point Likert scales, subsequently
dichotomized into “Agree” versus “Don’t agree”
• Clinicians with samples available were less likely to
prescribe thiazide diuretics according to clinical practice
guidelines [OR = 0.2 (95% CI: 0.06–0.68)]. To test the
robustness of this conclusion, authors conducted a full
regression which showed that clinicians with samples
were still less likely to select a thiazide diuretic [OR = 0.15
(95% CI: 0.04–0.56].
• Prescribers with samples were significantly more likely to
believe that samples: are liked by patients, expedite
treatment, help patients who cannot afford their
medication, reduce patient costs, and help physicians
assess the efficacy of medications. Most prescribers with
samples still agreed that they alter treatment plans and
increase the costs of care

 In a nested case-control study, Chren el at found that physicians who had met with pharma-
ceutical representatives were significantly more likely to have requested that drugs manufac-
tured by specific companies be added to the formulary, than other physicians (OR = 3.4; 95%
CI 1.8–6.6) [30]. Similar increased odds of formulary requests were obtained for physicians
who had accepted money from those companies to attend educational symposia (OR = 7.9;
95% CI: 1.1–55.6), or to speak at educational symposia (OR = 3.9; 95% CI: 1.2–12.7). We
treated each exposure as a separate unit of analysis in the meta-analysis.
Dejong et al. examined in a cross-sectional study the association between the receipt of an
industry-sponsored meal promoting the drug of interest and prescribing rates of promoted
drugs compared with alternatives in the same class [15]. Physicians who received a single meal
promoting the drug of interest had higher rates of prescribing Rosuvastatin over other statins
(OR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.17–1.18), Olmesartan over other ACE inhibitors and ARBs (OR = 1.52;
95% CI: 1.51–1.53), Nebivolol over other β-blockers (OR = 1.70; 95% CI: 1.69–1.72), and Des-
venlafaxine over other SSRIs and SNRIs (OR = 2.18; 95% CI: 2.13–2.23). We included the
value that is the closest to the mean of all reported values amongst those associations.
We pooled the results for the six studies in a meta-analysis, stratified by type of exposure.
Please refer to S3 Table for a summary of all decisions and their rationale with respect to the
statistical data included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimate showed a statistically signifi-
cant association between interaction with pharmaceutical industry and physicians’ prescribing
behaviors (OR = 2.52; 95% CI: 1.82–3.50). The heterogeneity was considered high with I2 of
64% (Fig 3). The test for subgroup effect did not identify any subgroup difference by type of
exposure (Test for subgroup differences: P = 0.88).
Fig 4 shows the risk of bias summary for these six studies. We judged the overall risk of bias in
four of these studies as low [15, 17, 28, 30]. Following the GRADE methodology we downgraded

Receiving free drug samples
• Behavior: brand-name medications prescribed per
office visit for a primary initial diagnosis of acne
vulgaris or rosacea in 2010
• Financial outcomes: the mean cost of acne
medications prescribed per office visit.
• The increase in provision of samples with a prescription
by dermatologists was strongly correlated (r = 0.92) to the
increase use of branded generic drugs promoted by these
samples. For physicians at local academic centers where
free samples are prohibited, only 17% of the commonly
prescribed medications were for branded or branded
generic drugs compared to 79% for office-based
dermatologists on a national level where free samples are
available.
• The national mean total retail cost of prescriptions was
conservatively estimated to be twice as higher (roughly
$465 nationally versus $200 at an academic medical
center where samples were prohibited)

Behavior: Rate of prescribing brand-name statins as
compared with generic statins for lowering cholesterol
Among physicians with industry payments reported in the
Massachusetts database, every $1000 in total payments
received was associated with a 0.1% increase in the rate
of brand-name statin drug prescribing (95% CI, 0.06%–
0.13%; P < .001). Payments for educational training were
associated with an average 4.8% increase in brand-name
prescribing compared with no receipt of educational
training (95%CI, 1.55–7.95;P = .004), but the other
payment types were not.

 the quality of evidence for the outcome ‘behavior of physician’ from high to moderate for risk of
bias and inconsistency. There was no major concern with imprecision, indirectness of the evi-
dence, or publication bias warranting further downgrading.
The first sensitivity analysis excluded two studies judged as having an overall high risk of
bias [19, 27]. The analysis found no important change in the pooled effect estimate (OR = 2.55,
95% CI: 1.75–3.71). In the second sensitivity analysis, we excluded the one study funded by
pharmaceutical industry [17]. The analysis resulted in a non-substantial increase in size of the
pooled effect estimate (OR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.78–4.23). The third sensitivity analysis excluded
two studies measuring the outcome of interest as ‘changes in generic prescription’ [28] and
‘formulary requests’ [30], respectively. The analysis resulted in the pooled effect estimate
decreasing slightly in size but remaining statistically significant (OR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.62–
2.74). The details of the analyses are provided in S1, S2 and S3 Figs, respectively.”
Narrative summary of studies not included in the meta-analysis
As noted above, fourteen eligible articles reporting thirteen studies were not included in the
meta-analysis [12, 14, 16, 25, 26, 29, 31–37]. In addition, we narratively summarized the

come ‘beliefs of physicians’ [19].
The study designs were cross-sectional (n = 12), pre-post survey (n = 1) [27] and retrospec-
tive cohort study (n = 1)[12]. These studies assessed the following types of interactions
between physicians and drug representatives (with some studies reporting on more than one
type): detailing (n = 8); continuing medical education including travel funding (n = 2);

 receiving free gifts (e.g. drug samples, meals, grants and payments) (n = 9); and a mix of inter-
actions (n = 1; this study did not report data specific to each exposure). We summarized the
results narratively, stratified by type of exposure and within each exposure by risk of bias.
Detailing (or pharmaceutical representative visits).
Nine articles reporting on eight
studies evaluated the interactions between physicians and pharmaceutical sales representatives
[12, 14, 25, 26, 34–37]. All of these studies assessed prescribing behaviors. In addition to assess-
ing prescribing behavior, one assessed financial outcome [25] and one assessed physicians’
knowledge [37]. Five of the eight studies found an association between detailing and increased
prescribing frequency, lower prescribing quality, higher expenditure, or earlier awareness of
promoted drugs. Three studies found both associations with higher prescribing frequency or
expenditures and lack of significant associations, for the different types of drugs or exposures
examined. The overall risk of bias was judged as high for two of the eight studies [14, 37].
Figueiras et al. and Caamano et al. conducted a cross-sectional study to examine the associ-
ation between detailing and the amount, expenditure and quality of drug prescribed by pri-
mary care physicians. The quality of prescription was reflected via three indicators which were
combined to produce a global indicator variable. Figueiras et al. showed that using information
obtained from pharmaceutical representatives was associated with a higher percentage of pre-
scription drug not included in the primary care formulary and with a higher “global indicator
variable”, thus reflecting lower prescription quality [26]. Camaano, et al., found that the utiliza-
tion of the visiting marketers’ information was significantly associated with higher amounts of
prescription (p = 0.048) and higher expenditure per physician (p = 0.035) [25]. On the con-
trary, the number of sales representative visits was not statistically associated with prescription
amount or expenditure.
Pedan et al. conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the impact of detailing on new
prescriptions for three different statin brands, namely, Lipitor, Crestor and Vytorin [12]. The
authors provided data for promotional activities of ‘own brand’ and the promotion of ‘compet-
itive brand’. The findings for ‘own promotion’ indicated that detailing produced a highly sig-
nificant positive impact on new prescriptions for Lipitor and Crestor (p<0.05), while results
were not significant for Vytorin. ‘Competitive’ detailing had a significant negative impact on
new prescription for Vytorin (p<0.05) whereas results were not significant for the other two
brands.
Muijrers et al. conducted a cross-sectional study and found that more frequent visits from
pharmaceutical industry representatives had a significant negative correlation with the quality
of prescribing of general practitioners measured as “adherence to guidelines” (p<0.05) [36].
The latter was calculated as a weighted average score on 20 prescribing indicators based on
general practice guidelines of the Dutch College of General Practitioners.
Mizik et al. conducted a pooled time series cross-sectional study to evaluate the association
between pharmaceutical sales representative visits per month and the number of new prescrip-
tions issued by a physician per month for three studied drugs [35]. The average number of
new prescription per month by drug, were: 1.56 (95% CI: 0.80–2.23) for drug A; 0.32 (95% CI:
0.22–0.43) for drug B; and 0.15 (95% CI: 0.11–0.20) for drug C.
Becker et al. conducted a cross-sectional study and found that the use of detail men as
sources of prescribing information concerning new drugs was significantly associated with
higher prescription of the drug chloramphenicol by primary care physicians (p<0.01), and a
poorer rating of prescription quality (p<0.01) by two panels of experts relative to five common
complaints and five common illnesses [34].
The findings of the remaining two studies with overall high risk of bias are discussed below
[14, 37].

 Peay et al. conducted a cross-sectional study and found that doctors (specialists and general
practitioners) who had contact with detail men regarding the promoted drug Temazepam
reported earlier awareness of it (p < 0.041), were more likely to rate it as a moderate advance
(as opposed to a minor advance or no advance at all) (p< 0.028), were more likely to have pre-
scribed it (p< 0.0031), reported prescribing it earlier (p< 0.005) and were more likely to pre-
scribe it routinely in preference to alternatives (p< 0.014) [37]. In the multivariate analysis,
contact with detail man regarding Temazepam and first news of drugs from detail man
remained significantly related to four of the five dependent variables correlating with prescrip-
tion of Temazepam.
In another cross-sectional study, Lieb et al. found that frequently visited practices (i.e. daily
or 2–3 times per week) had a significantly higher number of prescriptions (p = 0.005) and total
daily doses per patient (p = 0.003) compared to practices visited less frequently by representa-
tives. However, they did not have a higher total expenditure per patient (p = 0.115). The effects
of the “frequency” of pharmaceutical sales representatives visits on prescribing behavior were
no longer significant after taking into consideration the number of patients per office [14].
Continuing medical education.
Two studies assessed the effects of industry-funded con-
tinuing medical education on physician prescribing behaviors [14, 29] and expenditure on off-
patent branded drugs [14]. Both studies found significant associations between attending
industry-funded continuing medical education and higher prescribing frequency, lower pre-
scribing quality, or increased prescription cost. The overall risk of bias was judged as high for
one of them [14].
A pre-post study tracked the prescribing pattern for two drugs before and after physi-
cians attended symposia sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. The ‘expense-paid
seminar at a resort’ was associated with a significant increase in the prescribing of the two
promoted drugs within a few months of each symposium compared to their use before the
symposium (p<0.001) [29].
The cross-sectional study with high risk of bias found that compared to doctors who fre-
quently, occasionally or rarely took part in sponsored CME events, doctors who mentioned
that they never took part in such events had a lower number of on patent-branded drug pre-
scriptions per patient (mean ± SD; 1.05±0.35 vs. 1.27±0.55; p = 0.005, a higher proportion of
generics (83.28±7.77% vs. 76.34±13.58%; p<0.0005) and lower expenditure on off-patent
branded drugs per patient (£27.36±23.23 vs. £43.75±43.22; p = 0.002) [14].
Receiving free gifts.
Nine studies evaluated receiving free gifts as the exposure of interest
[12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 32, 33, 35, 37]. All of these studies assessed prescribing behaviors. In addi-
tion to assessing prescribing behaviors, two assessed financial outcomes [18, 32] and one
assessed physicians’ beliefs [19]. For the latter study, we did not include the findings pertaining
to prescribing behavior as these were already included in the meta-analysis. Five of the nine
studies found an association between receiving free gifts and increased prescribing frequency,
lower prescribing quality, or increased prescription cost. Each of three studies found both
associations with higher prescribing frequency and lack of significant associations, for the dif-
ferent types of gifts examined in the studies. The remaining study found that prescribers with
access to samples were significantly more likely to believe that samples benefited patients. The
overall risk of bias was judged as high for four of the nine studies [14, 19, 33, 37].
Pedan et al. conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the effects of sample dispens-
ing and meals on total monthly number of new prescriptions written by a physician for the
three leading statin brands (Crestor, Lipitor and Vytorin) [12]. The authors provided data for
promotional activities of ‘own brand’ as well as the promotion of ‘competitive brand’. The find-
ings for ‘own promotion’ showed that sample dispensing had a significant positive effect on
new prescription for Crestor (p<0.01) and Vytorin (p<0.05), but results were not significant

 for Lipitor. They also found that free meals had a significant positive impact on new prescrip-
tion for all three statin brands: Lipitor (p<0.05), Crestor (p<0.05) and Vytorin (p<0.01). ‘Com-
petitive’ sampling had a significant negative impact on new prescription for Lipitor (p<0.05)
and Vytorin (p<0.05) but results were not significant for Crestor. ‘Competitive’ free meal-
related promotions had a significant negative impact on Lipitor only (p<0.05) The authors con-
cluded that, while on average the marketing efforts affect the brand share positively, the magni-
tude of the effects is very brand specific.
Mizik et al. conducted a pooled time series cross-sectional study to examine the association
between receiving free sample medications and the number of new prescriptions issued by a
physician per month for three drugs [35]. They observed statistically significant but small
effects of sample dispensing on prescription behavior for all three types of drugs.
In a cross-sectional study, Symm et al. examined the prescription claims data for 25 med-
ications in one “clinic X” where sample medications were dispensed compared to two clin-
ics, Y and Z, which did not dispense free sample medications [32]. They showed that, first,
family physicians in clinic X significantly wrote the largest proportion of prescriptions for
study medications (p <0.0001) versus non-study medications. Second, family physicians in
clinic X significantly prescribed the lowest proportion of preferred name brands among
study medications (p <0.0001). Third, the average cost of a 30-day prescription differed sig-
nificantly by clinic (p <0.0001), being the highest in clinic X.
Hurley et al. conducted a cross-sectional study and found a strong correlation (r = 0.92)
between the increase in provision of samples with a prescription by dermatologists and
increased use of branded generic drugs promoted by these samples [18]. For physicians at
local academic centers where free samples are prohibited, only 17% (230 of 1364) of the com-
monly prescribed medications were for branded or branded generic drugs compared to 79%
for office-based dermatologists on a national level where free samples are available. Addition-
ally, the national mean total retail cost of prescriptions was “conservatively” estimated to be
twice as higher (roughly $465 nationally versus $200 at an academic medical center where
samples were prohibited).
Yeh et al. found that among physicians with industry payments in the Massachusetts data-
base, every $1000 in total payments received was associated with a 0.1% increase in the rate of
brand-name statin drug prescribing (95% CI: 0.06%-0.13%; P < .001) [16]. Receiving payment
for educational training was associated with an average 4.8% increase in prescribing of brand-
name drugs (95% CI: 1.55–7.95; p = 0.004), but the other types of payment (i.e. food, grants/
education gifts, and bona fide services) were not.
The findings of the four studies with overall high risk of biases are summarized below.
Peay et al. examined in a cross-sectional study the association between receiving a sample
of Temazepam and physicians’ prescription rate and preference for it over the alternatives
[37]. They demonstrated that physicians (specialists and general practitioners) who had
received a sample of Temazepam, compared to those who had not, were more likely to have
prescribed it (p < 0.001) and more likely to say that they now usually prescribe it rather than
the alternatives (p < 0.006).
Pinckney et al. examined the association between the presence of samples in offices and
prescribers’ beliefs about the use of samples. They found that prescribers with samples were
significantly more likely to believe that samples: are liked by patients; expedite treatment; help
patients who cannot afford their medication; reduce patient costs; and help physicians assess
the efficacy of medications. Nonetheless, most prescribers with samples still agreed that sam-
ples alter treatment plans and increase the costs of care [19].
In another cross-sectional study, Lieb et al. found that physicians who always or frequently
accepted gifts in the form of office stationery prescribed higher daily dose totals per patient

 (mean ± SD; 491.97±158.95 vs. 420.53±140.57; p = 0.003) and more generics (mean ±SD;
385.52±147.52 vs. 319.43±133.69; p = 0.004) in comparison to physicians who only occasion-
ally, rarely or never accepted stationery [14]. We did not include the other types of gifts as the
categorization of answer options was not conducive to interpretation (e.g., the categories
‘rarely’ ‘frequently’ and ‘occasionally’ were grouped together as exposure group and the cate-
gory ‘never’ as control group for one type of gift whereas for another type of gift, the categories
‘frequently’ ‘occasionally’ ‘rarely’ and ‘never’ were categorized together as control group).
Anderson et al. conducted a cross-sectional study and found that the frequency of eating
industry-funded food was associated with greater reliance of obstetrics and gynecology physi-
cians on pharmaceutical representatives for drug information when prescribing new medica-
tions [33]. This finding was statistically significant in a first regression analysis (β = 0.16, 95%
CI: 0.02–0.31). It became non-significant in a second regression model including as an inde-
pendent variable “the perceived value of pharmaceutical representatives in helping physicians
to learn about new drugs” (β = 0.07, 95% CI: -0.06–0.19).
Mixed exposures.
One cross-sectional study with overall high risk of bias examined the
association between rational prescribing of general practitioners and a mix of exposures
including “manufacturer’s representatives, drug companies’ mailings, use of samples, drug
companies’ journals, drug firm meetings and usefulness of drug company information” [31].
The investigators found that reliance on information from pharmaceutical industry was nega-
tively associated with prescribing rationality (p<0.001).
Discussion
Summary and interpretation of findings
We identified 19 studies looking the association between physicians’ interactions with phar-
maceutical companies and their prescribing behaviors. In addition to assessing prescribing
behavior, four of the 19 studies assessed financial outcomes [12, 19, 26, 35], one assessed physi-
cians’ knowledge [37], and one assessed their beliefs [19]. None of the included studies
assessed clinical outcomes.
Out of the 19 studies, 15 found a consistent association between interactions promoting a
medication, and inappropriately increased prescribing rates, lower prescribing quality, and/or
increased prescription costs. Each of three studies found both associations with higher prescribing
frequency and lack of significant associations, for the different types of exposures and drugs
examined in the studies [12, 16, 25]. Only one study, albeit at high risk of bias, found an associa-
tion between receiving gifts from the industry and increased generic prescribing whereas the
results were mixed for the remaining types of exposures and outcomes assessed in that study [14].
A meta-analysis of six of the included studies provided moderate quality evidence showing
more than doubling of inappropriate prescribing rate among practicing physicians. The het-
erogeneity was considered high. Sensitivity analyses excluding the two studies at high risk of
bias and the industry-funded study, respectively, did not substantially change these results. A
subgroup analysis did not find a difference by type of exposure.
Strengths and limitations of the review
A major strength of the present study is the use of Cochrane methodology for conducting the
systematic review. In addition, this is the first systematic review to focus on practicing physi-
cians, as other reviews included residents and physicians in training as their population of
interest [11]. A potential limitation of our review is that we searched only two electronic data-
bases. However, we believe our search was sensitive. Also, Spurling et al. did not include a
study that was eligible for our review, and that was missed by our search strategy. Another

 potential limitation is the exclusion of studies published in a language other than English.
Also, all included studies were conducted in developed, high-income countries; therefore,
there is a chance that we have missed studies conducted in low or middle-income countries
that have been published in a non-English language. However, given the consistency of find-
ings, we expect them to be generalizable to those countries. Another limitation relates to the
potential misattribution of the exposure category; however, such cases were few. One example
is the study conducted by Yeh et al. which considered “payments for CME” as different from
“payments for educational training” [16]. Other limitations relate to the observational nature
of all included studies and to our inability to include some studies in the meta-analysis because
they did not report data for the association between the exposure and the outcome of interest.
Comparison to findings of similar reviews
The latest systematic review addressing the same topic was published in 2010 and included
physicians as well as residents [11]. The chosen populations may have contributed to the high
level of statistical heterogeneity reported (I2 = 91%). Also, the previous systematic review
focused on exposure to information directly provided by pharmaceutical companies, and thus
excluded other types of exposures such as gifts, samples, and continuing medical education
courses that were funded by unrestricted grants from pharmaceutical companies. On the other
hand, our review has included these types of interaction and has covered 8 years of literature
since 2008, the year of literature search of the 2010 review. Still, our review included a relatively
lower number of studies compared to the previous review due to the stricter eligibility criteria
(e.g., we excluded residents and medical trainees; non-targeted interactions such as advertise-
ments in journals or prescribing software, or mailed information; and participation in spon-
sored clinical trials). Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with those of the previous
review in terms of decreased prescribing quality and increased costs associated with exposure
to information provided directly by pharmaceutical companies. In addition, we found evi-
dence of similar effects associated with drug samples and industry gifts (both of which were
not assessed in the previous review).
Implications for policy and practice
Our findings suggest that the interaction between physicians and pharmaceutical companies
should be better managed to reduce any negative effects and promote appropriate drug pre-
scribing. While many policy options have been proposed to manage the interactions between
physicians and pharmaceutical companies [38], the level of evidence supporting them varies,
as described below.
There is an increasing trend of mandating pharmaceutical companies to disclose payments
to physicians. For instance, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act enacted in the USA in 2010
requires pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers to publicly disclose payments (or
transfers of values) exceeding US$10 per instance or US$100 per year made to physicians and
teaching hospitals [39]. Similarly, Medicines Australia recently revised its code of conduct,
requiring pharmaceutical companies to report on payments to individual health professionals
for their services, sponsorships to attend educational events, as well as educational grants [40].
However, so far there is no evidence supporting the effectiveness of mandatory disclosure [20].
As an example of regulatory approach, France introduced in 2004 the French Sales Visit
Charter which requires sales representatives to provide physicians with “approved product
information” [41]. A report by French National Authority for Health pointed to the ineffec-
tiveness of the Charter and the difficulty in supervising the content of verbal information con-
veyed during representative visits [42].

 A potentially effective option would be to restrict physician-industry interactions, particu-
larly given the evidence that restriction policies may have a positive effect on improving pre-
scribing behavior [20]. This could be achieved, at the institutional level by restricting free
samples, promotional material, and meetings with pharmaceutical company representatives.
For example, Stanford University banned pharmaceutical sales representatives from its hospi-
tals [43]. Similarly, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Brody School of Medicine at
East Carolina University banned all industry involvement (including funding) in CME, report-
edly with success [44]. At a higher level, policy makers may consider legislation specifying the
types of interactions that are permissible, and those that are not. For example, Minnesota
enacted a law that bans pharmaceutical industries from providing gifts to physicians with a
total annual combined retail value above US$50 [38].
While some may claim that restricting interactions between physicians and pharmaceutical
companies could create an ‘information gap’, several studies conducted in different contexts
found that sales representatives often did not state the risks and harmful effects of drugs to
physicians [40, 41, 45]. Academic detailing has emerged as an effective alternative to industry-
dependent drug information [46, 47]. For instance, Canada and some USA states have estab-
lished nationally-funded academic detailing programs that rely on similar sales tactics utilized
by the pharmaceutical industry to influence physician prescribing according to evidence-
based guidelines [48].
Considerations should also be given to educating health care providers about the influence
of interactions with the pharmaceutical industry, as well as inclusion of courses on industry
marketing techniques and conflict of interest in medical curricula [49]. Existing evidence sug-
gests positive effects of educational programs about industry marketing strategies on medical
trainees’ attitudes and behaviors [50, 51].
Implications for research
Given all of the included studies were conducted in high-income countries, future studies
should explore the effect of interaction of physicians in low and middle-income countries with
pharmaceutical companies on their clinical practices. Also, it would be important to under-
stand the impact of these interactions on clinical outcomes.
