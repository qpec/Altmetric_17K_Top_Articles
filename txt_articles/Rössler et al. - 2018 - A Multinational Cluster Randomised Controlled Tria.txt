Abstract
Objective The objective of this study was to assess the
efficacy of a newly developed warm-up programme
(‘11? Kids’) regarding its potential to reduce injuries in
children’s football.
Methods Children’s football teams (under 9 years, under
11 years, and under 13 years age groups) from Switzer-
land, Germany, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands
were invited. Clubs were randomised to an intervention
group and a control group, and followed for one season.
The intervention group replaced their usual warm-up by
‘11? Kids’, while the control group warmed up as usual.
The primary outcome was the overall risk of football-
related injuries. Secondary outcomes were the risks of
severe and lower extremity injuries. We calculated hazard
ratios using extended Cox models, and performed a com-
pliance analysis.
Results In total, 292,749 h of football exposure of 3895
players were recorded. The mean age of players was 10.8
(standard deviation 1.4) years. During the study period, 374
(intervention group = 139; control group = 235) injuries
occurred. The overall injury rate in the intervention group
was reduced by 48% compared with the control group
(hazard ratio 0.52; 95% confidence interval 0.32–0.86).
Severe (74% reduction, hazard ratio 0.26; 95% confidence
interval 0.10–0.64) and lower extremity injuries (55%
reduction, hazard ratio 0.45; 95% confidence interval
0.24–0.84) were also reduced. Injury incidence decreased
with increasing compliance.
Conclusion ‘11? Kids’ is efficacious in reducing injuries
in children’s football. We observed considerable effects for
overall, severe and lower extremity injuries. The pro-
gramme should be performed at least once per week to
profit from an injury preventive effect. However, two
sessions per week can be recommended to further increase
the protective benefit.

 Key Points
The newly developed injury prevention programme
‘11? Kids’ is efficacious in reducing football injuries
in children.
Considerable protective benefits were found for
overall injuries, severe injuries and lower extremity
injuries.
Injury incidence decreased with increasing
compliance.
1 Background
Worldwide, the majority of football players (58%) is
younger than 18 years of age [1] and almost three quarters
of these young players are under 14 years of age [2].
However, epidemiological data on football injuries in this
age group are rare [3], and only one prospective large-scale
study focused on injuries in children’s football [4, 5]. The
characteristics of football injuries in 7- to 12-year-old
children differ from youth and adult players. For example,
the proportions of bone injuries and injuries to the upper
extremities are higher in children than in older players
[3, 4]. Thus, preventive programmes proven efficacious in
late adolescent or adult players need to be adapted for
younger age groups to accommodate for the specific injury
profile and maturational status of children [3].
Several studies have investigated the exercise-based
injury prevention programme ‘11?’ in players aged
14 years and older, and reported reductions (between 32
and 72%) in the incidence of all and/or lower extremity
injuries [6–9]. Several systematic reviews provide further
evidence of the preventive effect of ‘11?’ especially in
youth amateur football [10–13]. However, so far, no study
has investigated the prevention of football injuries in
children under the age of 14 years [14]. Compliance has
been discussed as an important factor. On the one hand, the
actual compliance is key to correctly interpreting the pre-
ventive effect of an intervention in the study setting. On the
other hand, a high compliance is crucial to reach as many
people as possible. The highest possible efficacy of the
intervention combined with the highest possible compli-
ance leads to the best possible injury reduction in the study
and real-life setting [15–17].
Based on the ‘11?’ programme and age-specific epi-
demiological data [4, 5], an international group of experts
developed and pilot tested an injury prevention programme
for 7- to 13-year-old children (‘11? Kids’) [18]. The pre-
sent study evaluated the efficacy of the ‘11? Kids’ pro-
gramme to reduce the incidence of injuries in 7- to 13-year-
old football players. We hypothesised that the overall
injury incidence would be reduced by at least one-third in
the intervention group compared with a control group [14].
2 Methods
2.1 Study Design and Definitions
The study was designed as a two-armed, cluster-ran-
domised controlled trial (level of evidence 1) according to
the CONSORT statement guidelines [19, 20], and con-
ducted as a multi-centre study in four countries (Switzer-
land, Germany, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands).
The trial was registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry
(NCT02222025). Clubs who agreed to participate in the
study were randomised to an intervention group (INT) or a
control group (CON), and followed for one season.
Clubs of the INT were instructed to use the new injury
prevention programme (‘11? Kids’) as a warm-up, while
CON clubs should warm up as usual. The CON clubs were
informed that they would receive the programme after the
end of the study if it proved efficacious in preventing
injuries.
Injury characteristics and football exposure were asses-
sed using guidelines for football injury research [21]. This
refers to injury severity, location, type and diagnosis as
well as definitions for training and match exposure.
According to other studies on sport injuries in children and
adolescents, the injury definition used was slightly adapted
[22, 23]. An injury was defined as any physical complaint
sustained by a child during a scheduled training session or
match play resulting in (a) the inability to complete the
current match or training session and/or (b) the absence
from subsequent training sessions or matches and/or (c) the
injury requiring medical attention [4].
3 Observation Period
The observation period comprised one football season from
August/September 2014 to June/July 2015.
3.1 Study Population and Recruitment
Between May and July 2014, 1094 officially registered
clubs with teams in the age categories under 9 years, under
11 years and under 13 years (boys and girls, born 2002–7)
were invited to participate in the study in Switzerland,
Germany, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands (Fig. 1).

 Inclusion criteria were: (1) the club must be officially
registered in the (regional) football association; (2) chil-
dren must be between 7 and 12 years of age at the start of
the study; and (3) regular training must take place at least
twice per week. Teams were not eligible for inclusion if the
coach already used an injury prevention programme or a
structured warm-up focusing on neuromuscular control.
Prior to the start of the study, information meetings were
conducted to inform coaches about the aims and proce-
dures of the study and, for INT teams only, to give detailed
instructions and practical application on the ‘11? Kids’
programme.
3.2 Ethics
The study complied with ethical standards and the Decla-
ration of Helsinki and was approved by the lead ethics
committee
(Ethikkommission
Nordwest-
und
Zen-
tralschweiz, EKNZ, Approval number 2014–232) and by
all other regional ethics committees (Saarbru
¨cken, Prague
and Amsterdam). All children and their parents received
written information about the aim and the methodology of
the project prior to the start of the study. Participation was
voluntary. Passive informed consent was acquired to
include children into the statistical analysis. In the case
where children or parents declined participation, parents
informed the researchers via e-mail or telephone. All par-
ents of injured children gave their active consent.
3.3 Randomisation
Participating clubs were randomised into INT or CON.
All teams of the same club were randomised into the
same group (clustered allocation with the club serving as
a cluster) to minimise the risk of contamination. Com-
puter-generated cluster randomisation was conducted by
one researcher (OF) who had no direct contact with the
clubs or team officials and who was not involved in the
intervention. Age group, country and number of partici-
pating teams per club served as the strata for the
randomisation.
3.4 Intervention
‘11? Kids’ is an exercise-based programme to prevent
football injuries in 7- to 13-year-old children. It was
developed by an international group of experts based on the
findings of an epidemiological study on injury incidence
and characteristics in children’s football [4, 5]. The struc-
ture of the programme refers to the established ‘11?’
programme, which has been shown to be efficacious in
players aged older than 13 years [7–9, 16].

 A study on the preliminary version of this programme
showed slight improvements in motor performance [18].
Such improvements have been described as a prerequisite
for successful injury reduction [16, 24]. In addition, the
programme proved feasible, and its acceptance was high
among coaches and players (unpublished data). The results
of this pilot study provided input for final programme
adaptations. Prior to the start of the study, two teams (that
did not take part in the study) extensively pilot tested the
final programme.
‘11? Kids’ consists of seven different exercises and can
be performed in about 15–20 min after familiarisation.
Three exercises focus on unilateral, dynamic stability of
the lower extremities (hopping, jumping and landing),
three exercises on whole body and trunk strength/stability,
and one exercise on falling technique. The difficulty of
each exercise is progressively increased in five levels to
account for the varying age- and maturity-related perfor-
mance levels, as well as for general differences in motor
skills of children aged 7–13 years [see ‘11? Kids’ manual,
Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM) 1 and 2]. Coa-
ches were instructed to start with the first level of each
exercise and to proceed with the next level when all players
were able to perform the exercise according to the
description in the manual. Hereby, specific attention was
set on the body alignment during the exercises (e.g. leg
alignment during single-leg jumps).
During the first weeks of the season, our study assistants
visited INT clubs and gave the coaches an instruction
session on how to apply the ‘11? Kids’ programme cor-
rectly.
Coaches
received
a
detailed
manual
of
the
‘11? Kids’ and a two-page summary for the pitch, and
were advised to use the ‘11? Kids’ programme at the
beginning of their training sessions as a replacement of
their usual warm-up at least twice a week. The coaches of
CON were instructed to perform their usual warm-up.
3.5 Injury Surveillance and Documentation
of Football Exposure
Player-specific football exposure (in minutes), sustained
injuries and session-based information about ‘11? Kids’
utilisation (INT only) were collected using an Internet-
based injury registration system. This online platform was
developed for (and successfully applied in) a previous
epidemiological study in children’s football [4, 5]. It had
been adapted based on previous experiences to improve the
usability of the system and, thereby, to increase the com-
pliance
of
the
coaches.
Self-reported
anthropometric
baseline data of the children were provided by parents at
the start of the study. One contact person for each team
(preferably, but not necessarily the coach) was appointed
and instructed to complete the injury and exposure entry
into the online injury recording system. The documentation
of exposure time and injuries in INT teams started after the
instruction session.
In case no data were entered within a period of 1 week,
an automated reminder e-mail was sent. If an injury
occurred, trained study assistants contacted the coach, the
player and the parents via telephone and/or e-mail to assess
all relevant aspects of the injury based on a standardised
injury registration form. If an injury received medical
treatment, parents were instructed to obtain the exact
diagnosis from the treating physician. All information on
each injury was screened by two medically trained inves-
tigators (MB, KadF), who were blinded to group allocation,
to ensure an objective and independent injury classification.
To ensure good compliance regarding entry of exposure
and injury data, four scientific assistants (one in each
country) and nine study assistants supported coaches dur-
ing data collection and injury recording. Each study
assistant was responsible for 10–15 clubs. Study assistants
were continuously in touch with the coaches via telephone
and e-mail, and visited unannounced two training sessions
of each team during the study period.
3.6 Evaluation of Feasibility and Acceptance
Among Coaches
Study participants (coaches and players) were involved in
the design of the intervention programme. In a previous
(pilot) study [18], the intervention programme has been
evaluated by coaches and players. Their valuable feedback
has been considered during the development of the final
version of the intervention programme, which was used in
the study at hand.
Furthermore, in this study, the intervention programme
has been evaluated by the coaches. The INT coaches were
asked to complete an online questionnaire about their
general rating of the programme (13 questions on e.g.
quality of the manual, time requirement) and each of the
seven exercises (five questions per exercise) at the end of
the study (see ESM 3). A five-level Likert scale was used
as described earlier [25].
3.7 Sample Size
For the primary outcome (overall injuries), sample size
estimation revealed that a total of 1935 children are needed
to detect a hypothetical hazard ratio (HR) of 0.66 with a
power of 80%, and an alpha level of 0.05. This is based on
the assumption that the club (cluster) contains 40 players
on average, the intraclass correlation coefficient is 0.05,
that 7% of the players in the control group will sustain an
injury during the season and taking into account a design
effect (inflation factor of 2.95) [4, 9, 26, 27].

 3.8 Statistical Procedure
Player-specific time-to-injury data were analysed using
extended Cox models. Uninjured children contributed their
right censored ‘survival times’ to the analysis. The models
contained mixed (random and fixed) effects. To acknowl-
edge the clustered data structure, we included the variable
‘club’
and
‘team’
as
a
random
effect.
Further,
to
acknowledge that multiple injuries of one player are not
independent, we also included the variable ‘id’ (player-
specific identifier) as a random effect. The models were fit
to reflect that ‘‘teams are nested in clubs’’, ‘‘players are
nested in teams’’ and ‘‘multiple injuries of one player are
nested in the player’’. This approach has been used previ-
ously [5]. During model building, we also fitted models to
include the ‘country level’ to account for the hierarchical
structure (i.e. ‘‘clubs located in countries’’). To decide
whether to include the additional level, we compared the
integrated log-likelihood value with the less complex
model (i.e. containing ‘team’ and ‘id’ level only). The Chi
square tests showed large p values (p C 0.58) for the
comparisons between models. We therefore decided to use
these less complex models (including ‘team’ and ‘id’ level)
[28–30].
The proportional hazard assumption was tested during
model building [31]. The intervention variable (INT vs.
CON) was used as a fixed effect. Further, we entered
variables (age, age-independent body height, age-inde-
pendent body mass and match-training ratio) that had
p\0.2 in the univariate analysis into the multivariate
model [5, 32]. When multicollinearity between two vari-
ables was present, we included the one with the smaller
p value into the multivariate analysis.
The analyses were performed using R (Version 3.2.2) in
combination with RStudio (Version 0.99.484) in a cloud
computing environment on multiple servers. We used the
‘coxme’ package (Version 2.2-5) to fit the models. Kaplan–
Meier curves were plotted for overall, severe and lower
extremity injuries.
To conduct a compliance analysis, we carried out a
tertile split of the INT players according to their weekly
‘11? Kids’ completion rate [8]. ‘‘Completion’’ was defined
as the full utilisation of the ‘11? Kids’ warm-up pro-
gramme (with all of its seven exercises as described in the
manual) at the beginning of a training session. We com-
pared the three INT groups (high/middle/low compliance)
against each other as well as against CON using extended
Cox models. We used player-specific ‘11? Kids’ comple-
tion data (rather than team-based information). Therefore,
the actual individual exposure to the intervention pro-
gramme was taken into account.
In addition, we used the aforementioned extended Cox
models in a different approach to investigate the influence
of compliance (completed ‘11? Kids’ training sessions per
week) on the reduction of injury rate. Thereby, a compli-
ance threshold was increased stepwise by 0.01 increments,
removing all players with a compliance below this
threshold. Our intention was to evaluate the benefit from
additional weekly sessions.
Finally, we applied the magnitude-based inference
approach to investigate the intervention effect regarding
specific types, locations and mechanisms of injuries. It has
to be mentioned that the study was not powered for these
subgroup analyses. However, it might provide useful
information about the clinical relevance of the effects
found. We used an open source spreadsheet to run the
analyses [33]. Hazard ratios and the associated p values
were used to get 90% confidence limits for, and inferences
about, the true value of an effect statistic. Threshold values
for ‘‘benefit’’ HR\0.77 and ‘‘harm’’[HR 1.30 were used.
Qualitative
descriptors
were
assigned
to
quantitative
chances of intervention effects as follows: 0.5–5%: ‘‘very
unlikely’’;[5–25%:
‘‘unlikely’’;[25–75%:
‘‘possibly’’;
[75–95% ‘‘likely’’;[95–99.5%: ‘‘very likely’’;[99.5%:
‘‘almost certainly’’ [34].
4 Results
4.1 Main Analysis
In total, 292,749 h of football exposure [7026 h (2.4%)
completed by girls] of 3895 players [n = 171 (4.4%) girls]
were recorded. The mean age of players was 10.8 (standard
deviation 1.4) years. The INT and CON players were of
similar age, body mass and height. Further baseline data
are presented in Table 1.
The overall injury rate in INT was reduced by 48%
compared with CON [HR 0.52; 95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.32–0.86]. Severe injuries (HR 0.26; 95% CI
0.10–0.64) and lower extremity injuries (HR 0.45; 95% CI
0.24–0.84) were also reduced (Fig. 2). Additional reduc-
tions were found regarding match injuries (HR 0.51; 95%
CI 0.27–0.94) and training injuries (HR 0.58; 95% CI
0.38–0.89). Mean lay-off time and the total number of days
lost because of injury were lower in INT (Table 1).
The number and incidence of injuries in INT and CON
by location, type and injury mechanism are presented in
Table 2. Knee, ankle, thigh and hip/groin injuries were less
frequent in INT with HRs ranging between 0.40 and 0.52.
Joint/ligament, muscle injuries, traumatic fractures, as well
as overuse-related complaints showed HRs between 0.12
and 0.56. Additionally, running/jumping, overuse/growth
and collision-related injuries were lower in INT with HRs
between 0.30 and 0.52 (Table 2).

 4.2 Compliance Analysis
Injury incidence decreased with the increasing utilisation
rate of the ‘11? Kids’ programme. The risk of injury was
lower in the high-compliance group and the middle-com-
pliance group compared with CON. The risk of injury in
the high-compliance group was half compared with the
low-compliance group (Table 3).
The extended Cox model revealed an influence of
compliance on injury incidence rates (HR 0.77; 95% CI
0.64–0.92) within the sample of INT players. The effect
remains consistent (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.59–0.96) when
adjusting for the known injury risk factors ‘age’, ‘age-in-
dependent body height’ and ‘and match-training ratio’ (i.e.
the hours of match play divided by the number of training
hours) of the players [5].
The compliance-threshold analysis revealed that the
added benefit of each additional session per week was
stable in players who performed the programme up to 0.75
times per week. Above this value, the influence of
compliance increased and reached its highest additional
benefit (per additional session) at 1.25 sessions per week.
4.3 Coaches’ Evaluation
The descriptive statistics of the evaluation of ‘11? Kids’
imply that coaches feel that injury prevention in general is
important (86% of coaches fully agreed and gave 5 out of 5
points, 9% gave 4 points, and 5% gave 3 points). The
quality of the ‘11? Kids’ manual was rated high (83% gave
5, 10% gave 4, 3% gave 3, 2% gave 2, and 2% gave 1
point). Coaches believe that the programme can prevent
injuries (29% gave 5, 34% gave 4, 34% gave 3, 2% gave 2,
and 2% gave 1 point) and improve a player’s performance
(10% gave 5, 38% gave 4, 41% gave 3, 10% gave 2, and
2% gave 1 point). The reported time requirement was 18.1
(standard deviation 4.4) min to perform the whole pro-
gramme. Time requirement was rated as being just rea-
sonable (21% gave 5, 30% gave 4, 19% gave 3, 24% gave
2, and 6% gave 1 out of 5 points) [see evaluation, ESM 3].

 5 Discussion
5.1 Principal Findings
Using ‘11? Kids’ as a warm-up reduced football injuries in
7- to 13-year-old children by 48% compared with the
control group. Particularly large protective benefits were
found for severe injuries (74%). The mean injury lay-off
time was reduced in INT. Importantly, the total number of
days lost to injury (i.e. absence from sport participation)
was also considerably lower (less than half).
Regular and frequent use of the programme appears to
be crucial to profit from the preventive effect and/or to
increase this effect. The compliance analysis showed a
clear dose–response relationship between the frequency of
performing ‘11? Kids’ and the injury rate. The programme
should be used at least once every week to profit from a
protective effect, and more often, to maximise the benefits
of the intervention programme.
5.2 Strengths and Weaknesses of the Study
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
investigate the effects of an injury prevention programme
for organised football in children younger than 13 years
of age. A general issue in exercise intervention studies is
that blinding of participants regarding group allocation is
nearly impossible. The percentage of girls in this study
was representative for the involved national football
associations. However, the low proportion of girls (and
number of injuries sustained by girls) limits the trans-
ferability of the observed effects to the population of
football-playing girls. However, comparable injury-pre-
ventive effects of the ‘11?’ have been described in young
female and male players [8, 9]. Therefore, it might be
speculated that the results found in the study at hand
could be transferred to the population of football-playing
girls.
We used extended Cox models to take into account
individual hazards (frailties) and potential team-clustering
effects. Although ‘frailty models’ have been used in
medical
applications
(e.g. cancer research)
for over
20 years [35], this approach is not established yet in the
field of sport science and medicine. This procedure enabled
us to analyse some subgroups of injuries (e.g. lower
extremity injuries and severe injuries) and to investigate
compliance with sufficient power.
Similar to comparable high-quality studies [6, 8, 9], data
were reported by coaches and partly by parents and players.
We aimed to improve the quality of reporting by the fol-
lowing means: at the beginning of the study, all coaches of
INT and CON were trained and sensitised to injury defi-
nitions and regularly contacted by our study assistants to
ensure timely and complete data entry. Throughout the
whole season, they were contacted on a regular basis to
improve compliance and completeness of documentation.
To minimise a potential recall bias, coaches received an
automated reminder e-mail within a week if they did not
enter data into the online system. After 2 weeks without
data entry, our study assistants contacted the coaches per-
sonally (via telephone and/or e-mail). Study assistants
visited two training sessions of each intervention team
(without previous announcement) to check whether they
used the intervention programme.
For all injuries, parents and injured children were con-
tacted to double check the information provided by the
coaches. Only for about half of the injuries (those that were
medically treated) medical diagnoses were available. Two
blinded medical professionals checked the plausibility and
consistency of injury data.
We used a very broad recruitment strategy in Switzer-
land (we contacted all 846 clubs in the German-speaking

 part of Switzerland per email) but not in the other coun-
tries. We did not observe relevant differences in injury
rates and intervention effects between countries. Further,
there were no differences regarding compliance to the
intervention programme. Therefore, we are quite confident
that the high level of refusal in Switzerland did not affect
the outcomes of the study.
The exposure time was lower in INT than in CON
because the documentation in the INT teams started after
the instruction session. However, the proportional hazard
assumption was fulfilled in both groups. Further, we per-
formed a sensitivity analysis by cutting the respective time
period (exposure time and injury events) in the control
group at the beginning of the season. The results were
similar compared to the regular analysis. Consequently, the
estimate of the intervention effect was very likely not
biased.
Dropout rate was higher in CON (13.9%) than in INT
(7.6%). This might be owing to the fact that CON coaches
only had ‘‘additional work’’ (i.e. data entry) without having
a ‘‘benefit’’ (i.e. receiving the intervention programme). In
turn, the lower dropout rate in INT might be interpreted in
favour of the intervention programme (structure and con-
tent as well as feasibility).
In addition to a standard compliance analysis (i.e. com-
parison of compliance groups based on tertile split) [8], we
introduced a novel and exploratory approach to further
investigate the influence of compliance. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study applying this statistical
approach. Compliance was assessed with the following
question: ‘‘Did you perform the ‘11? Kids’ programme as
suggested in the manual?’’ (answer: yes/no). We have
chosen this ‘simple’ approach because of feasibility for the
coaches. Based on the experience with our previous large-
scale epidemiological study [4, 5], we knew that it would be
critical to keep coaches’ time expenses as low as possible to
avoid additional dropout. Detailed questions about pro-
gramme utilisation (e.g. asking whether each of the seven
exercises have been performed with the correct number of
repetitions and with the correct technique) might have been
too complex and time consuming for many coaches.
We observed a wide spectrum of programme utilisation
(i.e. ranging from 0.3 to 2.9 sessions per week). These data
do not indicate an artificially high compliance (i.e. due to
social desirability bias) and therefore appear to be plausi-
ble. Hence, we are confident that coaches reported honestly
whether they actually used the intervention programme or
not.
5.3 Comparison to Other Studies
The overall reduction of injuries in the present study is
similar to studies in older football players, and in other youth
team sports [14]. From a ‘public health’ perspective, it has
been argued that injury prevention should focus on different
aspects: the most common, the most severe, the most
debilitating or the most costly injuries [14, 36]. The reduc-
tion in severe injuries was even higher compared with studies
in older athletes [14]. The reduction in lower extremity
injuries (55%) was similar to other studies [14, 37].
Remarkable injury reductions have been observed in
several studies focusing on specific types of injuries [14].
Furthermore, in the study at hand, some specific subgroups
of injuries regarding location (knee, ankle, thigh and
hip/groin injuries), type (joint/ligament, muscle injuries,
traumatic fractures and overuse-related complaints) and
mechanism (running/jumping, overuse/growth and colli-
sion-related injuries) showed low HRs. The corresponding
95% CIs for the HRs of the latter subgroups are mostly too
wide to draw firm conclusions. The magnitude-based
inferences, however, indicate ‘likely beneficial’ interven-
tion effects.
Compliance has shown to be important regarding exer-
cise-based injury prevention, as beneficial effects were
greater in players with higher compliance to the pro-
gramme [16, 38, 39]. We also observed that injury inci-
dence was reduced with increased compliance. The effects
are comparable to those observed in female youth football
players (13–17 years of age) [38].
The survey among INT coaches revealed that the quality
of the ‘11? Kids’ manual and the feasibility of the pro-
gramme were rated high. The time requirement has been
rated as being just reasonable. Time constraints and a
perceived inappropriateness of the exercises have been
discussed as potential barriers that might lead to low
compliance [38].
5.4 Practical Relevance of the Study
Playing football can induce considerable health benefits,
and thus, football has a great potential to support a healthy
lifestyle from a young age onwards [40, 41]. Injuries have
been reported to be one of the most relevant reasons to drop
out from sport participation [42]. Successful injury pre-
vention can reduce the number of dropouts, apart from
providing the obvious (and direct) health benefits of stay-
ing injury free. Thus, injury prevention can support chil-
dren achieving higher physical activity levels with all its
positive health effects as it allows for more consistent sport
participation [43, 44]. Negative health consequences are
not limited to the short term. The early development of
osteoarthritis is one example of a harmful long-term effect
[45, 46]. It can reasonably be assumed that early injury
prevention may support long-term health benefits. There-
fore, it is recommended to implement injury prevention in
football starting at a young age.

 5.5 Future Research
Future studies might investigate the effectiveness of the
programme in a large-scale day-to-day application. Fur-
ther, the transferability of ‘11? Kids’ to other (team) sports
should be explored [47]. Last, but not least, the cost
effectiveness (cost of application in relation to the reduc-
tion of healthcare costs) should be analysed in subsequent
studies.
6 Conclusion
The new warm-up programme ‘11? Kids’ has proven
efficacious in reducing injury rates in children’s football by
almost 50%. The more frequently players performed
‘11? Kids’ (i.e. higher compliance), the greater was the
observed injury
reduction. The warm-up
programme
should be used at least once per week; however, two ses-
sions per week are recommended to further increase the
protective benefit. Coaches rated the quality of the
‘11? Kids’ manual and the feasibility of the programme
high, and the time requirement as being just reasonable.
‘11? Kids’ should be implemented on a large scale to
reduce injuries and their potential negative effects on sport
participation and long-term health.
