ABSTRACT
Aberrations of the cell cycle are pervasive in cancer, and
selective cell cycle inhibition of cancer cells is a target of
choice for a number of novel cancer therapeutics. Cyclin-
dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulatory enzymes that
control cell cycle transitions and the commitment to cell divi-
sion. Palbociclib and ribociclib are both orally active, highly
selective reversible inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6 that are
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer in combi-
nation with specific endocrine therapies. A third oral CDK4/6
inhibitor, abemaciclib, received Breakthrough Therapy desig-
nation status from the FDA and is also being developed in
breast cancer. The most common adverse events associated
with palbociclib and ribociclib are hematologic, particularly
neutropenia.
However, the
neutropenia
associated
with
CDK4/6 inhibitors is distinct from chemotherapy-induced neu-
tropenia in that it is rapidly reversible, reflecting a cytostatic
effect on neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow. Most
hematologic abnormalities seen with CDK4/6 inhibitors are
not complicated and are adequately managed with standard
supportive care and dose adjustments when indicated. Cyto-
penias are less prevalent with abemaciclib, although fatigue
and gastrointestinal toxicity is more common with this agent.
This review focuses on the clinical management of potential
toxicities and drug interactions seen with the use of CDK4/6
inhibitors in breast cancer, with a focus on palbociclib and
ribociclib, and summarizes practical management strategies
for an oncologist. The Oncologist 2017;22:1039–1048
Implications for Practice: The emergence of modern cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors has changed the treatment paradigm
for metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. Palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib are highly selective reversible
inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6. Palbociclib is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved in the first- and second-line settings
in combination with endocrine therapy for HR-positive metastatic breast cancer. Ribociclib is FDA-approved in the first-line setting.
Abemaciclib has received FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation status. This review focuses on the clinical management of
potential toxicities and drug interactions seen with the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer.
INTRODUCTION
At a fundamental level, abnormal cellular division and migration
represents the hallmark of cancer. Cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDKs), including CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6, are key regulatory
enzymes that control cell cycle transitions and the commitment to
cell division [1–4]. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and CDK6 regulate
the transition from the G1 to S phase, CDK2 regulates transition
through the S phase, and CDK1 regulates the transition from the
G2 to the M phase [5]. In animals and humans, much of the con-
trol over cell cycle entry is determined by CDK4 and CDK6 [6, 7].
Transition from G1 to the S phase, a critical phase in cell
division, is controlled by the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma
(Rb) protein [8]. Retinoblastoma is a key negative regulator of
the cell cycle because it prevents premature cell division by
binding the E2F transcription factors to inhibit G1/S transition
[8]. Inactivation of Rb, which occurs via sequential phosphoryla-
tion of the protein, allows cellular division to proceed [9]. Dur-
ing G1, growth signals allow cyclin D to complex with either
CDK4 or CDK6, leading to phosphorylation of Rb, which

Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and CDK6, both serine/threo-
nine kinases, are structurally related proteins with many bio-

and

similarities
[6].
In
terms
of
therapeutics, CDK4 and CDK6 are considered functionally
equivalent in their ability to phosphorylate Rb, and inhibition of
both kinases is likewise of considerable interest [10]. This
review will focus on clinical management of potential toxicities
and drug interactions seen with the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in
breast cancer and summarize practical management strategies
for an oncologist.
Dysregulation of the CDK4/6–Rb pathway in breast
cancer
The CDK4/6–Rb axis is critical to cell cycle entry, and therefore
it is to be expected that the vast majority of cancers disrupt this
axis to promote growth [2, 11]. The majority of estrogen
receptor-positive (ER1) and human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancers maintain functioning
Rb, and, potentially, susceptibility to CDK4/6 inhibitors [12–14].
Cyclin D1 amplification occurs in an estimated 15% of breast
cancers, particularly ER1 breast cancer [15]. Loss of proteins in
the INK4 and Cip/Kip families, as well as amplification of CDK4
and CDK6, have also been noted in breast cancer [16, 17]. In
particular, in ER1 breast cancer, estrogen has been shown to
increase the rate of progression from the G1 to the S phase,
where the estrogen effector is the cyclin D1-CDK4/6–Rb com-
plex [18–20]. Binding of estrogen to ER-alpha drives cyclin D1
transcription, with activation of CDK4/6 and phosphorylation
of Rb leading to subsequent cell cycling [21–23]. Similarly,
HER2-induced cellular proliferation is mediated via the CDK4/
6–Rb axis, and knockdown of cyclin-D in mice makes them
resistant to tumors induced by the neu oncogene [24].
CDK4/6 Inhibitor Development in Breast Cancer
The development of selective inhibitors of both CDK4 and
CDK6 has markedly changed the perception of CDKs as thera-
peutic targets in cancer after underwhelming results and unac-
ceptable toxicity were seen with pan-CDK inhibitors such as
flavopiridol (alvocidib) in the early 2000s [17]. Palbociclib is an
orally active pyridopyrimidine that is a potent first-in-class,
highly selective reversible inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 [25]. As
expected based on the biology of the G1–S transition, the
effects of palbociclib are dependent on the presence of a func-
tional Rb protein, and no activity was seen in Rb-deficient cells
[10, 25]. Parallel drug discovery efforts resulted in the develop-
ment of the drugs abemaciclib and ribociclib [26–31]. Abemaci-
clib and ribociclib are both orally bioavailable highly selective
small molecule reversible inhibitors of CDK4/6. The selectivity
of all three compounds is theorized to reflect binding to the
specialized ATP-binding pocket of CDK4 and CDK6 with specific
interactions with residues in the ATP-binding cleft [17].

 Finn and colleagues tested palbociclib in vitro on molecularly
characterized human breast cancer cell lines and found that sen-
sitivity to palbociclib varied based on molecular phenotype.
Estrogen receptor-positive cell lines with luminal features were
found to be the most sensitive and basal cell lines were found
to be resistant [32]. The combination of palbociclib with tamoxi-
fen was tested in vitro in ER1 human breast cancer cell lines
and demonstrated a synergistic interaction [32]. Similar to
results seen with tamoxifen, the combination of palbociclib and
trastuzumab was synergistic in sensitive HER2-amplified cell lines
[32]. Furthermore, combination studies carried out in cell lines
and primary tumor explants have illustrated that CDK4/6 inhibi-
tion with palbociclib provides a complementary mechanism of
action to ado-trastuzumab emtansine, and efficiently suppresses
the proliferation of residual HER2-positive tumor cell populations
that survive ado-trastuzumab emtansine [33]. These preclinical
observations led to the development of several clinical trials
evaluating the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine
therapy, and, more recently, with HER2-directed therapies.
Clinical Experience
Select phase II and phase III studies of CDK4/6 inhibitors in
breast cancer are outlined in Table 1.
Palbociclib
Early trials studying palbociclib in advanced solid tumors demon-
strated encouraging results in breast cancer [34, 40, 41]. The
PALOMA-1 trial was the basis for the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) granting palbociclib accelerated approval in Feb-
ruary 2015 after it had received Breakthrough Therapy
designation in April 2013 [42]. In this trial, 165 previously
untreated patients with metastatic HR-positive/HER2-negative
breast cancer were randomized to palbociclib plus letrozole or
letrozole alone. Palbociclib significantly increased progression-
free survival (PFS) compared with letrozole alone, with a median
PFS of 10.2 months for the letrozole group and 20.2 months for
the palbociclib plus letrozole group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.488;
one-sided p< .001) [35]. A phase 3 confirmatory trial, PALOMA-
2 (NCT01942135), confirmed these findings with a median PFS
of 24.8 versus 14.5 months, respectively, for patients treated
with palbociclib or placebo in addition to letrozole (HR 0.58;
p< .001) [36]. Initial overall survival (OS) results from PALOMA-
1 demonstrate a statistically non-significant trend towards an
improvement in OS in the palbociclib group (37.5 months vs.
33.3 months, respectively, HR 0.837, p5 .280) [44].
The PALOMA-3 trial was a double-blind placebo-controlled,
randomized, phase 3 study of palbociclib added to the ER
down-regulator fulvestrant in previously treated HR-positive,
HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients [37]. Both pre-
and postmenopausal women were included in the study. The
addition of palbociclib improved the median PFS as compared
with fulvestrant alone, from 4.6 months to 9.5 months (HR
0.46; p< .001) [37, 38]. Based on these results, the FDA also
approved palbociclib for use in combination with fulvestrant for
disease progression following endocrine therapy. A number of
ongoing studies are exploring palbociclib in a number of disease
settings for breast cancer, including adjuvant and neoadjuvant
studies, and in combination with other targeted agents [43].

August 2016 and full approval in March 2017 based primarily

 on the phase III MONALEESA-2 (NCT01958021) trial exploring
ribociclib in combination with letrozole as first-line therapy in
women with HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast can-
cer [44]. The trial met its primary endpoint, with the median
duration of PFS not reached in the ribociclib group (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 19.3 to not reached) versus 14.7 months
(95% CI, 13.0–16.5) in the placebo group (HR, 0.56; 95% CI,
0.43–0.72; p5 3.29 3 1026 for superiority) [44]. For HR-posi-
tive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, MONALEESA-7
(NCT02278120) is a phase 3 study exploring ribociclib in combi-
nation with endocrine therapy (plus the gonadotropin-
releasing
hormone
agonist

in
premenopausal
women, and MONALEESA-3 (NCT02422615) is a phase 3 study
in men and postmenopausal women exploring fulvestrant with
or without ribociclib in both the first- and/or second-line meta-
static setting. A number of other ongoing studies are exploring
ribociclib in various disease settings for breast cancer and in
combination with other targeted agents [43].
Abemaciclib
Abemaciclib received FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation in
October 2015. Among heavily pretreated HR-positive breast
cancer patients (n 5 47) enrolled in a phase 1 study of abema-
ciclib monotherapy, the overall response rate was 31%, with
61% of patients achieving either response or stable disease last-
ing �6 months [45]. This study suggested abemaciclib may
have benefit as monotherapy [45]. In the phase 2 single-arm
study, MONARCH 1 (NCT02102490), women with metastatic
HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer with disease progres-
sion following both antiestrogen therapy and at least one, but
no more than two, lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic set-
ting, received abemaciclib as monotherapy [39]. The confirmed
objective response rate was 19.7% and median PFS was 6.0
months [39]. The MONARCH 3 (NCT02246621) and MONARCH
2 (NCT02107703) trials are both large phase 3, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trials further evaluating the
combination of abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy. Recent
results from MONARCH 2 exploring the addition of abemaciclib
to fulvestrant demonstrated a median PFS of 16.4 months for
abemaciclib plus fulvestrant compared with 9.3 months in the
placebo plus fulvestrant group (HR: 0.553; p< .001) [40].
Pharmacology and Dosing Schedule
Palbociclib
In all three PALOMA trials, palbociclib was dosed at 125 mg
daily for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off based on earlier work
determining the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) [40, 41].
The recommended initial dose of palbociclib is a 125 mg cap-
sule taken orally once daily, with food, for 21 consecutive days,
followed by 7 days off treatment, constituting a total cycle of
28 days [46]. Absorption and drug exposure were found to be
low in the fasted state in a portion of the population, which
was increased when administered with food. Therefore, taking
palbociclib on an empty stomach could reduce drug levels and
may compromise effectiveness in a subset of patients [46]. The
FDA approval for palbociclib for first-line treatment of meta-
static HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer was initially in
combination with letrozole 2.5 mg once daily, but has been
updated to include any of the three approved aromatase inhibi-
tors (letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane) [48].
Absorption and drug exposure were found to be low
in the fasted state in a portion of the population,
which was increased when administered with food.
Therefore, taking palbociclib on an empty stomach
could reduce drug levels and may compromise effec-
tiveness in a subset of patients.
In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that palbociclib under-
goes hepatic metabolism in humans and is primarily metabo-
lized by CYP3A and sulfotransferase (SULT) enzyme SULT2A1
[46]. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors should be
avoided, but if patients must be coadministered a strong
CYP3A inhibitor, the recommendation is to reduce the palboci-
clib dose to 75 mg once daily [46]. If the strong inhibitor is dis-
continued, the dose of palbociclib can be increased (after 3–5
half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initia-
tion of the strong CYP3A inhibitor [46]. Additionally, coadminis-
tration of a strong CYP3A inducer (rifampin) decreased the
plasma exposure of palbociclib in healthy subjects by 85%, and
therefore it is recommended to avoid coadministration of
strong CYP3A inducers [46]. In vivo, palbociclib is a weak, time-
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A. Lastly, the dose of a sensitive
CYP3A substrate with a narrow therapeutic index may need to
be reduced because palbociclib could increase its exposure
(Table 2) [46].
Ribociclib
The recommended initial dose of ribociclib is 600 mg taken
orally once daily (preferably in the morning) for 21 consecutive
days, followed by 7 days off treatment, constituting a total cycle
of 28 days [46]. Absorption is not affected by food; therefore, it
may be taken with or without food.The FDA approval for riboci-
clib for first-line treatment of metastatic HR-positive/HER2-neg-
ative breast cancer is in combination with any of the three
approved aromatase inhibitors (letrozole, anastrozole, or
exemestane), which are given continuously throughout the 28-
day cycle [48].
Ribociclib undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, the
majority of which is mediated by CYP3A4. As such, its elimina-
tion may be affected by CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers [48, 49].
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided
and alternative therapy should be sought. If a strong CYP3A
inhibitor must be used concomitantly with ribococlib, the dose
of ribociclib should be reduced to 400 mg once daily. If the
strong inhibitor is discontinued, the dose of ribociclib should be
increased (after 5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used
prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor [48]. Con-
comitant use of strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided
because plasma exposure of ribociclib was decreased by 89%
with coadministration of rifampin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) in
healthy volunteers [48]. Ribociclib also inhibits CYP3A4 in a
time-dependent manner and is a reversible CYP1A2 inhibitor
[48]. Concomitant use of CYP3A substrates with a narrow ther-
apeutic index should be done with caution, and may require a
dose reduction of the CYP3A substrate, as ribociclib could
increase their exposure [48].

 Abemaciclib
Dosing for abemaciclib is 200 mg every 12 hours, given continu-
ously throughout the cycle [45]. Abemaciclib undergoes exten-
sive hepatic metabolism in humans. In vitro and in vivo studies
have identified CYP3A as the enzyme responsible for the major-
ity of the CYP-mediated metabolism of abemaciclib and its
metabolites [50]. This suggests that concomitant use of strong
CYP3A
inducers
or
inhibitors
should
be
avoided
with
abemaciclib.
CDK4/6 Inhibitor Toxicity Overview
Palbociclib
In PALOMA-1, the most common adverse events reported for
the palbociclib plus letrozole group were neutropenia, leukope-
nia, and fatigue. Overall, 27 (33%) patients in the palbociclib
plus letrozole group had dose interruptions because of adverse
events, compared with only three (4%) patients in the letrozole
group. Adverse events in the PALOMA-2 trial are outlined in
Table 3. In PALOMA-3, the most common adverse events
reported for the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group were
neutropenia, leukopenia, fatigue, and nausea [37]. Overall, nine
(2.6%) patients in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group discon-
tinued therapy due to adverse events, compared with three
(1.7%) patients in the fulvestrant group.
Ribociclib
As with palbociclib, hematologic adverse events, including neu-
tropenia, are common with ribociclib; therefore, a 1-week rest-
ing period is incorporated into dosing regimens in most trials,
although continuous dosing continues to be explored [17, 43].
In MONALEESA-2, the most common adverse events of any
grade were neutropenia, nausea, infections, fatigue, and diar-
rhea (Table 3) [44]. The majority of the non-hematologic
adverse events were grade 1 or 2 [44]. The most common
grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia, leukopenia,
hypertension, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level,
lymphopenia, and increased asparatate aminotransferase (AST)
level [44]. An increase of more than 60 msec from baseline in
the Fridericia’s correction formula (QTcF) interval occurred in
nine patients (2.7%) in the ribociclib group, and 11 patients

 (3.3%) had at least one average QTcF interval of more than 480
msec after baseline [44]. No cases of Torsades de Pointes were
reported in MONALEESA-2 [44].
Abemaciclib
Abemaciclib is structurally distinct from palbociclib and riboci-
clib, demonstrating greater selectivity for CDK4 compared with
CDK6 [29]. Hematologic adverse events, including neutropenia,
appear to be less common with abemaciclib, while fatigue and
gastrointestinal-related toxicity are more predominant [17].
The most common treatment-related adverse events in the
MONARCH 1 (NCT02102490) study of abemaciclib monother-
apy in women with pretreated metastatic HR-positive/HER2-
negative breast cancer were creatinine increase (98.5%; grade
35 0.8%), diarrhea (90.2%; grade 35 19.7%), neutropenia
(87.7%;
grade
3/4
26.9%),
and
fatigue
(65.2%;
grade
35 12.9%) [39]. Abemaciclib-induced diarrhea was managea-
ble with conventional antidiarrheal agents or dose reduction
[39]. Diarrhea was experienced early on (median time to
onset5 7 days) and generally resolved quickly (median dura-
tion of grade 2 5 7.5 days, grade 35 4.5 days). Regarding the
creatinine increase, abemaciclib is a competitive inhibitor of
efflux transporters of creatinine (OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K);
therefore, cystatin C calculated glomerular fraction rate was
performed to more accurately assess renal function, and this
was not raised [39]. In general, dose interruptions and adjust-
ments are typically considered for grade 3 or higher toxicities.
Practical Management Strategies for Palbociclib and
Ribociclib Toxicities
Palbociclib and Ribociclib: Hematologic Adverse Events
and Management
Hematologic adverse events are common with CDK4/6 inhibi-
tors. Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 is particularly important in pro-
moting the proliferation of hematological precursors, and its
inhibition is an on-target effect that results in the cytopenias
seen with CDK4/6 inhibition [52, 53]. In general, most hemato-
logic abnormalities seen with CDK4/6 inhibitors can be
adequately managed with standard supportive care [40].
A few considerations related to CDK4/6-induced neutrope-
nia should be noted. First, although neutropenia is a common
side effect of cytotoxic agents, the neutropenia associated with
CDK4/6 inhibitors is distinct in that it is rapidly reversible, reflect-
ing a cytostatic effect on neutrophil precursors in the bone mar-
row
[17].
Recent
work
to
explore
the
mechanism
of
hematologic toxicity induced by palbociclib utilized human bone
marrow mononuclear cells to demonstrate that palbociclib-
induced bone marrow suppression occurred through cycle
arrest with no apoptosis at clinically relevant concentrations and
resumed proliferation following palbociclib withdrawal, thereby
demonstrating pharmacologic quiescence [54]. In contrast,
exposure of the same cells to chemotherapeutic agents resulted
in apoptotic cell death [54]. Accordingly, palbociclib and riboci-
clib are dosed intermittently to accommodate a break for hema-
tological recovery. Second, while neutropenia is a common
adverse event, the incidence of febrile neutropenia is very low
(0% in PALOMA-1, 0.6% in PALOMA-3, 1.5% in MONALEESA-2).
Third, the median duration of grade �3/4 neutropenia is around
7 days, and typically resolves with drug hold [55]. Fourth, neu-
tropenia is proportional to exposure, and often decreases with
subsequent cycles, suggesting a lack of cumulative toxicity and
effective early dose reductions when indicated.
Complete blood count (CBC) with differential needs to be
monitored for all patients on CDK4/6 inhibitors. For palbociclib
and ribociclib, it is recommended to check a CBC with differen-
tial at baseline and every 2 weeks for the first two cycles. For
palbociclib, it is recommended to then check prior to each 28-
day cycle and as clinically indicated. For ribociclib, it is recom-
mended to check at the beginning of each subsequent four
cycles, and then as clinically indicated. Palbociclib and ribociclib
should be held at an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than
1,000/mm3 (grade 3) on the first day of each cycle. Further
details on managing day 1 and day 15 neutropenia are included
in Figure 2. Neutropenia is considered complicated if it is asso-
ciated with a documented infection or fever (typically greater
than or equal to 38.58C/100.48F). Criteria for retreatment with
palbociclib or ribociclib following treatment interruption for
neutropenia has generally been when the ANC is greater than
1,000/mm3 with no fever. Management of palbociclib- and

 ribociclib-induced neutropenia is outlined in Figure 2. In
PALOMA-3, if a patient was already receiving palbociclib 75 mg
per day and required another dose reduction, 75 mg daily on a
2 weeks on, 2 weeks off schedule could be utilized [56]. For
grade 3 (<50,000–25,000/mm3) and grade 4 (<25,000 mm3)
thrombocytopenia, treatment was held until recovery to
50,000/mm3 and resumed at one dose level lower. If recurrent
grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia occurred, or if recovery of pla-
telet count to 50,000/mm3 took greater than 2 weeks, two
dose reductions were instituted [56]. Similarly, for grade 3
(hemoglobin <8.0 g/dL) and grade 4 (life-threatening conse-
quences; urgent intervention indicated) anemia, treatment
should be held until improvement to grade 2 (hemoglobin
<10.0–8.0 g/dL) or better and resumed at one dose level
lower. Packed red blood cell transfusions should be per institu-
tional protocol.
Palbociclib and Ribociclib: Gastrointestinal Adverse
Events and Management
Nausea and diarrhea can occur with the use of palbociclib and
ribociclib, although rates of grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal toxic-
ities are low (Table 3). Palbociclib and ribociclib both carry a
minimal to low emetic risk, thus prophylactic antiemetics are
not routinely indicated [57]. Nausea and vomiting should be
treated with routine antiemetics, such as metoclopramide, pro-
chlorperazine, haloperidol, or serotonin 5-HT3 antagonists on
an as-needed basis [57]. Caution should be taken when
coprescribing antiemetics with ribociclib due to the risk of QT
prolongation. In the absence of signs of infection, diarrhea can
be safely managed with standard non-pharmacologic (hydra-
tion, dietary modification, avoidance of other offending agents)
and pharmacologic (anti-diarrheal agents such as loperamide,
deodorized tincture of opium, diphenoxylate/atropine, octreo-
tide) interventions [58]. Prophylactic treatment can be consid-
ered for more significant diarrhea.
Nausea and vomiting should be treated with routine
antiemetics, such as metoclopramide, prochlorpera-
zine, haloperidol, or serotonin 5-HT3 antagonists on an
as-needed basis. Caution should be taken when copre-
scribing antiemetics with ribociclib due to the risk of
QT prolongation.
Other Toxicities: General Management
In general, for non-hematologic toxicities, no dose hold or dose
adjustment are required for grade 1 or 2 toxicities unless they
are persistent and bothersome to the patient. For grade 3 or
higher toxicities that persist despite medical treatment, palbo-
ciclib and ribociclib should be held until symptoms resolve
either to grade 1 or less, or to grade 2 if not considered a safety

 risk for the patient. Palbociclib and ribociclib should then be
resumed at the next lower dose.
Palbociclib: Other Toxicities
A variety of other non-hematologic and non-gastrointestinal
events have been reported with palbociclib, although the vast
majority are grade 1–2 (Table 3).The other most common toxic-
ity seen with palbociclib is fatigue, which is often mild [37].
Thromboembolic events have rarely been reported with palbo-
ciclib, although it is notably listed as precaution in the prescrib-
ing information. In PALOMA-1, two patients (0.6%) had a non-
serious event, and four patients (1.2%) had a serious event
(three pulmonary emboli and one deep-vein thrombosis) in the
palbociclib plus fulvestrant group, versus none in the fulves-
trant alone group [37]. Also, palbociclib may cause embryo-
fetal toxicity and effective contraception is recommended [46].
While typically grade 1, the possibility of alopecia is notable,
with grade 1 alopecia seen in 33% of patients in the palbociclib
group compared with 16% in the letrozole alone group in
PALOMA-2. As noted above, dose hold and subsequent dose
decrease are typically considered for grade 3 or higher
toxicities.
Ribociclib: Other Toxicities
Fatigue, transaminase elevation, and QTc prolongation are
other notable toxicities reported with ribociclib [44, 48]. Riboci-
clib prolongs the QT interval in a concentration-dependent
manner. A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) should demon-
strate a QTcF of less than 450 msec prior to initiating therapy.
Patients that have or are at a significant risk of developing QTc
prolongation should not receive ribociclib. The QT interval
should be assessed via ECG at baseline, approximately day 14,
the beginning of cycle two, and then as clinically necessary.
Avoidance of QT-prolonging agents, as well as appropriate sup-
plementation for electrolyte abnormalities, is recommended.
Serum electrolytes should be monitored at baseline, prior to
the first six cycles, and as clinically indicated.
Ribociclib has been associated with hepatobiliary toxicity,
manifesting as transaminase (AST and/or ALT) elevation. Liver
function tests (LFTs) should be checked at baseline, every 2
weeks for the first two cycles, prior to each subsequent four
cycles, and as clinically indicated thereafter. More frequent
monitoring is recommended in the setting of grade �2
abnormalities. Treatment modifications for hepatobiliary toxic-
ity are outlined in Table 4. Similar to palbociclib, alopecia is pos-
sible with ribociclib and is typically grade 1. Ribociclib may
cause embryo-fetal toxicity and effective contraception is rec-
ommended [50].
Palbociclib and Ribociclib: Surgical Procedures
Count nadir should be avoided at the time of surgery. For pal-
bociclib, it is recommended that patients pursuing surgery hold
therapy for 7 days before the surgery and up to 3 weeks follow-
ing surgery, based on wound healing and recovery. Palbociclib
can be resumed once satisfactory wound healing and recovery
have occurred. Patients should continue endocrine therapy if
palbociclib is held for surgery. There are no specific recommen-
dations for ribociclib surrounding surgery, although we recom-
mend following a similar algorithm to that outlined for
palbociclib.
Dose Adjustments for Palbociclib
Following dose interruption, the palbociclib dose may need to
be reduced when treatment is resumed. The first dose reduc-
tion is to 100 mg/day and the second and final dose reduction
is to 75 mg/day. Once a dose has been reduced for a given
patient, dose re-escalation should typically be avoided. No spe-
cific dose adjustments are needed for geriatric use, mild
hepatic impairment, or mild to moderate renal impairment.
Palbociclib has not been studied in patients with moderate or
severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 3 ULN and any
AST) or in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/
min). Minimal drug is recovered in the urine, suggesting renal
impairment would not significantly impact drug levels. A study
of palbociclib in renal impairment has been completed, with
results pending (NCT02085538).
Dose Adjustments for Ribociclib
The dose of ribociclib may need to be reduced following dose
interruption for toxicity. The first dose reduction is to 400 mg/
day and the second dose reduction is to 200 mg/day. Ribociclib
should be discontinued if a dose reduction below 200 mg/day
is required. Dose re-escalation is typically not recommended
following modification. Ribociclib is commercially available as
200 mg tablets. No specific dose adjustments are needed for
geriatric use, mild hepatic impairment, or mild to moderate

 renal impairment. The recommended starting dose is 400 mg/
day for patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-
Pugh C) hepatic impairment.The impact of severe renal impair-
ment (CrCl <30 mL/min) on ribociclib is unknown; however,
the renal route contributes to only a small portion of ribociclib
elimination. A study of ribociclib in healthy patients with vari-
ous degrees of renal impairment is currently recruiting partici-
pants (NCT02431481).
CONCLUSION
CDK4/6 inhibitors are generally well-tolerated oral agents. Pal-
bociclib is currently approved for the first-line treatment of
metastatic HR-positive breast cancer in combination with letro-
zole and in the second-line setting in combination with fulves-
trant. Ribociclib is approved for the first-line treatment of
metastatic HR-positive breast cancer in combination with any
aromatase inhibitor. Abemaciclib has been granted Break-
through Therapy designation by the FDA. The most common
adverse event associated with palbociclib and ribociclib is neu-
tropenia; however, febrile neutropenia is rare and the neutro-
penia is generally easily reversible when the drug is held.
Ribociclib is associated with hepatobiliary toxicity and QT pro-
longation,
requiring
additional
monitoring
and
dose
modification. Gastrointestinal toxicity and fatigue are more
prevalent with abemaciclib. Additional research is needed to
better understand the toxicity profile and develop manage-
ment strategies to minimize drug interruptions to optimize the
highest possible therapeutic efficacy for patients with breast
cancer.
