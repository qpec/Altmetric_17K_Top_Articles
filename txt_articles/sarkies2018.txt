Background
Allied health services, medicine and nursing are considered to
comprise three pillars of the healthcare system.1 Allied health
professionals provide diagnostic and therapeutic services across
different settings,2and represent a large proportion of the healthcare
workforce internationally.3,4 Allied health is often organised and
managed in professional groups, including physiotherapy, psychol-
ogy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, dietetics, podiatry, and
social work, within an over-riding inter-professional comprehensive
care model.5,6
The routine provision of weekend allied health services is
variable across hospitals both in Australia and worldwide. For
example, a survey of tertiary care hospitals in Canada reported that

Question: Are additional weekend allied health services effective and cost-effective for acute general
medical and surgical wards, and subacute rehabilitation hospital wards? Design: Systematic review and
meta-analysis of studies published between January 2000 and May 2017. Two reviewers independently
screened studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. Meta-analyses were
conducted for relative measures of effect estimates. Participants: Patients admitted to acute general
medical and surgical wards, and subacute rehabilitation wards. Intervention: All services delivered by
allied health professionals during weekends (Saturday and/or Sunday). This study limited allied health
professions to: occupational therapy, physiotherapy, social work, speech pathology, dietetics, art therapy,
chiropractic, exercise physiology, music therapy, oral health (not dentistry), osteopathy, podiatry,
psychology, and allied health assistants. Outcome measures: Hospital length of stay, hospital
re-admission, adverse events, discharge destination, functional independence, health-related quality
of life, and cost of hospital care. Results: Nineteen articles (20 studies) were identified, comprising
10 randomised and 10 non-randomised trials. Physiotherapy was the most commonly investigated
profession. A meta-analysis of randomised, controlled trials showed that providing additional weekend
allied health services in subacute rehabilitation wards reduced hospital length of stay by 2.35 days (95%
CI 0.45 to 4.24, I2 = 0%), and may be a cost-effective way to improve function (SMD 0.09, 95% CI –0.01 to
0.19, I2 = 0%), and health-related quality of life (SMD 0.10, 95% CI –0.01 to 0.20, I2 = 0%). For acute general
medical and surgical hospital wards, it was unclear whether the weekend allied health service model
provided in the two identified randomised trials led to significant changes in measured outcomes.
Conclusion: The benefit of providing additional allied health services is clearer in subacute rehabilitation
settings than for acute general medical and surgical wards in hospitals. Registration: PROSPERO

 97% of facilities provided routine weekend physiotherapy services,
with diversity in the amount and focus of service delivery.7 In
Australia, 61% of hospitals routinely provided physiotherapy on
Saturdays, and 45% on Sundays, with more provided in metropoli-
tan and acute hospitals than regional and subacute hospitals.8
Aside from physiotherapy, comparatively little is known about the
practices of other allied health professions. The evidence about the
effects of providing these services during weekends is unclear.
Providing earlier,9,10 additional,11–13 or higher intensity14 allied
health services can improve health outcomes. However, it is
unclear whether these benefits occur when weekend allied health
staffing models are used to deliver additional services on a routine
basis.15 The provision of allied health services on weekends incurs
more cost and logistical difficulty than during traditional business
hours, with uncertainty around the experience of staff, appropri-
ateness of referrals, and whether the mix of professions achieves
the intended benefits.16
The aim of this review was to synthesise the available evidence
examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of providing
additional weekend allied health services to patients on acute
general medical and surgical hospital wards, and subacute
rehabilitation hospital wards.
Therefore, the research question for this systematic review was:
Are additional weekend allied health services effective and
cost-effective for acute general medical and surgical wards, and
subacute rehabilitation hospital wards?
Methods
This 
systematic 
review was 
conducted and 
reported in
accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.17
Identification and selection of studies
Ovid 
MEDLINE 
(all 
fields), 
PubMed 
(all 
fields), 
CINAHL
(keyword, title, CINAHL subject headings, abstract, and instru-
mentation fields), Cochrane library (title, abstract, keywords), and
Scopus (title, abstract, keywords) were searched for articles
published between 1 January 2000 to 5 May 2017 to retrieve
contemporary literature. Terms relevant to the population and
intervention were combined and results were limited to English-
language publications. See Appendix 1 on the eAddenda for the full
search strategy. Electronic database searches were supplemented
by cross-checking the reference list of included articles and
relevant systematic reviews identified during the screening
process. Publication lists from key authors in the field were also
hand searched to identify additional studies. A web-based
applicationa was used for reference management.18
The inclusion criteria for the review are presented in Box 1. For
the purposes of this review, acute general medical and surgical
wards 
included: 
general 
medical, 
general 
surgical, 
medical
assessment unit, orthopaedic, vascular, plastics, ear nose and
throat, thoracic, respiratory, coronary care unit, renal, rheumatol-
ogy, neurology (including stroke units), infectious diseases,
colorectal, endocrine, urological, and gastroenterology. Excluded
acute wards were emergency department, intensive care unit, high
dependency unit, burns, spinal, maternity, paediatrics, mental
health, and palliative care. These wards were excluded because the
allied health role was considered to be potentially different in
these settings compared to acute general medical and surgical
wards. For the purposes of this study, subacute rehabilitation
wards included inpatient rehabilitation (both mixed and condi-
tion-specific wards), and geriatric evaluation and management
wards. Excluded subacute wards comprised mental health and
psychiatric, chronic and long-term care, alternative level of care,
and extended care patients. The goals of care on these wards were
considered to be different to those on inpatient rehabilitation and
geriatric evaluation and management wards.
Interventions focused upon in this review included all services
delivered by allied health professionals during weekends (Satur-
day and/or Sunday). This study limited allied health professions to:
occupational therapy, physiotherapy, social work, speech patholo-
gy, dietetics, art therapy, chiropractic, exercise physiology, music
therapy, oral health (not dentistry), osteopathy, podiatry, psychol-
ogy, and allied health assistants.19 An allied health service not
delivered by an allied health professional or allied health assistant
(eg, nursing staff or self-directed) was not eligible. Weekends were
defined as complementary to the traditional workweek, as per the
country the study was performed in. Studies that reported data
relating to the provision of additional allied health services as part
of changing timing of commencement, intensity, frequency or
duration with a weekend component were included, but only if
data relating specifically to weekend services with appropriate
controls could be extracted.
Two reviewers (MS and JW) screened titles and abstracts
independently against the above criteria. Studies determined to be
potentially eligible were retrieved for full-text review. Two
reviewers (MS and JW) independently assessed the full-text
articles to ascertain eligibility for inclusion. Where there was any
disagreement during the screening, a third independent reviewer
(KH) was consulted. Authors of studies whose full-text article
could not be retrieved were contacted. In the cases of non-
response, these articles were excluded.
Assessment of characteristics of studies
Data were extracted using a customised pro-forma, which was
developed and piloted for this review. One (JW) and either of two
other reviewers (KH or JB) independently extracted data relating to
the study details, design, setting, population, intervention, out-
comes, and results for all included studies. Discrepancies in
extracted data were resolved by discussion. Where agreement
could not be reached, a fourth independent reviewer (MS) was
consulted.
Quality
Two of three reviewers (JW, KH or JB) independently assessed
the risk of bias for randomised, controlled trials using the Cochrane
Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias,20 and the Newcastle-
Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for observational studies.21 Any
discrepancy in the assessments of risk of bias was resolved by

 discussion and, if necessary, consultation of a fourth independent
reviewer (RH).
Participants
To describe the participants in the study, the following data
were extracted from the published report: sample size, age,
country, and ward (acute or subacute).
Intervention
The details extracted about the allied health service from each
included study were: the number of hospitals, wards and/or beds
being covered by the service, where reported; the number of
additional hours of service; and the number and professions of the
allied health staff providing the service. Data about the control
intervention were the number of hours of weekday service, where
reported, and the number and professions of the allied health staff
providing the weekday service.
Outcome measures
The outcomes considered by this review are listed in Box
1. These were intended to cover all patient and health service
outcomes that might be reported in the included studies.
Data analysis
Analysis was performed using Stata 13 softwareb. Relative
measures of effect estimates were pooled according to study
setting and design (separate for acute and subacute settings, and
randomised and non-randomised study designs). Random effect
meta-analysis accounted for differences in populations, interven-
tions and outcomes across studies, and was performed where data
were available for similar outcomes evaluated in more than one
study.
A majority of analyses used summative, study-level data.
Weighted mean difference (WMD) effect size estimates were used
for continuous outcomes, where measurements were reported in
the same units (eg, length of stay and cost). Where measures used
different scales, standardised mean difference (SMD) was used to
estimate effect size for function and health-related quality of life
outcomes. The effect size for SMD was interpreted according to
Cohen’s d, with 0.2 considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 a large
effect size.22 Risk ratios (RR) were used for dichotomous outcomes
(eg, number of adverse events, patients discharged home, and
delayed discharge).
Authors were contacted to request additional data for studies
not reporting sufficient outcome data for inclusion in the meta-
analysis. Data were pooled from subgroups to estimate the total
population effect size where data were only reported according to
subgroups within an individual trial. The proportion of patients
discharged to supported residential aged-care facilities reported in
subgroups according to level of care were summed to create a total
proportion of patients discharged to a supported residential aged
care facility. When two control groups were used for non-
randomised, controlled trials, the first mentioned control group
was selected as the comparator. This applied only to observational
studies where multiple time periods/cohorts were reported within
the study. If study results were reported as medians and range or
interquartile range, and the mean and standard deviation could not
be obtained, means and standard deviation were estimated using
the methods of Wan et al.23 A sensitivity analysis was undertaken
to assess the effect of excluding studies where data were estimated
due to inadequate reporting.
Heterogeneity in study results was represented using the
I-squared statistic (I2), with values > 50% considered substan-
tial.24 An iterative approach was used to explore possible
explanations for heterogeneity by subgrouping studies according
to variables such as allied health profession, patient population,
and potential sources of bias. A formal meta-regression was not
planned due to the anticipated low number of studies for
inclusion in the meta-analysis.
Two of the studies identified and included in this review were
stepped-wedge cluster randomised trials, conducted in succession
at the same research location (hospitals and wards). These were
the only randomised trials identified in the acute setting. Data
available from this study were used at the participant level (for
continuous outcomes) and cluster level (for proportion outcomes)
rather than summative data. This was done to incorporate the
dependency of observations gathered from the same wards
between the two trials. Weighted mean difference (WMD) was
used for continuous outcomes, and risk difference (RD) for
proportional outcomes.
Results
Flow of studies through the review
A total of 3413 titles were identified, with 3405 from the
electronic search strategy and eight from hand searching publica-
tion lists of prominent authors. Duplicates (n = 293) were removed
using Endnote (n = 224) and Covidence (n = 69), resulting in
3120 titles remaining for screening (Figure 1). After title and
abstract screening, 72 records were considered potentially eligible
for inclusion. These were obtained in full text and assessed,
resulting in the inclusion of 19 articles (n = 20 studies) in this
review.25–43 (See Appendix 2 on the eAddenda for a list of the
excluded full-text articles.)

Figure 2. Eight studies reported adequate methods of random
sequence generation.25,27–33 All studies reported adequate alloca-

was not possible in any included studies. Hospital length of stay
was unable to be blinded in any included studies,25–33 although the
stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised trials limited this as a poten-
tial source of bias.25 Risk of bias for selective reporting was
identified in two studies,27,32 with another study reporting further
outcomes to be reported in other publications.25 No other potential
sources of bias were identified for any of the included studies.
For non-randomised, controlled trials assessed using the
Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (Table 1), eight studies
reported adequate methods to control for potential risk of
selection bias,34–36,38,39,41–43 with two studies potentially at risk
of selection bias.37,40 There was adequate reporting of methods to
control for potential risk of comparability bias for all studies. Seven
studies reported adequate methods to control for potential
outcome or exposure risk of bias,34,36,38,39,41–43 with three studies
potentially at risk of outcome bias.35,37,40
Design, setting and participants
Ten randomised, controlled trials (published in nine articles)
evaluated the effect of providing allied health services during
weekends. Two studies were performed in acute general medical
and surgical hospital ward settings.25,44 Eight were within
subacute rehabilitation hospital wards, including mixed patient
groups,26–30 orthopaedic,31 and stroke rehabilitation.32,33 Ten non-
randomised, controlled trials (10 articles) were also identified.
Seven were cohort studies performed in acute general medical and
surgical hospital wards, including orthopaedic,34–37,43 rheumatol-
ogy,38 and stroke.39 Two cohort studies were performed in mixed
rehabilitation subacute hospital wards,40,41 and one cross-section-
al study was conducted in a mixed rehabilitation setting.42 The
majority of studies were performed in Australia (n = 14),25–35,
40,41,43 with one study each in England,38 Canada,42 Japan,39
Singapore,36 and Scotland.37 Study details are presented in Table 2.

 Interventions
Provision of physiotherapy during weekends was the most
examined allied health service (n = 9),26,32–38,40 followed by
combinations 
of: 
physiotherapy 
and 
occupational 
therapy
(n = 7);27–31,39,42 physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and social
work (n = 1);41 and physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech
pathology, dietetics, and social work (n = 3).25,43
Ten studies compared a Monday to Fridayallied health servicewith
a model that incorporated Saturday and Sunday services,25,32–35,
37,38,42,43 eight compared Monday to Friday with a Saturday
service,26–31,40,41 and one compared a Monday to Saturday service
with a Sunday service.39 One study compared a Monday to Friday (no
weekend allied health) service with a ‘new stakeholder driven’
weekend model including Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday
services.25 In this ‘new stakeholder driven service’, weekend services
were distributed across Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Further
details of intervention and control conditions are presented in Table 2.
Effect of additional weekend allied health services

Please cite this article in press as: Sarkies MN, et al. Additional weekend allied health services reduce length of stay in subacute
rehabilitation wards but their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are unclear in acute general medical and surgical hospital wards: a
systematic review. J Physiother. (2018), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphys.2018.05.004
 Figure 3a. When patient diagnosis was taken into account, there
was no difference in the proportion of patients whose hospital
length of stay was longer than their expected length of stay
between intervention and control conditions using cluster-level
data (RD 0.00 days; 95% CI –0.02 to 0.02, I2 = 79%), as shown in
Figure 4. High levels of heterogeneity in the study results were
examined in post-hoc exploratory analysis by Haines et al,25
suggesting that there was a significant change in hospital length of
stay outcomes between control conditions, but when intervention
conditions were compared, there was no significant difference
between patient hospital length of stay outcomes.25
Non-randomised studies and subgroup analyses
These meta-analyses results were somewhat concordant with
those involving non-randomised studies. Meta-analysis (n = 4676)
of six acute non-randomised, controlled trials34–39,43 showed no
effect of providing weekend allied health services on hospital
length of stay (WMD 0.24 days, 95% CI –0.17 to 0.66, I2 = 96%), as
shown in Figure 3b. Heterogeneity levels were reduced when
subgroup analysis of total hip arthroplasty patients was performed
(WMD 0.08 days, 95% CI –0.12 to 0.29, I2 = 24%), which was possible
using data from three studies34,35,37 (Table 4).
Effect on hospital length of stay in the subacute setting
Randomised trials
Meta-analysis 
(n = 1437) 
of 
three randomised, 
controlled
trials26,27,32 conducted in the subacute setting indicated that
weekend allied health services reduced subacute hospital length of
stay (WMD 2.35 days, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.24, I2 = 0.0%), as shown in
Figure 3c.
Non-randomised studies and subgroup analyses
The results from the randomised trials in the subacute setting
were somewhat concordant with non-randomised studies. A
meta-analysis (n = 5012) of three subacute non-randomised,
controlled trials40–42 showed a trend towards reduced hospital
length of stay in favour of weekend allied health provision (WMD
0.49 days, 95% CI –0.87 to 1.85, I2 = 83%), as shown in Figure 3d.
However, high levels of heterogeneity in study results were
observed between studies.
Effect on hospital readmissions in the acute setting
Randomised trials
Meta-analysis (n = 27 508) of cluster-level data from two acute,
stepped-wedge, randomised, controlled trials25 showed no signifi-
cant difference in the proportion of patients who had an unplanned
hospital 
re-admission within 
28 days 
of 
hospital 
discharge
between groups with available and unavailable weekend allied
health services (RD 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.02, I2 = 43%), as shown in
Figure 5.
Non-randomised studies
This was consistent with the results of one non-randomised
trial that also demonstrated no between-group difference in
unplanned hospital re-admission within 6 weeks of discharge.39
Effect on hospital readmissions in the subacute setting
Meta-analysis was unable to be performed for this outcome in
either randomised or non-randomised trials in the subacute
setting. However, one subacute randomised, controlled trial
reported no difference between intervention and control condi-
tions for hospital re-admission within 30 days of discharge.29
Effect on adverse events in the acute setting
Randomised trials
Meta-analysis (n = 27 508) of cluster-level data from two acute,
stepped-wedge, randomised, controlled trials25 indicated no
statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients
experiencing adverse events (n = 2464) for the events measured
(falls, pressure injuries, pulmonary embolism, deep vein throm-
bosis, rapid response medical team call, transfer to intensive care,
transfer to high dependency unit, and death) between those
receiving and not receiving weekend allied health services (RD
0.00, 95% CI –0.01 to 0.01, I2 = 83%), as shown in Figure 6a. High
levels of heterogeneity in the study results were examined in post-
hoc exploratory analysis by Haines et al,25 suggesting that there
was a significant change in patients experiencing any adverse
event between control conditions; however, when intervention
conditions were compared, there was no significant difference.25
Non-randomised studies and subgroup analyses
The results from randomised trials were concordant with those
from two acute non-randomised, controlled trials,39,43 for which
meta-analysis (n = 3348) showed no effect of weekend allied
health on the number of adverse events (n = 135) for the events
measured (falls, pressure injuries, pulmonary embolism, deep vein
thrombosis, rapid response medical team calls, transfer to
intensive care or high dependency unit, and deaths) between
those receiving and not receiving weekend allied health services
(RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.73, I2 = 78%), as shown in Figure 6b.
However, high levels of heterogeneity in study results were
observed between studies.
Effect on adverse events in the subacute setting
Randomised trials
Meta-analysis (n = 1437) of three subacute randomised,
controlled trials26,27,32 indicated no difference between week-
end and no weekend allied health for the number of adverse
events (n = 303) for the adverse events measured (falls, skin
tears, infections, re-admission to acute service, and death)
between those receiving and not receiving weekend allied
health services (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.39, I2 = 0%), as shown in
Figure 6c.

 Effect on discharge destination in the acute setting
Randomised trials
Meta-analysis (n = 27 508) of cluster-level data from two acute,
stepped-wedge, randomised, controlled trials25 indicated no differ-
ence in the proportion of patients discharged to aged care between
those receiving and not receiving weekend allied health services (RD
0.00, 95% CI –0.00 to 0.01; I2 = 31%), as shown in Figure 7a.
Non-randomised studies and subgroup analyses
This result was somewhat discordant with those from three
acute non-randomised studies35,39,43 (n = 3588), where a meta-
analysis showed that patients receiving weekend allied health may
have been more likely to be discharged home to private residence
from hospital (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.38, I2 = 59%), as shown in
Figure 7b. However, high levels of heterogeneity in study results
were observed between studies.
Effect on discharge destination in the subacute setting
Randomised trials
Meta-analysis was not possible for randomised trials in the
subacute setting. However, one subacute randomised, controlled
trial reported no difference between intervention and control
conditions for the number of patients discharged to aged care.26
Non-randomised studies and subgroup analyses
This result was concordant with those from two subacute non-
randomised 
studies41,42
(n = 4476), 
for 
which 
meta-analysis
showed no effect of weekend allied health on the relative risk of
patients being discharged to aged care (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.34,
I2 = 0%), as shown in Figure 7c.
Effect on functional independence in the acute setting
Randomised trials
Meta-analysis was not possible for this outcome in randomised
trials in the acute setting.
Non-randomised studies and subgroup analyses
Functional independence with activities of daily living were
measured in three acute non-randomised, controlled trials.35,37,43The
Barthel Index, ‘days to mobilising with two sticks’, and ‘days to
independentmobility’weretransformedtoconformtothesameeffect
direction. These were then pooled and categorised as functional
activities of daily living outcomes. Meta-analysis of three acute non-
randomised studies (n = 1201) showed no difference in functional
independence between those who had weekend allied health services
available and those who did not (SMD 0.19, 95% CI –0.12 to 0.50,
I2 = 77%), as shown in Figure 8a. Heterogeneity levels were reduced
when subgroup analysis of only total hip arthroplasty patients (SMD
0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.51, I2 = 0%), total knee arthroplasty patients (SMD
0.39, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.64, I2 = 0%), or studies examining only
physiotherapy (no other professions) was performed (SMD 0.34,
95% CI 0.19 to 0.49, I2 = 0%), as shown in Table 5.
Effect on functional independence in the subacute setting
Randomised trials
The Functional Independence Measure was pooled and cate-
gorised as a functional activity of daily living outcome measured in
three subacute randomised, controlled trials.26,27,32 The Timed Up
and Go test, and the Wolf Motor Function Test were transformed to
conform to the same effect direction. These were then pooled and
categorised as functional mobility outcomes measured in three
subacute randomised, controlled trials.26,27,32Walking speed and 10-
Metre Walk Test were transformed to conform to the same effect
direction. These were then pooled and categorised as functional
walking speed outcomes measured in three subacute randomised,
controlled trials.26,27,32The Motor Assessment Scale and the physical
dimension of the Stroke Impact Scale were transformed to conform
to the same effect direction. These were then pooled and categorised
as stroke-specific functional outcomes in three subacute non-
randomised, controlled trials.26,27,32 Measurement time points were
grouped prior to inpatient discharge.
Meta-analysis (n = 1437) showed a trend towards improved
functional activities of daily living taken prior to hospital discharge
in favour of weekend allied health service provision, although this
was not statistically significant (SMD 0.09, 95% CI –0.01 to 0.19,
I2 = 0%), as shown in Figure 8b. No difference was identified
between intervention and control conditions in meta-analyses of
functional mobility (n = 335), walking speed (n = 438), and stroke-
specific outcome measures (n = 210).
Non-randomised studies and subgroup analyses
The Functional Independence Measure was pooled and cate-
gorised as a functional activity of daily living outcome measure in
three subacute non-randomised, controlled trials.40–42 Results from
meta-analysis of randomised, controlled trials were somewhat
concordant with meta-analysis of three subacute non-randomised,
controlled trials (n = 4746), which showed no statistically significant
difference between weekend and no weekend allied health for
functional activitiesof dailylivingoutcomemeasures(SMD 0.05, 95%
CI –0.17 to 0.28, I2 = 89%), as shown in Figure 8c. However, high levels
of heterogeneity in study results were observed between studies.
Effect on quality of life in the acute setting
Meta-analysis was not possible for this outcome in randomised
or non-randomised trials in the acute setting. No randomised trials
reported health-related quality of life in the acute setting, and one
non-randomised trial demonstrated no difference in quality of life

In three subacute randomised, controlled trials, the EuroQol Five

as improvements in quality of life may have been achieved during a
shorter length of hospital stay.

 relative to patient diagnosis. High levels of heterogeneity in the study
results were explained in exploratory analysis by Haines et al,25
indicating that there was a significant change in total cost favouring
the original weekend allied health service delivery model, although
these outcomes did not account for differences in patient diagnosis
categories between phases.25
Effect on cost of hospital care in the subacute setting
Meta-analysis was not possible for this outcome in randomised or

randomised, controlled trial reported economic outcomes at 3-
month, 6-month and 12-month follow-up.29,30At 3-month follow-up
post hospital discharge, there was a mean cost saving of AUD1673
favouring weekend allied health service provision. An incremental
cost utility ratio saving of AUD41 825 per quality of life year gained,
and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio found a saving of
AUD16 003 in achieving a minimal clinically important difference
in functional independence for the group receiving additional
weekend allied health service provision. If willingness to pay per
quality of life year gained or minimal clinically important difference
in functional independence was AUD0, the probability of cost-
effectiveness would be 96 and 95%, respectively. A sensitivity
analysis removing the Saturday penalty rate salary loading of 50%
did not alter the results of the primary analysis. At 6-month follow-up
there was a mean cost saving of AUD6445 favouring weekend allied
health service provision; however, this saving was no longer
significant at 12-month follow-up. The incremental cost-effectiveness

Discussion
This meta-analysis supported previous syntheses showing that
allied health rehabilitation therapy services improve patient
outcomes.12,15,45 This is the first review to show that benefits
can be achieved in the subacute rehabilitation setting by providing
additional allied health services on weekends. The same benefits
have not been demonstrated by additional weekend nursing and
medical staffing in the subacute rehabilitation setting. A study
examining the effect of additional rehabilitation provided by
nursing did not produce favourable results,46 and there is a paucity
of research on medical staffing models in subacute rehabilitation
settings.
The evidence generated by this review may assist resource
allocation decisions by healthcare policymakers and managers
considering implementing out-of-hours and 7-day healthcare
service models. The identified benefits include improved patient
function and health-related quality of life during shorter hospital
length of stay, which indicate that increased rehabilitation efficiency
is achievable. Further, the reduced hospital length of stay may also
provide incentives for investment in additional weekend allied
health service provision because reductions in length of stay in
subacute rehabilitation hospitals can improve patient flow in acute
services and contribute to improved cost-effectiveness.47
In contrast, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that
routinely using a weekend allied health model to provide additional
services in the acute general medical and surgical ward setting would
achieve intended benefits for all patients. It is possible that the
difference in outcomes between acute and subacute ward types is due
to variability in the focus of alliedhealth activities inthese settings. For
example, physiotherapy services for chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease in the acute hospital ward setting may focus on preventing
respiratory failure by providing non-invasive ventilation,48whereas in
the subacute rehabilitation ward setting, these services may empha-
sise therapies specifically aimed at improving functional indepen-
dence.49 Therefore, an evaluation of providing weekend allied health
services in either the acute or subacute ward setting should reflect
these outcomes of interest. Another possible explanation for unclear
results in the acute setting is that providing additional allied health
services in isolation may not change outcomes, due to limited medical
and nursing staffing. A recent study in the acute general medical
setting incorporated a multi-disciplinary 7-day medical, nursing, and
alliedhealth staffing model, which reported improvements in hospital
length of stay, reduced general medical bed occupancy days, and
improved weekend discharges.50 However, comprehensive 7-day

 medical, nursing, and allied health service provision may not improve
outcomes in all circumstances.51 Unclear results in the acute setting
could also be explained by previously examined logistical difficulties
in implementing weekend allied health service models. This may be
due to the employment of less experienced staff during weekends to
reduce cost;16 employing staff who work outside of the organisation
during normal business hours;16reducedmedical and nursing staffing
over the weekend;52–54 unavailability of services from community-
based organisations needed to facilitate discharge on weekends; and
patient expectation of rest on the weekend.55 Findings in the acute
general medical and surgical ward setting should not be extrapolated
to weekday, after-hours, on-call, or 7-days a week service provision
models, and only applies to relevant wards, as defined in this review.
However, it should also be noted that only two randomised, controlled
trials (one article) from a single country have been published
evaluating acute weekend allied health services;25 considering
weekend service variability, it is possible that other untested targeted
models of weekend allied health service could provide benefit. Future
studies could consider whether alternative models have the potential
to deliver cost-effective weekend allied health services.
It is believed that this is the first systematic review examining the
effectiveness of providing additional allied health services to acute and
subacute hospital wards during weekends. It is also the first meta-
analysistoincludeastepped-wedge,randomised,controlledtrialdesign.
This design is valuable because it provides a statistically powerful,
methodologically rigorous approach for evaluating weekend allied
health services where provision is considered usual care. The
comprehensive search strategy resulted in 19 articles (20 studies) being
identified, with 38 732 participants, which is the largest and most
contemporaneousreviewtobeconductedonthistopicarea.Thepooling
of results according to study designs and setting may assist the
understanding of how non-randomised trials can be compared with the
results from randomised studies, and applied to clinical areas of interest.
However, a number of excluded studies exploring interventions that
include a weekend allied health service component must be
acknowledged.13,56–58 In most cases these were excluded, as the effect
of weekend therapy was unable to be isolated from concurrent weekday
interventionswithinthetrials(eg,increasedweekday,after-hours,oron-
call services in addition to a weekend service). Future research should
focusonimplementingadditionalalliedhealththroughdifferentmodels
such as increasing frequency, intensity, time, and type of services during
normal departmental operating hours; 7-day service provision;
evaluating outreach models; on-call services; comprehensive care
compared to discipline-specific models; and after-hours provision.
Despite the large number of trials that were identified overall,
the relatively small number of studies with randomised and non-
randomised designs in acute and subacute settings limited the
generalisability of these findings. This was particularly evident for
the acute randomised, controlled trials, where there were only two
studies. However, a large number of participants were included in
the acute randomised trial meta-analysis (n = 27 508), and there
were 
relatively 
narrow 
confidence 
intervals 
for 
effect 
size
estimates and the overall meta-analysis. Heterogeneity in the
results of randomised studies in the acute setting for hospital
length of stay and adverse event outcomes was examined via
exploratory analysis in the original study, suggesting that there
was a significant change in outcomes between control conditions,
and when intervention conditions were compared, there was no
significant difference in outcomes.25 However, this post-hoc
analysis was hypothesis generating, suggesting the need for
additional research in this setting. Data relating to the frequency,
intensity, time and type of additional weekend allied health service
provision were unable to be extracted due to limitations in
reporting. Therefore, the results of this meta-analysis should be
interpreted as applying to staffing models, rather than specific
allied health assessments and particular interventions.
Due to the nature of providing additional allied health services
over weekends, blinding of participants and allied health person-
nel was not possible. Blinding of outcome assessors was used to
reduce risk of bias in some studies; however, there was a potential
risk of bias for outcomes unable to be blinded such as hospital
length of stay, where allied health personnel could delay or
expedite hospital discharge for either the intervention or control
groups, thereby affecting the hospital length of stay outcome data.
The use of a stepped-wedge, randomised, controlled trial design in
the acute setting may have reduced this risk of bias, as service
demands would be prohibitive to interference across extended
control and intervention periods. Also, use of outcome measures,
such as hospital length of stay and cost to the health service per
admission, was potentially problematic in some of the included
studies. It was not always clear whether the data for hospital
length of stay and cost were relative or absolute because patient
cohorts varied over time. Changes in these outcome variables could
have resulted from changing cohorts, as well as improvements
from interventions. One way to control for this would be to
consider outcomes relative to diagnoses using coding data, for
example hospital length of stay relative to expected length of stay.
Providing additional allied health services to patients in
subacute rehabilitation wards on the weekend reduced hospital
length of stay, and may be an economically efficient way to
improve functional independence and health-related quality of
life. However, for acute general medical and surgical hospital
wards, the impact of weekend allied health services is unclear. This
synthesis of evidence to date suggests that the benefits of routinely
providing additional allied health services on subacute rehabilita-
tion wards is clearer than in the acute general medical and surgical
ward setting. Future studies are required to further investigate the
effect of targeted weekend allied health services. However, the
goals of care for weekend allied health service provision may differ
between acute and subacute hospital ward settings, and should
therefore be reflected in the outcomes evaluated in future studies.
What was already known on this topic: The provision of
weekend allied health services in hospitals is variable, with
differences in the amount and focus of service delivery. Pro-
viding earlier, additional or high-intensity allied health services
is generally beneficial, but the specific effect of additional
weekend services is unclear.
What this study adds: Providing additional weekend allied
health services in subacute rehabilitation wards significantly
reduced hospital length of stay, and may be a cost-effective
way of improving function and quality of life. The effect in acute
general medical and surgical wards remains unclear despite
substantial data.
