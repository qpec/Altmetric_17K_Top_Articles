Abstract
Background: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are battery-operated devices designed to vaporise nicotine, which may help
smokers quitting or reducing their tobacco consumption. There is a lack of data on the health effects of EC use among
smokers with COPD and whether regular use results in improvement in subjective and objective COPD outcomes.
We investigated long-term changes in objective and subjective respiratory outcomes in smokers with a diagnosis of COPD
who quit or reduced substantially their tobacco consumption by supplementing with or converting only to ECs use.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with COPD to identify those reporting regular daily use
of ECs on at least two follow-up visits at 12- (F/up1) and 24-months (F/up2). Regularly smoking COPD patients were
included as a reference group.
Results: A marked reduction in cigarette consumption was observed in ECs users. A significant reduction in COPD
exacerbations was reported in the COPD EC user group, their mean (±SD) decreasing from 2.3 (±1) at baseline to 1.8
(±1; p = 0.002) and 1.4 (±0.9; p < 0.001) at F/up1 and F/up2 respectively. A significant reduction in COPD exacerbations
was also observed in ECs users who also smoked conventional cigarettes (i.e. ‘dual users’). COPD symptoms and ability
to perform physical activities improved statistically in the EC group at both visits, with no change in the control group.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that ECs use may aid smokers with COPD reduce their cigarette consumption or
remain abstinent, which results in marked improvements in annual exacerbation rate as well as subjective and
objective COPD outcomes.

Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a
progressive disease characterized by a persistent inflam-
matory and remodelling response of the airways causing
respiratory symptoms, progressive decline besides in
lung function, respiratory failure, cor pulmonale and death
[1–7]. COPD is estimated to become the third leading
cause of death in 2030 (www.who.int/whosis/whostat/
2008/en/). As expected, COPD and the catastrophic
complications of advanced stage disease impose a sub-
stantial economic burden on healthcare systems; in the
US alone, direct costs of COPD have been estimated at
$29.5 billion, with indirect costs of $20.4 billion [8].
Studies in the UK have estimated an annual direct cost
of treatment per patient of £819 [9].
The distinctive inflammatory response of the airways
in COPD is generally associated with tobacco smoking
[2, 3], with about 15–20% of smokers developing a
diagnosis of COPD [4]. Furthermore, COPD smokers or
ex-smokers are at an increased risk for lung cancer [5],
cardiovascular diseases [6, 7] and diabetes [10].
Smoking cessation is the only evidence based strategy
known to improve the COPD prognosis [11, 12]. Smoking
cessation reduces the rate of annual decline in pulmonary
function, attenuates respiratory symptoms of cough and
sputum, and improves health status [13–15]. Additionally,
stopping smoking reduces the risk of developing and
eventually dying from lung cancer, cardiovascular disease
and other tobacco-related illnesses [16]. Therefore, it is

 important to recommend COPD patients who smoke to
quit as early as possible.
Although FDA-approved smoking cessation drugs (i.e.
nicotine replacement therapy, buproprion, and varenecline)
in combination with counseling have been shown to pro-
mote abstinence in COPD patients who smoke, the relapse
rate is very high compared to smokers in the general popu-
lation [17]. Unsuccessful smoking cessation and relapses
are more frequently reported in COPD patients [18, 19],
mainly because of their higher pack-year history, greater de-
gree of nicotine dependence, inferior motivation to quit,
and increased risk for depressive symptoms [20]. Improved
quit rates would be desirable in a population that generally
responds poorly to smoking cessation efforts. Conse-
quently, the need for novel and more efficient approaches
to smoking cessation interventions is unquestionable.
Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are battery-operated devices
designed to vaporise nicotine without burning tobacco. ECs
are now regulated in the EU by the new Tobacco Products
Directive (TPD) [21], which mandates that e-vapour prod-
ucts are only placed on the market if the nicotine dose and
uptake is reported and toxicological risk assessment is car-
ried out on aerosol emissions. Marketing of ECs is now
legal in the United States, where the FDA recently finalized
rules for the regulation of ECs as a tobacco product
(www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2008/en/).
These consumer products share many similarities with
smoking in the behavioural aspect of their use [22]. Users
are predominantly smokers, who report using them long-
term as an alternative to conventional cigarettes, reduce
their consumption or quit smoking, alleviate tobacco
withdrawal symptoms, and continue having a ‘smoking’
experience [23], but mitigated health risks [24, 25]. Data
from clinical trials [26–28] and meta-analyses [29] have
shown that ECs may help smokers quitting or reducing
their tobacco consumption and their use is well tolerated.
There is a lack of data on the health effects of EC use
amongst smokers with COPD in the literature. In particu-
lar, the impact of inhaling aerosol emissions from ECs on
routinely assessed objective and subjective respiratory out-
comes in COPD patients is unknown. Here we report, a
24-month follow-up of respiratory outcomes in smokers
with a diagnosis of COPD who quit or reduced substan-
tially their tobacco consumption by switching to regular
ECs use.
Methods
This retrospective study was conducted at four Italian
hospitals over the period September 2013 to December
2015 in the outpatient setting. The study was approved by
the ethics review board of the coordinating center
(“Policlinico-Vittorio Emanuele Hospitals”) and informed
consent was obtained from each patient.
Patient population
A review of the case notes of patients with COPD regu-
larly followed up was conducted. Patients reporting
regular daily use of ECs (and if at all conventional ciga-
rettes) at least two follow-up visits over a 24-months
period were eligible to for inclusion. A second group of
age- and sex-matched COPD patients reporting to be
regular smokers (and not using ECs) over the same ob-
servation period was selected from the four participating
clinics as reference (control) group.
The diagnosis of COPD was made according to the
Global initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
(GOLD) criteria [1]. In particular, selected patients had
to have a ≥30 pack year smoking history and an ob-
structive post-bronchodilator spirometry ratio (i.e. <70%)
documented
in
their
notes.
Smokers
with
COPD
followed-up at these outpatient clinics were regularly
asked about their smoking behaviour and given brief
advice about quitting smoking. If interested in being
assisted in a quit attempt they were referred to the
smoking cessation clinic.
Study design
A physicians from each of the participating centres
reviewed the clinical notes of patients attending the
clinics. COPD patient data was extracted from the clinic
visit immediately preceding [baseline visit] the first of
the two follow-ups visits [follow-up visit 1 and 2]. In
brief, data from the three clinic visits were collected and
analysed. Follow-up visits 1 (F/up1) and 2 (F/up2) were
carried out at 12 (±1.5) and 24 (±2.5) months after
baseline visits, respectively.
Study outcomes assessed
The primary outcomes of interest were: a) reduction in
cig/day consumption; and b) number of exacerbations in
the previous 12 months at each of the visits and how they
may have changed over the 24-month period in the EC
group compared to the control group. Secondary out-
comes of interest were changes from baseline to the final
follow-up visit in: a) lung function; b) COPD Assessment
Test (CAT) scores; and c) 6-min walk distance (6MWD).
In addition, changes in the relative proportion of COPD
GOLD stages throughout the 24-months observation
period were reported for both study groups as well as the
change in mean FEV1 from baseline to F/up2.
Study assessments
At each routine outpatient clinic visit, patients were assessed
using a standard approach consisting of review of smoking
history, respiratory ailments and exacerbations, clinical
examination, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body
weight), post-bronchodilator spirometry and GOLD staging
[1], completion of the CAT (www.CATestonline.org) and

 re-evaluation of treatment adherence and efficacy. The CAT
is a validated, short (8-item) and simple patient-completed
questionnaire developed for use in routine clinical practice
to assess health status of patients with COPD [30]. A change
of 2 units is considered to be the minimal clinical import-
ance difference [31]. If deemed appropriate and amenable, a
6MWD test was conducted to measure the overall ability to
perform daily physical activities [32].
For the purposes of the study, severe exacerbations were
defined as those requiring a course of antibiotics and/or
oral corticosteroids via their primary care physician, at-
tendance to the emergency department for nebulisation
and/or hospital admission for their respiratory symptoms
with the requirement of antibiotics and oral corticoste-
roids. Spirometry was conducted post-bronchodilator for
measurement of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)
and forced vital capacity (FVC), and the expiratory ratio
computed as percentage (%FEV1/FVC).
Patients’ data at the outpatient visits were extracted
from their medical record and entered into an electronic
spreadsheet for statistical computation.
Analyses
Parametric data were expressed as mean (±standard
deviation (SD)) while non-parametric data expressed as
median (interquartile range (IQR)). We also delineated
data for single (exclusive ECs use) and ‘dual users’ (i.e.
ECs users who also smoke conventional cigarettes). Stat-
istical comparisons of parameters were assessed using
student’s T-test and Wilcoxon-signed rank test depend-
ing on whether the data was parametric or not, respect-
ively. Similar statistical analyses were conducted on dual
and single users within groups from baseline. Missing
measurements were not included in the analyses. With
the study involving repeated parameter measurements,
analysis of repeated measures with Bonferroni correction
was conducted for between groups over the study period.
A two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered to
indicate statistical significance. All analyses were per-
formed with the Statistical Package for Social Science
(SPSS for windows version 18.0, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics
Data from a total of 48 COPD patients were included in
the study. Patients had mild to very severe disease ac-
cording to the GOLD criteria and were treated accord-
ingly [1]. Twenty-four patients with COPD reporting
regular daily EC use on two follow-up visits over the ob-
servation period of 24-months and twenty-four COPD
matched controls were identified. Baseline demographic,
COPD GOLD stage, objective and subjective parameter
data on both study groups are summarised on Table 1.
There were no significant differences in the measured
parameters at baseline.
Changes in smoking behaviour and patterns of EC use
Patients’ cigarettes consumption at baseline and at
follow-up visits are illustrated in Fig. 1. A substantial

 observed in COPD EC users, their mean (±SD) ciga-
rettes/day use decreasing from 21.8 (±4.4) at baseline to
1.8 (±2.2) at F/up1 and to 1.58 (±2.0) at F/up2, respect-
ively (p < 0.001 for both visits) (Table 2). As expected, no
significant change in conventional cigarette consumption
was observed in the reference group.
Complete abstinence from tobacco smoking was ob-
served in 13/24 (54.2%) of COPD EC users. Dual usage
was reported by 11/24 (45.8%) COPD EC users. None-
theless, a significant reduction in conventional cigarette
consumption was also observed in dual users, with their
mean (±SD) cigarettes/day use decreasing from 23.7
(±5.4) at baseline to 4 (±1.2) at F/up1 and to 3.5 (±1.3)
at F/up2, respectively (p < 0.001 for both visits) (Table 3).
More than 75% reduction from baseline in cigarette/day
consumption was reported by all COPD EC dual users
at both follow-up visits.
COPD exacerbations
There was a significant reduction in annual COPD exacer-
bations within the COPD EC user group, their mean
(±SD) decreasing from 2.3 (±1) at baseline to 1.8 (±1; p =
0.002) at F/up1 and to 1.4 (±0.9; p < 0.001) at F/up2, while
no significant change was observed in the control group

 (Table 2; Fig. 2). A between groups significant reduction
(p = 0.005) in COPD exacerbations over the 24 months
observation period was also noted (Table 2).
A significant reduction in COPD exacerbations was
also observed in dual users, but only at 24 months;
the number of exacerbation were reduced from 2.6
(±0.8) at baseline to 1.5 (±0.8; p = 0.002) at F/up2
(Table 3). In the single users there was marked reduc-
tion in exacerbations at F/up1 (p = 0.002) and F/up2
(p = 0.009) compared to baseline (Table 3). Of note,
none of the patients included had a significant modi-
fication in COPD medications during the observation
period.
Lung function assessments and COPD staging
Compared to baseline there were no significant differences
in the post-bronchodilator FEV1, FVC and %FEV1/FVC
between study groups (Table 2; Fig. 3a, b and c). There
were no overall within group differences in spirometric as-
sessments over the 24 month study period. Nonetheless,
there was a significant difference (p = 0.037) in the rate of
FEV1 decline at the 24-month follow-up visit in COPD
ECs users (mean increase 39 mls) than in the control
group (mean decrease 12 mls).
GOLD COPD staging variations are illustrated on
Fig. 4. Over the 24-months observation period, we noted
that a few COPD patients in the EC study group down-
staged from GOLD Stage 4 to GOLD Stage 3 and 2. In
contrast, the relative proportion of COPD GOLD stages
for the reference group was virtually unchanged during
the course of the study.

COPD symptoms, as assessed using the CAT, at both
follow-up visits decreased statistically (both F/up1 and
F/up2 p < 0.001) and clinically significantly (follow-up
visit 1 and 2 reductions of 4 and 3.5 units, respectively)
in the EC group, whereas there was little change in the
control group (Table 2; Fig. 5). Similar overall between
group significantly statistical improvements (p = 0.001)
were noted in favour of the EC user group.
Results of 6MWD were only available in 13 patients of
the EC user group and 14 of the control group (Table 2;
Fig. 6). Over the 24 months observation period, the me-
dian 6MWD improved more than 60 m (p = 0.002) in
the EC user group compared to just over a median of 3
m (p = 0.096) in the control group. Significant overall
between group improvements were also noted in favour
of the EC user group.
Discussion
No formal efficacy assessment of EC use has been con-
ducted in patients with COPD. Here, we show for the
first time, albeit retrospectively, that COPD patients
were able to quit or substantially reduced their tobacco
consumption by switching to regular ECs use. In these
patients we also document an improvement in several
objective and subjective respiratory outcomes; in par-
ticular COPD exacerbations, annual decline in FEV1,
CAT scores and 6MWD. Quality of life and attenuation
of disease exacerbations was reported in a COPD patient
switching ot vaping in a case series of three inveterate
smokers [33]. A substantial reduction in conventional
cigarette consumption was observed in COPD patients
who switched to regular ECs use, with complete long-
term abstinence from tobacco smoking being reported
in over half of the COPD EC users. Dual usage was com-
mon (45.8%), though conventional cigarette consump-
tion was substantially reduced, with all dual users
smoking at least 75% less cigarettes compared to their
baseline. Our observation of a 2-years abstinence rate of
about 50% in a population, albeit small, that generally
responds poorly to smoking cessation efforts is one of
the highest ever reported in smoking cessation literature.
The large magnitude of this effect in COPD may be
explained by the fact that these products are known to
replicate the smokers’ smoking experience and associ-
ated rituals, the great compensatory effect of EC at both
physical and behavioral level is likely to explain the ob-
served high success rates [22]. The same mechanism has
been shown to drive key success rates among other
vulnerable patients populations who switched to daily
EC use, including asthma and schizophrenia [34–36].
Although smoking cessation is one of the few inter-
ventions shown to reduce all-cause mortality in patients
with COPD [37], there is limited data showing the bene-
fits of smoking cessation in reducing exacerbations. Our
study is the first to consider the number of COPD exac-
erbations as an outcome in a smoking cessation study.
We observed that in COPD patients who have switched
to regular ECs use, there was a significant reduction in
COPD exacerbations in exclusive EC users as well as
dual users. These preliminary findings are in agreement

 with the reduced risk of COPD exacerbations of two
large population studies [38, 39]. Godtfredson et al. re-
ported that previous smokers had a 43% lower risk of
hospitalization
for
COPD
compared
with
current
smokers [38]. Au et al. reported a 22% reduced risk of
COPD exacerbations in ex-smokers compared with
current smokers when adjusted for comorbidity, markers
of COPD severity, and socioeconomic status [39]. By
contrast, in the Lung Health Study [40] and in a 2.5-
years follow up of 64 COPD patients by Kessler et al.
[41] there was no significant difference in the risk of
hospital admission between current smokers and ex-
smokers. However, these studies were not consistent in
considering influential confounders for the risk of COPD
exacerbations such as duration of smoking abstinence,
COPD severity, comorbidities, age, etc. In our investiga-
tion the two study groups were evenly mached for all
these confounders. The marked attenuation in COPD ex-
acerbations may be explained by the cessation/reduction
in chronic exposure of the airways to cigarette smoke
which is known to promote susceptibility to infection
through a number of different mechanisms [42–44]; and
switching to ECs is likely to lower the risk of respiratory
infections and pneumonia [45]. Besides, regular vaping
has been reported to favourably alter anti-microbial and

 -inflammatory activity in exhaled breath [46] besides the
theoretical benefit of propylene glycol in its aerosol form
being a potent bactericidal agent.
We did not observe any significant change in the post-
bronchodilator FEV1, FVC and %FEV1/FVC within
study groups. The lack of significant changes in standard
spirometric indices after smoking cessation is not un-
usual in smokers with COPD [47, 48], which may be due to
the pathophysiology associated with COPD [2, 3] especially
in more advanced disease. Importantly, this is not the case
in asthmatics in studies of comparable design [34, 35].
The effect of smoking on the progressive decline in
lung function in COPD is well established [49] and
attenuation in the annual rate of FEV1 decline has
been generally reported in smoking cessation studies of
COPD patients [13, 14]. In the current study, there
was a significant reversal in the annual FEV1 decline
at 24-month in COPD ECs users compared to COPD
controls. Surprisingly, the improvement in the annual
FEV1 decline was more so in the dual users than the
single users; this was probably due to the higher propor-
tion of less severe COPD GOLD stages in dual users.
Besides the observed reduction in exacerbation rates,
amelioration of overall health status (as measured by
CAT) and physical activity (measured by 6MWD) in the
COPD patients who quit or reduced substantially their
tobacco consumption by switching to regular ECs use
are also novel and clinically relevant findings. Similar
improvements in CAT scores and 6MWD have been
shown in COPD patients undergoing intensive rehabili-
tation programs [31, 50]. The mechanism for these im-
proved health outcomes following smoking cessation
may be related to the substantial reduction in carbon
monoxide (CO) (as well as in COHb levels) when giving
up smoking [46] and the related time-dependent im-
provement in exercise tolerance upon smoking abstin-
ence [51]. An internet based survey in COPD (n = 1190)
and asthma (n = 1308) subjects has shown self-reported
improved respiratory outcomes when switched to EC
use of 75.7% and 65.4% respectively [23]. Surprisingly,
with the use of ECs about a fifth of the all the subjects
in the survey ceased to use any of their respiratory drugs
and only around 1% of the asthmatics and COPD
subjects had worsening respiratory symptoms.
There are some limitations in our study. Firstly, this is
a relatively small retrospective study, hence the results
cannot be generalized and must be interpreted with
caution. Despite the small number of subjects we noted
significant results in several crucial study endpoints.
Standard concerns associated with retrospective studies
(including variance in the quality of information re-
corded by medical professionals and difficulty in estab-
lishing a causal relationship) also need consideration.
Nonetheless, a clear advantage conducting this type of
study is the generation of hypotheses that can be tested
prospectively under controlled conditions. Secondly, it is
possible that patients in this study represent a self-
selected sample, which may not be representative of all
COPD smokers who tried ECs. Furthermore, assessment
of smoking abstinence was self-reported and liable to
recall bias. However, self-reported number of cigarettes
smoked per day in studies of this type is not subjected
to the kind of biases observed in clinical trials where
there is the tendency to claim abstinence [52]. Moreover,
similar beneficial effects were also reported in dual users
(i.e., smoking reducers) and therefore objective measures
of abstinence are unlikely to be of great importance.
Additionally, the 6MWD was not conducted in all pa-
tients as it is not standard requirement and some pa-
tients declined.
Conclusions
Regular ECs use may help smokers with COPD attenuate
conventional cigarette consumption or remain abstinent, as
well as improve subjective and objective COPD outcomes.
The potential role of the e-vapor category for smoking
cessation and/or harm reduction in COPD requires con-
firmation from larger prospective studies. Nonetheless, the
notion that substitution of conventional cigarettes with ECs
is unlikely to raise significant health concerns in COPD is
generally reassuring and should be communicated to pa-
tients with COPD using or intending to use ECs. Moreover,
given that smoking cessation is a behavioural transition not
a biomedical cure for a disease, the approach should rest on
the informed choice of COPD smokers and their view of
what they think might work for them with the physician as
an adviser rather than prescriber.
