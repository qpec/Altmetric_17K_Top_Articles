ABSTRACT
Cutaneous melanoma, which develops from the pigment producing cells called 
melanocytes, is the most deadly form of skin cancer. Unlike the majority of other 
cancers, the incidence rates of melanoma are still on the rise and the treatment options 
currently available are being hindered by resistance, limited response rates and adverse 
toxicity. We have previously shown that an FDA approved drug leflunomide, used for 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), also holds potential therapeutic value in treating melanoma 
especially if used in combination with the mutant BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib. We 
have further characterized the function of leflunomide and show that the drug reduces 
the number of viable cells in both wild-type and BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell lines. 
Further experiments have revealed leflunomide reduces cell proliferation and causes 
cells to arrest in G1 of the cell cycle. Cell death assays show leflunomide causes 
apoptosis at treatment concentrations of 25 and 50 µM. To determine if leflunomide 
could be used combinatorialy with other anti-melanoma drugs, it was tested in 
combination with the MEK inhibitor, selumetinib. This combination showed a synergistic 
effect in the cell lines tested. This drug combination led to an enhanced decrease 
in tumor size when tested in vivo compared to either drug alone, demonstrating its 
potential as a novel combinatorial therapy for melanoma.

INTRODUCTION
Melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer, 
causing the majority of skin cancer deaths despite only 
accounting for 5% of reported skin cancer cases (Skin 
Cancer Foundation, 2017; [1]) and unlike most other 
cancers, incidence rates are still on the rise. The cause of 
melanoma is a combination of exogenous (environmental) 
and endogenous (genetic) factors [2]. If detected early 
cutaneous melanomas are easily curable through resection, 
as unlike many other cancers, they are externally visible 
and it is only once they have metastasized in later 
stages that the disease becomes difficult to treat (Skin 
Cancer Foundation, 2017). Until recently treatment for 
metastatic melanoma was limited. However, in recent 
years, a number of new therapies have been developed 
that provide a better prognosis for patients. These include 
immunotherapies, in particular immune checkpoint 
inhibitors such as ipilimumab, pembrolizumab and 
nivolumab that show remarkable clinical responses in 
some melanoma patients [3–5]. These therapies however 
are not without their drawbacks, including immune-related

adverse events, limited response rates and possibly also 
therapy-induced acquired resistance, where modifications 
to improve the clinical application of these treatments are 
currently ongoing [6].
Another class of drugs that has been revolutionizing 
the way in which patients with advanced melanoma 
are treated is targeted therapies that block oncogenic 
driver mutations. In particular, targeted therapies that 
block components of the pro-proliferative mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway such as 
BRAF (vemurafenib/dabrafenib) and MEK (trametinib/
selumetinib). Indeed selective RAF inhibitors have 
demonstrated clear survival benefit in oncogenic BRAF 
(predominantly the BRAFV600 mutation)-driven melanomas 
(approximately 50% of patients; [7–10]) and results in 
near-complete abrogation of MAPK signaling in tumors 
harboring such mutations [11].
The effects of these MAPK treatments are however 
only transient due to the emergence of a variety of drug 
resistance mechanisms [12, 13–16] and as a result, 
metastatic melanoma patients receiving these treatments 
as monotherapies eventually succumb to their disease. 
Hence, resistance to such treatments is currently a key 
issue researchers within the melanoma field are faced with 
and it is now evident that monotherapy is not the answer. 
Combinatorial therapy targeting multiple signaling pathways 
or components within the same pathway is where future 
strategies lie to try and delay or override tumor resistance, 
and so provide stronger, more durable responses for 
patients. A number of drug combinations are currently being 
investigated in clinical trials with some proving hopeful. 
Such combinations include combined immunotherapies, 
BRAF inhibitors in combination with immunotherapies 
and BRAF inhibitors in combination with MEK inhibitors 
[17–21]. 
Leflunomide is an FDA approved drug for the 
treatment of RA and is an inhibitor of the enzyme 
dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) [22–24], which 
is the rate limiting enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine 
synthesis pathway. The pyrimidine synthesis pathway 
consists of six enzymatic reactions, which generate 
ribonucleotide uridine monophosphate (rUMP). DHODH 
is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and 
catalyzes the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate, the 
fourth step of this pathway [25]. Inhibition of DHODH 
prevents the synthesis of pyrimidines, which has a knock-
on effect on the synthesis of pyrimidine derivatives such as 
the nucleotide bases cytosine and thymine. This ultimately 
decreases the pool of nucleotides available to make new 
DNA (as well as RNA). From our previous work carrying 
out chemical genetic screens on zebrafish and X. laevis 
embryos, leflunomide was shown to have potential 
therapeutic value in treating melanoma [26]. We further 
showed that leflunomide inhibits neural crest development 
by inhibiting transcriptional elongation of genes necessary 
for neural crest development and also melanoma growth. 
Genes such as sox10 and dct, which are necessary 
for normal neural crest and melanocyte development, 
respectively, exhibited reduced expression [26, 27]. The 
effect leflunomide has on Xenopus and zebrafish embryos 
is phenotypically similar to the suppressors of Ty 5 and 6 
(spt5/spt6) mutant in zebrafish embryos. Spt5/spt6 have 
been shown to be involved in transcriptional elongation 
[28]. Our previous work showed that leflunomide reduced 
cell viability in three melanoma cell lines harboring the 
BRAFV600E mutation [26]. However, it is not known if 
leflunomide affects melanoma cells that do not harbor 
BRAF mutations and details of how leflunomide exerts its 
anti-melanoma effects are currently unknown. 
In this present study we investigate the action of 
leflunomide in melanoma cells. We then go on to show 
that as well as combinatorialy acting with vemurafenib 
[26], leflunomide synergizes with selumetinib to inhibit 
melanoma cell growth and decrease tumor size in vivo. 
Taken together our data suggest that leflunomide used 
in combination with MEK inhibition acts as a potent 
therapeutic drug combination for the treatment of advanced 
stage melanoma. 
RESULTS
Leflunomide decreases the viability of melanoma 
cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and cell death
In clinical practice, assessment of BRAFV600 mutation 
status is the only molecular determinant currently used to 
influence standard-of-care in melanoma patients. We have 
selected a panel of eight human melanoma cell lines to 
further characterize the potential effects of leflunomide as 
an anti-melanoma drug (Supplementary Table 1), where 
half habour the BRAFV600E mutation and the remainder are 
wildtype for BRAF (BRAFWT; Supplementary Table 1). 
As expected BRAFV600 mutant cells are more sensitive to 
vemurafenib treatment than BRAFWT lines (Supplementary 
Figure 1 and Table 1). 
Cell viability assays using CellTiter-Glo showed that 
leflunomide reduced the viability of all eight melanoma cell 
lines in a dose dependent manner (Table 1 and Figure 1A). 
 
Both BRAFWT and mutant BRAF lines were sensitive to 
leflunomide treatment to comparable levels (Table 1 and 
Figure 1B). Overall, we observed no obvious differences 
in leflunomide efficacy based on the mutational status of 
the melanoma cells (compare Supplementary Table 1 and 
Table 1). In addition, we analyzed a number of normal 
human cells and found that they too were sensitive to 
leflunomide; melanocytes were more resistant than most 
of the melanoma cells analyzed (Table 1 and Figure 1C). 
A375 cells are representative of the panel of 
melanoma cells in their clear response to leflunomide 
treatment, which can be easily observed in treated 
monolayers (Supplementary Figure 2A). To determine 
why there was a reduction in cell viability upon treatment

with leflunomide we first investigated cell proliferation 
in response to treatment by staining A375 cells with 
BrdU to determine cell proliferation. The number of 
BrdU positive cells in each of the treatment conditions 
showed a clear dose-dependent decrease in the number of 
proliferating cells in response to increasing concentrations 
of leflunomide (Figure 2A, Supplementary Figure 2B).
To determine if leflunomide was affecting a 
particular stage of the cell cycle, analysis was carried out 
using propidium iodide (PI) to stain for cellular DNA 
content. A375 cells were stained with PI following a 
 
72-hour treatment with DMSO, 25, 50 or 100 μm 
leflunomide (Figure 2B). The G0-G1 phase of the cell 
cycle, increased in a dose-dependent manner in response 
to leflunomide treatment (Figure 2C). From the DMSO 
control 45.71% of cells are actively cycling through G1, 
which increased to 46.56%, 55.05% and 73.56% upon 
treatment with 25, 50 and 100 μM leflunomide, respectively. 
In contrast the number of cells in S-phase decreased from 
40.26% in DMSO control cells to 42.93% in 25 μM 
leflunomide treated cells, 30.41% in 50 μM leflunomide 
treated cells and 11.60% at 100 μM leflunomide (Figure 2C). 
 
Thus, with increasing concentrations of leflunomide, the 
cells become arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and 
the number of cells in S phase significantly decreases. The 
percentage of cells in G2-M at 25 µM was reduced by 50% 
compared to the DMSO control, however the percentage 
of cells in G2-M for 50 and 100 µM leflunomide does 
not alter drastically compared to the 25 µM leflunomide. 
Interestingly, the percentage of cells populated in sub-G1 
gradually increased in a dose-dependent manner. In DMSO 
treated cells 2.60% cells were in sub-G1. This increased 
to 5.36%, 9.12% and 11.84% upon treatment with 25, 50 
and 100 μM leflunomide respectively, suggesting that there 
could be an increase in the number of cells undergoing 
apoptosis in response to the drug treatment (Figure 2B, 2C). 
To further examine if the cells were undergoing 
apoptosis we tested their response to leflunomide treatment 
using Annexin V staining. In control samples the majority 
of the cells were viable as expected, but treatment with 
leflunomide led to pro-apoptotic effects, which was most 
prominent when cells were treated with 50 µM of the drug 
(Figure 2D(iii)). At 100 µM leflunomide unexpectedly 
led to an increase in the number of viable cells (from 
5.91% up to 51.4%), with concomitant decrease in the 
number of early apoptotic (from 49.3% to 28.5%) and late 
apoptotic/necrotic cells (from 44.2% to 19.1%; Figure 2D). 
Overall, we postulate that leflunomide induces apoptosis 
in melanoma cells (as opposed to necrosis), which can 
be easily observed when the data is summarized as the 
percentage of cells undergoing types of cell death upon 
treatment with increasing doses of leflunomide (Figure 2E). 
 
At 100 µM we are still seeing cell death, but the 
apoptosis marker (PS exposure) is lost. The cells could be 
undergoing toxic effects leading to oncosis or necrosis as 
indicated by the loss of cell density, but absence of PS 
exposure (Figure 2D).
In mammalian cells, activation of apoptosis is 
often strongly controlled by mitochondrial activity [33]. 
Given the pro-apoptotic effects of leflunomide at lower 
concentrations observed in melanoma cells (Figure 2), 
we decided to investigate if the drug could also affect 
mitochondrial activity in these cells. JC-1 staining was 
conducted as this is commonly used to measure and 
detect changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and, 
thus, is a commonly used indicator of healthy cells and a

detector of early apoptosis which involves mitochondrial 
depolaristion (Supplementary Figure 3A). With increasing 
concentrations of leflunomide the main population 
appeared to increase in the FL-2 y-axis, which suggests 
an increase in red fluorescence and a potential increase in 
mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔψM), albeit this is a 
relatively subtle effect. However, there is an increase along 
the FL-1 channel with rising concentrations of leflunomide,

suggesting the mitochondria become depolarized in the 
presence of the drug, which is indicative of a pro-apoptotic 
state in these cells (Supplementary Figure 3A). 
Finally, to see if overall mitochondrial content was 
affected upon treatment with leflunomide, Mitotracker 
green dye, which is independent of ΔψM, was used to 
assess mitochondrial mass (Supplementary Figure 3B). 
 
At 100 μM of leflunomide treatment, there was a 
substantial increase in the intensity of green fluorescence, 
suggesting an increase in mitochondrial mass at this 
drug concentration in the melanoma cells. Indeed, 
there was a 3-fold increase in the amount of green 
fluorescence at 100 μM leflunomide when compared to 
the DMSO control, which was not observed at lower 
leflunomide concentrations (Supplementary Figure 3C). 
 
This, however, is not the correct interpretation. Keij et al. 
(2000) reported that mitochondrial swelling (oncosis) can 
lead to increased fluorescence signals, since the normally 
densely-packed self-quenched probes are capable of 
releasing more photons in the swollen mitochondrion. 
Thus, at 100 μM leflunomide we are observing mitotoxicity 
through loss of mitochondrial volume control. This is 
consistent with oncotic cell death which leads to the loss 
of cell density in these samples; it was noted that there 
was a 3-fold increase in the time it took for the 100 μM 
of leflunomide treatment sample to reach 5000 events 
for counting by flow cytometry relative to the 25 μM and 
 
50 μM treated sample sets (Supplementary Figure 3D). Loss 
of ion flux control also explains the loss of the apoptotic 
marker (PS exposure) at the 100 µM dose (Figure 2D). 
 
Overall, we conclude that the differences seen at 
 
100 µM are potentially due to mitochondrial oncosis, which 
is often linked to a complete overdose of a toxin and is 
associated with a loss of cells, but at lower concentrations 
(25 μM and 50 μM) leflunomide induces apoptosis in 
melanoma cells.
Investigating the possibility of using leflunomide 
in combination with a MEK inhibitor to treat 
melanoma
In recent years it has become widely accepted that 
combinatorial therapy is a better approach for treating 
cancer. Within the skin cancer field, there is substantial 
clinical data supporting MEK inhibitors being used for 
the treatment of melanoma [34]. Indeed the standard-
of-care for BRAF-targeting in melanoma has now 
predominantly shifted from the use of single BRAF 
inhibitors to use in combination with MEK inhibitors. 
Taking this into account, the possibility of using 
leflunomide in combination with the MEK inhibitor, 
selumetinib was investigated. The rationale for this is 
that melanomas are addicted to MEK for proliferation 
and survival. Therefore inhibition of MEK might reduce 
survival signaling and sensitize cells to the cytotoxic 
effects of leflunomide. 
Selumetinib (AZD2644) treated cell viability assays 
were carried out using CellTiter-Glo on all eight of the 
melanoma cell lines (Table 1 and Figure 3A). A dose-
dependent decrease can be seen in the number of viable 
cells upon 72-hours treatment with selumetinib in all eight 
of the melanoma cell lines (Figure 3A). There was a broad 
range of variation in the level of sensitivity to selumetinib, 
which is similar to the variation observed for leflunomide 
(Table 1 and Figure 1A). For example the most sensitive 
melanoma cell line to selumetinib was M375 with an IC50 of 
0.10 µM, whereas the least sensitive melanoma cell line was 
SKmel5 with an IC50 of 1.01 μM (Table 1 and Figure 3A). 
Non-melanoma 
cells 
including 
melanocytes 
were also treated with selumetinib (Figure 3A and 
Supplementary Figure 4) and their sensitivity to the drug 
determined (Table 1). Interestingly, all three non-melanoma 
cell types were less sensitive to selumetinib compared to 
the eight melanoma cell lines. The RD1 cell line was the 
most sensitive with cell viability being reduced to 55% at 
1 μM selumetinib (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 4). 
 
This sensitivity was very close to the least sensitive of 
the melanoma lines, SKmel5, where its cell viability was 
reduced to just 51.80% at the same concentration (Table 1). 
 
Overall, these findings are in support of previous work 
showing that melanoma cells are more sensitive to 
MEK inhibition than normal cells, with drug sensitivity 
to selumetinib in the same range as detected here (as 
previously reviewed [35]).
To confirm selumetinib was active and acting ‘on-
target’ as a MEK inhibitor, western blots were performed 
to detect the levels of phospho-ERK (pERK) on treated 
A375 and M202 cells. As ERK is a direct substrate 
of MEK a decrease in pERK would be anticipated in 
response to selumetinib treatment. It can be clearly seen 
that the amount of pERK protein decreases in a dose-
dependent manner in melanoma cells in response to 
selumetinib treatment (Figure 3B and 3C). Overall, this 
confirms that selumetinib is effectively inhibiting its target 
and can reduce cell viability in melanoma cells.
Leflunomide and selumetinib exhibit synergistic 
activity in human melanoma cells
The preceding results showed both leflunomide 
(Figure 1) and selumetinib (Figure 3) were effective at 
reducing cell viability in the melanoma lines. Prompted by 
these results, experiments were designed to determine if the 
combination of leflunomide and selumetinib could reduce 
cell viability further than either drug alone. Combinatorial 
cell viability assays were carried out on all eight of 
the melanoma lines. For these cell viability assays the 
concentrations of leflunomide used were 12.5, 25 and 50 μM 
 
and for selumetinib the concentrations used were 0.025, 
0.05 and 0.1 μM. Two cell viability graphs were generated 
for each melanoma line (Figure 4A and Supplementary 
Figure 5). This was done in order to complete statistical

analysis comparing the drug combinations to each drug 
alone. The statistics shown on these graphs determined 
that the drug combinations were significantly better at 
killing melanoma cells than either drug alone. All of the 
eight melanoma cell lines responded to the combinations 
of leflunomide and selumetinib. The most statistically 
significant combination of leflunomide and selumetinib was 
at 50 μM leflunomide and 0.1 μM selumetinib (a ratio of 
500:1). Therefore this specific combination of leflunomide 
and selumetinib indicates that these concentrations could 
be within the optimal working concentration range for this 
drug combination in melanoma cells.
The next question was are the drugs acting 
synergistically or not? One approach of determining drug 
synergy is by calculating combination index (CI) values 
for multiple drug combinations using the Chou and Talalay 
method [32]. CI values were calculated for each separate 
combination of leflunomide and selumetinib (non-constant 
ratio). This was done for all eight of the melanoma cell 
lines. For each cell line, two graphs were plotted to 
demonstrate the synergism of the two drugs as shown in 
Figure 4B(i) and 4B(ii). For the majority of the lines tested, 
high dose leflunomide (50 μM) showed synergistic effects 
when used in combination with selumetinib (Table 2). 
It was further investigated whether addition of 
Leflunomide or Selumetinib alone 24 hours before addition 
of the other drug had any effect on their synergy. We 
selected four lines; one that showed obligate antagonism 
to the drug combination treatment (A375) to see if 
drug interactions could be improved, one that showed 
obligate drug synergy (M375) to check if the desired 
drug interactions might be lost with a different dosing

Figure 4: Leflunomide and Selumetinib synergize in melanoma cells. Cell viability plots when different concentrations of 
Selumetinib and Leflunomide are added to the cells simultaneously. Graph A(i) shows he concentrations of leflunomide along the x-axis. 
The statistical analysis on this graph compared the combinations of drugs to leflunomide alone. Graph A(ii) shows the concentrations of 
selumetinib along the x-axis. The statistical analysis on this graph compared the drug combinations to selumetinib alone. All values are 
represented as a percentage (%) relative to the vehicle control. Data is presented as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments 
each performed in triplicate. Asterisks indicate the degree of statistical difference comparing each leflunomide and selumetinib condition to 
leflunomide alone (graph A(i)) or selumetinib alone (graph A(ii)). Statistical analysis was determined by two-way ANOVA with Turkey’s 
post-hoc test. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, and ****P ≤ 0.0001. (A) Combination index values for M375 melanoma cell line with leflunomide and 
selumetinib in combination at increasing concentrations. B(i) Along the x-axis is the Fraction Affected (FA) which corresponds to the cell 
viability data inputted (i.e. what fraction of the cells were affected/how much of the cell viability was being reduced by this combination 
of leflunomide and selumetinib). Along the y-axis is the CI values. A dotted line placed across the CI value of 1 makes it easier to see if 
a particular combination of leflunomide or selumetinib was synergistic or not. A CI value of 1 suggests that drug combination is acting 
additively. A value greater that 1 suggests the drug combination is acting antagonistically and a value below 1 suggests they are working 
synergistically. The closer the value to 0 the stronger the synergism. B(ii) This graph utilises the CI value data with the CI values again 
shown along the y–axis but along the x-axis is the concentration of selumetinib with the data sets on the graph corresponding to the 
leflunomide concentrations. The degree of synergism increases with increasing concentrations of leflunomide. The Synergy graphs for the 
other melanoma lines tested are shown in Supplementary Figure 5.

regime and two lines that showed mostly synergistic, 
but also some additive response (M229, and M285; i.e. 
borderline drug synergy response) to treatment (Table 2). 
Supplementary Tables 2–5 show the CI values for these 
treatments of the four melanoma lines. For A375 cells 
there was a slight improvement when the drugs were added 
incrementally, but this was only at one concentration and 
the synergy effect was mild (Supplementary Table 2). For 
M229 and M375 cells, incremental drug addition led to 
loss of drug synergy at most of the concentrations tested 
(Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4). 
M285 on the other hand did show drug synergy for every 
concentration tested when the drugs were added one after 
the other, but this represented only a mild improvement to 
when the drugs were added simultaneously (Supplementary 
Table 5). Overall, these findings suggest that there is 
likely to be a greater chance of achieving drug synergy in 
melanoma cells when leflunomide and selumetinib are co-
administered at the same time.  
Finally, we investigated if the drug combination 
could increase apoptosis in melanoma cells with respect 
to monotherapy by analyzing PARP1 cleavage (cPARP), 
which is a sensitive marker of cells undergoing apoptosis. 
cPARP is increased in melanoma cells in response to the 
drug combination, with concomitant decrease in levels 
of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, MCL-1 
 
(Supplementary Figure 6), showing that combined 
leflunomide and selumetinib treatment increases apoptosis 
in melanoma cells compared with individual drug 
treatment. Selumetinib treatment however results in higher 
levels of the BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein, BIM, than 
the drug combination (Supplementary Figure 6). These 
findings are more difficult to interpret as aside from the 
pro-apoptotic activity of BIM in inducing BAX/BAK 
oligomerization on mitochondria to release cytochrome c 
and induce intrinsic apoptosis, BIM has also been shown 
to possess pro-survival effects in cancer cells [36]. Overall, 
we conclude that combined leflunomide and selumetinib 
can increase apoptosis in melanoma cells to a higher level 
than individual drug treatment alone.
Leflunomide and selumetinib combine to repress 
tumor growth in vivo
Because the combination of leflunomide and 
selumetinib showed synergistic activity in a range of 
melanoma cell lines in our in vitro experiments (Figure 4, 
 
Table 2, Supplementary Tables 2–5 and Supplementary 
Figure 5), we wanted to investigate whether the drug 
combination could also show improved efficacy in vivo 
compared to monotherapy treatment. The M375 cell 
line showed synergistic activity of the drug combination 
at all concentrations tested (Figure 4 and Table 2), so 
we investigated if these cells could be easily engrafted 
in immunodeficient mice as compared to other human 
melanoma cells, for in vivo studies. Using SCID mice, 
we developed an engraftment protocol for these cells and 
compared them to other melanoma lines known to engraft 
in immunocompromised mice, to ensure palpable M375 
tumors could develop in a relatively rapid time-frame 
(Supplementary Figure 7). 
Following 4-weeks of tumor growth, drugs were 
administered in 4 treatment groups; vehicle alone, 
leflunomide alone, selumetinib alone and leflunomide and 
selumetinib in combination (10 animals/group) with a daily 
treatment regime as shown in Figure 5A. In the vehicle 
control arm, the average tumor volume increased from 46 
mm3 on day 0 to 650 mm3 on day 12, indicating a steady 
increase in tumor growth over the course of the experiment 
(Figure 5B). Unexpectedly, leflunomide treatment alone 
did not reduce tumor volume when compared to the vehicle 
control. In contrast, selumetinib treatment significantly 
reduced the average tumor volume, albeit the tumors did 
continue to grow during the duration of the experiment. 
Interestingly however, when leflunomide and selumetinib 
was administered in combination, the tumor volume not 
only decreased to levels significantly smaller than either 
drug treatment alone, but importantly tumor growth was 
suppressed, with tumor volumes remaining steady at the 
same size over the 12-day treatment period (Figure 5B). 
The tumors from the sacrificed mice at the end 
of the experiment were excised, weighed (Figure 5C) 
and imaged (Figure 5D). Overall, there is a remarkable 
drop in tumor size and weights when leflunomide and 
selumetinib were used in combination. The combination 
of leflunomide and selumetinib on the effect on the tumor 
weights was significantly better than either of the two 
drugs alone (Figure 5C). Taken together, our data show 
that combination of leflunomide and selumetinib has the 
capability of not only reducing tumor volume, but also 
preventing tumor growth in vivo. 
DISCUSSION
In recent years the development of new therapies 
for melanoma has led to a revolution in treatment, which 
has reflected decades of basic research into the genomic 
landscape and fundamental immune system behaviour 
of the disease. The advent of BRAF and MEK inhibitors 
used in combination has become a standard therapeutic 
approach in patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma. In 
addition, immunotherapies such as anti-PD-1 antibodies 
have been effective. In many cases, particularly with small 
molecule treatments as monotherapies the main problem 
has been the development of tumor resistance. Therefore, 
it is important to develop new combination therapies and 
to identify novel drugs that can be added to the arsenal of 
anti-melanoma therapies available for patients.
Leflunomide is an immunosuppressive drug which 
was approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of 
RA. It has also been shown to inhibit the growth of a 
number of different cell types including human myeloma

cells [37], mitogen-stimulated T-lymphocytes [38], 
normal human mast cells [39], prostate cancer cells 
[40] neuroblastoma cells [41] and melanoma cells [26]. 
In these different cell types the optimum concentration 
of leflunomide varies. For instance Zhu et al. [41] use 
100 µM as an optimal concentration for their cell cycle 
analysis and apoptosis studies. Here we have determined 
50 µM to be the optimal concentration to use in vitro for 
apoptosis induction. At higher concentrations we detect 
potentially off target toxic effects and the cells undergo 
oncosis. Baumann et al. [37] have themselves noted 
that leflunomide may act independently of DHODH 
at higher concentrations. That is not to preclude higher 
doses from therapeutic consideration. Lytic modes of cell 
death are proinflammatory and in solid tumors, where 
several mechanisms exist to downregulate innate immune 
responses and consequent adaptive immune responses, 
targeted cytotoxicity may facilitate immune activation.  In 
melanoma cells the mechanism of leflunomide action is 
to inhibit transcriptional elongation [26] which leads to a 
decrease in cell proliferation. 
We have previously identified leflunomide as 
having therapeutic value in treating melanoma in a mouse 
xenograft model both on its own and in combination with 
a BRAF inhibitor [26]. We have now expanded upon these 
initial studies to show that leflunomide affects the growth 
of both BRAFWT and mutant melanoma cells (Figure 1). 
 
This potential allows for leflunomide to be used in 
all melanoma cases, not just for tumors harboring 
BRAF mutations. We show that at intermediate dose 
concentrations, leflunomide inhibits G1 arrest and induces 
apoptosis (Figure 2). To the best of our knowledge, this is 
the first time the mechanism of action of leflunomide has 
been investigated in melanoma cells. Finally we also show 
that leflunomide can act in combination with the MEK 
inhibitor, selumetinib (Figure 3), to inhibit melanoma 
growth (Figure 4 and Figure 5).
To determine if the synergism observed in vitro 
between leflunomide and selumetinib had a similar effect 
in vivo, a mouse xenograft study was carried out. This 
study used the M375 cell line for a drug treatment duration 
of 12 days. What was obvious from the results of this study 
was that selumetinib was the more effective drug compared 
to leflunomide (Figure 5). In this experiment leflunomide 
alone did not reduce the tumor volume or weight compared 
to the vehicle control. It is possible that the dose of 
leflunomide used in this experiment may have been on 
the border of efficacy on its own. However, the cells were 
strongly sensitized by leflunomide treatment to the anti-
melanoma effect of the MEK inhibitor. Although from 
this study it cannot be said that the drug synergy observed 
in vitro for M375 translates in vivo, what can be stated 
is that the combination of leflunomide and selumetinib 
significantly decreased the growth of melanoma in vitro 
and in vivo compared to using either drug alone.
Recently leflunomide has been shown to work 
in combination with doxorubicin to inhibit growth of 
triple-negative breast cancer [42]. The mechanism the 
authors suggest is based on their finding that pyrimidine 
synthesis increases in response to genotoxic stress. 
Thus, in our results selumetinib could be inducing this 
response of increased pyrimidine synthesis which in turn 
is inhibited by leflunomide, thus making the cells less 
likely to survive. This does not answer why leflunomide 
has an effect on its own, but does highlight that it could 
make a potent contribution to combinatorial treatments of 
malignancies. Whilst future clinical studies are needed to 
investigate this intriguing possibility further, our findings 
do highlight some important discoveries about the 
leflunomide/selumetinib drug combination for such future 
work. Firstly, the combination shows drug synergy in both 
BRAFMUT and BRAFWT melanoma cells (Table 2, Figure 4 
 
and Supplementary Figure 5), suggesting it could be a 
potent anti-melanoma treatment for patients regardless of 
genotype. Furthermore, we found no patterns with other 
common melanoma mutations (Supplementary Table 1) 
that dictated response rates of the cell lines tested to the 
combination. Secondly, dosing of the combination has 
an improved chance of yielding potent synergistic anti-
melanoma effects, when administered simultaneously 
to the cell panel tested (Supplementary Tables 2–5), 
suggesting designing future dosing regimens where both 
drugs are administered at the same time. Lastly our pre-
clinical in vivo model not only demonstrated the potent 
efficacy of the drug combination at blocking tumor 
growth (Figure 5), but also highlighted that the therapy is 
tolerable, as no overt toxicities were detected in the mice 
during the treatment period. 
In conclusion we have shown leflunomide to work 
in combination both with BRAF and MEK inhibitors 
in preventing melanoma growth. Future work will 
determine the mechanism of drug synergy afforded by 
combined treatment of melanoma cells with leflunomide 
and selumetinib. Furthermore, additional pre-clinical 
experiments are needed to determine if melanoma cells 
can acquire resistance to leflunomide and whether the drug 
could also be successfully used in combination with anti-
melanoma immunotherapies.

Cell lines and culture
The human melanoma M285, M375 and M296, 
cell lines were a kind gift from Antoni Ribas (University 
of California, Los Angeles), and the M202, A375, M229, 
SKmel28 and SKmel5 cells were a kind gift from Randall 
T. Moon and Andy J. Chien (University of Washington, 
Seattle). Primary human melanocytes adult (HEMa-LP) 
were obtained from Gibco. Human embryonic kidney 
cells (HEK-293) and rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD-1) 
were obtained from the Biomedical Research Centre 
(University of East Anglia, UK). Human melanoma cells 
were cultured as previously described [29]. HEMa-LP cells 
were cultured in Medium-254 (Gibco) with the addition 
of PMA-Free Human Melanocyte Growth Supplement-2 
(HMGS-2; Gibco). HEK-293 cells were cultured in 
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) + GlutMAX 
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 
penicillin and streptomycin. RD-1 cells were cultured in 
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) + GlutMAX 
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin and 
streptomycin. All cells were maintained at 37° C in a 5% 
CO2 air-humidified incubator, were routinely screened for 
mycoplasma and not cultured beyond passage 25. 
Cell viability assays
Cells that had been seeded 24 hours earlier on 
poly-L-lysine coated 96-well plates (Sigma-Aldrich) to 
subconfluency, were treated with drugs at the indicated 
concentrations for 72 hours. Cytochalasin D (Sigma 
Aldrich) was used as a positive control. All conditions 
were repeated in triplicate. Cell viability was determined 
on day 5 using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescence assay 
(Promega), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Luminescence from the plate was read on a BMG LabTech 
Omega Series plate reader (data analyzed using OMEGA 
software). Cell viability was calculated as a percentage of 
the mean vehicle control. 
5-Bromo-2ʹ-deoxyuridine (BrdU) proliferation 
assay
A375 melanoma cells were seeded in 12-well plates 
at a density of 10,000 cells and grown on gelatin-coated 
coverslips. After 24 hours leflunomide was added to cells 
at 12.5, 25 or 50 μM (or a vehicle control) for 72 hours. 
Cells were pulsed for 2 hours with BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) 
at a final working concentration of 10 μM. Cells were 
permeabilised in 2N-HCL + 0.5% Triton X-100. Primary 
BrdU antibody diluted 1:100 in 1% goat serum was 
applied and incubated overnight at 4ºC followed by Alexa 
Fluor-488 anti-mouse secondary antibody Cells were 
counterstained with DAPI. Cells were mounted onto slides 
using hydromount and examined under a Zeiss AxioPlan 
2ie widefield microscope with an AxioCam HRm CCD 
camera. Images were analyzed using Image J software.
Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis was carried out as previously 
detailed [30]. In brief, A375 melanoma cells were seeded 
in 24-well plates at a density of 4,600 cells per well. After 
24 hours, the cells were treated with vehicle, 25, 50 and 
100 µM of Leflunomide. After 72 hours, the cells were 
trypsinised and pelleted along with the culture medium. 
Cells were washed in PBS and fixed in ice-cold absolute 
ethanol. Cells were then stained with 200 µl PI/RNase 
A solution (Cell Signalling Technology). Cells were 
analyzed using a BD AccuriTM C6 flow cytometer (BD 
Biosciences) and the data was analyzed using the BD 
AccuriTM C6 Software and FlowJo (FLOWJO, LLC). 
Annexin V apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was assessed using an Annexin V-FITC 
Apoptosis detection kit FITC (eBioscience), according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were 
seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 4,600 cells per 
well. After 24 hours, the cells were treated with vehicle 
or leflunomide (at concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 µM). 
After 72 hours cells were trypsinised, washed in PBS and 
treated with fluorochrome-conjugated Annexin V and 
propidium iodide as indicated in the protocol. Cells were 
analyzed on the BD AccuriTM C6 flow cytometer and the 
data analyzed using the instrument software. 
Western blot analysis
A375 melanoma cells were seeded and treated for 
72 hours in varying drug conditions. Total protein extracts 
were then made using high SDS content lysis buffer 
(60 mM sucrose, 65 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. 3% SDS). 
Protein concentration was determined using the DC protein 
assay (BIORAD). 10 μg of whole-cell protein lysate 
was loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred 
onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). A 
standard Western blot protocol was used for detection of 
the specific proteins as previously described [29].

Mouse xenograft study
8–10-week-old female severe immunodeficiency 
(SCID) mice were purchased from Charles River 
Laboratories. All procedures were performed under UK 
Home Office approved protocols and the University of 
East Anglia local guidelines. Experiments were conducted 
strictly in accordance with the locally approved animal 
handling protocol. 
A total of 3 × 106 M375 melanoma cells were 
injected subcutaneously into 40 SCID mice. After 
approximately 4 weeks when the tumors were palpable, 
the mice were randomized into 4 arms. The 4 arms 
were; vehicle alone, leflunomide alone, selumetinib 
alone and leflunomide and selumetinib in combination. 
There were 10 mice in each arm. The drug regime was 
administered for 12 days. Leflunomide was administered 
by intraperitoneal (IP) injection daily at 7.5 mg/kg. 
Selumetinib was administered by oral gavage (OG) twice 
daily at 30 mg/kg for the first two days and was then 
delivered once daily thereafter. The tumor volume was 
measured every three days with calipers. Tumor volume 
was measured by the formula 0.52 (length × width2). At 
the end of the experiment, the mice were culled and the 
excised tumors were weighed. 
Statistical analysis
Either one- or two-way ANOVA was used to analyze 
statistical significance of the data (as indicated in the 
figure legends), apart from in vivo tumor volume, where 
an unpaired student’s t-test was used. For all in vitro data, 
experiments were repeated a minimum of 3 times. The 
P-value was considered significant as follows; *P < 0.05, 
**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001.
For pharmacological analysis, IC50 values were 
generated using Prism Graphpad software (Graphpad 
Software, Inc.) and calculated using a nonlinear regression 
model. Combinatorial drug synergy was assessed by 
determination of combination index (CI), which was 
calculated using CalcuSyn (Biosoft) software using the 
median effects methods as described by Chou and Talalay 
[31, 32], CI values less than 0.7 indicated synergy, 0.7–0.9 
weak synergy, 0.9–1.1 additivity, 1.1–1.45 indicated weak 
antagonism and greater than 1.45 antagonism.
