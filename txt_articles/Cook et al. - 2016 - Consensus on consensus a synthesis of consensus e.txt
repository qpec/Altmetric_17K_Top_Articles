Abstract
The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing
climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are
consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on
11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global
warming. A survey of authors of those papers (N=2412 papers) also supported a 97% consensus. Tol
(2016 Environ. Res. Lett. 11 048001) comes to a different conclusion using results from surveys of non-
experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those who reject the consensus. We
demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level of consensus correlates with
expertise in climate science. At one point, Tol also reduces the apparent consensus by assuming that
abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global warming (‘no position’) represent non-
endorsement, an approach that if applied elsewhere would reject consensus on well-established
theories such as plate tectonics. We examine the available studies and conclude that the finding of 97%
consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate
scientists and peer-reviewed studies.
1. Introduction
Climate scientists overwhelmingly agree that humans
are causing recent global warming. The consensus
position is articulated by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) statement that ‘human
influence has been the dominant cause of the observed
warming since the mid-20th century’ (Qin et al 2014, p
17). The National Academies of Science from 80
countries have issued statements endorsing the con-
sensus position (table S2). Nevertheless, the existence
of the consensus continues to be questioned. Here we

 summarize studies that quantify expert views and
examine common flaws in criticisms of consensus
estimates. In particular, we are responding to a
comment by Tol (2016) on Cook et al (2013, referred
to as C13). We show that contrary to Tol’s claim that
the results of C13 differ from earlier studies, the
consensus of experts is robust across all the studies
conducted by coauthors of this correspondence.
Tol’s erroneous conclusions stem from conflating
the opinions of non-experts with experts and assum-
ing that lack of affirmation equals dissent. A detailed
technical response to Tol is provided in (S1) where we
specifically address quibbles about abstract ID num-
bers, timing of ratings, inter-rater communication
and agreement, and access to ratings. None of those
points raised by Tol affect the calculated consensus.
Most importantly, the 97% consensus derived from
abstract ratings is validated by the authors of the

who
responded
to
our
survey
(N=2142 papers) and also reported a 97% consensus
in papers taking a position. The remainder of this
paper shows that a high level of scientific consensus, in
agreement with our results, is a robust finding in the
scientific literature. This is used to illustrate and
address the issues raised by Tol that are relevant to our
main conclusion.
2. Assessing expert consensus
Efforts to measure scientific consensus need to identify
a relevant and representative population of experts,
assess their professional opinion in an appropriate
manner, and avoid distortions from ambiguous ele-
ments in the sample. Approaches that have been
employed to assess expert views on anthropogenic
global warming (AGW) include analysing peer-
reviewed climate papers (Oreskes 2004; C13), survey-
ing members of the relevant scientific community
(Bray and von Storch 2007, Doran and Zimmer-
man 2009, Bray 2010, Rosenberg et al 2010, Farns-
worth and Lichter 2012, Verheggen et al 2014,
Stenhouse et al 2014, Carlton et al 2015), compiling
public statements by scientists (Anderegg et al 2010),
and mathematical analyses of citation patterns (Shwed
and Bearman 2010). We define domain experts as
scientists who have published peer-reviewed research
in that domain, in this case, climate science. Con-
sensus estimates for these experts are listed in table 1,
with the range of estimates resulting primarily from
differences in selection of the expert pool, the defini-
tion of what entails the consensus position, and
differences in treatment of no position responses/
papers.
The studies in table 1 have taken various approa-
ches to selecting and querying pools of experts.
Oreskes (2004) identified expressions of views on
AGW in the form of peer-reviewed papers on ‘global
climate change’. This analysis found no papers
rejecting AGW in a sample of 928 papers published
from 1993 to 2003, that is, 100% consensus among
papers stating a position on AGW.
Following a similar methodology, C13 analysed
the abstracts of 11 944 peer-reviewed papers published
between 1991 and 2011 that matched the search terms
‘global climate change’ or ‘global warming’ in the ISI
Web of Science search engine. Among the 4014
abstracts stating a position on human-caused global
warming, 97.1% were judged as having implicitly or
explicitly endorsed the consensus. In addition, the
study authors were invited to rate their own papers,
based on the contents of the full paper, not just the
abstract. Amongst 1381 papers self-rated by their
authors as stating a position on human-caused global
warming, 97.2% endorsed the consensus.
Shwed and Bearman (2010) employed citation
analysis of 9432 papers on global warming and climate
published from 1975 to 2008. Unlike surveys or classi-
fications of abstracts, this method was entirely mathe-
matical and blind to the content of the literature being
examined. By determining the modularity of citation
networks, they concluded, ‘Our results reject the claim
of inconclusive science on climate change and identify
the emergence of consensus earlier than previously
thought’ (p. 831). Although this method does not pro-
duce a numerical consensus value, it independently
demonstrates the same level of scientific consensus on
AGW as exists for the fact that smoking causes cancer.
Anderegg et al (2010) identified climate experts as
those who had authored at least 20 climate-related
publications and chose their sample from those who
had signed public statements regarding climate
change. By combining published scientific papers and
public statements, Anderegg et al determined that
97%–98% of the 200 most-published climate scien-
tists endorsed the IPCC conclusions on AGW.
Other studies have directly queried scientists, typi-
cally choosing a sample of scientists and identifying
subsamples of those who self-identify as climate scien-
tists or actively publish in the field. Doran and Zim-
merman (2009) surveyed 3146 Earth scientists, asking
whether ‘human activity is a significant contributing
factor in changing mean global temperatures,’ and
subsampled those who were actively publishing cli-
mate scientists. Overall, they found that 82% of Earth
scientists indicated agreement, while among the subset
with greatest expertise in climate science, the agree-
ment was 97.4%.
Bray and von Storch (2007) and Bray (2010)
repeatedly surveyed different populations of climate
scientists in 1996, 2003 and 2008. The questions did
not specify a time period for climate change (indeed,
in 2008, 36% of the participants defined the term ‘cli-
mate change’ to refer to ‘changes in climate at any time
for whatever reason’). Therefore, the reported con-
sensus estimates of 40% (1996) and 53% (2003)
(which included participants not stating a view on
AGW) suffered from both poor control of expert

 selection and ambiguous questions. Their 2008 study,
finding 83% agreement, had a more robust sample
selection and a more specific definition of the con-
sensus position on attribution.
Verheggen et al (2014) surveyed 1868 scientists,
drawn in part from a public repository of climate sci-
entists (the same source as was used by Anderegg et al),
and from scientists listed in C13, supplemented by
authors of recent climate-related articles and with
particular effort expended to include signatories of
public statements critical of mainstream climate sci-
ence. 85% of all respondents (which included a likely
overrepresentation of contrarian non-scientists) who
stated a position agreed that anthropogenic green-
house gases (GHGs) are the dominant driver of recent
global warming. Among respondents who reported
having authored more than 10 peer-reviewed climate-
related publications, approximately 90% agreed that
greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of glo-
bal warming.
Stenhouse et al (2014) collected responses from
1854 members of the American Meteorological
Society (AMS). Among members whose area of exper-
tise was climate science, with a publication focus on
climate, 78% agreed that the cause of global warming
over the past 150 years was mostly human, with an
additional 10% (for a total of 88%) indicating the
warming was caused equally by human activities and
natural causes. An additional 6% answered ‘I do not
believe we know enough to determine the degree of
human causation.’ To make a more precise compar-
ison with the Doran and Zimmerman findings, these
respondents were emailed one additional survey ques-
tion to ascertain if they thought human activity had
contributed to the global warming that has occurred
over the past 150 years; among the 6% who received
this question, 5% indicated there had been some
human contribution to the warming. Thus, Stenhouse
et al (2014) concluded that ‘93% of actively publishing
climate scientists indicated they are convinced that
humans have contributed to global warming.’
Carlton et al (2015) adapted questions from Doran
and Zimmerman (2009) to survey 698 biophysical sci-
entists across various disciplines, finding that 91.9% of
them agreed that (1) mean global temperatures have
generally risen compared with pre-1800s levels and
that (2) human activity is a significant contributing
factor in changing mean global temperatures. Among
the 306 who indicated that ‘the majority of my
research concerns climate change or the impacts of cli-
mate change’, there was 96.7% consensus on the exis-
tence of AGW.
The Pew Research Center (2015) conducted a
detailed survey of 3748 members of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to
assess views on several key science topics. Across this
group, 87% agreed that ‘Earth is warming due mostly
to human activity.’ Among a subset of working PhD
Earth scientists, 93% agreed with this statement.
Despite the diversity of sampling techniques and
approaches, a consistent picture of an overwhelming
consensus among experts on anthropogenic climate
change has emerged from these studies. Another
recurring finding is that higher scientific agreement is
associated with higher levels of expertise in climate sci-
ence (Oreskes 2004, Doran and Zimmerman 2009,
Anderegg 2010, Verheggen et al 2014).
3. Interpreting consensus data
How can vastly different interpretations of consensus
arise? A significant contributor to variation in con-
sensus estimates is the conflation of general scientific
opinion with expert scientific opinion. Figure 1
demonstrates that consensus estimates are highly
sensitive to the expertise of the sampled group. An
accurate estimate of scientific consensus reflects the
level of agreement among experts in climate science;
that is, scientists publishing peer-reviewed research on
climate change. As shown in table 1, low estimates of
consensus arise from samples that include non-experts
such as scientists (or non-scientists) who are not
actively publishing climate research, while samples of
experts are consistent in showing overwhelming
consensus.
Tol (2016) reports consensus estimates ranging
from 7% to 100% from the same studies described
above. His broad range is due to sub-groupings of
scientists with different levels of expertise. For
example, the sub-sample with 7% agreement was
selected from those expressing an ‘unconvinced’
position on AGW (Verheggen et al 2014). This selec-
tion criterion does not provide a valid estimate of
consensus for two reasons: first, this subsample was
selected based on opinion on climate change, pre-
determining the level of estimated consensus. Sec-
ond, this does not constitute a sample of experts, as
non-experts were included. Anderegg (2010) found
that nearly one-third of the unconvinced group
lacked a PhD, and only a tiny fraction had a PhD in a
climate-relevant discipline. Eliminating less pub-
lished scientists from both these samples resulted in
consensus values of 90% and 97%–98% for Verheg-
gen et al (2014) and Anderegg et al (2010), respec-
tively. Tol’s (2016) conflation of unrepresentative
non-expert sub-samples and samples of climate
experts is a misrepresentation of the results of pre-
vious studies, including those published by a num-
ber of coauthors of this paper.
In addition to varying with expertise, consensus
estimates may differ based on their approach to studies
or survey responses that do not state an explicit posi-
tion on AGW. Taking a conservative approach, C13
omitted abstracts that did not state a position on AGW
to derive its consensus estimate of 97%; a value shown
to be robust when compared with the estimate derived
from author responses. In contrast, in one analysis,
5
Environ. Res. Lett. 11 (2016) 048002
J Cook et al
 Tol (2016) effectively treats no-position abstracts as
rejecting AGW, thereby deriving consensus values less
than 35%. Equating no-position papers with rejection
or an uncertain position on AGW is inconsistent with
the expectation of decreasing reference to a consensual
position as that consensus strengthens (Oreskes 2007,
Shwed and Bearman 2010). Powell (2015) shows that
applying Tol’s method to the established paradigm of
plate tectonics would lead Tol to reject the scientific
consensus in that field because nearly all current
papers would be classified as taking ‘no position’.
4. Conclusion
Wehave shown that the scientific consensus on AGW is
robust, with a range of 90%–100% depending on the
exactquestion, timing and sampling methodology.This
is supported by multiple independent studies despite
variations in the study timing, definition of consensus,
or differences in methodology including surveys of
scientists, analyses of literature or of citation networks.
Tol (2016) obtains lower consensus estimates through a
flawed methodology, for example by conflating non-
expert and expert views, and/or making unsupported
assumptions about sources that do not specifically state
apositionaboutthe consensus view.
An accurate understanding of scientific consensus,
and the ability to recognize attempts to undermine it,
are important for public climate literacy. Public per-
ception of the scientific consensus has been found to
be a gateway belief, affecting other climate beliefs and
attitudes including policy support (Ding et al 2011,
McCright et al 2013, van der Linden et al 2015). How-
ever, many in the public, particularly in the US, still
believe scientists disagree to a large extent about AGW
(Leiserowitz et al 2015), and many political leaders,
again particularly in the US, insist that this is so.
Leiserowitz et al (2015) found that only 12% of the US
public accurately estimate the consensus at 91%–
100%. Further, Plutzer et al 2016 found that only 30%
of middle-school and 45% of high-school science tea-
chers were aware that the scientific consensus is above
80%, with 31% of teachers who teach climate change
presenting contradictory messages that emphasize
both the consensus and the minority position.
Misinformation about climate change has been
observed to reduce climate literacy levels (McCright
et al 2016, Ranney and Clark 2016), and manufacturing
doubt about the scientific consensus on climate change
is one of the most effective means of reducing accep-
tance ofclimatechangeand support formitigation poli-
cies (Oreskes 2010, van der Linden et al 2016).
Therefore, it should come as no surprise that the most
commonargument used incontrarianop-edsaboutcli-
mate change from 2007 to 2010 was that there is no sci-
entific consensus on human-caused global warming
(Elsasser and Dunlap 2012, Oreskes and Conway 2011).
Thegeneration ofclimate misinformationpersists, with
arguments against climate science increasing relative to
policy arguments in publications by conservative orga-
nisations(Boussalis and Coan 2016).
Consequently, it is important that scientists com-
municate the overwhelming expert consensus on
AGW to the public (Maibach et al 2014, Cook and
Jacobs 2014). Explaining the 97% consensus has been
observed to increase acceptance of climate change
(Lewandowsky
et
al
2013,
Cook
and
Lewan-
dowsky 2016) with the greatest change among con-
servatives (Kotcher et al 2014).
From a broader perspective, it doesn’t matter if the
consensus number is 90% or 100%. The level of scien-
tific agreement on AGW is overwhelmingly high
because the supporting evidence is overwhelmingly
strong.
