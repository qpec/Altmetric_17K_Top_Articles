BACKGROUND
Cabozantinib inhibits tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptors 1, 2, and 3, MET, and AXL, which are implicated in the progression of 
hepatocellular carcinoma and the development of resistance to sorafenib, the stan-
dard initial treatment for advanced disease. This randomized, double-blind, phase 
3 trial evaluated cabozantinib as compared with placebo in previously treated pa-
tients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
METHODS
A total of 707 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive cabozantinib 
(60 mg once daily) or matching placebo. Eligible patients had received previous treat-
ment with sorafenib, had disease progression after at least one systemic treatment 
for hepatocellular carcinoma, and may have received up to two previous systemic 
regimens for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary end point was overall 
survival. Secondary end points were progression-free survival and the objective re-
sponse rate.
RESULTS
At the second planned interim analysis, the trial showed significantly longer overall 
survival with cabozantinib than with placebo. Median overall survival was 10.2 months 
with cabozantinib and 8.0 months with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.76; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.92; P 
= 
0.005). Median progression-free survival 
was 5.2 months with cabozantinib and 1.9 months with placebo (hazard ratio for 
disease progression or death, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.52; P<0.001), and the objective 
response rates were 4% and less than 1%, respectively (P 
= 
0.009). Grade 3 or 4 ad-
verse events occurred in 68% of patients in the cabozantinib group and in 36% in the 
placebo group. The most common high-grade events were palmar–plantar erythro-
dysesthesia (17% with cabozantinib vs. 0% with placebo), hypertension (16% vs. 2%), 
increased aspartate aminotransferase level (12% vs. 7%), fatigue (10% vs. 4%), and 
diarrhea (10% vs. 2%).
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treat-
ment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free sur-
vival than placebo. The rate of high-grade adverse events in the cabozantinib group 
was approximately twice that observed in the placebo group. (Funded by Exelixis;

Cabozantinib in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
T
he rate of death from liver cancer 
is rising faster than the rate of death from 
any other cancer in the United States.1,2 
The systemic treatment options available for most 
cases are limited.3-5 Despite several advances,6-10 
outcomes in the majority of patients remain poor, 
and additional treatment options are needed.
The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
pathway is an established therapeutic target in 
hepatocellular carcinoma, but the clinical benefit 
from targeting this pathway has been modest, 
which suggests that inhibition of additional sig-
naling pathways may improve efficacy.11 Like 
VEGF, the receptor tyrosine kinases MET and AXL 
are induced by tumor hypoxia.12,13 MET and AXL 
play diverse roles in tumor biology, including pro-
motion of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transi-
tion, invasion, and metastasis,14,15 and both kinases 
are implicated in resistance to antiangiogenic 
therapy.16-18 High expression of MET or AXL may 
be associated with poor prognosis in patients 
with hepatocellular carcinoma,19,20 and increased 
MET expression or activation has been associated 
with previous sorafenib treatment in patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma and with sorafenib resis-
tance in preclinical models.21-24
Cabozantinib, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases 
including VEGF receptors 1, 2, and 3, MET, and 
AXL, inhibits tumor growth in murine models 
of hepatocellular carcinoma.23,25 In a phase 2, 
randomized discontinuation trial, cabozantinib 
showed clinical activity in patients with advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma, regardless of whether 
they had received previous treatment with sor 
af-
enib26; median overall survival was 11.5 months 
and median progression-free survival was 5.2 
months. On the basis of these results, we con-
ducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, phase 3 trial to evaluate cabozantinib 
(Cabometyx, Exelixis) in previously treated patients 
with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
Methods
Patients
Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older, 
had received a pathological diagnosis of hepato-
cellular carcinoma that was not amenable to cura-
tive treatment, and had Child–Pugh class A liver 
function (a score of 5 to 6 points out of a possible 
15, with higher scores indicating more advanced 
liver disease; the score is the total of five clinical 
measures of liver function: total bilirubin, serum 
albumin, prothrombin time, ascites, and hepatic 
encephalopathy). Eligible patients had received 
previous treatment with sorafenib and had had 
disease progression after at least one systemic 
treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, but they 
could have received up to two previous systemic 
treatments. Additional inclusion criteria were an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) per-
formance-status score of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, 
with higher scores indicating greater disability), 
adequate hematologic measures, and adequate 
renal function. Patients could not have had pre-
vious treatment with cabozantinib and could not 
have uncontrolled clinically significant illness. Ad-
ditional eligibility criteria are listed in the Supple-
mentary Appendix, available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org.
Trial Design
In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, patients were 
randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive cabo-
zantinib or placebo. Randomization was performed 
at a central location through an interactive re-
sponse system with the use of permuted blocks, 
stratified according to etiologic factor (hepatitis B 
virus [HBV], with or without hepatitis C virus 
[HCV]; HCV without HBV; or other), geographic 
region (Asia or other), and evidence of extrahe-
patic spread of disease, macrovascular invasion, 
or both (yes or no).
Patients received either a 60-mg tablet of cabo-
zantinib or a matched placebo tablet to be taken 
orally once per day. Treatment interruptions and 
dose reductions (to 40 mg and then to 20 mg) 
were used to manage adverse events. Patients 
continued the assigned trial regimen as long as 
they had clinical benefit, as judged by the inves-
tigator, or until they had unacceptable toxic effects. 
Patients were allowed to receive cabozantinib or 
placebo beyond radiographic progression as long 
as they continued to have clinical benefit.
End Points and Assessments
The primary end point was overall survival, de-
fined as the time from randomization to death 
from any cause. Secondary efficacy end points 
were progression-free survival (defined as the time 
from randomization to radiographic progression 
or death from any cause, whichever occurred first) 
and objective response rate (the percentage of pa-
tients with a confirmed complete or partial re-

sponse). Tumors were assessed by computed to-
mography or magnetic resonance imaging at 
baseline and every 8 weeks after randomization; 
assessments were performed until 8 weeks after 
radiographic progression or discontinuation of 
cabozantinib or placebo, whichever occurred later. 
Tumor response and progression were assessed 
by the investigator according to Response Evalu-
ation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 
1.1.27 Safety was evaluated continuously, and the 
severity of adverse events was assessed by the in-
vestigator according to the National Cancer Insti-
tute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events, version 4.0. Results of analyses of phar-
macokinetics, health-related quality of life, and 
biomarkers are not reported here.
Trial Oversight
The protocol (available at NEJM.org) was approved 
by the ethics committee or institutional review 
board at each center, and the trial was conducted 
in accordance with the International Conference 
on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guide-
lines and the principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained 
from every patient. An independent data and 
safety monitoring committee reviewed safety and 
efficacy during the trial. The trial was designed 
by the first and last authors in collaboration with 
the sponsor, and the authors and the sponsor 
were responsible for data collection and analysis. 
The authors vouch for the fidelity of the trial to 
the protocol and for the accuracy and complete-
ness of the data. The first and last authors wrote 
the first draft of the manuscript in collaboration 
with the sponsor. Medical writing support was 
provided by the sponsor.
Statistical Analysis
Up to three analyses of the primary end point of 
overall survival were planned, when approximately 
50%, 75%, and 100% of the expected deaths had 
occurred. We estimated that a sample size of 760 
patients, with a total of 621 deaths, would provide 
the trial with 90% power to detect a hazard ratio 
of 0.76 favoring cabozantinib over placebo, with 
a two-sided log-rank test at a 5% level of signifi-
cance. Assuming a median overall survival of 8.2 
months in the placebo group (as shown in the 
Brivanib Study in HCC Patients at Risk Post 
Sorafenib [BRISK-PS]28) and exponential distribu-
tion, this would correspond to 32% longer median 
overall survival (10.8 months) in the cabozantinib 
group. Inflation of the type 1 error associated 
with interim analyses was controlled with the 
use of the Lan–DeMets O’Brien–Fleming alpha 
spending function.29 If the null hypothesis of no 
difference in overall survival was rejected at ei-
ther the first or second interim analysis, testing 
of secondary end points would proceed, and sub-
sequent analyses of overall survival would not be 
performed.
Efficacy was assessed in all randomly assigned 
patients according to the intention-to-treat prin-
ciple. Safety was assessed in all patients who 
received at least one dose of the trial regimen. 
For time-to-event end points, hypothesis testing 
was performed with the stratified log-rank test 
with adjustment for the stratification factors used 
at randomization; median durations and associat-
ed 95% confidence intervals were estimated with 
the Kaplan–Meier method. Hazard ratios were es-
timated with univariate Cox regression models, 
with the randomized group as the only predictor. 
Hazard ratios for overall analyses were calculated 
from models adjusted for the randomization strat-
ification factors. Hypothesis testing of objective 
response was performed with the Cochran–
Mantel–Haenszel method. All subgroup analyses 
of overall survival and progression-free survival 
were prespecified except those based on extrahe-
patic spread of disease or macrovascular inva-
sion as separate factors and on sorafenib as the 
only previous therapy. For subgroup analyses, no 
adjustments were made for multiplicity, and con-
fidence intervals are considered to be descriptive. 
Hazard ratios for subgroup analyses were calcu-
lated from unstratified models except those cal-
culated for the subgroup of patients whose only 
previous therapy was sorafenib. All analyses were 
performed with SAS software, version 9.1 or higher 
(SAS Institute).
Results
Patients
From September 2013 through September 2017, 
a total of 773 patients underwent randomization 
at 95 centers in 19 countries. As of the data cutoff 
date of June 1, 2017, for the second interim analy-
sis, 707 patients had undergone randomization: 
470 patients had been assigned to receive cabo-
zantinib, and 237 to receive placebo; these patients

Cabozantinib in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
ficacy analyses (Fig. 1). The safety population 
comprised 704 patients: 467 patients who received 
cabozantinib and 237 who received placebo. As of 
the data cutoff date, 73 patients (16%) in the 
cabozantinib group and 26 (11%) in the placebo 
group were still following the assigned trial 
regimen. The most common reason for discon-
tinuation of cabozantinib or placebo was radio-
graphic disease progression. Baseline demo-
graphics and clinical characteristics were balanced 
between the groups (Table 1, and Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). All the patients had 
previously received sorafenib, and 27% had re-
ceived two previous systemic anticancer regimens 
for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
Efficacy
The median overall survival was 10.2 months 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 9.1 to 12.0) in the 
cabozantinib group and 8.0 months (95% CI, 6.8 
to 9.4) in the placebo group (Fig. 2A). The strati-
fied hazard ratio for death was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.63 
to 0.92), and the stratified log-rank P value was 
0.005, which met the criterion for statistical sig-
nificance. Overall survival was significantly lon-
ger with cabozantinib than with placebo at the 
second planned interim analysis, which had a data 
cutoff date of June 1, 2017, and included 484 
deaths, representing 78% of the 621 deaths 
planned for the prespecified final analysis. The 
stopping boundary according to the prespecified 
alpha-spending function was a P value of 0.02. 
Landmark estimates of overall survival according 
to the Kaplan–Meier method at 6, 12, 18, and 24 
months showed a higher percentage of patients 
alive in the cabozantinib group than in the pla-
cebo group at each time point (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). As of June 2017, a 
total of 123 patients (26%) in the cabozantinib 
group and 78 (33%) in the placebo group had 
received subsequent systemic or local liver-directed 
anticancer therapy that did not include radiation 
(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). These 
overall survival results are consistent with the 
findings of the first interim analysis, which had 
a data cutoff date of June 2016 and included 321 
patient deaths, representing 52% of the 621 deaths 
planned for the prespecified final analysis. At that 
time point, the observed hazard ratio for death 
was 0.71 and the P value was 0.0041, which did 
not cross the stopping boundary for the first in-
terim analysis (P 
= 
0.0037).
The median progression-free survival accord-
ing to RECIST, version 1.1, as assessed by the in-
vestigator, was 5.2 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 5.5) in 
the cabozantinib group and 1.9 months (95% CI, 
1.9 to 1.9) in the placebo group. The stratified 
hazard ratio for disease progression or death was 
0.44 (95% CI, 0.36 to 0.52; P<0.001 by stratified 
log-rank test) (Fig. 2B). The objective response 
rate according to RECIST, version 1.1, was 4% 
(18 partial responses among 470 patients) in the 
cabozantinib group and less than 1% (1 partial 
response among 237 patients) in the placebo 
group (P 
= 
0.009) (Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Disease control (defined as a partial 
response or stable disease) was achieved in 64% 
of the patients (300 patients) in the cabozantinib 
group, as compared with 33% (79 patients) in 
the placebo group.
Subgroup analyses of progression-free survival 
consistently favored cabozantinib, which showed 
the clinical activity of cabozantinib across sub-

groups of patients with various etiologic factors 
and demographic characteristics (Fig. 3, and Table 
S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The results for 
overall survival across subgroups were more vari-
able. In the subgroup of patients whose only previ-
ous systemic therapy was sorafenib, the median 
overall survival was 11.3 months with cabozan-
tinib and 7.2 months with placebo (stratified haz-
ard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.88), 
and the median progression-free survival was 
5.5 months with cabozantinib and 1.9 months 
with placebo (stratified hazard ratio for disease 
progression or death, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.50).
Safety
The median duration of receipt of the trial drug 
or placebo was 3.8 months in the cabozantinib 
group and 2.0 months in the placebo group. Dose 
reductions occurred in 291 patients (62%) in the 
cabozantinib group and in 30 patients (13%) in 
the placebo group. The median average daily dose 
was 35.8 mg for cabozantinib and 58.9 mg for 
placebo, with a median time to first dose reduc-
tion of 38 days in the cabozantinib group. The 
rate of discontinuation of cabozantinib or placebo 
owing to adverse events that were considered to 
be related to the trial regimen was 16% (76 pa-
tients) in the cabozantinib group and 3% (7 pa-
tients) in the placebo group. Adverse events leading 
to treatment discontinuation in more than 1.0% 
of patients in the cabozantinib group were pal-
mar–plantar erythrodysesthesia, fatigue, decreased 
appetite, diarrhea, and nausea.
Adverse events of any grade regardless of cau-
sality were reported in 99% of the patients in the 
cabozantinib group and in 92% in the placebo 
group, and adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were 
reported in 68% of the patients in the cabozantinib 
group and in 36% in the placebo group (Ta-
ble 2). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse 
events in the cabozantinib group were palmar–
plantar erythrodysesthesia (17%, vs. 0% with 
placebo), hypertension (16% vs. 2%), increased 
aspartate aminotransferase level (12% vs. 7%), 
fatigue (10% vs. 4%), and diarrhea (10% vs. 2%). 
The most common adverse events of any grade 
leading to dose reductions in the cabozantinib 
group were palmar–plantar erythrodysesthesia 
(22%), diarrhea (10%), fatigue (7%), hypertension 
(7%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase 
level (6%). Serious adverse events were reported 
in 50% of the patients who received cabozan-
tinib and in 37% of the patients who received 
placebo. A serious adverse event was defined as 
an adverse event of any grade that caused death, 
was life-threatening, resulted in hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization, was deemed 
medically important, or resulted in disability or 
birth defect. Grade 5 adverse events occurring 
within 30 days after the last dose of cabozantinib 
or placebo were reported in 55 patients (12%) in

Cabozantinib in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
the cabozantinib group and in 28 (12%) in the 
placebo group and were commonly related to dis-
ease progression. Grade 5 adverse events that were 
considered to be related to cabozantinib or pla-
cebo were reported in 6 patients in the cabozan-
tinib group (one event each of hepatic failure, 
bronchoesophageal fistula, portal-vein thrombosis, 
upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pulmonary em-
bolism, and the hepatorenal syndrome) and in 
1 patient in the placebo group (hepatic failure).
Discussion
This randomized, phase 3 trial showed that 
cabozantinib treatment significantly prolonged 
survival in patients with previously treated ad-
vanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The median 
overall survival was 10.2 months with cabozan-
tinib and 8.0 months with placebo, with a haz-
ard ratio for death of 0.76. Corresponding to this 
survival benefit, a longer duration of progression-
free survival was also observed: the median pro-
gression-free survival was 5.2 months with cabo-
zantinib and 1.9 months with placebo, with a 
hazard ratio for disease progression or death of 
0.44. Subgroup analyses of progression-free sur-
vival suggested that cabozantinib had clinical 
activity across subgroups of patients with various 
etiologic factors and across subgroups with other 
baseline characteristics. Subgroup analyses of over-
all survival were more variable, with broader con-
fidence intervals. Hazard ratios in subgroups can 
be affected by statistical variability from evalua-
tion of smaller populations or imbalances in 
prognostic factors or subsequent anticancer thera-
pies. It is noteworthy that in an analysis of over-
all survival, the hazard ratio for death was 0.69 
in patients with disease caused by HBV and 1.11 
in patients with HCV, and the hazard ratio for 
death was 0.86 in patients of Asian race but 1.01 
in patients enrolled in Asia. Further analyses are 
necessary to help understand these differences.
The safety results for cabozantinib were con-
sistent with results from an earlier phase 2 study 
involving patients with hepatocellular carcinoma26 
and with the known safety profile of cabozantinib. 
The most common adverse events were similar to 
those observed with other VEGF-receptor tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors in patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Adverse events were managed with 
dose modifications and supportive care. Dose re-
ductions occurred in the majority of patients, and 
the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events 
from cabozantinib or placebo was 16%. The medi-
an average daily dose of cabozantinib was 35.8 mg, 
which was similar to the median dose (43 mg) 
received in a phase 3 trial involving patients with 
advanced renal-cell carcinoma, which also showed 
therapeutic efficacy.30

hepatocellular carcinoma. Because the survival of 
patients who have hepatocellular carcinoma with 
Child–Pugh liver disease of class B or worse is 
determined by liver failure, and it may be impos-
sible to discern any effect of treatment on the 
cancer, it is justified to exclude these patients 
from pivotal clinical trials. Thus, as with all other 
agents approved for treatment of hepatocellular 
carcinoma, additional studies are required to con-
firm the safety and efficacy of cabozantinib in 
patients with more compromised liver function 
or poorer performance status.
MET expression has been shown to increase 
in tumors after sorafenib exposure in patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma, which underscores a 
possible role for MET in the development of 
sorafenib resistance.21,22 Tivantinib, an allosteric 
inhibitor of MET, was evaluated in a phase 3 trial 
involving patients pretreated with sorafenib who 
had high tumor MET expression, but it did not 
result in longer overall survival or progression-
free survival than placebo.22 By inhibiting MET 
and AXL in addition to VEGF receptors, cabozan-
tinib targets multiple oncogenic and angiogenic 
pathways, which may provide additional efficacy 
and help overcome resistance to agents that tar-
get VEGF receptors.14-18,23,24 Cabozantinib also im-
proved clinical outcomes in patients with advanced 
renal-cell carcinoma after previous antiangiogenic 
therapy, which further supports a role for target-
ing MET and AXL in overcoming resistance to 
VEGF-pathway inhibition.30,31
In conclusion, treatment with cabozantinib, a 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets MET, VEGF 
receptors, and AXL, resulted in longer overall sur-
vival and progression-free survival than placebo in 
patients with previously treated advanced hepa-
tocellular carcinoma. Adverse events were consis-
tent with the known safety profile of cabozantinib, 
and the rate of high-grade adverse events in the 
cabozantinib group was approximately twice that 
observed in the placebo group.
