In Brief
Combining optogenetics and
photopharmacology, Johnston et al.
show that a few (1%–10%) b cells exert
disproportionate control over islet
responses to glucose. These specialized
cells, called hubs, are transcriptionally
immature and highly metabolic. Their
failure during type 2 diabetes mellitus
may lead to reduced insulin secretion and
impaired glucose homeostasis.

SUMMARY
The arrangement of b cells within islets of Langerhans
is critical for insulin release through the generation
of rhythmic activity. A privileged role for individual
b cells in orchestrating these responses has long
been suspected, but not directly demonstrated.
We show here that the b cell population in situ is
operationally heterogeneous. Mapping of islet func-
tional architecture revealed the presence of hub cells
with pacemaker properties, which remain stable
over recording periods of 2 to 3 hr. Using a dual opto-
genetic/photopharmacological
strategy,
silencing
of
hubs
abolished
coordinated
islet
responses
to glucose, whereas specific stimulation restored
communication patterns. Hubs were metabolically
adapted and targeted by both pro-inflammatory and
glucolipotoxic insults to induce widespread b cell
dysfunction. Thus, the islet is wired by hubs, whose
failure may contribute to type 2 diabetes mellitus.
INTRODUCTION
The release of insulin from pancreatic b cells is necessary for
proper glucose homeostasis in mammals. b cells respond to
glucose with increased oxidative metabolism, elevations in cyto-
solic ATP/ADP ratio, and closure of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP)
channels (Rutter et al., 2015). The consequent plasma mem-
brane depolarization activates voltage-dependent Ca2+ chan-
nels (VDCCs), leading to Ca2+ influx and exocytosis of secretory
granules (Rutter et al., 2015).
The 3D organization of b cells is also important for the normal
regulation of insulin secretion. Thus, b cells throughout the islet
microorgan display rhythmic activity patterns in the presence of
high glucose (Benninger et al., 2008; Santos et al., 1991). A role
for specialized b cells in orchestrating these dynamics has long
been postulated, including the presence of putative ‘‘pace-
makers’’ (Amma
¨ la
¨ et al., 1991; Benninger et al., 2014; Squires
et al., 2002). Indeed, isolated b cells possess discrete meta-
bolic characteristics and secretory profiles (Katsuta et al.,
2012; Kiekens et al., 1992; Salomon and Meda, 1986), and
phase lags in the onset of electrical activity can be detected
between distant islet regions (Benninger et al., 2008; Meda
et al., 1984; Palti et al., 1996). More recent studies have re-
vealed functional differences between hundreds of individual
b cells monitored in situ in the intact islet (Hodson et al.,
2013; Li et al., 2011; Sto�
zer et al., 2013). Such heterogeneity
may be relevant for type 2 diabetes pathogenesis, since spe-
cific insults might target single cells or defined islet regions to
induce insulin secretory failure. However, whether particular
subsets of cells drive the behavior of others has so far been
difficult to prove empirically.
Overthepastdecade,optogeneticshasallowedreversiblecon-
trol of neuronal activity with light (Zhang et al., 2007). In parallel,
photopharmacology has harnessed the power of azobenzene
photoresponsive units to produce exogenously applied com-
pounds that turn ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors
into endogenous photoswitches (Broichhagen et al., 2015). As
both these approaches are applicable to electrically excitable
endocrine tissue (Broichhagen et al., 2014; Reinbothe et al.,
2014), they afford the unique opportunity to precisely manipulate
cell activity with high spatiotemporal fidelity. Using all-optical
interrogation of individual b cells in situ, we therefore set out to
probe the topology that regulates population glucose responsive-
ness, with the aim of identifying the islet-resident pacemaker.

 RESULTS
Hubs Are a Feature of b Cell Population Dynamics
To visualize the large-scale organization of b cell activity under-
lying calcium (Ca2+)-dependent exocytosis of insulin granules,
intact mouse islets were subjected to high-speed (2–8 Hz) multi-
cellular Ca2+ imaging (Hodson et al., 2012). This was combined
with Monte Carlo-based correlation analyses in which repeated
shuffling of Ca2+ events (>9,999 iterations) is used to determine
whether cells are coordinated due to chance or not (i.e., contrib-
uting to the same insulin release event). Together, these ap-
proaches allow online mapping of the islet functional circuitry.
Initial experiments confirmed that b cells form a scale-free
network (Sto�
zer et al., 2013), which supports the synchronous
propagation of glucose (11 mM)-stimulated Ca2+ waves by effi-
ciently connecting distant islet regions (R2 = 0.72; Figure 1A).
Scale-free networks are ubiquitous throughout biology, are iden-
tified by their power law link-probability distribution (Hodson
et al., 2010), and adopt a hub and spoke formation where a
few cells possess the majority of connections. Accordingly, a
stereotypical feature of such topology in islets was the non-
random appearance of rare super-connected hubs, whose firing
activity tended to repetitively precede and outlast that of the
remainder of the population (i.e., was pacemaker-like) (Figures
1B and 1C) (Movie S1).
Such islet architecture was dependent on information ex-
changes through gap junctions, since reversible blockade of
connexin channels using 18a-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGA) (Farns-
worth et al., 2014) reduced the number of hubs, decreased
coordinated population activity, and increased signal propaga-
tion path length (Figures 1D–1G). This may reflect the inability
to identify hubs due to loss of cell-cell entrainment, as well as
re-routing of information over longer distances by the remain-
ing hubs. Notably, no differences in the amplitude of Ca2+ rises
were seen in control and AGA-treated tissue (Figures S1A–
S1C), suggesting minimal impact upon VDCC activity. In all
cases, parallel experiments were performed using glycyrrhizic
acid (BGA), the inactive precursor of AGA that exerts similar
non-specific effects (Desarme

(A) At elevated glucose (11 mM), islets house a scale-free network where a few
(<10%) b cells host the majority of correlated links (p < 0.01), as shown by the
power law-fitted probability distribution (LC, low connectivity range; HC, high
connectivity range) (R2 = 0.72) (n = 12 recordings from five animals). A log-log
scale is used to convert the power law into a linear relationship.

(C) Representative trace showing that hub (red) activity tends to precede and
outlast that of follower cells (gray) (mean lag value calculated from n = 5 re-
cordings from three animals).
(D) Treatment of islets with the gap junction blocker 18a-glycyrrhetinic acid
(AGA; 20 mM) (left), but not its inactive analog glycyrrhizic acid (BGA; 20 mM)
(right) reduces the proportion of hubs (n = 9 recordings from five animals)
(before, islet in control buffer; after, same islet in the presence of either AGA
or BGA).

(F and G) Gap junction blockade increases the length between correlated links
(n = 9 recordings from five animals).
(H) Wiring patterns are statistically stable upon re-recording after 30 min, as
determined against the same islet but with enforced dissimilarity (n = 8
recordings from five animals).
(I) Wiring patterns are statistically stable upon re-recording after 30 min (Fluo2)
and 3 hr (GCaMP6), as compared to the randomly shuffled correlation matrix
for each islet (n = 4–6 recordings from two to three animals).

mouse and human islets, as shown by the exponent values (k) for the fitted

(F) b cell population Ca2+-spiking activity can be repeatedly silenced following exposure to l = 561 nm (n = 3 recordings).
(G) Global silencing (l = 561 nm) induced a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) throughout the islet, whereas a diffraction-limited laser
(l = 589 nm) only silenced [Ca2+]i in the targeted area (n = 3 recordings).
(H) Silencing can be overcome using the depolarizing agent KCl 30 mM to re-activate VDCC (n = 6 recordings).

 versus a third experiment subjected to either randomization (i.e.,
to re-distribute the wiring pattern) or enforced-dissimilarity
(i.e., to form a different wiring pattern) (Figures 1H and 1I).
Network indices were unaffected in the presence of either a spe-
cific glucagon receptor antagonist (Figures S1I and S1J) or a
glucagon-neutralizing antibody (Figures S1K and S1L), suggest-
ing that any glucagon present in vitro is unlikely to influence hub
function. Hinting at a conserved role for hub architecture, islet
functional topologies were similar in glucose-stimulated mouse
and human islets, as shown by the similar link-probability distri-
butions (i.e., both are fitted with a power law of near-identical
exponent value) (Figure 1J). However, synchrony tended to be
compartmentalized into subregions/clusters in human islets
(Figure 1J), in line with the different structural arrangement of b
versus a cells in this species (Bosco et al., 2010). b cell Ca2+ re-
sponses were not dependent on orientation toward the islet cen-
ter or periphery (DY Fluo2 = 0.14 ± 0.01 versus 0.13 ± 0.004 AU,
periphery versus center, respectively), and identical results were
obtained using the geneticall encoded indicator GCaMP6 (Fig-
ures 1K and 1L), engineered to interfere less with intracellular
Ca2+ levels.
A Strategy for All-Optical Interrogation of b Cell
Function
To functionally dissect the role of hubs, an optogenetic strategy
was developed and validated, enabling electrical silencing
following Ins1Cre-directed expression of the light-gated chloride
(Cl�) pump halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) (Zhang et al., 2007) in
b cells (Figures 2A and 2B). This approach allowed the reversible
silencing of single b cell or population Ca2+-spiking activity and
extracellular Ca2+ influx following illumination (l = 560–590 nm)
(Figures 2C–2G) (Movies S2, S3, and S4). Application of the de-
polarizing agent potassium chloride was able to overcome
silencing by restoring VDCC activity (Figure 2H). Of note, wild-
type b cells were refractory to silencing (Figures 2I and 2J),
and eNPHR3.0-expressing b cells under irradiation were not
further hyperpolarized using diazoxide to force open KATP chan-
nels (Figure 2K). As measured using patch-clamp electrophysi-
ology, illumination induced photocurrents (Figure 3A), leading
to membrane hyperpolarization and electrical silencing only in
eNPHR3.0-expressing b cells (Figures 3B–3D). Thus, specific
and powerful optogenetic silencing could be achieved.
Animals harboring a single eNpHR3.0 allele unexpectedly
demonstrated improved glucose tolerance compared to wild-
type littermates, despite normal insulin sensitivity (Figures 4A–
4F) and body weight/growth curves (Figures 4G and 4H). This
was probably due to enhanced in vivo insulin secretion (Fig-
ure 4I), as b cell mass was apparently normal (Figure 4J). Activa-
tion of eNpHR3.0 on an Ins1Cre background also led to similar
results, suggesting that alternation in insulin gene dosage in
the context of the transgene was unlikely to be a contributing
mechanism (Figures 4K and 4L). Pertinent to the in vitro studies
here, however, isolated islets responded normally to glucose in
terms of ionic fluxes and insulin release (Figures S2A–S2I), and
eNpHR3.0 does not possess basal activity in the absence of light
(Zhang et al., 2007) (also shown in Figure 3C).
Hubs Orchestrate b Cell Population Responses to
Glucose
By performing analysis in real-time using islets maintained on the
microscope stage, hubs could be identified and subsequently
manipulated (Figures 5A–5C). Silencing of individual hubs using
a pinpointing laser had catastrophic consequences for coordi-
nated islet responses to high glucose (Figures 5D and 5E) (Movies
S5 and S6), an effect reversed simply by ceasing illumination (Fig-
ures 5F and5G).Thestrength of inhibition following targeting of in-
dividual hubs tended to be inversely associated with the number
of these cells per islet before silencing (Figure S2J), suggesting
that some redundancy is present in the system, most likely
due to follower cells being controlled by more than one hub. By
contrast, silencing of individual non-hub or follower cells did not
significantly perturb islet dynamics (Figure 5H), demonstrating
the specificity of the approach.

 Using a similar technique, hubs were first identified at high
glucose, before inactivation using low glucose and stimulation
with JB253, an exogenously applied KATP channel photoswitch
based on glimepiride (Broichhagen et al., 2014). Following
targeted illumination of JB253-treated islets, hub connectivity

determined by the presence of glucose-
and gap-junction-dependent entrainment
patterns in follower cells (conduction
velocity = 47.0 ± 8.9 mm/s) (Figures 5I–
5K). Such effects were unlikely to stem
from diffusion of active JB253, since this
molecule turns off within milliseconds in
the dark (Broichhagen et al., 2014), and
proximate cells remained unaffected by
hub stimulation (Figures S3A–S3D).
Hubs Are Required for Insulin
Secretion
We were unable to measure insulin secre-
tion accurately from a single islet over the
5 min experimental period used here,
since levels were below the detection sensitivity of current as-
says. Therefore, to link hub activity with hormone release, the
cell-surface-attached fluorescent Zn2+ probe JP-107 (Pancholi
et al., 2014) was instead employed as a surrogate to dynamically
report Zn2+ co-released with insulin from cells at the islet surface,
as previously reported with ZIMIR (Li et al., 2011). Using this
394
Cell Metabolism 24, 389–401, September 13, 2016
 approach, silencing of follower cells or wild-type islets was
without effect, as evidenced by a linear increase in fluorescence
due to Zn2+ accumulation at the probe. By contrast, hub shut-
down or global illumination lowered insulin/Zn2+ release to below
the dissolution rate of the probe (i.e., Zn2+ binding is lower than
Zn2+ removal) (Figure 5L).
While it was not technically possible to directly link hub activity
with pulsatile insulin release, the acetylcholinomimetic carbachol
(Zhang et al., 2008a) was able to accelerate b cell population ac-
tivity (Figure S3E) without altering the proportion of links or hubs
(Figures S3F and S3G). Moreover, rapid imaging performed over
dozens of minutes—i.e, within the range of insulin pulses (Head
et al., 2012)—revealed that hubs are also a feature of population
behavior over longer periods (proportion hubs = 7.1% ± 1.3%;
proportion links = 9.7% ± 2.0%). Since carbachol has been
shown to phase-set activity between islets in vitro (Zhang et al.,
2008a), parasympathetic neurons may plausibly target hubs
in vivo to synchronize islet activity and generate insulin pulses.
Hubs Possess a Characteristic Metabolic Signature
We next sought to understand what makes a hub cell unique.
Islet-wide Ca2+ signals were recorded before metabolic profiling
of the hub population in the same islet using the mitochondrial
potential dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), which
sequesters in active, hypeporlarized mitochondria. Following
stimulation at high glucose, mitochondria in hubs became
more hyperpolarized versus those in non-hubs (Figures 6A and
6B), suggesting increased proton pumping, ATP synthase
activity, and ATP generation (Tarasov et al., 2012). While the
duty cycle (i.e., proportion of time the cell spends ‘‘ON’’) was
slightly increased in hubs compared to non-hubs (Figure 6C),
other activity parameters including Ca2+-spiking amplitude and
frequency were broadly similar (Figures 6D–6F). Spatially, hubs
and non-hubs were intermingled, with no clear preference for
the islet center or periphery detected for either population based
on polar coordinates (angle and distance taken from the islet
center) (Figures 6G and 6H).
Hubs Display Features of both Mature and Immature b
Cells
Using photoactivatable Tag-RFP (PA-TagRFP) to photopaint
single hubs within islets using a 405 nm laser (Figures S4A and
S4B), post hoc immunostaining against a variety of markers of
b cell ‘‘identity’’ (Rutter et al., 2015) could be performed (Figure 6I)
without adversely altering Ca2+ dynamics (Figure S4C). These
studies revealed reduced insulin content, increased glucokinase
(Gck) levels, lowered expression of pancreatic duodenum ho-
meobox-1 (Pdx1), but normal levels of the mitochondrial import
receptor subunit TOM20 homolog (Tomm20) in hubs versus the
rest of the population (Figures 6I and 6J) (Figure S5). The tran-
scription factor NK6 homeobox 1 (Nkx6.1), recently shown to
be required for insulin biosynthesis and b cell proliferation (Taylor
et al., 2013), was almost absent from hubs (Figures 6I and 6J).
Suggesting that hubs are unlikely to represent a multihormonal
(e.g., Glu+, Ins+) population, no co-localization with glucagon
was detected (Figure 6K). Likewise, neurogenin 3 (Ngn3), a b
cell precursor marker, was undetectable at the protein level in
the adult islet, implying that hubs are unlikely to be trapped in
a progenitor state (Figure 6K). Inspection of oversampled and
deconvolved superresolution confocal images revealed no dif-
ferences in mitochondrial distribution/shape or endoplasmic re-
ticulum content in hubs (Figures 6L–6P), although expression of
the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+/ATPase, SERCA2, was
markedly reduced (Figures 6O and 6P).
Suggesting a hyposecretory (or degranulated) nature, insulin
granule numbers were lower in hubs versus non-hubs, despite
a similar distribution (Figures 6Q and 6R). Furthermore, the
area of individual hub cells was comparable to the rest of the
population (range = 122–381 mm2 and 194–355 mm2, non-hubs
versus hubs, respectively), and their shape appeared to be
normal. Consequently, hubs constitute a metabolically adapted,
repurposed subpopulation of b cell that displays features of
immature cells.
Hubs Are Targeted by Diabetic Milieu
Lastly, the robustness of hubs was determined by challenging
islets with cytokine cocktails (IL-1b/IL-6 or IL-1b/TNF-a) to re-
create the pro-inflammatory milieu thought to be associated
with diabetes (O’Neill et al., 2013). Acutely, the application of
cytokines led to a large ramp-up in Ca2+ spiking activity in
the presence of high glucose (Figure S6). However, after
only 2 hr incubation, a collapse in hub cell number was
apparent (Figures 7A and 7B), and this could be viewed in
real-time by recording the same islet left in situ before and
during exposure to cytokine (IL-1b/IL-6) (Figures 7C and 7D).
The cytokine-induced disruption to hub cell function was
further evidenced by a reduction in the number of cells occu-
pying the upper or ‘‘high connectivity’’ region of the link-prob-
ability distribution (Figures 7E and 7F), as shown by a
decrease in the exponent value of the power law fit. This re-
sulted in a dramatic decline in correlated b cell population
function (Figure 7G) due to the presence of fewer and less
well-connected hubs. The actions of cytokines were not ex-
plained by effects on cell viability, as assessed using indices
of necrosis (Figures 7H and 7I) and apoptosis (Figure 7J).
However, 2 hr cytokine exposure decreased mRNA levels of
the major islet gap junction isoform connexin-36 (Gjd2)
3-fold (Figures 7K and 7L), and this was already associated
with a substantial reduction in gap junction plaque number
(Figure 7M), in line with that recently reported using a similar
paradigm (Farnsworth et al., 2015). Likewise, preferential hub
failure was detected in both rodent and human tissue in
response to gluco(lipo)toxic insults (Figures 7N and 7O).
DISCUSSION
b cells are a phenotypically diverse population, presenting a
mosaic of metabolic and electrical activity patterns (Pralong
et al., 1990), which is mirrored at the level of insulin secretory ca-
pacity (Katsuta et al., 2012; Kiekens et al., 1992; Li et al., 2011;
Salomon and Meda, 1986). When viewed as a population, b cells
are often termed a functional syncytium, although a role for cell
heterogeneity in generating multicellular dynamics has been
invoked repeatedly (Benninger and Piston, 2014; Sto�
zer et al.,
2013). Indeed, it has been shown that a subset (�10%–15%)
of b cells may exert a disproportionate influence over islet dy-
namics (Hraha et al., 2014). By combining large-scale functional
cell mapping with optogenetics and photopharmacology, we
Cell Metabolism 24, 389–401, September 13, 2016

 provide here a revised blueprint for islet function whereby a few
pioneer hubs with reduced b cell identity dictate emergent pop-
ulation behavior in response to glucose. Importantly, hub topol-
ogies are a feature of dynamical systems, including cell networks
in the brain and pituitary (Bonifazi et al., 2009; Hodson et al.,
2012), since they are functionally robust at a low wiring cost (Bull-
more and Sporns, 2009) (i.e., the chances of randomly hitting a
hub are low). However, should a hub be specifically targeted,

with optogenetics. First, a diffraction-

laser
spot
(i.e.,
�500 nm) is insufficient to reliably acti-
vate optogenes, and the long excited
state halftime can quickly saturate the
rhodopsin (Rickgauer and Tank, 2009).
Second, commercial lasers are unable
to
deliver
the

nm
excitation
required for eNpHR3.0 activation without
an optical-parametric oscillator (Andre-
sen et al., 2009). By contrast, a single-

(�500 nm) of known absorbance cross-
spectrum
can
be

to
the
surface of the sample, with minimal aber-
ration and steep power drop-off as a
function of 1/distance2. Demonstrating
the high degree of localization of the
effective beam, we were clearly able to photopaint single cells
within an islet and did not see any population silencing when a
follower cell was targeted.
Using patch-clamp recordings of dissociated b cells,eNpHR3.0
activation hyperpolarized membrane potential by �60 mV, in line
with previous reports (Mattis et al., 2012). While photocurrent
size may be underestimated due to the presence of an electro-
chemical gradient, it should be noted that halorhodopsin derives

 energy from photons rather than the ion gradient itself (Pfisterer
et al.,2009),and the photocycle isunaffected even inthe presence
of high Cl� concentration (Va
´ ro
´ et al., 1995). In any case, it
is unlikely that hyperpolarizing spread throughout the islet per se
could account for these observations, since (1) only 30% of
voltage spreads to an immediately coupled cell and an 86 mV de-
polarizing step is required for activation via gap junctions (Zhang
et al., 2008b); and (2) stimulation of follower cells was without
effect. We prefer an explanation whereby large changes in
conductance attributable to the hub cell or its very close neighbors
are removed through eNpHR3.0-mediated silencing, leading
to impaired propagation of Ca2+ waves (Benninger and Piston,
2014; Benninger et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008b). Although mem-
brane potential was slightly more depolarized following cessation
of illumination, this is also seen in neurons (Mattis et al., 2012) and
may reflect the reversal potential of Cl�. We did not notice signif-
icant effects on hub indices during the Ca2+ imaging studies
here due to use of a 5–10 min ‘‘rest’’ period to allow Cl� re-
equilibration.
Experiments in which hub cells were stimulated revealed
that hubs and followers are unlikely to form local syncytia.
While the exact mechanisms for antipodal signal propagation
are difficult to determine precisely, a role for 3D chains of elec-
trically coupled cells is plausible, given that entrainment was
markedly blunted by both gap junction blockade and perfusion
with 1 mM glucose. Other communication possibilities include
autonomic neurons, which possess >100 mm axonal arboriza-
tions in pancreatic slices (Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2012), and
cilia, which provide a restricted signaling corridor due to their
presence in only �25% of b cells (Gerdes et al., 2014). Along
these lines, the effect of hub silencing on islet function was
surprisingly strong, given the relatively mild phenotype of ani-
mals deleted for the gap junction protein connexin36 (Ravier
et al., 2005). However, considerable redundancy exists in the
latter model with connexin-30.2 (Cx30.2) and ephrins providing
alternative signaling routes (Farnsworth and Benninger, 2014;
Konstantinova et al., 2007).
An intriguing possibility is that hubs are related to the previ-
ously described Pdx1+, Ins(low) b cell subpopulation (Szabat
et al., 2009), albeit distinct in their low levels of both markers.
Impaired
identity,
while
conceivably
restraining
stimulus-
induced secretion, may also limit GK-induced proliferation (Porat
et al., 2011; Stolovich-Rain et al., 2015) to maintain the role of
these cells as specialized pacemakers. Indeed, high levels of
GK expression may sensitize hubs cells to increases in glucose
concentration, allowing these cells to respond earlier and more
robustly than their neighbors. By contrast, the failure of hubs
when faced with a gluco(lipo)toxic/pro-inflammatory milieu indi-
cates that these cells are metabolically fragile. This vulnerability
might reflect high Gck/Gck (Roma et al., 2015) expression
coupled to low Pdx1 and SERCA2 levels (Fonseca et al., 2011;
Fujimoto et al., 2009), which ultimately lead to ER stress and
cell dysfunction.
We acknowledge that the hub protein characterization per-
formed here constitutes a biased screen, but it nonetheless pro-
vides a strong foundation for understanding the biology of these
unusual cells. In the future, unbiased multiplex approaches,
including massive parallel sequencing (RNASeq) and CyTOF
(single cell mass cytometry) (Proserpio and Lonnberg, 2015),
will help define the hub signature. Although attempts were
made to obtain dissociated cells/cytoplasm for these purposes,
PA-TagRFP fluorescence disappeared following dissociation
of islets, possibly reflecting either the fragility of these cells,
or the fluorophore itself. Similar problems were encoun-
tered with electron microscopy, where available antibodies
cannot differentiate between activated and non-activated PA-
TagRFP.
The recording approaches used to monitor hubs were techni-
cally constrained to 2 to 3 hr. Indeed, such experiments neces-
sitate leaving the islets in situ on the microscope, since the
same field of view must be maintained for analysis purposes.
Thus, it cannot be excluded that hubs may represent a transitory
subpopulation that drifts over dozens of hours in line with tran-
scriptional/translational processes. Indeed, modeling studies
predict that ‘‘pacemakers’’ arise from the most excitable b cell,
which is assumed to shift due to a random distribution of excit-
ability as KATP channel expression levels vary (Benninger et al.,
2014). However, the possibility that such cells may arise during
development could not be excluded (Benninger et al., 2014),
and studies in FACS-purified GFP-labeled b cells suggest the
presence of distinct transcriptional pools, with the proportions
remaining similar between animals and days (Katsuta et al.,
2012). Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is no evi-
dence that KATP channel levels change over time, though the
presence of a substantial proportion of channel subunits on in-
ternal membranes (Varadi et al., 2006) may complicate such
measures.
Lastly, it should be noted that experiments in isolated islets
may not necessarily reflect the situation in vivo, where blood
flow direction (b cell/a cell) (Nyman et al., 2008) and molecule
access dynamics (Michau et al., 2015) may all affect the role of
hubs in dictating population dynamics and insulin secretion.
This possibility might be tested in the future using in vivo imaging
approaches (Nyman et al., 2008; Speier et al., 2008).
In summary, the present findings provide new insights into the
regulation of islet function by individual b cells and the mecha-
nisms that likely target and impair this during type 2 diabetes
pathogenesis and treatment. More generally, the paradigm
developed here to study the roles of individual cells within the
functioning islet may be broadly applicable to other tissues or
organisms.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals, Glucose/Insulin Tolerance Testing and Insulin Measures
b-cell-specific expression of halorhodopsin was achieved by crossing
the Ins1Cre deletor strain (Thorens et al., 2015) with animals engineered to
express eNpHR3.0-EYFP following excision of a loxP-flanked STOP cass-
ette (B6;129S-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm39(CAG-hop/EYFP)Hze/J). Ins1Cre+/� and
Ins1Cre�/� littermates (i.e., derived from an Ins1Cre�/� 3 Ins1Cre+/� breeding
pair) display similar glucose tolerance and growth curves (Thorens et al., 2015),
as well as insulin tolerance, in vivo and in vitro insulin secretion, and b cell
mass (Figure S7). For detailed information, see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Islet Isolation
Islets were isolated using collagenase digestion and cultured for 24–72 hr in
RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin,
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin.

Cell Metabolism 24, 389–401, September 13, 2016
 Human Islet Culture
Human islets were obtained from isolation centers in Italy and Switzerland,
with necessary local and national ethical permissions, including consent
from the next of kin. Islets were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 mg/ml
fungizone, supplemented with 5.5 mM D-glucose. Ethical approval was
granted by the National Research Ethics Committee London (Fulham),
REC #07/H0711/114.
Calcium and Mitochondrial Potential Imaging
Multicellular Ca2+ and mitochondrial potential imaging was performed as
detailed in Hodson et al. (2013). Mitochondrial potential was monitored using
TMRE. For detailed information, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Electrophysiology
Pancreatic islets were dissociated into single b cells and plated onto glass cov-
erslips. Electrophysiological recordings were performed in either perforated
patch-clamp or whole-cell configuration using an EPC9 patch-clamp amplifier
controlled by Pulse acquisition software (HEKA). For detailed information, see
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Dynamic Insulin Secretion Measures
Zinc (Zn2+) co-released from insulin-containing granules was measured as a
proxy for insulin secretion using the chemical probe JP-107 (300 mM), as
described in Pancholi et al. (2014). For detailed information, see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Generation of Adenoviral PA-TagRFP and Photopainting
cDNA encoding the photoactivatable fluorescent protein PA-TagRFP (Subach
et al., 2010) was cloned into pShuttleCMV via Xho 1 and Xba I sites before
recombination with pAdEasy1 and virus production as described in Luo
et al. (2007). Islets were incubated for 48 hr with adenovirus harboring PA-
TagRFP at a MOI = 100. For detailed information, see Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures.

Immunohistochemistry
Islets were fixed at 4�C overnight in paraformaldehyde (4%, wt/vol) before
permeabilization (PBS + Triton 0.1%) and application of primary and second-
ary antibody for 24–48 hr at 4�C. Connexin-36 staining was performed as
above, but following 10 min fixation in ice-cold acetone. For detailed informa-
tion, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

and
fold-
change in mRNA expression compared to control was calculated using
the 2�DDCT.
Correlation, Similarity Analyses and Polar Coordinates
Individual EYFP-expressing b cells were identified using an ROI to produce
a mask overlay of the imaged population. Correlation analyses were then per-
formed in MATLAB on Hilbert-Huang transformed Ca2+ signals using binariza-
tion and matrix analyses, and statistical significance assigned using non-
deterministic (Monte-Carlo) methods, as described (Hodson et al., 2010,
2012). For detailed information, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

For detailed information, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Cytokines and Glucolipotoxicity
Interleukin 1 b (IL-1b), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a)
(all from R&D Biosystems) were stored as stock solutions at �20�C and used at
20 pg/ml, 40 pg/ml, and 20 pg/ml, respectively (Maedler et al., 2004; O’Neill
et al., 2013). For gluco(lipo)toxicity studies, cells were exposed to 33 mM
glucose and/or 0.5 mM BSA-conjugated palmitate for 48 hr.
Statistical Analyses
Data normality was assessed using the D’Agostino Pearson omnibus test.
Pairwise comparisons were performed using paired or unpaired Student’s
t test. Interactions between multiple treatments were determined using
one-way or two-way ANOVA (adjusted for repeated-measures as necessary),
followed by pairwise comparisons with Bonferonni’s or Tukey’s posthoc tests.
Analyses were conducted using R (R Project), Graphpad Prism 6.0 (Graphpad
Software), IgorPro (Wavemetrics), and MATLAB (Mathworks), and results
deemed significant at p < 0.05. Unless otherwise stated, data are presented
as the mean ± SEM.
