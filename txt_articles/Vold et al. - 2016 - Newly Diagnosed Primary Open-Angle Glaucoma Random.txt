INTRODUCTION
Traditionally, treatment for newly diagnosed
open-angle glaucoma (OAG) has started with
topical ocular hypotensive medical therapy,
followed
by
laser
trabeculoplasty.
These
approaches have a lower risk profile than
filtering or drainage device surgery. Further,
these modalities preserve ocular tissues in
case
more
invasive
surgery
is
eventually
required.
Despite these advantages, the efficacy of
medical and laser therapy is limited. Various
factors may hinder the proper use of topical
medications, such as side effects (e.g., ocular
hyperemia, iris hyperchromia, and periorbital
atrophy),
cost,
intolerance
to
topical
medications,
and
difficulty
with
drop
instillation
[1,
2].
In
addition,
patient
adherence to medical therapy is frequently
documented to be low [3–6]. In one study of
28,741 patients are naı
¨ve to glaucoma therapy,
for example, 70% of patients discontinued their
therapy after 1 year [3]. Such non-compliance
limits the actual vs. expected effect of medical
therapy and can increase the risk of disease
progression,
cost
to
patients,
and
cost
to
providers [7]. Laser procedures do not share
the same challenges as topical medications, but
their efficacy may be limited by short-term
inflammation and long-term attrition [8].
Surgical
methods
addressing
outflow
via
Schlemm’s canal have evolved over the last
15–20 years, from ab externo procedures such as
trabeculectomy
and
viscocanalostomy
to
modern
ab
interno
procedures
such
as
trabecular
micro-bypass
stent
implantation
during
micro-invasive
glaucoma
surgery
(MIGS) [9]. In particular, the iStent (iStent�
Trabecular Micro-Bypass, Glaukos Corporation,
Laguna
Hills,
CA,
USA)
is
a
first-in-class
treatment
for
mild-moderate
OAG
and
is
commercially available in the United States
and 28 other countries [10]. Implantation of a
single
iStent
in
conjunction
with
cataract
surgery
has
been
shown
to
safely
lower
intraocular
pressure
(IOP)
and
medication
usage through up to 5 years postoperatively in
patients with glaucoma and cataract [11–17].
Implantation of multiple iStent devices during
cataract surgery or as a standalone procedure
also has shown effectiveness though up to
3 years
postoperatively
in
patients
with
162
Ophthalmol Ther (2016) 5:161–172
 glaucoma
not
controlled
on
previous
medication
regimens
[18–21].
MIGS
with
trabecular micro-bypass stents offers a highly
favorable
safety
profile
compared
to
more
invasive
traditional
incisional
glaucoma
surgery or more recent suprachoroidal stent
procedures [22–24].
To date, reports of trabecular micro-bypass
stent implantation have focused on patients
with mild to moderate OAG who have received
prior medical or surgical treatment for their
disease [11–22]. Due to its favorable safety and
clinical effectiveness, however, it is possible that
iStent implantation may be a suitable treatment
option
for
patients
with
newly
diagnosed
glaucoma who are naı
¨ve to therapy and who
require treatment long before they undergo
cataract surgery.
To address the potential utility of iStent as
initial therapy in these patients, we conducted a
prospective, randomized study to evaluate the
IOP-lowering effect and complication rates of
implanting
two
iStents
as
a
standalone
procedure
compared
to
primary
medical
therapy in patients recently diagnosed with
OAG who had not undergone prior glaucoma
treatment. An earlier report showed IOP control
and favorable safety through 2 years [25]. The
present report covers outcomes through 3 years.
METHODS
This
study
was
designed
to
enroll
phakic
subjects with newly diagnosed primary OAG
(POAG), pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (PEX), or
ocular hypertension that had not undergone
prior treatment of any kind. Subjects were to
present at the screening exam with IOP C21 and
B40 mmHg, cup to disk (C:D) ratio B0.9, and
normal angle anatomy. The study excluded
subjects
with
uveitic,
neovascular,
or
angle-closure glaucoma; glaucoma associated
with vascular disorders; corneal pathology or
prior corneal surgery; congenital or traumatic
cataract or prior cataract surgery; retinal or optic
nerve
disorders;
or
any
ocular
disease
or
condition
that,
in
the
opinion
of
the
investigator,
would
place
the
subject
at
significant
risk,
confound
study
results,
or
interfere
with
study
participation.
Subjects
with fellow eyes in clinical trials and pregnant
or nursing women also were excluded.
The
study
site
was
the
S.V.
Malayan
Opthalmology Centre in Yerevan, Armenia.
Ethics committee approval was secured for
conduct of the study, and subjects signed
informed consent documents. The study was
conducted
as
per
the
principles
governing
clinical research as set in the Declaration of
Helsinki
1964
(as
revised
in
2013)
and
applicable
ISO/GCP
guidelines.
The
ClinicalTrials.gov registration number for this
study is NCT01443988 [26].
One-hundred qualified subjects were to be
randomized in a 1:1 ratio under an open-label,
unmasked strategy for implantation with either
two iStent devices or topical travoprost (Travatan�
0.004%; Alcon�, Fort Worth, TX, USA). Stents
were implanted by one staff surgeon and a team of
visiting
surgeons
(Appendix
1).
Following
treatment, subjects were scheduled to return for
evaluations at day 1, week 1, and at months 1, 3, 6,
12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54 and 60. Pre-treatment
and
post-treatment
examination
at
each
scheduled visit included measurement of IOP via

 interventions. In the event of elevated IOP (e.g.,
[
21 mmHg)
or
optic
nerve
findings’
(e.g.,
worsened nerve appearance together with visual
field progression) post-treatment, subjects were to
be treated with additional therapy. This included
initiating medical therapy in the stent group and
administering additional medication(s) in the
travoprost group.
The
iStent
device
and
implantation
technique have been described in detail in
previous work [12]. In brief, this single-piece,
titanium,
heparin-coated
device
has
an
L-shaped structure with a snorkel (inlet) on
the short side which resides in the anterior
chamber. The inlet opens to the half-pipe body
which resides in Schlemm’s canal. The stent is
1.0 mm long and 0.33 mm in height. The inlet
is 0.25 mm long
with a bore diameter of
0.12 mm.
The
implant
is
provided
to
the
surgeon pre-loaded in a disposable, single-use,
stainless steel inserter that allows precise stent
insertion ab internally into Schlemm’s canal.
Once implanted, the stent is designed to create
a bypass through the trabecular meshwork to
Schlemm’s canal to improve aqueous outflow
through the physiologic natural pathway with
resultant decrease in IOP.
Travoprost topical ophthalmic solution is a
synthetic prostaglandin F analog. The drug
works
to
increase
uveoscleral
outflow
and
provide
subsequent
IOP
reduction.
In
this
study,
brand-name
Travatan
(Alcon,
Fort
Worth,
TX,
USA)
was
used.
Patients
were
instructed to instill medication once daily in
the evening at 8 pm.
We assessed mean IOP over time in all eyes
regardless of additional medical therapy after
the initial treatment, and mean IOP in eyes
that had not received additional therapy after
their
initial
stent
or
travoprost
treatment.
Additional
efficacy
analysis
included
the
proportion
of
eyes
that
had
postoperative
IOP B18 and B15 mmHg without additional
medical therapy. Analyses of safety consisted
of
assessment
of
adverse
events
and
complications, visual field, C:D ratio, central
corneal
thickness,
and
BCVA
through
the
36-month post-treatment period.
The
randomized
cohort
population
consisted of subjects randomized to treatment
with
two
stents
or
travoprost
(n = 101).
Analyses were performed on available eyes
from the Randomized Cohort preoperatively,
month 12, month 24 and month 36. Mean and
standard deviation values were calculated for
continuous variables.
RESULTS
Subject Accountability, Demographics,
and Pre-Study Parameters
A total of 101 subjects (101 POAG, 1 PEX)
completed the screening examination and were
randomized to treatment with either two stents
or
with
travoprost.
To
eliminate
different
diagnoses as a potential confounder, the one
subject with PEX was excluded from the current
analysis. Of the 101 subjects with POAG, 100
subjects completed follow-up through month
24
and
73
subjects
completed
follow-up
through month 36.
Demographics and pre-treatment parameters
are shown in Table 1. The stent and travoprost
groups were similar in age (64.5 ± 11.1 vs.
62.0 ± 11.3 years, respectively), screening IOP
(25.5 ± 2.5 vs. 25.1 ± 4.6 mmHg), C:D ratio
(0.7 ± 0.2 vs. 0.6 ± 0.1), visual field, central
corneal thickness, and BCVA. There were fewer
males in the 2-stent group (25/54 or 46%) than
in the medication group (32/47 or 68%). All
subjects were Caucasian.

 Efficacy
Subjects experienced notable reduction of IOP
following implantation of two iStent trabecular
micro-bypass
devices
or
administration
of
topical travoprost (Fig. 1). For the stent group,
mean
IOP
reduced
from
25.5 mmHg
preoperatively to 14.6 mmHg at 3 years. For
the travoprost group, mean IOP reduced from
25.1 mmHg preoperatively to 15.3 mmHg at
3 years. By month 12, medication had been
added to 8 subjects (3 in stent group, 5 in
travoprost group) (Table 2). An additional 4 eyes
(2 per group) had medication added at or before
month
24.
By
the
month
36
exam,
an
additional 5 eyes (1 in stent group and 4 in
travoprost group) had medication added to
their original treatment. In the subset of eyes
that did not require additional medical therapy,
mean IOP at 3 years was 14.5 mmHg in the
stent group and 15.7 mmHg in the travoprost
group (Fig. 2).
Proportional
analyses
showed
that
94%,
90%, and 91% of stent-treated eyes had IOP
B18 mmHg without the need for postoperative
medication at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively,
while 89%, 87% and 79% of eyes in the
travoprost group achieved IOP B18 mmHg at
these timepoints without requiring additional
medical therapy. The majority (62%) of stent
eyes
maintained
IOP
B15 mmHg
through
3 years, while a decreasing percentage (21%) of
travoprost eyes maintained IOP B15 mmHg
over the 3-year follow-up period (Fig. 3).
Safety
Safety
was
favorable
in
both
groups.
Two
complications
were
reported
during
stent
insertion in the surgery group, both of which
were attributed to subject movement during
surgery: one of these subjects had hyphema
which resolved by day 1 and one subject had a
small
iridodialysis
which
resulted
in
no
postoperative
ocular
sequelae.
No
other
operative complications were reported.
In general, BCVA was stable over time for
both groups (Fig. 4). Progression of cataract over
the 3-year follow-up period was reported in 11
eyes (20%) in the stent group and 8 eyes (17%)
in the travoprost group. Of these, cataract
surgery was performed in 6 eyes (5 in stent
group and 1 in travoprost group), with last
reported BCVA of 20/40 or better in these
operated eyes. In the remaining non-operated
subjects, three-year BCVA was 20/40 or better in
6 eyes (2 in stent group and 4 in med group),

DISCUSSION
The goal of this prospective, randomized study
was to compare the IOP reduction and safety
profile of two ab interno trabecular micro-bypass
stents
(iStent)
vs.
topical
prostaglandin
medication
in
eyes
with
newly
diagnosed
POAG.
Both
therapies
demonstrated
substantial
IOP
reduction
through
3 years
post-treatment.
Without
starting
additional
medications, IOP B15 mmHg was maintained
in the majority of stent eyes through 3 years of
follow-up, but in only a minority of medication
eyes. In addition, a lower percentage of stent
eyes (11.1%; 6/54) compared to travoprost eyes
(23.4%; 11/47) required additional medication
by 3 years. Both groups had similarly favorable
safety profiles, including stable BCVA, C:D
ratio,
visual
fields,
and
central
corneal
thickness. These data support consideration of
multiple iStent implantations as a first-line
treatment
option
comparable
to
topical
prostaglandin
for
newly
diagnosed
POAG
patients
who
face
decisions
about
the
management of their chronic disease.
Prior studies of trabecular micro-bypass stent
implantation have focused on patients with
mild to moderate OAG who have received
previous medical or surgical treatment [11–18].
There is a relative paucity of glaucoma studies
in newly diagnosed glaucoma patients who are
naı
¨ve to treatment. Thus, the present study
showing
clinical
outcomes
of
2-iStent
implantation in treatment-naı
¨ve eyes fills a
key gap in the literature. These findings may
be increasingly relevant as more surgeons are

pressure
166
Ophthalmol Ther (2016) 5:161–172
 considering
iStent
implantation
as
initial
treatment for their newly diagnosed glaucoma
patients.
iStent implantation as initial therapy may
offer several benefits over topical medications,
whose utility may be limited by issues such as
side
effects
and
patient
compliance
[1–7, 27–30]. Furthermore, the cost of both
brand-name and generic medications places a
considerable financial burden on the newly
diagnosed glaucoma patient [31], thus making
a longstanding surgical solution even more
appealing. This may be particularly important
in glaucoma patients, the majority of whom
have at least one additional chronic condition
requiring medication [32].
In
this
study,
the
IOP
decrease
in
the
travoprost group was greater than the 25–35%
IOP reductions reported in prior work [33–35].
This may be due to medication-naı
¨ve eyes, high
compliance due to study participation, and/or
regression
to
the
mean.

also
may
be
attributed
to
the
pre-treatment

level
(i.e.,
greater
IOP
reduction with higher preoperative IOP), a
phenomenon
which
has
been
reported
previously in both treated and treatment-naı
¨ve
glaucoma patients [35, 36].
There are several limitations to this study.
Given the surgical vs. medical therapy study
design, neither subjects nor clinicians were
masked to treatment. Diurnal measurements
of IOP were not performed. A pre-treatment
grading of the crystalline lens was not used,
and guidelines for when to perform cataract
surgery were not standardized. Future work
could incorporate such measures to address
these
study
limitations,
and
also
could
encompass
postoperative
follow-up
past
3 years.
In
addition,
future
