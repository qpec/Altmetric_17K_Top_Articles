Abstract
Background—In 2014, only 26 states and D.C. chose to implement the Affordable Care Act 
(ACA) Medicaid expansions for low-income adults.
Objective—To estimate whether the state Medicaid expansions were associated with changes in 
insurance coverage, access to and utilization of health care, and self-reported health.
Design—Comparison of outcomes before and after the expansions in states that did and did not 
expand Medicaid.
Setting—U.S.
Participants—Citizens aged 19–64 with family incomes below 138% of the Federal Poverty 
Level in the 2010–2014 National Health Interview Surveys.
Measurements—Health insurance coverage (private, Medicaid, uninsured); health insurance 
better than last year; visits with doctors in general practice and with specialists; hospitalizations 
and ED visits; skipped or delayed medical care; usual source of care; diagnoses of diabetes, high 
cholesterol, and hypertension; self-reported health; and depression.
Results—In the second half of 2014, low-income adults in expansion states experienced 
increased health insurance (7.4 percentage points; 95% CI, −11.3 to −3.4) and Medicaid (10.5 
percentage points; 95% CI, 6.5 to 14.5) coverage, and increased quality of insurance coverage 
compared to a year ago (7.1 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.7 to 11.5) when compared to adults in

 states that did not expand Medicaid. Medicaid expansions were associated with increased visits 
with doctors in general practice (6.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.3 to 12.0), overnight hospital 
stays (2.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.7 to 4.2), and rates of diagnosis of diabetes (5.2 percentage 
points; 95% CI, 2.4 to 8.1) and high cholesterol (5.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.0 to 9.4); 
changes in other outcomes were not statistically significant.
Limitations—Observational study may be susceptible to unmeasured confounders; relies on self-
reported data; limited post-ACA timeframe provides information on short-term changes only.
Conclusions—The ACA Medicaid expansions were associated with higher rates of insurance 
coverage, improved quality of coverage, increased utilization of some types of health care, and 
higher rates of diagnosis of chronic health conditions for low-income adults.
INTRODUCTION
A key component of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was to expand Medicaid eligibility to 
adults earning up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Although this provision was 
originally intended to be enacted in all states, a U.S. Supreme Court decision gave states the 
option of not adopting this expansion. Twenty-four states decided to forego the expansion in 
2014, affecting 6.7 million uninsured low-income adults who would have otherwise gained 
eligibility (1). Although a few states have since chosen to expand Medicaid, twenty states 
have still not adopted the expansion at this time (2).
Little is known regarding the impact of the ACA Medicaid expansions on access to care, 
utilization, and health. This represents a critical gap in knowledge as policymakers continue 
to debate whether to implement this policy. Early studies indicate an increase in insurance 
coverage among low-income adults in states that expanded Medicaid when compared to 
states that did not (3–6). Other investigators have analyzed previous state Medicaid 
expansions for low-income adults and found that these expansions were associated with 
lower mortality, greater coverage and access, higher utilization rates, and better self-reported 
health (7–10). A recent study found that low-income adults in states that expanded Medicaid 
under the ACA were less likely to report having no personal physician or having no easy 
access to medicine compared to those in non-expansion states (6). However, this study did 
not include information on several important outcomes such as the use of health services and 
the diagnosis of chronic conditions. To date, there has been no direct analysis of the effect of 
the ACA Medicaid expansions on health care utilization, and only limited analysis of the 
effect on access and health among those gaining coverage.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN
We used a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design that compared changes in 
outcomes for individuals residing in expansion and non-expansion states before and after the 
2014 ACA Medicaid expansions. Our study period included the four years before the 
expansions (2010–2013) and the first year after (2014). The difference-in-differences 
methodology adjusted for time-invariant differences in characteristics across the expansion 
and non-expansion states, as well as secular changes in outcomes over time. We defined

 expansion states as states implementing the ACA expansion by the end of 2014 with all 
other states serving as controls. With the exception of two states (Michigan and New 
Hampshire), the Medicaid expansions were effective on January 1, 2014. We excluded 5 
states that already provided Medicaid or similar coverage to low-income adults during 2010 
to 2013 (see Appendix Section 1).
DATA
This study used the 2010–2014 years of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a 
nationally representative annual survey conducted by the National Center for Health 
Statistics (NCHS). In this cross-sectional survey, respondents are interviewed throughout the 
survey year. One advantage of this survey is its high response rate of over 70% (11). The 
study sample included non-elderly U.S. citizens (ages 19–64) in families with incomes 
under 138% of the FPL with information on race, ethnicity, age, sex, marital status, and 
educational attainment. Approximately 1% of respondents were excluded from the sample 
due to missing information regarding marital status or educational attainment; 9.5% were 
missing information on family income and received imputed values from multiple 
imputation files provided by NCHS (12). We excluded noncitizens from the analysis since 
only some individuals in this group are eligible for Medicaid (13). Our study used restricted-
access state identifiers in the NHIS and was performed in a Census Research Data Center. 
The study was deemed exempt from review by the investigators’ designated Institutional 
Research Boards.
We defined the post-expansion period to include respondent interviews in the second half of 
2014, rather than all of 2014, because several of the outcome measures asked about 
respondent experiences during the last 12 months. Figure 1 illustrates the timing of this 12-
month look back period for respondents interviewed in the second half of 2014, shaded in 
light grey, relative to the timing of the state ACA Medicaid expansions. For almost all 
respondents, the majority of the 12-month look back period occurs during the period of 
expanded Medicaid eligibility. On average, respondents in expansion states in the second 
half of 2014 had received 8.7 months of exposure to the ACA Medicaid expansions at the 
time of interview.
OUTCOME MEASURES
All outcomes used in the analysis were based on self-reported information in the NHIS. The 
first set of outcomes was related to insurance coverage and health care utilization. Three 
binary coverage variables indicated no insurance coverage (defined as coverage through 
Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, military, or other government programs excluding 
the Indian Health Service), Medicaid coverage, and private health insurance coverage at the 
time of interview. Additionally, we examined whether respondents reported that their health 
insurance or health care coverage was better than one year ago. This last measure was not 
available for the 2010 survey year. The utilization measures were whether the respondent: 
saw or spoke to a doctor in a general practice, family medicine, or internal medicine; saw or 
spoke to a medical specialist (excluding obstetrician/gynecologist, psychiatrist, and 
opthamologist); was hospitalized overnight (excluding in the emergency department (ED)); 
or went to a hospital ED during the past 12 months.

 We next considered outcomes related to access, diagnoses of health conditions, and self-
reported health. To measure access, we used two binary variables that indicated whether the 
respondent failed to obtain needed medical care due to cost or delayed care because of worry 
about cost within the past 12 months. We also considered whether the respondent had a 
usual place of care for when they were sick or needed advice about their health and whether 
they reported not having a usual place of care due to the expense or a lack of insurance; the 
latter measure was not available for the 2010 survey year. Following prior work (10), we 
investigated whether the respondent reported ever having been diagnosed with diabetes, 
hypertension, or high cholesterol by a doctor or health professional. The diagnosis for high 
cholesterol was only available for the 2012 and 2014 survey years. The health outcomes 
were whether the respondent reported their health to be “very good” or “excellent,” if their 
health was better than one year ago, and if the respondent mentioned depression as a health 
problem. Some outcomes were available for all members of surveyed households, while 
others were available only for one sampled member of the household; see Appendix Section 
2 and Appendix Table 1.
STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
Baseline sample characteristics and unadjusted means for each outcome for 2000–2013 (pre-
expansion) and the second half of 2014 (post-expansion) were estimated for expansion and 
non-expansion states accounting for the complex, multi-stage sampling design of the NHIS 
using survey design variables provided by NCHS (11). In addition, we used an F-test to test 
for differences in baseline characteristics for the two groups of states and unadjusted 
difference-in-differences for each outcome measure.
We estimated a multivariate regression model to compare changes in outcomes for 
expansion and non-expansion states. Our independent variable of interest was the interaction 
between a variable indicating that the state adopted the ACA Medicaid expansion and a 
variable indicating that the respondent was interviewed in the second half of 2014. The 
estimated coefficient on this term provided the average difference in outcomes in expanding 
and non-expanding states in the second half of 2014 compared to before the implementation 
of the ACA Medicaid expansions. Observations from the first half of 2014 remained in the 
sample and were indicated with a separate binary variable that was also interacted with the 
indicator for the Medicaid expansions. Our estimates were adjusted for race and ethnicity, 
marital status, number of children and adults in the family, educational attainment, and age, 
as well as state, half-year, and interview quarter fixed effects. The regression models used 
NHIS sampling weights and we estimated Huber-White robust standard errors clustered at 
the state level to account for within-state correlation of the error terms and the state-level 
nature of the policy change (14). Additional details on the regression model are in Appendix 
Section 3.
We used linear probability models rather than nonlinear models to conduct this analysis. The 
primary drawback of using a linear model with binary outcome variables is that it can 
produce predicted probabilities that lie outside the [0,1] interval (15). However, in our case, 
the true probabilities were in a range where linear approximation generally performs well 
(16) and very few predicted values fell outside the [0,1] interval (Appendix Table 2). In

 addition, the time required to run nonlinear models was prohibitive and the results estimated 
from the logit model and linear model were comparable (see Appendix Tables 3–4). We 
computed robust standard errors to correct for heteroskedastic variance present under the 
linear model. See Appendix Section 4 for additional discussion.
All analyses were conducted with Stata/IC version 14.0 (StataCorp LP) and used procedures 
for performing multiple imputation analyses with complex survey data (12, 17). Additional 
information on the Stata commands used to implement the analysis are in Appendix Section 
5.
We conducted several analyses to evaluate the assumptions of our model and assess the 
sensitivity of our results to alternative model specifications. We tested for pre-existing 
differential trends across expansion and non-expansion states and assessed the sensitivity of 
our results to the inclusion of group time trends and the state unemployment rate in this 
period. We also evaluated the sensitivity of our results to alternative sample definitions that 
included states that expanded Medicaid prior to the ACA, excluded late expansion 
implementers in 2014, included non-citizens, included only adults with incomes below 
100% FPL, and included only adults over age 25. We examined how the Medicaid 
expansions affected trends over time in our outcome variables using an interrupted time 
series design and estimated a triple difference model that used respondents with high 
incomes as an additional comparison group. Finally, we examined the sensitivity of our 
results to an alternative method of conducting inference (18). Details of these analyses are in 
Appendix Section 6.

This study received no funding.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents baseline descriptive statistics for survey respondents in the expansion and 
non-expansion states. Low-income adults in expansion states were less likely to be black 
(18.7% v 28.6%) and more likely to be white (73.5% v 67.7%) or other race (7.7% v 3.7%). 
Figure 2 plots the unadjusted insurance coverage outcomes for adults in expansion states and 
non-expansion states from 2010 to 2014. For each state group, the panels show the percent 
of low-income adults who were uninsured, enrolled in Medicaid, enrolled in private 
insurance, and reported that their insurance coverage had improved over the last year. All 
four variables had similar trends in the non-expansion states and expansion states prior to 
2014; however, starting in 2014 the series diverged, with larger reductions in the uninsurance 
rate, larger increases in Medicaid coverage, and improvements in insurance in the states that 
adopted the expansions. Figure 3 presents trends in doctor visits, specialist visits, 
hospitalizations, ED visits, access measures, and diabetes diagnoses across the expansion 
and non-expansion states. See Appendix Section 6 and Appendix Figure 1 for additional 
outcomes.
The adjusted difference-in-differences estimates for outcomes related to coverage and 
utilization are presented in Table 2. Estimates for changes during the first half of 2014

 relative to the pre-ACA period are in Appendix Tables 3 and 4. Medicaid coverage increased 
significantly after the ACA Medicaid expansions in the expansion states when compared to 
the non-expansion states (10.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.5 to 14.5), while the percent of 
respondents reporting no insurance coverage decreased (−7.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 
−11.3 to −3.4). Respondents in expansion states were also more likely to report their health 
insurance coverage had improved over the last year (7.1 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.7 to 
11.5) compared to the non-expansion states. Visits with a general doctor (6.6 percentage 
points; 95% CI, 1.3 to 12.0) and hospital stays (2.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.7 to 4.2) in 
the last 12 months also increased significantly in the expansion states compared to the non-
expansion states. There were no significant changes associated with the expansions on 
private health insurance coverage (−3.7 percentage points; 95% CI, −7.6 to 0.2) or other 
utilization measures.
Table 3 presents outcomes related to access, diagnoses of chronic conditions, and health. 
There were no significant changes in measures related to access to care, health status, or 
mental health in the expansion states relative to the non-expansion states. There were 
significant increases in respondents reporting diagnoses of diabetes (5.2 percentage points; 
95% CI, 2.4 to 8.1) and high cholesterol (5.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.0 to 9.4) 
associated with the expansions, but no significant change in hypertension diagnoses.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
Alternative models and sample definitions resulted in similar results as those presented in 
the main analysis (Appendix Tables 3–4). When a percentile-t cluster bootstrap procedure 
was used to conduct hypothesis testing, all results remained statistically significant 
(Appendix Table 5). Tests for differences in trends in outcomes for the two state groups prior 
to the Medicaid expansions did not reveal significant differences for most outcome variables. 
However, for reports of no usual source of care due to cost, hypertension diagnosis, and 
health improvements during the last year, the null hypothesis that pre-ACA trends were 
identical across the expansion and non-expansion states was rejected (Appendix Table 6). 
When we estimated additional models controlling for different trends in outcomes in 
expansion and non-expansion states, this did not affect our findings on any outcomes, nor 
did the triple differences model (Appendix Tables 3–4). Finally, we modeled the effect of the 
ACA expansions using an interrupted time series approach to examine changes in trends in 
addition to changes in levels for the outcome variables (Appendix Section 8). We found that 
the expansions were associated with an increased positive trend in Medicaid coverage but no 
change in trends for other variables (Appendix Tables 7–8). We were unable to perform 
these tests for high cholesterol diagnoses because we only observed one data point before 
and after the expansions.
DISCUSSION
Our study explored the consequences of the ACA Medicaid expansions by comparing 
changes in health insurance coverage, health care utilization, access to care and self-reported 
health among low-income non-elderly adults in states that did and did not implement the 
expansions in 2014. This is the first study to rely on nationally representative federal survey

 data to evaluate the impact of the ACA Medicaid expansions. In states that expanded 
Medicaid, we find that insurance coverage increased by 7.4 percentage points and Medicaid 
coverage increased by 10.5 percentage points after the ACA expansions when compared to 
non-expansion states. This finding is consistent with early estimates from the NHIS, but our 
estimates are larger in magnitude than those using data from Gallup, the American 
Community Survey, and the Urban Institute (3–6, 19). Our estimates of the increase in 
Medicaid enrollment are smaller than what are implied by state-level enrollment data on the 
total number of enrollees provided by CMS (20). Overall, our estimates are within the range 
of others reported in the literature. We also find new evidence that the Medicaid expansions 
were associated with a large and significant increase in the probability that an individual 
reports that their health care coverage had improved compared to the previous year. We did 
not find evidence of a significant change in private health insurance coverage associated 
with the expansions under our primary model but did detect a significant decrease in certain 
specifications reported in the Appendix.
This study provides the first evidence of increased utilization of health services among low-
income adults in states that expanded coverage. We observed significant increases in reports 
that an individual had a hospital stay or visit with a general doctor within the last 12 months 
in states with expansions compared to non-expansion states. Under the assumption that the 
observed 6.6 percentage point increase in reported doctor visits and the 2.4 percentage point 
increase in hospital stays associated with the expansions are entirely attributable to the 10.5 
percent of the population who gained Medicaid coverage, our estimates imply that Medicaid 
enrollment increased the likelihood of a doctor visit by 62.9 percentage points and of a 
hospital stay by 22.9 percentage points for each newly-enrolled beneficiary over a 12 month 
period. In comparison, the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (OHIE) found that 
Medicaid increased outpatient visits by 21.2 percentage points over a shorter 6-month period 
and increased hospitalizations by 2.1 percentage points over 12 months (8). We did not find 
evidence of a significant change in self-reported ED visits associated with the expansions in 
our main analysis. This is in contrast with the findings of the OHIE, which found that 
Medicaid increased ED visits using administrative data (9), although consistent with early 
results from the OHIE that relied on self-reported ED use (8). We did estimate a significant 
increase in ED visits when we restricted the sample to adults ages 26 and over who did not 
benefit from changes in rules regarding dependent coverage during this period.
We also provide new evidence of a significant increase in rates of diagnosis of chronic health 
conditions among low-income adults under the Medicaid expansions. We observed increases 
in respondent reports of ever being diagnosed with diabetes and high cholesterol associated 
with the expansions, although we found no significant change in the diagnosis of 
hypertension. In comparison, the OHIE found no change in rates of diagnosis of 
hypertension and high cholesterol but a substantial increase in diabetes diagnoses (10). In 
addition, an early study of diabetes diagnoses following the ACA Medicaid expansions 
based on laboratory data found evidence of an increase in the number of Medicaid enrollees 
with newly identified diabetes in states expanding Medicaid compared with non-expansion 
states (21). The increased detection of chronic health conditions under the Medicaid 
expansions, if it leads to improved management and control of these conditions, could have 
important implications for both population health and national health care spending (22).

 We did not observe in our study consistent evidence of improvements in access to health 
care or health status in expansion states. We did not find significant changes in measures of 
access in our main analysis, but did find significant effects under certain specifications 
reported in the Appendix. Two questions related to access to care asked respondents about 
their experience during the previous 12 months, which included some months prior to the 
Medicaid expansion for most respondents; this may have attenuated our results, especially if 
respondents did not sign up for Medicaid as soon as they became eligible.
In addition, we found no evidence of improvements in self-reported health among low-
income adults in expansion states. While in contrast to studies of pre-ACA state Medicaid 
expansions for adults, this is consistent with a recent evaluation of the ACA Medicaid 
expansions using Gallup data (6–7, 10). One potential explanation is that, as a result of the 
expansions, increased contact with health care professionals and respondents’ improved 
knowledge about their health conditions may negatively impact their perceived health in the 
short term (23–24). Finally, although the OHIE found improved mental health and decreased 
positive screenings for depression, we did not find evidence of a change in the mention of 
depression as a health problem associated with the Medicaid expansions.
Our study has several limitations. First, because the policy decision to expand Medicaid is 
not assigned randomly, we cannot definitively exclude the possibility that a 
contemporaneous but unrelated change in either group of states is confounding the results. 
Second, our study does not account for differences in the design and implementation of the 
Medicaid expansions across states as allowed under the federal Section 1115 waiver process. 
In our analysis, we estimate the average change in outcomes among all low-income adults 
residing in states adopting Medicaid expansions but expect that the effects of the expansions 
will vary across states depending on the nature of the Medicaid expansions, health care 
systems, and population in the state. Third, survey data outcomes are based on an 
individual’s recall of their use of health services and may be less accurate compared to 
administrative data. Fourth, these data only contain information on the first year following 
the Medicaid expansions; if changes in health and utilization take longer than one year to 
materialize, it may be too soon to observe the full effect of the policy. Fifth, examining 
multiple outcomes increases the probability that some significant estimates will be found 
due to chance. Finally, self-reported health is subjective and may not correspond to changes 
in clinical measures of health.
Despite these limitations, our study provides new evidence that the ACA Medicaid 
expansions increased the insurance coverage and health care utilization of low-income 
adults, in addition to increasing rates of diagnosis of diabetes and high cholesterol. By 
taking advantage of a rich federal survey, we were able to examine an array of outcomes that 
have yet to be evaluated in the context of the ACA. Fully understanding the experiences of 
low-income residents in the states that have already expanded coverage is a crucial input into 
the ongoing debate surrounding these expansions.

Note: N=number of observations. Weighted baseline characteristics were estimated using the pooled 2010 to 2013 years of the National Health 
Interview Survey. The estimation sample was defined as U.S. citizens of the ages 19–64 with family incomes at or below 138% of the federal 
poverty line. The latter characteristic was imputed for respondents with missing values for family income using multiple imputation files provided 
by the National Center for Health Statistics. Please see text and Supplementary Appendix for additional details on multiple imputation procedures 
used in the analysis.

Notes: CI=confidence interval. The pre period is defined as 2010–2013 and the post period is defined as the second half of 2014. All pre- and post-means and difference-in-differences estimates use survey 
weights. Adjusted difference-in-differences estimates are adjusted for race and ethnicity, age, marital status, number of kids in family, number of adults in family, educational attainment, state and half-year 
fixed effects, and interview quarter fixed effects. All analyses were conducted using multiple imputation methods. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust and clustered by state.
