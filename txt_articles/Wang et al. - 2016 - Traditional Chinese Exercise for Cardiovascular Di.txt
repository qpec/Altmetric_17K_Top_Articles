Background-—Traditional Chinese exercise (TCE) has widespread use for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease;
however, there appears to be no consensus about the benefits of TCE for patients with cardiovascular disease. The objective of this
systematic review was to determine the effects of TCE for patients with cardiovascular disease.
Methods and Results-—Relevant studies were searched by PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure. We covered only
published articles with randomized controlled trials. The outcome measures included physiological outcomes, biochemical
outcomes, physical function, quality of life, and depression. A total of 35 articles with 2249 cardiovascular disease patients
satisfied the inclusion criteria. The pooling revealed that TCE could decrease systolic blood pressure by 9.12 mm Hg (95% CI
�16.38 to �1.86, P=0.01) and diastolic blood pressure by 5.12 mm Hg (95% CI �7.71 to �2.52, P<0.001). Patients performing
TCE also found benefits compared with those in the control group in terms of triglyceride (standardized mean difference �0.33,
95% CI �0.56 to �0.09, P=0.006), 6-minute walk test (mean difference 59.58 m, 95% CI �153.13 to 269.93, P=0.03), Minnesota
Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire results (mean difference �17.08, 95% CI �23.74 to �10.41, P<0.001), 36-Item Short
Form physical function scale (mean difference 0.82, 95% CI 0.32–1.33, P=0.001), and Profile of Mood States depression scale
(mean difference �3.02, 95% CI �3.50 to �2.53, P<0.001).
Conclusions-—This study demonstrated that TCE can effectively improve physiological outcomes, biochemical outcomes, physical
function, quality of life, and depression among patients with cardiovascular disease. More high-quality randomized controlled trials
on this topic are warranted. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e002562 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.115.002562)

C
ardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading causes of
disability and death in the world and in 2010 were
considered the main risk factor for the overall global burden
of disease.1,2According to the World Health Organization,3
�17.3 million people worldwide died from CVD in 2008, and
80% of CVD-related deaths were recorded in low- and middle-
income countries. Among CVDs, heart disorder has reportedly
claimed 7.3 million lives, whereas stroke has caused 6.2 mil-
lion deaths. Low-cost, easily accessible, and symptom-free
programs are needed to treat and prevent CVD.
Physical inactivity is estimated to be the fourth main risk
factor for global mortality.4,5 Regular exercise is shown to
have significant benefits for the maintenance of blood
pressure and blood cholesterol.6–8 The practice and increas-
ing global popularity of traditional Chinese exercises (TCEs),
such as tai chi, qigong, and baduanjin, for >2000 years has
substantially benefited human health.9–13 TCE is a low-risk,
promising intervention that can help improve physiological
outcomes, biochemical outcomes, physical function, quality of
life, and depression among patients with CVD.14–16
Although TCEs have been widely performed for the preven-
tion and treatment of CVD,17,18 no consensus has been reached
about the benefits of these exercises for the maintenance of
physiological

 function, and quality of life or for the prevention of depression
among CVD patients. We are also unaware of any systematic
reviews that have assessed the effect of TCEs on physiological
outcomes, blood cholesterol, quality of life, and depression
among patients with CVD.
The effect of TCEs in CVD patients must be determined
based on scientific evidence to conserve time and resources.
The objective of this systematic review was to determine the
effects of TCEs on physiological outcomes, biochemical
outcomes, physical function, quality of life, and depression
among CVD patients.
Methods
The protocol for our study is registered in the international
prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO regis-
tration number CRD42013006474).
Search Strategy
Relevant studies published between January 1957 and January
2015 were obtained from the following electronic data
sources: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane
Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
Literature (CINAHL), and the China National Knowledge
Infrastructure. No language restrictions were imposed, and
the search was limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
The full electronic search strategies for all databases are
provided in Data S1.
Inclusion Criteria
First, the only studies covered were published RCTs. Second,
we included articles that discussed patients with CVD
including ischemic heart disease or coronary artery disease
(eg, heart attack), cerebrovascular disease (eg, stroke),
diseases of the aorta and arteries (eg, hypertension), and
peripheral vascular disease. Third, we considered only articles
that compared an intervention group, that is, a group
performing TCEs (eg, tai chi, qigong, baduanjin) with a control
group that performed other exercises (eg, strength exercises),
that received usual care, or that did not undergo any
intervention. Fourth, outcome measures included physiolog-
ical outcomes (eg, blood pressure, heart rate, peak oxygen
uptake), biochemical outcomes (eg, cholesterol and triglyc-
eride [TG]), physical function (eg, 6-minute walk test, timed up
and go test), quality of life (eg, Minnesota Living With Heart
Failure Questionnaire [MLHFQ], General Health Questionnaire
[GHQ], and 36-Item Short Form [SF-36]), and depression (eg,
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAMD], Profile of Mood
States [POMS] depression scale).
Selection of Studies
Two authors independently used the same selection criteria to
screen the titles, abstracts, and full contents of the relevant
articles. A study was removed from the selection if the
inclusion criteria were not fulfilled. Any disagreements were
resolved by discussion. A third author was consulted if a
disagreement persisted.
Data Extraction and Management
The following data were extracted: study characteristics (eg,
author and year), participant characteristics (eg, age and
number of participants), description of interventions, duration
of trial period, types of assessed outcomes, and time points.
The 2 authors who selected the studies also extracted the
data from the included articles. Any disagreement was
resolved by discussion, and a third author was consulted if
a disagreement persisted.
Quality Assessment
As recommended,19 we used the Cochrane Collaboration tool
for assessing the risk of bias of the included trials. The
following information was evaluated: random sequence gen-
eration, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and
personnel, blinding of outcome assessments, incomplete
outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias.
The trials were graded as unclear, high, or low risk of bias.
The methodological quality of each study was independently
assessed by 2 review authors. A third author was consulted if
any disagreement occurred.
Statistical Analysis
The Review Manager software (RevMan 5.2; Cochrane
Collaboration) was used to conduct the meta-analysis. We
used the chi-square test and the I2 statistic to evaluate
heterogeneity among the studies. The outcome measures
from the individual studies were combined by meta-analysis
using a random-effects model. Given that all variables in the
included studies were continuous data, we used the stan-
dardized mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) and
95% CI to analyze the studies. The MD was used as a
summary statistic in meta-analysis when all studies reported
the same outcome using the same scale. The SMD was used
as a summary statistic in meta-analysis when all studies
assessed the same outcome using different scales (ie, the
outcome was measured using different units). We considered
P<0.05 to be statistically significant. Funnel plot asymmetry
was used to assess possible publication bias by the Egger’s
regression
test. Sensitivity
analysis

 removing each study individually to evaluate the quality and
consistency of the results.
If the continuous data were reported as median and
interquartile range, the median would be assumed to be
equivalent to the mean, and the relationship of interquartile
range and the standard deviation would be roughly computed
as SD=IQR/1.35.20 The standard deviation could be obtained
from the standard error of a mean by multiplying by the
square root of the sample size: SD=SE9

cases, we also estimated the means and standard deviations
for the data and reported them graphically rather than in a
table. The authors of the selected studies were contacted if
the standard deviations were not shown in the paper or could
not be derived from their data. If the authors contacted did
not reply, their articles were excluded.

Search Results
We identified 68 potentially eligible records from the 2824
records
obtained
from
PubMed,
the
Cochrane
Library,
Embase, CINAHL, the China National Knowledge Infrastruc-
ture, and Web of Science. After reviewing the full content
of
the
papers,
35
articles21–55
satisfied
the
inclusion
criteria. The remaining 33 articles were excluded for several
reasons (eg, participants did not have CVD, studies were
not randomized). The process of identifying the eligible
studies is outlined in Figure 1. Table 1 summarizes the
characteristics of each included study. The 35 articles
covered 2249 patients with CVD (15 articles covered
patients with heart disease, 13 articles covered those with
hypertension, and 7 articles covered those with cerebrovas-
cular disease). The countries or regions of publication were
mainly the People’s Republic of China (n=17, 48.57%), the
United States (n=5, 14.28%), the United Kingdom (n=3,
8.57%), the Republic of Korea (n=3, 8.57%), Japan (n=2,
5.71%), Hong Kong (n=1, 2.85%), Italy (n=1, 2.85%), Taiwan
(n=1, 2.85%), New Zealand (n=1, 2.85%), and Israel (n=1,
2.85%).
Risk of Bias Among the Selected Articles
We assessed the risk of bias in all selected articles (Table 2).
All articles used the generation of the allocation sequence
(n=35, 100%). Allocation concealment was inadequate in most
articles (n=26, 74%). None of the studies blinded their
participants or personnel. Eight articles (23%) masked their
outcome assessors to the treatment allocation. A low risk of
incomplete outcome bias was reported in 31 articles (88.5%),
whereas a low risk of selective reporting bias was reported in
most articles (n=28, 73.6%).
Effects of TCE on Physiological Outcomes
Blood pressure
Sixteen articles* involving 939 patients compared the systolic
blood pressures (SBPs) and diastolic blood pressures (DBPs)
between patients performing TCEs and those in the control
group. Based on a random-effects model, TCE was found to
decrease SBP by 9.12 mm Hg (95% CI �16.38 to �1.86,
P=0.01; I2=99%, P<0.00001) and DBP by 5.12 mm Hg (95% CI
�7.71 to �2.52, P<0.001; I2=97%, P<0.00001) among
patients performing TCEs compared with those in the control
group (Figure 2 and Table 3).
Heart rate
Nine articles** involving 463 patients compared the heart rate
between patients performing TCEs and those in the control
group. No significant differences were observed between the 2
groups based on a random-effects model (MD �2.39 beats per
minute, 95% CI �5.61 to �0.82, P=0.14) (Table 3).
Peak oxygen uptake
Four articles42,50,52,53 involving 166 patients compared the
peak oxygen uptake of patients performing TCEs and those in
Figure 1. Flow chart of the study selection procedure. CKNI

significantly improved (SMD �1.12, 95% CI �1.97 to �0.27,
P=0.01; I2=93%, P<0.00001) compared with that of the
patients in the control group based on a random-effects
model (Figure 3B and Table 3).
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
Four articles28,29,44,45 involving 324 patients compared the
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels between
patients performing TCEs and those in the control group. In a
random-effects model, the LDL-C of patients performing TCEs
significantly decreased (SMD �0.81, 95% CI �1.24 to �0.38,
P<0.001; I2=71%, P=0.02) compared with that of the patients
in the control group (Figure 3C and Table 3).
High-density lipoprotein cholesterol
Six articles28,29,35,41,44,45 involving 408 patients were included
in the meta-analysis to assess the effect of TCE on HDL-C. The
HDL-C of patients performing TCEs significantly improved (SMD
0.74, 95% CI 0.29–1.18, P=0.001; I2=79%, P=0.0003) com-
pared with that of the patients in the control group based on a
random-effects model (Figure 3D and Table 3).
B-type natriuretic peptide
Three articles50,52,53 involving 146 patients compared the B-
type natriuretic peptide (BNP) of patients performing TCEs and
those in the control group. Based on a random-effects model,
the BNP of the patients performing TCEs significantly improved
(MD �23.04 ng/mL, 95% CI �27.10 to �18.98, P<0.001)
compared with that of the patients in the control group
(Table 3).
Sensitivity analysis revealed that TG, TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C
outcomes were stable when studies were removed 1 by 1. The
significance of the BNP outcome was changed in the
sensitivity analysis when 1 study52 was removed; this result
offered inferior evidence for the effect of TCE on BNP. The
sensitivity analysis did not affect heterogeneity of TG, TC,
LDL-C, HDL-C and BNP outcomes.
Effects of TCE on Physical Function
Timed up and go test
Two articles52,53 involving 116 patients compared the timed up
and go tests of patients performing TCEs and those in the control
group. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups
(MD �0.2 second, 95% CI �0.64 to 0.24, P=0.38) (Table 3).
Six-minute walk test
Six articles24,49–53 involving 374 patients were used to
estimate the effect of TCE on 6-minute walk test. The
6-minute walk tests of patients performing TCEs improved by
59.58 m (95% CI 4.95–114.20, P=0.03; I2=93%, P<0.00001)
compared with that of the control group, based on a random-
effects model (Figure 4A and Table 3). Sensitivity analysis
revealed that the 6-minute walk test outcome was not stable
when studies were removed 1 by 1. The sensitivity analysis
did not affect heterogeneity of the timed up and go or
6-minute walk test outcomes.
Effects of TCE on Quality of Life
Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire
Five articles21,50–53 involving 216 patients were included to
assess the effect of TCE on MLHFQ. The MLHFQ scores of
patients performing TCEs significantly improved (MD �17.08,
95% CI �23.74 to �10.41, P<0.001; I2=67%, P=0.02)
compared with that of the patients in the control group,
based on a random effects model (Figure 4B and Table 3).
General Health Questionnaire
Two articles22,46 involving 49 patients compared the GHQ
scores of patients performing TCEs and those in the control
group. No significant differences were found between these
groups based on a random-effects model (MD �1.02, 95% CI
�2.91 to 0.87, P=0.29; I2=43%, P=0.29) (Table 3).
36-Item Short Form
Five articles29–31,43,46,49 involving 374 patients were used to
estimate the effect of TCE on SF-36. Compared with the patients
in the control group, those performing TCEs showed improved
SF-36 general health results (MD �1.56, 95% CI �2.52 to
�0.61, P=0.001; I2=0%, P=0.4)and SF-36 physical function (MD
0.82, 95% CI 0.32–1.33, P=0.001; I2=0%, P=0.45). No signifi-
cant differences were found between the 2 groups in terms of
SF-36 total score (MD �5.95, 95% CI �16.16 to 4.27, P=0.25;
I2=82%, P=0.02) and SF-36 mental health results (MD �2.67,
95% CI �10.08 to 4.75, P=0.29; I2=43%, P=0.09) (Table 3).
Sensitivity analysis revealed that MLHFQ outcome was
stable when studies were removed 1 by 1. The significance of
SF-36 outcome was changed in the sensitivity analysis when
1 study was removed;31 this result offered inferior evidence
for the effect of TCE on SF-36. The sensitivity analysis did not
affect heterogeneity of SF-36 outcome, but sensitivity anal-
ysis affected heterogeneity of MLHFQ outcome.

POMS Depression Scale
Two articles52,53 involving 116 patients were included to
assess the effect of TCE on the POMS depression scale. The
POMS depression scale scores of the patients performing
TCEs significantly improved (MD �3.02, 95% CI �3.50 to

 TCEs are used to treat patients with CVDs. Previous
systematic reviews focused on specific TCEs, such as tai chi
and qigong.18,56–58 This systematic review compiled evidence
from a large number of trials assessing the effectiveness of
TCEs to evaluate the overall effect of TCEs on patients with
CVD compared with other exercises or of the absence of any
intervention.
This systematic review and meta-analysis included 35
RCTs involving 2249 patients with CVD to provide further
evidence of the effect of TCEs on physiological outcomes,
biochemical outcomes, quality of life, and depression in CVD
patients. The SBP, DBP, TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, BNP, 6-minute
walk test, MLHFQ, SF-36 (general health and physical
function), HAMD, and POMS depression scale of patients
performing TCEs significantly improved compared with those
of the patients in the control group. The benefits of TCEs for
SBP, DBP, TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, MLHFQ, and depression of
CVD patients reached certain levels that could signify clinical
importance. In particular, the effects TCE on blood pressure
and blood lipids are clinically significant because blood
pressure and LDL-C are the primary targets for cardiovascular
risk reduction.
A meta-analysis59 showed that by reducing the SBP and
DBP by 10 and 5 mm Hg, respectively, TCE could reduce the
occurrences of stroke and coronary heart disease by 41% and
22%, respectively. Another systematic review revealed that
the morbidity and mortality of CVDs could be reduced by up
to 50% if blood cholesterol was reduced by �20%, SBP by 10
to 15 mm Hg, and DBP by 5 to 8 mm Hg.60 Based on current
evidence from systematic reviews, TCE could improve the
quality of life and reduce the depression of CVD patients;
however, no significant differences were found between
patients performing TCEs and those in the control group in
terms of heart rate, peak oxygen uptake, timed up and go
test, and 12-item GHQ.
Although the intensity of TCE ranged from low to
moderate, we found that TCE could improve physiological
outcomes (eg, blood pressure), biochemical outcomes (eg,
cholesterol and TG), quality of life (eg, MLHFQ), and depres-
sion of patients with CVDs. TCE has a complex mechanism for
treating CVD. TCE is based on the theoretical principles of
traditional Chinese medicine. The integrated exercise of mind
and body, which includes stillness of mind, flow of breath,
movement of body, and self-correction of posture, activates
the natural self-regulatory (self-healing) ability and evokes a
balanced release of endogenous neurohormones and a wide
array of natural health recoverymechanisms.61 Nevertheless,
the contribution of TCEs in improving the health of patients
with CVD requires further investigation.
The pooled estimate of effect for the outcome (Figure 2)
has significant heterogeneity. There may be important clinical
and methodological differences among studies that influence
the differences between intervention and controls. Some
differences existed in inclusion criteria and among the
participants, who came from different countries and may
have different understandings of TCE. Different types of TCE
include not only include tai chi but also baduanjin, yijinjing,
and other forms. Even tai chi has a lot of branches.
Strengths and Limitations
This paper is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to
assess and compare the effects of TCE with other exercises or
with no intervention regarding physiological outcomes (eg,
blood pressure), biochemical outcomes (eg, cholesterol and
TG), quality of life, and depression among patients with CVD.
Unlike prior systematic reviews, more than a quarter of the
included studies were published within the past 2 years.
This
systematic
review
searched
a
wide
variety
of
electronic databases for relevant articles. We searched
primarily for articles in the Chinese electronic database
because TCEs originated in China. Two reviewers indepen-
dently selected the studies, extracted the data, and evaluated
the quality of the studies to decrease bias and transcription
errors. Consequently, the results of our systematic review are
considered robust.
Our meta-analysis had several limitations. First, although
all included studies were RCTs, only a few (9 of 35) clearly
indicated
allocation
concealment
in
their
experimental
procedures; therefore, selection bias or confounding may
be present. Moreover, only 8 of the included studies
blinded their assessors. Second, only 2 or 3 of the included
studies assessed the effect of TCE on BNP, timed up and
go test, GHQ-12, SF-36, HAMD, and POMS. More quality
RCTs are needed to have confidence in the results in the
future.
Third,
although
6
electronic
databases
were
searched systematically for relevant articles by using a
prespecified search strategy and because publication bias
was assessed by Egger’s regression test, we did not search
for any unpublished trials. Consequently, the probability of
publication bias may also exist in our study. Fourth, the
follow-up durations of most studies were no longer than
1 year; therefore, we did not perform the meta-analysis to
assess the long-term effect of TCE for CVD patients.
Although each included study was an RCT, most of these
studies did not adhere to the generally accepted standards
in reporting clinical trials (eg, the Consolidated Standards of
Reporting Trials statement).62 The methodological standards
of future studies must be improved in terms of allocation
concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, adequate
follow-up, and intention-to-treat analysis. Fifth, TCE includes
different types of exercise, and it is necessary to have
detailed subgroups for different types of TCE and different
types of controls in the future.

 Conclusions
This study showed that TCE could provide more benefits than
other exercises or no intervention for decreasing SBP and
DBP and improving biochemical outcomes, physical function,
quality of life, and depression in patients with CVD. The
results may improve some CVD risk factors; therefore, the
clinical implications of our systematic review results showed
that TCE should be useful for patients with CVD, medical staff,
and health care decision makers. Nevertheless, extreme
heterogeneity in the analyses remained unexplained, and the
number of high-quality studies was not large in the systematic
review. More multicenter RCTs with large sample sizes must
be conducted to assess the effects of TCEs in CVD patients.
The long-term effectiveness of TCEs for patients with CVD
must also be evaluated. Theories about how TCE could treat
patients with CVDs and prevent such diseases should be
further clarified.
