Abstract
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a significant cause of nosocomial pneumonia and an alarming
pathogen owing to the recent isolation of multidrug resistant strains. Understanding of
immune responses orchestrating K. pneumoniae clearance by the host is of utmost impor-
tance. Here we show that type I interferon (IFN) signaling protects against lung infection
with K. pneumoniae by launching bacterial growth-controlling interactions between alveolar
macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. Type I IFNs are important but disparate and
incompletely understood regulators of defense against bacterial infections. Type I IFN
receptor 1 (Ifnar1)-deficient mice infected with K. pneumoniae failed to activate NK cell-
derived IFN-γ production. IFN-γ was required for bactericidal action and the production of
the NK cell response-amplifying IL-12 and CXCL10 by alveolar macrophages. Bacterial
clearance and NK cell IFN-γ were rescued in Ifnar1-deficient hosts by Ifnar1-proficient NK
cells. Consistently, type I IFN signaling in myeloid cells including alveolar macrophages,
monocytes and neutrophils was dispensable for host defense and IFN-γ activation. The
failure of Ifnar1-deficient hosts to initiate a defense-promoting crosstalk between alveolar
macrophages and NK cell was circumvented by administration of exogenous IFN-γ which
restored endogenous IFN-γ production and restricted bacterial growth. These data identify
NK cell-intrinsic type I IFN signaling as essential driver of K. pneumoniae clearance, and
reveal specific targets for future therapeutic exploitations.

 Author summary
The isolation of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains has significantly nar-
rowed, or in some settings completely removed, the therapeutic options for the treatment
of Klebsiella infections. Therapies targeting the immune system rather than the pathogen
represent important alternatives. Despite the clinical relevance, there are still major gaps
in our understanding of immune responses which drive the clearance of this pathogen.
Type I interferons (IFNs) are known as powerful immune system regulators yet their
effects on bacterial infections are disparate and remain elusive. In this study we show that
type I IFN signaling is indispensable for mounting a protective and bacterial clearance-
promoting immune response against K. pneumoniae. K. pneumoniae-induced type I IFNs
launch a crosstalk between alveolar macrophages and NK cells by enabling NK cell IFN-γ
production which in turn activates the macrophage anti-microbial armament. Type I
IFN-responsive NK cells or IFN-γ administration rescue K. pneumoniae clearance in type
I IFN-unresponsive hosts. Our study suggests that manipulation of type I IFN or IFN-γ
levels might represent a valid strategy for treatment of drug-resistant K. pneumoniae
infections.
Introduction
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a capsulated Gram negative pathogen which causes a wide range of
infectious diseases, from urinary tract infections to pneumonia, the latter being particularly
devastating among immunocompromised patients [1]. Of particular concern is the increasing
isolation of multidrug resistant strains that narrows the therapeutic options for the treatment
of K. pneumoniae infections [2–4]. To further complicate this scenario, recent population
genomic studies have shown that virulent and multidrug resistant clones have access to a
diverse mobile pool of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes [2, 5] hence making possi-
ble the emergence of an extremely drug-resistant hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strain capable
of causing untreatable infections in healthy individuals. It is then not surprising that multidrug
resistant K. pneumoniae has been singled out as a significant threat to global public health by
the World Health Organization, Centers of Diseases Control and Prevention, European Union
and other organizations [4]. In light of this growing health problem, it is essential to better
understand the immune pathways that are critical to host defense towards K. pneumoniae.
Successful defense against infections requires a coordinated action of multiple immune
cell subsets. In this context, it is widely appreciated that type I interferons (IFNs) decisively
coordinate immune responses by modulating cell-autonomous immunity and inflammatory
responses, and by dictating immune cell-to-cell communications [6, 7]. While type I IFNs are
the major effector cytokines of the host defense response against viral infections, a body of
mainly recent data indicate that type I IFNs are also produced in response to bacteria [8–10].
However, depending on the bacterial infection, type I IFNs exert seemingly opposing functions
[8, 10]. Type I IFNs protect against the progression of a localized Streptococcus pneumoniae
lung infection to invasive disease [11, 12], prevent IL-1β-mediated tissue-damaging hyperin-
flammation in invasive soft tissue infection with Streptococcus pyogenes [13, 14] and restrict the
growth of Legionella pneumophila in macrophages [15]. By contrast, type I IFNs impair the
clearance of the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis [16–18] and they are detri-
mental to host survival after Francisella tularensis infection [19, 20]. Overall, it is currently
impossible to predict from the pathogen tropism or biology whether type I IFNs will be benefi-
cial or detrimental for the host. This knowledge gap calls for additional mechanistic studies

 dissecting the type I IFN functions in other bacterial infections in order to define common
and unique principles of the role of type I IFNs in host defense against bacterial infections.
Research over the last twenty years demonstrates that activation of early inflammatory
responses, including production of TNF, IL-12, IL-23, IL-17 and IFN-γ, is essential to clear K.
pneumoniae infections [21–23]. The role of type I IFNs in K. pneumoniae has so far not been
addressed. Here we show that type I IFN signaling coordinates the communication between
macrophages and NK cells to launch a protective immune response during lung infection
with K. pneumoniae. Type I IFNs produced by macrophages upon K. pneumoniae challenge
promote IFN-γ production by NK cells. IFN-γ in turn feeds back to prime macrophages for
enhanced IL-12 production and bacterial killing. These results establish that NK cell-restricted
type I IFN signaling entails resistance against severe lung infection caused by K. pneumoniae.
Results
Type I IFN signaling-deficient mice are susceptible to K. pneumoniae
infection
The importance of type I IFN signaling during K. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia was
assessed by infecting type I IFN 1 receptor-deficient (Ifnar1-/-) mice. Ifnar1 is one of the sub-
units of the type I IFN receptor which mediates type I IFN responses in innate and acquired
immunity to infection. Mice were intranasally infected with K. pneumoniae strain 52.145. This
infection model recapitulates Klebsiella-triggered human pneumonia [24, 25]. Strain 52.145
belongs to the K. pneumoniae KpI group which includes the vast majority of strains most fre-
quently associated with human infection, including numerous multidrug-resistant or hyper-
virulent clones [2]. This strain encodes all virulence functions significantly associated with
invasive community-acquired disease in humans [2, 5]. Ifnar1-/- mice infected with 5 x 104
CFU K. pneumoniae 52.145 exhibited a markedly decreased survival (Fig 1A) and increased
weight loss (Fig 1B) as compared to wild-type (WT) controls, demonstrating essential contri-
bution of type I IFN signaling to host defense against this pathogen.
To elucidate possible mechanisms by which the absence of type I IFN signaling resulted in
increased lethality, we examined the ability of Ifnar1-/- mice to control bacterial growth. Analy-
sis of bacterial loads in lungs 12, 24 and 48 h following K. pneumoniae infection revealed a sig-
nificant defect of Ifnar1-/- mice to restrict bacterial replication (Fig 1C). Both Ifnar1-/- and WT
mice exhibited similar bacterial burdens 12 h post infection (p.i.) (Fig 1C, left panel). However,
in contrast to WT mice, Ifnar1-/- mice failed to control bacterial growth at later time points
resulting in significantly higher bacterial burdens in lungs at 24 and 48 h post infection (p.i.)
(Fig 1C, middle and right panel). Consistently, the difference in CFU between Ifnar1-/- and
WT mice was increasing with time of infection. Higher bacterial loads were also found in the
spleen and liver of Ifnar1-/- mice than in organs of WT animals at 48 h p.i. (Fig 1D). The bacte-
rial burden in the spleen and liver was negligible and similar in both genotypes at 12 h p.i.
Analysis of lung sections 48 and 72 h p.i. showed more severe bronchopneumonia in Ifnar1-/-
mice compared to WT controls, as revealed by a higher overall histopathology score compris-
ing airway inflammation, intralesional bacterial burden and neutrophil infiltration (Fig 1E and
1F). The bronchopneumonia involved bronchi, bronchioles and to a lesser extent alveolar
ducts and alveoli. The inflammation was predominantly neutrophilic, and aggregates of bacte-
ria were evident within the foci of inflammation. No appreciable differences between Ifnar1-/-
and WT mice were noted in lung histology of animals which were given intranasal PBS
(S1A Fig).
The lung pathology analysis suggested that severe lung destruction was the cause of
increased mortality of Ifnar1-/- animals. To test this, we infected a cohort of Ifnar1-/- mice and

 monitored the progress of bronchopneumonia toward a lethal disease by comparing lungs of
mice which were reaching behavioral and/or patho-physiological humane endpoints with
lungs of mice which were showing mild symptoms at the same time of infection. In addition,
we sampled lungs of mice which survived longer than 10 days and appeared recovered. Lung
section analyses revealed that animals showing the most severe symptoms, i.e. animals
approaching human endpoints, exhibited large areas of lung inflammation (more than 60% of
the lung tissue affected) including increased intralesional bacteria and neutrophil infiltration
(S1B Fig, left panel). The high degree of pathological changes in lungs of these mice was not
compatible with life since animals with similarly severe symptoms ultimately developed a
lethal disease in survival experiments (Fig 1). In contrast, animals showing only mild symp-
toms or animals surviving the 10 day observation period exhibited low or no lung inflamma-
tion at all, respectively (S1B Fig, middle and right panels).
K. pneumoniae induces type I IFN in IRF3- and TLR4-dependent
manner
Having established the importance of type I IFN signaling for host defense against K. pneu-
moniae, we sought to determine the signaling pathway(s) activated by the pathogen to induce
type I IFN production and signaling. Myeloid cells such as alveolar macrophages produce
type I IFNs in response to many bacterial pathogens [8–10]. To test whether alveolar macro-
phages are type I IFN producers during K. pneumoniae infection, alveolar macrophages
(CD45+CD11chighSiglecF+) were isolated from infected C57Bl/6 mice 24 h p.i. These cells dis-
played induction of Ifnb, the key type I IFN gene, when compared to uninfected controls (Fig
2A). Consistently, the type I IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) Isg15 was also induced (Fig 2A).
Induction of Tnf confirmed that alveolar macrophages were activated by the infection (Fig
2A). Type I IFNs were also induced in the mouse alveolar macrophage cell line MH-S and
bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) infected with K. pneumoniae (S2A Fig). In
agreement, K. pneumoniae infection induced the expression of the ISGs Mx1, Ifit1 and Isg15
in BMDMs (Fig 2B). Tnf expression was similar in WT and ifnar1-/- BMDMs (Fig 2B). Fur-
ther, we observed ISG15 modification (ISGylation) of proteins in K. pneumoniae-infected
cells (S2B Fig). The induction of ISGs and ISGylation by K. pneumoniae was abrogated in
Ifnar1-/- BMDMs demonstrating the requirement for type I IFN signaling (S2B Fig).
The central tenet of type I IFN production is that the initial wave of type I IFN production
relies on the activation of the IFN-regulatory factor (IRF) 3 [26]. K. pneumoniae-induced
expressions of Ifnb and of the ISGs Mx1, Ifit1 and Isg15 were ablated in infected Irf3-/- BMDMs
Fig 2B). In contrast, Tnf expression was not affected by the Irf3 deletion (Fig 2B). These data
reveal a fundamental role of IRF3 in induction of K. pneumoniae-triggered type I IFNs and
ISGs.
Bacteria trigger type I IFN production by activation of various pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs) [8, 10]. In vivo and in vitro evidence has demonstrated that TLR4 governs host
in lungs 12, 24 and 48 h p. i. (C), and in spleens and livers 48 h p. i. (D). Bacterial load is presented as CFU

 defenses against K. pneumoniae [27–30]. To test the involvement of TLR4 in K. pneumoniae-
induced IFN-β production, we employed BMDMs derived from Tlr4-/- mice. Supporting the
key role of TLR4 in Ifnb induction, K. pneumoniae-triggered phosphorylation of Ifnb gene
drivers IRF3 and the IRF3 kinase TBK1 [26] were abrogated in Tlr4-/- BMDMs (Fig 2C). The
lack of TLR4 abolished induction of Ifnb, Mx1, Ifit1 and Isg15 and protein modification by
ISG15 (ISGylation) (Fig 2D and S2C Fig). Consistent with the involvement of the canonical

 TLR4-activated pathway [26], macrophages lacking the adaptors TRIF and TRAM did not
induce protein ISGylation and the expression of Ifnb, Mx1, Ifit1 and Isg15 in response to K.
pneumoniae infection (S2D and S2E Fig). Phosphorylation of IRF3 and TBK1 was not stimu-
lated in macrophages lacking the adaptors TRIF and TRAM, but proceeded normally in the
absence of MyD88 (S2F Fig). Together, these results demonstrate that K. pneumoniae-induced
type I IFN production and signaling is dependent on the TLR4-TRIF-TRAM-IRF3 pathway.
We and others have shown that K. pneumoniae capsule polysaccharide (CPS) and lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS) are recognized by TLR4 to launch inflammatory responses [31, 32]. There-
fore, we hypothesized that these polysaccharides might be involved in TLR4-mediated type I
IFN induction. To test this, macrophages were infected with a cps, O-polysaccharide, and dou-
ble cps-O-polysaccharide K. pneumoniae mutants, and type I IFN was quantified in the super-
natants of infected cells. The three mutants induced less type I IFN than the wild-type strain
(Fig 2E) although the cps mutant induced more type I IFN than the two O-polysaccharide
mutants. The lack of induction of type I IFN production was in agreement with the reduced
phosphorylation of IRF3 triggered by the mutants (S2G Fig) indicating that the CPS and LPS
O-polysaccharides are the K. pneumoniae factors activating TLR4 to induce type I IFN.
Type I IFN signaling promotes IFN-γ, IL-12 and CXCL10 production in
response to K. pneumoniae in vivo
To confirm that type I IFN signaling is activated by K. pneumoniae also in vivo, we examined
the lung tissue 12 h p.i. Expression of the ISGs Mx1, Ifit1 and Isg15 was induced in WT but not
Ifnar1-/-mice (Fig 3A) corroborating the results obtained using infection of macrophages. To
assess whether type I IFN signaling influenced the inflammatory response in lungs of K. pneu-
moniae-infected animals, we analyzed several inflammation-associated cytokines and chemo-
kines 12 h p.i. K. pneumoniae–induced expression of IFN-γ, a critical cytokine for defense
against lung infection with K. pneumoniae [22], was virtually absent in Ifnar1-/- mice at both
mRNA and protein levels (Fig 3B and S3A Fig). Similarly, the induction of IL-12 mRNA
(Il12b) and protein (IL-12p70), a key IFN-γ inducer, was impaired in Ifnar1-/- mice (Fig 3B
and S3A Fig). The induction of CXCL10, a chemokine required for NK cell recruitment and
host defense against K. pneumoniae [33], was abolished in Ifnar1-/- mice (Fig 3B). The mRNA
of the immediate early cytokine Tnf was induced upon infection in both WT and Ifnar1-/- mice
although the levels were lower in Ifnar1-/- when compared to WT animals (Fig 3B). At the pro-
tein level, TNF was comparable in both genotypes (S3A Fig). Expression of the anti-inflamma-
tory Il10, the neutrophil chemoattractant Cxcl1 and the pro-inflammatory Il1b, were not
affected by type I IFN signaling (Fig 3B and S3B Fig). The defect of Ifnar1-/- mice in induction
of Ifng, Il12b and Cxcl10 was persistent and clearly detectable at 48 p.i. (Fig 3C). However, the
expression of Tnf was no longer different between Ifnar1-/- and WT mice at this later time
point (Fig 3C). The expression of Il10, Cxcl1 and Il1b was comparable in Ifnar1-/- and WT
mice at 48 h p.i. (Fig 3C and S3C Fig), as observed already at the 12 h time point (Fig 3B).
Together, the lack of type I IFN signaling results in defect in the production of IFN-γ, IL-12
and CXCL10 in K. pneumoniae-infected lungs.
Activation and accumulation of NK cells in K. pneumoniae-infected lungs
is dependent on type I IFN signaling
The failure of Ifnar1-deficient mice to induce IL-12 and IFN-γ upon K. pneumoniae infection
suggested a defect in immune cells producing these cytokines. Flow cytometry analysis
revealed comparable numbers of alveolar macrophages (4% CD11chighSiglecF+ alveolar mac-
rophages of CD45+ leukocytes) in lungs of Ifnar1-/- and WT animals 12 h after infection with

 K. pneumoniae (Fig 4A and S4A Fig). Infection did not increase the alveolar macrophage
population over PBS-treated controls (Fig 4A). The numbers of neutrophils (Cd11b+Ly6-
G+Ly6Cmed) and inflammatory monocytes (CD11b+Ly6G-Ly6Chigh) in K. pneumoniae-
infected lungs were also similar in both genotypes (Fig 4A, S4B Fig). Both neutrophils and
inflammatory monocytes increased upon infection as compared to PBS-treated controls (Fig
4A), consistent with previous studies [21]. In contrast, the population of CD3-NK1.1+ NK
cells, which have been implicated in defense against K. pneumoniae [34], was decreased in
lungs of infected Ifnar1-/- mice when compared to WT controls both in terms of percentage of
total leukocytes as well as absolute cell numbers (Fig 4B). The NK cell numbers in infected

 Ifnar1-/- mice were comparable to those in PBS-treated mice (Fig 4B). Importantly, the NK cell
population from infected lungs of Ifnar1-/- animals contained significantly lower percentage of
IFN-γ-producing cells than that from WT mice (Fig 4C). The populations of CD4 and CD8 T
cells were also lower in lungs of infected Ifnar1-/- mice compared to WT controls (Fig 4D and
4F, S4C Fig) but these cells did not produce IFN-γ regardless of the genotype (Fig 4E and 4G,
S4C Fig), as revealed by comparison with PBS-treated controls. The lower numbers of CD4
and CD8 T cells in Ifnar1-/- mice can be explained be impaired expression of the T cell chemo-
kine Cxcl10. In sum, the absence of type I IFN signaling results in a defect in NK cell accumula-
tion and NK cell-derived IFN-γ production in the lung of K. pneumoniae-infected mice.
Alveolar macrophage priming by IFN-γ enhances killing of K.
pneumoniae
Macrophages require IFN-γ and/or IFN-γ priming for a complete anti-microbial response and
for expression of the NK- and T cell-activating cytokine IL-12 and the NK and T cell chemoat-
tractant CXCL10 [35, 36]. These responses were insufficiently activated in Ifnar1-/- mice
(Figs 3 and 4) suggesting that the impaired IFN-γ production in Ifnar1-/- mice was causally
involved in the low IL-12 and CXCL10 expression, and in the failure to control bacterial
growth. To test this hypothesis, we isolated alveolar macrophages from WT and Ifnar1-/- mice,
primed them with IFN-γ and infected subsequently with K. pneumoniae. Both WT and
Ifnar1-/- alveolar macrophages primed for 5 h with IFN-γ induced Il12b upon K. pneumoniae
infection (Fig 5A). Without priming, no Il12b was induced (Fig 5A). Cxcl10 was induced by
IFN-γ alone in both WT and Ifnar1-/- alveolar macrophages (Fig 5A), consistent with the
known direct activation of Cxcl10 by IFN-γ [36]. In contrast, Tnf and Il1b were induced
regardless of priming (Fig 5A). To assess the effect of priming on the anti-bacterial activity,
IFN-γ–primed or mock-treated macrophages were infected, treated with gentamicin 1 h p.i.
and incubated for additional 2 h. As anticipated, priming of macrophages with IFN-γ for 2 h
resulted in a significant decrease in the number of intracellular bacteria at 3 h p.i. (Fig 5B) con-
firming the activating effect of IFN-γ on anti-bacterial macrophage activity [37]. Adhesion and
uptake of bacteria were not affected by IFN-γ treatment (Fig 5C). Together, these results sug-
gest that the key function of type I IFN production and signaling in defense against K. pneumo-
niae infection is the induction of IFN-γ. Since we found that the TLR4-IRF3 axis drives type I
IFN production and, consequently, type I IFN signaling in K. pneumoniae-infected BMDMs
(Fig 2) we asked whether IRF3 is required for IFN-γ induction and host defense in vivo. Infec-
tion of Irf3-/- mice confirmed an impairment in Mx1 and Ifit1 but not Tnf induction (Fig 5D)
suggesting that IRF3 is critically involved in K. pneumoniae-elicited type I IFN production in
vivo. Moreover, Irf3-/- mice exhibited impaired expression of Ifng, Il12b and Cxcl10 and
reduced ability to control bacterial growth (Fig 5E and 5F) demonstrating that deficiency in
type I IFN induction has similar consequences for IFN-γ production as the lack of Ifnar1.

 IFN-β into WT mice in the absence of K. pneumoniae did not activate Ifng gene expression in
the lung despite a strong induction of ISGs as well as Cxcl10 (Fig 5G). Thus, IFN-γ, which is
required for efficient killing of K. pneumoniae by macrophages, is activated by type I IFN sig-
naling only in the context of K. pneumoniae infection.
Protective immune response against K. pneumoniae is independent of
type I IFN signaling in alveolar macrophages and other myeloid cells
Since alveolar macrophages produce and respond to type I IFNs during K. pneumoniae infec-
tion (Fig 2 and S2 Fig) we asked whether alveolar macrophage-intrinsic type I IFN signaling
contributes to the immune response in vivo by using Ifnar1fl/fl-CD11cCre mice. CD11c pro-
moter-driven of Cre recombinase expression results in the deletion of a loxP-flanked allele in
conventional DCs (CD11chigh) and alveolar macrophages [38, 39]. Consistently, Ifnar1 was
deleted in alveolar macrophages isolated from Ifnar1fl/fl-CD11cCre mice (S5A Fig). Ifnar1fl/fl-
CD11cCre mice were similarly resistant against K. pneumoniae infection as Ifnar1fl/flcontrols
(Fig 6B). Expression of the type I IFN target gene Mx1 was significantly reduced in lungs of
Ifnar1fl/fl-CD11cCre mice (Fig 6C) demonstrating that the CD11c+ cells represent a significant
population of type I IFN-responding cells in the lung during K. pneumoniae infection. How-
ever, in agreement with the efficient defense, expression of Ifng, Il12b, and Cxcl10 was not
impaired in Ifnar1fl/fl-CD11cCre mice (Fig 6C). Expression of Tnf, Il10 and Cxcl1 was similar
in both Ifnar1fl/fl-CD11cCre and Ifnarfl/fl mice (Fig 6C). Flow cytometry analysis revealed com-
parable numbers of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes, NK cells as
well as CD4 and CD8 T cells in lungs of Ifnar1fl/fl-CD11cCre and Ifnar1fl/fl mice 12 h after K.
pneumoniae infection (Fig 5D and S5B–S5D Fig). Furthermore, mice lacking Ifnar1 in
macrophages and neutrophils (Ifnar1fl/fl-LysMCre) or neutrophils only (Ifnar1fl/fl-MRP8Cre)
exhibited similar clearance of K. pneumoniae as Ifnar1fl/flcontrols (S6A and S7A Figs). The
expression of type I IFN responsive genes Mx1 and Ifit1 was reduced in Ifnar1fl/fl-LysMCre
and to a lesser extent also in Ifnar1fl/fl-MRP8Cre mice (S6B and S7B Figs). Importantly, expres-
sion of Ifng, Il12b, and Cxcl10 and the numbers of key immune cell subsets were not impaired
in Ifnar1fl/fl-LysMCre and Ifnar1fl/fl-MRP8Cre mice (S6C–S6F and S6C–S6F Fig).
Together, type I IFN signaling in alveolar macrophages and in myeloid cells in general does
not contribute to protective immune responses against K. pneumoniae although these cells
generate a substantial part of the type I IFN signature in the infected lung.

To find out whether the impaired activation and accumulation of NK cells in Ifnar1-/- animals
were causatively involved in the increased susceptibility to K. pneumoniae infection, we carried
out NK cell transfer experiments. NK cells isolated from WT mice were adoptively transferred
into Ifnar1-/- mice using 1 x 106 NK cells per recipient animal. Following K. pneumoniae infec-
tion, lungs of recipient mice were examined for NK cell accumulation, IFN-γ production by
NK cells and bacterial burden. The numbers of donor WT NK cells in lungs of recipient
Ifnar1-/- mice were higher than the numbers of recipients’ own NK cells (i.e., Ifnar1-/- NK cells)
(S8 Fig), consistent with the observation that NK cell accumulation was higher in WT mice

 than in Ifnar1-/- animals (Fig 4B). Importantly, the recipient Ifnar1-/- mice showed similar per-
centages of IFN-γ-producing exogenous WT and endogenous Ifnar1-/- NK cells, and both of
these percentages were significantly higher than the percentage of IFN-γ-producing NK cells
in Ifnar1-/- mice without adoptive transfer (Fig 7A). Thus, the transfer of WT NK cells raised
the percentage of IFN-γ-producing endogenous Ifnar1-/- NK cells. Finally, Ifnar1-/- mice that
received WT NK cells exhibited approximately 10 times lower bacterial loads in lungs and
almost lacked dissemination to the spleen when compared to mice which did not receive WT

 NK cells (Fig 7C and 7D). WT NK cells transferred into WT animals exhibited substantial
IFN-γ production (Fig 7B) but they did not significantly raise bacterial clearance (Fig 7C and
7D), which is in agreement with the efficient defense of WT mice against K. pneumoniae
infection.
These results suggested that the diminished NK cell-derived IFN-γ production was
causative of the impaired bacterial clearance in Ifnar1-/- mice. To test this, Ifnar1-/- mice were
intranasally administered IFN-γ at the time of infection. The IFN-γ treatment boosted the
expression of Ifng and Cxcl10 (Fig 7E) and reduced bacterial loads in lungs (Fig 7F).
In sum, the data show that donor WT NK cells display similar properties in recipient
Ifnar1-/- mice as in WT mice. Thus, the deficient NK cell accumulation and lower percentage
of IFN-γ-producing NK cells observed in Ifnar1-/- mice (Fig 4B and 4C) result from a cell-
autonomous defect. Moreover, Ifnar1-deficient NK cells regain the ability to produce IFN-γ if
macrophage priming is accomplished by exogenous IFN-γ or by IFN-γ derived from trans-
ferred WT NK cells.
Discussion
In this study, we examined the role and mechanisms of action of type I IFN signaling in the
context of lung infection with K. pneumoniae, a pathogen with one of the highest emergence of
antibiotic resistant strains [2–4]. Our findings identify type I IFN signaling as a key driver of
the mutually activating crosstalk between NK cells and alveolar macrophages which ultimately
results in bacterial clearance and successful host defense. This discovery reveals a previously
unrecognized mechanism of type I IFN-mediated anti-bacterial immunity and sheds light into
regulation of immune responses against an utmost challenging human pathogen.
The protective effect of type I IFNs against K. pneumoniae-triggered pneumonia is caused
by different mechanisms than those reported for other bacterial pathogens with the same tro-
pism. Defense against S. pneumoniae, a gram-positive pathogen, is dependent on type I IFN
signaling in alveolar epithelial type II cells. These cells require type I IFN signals to resist the
destructive and death-promoting environment elicited in the course of S. pneumoniae infec-
tion [12]. The absence of type I IFN signaling causes an excessive destruction of the lung epi-
thelial barrier and subsequent massive systemic dissemination of the pathogen. The lung
barrier function is supported by type I IFNs by their protective effects on epithelial tight junc-
tions and by inhibition of bacterial transmigration [11]. The protective effects of type I IFNs
against infection with the gram negative intracellular pathogen L. pneumophila result from
inhibition of the intracellular replication of the pathogen in infected macrophages [15]. The
key type I IFN effector in this context appears to be the bactericidal itaconic acid which is pro-
duced by an enzyme encoded by the type I IFN target gene Irg1 [15]. In contrast, the protective
effects of type I IFNs against K. pneumoniae described in our study result from NK cell-depen-
dent IFN-γ-mediated restriction of bacterial growth. IFN-γ controls K. pneumoniae growth in
the lung but the precise mechanism has not been elucidated [22]. Lung failure resulting from
exacerbated infection-elicited tissue destruction is a critical aspect of pneumonia since mitiga-
tion of lung injury and/or lessening of inflammation is associated with disease amelioration
[40, 41]. Thus, the higher and progressively increasing bacterial burden and tissue injury in the

 lung of K. pneumoniae-infected Ifnar1-deficient mice suggest that these mice ultimately suffer
respiratory failure.
It is well established that type I IFNs are typically induced following intracellular sensing of
invading and/or phagocytosed bacteria thereby resembling induction by viruses, i.e. obligatory
intracellular pathogens [9, 10]. This intracellular signaling principle applies also to the cell wall
component LPS which activates the IFN-β-inducing TBK1-IRF3 pathway upon signaling ema-
nating from the LPS-TLR4 complex localized in the endosomal membrane [42]. Our study
reveals that this intracellular signaling is also the driver of type I IFN induction by K. pneumo-
niae which triggers the TBK/IRF3 pathway upon TLR4-dependent recognition of LPS and the
capsule polysaccharide (CPS). Most common bacterial inducers of type IFNs are cell wall com-
ponents (e.g. LPS) and nucleic acids (both RNA and DNA) [10]. The capacity of individual
inducers to activate type I IFN production appears to be different in different innate immune
cell types [13] leaving open the possibility that K. pneumoniae employs other inducers in addi-
tion to LPS and CPS in vivo. Interestingly, the K. pneumoniae-induced type I IFNs have no
autocrine functions since mice lacking Ifnar1 in alveolar macrophages, the key sentinel cells in
the lung [43], are similarly resistant to infection as Ifnar1-proficient mice. This is in marked
contrast to skin infection with S. pyogenes in which myeloid cells are both the key type I IFN
producer and effector cells [14]. Our data demonstrate that type I IFNs promote production of
IFN-γ, a critical activator of antimicrobial effector functions of macrophages, by NK cells in K.
pneumoniae infection. The mechanism of antimicrobial macrophage activation by IFN-γ
involves primarily the stimulation of oxidative burst but other effector functions are emerging
[37, 44]. For example, the IFN target genes GBPs (guanylate-binding proteins), which are
linked to phagosomal processes, and IFN-γ-stimulated metabolic reprogramming have been
implicated in microbial killing by macrophages [44, 45]. Interestingly, recent evidence demon-
strates the ability of K. pneumoniae to manipulate phagosome maturation and survive antimi-
crobial attacks by macrophages [46] suggesting that IFN-γ might counteract such phagosome
evasion mechanisms of K. pneumoniae. Future studies should investigate molecular mecha-
nisms of K. pneumoniae eradication by macrophages in detail. Importantly, our data show that
such mechanisms are activated by IFN-γ but not type I IFNs since autocrine type I IFN signal-
ing in alveolar macrophages is dispensable for both macrophage priming and protective
immune response. Type I IFN and type II IFN (i.e. IFN-γ) signaling pathways share the tran-
scription factor STAT1, raising the therapeutically important question of STAT1 target genes
acting as specific effectors of IFN-γ signaling during host defense against K. pneumoniae
infection.
We provide complementary evidence for the fundamental importance of NK cell-autono-
mous type I IFN signaling in defense against K. pneumoniae infection. First, the use of
Ifnar1fl/fl-Cd11cCre, Ifnar1fl/fl-LysMCre and Ifnar1fl/fl-MRP8Cre mouse strains allows the
conclusion that type I IFN signaling in none of the major myeloid cell subsets present in
infected lungs contributes to IFN-γ and IL-12 production, and to host defense. Second, WT
NK cells introduced into Ifnar1-/- mice produce IFN-γ in the Ifnar1-deficient environment
and promote bacterial clearance. The NK cell-intrinsic requirement for type I IFN signaling
in IFN-γ production in the course of K. pneumoniae infection is unprecedented in the con-
text of bacterial infections studied to date. Interestingly, Ifnar1-/- NK cells retain the ability to
induce IFN-γ in K. pneumoniae-infected Ifnar1-/- mice, as evident from IFN-γ production
by Ifnar1-/- NK cells after adoptive transfer of WT NK cells. Classically, NK cell production
of IFN-γ is triggered by IL-12 originating from various subsets of myeloid cells [47]. This
implies that in context of the NK cell transfer experiment, the WT NK-derived IFN-γ restores
macrophage priming and IL-12 production which in turn activate NK cells regardless of their
type I IFN signaling capacity.

 Type I IFNs can directly stimulate NK cells to produce IFN-γ in response to certain viral
infections [48, 49]. It is speculated that this mode of IFN-γ production is relevant during infec-
tion with viruses which induce little or no IL-12 such as the lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus [48]. Type I IFN-mediated NK cell stimulation involves direct activation of the IFN-γ
gene driver STAT4 by the type I IFN receptor-associated JAK kinases [50, 51]. Such activation
has so far not been reported for bacterial infections. Our experiment showing that administra-
tion of IFN-β alone does not result in IFN-γ induction indicates that type I IFNs act on NK
cells in concert with accessory signals generated during K. pneumoniae infection. This mecha-
nism would resemble IL-12 production by myeloid cells which requires signals derived from
the pathogen recognition and from IFN-γ. NK cells express several pattern recognition recep-
tors, e.g. TLR2 and TLR4, which potentially provide means for activation by bacterial products
[52, 53]. However, the relevance of TLRs for NK cell activation during bacterial infections is
unclear as NK cell-autonomous MyD88-dependent TLR signaling does not contribute to NK
cell stimulation [54]. Of emerging interest are NK cytotoxic receptors since the activating
receptor NKp46 and the mouse ortholog NCR1 have recently been demonstrated to act as pat-
tern recognition receptors for Fusobacterium nucleatum and Candida glabrata [55, 56]. Thus,
activating NK cell receptors might provide accessory signals for induction of IFN-γ by type I
IFNs in the course of bacterial diseases such as the K. pneumoniae lung infection described in
this study. The prominent role of type I IFN signaling in IFN-γ induction is in line with
increased susceptibility of TRIF-deficient mice to K. pneumoniae infection [57]. TRIF-defi-
cient mice exhibit impaired IFN-γ induction during K. pneumoniae infection and display
improved resistance if treated with exogenous IFN-γ [57]. Our data showing the requirement
for TRIF in IFN-β induction suggest that the impairment of IFN-γ production in TRIF-deleted
mice is secondary to the deficient type I IFN (e.g. IFN-β) production in these mice. The excep-
tionally tight link between type I IFN signaling and NK cell IFN-γ production might represent
a specific feature of defense against K. pneumoniae.
By virtue of their inhibition of viral replication type I IFNs became the first cytokines to be
used in therapy of human diseases, most notably in infections caused by the hepatitis C virus
[58, 59]. In contrast, the use of type I IFNs or their effectors for therapy of infectious diseases
caused by bacteria is currently precluded by their incompletely understood and disparate
effects during bacterial infections. Our study reveals an unexpected dependence of NK cell
IFN-γ production on NK cell-intrinsic type I IFN signaling during bacterial pneumonia. This
mechanism of IFN-γ induction and the resulting anti-bacterial activation of macrophages are
indispensable for successful defense against K. pneumoniae lung infection. The increasing
isolation of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae strains makes an urgent priority to develop
effective therapeutics based on new targets and concepts. K. pneumoniae is exemplary of the
mismatch between unmet medical needs and the current antimicrobial research and develop-
ment pipeline. Arguably, therapies targeting the immune responses which thereby circumvent
antibiotic resistance are highly desirable. Our study reveals an important and therapeutically
exploitable aspect of immune defense against K. pneumoniae. Importantly, clinical records
reporting frequent K. pneumoniae infections in patients deficient in IL-12 [60] suggest that the
type I IFN-driven communication network between IFN-γ-producing NK cells and IL-12-pro-
ducing myeloid cells is relevant also for humans.

Mice
Mice were bred and kept under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions according to recom-
mendations of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Association (FELASA).
Ifnar1-/- mice have been previously described [61]. Ifnar1fl/fl-CD11c-Cre, Ifnar1fl/fl-LysMCre
and Ifnar1fl/fl-MRP8Cre mice were obtained by crossing Ifnar1fl/flmice [62] with CD11c-Cre
mice, LysMCre and MRP8Cre [38, 63, 64], respectively, and littermate Cre+ and Cre- control
mice were used. All mice were on C57BL/6 background. C57BL/6N wild type (WT) mice were
purchased from Charles River (Vienna) and Harlan (Belfast). Experiments were carried out
using 7–12 weeks old mice with age and gender being matched between genotypes. For experi-
ments requiring anesthesia, a solution of 10 mg/ml ketamine and 1 mg/ml xylazine (aniMe-
dica) in isotonic saline (Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.).
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
K. pneumoniae 52.145 is a clinical isolate (serotype O1:K2) belonging to the CC65K2 virulent
clonal group [5, 65]. The isogenic capsule mutant, strain 52145-ΔwcaK2, has been described
[66]. The LPS O-polysaccharide mutants, targeting the glf glycolstransfrase essential for the
LPS O-polysaccharide biosynthesis [67] were constructed by insertion mutagenesis using the
pir replication dependent plasmid pSF100 (to be described elsewhere). Bacteria were grown in
LB medium at 37˚C and carbenicillin 50 μg/ml was added to the growth medium to grow O-
polysaccharide mutants.
Cell culture and cell infections
Immortalized BMDM (iBMDM) cells (BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH, wild-type, NR-9456;
Trif-/-, NR-9566; Tram-/-, NR-9567; Myd88-/-, NR-15633; and Trif-/-Tram-/- mice, NR-9568)
were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco 41965) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin
(Gibco) at 37˚C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Murine alveolar macrophages MH-S
(ATCC, CRL-2019) were grown in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin
(Gibco) and 10 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasma con-
tamination. To isolate BMDMs, tibias and femurs from wild-type, irf3-/- and tlr4-/- knock-out
mice were removed using a sterile technique and the bone marrow was flushed with fresh
medium. To obtain macrophages, cells were plated in L929-conditioned medium and culti-
vated for 4–6 days. Medium was replaced with fresh supplemented media every 3 days. For
infections, bacteria were adjusted to an OD600 of 1.0 in PBS and infections were performed
using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 70 bacteria per cell. To synchronize infection, plates
were centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 min. For incubation times longer than 60 min, bacteria were

1 ml of cold PBS + 0.5 mM EDTA. Obtained bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) from mice
of the same genotype (n � 6) were pooled on ice. Cells were collected from BALF by centrifu-
gation (10 min, room temperature, 400 x g), resuspended and cultured in RPMI + 10% FCS +
1% penicillin and streptomycin. After 2 h, adherent cells were > 95% AMs as determined by
trypan blue staining and were seeded for stimulation at the final concentration of 2 x 105 cells/
ml in RPMI + 10% FCS. For priming, cells were pretreated with 5 ng/ml mouse IFN-γ
(eBioscience) for 5 h, followed by infection (MOI = 70) for 1 h. To synchronize infection,
plates were centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 min. One hour after treatment with gentamicin
(150 μg/ml) cells were lysed using Isol-RNA Lysis Reagent (5 Prime) and RNA was isolated.
Model of lung infection
Bacteria in the stationary phase (overnight culture) were sub-cultured and grown at 37˚C with
agitation to reach mid log phase. Subsequently, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (20
min, 2500 x g, 24˚C), resuspended in 1x PBS and adjusted to 5 x 104–1 x 105 colony forming
units (CFU) per 30 μl as determined by plating 10-fold serial dilutions on LB plates. Mice were
anesthetized and 30 μl of bacterial suspension were inoculated intranasally. Infected animals
were monitored every 4 to 8 hours and were euthanized when reaching behavioral and/or
pathophysiological humane endpoints. Survival was monitored for 10 days. For experiments
other than survival, animals were euthanized at indicated time points by either cervical dislo-
cation or anesthetic overdose.
Determination of bacterial loads
To determine bacterial loads, mice were euthanized at indicated time points. Lungs, spleens
and livers were aseptically removed, weighted and placed in cold 1 x PBS. After mechanical
homogenization, 10-fold dilution series were prepared from organ homogenates and plated on
LB plates. The following day, colonies were counted and bacterial load was calculated as colony
forming units (CFUs) per gram of tissue.
Histology
Mice were euthanized by anesthetic overdose. To collect lungs for histology trachea was surgi-
cally exposed and cannulated (BD Angiocath). 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) was injected
through trachea to inflate lungs, followed by their aseptic dissection from the thoracic cage.
Inflated lungs were fixed overnight in excessive volume of 4% PFA, dehydrated, embedded in
paraffin and 3 μm thick sections were prepared. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the
sections was performed according to the standard protocol. H&E stained slides were evaluated
by a board certified pathologist using an Axioskop 2 MOT microscope (Carl Zeiss). For addi-
tional review and image acquisition, representative slides were scanned using a Pannoramic
Scan II slide scanner (3D Histech). Digital images were acquired with the Pannoramic Slide
Viewer software (3D Histech). Sections were examined for airway inflammation (inflamma-
tory cell infiltration of the intrapulmonary airways, alveolar ducts and alveoli), neutrophilic
infiltration and intralesional bacterial burden (qualitative/semi-quantitative extent of bacterial

 presence within the regions of inflammation). Standard pathology criteria were used to score
histomorphologic features of the lesion—degree of the lesion and the extent of involvement:
score 0 –none/insignificant; score 1 –minimal; less than 10%, score 2 –mild; 10 to 30%, score
3 –moderate; 30–60% and score 4 –severe, more than 60%.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and cytokine
measurement
Lung homogenates of infected and uninfected mice were prepared as for determination of bac-
terial load in 1x PBS containing protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor, Roche) and
frozen at -80˚C. Homogenates were subjected to two cycles of thawing and freezing, centri-
fuged (5 min, 16000 x g, 4˚C) and supernatants were collected for further measurements. Cyto-
kine concentrations of TNF, IL-1β, IFN-γ and IL-12p70 were measured in supernatants using
DuoSet ELISA kits (R&D Systems). Kits were used according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Total protein in lungs was determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scien-
tific) and used for normalization purposes.
Immunoblot analysis
Lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (1x SDS Sample Buffer, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2%
w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mM DTT, 0.01% w/v bromophenol blue). Proteins were resolved by
standard 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes
were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in TBST and protein bands were detected
with specific antibodies using chemiluminescence reagents and a G:BOX Chemi XRQ chemi-
luminescence imager (Syngene). The following rabbit antibodies were used: anti-phospho
IRF3 (Ser 396) (1:1000; Cell Signaling #4947), anti-phospho-TBK1 (Ser 172) (1:1000; Cell Sig-
naling #5483), and anti-ISG15 (1:1000; Cell Signaling #9636). Immunoreactive bands were
visualized by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immuno-
globulins (1:5000) or goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (1:1000; Bio-Rad). To ensure that
equal amounts of proteins were loaded, blots were re-probed with α-tubulin (1:3000; Sigma-
Aldrich). To detect multiple proteins, membranes were re-probed after stripping of previously
used antibodies using a pH 2.2 glycine-HCl/SDS buffer.
Type I IFN bioassay
Cells were seeded in (6-well plate; 1 x 106 cells per well) and grown for 24 h. Cells were
infected (MOI = 100) for the indicated time points, and supernatants were collected. Murine
type I IFNs were detected using B16-Blue IFN-α/β cells (Invivogen) which carry a SEAP
reporter gene under the control of the type I IFN-inducible ISG54 promoter enhanced by a
multimeric ISRE. Levels of SEAP in the supernatants were determined as per the manufactur-
er’s instructions.
Intracellular survival
K. pneumoniae intracellular survival was assessed as previously described with minor modifi-
cations [46]. Briefly, macrophages were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of
2.5 x 105 cells per well 15 h before the experiment. Bacteria were grown in 5-ml LB, harvested
in the exponential phase (2500 x g, 20 min, 24˚C), washed once with PBS and a suspension
containing approximately 1 x 108 CFU/ml was prepared in 10 mM PBS (pH 6.5). Cells were
infected with 175 μl of this suspension to obtain MOI of 70 bacteria per cell in a final volume
of 1 ml DMEM tissue culture medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS and 10

 mM Hepes. To synchronize infection, plates were centrifuged at 200 x g during 5 min. After
30 min of contact, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for additional 60 min with
1 ml tissue culture medium supplemented with gentamicin (100 μg/ml) to eliminate extracel-
lular bacteria. Initial attachment of bacteria was assessed after 30 min contact as previously
described [46]. To determine intracellular bacterial load, cells were washed three times with
PBS and lysed with 300 μl of 0.05% saponin in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Serial
dilutions were plated on LB to quantify the number of intracellular bacteria. Intracellular bac-
terial load is represented as CFU per ml. All experiments were done on at least three indepen-
dent occasions.
RNA isolation, reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA was isolated from lung homogenates and cells using Isol-RNA Lysis Reagent (5
Prime) or Trizol according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNase digestion was performed
using 10 U of recombinant DNase I (Roche). RNA was PolyA primed with Oligo (dT)18 prim-
ers (Eurofins Genomics) and reverse-transcribed using Mu-MLV reverse transcriptase (Fer-
mentas). qPCRs were run on a Realplex Mastercycler (Eppendorf) or Stratagene Mx3005P
qPCR System and cDNA was quantified by SYBR Green method using HOT FIREPol Eva-
Green qPCR supermix (Medibena) or KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Kit. mRNA expression of the
housekeeping gene Hprt was used for normalization purposes. Primers for qPCR were (in 5’-3’
orientation):

Flow cytometry
To prepare whole lung cell suspensions, lungs were cut to pieces with scissors and digested in
RPMI containing 10% FCS, 1 mg/ml collagenase I (Roche) and 0.25 mg/ml DNase I (Roche)
for 1 h at 37˚C with agitation. Single-cell suspensions were obtained by flushing the samples
through 70 μm strainer. Red blood cells were lysed using hypotonic shock and washed twice
with PBS. To exclude dead cells, samples were stained with FVD eFluor 506 (eBioscience),
prior to Fc blocking with anti-CD16/CD32 (2.4G2, BD). Suspensions were stained for cell sur-
face proteins and intracellular IFN-γ in appropriate combinations of following monoclonal
antibodies conjugated to allophycocyanin-eFluor 780, allophycocyanin, brilliant violet 711,
phycoerythrin, brilliant violet 421, phycoerythtrin-cyanine7, peridinin chlorophyll protein-

26c(11–26)), anti-CD8 (53–6.7), anti-NK1.1 (PK136) and anti IFN-γ (XMG1.2), purchased
from BD, eBioscience and Biolegend. To prepare cells for intracellular staining, suspensions
were incubated in fixation/permeabilization buffer (eBioscience), followed by Fc blocking,
washing and staining in permeabilization buffer (eBioscience). Dead cells were excluded based
on their light-scattering characteristics and FVD staining. Cell doublets were excluded based
on FSC-H/FSC-A and SSC-H/SSC-A. All data acquisitions were performed using LSR Fortessa
II (BD) cytometer interfaced with FACSDiva. FlowJo X (Tree Star) software was used for data
analysis and graphical representation.
Sorting of alveolar macrophages
Mice were either infected or given PBS and euthanized 24 h post-treatment. Lungs were har-
vested, and dissociated using VDI 12 tissue homogeniser (VWR) in sterile PBS. Single-cell sus-
pensions were obtained by flushing the samples through 70 μm strainer. To exclude dead cells,
samples were stained with FVD eFluor 506 (eBioscience), prior to Fc blocking with anti-
CD16/CD32 (2.4G2, BD). To sort out CD45+CD11chighSiglecF+ alveolar macrophages, cell
suspensions were stained for cell surface proteins using monoclonal antibodies conjugated to
allophycocyanin-eFluor 780, allophycocyanin and brilliant violet 421: anti-CD45 (30-F11),
anti-CD11c (N418) and anti-SiglecF (E50-2440), purchased from BD Bioscience, eBioscience
and Biolegend. RNA from sorted alveolar macrophages was extracted using Power SYBR
Green Cells-to-CT Kit (4402954, Ambion) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
NK isolation and adoptive transfer
Splenic NK cells from WT mice were isolated by magnetic bead labeling (CD49b+ DX5
microbeads) following manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). Before magnetic separa-
tion, 1 x 107 cells were labeled with CellTrace CFSE kit (Thermo) according to the manufactur-
er’s protocol. Labeled NK cells (1 x 106 cells/mouse) were adoptively transferred intravenously
into ifnar1-/- mice, which were infected intranasally with 3 x 105 K. pneumoniae 52.145 CFU.
24 h post infection mice were euthanized and bacterial loads in lungs determined. Intracellular
IFN-γ was detected using anti IFN-γ (XMG1.2). Cells were analyzed using a FACSCantoII
flow cytometer and FlowJo software (Tree Star).
IFN-γ treatment of animals
For IFN-γ rescue analysis, Ifnar1-/- mice were infected with standard inoculum, and imme-
diately post-infection intranasally given 20 μl of PBS, or 100 ng rIFN-γ in 20 μl of PBS
(recombinant Mouse IFN-gamma Protein, R&D, Carrier Free, cat. number 485-MI-100,
LOT#CFP2516032). Mice were euthanized 24 h p.i. and bacterial loads and mRNA expres-
sion in lungs were determined.
IFN-β treatment of animals
Mice were anesthetized and inoculated intranasally with 30 μl PBS containing 30,000 U car-
rier-free recombinant mouse IFN-β (PBL Interferon Source, LOT#6450). Control animals
received 30 μl of PBS. 6 h post-treatment animals were euthanized and total RNA was isolated
from the lungs.
