Objective To quantify early auditory exposures in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and evaluate how these
are related to medical and environmental factors. We hypothesized that there would be less auditory exposure in
the NICU private room, compared with the open ward.
Study design Preterm infants born at ≤ 28 weeks gestation (33 in the open ward, 25 in private rooms) had au-
ditory exposure quantified at birth, 30 and 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), and term equivalent age using the
Language Environmental Acquisition device.
Results Meaningful language (P < .0001), the number of adult words (P < .0001), and electronic noise (P < .0001)
increased across PMA. Silence increased (P = .0007) and noise decreased (P < .0001) across PMA. There was
more silence in the private room (P = .02) than the open ward, with an average of 1.9 hours more silence in a
16-hour period. There was an interaction between PMA and room type for distant words (P = .01) and average
decibels (P = .04), indicating that changes in auditory exposure across PMA were different for infants in private
rooms compared with infants in the open ward. Medical interventions were related to more noise in the environ-
ment, although parent presence (P = .009) and engagement (P = .002) were related to greater language expo-
sure. Average sound levels in the NICU were 58.9 ± 3.6 decibels, with an average peak level of 86.9 ± 1.4 decibels.
Conclusions Understanding the NICU auditory environment paves the way for interventions that reduce high levels
of adverse sound and enhance positive forms of auditory exposure, such as language. (J Pediatr 2017;183:56-66).
T
he auditory environment of the preterm infant differs considerably from the environment in-utero. Intense forms of
non-natural sounds in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), such as ventilatory support, have been reported1-4 and
sound levels in the often chaotic environment may exceed the decibel recommendations of the American Academy of
Pediatrics. This is important because the overstimulating environment of the NICU may have adverse effects on the growth
and development of preterm infants.5-7
To increase family involvement and to decrease the risk of overstimulation, hospitals around the world are converting tra-
ditional open ward NICUs to private rooms.8 Positive benefits of private rooms reported in the scientific literature include a
decreased need for medical procedures, decreased stress, improved neurobehavior, and better long-term outcomes.9-11 Despite
these benefits, a prior study also showed that infants hospitalized in the presumably quieter environment of the NICU private
room exhibited lower language scores at 2 years of age12 than infants hospitalized in open ward NICUs. This previous work,
however, did not measure auditory exposure.
Although auditory exposure in the NICU is important for the developing preterm
infant,13-17 the appropriate amount or type of auditory exposure has not been
defined. The aim of this study was to measure the auditory environment in the
NICU and to determine medical, environmental, and sociodemographic factors
that predicted the infant’s auditory exposure in the NICU. We hypothesized that
there would be less auditory exposure in the NICU private room, compared with
the open ward. We explored this and other medical and environmental factors that
impact the sound environment in the NICU.
Methods
The study was approved by the Washington University Human Research Protec-
tion Office, and parents provided informed consent. Language and sound were
quantified longitudinally at 4 different time periods across hospitalization: within

 2 weeks of birth, at 30 and 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA),
and again at term equivalent age (between 37 and 40 weeks
PMA).
Fifty-eight consecutive preterm infants born at ≤28 weeks
gestation were recruited from August 2012 to October 2014.
Exclusion criteria were failed hearing screening, multiple birth,
and congenital anomalies. The study site was the 75-bed level
IV NICU at St. Louis Children’s Hospital (St. Louis, Mis-
souri) that has 38 traditional open ward beds and 37 private
rooms. As part of routine care, infants were assigned to a bed
space in either the open ward or in a private room upon ad-
mission, based on bed availability and staffing, and remained
in the assigned room type for their entire hospitalization. Private
rooms had an average area of 168 square feet and were en-
closed by 3 walls, with a sliding glass door for the fourth wall.
The open ward was composed of 4 large rooms (ranging from
802 to 1375 square feet) with 8-14 beds per room. The nurse
to infant ratio varied, based on staffing and medical complex-
ity, but typically was 1 nurse for every 2 infants, and was similar
whether an infant was in the open ward or private room. As
part of the standard of care, parents were welcome in the NICU
24 hours a day Mothers were encouraged to engage in the care
of their infant and to put their infants skin-to-skin when vis-
iting. Loungers were available at the bedside in both open ward
and private rooms. Volunteers were available to hold infants
whose parents were unable to visit, but this was imple-
mented inconsistently during the study time period, and vol-
unteers typically held older infants as they approached term
age.
Study Procedures
The Language Environmental Acquisition (LENA) (LENA Re-
search Foundation, Boulder, Colorado) device is a digital lan-
guage processor that captures environmental sound for up to
16 hours. The LENA has been used in previous research on
infants in the NICU at 32 weeks PMA and 36 weeks PMA, jus-
tifying it as an appropriate method of capturing noise and lan-
guage in the NICU.14 Before the study started, 2 methods of
recording were evaluated. The quantification of sound was
similar when the LENA was hanging in the infant’s bed (within
a pouch that was cut out from the vest) and when the infant
wore it in a vest (the recommended method). As it would be
less invasive for the infant, for this study, the LENA was hung
on the infant’s crib or inside the incubator within 2 feet of the
infant’s ear. A sign at the bedside indicated the LENA was in
use during the recordings (as required by the institutional review
board). LENA recordings commenced before 10 a.m. each
morning and automatically ended 16 hours later. Data from
the digital language processor was downloaded into the LENA
Pro software, which generates an estimate of the amount of
time spent with meaningful words, distant words, electronic
sounds, noise, and silence. Each outcome variable was re-
corded as the amount of time it was the predominant audi-
tory stimulus in the room over a 16-hour period. In addition,
the LENA software defined the number of adult words heard
during each recording as well as the highest and average decibel
levels in the infant’s auditory environment. The LENA quan-
tified sound at 4 different time points: within 2 weeks of birth,
at 30 and 34 weeks PMA, and at term-equivalent age (37-40
weeks PMA). When an infant was born at 28 weeks gesta-
tion, the birth recording was often the same as the 30 weeks
PMA recording. The infant’s PMA on the day of each record-
ing was recorded.
Environmental factors during the sound recordings were
documented. These included room type (open ward or private
room), the census in the NICU and in the infant’s room (for
open wards), bed type (incubator or open crib), parental pres-
ence or absence, the number of times a parent held the infant,
the number of pumps (defined as any device that delivered
fluids via nasogastric or intravenous line and produced sounds
upon completion or interruption), and the type of respira-
tory support (room air, oxygen via nasal cannula, continu-
ous positive airway pressure, mechanical ventilation, or high-
frequency oscillatory ventilation).
Infants were placed in an incubator on admission and were
transitioned to a crib when they were able to maintain tem-
perature (at approximately 1800 g). Maternal factors were col-
lected from the medical record at the time of the infant’s birth,
including age, marital status, education level (dichotomized
as college education or no college education), the number of
prenatal visits, delivery type, and prenatal illicit drug expo-
sure (from toxicology reports at delivery). Social factors were
collected, including the infant’s sex and race (dichotomized
as African American or non-African American). Medical factors
were collected from the medical record. These included esti-
mated gestational age at birth, birth weight, head circumfer-
ence at birth, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, use of prenatal
or postnatal steroids, days on total parenteral nutrition,
total days of breast milk feedings, breast milk at discharge,
presence of moderate to severe brain injury (defined as having
either a grade III-IV intraventricular hemorrhage, cystic
periventricular leukomalacia, or cerebellar hemorrhage as de-
termined by cranial ultrasound scan and/or magnetic reso-
nance imaging), presence of patent ductus arteriosus (treated
with indomethacin or surgical ligation), necrotizing entero-
colitis (all stages), retinopathy of prematurity requiring sur-
gical intervention, score on the Clinical Risk Index for Babies
(CRIB),18 length of stay, days, and types of respiratory equip-
ment (high-frequency oscillation, mechanical ventilation, con-
tinuous positive airway pressure, high humidity, nasal cannula),
total oxygen hours (including time on any of the aforemen-
tioned), and oxygen requirement at 36 weeks PMA.
Statistical Analyses
For variables of meaningful words, distant words, electronic
sounds, noise, and adult word count, a log transformation of
the sound measurements were used to stabilize the variance.
We tested for room type, PMA, and room type by PMA in-
teraction using a mixed random effects repeated measures
ANOVA model (with infant within room type as the random
effect). When the room type by PMA interaction was signifi-
cant (P < .05), the effect of PMA, stratified by the room type,
was explored. When the interaction was not significant, we in-
vestigated the relationships of PMA and sound as well as the

 relationships between room type and sound using main effects.
The relationships between medical, sociodemographic, and en-
vironmental factors were investigated using Pearson correla-
tion coefficients. Because of a large number of relationships
explored, a strict P value of .01 was considered significant when
identifying predictors of auditory exposure.
Results
Fifty-eight infants were enrolled (33 in open ward and 25 in
private rooms). Ten infants expired before discharge (6 in open
ward and 4 in private rooms). Data obtained from deceased
infants were included in the analyses.
There were 52 sound recordings at birth, 50 recordings at
30 weeks PMA, 48 recordings at 34 weeks PMA, and 44 re-
cordings at term equivalent age. Infants who died did not have
recordings at birth (n = 4), 30 weeks (n = 8), 34 weeks (n = 10),
and term PMA (n = 10). Two infants whose birth and 30-
week recordings overlapped did not have recordings at birth.
Four infants were discharged before the term recording. Table I
shows the characteristics of the 48 infants (27 in open ward
and 21 in private room) who were enrolled into the study and
discharged from the NICU.
Table II shows the quantification of auditory exposure across
all time points for open wards and private rooms. Average
sound levels in the NICU were 58.9 ± 3.6 decibels, with an
average peak level of 86.9 ± 1.4 decibels.
There were significant ANOVA interactions between PMA
and room type for distant words (P = .01) and average deci-

Auditory Exposure in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: Room Type and Other Predictors
 room (P = .01) between birth and term equivalent age.Average
sound levels decreased by 5.2 decibels at term compared with
birth in the open ward and 2.8 decibels at term compared with
birth in the private room. There were no interactions of room
type and PMA for meaningful language, adult words, elec-
tronic sound, silence, and noise.
In the ANOVA, there were significant main effects of PMA
with meaningful language (P < .0001; average of 26 minutes
more in a 16-hour period at term compared with birth),
number of adult words (P < .0001; 4490 more words in a 16-
hour period at term compared with birth), and electronic noise
(P < .0001; 4 hours 2 minutes more electronic sound in a 16-
hour period at term compared with birth). Silence increased
(P = .0007; 4 hours 4 minutes more silence in a 16-hour period
at term compared with at birth), and noise decreased (P < .0001;
1 hour 39 minutes more noise in a 16-hour period at term com-
pared with at birth) across PMA. There were no differences
in peak decibels across PMA.

 The only main effect related to room type was silence. Com-
pared with the open ward, there was significantly more silence
in the private room (P = .02), with an average of 1.9 hours more
silence in the private room in a 16-hour period. There were
no other main effects related to room type.
Correlations at all 4 time points between medical, social, and
environmental factors and auditory exposure are shown in
Table III. Medical interventions, such as mechanical ventila-
tion (P < .0001) were related to more noise in the environ-
ment, although parent presence (P = .009) and holding of the
infant (P = .002) were related to greater adult word expo-
sure. Table III lists all correlations with a P value of <.01. Un-
listed correlations were not significant.
Table IV (available at www.jpeds.com) provides descrip-
tions of sound in each room type based on whether parents
visited on the day of the recording.
Discussion
The key findings of this study are that there was less auditory
exposure in private rooms compared with the open ward, with
an average of 1.9 hours more silence in a 16-hour period in
the private room compared with the open ward. Infants in both
types of rooms were exposed to seemingly very little mean-
ingful language, and total language exposure did not differ

Auditory Exposure in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: Room Type and Other Predictors
 across the 2 room types. More language exposure was ob-
served with infants whose parents were present and engaged
in holding. Medical equipment (such as high-frequency os-
cillator ventilation and oxygen delivered via a nasal cannula)
was associated with more noise exposure. Medically fragile
infants were exposed to more sound, especially during the
initial, medically complicated early weeks of their NICU stay.
Auditory exposure decreased and language exposure in-
creased as infants grew closer to their due dates. Although au-
ditory exposure may have potential benefits for the preterm
infant in the NICU, the average sound levels in the NICU in
this study exceeded the American Academy of Pediatrics
recommendations.
Preterm infants may spend months in the NICU during a
critical period of brain development.19,20 Previous research has
demonstrated that auditory exposure during the final trimes-
ter of pregnancy may be necessary for brain development and
optimal outcomes and, therefore, equally important in the weeks
spent in the NICU for the preterm infant.21 During this im-
portant period of development, substantial changes occur in
response to the auditory environment. The connections between
the cochlea and the brainstem are established by 24-25 weeks
gestation, and between the temporal lobe and the auditory
cortex (non-primary) as early as 30-31 weeks gestation.22 Au-
ditory evoked potentials are evident by the 28th week of ges-
tation, and there is a marked reduction in response as neural

 pathways mature from 28 through 34 weeks gestation.23 It has
also been proposed that experiencing mother’s voice before
birth is critical for typical brain development24,25 and that the
timed auditory input of low-frequency sounds experienced in
utero followed by the addition of higher frequency sounds ex-
perienced ex utero is important for normal auditory
development.26
Our group has reported greater impairment in language out-
comes, as well as differences in early brain development, among
infants hospitalized in private rooms in a NICU with low parent
visitation and holding rates.12 The present study builds on these
findings by defining the auditory environment in the 2 dif-
ferent room types and identifying a plausible mechanism for
the observation of poorer language outcome in infants in the
private rooms. At term equivalent age, there was an average
of 3 hours more silence in a 16-hour period in the private room
(Table II), which is roughly 30% more silence than in the open
ward. The finding of decreased auditory exposure in this study
is consistent with other studies reporting diminished sound
in the NICU private room.3,27
Although we were unable to demonstrate differences in lan-
guage exposure across the 2 room types in the current study,
previous work has defined the importance of language expo-
sure for the development of preterm infants. Preterm infants
exposed to more language demonstrate more vocalizations
before NICU discharge and higher scores on tests of

Auditory Exposure in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: Room Type and Other Predictors
 language abilities in early childhood.14 Infants with mothers
with low communication skills also have been shown to have
relatively poor language skills in early childhood.28 More
language exposure in the NICU is associated with better
developmental outcome, and more auditory exposure in the
NICU environment has been associated with better language
and motor outcomes.14,17 Correlations between parent pres-
ence and holding and language exposure were identified in the
current study. These findings could indicate the need for in-
terventions that help inform and support parents in engag-
ing with their infants. In addition, these findings are a potential
explanation for the positive outcomes of infants cared for in
private rooms in a NICU with high rates of parent engagement.9
Another recent report showed that good parent involvement
in either room type was related to better cognitive and lan-
guage outcomes.29 These data lend support to targeting inter-
ventions towards parents, who can significantly alter the
early experiences of preterm infants in the NICU. This in turn
may have a lasting positive impact on the development of the
child.
Although sound and language exposure have substantial ben-
efits for the infant, too much noise can also be harmful. The
American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that sound levels
in the NICU not exceed 45 decibels.1 This recommendation
is based on findings of hearing loss in children who were cared
for in the NICU as well as changes in the behavioral and physi-
ological responses of infants exposed to high levels of noise
in the NICU.30-32 Similar to studies from other NICUs, the
average sound levels in this study exceeded American Academy
of Pediatrics recommendations by nearly 20 decibels.33,34
Early medical interventions impact the auditory environ-
ment. Specifically, mechanical ventilation, high-frequency os-
cillatory ventilation and oxygen delivery via nasal cannula were
associated with increased noise exposure. Increased decibel

 exposure caused by high-frequency ventilation has been found
to increase the likelihood of progressive hearing loss in infants
who are already at risk for hearing impairments because of
oxygen deprivation.35,36 The effects of medical interventions on
sound levels and noise exposure were most prominent in the
early weeks of hospitalization. The ideal NICU environment
may consist of positive language and environmental sound as
well as protection from loud medical equipment, but more work
is needed to assess the effects of sound, including only sound
levels that are within the American Academy of Pediatrics
recommendations.
The limitations of the current study include the relatively
small sample size and a cohort of medically fragile prema-
ture infants. This study was an exploratory study and did not
employ a randomized design. Further, the analyses relied on
multiple comparisons of outcome, which increases the risk of
a type I error. However, we used a strict P value of .01 to iden-
tify predictive variables because of multiple analyses con-
ducted. Several limitations result from use of the LENA device
to characterize the sound environment. The LENA relies on
an algorithm of sound, which labels the most prevalent sound
at a given point in time, thus, making it impossible to distin-
guish multiple sounds happening concurrently. In addition,
the LENA cannot distinguish music from other electronic noise
(ie, alarms), which complicates the interpretation of elec-
tronic noise as an outcome measure. The device was also used
at 4 specific time points, which may not have been represen-
tative of the entire NICU stay. Because there was a sign at the
bedside indicating that recordings were taking place, this could
have impacted healthcare professional and parent behavior.
Findings from this study may not be generalized to the overall
NICU population, as the infants recruited for this study were
part of a cerebral monitoring study and represented a more
medically complex and fragile population. In addition, this study
was conducted in an urban NICU, with families who had high
rates of social challenges that may have limited their engage-
ment in the NICU. Findings may be different in settings in
which parents have the resources and education that sup-
ports their full involvement in care within the NICU, and this
is important when determining the implications of these find-
ings. Careful attention to a NICU’s size, culture, and paren-
tal involvement is important when putting research findings
into context. Despite these limitations, the study sets the stage
for further inquiries into the auditory environment of the
NICU.
The auditory environment is modifiable, and more re-
search is needed to identify the optimal sensory environ-
ment for preterm infants to support neurodevelopment. Further
research is needed to define the optimal sound environment,
especially in private room NICUs with the potential for com-
plete auditory abatement. As the optimal auditory environ-
ment is defined, it will be important to develop strategies to
help infants when families are unable to engage in care in the
NICU with their infants. Defining the optimal auditory ex-
posure may be beneficial for family engagement in the NICU.
Additional research is needed to identify possible modifica-
tions to medical equipment to decrease current NICU sound
levels and to assess the effect of such interventions. Although
early sound may be critical, there are also many influences on
outcomes, which can include inherent language ability, ma-
ternal education, and environmental influences post-NICU dis-
charge. Studying the complex contribution of prematurity,
medical illness, genetics, and auditory exposures during child-
hood will be important for future efforts to improve out-
comes in preterm infants. ■
