igarette smoking is a major, preventable cause of cardio-
vascular diseases, particularly of coronary artery disease.1 
Epidemiological studies have suggested that active smoking is 
associated with incident heart failure in general populations, 
even after accounting for potential confounders and coronary 
artery disease.2,3 Nevertheless, the mechanisms linking ciga-
rette smoking to cardiac dysfunction are not established.4

See Clinical Perspective
Analyses of the relationship between smoking and car-
diac structure and function in community-based cohorts have 
yielded conflicting results. Although active smoking was asso-
ciated with higher left ventricular (LV) mass5–7 in some popu-
lations, neutral8 or even inverse associations9 were described 
in others. In addition, the relationship between smoking and 
LV systolic and diastolic function remains controversial.10–14 
Moreover, it is uncertain whether tobacco-related effects on 
blood pressure15 and arterial stiffness7 and the coexistence 
of other risk factors for cardiovascular remodeling16 might 
account for the association between smoking and altered car-
diac structure and function independent of the development 
coronary artery disease.
We analyzed the cross-sectional association between 
smoking and echocardiographic features in a large, elderly 
sample free of overt coronary heart disease or heart failure 
who attended the fifth visit of the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis 
Risk in Communities).
Methods
Study Population
ARIC is an ongoing, prospective, observational study. Detailed study 
rationale, design, and procedures have been previously published.17 
Background—Cigarette smoking has been associated with higher risk of incident heart failure independent of coronary 
artery disease, but the impact of tobacco use on cardiac structure and function in the general population is uncertain. This 
study evaluated the relationship between smoking and echocardiographic measures in a large elderly cohort.
Methods and Results—We studied 4580 participants free of overt coronary artery disease, heart failure, and significant 
valvular disease from the fifth visit of the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) who underwent transthoracic 
echocardiography. Participants were classified into 3 categories based on self-reported smoking habits: never (43.2%), 
former (50.5%), and current smokers (6.3%). Pack-years and years of smoking were also estimated. Compared with 
never smokers, current smokers had greater left ventricular (LV) mass index (80.4±1.1 versus 76.7±0.4 g/m2; P<0.001), 
LV mass/volume ratio (1.93±0.03 versus 1.83±0.03 g/mL; P<0.001), higher prevalence of LV hypertrophy (15% versus 
9%; P=0.008), and worse diastolic function, as reflected by higher E/E′ ratio (11.7±0.2 versus 10.9±0.1; P<0.001), 
after adjusting for potential confounding factors. In contrast, former smokers showed similar echocardiographic features 
when compared with never smokers. Furthermore, estimated pack-years and years of smoking, measures of cumulative 
cigarette exposure, were associated with greater LV mass index, LV mass/volume ratio, and worse diastolic function 
(higher E/E′ ratio) in current smokers after multivariable analysis (all P<0.01).
Conclusions—Active smoking and cumulative cigarette exposure were associated with subtle alterations in LV structure 
and function in an elderly, community-based population free of overt coronary artery disease and heart failure.

The original cohort included 15 792 participants aged 45 to 64 years 
recruited between 1987 and 1989 (visit 1), selected from 4 communi-
ties in the United States: Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, 
Mississippi; suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Washington 
County, Maryland. Institutional review boards from each site ap-
proved the study, and informed consent was obtained from all par-
ticipants. In this study, we considered the 6538 surviving participants 
attending visit 5 (2011–2013). We excluded those with prevalent 
coronary artery disease, heart failure, or moderate or severe valvu-
lar disease (n=1187) and participants whose race was neither black 
nor white (n=14) or with missing echocardiographic examination 
(n=304) or smoking data (n=453), resulting in 4580 individuals eli-
gible for the present analysis.
Measurements
Smoking History
Smoking history was ascertained by means of an interviewer-admin-
istered questionnaire. At visit 5, participants were asked whether they 
currently smoked cigarettes or whether they had done so in the past. 
This approach yielded 3 categories: never smokers, former smokers, 
and current smokers. Cumulative pack-years and years of smoking 
were available up to visit 4 (1996–1998), whereas between visit 4 and 
visit 5, the participant smoking status (current smoker/non smoker) 
was ascertained by annual follow-up evaluations without assessment 
of intensity of smoking. As a result, the cumulative exposure to smok-
ing up to visit 5 was estimated by assuming that smoking intensity 
obtained at visit 4 persisted over the interval from visit 4 to visit 5 
among those who continued to smoke, allowing for the estimation 
of pack-years between visit 4 to visit 5 by multiplying the number of 
cigarettes/d at visit 4 by the number of years smoked between visits 
4 and 5.
Echocardiography Protocol
The echocardiographic imaging and analysis protocol has been pre-
viously described in detail.18 All studies were acquired at visit 5 on 
Philips IE33 machines (Philips, Andover, MA) by trained sonogra-
phers. Analyses were performed by expert technicians and overread 
by echocardiographers in a central echo core laboratory. LV mass was 
indexed to body surface area, and LV hypertrophy was defined as LV 
mass index >115 g/m2 in men or >95 g/m2 in women. Normal LV 
mass index or LV hypertrophy coupled with relative wall thickness 
≥0.42 was defined as concentric remodeling or concentric hypertro-
phy, respectively, whereas normal LV mass index or LV hypertrophy 
coupled with relative wall thickness <0.42 was considered normal 
ventricular structure or eccentric hypertrophy, respectively.19 Left 
atrial volume was indexed to body surface area. Peak lateral and 
septal mitral annular relaxation (E′) velocities were assessed using 
tissue Doppler imaging. Right ventricular function was assessed us-
ing the tricuspid annular peak systolic velocity, and right ventricular 
fractional area change was calculated as the percent change in cavity 
area. Global longitudinal strain was derived from speckle-tracking 
echocardiography.
Measurement of Other Baseline Covariates
Information on demographics, clinical history, anthropomorphic mea-
sures, and blood pressure was obtained at the time of echocardiogra-
phy. Definitions for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, current alcohol 
consumption, coronary artery disease, and heart failure were used 
as previously described in the ARIC study.20 Low-density and high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were measured in a centralized 
laboratory. Carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity was measured using 
a ColinVP-1000 plus system (Omron Co, Komaki, Japan).21
Statistical Methods
Descriptive data are presented as the mean±SD for normally distrib-
uted variables and median (25th–75th percentile) for non-normally 
distributed variables. Categorical variables are expressed as propor-
tions. Significant pairwise comparisons are shown only for variables 
in which a significant global difference was detected using 1-way 
ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis tests. The χ2 test was used to compare cat-
egorical variables. Echocardiographic data are presented as multivari-
able adjusted means with P values estimated from linear or logistic 
regression across smoking categories. Multivariate model covariates 
were selected based on a priori knowledge. Two regression models 
were constructed: model 1 included age, sex, and race; model 2 addi-
tionally adjusted for diabetes mellitus, antihypertensive medications, 
body mass index, systolic blood pressure, current alcohol consump-
tion, heart rate, and carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity. Linear 
regression analysis between echocardiographic parameters and pack-
years of smoking or years of smoking was performed adjusting for 
model 2 covariates and included never (0 pack-years) and current 
smokers. To further quantify the impact of possible bias because of 
selective attrition before visit 5 because of nonattendance among liv-
ing cohort participants, we calculated inverse probability weights22,23 
to estimate the likelihood of visit 5 participation among cohort par-
ticipants known to be alive on December 31, 2011. Nonattendance 
to visit 5 was modeled using the following variables assessed at visit 
1: age, sex, race, field center, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, 
hypertension, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, estimated glomeru-
lar filtration rate, and smoking status. The inverse of these resulting 
estimated probabilities were used as weights so that, in order to better 
represent the full ARIC population, visit 5 attendees with characteris-
tics more similar to those who did not attend were given more weight 
in subsequent analyses of associations with echocardiographic analy-
ses. Tests for interaction were performed using the likelihood ratio 
test for the cross-product interaction term between sex, race, and 
measures of cardiac structure and function. Two-sided P values <0.05 
were considered significant. Analyses were performed using Stata 
version 13.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX).
Results
Among the 4580 ARIC visit 5 participants included in this 
analysis, 287 (6.3%) were current smokers, 2316 (50.5%) 
were former smokers and 1977 (43.2%) never smoked. 
Table 1 illustrates the characteristics of the study population 
according to smoking status. Never smokers were more likely 
to be women, were less frequently alcohol drinkers, and had 
higher, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
levels compared with the other smoking groups. Current 
smokers were younger, had lower average body mass index, 
and had higher estimated glomerular filtration rate than the 
other smoking groups. Moreover, they were more likely to be 
black, women, and had higher pack-years and years of smok-
ing compared with former smokers.
Tables 2 and 3 present the associations between smoking 
status and measures of cardiac structure and function. When 
compared with never and former smokers, current smokers 
had greater LV mass index, LV mass/volume ratio, and higher 
prevalence of LV hypertrophy and concentric LV hypertrophy 
after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, diabetes 
mellitus, antihypertensive medications, systolic blood pres-
sure, current alcohol consumption, heart rate, and carotid–
femoral pulse wave velocity (Table 2). Current smokers also 
had worse LV diastolic function, as evidenced by higher E/E′ 
ratio (Table 3). We observed a marginally higher LV ejection 
fraction in current smokers, but the difference in this variable 
between current and never smokers became nonsignificant 
(P=0.07) after additional adjustment for LV mass/volume ratio 
(Table 3). Furthermore, global longitudinal LV strain, which 
has been reported as a more sensitive measure of systolic 
function,24 did not differ among the smoking groups. Lastly, 
no significant association between right ventricular structural 
and functional features and smoking status was detected.

Estimated pack-years and years of smoking, which are 
measures of cumulative cigarette exposure, were associated 
with greater LV mass index, LV mass/volume ratio, and worse 
diastolic function (higher E/E′ ratio) in multivariable analysis 
(Figure).
To account for possible bias because of selective attrition 
before visit 5 because of nonattendance among living cohort 
participants, we included estimated inverse probability of 
attendance as weights in the multivariable models (Tables I 
and II in the Data Supplement). This approach did not change 
the associations between smoking variables and echocardio-
graphic parameters, except for the differences in the preva-
lence of LV concentric hypertrophy between current and never 
smokers, which became nonsignificant after applying calcu-
lated inverse probability weights. We did not find any signifi-
cant interaction by sex and race for the relationship between 
smoking and cardiac structural and functional features. Lastly, 
further adjustment for spirometric markers of lung function 
obtained at visit 5 (forced vital capacity or forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second) and markers of socioeconomic status 
(income and education level) did not exert substantial changes 
in the association between smoking and echocardiographic 
parameters.
Discussion
In a large sample of elderly individuals free of overt coro-
nary artery disease and heart failure, current smokers had 
higher LV mass and LV mass/volume ratio, higher prevalence 
of LV hypertrophy, and worse diastolic function, as reflected 
by higher E/E′ ratio, compared with never smokers and for-
mer smokers. Furthermore, pack-years and years of smoking 
were associated with greater LV mass index, LV mass/volume 
ratio, and worse diastolic function among current and never 
smokers in multivariable analysis. These findings suggest that 
active smoking and cumulative cigarette exposure were asso-
ciated with alterations in LV structure and function.
Elevated LV mass and LV hypertrophy are acknowl-
edged risk factors for heart failure.25 In the present study, 
LV mass and prevalence of LV hypertrophy were higher in 
current smokers compared with never and former smokers. 
Although previous studies have reported conflicting results,8,9 
our findings are in agreement with data from other large gen-
eral populations,5–7 which showed greater LV mass in active 
smokers. The average difference in LV mass between cur-
rent smokers and nonsmokers in our adjusted analysis was 
≈7 g, similar in magnitude to data from the Cardiovascular 
Health Study,5 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis,6 and 
The Study of Health in Pomerania.7 Furthermore, we found 
that current smokers had a higher LV mass/volume ratio and a 
trend toward higher prevalence of LV concentric hypertrophy 
in comparison with the other smoking groups, suggesting that 
active smoking may also favor the development of LV concen-
tricity, a feature that has been related to worse cardiovascular 
prognosis independent of LV mass.26 Whether these relatively 
modest differences in LV geometry and mass can be related to 
future outcomes remains to be established.
Previous studies showed contradictory results about the 
relationship between smoking and LV diastolic function in 
general populations.12–14 In addition, significant associations 
between smoking and impaired LV diastolic function have 
been reported only in women.13,14 In the present report, we 
found that E/E′ ratio, a marker of LV filling pressure, was

elevated in current smokers, and this association was not influ-
enced by sex. Our larger sample size probably increased the 
ability to detect significant associations in the whole sample, 
which could account for the differences between our findings 
and those of previous reports.12–14 Overall, these results sug-
gest that active smoking was associated with impaired LV dia-
stolic function, which might help explain the higher risk of 
incident heart failure reported for smokers in epidemiological 
studies.2,3
Smoking is known to increase the risk of cardiovascu-
lar atherosclerotic diseases in a dose-dependent fashion.27 
However, the impact of intensity and duration of cigarette 
smoking on cardiac structure and function has been uncertain. 
We found that cumulative cigarette exposure was associated 
with higher LV mass and worse diastolic function in active 
smokers. In addition, we observed similar echocardiographic 
features between former and never smokers, suggesting that 
the potential effects of tobacco on the myocardium might be 
reversible after smoking cessation. Nevertheless, it is possible 
that residual myocardial alterations may persist after smoking 
cessation, because subtle reductions in LV function11 and a 
modestly higher risk of heart failure3 among former smokers 
have been reported by others.
In our population, smoking was not associated with 
global longitudinal LV strain, which has been reported 
as a more sensitive measure of systolic function,24 thus 
suggesting that smoking was not related to significant varia-
tions in LV systolic function. We also observed that LV ejec-
tion fraction, a less informative measure of systolic function 
when compared with global longitudinal strain,24,28 was mar-
ginally higher in current smokers than in the other smoking 
groups. However, LV ejection fraction may be influenced by 
cardiac geometry29 and is known to increase in parallel with 
LV mass/volume ratio.30 In accordance with this notion, we 
found that the difference in LV ejection fraction between 
current and never smokers became no longer apparent after 
adjusting for LV mass/volume ratio in multivariable analy-
sis, suggesting that the higher LV ejection fraction seen in 
current smokers could be more a consequence of variation 
in LV geometry rather than resulting from enhanced LV sys-
tolic function.
A variety of mechanisms might explain the associa-
tion between smoking and LV remodeling and dysfunction. 
Smoking-associated cardiac alterations could be a result of 
tobacco-induced increases in blood pressure levels15 or a 
consequence of coexisting risk factors, such as alcohol con-
sumption.16 However, we found no differences in brachial 
blood pressure levels among the smoking groups, and the 
association between smoking and echocardiographic param-
eters was independent of blood pressure levels and active 
alcohol consumption. Previous studies have also hypoth-
esized that the adverse effects of tobacco on the myocardium

could be driven by smoking-induced increases in arterial 
stiffness.7 In contrast to this hypothesis, we provided novel 
evidence that the association between smoking and higher 
LV mass and worse LV function was independent of carotid–
femoral pulse wave velocity, an acknowledged marker of 
arterial stiffness. Lastly, it is possible that the changes in 
cardiac parameters were a result of direct effects of tobacco 
on the myocardium. This hypothesis is supported by experi-
mental evidence showing that cigarette smoke may stimulate 
myocardial hypertrophy and dysfunction, by inducing neu-
rohumoral changes, oxidative stress, and activation of matrix 
metalloproteinases and mitogen-activated protein kinases.4 
Nevertheless, additional studies are necessary to discern 
the exact mechanisms by which smoking influences cardiac 
structure and function.
Some limitations of this study should be highlighted. 
Cigarette smoking information was obtained through inter-
viewer-administered questionnaires, and no validation with 
biochemical analyses was attempted. Thus, participants may 
have under-reported their smoking habits, although this would 
likely have biased our results toward the null. In addition, we 
estimated the number of pack-years smoked between visits 4

and 5 by assuming that smoking intensity obtained at visit 4 
persisted during the interval from visit 4 to visit 5, which might 
limit the accuracy of total pack-years used in our analyses. 
However, years of smoking, an alternative measure of smok-
ing burden,31 was calculated up to visit 5 and showed similar 
associations with echocardiographic parameters when com-
pared with total pack-years, suggesting that total pack-years 
used in our analysis may have provided a good estimation of 
cumulative cigarette exposure. As in any observational cross-
sectional study, residual confounding cannot be excluded, and 
the associations observed between smoking and variation in 
cardiac structure and function cannot be assumed to be causal. 
In our analysis, we did not account for multiple testing, because 
such typical corrections for multiplicity (ie, Bonferroni) can be 
overly conservative in the presence of correlated outcomes, and 
it is known that in general, echocardiography parameters are not 
independent of each other. However, all associations between 
smoking status and echocardiographic parameters (except for 
the adjusted differences on LV hypertrophy prevalence between 
current and former smokers) would remain significant consid-
ering a Bonferroni level of significance of P<0.05/6 (=0.0083), 
accounting for 6 echocardiography measures. It is possible that 
survival bias and selection bias may have influenced our esti-
mates. Given that current smokers have a higher rate of death, 
incident heart failure, and cardiovascular events compared with 
never and former smokers,32 our analysis possibly included only 
the smokers who were relatively healthier and therefore did not 
include a substantial number of smokers who had more expres-
sive cardiac remodeling and dysfunction but died before the 
analysis. This raises the assumption that similar or even greater 
associations between smoking and adverse cardiac characteris-
tics would have been observed among subjects who did not sur-
vive. Conversely, it should be acknowledged that our sample of 
current smokers, which only included elderly individuals with-
out coronary disease or heart failure, may represent a biologi-
cally unique group of individuals, not necessarily reflecting the 
full spectrum of the smoking population. Furthermore, selec-
tive attrition before visit 5 may have introduced biased esti-
mates in our analysis. However, our sensitivity analysis using 
inverse probability attrition weighting to account for nonatten-
dance among living cohort participants demonstrated consistent 
results when compared with the primary analysis.
In summary, we found that active smoking and cumula-
tive cigarette exposure were associated with higher LV mass, 
LV mass/volume ratio, and worse diastolic function in an 
elderly, community-based population free of overt coronary 
artery disease and heart failure. These findings suggest that 
active smoking is associated with subtle alterations in LV 
structure and function, which might help explain the higher 
risk of heart failure reported for smokers independent of cor-
onary artery disease.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Cigarette smoking has been associated with higher risk of incident heart failure independent of coronary artery disease, but 
the impact of tobacco use on cardiac structure and function in the general population is uncertain. We studied 4580 elderly 
subjects free of overt coronary artery disease and heart failure and found that current smokers had greater left ventricular 
(LV) mass index, LV mass/volume ratio, higher prevalence of LV hypertrophy, and worse diastolic function as compared 
with never and former smokers. Furthermore, estimated pack-years and years of smoking, measures of cumulative cigarette 
exposure, were associated with greater LV mass and worse diastolic function in current smokers. These findings suggest that 
active smoking is associated with alterations in LV structure and function, which might help explain the higher risk of heart 
failure reported for smokers independent of coronary artery disease.
