Abstract: Athletes use nutritional supplementation to enhance the effects of training and achieve
improvements in their athletic performance. Beetroot juice increases levels of nitric oxide (NO), which
serves multiple functions related to increased blood flow, gas exchange, mitochondrial biogenesis
and efficiency, and strengthening of muscle contraction. These biomarker improvements indicate that
supplementation with beetroot juice could have ergogenic effects on cardiorespiratory endurance
that would benefit athletic performance. The aim of this literature review was to determine the effects
of beetroot juice supplementation and the combination of beetroot juice with other supplements
on cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes. A keyword search of DialNet, MedLine, PubMed,
Scopus and Web of Science databases covered publications from 2010 to 2016. After excluding
reviews/meta-analyses, animal studies, inaccessible full-text, and studies that did not supplement
with beetroot juice and adequately assess cardiorespiratory endurance, 23 articles were selected
for analysis. The available results suggest that supplementation with beetroot juice can improve
cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes by increasing efficiency, which improves performance at
various distances, increases time to exhaustion at submaximal intensities, and may improve the
cardiorespiratory performance at anaerobic threshold intensities and maximum oxygen uptake
(VO2max). Although the literature shows contradictory data, the findings of other studies lead us to
hypothesize that supplementing with beetroot juice could mitigate the ergolytic effects of hypoxia on
cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes. It cannot be stated that the combination of beetroot juice
with other supplements has a positive or negative effect on cardiorespiratory endurance, but it is
possible that the effects of supplementation with beetroot juice can be undermined by interaction
with other supplements such as caffeine.

1. Introduction
Cardiorespiratory endurance is defined as a health-related component of physical fitness that
relates to the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply fuel during sustained physical
activity and to eliminate fatigue products after supplying fuel [1]. Cardiorespiratory endurance is a
performance factor in all sports in which adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is resynthesized, mainly by
aerobic metabolism or oxidative processes that produce energy. In these sports, the expended effort
typically lasts longer than five minutes, primarily depending on the metabolic level of the oxidative

processes involved [2]. Factors that limit performance in this type of endurance patterns include
maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), ventilatory thresholds (first and second ventilatory threshold)
and energy efficiency or economy [3–5].
In competitive sports, 0.5%–1.5% improvements in performance are considered a critical
difference [6]. In order to enhance the effects of training and improve performance, athletes often
turn to nutritional supplements [7]. According to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM),
adequate selection of nutrients and supplements, adjusting intake according to the exercise performed,
is necessary for optimal performance in athletes [8]. However, not all supplements have been shown to
produce a positive effect on performance. The Australian Institute of Sport [9], classified supplements
to which athletes have access, with the goal of categorizing nutritional supplements based on the
level of evidence for impact on an athlete's performance (Table 1). However, the effectiveness of
supplements also depends on dosage and type of effort, because the potential ergogenic effect may
differ by the specific type of sport [10].

Beetroot juice is used as a supplement because of its high inorganic nitrate (NO3−) content, a
compound found naturally in vegetables and in processed meats, where it is used as a preservative [12].
Once ingested, the NO3− is reduced to nitrite (NO2−), by anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity
by the action of nitrate reductase enzymes [13] and then to nitric oxide (NO) in the stomach [14].
This physiological mechanism depends on the entero-salivary circulation of inorganic nitrate without
involving NOS activity. Once in the acidic stomach, nitrite is instantly decomposed to convert to NO
and other nitrogen oxides performing determinant physiological functions (Figure 1). Nitrate and
remaining nitrite is absorbed from the intestine into the circulation, which can become bioactive NO in
tissues and blood [14] under physiological hypoxia.
NO induces several physiological mechanisms that influences O2 utilization during contraction
skeletal muscle. Physiological mechanisms for NO2− reduction are facilitated by hypoxic conditions,
therefore, NO (vasodilator) is produced in those parts of muscle that are consuming or in need of
more O2. This mechanism would allow local blood flow to adapt to O2 requirement providing within
skeletal muscle an adequate homogeneous distribution. This physiological response could be positive
in terms of muscle function, although it would not explain a reduced O2 cost during exercise [15].
Another probable mechanism is related to NO2− and NO as regulators of cellular O2 utilization [15].

In addition, a potent signaling molecule that affects cell function in many body tissues, NO is 
endogenously produced by synthesizing nitric oxide from L‐arginine oxidation. The molecule has 
important hemodynamic and metabolic functions [16,17], being a major vasodilator that can increase 
blood flow to muscles [18] and promote oxygen transfer in the muscle. Additional physiological 
benefits of NO include improved mitochondrial efficiency and glucose uptake in muscle [19] and 
enhanced muscle contraction and relaxation processes [20]. Other researchers have reported that NO 
can act as an immunomodulator [21] and stimulates gene expression and mitochondrial biogenesis 
[22]. Given the positive effects of beetroot juice, which are induced by means of NO, this supplement 
has been proposed as part of the therapeutic approach in people with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease [23], hypertension [24], heart failure [25] and insulin resistance [26].

in aerobic metabolism [27]. Therefore, supplementation with beetroot juice may have an ergogenic
effect in athletes [9], especially with respect to cardiorespiratory endurance. However, the assumption

hypoxic conditions, and the combination of beetroot juice supplementation with other supplements,
as caffeine, has a positive effect on cardiorespiratory endurance is controversial.
The objective of the present literature review was to analyze the effects of beetroot juice
supplementation on cardiorespiratory endurance in several conditions (normoxia, hypoxia and
beetroot juice with other supplements) and determine the appropriate dosage to enhance the potential
ergogenic effects on performance. The focus of the article is mainly on the influence of beetroot juice of
the acute and chronic responses on trained endurance athletes.
2. Methodology
A keyword search for articles published in English or Spanish since 2010 was carried out in the
DialNet, MedLine, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases on 8 June 2016. The search terms
included beet, beetroot, nitrate, nitrite, supplement, supplementation, nutrition, “sport nutrition” and
“ergogenic aids”. The 210 selected articles included at least one of those search terms, in combination
with endurance, exercise, sport or athlete.
Exclusion criteria were the following: literature reviews and meta-analyses, animal studies,
population other than endurance athletes, and inadequate assessment of cardiorespiratory endurance,
specifically defined as <VO2max testing or no test lasting more than 5 min to determine how long the
subject can maintain the lowest intensity at which VO2max was achieved [28]. Therefore, 23 articles
were selected for the present review (Figure 2).

In Table 2, 23 articles were examined regarding beetroot juice supplementation in normoxic
conditions, hypoxic conditions and beetroot juice combined with caffeine supplementation: 11 of
those articles were related to trained athletes, four of them to cyclists-triathletes, three to cyclists
trained, two to trained kayakers, one to trained runners, one to trained swimmers, and one to healthy
physically active people. Twenty-one of these articles assessed respiratory parameters including VO2
at several intensities (approximately 60%–100% VO2max, VT1)
Briefly, in trained athletes men and women in normoxia conditions appeared that beetroot juice
supplementation enhances aerobic performance by a decrease in VO2 at several intensities (60%–100%
VO2max, VT1) increasing the economy during exercise. In kayak studies, a decrease of VO2 at the
same intensity in kayakers supplemented with beetroot juice compared to a placebo group was found.
In trained swimmers, a decrease in energy expenditure in the experimental condition of beetroot juice
supplementation was observed.
Regarding the supplementation with beetroot juice in hypoxic conditions, five studies were
selected. The hypothesis that beetroot improves cardiorespiratory performance in hypoxic conditions
is controversial.
Two studies evaluated the effect of the combination of beetroot juice and caffeine in men and
women trained cyclists-triathletes, and one study evaluated the same supplementation in trained
men athletes. The studies did not determine that the effects of beetroot juice combined with caffeine
increase the cardiorespiratory performance regarding caffeine supplementation.
3.1. Acute Effects of Beetroot Juice Supplementation on Performance in Cardiorespiratory Endurance
Several studies have shown a positive effect of acute beetroot juice intake on various parameters
of performance improvement associated with the cardiovascular and respiratory system. Economy is
a parameter that expresses the relationship between oxygen consumption (VO2) and power generated
or the distance traveled by an athlete [29], regarded as a performance factor in cardiorespiratory
endurance [3–5]. Improved economy is due to achieving higher output power with the same VO2
level [30]. Another improvement attributed to beetroot juice supplementation is related to the increased
blood flow, favoring the supply of oxygen to the mitochondria [50], which has the side effect of
stimulating oxidative metabolism. In addition, supplementation with NO3− could improve the
processes of muscle contraction and relaxation [31].
A study in trained cyclists found that beetroot juice supplementation improves performance by
0.8% in a 50-mile test [32]. Significant increases in efficiency, measured as watts (W) per liter of VO2
(W/VO2) were observed in the last 10 miles; these improvements were associated with a decrease
in time required to travel this distance. Another study [33] aimed to assess efficiency on a 40-min
test at submaximal intensity (20 min at 50% VO2max followed by 20 min at 70% VO2max). A decrease
in VO2 and improved efficiency was also observed after beetroot juice supplementation, but did not
reach statistical significance. After supplementation and immediately after the submaximal 40-min
test, the time-to-exhaustion at an intensity of 90% VO2max improved as much as 16% in the trained
cyclists. These findings make us suspect that beetroot juice might have an ergogenic effect, increasing
performance in prolonged cycling events that require alternations in relative intensity, from moderate
to high VO2max, which is very characteristic of the stages of cycling races.
In a time trial of 16.1 km, supplementation with beetroot juice improved the performance of
trained cyclists diminishing a completion time in a 2.7% and by 2.8% in a 4-km time trial [27]. Although,
the protocol test used in this study had a high ecological validity, providing an accurate simulation
of the physiological responses during competition, it is unclear that beetroot supplementation can
increase the performance by this magnitude in elite cyclist [27].
This increased performance was also associated with W/VO2 improvements of 7% in a time trial
of 16.1 km and 11% in 4-km time trial [27]. The observed improvements in efficiency match those
found in high-performance kayakers when paddling at 60% relative VO2max intensity or in a 4-min
test [34].
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 43
10 of 18
Response to a submaximal VO2 test at constant load is very important to cardiorespiratory
endurance in athletic performance. In this type of test, VO2 increases disproportionately during the
first 3 min because of an increase at the respiratory center to meet the exercise-induced increase in
energy demand [51]. At an intensity below VT1 60% VO2max efforts, approximately stabilization of
VO2 is observed from the 3-min point until the end of the effort [52]. Nonetheless, at intensities greater
than VT1 a progressively greater recruitment of type II motor units occurs [53], which have a lower
oxidative potential than type I [54], and therefore a progressive increase in VO2 is observed from the
third minute until the end of the exercise. This has been called the slow component of VO2 [55], which
has been identified as one of the main factors limiting performance in endurance exercise of moderate
and/or high intensity [4], because the increase in the slow component of VO2 attains values of VO2max
at submaximal intensity, causing fatigue [56].
In experienced athletes, the effect of supplementation with beetroot juice (8.2 mmol nitrate) on
time-to-exhaustion was tested at intensities of 60%, 70%, 80% and 100% peak power [35]. Athletes
were able to maintain an intensity of 60% (Beetroot: 696 ± 120 vs. Placebo: 593 ± 68 s), 70% (Beetroot:
452 ± 106 vs. Placebo: 390 ± 86 s) and 80% (Beetroot: 294 ± 50 vs. Placebo: 263 ± 50 s) peak power
significantly longer during exercise with supplementation, and there was a trend toward increased
endurance at 100% peak power. The study results might reflect a lower VO2 response at submaximal
intensities, which would reduce the increase in the slow component, delaying the time when the
athletes reached VO2max and therefore became fatigued. This would allow a longer sustained effort.
On the other hand, trained runners participating in a 5000-m test showed no significant overall
improvement with beetroot juice supplementation, although they ran 5% faster in the later part of
the race, particularly the last 1.1 miles [12]. The lack of significance could be related to the timing of
the supplementation. Participants took the supplement 90 min before exercise; in the other studies
cited, beetroot juice was provided 150–180 min before the effort [27,32–35] and ergogenic effects of
supplementation with beetroot juice were observed at 150 min after ingestion [35].
3.2. Effects of Chronic Supplementation with Beetroot Juice on Cardiorespiratory Endurance
In addition to increasing blood flow and improving muscle contraction and relaxation, beetroot
juice supplementation may improve the efficiency of mitochondrial respiration [50] and oxidative
phosphorylation [57]. It seems, however, that acute supplementation is insufficient to produce
mitochondrial biogenesis, suggesting that these adaptations may require longer supplementation
protocols. In trained athletes, acute supplementation with beetroot juice for five days reduces VO2 as
much as 3% at an intensity of 70% VO2max. The test was performed at 50% VO2max for 10 min, followed
by 10 min at 70% VO2max [31]. Another study in trained cyclists confirmed that supplementation for
a period of six days reduces VO2 in a 60-min test. The protocol consisted of 30 min at 45% VO2max
followed by another 30 min at 65% VO2max. In addition, riders were able to improve their 10-km time
trial performance immediately following the submaximal test [30].
These studies clarify the benefits that could result from supplementation with beetroot juice in
longer intake protocols of about six days, as was the case in the time-to-exhaustion test at submaximal
intensities following acute supplementation [33,35]. Time-to-exhaustion improved at intensities of 70%
of VO2max, between VT1 and VO2max [37]. In trained swimmers, Pinna et al. [38] also corroborated
the progressive ergogenic benefits of beetroot juice during an incremental test. At anaerobic threshold
intensity, workload increased and aerobic energy expenditure decreased.
In another study, in healthy subjects physically active but not highly trained in any particular
sport, Vanhatalo et al. [36] evaluated the acute and chronic (15-day) effects of dietary supplementation
with NO3− on VO2 in a constant load test at an intensity of 90% of the gas exchange threshold (GET),
similar to the anaerobic threshold, and in a progressive incremental ergometric cycle test, compared
to controls. The peak power in the incremental test and the ratio of work rate to GET intensity were
increased in the group that received the dietary NO3− supplementation. The findings indicated that
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 43
11 of 18
dietary supplementation reduces NO3− oxygen consumption at submaximal exercise, and these effects
can last for 15 days if supplementation is maintained.
Potential improvements observed in the anaerobic or lactate threshold intensity is especially
important for athletes in various forms of endurance sports, because the level achieved in this
parameter does not depend on motivation as it occurs when VO2max is determined [58]. This threshold
is considered a factor that better discriminates between cardiorespiratory endurance capacities than
does VO2max [2,58]. One of the physiological parameters that conditions improvement in the anaerobic
threshold is increased mitochondrial population [59]. If the beetroot juice supplementation can promote
mitochondrial biogenesis, we might assume that chronic supplementation with beetroot juice would
decrease oxygen consumption at anaerobic threshold intensity as an adaptation to exercise.
It has also been suggested that additional beetroot juice supplementation may improve the
muscle contraction functions. A study by Whitfield et al. [31] found that VO2 reduction after a
constant load test at 70% VO2max occurred without any changes in markers of mitochondrial efficiency
such as adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) and uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3). Similarly, other
researchers have suggested that supplementation may positively affect the interaction of actin and
myosin bridges [60] by modulating the release of calcium that occurs after the action potential [61].
The effects described by these authors indicate that supplementation with beetroot juice, whether acute
or chronic, could improve performance in sports that are characterized either by a predominantly
aerobic or anaerobic metabolism [38]. This could explain the positive effects on effort with a high
prevalence of anaerobic metabolism observed in a 500-m kayak test [29] or in the contractile force
developed by mice [62].
3.3. Effects of Beetroot Juice Supplementation on Performance in Cardiorespiratory Endurance under
Hypoxic Conditions
Many competitions, such as the mountain stages in cycling, are held at high altitudes [39], where
cardiorespiratory endurance is decreased relative to sea level [63]. Among the factors that could be
responsible for this decrease, we would highlight decreased supply of oxygen to muscles, due to a
partial reduction in oxygen pressure.
It is known that NO has an important role in the adaptation processes under hypoxic conditions;
higher levels of NO2− have been observed in Tibetans [18]. In a study of acute response to hypoxia,
people who live at sea level who climb to high altitudes and show decreased NO levels have symptoms
of acute altitude sickness [64,65]. The vasodilatory effects of NO may favor oxygen delivery [66],
and supplementation with beetroot juice could be effective in reducing the ergolytic effects of hypoxia
on cardiorespiratory endurance [39].
A recent study evaluated the effects of supplementation with acute and chronic beetroot juice
on a 15-min test at an intensity of 50% VO2max and a 10-km test carried out at a simulated altitude of
2500 m [40]. The test could not verify any positive effect of acute or chronic supplementation on any of
the performance variables analyzed. In addition, studies have shown supplementation with beetroot
juice did not improve performance in runners with a high level of training in an incremental intensity
test or in a 10-km race [41] or in a 1500-m test or tests at various submaximal intensities (50%, 65% and
80% VO2max) [42]. The results in the latter study are also in line with those reported by McLeod [40];
in these two studies, beetroot juice was administered 90 and 120 min, respectively, before exercise.
This may be an insufficient time interval for athletes to reach peak NO2− levels in their bloodstream.
The results presented above conflict with other reports [39,43]. Kelly et al. [43] tested the effect of
beetroot juice supplementation for three days on performance in a 5-min test at 80% VT1, followed by
a test to the point of exhaustion at an intensity at 75% of VT1 and VO2max and a simulated altitude of
2500 m. The results show that supplementation with beetroot juice reduced VO2 to 80% VT1 and there
was a statistical trend to improvement in higher intensity exercise (p = 0.07). Improved efficiency was
accompanied by a longer time-to-exhaustion in a test at 75% between VT1 and VO2max. In another
study that simulated an altitude of 2500 m, supplementation with beetroot juice again reduced the
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 43
12 of 18
VO2 during a 15-min test at 60% of VO2max and increased the speed achieved in a 16.1-km time
trial involving trained cyclists [39]. The results observed in the time trial were consistent with the
improvements (2.8%) reported from a 4-km time trial after a protocol of acute supplementation with
beetroot juice [27].
Masschelein et al. [44] found that six days of supplementation with beetroot juice can reduce
VO2 at rest by 8%, and by 4% at 45% VO2max intensity at a simulated altitude of 5000 m. Although
the cited study is not directly generalizable to performance in various types of cardiorespiratory
endurance, as competitions are unlikely to take place above an altitude of 2500 m, other parameters
such as arterial oxygen saturation (SPO2) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) in muscle tissue were analyzed.
The results showed that reductions in VO2 were accompanied by greater SPO2 and lower HHb after
supplementation with beetroot juice, indicating decreased oxygen extraction by the muscle, which
coincides with increased mechanical pedaling efficiency and lower levels of lactate in the blood.
Although the literature shows contradictory data, it is possible that supplementation with beetroot
juice may effectively improve performance when hypoxia is present, because oxygenation would
improve at the muscular level, reducing the ergolytic effects of hypoxia on aerobic performance.
3.4. Effects of the Combination of Beetroot Juice Supplementation with Other Supplements on
Cardiorespiratory Endurance
Caffeine supplementation has become increasingly common among athletes [67]. Among its
positive effects is increased stimulation of the central nervous system due to the antagonism of
adenosine [68], increased catecholamines and contractility of skeletal muscle [69] that improves
calcium output from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the action potential [70], and a
decrease in the subjective perception of pain and the regulation of thermoregulation [71]. Thus,
caffeine supplementation has proven ergogenic effects on various modalities of cardiorespiratory
endurance [72] and team sports [73,74]. A plateau effect occurs in performance improvement, at doses
ranging from 3 to 6 mg/kg of caffeine [75]. To test whether the combined supplementation of beetroot
juice (8 mmol of NO3−) and caffeine (5 mg/kg) had a greater effect than each supplement separately,
researchers tested the corresponding study groups of cyclists tested for 30 min at 60% VO2max, followed
by a test to exhaustion at 80% VO2max [45]. Although the combined supplementation improved time to
exhaustion VO2max 80% by 46% compared to placebo, the improvement was insignificant. Furthermore,
the additive effect of taking both supplements did not improve performance to a greater extent than
separate supplementation with each one [46,47].
In a study that simulated the characteristics of an Olympic cycling time trial, the effect of
supplementation in both men and women cyclists was tested using beetroot juice (8.2 mmol of
NO3−) and caffeine (3 mg/kg) and the combination of both [47]. The only proven effects were that
caffeine supplementation in combination with beetroot juice was effective in improving mean power
and time trial results.
In a later study of trained cyclists and triathletes, performance was improved only in the athletes
who received a caffeine supplement (3 mg/kg) [46]. No differences were observed in VO2. However,
lactate concentration in the blood was increased when athletes received caffeine supplementation.
Performance improvement was likely due to an increased anaerobic metabolism after caffeine intake;
therefore, it is possible that the effects of supplementation with beetroot juice can be undermined
by interaction with other supplements such as caffeine, which interferes with the effects of each
supplement taken separately.
3.5. Dosage
Peak NO2− concentration in blood is obtained within 2–3 h of NO3− supplementation [76] and the
ergogenic effects of supplementation with beetroot juice can be observed at 150 min after ingestion [36].
Oral antiseptic rinses should not be taken with beetroot juice supplementation, as these can prevent
the desired increase in NO2− levels after NO3− ingestion [77]. Although the majority of studies show
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 43
13 of 18
ergogenic effects of beetroot juice at a supplementation dose of 6–8 mmol NO3− (Table 2), it is possible
that high performance athletes might require a slightly higher dose. For example, in high performance
kayakers, the ergogenic effect of supplementation with beetroot juice was 1.7% in a 500-m test after
ingestion of 9.6 mmol of NO3− but a 4.8 mmol dose did not significantly improve results in a 1000-m
test [29].
Practical Considerations
It appears that acute supplementation with beetroot juice increases the power output with the
same VO2 levels [30]. This is an interesting finding for athletes as there is evidence that the economy is
a key factor to improve cardiorespiratory performance increasing energy efficiency in endurance sports
modalities. In addition, time to exhaustion at several intensities (60%–100% VO2max, MAP or VT1) is
another usual performance parameter that is improved with acute beetroot supplementation [33,35].
However, not all studies show a positive effect to acute beetroot supplementation indicating that
the efficacy of acute nitrate supplementation will be attributed to several factors such as the age,
diet, physiological and training status, and other parameters as the intensity, duration, endurance
modality and environment conditions [78]. Although most of the studies determine a supplementation
dose of 6–8 mmol NO3−, it is unclear that this supplementation dose can be effective to improve
cardiorespiratory performance in sports modalities such as kayaking or rowing. The dose should
possibly be increased in sports modalities where muscular groups of upper limbs are implicated.
Endurance athletes should take the dose of NO3−, approximately 90 min before the competition
without oral antiseptic.
Acute supplementation with beetroot juice is not sufficient to induce
mitochondrial biogenesis, suggesting that mitochondrial adaptations could only occur after longer
supplementation protocols. In chronic supplementations with beetroot juice, it appears that the
benefits in cardiorespiratory performance might be produced in longer intake protocols of about
six days [33,35]. Time-to-exhaustion at several intensities (between 70% and 100% VO2max, VT1)
and the load at anaerobic threshold could be enhanced while aerobic energy expenditure could be
diminished. Longer-term beetroot supplementation (15 or more days) could be effective, although
it would be necessary other studies analyzing the mitochondrial biogenesis to corroborate whether
mitochondrial adaptations depend on endurance training and/or beetroot supplementation. To date,
this assumption is unknown.
The scientific literature shows discrepancies regarding the improvement of the cardiorespiratory
performance induced by the supplementation of beetroot juice under hypoxic conditions. NO3− could
mitigate the ergolytic effects of hypoxia on cardiorespiratory in endurance athletes [39].
We cannot assert that the combination of beetroot juice with other supplements has a positive or
negative effect on cardiorespiratory endurance. It is possible that the effects of supplementation with
beetroot juice can be undermined by interaction with other supplements such as caffeine. More work
is needed to confirm the results of these investigations.
4. Conclusions
•
Acute supplementation with beetroot juice may have an ergogenic effect on reducing VO2 at less
than or equal to VO2max intensity, while improving the relationship between watts required and
VO2 level, mechanisms that make it possible to enable increase time-to-exhaustion at less than or
equal to VO2max intensity.
•
In addition to improving efficiency and performance in various time trials or increasing
time-to-exhaustion at submaximal intensities, chronic supplementation with beetroot juice may
improve cardiorespiratory performance at the anaerobic threshold and VO2max intensities.
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 43

•
Apparently, the effects of supplementation with beetroot juice might not have a positive interaction
with caffeine supplementation, mitigating the effects of beetroot juice intake on cardiorespiratory
performance, however, more work is needed to confirm the results of these investigations because
the number of studies analyzing the effects of the combination of beetroot juice with other
supplements, such as caffeine, is limited.
•
Intake of beetroot juice should be initiated within 90 min before athletic effort, since the peak
value of NO3− occurs within 2–3 h after ingestion. At least 6–8 mmol of NO3− intake is required,
which can be increased in athletes with a high level of training.
