Abstract
Aim: To examine how the social determinants of health have been considered in
conceptualizations of multimorbidity in older adults in the literature and to identify
implications for nursing practice, research and healthcare planning and policy.
Background: The common conceptualization of multimorbidity is the presence of
multiple chronic conditions where one is not more central than others.
Design: The
integrative
review
methodology
of
Whittemore
and
Knafl
was
employed. The World Health Organization Social Determinants of Health framework
was used to determine how the social determinants of health have been considered
in conceptualizations of multimorbidity.
Data sources: A search of electronic databases (2000–2015) generated 22 relevant
articles, including quantitative and qualitative studies and grey literature reports.
Review methods: A systematic process was used to appraise the quality of the doc-
uments, conduct qualitative data analysis procedures of data extraction, coding and
theme development, and synthesize conclusions.
Results: Current conceptualizations of multimorbidity provide limited consideration
of the complex interplay of multimorbidity with the broader social determinants of
health. Gender, education, behaviours and the health system were the most com-
monly cited determinants. Ethnicity, socioeconomic status/social class and material
circumstances received little attention. Most of the dimensions of socioeconomic
political context were not discussed.
Conclusion: The predominant conceptualization of multimorbidity focuses on the
biomedical dimensions of multimorbidity. Consequently, nursing practice, research
and policy informed by this literature could inadvertently sustain the mismatch
between the needs of older adults with multimorbidity and the services they
receive. Future research to inform a new conceptualization is necessary.

INTRODUCTION
Nurses and other healthcare professionals, researchers and policy
makers internationally view multimorbidity (MM) in older adults
(aged ≥60 years) as a significant public health concern due to its
negative impact on function, quality of life, and healthcare use and
costs (Boyd & Fortin, 2010; Marengoni et al., 2011; World Health
Organization 2013). The predominant conceptualization of MM in
the literature is disease-focused: the presence of two or more
chronic conditions where one is not more central than others

 (Bayliss et al., 2014; Boyd & Fortin, 2010; Marengoni et al., 2011).
The majority—55–98%—of older adults globally are living with MM
(Marengoni et al., 2011). As such, the primary goal in research
related to MM has been to better understand how to approach the
clinical complexity associated with MM (Boyd & Fortin, 2010). Yet, it
is widely understood that health is determined not only by biological
factors but also by complex interactions between social, cultural and
economic factors, the physical environment and individual beha-
viours (Solar & Irwin, 2010). More than 75% of health is determined
by a combination of factors outside of the healthcare system (Kirby,
2002). These factors are often referred to as the “non-medical” or
social determinants of health (Kirby, 2002).
Nurses have a vital role in the healthcare system mediating the
differential outcomes of illness in the lives of older adults through
holistic and health promoting interventions (Solar & Irwin, 2010).
However, the current conceptualization of MM does not facilitate an
understanding of the interaction between the medical and non-medi-
cal (social) determinants of health on health disparities in older adults
living with MM. It is important for nurses to understand the current
conceptualization of MM as it influences how health care is orga-
nized, delivered and funded. A better understanding of the concep-
tualization of MM could also guide future nursing and healthcare
research. Thus, the purpose of this review is to examine how the
social determinants of health have been considered as dimensions of
MM in older adults in the literature.

Background
Historically, the presence of more than one chronic condition in an
individual had been characterized as ‘comorbidity’ (Almirall & Fortin,
2013). This term was introduced in 1970 to describe the state of
having one chronic disease that is the focus of clinical management
(referred to as an “index disease”) and the presence of a “distinct
additional clinical entity” (Almirall & Fortin, 2013; p. 4). However, the
focus on an index disease received increasing scrutiny as managing
each disease as a “distinct clinical entity” is likely not the most effec-
tive care required for the aggregate effects of interacting chronic
conditions (Almirall & Fortin, 2013; Boyd & Fortin, 2010). Thus, the
current conceptualization of MM, first appearing in the international
medical literature in 1990, was embraced (Le Reste et al., 2013; van
den Akker, Buntinx, & Knottnerus, 1996).
MM is typically defined in the literature as the coexistence of
“multiple” or “two or more” chronic conditions or diseases (Bayliss
et al., 2015; Boyd et al., 2009; Gill et al., 2014; Hochhalter, Song,
Rush, Sklar, & Stevens, 2010; Vassilaki et al., 2015; Warner et al.,
2011). Living with MM compared with having a single condition is
associated with numerous negative outcomes for older adults:
reduced life expectancy, avoidable hospitalizations; lower quality of
life; poorer mood; frailty; increased risk of development of cognitive
impairment; disability; functional decline; problems with medication
use; and treatment conflicts (Bayliss et al., 2015; Ekdahl et al., 2015;
Gilbert et al., 2013; Le Reste et al., 2013; Marengoni et al., 2011;
Martin et al., 2012; Melis, Marengoni, Angleman, & Fratiglioni, 2014;
Menotti et al., 2001; St John, Tyas, Menec, & Tate, 2014; Vassilaki
et al., 2015; Woo & Leung, 2014). These multiple and interacting
negative outcomes for older adults with MM challenge the healthcare
Why is this review needed?
• The predominant conceptualization of multimorbidity in
older adults in the literature is the presence of two or
more chronic conditions where one is not more central
than others.
• The social determinants of health account for 75% of
the factors that influence health. Health is determined
not only by biological factors but complex interactions
between social, cultural and economic factors, the physi-
cal environment and individual behaviours.
• The current conceptualization of multimorbidity does not
facilitate nurses’ understanding of the influence of the
social determinants of health. The conceptualization does
not fully address the complex characteristics and needs
of this population and is inadequate to guide nursing
practice, research and healthcare policy.
What are the key findings?
• Multimorbidity was typically framed as a medical prob-
lem requiring a healthcare system response, and less
attention was paid to the influence of the structural
determinants of health, such as ethnicity and the inter-
mediary determinants, including material circumstances.
• The influence of the socioeconomic and political context
on older adults with multimorbidity was an underex-
plored topic in the literature.
• The prevailing practice response in the literature to the
problem of multimorbidity was the introduction of new
healthcare interventions, such as nurse-led comprehensive
care coordination in primary care. Interventions in other sec-
tors, such as housing, were not considered in this literature.
How should the findings be used to influence
practice, research and policy?
• Nurses need to consider the social determinants of
health as factors influencing multimorbidity in older
adults and identify and intervene to address social
inequities.
• Research in multimorbidity should include researchers
from diverse disciplinary perspectives, including nursing,
medicine and critical social scientists, to better under-
stand and conceptualize the complexity of living with
multimorbidity for older adults.
• Social and public policy development should include con-
sideration of older adults living with multimorbidity.

 system to provide care while containing costs (Bayliss, Edwards, Stei-
ner, & Main, 2008; Boyd et al., 2009; Ekdahl et al., 2015; Gilbert

Scherer, & Sh€
afer, 2015; Wilson, Gauvin, & Lavis, 2013).

Conceptual framework
There is emerging evidence to suggest that the burden and experi-
ence of MM in older adults is worsened by socioeconomic disadvan-
tage (Martin et al., 2012; Melis et al., 2014; von dem Knesebeck
et al., 2015). Socioeconomic position is one dimension of the social
determinants of health, as characterized in the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) Commission on Social Determinants of Health (SDH)
framework (Solar & Irwin, 2010). The SDH conceptual framework
outlines how social, economic and political mechanisms (the context)
produce a set of socioeconomic positions where populations are
stratified hierarchically according to gender, ethnicity/race, educa-
tion, occupation and income (structural determinants) (Solar & Irwin,
2010) (see Figure 1). This framework emphasizes the interplay
between policies and the socioeconomic position of individuals or
groups (Solar & Irwin, 2010). Socioeconomic positions, in turn, influ-
ence the intermediary social determinants of health, including mate-
rial circumstances, behaviours, biological factors and psychosocial
factors (Solar & Irwin, 2010).
The context in the SDH conceptual model includes governance,
macroeconomic policies, social policies (e.g. housing), public policies
(such as, health and social protection) and cultural and societal values
(Solar & Irwin, 2010). The healthcare system itself is regarded as an
intermediary determinant as access to this system has the potential
to influence health outcomes by mediating differences in vulnerability
(Solar & Irwin, 2010). The SDH framework suggests that health inter-
ventions, research and policies cannot consider only singular determi-
nants of health focused on biological or physical factors (medical
determinants) (Solar & Irwin, 2010). If the multiple and adverse out-
comes of having MM in older adults are to be improved, an under-
standing
of
the
relationship
between
context,
structural
and
intermediary determinants of health and MM is needed.

 state of the science on MM (Whittemore & Knafl, 2005). The WHO
SDH conceptual framework was also applied so that current knowl-
edge was not only summarized but also critically advanced (Solar &
Irwin, 2010; Whittemore & Knafl, 2005). The SDH framework was
used to define the variables of interest (social determinants of
health) to extract the relevant data from the articles included in the
review (Whittemore & Knafl, 2005).

Search methods
A comprehensive search of computerized databases was completed
using the keywords “multimorbidity” and “multimorbid*” from 2000
to 2015 (MM is not a subject heading in any of the databases). Refer
to Figure 2 for flowchart of the literature search. A hand search of
Journal of Comorbidity (not indexed in databases) and a review of the
on-line list of publications from the University of Sherbrooke Inter-
national Research Community on MM were also conducted. The
web search engine, Google, was used to locate grey literature.
Articles were included if they met the following criteria: (1)
focused on older adults (aged ≥60 years); (2) were peer-reviewed
or grey literature commissioned by governments; (3) were pub-
lished in English; (4) featured randomized controlled trials (RCTs),
cohort
studies
or
qualitative
research;
and
(5)
contained
a
definition of MM. Only the highest level of evidence for quantita-
tive studies was included to create a manageable number of arti-
cles to synthesize. While including all of the relevant literature is
ideal in an integrative review, sampling decisions can be made if
justifiable to accomplish the aim of the review (Whittemore &
Knafl, 2005).
Articles were excluded if they were: (1) published in Non-English
language; (2) about younger adults (<60 years) or children; (3) study
protocols, conference abstracts, unpublished dissertations, or com-
mentaries; (4) measurement tool use or development studies; (5) sys-
tematic reviews; or (6) did not define MM. Where multiple articles
were written on a single research study, only the primary article was
included.

Search outcome
This search produced 22 relevant articles for review: 16 quantitative
studies (three RCTs (Boyd et al., 2009; Hochhalter et al., 2010;
Ekdahl et al., 2015) and 13 cohort studies (Bayliss et al., 2015; Hsu,
2015; Jackson et al., 2015; Landi et al., 2010; Marengoni, von

laki et al., 2015; von dem Knesebeck et al., 2015; Warner et al.,
2011; Woo & Leung, 2014); four qualitative studies (three with no
stated methodology (Bayliss et al., 2008; L€
offler et al., 2012; Hansen
et al., 2015) and one descriptive design (Gill et al., 2014); and two
grey literature reports (Gilbert et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2013).

Quality appraisal
Quality of the research articles was assessed by the first and second
authors using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 Tool for the RCTs and
the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Checklists for the
cohort and qualitative research (CASP 2013, 2014, Higgins et al.,
2016). The first two authors independently rated and appraised the
articles, discussed their assessments and achieved consensus. Arti-
cles were not discarded based on the risk of bias or quality but
rather the degree of risk and quality were variables in the data syn-
thesis phase (Whittemore & Knafl, 2005).
2.6
|
Data abstraction
To examine how the social determinants of health have been consid-
ered in conceptualizations of MM, four critical questions were cre-
ated based on the key principles of the WHO SDH conceptual
framework (refer to Table 1) (Solar & Irwin, 2010). Data were
abstracted by the first author using the main questions and were
summarized into a data table for each article.
2.7
|
Synthesis
Whittemore and Knafl’s (2005) process of data analysis (data reduction
and display, data comparison, and conclusion drawing and verification)
with qualitative coding and pattern development techniques were
employed to synthesize the data (Miles, Huberman, & Saldana, 2014).
2.7.1
|
Data reduction and display
Each data table was subjected to coding using a strategy that
involved both descriptive (a label is assigned to describe the topic of
a passage of data) and evaluation coding (assigns a judgement of the
presence of a concept) (Miles et al., 2014). Codes generated from
data tables were transposed to a single document for each type of
evidence (e.g. qualitative research).
2.7.2
|
Data comparison
Using an iterative process, the first author conducted pattern coding
for each type of evidence, whereby the descriptive codes were
grouped together into a smaller number of categories to draw con-
clusions (Miles et al., 2014). This process was repeated to find pat-
terns across all types of evidence for each of the four main
questions. Journaling to facilitate higher-level analysis and provide
an audit trail of developing patterns was also completed (Miles et al.,
2014).
2.7.3
|
Conclusion drawing and verification
As conclusions were drafted, the first author conducted a process of
verification by referencing journal notes and returning to the data
tables and primary sources to confirm that conclusions had not been
reached prematurely (Whittemore & Knafl, 2005). All of the evi-
dence, regardless of methodological quality, was incorporated to
answer the questions of how the social determinants of health have
been considered in conceptualizations of MM. To develop the recon-
ceptualization of MM, higher quality (low risk of bias and some risk
of bias) evidence was drawn on first. Lower quality (high risk of bias)
evidence only informed the reconceptualization if it offered addi-
tional explanatory power to the results derived from the higher qual-
ity evidence. Finally, the reconceptualization of the concept of MM
was drafted by the first author and reviewed, revised and agreed on
by all of the authors (Whittemore & Knafl, 2005).

RESULTS
This integrative review synthesized the evidence from the 22
included articles to answer the four main questions informed by the
WHO SDH framework. A summary of included articles is provided in
Table 2. Most of the RCTs had a high risk of bias. The cohort
research articles met most of the quality criteria, but in approxi-
mately half of the studies, the follow-up of subjects was not com-
plete enough and the cohorts were representative of a defined
population. The qualitative literature had methodological concerns in
that the methodology could not be determined in three of the four
studies and two studies did not describe how ethical standards were
maintained. Refer to Table S1 for the results of the risk and quality
appraisal.
3.1
|
What was the problem under consideration?
MM is predominantly framed as a medical problem requiring health-
care system redesign, a physician response, or an interdisciplinary
healthcare team response (Bayliss et al., 2008, 2015; Boyd et al.,
2009; Ekdahl et al., 2015; Gilbert et al., 2013; Gill et al., 2014;
Hansen et al., 2015; Hsu, 2015; Jackson et al., 2015; L€
offler et al.,
2012; Marengoni et al., 2008; Melis et al., 2014; St John et al.,
2014; Vassilaki et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2013; Woo & Leung,
2014). Some literature described multimorbidity as including other
non-medical dimensions, such as social networks and living condi-
tions (Landi et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2012; von dem Knesebeck
et al., 2015). Managing MM as the older adult’s responsibility
related to lifestyle choices and motivation was cited as another
dimension (Hochhalter et al., 2010; Warner et al., 2011). The finan-
cial burden of older adults with MM on the healthcare system was
also noted in the framing of the problem (Boyd et al., 2009; Gilbert
et al., 2013).
The contributing authors to the reviewed literature are primarily
affiliated with the departments of medicine (16 articles), health
research (8) and epidemiology (8) and less often with gerontological
(1), sociological (3) or anthropological researchers (0). Nurse authors
were only associated with two publications.
3.2

How were the social determinants of health
considered in the discussion of the problem?
In this review, the consideration of both structural and intermediary
determinants of health were evaluated (Solar & Irwin, 2010). In the
quantitative studies, the structural determinants were used primarily
in the descriptive statistical analysis of the samples, most often
as proportions of participants by gender or education (Ekdahl
et al., 2015; Jackson et al., 2015; Landi et al., 2010; Marengoni
et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2012; Menotti et al., 2001; Vassilaki et al.,
2015; Warner et al., 2011). Most commonly included structural
determinants were gender (21 articles), education (17) and income
(7). Little attention was paid to ethnicity/race (5), occupation (4) or
SES, conceptualized as a combination of income, education and
occupation but without an evaluation of social class (4). Refer to
Table 3. Some other quantitative studies examined associations
between MM and the structural determinants and concluded: (1)
development of MM was positively associated with lower education
(Melis et al., 2014); (2) higher SES status only marginally improved
health outcomes for older adults with MM (Woo & Leung, 2014); (3)
older adults with MM and lower incomes had poorer self-reported
health, function and quality of life than those with higher incomes
(von dem Knesebeck et al., 2015); (4) male gender was associated
with a higher mortality rate in older adults with MM (St John et al.,
2014); and (5) female gender and lower level of education were
associated with the risk of developing MM (Hsu, 2015).
The most commonly considered intermediary determinants of
health were the health system (13 articles) and behaviours (8), while
psychosocial factors (6), biological factors (4) and material circum-
stances (1) were attended to less (refer to Table 3). The qualitative
literature explored older adults’ experiences managing MM in the
healthcare system and similar to four quantitative studies (Bayliss
et al., 2015; Jackson et al., 2015; Vassilaki et al., 2015; Woo &
Leung, 2014) and the grey document by Gilbert et al. (2013), argued
improved communication and continuity of care would promote bet-
ter outcomes for older adults with MM.
The literature most often described psychosocial factors broadly
as modifiers of the experience of having MM although a few excep-
tions explored this determinant in more depth. One qualitative study
found that older adults developed social, emotional and practical
coping strategies to live successfully with MM (L€
offler et al., 2012).
In a community-based cohort intervention study of lay caregivers,
lack of social support was a trigger for destabilization and risk of
hospital admission in older adults with MM (Martin et al., 2012).
3.3
|
How was the socioeconomic political context
included in discussion of the problem?
The socioeconomic political context is another component of the
structural determinants of health (Solar & Irwin, 2010). Most of the
dimensions, including governance, macroeconomic policies and cul-
tural and societal values were not included as dimensions of MM in
this review. This represents a significant gap in understanding the
impact of context on older adults with MM.
Public policies were mentioned in only a few of the articles.
For example, American Medicare policies do not promote care
continuity for older adults with MM as they cover consultation
with one to three primary care and two to eight specialists within
2 years (Bayliss et al., 2015). In Canada, provincial funding formu-
las for physicians are based on single disease codes that do not
facilitate treating MM (Wilson et al., 2013). The Australian report
specifically lists the public policies that need to be improved to
support those with MM (Gilbert et al., 2013). This is the only doc-
ument to acknowledge that social policies would also need to be
examined, namely policy development by Health Workforce Aus-
tralia to ensure an appropriate work force to care for older adults
with MM (Gilbert et al., 2013).

What was the practice, research or policy
response to the problem?
From a practice perspective, four of the quantitative studies evalu-
ated
novel
clinical
interventions
to
manage
MM
(Boyd
et al.,
2009; Ekdahl et al., 2015; Hochhalter et al., 2010; Martin et al.,
2012). The nature of the interventions was patient and family-
centred, comprehensive care that supported self-management and
care coordination, generally by an interdisciplinary team. However,
the interventions were provided solely by the healthcare system
and did not involve other sectors and focused on care coordina-
tion in primary care for specialist consultation and hospital transi-
tions. Some aspects of the interventions were provided in the
home environment (Boyd et al., 2009; Ekdahl et al., 2015). This lit-
erature suggests that changes to the healthcare system alone
could translate into better health outcomes for this population.
Many of the authors identified future research priorities in the
area of older adults with MM, including: (1) explain national differ-
ences in mortality related to MM (Menotti et al., 2001); (2) examine
association between MM patterns and individual functional tasks
(Jackson
et al.,
2015);
(3)
understand
the
effect
of
social
determinants of health on MM (Landi et al., 2010; von dem Knese-
beck et al., 2015); and (4) determine what subgroups of older adults
with MM would benefit most from comprehensive care coordina-
tion (Bayliss et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2013). As discussed earlier
in the section on the socioeconomic political context, policy implica-
tions were only noted in one piece of grey literature (Gilbert et al.,
2013).

DISCUSSION
The goal of this review, namely to examine how the social determi-
nants of health have been considered in conceptualizations of MM,
was challenged by the less than comprehensive discussion in the
literature of the influence of these determinants on older adults
with MM. Thus, a tentative recommendation based on the present
state of knowledge will be offered on how the predominant dis-
ease-focused conceptualizations of MM could be combined with
the social determinants of health to create a multidimensional
description that more fully captures the complex needs of this
population.

Reconceptualization of MM
MM in older adults takes place in a socioeconomic and political con-
text that enables or disables access to health care and has an impact
on health and well-being. MM in older adults is the combination of
chronic conditions, including both mental and physical conditions.
MM can create vulnerabilities to life satisfaction, function, mortality
and independence depending on the level of disability and frailty
and presence of social support. The structural determinants of health
in older adults with MM include education, gender and income. The
ideal processes of care for older adults with MM include the key foci
of patient and family-centred care, care coordination (including
across transition points), interpersonal continuity and provision of
care in context (i.e. home environment). Health care for persons with
MM should be provided in a relationship centred on the individual’s
goals and context.

Contributions of the review
This article has generated three new and novel contributions to
the literature. First, this review underscores the lack of considera-
tion of the social determinants of health in current conceptualiza-
tions of MM. By considering both the structural and intermediary
determinants of health, the current focus on individual characteris-
tics (only a part of the social determinants) is shifted to consider
the larger picture of the social construction of inequities (Varcoe,
Pauly, & Lalibert�
e, 2011). For example, the RCT of a workshop
and coaching intervention could have been strengthened by com-
prehensively considering determinants beyond psychosocial factors;
yet, the researchers concluded that older adults do not know how
to engage productively with healthcare providers to self-manage
their MM (Hochhalter et al., 2010). This self-responsibility emphasis
erroneously reduces issues of difference to the individual and
avoids examination of contextual and sociopolitical conditions that
affect older adults’ ability to manage MM (Dhamoon & Hankivsky,
2011).
Additionally, by examining the determinants of health beyond
disease, the review highlighted how the social determinants of
health can influence both the needs of older adults with MM and
the capacity of the system to meet those needs. The healthcare sys-
tem is only one intermediary factor that influences health (Solar &
Irwin, 2010). Despite this, the included articles did not consider the
potential importance of other sectors, such as housing or recreation,
in meeting the needs of older adults with MM. Also, the impact of
culture and societal values on the experience of living with MM is
largely unknown (Solar & Irwin, 2010).
Second, the tendency of the literature to report the adverse
financial impact of older adults with MM on the healthcare system
reflects an ageist position that older adults are depleting the system
of its resources. This maintains older adults’ oppressed position as a
drain on the system and leaves unexamined both the diversity in this
population and which older adults need what type of support and
when (Dhamoon & Hankivsky, 2011). Ageism may also explain why
few explicit attempts have been made in this body of literature to
explore diversity in older adults, as it is assumed that by virtue of
being old they share the same experiences with MM (Dhamoon &
Hankivsky, 2011).
Third, this review revealed that medicine represents the predomi-
nant disciplinary perspective in this body of literature. This disci-
plinary stance may explain why conceptualizations of MM are based
on biomedical dimensions alone. Broadening the research teams to
include different disciplinary views could lead to different findings
(Hankivsky & Cormier, 2009). This finding may be a function of
semantics as nursing researchers tend to use the term multiple
chronic conditions instead of MM (Markle-Reid et al., 2016). If so,
this language barrier to collaborative research needs to be identified
and addressed. Particularly for a complex problem like MM, diverse
expertise is needed to understand and identify all of the influencing
determinants. For example, nursing, gerontological, sociological and
anthropological researchers could contribute to an improved under-
standing of the sociopolitical context that was largely ignored by the
reviewed literature.
Applying the WHO SDH framework to guide the integrative
review produced new knowledge. If an integrative review had been
conducted without the theoretical driver of this framework, the find-
ings would not have illuminated the gaps in understanding related to
the interactions of the structural and intermediary determinants as
well as the impact of the socioeconomic political context. However,
given its lack of explicit attention to ageing, it was limited in explain-
ing how health inequalities might develop for different groups of
older adults (Weber & Messias, 2012). This framework’s definition of
structural determinants did not allow the examination of how older
adults of different ages and gender, education and SES/social class
differentially experience MM (Giesbrecht, Crooks, Williams, & Han-
kivsky, 2012).
An intersectionality approach to the social determinants of health
is needed to address the limitations in the literature related to how
MM has been defined and used (Hankivsky & Cormier, 2009). Inter-
sectionality is a theoretical framework informed by critical feminist
philosophy to understand the complexities of individual health needs
and outcomes (Hankivsky & Cormier, 2009). For example, this frame-
work could be applied to subgroup analysis in intervention studies
to determine which groups of older adults benefit most from the
intervention vs. usual care.

Implications for nursing practice, research and
healthcare policy
This review and reconceptualization of MM has also created implica-
tions for nursing practice, research and healthcare planning and pol-
icy. For nursing practice, the inclusion of the socioeconomic and
political context as part of the conceptualization of MM raises
awareness that nurses and other healthcare professionals need to
address social inequities and work towards improvements (Kelly,
2009). For example, given the impact of SES on MM, nurses working
with older adults with MM should ask whether their clients are
56 |
NORTHWOOD ET AL.
 experiencing financial difficulties and link them with resources and
services (Brcic, Eberdt, & Kaczorowski, 2011).
Research in MM would be enhanced by engaging both clinical
researchers and those with a critical philosophical stance, such as
intersectionality researchers (Dhamoon & Hankivsky, 2011). This
research enterprise could include coalitions of a variety of stake-
holder groups—from researchers to policy-makers to activists to
older adults—working together to make positive social change for
older adults with MM (Hankivsky & Cormier, 2009). Engaging older
adults as partners in the research process would be one important
strategy (Wilson et al., 2015). The included studies did not include
older adults with MM in any part of the research process (other than
as subjects).
Conducting research from diverse disciplinary perspectives would
also influence the analysis of the determinants of health. In this
review, the structural determinants of health were regarded as mutu-
ally exclusive and not intersecting (Rouhani, 2014). This assumption
has created a gap in understanding of the social determinants and
how they intersect to promote or disable successful living with MM.
Furthermore, this approach to the determinants continues to rein-
force the ageist idea of older adults as a homogenous, rather than
heterogeneous group, from diverse cultural, social, geographic and
economic backgrounds (Shadmi, 2013).
Finally, much work is needed to understand the influence of
social and public policy as a determinant of health and its relation-
ship to older adults’ experiences of living with MM. In particular, the
relationship focus of care required by persons with MM calls for an
examination of policies regarding nursing-role funding and function;
physician reimbursement; eligibility criteria for home-care support;
accessible housing; and funding of care models in different sectors
that impede continuity of care.

Limitations and strengths
The results of this integrative review should be considered in light of
the review’s limitations and strengths. The first limitation is that only
the term multimorbidity was searched. While this concept was the
focus of the review, a broadening of the search to include “multiple
chronic conditions” may have differently informed the reconceptual-
ization and included more nurse authors (Ploeg et al., 2017; Roberto,
Gigliotti, & Husser, 2005). This approach also resulted in a small
sample size for the grey literature as multiple chronic conditions was
the more prevalent terminology in this genre of literature (Canadian
Institute for Health Information, 2011). Second, the inclusion of only
the primary article in a series of papers may have resulted in the
exclusion of relevant literature (Dattalo et al., 2012). Finally, the
exclusion of the cross-sectional study design meant that research
employing this design that explored the social determinants of health
was excluded (Jerliu, Toci, Burazeri, Ramadani, & Brand, 2013; Kha-
nam et al., 2011).
A strength of this review is the adherence to the rigorous
methodology provided by Whittemore and Knafl (2005) for conduct-
ing an integrative review. Also, multiple re-checks of the source
articles were performed at several stages of the analysis process to
avoid erroneous premature conclusions. Journaling during the analy-
sis, writing and reconceptualization phases also created an audit trail
of developing understanding.

CONCLUSIONS
This review demonstrates that the application of the WHO SDH
framework was useful to critically examine the current literature
regarding the conceptualization of MM. The SDH framework helped
to reveal what has been obscured in scholarship about MM in older
adults: issues of diversity, context and inequity.
While the impact of the social determinants on health is not a
new discussion, the results of this review provide future directions
for research (Calasanti, 1996). The introduction of a SDH framework
into the specialized area of healthcare research on MM provides a
structure to facilitate collaboration between older adults and their
caregivers, nurses and other healthcare professionals and researchers
and policy-makers of diverse philosophical stances (Calasanti, 1996).
For example, qualitative research could explore the new conceptual-
ization of MM by moving from descriptions of a “generic” older adult
with MM to examining how age intersects with other categories,
such as gender and SES (Hunting, 2014). Also, intersectional quanti-
tative analysis approaches that would allow measurement of the
new conceptualization could include, for example, taking a multiplica-
tive approach in multiple regression analysis to allow different deter-
minants to intersect with each other (Rouhani, 2014).
The reconceptualization of MM better informs clinical practice
by including a definition of MM, acknowledgement of the contextual
factors that influence MM and the primacy of relationships in provi-
sion of nursing care to this population. This review signals that
future clinical work is needed to understand the needs of older
adults related to age, ethnicity/race, occupation, income, material cir-
cumstances, behaviours and biological factors. This critical review
has pulled apart the “multi” in multimorbidity to reveal not only mul-
tiple conditions but determinants, diversity and directions for an
improved understanding of nursing practice with older adults with
MM.
