ABSTRACT: Epidemiologic evidence suggests that air pollution is a risk factor for childhood obesity. Limited exper-
imental data have shown that early-life exposure to ambient particles either increases susceptibility to diet-induced
weightgaininadulthoodorincreasesinsulinresistance,adiposity,andinflammation.However,nodatahavedirectly
supported a link between air pollution and non-diet-induced weight increases. In a rodent model, we found that
breathing Beijing’s highly polluted air resulted in weight gain and cardiorespiratory and metabolic dysfunction.
Compared to those exposed to filtered air,pregnant ratsexposed to unfiltered Beijing airwere significantly heavierat
the end of pregnancy. At 8 wk old, the offspring prenatally and postnatally exposed to unfiltered air were signifi-
cantly heavier than those exposed to filtered air. In both rat dams and their offspring, after continuous exposure to
unfiltered air we observed pronounced histologic evidence for both perivascular and peribronchial inflammation in
the lungs, increased tissue and systemic oxidative stress, dyslipidemia, and an enhanced proinflammatory status of
epididymal fat. Results suggest that TLR2/4-dependent inflammatory activation and lipid oxidation in the lung can
spill oversystemically, leading to metabolicdysfunction and weight gain.—Wei, Y., Zhang, J., Li, Z., Gow, A.,Chung,

It is increasingly recognized that environmental factors
such as air pollution may contribute to the global obesity
epidemic. Epidemiologic studies have shown an asso-
ciation between traffic density (a proxy of air pollution
exposure) and body mass index levels at age 18 years in
subjects living in Southern California (1) and an associa-
tion between maternal exposure to polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons in combustion particles during preg-
nancy with childhood obesity in children living in New
York City (2). Limited animal experimental data sup-
port these epidemiologic associations. For example, in
a mouse model, prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust
particles predisposes the offspring to increased sus-
ceptibility to diet-induced weight gain and neuroin-
flammation in adulthood (3). However, this study did
not establish a direct link between particle exposure and
weight gain under normal dietary conditions. Similarly,
another mouse study did not find a significant effect of
early-life particle exposure on body weight in adult-
hood, although the exposure resulted in increased in-
sulin resistance, adiposity, and inflammation (4, 5). A
recent study using diesel exhaust exposure of pregnant

 mice showed increased placental inflammation and fetal
resorption, along with increased weight in the surviving
offspring at 10 wk of age (6). These experimental studies
have focused on prenatal or early-life exposures and used
an intermittent exposure protocol either with laboratory-
resuspended particles or with artificially concentrated
ambient particles (in the absence of gaseous copollutants).
These exposure protocols may not represent real-life situ-
ations of continuous exposure to the air pollution mixture.
Ambient concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter
withadiameterof#2.5mm)inBeijinghaveinrecentyears
been high enough to reach comparable levels in an ex-
posure chamber (5). Without the need for further artificial
concentration, natural ambient air in Beijing was used in
the present study to examine whether living naturally in
such an environment can lead to weight gain, and if so,
what pathophysiologic processes are involved at the or-
gan, tissue, and molecular levels. Our control exposure
was the same Beijing air with particulate matter partially
removed and without changing gaseous pollutants, as we
focused on examining the effects of PM2.5 in the context of
the real-world air pollution mixture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics
All animal experimentations were conducted in compliance with
the guidelines of ethical animal research. The study protocol was
approved by the Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee at
Peking University Health Science Center before commencement
of experiments.
Exposure protocol
Two identically sized chambers, each ;1 m3 in volume (1.2 3
0.8 3 1.2 m), were used in the present study. Each chamber could
house a maximum of9 rat cages(4onthe upper rack and 5 onthe
lower rack). These chambers were placed side by side for whole
body inhalation exposure of rats in an air-conditioned room in
Beijing. The only difference between the 2 chambers was the
presence or absence of a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)
filter placed in the inlet duct. The room was about 2 km away
from northwestern fourth Ring Road, a major artery of the city
with8mainlanesand6auxiliarylanesthatcarriesnearly220,000
vehicles per day. Particulate matter concentrations were mea-
sured using 2 sets of single particle soot photometer and scan-
ning mobility particle sizer and aerodynamic particle size, one
for thechamber airstreamandtheother forambientatmosphere.
We calculated the removal efficiency of every particulate size.
The removal efficiency of the HEPA filter was 98.99 6 0.86% for
particles larger than 2.5 mm in diameter and 70.61 6 19.34% for
PM2.5. PM2.5 concentrations inside the chamber equipped with
the HEPA filter were estimated using outdoor PM2.5 concen-
trations and the filter removal efficiency for PM2.5. The temper-
ature inside these chambers was controlled at 24 6 1°C.
We started our experiments with pregnant Sprague Dawley
rats. All the rats were kept in an animal care facility before the
experiments commenced. We conducted the first set of experi-
ments using 30 pregnant Sprague Dawley rats that were 12 wk
old. On gestation d 4, rats were assigned to 2 groups: 18 entered
the unfilteredchamber,and the remaining12 entered the filtered
chamber. The assignment was done by consideration of baseline
body weight in such a way that the baseline weights were not
significantly different between the two groups. In each chamber,
no more than 2 rats were housed per cage to avoid over-
crowding. One group was placed inside a chamber with the inlet
air directly coming from outdoors; the other group was housed
inside a same-size chamber equipped with a HEPA filter at the air
inlet. The chambers were placed side by side inside an air-
conditioned room in Beijing. Rats lived in these chambers natu-
rally under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle and were fed a normal
chow diet. The animals were weighed when enteringthe chamber
(d 0) and then every 3 d until d 14, when a series of end points was
analyzed.Over this 14-d period, (December 28,2009, to January 10,
2010), PM2.5 concentrations were 73.5 6 61.3 mg/m3 in the un-
filtered chamber and 19.8 6 9.0 mg/m3 in the filtered chamber
(means6 SDofhourlyconcentrationsmeasuredthroughoutthe14-
d period). The SD values indicated large variability in the hourly
data. We observed large diurnal and day-to-day fluctuations in
ambient PM2.5 concentrations.
We found that 7 of 10 rats in the unfiltered air group and 4 of 6
in the filtered air group had produced pups. Among the rest of
the pregnant rats not dissected, we found that 6 in the unfiltered
group and 6 in the filtered group had delivered pups normally.
The pups prenatally exposed to unfiltered air stayed in the un-
filtered chamber, and the pups prenatally exposed to filtered air
stayed in the filtered chamber continuously until they were an-
alyzed either at 3 or 8 wk of age.
To allow for monitoring body weight for a longer period and
for measuring more endpoints in pregnant rats, we conducted a
second set of experiments using 16 pregnant Sprague Dawley
ratsat12wkold(10intheunfilteredairgroupand6inthefiltered
air group). The experiments started at gestation d 1 and lasted for
19 d. Pups of these rats were not further studied. All the exposure
experiments were carried out continuously 24 h/d and 7 d/wk
under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle throughout the 19 d period.
During this set of the experiments (March 12 – 31, 2010), PM2.5
concentrations were 64.6 6 72.7 and 16.7 6 9.6 mg/m3 in the
unfiltered and filtered chambers, respectively.
Blood and tissue biomarker assays
After euthanasia, the blood was collected in EDTA anticoagulant
tubes, then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The EDTA
plasma was separated and collected. Plasma cholesterol, glucose,
oxidative stress biomarkers, and inflammatory cytokines were
measured using enzymatic colorimetric assays for malondialde-
hyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH),total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride
(TG), LDL, HDL, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), C-X-C motif
chemokine 5 (CXCL5), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2),
TNF-a, IL-10, and IL-6. We ground 30 g each of lung, liver, spleen,
and brain in 1 ml PBS on ice and centrifuged the samples at
5000 rpm for 15 min. The clarifying middle layer was carefully
aspirated for MDA and 8-isoprostane assay kit analyses.
Lung morphometric analysis
The completely cut-down left lungs were fixed in 10% formalin
and embedded in paraffin for making hematoxylin and eosin–
stained slides, performing morphometric analysis, and perform-
ing further immunohistochemistry using slides. These slides
were analyzed by an optical microscope with a digital camera.
The right lung tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen for further RNA extraction. Other organs were col-
lected, weighed, and cryopreserved for further analysis.
Second-generation RNA sequencing for gene
expression analysis
Second-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to
analyze the genome-wide gene expression profiling in the lungs.

 RNA-Seq was analyzed by a commercial company (BGI, Beijing,
China). Gene expression results are presented as the log2 ratio of
data from the unfiltered air group to the data from the filtered air
group. Total RNA was extracted using a combination of Trizol
reagent and ethanol precipitation according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). The integrity and
quantity of RNA in the samples were determined using a spec-
trophotometer and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Tech-
nologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for verification
of selected genes
qPCR was used for verifying the significantly up- or down-
regulatedgenesthatwereidentifiedbyRNA-Seqanalysis.Onthe
basis of the RNA-Seq results, we selected 30 genes for further
qPCR analysis (Supplemental Table S1). The analysis was per-
formed on an Opticon 2 qPCR machine (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA) using SYBR Green mix (Tiangen Biotech) with the follow-
ing cycling program: 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 25 s,
and 60°C for 1 min. Glyceraldehyde 3-phostaphate dehydroge-
nase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control for normaliza-
tion, and each sample was run in triplicate. The aliquot of cDNA
was amplified with a pair of primers for each.
Statistical analysis
SAS 9.1.3 for windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used
to perform data analysis. The data are expressed as means 6 SD.
Pairwise comparison was conducted by Student’s t test (2-tailed)
with equal or unequal variance depending on F test results. A
value of P , 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Effects in pregnant rats
At the beginning of the experiments, there was no dif-
ference in body weight between pregnant rats to be
exposed to unfiltered air and those to be exposed to
filtered air. The mean body weight of the unfiltered air
group was consistently higher than that of the filtered
air group throughout the experiments, reaching statis-
tical significance on d 14 and 19 (Fig. 1A). The unfiltered
air group was 7% heavier on d 14 (P = 0.046) and 15%
heavier on d 19 (P = 0.0041). On d 19, the lungs of the
unfiltered group were heavier (by 25%; 1.47 6 0.19 vs.
1.18 6 0.10 g; P = 0.0004) and displayed both peri-
vascular and peribronchial inflammation (Fig. 1B). We
observed thickened alveolar septa and the presence of
mononuclear cell infiltration in the airway of the rats in
the unfiltered group compared to the lung tissues of rats
in the filtered group.
The rats in the unfiltered group also had heavier livers
(by 16%; 15.62 6 1.80 vs. 13.42 6 0.71 g; P = 0.011). The
mass of other organs, including adrenal, thymus, brain,
and epididymal fat, was not significantly different. As
shown in Fig. 1C, after the 19 d exposure protocol, the
unfiltered air group showed a significantly worsened
plasma lipid profile compared to the filtered air group:
LDL was 51% higher, TC was 97% higher, and TG was
46% higher. Moreover, GLP-1, an incretin hormone that
reinforces glucose-dependent secretion of insulin, was
significantly lower (by 264%) in the unfiltered air group.
GLP-1 is regulated by its degradation, which is accelera-
ted by systemic inflammation and has anti-inflammatory
properties within adipose tissue (7). This altered meta-
bolic profile is consistent with a loss of insulin-dependent
regulation of circulating glucose levels, which can lead to
production of reactive oxygen species. There were ac-
cordingly a significant reduction (262%) in plasma GSH
(a major antioxidant) and a significant increase (+91%) in

 plasma MDA in the unfiltered air group. These indicate
that unfiltered Beijing air induced a systemic oxidative
stress resulting in an increase in oxidized lipids within the
circulation, as MDA is a product of reactions between
lipids (e.g., n-6-polyunsaturated acids in cell membranes)
and reactive oxygen species such as peroxides (8).
Effects in rat offspring
We continued our experiments with the offspring of
the Sprague Dawley rats that had undergone the
14 d exposure protocol. The pups were placed into the

 continuously lived there until humanely killed for
analyses. At 8 wk old, both female and male rats in
the unfiltered air group had significantly greater body
mass (by 10 and 18%, respectively), lung mass (by 12
and 13%, respectively), and mass for other organs (liver,
spleen, and heart) compared to the filtered air group
(Table 1). Blood markers showed significant differ-
ences between the 2 groups, indicating that exposure
to unfiltered air resulted in a worsened lipid profile
(+24% LDL, 221% HDL, +86% TG, +16% TC), reduced
incretin levels (244% GLP-1), reduced antioxidant
capacity (246% GSH), and increased oxidative stress
(+90% MDA) (Table 2). Furthermore, we observed signif-
icantly higher concentrations of MDA and 8-isoprostane
in tissue samples of lung, liver, spleen, and brain in the
unfiltered air group (Fig. 2A).
Similar to that for the rat dams, lung histology revealed
both peribronchial and perivascular inflammation in these
rat offspring (Fig. 3). When we conducted RNA-Seq
analysis of lung tissue from both dams and pups com-
paring the unfiltered group to the filtered group, we found
gene expression changes for over 100 genes, some of which
were further confirmed for their expression changes using
qPCR assays (Supplemental Table S1). Using the DAVID
bioinformatic database revealed a focus of these up-
regulated genes upon inflammatory processes and glu-
cocorticoid response elements (9). A further analysis of
the up-regulated genes, using the online network tool
GeneMANIA (10), revealed a proinflammatory network
focused on acute inflammatory signaling and classic
macrophage activation, namely IL-6, CCL-2, CXCL-6,
and CCL-19 (Fig. 2B). In this context, it is important to
note that classic macrophage activation has been sug-
gested to play a role in metabolic responses to inhaled
pollutants (11).
In association with lung inflammation, we also
found evidence of systemic inflammation in the epi-
didymal fat, as indicated by the significantly raised
concentrations of 4 proinflammatory chemokines and
cytokines (CXCL5, CCL2, IL-6, and TNF-a) and signif-
icantly lower concentrations of the anti-inflammatory
cytokine (IL-10) in the unfiltered air group (Fig. 2C). We
particularly observed a .6-fold reduction in IL-10 and
.2-fold increases in TNF-a and CCL2, respectively. The
presence of worsened metabolic profile and adipose
inflammation led us to suspect that adipose tissue me-
tabolism may be altered. We found that the mass of
epididymal fat was 18% greater in the male rats exposed
to unfiltered air than in those exposed to filtered air
(Table 1). This indicates that the chronic exposure dis-
rupted the balance between the proinflammatory and
anti-inflammatory functions, priming the adipose tis-
sue toward inflammatory status that may be linked to
metabolic dysfunction.
DISCUSSION
The explanation of how airborne particles (or an air
pollution mixture) may cause metabolic dysfunction is
important in understanding the role of air pollution in
cardiometabolic diseases and underlying biologic mech-
anisms of particle health effects. In the present study, we
examined whether and how inhaled particles could lead to
non-diet-induced weight gain through one or more
biologic pathways. We used a real-life air pollution expo-
sure protocol, pathologic assessment, biochemical analysis,
and gene expression assays. We also examined molecular
processes involved in the pathophysiologic pathways by
measuring RNA and protein biomarkers.

Downloaded from www.fasebj.org by (85.203.44.48) on June 01, 2019. The FASEB Journal Vol. ${article.issue.getVolume()}, No. ${article.issue.getIssueNumber()}, pp. 2115-2122.
 In both rat dams and their 8-wk-old offspring, we
observed histologic evidence for perivascular and peri-
bronchial inflammation in the lungs, increased con-
centration of MDA in the tissue, increased MDA and
8-isoprostane, and decreased concentration of GSH in
the blood. The findings of the present study are con-
sistent with previous studies reporting that PM2.5 expo-
sure induces oxidative stress and inflammation in organ
tissues and the circulatory system, as summarized in a
statement of the American Heart Association (12).
The findings on epididymal fat mass and plasma
incretin also augment to the emerging evidence that
chronic exposure to PM2.5 leads to increased lipid de-
position in adipose tissue (13) and increased insulin
resistance (14). Because chronic inflammation is in-
creasingly recognized as part of the etiology of obesity,
and because metabolic diseases and obesity are closely
related (15, 16), our findings consistently provide evi-
dence that chronic exposure to a real-world air pollu-
tion mixture containing high-level of PM2.5 increases
the risk for developing obesity.
Previous studies have shown that administration of
TNF-a led to an increase in serum triglycerides and
very-low-density lipoproteins in rats and humans (17)
and inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport (18).
CXCL5 is produced concomitantly with IL-8 in re-
sponse to stimulation with TNF-a and mediates the
effects of TNF-a in insulin resistance (19, 20). Chroni-
cally elevated IL-6 levels have been associated with
the development of insulin resistance (19). In contrast,
levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine that at-
tenuates the inflammatory processes induced by TNF-a,
IL-6, and IL-1, have been adversely correlated with
body mass index, fat mass, and fasting glucose levels
(21, 22). Low levels of IL-10 in adipose tissues have been
associated with both metabolic syndrome and type 2
diabetes (23).
In stark contrast to the above findings in the offspring
after the 8 wk exposure protocol, we did not observe sig-
nificant differences in body and organ mass and blood
biomarkers (apart from HDL) between the 2 exposure
groupsinoffspringthathadonlylivedinthechamberfor3
wk (Supplemental Table S2). Lung histology results were
also similar, showing no significant inflammation in both
groups (Supplemental Fig. S1). This suggests that longer-
term exposure may be needed to generate continuous
inflammatory and metabolic changes that ultimately in-
crease body weight.

Figure 4. Mechanistic framework explaining how inhaled air pollutants disrupt metabolic state. Inhalation of air pollutants
(especially particulate matter) can lead to direct activation of alveolar macrophages through TLR2/4-dependent mechanisms
and generation of oxidized lipids within lung lining. These oxidized lipids can further activate inflammatory processes through
TLR2/4 binding or be released to vasculature, where they will initiate systemic inflammation and oxidative stress responses.
TLR2/4-dependent inflammatory activation, through activity of MyD88, will lead to release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as
CCL-2 and IL-6, from lung, also generating systemic inflammation. These systemic inflammatory activation processes, along with
loss of anti-inflammatory functions from incretins such as GLP-1, will lead to increased recruitment of activated inflammatory
cells to tissues and in particular adipose. Recruitment of such cells to adipose will worsen metabolic profile, leading to weight gain
and metabolic disease state. Prenatal exposure may enhance cellular and functional responses shown here.

 concentrations comparable to ambient concentrations
measured in typical urban/suburban areas in and below
the United States. 24 h PM2.5 standard of 35 mg/m3. The
filtration only removed the particulate component of the
air pollution mixture. Therefore, the health effects we ob-
served, more precisely speaking, reflect particulate effects
in the presence of gaseous copollutants. Moreover, it is
known that HEPA filters are more efficient in removing
larger particles than smaller particles. In the present study,
we observed a removal efficiency of 99% for PM larger
than2.5mmandof71%forPM2.5.WithinthePM2.5,wedid
not measure ultrafine particles (PM0.1), but we expect even
lower removal efficiency for PM0.1. Therefore, this study is
limited in terms of further elucidating the role of specific
role of ultrafine particles and PM2.5 within the context of
the air pollution mixture.
Nevertheless, using the comprehensive data from our
experiments in combination with previously postulated
mechanisms(12),wedevelopedamechanisticframework,
as shown in Fig. 4, for future hypothesis testing. In a rat
model, we found that exposure to ambient air containing
high concentrations of PM2.5 induced TLR2/4-dependent
inflammatory activation and lipid oxidation in the lung,
which then spilled over systemically, leading to metabolic
dysfunction and weight gain. The study provides mech-
anistic evidence that chronic exposure to air pollution in-
creases the risk for developing obesity and metabolic
syndrome. If translated to and verified in humans, these
findings will add support to the urgent need to reduce air
pollution exposure, given the growing burden of obesity
and related metabolic abnormalities in today’s highly
polluted world.
