ABSTRACT
Objective: Alterations in intestinal function, often characterized as a ‘‘leaky
gut,’’ have been attributed to children who are on the autism spectrum.
Disaccharidase activity, intestinal inflammation, and permeability were
analyzed in 61 children with autism and 50 nonautistic individuals with
gastrointestinal symptoms.
Methods: All patients had duodenal biopsies assayed for lactase, sucrase,
maltase, and palatinase activity. Intestinal permeability was evaluated by
rhamnose/lactulose
test
and
measured
by
high-performance
liquid
chromatography-mass
spectrometry.
Intestinal
inflammation
was
evaluated by fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin levels using enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay and histology.
Results: Some children with autism had mild levels of mucosal
inflammation on intestinal biopsy. Disaccharidase activity was not
different in autistic and nonautistic individuals. Fecal calprotectin and
lactoferrin were similar in both groups. Differences between lactulose
and rhamnose recovery and lactulose/rhamnose ratio in urine were not
statistically different in patients with and without autism.
Conclusions: The present study supports the observation that children with
autism who have symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders have objective
findings similar to children without autism. Neither noninvasive testing nor
endoscopic findings identify gastrointestinal pathology specific to autism,
but may be of benefit in identifying children with autism who have atypical
symptoms.
Key Words: autism, disaccharidase, inflammation, permeability

C
hildren with autism have behaviors that affect social inter-
action as well as verbal and nonverbal communication.
Common problems such as gastroesophageal reflux or constipation
may present with atypical symptoms such as stereotypical
behaviors, aggression, or self-injurious behaviors. Consequently,
gastrointestinal problems that may be easily recognized in a neu-
rotypical child may go undiagnosed in a child with autism. Previous
studies have suggested that lactase deficiency is common in both
children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurotypical
children (1–4). Some studies report that intestinal inflammation and
increased intestinal permeability are more common in children with
autism (5,6), whereas other studies could not find differences in
intestinal permeability between autistic and neurotypical children
(7). The aim of the present study was to assess intestinal function by
determining intestinal permeability, mucosal inflammation, and
disaccharidase activity in children with or without autism who
were having a clinically indicated endoscopy.
METHODS
Experimental Design and Patient Evaluation
The study population consisted of 61 children with ASD and
50 children with normal development. Children with autism were
diagnosed by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, 4th Edition determination by the treating physicians.
Consent was obtained from at least 1 parent and children older than
7 years were asked to provide assent if possible. The study was
approved by the institutional review board (Protocol No. 2004p-
001279) and was carried out in accordance with the Helsinki
What Is Known
� gastrointestinal disorders that may trigger behavioral
symptoms;
� increased frequency of lactase deficiency;
� intestinal inflammation;
� increased intestinal permeability (‘‘leaky gut’’).
What Is New
� There was no difference in lactase, sucrase, maltase,
and palatinase specific activity in autistic and non-
autistic children who are evaluated for gastroin-
testinal disorders.
� The biomarkers calprotectin and lactoferrin identify
children with and without autism who have intestinal
inflammation, but are not more commonly found in
children with autism.
� Abnormal intestinal permeability (lactulose/rham-
nose ratio) in children with autism is not found more
commonly in children with autism with gastrointes-
tinal symptoms than in neurotypical children with
similar symptoms.

Declaration of 1975. Information about the present study was regis-
tered into ClinicalTrials.gov. Children ranged in age from 18 months
to 18 years inclusive. Before being approached to participate in the
study all had clinical indications for diagnostic endoscopy and
ileocolonoscopy determined by their gastrointestinal physician.
The criteria used as indications for an upper endoscopy and/or
colonoscopy in children with autism who had language were similar
to the criteria used for neurotypical children, including diarrhea,
blood in the stool, weight loss, regurgitation, food refusal, or abdomi-
nal pain (Table 1). Indications for children without language included
chest tapping, head banging, posturing, aggressive/self-injurious
behavior, or pushing on their abdomen. Subjects with bleeding
disorders, or who had used pancreatic enzymes 14 days before the
procedure were excluded from the study. We used a case-control
design for the study. As was expected, the number of boys (41) in the
autistic group was higher than the number of girls (20), whereas in the
comparison group, the number of girls was higher (29 girls and 21
boys)(Table1).Themostcommonsinglegastrointestinalsymptomin
both groups was parental or patient report of abdominal pain followed
by diarrhea. The frequency of abdominal pain was similar in both
groups (38%), but diarrhea was reported more frequently in children
with autism (36% vs 10%). A history of constipation along with
abdominal pain was observed in 10% of children with autism but was
not noted in controls.
Sample Collection
All procedures were performed under general anesthesia.
Esophageal, gastric, duodenal, ileal, and colonic biopsies were
placed into formalin for routine pathological examination. Biopsies
measured for disaccharidase-specific activity were obtained from
the second part of the duodenum, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or
dry ice in the endoscopy suite, and stored at �80o C until analysis.
The carbohydrate solution used for the permeability test was
introduced directly into the duodenum at the initiation of the
endoscopy and urine was collected for the next 5 hours. Stool
samples were collected by parents at home at least 2 days after the
procedure, kept frozen, and delivered to the laboratory on ice.
Disaccharidase Analysis
Lactase, sucrase, maltase, and palatinase activity were per-
formed on duodenal biopsies using the Dahlqvist (8) method and
normalized to protein levels. Specific enzyme activity was
expressed
in
mmol
of
hydrolyzed
substrate
min/g
protein
(U/g protein). Protein content was tested by the Bradford (9) method.
Enzyme activity for lactase <15 U/g protein, sucrase <25 U/g
protein, maltase <100 U/g protein, and palatinase <5 U/g protein
was considered deficient (10,11).
Intestinal Permeability
The intestinal permeability test was performed after an over-
night fast. A sugar solution (100 mL) containing 5 g lactulose and 1 g
rhamnose was infused through the endoscope directly into the
duodenum at the beginning of the upper endoscopy. Patients were
not allowed any fluid orally for 2 hours after the solution was
administered and food was withheld for the 5 hours during which
time all urine was collected. The urine volume was measured and a
10-mL aliquot was preserved with 100 mL of 1% sodium thimerosal
and stored at –20oC until analysis. Sugar analysis was performed
using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. A
50 mL aliquot from each urinesampleisaddedto200 mL ofdeionized
water, and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 1 minute at ambient tempera-
ture. Fifty microliters, 0.5 mol/L aqueous sodium borohydride is
added to 50 mL clear supernatant; after 30 minutes the reduction
is quenched by addition of 50 mL, 0.5 mol/L aqueous acetic acid.
The neutralized sample is desalted over solid phase extraction
(Phenomenex Corp, Torrance, CA) (C18) and resolved in an Agilent
1200 high-performance liquid chromatography system: Stationary
phase-150 � 2mm,5mmaminopropylsilica;mobilephase:A—0.2%
aqueous acetic acid; B—acetonitrile; 0.3 mL/min. The gradient is
7 minutes linear from 10% A to 25% A, 10 minutes isocratic 25% A,
ramp down and equilibration with 10% A for 10 minutes. An Agilent
6400 mass spectrometer in negative ion mode detects rhamnose as
the m/z ¼ 165 peak and lactulose as the m/z ¼ 343 peak, with
standard (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) calibration curves of
peak areas linear from 0.05 to 10 mg/mL. Results were expressed as a
percentage of lactulose and rhamnose recovery in urine after 5 hours
excretion and as the lactulose/rhamnose ratio (L/R).
Fecal Biomarkers of Intestinal Inflammation
Stool samples were obtained at least 2 days after the pro-
cedure. An aliquot of 40 to 120 mg of stool was added to the
extraction buffer. For calprotectin the weight/volume ratio was 1:50
and for lactoferrin the weight/volume ratio was 1:20. Each sample
was vortexed for 30 seconds and then mixed on a shaker for 30
minutes. Fecal extracts were transferred to 1 mL tubes and cen-
trifuged at 10,000 g for 20 minutes at 48C. The supernatants were
collected and frozen at �80o C. After thawing the extracts were
diluted and run on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates.
Calprotectin was measured by the Calprest (PhiCal) enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay kit from Calpro (Norway); lactoferrin was
measured using the BIOXYTECH Lacto f EIA kit (Northwest Life
Science Specialties, Vancouver, WA).
Levels of calprotectin <50 mg of calprotectin/g stool are
considered normal (http://www.calprotectintest.com/english/cal-
prest.html). For healthy children and adults lactoferrin should not
exceed 1.45 � 0.40 mg/g (12).
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics
version 20 (IBM Corporation, NY). Pearson correlation was used
to compare the different parameters between ASD and control
group. Correlation coefficients were calculated for all possible
combinations of pairs of variables. In addition, the data were further

RESULTS
Morphological Analysis of Inflammation
Histologically, in the autistic group, 7 children out of
61 (11%) had esophagitis (Table 2). Five patients had features
consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease and 2 had features
consistent with eosinophilic esophagitis. Six children (10%) had
gastritis, 4 children (7%) had duodenitis, 3 children (5%) had ileal
inflammation, and 12 children (19%) had colonic inflammation.
Some children had inflammation in more than 1 area. Gastritis and
duodenitis were nondiagnostic; neither Helicobacter pylori nor
celiac disease were diagnosed. The findings in the ileum and colon
also were non-diagnostic with increased cellularity in the lamina
propria without chronic inflammatory changes. In the ASD group,
32 children out of 61 (52%) had some inflammation in the
gastrointestinal tract, but it was generally mild and nondiagnostic.
In children without autism, 4 (8%) had eosinophilic esophagitis,
2 had gastritis (4%), 2 had duodenitis (4%), 4 had ileal inflam-
mation (8%), and 9 children (18%) had colonic inflammation.
Three children had Crohn disease.
Disaccharidase Analysis
Specific activity for lactase, sucrase, maltase, and palatinase
did not show any significant difference between autistic and non-
autistic children (Table 3).
Fecal Biomarkers of Inflammation
Stool for calprotectin and lactoferrin analysis was measured
in 49 children with autism and 36 children without autism. Samples
from the 5 nonautistic children with Crohn disease or ulcerative
colitis were analyzed as a separate group. Fecal calprotectin was
elevated in 63% (31 out of 49) of children with ASD compared to
61% (19 out of 31) in nonautistic children. When the abnormal
value was increased to >150 mg/g, fecal calprotectin was, however,
elevated in 18% (9 out of 49) of children with ASD and in 26%
(8 out of 31) of children without autism. Similarly, there was no
difference in fecal lactoferrin between the 2 groups, as fecal
lactoferrin was elevated in 10% (5 out of 49) of children with
ASD and 6% (2 out of 31) in the non-ASD group (Table 4).
Intestinal Permeability Analysis
The urine for the intestinal permeability test was collected
from 47 children with autism and 42 children with typical
development. Lactulose (L) in the urine in children with autism
was 1.4 times higher than that in nonautistic children, but urine
rhamnose (R) was similar in both groups of children (Table 5).
Lactulose/rhamnose ratio (L/R) in children with autism was 1.6
times higher than that in group of children with typical develop-
ment; however, these differences between groups were not
statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
Suspected gastrointestinal inflammation in children with
autism has been the subject of much speculation and therapeutic
intervention based on limited credible evidence. Many parents and
clinicians have observed improvements in behavior, expressions of
pain, and stooling patterns with dietary and nonevidence-based
interventions. In data from the autism program at Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital, 24% of children with ASD had a history of
at least 1 gastrointestinal symptom (13). Studies suggest that
children who have more severe gastrointestinal symptoms as
assessed by a Gastrointestinal Severity Index have more serious
behaviors (14). The aim of the present study was to evaluate
intestinal histology, inflammation, permeability, and digestion of
disaccharides in a group of children with and without autism who
were being evaluated for gastrointestinal symptoms. Children who
were included in this study had clinical indications for an upper
endoscopy or colonoscopy and children with autism who did not
have stereotypical behaviors or gastrointestinal symptoms were
not enrolled.
A ‘‘leaky gut’’ in children with ASD has been associated
with behavioral changes (15). The permeability of the small
intestine was assessed by measuring urinary excretion of orally
administered sugars such as lactulose, L-rhamnose, and mannitol
(M) is frequently used to characterize mucosal integrity and gut
barrier function (16). Mannitol and rhamnose pass through the cell
membrane (transcellular pathway) and characterize the absorptive
function of intestinal mucosa, whereas lactulose passes through
intercellular junctional complexes (paracellular pathway) and
characterizes mucosal barrier function, the route taken by molecules
with molecular mass >180 Da (17). A normal value for the L/R
ratio is not easily identified from the literature. Miki et al (18) used
>0.05, Van Elburg et al (19) (L/M) used >0.09, and Navarro et al
(20) (L/M) used >0.1 as abnormal. Using 0.09 as the cut off there
were 25 of 47 autistic children and 19 of 42 nonautistic children
with abnormal L/R (P ¼ 0.45), respectively. Similarly, choosing 0.1
as the cutoff, 22 of 47 autistic children had increased permeability
compared to 12 of 42 nonautistic children (P ¼ 0.08). Based on
these data, intestinal permeability may be increased in some
children with autism and those without autism. Furthermore, chil-
dren with autism who have gastrointestinal disorders do not appear

to be more likely to have a ‘‘leaky gut’’ when compared to
neurotypical children with similar problems.
In children with autism, an increase in intestinal permeability
was reported by D’Euphemia et al (21), who found an abnormally
high lactulose/mannitol ratio in the urine in 43% of children with
autism. De Magistris et al (5) found increased intestinal per-
meability in 37% of children with autism compared to 4.8% in
healthy controls. Children who were on a gluten and casein-free diet
had lower permeability. Interestingly, in these studies recovery of
the transcellular permeability marker, mannitol, in the autistic
group was similar to healthy controls, but recovery of the para-
cellular permeability marker, lactulose, was significantly higher
than in controls who did not have intestinal disease or food allergy.
In a group of 16 children with autism in Tunisia, 25% had increased
intestinal permeability. The 4 children with abnormal permeability
all had histologically normal appearing duodenal mucosa, but 2 had
increased cellularity in the lamina propria. One had a positive
immunoglobulin G endomysial antibody (22). Robertson et al (7)
comparing 14 children with autism to healthy controls did not find a
difference in intestinal permeability. A recent report by Navarro and
colleagues (20), found that only 2 of 12 autistic patients (17%) had
increased intestinal permeability and that gluten did not affect
permeability. Variations in methodology and measurement of sub-
strates may account for some of the variability in these results.
In the present study there was no difference in the per-
meability of the transcellular marker rhamnose. Although both the
frequency of abnormal intestinal permeability as well as the lactu-
lose level and the L/R ratio was higher in children with autism, the
difference did not achieve statistical significance. Thus, our data do
not support increased permeability in children with autism com-
pared to neurotypical children undergoing an evaluation for gastro-
intestinal disorders. In the present study the intestinal permeability
studies were done by instilling the solution directly into the
duodenum while the patient was under general anesthesia. This
technique avoids the slower emptying of the substrates when they
are swallowed and released over a longer period of time from the
stomach. After the solution was administered, duodenal biopsies
were obtained and breaks in the mucosa could have affected
absorption. The combination of medications used for anesthesia,
the bolus of lactulose and rhamnose into the duodenum, and the
duodenal biopsies may all contribute to the increase in intestinal
permeability observed in both autistic and nonautistic subjects.
These findings do not exclude the possibility that a subgroup of
individuals with autism may have increased permeability.
Children with autism have been reported to have decreased
disaccharidase activity, particularly lactase (1,2). Our previous
study demonstrated that 58% of autistic children 5 years or younger
and 65% of older children were lactase deficient (4). These findings
are similar to the 66% frequency of lactase deficiency in children
with ASD found in this study. Furthermore, there was no statisti-
cally significant difference in lactase or other disaccharidase
activity between autistic children and nonautistic children with
gastrointestinal symptoms.
Fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin are clinical biomarkers that
are used to identify patients with colonic inflammation (23,24). In a
group of 24 children with autism, there did not appear to be an
increase in fecal calprotectin (25); however, De Magistris et al (5)
found that approximately 25% of children with autism with or
without gastrointestinal symptoms had elevated fecal calprotectin
compared with approximately 12% of normal relatives. In patients
with Crohn disease values of fecal calprotectin <170 mg/g, how-
ever, correlate with remission of disease (26). The mean fecal
calprotectin level in the children with autism in this cohort was
111 mg/g well below the cut off for what is considered to be active
inflammation in Crohn disease. These low levels of calprotectin and
lactoferrin are most consistent with insignificant inflammation.
Clinicians struggle with the value of initiating a diagnostic
evaluation of gastrointestinal function in a child with autism who
may have atypical symptoms. Common disorders such as slow
transit constipation may result in colonic distension causing pain or
dysbiosis that can be associated with increased gas or diarrhea. The
role of dietary restriction remains a confounding factor. The present
study suggests that the frequency of inflammation, intestinal per-
meability, or brush border enzyme activity does not differ in
children with or without autism who are being evaluated for
intestinal disorders. The technical issues involved in performing
the intestinal permeability test may, however, have affected the
results in both groups. The data from the present study should not be
used to justify performing endoscopic evaluations in all children
with autism. Only children suspected of having gastrointestinal
disorders were included. The results of the present study suggest
that common gastrointestinal problems occur in children with
autism and should be evaluated. There is no evidence to support
that gastrointestinal disorders cause autism. Identifying children
with ASD who have concomitant medical conditions such as
inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption, or lactose intolerance
may be challenging because their symptoms are atypical. In these
children, criteria such as stereotypical or self-injurious behaviors
may identify those individuals worthy of additional evaluation.
