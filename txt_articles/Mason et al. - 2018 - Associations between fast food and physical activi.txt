Associations between fast food and physical activity 
environments and adiposity in mid-life: cross-sectional, 
observational evidence from UK Biobank
Kate E Mason, Neil Pearce, Steven Cummins
Summary
Background The built environment might be associated with development of obesity and related disorders. We 
examined whether neighbourhood exposure to fast-food outlets and physical activity facilities were associated with 
adiposity in UK adults.
Methods We used cross-sectional observational data from UK Biobank. Participants were aged 40–70 years and 
attended 21 assessment centres between 2006 and 2010. Using linked data on environments around each participant’s 
residential address, we examined whether density of physical activity facilities and proximity to fast-food outlets were 
associated with waist circumference, body-mass index (BMI), and body fat percentage. We used multilevel linear 
regression models adjusted for potential confounders, and conducted several sensitivity analyses.
Findings Complete case sample sizes were 401 917 (waist circumference models), 401 435 (BMI), and 395 640 (body fat 
percentage). Greater density of physical activity facilities within 1000 m of home was independently associated with 
smaller waist circumference and lower BMI and body fat percentage. Compared with people with no nearby facilities, 
those with at least six facilities close to home had 1·22 cm smaller waist circumference (95% CI −1·64 to −0·80), 
0·57 kg/m² lower BMI (−0·74 to –0·39), and 0·81 percentage points lower body fat (−1·03 to −0·59). Living further 
from a fast-food outlet was weakly associated with waist circumference and BMI, mostly among women. Compared 
with people living fewer than 500 m from a fast-food outlet, those living at least 2000 m away had 0·26 cm smaller 
waist circumference (−0·52 to 0·01).
Interpretation This study shows strong associations between high densities of physical activity facilities and lower 
adiposity for adults in mid-life. We observed weaker associations for access to fast food, but these are likely to be 
underestimated owing to limitations of the food environment measure. Policy makers should consider interventions 
aimed at tackling the obesogenic built environment.

Introduction
Obesity is strongly linked to a range of chronic diseases, 
including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and 
contributes substantially to excess morbidity, mortality, 
and rising health-care costs globally.1,2 Across the world, 
increasing urbanisation is now recognised as a key driver 
of obesity and related non-communicable diseases, 
prompting calls to improve understanding of how urban 
environmental factors influence health.3
Particularly in urban areas, features of neighbourhood 
environments, such as access to unhealthy food and few 
opportunities for physical activity, might be associated 
with the development of obesity and related disorders. 
Collectively, such features are often referred to as the 
obesogenic environment,4 and their presence and 
unequal distribution might partly explain rises in obesity 
prevalence and persistent social and geographical 
inequalities in obesity.5 Although much research has 
been done on the influence of various neighbourhood 
features on obesity, consistent evidence remains elusive.4 
To further assess the potential of neighbourhoods to 
influence obesity outcomes via both energy intake and 
energy expenditure, and in particular the role of 
neighbourhood commercial resources, this Article 
focuses on two key features of the local residential 
environment: proximity to fast-food outlets and density 
of formal physical activity facilities. Recent studies 
indicate that about 21% of UK adults eat takeaway meals 
at home weekly6 and about 18% regularly use gyms, with 
smaller proportions participating in other forms of 
physical activity likely to involve formal facilities 
(eg, swimming and team or racquet sports).7
Previous research suggests that access to fast-food 
outlets near the home might be a determinant of weight 
status and obesity,8 although most supporting evidence 
comes from the USA, where the structure of the built 
environment differs from countries such as the UK. 
Although a recent study9 in Cambridgeshire, UK, found 
that exposure to fast-food outlets near home was 
associated with both body-mass index (BMI) and odds of

obesity in adults, other international research has not 
consistently replicated findings from the USA.10–12
A range of neighbourhood attributes have also been 
found to potentially influence physical activity;13 however, 
evidence of associations between obesity and neighbour-
hood attributes such as walkability and greenspace is 
mixed.4,14 Relatively little research has assessed the 
importance of local access to formal facilities for 
recreational physical activity, such as gyms, swimming 
pools, and playing fields, although recent research in the 
UK indicates a possible relationship.15
Most studies in the UK have focused on particular 
geographical areas, such as individual cities or regions,9,11,15 
with only one UK-wide study,16 which linked several 
neighbourhood-level contextual factors with obesity. 
Much like the international evidence, findings from the 
UK are mixed. This might be partly due to many studies 
being insufficiently powered, based on self-reported 
outcome measures, and focused on a narrow geographical 
area.
To improve understanding of how neighbourhood 
features influence adiposity and obesity-related out 
comes 
in the UK, analyses of high-quality, individual, objective 
health data linked to environmental exposures measured 
at the individual address level are needed, for the whole 
of the UK. Using observational data from UK Biobank—a 
large sample of adults in a crucial period of the lifecourse 
for the development of chronic disease—we assessed 
whether the number of formal physical activity facilities 
near an individual’s place of residence and proximity to 
fast-food outlets are independently associated with 
objectively measured adiposity. We also explore whether 
these associations differ by sex or income, and whether 
findings might be affected by residual confounding.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and 
Google Scholar, up to Aug 31, 2017, using various combinations 
of search terms including “neighbourhood”, “built environment”, 
“obesity”, “obesogenic”, “adiposity”, “food environment”, and 
“physical activity”, as well as hand-searching reference lists of 
relevant papers and tables of contents of recent or special 
editions of relevant journals. Our review of the literature was 
restricted to English language publications.
Much research has been done in recent decades into the effects 
of neighbourhood resources on obesity risk and related health 
behaviours. Features of the neighbourhood environment are 
hypothesised to affect diet quality through opportunities to 
consume healthy or unhealthy food (eg, access to fast food or 
grocery stores) and either encourage or discourage physical 
activity (eg, greenspace and street connectivity). However, the 
evidence base regarding so-called obesogenic environmental 
effects remains equivocal.
Many studies suggest that access to fast-food outlets in the 
local residential environment is a determinant of adiposity, but 
most evidence comes from the USA. Relatively little research 
has assessed the importance of local access to formal facilities 
for recreational physical activity (eg, gyms, leisure centres, 
swimming pools, and playing fields), instead focusing on 
broader urban design features such as walkability. In the UK, 
as elsewhere, many studies have been limited to a narrow 
geographical focus, relied on samples not sufficiently powered 
for subgroup analyses, or been prone to bias from residual 
confounding and exposure misclassification.
Added value of this study
This study is one of the first published to use UK Biobank to 
examine associations between features of the neighbourhood 
built environment and adiposity. The sample is made up of 
adults in mid-life—a crucial period of the lifecourse for the 
development of chronic disease. By using a very large dataset 
that covers much of the UK, we were able to provide evidence 
that relates to a wider geographical area than do most 
UK-based studies, and to examine sex and income differences. 
Making use of extensive covariate data available in UK Biobank, 
we were able to more comprehensively adjust for sources of 
confounding than have many other studies, and with 
additional sensitivity analyses, we were able to examine the 
robustness of our findings to residual confounding and 
different model specifications, further strengthening our 
findings.
We examined two features of the neighbourhood residential 
environment: proximity to fast-food outlets and density of 
formal physical activity facilities. We found evidence of a strong 
and graded inverse association between number of physical 
activity facilities close to home and three different adiposity 
measures. We observed a weaker association between the 
fast-food environment and adiposity, but limitations of the 
available food environment measure, such as misclassification 
of some fast-food outlets as restaurants and the inability to 
simultaneously account for both healthy and unhealthy food 
outlets, are likely to have attenuated the results. We also 
observed income and sex differences.
Implications of all the available evidence
The results of this study provide evidence to support the 
hypothesis that increasing access to local physical activity 
facilities and, possibly, reducing access to fast food close to 
residential areas has the potential to reduce overweight and 
obesity at the population level. Policy makers should consider 
interventions aimed at modifying residential environments to 
better facilitate healthy lifestyles, but recognising that such an 
approach might be more effective in some groups than in 
others. Future research should involve further interrogation of 
this rich data resource to examine geographical and other 
forms of heterogeneity in the effects of obesogenic 
environments on health to best target interventions.

Methods 
Study population
We used cross-sectional baseline data from UK Biobank 
(project 17380), a large, population-based cohort; the 
scientific rationale, study design, and survey methods for 
this project have been described elsewhere.17 Data were 
potentially available from 502 656 individuals who had 
visited the 22 UK Biobank assessment centres across the 
UK between 2006 and 2010. Individuals aged 40–69 years 
living within a 25-mile radius of an assessment centre 
and listed on National Health Service patient registers 
were invited to participate in the UK Biobank study. The 
age range was chosen by UK Biobank as an important 
period for the development of many chronic diseases. 
The final recruited sample was aged 37–73 years, with 
more than 99% of participants aged 40–69 years. 
Linked to UK Biobank is a high-resolution spatial data-
base of objectively measured characteristics of the 
physical environment surrounding each participant’s 
exact residential address, derived from multiple national 
spatial datasets.18 The measures of the local environment 
include densities of various land uses, proximity to 
various health-relevant destinations (eg, general practi-
tioners practices, industrial sites, fast-food outlets), 
green 
space, street-network accessibility, and pollution. 
The metrics were constructed using data collected in 
2010, as close as possible to the baseline assessment of 
indivi 
duals.18
UK Biobank has ethics approval from the North West 
Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee (reference 
16/NW
/0274).
Exposures
We defined the physical activity environment as the 
density (count) of formal physical activity facilities within 
a 1000 m street-network buffer around each individual’s 
place of residence. Formal physical activity facilities were 
defined at address level as any land use classified in the 
Commercial-Leisure subcategory of the UK Ordnance 
Survey 
AddressBase 
Premium 
database.18 
This 
subcategory comprises a range of indoor and outdoor 
facilities designed for sporting and leisure activities, 
such as gyms, swimming pools, and playing fields (see 
appendix for details). We did not include informal 
physical activity facilities, such as public parks and 
cycling paths (except where covered by the above 
classification—eg, playing fields), because formal 
physical activity facilities are understudied as a 
neighbourhood health resource and might have different 
drivers of use. Because many of these facilities are 
commercial, they are also potentially modifiable via 
regulatory and commercial levers that are less relevant to 
the informal physical activity environ 
ment.
For each individual, the street-network distance 
(in metres) from residential address to the nearest fast-
food outlet, classified as “hot/cold fast-food outlet/
takeaway” in the UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase 
Premium database,18 was available. We used these 
distances and the distribution of data to categorise 
individuals as living closer than 500 m, 500–999 m, 
1000–1999 m, or at least 2000 m from their nearest fast-
food outlet. A proximity measure was used by contrast 
with the physical activity environment density measure 
because no equivalent density measure was available for 
the food environment. Density and proximity measures 
in the UK have been shown to be correlated despite being 
theoretically distinct.19
Adiposity measures
We used three adiposity measures: waist circumference, 
BMI (calculated from height and weight), and body fat 
percentage (measured by bioimpedance). Measurements 
were made by trained staff using standard procedures.17 
We centred all three metrics around their mean and 
treated them as continuous variables.
Potential confounders and model adjustments
We identified potential confounders for each of the 
two environmental exposures on the basis of the existing 
literature, and summarised this information in directed 
acyclic graphs to assess which should be adjusted for in 
the main analyses (appendix). Potential confounders 
included individual demographic and socioeconomic 
variables and several local area characteristics. Because 
the fast-food and physical activity environments are also 
associated with one another, features of the food environ-
ment might confound associations between the physical 
activity environment and adiposity, and the physical 
activity environment might confound associations 
between the food environment and adiposity. Although 
individual diet and physical activity behaviours are 
associated with adiposity, physical activity is unlikely to 
be a common ancestor of the food environment and 
adiposity, and similarly diet will not predict the physical 
activity environment. Furthermore, conditioning on 
these behaviours risks inducing collider bias20 by opening 
backdoor 
pathways 
through 
genetic 
risk, 
prior 
behaviours, and prior adiposity.
On the basis of these causal diagrams, we adjusted the 
final models for age (years), sex (male or female), 
ethnicity (white, south Asian, black, other Asian, mixed 
white and black, mixed white and Asian, mixed other, or 
other), highest education level attained (college or 
university degree; A levels, AS levels, or equivalent 
[academic advanced levels, post compulsory education]; 
O levels, GCSEs, or equivalent [higher secondary 
education]; CSE or equivalent [secondary education]; 
National Vocational Qualification, Higher National 
Diploma, Higher National Certificate, or equivalent 
[vocational 
qualifications]; 
other 
professional 
qualification; or none of the above), annual household 
income 
(<£18 000, 
£18 000–30 999, 
£31 000–51 999, 
£52 000–100 000, or >£100 000), employment status (paid 
work, retired, unable to work, unemployed, or other),

area deprivation (Townsend score), urbanicity (urban or 
non-urban), and neighbourhood residential density 
(count of residential dwellings within a 1000 m street-
network buffer of home address, log transformed). We 
adjusted models of the physical activity environment and 
adiposity for fast-food proximity, and adjusted models of 
the fast-food environment and adiposity for density of 
physical activity facilities.
We used negative control analyses to analyse possible 
residual confounding. Negative control analysis is a 
technique that can help to detect residual confounding in 
observational studies.21 Because studies of neighbourhoods 
and health are potentially susceptible to residual 
confounding by factors such as other neighbourhood 
characteristics and residential segregation, we employed 
this technique by doing analyses similar to our primary 
analyses, but in which the outcome was a variable not 
expected to be associated with our exposures; specifically, 
we used height (cm) as a negative control outcome 
because height is unlikely to be related to neighbourhood 
environment in adulthood, but, as with adiposity, it is 
correlated with various sociodemographic characteristics 
of individuals. If the main associations for adiposity were 
residually confounded, we would expect to observe a 
spurious 
association 
between 
the 
environmental 
exposures and height.
Statistical analysis
We used multilevel, multiple linear regression models 
with random intercepts and random coefficients for the 
main exposure to estimate independent associations 
between each environmental exposure and each adiposity 
outcome, accounting for the nesting of individuals 
within assessment centres. We initially adjusted only for 
age and sex (model 0), then for likely demographic 
confounders (age, sex, ethnicity, area deprivation, and 
urbanicity; model 1), then further adjusted for individual-
level socioeconomic characteristics (income, education, 
and employment status; model 2) and, finally, for the 
non-exposure environmental feature (proximity to fast 
food or density of physical activity facilities) and 
neighbourhood residential density (model 3). As well as 
adjusting for potential confounding by sex and income, 
we also tested fully adjusted models for effect 
modification by these variables. We report stratified 
results where models with interaction terms for sex or 
income were statistically different from those without 
(likelihood ratio test p<0·05). Finally, we estimated the 
same models using height as a negative control outcome.
We designed sensitivity analyses to test the robustness 
of our findings to different model specifications. These 
analyses examined the effect of further adjustment for 
the behavioural variables diet and physical activity; the 
extent to which any such effect was driven by selection 
bias due to missing data; and the sensitivity of our 
models to the choice of BMI measure.
We did all analyses in Stata SE version 14.2.

Results
Environmental data were available for individuals from 
21 of the 22 assessment areas; no environmental data 
were collected for participants assessed in Stockport, 
where the pilot study was conducted. Of the primary 
covariates (excluding diet and physical activity), income 
had the most missing data, followed by residential 
density, BMI, and body fat percentage (table 1). All other 
covariates were missing at a frequency of approximately 
1% or less (table 1). After the exclusion of cases missing 
data on key covariates, the final complete case sample 
sizes were 401 917 for waist circumference analyses, 
401 435 for BMI analyses, and 395 640 for body fat 
analyses. Excluded observations were very similar to 
complete cases in terms of neighbourhood exposures and 
adiposity, but were more often people from more deprived 
postcodes, less highly educated, more likely to be retired, 
and more likely to be of south Asian or black ethnicity.
The mean waist circumference of the full sample with 
environmental data available was 90·3 cm, mean BMI 
was 27·4 kg/m², and mean body fat percentage was 
31·5% (table 1). The median number of formal physical 
activity facilities within a 1000 m street-network distance 
of parti 
cipants’ homes was one, with a third of participants 
having no facilities close to home (table 1). Participants 
lived a median of 1136 m from a fast-food outlet, with 
nearly a fifth living within 500 m of such an outlet 
(table 1).
In fully adjusted models, adiposity was lower among 
people with greater access to local physical activity 
facilities compared with those with fewer facilities near

home (table 2). Compared with the reference category 
(no nearby physical activity facilities), the waist 
circumference of those with at least six facilities nearby 
was, on average, 1·22 cm smaller (95% CI −1·64 to −0·80; 
p<0·0001); 
their 
BMI 
was 
0·57 
kg/m² 
lower 
(−0·74 to −0·39; p<0·0001); and their body fat was 0·81 
percentage points lower (−1·03 to −0·59; p<0·0001). 
Regression coefficients decreased monoton 
ically across 
categories of increasing density.
Main effect estimates were smallest in models adjusted 
only for age and sex (model 0; table 2). In fully adjusted 
models (model 3), physical activity environment 
coefficients were attenuated compared with models 
that also controlled for ethnicity, urbanicity, and area 
deprivation (model 1), but were larger in magnitude than 
intermediate models further adjusted for individual 
socioeconomic characteristics (model 2; table 2).
For the associations between physical activity facilities 
and adiposity, we found evidence of effect modification 
by sex (waist circumference p<0·0001; BMI p=0·0009; 
body fat p=0·0029) and income (waist circumference and 
BMI both p<0·0001; body fat p=0·0026), with an inverse 
association for all subgroups but stronger among women 
(figure 1) and people from higher-income households 
(figure 2).
We also estimated lower mean waist circumference 
with each categorical increase in distance to the nearest 
fast-food outlet, independent of the influence of the 
physical activity environment and all other covariates (ie, 
model 3; table 3). However, the only significant 
coefficients estimated were for intermediate proximity 
categories, and these were small: compared with 
participants living within 500 m of a fast-food outlet, the 
mean waist circumference among those living within 
500–999 m was 0·15 cm smaller (95% CI  −0·30 to −0·01, 
p=0·040) and 0·22 cm smaller (−0·44 to 0·00, p=0·049) 
for those living within 500–1499 m (table 3). For those 
living at least 2000 m from an outlet, the average decrease 
was 0·26 cm (95% CI −0·52 to 0·01; p=0·057). We 
observed a similar pattern of association for BMI. For 
body fat percentage, evidence of an association was 
weaker—eg, for people living at least 2000 m from a fast-
food outlet, body fat was 0·10 percentage points lower 
(p=0·18). Sex modified these relationships for all three 
outcome measures (p<0·0001 for all measures; figure 1), 
whereas income did not (waist circumference p=0·094; 
BMI p=0·423; body fat p=0·083; appendix). With regard 
to sex, only among women did we observe an inverse 
dose–response association, with lower average adiposity 
across all measures the further a woman lived from a 
fast-food outlet, although only the waist circumference 
coefficient for the greatest distance category (≥2000 m) 
reached significance at the 5% level (0·36 cm decrease, 
95% CI −0·72 to −0·01). We observed no such association 
for men. 
Fast-food-environment coefficients in fully adjusted 
models were substantially attenuated compared with 
models adjusted only for age and sex, but were larger in 
magnitude than in both intermediate models, suggesting 
that failure to adjust for neighbourhood-level con-
founders attenuates results.
The negative control analysis, using height as an 
outcome, yielded the expected null results for the fast-
food environment, but showed evidence of increasing 
height with an increasing number of formal physical 
activity facilities; regression coefficients were small 
in magnitude (all <0·52 cm difference) but significant 
for the subgroups of 2–3 facilities, 4–5 facilities, and 
six facilities or more (table 4), suggesting some possible 
residual confounding.
Additional adjustment for behavioural confounders 
had negligible impact on the regression coefficients

Density is defined as number of physical activity facilities in a 1000 m street-network buffer. Data are mean difference 
(95% CI). Model 0: adjusted for age and sex. Model 1: model 0 plus adjustment for ethnicity, urban or non-urban 
status, and area deprivation. Model 2: model 1 plus adjustment for individual socioeconomic characteristics (income, 
education, and employment status). Model 3: model 2 plus adjustment for residential density and distance to nearest 
fast-food outlet.

(appendix). Adjustment for diet in a sensitivity analysis 
of physical activity models did not lead to substantively 
different conclusions but did inflate some point 
estimates; however, sensitivity analyses that estimated 
model 3 on a sample restricted to people with dietary 
data produced almost identical results, indicating that 
the observed inflation is driven by sample restriction due 
to missing data rather than solely additional adjustment 
for diet (appendix). Models that excluded the small 
proportion of BMI values measured manually rather 
than 
with 
the 
bioimpedance 
machine 
yielded 
substantively identical results to those from the primary 
analysis (appendix).
Discussion
In this uniquely large and geographically diverse sample 
of adults in mid-life, we found consistent evidence that 
local access to formal physical activity facilities such as 
leisure centres, gyms, and sports fields is independently 
associated with adiposity. As the density of formal

physical activity facilities increased, waist circumference, 
BMI, and body fat percentage all decreased. We observed 
a similar but much weaker association between proximity 
to fast-food outlets and adiposity. This dataset provided a 
unique opportunity to examine these associations in a 
sample spanning diverse areas of the UK rather than 
being limited to a single study site.
Physical activity facilities in the local environment 
provide 
convenient 
opportunities 
for 
recreational 
physical activity. If improved access increases physical 
activity behaviour, we would expect to see a causal effect 
on adiposity. In income-stratified models, the inverse 
association we observed for all income groups was most 
marked among higher-income households. This finding 
is unsurprising given many facilities have costs attached 
to use, and has implications for municipal and private 
providers of physical activity facilities, who should be 
encouraged to invest in facilities in or near residential 
areas, but also to ensure that costs of access are managed 
to avoid inadvertently widening health inequalities.
Although our findings regarding physical activity 
facilities are consistent with a recent Scottish study15 that 
found some measures of accessibility of physical activity 
facilities to be associated with BMI, our food environment 
findings are somewhat inconsistent with a recent study9 
in England that found a strong, graded association 
between fast-food access and BMI, whereas we observed 
only a weak association. Food outlet classification in the 
source database for the current study is supplied by local 
authorities and might include misclassification of some 
outlets as restaurants rather than fast-food outlets, 
potentially biasing our regression coefficients towards 
the null. Given the limits of the available data, we were 
also unable to account for other dimensions of the food 
environment, which might have biased our estimates 
(see appendix p 2). Indeed, empirical evidence from 
other studies suggests that simultaneously accounting 
for healthy and unhealthy food outlets yields larger and 
more precise estimates of health effects than when 
considering only a single dimension of the food 
environment.9,22,23 This possibility of bias is further 
supported indirectly by the observation from our 
intermediate models that main effects were attenuated 
when no adjustment was made for other area-level 
confounders. There might also be local variability in the 
accuracy and completeness of these data, which we have 
not been able to assess. Stronger measures of the food 
environment linked to this dataset would provide more 
robust evidence on which to make more reliable 
inferences about the role of the fast-food environment in 
the UK. For many people, environmental determinants 
of diet and weight are also likely to include commuting 
routes and workplaces,24 but we were unable to assess 
these. Associations between adiposity and neighbourhood 
food environments might also not be consistent across 
geographical regions, even within the same country.25,26
We found strong evidence of effect modification by sex, 
and stratified models showed modestly larger estimates 
of effects of both neighbourhood exposures on women’s 
adiposity than on men’s. Other studies have also observed

sex differences in neighbourhood effects, in which 
women in some age groups appeared more sensitive to 
health 
impacts 
of 
local 
environments.27,28 
These 
differences might relate to traditional gender roles that 
result in women spending more time than men in their 
local neighbourhood, although this has not been clearly 
established.28
The negative control analysis for the physical activity 
environment indicates possible residual confounding, 
because we observed an unexpected association with 
height. Comparison of standardised coefficients across 
the relevant models (not shown) suggests this residual 
confounding would only partially account for the observed 
effect. For the physical activity environment, we observed 
in intermediate models that failure to adjust for individual 
socioeconomic characteristics biased coefficients away 
from the null. Therefore, if individual socioeconomic 
position has not been adequately controlled for (eg, 
insufficient specificity in the categorical, non-equivalised 
income variable), main effects might be overestimated.
This study has several strengths. The unique scale and 
size of UK Biobank reflect a geographical coverage that 
no other similar studies have, particularly in the UK, and 
enables examination of subgroup heterogeneity often not 
possible in smaller studies. We investigated two 
neighbourhood exposures, based on exact home address, 
thought to influence the same outcome via separate 
pathways, and assessed their independent associations 
with adiposity by controlling one for the other. Both 
exposures are primarily commercial in nature, and 
therefore amenable to regulatory and market-based 
interventions. One of these exposures—formal physical 
activity facilities—has received relatively little research 
attention to date. We examined associations with multiple 
objective biomarkers of adiposity because available 
measures vary in how well they predict different health 
outcomes in different populations.29 The consistency we 
observed across multiple outcome measures, especially 
for the physical activity environment, can be seen as 
providing stronger evidence of a potentially causal 
relationship. Sensitivity analyses suggest our main 
findings are robust to model misspecification, and that 
adjustment for health behaviours is not necessary, and in 
some cases might induce bias. Our findings were also 
consistent in preliminary analyses using alternative 
cutpoints for categories of the exposure variables (not 
shown). Although modest, the adiposity differences 
observed are averages across the sample, including 
people unlikely to eat fast food or use physical activity 
facilities regardless of local accessibility. If these observed 
differences do represent a causal relationship, the actual 
magnitude of effect would be larger among those likely to 
be affected.
In addition to weaknesses of the food environment 
measure highlighted above, the study has some further 
limitations. Although the UK Biobank sample is very 
large, the response rate was low (5·5%) and the sample 
shows evidence of so-called healthy volunteer bias.30 The 
non-null associations we observed between access to 
physical activity facilities and height in a negative control 
analysis suggest that some unmeasured confounding of 
the physical activity environment associations with 
adiposity remained. Studies of neighbourhood effects are 
particularly susceptible to bias arising from residential 
mobility, where movement between neighbourhoods 
over time increases the risk of exposure misclassification, 
and leaves open the potential for reverse causation in 
cross-sectional analyses if, for example, individuals with 
lower adiposity choose to live in areas with more physical 
activity facilities. Current adiposity might also reflect 
exposure to neighbourhood environments earlier in life, 
posing a further challenge for causal inference. 
Therefore, an important strength of this sample is its 
stability: more than 65% of respondents had been 
resident at their current address for at least 10 years 
(mean 17·3 years [SD 11·8]). Despite this, some risk of 
exposure misclassification might remain owing to 
retailer turnover, especially for fast-food outlets. 
Furthermore, the relationship between the fast-food 
environment and adiposity is likely to be bidirectional, 
but within this study we were unable to disentangle the 
possible effects of retailers positioning fast-food outlets 
in areas of higher demand. Another limitation of our 
analyses is the unavailability of equivalent metrics for the 
physical activity and food environments that might allow 
a more direct comparison of their influence.
Research on neighbourhood environments and obesity 
has produced inconsistent findings to date. Our findings 
from a large and geographically diverse sample of adults 
in mid-life add support to the hypothesis that increasing 
access to physical activity facilities and, possibly, reducing 
access to fast food close to residential areas has the 
potential to reduce the prevalence of obesity and 
overweight at the population level, but highlight that this 
approach might be more effective for some groups than 
for others.
