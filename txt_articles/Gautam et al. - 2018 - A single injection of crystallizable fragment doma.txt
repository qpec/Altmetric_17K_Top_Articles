ecause an effective anti-HIV-1 vaccine is not currently avail-
able nor imminent, new approaches are needed to prevent 
HIV transmission. Such new strategies have included the use 
of bNAbs, isolated from infected persons with high titers of anti-
HIV-1 neutralizing activity1–3. bNAbs are capable of neutralizing 
most circulating strains, targeting different nonoverlapping epit-
opes on the HIV-1 envelope spike, such as the CD4-binding site3–5, 
variable loop 1 and 2 (V1V2 loop)2,6, V3 loop1,7,8, the membrane 
proximal region9 and a series of epitopes spanning the gp120–gp41 
interacting region10,11. Several bNAbs, including 3BNC117, VRC01, 
PGT121 and 10-1074, can protect macaques from simian–HIV 
(SHIV) infections12–17. In addition, these antibodies have been 
reported to control virus replication in chronically SHIV-infected 
monkeys18–21. Human studies using the VRC01 or 3BNC117 mono-
clonal antibodies, which target the CD4-binding site, or the 10-1074 
monoclonal antibody, which binds to the base of the gp120 V3 loop 
and surrounding glycans, have shown that the antibodies are gen-
erally safe and active in vivo22–25. bNAb administration transiently 
reduces plasma viremia and delays rebound during treatment inter-
ruption in individuals with an HIV-1 infection22–27.
We previously reported that single intravenous (i.v.) injections 
of native VRC01, 3BNC117 or 10-1074 bNAbs (20 mg per kg body 
weight) prevented virus acquisition in macaques following repeated 
low-dose (RLD) challenges with tier 2 SHIV
AD8-EO as compared to 
control monkeys that received no anti-HIV-1 neutralizing mono-
clonal antibodies12. In that study, the 3BNC117 and 10-1074 bNAbs 
protected monkeys for a median of 13 and 12.5 weeks, respectively, 
whereas VRC01, possessing lower neutralizing activity against 
SHIV
AD8-EO, blocked infection for a shorter period of time (a median 
of 8 weeks). In addition, the VRC01 monoclonal antibody, carrying 
a two-amino-acid substitution (LS) introduced into its crystalliz-
able fragment domain that increased its serum half-life by two- to 
threefold12,28, was also evaluated. As compared to the unmodified 
VRC01, the VRC01 monoclonal antibody with the LS substitution 
(VRC01-LS) exhibited a longer median protective effect (14.5 ver-
sus 8.0 weeks).
Here we have examined two aspects of anti-HIV-1 immunopro-
phylaxis: (1) the long-term efficacy of the more potent 3BNC117 
or 10-1074 bNAbs with the LS substitution in the crystallizable 
fragment infused individually through the i.v. route; and (2) the 
prevention of virus acquisition via the combination of LS-mutant 
3BNC117 and 10-1074 monoclonal antibodies administered sub-
cutaneously (s.c.). Our results show that a single infusion of the 
10-1074-LS monoclonal antibody protected four of six monkeys 
challenged on a weekly basis for more than 6 months. In addition 
and despite volume limitations (1.0 ml), s.c. combination immu-
noprophylaxis conferred protection in five of six monkeys against 
RLD virus challenge for a median of 20 weeks.

domain–modified antibodies elicits durable 
protection from SHIV infection

In the absence of an effective and safe vaccine against HIV-1, the administration of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) 
represents a logical alternative approach to prevent virus transmission. Here, we introduced two mutations encoding amino 
acid substitutions (M428L and N434S, collectively referred to as ‘LS’) into the genes encoding the crystallizable fragment 
domains of the highly potent HIV-specific 3BNC117 and 10-1074 bNAbs to increase their half-lives and evaluated their efficacy 
in blocking infection following repeated low-dose mucosal challenges of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with the tier 2 
SHIVAD8-EO. A single intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS monoclonal antibodies markedly delayed virus acquisition for 18 to 37 
weeks (median, 27 weeks), whereas the protective effect of the 3BNC117-LS bNAb was more modest (provided protection for 
11–23 weeks; median, 17 weeks). Serum concentrations of the 10-1074-LS monoclonal antibody gradually declined and became 
undetectable in all recipients between weeks 26 and 41, whereas the 3BNC117-LS bNAb exhibited a shorter half-life. To model 
immunoprophylaxis against genetically diverse and/or neutralization-resistant HIV-1 strains, a combination of the 3BNC117-LS 
plus 10-1074-LS monoclonal antibodies was injected into macaques via the more clinically relevant subcutaneous route. Even 
though the administered mixture contained an amount of each bNAb that was nearly threefold less than the quantity of the 
single monoclonal antibody in the intravenous injections, the monoclonal antibody combination still protected macaques for a 
median of 20 weeks. The extended period of protection observed in macaques for the 3BNC117-LS plus 10-1074-LS combination 
could translate into an effective semiannual or annual immunoprophylaxis regimen for preventing HIV-1 infections in humans.

Neutralizing potency of the LS-modified monoclonal antibodies. 
To examine the anti-SHIV
AD8-EO neutralizing activity of the native12 
and LS-modified forms of 3BNC117 and 10-1074, we performed 
virus neutralization assays using either pseudotyped (Fig. 1a) 
or replication-competent (Fig. 1b) viruses during infections of 
TZM-bl cells. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) 
of the native and LS-modified forms of the 3BNC117 and 10-1074 
monoclonal antibodies were nearly indistinguishable in the TZM-bl 
pseudovirus assay (0.07 versus 0.09 µ 
g/ml and 0.08 versus 0.08 µ 
g/
ml, respectively). Similarly, assays using replication-competent 
SHIV
AD8-EO showed IC50 values for the native and LS-modified forms 
of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 of 0.11 versus 0.11 µ 
g/ml and 0.09 ver-
sus 0.08 µ 
g/ml, respectively. The corresponding 80% inhibitory 
concentration (IC80) values were 0.24 versus 0.37 µ 
g/ml and 0.15 
versus 0.15 µ 
g/ml for native and LS-modified forms of 3BNC117 
and 10-1074 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. We conclude that 
the LS-modified forms of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 have neutraliza-
tion activities similar to those of the native antibodies in these in 
 
vitro assays.
3BNC117-LS or 10-1074-LS monoclonal antibody adminis-
tration confers long-term protection against repeated muco-
sal SHIV challenges. To determine the protective efficacy of 
3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS monoclonal antibodies in macaques, 
we performed intrarectal (i.r.) RLD challenge experiments. All 
monkeys were inoculated with 10 tissue culture infectious dose 50 
(TCID50) of SHIV
AD8-EO at weekly intervals until they became vire-
mic, as determined through real-time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2a). 
This inoculum size was previously shown to be equivalent to 0.27 
animal infectious dose 50 (AID50)12. Twelve control monkeys, which 
received no monoclonal antibodies, became infected after two 
to six challenges, with a median of three weekly virus exposures 
needed to infect all 12 monkeys (Fig. 2b). The protective efficacy 
of 3BNC117-LS or 10-1074-LS was assessed following a single i.v. 
infusion of each monoclonal antibody (20 mg per kg body weight) 
 
in six monkeys. The macaques were challenged beginning one week 
after bNAb administration, and in addition to levels of viral RNA, 
we measured serum bNAb concentrations, anti-SHIV neutralizing 
titers and anti-bNAb responses.
The LS-modified bNAbs were well tolerated in all 12 monkeys. 
In the six 3BNC117-LS bNAb recipients, 11 to 23 challenges were 
required to establish infection, and the median time to virus acqui-
sition was 17 weeks for this group of monkeys (Fig. 2c). In the case 
of the 10-1074-LS recipients, 18 to 37 virus challenges were needed 
to establish an infection, and the median time to virus acquisition 
was 27 weeks (Fig. 2d). The median times to virus acquisition in 
the recipients of the native 10-1074 and 3BNC117 monoclonal anti-
bodies were 12.5 and 13 weeks, respectively12. Thus, the 10-1074-LS 
bNAb conferred a 2.2-fold increase (12.5 to 27) in the number of chal-
lenges needed to establish an infection compared with the unmodi-
fied 10-1074 monoclonal antibody, whereas the 3BNC117-LS bNAb 
conferred a modest 1.3-fold (13 to 17 challenges) improvement. The 
protective effects of the 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS bNAbs were 
also compared to the control cohort using Kaplan–Meier analysis, 
in which the percentage of macaques remaining uninfected was 
plotted against the number of SHIV
AD8-EO challenges (Fig. 3a). As 
indicated in Fig. 3b, the recipients of 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS 
 
monoclonal antibodies were significantly more resistant to 
SHIV
AD8-EO acquisition than the control monkeys (P = 0.004 and 
0.004, respectively). Furthermore, 10-1074-LS was significantly dif-
ferent from native 10-1074 (P = 0.026), whereas the 3BNC117-LS 
was not statistically different from its native form (P = 0.108).
In vivo protective activity is dependent upon monoclonal anti-
body pharmacokinetics. To determine how LS-modified bNAbs 
in monkey sera relate to protection, we measured the concentra-
tions of these antibodies at various times after administration. 
The serum concentrations of 3BNC117-LS in five of six recipients 
gradually declined and became undetectable between weeks 16 and 
22 following infusion (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 1). One 
3BNC117-LS monoclonal antibody recipient (DFH3), however, 
experienced rapid decay of the administered antibody, and the 
monoclonal antibody concentrations in this monkey declined to 
undetectable levels by week 5 postinfusion. In contrast, none of the 
six macaques infused with the 10-1074-LS bNAb exhibited a rapid 
loss of the administered monoclonal antibodies; bNAbs were mea-
surable until weeks 26–41 in this cohort of monkeys (Fig. 4b and 
Supplementary Table 1). The median serum-neutralizing activities 
of the 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS monoclonal antibodies 1 week 
after infusion were 1:2,538 and 1:9,840, respectively (P = 0.0022, 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Supplementary Fig. 1). These values 
are similar to comparable titers (1:3,248 and 1:7,163) measured 
at 1 week following infusion of the native 3BNC117 and 10-1074 
bNAbs, respectively12. Thus, despite exhibiting similar neutraliza-
tion activities against SHIV
AD8-EO in vitro (Fig. 1), the neutralization 
titers of each bNAb at 1 week following infusion were different from 
one another in vivo, with higher titers measured for native 10-1074 
and 10-1074-LS compared to native 3BNC117 and 3BNC117-LS.
The introduction of the LS-encoding mutations into the gene 
encoding VRC01 extended its serum half-life by two- to three-
fold12,28. The half-life of 3BNC117-LS ranged from 1.5 to 3.2 weeks 
(median, 2.8 weeks), whereas native 3BNC117 had a half-life of 
0.7 to 1.7 weeks (median, 1.4 weeks), as shown in Supplementary 
Table 2. Similarly, the half-life of 10-1074-LS ranged from 3.0 to 
4.9 weeks (median, 3.8 weeks) and the native monoclonal anti-
body exhibited a half-life of 0.6 to 3.2 weeks (median, 1.0 week), as 
shown in Supplementary Table 2. Thus, the LS-encoding mutation 
increased the half-lives of native 3BNC117 and 10-1074 by 2.0- and 
3.8-fold, respectively (P = 
 0.0044 for 3BNC117-LS versus 3BNC117 
and P = 0.0014 for 10-1074-LS versus 10-1074).

bNAb combination immunoprophylaxis prevents SHIV acqui-
sition. In view of the extraordinary genetic diversity of HIV-1, it 
is likely that prophylaxis against HIV-1 in humans will require a 
combination of bNAbs targeting different epitopes on the viral 
envelope. In addition, i.v. antibody administration is far less desir-
able as a means of prophylaxis in humans than injection via the s.c. 
route. To evaluate the protective efficacy of combining bNAbs, we 
administered 3BNC117-LS plus 10-1074-LS monoclonal antibodies 
(7.5 mg per kg body weight of each) in a clinically relevant volume of 
1 ml s.c. to a cohort of six macaques, which were challenged weekly 
with 10 TCID50 of SHIV
AD8-EO, as described above. This monoclonal 
antibody dose was nearly three times lower than that used when 
each bNAb was i.v. administered individually (20 mg per kg body 
weight of each), as described earlier. As shown in Fig. 5a, combina-
tion monoclonal antibody prophylaxis conferred protection for 15 
to 24 challenges in five of the six recipients. One monkey (DFM6) 
became infected after only six i.r. challenges. The median time to 
virus acquisition for the entire cohort was 20 weeks (P = 0.004 com-
pared to untreated controls, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 5b).
The concentrations of the 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS mono-
clonal antibodies in sera from individual macaques were deter-
mined longitudinally (Fig. 5c,d). The serum concentrations of 
3BNC117-LS monoclonal antibody declined to undetectable levels 
between 5 and 9 weeks in all but one of the six recipients (Fig. 5d 
and Supplementary Table 3). The sixth monkey, DFD7, maintained 
measurable concentrations of the 3BNC117-LS monoclonal anti-
body until week 18 following s.c. administration. In contrast, the 
10-1074-LS bNAb gradually declined in five of the six monkeys and 
was detected in circulation until weeks 18–27 post administration 
in all five of these monkeys (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 3). 
One macaque (DFM6) experienced rapid loss of both monoclonal 
antibodies and became infected after six weekly challenges (Fig. 5a).

The pattern of anti-HIV-1 serum neutralizing titers in recipients of 
the 3BNC117-LS plus 10-1074-LS monoclonal antibody mixture 
paralleled the serum concentrations of the 10-1074-LS monoclonal 
antibody, but not that of the 3BNC117-LS monoclonal antibody, in 
this macaque cohort (compare Supplementary Fig. 2 with Fig. 5c,d). 
Taken together, these results show that the 10-1074-LS monoclonal 
antibody was solely responsible for the protection of five of the six 
macaques after week 7.
Monoclonal antibody concentration and neutralization activity 
predict the probability of infection. We used probit regression 
analysis to estimate an S-shaped curve that describes the per-chal-
lenge probability of infection as a function of the serum monoclonal 
antibody concentration (Supplementary Tables 1 and 3). The esti-
mated probit curve for these studies is shown in Fig. 6a. Likelihood 
ratio tests indicated that the same probit curve could be applied for 
each of the following monoclonal antibodies: native 3BNC117 and 
3BNC117-LS; native 10-1074 and 10-1074-LS; and the 3BNC117-LS 
plus 10-1074-LS combination. Thus, a given amount of monoclonal 
antibody from any of the five types evaluated predicted the same 
per-challenge infection probability. The serum monoclonal anti-
body concentration, corresponding to a per-challenge infection 
probability of 1%, was calculated to be 2.67 μ 
g/ml (95% confidence 
interval, 1.85–3.48 for all of the monoclonal antibodies evaluated). 
As shown in Fig. 6b, the median monoclonal antibody serum con-
centrations at breakthrough of infection were calculated to be 0.13 
and 1.07 μ 
g/ml for native 10-1074 and 10-1074-LS, respectively; 
0.20 and 0.28 μ 
g/ml for native 3BNC117 and 3BNC117-LS, respec-
tively; and 0.67 μ 
g/ml for the bNAb combination. The slightly 
higher breakthrough plasma bNAb concentration observed for the 
10-1074-LS monoclonal antibody (1.07 μ 
g/ml) compared to the 
three other individual bNAbs analyzed in Fig. 6b cannot be pres-
ently explained despite the similar potencies of these antibodies 
when measured in vitro (Fig. 1). Perhaps this difference reflects 
currently unknown variables affecting bNAb activity in vivo that 
are not operative in vitro.
The protective efficacy of different serum antibody concentra-
tions, relative to the per-challenge risk of infection, was also deter-
mined. Antibody efficacy was defined as 100% × ((1 – (per-challenge 
infection probability at a given antibody concentration)) / (per-
challenge infection probability with no antibody)) (see statistical 
analysis in the Methods for details). The antibody efficacies were 
97% (95% confidence interval, 92–100%) and 61% (95% confidence 
interval, 49–77%) for all of the wild-type and crystallizable frag-
ment domain–modified 3BNC117 and 10-1074 bNAbs used in this 
study at serum concentrations of 3.0 and 1.0 μ 
g/ml, respectively.
Anti-antibody responses against human monoclonal antibodies 
can cause their rapid decay in macaques. Macaque recipients of 
human anti-HIV-1 bNAbs variably produce anti-antibodies that

are associated with accelerated bNAb clearance, and in prevention 
experiments, this leads to virus acquisition12. In the current study, 
one monkey (DFH3), in the cohort of six 3BNC117-LS monoclo-
nal antibody recipients, developed anti-antibodies at 3 to 4 weeks 
after infusion and experienced a decline of bNAb concentrations to 
undetectable levels by week 5 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 3a). 
The most striking example of anti-antibody production occurred 
in the bNAb combination experiment, where four of six monkeys 
developed specific anti-3BNC117-LS antibodies after 4 to 6 weeks, 
and one of these macaques (DFM6) also produced anti-antibodies 
to the 10-1074-LS component of the mixture in a similar time frame 
(Supplementary Fig. 3c,d). As expected, the generation of anti-
antibodies against both 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS monoclonal 
antibodies in monkey DFM6 was associated with a rapid decline of 
both serum bNAb concentrations (Fig. 5c,d) and measurable neu-
tralization titers in this animal (Supplementary Fig. 2), resulting in 
the establishment of infection.
Discussion
The most striking result obtained in this study is the long period 
of protective efficacy conferred by a single injection of crystalliz-
able fragment domain–modified human anti-HIV-1 neutralizing 
antibodies in macaques compared to that previously reported12. 
A single i.v. infusion of the 10-1074-LS bNAb protected a cohort 
of six monkeys for up to 8.5 months (18–37 weeks). The introduc-
tion of the LS substitution into 10-1074 lengthened the median time 
until SHIV
AD8-EO acquisition from 12.5 to 27 weeks. The adminis-
tered 10-1074-LS bNAb was measurable in the serum for 26–41 
weeks and had a calculated half-life of 3.8 weeks.
The effects of LS on 3BNC117 were more modest than those 
on 10-1074 and were consistent with a shorter half-life (2.6 ver-
sus 3.8 weeks), a smaller increase in half-life (2- versus 3.8-fold) 
and a lower initial serum concentration (Supplementary Table 2). 
These observations are also entirely in accordance with the obser-
vation that native 3BNC117 has a shorter half-life than 10-1074 in 
humans (17 versus 24 d)22,23. This difference in pharmacokinetics 
notwithstanding, a serum concentration of 2.68 μ 
g/ml for either 
LS-modified bNAb derivative was calculated to protect 99% of the 
macaque recipients.
We tested combination immunoprophylaxis via the s.c. route, 
employing the 3BNC117-LS plus 10-1074-LS monoclonal anti-
bodies, which target different gp120 epitopes, to model potential 
exposure to genetically diverse and/or resistant HIV-1 strains. 
Unexpectedly, four of six of these monkeys developed high titers 
of anti-3BNC117-LS antibodies within 5–9 weeks of administra-
tion, which resulted in the rapid elimination of this monoclonal 
antibody. This loss of the 3BNC117-LS component of the bNAb 
combination could be viewed as the biological equivalent of the pre-
viously reported emergence of viral variants resistant to an admin-
istered anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibody20,23,26,27,29,30. Nonetheless, 
the inclusion of 10-1074-LS in the administered bNAb combina-
tion resulted in the maintenance of neutralizing activity in serum 
for several months, prevented the establishment of a virus infec-
tion for an additional 6–14 weeks and was solely responsible for the

observed protection (median, 20 weeks) in this cohort of SHIV
AD8-EO 
-challenged macaques.
Development of anti-antibodies against the administered human 
bNAbs in macaques was not unexpected. In fact, bNAb concentra-
tions and neutralization titers invariably declined in 15 of the 24 
monkeys infused with 3BNC117-LS and/or 10-1074-LS monoclo-
nal antibodies when anti-bNAb titers exceeded a titer of 1:1,000 
(Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). Although the generation of such anti-
bodies will always remain a problem in the context of monkey recip-
ients of human monoclonal antibodies, it is highly unlikely that a 
cross-species immune response of this frequency and potency and 
the attending rapid clearance of administered bNAbs will occur in 
humans. In this regard, two recent clinical studies have reported 
that VRC01 administered to healthy human adults failed to elicit 
detectable anti-antibodies24,25, and 3BNC117 and 10-1074 showed 
stable pharmacokinetics in humans after repeated dosing over a 
period of 6 months (data not shown).
Before the development of an effective vaccine against hepatitis 
A virus, pre-exposure immunoprophylaxis through administering 
immunoglobulin intramuscularly was common practice and con-
ferred protection for 3–5 months31. In the absence of an effective 
HIV vaccine or the development of one in the immediate future, 
it is not unreasonable to contemplate a similar use of crystallizable 
fragment domain–modified anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies, such 
as those described in this report, which, in the case of 10-1074-LS 
bNAb, conferred protection in macaques against SHIV
AD8-EO for 
more than 6 months.
Although this study reports a promising preclinical result rel-
evant to HIV-1 prevention, it must be remembered that to be clini-
cally effective for immunoprophylaxis, bNAbs must be capable of 
preventing the acquisition of genetically diverse populations of the 
virus, not a molecularly cloned SHIV expressing a single envelope 
protein. The planned extension of the LS-modified bNAb results 
reported here to humans in a phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics of 3BNC117-LS administered to groups of indi-
viduals with and without HIV infections thus represents the next 
step in this process (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/; NCT03254277).

Rhesus monkeys. Thirty rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) of Indian genetic 
origin, 2–4 years of age, were housed and cared for in accordance with Guide for 
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals Report no. NIH 82-53 (Department of Health 
and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland, 1985) in a biosafety level 2 NIH facility. 
All animal procedures and experiments were performed according to protocols 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, NIH. Monkeys were not randomized, 
and the data were not collected in a blinded manner. The macaques used in this 
study did not express the MHC class I Mamu-A*01, Mamu-B*08 and Mamu-B*17 
alleles. No monkeys were excluded from the analysis. Nine of the twelve control 
monkeys and recipients of the native 3BNC117 (n = 6) and 10-1074 (n = 6) bNAbs 
were reported in a previous study12. Blood was drawn regularly to monitor viral 
infection, passively transferred monoclonal antibody concentrations and serum 
neutralizing activity.
Monoclonal antibodies. The 3BNC117 monoclonal antibody is a recombinant, 
fully human IgG1 λ 
 antibody recognizing the CD4-binding site on the HIV-1 
gp120 envelope5. This antibody was cloned from an HIV-1-infected viremic 
controller in the International HIV Controller Study5,32, and the mutations 
encoding the LS substitution were introduced to the heavy chain–encoding 
gene of 3BNC117 bNAb through site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmids encoding 
the heavy and light chain genes were transiently cotransfected and expressed in 
Chinese hamster ovary cells (clone 5D5-5C10), and supernatant was purified 
using standard methods. The resulting purified monoclonal antibody, designated 
3BNC117-LS, was used for i.v. and s.c. injections of macaques. 10-1074 is a 
recombinant, fully human IgG1 λ 
 monoclonal antibody recognizing the base of the 
gp120 V3 loop and surrounding glycans on the HIV-1 envelope protein8. The  
10-1074 monoclonal antibody was cloned from an African donor (patient 10) 
infected with an HIV-1 clade A virus33. LS-encoding mutations were introduced 
into the heavy chain–encoding gene of 10-1074, expressed in Chinese hamster 
ovary cells (clone 3G4), and the purified bNAb, designated 10-1074-LS, was 
used in the study. A single dose (20 mg per kg body weight) of each monoclonal 
antibody was infused i.v. to individual monkeys.
To model immunoprophylaxis via the more clinically relevant s.c. route, 
a bNAb combination, which included both 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS 
monoclonal antibodies (7.5 mg per kg body weight of each), in a total volume of 
1 ml, was administered s.c. into the medial inner thigh of individual animals using 
a 1-inch, 25-gauge needle.
Virus challenge. The origin and preparation of the tissue-culture-derived 
SHIV
AD8-EO stock has been previously described34; the infectivity of virus stock 
was titrated on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from rhesus 
macaques. SHIV
AD8-EO is an molecularly cloned derivative of SHIV
AD8 that is R5 
tropic and possesses multiple properties typical of pathogenic HIV-1 isolates34–36. 
It exhibits a tier 2 neutralization-sensitivity phenotype, replicates to high levels in 
rhesus macaque PBMCs, generates sustained levels of plasma viremia and causes 
irreversible depletion of CD4+ T cells, resulting in a symptomatic and ultimately 
fatal immunodeficiency associated with opportunistic infections (Mycobacterium 
sp., Pneumocystis sp., Cryptosporidium sp.) in infected monkeys. All animals were 
inoculated through the i.r. route with 10 TCID50 of SHIV
AD8-EO at weekly intervals 
until infection became established. This inoculum size was previously shown to 
be equivalent to 0.27 AID50
12. A pediatric speculum was used to gently open the 
rectum, and a 1-ml suspension of virus in a tuberculin syringe was slowly infused 
into the rectal cavity.
Neutralization antibody assay. The in vitro potency of each monoclonal antibody 
was assessed using two types of neutralization assays: (1) TZM-bl entry assay with 
a pseudotyped virus and (2) TZM-bl infection assay using a replication-competent 
virus. The pseudotyped virus expresses the SHIV
AD8-EO envelope antigen and the 
luciferase reporter gene. In the case of the replication-competent virus assay, the 
indinavir protease inhibitor was added to the medium (final concentration of 1 µ 
M) 
 
to prevent a second round of viral replication. Neutralization activity was 
quantitated by the relative decrease in the luciferase activity compared to infection 
of TZM.bl cells in the absence of monoclonal antibodies. Neutralization curves 
were subjected to fitting through nonlinear regression using a five-parameter 
equation using GraphPad Prism. The antibody concentrations required to inhibit 
infection by 50% or 80% are reported as the IC50 or IC80, respectively.
Measurement of 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS monoclonal antibody 
concentrations. Serum concentrations of 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS bNAbs 
were determined using TZM.bl neutralization assays as previously described23. 
Sera were heat-inactivated for 1 h at 56 °C, and neutralizing activity was measured 
against two HIV-1 strains. HIV-1 strain Q769.d22 is highly sensitive to 3BNC117 
but resistant to 10-1074, whereas the X2088_c9 strain is highly sensitive to  
10-1074 but resistant 3BNC117. ID50 values were derived using five-parameter 
curve fitting. Serum concentrations of 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS were 
then calculated through multiplying the respective sera ID50 titers by the IC50 
values. Murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-pseudotyped viruses were used to detect 
nonspecific neutralizing activity in serum, which was excluded from analyses.
Measurement of 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS neutralizing activity. The 
neutralization activity, present in serum samples collected from rhesus macaques 
infused with monoclonal antibodies, was assessed through TZM-bl assay with 
pseudotyped SHIV
AD8
12,16. The IC50 neutralization titer was calculated as the 
dilution of serum causing a 50% reduction in relative luminescence units (RLUs) 
relative to diluted sera from untreated animals. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis. Blood samples were collected before and 
weekly following administration of the bNAbs. Monoclonal antibody serum 
concentrations were determined as described above. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
were estimated by performing a non-compartmental analysis using WinNonlin 6.3.
Anti-antibody responses. ELISAs were performed to evaluate anti-3BNC117-LS  
or anti-10-1074-LS antibody responses in sera collected from macaques 
administered these monoclonal antibodies. ELISA plates (96 well) were coated 
with 3BNC117-LS or 10-1074-LS monoclonal antibodies in PBS (2 µ 
g/ml), 
incubated at 4 °C overnight and blocked with 5% BSA at room temperature for 
1 h. Plates were washed six times with PBS-Tween (PBS-T), and serial, fivefold 
dilutions of serum samples were prepared in 2% BSA. The diluted serum samples 
were added to plates and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, followed by six 
washes of each plate with PBS-Tween. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated 
Fcγ 
-specific anti–human IgG, (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) was added 
for 1 h at room temperature, followed by six washes of each plate with PBS-T. 
Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)–HRP substrate was added to each well, and the 
absorbance developed after adding 0.5 M H2SO4 was measured at 450 nm on a 
EMax Plus Microplate Reader using Softmax Pro 6 software (Molecular Devices, 
CA, US). Blank wells containing assay diluent were used to determine the 
background signal; mean optical density (OD) values exceeding fivefold (ranging 
from 0.26 to 0.29) that of blank wells from each plate were used as cutoff. The 
dilution of each sample above the cutoff value was then calculated. The log values 
of these dilutions were reported as the final endpoint anti-bNAb titers.
Plasma viral RNA quantification. Plasma viral RNA levels were determined 
through modified two-step quantitative reverse transcription using Applied 
Biosystems PCR (ABI Prism 7900HT). Experimental samples were analyzed in 
parallel with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) gag RNA standard; the lower 
limit of detection using this assay was 100 copies/ml.
Cell culture. HEK293T and TZM.bl cells were maintained in the DMEM media 
supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mM l-glutamine and 1 × penicillin–streptomycin. 
Cells were passaged twice a week and incubated at 37 °C, 10% CO2.
Statistical analysis. Between-group comparisons were performed using the 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The relationship between per-challenge infection 
and antibody concentration at the time of challenge was specified by a probit 
regression model: P(infection at challenge) = Φ 
(A + B mAb), where A and B are 
parameters to be estimated; mAb is the actual or imputed antibody concentration 
at the time of the challenge; and Φ 
 is the standard normal cumulative distribution 
function. Because the monoclonal antibody concentrations were missing 
for some challenges, a linear mixed-effects model was fitted to the repeated 
monoclonal antibody readouts. Empirical Bayes–predicted monoclonal antibody 
concentrations were used to impute values for challenges with missing monoclonal 
antibody readouts. ID01 was defined as the antibody concentration resulting in an 
estimated per-challenge probability of infection of 0.01.
Likelihood ratio tests were performed to examine whether the different 
groups of monoclonal antibodies (native-10-1074, 10-1074-LS, native-3BNC117, 
3BNC117-LS and combination of the two LS-modified bNAbs) had different  
slopes and intercepts. For each group, in turn, separate models were fitted to  
allow for a group-specific intercept and a group-specific intercept and slope. 
For each group, likelihood-ratio tests supported the simpler model with a single 
intercept and slope for all groups (P > .05). Additional likelihood-ratio tests were 
performed to confirm that other functions (i.e., log, quadratic) of the infused 
monoclonal antibody did not provide a significantly better prediction. A random-
effects probit model was also assessed, and the variance of the intercept term was 
estimated at zero.
We calculated the reduction in the per-challenge probability of infection for 
a given antibody concentration, as compared to that with no antibody, using 
the formula antibody efficacy = 1 – Φ 
(a + b mAb) / Φ 
(a), where a and b are 
the maximum-likelihood estimates of A and B. The nonparametric bootstrap 
procedure was used to form confidence intervals for ID01 and antibody efficacy.  
All tests are two-sided, and P values less than 0.05 are considered significant.

�    Experimental design
1.   Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
In total, 30 rhesus macaques were used for this study.  12 animals were challenged with 
SHIVAD8 without any prior MAb infusion and served as controls, nine of these twelve control 
monkeys were reported in a previous study {Gautam, R., et al. Nature 533, 105-109 (2016)}. 
18 animals (3 groups of 6 animals) were infused with indicated MAbs followed by intrarectal 
challenges with SHIVAD8. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes.
2.   Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions.
No data  excluded from the study.
3.   Replication
Describe the measures taken to verify the reproducibility 
of the experimental findings.
Yes, we have a rigorous process of doing all in vitro assays at least twice to maintain 
reproducibility. All the attempts at replication were successful and the results were reliably 
reproduced.
4.   Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were 
allocated into experimental groups.
 
No method of randomization was used to determine how animals were allocated to 
experimental groups, which was determined by genotype. Macaques carrying protective 
MHC class 1 alleles (Mamu A*01, B*O8, B*17) were excluded from this study.
5.   Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to 
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
The data collection was not blinded. Blinding was not possible as the investigators were also 
conducting the experiments and had to be aware of controls and treated groups.
Note: all in vivo studies must report how sample size was determined and whether blinding and randomization were used.
