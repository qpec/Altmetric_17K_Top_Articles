Heat stress, an environmental and occupational hazard, is 
associated with a spectrum of heat-related illnesses, including 
heat stroke, which can lead to death. CDC’s National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) publishes rec-
ommended occupational exposure limits for heat stress (1). 
These limits, which are consistent with those of the American 
Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) 
(2), specify the maximum combination of environmental 
heat (measured as wet bulb globe temperature [WBGT]) and 
metabolic heat (i.e., workload) to which workers should be 
exposed. Exposure limits are lower for workers who are unac-
climatized to heat, who wear work clothing that inhibits heat 
dissipation, and who have predisposing personal risk factors 
(1,2). These limits have been validated in experimental set-
tings but not at outdoor worksites. To determine whether the 
NIOSH and ACGIH exposure limits are protective of work-
ers, CDC retrospectively reviewed 25 outdoor occupational 
heat-related illnesses (14 fatal and 11 nonfatal) investigated by 
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
from 2011 to 2016. For each incident, OSHA assessed per-
sonal risk factors and estimated WBGT, workload, and accli-
matization status. Heat stress exceeded exposure limits in all 
14 fatalities and in eight of 11 nonfatal illnesses. An analysis 
of Heat Index data for the same 25 cases suggests that when 
WBGT is unavailable, a Heat Index screening threshold of 
85°F (29.4°C) could identify potentially hazardous levels of 
workplace environmental heat. Protective measures should be 
implemented whenever the exposure limits are exceeded. The 
comprehensive heat-related illness prevention program should 
include an acclimatization schedule for newly hired workers 
and unacclimatized long-term workers (e.g., during early-
season heat waves), training for workers and supervisors about 
symptom recognition and first aid (e.g., aggressive cooling of 
presumed heat stroke victims before medical professionals 
arrive), engineering and administrative controls to reduce heat 
stress, medical surveillance, and provision of fluids and shady 
areas for rest breaks.
OSHA’s Office of Occupational Medicine and Nursing 
receives consultation requests from OSHA area offices to 
address medical questions that arise during OSHA work-
site inspections. A master list of these consultations was 
used to identify 66 heat-related illness consultations during 
2011–2016. Three consultations with missing information, 
32 indoor incidents, and six that occurred near a heat source 
were excluded because accurate retrospective heat exposure 
assessments were not possible. The remaining 25 records 
were reviewed to assess workers’ personal risk factors, heat 
acclimatization status, workload, and clothing. Personal risk 
factors considered in this report were obesity (body mass index 
≥30 kg/m2), diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease, and use

of certain medications (1) and illicit drugs. Workers were 
considered unacclimatized if they had started a new job within 
the preceding 2 weeks or if they had recently returned from an 
absence of >1 week. Workload was classified as light, moder-
ate, heavy, or very heavy, according to ACGIH guidelines (2).
Archived climatologic data (i.e., temperature, humidity, wind 
speed, and sky conditions) were obtained from the nearest 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
weather station. WBGT at the time of each incident was esti-
mated using a validated heat and mass transfer model (3), and 
Heat Index was computed via a standard NOAA algorithm.* 
In cases in which the worker’s clothing likely impaired heat 
dissipation (four), clothing adjustment factors (2) were added 
to the estimated WBGT to determine the effective WBGT 
(WBGT
eff). Total heat stress was compared with the applicable 
NIOSH exposure limit (i.e., the Recommended Exposure 
Limit for acclimatized healthy workers or the Recommended 
Alert Limit for workers who were unacclimatized or had per-
sonal risk factors). The sensitivity of the exposure limits was 
defined as the percentage of cases where heat stress met or 
exceeded the applicable limit.
The sample consisted of 25 heat-related illnesses that 
occurred during outdoor work, 14 (56.0%) of which were 
fatal (Table 1). Approximately half (12 of 25) of workers 
had at least one predisposing personal risk factor. Workload 
was moderate, heavy, or very heavy in 13 of 14 fatalities; the

remaining fatality involved light workload in an unacclimatized 
worker. Estimated WBGT
eff and Heat Index did not differ 
significantly across categories of workload or acclimatiza-
tion status (Table 2). The range of WBGT
eff was 79°F–94°F 
(26.1°C–34.4°C). The sensitivity of the NIOSH exposure 
limits was 100% (14 of 14) for detection of fatal heat stress 
and 72.7% (eight of 11) for detection of conditions that caused 
nonfatal illness.
The median Heat Index was 91°F (33.3°C) and ranged 
from 83°F to 110°F (28.3°C to 43.3°C). The Heat Index was

<91°F (32.8°C) in 12 of 25 cases, including six of 14 fatalities. 
Among workers wearing a single layer of normal clothing (21), 
the minimum Heat Index was 85°F (29.4°C), and four of nine 
nonfatal illnesses and four of 12 fatalities occurred when the 
Heat Index was between 85°F (29.4°C) and 90°F (32.2°C).
Discussion
Because WBGT incorporates four environmental factors 
(air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and radia-
tion [often sunlight]) that contribute to heat stress, it is the 
recommended workplace environmental heat metric. In 2016, 
NIOSH reiterated this recommendation in an updated publi-
cation that defines WBGT-based occupational exposure limits 
(1). The limits were derived from human experiments and 
have high sensitivity for detecting unsustainable heat stress in 
laboratory settings (4). However, few data have documented 
the effectiveness of the exposure limits in real-life situations (1). 
The current report partially fills this data gap. In this analysis, 
the exposure limits had 100% sensitivity for identifying fatal 
levels of heat stress in outdoor industries. This result suggests 
that the recommended limits are sufficiently protective of 
most workers.
Heat Index is an “apparent” temperature that combines 
humidity and air temperature to quantify what the conditions 
“feel like” to the human body. Heat Index was designed for 
the general public, based on algorithms that assume a person 
is wearing light clothing and walking in a shaded area with a 
light breeze (5). Heat Index does not account for the effects 
of direct sunlight, stagnant air, work clothing, and strenuous 
activities. Employers often obtain Heat Index information from 
publicly broadcasted weather reports or forecasts that do not 
necessarily reflect conditions at their worksites. These limita-
tions preclude Heat Index from supplanting WBGT as the 
occupational gold standard. Nonetheless, at outdoor worksites 
where WBGT is unavailable, Heat Index is sometimes used 
to estimate environmental heat. This study demonstrates that 
workers wearing normal clothing are at risk for heat-related 
illness when Heat Index is ≥85°F (29.4°C). Whenever the Heat 
Index is ≥85°F, employers should exercise extra vigilance and 
implement additional precautions (Box), which could include 
a more accurate WBGT-based environmental heat assessment.
Current occupational Heat Index guidance might not be 
sufficiently protective. For example, although OSHA does not 
have an enforceable permissible exposure limit for heat stress, 
OSHA guidance states that a Heat Index of <91°F (32.8°C) is

associated with “lower” risk of heat-related illness unless other 
factors (e.g., direct sun, little air movement, strenuous work-
load, or nonbreathable clothing) are present (6). However, six 
of 14 deaths in this report occurred when the Heat Index was 
<91°F. Additional evidence supports the possibility of serious 
illness when the Heat Index is <91°F. Fourteen percent of mod-
erate to severe heat-related illnesses at a U.S. military training 
installation (7) and at least 25% of heat-related illnesses in 
Washington agriculture and forestry workers (8) occurred when 
the Heat Index was <90°F (32.2°C). Some employer reports of 
heat-related hospitalizations to OSHA’s Severe Injury Reports 
database (9) have been associated with a Heat Index of <80°F 
(26.7°C). A recent mathematical analysis demonstrated that 
the NIOSH exposure limits can be exceeded when the Heat 
Index exceeds 85°F (29.4°C) (10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, some workers’ acclimatization status, workload, or 
clothing might have been misclassified. For example, all work-
ers with >2 weeks of job tenure were considered acclimatized, 
but during early-season heat waves, some long-term workers 
might have been unacclimatized to heat. Second, local environ-
mental heat at worksites might have differed from meteorologic 
data obtained from the nearest NOAA weather station. Third, 
the WBGT estimation algorithm was subject to small (<1°C) 
random errors (3) and, in some cases, to uncertainties because 
of reliance on cloud cover as a surrogate for solar radiation mea-
surements. Finally, there was an inability, possibly attributable 
to the study’s sample size, to detect differences in environmental 
heat between groups stratified by workload or acclimatization 
status. Future research could expand upon the findings in this 
report to define Heat Index-based occupational exposure limits 
that account for physical activity and acclimatization.
As part of a comprehensive program to prevent heat-related 
illnesses, employers should measure heat stress throughout 
the workday, preferably by using WBGT, and take actions to 
prevent exposure limits from being exceeded. When WBGT 
is unavailable, a Heat Index threshold of 85°F (29.4°C) could 
be used to screen for hazardous workplace environmental heat. 
The comprehensive heat-related illness prevention program 
should also include an acclimatization schedule for newly hired 
workers and unacclimatized long-term workers (e.g., during 
early-season heat waves), training for workers and supervisors 
about symptom recognition and first aid (e.g., aggressive cool-
ing of presumed heat stroke victims before medical profession-
als arrive), engineering and administrative controls to reduce 
heat stress, medical surveillance, and provision of fluids and 
shady areas for rest breaks (1).

BOX. Protective measures to prevent occupational heat-related 
illnesses
• Train supervisors and workers about heat-related signs, 
symptoms, and first aid.
• Designate someone to monitor heat conditions and 
oversee protective measures.
• Provide extra protection for new workers until their 
bodies acclimatize to heat.
• Schedule frequent breaks in a cooler location (e.g., 
shade or air conditioning).
• Use validated tools, such as CDC’s National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health exposure limits, 
to assess workplace heat stress.
• Adjust schedules and workload to stay below 
established heat stress limits.
• Recognize that lower heat stress limits are needed for 
new workers, those with predisposing conditions, 
those who perform heavy physical activity, and those 
who wear hot clothing.
• Provide water or electrolyte-containing beverages.
• Comply with applicable state workplace heat regulations.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Recommended heat stress occupational exposure limits are 
based primarily on wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), 
workload, and acclimatization status. These limits have not been 
validated at outdoor worksites.
What is added by this report?
Among 25 outdoor occupational heat-related illnesses, 
WBGT-based occupational exposure limits were exceeded for all 
14 fatalities and for eight of 11 nonfatal illnesses. Six fatalities 
occurred when the Heat Index was <91°F (32.8°C).
What are the implications for public health practice?
Whenever heat stress exceeds occupational exposure limits, 
workers should be protected by acclimatization programs, training 
about symptom recognition and first aid, and provision of rest 
breaks, shade, and water. A Heat Index of 85°F (29.4°C) could be 
used as a screening threshold to prevent heat-related illness.
