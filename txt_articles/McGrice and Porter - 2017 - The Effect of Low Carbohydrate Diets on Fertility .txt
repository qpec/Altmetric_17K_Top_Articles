Abstract: (1) Background: Medical interventions including assisted reproductive technologies have
improved fertility outcomes for many sub-fertile couples. Increasing research interest has investigated
the effect of low carbohydrate diets, with or without energy restriction. We aimed to systematically
review the published literature to determine the extent to which low carbohydrate diets can affect
fertility outcomes; (2) Methods: The review protocol was registered prospectively with Prospective
Register for Systematic Reviews (registration number CRD42016042669) and followed Preferred
Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Infertile women were the
population of interest, the intervention was low carbohydrate diets (less than 45% total energy
from carbohydrates), compared to usual diet (with or without co-treatments). Four databases were
searched from date of commencement until April 2016; a supplementary Google scholar search
was also undertaken. Title and abstract, then full text review, were undertaken independently and
in duplicate. Reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews were checked to
ensure that all relevant studies were identified for inclusion. Quality assessment was undertaken
independently by both authors using the Quality Criteria Checklist for Primary Research. Outcome
measures were improved fertility outcomes defined by an improvement in reproductive hormones,
ovulation rates and/or pregnancy rates; (3) Results: Seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and
were included in the evidence synthesis. Interventions were diverse and included a combination
of low carbohydrate diets with energy deficit or other co-treatments. Study quality was rated as
positive for six studies, suggesting a low risk of bias, with one study rated as neutral. Of the six
studies which reported changes in reproductive hormones, five reported significant improvements
post intervention; (4) Conclusion: The findings of these studies suggest that low carbohydrate diets
warrant further research to determine their effect. These randomised controlled trials should consider
the effect of carbohydrates (with or without energy deficit) on hormonal and fertility outcomes.

1. Introduction
It has been suggested that approximately 7% of women of reproductive age have some form of
sub-fertility [1,2]. Pre-conception weight is one of the major risk factors for fertility outcomes and it is
well accepted that weight loss improves fertility in overweight and obese women [3–5]. Women with a

body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2 are classed as being clinically obese [6] and have natural menstrual
cycle disruptions at a rate of almost three times higher than women of a healthy weight [5]. A positive
relationship also exists between pre-conception body mass index and the time needed to fall pregnant
in women who are overweight and obese [5].
Carrying excess weight prior to conception can be an obstacle for obese women in getting pregnant,
resulting in many women looking to healthcare professionals for assistance. Many overweight women
who struggle with fertility have co-morbidities such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) which
poses additional challenges to fertility in itself due to disturbances in insulin resistance, sex-steroid
metabolism and menstrual cycles. It has been estimated that 75% of infertile overweight or obese
women have PCOS [7].
Although assisted reproductive technology such as in vitro fertilisation can provide an
opportunity for these women and other sub-fertile couples to conceive, it is not a failsafe option.
A retrospective cohort study conducted by Moragianni and colleagues showed that obese women
have 68% lower odds of having a live birth following their first assisted reproductive therapy cycle
compared to non-obese women [8]. Furthermore, obesity is related to a need for higher doses of assisted
reproductive therapy medications, more frequent cycle cancellations and lower rates of efficacy at
each stage of the in vitro fertilisation process [8]. It is well documented in the literature that weight
loss can improve fertility and pregnancy outcomes, particularly involving in vitro fertilisation [9,10].
The benefits to this patient cohort include more regular menstrual cycles, better quality embryos
available for transfer, less dosage requirement for medications and the need for fewer treatment cycles.
Moreover, weight loss of as little as 5%–10% can be significant in improving hormonal imbalances,
reducing rates of spontaneous abortions and miscarriages [1,2].
Pre-pregnancy weight loss has historically been centred on the traditional low fat, energy restricted
diet plan. However the use of very low energy diets and low carbohydrate diets are increasingly
being used to illicit more favourable weight loss and fertility outcomes. Low carbohydrate diets
are those where less than 45% of macronutrients come from carbohydrates with or without an
energy deficit [11]. A meta-analysis of overweight or obese adults with metabolic syndrome by
Hu and colleagues found that low carbohydrate diets achieved comparable improvements in waist
circumference, total-cholesterol, fasting glucose and serum insulin to low fat diets. Furthermore, low
carbohydrate diets resulted in greater improvements in weight, high density lipoprotein cholesterol
and triglycerides [11]. Concerns have been raised regarding the health effects of following low
carbohydrate diets for long periods [12–14], however within particular clinical populations and for
defined periods there may be benefits.
This review aimed to systematically synthesise the published literature to determine the extent to
which low carbohydrate diets can affect fertility outcomes.
2. Materials and Methods
This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [15] and the protocol was prospectively registered with
Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number CRD42016042669).
In a deviation from the published protocol, authors extended the comparator to enable a broader
interpretation of the literature.
2.1. Eligibility Criteria
Criteria for study inclusion were developed using the Population—Intervention—Comparator—
Outcomes format [16].
Overweight or obese infertile women were the population of interest,
determined as a body mass index of ≥25 kg/m2 [6]. The intervention studied was low carbohydrate
diets, defined as diets which comprised of less than 45% total energy obtained from carbohydrates,
compared to usual diet (with or without co-treatments). Outcome measures were improved fertility
outcomes defined by an improvement in reproductive hormones, ovulation rates and/or pregnancy

rates. Original prospective research was eligible, but systematic reviews, commentaries and conference
abstracts were excluded.
2.2. Search Strategy
The search terms were determined through exploration of key words used in the relevant literature
and refined after consultation with a librarian with health science expertise. The subject headings and
phrases were searched to ensure maximum retrievals. The search strategy focused on the population
and intervention of interest. Outcomes were not defined within the search strategy, instead these were
a focus of the title and abstract review.
Search terms used were as follows: “Diet, carbohydrate-restricted”, “low carbohydrate diet”, “low
carbohydrate*”, “low carb“, “low carbs“, “carbohydrate restricted“, “ketogenic diet“, “ketogenic“,
“ketosis“, “ketogenesis“, “very low energy diet“, “VLED“, “very low calorie diet“and “VLCD“.
These terms were combined with “fertility“, “fertilisation“, “fertile“, “infertility“, “infertile”,
”fecundity”, ”fecundability”, “conceive”, “conception“, “pregnancy“ and “pregnant“. Animal studies
were excluded.
Study identification commenced by electronic searching from earliest available time until
April, 2016, using CINAHL (from 1937), Ovid Medline (from 1946), Embase (from 1947) and the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from 1991). No language exclusions were applied.
A supplementary internet search was undertaken within Google Scholar to identify any studies
that may have been missed through database searching. The search terms used were: “fertility and
ketosis”, “fertility and VLED” and “fertility and low carbohydrate”. Reference lists of included
studies and relevant systematic reviews were reviewed to ensure that the maximum number of studies
were included.
2.3. Study Selection
A title and abstract, then full text review of search retrievals was conducted by both authors
against the inclusion criteria. Full texts were obtained of twenty papers. Once each reviewer completed
the assessment any differences were discussed and resolved by consensus. At the completion of the
full text review, the reference lists of included studies were reviewed to ensure that all eligible papers
had been identified for the final library.
2.4. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
A template was developed to extract data relating to participants, study duration, cause of
infertility, study design, intervention, comparators and fertility outcome measures (impact upon
reproductive hormones, ovulation rate and pregnancy rates). When an outcome measure was only
reported by a single study (such as leptin [3]) data were not extracted. Data were extracted by one
author and checked by a second author.
Both authors independently rated study quality using the Quality Criteria Checklist for Primary
Research [17]. This tool includes criteria that are associated with decreased bias and improved validity
in primary research and is specific for studies in the field of nutrition and dietetics. Ratings of negative
(weak quality; does not adequately address inclusion/exclusion, bias, generalisability, data collection
and analysis), neutral (neither exceptionally strong, nor exceptionally weak quality) or positive (strong
quality; adequately addresses inclusion/exclusion, bias, generalisability, data collection and analysis)
were assigned, with consensus obtained through discussion. Where details were not provided or
authors considered an “unsure” response for specific aspects within each validity question, a final
response of “no” was made.
2.5. Analysis
Eligible studies were grouped according to the outcome measures and results were described
narratively, with a greater emphasis placed on findings from studies achieving high-quality ratings.

The mean and standard deviation or standard error of the mean were reported for each fertility
outcome. Data were estimated from graphs where necessary. Due to the heterogeneity of study
designs, interventions and outcomes, a meta-analysis was not undertaken.
3. Results
Six hundred and forty-five papers were identified through database and internet searching and
reference checking. With the removal of duplicates and animal studies, 62 studies were included
for title and abstract review (Figure 1). No previous systematic reviews on this research question
were located.

Twenty studies were reviewed in full text, with seven studies identified that fulfilled the inclusion
criteria for this review (Table 1). The included studies were small to moderate trials ranging from 11 to
96 participants. The researchers used a variety of study designs including two arm pre/post [18,19],
matched control trial [20], randomised controlled trial [3,21] and randomised parallel studies [22,23].
All studies were conducted within the last fifteen years. The studies were undertaken by four groups
of researchers from the USA, Italy or Australia, with intervention periods ranging from one month [21]
to six months [18,22]. The participants in all studies, except Sim et al. trial had PCOS [3].

Included studies all utilised a diet of less than 45% of total energy obtained from carbohydrates.
Approaches to dietary interventions varied considerably and included: ketogenic diets of less than
20 grams of carbohydrate per day with ad libitum energy intake [18], a very low energy diet with
34% carbohydrates [3], prescriptive energy restricted diets with 40% carbohydrates [20,21,23], and
45% carbohydrate diets with an energy deficit [19,22]. A variation was also seen in the control groups,
where usual diet may have had restricted energy (to match the energy intake of the intervention group),
or other co-treatment.
3.1. Study Quality
Table 2 shows that six studies (85%) were rated as positive, suggesting a low risk of bias [3,19–23].
One study was assessed as neutral quality as it was a two arm pre/post study instead of a randomised
control trial and it was unclear whether or not subjects, clinicians and/or investigators were
blinded [18]. The length of the intervention period in some studies may have limited hormone
and fertility outcomes.

Six of the seven studies assessed changes in reproductive hormones [18–23] with all studies except
Stamets and colleagues reporting significant improvements (p < 0.05). Mavropoulos (2005), Moran
(2003), Palomba (2008) and Palomba (2010) all reported significant improvements in fasting insulin and
testosterone, and although Thomson and colleagues reported an improvement in testosterone, their
results were not significant [18–20,22]. Stamets and colleagues reported an improvement in insulin and
testosterone compared to baseline data, but the improvement was not significant compared to their
comparator [21]. Moran (2003), Palomba (2008), Palomba (2010) and Thomson (2008) all investigated
sex hormone binding globule and free androgen index, and all noted significant improvements
with increased production of sex hormone binding globule and a consequential lowering of the free
androgen index (p < 0.05) [19,20,22,23]. Moran (2003), Palomba (2008), Palomba (2010) and Thomson
(2008) also investigated fasting glucose, and although all studies reported improvements, only
Thomson and colleagues results were statistically significant [20,22,23]. Stamets et al. 2004 investigated
glucose using a glucose tolerance test but did not find a statistically significant improvement compared
to the usual energy restricted diet [21]. Stamets and colleagues (2004) also reported follicle stimulating
hormone and luteinizing hormone and again reported no statistically significant difference between
their invention and control group findings [21]. Conversely, Moran (2003) and colleagues reported the
luteinizing hormone/follicle stimulating hormone ratio and noted a significant improvement result in
their intervention group [20].
Four of the seven studies reported menstrual cyclicity, frequency of menses and/or ovulation
rates [19,20,22,23]. All of these studies illustrated a significant improvement in menstrual cyclicity
and/or ovulation rates with a low carbohydrate diet. Palomba et al. demonstrated an improvement in
mensus frequency and ovulation rates compared to the start of the intervention, but the results were
not as significant as the usual diet plus structured exercise training [19]. The follow up study, found
a significant improvement in ovulation rates (p = 0.020) between the control group who followed
their usual diet plus clomiphene citrate, and the intervention group who followed a structured
exercise program, clomiphene citrate and a 45% carbohydrate diet [22]. Moran and colleagues found a
significant improvement in menstrual cyclicity with a 6000 kilojoule energy restricted diet [20]. Of the
fourteen women following the low carbohydrate diet, four had an improvement in menstrual cyclicity,
one amenorrheic subject had an improvement in ovulation and another amenhorrheic subject had a
resumption of menses (42% improved menstrual cyclicity) [20]. Thomson and colleagues demonstrated
a 21.4% improvement in menstrual cyclicity with a 5000–6000 kilojoule 40% carbohydrate diet [23].
Four studies reported pregnancy outcomes, with three of the four demonstrating improved
pregnancy rates in the intervention group [3,18–20]. Of the five women who completed the intervention
of less than 20 grams carbohydrates per day, two became pregnant (40%) [18]. A study by Moran
and colleagues achieved two pregnancies with a 6000 kilojoule, 40% carbohydrate diet, but only one
pregnancy in the control group with a 6000 kilojoule, 55% carbohydrate diet [20]. Palomba et al.
achieved two pregnancies in twenty infertile women (10%) after commencing women on a 45%
carbohydrate diet with an 800 kilocalorie (3300 kilojoule/day) deficit [19]. However, this was less
than the control group who ate their usual diet, but commenced three structured exercise sessions per
week, which resulted in seven pregnancies (35%) [19]. Sim and colleagues (2014) achieved thirteen
pregnancies out of twenty-seven women in their intervention group (48%) with three of the thirteen
being unassisted, which was statistically significant compared to a total of three assisted pregnancies
(13%) in their control group [3].
4. Discussion
Effective, evidence-based strategies for optimising fertility are essential. This review aimed
to identify and synthesise the evidence relating to the effect of low carbohydrate diets on fertility
hormones and outcomes in overweight and obese women. There is convincing evidence that reducing
carbohydrate load can reduce circulating insulin levels, improve hormonal imbalance and result in a
resumption of ovulation to improve pregnancy rates. To this end, the findings of this review suggest
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 204
9 of 11
that low carbohydrate diets may optimise fertility in some clinical groups, particularly for overweight
and obese women with PCOS. At this stage there is no clear indication about whether low carbohydrate
diets are as effective in overweight women without PCOS as only one study was found investigating
this intervention with this patient group [3].
Findings of this systematic review support other literature on this topic. A prospective study
of 18,555 women by Chavarro and colleagues also found that the quality of carbohydrate in the
diet impacted the risk of ovulatory infertility with a 78% greater risk for women with higher
carbohydrate consumption [9]. Numerous studies have shown that low carbohydrate diets not only
elicit fast and significant weight loss but also reduce serum insulin, consequently improving insulin
sensitivity [24,25]. The biochemical cascade which follows promotes a more favourable hormonal
balance, with a reduction in free testosterone and increase in sex hormone binding globulin which can
be associated with an improvement of menstrual function and fertility. The two-fold benefits of weight
loss and improved hormonal balance also improve the clinical results for women with and without
PCOS ultimately improving fertility [26]. However, it is important to note that energy restriction may
be more salient than the macronutrient profile [27].
Furthermore, it is unclear how low in carbohydrates the diet should be or how long the diet should
be maintained for optimal fertility outcomes. A small prospective study by Tsagareli et al. (2006) using
meal replacements found that the six women who completed the study had less oocytes collected at
the time of in vitro fertilisation after taking meal replacements than beforehand, even though they lost
significant amounts of weight [28]. Unfortunately no pregnancies were achieved. As ketogenic diets,
and very low energy diets in particular have been found to improve metabolic and hormonal variables
in overweight and obese women, the study authors hypothesised that this effect may be a result of
ketosis impacting upon oocyte quality [28]. Conversely, the study by Sim et al. using very low energy
diets analysed in this review, found positive results on fertility [3]. A systematic review on the effect of
weight loss on fertility noted that although using very low energy diets increased fertility outcomes,
results were not as high as those seen in lifestyle interventions [5]. Kulak and Polotsky (2013) argue that
there is scientific plausibility that a ketogenic diet should enhance fertility in certain populations [1].
However, one of the common criticisms about low carbohydrate diets is often that they result in
weight regain [25]. A pattern of significant weight loss followed by a period of slight weight-regain is
often utilised to optimise fertility in dairy cows [29]; a practice known as “flushing” which is used to
improve the fecundity of farm animals. This pattern of a period of weight loss, followed by a period
of weight regain was also found to demonstrate a positive impact on reproduction in women [20].
Consequently, it is recommended that more research be undertaken into the duration, timing and
benefits of refeeding of women on low carbohydrate diets to best optimise fertility.
A particular strength of this review is that there were no time or language restrictions placed
on the search strategy. Limitations include that there is no consensus in the literature to define
“low carbohydrate”; the decision was made for a cut-off of 45% carbohydrate within this review.
Furthermore, this review identified only one study for overweight women with non-PCOS related
infertility, reinforcing the paucity of research in this area.
Additional research into the impact
of low carbohydrate diets on overweight women who don’t have PCOS would add weight to
these findings. A further limitation of this study was the inconsistent reporting of exercise and/or
behavioural interventions as co-treatments, so they have not been explicitly reported in this review.
Randomised controlled trials investigating the optimum amount of carbohydrate (as a percentage
of energy or maximum amount, with or without energy deficit) and timing of the intervention in
relation to attempted pregnancy would also provide valuable progress in our understanding of this
dietary approach.
5. Conclusions
This review found that reducing carbohydrate load can reduce circulating insulin levels, improve
hormonal imbalance and resume ovulation to improve pregnancy rates compared to usual diet.

However, there has been a lack of research on the benefit of low carbohydrate diets for non-PCOS
related infertile women. In view of the increasing number of overweight women struggling to fall
pregnant, there is need for further research in this area.
