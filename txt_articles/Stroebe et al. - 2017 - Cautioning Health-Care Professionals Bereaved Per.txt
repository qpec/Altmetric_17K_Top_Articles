Misguided Through
the Stages of Grief

Abstract
Science and practice seem deeply stuck in the so-called stage theory of grief. Health-
care professionals continue to ‘‘prescribe’’ stages. Basically, this perspective endorses
the idea that bereaved people go through a set pattern of specific reactions over time
following the death of a loved one. It has frequently been interpreted prescriptively,
as a progression that bereaved persons must follow in order to adapt to loss. It is of
paramount importance to assess stage theory, not least in view of the current status
of the maladaptive ‘‘persistent complex bereavement-related disorder’’ as a category
for further research in DSM-5. We therefore review the status and value of this
approach. It has remained hugely influential among researchers as well as practi-
tioners across recent decades, but there has also been forceful opposition. Major
concerns include the absence of sound empirical evidence, conceptual clarity, or
explanatory potential. It lacks practical utility for the design or allocation of treat-
ment services, and it does not help identification of those at risk or with complica-
tions in the grieving process. Most disturbingly, the expectation that bereaved

 persons will, even should, go through stages of grieving can be harmful to those who
do not. Following such lines of reasoning, we argue that stage theory should be
discarded by all concerned (including bereaved persons themselves); at best, it
should be relegated to the realms of history. There are alternative models that
better represent grieving processes. We develop guidelines to enhance such a
move beyond the stage approach in both theory and practice.

Theoretical models of bereavement should serve the function of increasing
understanding of grief and grieving, particularly given the physical and mental
health ramifications of this severe life event (Parkes, 1972/1996), which may
require professional intervention (Shear, 2015). Among these approaches, so-
called stage theories, postulating that grief progresses through specific emotional
stages, have remained highly influential. Indeed, such adoption of a stage
approach follows a long tradition in psychology (e.g., in developmental,
health, social, and clinical domains) as well as in psychiatry and medicine. A
stage theory can offer new ways of understanding complex systems of human
behavior, ways that may be helpful for diagnostic purposes and to guide inter-
vention (McGorry, 2007). However, those stage theories that have proven valu-
able show the evidence of scientifically based principles (e.g., postulating discrete
changes in the nature of underlying stage-related processes or cognitive levels,
providing empirical evidence for a sequential progression/for efficacy in treat-
ment). Does the stage theory of grief meet such criteria? Is it a valid and useful
model of grief and grieving? Answering such questions requires evaluation of
both its scientific and practical value. Therefore, the aim of this article is to
review and assess the contribution of the stage theory of grief.
To this end, in the next section, we trace how stage theory emerged histori-
cally, documenting its remarkable, persisting popularity in the face of ongoing
opposition. Then we focus on emergent lines of argument against stage theory,
covering conceptual concerns, lack of empirical validity, its failure to assist in
identifying those at risk or with complications, and the potentially negative
consequences for bereaved persons themselves. As we show, the stage theory
of grief falls short in all these respects. There is no scientific foundation, and
decades of research have shown that most people do not grieve in stages. Using
stages as a guide in work with bereaved is unhelpful and may even cause harm.
Our critical assessment leads to the conclusion that stage theory should be
relegated to the past and eliminated from contemporary clinical practice.
We discuss what actions can be taken to move on, suggesting an alternative
approach and providing initial guidelines for health-care professionals and
bereaved persons.

 Stage Theory in Historical Perspective:
Claim and Refutation
The emergence of stage theory is usually ascribed to Elisabeth Ku
¨ bler-Ross’s
(1969) monograph ‘‘On Death and Dying,’’ which documented her observations
of adjustment among dying patients. In essence, Ku
¨ bler-Ross’s stage perspective
held that dying people go through five stages of grieving: denial, anger, bargain-
ing, depression, and, finally, acceptance (sometimes called the DABDA model).
Each stage was described in a separate chapter, with ‘‘stage’’ in the heading of
these, strongly suggesting that they were distinct and sequential, even linear
(although minimal acknowledgment of fluctuations between stages, individually
varying time sequences, and coexisting stages can be detected on close reading).
Later, in reintroducing the stages and focusing more on the bereaved (Ku
¨ bler-
Ross & Kessler, 2005), this was contested (though separate, sequential
descriptions remained).
It is important to note that Ku
¨ bler-Ross herself extended the application
of
the
stages
of
dying
to
the
situation
of
(anticipatorily)
bereaved
persons already in her 1969 book. Excerpts from her chapter ‘‘The Patient’s
Family’’ make this clear:
Family members undergo different stages of adjustment similar to the ones
described for our patients. At first many of them cannot believe it is true. They
may deny the fact that there is such an illness in the family. . . . Just as the patient
goes through a stage of anger, the immediate family will experience the same
emotional reaction. . . . When anger, resentment, and guilt can be worked through,
the family will then go through a phase of preparatory grief, just as the dying
person does. (Ku
¨ bler-Ross, 1969, pp. 168–169)
In the decades following the publication of On Death and Dying, prominent
writers (including many with cautionary words) reported Ku
¨ bler-Ross’s stages
of grief relating to bereavement. For example, already in 1975, Lopata referred
to the existence of a ‘‘‘stages of grief’ ideology’’ (p. 50), describing: ‘‘the cur-
rently popular conception of stages of widowhood.’’ She went on to regret that:
‘‘However the stages of widowhood originated, it has become disseminated to at
least the Chicago area women with great effectiveness. . . . Significant others . . .
have an ideal typical sequence of stages in mind’’ (Lopata, 1975, p. 50).
Other formulations of stages or phases appeared over the following decades
(Bowlby, 1980; Horowitz, 1976; Jacobs, 1993; Sanders, 1989; Shuchter &
Zisook, 1993), varying in labels (e.g., various combinations of disbelief, numb-
ness, yearning, shock, and guilt), numbers of stages (e.g., 3, 4, and 7), and
general guidelines (e.g., emphases on fluidity vs. rigidity). It is beyond our
scope to review all, but our arguments can be considered in the context of
these approaches.

 It was Ku
¨ bler-Ross’s volume which became an international bestseller, even,
according to Friedman and James (2008), reaching the status of ‘‘one of the most
influential books in the history of psychology’’ (p. 37). Indeed, Ku
¨ bler-Ross
succinctly both formulated and popularized stage theory, promoting it through-
out her life. She was also a charismatic person, much admired and loved by her
followers, even described as ‘‘legendary’’; in 1999, Time Magazine named
Ku
¨ bler-Ross as one of the ‘‘100 Most Important Thinkers’’ of the past century
(from her obituary); in 2007, she was posthumously inducted into the United
States Women’s Hall of Fame. Already by 1982, Ku
¨ bler-Ross estimated that her
stages had been taught in 125,000 courses in colleges, seminaries, medical
schools, hospitals, and social work institutions (Rosenbaum, 1982; Wortman
& Silver, 1987). By 2016, On Death and Dying reached a remarkable figure of
well over 11,000 citations in Google Scholar.
Contributions of both Parkes and Bowlby, around the time that Ku
¨ bler-Ross’s
monograph was published, avoided some of the pitfalls of stage theory, going on
to become major contributions to understanding of the course of grief and griev-
ing.1 These researchers incorporated the notion of phases in a theory-based
manner (following attachment theory principles; Bowlby, 1980; Parkes, 2006).
More cautiously than Ku
¨ bler-Ross’s (1969) presentation of stages, Bowlby
(1980) stated: ‘‘these phases are not clear cut, and any one individual may oscillate
for a time back and forth between any two of them’’ (p. 85).
Looking across the decades, a highly influential source of opposition to stage
theory came from Wortman and Silver (Silver & Wortman, 1980; Wortman &
Silver, 1987, 1989, 1992), who drew attention to the alarmingly widespread
adoption of stages among health-care professionals, with disastrous conse-
quences for the bereaved, despite lack of solid evidence. Their classic article of
1989, ‘‘The Myths of Coping With Loss,’’ criticized Ku
¨ bler-Ross’s expectation
of recovery through to the final, acceptance stage of grieving, pointing to longer,
varying courses of grieving among many bereaved people (without indications of
pathology). Their conclusions were echoed in the Institute of Medicine’s author-
itative review, which cautioned:
The notion of stages might lead people to expect the bereaved to proceed from one
clearly identifiable reaction to another in a more orderly fashion than usually
occurs. It might also result in inappropriate behavior toward the bereaved, includ-
ing hasty assessments of where individuals are or ought to be in the grieving
process. (Osterweis & Green, 1984, p. 48)
A strongly worded statement by Neimeyer (2000) extended the concerns to stage
theory’s use as a conceptual model for underpinning counseling, denouncing use of
suspiciously simplistic models, such as stage theories of grieving that have
been largely repudiated by contemporary theorists and researchers . . . grief
458
OMEGA—Journal of Death and Dying 74(4)
 counseling . . . rarely draws on the best available theories regarding the nature of
bereavement and its facilitation. (p. 547)
Many other researchers and clinicians have taken issue with stage theory.
For example, Shuchter and Zisook (1993), describing the course of normal
grief (in three flexible phases), too cautioned against the literal use of stages:
‘‘Grief is not a linear process with concrete boundaries but, rather, a composite
of overlapping, fluid phases that vary from person to person’’ (p. 23). Similarly,
Jacobs (1993) drew attention to oversimplification:
Although it is sometimes instructive to conceptualize the manifestations of grief in
this manner, it is important to emphasize that the idea that grief unfolds inexorably
in regular phases is an oversimplification of the highly complex, personal waxing
and waning of the emotional process. (p. 18)
Since the early 1990s, Corr (1993, 2011) has become a major opponent of the
stage theory approach for dying patients and for the bereaved (Corr, 2015),
reviewing earlier criticisms (e.g., lack of scientific corroboration, conceptual
inadequacies, and inappropriateness of the language of stages leading to pre-
scriptive use by practitioners).
Neither these nor other criticisms impacted on Ku
¨ bler-Ross’s adherence to
stages. The title of her 2005 monograph with Kessler, On Grief and Grieving:
Finding the Meaning of Grief Through the Five Stages of Loss, leaves little doubt
about that. This volume, like its 1969 forerunner, continued to strongly divide
opinion among readers (it was positively reviewed by Bolden (2007). The
authors responded to the criticisms from previous years in the opening lines
of Chapter 1:
The stages have evolved since their introduction, and they have been very misun-
derstood over the past three decades. They were never meant to tuck messy emo-
tions into neat packages. They are responses to loss that many people have, but
there is not a typical response to loss, as there is no typical loss. Our grief is as
individual as our lives. (Ku
¨ bler-Ross & Kessler, 2005, p. 7)
Such a disclaimer seems inadequate in the face of lack of evidence for the stages.
The authors still assumed that people experience the stages. In fact, Ku
¨ bler-Ross
and Kessler (2005) seemingly go on to weaken their own case, noting that ‘‘they
are not stops on some linear timeline in grief. Not everyone goes through all of
them or in a prescribed order’’ (p. 7). Friedman and James (2008) counter
argued ‘‘If there are no typical responses to losses, and not everyone goes
through them or in order, how can there possibly be stages that universally
represent people’s reactions to loss?’’ (p. 41). Despite opposition from other
experts too, continued promotion of the stages approach came, somewhat
Stroebe et al.
459
 surprisingly, from a team of empirical researchers (Maciejewski, Zhang, Block,
& Prigerson, 2007), but this (as we shall see) was met with strong criticism.
To this day, stage theory is still widely known, taught, and used in clinical
practice. Konigsberg’s book (2011), entitled The Truth About Grief: The Myth of
its Five Stages and the New Science of Loss, though accessibly reviewed by Balk
(2011) and Neimeyer (2012), has remained apparently unheeded and relatively
uncited. As a final illustration of perseverance, the stages approach has recently
been claimed state of the science of bereavement theorizing in an article by
Jurecic (2015). According to Jurecic, what is ‘‘emblemic of modern loss and
grief’’ in medicine is a progression through Ku
¨ bler-Ross’s five stages (1969),
which ‘‘encourage an orderly process of bereavement,’’ that contemporary (med-
ical) approaches propose that ‘‘mourning progresses in predictable stages’’ and
that there is a ‘‘right way to mourn.’’ This misrepresentation of current scientific
understanding in the bereavement field (elaborated below) does our field—to say
nothing of bereaved people themselves—no good. Worryingly, her claims may
even promote the use of stages. Again the enormous resistance to moving
beyond the stages approach is demonstrated. There are compelling arguments
to be made as to why this situation must change.
Criticisms and Assessment of Stage Theory
From the claims and refutations traced earlier, five main categories of criticism
emerge:
1. Lack of theoretical depth/explanation. In contrast to Bowlby’s phases, Ku
¨ bler-
Ross’s stages (1969) were not derived from theoretical principles. As Archer
(1999) pointed out, the approach ‘‘does not address the issue of what might be
the principles underlying this organization’’ (p. 100). This therefore fails to
address the question: What is the function of grief? In Bowlby’s (1980) case,
the phases were related to attachment phenomena, serving the purpose of
regaining proximity to the person from whom the separation had occurred.
No such underlying principles were postulated for the stages. Bonanno and
Boerner (2007) expressed their doubts as follows:
Grief stages tell us little about how people might cope with the loss; why they might
experience varying degrees and kinds of distress at different times; and how, over
time, they adjust to a life without their loved one. Considering the evidence from
other studies that contradicts the idea of an ‘‘average’’ normal response to loss, this
is a misguiding message. (p. 2693)
The aforementioned shortcomings have a further, major implication: Stage
theory does not help us identify those at high risk or with complications in the
grieving process of great importance for diagnostic systems such as
460
OMEGA—Journal of Death and Dying 74(4)
 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
Problems (ICD-11).
2. Conceptual confusion and misrepresentation of grief and grieving. Among
this class of critical comments, the following stands out: It is unclear
what the sequential stages (i.e., denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and
acceptance) really are and what they represent. Some denote affective
states, others cognitive processes. So there is a mixture of different types
of constructs which do not fit coherently or sequentially together. There is
no theoretical rationale for this particular arbitrary use of dividing lines
between states. Further examples of conceptual concerns are given in
Table 1. Taken together, rather than providing us with ‘‘the knowledge
of grief’s terrain’’ (Ku
¨ bler-Ross & Kessler, 2005, p. 7), it becomes clear
from the points listed that stage theory misrepresents phenomena asso-
ciated with bereavement.
3. Lack of empirical evidence. Ku
¨ bler-Ross’s (1969) knowledge was not derived
from systematic, empirical investigation (of bereaved persons) but through
the contact of ‘‘over two hundred dying patients’’ (p. 38). Despite this
number, in Parkes’ (2013) view, there was lack of scientific rigor: On Death
and Dying was simply ‘‘a collection of case studies in the form of conversa-
tions with dying patients’’ (p. 94). Surprisingly little empirical testing of stage
theory has been subsequently undertaken—as Archer (1999) pointed out, this
is difficult to do. Table 2 reviews relevant studies, indicating little support and
quite some refutation of the stages. In conclusion: While there is empirical
evidence that people experience (some of) the emotional and cognitive reac-
tions some of the time, there is little to support the sequential development of
these in stages.
4. The availability of alternative models. The stages approach has been sup-
planted by finer grained, sometimes theoretically based, more-representa-
tive-of-the-grieving-process models of grief and grieving (see Table 3; for
reviews, see Boerner, Stroebe, Schut, & Wortman, 2015; Doka & Tucci,
2011; Stroebe & Schut, 2001). These alternative perspectives, developed
over the years, are well known but received no acknowledgment or discussion
by Ku
¨ bler-Ross and Kessler (2005).
5. The devastating consequences of using stage theory. Last, but certainly not
least, it is important to recognize that using the stages approach as a
guideline in supporting bereaved persons may raise undue expectations,
even presumptions about the course that grief should take. Naturally,
some bereaved people may feel affirmation from reading about incorpora-
tion of emotions such as anger or despair in stage theory: If they fit one’s
personal experience, they provide verification. Ku
¨ bler-Ross received a large
fan mail confirming this. However, such positive appraisal does not
Stroebe et al.
461
 provide evidence for the sequence of stages in general, nor does it follow
that the stages should be taught or used in therapy. Silver and Wortman
(2007) stated:
A mistaken belief in the stage model . . . can have devastating consequences. Not
only can it lead bereaved persons to feel that they are not coping appropriately, but
Table 1. Misrepresentation of Grief and Grieving in Stage Theories: Major Concerns.
Oversimplicity
Approach does not account for enormous diversity in grief
reactions either between individuals or across time.
Theoretical models should at least attempt to explain
variability.
Passive model
Describes what a bereaved person is put through; the
effortful struggle of coming to terms with loss is not
represented.
Complex nature of coping with
loss
Takes no account of recuperative purpose of avoiding rea-
lity of death at times of doing other things to regain
strength to cope.
Inclusion of poorly defined
concepts
Stage formulations incorporate broad, imprecise terms
(some stages are emotions, some cognitive processes;
e.g., ‘‘depression’’ could range from clinical depression to
sadness).
Implication of smooth
progression
Notion of replacement of one stage by another poorly
represents all we know about the course of grief over
time, particularly regarding the fluctuations between
emotions and cognitions that typify grief and grieving.
Prescriptive statements/
interpretations
‘‘Anger is a necessary stage of the healing process. Be
willing to feel your anger, even though it may seem
endless. The more you truly feel it, the more it will begin
to dissipate and the more you will heal’’ (Ku
¨bler-Ross &
Kessler, 2005, p. 12). While anger is a common grief
symptom (Archer, 1999), evidence shows it is not a
universally experienced emotion (Bonanno & Keltner,
1997; Shuchter & Zisook, 1993).
Failure to account for
secondary stressors
Lack of attention to other stressors not related to grief that
needs to be taken into account in assessing adaptation
(e.g., ongoing life changes, new roles, and identities).
Neglect of the social/cultural
context of grieving
Neglects broader social context of grief and grieving. No
account of interpersonal factors (e.g., processes relating
to family members coping together; Stroebe & Schut,
2015), culturally shared meanings (Rosenblatt, 1983,
2013), social relations and power dimensions
(Thompson, 2002), and historical and cross-cultural
influences (Jalland, 2013).

Barrett and Schneweis (1981)
Investigated shorter versus longer term adjustment among
older adults through in-depth interviews. Finding few
differences according to length of bereavement and
multiple continued difficulties among those bereaved for
many years, the authors concluded that adjustment does
not transpire through successive stages but continues to
be stressful long after bereavement.

Identification of trajectories of grief based on prospective,
longitudinal data spanning from the time before the loss
to the time after. Research showed the kind of grief
trajectory that would resemble the notion of grief stages
is far from being the most dominant pattern. Grief tra-
jectories were first identified based on the changing lives
of older couples study (CLOC; Bonanno et al., 2002;
Bonanno, Wortman, & Nesse, 2004). Nearly half of the
CLOC participants (46%) were labeled as ‘‘resilient’’
because they reported stable low distress levels over the
course of the study. Only 11% showed the trajectory of
grief traditionally assumed to be common (low distress
prior to the death; then after the death, moving from
high distress to low distress over time). Another tra-
jectory identified in this study, labeled as ‘‘depressed
improved,’’ reflected elevated distress before and
improvement after the loss (10%). A similar drop in
distress levels postdeath was found in prospective stu-
dies with pre- and postdeath data from dementia care-
givers (Aneshensel, Botticello, & Yamamoto-Mitani,

tress trajectory reflecting the so-called ‘‘common’’ grief
after the death (Aneshensel et al., 2004; Zhang et al.,

Claimed to have accomplished the first true empirical
examination of the stage theory and found evidence
supporting the stages. Examined the patterns of change
in five stages symptoms (representing disbelief, yearning,
anger, depression, and acceptance) over time. They drew
the following conclusion: ‘‘Identification of the normal
stages of grief following a death from natural causes
enhances understanding of how the average person
cognitively and emotionally processes the loss of a family
member’’ (p. 16).
Letters to the editor of The Journal of
the American Medical Association
(which published this work) raised
questions about the design and
methodological features of the study
(Bonanno & Boerner, 2007), shed-
ding serious doubt on the soundness
of the empirical foundation for this
claim (see also Friedman & James,
2008, p. 38; Weiner, 2007, for
further critical evaluations).
Prigerson and Maciejewski subse-
quently suggested relabeling and
reconceptualizing stages as ‘‘multidi-
mensional grief states that evolve
and diminish in intensity over time’’
(2008, p. 436), leaving unclear
whether they still endorse their

 Table 3. Moving Beyond the Stages of Grief and Grieving: Suggestions and Guidelines.
1. Nonexistence of stages
�
Grieving is not a stage-like, sequential, orderly, predictable process across time
�
Bereaved people do not (and should not expect to) go through a set pattern of specific reactions.
�
Grief can involve complex, fluctuating, emotional reactions (sometimes experienced as a ‘‘roller coaster’’).
�
There are different patterns of ‘‘normal’’ (as well as complicated) ways of grieving.
�
Patterns vary greatly in terms of specific reactions, time-related changes, and duration of acute grieving
period.
�
There are large individual/cultural differences in reactions to loss.
�
There is no sound scientific basis for Ku
¨bler-Ross’s stages.
2. Theoretical
considerations
�
The aim of theoretical models is to understand (and try to explain) the grieving process, not to be
prescriptive about what people have to go through.
�
There are alternative scientific perspectives that better represent the course of grief and grieving (e.g.,
trajectories approach (Bonanno, 2004), cognitive stress theory (Folkman, 2001), meaning making
approach (Neimeyer, 2001), psychosocial transition model (Parkes, 1971), two-track model (Rubin,
1981), dual process model (Schut & Stroebe, 1999), new model of grief (Walter, 1996), and task
model (Worden, 1982). For a review, see Stroebe and Schut (2001).
3. Clinical implications
�
Most bereaved people adjust to their loss in their own manner (not through stages) over the course of
time.
�
It is wrong to expect bereaved people to go through stages of grief in order to adapt.
�
Not experiencing stages does not mean that grieving is running a complicated course (only a minority of
bereaved people need professional help; most do fine with their informal support networks/own
resources).
�
Counselors, clinicians, and other health-care professionals should not use stages as guidelines for
bereaved clients.
�
Placing expectations on bereaved people about needing to experience stages of grief can be harmful.
4. Practical moves/actions
to be taken
�
Develop strategies to ensure that stage theory loses its appeal and is no longer taught or practiced.
�
Develop guidelines to promote a shift away from the use of stage theory.
�
Produce flyers for circulation to researchers/clinicians/bereaved persons and those in their networks.
(continued)
465
 Table 3. Continued
�
Inform people of nonexistence of set stages and existence of theoretical developments/alternative per-
spectives.
�
The Internet: Start a drive to better inform Internet sites (e.g., bereavement support services) against
promoting the stages approach and to detail alternative approaches/premises. Teaching: Inform teachers of
death, dying, and bereavement courses; scrutinize content of textbooks and syllabuses; and revise the
teaching of stage theory to present it only as a historical entity. Health-care professionals: Spread the word,
this article.
5. Derive postulates
�
Stage theory should not be used by practitioners (e.g., physicians, counselors, therapists, social workers)
or by bereaved people themselves as a framework to guide understanding of (others’ or own) grieving.
�
It should only be taught as part of curricula in courses of death, dying, and bereavement in its historical
context and as an unacceptable assumption (cf. Weinstein [Holland & Neimeyer, 2010] in Thompson,
2002, p. 196).
�
Bereaved people need to know not to expect to go through stages.
466
 it also can result in ineffective support provision by members of their social net-
work as well as unhelpful and potentially harmful responses by health care profes-
sional. (p. 2692)
Such fears were endorsed by Friedman and James (2008) who expressed concern
about the ‘‘horror stories . . . heard from thousands of grieving people who’ve
told us how they’d been harmed by them.’’
Many writers have also drawn attention to the dangers for bereaved people of
prescriptive interpretation. The stages, it was often said, were meant to be
descriptive. However, they have been taken to be prescriptive (browsing the
Internet provides ample evidence). Caregivers mention clients worrying because
they are not experiencing the stages in ‘‘the right order’’ (and that a not-uncom-
mon reason for seeking professional help is a failure to experience one or more
of the stages of grief). Whatever the intention, the theory promotes the idea of an
orderly progression through distinct periods of grief and grieving, ones which
can be identified and described by particular features.
Conclusions
Where do these criticisms leave us? Certainly, Ku
¨ bler-Ross’s enormous impact
must be acknowledged. Her writing (indeed, her whole extraordinary career)
drastically altered the care and treatment of dying patients (see, e.g.,
Friedman & James, 2008). Her work brought death and dying out of the
closet. Furthermore, bereaved people stand to benefit from her compassionate,
easily accessible writing and teaching. However, such merits are on a completely
different level from evaluation of the actual stages; it does not follow that the
stages are adequate representations of what grieving people go through.
Why has stage theory been so impossible to dislodge from its favored position
among many teachers, clinicians, and clients? The abiding appeal is perhaps its
simplicity. In the midst of such emotional complexity as characterizes the
bereavement experience, the stages offer something to hold on to, both descrip-
tively and prescriptively. Bereaved people want to know what to expect and how
long the upset will last (Friedman & James, 2008). As Hall (2014) expressed,
‘‘Stage theories have a certain seductive appeal—they bring a sense of concep-
tual order to a complex process and offer the emotional promised land of
‘recovery’ and ‘closure’’’ (p. 8).
What we need, then, is not a plethora of alternative perspectives but an
accessible, easily comprehensible, informative, single substitute for stages (but
one that at least attempts explanation at a theoretical level). In our view, we
should aim for further theoretical integration. Having a range of alternatives
presents a weak, nonunited front to stage theory. That is perhaps a major next
step for researchers to take: to work toward developing a theory that explains
the process of dealing with loss and ongoing life, reflecting the experience of

 bereaved persons, their thoughts, and feelings. Indeed, some of the perspectives
[e.g., trajectories, Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement (DPM),
meaning making] are compatible in important ways (e.g., in their focus on
both loss and change; Marris, 1974; Parkes, 1971; Stroebe & Schut, 2015).
Furthermore, concrete steps must be taken to encourage the move beyond
stages in practical as well as in such theoretical terms (see Table 3).
In summary, the critical points outlined earlier provide a strong case for
abandoning the stage theory of grief and grieving. We have argued that, while
it is the nature of the endeavor that scientists try to identify regularities, the
regularities of stage theory are too simplistic and limited; they fail to represent
the complex emotions and processes of grief and grieving. They also lack empiri-
cal foundation. Using stages in practice is potentially harmful, and yet an (per-
haps the) ultimate goal of theory construction in our field is to enable health-care
professionals to provide tangible help to those who need it.
Therefore, our urgent appeal is for the stages to be relegated to the shelves of
history. They are, after all, only ‘‘manmade’’: As Rosenblatt (1983) puts it, ‘‘The
stages are, of course, mental constructions of researchers, clinicians, and theore-
ticians. They are not real, quite abruptly delineable sets of events that are obvious
to any observer’’ (pp. 38–39). It is our sincere hope that this article will help
eradicate adherence to stage theory and promote discussion of alternatives, in
the best interests of bereaved people and those who endeavor to support them.

Note
1. The question whose ideas they were in the first place has been raised (Archer, 1999;
Bonanno, 2009; Parkes, 2013). Ku
¨ bler-Ross was inspired by the earlier work of Bowlby
and his collaborators but failed to acknowledge such origins. In Parkes’ (2013) words:
her claim in On death and dying to have discovered the ‘stages of grief’ fails to
mention that these stages were originated by James Robertson and John Bowlby
in their studies of children separated from their mother (Robertson & Bowlby,
1952) and applied by Bowlby and myself (Bowlby & Parkes, 1970) to the reac-
tions of adults suffering bereavements. She knew about our work, for I met her
and lectured on the subject at Billings Hospital, where she was doing her research
. . . . She makes no reference to this work in her text. (p. 95)

Author Biographies
Margaret Stroebe is Professor Emeritus at both the Department of Clinical and
Health Psychology, Utrecht University, and the Department of Clinical
Psychology and Experimental Psychopathology, University of Groningen, The
Netherlands. She has specialized in the field of bereavement research for many
years. With Henk Schut she developed the Dual Process Model of Coping with
Bereavement. Her book publications include ‘‘Bereavement in Later Life:
Coping, Attachment, and Developmental Influences’’ (2007) with Robert
Hansson. She edited ‘‘Complicated Grief: Scientific Foundations for Health
Care Professionals’’ (with Henk Schut and Jan van den Bout) in 2013. Her
current interests still cover theoretical, empirical, and reviews of the bereavement
area (e.g., critical evaluation of coping models, intervention efficacy; implemen-
tation of network analyses; health consequences) as well as investigation of the
‘‘mini-grief’’ of homesickness. Her honors include an Honorary Doctorate from
the University of Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, the Scientific Research Award of
the American Association of Death Education and Counseling, in the U.S.A.,
and the title in 2011 of Officer of the Order of Orange Nassau, in the
Netherlands.
Henk Schut is a Clinical Psychologist and Associate Professor of Clinical and
Health Psychology at Utrecht University, the Netherlands. His research interests
cover processes of coping with loss and the efficacy of bereavement care and
grief therapy. Henk also works as a Trainer for professionals (e.g. medical
specialists, funeral directors) in dealing with bereaved people and he supervises
post-academic clinical psychologists in their research projects. Henk is Coauthor
of a number of scientific and professional articles and books on grief, bereave-
ment and death. Henk is one of the Editors of Handbook of Bereavement
Research (2001), Handbook of Bereavement Research and Practice: Advances

 in Theory and Intervention (2009), both together with Maggie Stroebe,
Wolfgang Stroebe and Bob Hansson and, together with Maggie Stroebe and
Jan van den Bout, Complicated Grief: Scientific Foundations for Health Care
Professionals (2012).
Kathrin Boerner, PhD, is Associate Professor of Gerontology at the McCormack
Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies, University of Massachusetts
Boston. Her research expertise is in adult development and aging, with a
focus on coping with chronic illness, end-of-life, and bereavement. Dr.
Boerner has a strong publication and funding record (over 80 journal articles/
book chapters; US and international funding). Dr. Boerner’s research program
aims at increasing preparation for the final phase of life in patients, family
caregivers, and healthcare staff alike, both by developing strategies to strengthen
caregiver preparedness and by identifying barriers to high quality end-of-life
care.
