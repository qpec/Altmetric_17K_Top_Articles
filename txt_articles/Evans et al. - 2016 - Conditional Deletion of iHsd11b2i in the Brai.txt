eralocorticoid receptor (MR) by endogenous cortisol (corti-
costerone in rodents).1 Reduced 11βHSD2 activity causes a 
spectrum of disease: genetic ablation of the enzyme causes 
the life-threatening syndrome of Apparent Mineralocorticoid 
Excess (AME; OMIM +218030), diagnosed in early child-
hood2; reduced activity causes hypertension in adults,3 and

Clinical Perspective on p 1370
AME presents with sodium retention6 and, in common 
with monogenic Liddle syndrome,7 can be resolved by renal 
transplantation.8 This suggests that high blood pressure fol-
lows the kidney,9 at least in these spectral disorders. This 
renal-centric view of hypertension is supported by our stud-
ies in Hsd11b2 null mice, which are hypertensive on a basal 
salt intake;10 renal sodium excretion is reduced, and sodium 
Background—The hypertensive syndrome of Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess is caused by loss-of-function mutations 
in the gene encoding 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βHSD2), allowing inappropriate activation of the 
mineralocorticoid receptor by endogenous glucocorticoid. Hypertension is attributed to sodium retention in the distal 
nephron, but 11βHSD2 is also expressed in the brain. However, the central contribution to Apparent Mineralocorticoid 
Excess and other hypertensive states is often overlooked and is unresolved. We therefore used a Cre-Lox strategy to 
generate 11βHSD2 brain-specific knockout (Hsd11b2.BKO) mice, measuring blood pressure and salt appetite in adults.
Methods and Results—Basal blood pressure, electrolytes, and circulating corticosteroids were unaffected in Hsd11b2.BKO 
mice. When offered saline to drink, Hsd11b2.BKO mice consumed 3 times more sodium than controls and became 
hypertensive. Salt appetite was inhibited by spironolactone. Control mice fed the same daily sodium intake remained 
normotensive, showing the intrinsic salt resistance of the background strain. Dexamethasone suppressed endogenous 
glucocorticoid and abolished the salt-induced blood pressure differential between genotypes. Salt sensitivity in Hsd11b2.
BKO mice was not caused by impaired renal sodium excretion or volume expansion; pressor responses to phenylephrine 
were enhanced and baroreflexes impaired in these animals.
Conclusions—Reduced 11βHSD2 activity in the brain does not intrinsically cause hypertension, but it promotes a 
hunger for salt and a transition from salt resistance to salt sensitivity. Our data suggest that 11βHSD2-positive neurons 
integrate salt appetite and the blood pressure response to dietary sodium through a mineralocorticoid receptor–
dependent pathway. Therefore, central mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism could increase compliance to low-
sodium regimens and help blood pressure management in cardiovascular disease.  (Circulation. 2016;133:1360-1370.

transport pathways in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron 
are inappropriately activated.11,12 Similarly, Hsd11b2 heterozy-
gote null mice, which have normal basal blood pressure, can-
not efficiently excrete a sodium load and are salt sensitive.13,14
11βHSD2 is also normally expressed in the brain, but the 
contribution of central pathways to hypertension in AME and 
other hypertensive states is poorly understood and often over-
looked. Studies in humans suggest that 11βHSD2 in the brain 
may contribute to abnormal sodium homeostasis: increased 
salt appetite has been reported in AME15 and loss-of-function 
variants positively associate with sodium intake in the gen-
eral population.16 Moreover, the sympathetic nervous system 
is activated in Hsd11b2 null mice, contributing importantly to 
the maintenance of hypertension in these animals.11
11βHSD2 has a widespread central expression during fetal 
development and modulates glucocorticoid programming 
of adult behavior and cognitive function.17 Fetal 11βHSD2 
expression is progressively silenced from midgestation, and, 
in adulthood, 11βHSD2 is restricted to subpopulations of neu-
rons in brain areas influencing blood pressure and, less cer-
tainly, salt appetite.17–19 In the adult mouse, Hsd11b2 is only 
expressed in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS).20 However, 
defining the role of 11βHSD2 in these NTS neurons of the 
adult brain has been challenging. Overstimulation of these 
neurons by intracerebrovascular infusion of aldosterone21 or 
11βHSD2 inhibitors22 increases blood pressure. Such studies 
are informative but lack precision; conventional gene targeting 
induces a complex and unstable phenotype with deranged sys-
temic electrolyte and hormonal status.11 We therefore recently 
used a Cre-Lox strategy to conditionally delete Hsd11b2 in 
the mouse central nervous system. At embryonic day 12.5, the 
peak of gestational 11βHSD2 expression in the brain, mRNA 
abundance was reduced by 96% in the knockout mice.23 This 
programmed depressive behavior and cognitive impairment in 
adulthood.23 Renal 11βHSD2 expression was not affected by 
conditional brain targeting, and, in adults, basal blood pres-
sure and sodium excretion were normal.23 In the current study, 
we show that central deletion of Hsd11b2 causes an innate 
salt appetite, leading to a sustained increase in blood pressure 
without systemic sodium retention. Hypertension was associ-
ated with an exaggerated pressor response to α-adrenoreceptor 
activation and an attenuated baroreflex.
Methods
Generation of Experimental Mice
Hsd11b2f/f mice were generated on a C57BL6 background (Artemis 
Pharmaceuticals, Cologne, Germany) by inserting LoxP sites into 
introns 1 and 5. These mice were bred with transgenic mice expressing 
Cre recombinase under the control of a rat nestin promoter/enhancer 
(B6.Cg-Tg(Nes-cre)1Kln/J; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), 
as we described.23 This generated Nestin-Cre.Hsd11b2fl/fl offspring 
(Hsd11b2 Brain Knockout; Hsd11b2.BKO) and Hsd11b2fl/fl littermate 
controls. All experiments were performed blinded to genotype and in 
accordance with the United Kingdom Home Office Animals (Scientific 
Procedures) Act, following ethical review by the University.
Measurement of 11βHSD2 Expression and Activity
mRNA abundance for Hsd11b2 in whole kidney and in isolated NTS 
was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and quanti-
fied by using the second derivative maximum method.24 11βHSD2 
expression in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron was confirmed 
by immunohistochemistry, and 11βHSD2 enzyme activity was mea-
sured as the conversion of [3H]corticosterone to [3H]dehydrocortico-
sterone, quantified by thin-layer chromatography.
Blood Pressure Measurement 
Radiotelemetry devices (model TA-11PAC-10, Data Systems 
International, St Paul, MN) were inserted into Hsd11b2.BKO (n=6) 
and control mice (n=6) under ketamine-medetomidine anesthesia. 
After a week of postoperative recovery, data were collected over a 
5-minute period every 20 minutes at an acquisition rate of 2 kHz. 
Mice were housed under controlled temperature (21±1°C) and 
humidity (50±10%) with a fixed 12-hour light:dark cycle (lights on 7 
am local time). Each animal underwent the following protocols.
Ad Libitum Salt Intake
Blood pressure was recorded over a 7-day baseline period dur-
ing which mice were able to drink from 2 bottles containing 
deionized water. This experiment was repeated in an independent 
cohort of nontelemetered mice, and the data sets were merged to 
give Hsd11b2.BKO (n=12) and control (n=9). Water intake was 
≈4 mL/24 h and was not different between groups. After 7 days, 
1 water bottle was replaced with a 1.5% NaCl bottle for a 21-day 
period. Bottle position was alternated every 24 hours to negate side 
preference. Throughout this experiment, both groups of mice had a 
similar food intake.
Fixed Salt Intake 
Mice were fed a diet in which sodium was incorporated as a pow-
dered chow mixed with gelatin. During baseline, the diet contained 
≈0.1% sodium by weight, which was then increased to ≈1% sodium 
for a 7-day period. The amount of the gel consumed per day was pre-
determined to ensure that mice ate the entire block, clamping sodium 
intake across genotypes during the experimental phase. Mice had 
access to deionized drinking water throughout this experiment, and 
blood pressure was recorded by radiotelemetry.
Dexamethasone 
Once blood pressure had reached steady state under matched sodium 
feeding, dexamethasone (DEX) was administered via the drinking 
water (1 μg/mL in 0.1% ethanol) and plasma corticosterone mea-
sured at 7 pm was reduced in both genotypes (Hsd11b2.BKO=186±38 
versus 31±5 nmol/L after DEX; Control=205±18 basal versus 43±8 
nmol/L after DEX).
Salt-Taste Threshold
In a cohort of control (n=4) and Hsd11b2.BKO (n=4) mice, taste 
threshold was assessed by offering a first drinking bottle contain-
ing deionized water and a second containing either a saline solution 
(0.25%–3%) or quinine (1%). Each measurement was made over 48 
hours.
Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonism
Intake of 1.5% saline was determined in a separate group of Hsd11b2.
BKO mice (n=8), before (baseline) and after MR antagonism with 
spironolactone; measurements were also made in a group (n=3) of 
control mice. Spironolactone was distributed 1:4 w:w in an elastomer 
matrix (Silastic MDX4-4210, Dow Corning) and pellets cured over-
night at 37°C. After ad libitum salt preference had been measured, 
pellets were implanted subcutaneously under isoflurane anesthesia. 
Each pellet contained ≈30 mg of the drug, designed to achieve a 
plasma concentration of canrenone (the active metabolite of spirono-
lactone) of ≈75 nmol/L.25
Sodium Balance in Conscious Mice 
Mice (n=6 of each genotype) were housed in individual metabolism 
cages for measurement of sodium and potassium excretion, first on 
basal sodium diet (0.1% sodium), then 1% sodium diet. Urinary

sodium and potassium concentration was measured by flame photom-
etry; plasma sodium and potassium were measured by ion-selective 
electrode (AVI 9180 Electrolyte analyzer, Roche UK). Aldosterone26 
and corticosterone27 concentration in urine was measured by enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay.
Baroreceptor Reflex
The integrated baroreceptor reflex was assessed pharmacologically 
in anesthetized mice (thiobutabarbital; 120 mg/kg IP) maintained 
on either 0.1% sodium diet or 1% sodium diet for 7 days before the 
experiment. A cannula was inserted into the jugular vein and a tra-
cheostomy was performed. A cannula filled with heparin-saline was 
placed in the carotid artery. The cannula was made from a ≈5-mm 
length of p10 Portex tubing inserted into a ≈50-mm length of p50 
tubing. The undampened pulse wave was recorded continuously at 1 
kHz using a Capto pressure transducer connected to a Powerlab (AD 
Instruments, Oxford, UK). After postsurgical equilibration, sodium 
nitroprusside (30, 60, and 120 μg/kg) and phenylephrine (10, 20, and 
40 μg/kg) were injected intravenously in random order, to induce 
acute decreases and acute increases in blood pressure, respectively. 
For each injection, the change in heart rate at the peak change in sys-
tolic blood pressure (SBP) was recorded and Δheart rate/ΔSBP was 
used as an index of baroreceptor gain.
Statistics 
Data are presented as mean±standard error, as medians with inter-
quartile range, or as linear regression with 95% confidence interval, 
as appropriate. Statistical comparisons (Graphpad Prism 6, La Jolla, 
CA) were made by using 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 
repeated measures, Mann-Whitney U or t tests, as stated in the fig-
ure legends. For 2-way ANOVA, we assessed the main effects of 
the genotype and treatment and the interaction between the 2. When 
used, planned or post hoc comparisons were made by using Holm-
Sidak test to correct for multiple comparisons. The family P value 
was fixed at 0.05, and the number of comparisons is indicated in 
the figure legends. The diurnal variation in SBP and heart rate was 
characterized by cosinor analysis,28 calculating by sine function least-
squares regression, mesor, amplitude, and acrophase for each mouse; 
these values were then used to calculate the group mean comparison 
between genotypes by the Welch t test. The goodness-of-fit model 
was confirmed in all cases by the significance of the F statistic using 
the zero-amplitude test (P<0.01 or less).
Results
Baseline Parameters
The expression of Hsd11b2 mRNA in the NTS of adult 
Hsd11b2.BKO mice was reduced by >90% in comparison 
with controls (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Expression and localization of renal 11βHSD2 in adult 
Hsd11b2.BKO mice was not different from control animals 
(Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement).
Under baseline conditions SBP, diastolic blood pressure 
(DBP), and heart rate were similar in Hsd11b2.BKO mice 
and controls (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement; 
Table I in the online-only Data Supplement); the acrophase 
of the diurnal variation for SBP and heart rate corresponded 
to 3 am local time in both groups of animals. Food/water 
intake, plasma electrolytes, hematocrit, and corticosteroids 
were not different between genotypes (Table II in the online-
only Data Supplement). These data contrast with observa-
tions in animals with global Hsd11b2 deletion,10,11 which are 
hypertensive and hyperkalemic and have a suppressed renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system under conditions of basal 
sodium intake.
Salt-Sensitive Hypertension in Hsd11b2.BKO Mice
When offered 1.5% NaCl solution to drink, Hsd11b2.BKO 
mice became hypertensive, average 24-hour SBP increas-
ing by 20 to 30 mm Hg over a 2-week period (Figure 1A); 
blood pressure was not changed in control mice during ad 
libitum access to saline. In Hsd11b2.BKO mice, blood pres-
sure returned to baseline when the saline-drinking option was 
withdrawn (Figure 1A).
Cosinor analysis was performed on data acquired over 
4 consecutive days (periods indicated in Figure 1A) during 
both basal and saline periods. High salt intake caused a sig-
nificant increase in mesor SBP in Hsd11b2.BKO mice but not 
in controls (Figure IVA in the online-only Data Supplement; 
Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). The amplitude 
of the diurnal SBP variation was also significantly higher 
in Hsd11b2.BKO mice than in controls (Figure IVB in the 
online-only Data Supplement; Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement), whereas acrophase was not affected by sodium 
intake. Both SBP (Figure 1B) and DBP (Figure 1C) were sig-
nificantly elevated during the dark phase of the day/night cycle 
in Hsd11b2.BKO mice, but this salt sensitivity was not asso-
ciated with a genotypic difference in the heart rate over the 
24-hour cycle (Figure V in the online-only Data Supplement; 
Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).
Salt Appetite and Hypertension
Both Hsd11b2.BKO and control mice had a daily deionized 
water intake of ≈4 mL. When presented with the option, 
Hsd11b2.BKO mice spontaneously drank ≈8 mL/24 h of 
1.5% NaCl while maintaining their deionized water intake 
(Figure 2A). Hsd11b2.BKO mice had salt preference, saline 
accounting for >60% of total fluid intake. Control mice also 
drank from the saline bottle but displayed a modest salt aver-
sion, with saline accounting for <40% of total intake. Thus, 
daily sodium intake increased significantly in both genotypes, 
but the average intake over the experiment was ≈3 times 
higher in the Hsd11b2.BKO mice than in controls (Hsd11b2.
BKO=3154±352 μmol/24 h; Control=982±129 μmol/24 h; 
P<0.001).
We were not able to detect a lower threshold for salt 
preference, Hsd11b2.BKO mice maintained a higher saline-
to-water intake at all but the highest concentration (3% NaCl) 
tested (Figure 2B). This abnormality was not a generalized 
taste phenomenon, because Hsd11b2.BKO mice retained an 
aversion for quinine (Figure 2B). Systemic administration of 
the MR antagonist, spironolactone, did not affect saline intake 
in the 3 control mice (Figure 2C) but reduced saline drinking 
in all 8 Hsd11b2.BKO mice tested (Figure 2D). On average, 
spironolactone reduced saline intake to 69±5% of predrug val-
ues (P=0.0006, 1-sample t test). Nevertheless, saline intake 
remained higher in Hsd11b2.BKO mice than in controls dur-
ing spironolactone treatment. Spironolactone did not affect 
water consumption in either group of mice.
To resolve whether increased salt intake in Hsd11b2.
BKO mice was causal or permissive for the hypertensive phe-
notype, the 2 groups of mice were fed an equivalent amount 
of sodium-rich gel-diet. The average sodium intake was 
4619±121 μmol/24 h in Hsd11b2.BKO mice and 4790±215 
μmol/24 h in controls (n=6 per group. P=0.452). High sodium

feeding significantly increased SBP (Figure 3A and 3B) and 
DBP (Figure 3C) in Hsd11b2.BKO mice. The amplitude of 
the 24-hour SBP rhythm was also significantly increased 
(P=0.006; Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). Heart 
rate was not different between genotypes, but high salt intake 
reduced the amplitude of the 24-hour rhythm significantly in 
Hsd11b2.BKO mice (P=0.044; Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Blood pressure in control mice was not affected by high 
salt intake, indicating that the C57BL6/J background strain 
was not intrinsically salt sensitive. This salt resistance in the 
control animals means that the salt-sensitive hypertension of 
Hsd11b2.BKO mice cannot just reflect increased salt appe-
tite. The data suggest that central homeostatic response to salt 
intake becomes abnormal following deletion of 11βHSD2 
in the brain. This does not reflect abnormalities in systemic 
corticosteroid production: aldosterone and corticosterone 
excretion were similar in both genotypes under high-salt con-
ditions (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement).
Effect of Oral Dexamethasone
Deficiency of 11βHSD2 allows MR to be activated by endog-
enous glucocorticoid. DEX suppression of the hypothalamo-
pituitary-adrenal axis, which markedly reduces cortisol levels, 
can be used to treat patients with AME. DEX suppressed cor-
ticosterone (the endogenous glucocorticoid in rodents) in both 
Hsd11b2.BKO mice and controls, and, after 5 days of treat-
ment, the genotypic difference in mean blood pressure was no 
longer apparent (Figure 4A). However, unequivocal interpre-
tation of these data is challenging, because, as expected, DEX 
increased SBP (Figure 4B) and DBP (Figure 4C) in control 
mice.

Hypertension Is Not Caused by Sodium Retention
The effect of increased salt intake on renal sodium excretion 
was assessed in a separate cohort of mice (n=6 for each geno-
type), fed first the basal salt diet (0.1% sodium) diet, followed 
by the high-salt (1% sodium) diet. Basal sodium intake aver-
aged 420±15 μmol/24 h in Hsd11b2.BKO mice and 397±20 
μmol/24 h in controls: urinary sodium excretion was not dif-
ferent between genotypes (Figure VIA in the online-only Data 
Supplement). During the high-salt phase, average sodium 
intake again increased 10-fold in both control (4810±177 
μmol/24 h) and Hsd11b2.BKO (4335±240 μmol/24 h) mice 
and was not significantly different between the 2 groups 
(P=0.143; unpaired t test). Urinary sodium excretion was 
significantly higher in Hsd11b2.BKO mice than in con-
trols during this period (Figure VIA in the online-only Data 
Supplement), suggesting that hypertension was not attribut-
able to renal sodium retention.
Basal urine flow rate was slightly higher in Hsd11b2.
BKO mice than in controls, and the diuresis prompted by 
high-sodium feeding was significantly greater in Hsd11b2.
BKO mice (Figure VIB in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Dietary sodium feeding was not associated with marked 
changes in hematocrit in either genotype (Table II in the 
online-only Data Supplement). Overall, these data indicate 
that hypertension was not caused by absolute plasma volume 
expansion following sodium retention.
The high-sodium diet induced hypokalemia in Hsd11b2.
BKO mice (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). 
This did not reflect a change in dietary potassium intake, 
which was consistent throughout the study and not different 
between genotype. Given the exaggerated salt-induced diure-
sis in Hsd11b2.BKO mice, we anticipated that urinary potas-
sium losses would account for potassium depletion. Although 
urinary potassium excretion was indeed higher in Hsd11b2.

feeding (Figure VIC in the online-only Data Supplement).
Enhanced Pressor Effect of Phenylephrine and 
Impaired Baroreflex Gain in Hsd11b2.BKO Mice
The salt-sensitive hypertension in Hsd11b2.BKO mice was 
not associated with a compensatory fall in heart rate, but the 
amplitude of the 24-hour cycle of heart rate was significantly 
reduced, suggesting impaired autonomic cardiac control. The 
NTS is an important site of baroreflex integration, and we there-
fore assessed directly the bradycardic response to an acutely 
applied pressor stimulus. In Hsd11b2.BKO mice maintained 
on a 0.1% salt diet, the pressor response to phenylephrine was 
significantly enhanced (Figure 5A), and the bradycardic baro-
reflex gain was significantly attenuated (Figure 5B). Reflex 
tachycardia response to sodium nitroprusside was similar in 
both genotypes (Figure 5C), as was the net fall in SBP. Overall, 
Hsd11b2.BKO mice displayed an asymmetrical attenuation of 
the baroreceptor reflex curve (Figure 5D; P<0.0001). Similar 
results were obtained in a separate cohort of Hsd11b2.BKO 
mice and controls maintained on a 1% sodium diet for 7 days 
(Figure VII in the online-only Data Supplement). There was 
no significant effect of increased dietary salt intake on barore-
flex function in control mice. Hsd11b2.BKO mice displayed 
and impaired bradycardic baroreflex gain. This defect was not 
exaggerated by dietary salt loading.
Discussion
Reduced 11βHSD2 activity causes a spectrum of hyperten-
sion-associated disease. Its most severe form, AME, can be 
rescued by renal transplantation,8,29 suggesting that high blood 
pressure follows the kidney.9 However, 11βHSD2 is also 
expressed in the brain,17 restricted to a subset of neurons in the 
NTS in the adult mouse.20 We used a Cre-Lox strategy to con-
ditionally delete Hsd11b2 in the brain, reducing expression

in the NTS by >90%. We found that 11βHSD2 in the brain 
normally exerts significant influence over sodium homeo-
stasis and blood pressure control, independent of renal func-
tion. We identified 3 important phenotypes in Hsd11b2.BKO 
mice: (1) an innate salt appetite, blocked by MR antagonism; 
(2) salt sensitivity of blood pressure, independent of salt 
appetite and sodium retention; and (3) an exaggerated pres-
sor response to α-adrenoreceptor activation and an impaired 
reflex bradycardia.
Central Deletion of 11βHSD2 and Salt Appetite
Negative salt balance evokes an instinctive salt-seeking 
behavior. The central pathways for this physiological 
response are not fully elucidated, but 11βHSD2-expressing 
neurons in the NTS are selectively activated by sodium deple-
tion and rapidly inactivated when salt appetite is satiated.18 
Hsd11b2.BKO mice had a strong salt appetite in the absence 
of sodium/volume depletion or systemic aldosterone excess. 
This underscores the concept that local corticosteroid levels 
in the brain influence the physiological control of sodium 
homeostasis. Genetic defects in central MR signaling would 
act synergistically with those in the distal nephron to amplify 
hypertension.
Systemic administration of an MR antagonist was an 
effective treatment but did not completely abolish salt appe-
tite in Hsd11b2.BKO mice. Spironolactone is a competi-
tive antagonist of MR and, although our method of delivery 
achieves high plasma concentrations of the active metabolite, 
canrenone,25 the levels reaching the NTS may be lower.30 
Nevertheless, similar dosing regimens provide neuroprotec-
tion after cerebral ischemia in mice,31 and oral administration 
of low-dose spironolactone decreases sympathetic drive and 
improves baroreflex function in rats with heart failure.32 This 
suggests that central MR can be effectively blocked by sys-
temic spironolactone, and the incomplete rescue of salt appe-
tite in the current study may suggest that additional pathways 
contribute in the Hsd11b2.BKO mice. Central angiotensin II 
promotes thirst and, to a lesser extent, sodium appetite, par-
ticularly in response to sodium depletion or hypovolemia.33 
Because water intake was not different between genotypes, we

discount a major role for angiotensin II in the salt appetite of 
the Hsd11b2.BKO mice.33 In epithelia, MR and the glucocor-
ticoid receptor may interact to regulate aldosterone-induced 
transport proteins such as ENaC.34,35 Indeed, we found that 
the salt sensitivity of the Hsd11b2 heterozygote mouse could 
be blocked by glucocorticoid receptor antagonists.13 Whether 
glucocorticoid receptor contributes to salt sensitivity in 
Hsd11b2.BKO mice is not known. Although glucocorticoids 
are not directly natriorexigenic, they potentiate the salt appe-
tite induced by mineralocorticoids by increasing MR expres-
sion in the brain.36
Central Deletion of 11βHSD2 and Salt-Sensitive 
Blood Pressure
An important observation in our study was the salt-resistant 
blood pressure of the control mice. Thus, with the enzymatic 
barrier protecting MR intact, blood pressure is not affected 
by large (3-fold) increases in sodium intake; if the barrier is 
broken this same sodium load induces a rapid and sustained 
hypertension. The influence of 11βHSD2-positive neurons 
in the NTS therefore extends beyond the regulation of salt 
appetite by normally preventing large fluctuations in dietary 
salt intake from exerting corresponding changes to blood 
pressure.
Unlike humans,6 in mice10 or rats37 with global 11βHSD2 
deficiency, deletion in the brain alone is not sufficient to 
change basal blood pressure, and the additional insult of a sus-
tained high sodium intake is required for hypertension. The 
nature of this interaction is not yet defined. High salt intake 
was necessary but not sufficient for the hypertensive response, 
a situation analogous to the pressor effect of intracerebro-
vascular aldosterone infusion, which is sensitized by, but not 
exclusively dependent on, sodium intake.38
What activates MR to induce salt sensitivity? Aldosterone 
synthase is expressed in rat brain,39 and aldosterone is synthe-
sized centrally.40 However, this is not the case in mouse and 
human brains,41,42 and salt sensitivity in Hsd11b2.BKO mice is 
unlikely to reflect central aldosterone excess. Corticosterone 
and the neurosteroid precursor deoxycorticosterone are plau-
sible alternatives. Indeed, oral DEX attenuated the blood pres-
sure differential between genotypes. However, it is difficult to 
interpret these data because DEX did not actually reduce blood 
pressure in Hsd11b2.BKO mice. Instead, DEX increased 
blood pressure in control animals but not in Hsd11b2.BKO 
mice. It is likely that the peripheral pressor effects of excess 
DEX offset the reversal of central salt sensitivity, making 
the overall benefit for blood pressure in Hsd11b2.BKO mice 
modest.
Central Deletion of 11βHSD2 and Peripheral Blood 
Pressure Control
Salt sensitivity was not associated with sodium retention; 
urinary sodium excretion was higher in Hsd11b2.BKO mice 
than in controls during the dietary salt challenge. The regula-
tion of blood pressure by aldosterone-target neurons in the 
NTS appears independent of kidney function, suggesting that 
MR-dependent hypertension may have a substantial neuro-
genic component.22,43 In other salt-sensitive models, increased 
central sympathetic drive and increased peripheral resistance 
sustain hypertension.44–46 The salt-induced increase in DBP 
and heightened pressor responsiveness to α-adrenoreceptor 
agonism in Hsd11b2.BKO mice are consistent with this 
hypothesis. Similarly, salt-induced hypokalemia in the 
absence of potassium wasting may suggest redistribution of 
potassium into the intracellular compartment following sym-
pathetic activation.47 An impaired baroreflex would release 
tonic inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity, increasing 
sympathetic drive to the peripheral vasculature. In Hsd11b2.
BKO mice, the impairment was asymmetrical, and the abil-
ity to buffer a pressor response was compromised. Similar 
observations are found in healthy humans following systemic 
aldosterone infusion48 and in patients with mild congestive 
heart failure,49 and contribute to increased cardiovascular risk 
in these patients.50
Summary and Perspectives
Our study demonstrates a unifying link between activation 
of MR in the NTS, salt appetite, and blood pressure control. 
In the absence of a physiological stimulus to consume salt, 
this arc is maladaptive and causes salt-sensitive hyperten-
sion. These same molecular pathways regulate renal salt 
reabsorption. Thus, global mutations in key genes will 
give a double hit for hypertension by increasing the behav-
ioral drive to consume sodium and impairing the ability of 
the kidney to excrete this salt. Given that global sodium 
intake is habitually high, this integrated framework of 
sodium homeostasis is highly relevant and suggests that 
MR antagonists could be used to improve compliance to 
dietary sodium restriction in the treatment of cardiovascu-
lar disease.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIvE
For the majority of people in industrialized societies, dietary salt intake habitually exceeds the recommended upper toler-
able limit. This sustained high salt intake is associated with hypertension and with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Reducing sodium intake may be beneficial for a large number of people, particularly those with hypertension or heart failure. 
However, compliance to restricted salt intake is poor, which may in part reflect enhanced salt appetite. The central pathways 
controlling salt intake are incompletely defined, but it is known that certain neurons in the brain stem are activated by salt 
depletion. We genetically modified mice, removing a gene in the brain stem to amplify local aldosterone signaling. Basal 
blood pressure and systemic electrolyte and hormonal status were not affected by this genetic modification. However, ad 
libitum salt intake increased 3-fold and this caused hypertension. We were able to partially block salt appetite with the min-
eralocorticoid antagonist spironolactone. This study demonstrates an important role for brain stem pathways in the control 
of sodium homeostasis and blood pressure. Mineralocorticoid antagonists could help improve compliance to restricted salt 
regimens during the management of cardiovascular disease.
