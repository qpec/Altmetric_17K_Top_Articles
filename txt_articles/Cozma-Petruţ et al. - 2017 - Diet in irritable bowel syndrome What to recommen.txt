Abstract
A substantial proportion of patients with irritable 
bowel syndrome (IBS) associate their symptoms with 
the ingestion of specific foods. Therefore, in recent 
years, scientific research has increasingly focused 
on the role of diet in IBS and dietary management is 
now considered an important tool in IBS treatment. 
This article reviews the main dietary approaches in 
IBS emphasizing evidence from experimental and 
observational studies and summarizing the main diet 
and lifestyle recommendations provided by dietary 
guidelines and scientific literature. Despite the limited 
evidence for a beneficial role, general advice on healthy 
eating and lifestyle is recommended as the first-line 
approach in the dietary management of IBS. Standard 
recommendations include adhering to a regular meal 
pattern, reducing intake of insoluble fibers, alcohol, 
caffeine, spicy foods, and fat, as well as performing 
regular physical activity and ensuring a good hydration. 
Second-line dietary approach should be considered 
where IBS symptoms persist and recommendations 
include following a low FODMAP diet, to be delivered 
only by a healthcare professional with expertise in 
dietary management. The efficacy of this diet is 
supported by a growing body of evidence. In contrast, 
the role of lactose or gluten dietary restriction in the 
treatment of IBS remains subject to ongoing research 
with a lack of high-quality evidence. Likewise, further 
clinical trials are needed to conclude the efficacy of 
probiotics on IBS symptoms.

INTRODUCTION
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional 
gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, with a high global 
prevalence (11.2%) and a strong impact on the 
quality of life
[1,2]. According to the Rome IV criteria, the 
syndrome is defined as recurrent abdominal pain for at 
least 4 d per month over at least 2 mo, associated with 
one or more of the following: related to defecation, 
a change in frequency of stool and/or a change in 
form or appearance of stool
[3]. IBS can be classified 
into 4 subtypes: IBS with predominant diarrhea 
(IBS-D), IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C), 
IBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M), and IBS 
unclassified (IBS-U)
[3]. The pathophysiology of IBS is 
not completely understood, but several abnormalities 
appear to contribute to its pathogenesis, including 
disruption of the brain-gut axis, gut dysmotility, 
visceral hypersensitivity, low-grade mucosal infla-
mmation, increased intestinal permeability, and altered 
microbiota
[4]. 
Moreover
, a number of studies refer to the role 
of diet in IBS, which may be explained by atypical 
modulatory mechanisms of the gut in response to 
stimulation of gut receptors mediated by nutrients
[5].
 
Nutrients presence in the GI tract affects GI motility, 
sensitivity, barrier function, and gut microbiota
[5]. 
Likewise, food hypersensitivity and food intolerance 
have been targeted to underlie the pathogenesis of 
IBS, but there is a lack of quality evidence to support 
this mechanisms
[6]. Hypersensitivity to certain foods 
may play a role by causing low-grade intestinal 
inflammation, increased epithelial barrier permeability 
and visceral hypersensitivity
[5]. Bioactive chemicals 
in foods (e.g., salicylates) also may contribute and 
trigger GI symptoms in IBS, possibly by inducing 
visceral hypersensitivity following chronic exposure
[7]. 
Luminal distension is another mechanism by which 
food has been suggested to induce symptoms in 
IBS
 in that short-chain carbohydrates in the diet can 
increase luminal water retention and gas production, 
thereby leading to bloating, pain and increased visceral 
hypersensitivity
[6,7].
Furthermore, at least two thirds of patients with IBS 
relate their GI symptoms to the ingestion of specific 
foods, making dietary management an important tool 
in the treatment of IBS
[7-9]. Nevertheless, the anxiety 
about food and GI distress corroborated with the fact 
that typical dietary advice in IBS is focused more on 
what foods to avoid, often leaves these subjects with 
unnecessarily self-restrictive diets, which could result 
in nutritional deficiencies
[10,11]. Therefore, it is of utmost 
importance for healthcare professionals to provide 
detailed dietary recommendations to IBS patients. 
This article reviews current evidence on the dietary 
management of IBS with particular emphasis on what 
to recommend to IBS patients. In the last part of the 
article, it is presented the novel “IBS Food Pyramid”, 
which we developed to summarize the main dietary 
and lifestyle recommendations in IBS, as identified in 
current dietary guidelines and the available literature 
in the field. 
FIRST-LINE DIETARY APPROACH IN IBS
Currently, there is a guideline consensus that diet and 
lifestyle advice should be the first-line approach in 
the dietary management of IBS
[12,13]. Healthy eating 
and lifestyle advice can be provided by any healthcare 
professional with interest in IBS dietary management 
(e.g., primary care physician, gastroenterologist, 
dietitian)
[12]. Typical recommendations are following 
a regular eating pattern and limiting the intake of 
potential dietary triggers, such as alcohol, caffeine, 
spicy foods, and fat
[12,13]. Other recommendations 
include ensuring a good hydration and performing a 
regular physical activity
[12,13].
Eating habits
Dietary guidelines
[12,13] make recommendations of 
healthy eating habits in IBS patients, despite the 
limited evidence on the association between poor 
eating patterns and IBS. Several studies have reported 
more irregular meal habits in IBS patients than in 
healthy controls and suggested that irregular eating 
may affect colonic motility and therefore contribute 
to IBS symptoms
[14,15]. Likewise, data obtained by 
questionnaire from binge and non-binge eating obese 
and non-obese women showed that the relative risk 
of IBS was 2-4 times higher among binge eaters, 
suggesting that consumption of large meals may 
induce GI symptoms in IBS
[16]. 
Recommendations on eating habits in IBS, 
accor­ding to dietar­y guidelines and/or­ scientific 
literature: (1) Patients with IBS should be advised

Cozma-Petruţ A et al. Dietary recommendations for IBS
 to establish a regular meal pattern (breakfast, lunch 
and dinner with snacks as appropriate) and to avoid 
skipping meals, leaving long gaps between eating or 
eating late at night
[12,13]; and (2) IBS patients should 
be recommended to avoid large meals as well as to 
take time to eat, to sit down to eat, and to chew food 
thoroughly
[12,13,17]. 
Alcohol intake
Alcohol is known to affect the GI tract motility, 
absorption, and permeability
[18]. However, the 
evidence relating alcohol to IBS is limited
[17]. Studies 
on self-reported food intolerance have indicated a 
role of alcoholic beverages in GI symptoms among 
IBS patients
[8-10]. In contrast, alcohol intake was not 
correlated with IBS in population-based studies
[19,20]. 
Moreover, in women with IBS, GI symptoms like 
abdominal pain and diarrhea have been associated 
only with binge drinking (more than 4 drinks per day) 
and not with moderate (2-3 drinks per day) or light 
drinking (1 drink per day)
[18]. These conflicting results 
on alcohol and IBS emphasize the need for conducting 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the 
effect of low alcohol intake on IBS symptoms. 
Recommendations on alcohol intake in IBS, 
accor­ding to dietar­y guidelines and/or­ scientific 
literature: (1) alcohol intake should be assessed in 
relation to GI symptoms to determine if a reduction 
may alleviate them
[12]; and (2) IBS patients should 
be advised to consume alcohol in compliance with 
recommended safe limits, while having at least two 
alcohol free days a week
[12,21]. Generally, safe alcohol 
limits are described as no more than 1 drink per day 
for women and no more than 2 drinks per day for 
men
[22]. A drink is defined as 12 oz of regular beer 
(5% alcohol), 5 oz of wine (12% alcohol), or 1.5 oz of 
80-proof distilled spirits (40% alcohol)
[22].
Caffeine intake 
Coffee, particularly caffeinated coffee, has been 
demonstrated to increase gastric acid secretion and 
colonic motor activity in healthy individuals
[23,24]. Coffee 
has also been reported to stimulate rectosigmoid 
motor activity and lead to laxative effect in susceptible 
people
[12]. Nevertheless, the role of caffeine in IBS is 
less clear
[17]. Several studies have indicated coffee and 
tea among the foods associated with symptoms by 
IBS patients
[8,10,25]. On the other hand, habits of coffee 
drinking have not been noted to be more common 
among IBS patients than among healthy controls
[18,19]. 
Moreover, there have been no RCTs to determine 
whether a low caffeine intake would lead to better 
clinical outcomes for patients with IBS. 
Recommendations on caffeine intake in IBS, 
accor­ding to dietar­y guidelines and/or­ scientific 
literature: (1) caffeine intake should be assessed 
in IBS patients and, if related to symptoms, daily 
intake should be restricted to 400 mg caffeine, which 
is the safe limit for most adults
[12]; and (2) sources of 
caffeine to watch for include coffee and tea, but also 
energy drinks, soft drinks, dark chocolate, and some 
over-the-counter analgesics
[24].
Spicy foods intake
Many IBS patients report that the ingestion of spicy 
foods triggers GI symptoms, such as abdominal pain 
and gastroesophageal reflux
[8,9,26]. Recently, a large 
cross-sectional study in Iranian adults reported that 
the consumption of spicy foods at least ten times per 
week substantially increased the likelihood of suffering 
from IBS in women but not in men
[27]. However
, this 
study was performed in an Asian country, where the 
average daily chili consumption is 2.5-8 g/person, 
which is much higher than that of 0.05-0.5 g/person in 
Europe and America
[28]. 
Capsaicin is considered the active component in 
red chili responsible for the effects of spicy foods on 
the GI tract
[29,30]. Capsaicin accelerates GI transit via 
the transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) 
causing a sensation of burning and pain in healthy 
individuals
[28]. Increases in the number of TRPV1 
receptors have been found in subjects with disorders 
characterized by visceral hypersensitivity, including in 
patients with IBS
[31,32]. Several studies have shown that 
supplementation of capsaicin exacerbates abdominal 
pain and burning in IBS patients
[33,34]. It is to be noted 
that these studies have used high doses of spices as a 
treatment, whereas there is no reported data on the 
role of habitual consumption of spicy foods in IBS.
Furthermore, there are studies to demonstrate a 
beneficial effect of red pepper in IBS, under conditions 
of chronic consumption
[35]. Nevertheless, in these 
studies, the analgesic effect of red pepper was obtained 
at the expense of an initial, although transitory, 
exacerbation of pain in the first weeks of treatment in 
some patients
[35]. 
Recommendations on spicy foods intake in IBS, 
accor­ding to dietar­y guidelines and/or­ scientific 
literature: (1) spicy food intake should be assessed 
in IBS patients and, if related to IBS symptoms, the 
intake should be restricted
[12]; (2) IBS triggers in spicy 
foods other than hot spices (e.g., fructans in onion and 
garlic) should also be assessed
[12].
Fat intake 
An important proportion of patients with IBS relate 
symptoms to foods rich in fat
[8,25,26]. As a consequence, 
the avoidance of fatty foods is one of the most 
frequent dietary approaches considered by IBS 
patients for symptoms improvement
[36]. Indeed, 
laboratory-based studies have shown that duodenal 
lipids inhibit small bowel motility and impair intestinal 
gas clearance, inducing gas retention and bloating
[37,38].

contradictory data. A systematic review evaluated 12 
RCTs involving 621 patients and found no beneficial 
effect with either soluble fibers or insoluble fibers 
over placebo for improving abdominal pain, global 
assessment or symptom scores
[49]. In contrast, a 
more recent systematic review and meta-analysis 
based on 14 RCTs including 906 patients concluded 
that soluble fibers, such as psyllium, may have some 
beneficial effects in IBS, whereas insoluble fibers, 
such as bran, do not appear to be beneficial and may 
even worsen symptoms
[46]. These data corroborated 
with the information on the fermentability of fibers, 
suggest that soluble viscous fibers with low rate of 
fermentation (e.g., psyllium) would be the most 
appropriate for both constipation and diarrhea in IBS 
patients
[24]. The addition of linseeds in the diet may 
also help in the management of constipation. Linseeds 
are a rich source of dietary fibers and, according 
to prior studies, ground linseed (6-24 g/d) relieved 
constipation, abdominal pain and bloating in IBS-C 
gradually over 3 mo
[12]. 
Recommendations on dietar­y fiber­ intake in IBS, 
accor­ding to dietar­y guidelines and/or­ scientific 
literature: (1) evidence is lacking on the optimal 
dose of fibers in IBS, but a gradual increase in total 
dietary fiber (naturally occurring and supplemented) to 
a target dose of 20-30 g/d should be suitable
[50]. IBS 
patients should however not be advised to increase 
their intake of wheat bran above their usual dietary 
intake
[12]; and (2) patients with IBS-C should be 
recommended to try dietary supplementation of linseeds 
of up to 2 tablespoons per day
, consumed with fluid (150 
mL/tablespoon), for a 3 mo trial
[12]. Improvements in GI 
symptoms from linseed supplementation may take up 
to 6 mo
[12]. 
Milk and dairy products intake
Milk and dairy products contain lactose, a disaccharide 
that is not well digested by an important proportion 
of adults worldwide
[7]. This phenomenon is attributed 
to low levels of the enzyme lactase in the intestinal 
mucosa of these people
[17]. Undigested lactose is 
cleaved by gut flora into short-chain fatty acids and 
gas (e.g., hydrogen), products that are likely to lead 
to GI symptoms in case of milk ingestion
[51]. Typical GI 
complaints of lactose intolerance are similar to those 
in IBS and include abdominal discomfort, bloating, and 
loose stools
[7].
Furthermore, many patients with IBS attribute 
symptoms to consumption of milk and dairy pro-
ducts
[10,52-54], but this self-reported intolerance does 
not always correlate with results from objective 
investigations, such as the hydrogen breath test
[52,53]. 
Some trials have noted an improvement in IBS 
symptoms in response to a lactose-free diet among 
a substantial proportion of patients
[55,56]. Despite 
This mechanism is up-regulated in patients with 
IBS
[38]. Duodenal lipids also enhance colorectal 
hypersensitivity with increased perception of rectal 
distension in IBS patients
[39,40]. Despite such complex 
laboratory studies, the evidence associating dietary 
fat intake to IBS is limited. In particular
, there are no 
reported RCTs to support that a reduction in fat intake 
would lead to symptoms improvement in IBS. 
A series of studies failed to identify differences in the 
intake of fat between IBS patients and controls
[11,41]. 
Furthermore, recent findings suggest even a putative 
positive effect of dietary fat in IBS
[42,43]. Polyunsaturated 
fatty acids and their metabolites can exhibit beneficial 
effects on intestinal inflammation
[42]. Given that low-
grade inflammation has been recently revealed as a 
mechanism involved in IBS
[43], the supplementation of 
polyunsaturated fatty acids in IBS patients warrants 
further research. 
Recommendations on fat intake in IBS, according 
to dietar­y guidelines and/or­ scientific liter­atur­e: 
(1) if related to IBS symptoms during or after eating, 
fat intake should be assessed, while ensuring the 
intake is in line with healthy eating guidelines
[12]. 
According to FAO/WHO dietary recommendations, the 
total fat intake for an adult should range from 30% to 
35% of total energy, without being under 15% of total 
energy
[44]; and (2) patients with IBS should be advised 
to limit fat intake to no more than 40-50 g/d
[17]. 
Dietary fiber intake
Although an increase in the intake of dietary fiber was 
long believed to improve IBS, particularly IBS-C
[45], 
this view has largely been revised. In some patients 
with IBS, the use of fiber may actually exacerbate 
symptoms and increase abdominal pain, bloating and 
distension
[46,47]. 
The efficacy of fibers in IBS has often been 
discussed in terms of soluble and insoluble fibers, 
with the recommendation to increase the intake of 
soluble fibers and decrease the intake of insoluble 
fibers, respectively
[46]. However
, this approach may 
no longer be suitable
[12]. Fibrous foods such as 
psyllium or oats have both attributes and most plant-
based foods contain mixtures of soluble and insoluble 
fibers
[24]. A more appropriate approach relies on the 
classification of fibers not only by solubility, but also by 
fermentability, viscosity, and gel formation, as follows: 
insoluble, poorly fermented (e.g., wheat bran), soluble, 
nonviscous, readily fermented (e.g., inulin), soluble 
viscous/gel forming, readily fermented (e.g., β-glucan), 
and soluble viscous/gel forming, nonfermented (e.g., 
psyllium)
[48]. The readily fermented fibers can lead to 
rapid gas formation, while the poorly fermented and 
nonfermented fibers often result in less flatulence
[48]. 
The role of fibers in IBS remains subject to ongoing 
debate with a lack of high-quality evidence and 
Cozma-Petruţ A et al. Dietary recommendations for IBS

such findings, all these trials were not blinded or 
controlled. The improvement of symptoms may be 
because some IBS patients have lactase deficiency
[17]. 
However
, lactase supplementation did not alleviate 
IBS symptoms in one small double-blind, placebo 
controlled study
[57].
It is also plausible to hypothesize that other milk 
components rather than lactose may play a role in IBS. 
For instance, it has been suggested that milk intolerance 
could in some cases be related to the ingestion of the 
protein A1 β-casein
[58]. During digestion, this protein 
releases β-casomorphin 7, which is known to exhibit GI 
effects
[58]. Indeed, further research studies are needed 
to elucidate the role of milk and dairy products in IBS. 
Recommendations on milk and dairy products 
intake in IBS, according to dietary guidelines 
and/or­ scientific liter­atur­e: (1) IBS patients should 
be advised to use a low-lactose diet only if they have 
a positive lactose hydrogen breath test
[12]; (2) If they 
wish to follow a milk-free diet, IBS patients should be 
informed that there is no high-quality evidence for 
this diet to improve their symptoms
[12]. In addition, 
patients should be informed that a milk-free diet could 
result in low calcium intakes and increase the risk of 
not meeting the daily calcium requirements
[11,12]; and 
(3) In patients with IBS where sensitivity to milk is 
suspected and a lactose hydrogen breath test is not 
available or appropriate, a trial period of a low lactose 
diet is recommended
[12].
Fluid intake
Despite no evidence from scientific research on the 
effect of fluid intake in IBS, current dietary guidelines 
recommend the daily consumption of up to 1.5-3 L 
of fluids
[12]. In particular
, an adequate fluid intake is 
suggested to improve stool frequency and decrease 
the need for laxatives in IBS-C
[12]. 
Water and other non-caffeinated drinks, for example 
herbal teas, are recommended as a beverage for 
patients with IBS
[13,59,60]. In contrast, carbonated water 
and other carbonated beverages should be avoided by 
IBS patients, because they may cause symptoms
[59,60]. 
One study reported more GI symptoms from 
carbonated beverages among IBS patients compared 
with controls
[25]. 
Recommendations on fluid intake in IBS, 
accor­ding to dietar­y guidelines and/or­ scientific 
literature: IBS patients should be advised to drink 
up to 1.5-3 L/d of fluids (about 35 mL/kg), especially 
water or other caffeine-free and alcohol-free non-
carbonated drinks (e.g., herbal teas)
[12,13]. 
Physical activity
Current dietary guidelines for IBS management
[13,21] 
include recommendations on physical activity. This 
is due to the fact that physical activity serves as a 
basic complement to the diet
[61]. Regular exercise 
is beneficial to health in general and recent data 
highlights its positive effects also for IBS patients
[62,63]. 
In several studies, mild physical activity has been 
reported to reduce IBS symptoms and enhance 
intestinal gas clearance, reduce bloating and relieve 
constipation
[64-67]. The practice of yoga has also been 
demonstrated to improve IBS symptoms in both adults 
and adolescents
[68,69].
Mechanisms suggested to underlie the benefits 
of physical activity in IBS are decreased splanchnic 
blood flow, neuroimmuno-endocrine alternations, 
increased GI motility and mechanical bouncing during 
movement
[70]. The impact of exercise on psychological 
symptoms has also been postulated as a potential 
mechanism and studies have reported positive effects 
on quality of life, fatigue, anxiety, and depression after 
moderate increase in physical activity in patients with 
IBS
[67]. 
Nevertheless, it should be taken into consideration 
that increased physical activity, particularly strenuous 
exercise, may actually worsen IBS symptoms. For 
example, moderate physical activity (e.g., brisk 
walking) has been reported to improve gut transit 
time, whereas vigorous physical activity (e.g., running) 
may act on the intestines as a stressor and result in 
“runners trots”
[71,72].
Recommendations on physical activity in IBS, 
accor­ding to dietar­y guidelines and/or­ scientific 
literature: (1) The physical activity levels of patients 
with IBS should be assessed, ideally using the 
General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire
[13]. 
IBS patients with low activity levels should be advised 
to increase their activity levels, while taking into 
account the needs, preferences and circumstances 
of each patient
[13]; and (2) IBS patients should be 
recommended to perform moderate physical activity, 
such as yoga, walking, cycling, or swimming, for at 
least 30 min a day, on 5 d of the week or more
[13,21].
SECOND-LINE DIETARY APPROACH IN 
IBS: THE LOW FOODMAP DIET 
There is a guideline consensus that in case IBS 
symptoms persist while following general diet and 
lifestyle advice, the second-line intervention in IBS 
dietary management should include advanced dietary 
manipulations to alleviate symptoms, such as the low 
FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, 
monosaccharides and polyols) diet
[12,13]. 
The term FODMAP reunites a collection of poorly 
absorbed short-chain fermentable carbohydrates 
that are naturally present in many foods, including 
fructans and fructo-oligosaccharides in garlic and 
wheat, galacto-oligosaccharides in legumes, lactose in 
dairy products, excess fructose in apples, and polyols 
Cozma-Petruţ A et al. Dietary recommendations for IBS

in stone fruits
[73]. FODMAPs can pass unabsorbed to 
the colon, where they increase luminal water through 
osmotic activity and induce gas production due to 
fermentation by colonic bacteria, which can result in 
luminal distension and GI symptoms in patients with 
IBS
[74-77]. Moreover
, recent studies show that the by-
products of the interaction between FODMAPs and 
gut microbiota act on intestinal stem cells, resulting 
in aberrant differentiation of these cells into endocrine 
cells and leading to an abnormal density of endocrine 
cells in the gut
[78]. GI endocrine cells regulate GI sen-
sitivity, motility, secretion, absorption, local immune 
defense, and appetite
[47]. Therefore, abnormalities in 
the GI endocrine cells may play a major role in the 
development of visceral hypersensitivity, dysmotility, 
and abnormal intestinal secretion, all being features 
observed in patients with IBS
[47,78].
Relying on the role of FODMAPs in IBS pathogenesis, 
the low FODMAP diet restricts the dietary intake of 
these carbohydrates with the overall aim to improve IBS 
symptoms. Foods are classified into “high FODMAP” and 
“low FODMAP” and the consumption of the latter foods 
is recommended within this dietary approach (Table 
1)
[24,79,80]. 
There is a growing body of evidence supporting 
the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet. Observational 
studies and RCTs have indicated that the low FODMAP 
dietary approach leads to symptom improvement in 
up to two-thirds of patients with IBS
[81-83]. Many IBS 
patients will respond within 1-2 wk of initiating the 
diet, whereas some can take 3-4 wk to respond
[84]. 
Reducing the intake of FODMAPs may be beneficial 
for patients suffering of abdominal pain, bloating, 
flatulence, or diarrhea
[85]. Although the low FODMAP 
dietary approach appears to benefit many IBS 
patients, a recent RCT reported similar efficacy with 
the low FODMAP diet and a diet based on traditional 
dietary advice for IBS (e.g., regular meal pattern, 
limiting intake of fat, caffeine, alcohol)
[86]. This provides 
support for further studies aiming to define the role of 
low FODMAP diet in the management of IBS. 
Furthermore, implementing low FODMAP diet can 
be challenging. One major challenge with this diet 
concerns adequate intake of fibers and calcium
[12,87,88]. 
Likewise, restricting the dietary intake of prebiotic 
fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides can alter 
luminal microbiota
[88,89]. Dietary counseling through a 
specialized dietitian is a key towards success of this 
fairly complex dietary approach
[12]. An experienced 
specialized dietitian can provide a detailed dietary plan 
that will ensure the low FODMAP diet is nutritionally 
adequate
[87]. Additionally, after good symptomatic 
response is achieved, the dietitian can help patients 
gradually reintroduce FODMAPs using a systematic 
food-challenge process to determine personal tolerance 
thresholds to individual foods
[12].
Recommendations on low FODMAP diet in IBS, 
accor­ding to dietar­y guidelines and/or­ scientific 
literature: (1) Low FODMAP diet needs to be provided 
by a healthcare professional with training in medical 
nutrition therapy and knowledge of food composition,

such as a specialized dietitian
[12,13]; (2) Low FODMAP 
diet should not be strictly followed over the long 
term
[84,89]. A restriction phase of minimum 3 or 4 wk 
is usually sufficient to obtain a clinical response
[12,84]. 
Then, FODMAP foods should be reintegrated in the 
diet to find the level of food restriction that the patient 
requires to properly control symptoms
[12,90]; and (3) 
If no symptom improvement occurs within 4 wk of 
strict adherence to the low FODMAP diet, then the 
intervention should be stopped and other therapeutic 
options considered
[12]. 
GLUTEN/WHEAT INTAKE IN IBS
The role of gluten in IBS is still unclear
. A considerable 
proportion of IBS patients report symptoms in 
response to ingestion of gluten, despite no evidence 
of having either celiac disease or wheat allergy, a 
phenomenon that received the nomenclature of “non-
celiac gluten sensitivity” (NCGS)
[91]. Some of these 
patients may respond to a gluten-free diet. Several 
interventions have reported that gluten restriction for 
4 to 8 wk improved IBS symptoms and reduced bowel 
movements per day and intestinal permeability
[92-94]. 
However
, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial 
effect of the gluten-free diet in IBS require further 
research. Wheat contains short-chain fructans as the 
main carbohydrate component
[73]. Therefore, there 
are reports suggesting that FODMAPs in wheat, rather 
than gluten, induce the GI symptoms in patients with 
IBS
[91]. Amylase trypsin inhibitors and wheat germ 
agglutinins have also been reported as components 
in wheat that may contribute to IBS symptoms
[95,96]. 
In this context, is has been recently suggested that 
“NCGS” is a misnomer
, as this term gives to understand 
that all symptoms patients experience following wheat 
ingestion are from gluten
[97]. It has also been indicated 
that a nomenclature more appropriate than NCGS 
would be “wheat intolerance” or “wheat sensitivity”
[ 97]. 
Recommendations on gluten intake in IBS, 
accor­ding to dietar­y guidelines and/or­ scientific 
literature: (1) If IBS patients wish to follow a 
gluten-free diet, they should be informed that the 
current evidence for its use is conflicting
[12]; and (2) 
If IBS patients decide to restrict gluten, they should 
be warned that an inappropriate gluten-free diet 
may be detrimental
[98]. Gluten-rich cereals are a 
valuable source of nutrients in the general diet, so 
their exclusion could potentially lead to nutritional 
deficiencies
[98].
PROBIOTICS SUPPLEMENTATION IN IBS
Gut microbiota in IBS patients may differ from those in 
healthy individuals, suggesting an association between 
microbiota and the pathophysiology of IBS
[99,100]. In this 
context, strategies aimed at modifying the microbiota in 
IBS patients have been increasingly explored in recent 
years
[101]. 
A particular interest has been given to probiotics. 
Evidence exists to suggest that probiotics may exert an 
effect in IBS through various mechanisms which target 
visceral hypersensitivity, GI dysmotility, intestinal 
barrier function, intestinal microbiota, and intestinal 
immune function
[102]. Several systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses have screened RCTs conducted on the 
effects of probiotics in IBS patients and demonstrated 
a beneficial effect of these organisms in the treatment 
of IBS
[103-105]. However
, it should be noted that the 
RCTs in these meta-analyses are somewhat difficult 
to compare. They are highly heterogeneous, show 
differences in the study design (size of the study, 
duration of the treatment) and use different probiotic 
species, strains, and preparations, some of which 
appear to be more effective for specific symptoms. For 
example, certain probiotics mainly reduce abdominal 
pain and flatulence
[106,107], some reduce bowel move-
ments
[108], whereas others have a positive effect on 
global symptoms
[109,110].
Despite these findings, in terms of type of probiotic 
to use (single species, strains, or mixtures), dosage 
to use and treatment duration, the optimal approach 
in IBS remains unknown
[111]. Thus, there is a clear 
need for further high-quality RCTs to provide additional 
information on the efficacy of probiotics as a therapeutic 
tool in the management of IBS symptoms. 
Recommendations on probiotics use in IBS, 
accor­ding to dietar­y guidelines and/or­ scientific 
literature: (1) Although probiotics seem to offer 
some benefit in IBS as a whole, the optimal approach 
in terms of which individual species, strains, or 
combinations to use, and at what dose and for what 
duration, remains unknown
[111]; and (2) IBS patients 
who choose to try probiotics should be advised to 
select one product at a time and monitor the effects
[12]. 
They should try it for a minimum of 4 wk at the dose 
recommended by the manufacturer
[12]. If within the 4 
wk treatment, the probiotic proves to be beneficial, the 
administration may be continued, although the long-
term effects are not known
[12]. 
IBS FOOD PYRAMID
Based on the current guidelines
[12,13,21] and the existing 
literature on dietary and lifestyle recommendations 
in IBS
[17,24,79,80], we developed the novel “IBS Food 
Pyramid” (Figure 1). It is a visual and user-friendly 
tool, to be used by healthcare professionals for the 
dietary counseling of IBS patients. The pyramid 
consists of nine levels. Within the pyramid, foods 
are arranged on the basis of recommended intake 
frequency in ascending order
, from the most to the 
least frequent.
At the base of the pyramid, on the first level, 
regular physical activity and good hydration are 
considered. Moderate physical activity is recommended, 
Cozma-Petruţ A et al. Dietary recommendations for IBS

June 7, 2017|Volume 23|Issue 21|
WJG|www.wjgnet.com
such as yoga, walking, cycling, and swimming
[13,21]. 
Recommendations related to frequency and duration, 
are at least 150 min per week, split into 30 min periods 
5 times per week
[13]. Moreover
, the consumption of 
1.5-3 L per day of water and other non-caffeinated, 
non-carbonated fluids is recommended and water is 
represented in the pyramid
[12,13].
On the next step, at the second level, are 
emphasized good eating habits that may favor the 
health status in IBS. The pictogram states the im-
portance of regular eating patterns
[12,13].
At the third level, cereals and cereal derivatives 
(e.g., bread, pasta) are shown. This group of foods 
provides a significant amount of the energy throughout 
the day
[62]. The recommended intake is 6 servings per 
day (1 serving = 40-60 g of bread or 60-70 g of pasta 
or rice)
[ 62].  
Vegetables occupy the next level. This food group 
is an important source of nutrients and bioactive 
compounds
[61]. The consumption of 3-5 servings per 
day (1 serving = 100-150 g) is recommended
[62].
At the fifth level, fruits are considered. Like vege-
tables, fruits are valuable sources of nutrients and 
bioactive compounds
[61]. The recommended intake is 
2-3 servings per day (1 serving = 80 g)
[13].
The sixth level shows high-protein foods, of either 
animal or non-animal origin, namely meat, fish, eggs, 
legumes, soy, nuts, and seeds. The recommended 
intake is 2-3 servings per day (1 serving = 100-125 
g of meat or 125-150 g of fish or 60-80 g of eggs or 
60-80 g of legumes or 20-30 g of nuts and seeds)
[62].
At the next level, the seventh level, the consumption 
of 2-3 servings per day of milk and dairy products is 
recommended (1 serving = 200-250 mL of milk or 
200-250 g of yogurt or 80-100 g of fresh cheese or 
30-50 g of hard cheese)
[62]. This group of food provides 
many nutrients, including important amounts of 
calcium
[11].
The eighth level is marked with the “consume in 
moderation” recommendation. This level includes 
potential IBS dietary triggers, namely fats, sweets, 
spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol. The total fat intake 
should be limited to no more than 50 g/d, while 
choosing healthy fats, like olive oil
[17,62]. Healthy sweets 
should be chosen and consumed sparingly (e.g., 
dark chocolate at 30 g per serving). Alcohol, caffeine, 
spicy foods should be restricted if they are related to 
symptoms
[12]. In the case of alcohol and caffeine, there 
is the recommendation to ensure the consumption is 
within the safe limits for the general adult population
[12].
The top of the pyramid, the ninth level, includes 
fried and processed foods, which should be removed 
from the IBS diet
 [21].
Furthermore, each food level contains examples 
Figure 1  Irritable bowel syndrome food pyramid. The pyramid was built upon the current dietary guidelines
[12,13,21] and the existing literature
[17,24,79,80] on diet and 
lifestyle recommendations in IBS. The pyramid consists of nine levels. At the base of the pyramid, it is emphasized the importance of regular physical activity, good 
hydration and healthy eating habits. Then, foods are arranged on the basis of recommended intake frequency in ascending order, from the most to the least frequent. 
Each food level also contains examples of what the patient can consume within a low FODMAP diet. A pictogram on the left side of the pyramid highlights the 
importance of seeking specialized dietary advice in case considering the low FODMAP dietary approach. The other pictograms on the left side are accompanied by 
recommendations on the intake of dietary fiber and administration of probiotics in IBS. Recommendations have associated superscript letters symbolizing the level of 
scientific evidence that supports them. IBS: Irritable bowel syndrome.

of what the patient can consume if deciding to follow 
a low FODMAP diet
[24,79]. A pictogram on the left side 
of the pyramid highlights the importance of seeking 
specialized dietary advice in case considering the low 
FODMAP diet
[12].
The other pictograms on the left side are referring 
to the intake of fibers and administration of probiotics, 
respectively. The intake of fiber is recommended, 
with emphasis on the intake of soluble fibers (e.g., 
psyllium)
[12,24]. Also, for IBS patients that decide to 
try probiotics, there is the recommendation to take 
the probiotic supplements daily, for at least 4 wk, at 
the dose recommended by the manufacturer
, to see if 
symptoms improve
[12]. 
Recommendations included in the pyramid are 
accompanied by superscript letters symbolizing the 
level of scientific evidence supporting them, as graded 
in the recently updated British Dietetic Association 
evidence-based practice guidelines for the dietary 
management of IBS in adults
[12]. The evidence 
reviewed within these guidelines was graded using 
the Practice-based evidence in nutrition (PEN) grading 
criteria, as follows: level A - supported by good 
evidence; level B - supported by fair evidence; level 
C - supported by limited evidence or expert opinion; 
level D - evidence is limited
[12].  
CONCLUSION
In recent years, dietary management has shown 
promise as a key tool in the treatment of IBS. A 
growing body of evidence exists to support the 
use of interventions such as the low FODMAP diet, 
although further well-designed, adequately powered, 
randomized controlled trials from around the world are 
needed to validate the efficacy of this dietary approach 
and assess its long-term benefits and safety. There 
is also ample room for improving the knowledge on 
other dietary approaches available to date, notably the 
first-line intervention on healthy eating and lifestyle, 
but also approaches such as the dietary restriction of 
gluten or the use of probiotics. Valuable data can only 
be obtained by future large, randomized controlled 
trials with rigorous end points.
