Invasive fungal infections cause significant morbidity and mortality among immunocompro-
mised individuals, posing an urgent need for new antifungal therapeutic strategies. Here we
investigate a chromatin-interacting module, the bromodomain (BD) from the BET family of
proteins, as a potential antifungal target in Candida albicans, a major human fungal pathogen.
We show that the BETprotein Bdf1 is essential in C. albicans and that mutations inactivating its
two BDs result in a loss of viability in vitro and decreased virulence in mice. We report
small-molecule compounds that inhibit C. albicans Bdf1 with high selectivity over human BDs.
Crystal structures of the Bdf1 BDs reveal binding modes for these inhibitors that are sterically
incompatible with the human BET-binding pockets. Furthermore, we report a dibenzothia-
zepinone compound that phenocopies the effects of a Bdf1 BD-inactivating mutation on
C. albicans viability. These findings establish BET inhibition as a promising antifungal
therapeutic strategy and identify Bdf1 as an antifungal drug target that can be selectively
inhibited without antagonizing human BET function.

nvasive fungal infections are a major global health concern,
with B2 million cases and 4800,000 deaths estimated
annually worldwide1. Candida species such as C. albicans
and C. glabrata are among the most significant human fungal
pathogens,
with
invasive
candidiasis
yielding
30–40%
mortality2,3. An increase in drug-resistant fungal strains and
the limited repertoire of available drugs has led to an urgent
need for novel therapeutic agents1,4–6. Promising results have
emerged from the study of chromatin-interacting proteins as
antifungal
targets,
including
histone
acetyltransferases
and
deacetylases7,8.
Histone
deacetylase
inhibitors
have
weak
antifungal activity when used alone but synergize with antifungal
drugs such as azoles and echinocandins8,9. Deletion of either the
histone deacetylase (HST3) or histone acetyltransferase (RTT109)
regulating histone H3 Lys56 acetylation (H3K56ac) in C. albicans
increases susceptibility to genotoxic and antifungal agents10. In a
study of the Mediator complex subunit Med15, which interacts via
its KIX domain with a transcription factor (Pdr1) implicated in
pleiotropic drug resistance in C. glabrata, drug-resistant strains
were re-sensitized to antifungals by a small-molecule inhibitor
targeting the KIX domain–Pdr1 interface11. These findings point to
an important role of chromatin-interacting proteins in fungal drug
susceptibility.
Here
we
investigated
an
epigenetic
reader
module,
the
bromodomain (BD) from the bromo- and extra-terminal domain
(BET) family, as a potential antifungal target in C. albicans. BET
proteins are chromatin-associated factors that regulate transcrip-
tion and chromatin remodelling12. Human BET family members
are Brd2, Brd3, Brd4 and Brdt. BET proteins bind chromatin
through their two BDs (BD1 and BD2), which specifically
recognize
histones
acetylated
on
lysine
residues.
Whereas
canonical BDs bind mono-acetylated histone peptides, BET BDs
possess a wider ligand-binding pocket allowing them to recognize
diacetylated peptides13,14. Small-molecule inhibitors, such as JQ1
and IBET, which selectively target BET BDs have been used to
validate BET inhibition as a therapeutic strategy against cancer,
cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disorders and other medical
conditions, with several inhibitors currently in clinical trials12,15–21.
The fungal BET protein Bdf1 has been characterized as a global
transcriptional regulator in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where it
regulates over 500 genes22. S. cerevisiae Bdf1 (ScBdf1) associates
with acetylated histones H3 and H4 (refs 22–24) and with the
general transcription factor TFIID25, and is a subunit of the
SWR1 chromatin remodelling complex24,26,27. ScBdf1 is also
important for chromatin compaction during sporulation28 and
for the salt stress response29. In addition to BDF1, S. cerevisiae
possesses a second BET gene, BDF2, which is partly functionally
redundant with BDF1 (refs 24,25,30,31). Disruption of BDF1
causes severe morphological and growth defects, while deletion of
both BDF1 and BDF2 is lethal22,23. Point mutations that abolish
ligand binding by ScBdf1 BD1 and BD2 cause growth and
sporulation defects24 and affect the majority of transcripts altered
by disruption of the entire gene22. Many pathogenic fungal
species (including C. albicans, C. glabrata, Aspergillus fumigatus,
Cryptococcus neoformans and Pneumocystis jirovecii) lack BDF2,
suggesting that inhibition of the sole BET family protein Bdf1
might significantly reduce viability and virulence32.
Here we demonstrate that Bdf1 BD functionality is essential in
C. albicans and identify small-molecule inhibitors that target Bdf1
BDs without inhibiting human BET proteins, establishing Bdf1
inhibition as a potential antifungal therapeutic strategy.
Results
C. albicans Bdf1 BDs bind multi-acetylated histone tails.
A phylogenetic tree of human and fungal BET proteins is shown
in Fig. 1a. The BDs from C. albicans Bdf1 (CaBdf1) share 31–46%
sequence identity with human BET BDs and 58–66% identity
with those from ScBdf1 and hence are likely to bind multi-
acetylated H3 and H4 tails (Fig. 1b). To verify this hypothesis, we
purified recombinant CaBdf1 BD1 and BD2 and assessed binding
to a microarray of human histone tail peptides bearing diverse
post-translational modifications. While H2A and H2B tail
sequences differ considerably between human and C. albicans,
those of H3 and H4 are nearly perfectly conserved, justifying use
of the array (Fig. 1c). As expected, CaBdf1 BDs showed weak
binding to mono-acetylated peptides and stronger binding to
peptides bearing two or more acetylation marks (Fig. 1d,e and
Supplementary Data 1). Of the two BDs, BD1 exhibited more
promiscuous binding, recognizing 14 distinct H3 and H4
acetylation patterns, versus only 7 for BD2. We replaced a con-
served tyrosine residue in the binding pocket of each BD by
phenylalanine, a mutation known to compromise ligand binding
in ScBdf1 (refs 22,23) (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). These two ‘YF’
mutations (Y248F and Y425F) abolished binding to all acetylated
peptides, confirming interaction specificity (Fig. 1d,e). For both
BD1 and BD2, the strongest binding was observed with an H4
peptide tetra-acetylated on lysines 5, 8, 12 and 16 (hereafter
denoted H4ac4). A pull-down assay confirmed H4ac4 peptide
recognition by both BDs, which was abolished by the YF
mutation (Fig. 1f). Interestingly, CaBdf1 BD1 and BD2 bound
tetra-acetylated H4 peptides with comparable strength (Fig. 1e),
in contrast with mammalian Brd2, Brd4 and Brdt, which bind
tetra-acetylated H4 more tightly through BD1 than through BD2
(refs 13,14), highlighting a certain redundancy in the ligand-
binding activity of the two CaBdf1 BDs.
Bdf1 BD functionality is essential in C. albicans. We next asked
whether Bdf1 BD function is important for the viability of
C. albicans. Although a heterozygous BDF1 deletion mutant
generated in strain SN152 (derived from SC5314) exhibited no
significant phenotype, we were unable to obtain a homozygous
bdf1D/D mutant, suggesting that BDF1 is essential. To confirm
essentiality we placed the remaining allele of the BDF1 gene in the
heterozygous strain under the control of a conditional promoter
and evaluated survival under repressive conditions. We used
either a methionine-repressible promoter or a newly engineered
tetracycline (Tet)-regulatable cassette compatible with animal
studies. Tet-dependent gene expression in C. albicans is usually
achieved by integrating a chimeric transactivator protein and a
Tet-responsive promoter independently into the genome33,34.
Here we constructed a cassette allowing integration of all required
components
in
a
single
step.
The
cassette
contains
the
transactivator (TetR-VP16), a selective marker (ARG4) and
seven
tandem
Tet-operator
elements,
which
we
inserted
upstream of the BDF1 open reading frame (ORF) to generate
strain Dbdf1/pTetO-BDF1 (Fig. 2a). Immunoblotting with a
polyclonal antibody developed in this study to allow specific
CaBdf1 detection (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d) confirmed that Bdf1
was expressed from the pTetO promoter in the absence of
doxycycline (Dox), albeit at a weaker level than from the
endogenous BDF1 promoter, and was effectively repressed in the
presence of Dox (Fig. 2b). Strikingly, the growth of strain Dbdf1/
pTetO-BDF1 mirrored these expression levels: compared to wild
type (WT), growth was reduced in the absence of Dox and
abrogated in its presence (Fig. 2c). The phenotype was rescued by
re-introducing a functional copy of BDF1 (strain BDF1-R/pTetO-
BDF1), confirming that BDF1 is essential in C. albicans.
To verify the importance of BD function for fungal growth, we
generated strains in which one or both Bdf1 BDs were inactivated
by domain deletion or by the YF point mutation while the other

 WT allele is expressed from the Dox-repressible promoter. Strains
in which both BDs were inactivated grew as poorly as the
conditional deletion mutant, whereas strains in which only BD1
or BD2 was inactivated displayed milder growth defects, with
BD2 inactivation yielding the more pronounced defect (Fig. 2d).
Additional assays evaluating stress resistance or cell wall integrity
did not reveal any significant phenotype. Growth rates in liquid
media recapitulated the phenotypes observed in the colony
formation assay (Fig. 2e). Analogous results were obtained when
BDF1 expression was repressed using the methionine-regulatable
promoter (Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, C. albicans viability
in vitro requires the presence of at least one functional BD within
Bdf1.
Bdf1 BDs are required for virulence in a mouse model. Using
our Tet-OFF system for Dox-repressible Bdf1 expression, we
verified the role of Bdf1 in a murine model of invasive candi-
diasis. Initially, mice were injected with either WT C. albicans, the
conditional BDF1 deletion strain (bdf1D/pTetO-BDF1) or the
rescue strain (BDF1-R/pTetO-BDF1). Mice injected with the WT
or
rescue
strains
exhibited
a
high
fungal
load
(4110,000 CFU g � 1) in the kidney 7 days post infection (Fig. 2f).
The fungal load observed with strain bdf1D/pTetO-BDF1 was
reduced by 30-fold (B3,500 CFU g � 1) in the absence of Dox and
was abolished in its presence, mirroring the growth phenotypes
observed in vitro (Fig. 2c). Subsequently, we evaluated the viru-
lence of strains in which both Bdf1 BDs were deleted or inacti-
vated by the YF point mutations (Fig. 2g). These strains exhibited
markedly reduced fungal loads (by B8,800- and 1,600-fold,
respectively), consistent with the in vitro growth rates associated
with these mutations (Fig. 2d,e and Supplementary Fig. 2). Hence,
Bdf1 BD functionality appears critical for the virulence of
C. albicans in vivo.
CaBdf1 BDs are resistant to human BET inhibitors. For Bdf1
inhibition to be a feasible antifungal therapeutic strategy, small-
molecule inhibitors need to discriminate fungal from human BET
BDs. To probe the similarity between the ligand-binding pockets
of C. albicans and human BET BDs, we asked whether human
BET inhibitors (BETi) could inhibit CaBdf1 BDs. We used a
homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay to eval-
uate the ability of four chemically diverse BETi compounds
(JQ1, PFI-1, IBET-151 and bromosporine) to inhibit BD binding
to an H4ac4 peptide (Fig. 3a). The four compounds inhibited
human Brd4 BD1 and BD2 with median inhibitory concentra-
tions (IC50 values) in the low nM range (3–95 nM), consistent
with previous reports16,35,36. In contrast, the CaBdf1 BDs were
relatively insensitive to these inhibitors, with IC50 values between
0.3 and 410 mM, or approximately a two- to threefold log-
reduction in sensitivity (Fig. 3b). These results were confirmed for
JQ1 by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC): whereas JQ1
bound Brd4 BD1 tightly (Kd of 62 nM), no binding was detected
for CaBdf1 BD1 or BD2 (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 1).
None of the BETi compounds significantly inhibited growth of
C. albicans in vitro at 10 mM concentration (Fig. 3d). This finding
is consistent with the poor IC50 values observed for JQ1 and PFI-
1 towards CaBdf1 BDs. It also indicates that IBET-151 and
bromosporine, which display (sub)micromolar IC50 values, have
poor cellular potency, possibly due to mechanisms known to
reduce drug potency in C. albicans, including cell wall and plasma
membrane permeability barriers37,38 and the activity of efflux
pumps leading to rapid drug extrusion39,40. In summary, CaBdf1
and human BET BDs have distinct BETi-binding activity,
supporting the feasibility of targeting CaBdf1 BDs with highly
selective small-molecule inhibitors.
BETi resistance by CaBdf1 is due to smaller pocket residues. To
identify features differentiating the ligand-binding pockets of
human and fungal BET BDs, we determined crystal structures for
CaBdf1 BD1 and BD2 (Supplementary Table 2). These structures
exhibit the canonical BD fold (comprising helices Z,A,B and C,
with the ZA and BC loops defining the ligand-binding pocket;
Fig. 4a) and closely resemble those of their human BET coun-
terparts (mean pairwise root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs)
r1.5 Å; Supplementary Table 3). The ligand-binding loops are
structurally well conserved, including nearly all water molecules
implicated in ligand recognition (Supplementary Fig. 3), although
the overall binding surfaces are less negatively charged in CaBdf1
(Fig. 4b). Superimposing the CaBdf1 BD structures onto that of
JQ1-bound Brd4 BD1 reveals no major steric clashes between JQ1
and the fungal BDs. However, whereas JQ1 fits snugly into the
Brd4-binding pocket, the fit with the CaBdf1-binding pockets is
poor. In Brd4 the fused ring system of JQ1 is sandwiched between
the ‘WPF’ shelf (Trp81, Pro82 and Phe83) and Leu residues 92
and 94, with the thiophene ring positioned within the ‘ZA
channel’ defined by Trp81 and Leu92 (ref. 41). Replacement of
Trp81 by a Val or Phe residue in CaBdf1 BD1 and BD2,
respectively, widens the ZA channel, resulting in a poorer fit
(black diamonds in Fig. 4c). Replacement of Brd4 residue Leu94
by a Val or Ile residue further contributes to the poor fit. In
addition, the p-chlorophenyl group of JQ1 occupies a groove in
Brd4, which is absent (BD1) or shallower (BD2) in CaBdf1
(asterisks in Fig. 4c). A similar lack of complementarity between
the ligand and binding pocket explains the insensitivity of CaBdf1
BDs towards PFI-1, IBET-151 and bromosporine.
More generally, recognition of the four BETi compounds by
human BET BDs involves 16 residues, including the eight
signature residues previously used to classify human BD-binding
sites42 (Fig. 5). Five of these residues in BD1 and four in BD2 are
invariant across human BET proteins but diverge in CaBdf1
(magenta arrows in Fig. 5), including the WPF-shelf Trp residue
and the Leu residue opposite this shelf, at signature positions
1 and 3, respectively. Remarkably, nearly all of these residues have
shorter side chains in CaBdf1 than in the human BET proteins,
implying that selective CaBdf1 inhibition could conceivably be
achieved via small molecules that clash sterically with the human,
but not fungal, side chains. Interestingly, other pathogenic fungal
Bdf1 sequences also diverge from human BET proteins at these
residue positions, suggesting that selective chemical inhibition
might also be feasible for these targets.
CaBdf1 BDs can be selectively targeted by small molecules. We
next set out to identify small-molecule inhibitors that would
target C. albicans Bdf1 BDs without inhibiting human BET BDs.
We used our HTRF inhibition assay to screen a library of
B80,000 chemically diverse compounds, resulting in several
hundred hits for each BD (Fig. 6a). Dose–response curves mea-
sured for CaBdf1 and Brd4 BDs identified 125 and 44 compounds
selective for the fungal BD1 and BD2, respectively. In particular,
several compounds possessing a dibenzothiazepinone scaffold
exhibited low-micromolar IC50 values towards CaBdf1 BD1 and
no or only weak inhibition of Brd4 BD1 at the highest
concentration (20 mM) tested. One such inhibitor was compound
1 (Fig. 6b). ITC measurements showed that 1 binds CaBdf1 BD1
with a Kd of 5 mM, consistent with the IC50 value (4.3 mM)
determined by HTRF, whereas no or only modest binding and
inhibition were detected for Brd4 BD1 and CaBdf1 BD2 (Fig. 6c,d
and Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, a BROMOscan screen
from DiscoverX revealed that compound 1 showed no significant
activity against 32 representative human (BET and non-BET)
BDs

Figure 3 | CaBdf1 BDs are resistant to BETi. (a) HTRF assay. A biotinylated tetra-acetylated histone H4 peptide is bound to streptavidin beads coupled to
the donor fluorophore. A GST-tagged BD is bound by an anti-GST antibody coupled to the acceptor fluorophor. Peptide binding by the BD results in FRET.
The addition of a BETi reduces FRET. (b) HTRF assays performed on BDs from CaBdf1 and human Brd4 in the presence of the indicated BETi. Inhibition
curves are shown as closed (BD1) and open (BD2) circles in green (Brd4) and magenta (Bdf1). IC50 values are listed below each graph. Data represent the

 confirmed that the two human BDs (SMARCA2 and SMARCA4)
with the strongest BROMOscan response did not detectably bind
compound 1 (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Compound 1 also exhib-
ited low cytotoxicity towards HeLa and IMR90 (primary fibro-
blast)
cells
as
measured
in
an
MTT
colorimetric
assay
(EC50Z100 mM; Supplementary Fig. 6).
To understand the molecular basis of selectivity we solved the
crystal structure of CaBdf1 BD1 bound to 1. Compound 1 mimics
the acetyllysine ligand by interacting with the conserved Tyr248
and
Asn291
residues,
forming
direct
and
water-mediated
hydrogen bonds via the thiazepinone carbonyl group (Fig. 6e–g).
The dibenzothiazepinone ring system engages hydrophobic
residues from the Val-Pro-Phe (VPF) shelf (Pro233), helix B
(Phe290) and the ZZ0 loop (Val238, Leu243 and Val245), while
the cyclopropyl group interacts with the VPF shelf (Pro233 and
Phe234), helix B (Cys287) and the gatekeeper residue on helix C
(Ile297). In contrast, the oxadiazole and pyrazine groups point
away from the pocket, adopting different orientations in the four
complexes
present
in
the
crystal’s
asymmetric
unit
(Supplementary Fig. 7). Superimposing the ligand-bound struc-
ture with that of Brd4 BD1 results in a steric overlap between the
larger Brd4 side chains at signature positions 1 and 3 (Trp81 and
Leu94) and the oxadiazole and distal benzene groups of
compound 1, explaining why 1 fails to inhibit the human BD
(Fig. 6f,h). Steric hindrance from the corresponding residues in
CaBdf1 BD2 (Phe409 and Ile422) also account for this domain’s
insensitivity to compound 1.
Similarly, we identified an imidazopyridine compound 2
(Fig. 7a), which inhibits CaBdf1 BD2 with high selectivity: HTRF
and ITC assays yielded IC50 and Kd values of 1.1 and 2.1 mM,
respectively, whereas human Brd4 BD2 and CaBdf1 BD1
were only weakly inhibited (IC50Z40 mM) (Fig. 7b,c and
Supplementary Table 1). Moreover, no significant inhibition of
any human BDs was observed for compound 2 by BROMOscan

 profiling and by an ITC assay on the two most sensitive BDs
identified
by
this
screen
(SMARCA2
and
SMARCA4;
Supplementary Figs 4 and 5b); while only mild cytotoxicity
was
observed
towards
mammalian
cells
(EC50
B60 mM;
Supplementary Fig. 6). The crystal structure of CaBdf1 BD2
bound to 2 reveals that the compound forms a hydrogen bond via
its amino group with the conserved Asn468 residue, as well as a
cation–pi interaction involving the phenolic ring and the partial
positive charge on Asn468 (Fig. 7d–f). However, unlike most BET
inhibitors, a water-mediated hydrogen bond with Tyr425 is not
observed for 2 (presumably because the ligand dislodges water
molecule 1, consistent with the dislodgement of this water by a
glycerol molecule in the unbound BD structure; Supplementary
Fig. 3d). Instead, the compound’s imidazolyl and hydroxyl groups
form water-mediated hydrogen bonds with backbone atoms of
the Phe-Pro-Phe (FPF) shelf (Pro410) and helix B (Val460).
Replacement of the hydroxyl group in 2 by a hydrogen (2a) or
fluorine (2b) atom severely reduces inhibitory activity, under-
scoring the importance of this group for high-affinity binding
(Supplementary Fig. 8). The methylpyridinyl and phenolic groups
are sandwiched between the FPF shelf and gatekeeper residue
Val474 on one side, and residues Val415 and Leu420 on the
other, while the tolyl group additionally contacts residues Ile422
and Phe467 (Fig. 7d–f). A structural alignment with Brd4 BD2
shows that larger Brd4 side chains at four of these contact
positions, including signature positions 1,3 and 5 (Trp374,
Leu387 and His437) and residue Tyr432 (Fig. 7e,g), reduces the
volume available for compound 2, explaining the inability of 2 to
inhibit the human BD. In contrast, the poor affinity for CaBdf1
BD1
is due to smaller side chains at signature positions 1 and 3
(Val232 and Val245), resulting in poor complementarity between
the binding pocket and ligand. The above results establish proof-
of-principle that CaBdf1 BDs can be selectively targeted by
small-molecule inhibitors in vitro without compromising the
function of human BD-containing proteins.
A Bdf1 BD1 inhibitor phenocopies genetic inactivation of BD1.
We next assessed the antifungal activity of compounds identified
in our screen by evaluating their effect on C. albicans growth in
liquid media. Not surprisingly, none of the compounds sig-
nificantly inhibited growth of the WT strain, consistent with the
fact that inactivating a single CaBdf1 BD only weakly affects
growth (Fig. 2d,e) and that none of the compounds tested can
individually inhibit both CaBdf1 BDs. Attempts to simulta-
neously inhibit both BDs by testing binary combinations of
compounds also did not result in significant growth inhibition.

conserved in at least three human BET sequences within each BD. The conserved Tyr and Asn residues involved in water-mediated and direct hydrogen
bonds to the ligand are shown in inverse font. Human BET BD residues interacting with BETi compounds through direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds
or through van der Waals contacts are indicated by asterisks, arrowheads and green circles, respectively. Interactions are taken from the crystal structures
of Brd4 BD1 bound to JQ1, IBET-762 or PFI-1 (PDB codes 3MXF, 3P5O and 4E96), from that of Brd2 BD1 bound to IBET-151 (PDB 4ALG), and from a
structural alignment of Brd4 BD1 with human BRPF1 BD bound to bromosporine (PDB 4C7N). The signature residues used to classify human BD-binding
sites are numbered 1–8 (ref. 42). Magenta arrows and boxes indicate BETi-contacting residues which are conserved in human BET proteins but differ in
CaBdf1 and other fungal sequences. Blue dots below the alignment indicate residues which are identical between BD1 and BD2 across human BET proteins
or within CaBdf1.

The
most
active
compound was dibenzothiazepinone 3, an analogue of 1 in
which the cyclopropyl, oxadiazole and pyrazine groups are
replaced by smaller methyl, carboxyamidyl and tetrahydrofuran
groups, respectively (Fig. 8a). HTRF and ITC assays showed that
3 inhibits CaBdf1 BD1 with low-micromolar affinity and three- to
fivefold selectivity relative to human Brd4 BD1 (Fig. 8b,c and
Supplementary Table 1). The crystal structure of CaBdf1 BD1
bound to 3 shows that the compound is slightly rotated within the
binding pocket compared to 1 (Fig. 8d). Consequently, in a
structural alignment with Brd4 BD1, the steric hindrance
observed for 1 due to the larger Trp81 and Leu94 side chains is
largely
relieved

compound
3,

 equally active, consistent with the lack of interaction between the
BD and the tetrahydrofuran ring; Supplementary Fig. 9). Liquid
culture assays show that 3 has little effect on the growth of
C. albicans strains expressing either WT Bdf1 or Bdf1 inactivated
in BD1, but significantly inhibited the growth of strains
inactivated in BD2 (Fig. 8e), consistent with the specificity of
compound 3 for BD1. A dose–response curve revealed a cellular
EC50 value of 35±7 mM, corresponding to a 20-fold cell shift
relative to the IC50 value determined by HTRF in vitro (or
sevenfold relative to the Kd by ITC) (Fig. 8f).
At this
concentration, compound 3 showed relatively little cytotoxicity
towards mammalian cells
(EC50 4100 mM; Supplementary
Fig. 6). Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility
of using a small-molecule inhibitor to antagonize CaBdf1
function in the fungal cell.
Discussion
We have shown that C. albicans BDF1 deletion is lethal and that
mutations
abolishing
BD-mediated
ligand-binding
activity
severely compromise growth (Fig. 2c–e), validating BET BD
inhibition as a potential antifungal strategy in C. albicans.
Whereas the combined inactivation of both CaBdf1 BDs is lethal,
that of a single BD leads to only a partial reduction in growth
(Fig. 2d,e and Fig. 8e). This likely reflects functional redundancy
between the two BDs, consistent with their similar binding
profiles towards acetylated H4 tails (Fig. 1d,e). Growth inhibition
appears slightly more pronounced on BD2 inactivation compared
to that of BD1 (Fig. 2d,e). This contrasts with the finding that the
selective inhibition of human BET BD2 in liver cancer cells
induced only minor effects on transcriptional regulation43 and
that BD1 plays a more important role than BD2 in Brdt-mediated
chromatin remodelling44, in recruiting Brd3 to acetylated sites on
GATA1 (ref. 45), and in chromatin binding by Brd4 (ref. 46).
This discrepancy may partly reflect differences between human
and C. albicans BET BD selectivity towards acetylated histone
peptides, as well as different histone acetylation patterns in these
species.
Because C. albicans strains inactivated in only one Bdf1 BD
remain viable, a chemotherapeutic strategy targeting CaBdf1
would likely require the inhibition of both BDs to be effective.
Such inhibition could be achieved via a single compound, which
targets
both BDs
or through
the combined
use
of
two
compounds, supplied independently or covalently linked as a
bivalent BD inhibitor. Indeed, dual-warhead BET inhibitors that
simultaneously engage both BDs within a single BET protein have
recently
been
described,
which
possess
greatly
enhanced
biochemical and cellular potency as well as increased efficacy
in animal disease models relative to monovalent inhibitors47–49.
Alternatively, one could envisage a Proteolysis Targeting Chimera
approach, whereby a single BD inhibitor conjugated to a ligand
for an E3 ubiquitin ligase would trigger the degradation of
CaBdf1, as recently demonstrated for human BET proteins50–53.
Compounds 1 and 2 target CaBdf1 BD1 and BD2, respectively,
with low-micromolar affinity, yet do not significantly inhibit
human BET or non-BET BDs, demonstrating that small-molecule
inhibition of CaBdf1 BDs can be achieved with high selectivity.
The selectivity of 1 and 2 for CaBdf1 results from steric
incompatibility with bulkier side chains in the human BET
BD-binding pockets, particularly at signature positions 1 and 3.
Remarkably, all 169 CaBdf1-selective hits identified in our screen
target either CaBdf1 BD1 or BD2, but not both, in contrast with
many BETi compounds, which inhibit both BD1 and BD2 in
human BET proteins. A likely explanation is that, whereas
residues at signature positions 1 and 3 are conserved between
human BET BD1 and BD2, they diverge between CaBdf1 BD1
and BD2, facilitating the identification of CaBdf1 inhibitors with
single BD selectivity (Supplementary Fig. 10). Nevertheless, an
inhibitor that targets both CaBdf1 BDs without inhibiting human
BET BDs is in principle achievable, because the WPF-shelf Trp
residue at signature position 3 in human BET BDs is bulkier than
the corresponding (Val and Phe) residues in both CaBdf1 BD1
and BD2. For example, medicinal chemistry optimization of
compound 2 could conceivably yield an analogue that would
inhibit both CaBdf1 BD1 and BD2 without losing selectivity
against human BET BDs.
Our chemical screen identified a dibenzothiazepinone com-
pound, 3, that selectively inhibited CaBdf1 BD1 and displayed
antifungal activity against susceptible strains. Although we were
unable to obtain biochemical evidence for a direct interaction
between 3 and Bdf1 in C. albicans cells, the different susceptibility
of Bdf1 mutant strains provides compelling evidence that Bdf1
BD1 is the intracellular target (Fig. 8e,f). Specifically, strains
expressing Bdf1 mutants in which BD1 was the lone functional
BD (mutants bdf1-bd2D and bdf1-Y425F) were sensitive to 3,
consistent with this compound’s selectivity for CaBdf1 BD1,
whereas all other strains with a functional BD2 were insensitive,
arguing strongly against a potential off-target effect. Strikingly,
compound 1 did not significantly inhibit growth, despite being an
analogue of 3 with nearly identical binding affinity for CaBdf1
BD1. This makes the dibenzothiazepinone an attractive scaffold
for structure–activity relationship studies, as these may reveal the
molecular determinants of a compound’s ability to reach its
intracellular target and thereby lead to analogues with improved
cellular potency.
In conclusion, Bdf1 BDs are required for the viability and
virulence of C. albicans and can be selectively targeted by small-
molecule inhibitors without compromising human BET BD
function. These findings pave the way for the development of
BET inhibitors as a novel class of antifungal therapeutics.
Methods
Chemicals. BET inhibitors PFI-1, IBET-151 and bromosporine were purchased
from Sigma while JQ1 was from Clinisciences (Nanterre, France). Compound 1
was purchased from ChemDiv as powder and dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) without further purification. Compounds 2 and 3 (the latter as the
racemate), initially purchased from ChemDiv, were resynthesized in our laboratory
where the individual enantiomers of 3 were also prepared (Supplementary
Methods) and used for all in vitro and cell-based assays. Derivatives 2a and 2b were
synthesized in our laboratory for this study (Supplementary Methods).
Protein expression and purification. Proteins used for crystallization and for ITC.
DNA fragments encoding CaBdf1 BD1 (residues 193–327) or BD2 (residues
386–491) and human Brd4 BD1 (residues 22–204) were PCR amplified from
genomic or cDNA libraries and cloned into a pETM11 vector as fusion constructs
bearing an N-terminal His tag followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease
cleavage site. (Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 4.) Transformed
E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (New England Biolabs, ref. C2527I) cells were grown in LB
medium containing kanamycin (50 mg ml � 1) at 37 �C until reaching an OD600 of 1,
induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and further incubated at 16 �C for 12–20 h before
collecting. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM
NaCl, 10% glycerol, 25 mM imidazole, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol and protease
inhibitors) and lysed by sonication. The cleared lysate was incubated with Ni-NTA
resin (Qiagen) and washed with buffer A containing 0.5 M NaCl. Proteins were
eluted with 250 mM imidazole, dialysed overnight in the presence of His-tagged
TEV protease against buffer A containing no imidazole and incubated with Ni-
NTA resin to remove His-tagged species. Proteins were further purified on a
Superdex 75 10/300 (GE Healthcare) column in 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Proteins were concentrated to 420 mg ml � 1
on a Centricon device (Millipore) and used for ITC, TSA and crystallization
experiments. Human SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 BD plasmids bearing an
N-terminal His tag and TEV protease site were purchased from Addgene (plasmid
no. 73250 and 74664, respectively). Expression and purification were performed as
above, except that buffer A was replaced by buffer B (50 mM Hepes pH 7.5,
500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mM imidazole and protease inhibitors) and gel fil-
tration was performed in 10 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl and 5% glycerol.
Proteins used for HTRF assays. GST-tagged human Brd4 BD2 (residues
349–460) was purchased from Reaction Biology Corp. Human Brd4 BD1 (residues

 22–204) and CaBdf1 BD1 (residues 193–327) and BD2 (residues 361–501) were
cloned into a pGEX4t1 vector as GST-tagged fusion proteins. Expression in E. coli
strain BL21(DE3) cells was performed as for His-tagged constructs. Collected cells
resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and protease inhibitors
were lysed by sonication. The clarified lysate was incubated with glutathione
sepharose (GE Healthcare) and then washed with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,
500 mM NaCl and 1% NP-40. Proteins were eluted with 10 mM glutathione and
further purified on a Superdex 75 10/300 (GE Healthcare) column in 50 mM Hepes
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT.
Pull-down and peptide array assays. Biotinylated peptides corresponding to
non-acetylated (H4ac0) and tetra-acetylated (H4K5acK8acK12acK16ac) histone
H4 tails were synthesized by Covalab (Villeurbanne, France) and immobilized on
Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1; Thermo
Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Beads were incubated with
1.25 mg of GST-tagged CaBdf1 BD1 or BD2 in binding buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 0.1%, NP-40, 10% glycerol 10%, 1 mM DTT) in a volume of 250 ml
for 2 h at 4 �C and subsequently washed in binding buffer containing 500 mM
NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS–PAGE sample loading buffer
and analysed by western blot using an anti-GST antibody (GE Healthcare).
Histone peptide arrays were obtained from Active Motif (ref. 13005) and used
in accordance with the supplier’s recommendations. In short, arrays were blocked
and incubated with 1 mM of purified CaBdf1 BD1 or BD2. Arrays were incubated
with recombinant BDs for 2 h at 4 �C in binding buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 7.4,
NP-40 0.1%, NaCl 150 mM, glycerol 10%). They were then washed in the same
buffer and binding detected by a standard western blot procedure using an anti-
GST antibody (Dutscher, ref. 27-4577-01). An antibody directed against a spotted
c-myc peptide (supplied with the MODified Array Labeling Kit (Active Motif,
ref. 13006) and used following the manufacturers’ instructions at 1/2,000 dilution)
was used as a positive control and its signal intensity was used for normalization.
Assays were performed in duplicate. Images were acquired on a Bio-Rad
ChemiDoc XRS Imaging machine and data were quantified using the array
analyser software provided by Active Motif. The results of the quantification are
summarized in Supplementary Data 1.
ITC. Calorimetric experiments were performed on a NanoITC calorimeter
(TA Instruments) at 25 �C while stirring at 250 r.p.m. All proteins were buffer
exchanged by gel filtration into 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT,
except for SMARCA2 and SMARCA4A BDs, which were exchanged into 10 mM
Hepes pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl and 5% glycerol. Typically, 10–100 mM compound
and 60–900 mM protein were placed in the cell and syringe, respectively. Titrations
consisted of an initial injection of 1.5 ml followed by 19 identical injections of 2.5 ml
made at time intervals of 5 min. ITC data were corrected for the heat of dilution of
injectant into buffer and analysed with software provided by the manufacturer
using a single binding site model. The first data point was excluded from the
analysis. Thermodynamic parameters determined from the ITC data are sum-
marized in Supplementary Table 1.
HTRF assay. Biotinylated and non-biotinylated tetra-acetylated H4 peptides
(H4K5acK8acK12acK16ac; denoted H4ac4) were synthetized by Covalab
(Villeurbanne, France). HTRF reagents and buffers were purchased from Cisbio
Bioassays and the assay performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Specifically, the assay used a terbium(III) cryptate donor reagent conjugated to an
anti-GST antibody (MAb anti-GST-Tb; ref. 61GSTTLA), a streptavidin-conjugated
acceptor reagent (streptavidin-d2; ref. 610SADLA) and Cisbio proprietary buffers
(EPIgeneous Binding Domain Diluent and Detection buffer; refs. 62DLBDDF and
62DB2FDG, respectively). Incubation with GST-tagged BDs and biotinylated
H4ac4 brings the donor and acceptor into close proximity and allows FRET. The
non-biotinylated H4ac4 peptide competes for binding and was used as a positive
control for inhibition. GST-tagged proteins in 25 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT were assayed at 5 nM final concentration. Biotinylated H4ac4
peptides were used at a final concentration of 50, 600, 300 or 400 nM in assays
involving Brd4 BD1, Brd4 BD2, CaBdf1 BD1 and CaBdf1 BD2, respectively. The
antibody-conjugated donor was used at 0.5 nM and the streptavidin-conjugated
acceptor was used at 1/8 of the H4ac4 peptide concentration. Inhibitors were tested
by performing a nine-point dilution series with a maximal final concentration of
10 mM (JQ1, IBET-151, PFI-1, bromosporine), 20 mM (1,3) or 40 mM (2). These
concentrations allowed the DMSO concentration to remain below the limit (1% for
CaBdf1 BD1 and Brd4 BD1, and 0.4% for CaBdf1 BD2 and Brd4 BD2) that allowed
the assay to maintain a Z0 factor54 Z0.8. Components were incubated at room
temperature for 1 h (CaBdf1 BD1 and Brd4 BD1) or at 4 �C for 6–24 h (CaBdf1
BD2 and Brd4 BD2). Experiments were performed in 384-well white plates
(Greiner 781080) in a volume of 20 ml and analysed in a ClarioStar plate reader
(BMG LABTECH). Excitation was at 330 nm and emission intensities were
measured at 620 and 665 nm (corresponding to the donor and acceptor emission
peaks, respectively; the 665/620 ratio is used to calculate the specific HTRF signal)
with an integration delay of 60 ms and an integration time of 400 ms.
High-throughput chemical screening. The HTRF assay described above was
miniaturized for performance in a 5 ml reaction volume in 1,536-well black plates.
Approximately 80,000 compounds comprising the soluble diversity (ChemDiv),
targeted diversity (ChemDiv) and 30 K diversity (LifeChem) collections were dis-
pensed into wells by an Echo acoustic liquid dispenser. A master mix comprising
MAb anti-GST-Tb donor, streptavidin-d2 acceptor, GST-tagged BD protein, bioti-
nylated H4ac4 peptide was then added and the plates incubated for 6–24h prior to
reading. The primary screen was performed with compounds at a final concentration
of 20mM (CaBdf1 BD1) or 8 mM (CaBdf1 BD2), corresponding to a final DMSO
concentration of 1% and 0.4%, respectively. Hits were initially confirmed by repeating
the assay at a single concentration in triplicate, and subsequently by dose–response
curves constructed using eight-point dilutions between 0 and 20 (or 8) mM.
BROMOscan profiling. BROMOscan profiling was performed by DiscoverX
(Fremont, CA, USA). T7 phage strains displaying BDs were grown in parallel
24-well blocks in an E. coli host derived from the BL21 strain as described55. E. coli
were grown to log-phase and infected with T7 phage from a frozen stock
(multiplicity of infection ¼ 0.4) and incubated with shaking at 32 �C until lysis
(90–150 min). The lysates were centrifuged (5,000g) and filtered (0.2 mm) to
remove cell debris. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with
biotinylated small molecule or acetylated peptide ligands for 30 min at room
temperature to generate affinity resins for BD assays. Ligand-loading densities were
optimized as described56. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and
washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM
DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific phage binding.
Binding reactions were assembled by combining BDs, liganded affinity beads and
test compounds in 1 � binding buffer (16% SeaBlock, 0.32 � PBS, 0.02% BSA,
0.04% Tween 20, 7.9 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 1,000 � stocks
in 100% DMSO and subsequently diluted 1:25 in monoethylene glycol. The
compounds were then diluted directly into the assays such that the final
concentrations of DMSO and monoethylene glycol were 0.1% and 2.4%,
respectively. All reactions were performed in polypropylene 384-well plates in a
final volume of 20 ml. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with
shaking for 1 h and the affinity beads were washed with wash buffer (1 � PBS,
0.05% Tween 20). The beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (1 � PBS,
0.05% Tween 20, 2 mM non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room
temperature with shaking for 30 min. The BD concentration in the eluates was
determined by qPCR. Compounds 1 and 2 were screened at 10 mM concentration
in duplicate. DMSO was used as a negative control and a small-molecule or peptide
ligand specific for each BD in the screen was used as a positive control. Results are
reported as percent control, where lower values indicate stronger inhibition.
Percent control was calculated as 100 � (t � p)/(n � p), where t is the test
compound signal and p and n are the positive and negative control signals,
respectively.
Crystallization and crystal structure determination. Initial crystallization con-
ditions were identified by the sitting drop vapour diffusion method at 4 �C using a
Cartesian PixSys 4200 crystallization robot at the high-throughput crystallization
laboratory of the EMBL Grenoble Outstation (https://htxlab.embl.fr). Crystals used
for data collection were obtained by the hanging drop method at 4 �C by mixing
1 ml of the protein or protein/inhibitor sample with 1 ml of the reservoir solution, as
follows. Unbound CaBdf1 BD1 (40 mg ml � 1) was mixed with 0.2 M ammonium
iodide (pH 6.5) and 26% (w/v) PEG 3350. Unbound CaBdf1 BD2 (40 mg ml � 1)
was mixed with 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 1 M ammonium phosphate. CaBdf1
BD1 bound to compound 1 was crystallized by mixing a solution of 20 mg ml � 1
protein and 0.4 mM inhibitor with 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 23% (w/v) PEG MME
2000 and 10 mM NiCl2. CaBdf1 BD1 bound to compound 3 was crystallized by
mixing a solution of 25 mg ml � 1 protein and 1.5 mM inhibitor with 0.1 M sodium
acetate (pH 4.6) and 2.4 M ammonium sulfate. CaBdf1 BD2 bound to compound 2
was crystallized by mixing a solution of 22 mg ml � 1 protein and 1.5 mM inhibitor
with 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.6) and 25% (w/v) PEG 3000. Crystals were flash-
cooled in liquid nitrogen after being transferred into the well solution supple-
mented with the following cryo-protectants: unbound CaBdf1 BD1, unbound
CaBdf1 BD2 and CaBdf1 BD1 bound to 1, 30% (v/v) glycerol; CaBdf1 BD1 bound
to 3(S), 3.2 M ammonium sulfate; CaBdf1 BD2 bound to 2, 25% (v/v) glycerol.
Diffraction data were collected at beamlines of the European Synchrotron
Radiation Facility (ESRF), as indicated in Supplementary Table 2. Data collected on
MarMOSAIC (ID23-2), Pilatus 6M (ID29) and Pilatus3 2M (ID30A-1) detectors
were processed using X-ray Detector Software (XDS)57 and programmes of the
CCP4 suite58. Structures were solved by molecular replacement using Phaser59.
Structures 2OSS and 2OUO (human Brd4 BD1 and BD2, respectively) were used as
search models to solve the structures of CaBdf1 BD1 and BD2, respectively. Initial
solutions were improved by automated protein chain tracing with ARP/WARP60,
followed by further manual building using Coot61. Inhibitor coordinates and .cif
restraints files were generated using the Cactus online SMILES translator
(https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/translate/) and JLigand62, respectively. Structures were
refined with Phenix63 and validated using MolProbity64 and the built-in tools in
Coot. Examples of final 2Fo-Fc electron density are provided in Supplementary
Figs 11 and 12. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in
Supplementary Table 2.

 Cytotoxicity assays on human cells. Proliferation of human cells was assessed
using an MTT colorimetric assay (Cell Proliferation Kit I, Roche). HeLa
(epithelial cells, ATCC number CCL-2) and IMR90 (primary fibroblasts cells,
ATCC number CCL-186) cells were cultured in humidified atmosphere (37 �C and
5% CO2) in DMEM medium containing 10% heat inactivated foetal calf serum and
2 mM glutamine. Cells were seeded at a concentration of 5,000 HeLa cells per well
or 15,000 IMR90 cells per well in 100 ml culture medium containing the test
compound (compounds 1,2,3, amphotericin B or fluconazole) into 96 wells
microplates (Falcon ref. 353072). Plates were incubated at 37 �C and 5% CO2 for
28 h before adding 10 ml of MTT labelling reagent (final concentration
0.5 mg ml � 1) to each well. After incubating for a further 4 h, 100 ml of the solu-
bilization solution were added in each well. Plates were allowed to stand overnight
in the incubator before measuring the spectrophotometrical absorbance at 570 nm
and at the reference wavelength of 690 nm in a ClarioStar plate reader. The values
of A570 nm–A690 nm were normalized relative to that obtained with vehicle
(0.2% DMSO) and plotted against compound concentration.
Generation of C. albicans mutant strains. Plasmids used in this study to
incorporate different mutations into the BDF1 gene are listed in Supplementary
Table 5. All DNA fragments were fused in a pCR2.1-TOPO vector using a Gibson
assembly kit (New England Biolabs) and validated by sequencing. The pMET3
promoter sequence was recycled from the plasmid pFA-ARG4-MET3p (ref. 65).
The pTetO cassette (Fig. 2a) was generated by assembling the following fragments
with the Gibson assembly kit (New England Biolabs) in a pCR2.1-TOPO vector:
(i) ARG4 gene from the plasmid pFA-ARG4-MET3p (ref. 65); (ii) a Tet-dependent-
transactivation protein (TetR-VP16) obtained by gene synthesis with corrections
for the genetic code of the CTU clade (Thermo), flanked by the promoter (500 bp)
and terminator (500 bp) of the C. albicans TDH3 gene; (iii) the repressible
Tet-operator (pTetO) from the plasmid pCM184 (ref. 66). In this study, B500 bp
homologous regions were used to integrate the pTet cassette upstream of the BDF1
ORF. The BDF1 point mutant cassettes were obtained using the QuikChange site-
directed kit (Agilent) with the BDF1 plasmid pJG214 or pJG215. All cassettes were
obtained by digesting 4 mg of the pCR2.1-TOPO plasmids and were transformed in
C. albicans by a lithium acetate procedure, as previously described67. Mutations
introduced in the BDF1 gene in C. albicans were confirmed by PCR, sequencing of
the mutated region in the genomic DNA and western blot. C. albicans strains used
in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 6.
Growth assays. Growth on solid media. C. albicans strains were grown in SC media
to an OD600 of 0.5–0.8, pelleted and resuspended in sterile water at a final OD600 of
0.13. Cells were spotted on solid media in a threefold dilution series starting at an
OD600 of 0.13. Plates were incubated at 30 �C for 1 day before imaging. Stress
resistance was tested using the following conditions: H2O2 (4.5 and 6 mM), methyl-
methanesulfonate (0.005 and 0.02%), hydroxyurea (10mM), nicotinamide (0.5, 1, and
4 mM), caffeine (15mM), sorbitol (1, 1.5 and 2 M), Congo red (50 mg ml � 1), cal-
cofluor white (20mM), SDS (0.04%) and heat shock at 42�C.
Growth on liquid media. C. albicans strains were grown at 30 �C in SC medium
to an OD600 of 0.5–0.8. For the evaluation of growth defects related to Bdf1
mutations, log-phase growing cells were counted using a Neubauer chamber and
diluted in liquid media to a final concentration of 5,400 cells per ml per well in a
sterile 96-well plate. Dox (50 mg ml � 1) or methionine (5 mM)/cysteine (0.25 mM)
were added to the media if required. Plates were incubated at 30 �C and OD600 was
measured using a Multiskan FC Microplate Photometer (Thermo Fisher). For
the evaluation of chemical compounds, strains were grown in SC medium
supplemented with 50 mg ml � 1 Dox or 5 mM methionine/0.25 mM cysteine 24 h
before counting and then seeded in 96-well plates at the same concentration as
mentioned above, with or without chemical compounds. Statistical tests were
performed using two-sided Welch t-tests.
Analysis of whole-cell extracts and antibodies. C. albicans strains were grown at
30 �C in SC media to an OD600 of 0.5–0.8. Cells were lysed in FastprepTM
(MPBiologicals) twice at 6.5 m s � 1 for 1 min with intermediate incubation on ice.
Histone H4 antibody was purchased from Active Motif (ref. 39269) and the CaBdf1
antibody was developed in house using a full-length recombinant protein injected
in rabbits (Covalab).
Mouse experiments. A mouse model of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis
was used, as approved by the French National Animal Experimentation Ethics
Committee (reference B385161006) under the file reference 2015042015538706 v4
(AFAPIS#644). Candida strains were inoculated from an overnight subculture in
liquid yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD). In each condition, six female BALB/c
mice (8 weeks old) were injected in the lateral caudal vein with 2 � 105 cells of a C.
albicans suspension. If necessary, Dox repression was added to the drinking water
starting at 48 h before the injection until the day of killing. To limit severity and
duration of pain, a pilot experiment established an end point 7 days post infection,
when the virulence of each strain was assessed by kidney fungal burden evaluation,
as described before68,69. Briefly, mice were killed, left kidneys were removed
aseptically and weighed, and homogenized suspensions were cultured to evaluate
colony-forming units (CFU). The final results were expressed as log CFUs per gram
of tissue and statistically tested using two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests with
continuity correction.
Statistics. Each statistical test is indicated in the legend of the corresponding
figure and has been chosen for its compliance with the sample size. Sample size for
mouse experiments was chosen as the best compromise between statistical power
and regulations of the French National Animal Experimentation Ethic Committee.
No inclusion/exclusion criteria were pre-established. Animal studies were neither
randomized nor performed blinded.
Data availability. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the
Protein Data Bank with accession codes 5N15 (unbound CaBdf1 BD1), 5N16
(CaBdf1 BD1 bound to 1), 5N17 (CaBdf1 BD1 bound to 3), 5N13 (unbound
