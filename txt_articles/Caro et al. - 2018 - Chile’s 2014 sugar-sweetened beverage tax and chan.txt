Abstract
Background
On October 1, 2014, the Chilean government modified its previous sugar-sweetened bever-
age (SSB) tax, increasing the tax rate from 13% to 18% on industrialized beverages with
high levels of sugar (H-SSBs) (greater than 6.25 grams [g] sugar/100 milliliters [mL]) and
decreasing the tax rate from 13% to 10% on industrialized beverages with low or no sugar
(L-SSBs) (less than 6.25 g sugar/100 mL). This study examines changes in beverage prices
and household beverage purchases following the implementation of the tax reform.
Methods and findings
We used longitudinal data collected between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015,
from 2,000 households. We defined the pretax period as January 1, 2013, to September 30,
2014, and the posttax period as October 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015. We conducted a
pre–post analysis for changes in prices and purchases, with the latter examined by volume
and calories. We compared posttax changes in prices and purchases to a counterfactual,
defined as what would have been expected in the posttax period based on pretax trends. All
results are stated as comparisons to this counterfactual. We linked beverages at the bar
code level to nutrition facts panel data collected by a team of Chilean nutritionists who cate-
gorized them by taxation level and beverage subcategory, which included carbonated and
noncarbonated H-SSBs and concentrated, ready-to-drink L-SSBs and untaxed beverages.
We reconstituted concentrated beverages and analyzed all beverages using as-consumed
volumes and calories. Posttax monthly prices of H-SSBs increased, but these changes
were small. Prices of carbonated H-SSBs increased by 2.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]
1.0%–3.0%), while those of noncarbonated H-SSBs increased by 3.9% (95% CI 1.6%–
6.2%). Prices of L-SSB concentrates decreased after the tax by 6.7% (95% CI −8.2%–

 −4.6%), and prices of ready-to-drink L-SSBs increased by 1.5% (95% CI 0.3%–2.7%).
Households decreased monthly per capita purchases of H-SSBs by 3.4% by volume (95%
CI −5.9%–−0.9%) and 4.0% by calories (95% CI −6.3%–−1.9%), and this change was
greater among high socioeconomic status (SES) households. The volume of household pur-
chases of L-SSBs increased 10.7% (95% CI 7.5%–13.9%), while that of untaxed beverage
purchases decreased by 3.1% (95% CI −5.1%–−1.1%). The main limitation of this study
was that there was no control group, so we were unable to assess the causal impact of the
tax.
Conclusions
The modifications of Chile’s SSB tax were small, and observed changes in prices and pur-
chases of beverages after the tax were also small. Our results are consistent with previous
evidence indicating that small increases in SSB taxes are unlikely to promote large enough
changes in SSB purchases to reduce obesity and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes have emerged as a strategy to prevent a continued
rise in obesity prevalence and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).
• Recent studies in Mexico and the United States have shown that SSB taxes are associated
with increased prices of taxed beverages and reduced purchases of those beverages, par-
ticularly among households of low socioeconomic status (SES).
• Little evidence exists on the effects increasing or decreasing an existing SSB tax has on
beverage prices and purchases.
• On October 1, 2014, Chile increased its tax on industrialized beverages with high levels
of sugar (H-SSBs) from 13% to 18% and reduced its tax on industrialized beverages with
low or no sugar (L-SSBs) from 13% to 10%. Beverages such as plain and flavored milk,
100% fruit juices, and unflavored water remained untaxed.
• Understanding the effects of changes to existing SSB taxes is critical for informing future
SSB tax policy.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We used a pre–post design to estimate changes in prices and purchases (volumes and
calories) of beverages in Chile after the October 1, 2014, modifications of SSB taxes
with data collected from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015. We compared observed
posttax changes in beverage prices and purchases to the counterfactual, or what would
have been expected in the posttax period based on pretax trends. All results are stated in
terms of a comparison to this counterfactual.
• Our model links household beverage purchase data to nutrition facts panel data using
bar code information to classify each beverage purchased by tax level and subcategory.

 • We found that after the tax increase on H-SSBs, prices of H-SSBs increased, although
the increases were small. In contrast, after the tax decrease on L-SSBs, prices decreased
in some categories but increased in others. Prices of untaxed beverages also increased.
• After the tax increase on H-SSBs, purchases of H-SSBs decreased, although the declines
were small. After the tax decrease on L-SSBs, purchases of L-SSBs increased. Despite no
change in the tax rate, purchases of untaxed beverages decreased.
• High-SES households showed larger declines in purchases of H-SSBs after the tax than
did low-SES households.
What do these findings mean?
• After a small increase in the tax rate on H-SSBs, changes in prices and purchases of
these beverages were small. This is consistent with previous evidence indicating that
small increases in SSB taxes are unlikely to produce large changes in SSB purchases. Fur-
ther evidence is needed to understand the small change in prices due to the tax reform.
• High-SES households showed larger declines in purchases of H-SSBs than did low-SES
households. Further research is needed to understand the differential response to this
tax by SES.
• After a decrease in the tax rate on L-SSBs, purchases of these beverages increased a large
amount. Further research is needed to understand the health consequences of the shift
toward these beverages, which frequently contain artificial sweeteners.
Introduction
In response to the increasing global burden of obesity and related chronic diseases in the last
decade, taxes on industrially produced sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) have emerged as a
regulatory strategy to prevent the continued rise of obesity [1,2]. Research has shown that rais-
ing the prices of SSBs leads to significant decreases in SSB purchases [3–6], and recent studies
in Mexico and cities in the US (e.g., Berkeley and Philadelphia) indicate that SSB taxes reduce
purchases of SSBs, with a larger impact among lower socioeconomic status (SES) populations
[7–11].
However, limited evidence exists on the impact of tax rate changes to existing SSB taxes.
In high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries with rapid income growth,
households might be unaware of small changes in tax rates due to higher median incomes, and
commercial beverage companies might choose not to switch prices proportionally to the tax
change [12]. In addition, access to safe tap water could affect choices available to consumers.
For example, in Mexico, which leads in bottled water consumption worldwide [13] and has rel-
atively limited access to safe tap water in many areas, the main substitution for SSBs in the first
year after the tax implementation was water purchases [9]. In contrast, in high-income coun-
tries, free, clean water is readily available.
Chile, recently categorized as a high-income country, is an interesting case study to explore
changes in prices and purchases after a change in the SSB tax rate. Chile has a high prevalence
of obesity and type 2 diabetes [14–16] and recently became the country highest in SSB sales

 per capita [17]. Beverage taxes in Chile have a long history beginning in 1979, when the Chil-
ean government introduced specific ad valorem taxes on alcoholic and nonalcoholic industri-
alized beverages. Beverage concentrates and all ready-to-drink industrialized beverages with
any artificial flavoring, sweeteners, or dyes were subject to a common 15% tax rate. In 1985,
the tax rate was cut to 13%. Roughly 30 years later, Chile modified its beverage tax again as
part of a major tax reform that was announced and introduced in April 2014, approved in Sep-
tember 26, 2014, and implemented on October 1, 2014. This tax reform included an increase
in the SSB tax rate that was intended to reduce purchases of SSBs and prevent continued
increases in obesity and related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). As a result, the tax rate
on SSBs with greater than 6.25 grams (g) of sugar per 100 milliliters (mL) (e.g., sodas, industri-
alized juice drinks) increased from 13% to 18%. For SSBs with less than 6.25 g sugar per 100
mL (including powdered and concentrated beverages with added sugar and beverages contain-
ing artificial sweeteners, flavors, or dyes), the tax rate was reduced to 10%. Other beverages,
such as plain milk and flavored sweetened milk-based drinks, 100% fruit juices, and unflavored
water, remained untaxed.
The Chilean SSB tax structure is unique for two reasons. First, it creates a price differential
between high-sugar and low-sugar SSBs, and second, it taxes beverages with artificial sweet-
eners (such as diet soft drinks) and flavored unsweetened beverages. In contrast, the SSB
taxes in both Berkeley and Mexico apply a single rate to all nondairy and nonalcoholic bever-
ages containing added sugar and do not apply to beverages with zero added sugar or those
that contain only artificial sweeteners. The Philadelphia SSB tax is similar to Chile’s in that it
also applies to artificially sweetened beverages but different in that it applies a single rate to
all taxed beverages, regardless of sugar level. The United Kingdom SSB tax is also two tiered,
with high-sugar SSBs taxed at a higher rate than low-sugar SSBs. However, this tax is based
on the added sugar content of the beverage, and thus, artificially sweetened beverages con-
taining no added sugar are not taxed. To our knowledge, the Chilean tax is the first that
applies a two-tiered rate to SSBs and includes any artificially sweetened or flavored unsweet-
ened beverages.
It is unclear how changing an existing SSB tax affects prices or purchases compared to the
introduction of a new tax. Small sales taxes on SSBs (mean 5.2%) in jurisdictions across the
US suggest that small relative increases in the tax rate may not lead to meaningful changes in
sweetened beverage consumption [18,19]. However, these sales taxes are applied at the check-
out and thus may not affect consumer purchasing decisions, whereas the Chilean SSB tax is
included in the shelf prices of beverages. Understanding how relatively small increases in an
SSB tax affect prices and purchases is critical to inform future SSB taxation policy.
The objectives of this study are to (1) analyze whether the average prices of beverage pur-
chases changed after the tax implementation and (2) analyze whether the volumes and calories
from beverage purchases changed after the tax implementation, controlling for household
covariates and secular trends overall and by SES.
Methods
Data set
We used a longitudinal data set of household food purchases from January 2013 to December
2015 that we obtained from Kantar WorldPanel Chile (see the STROBE Checklist in S1 Table).
The data are based on weekly purchases of fast-moving consumer goods by households from
cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants, representing 74% of the urban population. The total
sample is 2,000 households. Interviewers visited households weekly to collect data on food pur-
chases using a handheld bar code scanner. First, information on purchases was collected either

 by scanning products’ bar codes on the packages or by using a codebook to assign bar codes
tor bulk products or other products without bar codes. Second, households were instructed
to keep all receipts so that interviewers could match purchases each week and determine the
store where they were purchased (specifically for frequently consumed products). Finally,
interviewers checked household pantries, and households stored empty product packages in a
bin between interviews to ensure that products were not counted twice. Information collected
for each beverage purchase included volume or weight, bar code expenditure, price per unit,
retail channel, brand, package size, and date of purchase. A comparative analysis using the
2011–2012 Household Budget and Expenditure survey showed that households in the Kantar
WorldPanel represent the average purchases of urban households [20].
Nutrient profile information and tax categorization.
The data on each beverage pur-
chase were linked at the bar code level to a nutrition facts panel gathered from photographs
that a team of Chilean nutrition research assistants collected directly at stores (79.8% of prod-
ucts) [21–26], Mintel Latin America (19.9%), or Mintel North America (0.2%) or imputed
with a systematic match based on similar products using package description, brand, and
manufacturer (less than 0.1% of each beverage category). Master’s-level Chilean nutritionists
employed by the University of North Carolina categorized each beverage purchase into mutu-
ally exclusive categories within each tax group. Hereinafter we refer to any industrialized bev-
erages with less than 6.25 g sugar/100 mL (and therefore subject to the 10% tax rate) as low- or
no-sugar sweetened beverages (L-SSBs). We refer to industrialized beverages with greater than
6.25 g sugar/100 mL (subject to the 18% tax rate) as high-sugar sweetened beverages (H-SSBs).
All beverages exempted from the tax we classify as untaxed. We further separated L-SSBs
based on whether they were sold as concentrated (including powders) or ready to drink. We
reconstituted products purchased in powder or concentrated form to their ready-to-drink vol-
umes and calories. All H-SSBs were ready to drink, and we categorized them by carbonated or
not. We consulted Ministry of Finance staff on categorizations in cases where the appropriate
category was unclear.
The final categorization within each tax group follows. Untaxed beverages: plain water,
plain and flavored or sweetened milk, dairy-based ready-to-drink beverages, milk powders
and modifiers (such as cocoa), coffee, and tea. Ten percent–taxed beverages: ready-to-drink
L-SSBs and L-SSB concentrates. Eighteen percent–taxed beverages: noncarbonated H-SSBs
and carbonated H-SSBs (S2 Table). While we analyzed untaxed beverages as a single group
due to the low frequency of purchases among some subcategories, we analyzed beverages
taxed at 10% and 18% by subcategory and by overall taxation level. As noted, all taxed catego-
ries were subject to a 13% tax rate prior to October 2014.
Socioeconomic covariates.
Following the protocol of the Chilean Association of Market
Research, we categorized households into four SES categories using the data Kantar World-
Panel Chile provided [27]. For simplicity, we report results of all analyses by SES in two
groups: high SES (high and midhigh) and low SES (midlow and low). Other relevant house-
hold characteristics include household composition (total number of household members
overall and numbers by gender and age groups), household head’s education level and work-
ing status, and household geographic region (divided into six zones based on the Kantar
sample design).
In addition, because trends in income, economic activity, and other market factors could
influence the price and quantity of beverage purchases [28], we controlled for several macro-
economic measures at the region-month level, including unemployment rate, population (in
thousands), construction permits (meters2) as a predictor of economic activity [29], the Super-
market Sales Index, and the Regional Economic Index, using official figures from the Chilean
National Institute of Statistics [30].

 Price indexes
For the price analysis, we sorted brands within each beverage subcategory based on their average
market shares (i.e., the monthly average proportion of total sales) during the 2013–2015 period.
We aggregated brands with market shares lower than 3% into a combined brand within each
category. Brands with more than a 3% market share remained separate. We then classified prod-
ucts by market share as either low (less than or equal to 10% market share) or high (greater than
10% market share). Next, we defined package sizes for each individual brand. Ready-to-drink
beverages we categorized as small (less than 2,500 mL) or large (greater than or equal to 2,500
mL). Beverages sold as liquid concentrates, powders, or dry leaves we categorized as small (less
than 5 liters [L], diluted) or large (greater than or equal to 5 L, diluted). Hereinafter we refer to a
product as the unique combination of brand and package size within each beverage category.
Market price aggregation
Our analysis used data on beverage prices as reported directly by households. Unlike data on
prices collected from food stores, prices obtained from purchase data not only reflect changes
in prices due to industry behavior but also differences in household preferences for certain
beverage types or geographic differences in what products are available in the store (e.g., local
brands may be available in some regions but not in others) [31]. In other words, the only prices
captured are for beverages that are purchased, making it difficult to analyze whether the indus-
try changed shelf prices in response to the tax modification. To deal with this complexity, we
attempted to approximate prices consumers would see in a store by exploiting the geographic
and socioeconomic variations across households. We defined a market as the pool of unique
purchases that belong to the same region and SES group in the same month (using the product
classifications described above). Thus, the average product-level prices in each market reflect
the average price in a month for a given product that a household of a given SES and region
would be likely to see in a store. We excluded from the analysis products that were not pur-
chased both before and after the tax implementation (0.4% of all observations).
Descriptive statistics
First, we examined sociodemographic characteristics of the households participating in the
survey by SES status and separated households that exited the sample at any point between
2013 and 2015. Next, we calculated the average and median adjusted real prices at the market-
month level, including the number of products within each beverage category. Finally, we cal-
culated average purchases by household/month both by volume (mL) and calories (kilocalories
[kcal]) purchased per capita per day for each beverage category and the percentage of nonzero
household/month observations.
Analysis plan
We conceived the initial study design in early July 2016 and purchased the Kantar data at the
end of the same month. Between July 2016 and May 2017, master’s-level nutritionists cleaned
and categorized the data, and we conducted descriptive analyses on volumes of purchases.
Prior to any analysis, the initial analysis plan included:
• Descriptive unadjusted trends in volume, sugar, and calories by taxation category and bever-
age subcategories and product characteristics.
• Descriptive unadjusted trends in volume, sugar, and calories by taxation category for each
SES subgroup.

 • Longitudinal analysis adjusted for household and macroeconomic covariates using fixed
effects models for volume, sugar, and calories by taxation status and beverage subcategory.
Pretax trends were to be projected into the posttax period to serve as a counterfactual for
observed posttax purchases, with the statistical tests conducted between the observed and
the counterfactual posttax average household purchases. This followed the framework laid
out in previous studies of the Mexican SSB tax [9].
• Using the same longitudinal models, stratify by SES to examine whether there were differ-
ences between low- and high-SES households.
In July 2017, we introduced two changes to the original analysis plan. First, we realized that,
unlike in the Mexican tax evaluation, in Chile, no studies had examined changes in prices due
to the tax implementation. Understanding changes in prices seemed critical to explaining any
changes in beverage purchases (or lack thereof) after the SSB tax. Thus, we added a price analy-
sis component, which included analysis of how estimated changes vary by product characteris-
tics and market-level SES. Second, for both analyses, we tested several models to determine the
best model specification for our data. As a result, we used a correlated random effects tobit
model for volumes and a linear random effects model for prices. However, despite these modi-
fications, the goal of the analysis remained the same: to compare observed posttax changes in
prices and purchases to a counterfactual, or what would have been observed in the posttax
period as predicted by pretax trends.
Finally, we introduced a few additional changes as requested during the review process,
including the addition of 95% confidence intervals (CIs), sensitivity analyses on model specifi-
cation, and reorganization of the tables in the main text. As requested, we also included the sta-
tistical significance of our results accounting for multiple hypotheses testing.
Pre–post analysis framework
After a preliminary and descriptive analysis of the data set, we developed a pre–post analysis
model to address the lack of a proper control group, since the tax was implemented at a
national level. The goal of this analysis is to capitalize on changes in the average mean that
occur before and after an intervention based on a break in time (the date of tax implementa-
tion). This approach is consistent with previous studies of Mexico’s SSB tax [9,10,32]. In this
framework, for each analysis, we constructed a counterfactual, which represents the average
predicted change in an outcome variable in the posttax period based on pretax trends. For
each outcome, we calculated the difference between the observed trend and the counterfactual,
on average, during the posttax period. Thus, each analysis is stated in terms of a comparison of
what was observed after the tax compared to what might have been observed without a tax
based on pretax trends (which is similar to an interrupted time series design). To ensure that
our counterfactual captured the effect of the intervention rather than other contemporaneous
changes, we controlled for time-varying confounders, seasonality, and national and regional
trends, explained in more detail in the purchase analyses section. We calculated the statistical
significance for each estimate adjusting for multiple hypotheses testing using the Sidak–Dunn
correction [33]. Additionally, we reported nonconservative 95% CIs for each estimate. We esti-
mated all models using Stata v.14.1.
Price analyses: Random effects model
We conducted all analyses at the product-market level using the natural logarithm of prices
(assuming that prices follow a log-normal distribution). The unit of each observation is the
price of each product per 1,000 mL in a market in a given month. We used a linear random

 effects model with standard errors clustered at the market level. This model uses a tax period
indicator variable (pretax versus posttax) to create a break in the average mean purchases
before and after the tax implementation. We controlled for linear and quadratic aggregated
trends, seasonality, and regional economic covariates. Additionally, we examined whether
price changes vary by low versus high market-level SES, package size, and the brand’s market
share using interactions with the tax indicator variable.
After estimating the model, we calculated the adjusted predicted changes in price level and
its corresponding 95% CI, comparing what was observed in the posttax period to the counter-
factual (with the tax indicator variable set to zero). To obtain the predicted values, we back-
transformed the conditional means, applying Duan smearing factors [34].
Purchase analyses: Correlated random effects tobit model
For our purchases analysis, the unit of observation was monthly per capita volumes or calories
of beverages purchased by the household. We used a tobit model to explicitly recognize the
large proportion of nonpurchases of each subcategory and to minimize biases introduced by
the large proportion of nonpurchasers. We clustered standard errors at the household level.
Additionally, to adjust for unobserved heterogeneity by household (such as underlying dif-
ferences in household preferences), we allowed for correlated random effects at the household
level using the Chamberlain–Mundlak device [35,36]. We also included time-varying controls:
household size, household composition by gender and age group, head of household education
(no formal education, middle school, high school, college or more) and working status (unem-
ployed, working, studying), indicator variables for region and SES (low and midlow versus
midhigh and high), linear and quadratic aggregated trends, and quarterly seasonal indicator
variables. We interacted SES with the tax indicator variable to analyze changes in effects by
SES. We excluded from the calories analysis the beverage categories with no or very low sugar
content (10% tax rate beverages), since the calorie content of these beverages is too low to ana-
lyze differences.
Sensitivity analyses
We conducted several sensitivity analyses to determine the best model specification using
information criterion and goodness of fit for model selection. First, we tested different specifi-
cations for the trends, time breaks, and seasonality in each model and the significance of the
time-varying covariates in each specification. Second, we tested the sensitivity of our estimates
to autocorrelation (i.e., the similarity of the observations of each household over time) using
the Arellano–Bond estimator [37]. We also estimated a static hurdle model to relax the
assumptions imposed by the tobit model (i.e., that covariates have the same effect on both the
probability of purchase and the amount purchased). Finally, as noted above, we examined
interactions of the tax indicator with market-level SES, package size, and brand size for the
price analyses and household-level SES for the purchase analyses. For each of these subgroup
analyses, we report the p-value of a t test on whether the difference in the absolute predicted
mean changes between the two groups in the posttax period is statistically different from zero.
Results
Descriptive statistics
Eighty-five percent of households were in the sample for all 36 months. Our analytic sample
includes 1,795 unique households, 64,620 household monthly observations, and 114,003 mar-
ket-month product observations.

 Household characteristics in our sample are summarized in S3 Table. In this sample, low-
SES households, compared to high-SES households, were more likely to live in Santiago and
have an employed household head, a larger overall household size (including more children
but fewer adults), and less education. Households were more likely to leave the survey if the
household head was younger and slightly more educated, although we found no significant
differences in household composition or SES. Given this, our estimates were slightly biased
toward older households, conditional on being surveyed in January 2013.
Unadjusted average monthly market prices by beverage subcategory showed major differ-
ences between subcategories (S4 Table). We found the highest prices for noncarbonated
H-SSBs. L-SSB concentrates were the least-expensive beverage type. We found the smallest
(relative) differences in prices across SES among carbonated H-SSBs.
S5 Table shows average purchases (in volume and calories) at the household-month level.
Carbonated H-SSBs (soft drinks) and untaxed beverages were purchased most frequently. Pur-
chases of H-SSBs represent 18.0% of the total beverage purchases by volume and 55.0% of the
total beverage purchases by calories in our data. Purchases of L-SSB concentrates were rela-
tively large (10.0% of total beverage purchases) but contributed to a minimal proportion of
calories purchased (0.2%). High-SES households purchased more of all beverage categories
compared to low-SES households except for carbonated H-SSBs (2.3 versus 2.8 L/capita/
month for high-SES and low-SES households, respectively).
The distribution of package size and brand size (i.e., market share) for all taxed products
(weighted by total sales) are in S1 and S2 Figs, respectively. These results confirm that the use
of 10% as a cutoff to define high versus low market share and the use of 2,500 mL to define
small versus large package size was appropriate.
Monthly adjusted mean prices and purchases (volume) by beverage category are in S3 and
S4 Figs, respectively. We found no obvious changes in prices or purchases after tax implemen-
tation, with one exception: the price of L-SSB concentrates decreased significantly following
tax implementation. Finally, we tested normality in the distribution of prices (in logs) using
the Shapiro–Wilk test on a random sample of products (S6 Table) and found that this assump-
tion cannot be rejected.
Price analysis
Table 1 shows changes in average adjusted real prices at the product level (actual versus coun-
terfactual estimates) by subcategory and tax regime by SES market and overall. Compared to
the counterfactual, prices of carbonated H-SSBs rose by 2.0% (95% CI 1.0%–3.0%), and prices
of noncarbonated H-SSBs rose by 3.9% (95% CI 1.6%–6.2%).
Compared to the counterfactual, L-SSB concentrates saw a sizable price reduction following
the tax cut (−6.7%, 95% CI −8.2%–−4.6%), while prices of ready-to-drink L-SSBs increased
slightly (1.5%, 95% CI 0.3%–2.7%). After the tax, the prices of untaxed beverages increased by
1.8% compared to the counterfactual (95% CI 0.7%–2.9%).
We found no significant differences in price changes for H-SSBs or L-SSBs by SES market.
However, among untaxed beverages we found a significant increase in price for the low-SES
market but no change in price for the high-SES market (p-value = 0.000).
S7 Table shows changes in average adjusted real prices at the product level (actual versus
counterfactual estimates) by package size and market share. Overall, we found larger price varia-
tions in small packages relative to large packages (particularly for L-SSB concentrates). In terms
of market share, we noted significant differences only in the price changes among L-SSB concen-
trates (p-value = 0.000). While L-SSBs with large market shares increased prices (despite the cut
in the tax rate), brands with small market shares experienced a significant decrease in prices.

 Purchase analysis
Absolute and relative changes in household beverage purchases by volume and calories are in
Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Compared to the counterfactual, posttax household purchases of
H-SSBs decreased in both volume (−3.4%, 95% CI −5.9%–−0.9%) and calories (−4.0%, 95% CI
−6.3%–−1.9%). At the subcategory level, carbonated H-SSB purchases did not decrease by vol-
ume but did decrease 3.0% by calories (95% CI −5.2%–−0.8%) relative to the counterfactual.

 Noncarbonated H-SSBs decreased 8.2% by volume (95% CI −13.6%–−3.0%) and 8.9% by calo-
ries (95% CI −13.6%–−4.2%) relative to the counterfactual.
In contrast, the volume of household purchases of L-SSBs increased 10.7% (95% CI 7.5%–
13.9%) relative to the counterfactual. By subcategory, we observed a 9.4% increase in purchase
volume of L-SSB concentrates (95% CI 6.0%–12.8%) and a 12.3% increase in ready-to-drink
L-SSBs (95% CI 8.4%–16.2%) relative to the counterfactual. Purchases of untaxed beverages
decreased 3.1% by volume (95% CI −5.1%–−1.1%) and 5.3% by calories (95% CI −8.1%–
−2.5%).
We found that posttax changes in H-SSB purchases varied by household SES (p-value =
0.004 for volume and 0.006 for calories). In general, high-SES households showed larger
declines in H-SSB purchases after the tax than did low-SES households. Specifically, compared
to their respective counterfactuals, high-SES households reduced purchases of H-SSBs by 6.4%
by volume (95% CI −9.3%–−3.5%) and 6.5% by calories (95% CI −9.1%–−3.9%), whereas low-
SES households showed no change in the volume or calories of H-SSB purchases.
We also found that posttax changes in the volume of L-SSB purchases varied by household
SES (p-value = 0.006), though the size of the difference between SES groups was small. Specifi-
cally, relative to their respective counterfactuals, high-SES households increased the volume of
L-SSB purchases by 10.8% (95% CI 7.8%–13.8%), while low-SES households increased the vol-
ume of L-SSB purchases by 9.5% (95% CI 5.8%–13.2%). Finally, there were also statistically sig-
nificant differences in posttax changes of untaxed beverage purchases in high- versus low-SES
households by volume (p-value = 0.035) but not by calories (p-value = 0.091). Specifically, rela-
tive to their respective counterfactuals, high-SES households had no change in the volume of
untaxed beverages purchased, while low-SES households decreased the volume of untaxed
beverage purchases by 4.3% (95% CI −6.6%–−2.0%).
Sensitivity analysis
The results presented in this paper reflect the best model fit based on Akaike information crite-
ria (AIC) [38] and goodness of fit (R-squared), taking into account the particular characteris-
tics of each model. A summary of results of different model specifications and AIC for selected
outcomes is in S8 Table. We note that alternative model specifications provide less precise
results compared to our chosen model specification, although results follow similar patterns.
The model with a break in trends and intercepts provides more precise estimates for some out-
comes. However, in this model, there are no significant differences in the pretax and posttax
trend estimates; thus, results are to be interpreted with caution. For analyses of the volume of
purchases, we found that a static hurdle model provided similar though less precise results due
to an inability to capture household unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity (in household
preferences, for example). Finally, we noted the lack of significance of the pre–post indicator
when we switched it to April 2014, when the law was introduced in the National Congress of
Chile, which is suggestive evidence that there was no significant anticipatory behavior prior to
the tax implementation.
Discussion
Main findings on H-SSB and L-SSB prices and purchases
In October 2014, Chile increased its tax rate on H-SSBs from 13% to 18% and reduced its tax
rate on L-SSBs from 13% to 10%, representing an 8% spread between L-SSBs and H-SSBs after
tax implementation. This study found that after the 5% tax increase on H-SSBs, prices increased
by 2.0% for carbonated H-SSBs and 3.9% for noncarbonated H-SSBs relative to their respective
counterfactuals. After the 3% tax decrease on L-SSBs, price changes were heterogeneous, with

 prices decreasing for concentrated L-SSBs by 6.7% and for ready-to-drink L-SSBs by 1.5% rela-
tive to their respective counterfactuals.
Commensurate with the small increase in prices of H-SSBs after the tax relative to the coun-
terfactual, we found a small decrease in household purchases of H-SSBs (−3.4% by volume and
−4.0% by calories), with most of the declines coming from noncarbonated H-SSBs (−8.2%).
Overall household purchases of L-SSBs increased relative to the counterfactual (10.7% for vol-
ume), with larger changes among ready-to-drink L-SSBs (14.3%).
Changes in prices of L-SSBs and H-SSBs after the tax
The price increases of H-SSBs were small (2.0% for carbonated and 3.9% for noncarbonated
H-SSBs relative to the respective counterfactuals) compared to the tax increase of 5% on these
beverages. This is different from what was observed in Mexico, where shelf prices of carbon-
ated SSBs increased proportionally to the size of the tax [32]. However, there are several impor-
tant differences between this study of Chile’s tax and studies of Mexico’s tax. First, the current
study examined only available prices of beverages that were purchased, whereas in Mexico and
in most price analyses, the data come from the food store environment, allowing comparison
of shelf prices for the same products over time. Second, changing store prices has administra-
tive costs, which might have prevented some brands from increasing prices, especially consid-
ering the relatively small size of the tax hike in Chile (half the size of the tax implemented in
Mexico). Further research is needed to determine whether the Chilean SSB tax hike led to a
proportional change in shelf prices.
We also found that for H-SSBs and L-SSBs, price changes varied across beverage subcatego-
ries when we considered differences in brand size, package size, and market-level SES. While it
is outside the scope of this article to explain commercial beverage company behavior, in Chile,
companies commonly maintain a complex portfolio of carbonated H-SSBs and carbonated
L-SSBs (e.g., regular and diet soda), which allows for a cross-subsidy between tax categories to
maintain profits. This could explain the small absolute difference in the prices of ready-to-
drink L-SSBs and carbonated H-SSBs after the tax. In contrast, L-SSB concentrates and non-
carbonated H-SSBs tend to be manufactured by different companies, preventing them from
cost-shifting from one category to another. This may explain why among these beverage types
the observed price changes were consistent with the tax changes (i.e., the price of L-SSB con-
centrates decreased after the tax, consistent with the tax rate decrease on these beverages, while

 the price of noncarbonated H-SSBs increased after the tax, consistent with the tax rate increase
on these beverages). Similar industry responses were observed in Mexico, where price changes
varied geographically and by package size [32,39]. Future research should examine changes in
beverage company behavior due to this complex tax structure.
Changes in household purchases of H-SSBs and L-SSBs after the tax
With regard to household purchases of H-SSBs, after the tax, there was an overall decline of
3.4% by volume relative to the counterfactual. This reflected substantial heterogeneity by bev-
erage subcategory, with an 8.2% decline in volume for noncarbonated H-SSBs and a 2.6%
decline in volume for carbonated H-SSBs. Although these posttax declines in volume pur-
chased are larger than the corresponding changes in price, these findings are consistent with
previous studies of price elasticities (i.e., sensitivity to price) of SSBs in Chile, which range
from −1.30 to −1.37 [4,40]. In other words, based on these elasticities, for a 2.0% increase in
price, we would have expected consumers to decrease H-SSB purchases by approximately
2.6%, consistent with our results.
Despite these declines in purchases, however, this tax is likely to have a small impact on
preventing excess caloric intake or adverse health effects associated with SSB intake. This is
because the absolute reductions in H-SSB purchases were small. For example, compared to the
counterfactual, the overall volume of purchases of H-SSBs decreased by 108 mL per person per
month (equivalent to approximately a third of a can of soda). Similarly, calories purchased
decreased by 3.0% and 8.9%, respectively, for carbonated H-SSBs and noncarbonated H-SSBs
compared to their respective counterfactuals. This reflects absolute reductions of only 34 calo-
ries per person per month for carbonated H-SSBs and 21 calories per person per month for
noncarbonated H-SSBs compared to their respective counterfactuals. To put this in context,
Mexico’s SSB tax was about 10%, which translated to a 6% decline in volume of purchases rela-
tive to the counterfactual in the first year after tax implementation but represented a larger
absolute decline of 360 mL per person per month compared to the counterfactual (with no
results yet on corresponding calorie changes) [9]. In Chile, these small changes in volume
and calories purchased seem unlikely to have large effects on obesity and NCD risk, but more
research is needed to understand any potential implications for dietary intake and weight gain.
On the contrary, purchases of L-SSBs increased considerably in the posttax period (10.7%
relative to the counterfactual). This translates into absolute increases of 281 mL per person per
month (or roughly three-fifths of a can of soda) beyond what would be expected based on pre-
tax trends. We were unable to estimate changes in calories purchased for L-SSBs, because
many of them had very few or no calories. While the absolute changes in volume of L-SSB pur-
chases were small, the relative percentage increase may be concerning, particularly for high
consumers, given the lack of evidence regarding the long-term health effects of consumption
of artificial sweeteners [41].
There are several possibilities that explain the smaller declines in H-SSB purchases after
Chile’s tax compared to Mexico’s tax. First, as noted above, the estimated relative price
increases on H-SSBs were smaller in Chile than in Mexico. Second, in Mexico, the SSB tax was
accompanied by a prolonged, multiyear advocacy campaign that included coalition-building
across key scientific and consumer advocacy organizations and paid and earned media cam-
paigns, public demonstrations, press conferences, scientific forums, and civil society forums
[42]. Such campaigns have the potential to influence consumers’ social norms, attitudes, and
purchasing behaviors independently of the regulation itself, as was shown in a decline in
SSB consumption in Mexico aligned with the initiation of the public discourse [9,43]. For
example, a recent study found that a public awareness campaign to decrease SSB intake via TV

 advertising, digital marketing, outdoor advertising, social media, and earned media was associ-
ated with an accelerated decrease in SSB purchases [44]. In Chile, the SSB tax modification
was a small component of a major fiscal reform and as such lacked significant advocacy cam-
paigns. This might have limited potential changes in social norms and attitudes related to SSB
consumption.
Changes in prices and purchases of untaxed beverages after the tax
Even though the Chilean tax modification did not affect previously untaxed beverages, such
as milk or 100% fruit and vegetable juices, this study found that prices of these beverages
increased 1.8% in the posttax period relative to the counterfactual. Our estimates suggest that
the changes in the relative prices of taxed beverages affected the markets of untaxed products,
particularly in low-SES markets (which experienced a 3.2% increase in prices of untaxed bever-
ages relative to the counterfactual).
Commensurate with this price increase, household purchases of untaxed beverages decreased
in the posttax period (−3.1% by volume and −5.3% by calories relative to the counterfactual).
Interestingly, the largest reduction in calories purchased after the tax change came from
untaxed products rather than taxed H-SSBs. One possibility is that consumers substituted
L-SSBs for untaxed beverages, which is consistent with the finding that after the tax decrease
on L-SSBs, untaxed beverages became relatively more expensive. Because different untaxed
beverage subcategories have varying amounts of sugar (such as lactose in plain milk and added
sugar in sweetened flavored milk) and beneficial nutrients, like calcium in milk or vitamin C
in 100% juice, it will be useful for future research on SSB taxes to examine the changes in pur-
chases that occur across various untaxed beverage subcategories and the potential implications
of these changes for health.
Price and purchase changes after the tax by SES
This study found significant differences in changes in price after the tax by market-level SES
for untaxed beverages but not for H-SSBs or L-SSBs. It was not clear why changes in the price
of untaxed beverages would vary by market-level SES. We were unable to tell whether these
differences in the change in price by SES market were due to differential price changes by
retailers and manufacturers or differences in consumer behavior, as noted earlier. For exam-
ple, if low-SES households change how often they buy products or favor bulk discounts on
large products, it could lead to variations in the price changes across markets. More research
is needed to explore differential price changes by SES market after the tax to understand the
implications for both consumer behavior and industry behavior.
We found that high-SES households had a larger decline in the volume of H-SSB purchases
(−6.4%) than did low-SES households (−1.6%) relative to their respective counterfactuals. This
was mainly driven by differences in purchases of carbonated H-SSBs. While high-SES house-
hold volume purchases of H-SSBs decreased by 7.2%, low-SES household volume purchases
did not change. Low-SES households showed larger declines in noncarbonated H-SSBs than
high-SES households, but the difference was not statistically significant. In addition, it is
important to note that carbonated H-SSBs represent a larger proportion of SSB purchases
than do noncarbonated H-SSBs, so the SES differences for carbonated H-SSBs are especially
important.
The result—that high-SES households had bigger changes in purchases of H-SSBs—con-
trasts with the Mexican first-year SSB tax evaluation, which found a 9.2% decline in low-SES
households compared to a 5.6% decline for high-SES households [9]. This result is also con-
trary to expectations that lower-SES households will respond more to price increases due to a

 higher price sensitivity in this group. There are several potential explanations for these coun-
terintuitive findings. Low-SES households could be more likely to intentionally avoid the tax
by changing purchasing strategies, such as making larger but less frequent purchases [45].
Also, low-SES households in Chile are higher consumers of H-SSBs (relative to high-SES
households) and thus may be less likely respond to price changes, because they have a stronger
preference for these beverages [46]. While the absolute reductions in H-SSB purchases were
small for all SES groups, the higher changes observed among high-SES households are con-
cerning. Considering that SSB taxes are expected to produce larger changes in behavior among
low-SES households and that this expectation is often used to rationalize the use of such taxes
to reduce SES-related disparities in obesity and NCDs, future research should examine the
drivers of this differential response by SES and potential implications for diet and health.
Finally, we found differences in changes in posttax purchases by household SES. Low-SES
households showed larger reductions in untaxed beverage purchases by volume, but high-SES
households showed larger reductions in untaxed purchases by calories. These differences in
response by household SES could be the result of changes in the types of untaxed beverages
purchased, since this category is very heterogenous and includes beverages with calories, such
as milk and 100% juice, but also beverages with no calories, such as plain bottled water. We
were unable to examine differences by beverage subcategory to better explain these findings
due to the low amount of purchases in some of these subcategories.
Strengths and limitations
The most important limitation of this study is our inability to assess a causal relationship
between the tax modifications and changes in prices or purchases due to the potential presence
of other simultaneous trends affecting underlying preferences and due to the inability of
household food purchase data to capture all beverages consumed (particularly those consumed
out of the home). While we did adjust for economic factors and secular trends, we cannot rule
out shifts in preferences or norms that may have occurred concurrently with the tax imple-
mentation. To address our inability to capture all beverages using household purchase data, we
will conduct future research using dietary recall data to capture the full range of beverages con-
sumed. In the meantime, we note that the trends observed here are consistent with those in
Euromonitor sales data, which reflect all beverages sold in the country [47]. In terms of exter-
nal validity, we note that our sample is more likely to represent urban and older households
and therefore does not completely reflect changes in purchases among younger households
and the rural population. However, a comparative analysis of our data shows that the distribu-
tion of purchases by beverage group is consistent with those reported in the 2011–2012 Chil-
ean Budget and Expenditure Survey. Furthermore, this study examines only the first posttax
year in Chile. It is possible that subsequent years will see additional purchasing changes, as
occurred in Mexico [10].
An additional limitation of this study is that, as previously noted, the prices reflected prod-
ucts purchased and not those available in stores (i.e., what was available in the market before
and after the tax). However, we were able to address this issue using models that consistently
captured variability in prices, allowing us to accurately estimate the average market changes
while also exploring heterogeneity across product and brand characteristics. We also explicitly
accounted for the censored nature of purchasing data by estimating a tobit model that predicts
both the choice to purchase and the amount purchased. Finally, we were able to examine dif-
ferential changes in both prices and purchases by SES (at the market level for price and at the
household level for purchases). An understanding of differences in tax responses by SES is
important for understanding how the tax may affect existing disparities in diet and health.

 Future research
Additional research is needed to understand the observed changes in prices and purchases and
the differential responses by SES. For example, one possibility is that companies changed their
marketing strategies to mitigate the effects of the price increase. A second possibility is that
companies could have changed the nutritional formulation of products to avoid the tax. We
also want to note that a subsequent Chilean law in July 2016 implemented front-of-package
warning labels, restrictions on marketing to children, and restrictions on sales in schools for
all foods and beverages containing high levels of sugar, sodium, saturated fat, or calories,
which could have had additional influence on both commercial beverage industry behavior
and consumer behavior in the time period leading up to the implementation of those regula-
tions. Given the substantial regulatory changes underway in Chile’s food environment since
2014, a critical question for future research is whether this small SSB tax modification, along
with the newer marketing and media controls and front-of-package labels, will result in sus-
tained changes in Chileans’ dietary intake with potential downstream effects for SES disparities
in obesity and NCDs.
Finally, given the large and increased consumption of ready-to-drink L-SSBs and L-SSB
concentrates, we recommend that the effects of these beverages on health be further investi-
gated in the Chilean population, especially considering that they are relatively cheaper than
their high-sugar alternatives and often bear significantly more front-of-package marketing,
such as nutrition and health claims [48].
Conclusion
The small increase (5%) in the Chilean tax rate on H-SSBs was followed by small decreases in
prices and purchases of these beverages, with high-SES households showing larger declines in
purchases than low-SES households. The small decrease (3%) in the tax on L-SSBs was fol-
lowed by heterogeneous changes in prices and increases in purchases of these beverages. Prices
of untaxed beverages increased, and purchases of these beverage decreased, despite the lack of
a tax or a change in the tax rate on these beverages. Our results are consistent with previous
evidence indicating that small tax rates on SSBs are unlikely to promote the changes in SSB
purchases needed to reduce obesity and NCDs.
