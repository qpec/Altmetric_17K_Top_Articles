ABSTRACT 
1 
Background: No high-quality trials have provided evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
2 
HIV-treatment adherence interventions. The current multi-centre trial examined the effectiveness and 
3 
cost-effectiveness of the Adherence Improving self-Management Strategy (AIMS). Preparatory studies 
4 
demonstrated that AIMS is acceptable, feasible to deliver in routine care, and has reproducible effects 
5 
on medication adherence. 
6 
Methods: A multi-centre randomized controlled trial (RCT) in seven academic and non-academic 
7 
hospitals, comparing AIMS against treatment-as-usual (TAU). AIMS is provided by nurses during routine 
8 
clinic visits. Treatment-initiating and treatment-experienced patients at-risk for viral rebound were 
9 
eligible. Plasma viral load collected at months 5, 10, and 15 was the primary effectiveness outcome. 
10 
Utilizing cohort data from 7347 Dutch HIV-patients to calculate the natural course of illness, a lifetime 
11 
Markov model was developed to estimate the costs per quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained of 
12 
AIMS from a societal perspective. 
13 
Results: The intent-to-treat sample comprised 221 patients. The primary mixed-effects analysis showed 
14 
that log viral load was 1.26 [1.04-1.52] times higher in the TAU than AIMS arm. Additional viral load 
15 
analyses of detectable/undetectable viral load (OR=1.89 [0.98-3.65]) and ‘treatment failure’ (two 
16 
consecutive detectable viral loads, OR=2.99 [1.21-7.38]) confirmed this finding. The Markov model 
17 
showed that AIMS was dominant (more effective and less costly) to TAU in all scenarios (base case 
18 
scenario: 0.034 QALYs gained and €592,- saved per patient). 
19 
Interpretation: This carefully-designed RCT and economic model demonstrate that AIMS reduces viral 
20 
load, increases QALYs, and saves resources. Implementation of AIMS in routine clinical HIV-care is 
21 
therefore recommended.

INTRODUCTION 
1 
Efficacious drugs for the treatment of HIV/AIDS are widely available in high-income countries since 
2 
1996, and increasingly so in low-income countries. The life expectancy of people living with HIV using 
3 
combination Antiretroviral Therapy (cART) is now almost identical to that of people living without HIV.1 
4 
Moreover, the risk of forward HIV transmission is reduced considerably for successfully treated 
5 
patients.2 However, despite a marked reduction in side-effects and complexity of cART regimens over 
6 
the last two decades, sub-optimal intake of medication (the faulty execution) and premature 
7 
discontinuation (non-persistence) of cART are two elements of non-adherence that continue to 
8 
compromise treatment effectiveness.3 Non-adherence can lead to poor patient outcomes, the 
9 
development of drug-resistant virus, fewer treatment options due to drug resistance, and elevated 
10 
onward transmission risks of (resistant) viral strains.4-9 Hence, supporting patients’ adherence is an 
11 
important objective from a patient and public health perspective, and essential for achieving the UNAIDS 
12 
90-90-90 targets.10 
13 
 
14 
For the long-term success of cART and its consequent impact on the spread of HIV, it is key to intervene 
15 
with suboptimal adherence before virological failure occurs. Although meta-regression analyses suggest 
16 
that the quality of adherence support provided to patients has a large influence on viral suppression 
17 
rates,11,12 there is little direct experimental evidence that adherence interventions have a sustained 
18 
impact on adherence and – more importantly – on viral loads and CD4 cell counts.13,14 In fact, a recently 
19 
updated Cochrane review did not identify any low risk-of-bias trial of HIV adherence interventions in 
20 
high-income countries providing evidence of intervention effects on adherence and clinical outcomes 
21 
such as viral load. Two such trials were identified for low-income countries.15 Moreover, there is no 
22 
evidence that effective HIV-treatment adherence interventions yield benefits for society in terms of cost-
23 
effectiveness.16 
24 
 
25 
In 2003, we developed the Adherence Improving self-Management Strategy (AIMS), based on empirical 
26 
literature, behavioural theories, and input from health care professionals and patients.17 AIMS is a nurse-
27 
delivered, 1-on-1 behavioural intervention that incorporates adherence feedback from electronic 
28 
medication monitors (MEMS-caps) and is designed to fit in routine clinic visits. After a successful pilot-
29 
study demonstrating acceptability, feasibility and effects on adherence,17 a single-centre randomized 
30 
  
5 
 
controlled trial (RCT) was conducted amongst treatment-experienced patients.18 Although powered to 
1 
detect an effect on adherence (primary outcome), this trial also provided tentative evidence of improved 
2 
viral suppression rates (secondary outcome). However, this RCT was conducted at a single centre, with 
3 
a homogeneous patient group, and had a short follow-up (7 months). Demonstrating clinically relevant 
4 
effects on viral load in a high-quality pragmatic trial with a long follow-up, and a heterogeneous group 
5 
of patients and HIV clinics, could provide conclusive evidence that AIMS is effective. Moreover, 
6 
demonstrating that AIMS is also cost-effective would be important for policy makers, as well as for 
7 
adherence intervention research more generally given the very limited evidence of the economic benefit 
8 
of adherence interventions. 
9 
 
10 
In sum, effective HIV-treatment adherence interventions should benefit patient and public health, and 
11 
reduce health care expenditures – yet experimental evidence in support of this is lacking. The current 
12 
study describes the results from a pragmatic, multi-centre randomized controlled trial evaluating the 
13 
effectiveness of AIMS and the results of a Markov model evaluating the cost-effectiveness of AIMS over 
14 
a lifetime horizon. 
15

METHODS 
17 
The study protocol has been published,19 and is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: 
18 
NCT01429142). A separate article has been published on the strategies employed for reducing the risk 
19 
of bias in this trial,20 and the risk of bias rationale table summarizing this is included in the Appendix 
20 
(Table 1). We will therefore only succinctly report the methodology in this paper. 
21 
 
22 
Study Setting and Eligibility Criteria 
23 
The study was conducted in seven Dutch HIV clinics (academic and non-academic hospitals). Eligible 
24 
patients were treatment-experienced (≥9 months on cART) and ‘at-risk’ of viral rebound, or treatment-
25 
naïve patients initiating their first cART regimen. ‘At-risk’ of viral rebound was determined based on 
26 
having at least one detectable viral load during the previous three years and suboptimal adherence 
27 
during two months baseline MEMS monitoring (<100% adherence for QD and ≤95% for a BID regimen). 
28 
These criteria were based on analyses of data from a large HIV-cohort including all registered HIV 
29 
patients in the Netherlands,21 and our previous RCT.18 Exclusion criteria were: age <18 years, severe 
30 
  
6 
 
psychiatric disorders or other comorbidities precluding compliance with study procedures, pregnancy, 
1 
plans to interrupt treatment in the next 14 months, life expectancy less than one year, not able to 
2 
communicate in English or Dutch, viral resistance to three or more antiretroviral drug classes, and about 
3 
to initiate hepatitis C treatment. 
4 
 
5 
Eligible patients were approached by their treating physician and/or HIV nurse, and given information 
6 
about the study verbally and in writing. All patients gave written informed consent and the trial was 
7 
approved by the medical ethical committees of all participating hospitals. Given the absence of any 
8 
patient safety risks according to the Medical Ethical Committee that approved the trial, there was no 
9 
Data and Safety Monitoring board. 
10 
 
11 
Patient recruitment started on the 1st of September 2011 and was completed on the 2nd of April 2013. 
12 
The last patient completed the study on the 16th of June, 2014. 
13 
 
14 
Randomization and Masking 
15 
Consenting patients were randomized to AIMS or treatment-as-usual (TAU) within nurses, since 
16 
randomizing clinics or nurses was expected to result in recruitment bias. The resulting risk of 
17 
contamination was kept low because key intervention elements – such as MEMS-feedback and all other 
18 
intervention materials (see Panel 1) - only appeared on the website when the MEMS-cap of an 
19 
intervention patient was downloaded (see 20 and Appendix Table 1). Randomization was stratified by 
20 
treatment experience (experienced versus naïve). Block randomization (with randomly ordered blocks 
21 
of size four, six, and eight to avoid predictability of assignment) was used to balance intervention and 
22 
control patients over nurses. The randomization table was computer-generated by a statistician and 
23 
treatment assignment was done automatically by software after nurses entered the details of consenting 
24 
patients on a study website. As blinding to treatment assignment is not possible given the nature of the 
25 
intervention, we developed a ‘distraction’ strategy for drawing patient and health care provider attention 
26 
away from the primary study aims. Specifically, we included a second research objective in the study 
27 
(i.e., ‘To examine the content of, and patient satisfaction with, nursing care provided to patients treated 
28 
for HIV’), and the regular questionnaires nurses and patients completed during the trial focused on this 
29 
study aim, rather than on the comparison of AIMS versus TAU.20 
30 
  
7 
 
Study Design and Measurements 
1 
HIV-nurses (n=21) from the seven participating clinics received a training (3 times 6 hours) on AIMS 
2 
and using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS-caps, an electronic pill-bottle cap that 
3 
registers date and time of pill bottle opening). A 1.5-hour booster session was delivered at each HIV-
4 
clinic (2-3 nurses per session) after each nurse had seen 2-3 patients. The first author delivered the 
5 
training and booster sessions. There was no additional support or advice in relation to the delivery of 
6 
the intervention. 
7 
 
8 
Patient demographics and treatment details were collected at baseline. Plasma viral load  and CD4 cell 
9 
counts were assessed at baseline (Time 1) and at three follow-up time points (Time 2, 3, and 4) as part 
10 
of routine care. For treatment-initiating patient Time 2 measurement was planned at 5-6 months, to allow 
11 
patients to become undetectable. Treatment-experienced patients followed the usual 4-5 months visit 
12 
interval. The observed times of outcome measurement of treatment-experienced versus treatment-
13 
naïve patients (mean (SD) number of days) since randomisation were 125 (44) versus 177 (54); 270 
14 
(76) versus 306 (69); and 447 (87) and 454 (83) for Time 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The viral load assays 
15 
used were COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test, v2.0 (Roche), Abbott m2000 RealTime HIV-
16 
1, and NucliSENS Easy Q HIV-1 v2.0 (Biomerieux), with lower detection limits varying from 20 to 75 
17 
copies/ml. 
18 
 
19 
The study was overpowered for detecting an effect on adherence. To avoid unnecessary study burden, 
20 
we measured MEMS-adherence in a randomly selected 50% of the control group patients. Since a 
21 
subset of patients prefers using their own medication bottles over the MEMS-caps bottles (especially if 
22 
MEMS-caps are used for monitoring only, as in the TAU arm),18,22 and because adherence is a 
23 
secondary outcome, if randomised patients preferred further trial participation without MEMS-
24 
monitoring, they were allowed to do so (for procedure see Appendix). 
25 
 
26 
Treatment-As-Usual Provided and the Adherence Improving self-Management Strategy 
27 
The quality and quantity of TAU adherence support provided to control groups in adherence trials varies 
28 
between trials and impacts on effect sizes.11,12 We developed a minimally intrusive method for collecting 
29 
TAU data from participating nurses,23 and found that TAU in participating clinics ranged from medium to 
30 
  
8 
 
high quality when compared with meta-analyses on this topic.11,12 Note that TAU was not standardised 
1 
for the purpose of this trial, and reflects what patients receive in routine clinical care in the Netherlands. 
2 
AIMS and TAU are described in Panel 1.

Both TAU and AIMS were delivered as part of routine care by trained HIV/AIDS nurses. The Table

             Procedures: the activities done and how they relate to the materials described 
When the physician, nurse, and patient 
agreed treatment should be initiated, 
typically the following activities were 
done to support adherence:  
 
1. Patients are verbally explained how 
the medication works and what the 
relation is between adherence, viral 
replication, and treatment outcomes. 
This includes risks (e.g., viral 
resistance) and benefits (e.g., healthy 
immune system, less infectious) of (non) 
adherence. Information leaflet provided 
(Material 1). 
2. Patients are explained how, how 
often, and in what dose the medication 
should be taken  
Here we explain AIMS for treatment-experienced 
patients. Visit 1 is slightly different for treatment naïve 
patients, which is explained in the Appendix.  
 
Prior to the first AIMS intervention visit, patients used an 
electronic medication monitor for 4-8 weeks. Data were 
downloaded and a website guided patients and nurses 
through the steps below. Tailoring of the intervention to 
the needs and abilities of each individual patient, was a 
core component of each step. 
 
1. The same educational activities as for TAU step 1, 
except that Material 1 was used to facilitate discussion 
and enhance information storage in long-term memory 
(Material 1). 
2. Nurse explains seven exemplar MEMS-reports 
(Material 2) while linking (non-)adherence patterns to the 
  
9 
 
3. Nurse and patient discuss when it is 
best for each individual patient to take 
their medication (at what time, where, 
linking intake to daily routines or using 
reminder devices that can serve as 
cues) 
4. Patient are given a phone number to 
call in case of difficulties (e.g., side 
effects, adherence) 
 
During follow-up visits (this also applies 
to treatment-experienced patients) 
5. Patient and nurse discuss self-
reported adherence (problems) and try 
to identify solutions that would work for 
that patient 
6. Nurse/Physician ask about any side-
effects and discuss how to deal with 
them (if severe, change of regimen is 
considered)  
7. Nurses provide viral load and CD4 
cell count feedback. If results are 
positive, this serves to reinforce 
adherence. If results are negative, 
adherence problems or other causes 
(e.g., drug resistance, drug interactions) 
are explored (Objective 6) 
 
Note that Steps 4, 6, and 7 were also 
delivered to AIMS patients as part of 
their routine care. 
adherence-outcome information discussed in Step 1. 
Patient selects one adherence report reflecting how they 
would like to take their medication (‘Desired adherence 
level’) and explain why this is important to them 
personally/in the long-run (Material 3). 
3. Patients’ own MEMS-report is printed (‘Actual 
adherence level’, Material 4) and compared with their 
‘Desired adherence level’. Includes reinforcement of 
good adherence and highlighting discrepancies (i.e., 
where actual  adherence is lower than desired). 
4. Patient MEMS-report is used to identify any non-
adherence patterns, causes, and solutions. These are 
written down in coping plans (if-then format) (Materials 4, 
5 and 6). 
5. Patient selects an adherence goal for the next visit 
(using Material 2) and scores confidence (Material 7) in 
their ability to accomplish that. If confidence is low, the 
nurse explores whether important adherence barriers 
have been unaddressed and/or if their adherence goal 
should be approached incrementally. 
6. The patient is offered a MEMS-view cap with a display 
showing how often the bottle has been opened that day 
(direct behavioural feedback, Material 4). Patient is given 
printed adherence report and coping plan. 
 
Subsequent intervention sessions are mainly repetitions 
of the activities described under Steps 3, 4, and 5. The 
aim is that patients reach their desired level of 
adherence during the first ±5 months of the intervention, 
strive for behavioural maintenance during the next ±5 
months, followed by a follow-up period of another ±5 
months. Patients with many adherence difficulties can be 
seen more frequently.

Outcome Measure, Statistical Analyses, and Sample Size for the Effectiveness Analyses 
4 
The study was powered to detect an effect on plasma viral load, measured at three consecutive time 
5 
points (Time points 2, 3, and 4), while controlling for baseline viral load. A sample of 230 randomized 
6 
patients was required to obtain 80% power to detect a significant intervention effect on viral load for at 
7 
least one of three time points with alpha = .05 (two-sided), using a Bonferroni correction and assuming 
8 
a maximum dropout of 10%. 
9 
 
10 
  
10 
 
The primary effectiveness outcome was defined as log10-transformed viral load (copies/ml) across the 
1 
three follow-up time points. The secondary effectiveness outcome was percentage adherence. Post-
2 
hoc outcomes were (1) ‘Treatment failure’, defined as having a detectable viral load on two consecutive 
3 
follow-up measurements; (2) CD4 cell count (cells/mm3); and (3) Detectable versus undetectable viral 
4 
load. The latter measure was to be used as the primary outcome instead of log10- viral load, if the skewed 
5 
distribution of log10 viral load data would lead to violation of statistical model assumptions. As model 
6 
assumptions were not violated, this analysis is reported as post-hoc. 
7 
 
8 
The primary intent-to-treat analysis for log10 viral load used a mixed-effects (multilevel) model .24,25 A 
9 
factor for time point (3 levels: Time points 2, 3, 4), group (2 levels), and their interaction (testing for a 
10 
between-group change during follow-up) were the primary variables of interest. In the absence of a time-
11 
by-group interaction, the overall intervention effect can be estimated by a between-group (marginal) 
12 
contrast across the three follow-up time points. Baseline viral load and the stratification variable 
13 
(treatment-experienced versus treatment-naïve) were added to the model as covariates; as well as a 
14 
four-level factor for ethnicity (Caucasian, Sub-Saharan African, Caribbean, and Others patients), as this 
15 
is an important prognostic covariate.11,20 The viral load results were exponentiated (with base 10) for 
16 
easier interpretation. Undetectable viral loads (e.g., <40 copies/ml) were replaced by the corresponding 
17 
detection limit. 
18 
 
19 
We also conducted: (1) A mixed-effects logistic regression model,25 using detectable versus 
20 
undetectable viral load (based on the detection limit of each respective clinic). The detection limit value 
21 
of each viral load test was added as an additional covariate. (2) A mixed-effects logistic regression 
22 
model examining ‘treatment failure’, using the same covariates. (3) A mixed-effects model examining 
23 
the effects of the intervention on CD4 cell count, using the same model as for the primary viral load 
24 
analysis, but with viral load replaced by CD4 values. 
25 
 
26 
Based on the fitted models, we also obtained marginal estimates of the AIMS and TAU group-specific 
27 
means (viral load and CD4 analyses) and risks (detectable viral load and treatment failure analyses), 
28 
using the median value at baseline for continuous covariates (i.e., baseline viral load and detection limit) 
29 
  
11 
 
and the observed proportions at baseline for categorical covariates (i.e., treatment-experienced versus 
1 
treatment-naïve, ethnicity, and detection status at baseline). 
2 
 
3 
No statistical analyses were conducted on the secondary outcome adherence, because of considerable 
4 
differences in the uptake of the MEMS-monitoring between the study arms (e.g., 91% (52/57) of the 
5 
treatment-naïve patients randomized to AIMS versus 54% (15/28) in the TAU arm started the use of 
6 
MEMS after randomisation). 
7 
 
8 
Analyses were carried out in R (version 3.1.2) using the nlme package,24 and Stata (version 13.1) using 
9 
functions mixed and meqrlogit. Additional details on the sample size calculation and statistical analyses 
10 
are in the Appendix. 
11 
 
12 
Cost-effectiveness Analysis 
13 
The primary outcome for the model-based economic evaluation reported here is lifetime societal costs 
14 
(including health care costs, productivity loss, HIV transmission costs, and intervention cost) per quality-
15 
adjusted life-years (QALYs) of AIMS versus TAU.19 A trial-based economic evaluation, which examines 
16 
the short-term economic outcomes observed during the follow-up period of the trial and therefore has 
17 
another primary outcome (see clinicaltrials.gov), will be published separately. 
18 
 
19 
A Markov model was developed based on the Dutch guideline for health economic evaluations and 
20 
international guidelines for modeling.26 In a Markov model, a cohort of patients is assumed to transit 
21 
between health states. Based on the literature and input from clinicians in the participating clinics, 13 
22 
health states were identified: three CD4-cell count categories (0-200, 201-500, and >500) combined 
23 
with 4 viral load categories (0-50, 51-200, 201-1000, and >1000 copies/ml), and death. These health 
24 
states capture the key changes in viral load and CD4 cell count associated with changes in costs, HIV 
25 
transmission risk, and quality of life. A 6-month cycle length was used, meaning that patients can change 
26 
between health states every 6 months. All transitions between health states are possible except when 
27 
a patient died. Hence, the Markov model is a matrix existing of 13 rows (current health status) and 13 
28 
columns (the health state patients move to; see Appendix Table 3). 
29 
 
30 
  
12 
 
Next, we calculated the 6-months transition probabilities of TAU patients moving between these health 
1 
states (the natural course of illness), and the health care consumption in each health state over a 6-
2 
month period. For that, we obtained a longitudinal dataset (2008 to 2015) from the HIV Monitoring 
3 
Foundation, the Netherlands. We used data from all registered Dutch HIV patients (N = 7347) who were 
4 
on treatment for ≥12 months (two 6-month cycles), and had at least one detectable RNA viral load 
5 
measurement (>50 copies/ml) in the last 3 years (excluding the first 12 months of treatment), to 
6 
approximate the inclusion criteria for treatment experienced patients in the trial. Excess mortality per 
7 
health state was also derived from this cohort. Utility data (i.e., quality of life) per health state were based 
8 
on CD4 cell count and obtained from another cohort study.27 HIV transmission probabilities per health 
9 
state based on viral load data, were estimated by the lead author of an HIV transmission modeling 
10 
study,8 and multiplied by the lifetime treatment costs for an HIV-infected patient.28 For the societal 
11 
perspective, the model also included productivity losses per health state based on 600 questionnaires 
12 
completed by 195 patients during the current multi-centre trial. Tables with these transition probabilities, 
13 
costs (health care costs, HIV transmission costs, and productivity loss), and utilities per health state are 
14 
included in the online Appendix (Tables 2-3). 
15 
 
16 
To assess the cost-effectiveness of AIMS, data are required on the intervention cost, as well as on the 
17 
effects of AIMS on the transition probabilities during and after the intervention period. These effects 
18 
were calculated from the trial data and expressed in relative risks (AIMS versus TAU; Appendix Table 
19 
4). For the AIMS intervention, these relative risks were then applied to the natural course of illness 
20 
(Appendix, Table 3) over three 6-month cycles, which is the approximate duration of the trial. The cohort 
21 
of patients receiving AIMS has therefore different probabilities of moving between health states than 
22 
patients receiving TUA, and therefore costs and outcomes will be different. 
23 
 
24 
To define the relative risks of AIMS, a base case and two additional scenarios were conducted. The 
25 
base case (scenario 1) included all relative risks (AIMS versus TAU) where at least 5 transitions occurred 
26 
in the trial (see Appendix Table 4). Scenario 2 included all available relative risks irrespective of the 
27 
number of transitions, whereas the more conservative scenario 3 included only relative risks with at least 
28 
10 transitions. Within these 3 scenarios, we varied our assumptions about how long the effects of AIMS 
29 
would sustain if delivery would be discontinued after the initial 18 months: (1) a linear decrease of the 
30 
  
13 
 
effects of AIMS to zero 18 months after intervention discontinuation; (2) no effect after AIMS 
1 
discontinuation; (3) AIMS effects fully sustained for another 18 months, and then to zero. A total of 9 
2 
scenarios were therefore tested. Sensitivity analyses were further performed for a healthcare 
3 
perspective (i.e., excluding productivity losses) and a time horizon of 10 years instead of lifetime. For 
4 
each scenario and sensitivity analysis, we estimated the societal costs and QALYs of AIMS compared 
5 
with TAU, and calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between AIMS and TAU. The 
6 
ICER expresses the additional cost of AIMS compared with TAU to obtain one additional QALY. When 
7 
an intervention is more effective and less costly, the intervention is said to be cost-saving.

Role of the funding source 
10 
This trial was funded from public money by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and 
11 
Development (ZonMW) (Grant Number 171002208). This funding source had no role in study design, 
12 
data collection, analysis, interpretation, or writing/revising the report.

RESULTS 
15 
Recruitment and randomization 
16 
224 patients were randomized: slightly below the target of 230 but dropout was lower than anticipated 
17 
(4.5% (10/224) instead of 10%). The intent-to-treat sample comprised 221 patients: one patient who 
18 
was not planning to start with cART was accidentally randomized, and two eligible patients (one in each 
19 
arm) did not provide any outcome data, because soon after randomization one died of a cardiovascular 
20 
event, and the other was incarcerated in another country. As these reasons were unrelated to group 
21 
assignment or the dependent variable, team members (MdB, WV, and JMP) blinded to group 
22 
assignment concluded these were valid reasons for exclusion (Cochrane handbook 8.13 and 16.2).29 
23 
 
24 
Figure 1 shows the flow of participants through the study and the most frequent patient-reported reasons 
25 
for study refusal. In a logistic regression analysis, treatment experience (treatment-naïve patients were 
26 
more likely to participate), but not gender, age, ethnicity, CD4, or viral load predicted study participation. 
27 
 
28 
Sample descriptives and intervention fidelity 
29 
The majority of the intent-to-treat sample was male (185/221, 84%), Caucasian (143/221, 65%), with an 
30 
average age of 44 years (SD=10.9). The majority had a low to medium educational level. About half of 
31 
  
14 
 
the participants were treatment-experienced and 34% (37/109) of those had a detectable viral load at 
1 
baseline, confirming that the ‘at-risk’ selection criteria were useful (viral suppression rate in the general 
2 
treatment-experienced population in the Netherlands is 91%).30 See Table 1 for further sample 
3 
descriptives. 
4 
 
5 
The mean follow-up of study participants was 14.6 months (SD=2.7). The mean number of TAU and 
6 
AIMS visits were 3.2 (SD=1.6) and 3.2 (SD=1.7), respectively. The delivery of AIMS took an average of 
7 
10.3 additional minutes/visit (35 minutes in total during follow-up). Intervention patients received on 
8 
average 85% of all planned intervention visits, during which 65% of all the intervention elements were 
9 
delivered (recorded on the intervention website). The main reason recorded for not delivering all 
10 
intervention elements, was adherence having improved during follow-up sessions, without additional 
11 
issues to address; or because the action/coping plans made during the previous intervention session 
12 
remained relevant and did not need to be completed again.

Handling missing data 
1 
There were 634/663 (95,6%) completed follow-up viral load measurements and 29/663 (4.4%) missing 
2 
values, which were not associated with group assignment or viral load values at other time points in 
3 
logistic regression models. Missing data were assumed to be missing at random, except for two patients 
4 
who dropped out of care, discontinued medication after Time point 3, and did not provide a viral load at 
5 
Time point 4. As AIMS should reduce such non-persistence (i.e., a stage of non-adherence),3 and non-
6 
persistence affects the dependent variable, these data cannot be treated as missing at random. Based 
7 
on clinical advice, the two missing values were replaced by the median baseline viral load (50,123 
8 
copies/ml) and CD4 count (400 cells/mm3) of the treatment-naive patients participating in the study. 
9 
These decisions were based on consensus between team members (MdB, WV, and JMP) blinded to 
10 
group assignment. 
11 
 
12 
Since all 221 patients provided data at least one follow-up measure, the mixed-effects analyses include 
13 
the full intent-to-treat sample. The statistician (WV) who conducted the analyses was blinded to group 
14 
assignment. The main treatment effects are described here (for the results on the covariates and 
15 
exploratory subgroup analyses, please see the Appendix). 
16 
 
17 
Primary Effectiveness Analysis 
18 
The three-level mixed-effects regression model showed that there was no indication of a change in the 
19 
intervention effect across the three follow-up time points (time-by-group interaction (F(2,409)=0.75, 
20 
p=.47)). We therefore examined the between-group contrast across the three follow-up time points, 
21 
which showed that the intervention was effective (F(1,196)=6.40, p=.012), while controlling for baseline 
22 
viral load, treatment experience, and ethnicity. Patients in the control group had viral loads that were on 
23 
average 1.26 times (95%CI: 1.04 to 1.52) higher than those in the intervention group. There was no 
24 
significant variability of the treatment effect across nurses (p = .14). 
25 
 
26 
Post-hoc Effectiveness Analyses 
27 
The three-level mixed-effects logistic regression model with detectable versus undetectable viral loads 
28 
showed the same pattern (χ2(df=1)=3.66, p=.056). Overall, patients in the control group had a 1.89 times 
29 
higher odds of a detectable viral load across the three time points (95%CI: 0.98 to 3.65). 
30 
  
18 
 
 
1 
The two-level logistic regression model of treatment failure indicated a significant group difference 
2 
(χ2(df=1)=5.61, p=.012). The odds of treatment failure were 2.99 times higher in the control group (95% 
3 
CI: 1.21 to 7.38). 
4 
 
5 
The model examining the effects on CD4 cell count did reveal a significant time-by-group interaction 
6 
(F(2,398)=3.09, p=0.047). We therefore examined the group difference for each follow-up time point 
7 
separately. At the first follow-up (Time 2), there was a non-significant increase in CD4 cell count in the 
8 
intervention compared with the control arm (31 cells/mm3, 95%CI: -8.37 to 70.37); at Time 3 the control 
9 
group caught up (-6.55 cells/mm3, 95%CI: -46.03 to 32.92); and at Time 4 CD4 cell counts continued to 
10 
rise in the intervention but not in the control arm, and the difference was significant (39.39 cells/mm3, 
11 
95%CI: 0.10 to 78.67). Marginal group means and risks for these analyses are shown in Table 2.

The Cost-Effectiveness Analyses 
22 
In the base-case analysis, the Markov model estimated that AIMS reduces lifetime societal costs by 
23 
€592 per patient and increases QALY by 0,034 per patient. AIMS was therefore cost-saving (i.e., more 
24 
  
19 
 
QALYs and less costs) in the base case. Results were comparable for the other scenarios and for the 
1 
sensitivity analyses with a health care perspective, and a 10-year time horizon (Table 3).

CONCLUSIONS 
1 
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial of an HIV treatment adherence intervention 
2 
that demonstrates a clinically meaningful effect on viral load as well as cost-effectiveness. Importantly, 
3 
the economic model shows that AIMS is dominant to TAU: both cheaper and more effective, regardless 
4 
of the time horizon (life time or 10 year) and perspective (health care or societal). These results have 
5 
been obtained in a heterogeneous sample of HIV-infected patients and clinics, where AIMS was 
6 
delivered by nurses as part of routine care. 
7 
 
8 
A recent Cochrane review did not identify RCTs with a low risk of bias that demonstrated an impact of 
9 
HIV treatment adherence interventions on adherence and clinical outcomes in high-income settings.15 
10 
Short follow-up periods (<6 months) and a high risk of bias were important reasons for excluding many 
11 
trials from these analyses. In the design of the current study, we tried to overcome these and additional 
12 
challenges by designing a study with a long follow-up period (15 months), extensive efforts to minimize 
13 
the risk of bias (which is particularly challenging in behavioural trials as blinding to treatment assignment 
14 
is typically not possible), and the detailed reporting of TAU provided to control participants.11,12,20,23 
15 
Although one limitation of the current study was the low uptake of MEMS-monitoring in the TAU arm, 
16 
precluding meaningful secondary adherence analyses, the effects of AIMS on adherence had already 
17 
been demonstrated in two earlier studies.17,18 Moreover, as there is no plausible other pathway to 
18 
improved viral loads in the AIMS-arm than through improved adherence, this limitation does not 
19 
influence the overall study conclusions. Secondly, although dropout rates were very low, a 60% study 
20 
refusal rate may limit generalizability of the findings. We did, however, not find demographic or clinical 
21 
differences between participants and those refusing study participation. Relevant to note here is that 
22 
most reasons for study refusal (see Figure 1) are unlikely to be a barrier to the uptake of AIMS in routine 
23 
care. Specifically with regards to patients’ willingness to utilize an electronic adherence monitor, we 
24 
expect substantially fewer issues when AIMS is implemented in routine care, since patients know they 
25 
will receive AIMS and the feedback, AIMS can now be presented as evidence-based care, and ongoing 
26 
technological developments should make more used-friendly devices available shortly. Indeed, in a 
27 
pharmacy-based HIV-treatment adherence clinic in Lausanne (Switzerland) that uses MEMS-monitoring 
28 
in routine care, refusal of MEMS-monitoring is rare (personal communication with Dr. M.P. Schneider).

Evidence before this study 
4 
Two systematic reviews synthesizing the evidence on the (cost)effectiveness of medication adherence 
5 
interventions up to January and July 2013, did not identify any adherence interventions that were 
6 
effective and cost-effective. We conducted two updated searches to identify the most recent evidence 
7 
on (cost)effectiveness of HIV treatment adherence interventions. We searched for effectiveness and 
8 
cost-effectiveness evidence from RCTs conducted in high-income countries, with at least 12 months 
9 
follow-up, including a clinical outcome, and focusing on adult HIV infected patients. Interventions had 
10 
to promote autonomous behaviour (i.e., directly observed therapy interventions were excluded) and 
11 
treatment simplification studies (e.g., once versus twice daily medication) were excluded.

16 
year). Databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase. Search dates: January 2013 to October 2016. 
17 
Search results: 529 unique titles were obtained of which 27 evaluated an adherence intervention. 
18 
Twenty-six were excluded as they were short-term and small-scale (pilot)studies, and/or conducted in 
19 
low-resource settings, and/or focused on youth, and/or did not have an RCT design. The one eligible 
20 
RCT evaluated the Managed Problem Solving (MaPS) intervention by Gross and colleagues which – 
21 
similarly to the AIMS intervention – utilises electronic monitoring feedback in an interpersonal (1-on-1) 
22 
intervention. MaPS was delivered outside of routine clinical care by specially trained staff and is more 
23 
labor intensive than AIMS: approximately 250 minutes of face-to-face contact plus 22 telephone calls 
24 
per patient over a 12-month period. MaPS improved adherence (primary outcome; 1.78 (95% CI,1.07-
25 
2.96)), and the effect on detectable/undetectable viral load (secondary outcome) was on the border of 
26 
significance (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 0.94-2.31). A particular strength of the trial was the high consent 
27 
rate, which may reflect participants’ positive perception of the trial and intervention, but may in part 
28 
also be due to the financial incentives offered for completing study measures. Possible trial 
29 
weaknesses were (differential) attrition (36% in MaPS and 26% in controls) and – according to the 
30 
  
22 
 
Cochrane risk of bias tool – a missing data imputation method that ’can lead to serious bias’ (i.e., 
1 
missing equals treatment failure). No cost-effectiveness analysis was reported.

6 
2015 or 2016) in year. Databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase. Search dates: January 2013 to 
7 
October 2016. Search results: 137 unique titles/abstracts were scanned and 6 studies were examined 
8 
in more detail. Five studies were directly excluded as they were only examining costs (not cost-
9 
effectiveness), and/or were conducted in low-resource settings, and/or were a conference abstract (so 
10 
quality could not be assessed). The one eligible study by Ownby and colleagues (2013) reported the 
11 
cost-effectiveness of a computer-delivered intervention to promote adherence to HIV medication 
12 
(Florida, United States). This evaluation was, however, based on effectiveness data from a subgroup 
13 
analysis in a short-term intervention feasibility study. Further limitations were that the effectiveness 
14 
data was derived from self-reported adherence and did not line-up with the effectiveness input in the 
15 
economic model (i.e., CD4 counts were used to define health states); hence, the authors had to make 
16 
assumptions about the relationship between their self-reported adherence measure and CD4 counts, 
17 
which were not supported by empirical data– and in fact opposed by some studies. 
18 
 
19 
Hence, these (updated) searches did not identify any adherence interventions from high-quality, long-
20 
term trials and economic evaluations that provided evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. 
21 
 
22 
Added value of this study 
23 
To our knowledge, this carefully designed multi-center, randomized controlled trial and economic 
24 
model are the first to demonstrate that an adherence intervention can produce meaningful effects on 
25 
viral load and be cost-effective in a high-resource setting. In fact, this study shows that (HIV) treatment 
26 
adherence interventions can increase QALYs while saving resources, even when compared against 
27 
medium-to-high quality treatment-as-usual. Moreover, AIMS requires few resources as it has been 
28 
adapted to fit in routine HIV clinic services, which should facilitate implementation in routine care. 
29 
 
30 
  
23 
 
Implications of all the available evidence 
1 
HIV treatment adherence interventions can benefit patients, even in high-resource settings, and lead 
2 
to gains in QALYs while saving resources. AIMS seems at present to be the only adherence 
3 
intervention of which the effects have been replicated in consecutive trials. The current economic 
4 
evaluation also provides robust evidence on cost-effectiveness. Implementation of AIMS in routine 
5 
clinical care is therefore recommended.  
6 
 
7 
 
8 
Similarly, a recent systematic review identified a lack of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of HIV 
9 
treatment adherence interventions, as it identified only one cost-effective HIV treatment adherence 
10 
intervention evaluated in an RCT and subjected to a high-quality economic evaluation.16 However, the 
11 
paper did not report evidence of intervention effectiveness, or the content of the control and experimental 
12 
interventions, so that generalizability, replicability, and scalability of the intervention (effects) are 
13 
unclear.16 Our aim was to collect and report this information, and conduct a similarly high-quality 
14 
economic evaluation. Given the absence of a suitable and up-to-date Markov model for that purpose, a 
15 
new model was developed using ISPOR-SMDM guidelines.26 Up-to-date cohort data (2008-2015) from 
16 
all registered HIV patients in the Netherlands meeting our inclusion criteria were used to describe the 
17 
natural course of illness. Besides effects on costs (health care and productivity) and quality of life, the 
18 
model also incorporated HIV transmissions avoided given the evidence that lower viral loads reduce 
19 
transmission risk.2,8 Although a limitation of the current model was the absence of trial data to populate 
20 
the full health state transition matrix, the finding that AIMS is more effective and saves resources was 
21 
robust as all scenarios and sensitivity analyses produced the same result. 
22 
 
23 
The cumulative results of the current multi-centre RCT and the previous pilot study and single-centre 
24 
RCT, show that AIMS requires few resources, is feasible to deliver in routine care, and is acceptable to 
25 
health care providers and patients (although more patient-friendly electronic monitoring devices are 
26 
desirable). Moreover, they demonstrate relevant and replicable effects of AIMS on adherence (in the 
27 
pilot study and single-centre RCT) and viral load (in the single-centre RCT and multi-centre RCT).17,18 
28 
On average patients receiving TAU had a 1.26 higher log viral load than AIMS patients, and AIMS 
29 
reduced the risk of treatment failure (2 consecutive detectable viral loads) by 61% (22.8% versus 9.0%). 
30 
  
24 
 
These effects were comparable for treatment naïve and treatment experienced patients at-risk for viral 
1 
rebound (see subgroup analyses in the Appendix), and despite some risk of contamination and the 
2 
medium to high-quality TAU adherence support provided to the control group. The economic analysis 
3 
showed that AIMS is dominant and that when the intervention is provided to 10,000 patients over a 
4 
period of 18 months, the approximate savings would be 5,300,300 euro while 340 QALYs would be 
5 
gained. As these results have been obtained in a heterogeneous sample of patients and clinics, we 
6 
would expect at least similar effects if AIMS was to be rolled out nationally in the Netherlands, and in 
7 
other countries were HIV care is organized in a similar manner (i.e., western Europe). Nation-wide 
8 
training of health care professionals, reimbursement of electronic monitors, and adoption of AIMS in 
9 
national HIV-treatment guidelines in the Netherlands is currently being negotiated, as a first step. 
10 
 
11 
In conclusion, the current pragmatic, randomized controlled trial and the economic model demonstrates 
12 
that AIMS is feasible to deliver in routine are, reduces viral load, increases QALY, and saves resources. 
13 
To our knowledge this is the first HIV treatment adherence intervention for which such an evidence-base 
14 
has been established. The AIMS intervention should thus be scalable and the results generalizable to 
15 
the wider population of patients and HIV clinics – at least in high-income settings. Implementation of 
16 
AIMS in routine HIV clinical care is therefore strongly recommended.

Part II – Details on the strategy for MEMS-use 
Patients in the Netherlands often prefer to use their own medication box over the MEMS-cap bottle, due to its design [23, 24]. All treatment-experienced patients 
had to agree with baseline MEMS-monitoring, however, since this was used to determine trial eligibility. For patients who are then randomized to the intervention, 
the use of MEMS-caps has clear advantages: it offers a detailed overview of adherence to discuss with the health care professionals. Patients value that 
information highly [23]. For patients in the TAU arm, there are no such advantages of using the MEMS-caps. In both arms study participation was prioritized 
over the use of the MEMS-caps. So patients who indicated that they would not want (to continue) participation in the trial because of the MEMS-monitoring 
were allowed to discontinue MEMS-monitoring. As MEMS-data feedback is an important element of the AIMS intervention, if AIMS patients expressed wanting 
to discontinue MEMS-use, nurses would first discuss with patients the intermittent use of MEMS-caps (i.e., only the 4 weeks prior to the next visit) before 
agreeing with discontinuation of MEMS-monitoring. 
 
The main reasons for a subgroup of patients not wanting to use the MEMS-caps in this study were (a) it is bulky and looks like a medication bottle, so hard to 
discretely carry with them when they are not at home; and (b) it has only a single compartment. These designs issues are currently being, or have already been, 
addressed by various companies.

Part III – TAU and AIMS description 
 
Panel 1. Treatment-as-usual versus the Adherence Improving self-Management Strategy 
Both TAU and AIMS were delivered as part of routine care. Trained HIV/AIDS nurses delivered the adherence support in the HIV clinic during routine clinic 
visits. TAU and AIMS share several objectives, as well as so-called ‘behaviour change techniques’ (i.e., the active ingredients of behaviour change 
interventions) for realising these objectives. For example, both aim for patients being informed about the role of adherence for long-term treatment success, 
that patients are motivated, and have a medication intake plan that fits in their daily life. Key differences are that AIMS has more objectives (i.e., addresses 
more determinants of adherence), and uses more and more advanced behaviour change techniques to accomplish these objectives. Additionally, whereas 
TAU relies on patients’ ability and willingness to self-report (barriers to) adherence, AIMS uses electronic medication monitors that produce objective, 
detailed, longitudinal adherence reports. Finally, AIMS uses several carefully developed materials and information resources in each step of the intervention. 
 
The Table below summarises the Rationale (objectives), Materials, Procedures, and Behaviour Change Techniques for TAU and AIMS. Under Procedures, 
we link the activities described to the objectives and materials. AIMS intervention materials can be requested from the lead author. 
 
TAU 
AIMS 
                                           Rationale: behaviour change objectives 
1. Enhancing understanding of the 
relationship between (non) adherence 
and outcomes 
2. Evoking motivation for high 
adherence 
3. Facilitating the translation of 
intention for high adherence into 
action, and the overcoming of 
adherence barriers for 
achieving/maintaining good adherence 
4. Offering continuous professional 
support 
5 Addressing side effects (an 
adherence barrier) 
6. Feeding back viral load and CD4 
cell counts 
1. Ensuring understanding and storage of information in long-term  memory of relation (non) adherence and 
outcomes 
2. Evoking internal motivation for high adherence 
3. Raising awareness of own adherence and barriers/facilitators  
4. Evoking motivation for improving adherence 
5. Facilitating the translation of intention for high(er) adherence into action, and the overcoming of adherence 
barriers for achieving/maintaining good adherence 
6. Enhancing self-efficacy for changing suboptimal, or maintaining good adherence 
7. Consolidating/protecting motivation and self-efficacy for high adherence  
8. For treatment-initiating patients only: Strengthening/introducing beliefs about the perceived needs for, and 
reducing concerns about, antiretroviral treatment 
 
Note that TAU objectives 4, 5, and 6 were also delivered to AIMS patients as part of routine care. 
                                                            How: Materials used 
  
36 
 
1. Patient information leaflet 
 
1. Easy-to-remember graph explaining how drug levels vary with (non)adherence patterns, and impact on 
treatment outcomes 
2. Seven example adherence reports from electronic monitors ranging from excellent to poor adherence  
3. Drop-down lists with common reasons other patients have for achieving high levels of adherence  
4. MEMS (view)-cap to monitor own adherence and printed personal adherence reports 
5. Templates for action plans and coping plans 
6. Drop-down lists with common reasons for non-adherence and effective solutions for dealing with these 
problems (e.g., electronic reminders, social support, planning ahead for holidays) 
7. Ruler (1-10 scale) to score own confidence in improving adherence  
8. For treatment initiating patients only: score sheet of 5 reasons for, and 5 concerns about, initiating treatment 
        How: Procedures (activities, and how they relate to the objectives and materials described) 
When the physician, nurse, and 
patient agreed treatment should be 
initiated, typically the following 
activities were done to support 
adherence:  
 
1. Patients are verbally explained how 
the medication works and what the 
relation is between adherence, viral 
replication, and treatment outcomes. 
This includes risks (e.g., viral 
resistance) and benefits (e.g., healthy 
immune system, less infectious) of 
(non) adherence. Information leaflet 
provided (Objectives 1 and 2, Material 
1). 
2. Patients are explained how, how 
often, and in what dose the medication 
should be taken (Objective 3) 
3. Nurse and patient discuss when it is 
best for each individual patient to take 
their medication (at what time, where, 
We first explain AIMS for treatment-experienced patients, then explain the differences with treatment-initiating 
patients: Prior to the first AIMS intervention visit, treatment-experienced patients used an electronic medication 
monitor for 4-8 weeks. Data were downloaded and a website guided patients and nurses through the steps 
below. Tailoring to needs and abilities of individual patient, was a core component of each step. 
 
1. Started with the same educational activities as for TAU step 1, except that Material 1 was used to facilitate 
explanation /discussion and increase transfer of information provided to long-term memory (Objective 1 and 2, 
Material 1). 
2. Nurse explains seven exemplar MEMS-reports ranging from perfect to poor adherence, linking this to the 
adherence-outcome information discussed in Step 1. Patient is asked to select one adherence report reflecting 
how they would like to take their medication (‘Desired adherence level’) and explain why this is important to them 
personally/in the long-run (Objective 2, Material 2 and 3).* 
3. Nurse prints patients’ own MEMS-report (‘Actual adherence level’) and a discussion follows which includes 
reinforcement of (periods of) good adherence, and inducing a state of cognitive dissonance by comparing 
(periods of) suboptimal adherence with patients’ desired adherence level defined in Step 2 (Objectives 3 and 4, 
Material 4) 
4. Patient and nurse use the MEMS-report to identify non-adherence patterns and causes. Patient is encouraged 
to identify solutions to deal with these barriers, using drop-down list of common adherence barriers and solutions 
if useful. These are written down in coping plans (if-then format) and – if desired - printed for the patient to take 
home (Objectives 3 and 5; Materials 4, 5 and 6). 
5. The nurse asks the patient to select an adherence goal for the next visit (using Material 2) and to score 
confidence (10-point scale) in being able to accomplish that goal given their action/coping plans. If patient

linking intake to daily routines or using 
reminder devices that can serve as 
cues) (Objective 3) 
4. Patient are given a phone number 
to call in case of difficulties (e.g., side 
effects, adherence) (Objective 4) 
 
During follow-up visits (this also 
applies to treatment-experienced 
patients) 
5. Patient and nurse discuss self-
reported adherence (problems) and try 
to identify solutions that would work for 
that patient (Objective 3) 
6. Nurse/Physician ask about any 
side-effects and discuss how to deal 
with them (if severe, change of 
regimen is considered) (Objective 5) 
7. Nurses provide viral load and CD4 
cell count feedback. If results are 
positive, this serves to reinforce 
adherence. If results are negative, 
adherence problems or other causes 
(e.g., drug resistance, drug 
interactions) are explored (Objective 6) 
 
 
confidence is low, the nurse explores whether important adherence barriers have been unaddressed; and if not, if 
their adherence goal should be tackled incrementally rather than at once (Objective 6, Material 7). 
6. The patient is offered a MEMS-view cap, with a display on top showing how often the bottle has been opened 
that day. This serves as a direct feedback mechanism for missed/late doses, supporting adherence self-
monitoring (Objective 3, Material 4). Patient is given printed adherence report and plans. 
 
During subsequent intervention sessions… 
7. Nurse and patient evaluate whether the action/coping plans were successful, if there were any new barriers, 
and how the patient dealt with those.  
8. Patients’ new MEMS-report is printed and discussed. Improvements/good adherence is reinforced and 
attributed to the persons’ efforts/capabilities (Objectives 3 and 7, Materials 4). 
9. The causes of suboptimal/disappointing adherence levels are explored, trying to ensure patients attribute 
‘failure’ to controllable/avoidable causes (i.e., a learning experience). Adherence goals and plans are revised, and 
if needed new/alternative solutions are identified and written down in if-then coping plans. If patients have 
excellent adherence, the nurse and patient focus on behavioural maintenance by discussing what could be 
potential barriers disrupting their routine (e.g., a holiday) and identifying coping strategies for those barriers 
(Objectives 5 and 7;  Materials 4, 5, an 6). 
10. Replicates Step 5. 
 
The aim in this study was that patients reach their desired level of adherence during the first ±5 months of the 
intervention, strive for behavioural maintenance during the next ±5 months, followed by a follow-up period of 
another ±5 months. 
 
The differences in AIMS for treatment-initiating patients were in Session 1 and related to the patients not having 
any electronically compiled adherence reports yet (as they still had to initiate their treatment). Step 3 was 
skipped. Step 4 focused on developing a written medication intake plan (when, where and how to take the 
medication; linked with daily routines or other cues), an action plan (e.g., to plan organising social support or 
storing of spare doses of medication at convenient places) and a coping plan (identifying solutions to anticipated 
adherence barriers). 
 
Note that Steps 4, 6, and 7 were also delivered to AIMS patients as part of their routine care.

Part IV – Details on the sample size computation 
The study was powered to detect an effect on plasma viral load, measured at three consecutive time points (Time points 2, 3, and 4), while controlling for 
baseline viral load. A sample of 230 randomized patients was required to obtain 80% power to detect a significant intervention effect on viral load for at least 
one of three time points with alpha = .05 (two-sided), using a Bonferroni correction. The sample size calculation was conservatively based on a dichotomous 
outcome variable (detectable versus non-detectable viral load) using the following assumptions: (a) 22 nurses deliver the AIMS intervention and treatment-as-
usual, (b) a nurse recruits on average 11 patients for the trial, (c) a maximum dropout rate of 10%, (d) 20% of treatment-experienced patients and all treatment-
initiating patients have a detectable viral load at baseline, and (e) depending on the nurse, (i) 60% to 80% of the patients receiving TAU achieve an undetectable 
viral load during follow-up, and (ii) the percentage of undetectable viral loads increases for patients in the intervention condition by 5 to 20 percentage points 
(12.5% on average, based on the effects observed in the RCT) [24]. This sample size computation took into account that baseline viral load would be used as 
a covariate to enhance power [24], and that a multilevel model with random intercepts and random treatment effects at the nurse level would be used. 
 
Note that a change in inclusion/exclusions criteria shortly before recruitment initiation led to an adjusted sample size computation. The rationale and details 
have been reported both on clinicaltrials.gov and in the published trial protocol [22].

Part V – Details on statistical models 
The primary intent-to-treat analysis used a mixed-effects (multilevel) model [33,34]. A factor for time point (3 levels), group (2 levels), and their interaction were 
the primary variables of interest. Baseline viral load and the stratification variable (treatment-experienced versus treatment-naïve) were added to the model as 
covariates; as well as a four-level factor for ethnicity (Caucasian, Sub-Saharan African, Caribbean, and Others patients), as ethnicity was identified as an 
important prognostic covariate [15, 26]. Viral load values were log10-transformed before the analysis. Values for undetectable viral loads (e.g., <40 copies/ml) 
were replaced by the corresponding detection limit. To account for the nesting of the three follow-up measurements within patients and the nesting of patients 
within nurses, random intercepts at the patient and nurse level were added to the model. Since nurses administered both the control and intervention treatment, 
and may differ in how well they implement the intervention, a random group effect was added at the nurse level (and allowed to be correlated with the random 
intercepts at the same level). The model was fitted using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation. 
 
The time point (Time 2, 3, and 4), group, and time-by-group interaction (note that this interaction does not test for an intervention effect from baseline to 
follow-up, but for a group effect over the 3 follow-up time points) were tested with Wald-type F-tests. In the absence of a time-by-group interaction, the overall 
intervention effect can be estimated by a between-group (marginal) contrast across the three follow-up time points. For easier interpretation, the estimated 
group difference (with corresponding 95% CI) was exponentiated (with base 10) and therefore reflects the average viral load ratio of the control versus the 
intervention group. Relationships between the covariates and follow-up viral loads are also expressed as viral load ratios. To examine the consistency of the 
intervention effect, the random group effect at the nurse level was tested using a likelihood ratio test. Post model fitting checks included examining the size and 
distribution of the random effects and residuals and checking for autocorrelation in the residuals. 
 
The primary analysis was supplemented by dichotomizing the viral load values into detectable versus undetectable, based on the viral load detection limit 
used in each respective clinic. A three-level mixed-effects logistic regression model was then fitted to these data with fixed and random effects as described 
previously, with the addition of the detection limit of the viral load test as an additional covariate, while baseline viral load was replaced by the detection status 
at baseline (detectable versus undetectable). 
  
41 
 
 
In an additional viral load analysis, data across time points were aggregated by determining which patients had detectable viral loads on two consecutive 
follow-up measurements (based on the detection limit of the viral load test in the respective clinic), which we defined as treatment failure. This outcome was 
analysed with a two-level mixed-effects logistic regression model with random effects at the nurse level. The same covariates as in the previous model were 
included. The logistic regression models were fitted using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation and Wald-type chi-square and z-tests were used to test the 
significance of the fixed effects in the model. 
 
Finally, intervention effects on CD4 cell counts (secondary analysis) were examined using the same model as for the primary log10-transformed viral load 
analyses, except that baseline viral load was replaced by the baseline CD4 cell count. 
 
 
Based on the fitted models, marginal estimates of the group-specific means (viral load and CD4 analyses) and risks (detectable viral load and treatment 
failure analyses) were obtained, using the median value at baseline for continuous covariates (i.e., baseline viral load and detection limit) and the observed 
proportions at baseline for categorical covariates (i.e., treatment-experienced versus treatment-naïve, ethnicity, and detection status at baseline). 
 
Analyses were carried out in R (version 3.1.2) using the nlme package and Stata (version 13.1) using functions mixed and meqrlogit. The statistician conducting 
the analyses was blinded to group assignment.

Part VII – Results including covariates and subgroup analyses 
 
Primary Analysis 
The mixed-effects multilevel model showed that the intervention was effective across the three time points (F(1, 196) = 6.40, p = .012). Overall, patients in the 
control group had viral loads that were on average 1.26 times (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.52) higher than those in the intervention group during follow-up. There was no 
indication of a change in the intervention effect across the three follow-up time points (time-by-group interaction (F(2,409) = 0.75, p = .47) or an overall effect 
of time regardless of group (F(2, 409) = 0.62, p = .54). There was no significant variability of the treatment effect across nurses (p = .14). Estimated marginal 
viral load was 35.44 copies/ml (95% CI: 29.91 to 42.00) in the intervention group and 44.53 copies/ml (95% CI: 35.47 to 55.89) in the control group. 
 
Viral loads at follow-up were significantly related to baseline viral load, with a one-point increase in log10 baseline viral load (e.g., from 100 to 1000 copies/ml) 
leading on average to 1.33 times higher viral loads at follow-up (95% CI: 1.19 to 1.48). Viral loads for treatment-experienced patients were on average 2.49 
times higher than those of treatment naive patients (95% CI: 1.74 to 3.56). Ethnicity just failed to be a significant predictor when considering the factor as a 
whole (F(3,196) = 2.46, p = .064). Nevertheless, compared to Caucasian patients, viral loads were 1.26 times higher for patients with a Caribbean (95% CI: 
0.97 to 1.64) and 1.32 times higher for patients with an African ethnicity (95% CI: 1.02 to 1.69). On the other hand, patients with some other ethnic identity had 
on average lower viral loads, but due to the relatively small size of this group, the viral load ratio (i.e., 0.88) was not estimated precisely (95% CI: 0.59 to 1.31). 
 
Post model fitting checks revealed that a small number of the viral load measurements (11 out of 634) were quite high (above 1,000 copies/ml, with a 
maximum of 225,014) and led to some noteworthy outliers and an extremely large correlation between the random intercepts and group effects at the nurse 
level (r = .93). Censoring these values at 1,000 copies/ml resolved these issues, but did not alter any of the previous conclusions, except that the ethnicity factor 
then became significant (F(3,196) = 3.61, p = .014). 
 
Post-hoc Analyses 
  
46 
 
The three-level mixed-effects logistic regression model, in which the viral load values were dichotomized into detectable versus undetectable viral loads, 
generally confirmed the previous results, although the group effect just failed to be significant at α = .05 (χ2(df = 1) = 3.66, p = .056). The time-by-group interaction 
(χ2(df = 2) = 1.38, p = .50) and the time effect (χ2(df = 2) = 4.81, p = .09) were again not significant. However, the close to significant time effect suggests a 
possible decrease in the proportion of patients with a detectable viral load over the three follow-up time points, irrespective of group. Overall, patients in the 
control group had 1.89 times higher odds of having a detectable viral load across the three time points (95% CI: 0.98 to 3.65). The nurse level variability in the 
treatment effects was again not significant (p = .99). Estimated marginal risks of a detectable viral load were 9.6% (95% CI: 3.8% to 15.4%) and 16.7% (95% 
CI: 8.2% to 25.3%) in the intervention and control group, respectively. 
 
Those with a detectable viral load at baseline had 7.67 times higher odds of also having a detectable viral load at follow-up (95% CI: 3.10 to 18.98). 
Moreover, the odds of a detectable viral load were 7.47 times higher in treatment-experienced versus treatment-naive patients (95% CI: 3.02 to 18.49). Not 
surprisingly, the odds of a detectable viral load at follow-up was related to the detection limit of the test, with 1.58 times higher odds (95% CI: 1.12 to 2.22) for 
a 10-point decrease in the detection limit (e.g., from 50 to 40 copies/ml). Finally, in comparison to the primary analyses, ethnicity was clearly not significant 
(χ2(df = 3) = 1.95, p = .58). 
 
Considering the analysis for treatment failure, 19 out of the 112 patients in the control group (17.0%, 95% CI: 10.8% to 25.5%) and 8 out of the 109 
intervention patients (7.3%, 95% CI: 3.5% to 14.4%) had two consecutive detectable viral loads post-randomization. The two-level logistic regression model for 
treatment failure indicated a significant group difference (χ2(df = 1) = 5.61, p = .012). The odds of treatment failure were 2.99 times higher in the control group 
(95% CI: 1.21 to 7.38), corresponding to estimated risks of treatment failure of 9.0% (95% CI: 2.4% to 15.7%) in the intervention and 22.8% (95% CI: 11.7% to 
34.0%) in the control group. Again, no heterogeneity in treatment effects was observed across nurses (p = 1.0). The odds of treatment failure were 4.17 times 
higher for those with a detectable viral load at baseline (95% CI: 0.88 to 19.78) and 6.97 times higher for treatment-experienced patients (95% CI: 1.46 to 
33.32). Ethnicity was not a significant predictor (χ2(df = 1) = 1.27, p = .26). Note that ethnicity was dichotomized in this model (Caucasian versus other) to avoid 
perfect separation (there were no treatment failures in the 11 patients falling into the ‘other’ category).

The mixed-effects multilevel model for CD4 cell-count showed that the intervention was not effective across the three time points (F(1, 196) = 2.38, p = 
.12). However, there was a significant time-by-group interaction (F(2,398) = 3.09, p = 0.047), so that the effect of group cannot be examined with a marginal 
contrast across the 3 follow-up time points. The per time point analysis suggest an initial advantage of being in the intervention group at Time 1 (mean difference 
31.00, 95% CI: -8.37 to 70.37), after which the control group catches up at Time 2 (mean difference 6.55, 95% CI: -46.03 to 32.92), but then the CD4 cell count 
in the control group remains stable while it further increases in the intervention group, leading to a significant difference at Time point 3 (mean difference 39.39, 
95% CI: 0.10 to 78.67). See Figure below, with the reference group being treatment-experienced, Caucasian patients with a median CD4 cell count (i.e., 0) at 
baseline. Estimated marginal means were 550.89 cells/mm3 (95%CI: 520.40 to 581.39), 562.46 cells/mm3 (95%CI: 531.65 to 593.28), and 597.79 cells/mm3 
(95%CI: 567.07 to 628.52) in the intervention group across the three follow-up points, compared to 519.90 cells/mm3 (95%CI: 489.31 to 550.49), 569.02 
cells/mm3 (95%CI: 538.69 to 599.35), and 558.41 cells/mm3 (95%CI: 528.21 to 588.61) in the control group. 
 
The model also revealed a main effect of time (F(2,398) = 6.03, p = .003). Both a higher CD4 cell count at baseline (F (1,196) = 470.55, p <.0001) and 
being treatment-naïve at the start of the study (F (1,196) = 27.59, p <.0001) were strong predictors of CD4 during follow-up. Ethnicity did not predict CD4 values 
during follow-up (F (3,196) = 1.89, p = .13). 
 
Subgroup analyses for Mean Viral Load 
Although the study was not powered to detect a treatment effect for subgroups or per time point, visual inspection of the marginal effects can reveal relevant 
trends. Figure 1a shows that the effects for treatment naïve and treatment experienced patients are very similar. Figure 1b suggests that Caucasian and sub-
Saharan African patients benefit most from the intervention, whereas patients with a Caribbean or Other background do not (these latter groups were small and 
had high viral suppression rates throughout the trial in both arms). Figure 1c suggests that the intervention has a strong initial effect on viral load, that reduces 
at follow-up 2 (Time point 3) and then is sustained at follow-up 3 (Time point 4).
