ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate whether there is a seasonal
variation in the incidence of gestational diabetes
mellitus (GDM).
Research design and methods: This retrospective
cohort study of 60 306 eligible South Australian live-
born singletons during 2007–2011 recorded in the
South Australian Perinatal Statistics Collection (SAPSC)
examined the incidence of GDM in relation to estimated
date of conception (eDoC). Fourier series analysis was
used to model seasonal trends.
Results: During the study period, 3632 (6.0%)
women were diagnosed with GDM. Seasonal modeling
showed a strong relation between GDM and eDoC
(p<0.001). Unadjusted and adjusted models (adjusted
for maternal age, body mass index (BMI), parity,
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and chronic
hypertension) demonstrated the presence of a peak
incidence occurring among pregnancies with eDoC in
winter ( June/July/August), with a trough for eDoc in
summer (December/January/February). As this was a
retrospective study, we could only use variables that
had been collected as part of the routine registration
system, the SAPSC.
Conclusions: This study is the first population-based
study to demonstrate a seasonal variation for GDM.
Several maternal lifestyle and psychosocial factors
associated with seasonality and GDM may be
influential in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of
GDM. Ambient temperature, physical activity, nutrient
intake, and vitamin D levels may affect maternal
physiology, and fetal and placental development at the
cellular level and contribute to the development of
GDM. The mechanisms underlying these possible
associations are not fully understood and warrant
further investigation.
INTRODUCTION
According to current guidelines, gestational
diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as carbo-
hydrate intolerance, with onset or first recog-
nition during pregnancy.1 The incidence of
GDM has increased several folds over the
years from 1.9% in 1989–1990 to 4.2% in
2003–2004.2 Currently, GDM is present in
∼7% of all pregnancies, varying from 1% to
10% depending on the studied population.1
The increase of GDM represents a significant
economic burden on society, with direct
medical costs of GDM in the USA in 2007
estimated at $636 million.3
GDM is an important contributor to mater-
nal morbidity. Women with GDM have a
1.5-fold increased risk of hypertensive disor-
ders of pregnancy,4 a 1.1-fold risk of delivery
by elective caesarean section,5 a 7.4-fold risk
of later type 2 diabetes (T2D)6 and a 2.2-fold
increased long-term risk of cardiovascular
disease (CVD)7 compared with those women
who had a normoglycemic pregnancy.
GDM has also important offspring health
effects, causing fetal morbidity and mortality.
In GDM, the mother and the fetus is hyper-
glycemic due to free transport of glucose
through the placenta. The fetus is forced
to
increase
its
own
insulin
production.8
Increased maternal glucose levels in preg-
nancy have been associated with increased
frequencies of preterm birth, birth injury, a
Significance of this study
What is already known about this subject?
▸ Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has import-
ant negative effects on maternal and offspring
health but the pathophysiology is not fully under-
stood. A seasonal variation in the incidence of
GDM has been suggested, but it has never been
shown in population-based studies before.
What are the new findings?
▸ This population-based study observed a clear
seasonality in the incidence of GDM, with a
peak incidence for pregnancies with conception
in winter and the lowest incidence for pregnan-
cies with conception in summer.
How might these results change the focus of
research or clinical practice?
▸ Our data point to specific biological mechanism
(s), such as maternal lifestyle choices and envir-
onmental factors, which may provide potential
targets for the prevention of GDM and warrant
further investigation.

 5.0-fold increased risk of large for gestational age babies,
a 2.2-fold increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia,
requirement for intensive neonatal care and hyperbiliru-
binemia.5 Pre-existing diabetes has been seen to be asso-
ciated
with
increased
frequencies
of
congenital
abnormalities.9 In adulthood, offspring from mothers
with GDM are at increased risk of developing obesity,
impaired glucose tolerance, T2D, and CVD.8
The pathophysiology of GDM is not fully understood,
but a number of risk factors have been implicated, such
as maternal overweight and obesity, low maternal birth
weight, race, increased maternal age, family history of
T2D, history of previous fetal death, and previous birth
of a macrosomic infant.10 11 Also, the recurrence rate of
GDM in subsequent pregnancies has shown to be as
high as 47.2%.12
Other risk factors associated with GDM are nutrient
intake, specifically high intake of saturated fat,10 high
ambient temperature,13 14 and a low maternal vitamin D
status.8 15–22 Physical activity before and during preg-
nancy is associated with a significantly lower risk of
developing GDM.23 Since some of these risk factors have
shown a seasonality,24–26 we hypothesized that the inci-
dence of GDM may differ over the seasons. A seasonal
trend of GDM could provide more insight on its patho-
physiology. So far, only one study has reported seasonal
changes in the prevalence of GDM.27
In an effort to increase the knowledge of mechanisms
regarding early pregnancy exposures that may influence
the development of GDM, we aimed to assess the sea-
sonal variation of GDM in a large population database.
We focused on the estimated date of conception (eDoC)
based on the hypothesis that the etiology of GDM lies
early in pregnancy (and often prepregnancy), weeks to
months before the clinical presentation of GDM.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study design and setting
This was a retrospective cohort study investigating the
incidence of GDM in relation to eDoC in South
Australia (SA) during 2007–2011. The majority of the
state’s population lives within the metropolitan area of
the state capital, Adelaide. Adelaide (situated 34°S 138°
E) is a coastal city with a Mediterranean climate, with
long hot dry summers (December, January, February)
and short cold rainy winters (June, July, August).
Database
Data were sourced from the South Australian Perinatal
Statistics Collection (SAPSC), maintained by the Pregnancy
Outcome Unit (POU) of SA Health. The SAPSC collects
information regarding the characteristics and outcome of
all births, of any gestation, and stillbirths and terminations
of pregnancy of at least 400 g birth weight or 20 weeks of
gestation, in South Australia. The data were notified by hos-
pital and homebirth midwives, and neonatal nurses using a
Supplementary Birth Record (SBR).
Data selection
The study included live-born singleton births in women
with a known body mass index (BMI) with a gestation of
20–42 weeks and a birth weight ≥400 g. Terminations of
pregnancy and women with pre-existing diabetes were
excluded from the analyses.
When the clinician documented that the woman had
GDM, this was listed in the SAPSC. This was based on
universal screening for GDM. All patients underwent
a 50 g glucose challenge test at 28 weeks. Patients with
an abnormal glucose challenge test (≥7.8 mmol/L)
underwent a glucose tolerance test
(GTT); fasting
≥5.5 mmol/L and/or 2-hour value ≥8 mmol/L were the
constant cut-off values to diagnose GDM in 2007–2011
in South Australia.
The eDoC was estimated based on the birth date and
gestational age at birth. Gestational age was determined by
best obstetric estimate and reported as completed weeks.
This estimate was based on the dating ultrasound (per-
formed at 8–13 weeks gestation) supported by the known
first day of the last menstrual period or by review of other
ultrasonography. The database did not indicate how gesta-
tional age was specifically determined for each woman,
but 99.1% of the women had an antenatal ultrasound.
Variables
The variables included were maternal age, BMI, parity,
ethnicity,
socioeconomic
status
(SES),
civil
status,
smoking status at time of conception, and in the second
half of pregnancy, chronic hypertension, asthma, and
fetal sex. BMI was calculated before 20 weeks of gestation
with
the
formula
BMI ¼ weight in kg=(height in m)2.
Underweight was defined as <18.5 kg/m2, normal weight
as 18.5–24.99 kg/m2, overweight as 25.00–29.99 kg/m2,
obese
as
30.00–39.99 kg/m2,
and
morbidly
obese
>40.00 kg/m2.
The
Australian
Bureau
of
Statistics’
Socioeconomic Index for Areas (SEIFA) population-based
quintile scores, derived from home address postcode,
were used to indicate the SES.28 For the civil status the
participants were divided into those with a stable partner
(married/de facto) and those without a stable partner.
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed with SPSS V.21.0 (SPSS,
2013). Fisher’s exact test and χ2 test were used to
compare categorical variables. Differences were consid-
ered significant when the p value was <0.05.
In the primary analysis, eDoC was studied as a continu-
ous
variable
using
Fourier
series
methods
(single
cosinor analysis).29 Fourier series are considered to be
the natural mathematic models for seasonality. To model
the underlying seasonality of eDoC, the first p pairs of
term of the Fourier series was employed:

 In this series, Θi is the point in the annual cycle that the
ith day on which eDoC occurred. Denoting the number
of days between 1 January 1950 and the ith day of
woman’s eDoC as Di, we calculated this angle in radians;
thus, Θi=2π (Di mod 365.25)/365.25. Thus, seasonal
effect of the eDoC on the binary pregnancy outcome is
modeled by adding S(Θi, p) to the linear predictor of a
logistic regression model so that βi and γi become para-
meters in a simple linear model. In these data, the first
pair of Fourier terms (F1 model: sine and cosine) was
significant based on a likelihood ratio test (α=0.10),
allowing us to use these in this study.
Seasonality of GDM was initially investigated using a
univariate logistic regression analysis using eDoC divided
in months as predictor. Subsequently, the model was run
with and without adjustment for potential confounders
defined a priori (maternal age, BMI, parity, ethnicity,
SES, civil status, smoking status, chronic hypertension,
asthma, and fetal sex) using effects coding. The average
of all months together was the reference in the model
when using effects coding.
Subsequently, multivariate logistic regression models
(Fourier series analysis) were fit by specifying a full
model with all available data on potential modifiers and
confounding variables defined a priori (see above).
Covariates were considered not to be influential and
were removed from the model via backward elimination
if their contribution to the model was not significant
(p>0.05). Coefficient correlation tests were performed
after every step of the model fitting process to test the
goodness of fit.
Ethics
The existence of personal identifying information in the
SAPSC was eliminated from the data file for analysis to
ensure that confidentially of all patient records was
maintained. The study protocol was approved by the
Human
Research
Ethics
Committee
of
the
South
Australian Department of Health (HREC/13/SAH/97).
RESULTS
Study population
Of a total 99 973 births registered between January 2007
and December 2011, 60 306 (60.3%) births were eligible
for the study. We excluded 25 (0.03%) births with a ges-
tational age of <20 weeks or >42 weeks, 269 (0.27%)
births in which the neonate had a birth weight <400 g,
121 (0.12%) terminations of pregnancy because of
chromosomal
and/or
congenital
anomalies,
357
(0.36%) stillbirths, 2961 (2.96%) non-singleton births,
35 542
(35.55%)
births
with
inadequately
recorded
maternal BMI, and 392 (0.39%) births in which preg-
nancy was complicated by pre-existing diabetes.
Incidence of GDM
During the study period, a total of 3632 (6.0%) women
were diagnosed with GDM. The incidence of GDM
increased significantly over the years from 4.9% in 2007
to 7.2% in 2011 (p <0.001 (table 1)). The characteristics
of the study population are presented in table 2.
Compared with non-GDM pregnancies, risk factors for
GDM included age >30 years, multiparity, increased
BMI, Asian ethnicity, low and very low SES, and a history
of chronic hypertension.
Seasonal models of GDM
The observed, unadjusted and adjusted probabilities for
GDM by eDoC are shown in figure 1. Both unadjusted
and adjusted predicted probabilities were based on the
logistic regression model fitting the first pair of Fourier
series terms and showed that GDM was significantly
related to season of eDoC (p<0.001).
The highest incidence of GDM was observed among
pregnancies with eDoC in June (6.74%). Unadjusted
seasonal modeling showed peak incidence of GDM for
pregnancies with eDoC in July (6.55%), while adjusted
seasonal modeling showed a peak incidence of GDM for
pregnancies with eDoC in August (6.60%).
The lowest incidence of GDM was observed among
pregnancies with eDoC in January (5.17%). Seasonal
modeling showed a corresponding pattern. Unadjusted
and adjusted predicted incidences showed a nadir for
pregnancies with eDoC in January (5.46% and 5.41%,
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS
Increasing incidence of GDM
The incidence of GDM in SA increased significantly
from 4.9% in 2007 to 7.2% in 2011. This is consistent
with the trend in the USA, where incidence increased
from 1.9% in 1989–1990 to 4.2% in 2003–2004.2 This
increase in incidence is not surprising giving the parallel
rise
in
prevalence
of
T2D
and
obesity8
and
also
increased focus on detection of GDM in pregnancy in
recent decades.
Seasonality of GDM
In this large South Australian birth cohort, we observed
a clear seasonality in the incidence of GDM based on
eDoC. The peak incidence was observed for pregnancies
with eDoC during winter and the lowest incidence for
pregnancies with eDoC during summer.

 So far, only one study reported a seasonal pattern in
the prevalence of GDM.27 The study carried out in
Wollongong (coastal city, 34°S), Australia, in 2010–2014,
analyzed the results of 7343 oral GTTs performed
between 24 weeks and 28 weeks gestation, and a total of
516 (7.0%) women were diagnosed with GDM. The
study found that in winter the median 1-hour and
2-hour glucose results were significantly lower compared
with the overall 1-hour and 2-hour results. A post hoc
analysis indicated that the prevalence of GDM based on
the 1-hour and 2-hour results was higher in summer
(4.6% and 4.4%, respectively) and lower in winter (2.6%
and 2.4%, respectively) compared with the overall preva-
lence of GDM. Interestingly, they did not find a seasonal
variation in fasting glucose levels. Diagnosis in summer
corresponds with eDoC in winter, which concurs with
our data.
Two previous studies reported that there was no sea-
sonal pattern in the incidence of GDM.30 31 An older
and small study, carried out by the same group in
Wollongong, Australia, in 1993–1994, analyzed a total of
2749 participants with an overall incidence of GDM of
6.7% (183 subjects). The seasonal fluctuation of GDM
showed an incidence of 7.4% (5.6–9.2) in autumn

 (March–May), corresponding with a conception in late
winter/early spring (August–October). An incidence of
5.5% (3.5–7.5) was observed in winter, corresponding
with
a
conception
in
late
spring/early
summer
(November–January). However, this seasonal fluctuation
was not statistically significant.30
Another small study was conducted in Plymouth
(coastal city, 50°N), UK, in 1996–1997. A total of 4942
pregnant women were studied, with an overall preva-
lence of GDM of 1.8% (90 women). The incidence of
GDM ranged from 2.3% (1.5–3.2) in spring, correspond-
ing with conception in autumn and the lowest incidence
of GDM of 1.4% (0.8–2.3) in winter, corresponding with
conception in summer. However, this seasonal fluctu-
ation was also not statistically significant.31
Small sample size (183 and 90 women with GDM,
respectively) and therefore lack of statistical power is the
most likely reason due to which these two prior small
studies could not detect significant seasonality. Also,
Plymouth has a very mild climate, with little fluctuation
in temperature and sun exposure, and therefore season-
ality is expected to be less distinct than in more extreme
climates. The actual trends were similar to the findings
in this large South Australian cohort. Inconsistencies in
the magnitude of GDM incidence are not surprising in
this type of study, since population composition, environ-
mental
exposures,
and
climates
differ
in
different
regions of the world.
Seasonality of type 2 diabetes
Previous studies have analyzed the seasonal variation in
T2D. A Hungarian study, investigating 26 695 cases of
T2D from 1999 to 2004 in Csongrad County, Hungary
(46°N), demonstrated a sinusoidal pattern for the inci-
dence of T2D in studied males and females, with a peak
incidence in spring and a trough in summer.32 This
finding in T2D diagnosis is not in line with what we
found in our GDM data. However, there are multiple
potential
reasons
for
this
apparent
discrepancy.
Standardized
testing
in
pregnancy
between
24
and
28 weeks gestation eliminates patient’s and doctor’s delay
in diagnosing GDM, versus T2D. Also, even though T2D
and GDM are associated, the timelines to diagnosis are
quite different.
Considering the Developmental origins of health and
disease concept,33 34 suggesting prenatal programming
of physiology, it can be hypothesized that T2D might
show a seasonal variation depending on month of
birth of the individual. Several studies have investigated
this relationship with conflicting results.35
36 In an
Ukranian study in three regions Charnigov (51°N),
Kherson (46°N) and Rivne (50°N) of 17 510 male and
34 704 female, type 2 diabetic patients showed a seasonal
pattern with a peak in births in April for males and
females, and a nadir of births for males in November
and for females in December.35 However, a large Danish
cohort study, investigating 223 099 people, of whom
12 468 developed T2D, did not find a relationship
between season of birth and the incidence of T2D.36
However, as this study used time of birth to indicate
season, it did not account for the fact that there was a
range of gestational ages from preterm to term, possibly
leading to confounding.
Possible mechanisms underlying the seasonality of GDM
In our analyses, we observed a seasonal variation of
GDM after adjusting for maternal age, BMI, parity, ethni-
city, SES, and chronic hypertension. These character-
istics change relatively little from month to month and
are not or barely modifiable. Owing to the retrospective
character of the present study we could not adjust for
several
other
meteorological,
maternal

 intake,25 and vitamin D status.26 Several studies have
shown that these factors have been associated with the
risk of GDM.13 21 23 37 38
Meteorological factors
Studies suggest that the incidence of GDM can be asso-
ciated with variable seasonal meteorological factors, spe-
cifically ambient temperature. A study in Porto Alegre
(temperate climate 30°S), Brazil, of 1030 pregnant indi-
viduals compared serum glucose in GTTs performed
between 24 and 28 weeks gestation with ambient tem-
perature. For every degree increase in ambient tempera-
ture, serum glucose increased by 0.07 mmol/L.13 The
Brazilian study suggest that the incidence of GDM may
be highest in summer. GDM is generally diagnosed at
24–28 weeks of gestation,39 which corresponds with con-
ception in winter. This is consistent with our findings
that
the
highest
incidence
was
seen
when
eDoC
occurred in winter.
Physical activity
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 34 929 partici-
pants and 2813 cases of GDM showed that prepregnancy
and early pregnancy physical activity were significantly
protective against GDM (55% and 24%, respectively,
lower risk of GDM).23 During pregnancy, the body is
subject to metabolic changes, especially during the third
trimester, when GDM is typically diagnosed. GDM is
thought to reflect an impaired capacity of the woman to
adjust to these metabolic changes, due to relative β-cell
dysfunction, that is, insulin secretion not keeping up
with the exaggerated state of insulin resistance, resulting
in abnormal glucose tolerance. An inverse association is
plausible, and it can be suggested that prepregnancy
and early pregnancy exercise may improve overall fitness
and glucose tolerance.23
A systematic review has shown seasonal variation in the
levels of physical activity in nonpregnant study popula-
tions. In general, the highest levels of physical activity
were seen in spring and summer, while the lowest levels
were seen in winter.24
These results are also consistent with our findings that
the lowest incidence of GDM occurred with summer
conceptions when women were more likely to be physic-
ally active. However, we are not aware of the studies
reporting seasonal variation in levels of activity in
pregnancy.
Nutrient intake
Seasonal variation of nutrient intake may affect metabol-
ism, and this may also provide clues to understand the
seasonal variation of GDM. Prospective25 and retrospect-
ive40 studies have demonstrated a seasonal trend in nutri-
ent intake in pregnant women. Unfortunately, data are
not completely consistent. Previous studies have shown
that a high total fat intake at time of diagnosis, in most
cases at 24–28 weeks gestation, is associated with an
increased risk for GDM.10 37 Interestingly, the total fat
intake in one study was shown to be highest in spring,25
whereas the other showed the highest fat intake in
summer.40 The latter corresponds to conception in
autumn and winter, which is consistent with our findings.
Vitamin D
Serum vitamin D levels have a seasonal variation, with
highest concentrations in summer and autumn and
lowest concentrations in winter and spring.26 This is not
surprising, since vitamin D is mainly derived from skin
exposure to sunlight and dietary intake.41 The lowest
dietary intake of vitamin D was seen in autumn and the
highest in spring.25 40
A recent meta-analysis of studies published between
2008 and 2015 with over 9200 women showed that low
vitamin D status associates with GDM.42 A vitamin D
response element in the human insulin receptor gene
promoter has been identified,43 suggesting a potential
role for vitamin D in enhancing insulin secretion. Wang
et al44 demonstrated that higher vitamin D levels stimu-
late increased β-cell mass and as such potentially also
β-cell insulin secretion capacity. However, other studies
have
reported
conflicting
results.
The
association
between vitamin D and its specific role in the develop-
ment
of
GDM
is
contentious
and
merits
further
investigation.
Strengths and weaknesses of the study
A major strength of this population-based study lies in
the large number of analyzed births. The SAPSC collects
information regarding the characteristics and outcome
of all births in SA, notified by hospital and homebirth
midwives, and neonatal nurses.
As this was a retrospective study, we could only use
variables that were already listed on the data set. GDM
was listed in the SAPSC when the clinician documented
that the women had GDM. In the study period, there
were stable criteria for diagnosis and a consistent
approach used by all care providers. This study included
only the live-born babies during the study period.
However, third trimester stillbirth is not very common,
so it is unlikely that this has influenced the seasonal vari-
ation of GDM observed in this study. Since 2007, SAPSC
began collecting data on BMI of the pregnant women.
We used BMI as one of our inclusion criteria, which
meant we had to exclude 35.55% of the total births
between January 2007 and December 2011. SAPSC valid-
ation studies have shown that notifications of births in
SA made by hospital and homebirth midwives, and hos-
pital neonatal nurses on the SBR were robust for the
parameters studied.45 The pregnancies analyzed in this
study could therefore be considered as a proper repre-
sentation
of
the
South
Australian
and
Australian
population.
Conclusion and further research
This representative study has identified a statistically sig-
nificant seasonal variation in the incidence of GDM.

 The etiology of GDM involves exposures that occur
before it is clinically recognized. This suggests that the
pathophysiologic mechanisms explaining (the seasonal-
ity of) GDM may have their origin early in pregnancy.
These epidemiological data also support exploring the
contributions of exposures with seasonal periodicity to
GDM, such as environmental and lifestyle differences.
The effect size of seasonality of GDM presented in this
paper is statistically significant, but unlikely to have
direct clinical implications. However, our data point to
specific biological mechanism(s) that warrant further
investigation that may provide potential targets for the
prevention of GDM. In particular, exposure(s) early in
pregnancy deserve attention. These may include season
of conception and vitamin D.
