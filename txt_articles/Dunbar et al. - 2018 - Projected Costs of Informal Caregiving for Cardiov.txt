INTRODUCTION: In a recent report, the American Heart Association 
estimated that medical costs and productivity losses of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) are expected to grow from $555 billion in 2015 to $1.1 
trillion in 2035. Although the burden is significant, the estimate does not 
include the costs of family, informal, or unpaid caregiving provided to 
patients with CVD. In this analysis, we estimated projections of costs of 
informal caregiving attributable to CVD for 2015 to 2035.
METHODS: We used data from the 2014 Health and Retirement Survey 
to estimate hours of informal caregiving for individuals with CVD by 
age/sex/race using a zero-inflated binomial model and controlling for 
sociodemographic factors and health conditions. Costs of informal 
caregiving were estimated separately for hypertension, coronary heart 
disease, heart failure, stroke, and other heart disease. We analyzed data 
from a nationally representative sample of 16 
731 noninstitutionalized 
adults ≥54 years of age. The value of caregiving hours was monetized by 
the use of home health aide workers’ wages. The per-person costs were 
multiplied by census population counts to estimate nation-level costs 
and to be consistent with other American Heart Association analyses of 
burden of CVD, and the costs were projected from 2015 through 2035, 
assuming that within each age/sex/racial group, CVD prevalence and 
caregiving hours remain constant.
RESULTS: The costs of informal caregiving for patients with CVD were 
estimated to be $61 billion in 2015 and are projected to increase to 
$128 billion in 2035. Costs of informal caregiving of patients with stroke 
constitute more than half of the total costs of CVD informal caregiving 
($31 billion in 2015 and $66 billion in 2035). By age, costs are the 
highest among those 65 to 79 years of age in 2015 but are expected to 
be surpassed by costs among those ≥80 years of age by 2035. Costs of 
informal caregiving for patients with CVD represent an additional 11% of 
medical and productivity costs attributable to CVD.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of informal caregiving for patients with 
CVD is significant; accounting for these costs increases total CVD costs 
to $616 billion in 2015 and $1.2 trillion in 2035. These estimates have 
important research and policy implications, and they may be used to 
guide policy development to reduce the burden of CVD on patients and 
their caregivers.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
U
nderstanding trends in the escalating costs of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) is important to de-
velop informed policy that ultimately reduces the 
economic impact of CVD on health care and society. A 
recent analysis by the American Heart Association sug-
gests that total direct (medical) and indirect (lost pro-
ductivity) costs of CVD, the most costly of all chronic 
diseases, are expected to grow from $555 billion in 
2015 to $1.1 trillion in 2035.1 Although this 20-year 
projected growth is significant, the estimate does not 
include the costs associated with informal caregiving 
provided to patients with CVD. To provide a more com-
plete representation of CVD costs, this analysis of pro-
jected costs of informal caregiving for individuals with 
CVD for 2015 to 2035 was undertaken to determine 
the influence of CVD caregiving on incremental costs of 
CVD to inform relevant policy recommendations.
In the United States, >65 million people currently 
provide care for a chronically ill, disabled, or aged fam-
ily member.2 Informal caregivers are most often family 
members such as spouses, adult children or other rela-
tives, partners, neighbors, and friends or multiple care-
givers who may or may not live in the same household 
and provide care in an unremunerated status. The term 
informal is frequently used to distinguish these unpaid 
caregivers from paid professional caregivers who pro-
vide formal home- or community-based care or institu-
tionalized care. Informal caregiving is defined as home 
care that is provided without payment by family mem-
bers or friends of the care recipient.
We acknowledge that despite the term informal, this 
type of caregiving is not informal or simple. Informal 
caregivers who provide care for loved ones with chronic 
illness such as CVD are essential, and the protracted 
stress and toll on their quality of life and health status 
have been well documented.3,4 The total opportunity 
cost of unpaid elder care, that is, the economic value 
of activities forgone as a result of caregiving such as 
lost wages, has been estimated at $522 billion annually, 
whereas the costs of replacing this care by unskilled and 
skilled paid care are $221 billion and $642 billion, re-
spectively.5 A recent review of family caregiver website 
conversations by the Coalition to Transform Advanced 
Care confirmed the stresses of informal caregiving by 
family members who reported issues such as a com-
promised career (>50%), inability to work (48%), de-
prioritization of work (33%), and negative impact on 
their disposable income and financial health (94%).6 Al-
though traditionally more women have served as care-
givers than men, women’s greater and longer participa-
tion in the workforce has resulted in a smaller pool of 
women readily available to assume caregiving roles,7,8 
and men currently represent ≈40% of informal care-
givers.9 Informal caregiving of elders and those with 
chronic conditions is a significant and costly phenom-
enon in the United States; a greater understanding of 
the magnitude of the burden of informal caregiving for 
patients with CVD and its projected growth is essential.
FACTORS INFLUENCING COST
Informal caregivers play an essential part in maintaining 
the health and well-being of individuals coping with se-
rious illness like CVD. The care they provide may be epi-
sodic, daily, occasional, and of short or long duration. 
Responsibilities of caregiving are also varied, ranging 
from helping with household tasks or self-care activi-
ties to handling coordination of multiple medical ap-
pointments and complex medical regimens that were 
once delivered only by licensed healthcare personnel in 
a hospital or other settings.10–13 Often, informal care-
givers must undertake these activities without needed 
information and training.12 Although some report posi-
tive aspects of this role, caregiving responsibilities are 
also associated with distressing physical, emotional, 
and economic effects that strain health, financial secu-
rity, and well-being.3,14–16 These burdens are particularly 
evident among caregivers who provide higher-intensity 
assistance with healthcare activities that involve more 
supervision and longer hours of care.3,14
More than half of informal caregivers hold jobs, and 
the “invisible work” of providing healthcare services 
that is not compensated often requires making work-
place accommodations that have been associated with 
productivity loss.12,14 Informal caregivers provide almost 
$470 billion in unpaid care, with an additional average 
of $7000/y in out-of-pocket costs for home modifica-
tions, transportation, reduced worktime, unpaid leave, 
and reduced savings.17 Previous studies have gleaned 
some insights by estimating informal caregiving costs 
and economic burden associated with heart failure18 
and stroke.19 One study of patients with end-stage con-
gestive heart failure found that 23% of families had 
lost all or most of their savings by the time the patient 
died.20 A recent Families Caring for an Aging America 
report from the National Academy of Sciences Engi-
neering and Medicine (NASEM)12 identified a number 
of factors that can place caregivers at financial risk. 
They may lose income, Social Security or other retire-
ment benefits, and career opportunities when they cut 
back on work hours or stop working. They may also in-
cur substantial out-of-pocket expenses that draw from 
the caregivers’ savings and undermine their own future 
financial security. The report also detailed other factors 
associated with financial harm, including coresidence 
or residing a long distance from the individual needing 
care; lack of other family members to share responsibili-
ties and costs; and, if employed, limited access to paid 
leave or a flexible workplace.

absenteeism and workday interruptions, and manage-
ment and administrative costs based on the time super-
visors spend handling issues of employed caregivers. The 
 
NASEM report12 highlighted the existence of some work-
place programs for caregiving employees and the anec-
dotal evidence suggesting their value in supporting care-
givers and retaining workers. The NASEM report explicitly 
called out the need for additional data and research as-
sessing the costs and outcomes of workplace programs 
for employers and the extent to which they help working 
caregivers juggle their caregiving and job responsibilities.
CURRENT POLICIES AFFECTING 
INFORMAL CAREGIVING FOR CVD
A variety of federal and state legislative proposals have 
emerged in recent years to mitigate challenges con-
fronted by caregivers and to help address support sys-
tem shortfalls. These initiatives are important because 
Medicare and Medicaid programs generally have not 
focused on providing direct caregiver services and sup-
ports other than Medicaid’s home- and community-
based services waiver, which gives states an option to 
cover respite care and caregiver education and train-
ing.12 Proposals pending in the current Congressional 
session seek to reinforce the importance of informal 
caregiving and to reduce burdens by creating medical 
leave insurance benefits, training and support services 
programs, and tax credits, including, for example, the 
following:
• The Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act estab-
lishes an Office of Paid Family and Medical Leave 
within the Social Security Administration and cre-
ates a “family and medical leave insurance” ben-
efit payment for individuals providing caregiving 
services who meet qualifying criteria.21
• The Community-Based Independence for Seniors 
Act establishes Community-Based Institutional 
Special Needs demonstration programs with select 
Medicare Advantage plans for providing long-
term care services benefits involving homemaker 
services, meal delivery, transportation, respite care, 
adult day care, and safety or other equipment.22
• The Credit for Caring Act of 2017 establishes a 
tax credit of up to $3000 annually for working 
family caregivers. The eligible caregiver must have 
incurred expenses caring for a qualified recipient 
and have earned income of at least $7500 for the 
year. A qualified recipient is defined as someone 
who bears a relationship to the caregiver and has 
been certified as having long-term needs.23
• The Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage 
Family Caregivers Act directs the Department of 
Health and Human Services secretary to develop, 
maintain, and periodically update a National Family 
Caregiving Strategy that includes information on 
palliative care, care planning, financial security, etc. 
Public input is required in the development of the 
strategy.24 The Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, 
and Engage Family Caregivers Act was signed into 
law on January 23, 2018.
• The Americans Giving Care to Elders Act provides 
financial relief to family caregivers by creating a tax 
credit for the costs of caring for an aging or ail-
ing relative. The legislation would help offset elder 
care expenses of up to $6000/y that include medi-
cal care, lodging away from home, adult day care, 
custodial care, respite care, assistive technologies 
and devices, environmental modifications, and 
counseling or training for a caregiver.25
• Federal tax benefits amend the Internal Revenue 
Code by providing tax credits on expenses incurred 
for caregiving services necessary for maintain-
ing employment, which may include obtaining 
household services, respite care, or other needed 
assistance.26
• The Caregiver Advise, Record, Enable Act 
enacted by >30 states assists family caregivers 
as their loved ones go into the hospital and as 
they transition home, transitions that often are 
stressful times in the CVD experience for caregiv-
ers.11,27–29 The Caregiver Advise, Record, Enable 
Act elevates the prominence of informal caregiv-
ers and their critical role as partners in care deliv-
ery by requiring hospitals to be accountable for 
(1) recording the name of the family caregiver(s) 
in the patient’s medical record, (2) informing the 
family caregivers when the patient is to be dis-
charged, and (3) providing the family caregiver 
with education and instruction in the medi-
cal tasks he or she will need to perform for the 
patient at home.30
• The Alzheimer’s Caregiver Support Act authorizes 
grant programs expanding caregiver training and 
support services for families and caregivers of indi-
viduals living with Alzheimer disease or related 
dementia.31
State and local governments may provide a number 
of programs and services that are supported by appro-
priations or implemented with legislation and regula-
tion. These include assistance in gaining access to pro-
grams and services, respite care to temporarily relieve 
caregivers from their responsibilities, and supplemental 
services such as a personal emergency response system, 
assistive technology, home-delivered meals, transporta-
tion, or home modifications. These kinds of support can 
be impactful and essential.
Such policy proposals offer important initial steps in 
raising the profile of informal caregivers and recogniz-
ing their integral supporting role in the care delivery 
process. Within this context, the estimated projections

of CVD for caregiving costs will provide data on which 
a more cohesive and comprehensive set of health re-
form policies and practices can be designed to meet 
the specific CVD care needs, to minimize the burdens 
experienced by informal caregivers, and to address the 
total economic impact of CVD.
METHODS
Overview
Estimated baseline and projected costs of informal 
caregiving for patients with CVD were generated with 
the methods detailed below. We used data from the 
2014 wave of the HRS (Health and Retirement Study) to 
estimate baseline costs of informal caregiving for CVD. 
The HRS is a longitudinal project sponsored by the Na-
tional Institute on Aging and the Social Security Admin-
istration that includes nationally representative data on 
Americans ≥54 years of age. The survey includes infor-
mation on the respondent’s physical and mental health, 
insurance coverage, financial status, family support sys-
tems, labor market status, and retirement planning.
Our analysis sample included 16 731 noninstitu-
tionalized respondents ≥54 years of age with an age 
range of 54 to 104 years, including 46% men and 
32% minority respondents. We defined CVD condi-
tions using responses to the question, “Has a doctor 
ever told you that you have/had [hypertension, an-
gina, heart attack, congestive heart failure, stroke, 
abnormal heart rhythm, or other heart problems]?” 
Thus, the estimates are based on self-reported preva-
lence of the conditions (questions are listed in Appen-
dix Table A1). We conducted the analyses by age, race/
ethnicity, and sex using age groups of 54 to 64, 65 
to 79, and ≥80 years. The racial/ethnic groups were 
white non-Hispanic, white Hispanic, black, and other 
race/ethnicity. The white Hispanic group included indi-
viduals of Hispanic origin who identified themselves to 
be of white race. We refer to this group as Hispanics. 
The black group included individuals of Hispanic and 
non-Hispanic origin. The race/ethnicity definitions are 
driven by data availability and are consistent with our 
previous report of projected CVD burden.1 We used 
sample weights provided by the HRS to produce na-
tionally representative estimates.
Prevalence of CVD
We estimated the prevalence of each CVD condition 
using logit regression models controlling for demo-
graphics (age, race/ethnicity, and sex), consistent with 
previous methodology for generating CVD prevalence 
estimates.1,32 We predicted prevalence of each condi-
tion in each age/race/ethnicity/sex cell for 2014 using 
coefficients from the logit regressions.
Hours of Informal Caregiving for Patients 
With CVD
We used an algorithm similar to the one reported by 
Joo et al18 to identify respondents who received infor-
mal caregiving and to quantify the weekly hours of in-
formal caregiving received. We used a series of ques-
tions to identify respondents who reported at least 1 
functional limitation in activities of daily living (ADLs) 
and in instrumental ADLs (IADLs) resulting from a physi-
cal, cognitive, or memory problem. The HRS includes 
6 items for ADLs—bathing, eating, dressing, walking 
across a room, using the toilet, and getting in or out 
of bed—and another 5 tasks for IADLs: preparing a hot 
meal, shopping for groceries, using a telephone, taking 
medication, and managing money.
For respondents who reported at least 1 limitation in 
ADLs or IADLs, we used the question “Does anyone ever 
help you with [ADL/IADL]?” to identify patients who re-
ported receiving help from a caregiver. For respondents 
who reported having caregivers, we used the questions 
on their relationship with each caregiver and payment 
status to further identify respondents who received care 
from informal caregivers. Specifically, we identified infor-
mal caregivers as caregivers who were family members or 
volunteers who were not paid for their caregiving.33,34
Next, for each informal caregiver, we calculated the 
weekly number of informal caregiving hours by multi-
plying the number of days per week by the number of 
hours per day of caregiving. We set the maximum num-
ber of daily hours of caregiving that 1 caregiver pro-
vided to 16 hours, assuming 8 hours of sleep.35–37 For 
respondents who reported multiple informal caregivers, 
we summed the weekly hours of caregiving across all 
informal caregivers per respondent.
We used a zero-inflated binomial model to estimate 
the weekly number of caregiving hours as a result of 
CVD as a function of each CVD condition, other costly 
and prevalent conditions (diabetes mellitus, cancer, ar-
thritis, depression, high cholesterol, lung disease, mental 
health, and Alzheimer disease), and sociodemographic 
variables (age, age squared, sex, race/ethnicity, educa-
tion, region of residence, marital status, and household 
income determined as total respondent and spouse 
earnings from all sources). For respondents with comor-
bid CVD conditions, we included a separate control for 
each condition. We then predicted the number of care-
giving hours attributable to each CVD condition by age/
sex/race/ethnicity.
Dollar Value of Informal Caregiving for 
Patients With CVD

ing using a replacement cost approach in which care-

performed. This approach assumes that if informal care-
givers were not available, a person would need to pay 
someone for these services.18,19,34 We used 2015 median 
wage data for home health aide workers and inflated 
it by 46% as recommended by Neumann et al38 to ac-
count for fringe benefits.38–40 We calculated the annual 
per-person cost of informal caregiving of CVD by age/
sex/race/ethnicity as a product of weekly hours of infor-
mal caregiving for an individual with CVD by age/sex/
race/ethnicity, median hourly wage of health aid work-
ers, and 52 weeks.
Projected Costs
We generated projections of costs of informal caregiv-
ing of CVD using an assumption that within each of the 
age/sex/racial/ethnic groups, the prevalence of the con-
dition and informal caregiving hours will remain con-
stant.1,32 Baseline average costs per person for each de-
mographic category are allowed to grow in real terms on 
the basis of the historical rate of growth of real wages. 
These projections reflect expected changes in popula-
tion demographics but assume no change in policy that 
would affect prevalence and relative cost within a de-
mographic category. We generated a projected number 
of people with each condition by age/sex/race/ethnicity 
in each year (2015–2035) by multiplying the baseline 
prevalence of each condition by age/sex/race/ethnicity 
by the 2010 census projections of population counts by 
age/sex/race/ethnicity for 2015 through 2035. We ob-
tained projected population counts for 2015 through 
2035 from the 2014 population projections of the US 
resident population by age, sex, race, and Hispanic ori-
gin generated by the US Census Bureau.41
We calculated projections of annual costs of infor-
mal caregiving of each CVD condition for the years 
2015 through 2035 by age/sex/race/ethnicity by multi-
plying the annual per-person cost of informal caregiv-
ing of CVD by age/sex/race/ethnicity by the number of 
people with each condition for years 2015 to 2035 by 
age/sex/race/ethnicity. We used assumptions from the 
Congressional Budget Office on the average annual 
growth rate of real earnings and applied an annual 
growth rate of 1.29% to the caregiving costs in each 
year through 2035.42 Finally, we aggregated annual 
costs across age/sex/racial/ethnic groups to calculate 
total projected costs of informal caregiving of CVD in 
each year (2015–2035).
RESULTS
The estimated weekly per-person hours of informal 
caregiving attributable to each CVD condition (hyper-
tension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, 
and other heart disease) and breakdown by sex, race/
ethnicity, and age group are presented in Table 1. 
Across conditions, the number of informal caregiving 
hours ranges from 0.10 h/wk for patients with coronary 
heart disease to 6.12 h/wk for patients with stroke. On 
average, white non-Hispanics with CVD receive fewer 
hours than other groups, and given the aging of the 
population, individuals ≥80 years of age receive more 
hours of caregiving than those <80 years of age.
Per person, the average annual cost of informal 
caregiving for a patient with CVD is the highest among 
blacks with an estimated cost of $1600/y in 2015 and 
increasing to $2300/y in 2035. The lowest average an-
nual cost is found among white non-Hispanics with 
$890/y in 2015 and increasing to $1300/y in 2035 
(Figure 1). Looking at condition-specific costs reveals 
that for hypertension, per-person costs are the high-
est among Hispanics with an estimated annual cost of 
$420 in 2015 and increasing to $550 in 2035 and the 
lowest among white non-Hispanics with an estimated 
cost of $220 in 2015 and increasing to $300 in 2035 
(Figure 2). At the person level, stroke is the most ex-
pensive CVD condition in terms of informal caregiving, 
with blacks incurring the highest informal caregiving 
cost of $7200 in 2015 and increasing to $10 000 in 
2035 (Figure 3).
Projected total annual informal caregiving costs at-
tributable to CVD are presented in Table 2. The costs 
of informal caregiving for patients with CVD were 
estimated at $61 billion in 2015 and are projected to 
more than double to $128 billion in 2035 (Table 2). To-
tal costs of informal caregiving for patients with stroke 
constitute more than half of the total costs of informal 
caregiving of patients with CVD ($31 billion in 2015 
and $66 billion in 2035). Although at the per-person 
level the informal caregiving provided to patients with 
hypertension appears minimal at 0.31 h/wk (Table 1), 
aggregated to the national level, the burden is signifi-
cant ($14 billion in 2015 and $29 billion in 2035; Ta-
ble 2) because of the high prevalence of hypertension. 
At the national level, the cost of informal caregiving 
provided to patients with CVD is the highest among 
white non-Hispanics with an estimate of $38 billion in 
2015 and increasing to $70 billion in 2035 (Figure 4). 
In 2015, CVD informal caregiving costs were highest 
among individuals 65 to 79 years of age ($24 billion); 
however, by 2035, they are expected to be surpassed 
by the costs among individuals ≥80 years of age ($53 
billion; Figure 5). By sex, total costs of informal caregiv-
ing are higher among women with CVD ($35 billion in 
2015 and $73 billion in 2035) than men ($26 billion in 
2015 and $55 billion in 2035; Figure 6).

total direct and indirect CVD costs from 2015 to 2035.

mal caregiving hours within each age/sex/racial/ethnic 
group remain constant and take into account expected 
changes in population demographics and real wage 
growth. The projected cost of informal caregiving at-
tributable to CVD is $61 billion in 2015 with a projected 
increase to $128 billion in 2035. At the per-person lev-
el, the burden of informal caregiving for CVD is greatest 
among blacks and individuals ≥80 years of age. Aggre-
gated to the national level, informal caregiving costs for 
those with CVD are the highest among white non-His-
panics and women. The burden of informal caregiving 
for patients with CVD is significant, and accounting for 
these costs increases total CVD costs by 11% to $616 
billion in 2015 and $1.2 trillion in 2035.

Costs of Informal Caregiving for CVD
Aside from this study and that reported by Joo and 
colleagues,18,19,43 costs of informal caregiving associated 
with CVD are not well documented. Our estimates of 
the per-person hours of informal caregiving attributable 
to heart failure and stroke are consistent with previous 
studies.18,19 For patients with heart failure, Joo et al18 
used methodology similar to that in the present study 
but used data from the 2010 HRS that included adults 
≥50 years of age; our analysis included adults ≥54 years 
of age. For patients with stroke, Joo et al19 focused on 
adults ≥65 years of age and used an approach that 
quantified hours of informal caregiving for patients 
with stroke in the past 2 years (rather than ever having 
a stroke as in the present analysis). Our estimates of to-
tal informal caregiving costs, however, are twice as high 
as the costs previously reported for patients with heart 
failure and stroke.18,19 The main reason for that differ-
ence is that, following recommendations by Neumann 
et al,38 we valued the hours of an informal caregiver 
using a wage of home health aide workers that was 
inflated to account for fringe benefits, whereas previ-
ous studies did not.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
As a result of chronic stress, caregivers themselves 
are faced with emotional and health impacts of care-
giving, loss of employment, and significant changes 
in their lives as a result of providing care.3,15,44,45 From 
a financial standpoint, caregivers often incur out-
of-pocket costs when they provide care (eg, paying 
for medical, household, or personal care items for 
the caregiving recipient).17 Life changes encompass 
changes in social functioning, subjective well-being, 
and health as a result of providing care.15,44 Caregiver 
health and well-being are important because of the 
impact that caregivers and patients have on each 
other within dyadic relationships.46,47 Several stud-
ies have shown that caregiver self-esteem, optimism, 
and anxiety are associated with outcomes for pa-
tients with CVD (eg, depressive symptoms, quality of 
life).46–48 Our analysis does not quantify emotional or 
health burden, job loss, life changes, healthcare use, 
or out-of-pocket costs incurred by informal caregiv-
ers. Frequently referred to as spillover effects,49 lim-
ited research exists on the economic spillover effects 
on CVD caregivers.
How Caregiving Costs Add to the Burden 
of Heart Disease and Stroke Through 
2035
The epidemiology of CVD has changed substantially 
over the past 2 decades.50 These profound changes are 
exemplified by a decline in the incidence of myocardial 
infarction,51,52 a preponderance of non–ST-segment–el-
evation myocardial infarctions, and a shift in the mix of 
heart failure cases with more patients presenting with 
preserved ejection fraction.53 The impact of this evolu-
tion is amplified by 2 key factors: incident manifesta-
tions of CVD occurring at older ages and the aging of 
the population, which leads to a larger pool of candi-
dates for CVD. As a consequence, CVD is now materi-
alizing within the complexities of old age, and cardiac 
care is increasingly entering the domain of geriatric 
care.54 Accordingly, caregiving needs are growing and 
are most often fulfilled by informal caregivers. Because 
CVD has increasingly become integrated with geriatric 
conditions and manifests more often alongside other 
diseases, the complexity of managing multiple chronic 
conditions increases the magnitude of the demands on 
caregivers.
Given the aging of the US population, caregiving re-
quirements are expected to markedly escalate by 2035. 
Because caregivers experience substantial stress and

personally endure large social, economic and health-
care costs, studying how caregiving costs augment the 
burden of heart disease and stroke is of direct and cen-
tral relevance to the assessment of the impact of CVD. 
However, the conceptual importance of measuring 
caregiving costs contrasts sharply with the scarcity of 
data on the topic and the lack of an agreed-on meth-
odological framework that would inform this matter 
with the necessary rigor and accuracy. A recent review 
outlined the limitations of existing studies, including 
reliance on different methods, numerous biases, and 
small sample size.43 Nevertheless, the estimated costs 
of informal care are high. As the need for method-
ological work is increasingly recognized, approaches 
to valuation of informal care are now being proposed, 
which will greatly contribute to addressing the rec-
ognized gaps in methodological knowledge and will 
therefore enhance the robustness of future analyses.55 
One example is the need for approaches for valua-
tion of informal care that quantify the spillover effects 
on caregivers, including the emotional, financial, and 
health burden.
Special Concerns for Patients With Stroke
Compared with other types of CVD, the higher costs 
of providing care for stroke survivors are not surprising 
($31 billion in 2015 and $66 billion in 2035). Stroke 
is a leading cause of disability, with 50% of survivors 
having hemiparesis, 46% with cognitive deficits, 19% 
with aphasia, and 35% experiencing depressive symp-
toms.56 Because of the suddenness of stroke, informal 
caregivers struggle with finding information about 
stroke, managing emotions and behaviors of the sur-
vivor, providing personal care, providing instrumental 
care, and dealing with their own emotions and life

changes.44,57 The most difficult aspect of providing 
care is managing emotions and behaviors of the survi-
vor, particularly depressive symptoms and personality 
changes as a result of the stroke.44,57 Informal care-
givers of survivors with aphasia, compared with those 
without, have reported more difficulty with provid-
ing care and worse life changes, with lack of time to 
spend with family and friends.58 With 50% of stroke 
survivors having hemiparesis and 30% being unable 
to walk without assistance, informal caregivers must 
suddenly learn how to assist with ADLs and mobility 
issues, with falls being a major concern. Financial is-
sues, transportation, and finding respite care are also 
central issues for stroke caregivers.44,57 The complexity 
of care and the impact of stroke on the lives of sur-
vivors and their informal caregivers make stroke very 
time-consuming and costly.
Special Considerations in Heart Failure
Although less costly than stroke, the burden of infor-
mal caregiving for patients with heart failure is also 
significant (around $7 billion in 2015 and $14 billion 
in 2035), as noted in Table 2. In heart failure, the chal-
lenges of aging and multimorbidity leading to com-
plex care needs are well known. Family caregivers of 
individuals with heart failure are engaged in providing 
direct care and assisting with self-care. They moni-
tor and support complex medical regimens, dietary 
restrictions, medications, symptom assessment/man-
agement, psychological health, and quality of life.13 
In addition to providing transportation to multiple ap-
pointments, they are confronted with the stresses and 
uncertainty associated with frequent hospital admis-
sions.15,45,59–63 Few effective interventions to support 
family caregivers of patients with heart failure have 
been reported.13
Cognitive impairment associated with heart fail-
ure is one of several issues that compound family 
caregivers’ responsibilities.64 Although not studied 
specifically in patients with heart failure, a study has 
shown that Alzheimer disease and related dementias 
increase costs through effects on the management 
of comorbid illnesses, which is of particular relevance 
for heart failure given its self-management require-
ments.65 It has been documented that increasing life 
expectancy leads to an increasing burden of comor-
bid conditions in aging populations, in particular CVD 
and dementia. These 2 diseases are likely to coexist, 
and there is substantial evidence that atherosclerosis 
and cognitive impairment share common risk factors 
and pathophysiology.66 This is particularly salient for 
heart failure because the prevalence of cognitive im-
pairment in heart failure is high, interfering with its 
management and imposing a particularly high burden 
on caregivers.
Special Concerns by Age, Sex, and Race/
Ethnicity
The results reveal significant disparities in the burden 
of CVD caregiving by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. As 
expected, CVD prevalence increases with age, and as 
noted above, the increasing aging population shifts 
costs of CVD to older ages.54 In 2015, 90% of people 
≥80 years of age were estimated to have at least 1 form 
of CVD.1 Informal caregiving costs of CVD were the 
highest among those 65 to 79 and >80 years of age, 
reflecting the increasing frailty and required assistance 
with ADLs and IADLs.
In 2014, the prevalence of hypertension, heart fail-
ure, stroke, and other heart conditions such as atrial 
fibrillation was higher among women than men.50 In 
this analysis, the increased projected caregiving costs 
for women likely reflect these trends and the increased 
age of women for CVD events.
Aggregated to the national level, the total caregiv-
ing costs are the highest among whites because they 
represent the largest racial/ethnic group. At the per-
person level, blacks bear the highest burden of care-
giving. The effect of race/ethnicity on the use of paid 
or informal caregivers for individuals with CVD has 
received little attention in the literature. The declines 
seen in CVD in recent years have been smaller among 
blacks than whites, accompanied by increased severity 
of CVD among blacks.67 The prevalence of hyperten-
sion, heart failure, and stroke is highest among blacks, 
with CVD initially occurring at younger ages and be-
ing more resistant to treatment.50,68,69 For example, 
47% of blacks were estimated to have hypertension 
in 2015 compared with 40% of white non-Hispanics, 
consequently increasing their risk for stroke and heart 
failure.1,70–72
Studies of traumatic spinal cord injury and other 
chronic conditions suggest that blacks were more likely 
to receive informal care from other family members, 
friends, church support, and others, whereas whites 
were more likely to receive informal or family care from 
spouses.73 Level of income was most directly related to 
the use of paid versus unpaid care. A study of 270 pa-
tients74 to determine indicators of 6-month healthcare 
use after hospitalization for ischemic stroke found that 
blacks had more home healthcare visits than whites. 
Thus, the underuse of health care after stroke was not 
associated with worse long-term stroke outcomes for 
blacks. Living with an available caregiver was associated 
with less postacute healthcare use, and coresiding care-
giver availability was reduced in women, black women 
in particular.74
We further assessed the issue of racial/ethnic differ-
ences in caregiving using the HRS data and found that 
blacks, regardless of CVD status, received more care-
giving than whites, including both paid and informal

caregiving. The portion of the paid caregiving hours at-
tributable to CVD was similar across blacks and whites, 
so we cannot conclude that blacks used more informal 
caregiving because they had less access to paid caregiv-
ing than whites. These estimates controlled for age and 
other sociodemographic characteristics, so it is likely 
that severity of disease contributed to the higher use 
of caregiving reported by black patients with CVD (and 
we were unable to control for it in our data). We also 
found that black patients with CVD were more likely to 
report ADL limitations (which is a qualifier for receiving 
caregiving in our analysis), with 34% of black patients 
with CVD versus 23% of white patients with CVD re-
porting at least 1 ADL limitation. This finding suggests 
that black patients with CVD may be in need of more 
caregiving hours (formal and informal) than white pa-
tients with CVD.
Caregiving Costs in Noncardiovascular 
Chronic Conditions
Caregiving costs have been studied to some extent in 
noncardiovascular conditions. A systematic review of 
the inclusion of informal care in the economic evalua-
tion of Alzheimer disease, colon cancer, Parkinson dis-
ease, and rheumatoid arthritis evaluated how often and 
how informal care was addressed in cost-effectiveness 
studies of these chronic diseases.75 Although in Al-
zheimer disease informal cost was included in 64% of 
economic evaluations, it was addressed in only 13% 
of the studies of Parkinson disease and 14% of the 
studies pertaining to rheumatoid arthritis and was not 
mentioned in studies focusing on metastatic colorec-
tal cancer. Furthermore, studies that reported informal 
care costs did not discuss their methodology. Because 
methods could conceptually differ across studies, the 
ability to compare across diseases is limited.
In oncology, reports on caregiving depict the 
breadth of caregiving activities and their far-reaching 
impact on families,76,77 yet studies directly addressing 
the related economic implications and costs have been 
infrequent.78 For diabetes mellitus, the estimated an-
nual costs of caregiving were reported to range from 
$1162 to $5082 per person.43 As expected, the caregiv-
ing needs of Alzheimer disease bring the highest cost 
compared with those of stroke, mental illness, cancer, 
and multiple sclerosis.55 However, detailed comparisons 
with other diseases that rely on consistent methodolo-
gy are lacking. Hence, it is challenging to examine how 
caregiving costs for other chronic diseases compare 
with costs for CVD.
Taken collectively, these observations identify a sig-
nificant gap in our knowledge about caregiving and 
thus a research opportunity of critical societal urgency. 
An agreed-on methodological framework is a requisite 
for the field to move forward and to conduct compari-
sons across diseases.
LIMITATIONS
This analysis is subject to several limitations. As with 
most surveys, the data and projections are subject to 
sampling error. However, the large number of partici-
pants and national representativeness of the sample 
mitigate these concerns. Although geographic variation 
has been studied extensively in patients with stroke,50 
region-level subgroup analyses were not conducted 
because of small subsample sizes. Studies have shown 
higher rates of stroke mortality for patients living in the 
stroke belt (ie, the southeastern United States), indicat-
ing geographic disparities.50 These disparities may also 
be evident in terms of resource use and the resultant 
need for more caregiving hours for patients who survive 
a severe stroke. Although other specific cardiovascular 
conditions with caregiving needs (eg, peripheral vascu-
lar disease, congenital heart disease) were not analyzed 
separately, they were likely captured in the “other heart 
diseases” category. Future work should attempt to ad-
dress these conditions more specifically.
This analysis did not capture informal caregivers who 
provide personal and other care for institutionalized pa-
tients with CVD. Although this type of caregiving was 
beyond the scope of this study, it is an important aspect 
to consider in future analyses.
This analysis includes adults ≥54 years of age; 
younger groups also may have caregiver needs. We pre-
viously estimated that the medical costs of CVD among 
those 18 to 44 years of age constituted <5% of medi-
cal costs among those ≥18 years of age ($15 billion of 
$318 billion).1 Thus, given the relatively low prevalence 
of CVD in this younger age group, we do not expect 
that excluding them from the analysis significantly un-
derestimated the total costs of informal caregiving for 
patients with CVD. Although costs for younger popula-
tions may be relatively low, they likely need care over a 
longer period of time, for the remainder of their lives 
for some patients. Stroke is also occurring at earlier 
ages in young adults79; thus, further consideration of 
these caregiving needs is warranted.
Some participants reported zero hours of receipt of 
informal caregiving. It is not clear whether that reflects 
low or zero need, that they did not have an informal 
caregiver available, or that they used a paid caregiver. In 
addition, we cannot always identify whether the infor-
mal caregiver was living in the same household. How-
ever, we do know that most of the informal caregiv-
ers were family members. Among those with at least 1 
CVD condition who received informal caregiving, 90% 
reported having a family member as at least 1 of the 
caregivers.

The number of caregiving hours was self-report-
ed by the recipients of care, potentially introducing 
bias because there could be reporting discrepancies 
if caregivers were the respondents.43 However, the 
estimates presented here are likely conservative be-
cause care recipients usually understate impairment 
or disability compared with assessments by caregiv-
ers.80–82 Furthermore, the self-reported data used in 
this analysis have also been previously used to esti-
mate informal costs of caregiving for patients with 
heart failure, stroke, dementia, depression, and dia-
betes mellitus.18,19,33,35,83
We did not examine the spillover effects on caregiv-
ers; it is well documented that prolonged and intense 
caregiving effort exerts a devastating toll on caregiver 
health manifested as burden, depression, reduced qual-
ity of life, and increased risk for CVD events and other 
chronic conditions14,15 compared with noncaregivers 
of the same age. The true economic burden of CVD 
caregiving may be greater in that caregivers who report 
higher levels of caregiving distress have greater con-
sumption of health services.84,85 We also did not capture 
productivity losses and out-of-pocket expenses incurred 
by the caregivers. Our analysis did not account for the 
state or county assistance that some informal caregivers 
may be receiving.
FUTURE RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES 
AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Research Opportunities
According to a recent review on costs associated with 
informal care for patients with CVD and diabetes mel-
litus, research is limited by recall bias, small samples, 
and differing methodology.43 Joo and colleagues43 
recommended that future studies standardize meth-
ods for estimating costs of informal caregiving by (1) 
estimating disease-attributable cost rather than over-
estimating from multiple diseases per patient, (2) col-
lecting patient-level data that include informal care-
giver burden, (3) assessing a set of help areas rather 
than relying on memory, and (4) conducting sensitivity 
analyses. Of particular importance is collecting accurate 
hours of informal care with proper ways to estimate 
costs.43 Integration of informal caregiving costs into 
economic evaluations of illnesses such as CVD will help 
to avoid underinvesting for intervention strategies for 
these conditions.43 For example, several studies have 
been designed and tested with informal caregivers of 
individuals with heart failure13,62–64,86–89 and stroke,90–92 
with some including cost analyses or estimated costs 
of intervention delivery.93,94 Scientific guidelines recom-
mend that informal caregivers be included in the care 
of individuals with CVD,86,90,95 yet implementation of 
evidence-based strategies to support informal caregiv-
ers remains a challenge in today’s healthcare system, 
primarily because of a lack of allocated resources within 
healthcare systems.
Although this analysis and policy discussion has 
centered on informal caregiving, it is important to ac-
knowledge that many patients with cardiovascular is-
sues also receive care from paid nonprovider caregivers 
in their home or nonacute setting in the form of home 
health aides, companions, and homemaker assistants. 
Limited information is available on the role that these 
paid caregivers play in the care of patients such as as-
sistance with ADLs or more extensive roles, including 
medication management, selection of meals and diet, 
communication with healthcare professionals, and 
symptom monitoring. The relationship and substitut-
ability among informal caregiving, formal caregiving 
provided at home or in a community, and institutional 
care have been studied extensively but with varying re-
sults. A consistent finding is the inverse relationship be-
tween informal care and institutionalized care. Receipt 
of informal care reduces the probability of or delays 
nursing home entry.96–98 However, the findings on the 
relationship between informal care and paid home care 
are mixed. Some researchers predict that informal care 
and paid home care are substitutes,98,99 whereas others 
find no significant effects.100 We explored controlling 
for the use of formal caregiving in our regression mod-
el but did not find that adding this variable changed 
our results. A greater understanding of the interaction 
between unpaid and paid caregiving and the type of 
care provided would help inform and possibly reduce 
variances in state Medicaid policies/reimbursement and 
variances in Medicaid plan coverage.
Policy Guidance
Caregiving has become a critical issue of public policy, 
requiring holistic health reform solutions that account 
for the specific needs of both patients and their infor-
mal caregivers as the unit of care within systems of care 
delivery. Elderly individuals are known to prefer to stay 
in their homes and communities rather than in a nurs-
ing home; they also prefer to receive care from a family 
member rather than from a home health aide.101 Thus, 
informal caregiving is an important component of im-
proved well-being of the aged individuals.
CVD is already our nation’s costliest disease, and the 
projected dramatic rise in CVD prevalence and costs be-
tween now and 20351 portends increased strain on the 
capacity of the health system and demands imposed on 
informal caregivers at the same time that the caregiv-
er pool is shrinking.12 These circumstances place CVD 
caregivers at risk for their own health deterioration and 
burnout from the prolonged distress, physical demands, 
and costs of caregiving,3,102 and as demonstrated in this 
analysis, our nation will bear the costs.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
We propose 4 strategic steps to prioritize family-
focused care alongside person-centered care at a level 
commensurate with caregivers’ critical contributions to 
quality care delivery:
1. Develop and deploy a national caregiving 
strategy. Implement the consensus recommenda-
tion of the NASEM caregiving expert committee 
calling for the departments of Health and Human 
Services, Labor, and Veterans Affairs to work with 
private-sector stakeholders in developing and 
executing a national caregiving strategic action 
plan to preserve caregiver health, well-being, and 
financial security. This plan would explicitly and 
systematically detail how to adapt aspects of the 
nation’s systems for health care, workplaces, and 
long-term services and supports to engage infor-
mal caregivers and to support their health, values, 
and social and economic well-being, as well as 
address the needs of the increasingly culturally 
and ethnically diverse caregiver population. The 
strategy should at a minimum accomplish the 
following:
• Develop, test, and implement effective mecha-
nisms within Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans 
Affairs to ensure that informal caregivers are 
routinely identified, assessed, and supported
• Direct the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services to develop, test, and implement pro-
vider payment reforms that motivate providers 
to engage caregivers in delivery processes
• Explore, evaluate, and adopt federal policies 
that provide economic support for working and 
nonworking caregivers to offset the costs of 
caregiving, lost wages, and other costs
• Evaluate the few existing state initiatives and 
experiences addressing caregiver needs through 
support programs to identify opportunities for 
implementing similar successful programs more 
broadly and across all states.12
The Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage 
Family Caregivers Act24 and other similar pieces of 
federal legislation provide helpful legislative vehicles 
for advancing these priorities.
2. Expand palliative care access. Implement the 
American Heart Association and American Stroke 
Association recommendations103 calling for pal-
liative care integration early in the disease trajec-
tory for advanced CVD and stroke by expanding 
palliative care access in all hospital and com-
munity-based settings. The palliative care needs 
of symptomatic patients with heart failure are 
comparable to those of patients with advanced 
cancer.104,105 These burdens also affect caregiver 
quality of life.13,27,87,102,106–108 However, patients and 
caregivers with heart failure access palliative ser-
vices far less often than patients with cancer.105,109 
Even in cases when patients with heart failure are 
referred for palliative care, consultations are initi-
ated only very late in the care trajectory.109
Although not synonymous, end-of-life care and pal-
liative care overlap in many ways. A recent study of 
older adults’ caregivers at the end of life examined 
900 
000 community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries 
who received support from 2.3 million caregivers.110 
Ninety percent were unpaid and provided almost 
twice as many hours of care per week as other care-
givers. However, older adults at the end of life were 
not significantly more likely than other older adults 
to receive caregiving funded by government, state, 
or private insurance, underscoring the need for both 
greater recognition and expanded access to support-
ive services.110
Palliative care focuses on maximizing quality of life 
for both the patient and caregiver at any age and 
any stage of serious illness, providing an extra layer 
of support in these circumstances.103 It uses a team-
based approach to relieve the pain, symptoms, and 
distress of a serious illness like CVD.111 By determin-
ing patient and caregiver goals of care through skilled 
communication, treating distressing symptoms while 
coordinating care, providing practical support for 
patients and caregivers, and mobilizing community 
support and resources to ensure a secure and safe 
living environment, palliative care teams help meet 
patient and caregiver needs so that they can avoid 
unwanted and expensive crisis care.112–114
Many large US hospitals now have palliative care 
services, but availability across settings is highly vari-
able by region and by state. Only a small fraction of 
the patients and families who could benefit receive 
it.115 Extending palliative care integration in the com-
munity and expanding primary palliative care core 
competencies across the workforce through com-
munication and symptom management skills train-
ing are vital steps to reliably meet the quality of life 
and support needs of patients and caregivers where 
they live.116–118 Advocating for enactment of legisla-
tion that expands palliative care awareness, access, 
training, and research is an important action that 
stakeholders can take to help increase palliative care 
availability and accessibility for patients with CVD 
and their caregivers.
3. Embed caregiver engagement and out-
comes in performance and payment reforms. 
Caregivers should be assessed for unmet needs 
throughout the course of CVD. Given the scope 
and complexity of their caregiving role, ensuring 
that they feel well prepared and supported in ful-
filling their responsibilities is essential. The prolifer-
ation of shared risk payment models encouraging 
shorter hospital stays and reduced readmission 
has increased health system, payer, and provider

reliance on informal and family caregivers as criti-
cal partners in the treatment and support of seri-
ously ill individuals. However, the availability and 
adequacy of caregiving are often assumed instead 
of assessed, discussed, or trained.12 Responding 
to this reality, pay-for-performance reforms 
through Medicare Access and CHIP (Children’s 
Health Insurance Program) Reauthorization Act 
implementation, advancement of various alterna-
tive payment models, and development of associ-
ated quality measures should specifically include 
accountability for engaging informal caregivers 
and assessing their specific needs across system, 
institutional, and provider performance metrics. 
Quality improvement initiatives should include 
clearly articulated performance standards that 
hold providers accountable for caregiver engage-
ment, training, and support by explicitly including 
caregiver-reported outcomes in quality measures. 
These could include caregiver satisfaction with 
provider encounters, adequacy of training and 
instructions provided, caregivers’ confidence and 
efficacy in performing required tasks, and the 
adequacy of support services provided.
4. Invest in caregiving research. The NASEM 
report consensus recommendations highlighted 
several priority research areas for investment, 
including funding for health services research to 
transform population health and care delivery 
focused on preserving caregiver well-being, qual-
ity of life, and workforce productivity.12 Specific 
to caregivers of patients with heart failure or 
other CVD, research priority is also strongly war-
ranted for intervention development and testing 
to enhance caregiver support and education.12,87 
The national strategy development recommended 
above should include expert consideration and 
identification of additional caregiving research 
priority areas.
Focused efforts to address the above 4 priorities 
will enable the United States to address the rising 
costs of informal caregiving while also offering need-
ed caregiver education and support. The outcomes 
will be improved quality of life for patients with CVD 
and family caregivers and improved productivity of the 
workforce.
Although different payer systems must be con-
sidered, established national or provincial caregiver 
strategies from several other countries might provide 
important insights for approaches to be considered or 
adapted for the United States. Notable examples of the 
components of these strategies include government-
funded community support groups (Australia); respite 
and age-appropriate resources for informal caregivers 
(Australia); financial support to pay for care after an as-
sessment of needs (United Kingdom); flexible work ar-
rangements for informal caregivers such as compressed 
work weeks, flex time, and work from home (New 
Zealand); and income replacement for family caregiv-
ers comparable to the provisions for care personnel in 
the formal caregiving sector (Sweden, United Kingdom, 
Canada).119
CONCLUSIONS
Combining our estimates of informal caregiving costs 
($61 billion in 2015) with the medical and indirect cost 
of CVD burden analysis ($555 billion in 2015) adds 
11% to the projected costs of heart disease and stroke 
(totaling more than $616 billion in 2015). According 
to CVD prevalence projections, 45% of the US popu-
lation will have CVD in 2035; thus, the escalation of 
caregiving needs must be considered in planning. At-
tention to the need for family-focused approaches and 
the development of sound caregiver policy are critical 
to ultimately reduce the burden of CVD. Collaboration 
among professional organizations, patient and family 
advocacy groups, and policy makers could have a pro-
found effect on changing this concerning landscape.
