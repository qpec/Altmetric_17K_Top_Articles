Objective: Exercise and diet impact body composition, but their age-related brain effects
are unclear at the molecular imaging level. To address these issues, the authors de-
termined whether body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and diet relate to brain
positron emission tomography (PET) of amyloid plaques and tau tangles using 2-(1-
(6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl)ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP).
Methods: Volunteers (N = 44; mean age: 62.6 ± 10.7 years) with subjective memory
impairment (N = 24) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N = 20) were recruited by
soliciting for memory complaints. Levels of physical activity and extent of following
a Mediterranean-type diet were self-reported. FDDNP-PET scans assessed plaque/
tangle binding in Alzheimer disease–associated regions (frontal, parietal, medial and
lateral temporal, posterior cingulate).Mixed models controlling for known covariates
examined BMI, physical activity, and diet in relation to FDDNP-PET. Results: MCI sub-
jects with above normal BMI (>25) had higher FDDNP-PET binding compared with
those with normal BMI (1.11(0.03) versus 1.08(0.03), ES = 1.04, t(35) = 3.3, p = 0.002).
Greater physical activity was associated with lower FDDNP-PET binding in MCI sub-
jects (1.07(0.03) versus 1.11(0.03), ES = 1.13, t(35) = −3.1, p = 0.004) but not in subjects
with subjective memory impairment (1.07(0.03) versus 1.07(0.03), ES = 0.02, t(35) = −0.1,
p = 0.9). Healthier diet related to lower FDDNP-PET binding, regardless of cognitive
status (1.07(0.03) versus 1.09(0.02), ES = 0.72, t(35) = −2.1, p = 0.04). Conclusion:
These preliminary findings are consistent with a relationship between risk modifiers

INTRODUCTION
The Alzheimer’s Association estimates that 5.2 million
Americans currently suffer from Alzheimer disease
(AD) and related dementias at a total healthcare cost
of over $200 billion per year.1 By 2050, AD cases in the
United States are expected to rise to 13.8 million at an
annual cost of $1.2 trillion (in 2014 dollars). Previous
estimates indicate that up to half of AD cases are at-
tributable to modifiable dementia risk factors (low
educational achievement, smoking, physical inactivi-
ty, depression, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity) and
that a 10%–25% reduction of these risks could poten-
tially prevent nearly 500,000 cases in the United States
and 1–3 million cases worldwide.2 To support efforts
of such modifiable risk factor reduction, there is a
growing interest in establishing the extent to which life-
style factors impact AD pathology in predementia
states.3,4
Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that
physical activity improves brain health through modi-
fications in brain structure and function. When
laboratory animals exercise regularly, they acquire new
neurons in the hippocampus, which then form func-
tional connections with other brain cells.5 Physical
activity may also increase cerebral blood flow, which
in turn promotes nerve cell growth and expression of
the plasticity molecule brain-derived neurotrophic
factor.6 Neuropsychological examinations of healthy
adults ages 60–75 found that involvement in an aerobic
exercise program improved performance on mental
tasks involved in frontal lobe function (monitoring,
scheduling, planning, inhibition, and memory) when
compared with a control group.7 Aerobic exercise and
regular physical activity have also more recently been
shown to increase total hippocampal volume and relate
to superior spatial memory in older adults.8,9
Similar to exercise, the contribution of a healthy diet
relating to normal body mass index (BMI) over time
is well established. Moreover, healthy diet and lower
dementia risk has been documented in prior work, al-
though not specifically with positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging of AD neuropathology. For
example, adherence to a Mediterranean-type diet
reduced cognitive decline, especially with exercise, in
several large cohort studies.10,11 In these studies, a
Mediterranean-type diet in U.S. populations has been
defined as containing higher than average amounts of
beneficial dietary components (fruits, vegetables,
legumes, cereals, and fish), lower than average detri-
mental components (meat and dairy), a ratio of
monounsaturated fats to saturated fats above the
median, and mild to moderate alcohol consumption
(>0 to <30 g/day). Previous work suggests that spe-
cific components of a Mediterranean-type diet that add
to reduced risk for AD include the antioxidant and/
or anti-inflammatory actions of monounsaturated fatty
acids, olive oil, red wine, and fish.12
In middle-aged and older adults, obesity has been
associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline
and conversion to dementia.13–16 BMI, a measure of
human body shape based on an individual’s weight
and height (kg/m2), is thought to reflect how much
an individual’s body weight departs from what is
normal for a particular height. BMI is used in a wide
variety of contexts as a simple method to assess body
composition and adiposity and as a proxy for health-
related behaviors such as physical exercise and diet.17
Although not all experts agree, the most widely
adopted upper limit of normal for BMI is 25.18
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies relat-
ing BMI to brain structure have found that obesity is
linked to lower brain volume in subjects diagnosed
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.19
Similar results have been found for cognitively normal
older adults who demonstrate selective patterns of gray
and white matter atrophy that include memory-
relevant areas (e.g., frontal and temporal lobes).20 An
arterial spin labeling technique established that in-

 creased BMI selectively relates to decreased cerebral
blood flow in frontal but not parietal or global gray
matter of older adults.21
Data relating BMI to AD neuropathology are limited.
A small neuropathology report that focused on obese,
cognitively intact, older adults demonstrated signifi-
cant increases in brain deposition of β-amyloid plaques
and tau-neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy.22 By con-
trast, in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) using
the amyloid plaque PET-ligand Pittsburgh Com-
pound B (PiB) found an inverse relationship with
higher BMI associated with lower PiB-PET signal in
both demented and nondemented subjects.23,24 To date,
no PET data relate tau tangles to BMI in nondemented
adult subjects with memory loss.
Here, we examine how BMI, level of physical ac-
tivity, and degree of following a healthy Mediterranean-
type diet are associated with a PET ligand that binds
to and provides a measure of both amyloid and tau,
namely 2-(1-(6-[(2-[F–18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]–
2-naphthyl)ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP). Global
and regional (e.g., frontal, temporal, parietal) FDDNP-
PET binding levels have previously been shown to
correlate with mood and cognitive function in older
adults25–27 and to predict cognitive decline.28 FDDNP-
PET binding, however, has not been analyzed in
relation to these modifiable risk factors. In the present
study, our objective was to assess the extent to which
BMI,
physical
activity,
and
adherence
to
a
Mediterranean-type diet relate to combined levels of
plaques and tangles as measured by FDDNP-PET in
a sample of community-dwelling, nondemented,
middle-aged and older adults with memory complaints.
METHODS
Participants
A total of 44 nondemented subjects (mean age:
62.6 ± 10.7 years; range: 40–85 years) underwent
FDDNP-PET scans, neuropsychological testing, and
BMI assessment and were drawn from a larger, lon-
gitudinal study of predictors of cognitive decline
described elsewhere in detail.27,29 Briefly, volunteers
were recruited through advertisements, media cover-
age, and referrals from physicians and families. Subjects
received neurologic and psychiatric evaluations, routine
screening laboratory tests for reversible causes of
memory loss (e.g., thyroid-stimulating hormone,
vitamin B12 level), and three-dimensional MRI or com-
puted tomography to rule out other causes of cognitive
impairment (e.g., tumor or stroke) or potential cogni-
tive confounding factors (e.g., severe sensory deficits
or medication interactions). Subjects with reversible
causes of memory loss and/or evidence of stroke on
MRI or computed tomography were excluded from the
study. All subjects were proficient in English and un-
derwent comprehensive clinical and cognitive
assessment to characterize cognitive status. All clini-
cal assessments were performed blinded to the results
of FDDNP-PET scans. Written informed consent was
obtained in accordance with the approved Universi-
ty of California, Los Angeles institutional review board
protocol. Cumulative radiation dosimeter levels for all
scans were below the mandated maximum annual dose
and in compliance with state and federal regulations.
Clinical and Neuropsychological Assessment
The clinical examination for volunteers included a
psychiatric and medical history, physical exam (in-
cluding measurement of BMI), mental status exam, and
comprehensive neuropsychological testing. The neu-
ropsychological test battery was administered to
quantify cognitive performance and to confirm the di-
agnostic category of each study subject: subjective
memory impairment, MCI, or dementia. Subjects were
categorized as having subjective memory impair-
ment if they had subjective memory complaints but
neither objective deficits on neuropsychological test
measures after correction for age and education nor
functional deficits in daily functioning. We used the
following diagnostic criteria for MCI: (1) patient aware-
ness of a memory problem, preferably confirmed by
another person such as a family member; (2) cogni-
tive impairment detected with standardized assessment
tests; and (3) ability to perform normal daily activities.30
To increase specificity for detecting impairment, we in-
cluded subjects who scored less than 1 standard
deviation below the mean on at least two tests and
whose diagnosis was corroborated by clinical
assessment.31 Because the current study focused only
on nondemented persons, subjects with deficits on neu-
ropsychological testing and functional deficits meeting
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,

excluded from the analysis. The Hamilton Rating Scales

 for both depression and anxiety were administered to
assess mood and anxiety, respectively. Subjects meeting
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition, Text Revision, criteria for depression or
anxiety disorders were excluded.
Physical Activity, Mediterranean-Type Diet, and
BMI Assessments
Level of physical activity was determined using the
International Physical Activity Questionnaire modi-
fied for older adults, and subjects were dichotomized
into either “higher” or “lower” activity groups using
a standard metabolic equivalent cut-off of 600 meta-
bolic
equivalent-min/wk.32,33
Adherence
to
a
Mediterranean-type diet was assessed using a previ-
ously validated single-item response method.34 Using
a five-point Likert scale (never, not often, some-
times, often, all the time), subjects reported the extent
to which they follow a healthy Mediterranean-type diet
(e.g., a diet with rich in fruits and vegetables, fish or
shellfish twice weekly, olive oil, and moderate amounts
of red wine). Subjects were dichotomized into adher-
ence groups of either “rarely” (never, not often,
sometimes) or “often” (often, all the time); further
subgrouping of Mediterranean-type diet adherence was
not attempted because of the relatively small study
sample size. BMI greater than 25 was used as an in-
dication of being overweight or obese. Of the 44
individuals in the study, 24 subjects had BMIs within
a normal range (mean BMI: 22.4; standard deviation:
2.0), and 20 subjects had above normal BMI (mean BMI;
29.7; standard deviation: 4.4). Of the 20 individuals with
an above-normal BMI, 5 had BMIs greater than 30 (the
most commonly used cut-off for obesity); hence, we
did not consider obese subjects separately from over-
weight subjects.
Imaging
Imaging AD neuropathology with FDDNP-PET
imaging is fully described in prior work.35 Briefly,
FDDNP was prepared at very high specific activities
(>37 GBq/mol). All scans were performed with the
ECAT HR or EXACT HR+ tomograph (Siemens-CTI,
Knoxville, TN) with subjects in the supine position and
the imaging plane parallel to the orbitomeatal line. A
bolus of FDDNP (320–550 MBq) was administered in-
travenously, and consecutive dynamic PET scans were
performed for 2 hours. Scans were decay corrected and
reconstructed using filtered back-projection (Hann filter,
5.5 mm FWHM) with scatter and measured attenua-
tion correction. The resulting images contained 47
contiguous slices with plane separation of 3.37 mm
(ECAT HR) or 63 contiguous slices with plane sepa-
ration of 2.42 mm (EXACT HR+).
To quantify FDDNP binding, Logan graphic anal-
ysis was performed with the cerebellum as the
reference region for time points between 30 and 125
minutes.36 The slope of the linear portion of the Logan
plot is the relative distribution volume, which is equal
to the distribution volume of the tracer in a region of
interest divided by that in the reference region. Rel-
ative distribution volume parametric images were
generated and analyzed using region of interests drawn
manually on the co-registered MRI scans or on an
image obtained in the first 5 minutes after injection
(perfusion image), bilaterally on parietal, medial tem-
poral (limbic regions, including hippocampus,
parahippocampal areas, and entorhinal cortex), lateral
temporal, posterior cingulate, parietal, and frontal
regions. Each regional relative distribution volume or
binding value was expressed as an average of left and
right regions. Rules for region of interest drawing were
based on the standard identification of gyral and sulcal
landmarks with respect to the atlas of Talairach and
Tournoux. The atlas provided a visual guide and ref-
erence for identifying the important landmarks needed
in delineating the region of interest. Region of inter-
est determinations were performed by individuals
blinded to the clinical assessments.
Anatomic brain MRI scans were obtained using a
3-Tesla magnet (General Electric-Signa, Milwaukee, WI)
scanner. Fifty-four transverse planes were collected
throughout the brain, superior to the cerebellum, using
a double-echo, fast-spin echo series with a 24-cm field
of view and 256 × 256 matrix with 3 mm/0 gap
(TR = 6,000 [3T] and 2,000 [1.5T]; TE = 17/85 [3T] and
30/90 [1.5T]). MRI scans were co-registered to PET scans
for the following brain regions: medial and lateral tem-
poral, posterior cingulate, parietal, and frontal regions.
Data Analysis
Data were initially screened for outliers and nor-
mality assumptions. Demographic and clinical
characteristics were compared between the two cog-
nitive groups (subjective memory impairment versus

 MCI) using t tests and χ2 statistics. Imaging charac-
teristics were compared between subjective memory
impairment and MCI groups using a mixed model
using regional FDDNP-PET binding levels as depen-
dent variables, region as the within-subject factor, and
cognitive group as the independent variable. We also
examined all pair-wise associations between BMI, phys-
ical activity, and diet groups using χ2 tests and found
that none of these was significant (BMI-physical ac-
tivity groups: χ2(1) = 0.43, p = 0.51; BMI-diet groups:
χ2(1) = 0.51, p = 0.47; physical activity-diet groups:
χ2(1) = 0.0, p = 0.95). In addition, we compared the con-
tinuous BMI values for the two physical activity groups
(higher: 25.7(3.6) versus lower: 25.9(5.5); t(42) = 0.14,
p = 0.9) as well as the two Mediterranean-type diet
groups (often: 25.4(5.7) versus rarely: 26.2(3.7);
t(42) = 0.53, p = 0.6). Thus, BMI, physical activity, and
diet groups were not confounded with each other in
this sample of subjects.
Mixed models were then estimated to determine
whether BMI (normal versus above normal BMI), phys-
ical activity (lower versus higher), and adherence to
Mediterranean-type diet (rarely versus often) were
related to FDDNP-PET binding levels and whether the
associations differed for the two cognitive groups (sub-
jective memory impairment versus MCI). Regional
FDDNP-PET binding values were used as depen-
dent variables with region as the within-subject factor;
BMI, physical activity, and diet groups were used as
independent (between-subject) variables. Interaction
terms of cognitive group with each of the above in-
dependent variables were also included in the model
and retained in the final model if significant. The effects
of age, sex, educational level, and E4 status (E4 carrier
or not) were all initially included as covariates, but only
age was retained in the final model because the other
variables were not statistically significant. We also ex-
plored including the interaction terms of age by BMI
group and region by BMI group in the mixed-model
estimations. A significance level of 0.05 was used for
all inferences. In addition to the standard statistics,
effect size (ES) estimates (Cohen’s d for group differ-
ences and correlation coefficients) are also presented.
RESULTS
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the two
cognitive groups indicated that the subjective memory
impairment and MCI groups did not differ in any vari-
ables except the Mini-Mental State Exam score
(t(42) = −2.7, p = 0.01; Table 1). BMI, physical activity,
and Mediterranean-type diet measures, as well as the
regional FDDNP-PET binding levels for the two cog-
nitive groups, are shown in Table 2. The BMI, physical
activity, and Mediterranean-type diet measures were
comparable between the subjective memory impair-
ment and MCI groups, but the regional brain FDDNP-
PET binding levels for MCI subjects were significantly
higher than those for the subjective memory impair-

 ment group (F(1,42) = 5.73, p = 0.02), consistent with
our previous results (Table 2).29
The initial model included the independent vari-
ables of BMI group (“normal BMI” versus “above
normal BMI”), physical activity (“higher” versus
“lower”), diet (current level of adherence to a
Mediterranean-type diet, grouped as “often” versus
“rarely”), cognitive status (subjective memory impair-
ment versus MCI), and the interaction terms of each
of the first three measures with cognitive status. Only
the interaction terms of BMI and physical activity with
cognitive status were statistically significant. Conse-
quently, the interaction term of Mediterranean-type diet
and cognitive status (F(1,34) = 0.1, p = 0.7) was ex-
cluded. The final model thus included, in addition to
age and cognitive status, BMI group, physical activi-
ty group, Mediterranean-type diet group (F(1,35) = 4.6,
p = 0.04), and the interaction of BMI and physical ac-
tivity with cognitive status (BMI interaction:
F(1,35) = 5.6, p = 0.02; physical activity interaction:
F(1,35) = 5.7, p = 0.02).
Degree of Mediterranean-type diet adherence was

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge this is the first report to deter-
mine the relationship of BMI, physical activity, and diet
to in vivo brain plaque and tangle levels as mea-
sured by FDDNP-PET in nondemented middle-aged
older adults. We found moderate but significant as-
sociations between these three factors and FDDNP-
PET binding levels. MCI volunteers who engaged in
more physical activity and were of normal BMI had
lower FDDNP binding levels than MCI subjects who
reported being less active and who had above normal
BMI. Adherence to a healthy diet was associated with
lower FDDNP-PET binding levels across all partici-
pants. These findings are consistent with those derived
from other imaging and nonimaging studies finding
that lifestyle behaviors affecting BMI influence AD and
related dementia risk and multifactorial health strat-
egies might delay onset of AD symptoms. Successful
medical and lifestyle-based efforts to treat over-
weight and obese individuals to normalize body
composition could result in lower levels of AD neu-
ropathology in predementia states, thus decreasing risk
of developing subsequent dementia.
Our finding that higher BMI values were associ-
ated with high FDDNP binding values is consistent
with other studies indicating a link between being over-
weight or obese and neurodegeneration. Prior work
from the Cardiovascular Health Study and the Al-
zheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative indicates
that being overweight or obese is an independent pre-
dictor of brain atrophy.19,20 Both being overweight and
obesity at midlife independently increase risk for de-
mentia, AD, and vascular dementia,16 and a higher BMI
in mid-life has been shown to be associated with greater
cognitive decline after 5 years.37 Our finding of in-
creased AD neuropathology with higher BMI in
predementia states is in agreement with the limited
available neuropathology data.22
Lifestyle strategies to normalize BMI over time have
been shown to impact memory and brain health. Phys-
ical exercise is a well-established component of lifestyle
programs geared toward normalizing BMI, and mul-
tiple studies have demonstrated the potential brain
effects of normalizing body composition via increased
physical activity. In a seminal work, neuropsychologi-
cal examinations of healthy adults ages 60–75 found
that involvement in an aerobic exercise program im-
proved performance on mental tasks involved in frontal
lobe function (monitoring, scheduling, planning, in-
hibition, and memory) when compared with a control
group.7 Aerobic fitness also predicts hippocampal
volume with aging,8 and increased exercise can reverse
volume loss and improve memory.9
Advantages of this study include application of an
AD neuropathology specific imaging tracer to a well-
characterized cohort with BMI, physical activity, and
dietary measures to assess health-related lifestyle habits.
The modeling of interactions and inclusion of covariates
further ensured the statistical rigor needed to draw the
observed association between lifestyle factors and
plaque and tangle binding levels.
However, this preliminary study has several limi-
tations. Although we found the predicted, statistically
significant associations between modifiable risk factors
and brain amyloid and tau binding levels, the mag-
nitude of these differences was modest. Several factors
could have contributed to these modest findings. First,
this study included a small sample size of subjects with
relatively mild cognitive symptoms. A larger sample
with older (age > 65) cognitively normal subjects and
more advanced cognitive symptoms might have
yielded more robust group differences. Second, our
weight-related results are based on BMI. Some indi-
viduals with greater than average lean body mass but
normal adiposity levels can have a high BMI despite
being at a healthy weight. Others may have a normal
BMI despite having greater than average body fat from
central obesity.38 Despite such exceptions, BMI has been
widely used as a measure associated with overweight
and obesity, including investigations of nondemented
middle-aged and older adults, particularly in the epi-
demiologic literature, and has been shown to be a
consistent predictor of obesity-related medical
conditions.39 Third, diet and physical activity assess-

 ments were based on self-reports. Although this
approach is commonly used in multiple studies of
nondemented middle-aged and older adults, partic-
ularly in the epidemiologic literature, future work may
benefit from relating more objective physiologic mea-
sures such as waist circumference and those derived
from tests of maximal aerobic capacity, accelerometer
data, or structured longitudinal dietary assessment.
Also, it should be noted that although we demon-
strate statistically significant associations, our data do
not prove causal relationships between body compo-
sition and AD neuropathology measured with
molecular imaging.
Taken together with prior literature, these findings
are consistent with the hypothesis that some modifi-
able risk factors are associated with in vivo brain
measures of amyloid and tau. Given that body com-
position and lifestyle factors are interrelated, increased
adherence to one factor may promote adoption
of additional healthy lifestyle activities. A large rep-
resentative survey of 18,552 respondents across the
United States suggested that engaging in more than
one healthy lifestyle behavior reduced the likelihood
of experiencing memory difficulties in a dose-
dependent manner: The greater number of healthy
behaviors reported, the less likely respondents were
to report memory problems.40 Such results suggest that
summation of effects from multiple lifestyle factors may
promote a lower risk for AD than application of any
one factor alone. Future work should integrate such
information into an overall clinical and lifestyle strat-
egy to reduce risk for and potentially delay the onset
of AD symptoms.
