Objective: The aim of this study was to examine cross-sectional associations between objectively mea-
sured sedentary time and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-assessed adiposity in a population at high
risk for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and to determine whether associations are modified by the recommended
levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).
Methods: Sedentary time and MVPA were measured objectively by using accelerometers. Linear regression
models examined the association of sedentary time with liver, visceral, subcutaneous, and total abdominal
fat (quantified by using MRI). Interaction terms determined whether results were consistent across activity
categories (active [> 150 min/wk of MVPA] vs. inactive [< 150 min/wk of MVPA]).
Results: One hundred and twenty-four participants (age 5 64.0 6 7.1 years; male 5 65.3%; BMI 5 31.8 6
5.6 kg/m2) were included. Following adjustment, each 60 minutes of sedentary time was associated with
1.74 L higher total abdominal fat, 0.62 L higher visceral fat, 1.14 L higher subcutaneous fat, and 1.86%
higher liver fat. When results were stratified by MVPA (active vs. inactive), sedentary time was associated
with greater liver, visceral, and total abdominal fat in the inactive group only.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that sedentary time is associated with higher levels of inter- and
intraorgan fat, but associations with liver, visceral, and total abdominal fat were stronger in those who do
not reach the current exercise recommendations for health.

Introduction
It has been well documented that obesity and physical inactivity predis-
pose individuals to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (1,2).
More specifically, evidence suggests that the distribution of excess fat is
an important determinant of metabolic, cardiovascular, and mortality risk
with a predominance of android rather than gynoid being a key contribu-
tor (3-5). In particular, ectopic fat, defined as the deposition of triglycer-
ides within locations not classically associated with adipose storage, par-
ticularly within the intra- and interabdominal organs, appears to confer a
higher metabolic risk than total abdominal fat per se (6,7).
Physical activity is known to be one of the cornerstone interventions for
the prevention of T2DM, with individuals who regularly engage in the
recommended
levels
of
moderate-to-vigorous
physical
activity
(MVPA), typically 150 min/wk, manifesting a myriad of physiological
benefits (including reduced visceral fat) and a reduced risk of chronic
disease and premature mortality (8,9). Conversely, sedentary time
(defined as any sitting/reclining activity with a low energy expenditure
(10)) has been shown to be detrimentally associated with homeostatic
model assessment of insulin resistance, insulin, insulin sensitivity,
T2DM, and mortality (2,11-13). The evidence appears particularly com-
pelling for those at high risk of, or diagnosed with, T2DM. Objectively
measured sedentary behavior quantified by using an accelerometer is
strongly
associated
with
markers
of insulin
resistance
(14-16),
interleukin-6 (17), and markers of regional adiposity, assessed by mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) (18). Importantly, the majority of these

 observations persist after further adjustment for body mass index (BMI)
or total fat mass and MVPA (15,17,18).
Despite these findings, there is emerging evidence that levels of fit-
ness or physical activity may modify the association between seden-
tary time and health, with stronger associations seen in those who are
inactive or unfit (15,17,19,20). Others have also demonstrated that in
comparison to adults who are physically inactive with high sedentary
time, those who are physically active have a more desirable health
profile across multiple cardiometabolic markers (BMI, A1c, and high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol) (19). In addition, cross-sectional anal-
yses in individuals at high risk of T2DM have demonstrated that after
stratifying by MVPA, the detrimental effects of sedentary time on
interleukin-6 are stronger in those who were classed as inactive (17).
More recently, a harmonized meta-analysis also found that high levels
of moderate physical activity (60-75 min/d) largely negated the
increased risk of mortality associated with high sitting time (12).
Taken together, these studies have begun to suggest that the effects of
sedentary time may be more relevant in those individuals who do not
engage in sufficient levels of MVPA. However, these findings have yet
to be explored beyond traditional markers of adiposity (BMI and waist
circumference). The way in which sedentary time is accumulated may
also influence health outcomes. For example, sedentary time that occurs
in long periods without interruption may be more detrimental to health
than shorter bouts (21). Moreover, previous research has shown that
breaks in sedentary time are strongly associated with traditional measures
of adiposity (14). Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the
associations between objectively measured sedentary time (total and pro-
longed bouts), breaks in sedentary time, and MRI-assessed body compo-
sition in a population at high risk of T2DM and to determine whether
associations are mediated by the recommended levels of MVPA.
Methods
Subjects
This was a nested study within a randomized controlled trial for a subset of
participants. Individuals were recruited from the Walking Away from
Type 2 Diabetes trial, reported in detail previously (22,23). Participants at
an increased risk of T2DM were recruited through 10 primary care prac-
tices in Leicestershire, United Kingdom, from 2010 to 2011. Individuals
with an increased risk of impaired glucose regulation (any combination of
impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glycemia or undiag-
nosed T2DM) were identified by using a modified version of the Leicester
Risk Score (24). Individuals were unaware of their diabetes risk status
before entering the study. At baseline, individuals were randomized to
usual care or the Walking Away structured education program (23). There
was no difference between groups in levels of MVPA, sedentary behavior,
or markers of metabolic health at 12 months (22). Therefore, this paper
reports cross-sectional data at 12 months from a sample of 124 participants
collected during 2011. Ethical approval was obtained from the Nottingham
Research Ethics Committee in the United Kingdom. Informed consent was
obtained from all individual participants included in the study.
Quantification of sedentary time (total and bouts),
breaks in sedentary time, and MVPA
All eligible participants were asked to wear an accelerometer at their
12-month visit (ActiGraph GT3X; ActiGraph, LLC, Pensacola, Florida)
for seven consecutive days during waking hours. Data were collected in
15-second epochs and reintegrated into 60-second epochs for the pur-
poses of this study. Freedson cut points were used to categorize an
epoch as sedentary (< 100 counts per 60 seconds) or MVPA (� 1,952
counts per 60 seconds) (25). Breaks in sedentary time were defined as a
transition from a sedentary (< 100 counts per 60 seconds) to an active
state (� 100 counts per 60 seconds). Bouts of sedentary behavior were
categorized into time periods of either 0 to 30 minutes, 30 to 60 minutes,
or 60 1 minutes. Nonwear time was defined as a minimum of 60
minutes of continuous zero counts, and days with at least 600 minutes
of wear time were considered valid (26). In order to be included in the
analysis, participants were required to have a minimum of four valid
days (27). In order for individuals to be classed as active, they needed to
have undertaken an average of at least 150 minutes of MVPA (28).
A data analysis tool (KineSoft version 3.3.76; KineSoft, Loughbor-
ough, UK) was used to process the accelerometer data.
MRI-derived measures of adiposity
At the 12-month follow-up measurement, participants were invited to
undergo an MRI scan in addition to their other study assessments.
MRI scans were performed at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, United
Kingdom, where liver, visceral, subcutaneous, and total abdominal fat
(includes liver, subcutaneous and visceral fat) was quantified. MRI is
a reliable modality for the assessment of adipose tissue and is capable
of measuring fat distribution with a high spatial resolution (29,30).
Scanning was performed using a 1.5 Tesla Avanto system (Siemens Med-
ical, Erlangen, Germany). Flexible body array coils were applied to the
thorax and abdomen for signal reception. For lipid volume quantification,
a 2-point Dixon gradient-echo pulse sequence was used to separate tissue
water signal from lipid signal. With this technique, two images are
acquired: in the first, the fat and water signals are aligned in-phase; in the
second, the fat and water signals have opposed phase directions. After the
correction of phase distortions because of magnetic field inhomogeneity,
the algebraic addition of the two images produces an image containing
the signal largely from water, while subtraction produces an image-
containing the signal largely from fat (31). Three-dimensional images
were acquired axially with 5-mm slice thickness and in-plane resolution
of 1.56 mm, interpolated to 0.78 mm. The field of view was 500 mm (left
to right) by 375 mm (anterior to posterior). Images were acquired in three
contiguous blocks, covering the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic regions,
with each block acquired in a breath-hold at full inspiration to minimize
motion-related artifacts and to negate changes in slice position. The acqui-
sition time for each block was 18 seconds. All scans were performed by
the same team of trained staff according to standardized procedures.
The analysis of the MRI images was performed by a trained individ-
ual using Java Image Manipulation analysis software (version 7;
Xinapse Systems, West Bergholt, UK). All analysis was undertaken
by the same researcher who was blinded to the clinical, anthropo-
metric, and accelerometer data.
For analysis, the “fat” and “water” images were algebraically com-
bined to create a “fat percentage” image. Fat-containing voxels were
then defined as those with an intensity between 51% and 99%
(100% being due to image artifact). In order to expedite the analy-
sis, the images were then down sampled in the slice direction into
15-mm-thick contiguous slices from the top of the pulmonary trunk
extending to the bottom of the symphysis pubis. Volumes of interest

 for total abdominal fat were created by outlining the perimeter of
the body on each relevant slice by using a mouse-controlled pointer
and excluding those voxels outside the structures.
The visceral (and retroperitoneal) fat was further separated by outlining
the abdominal and chest wall muscles and excluding the voxels for sub-
cutaneous fat. The fat volume was calculated automatically by multiply-
ing the cross-sectional areas of the fat-containing voxels, summed over
all slices on which the tissue was outlined by the slice thickness. This
created two fat volumes: total abdominal fat and visceral fat (from the
top of the pulmonary trunk to the bottom of the symphysis pubis). Sub-
cutaneous fat volume was calculated by subtracting visceral fat from
total abdominal fat. The liver fat percentage was also measured by
using a representative region of interest (1,000 mm2) placed in the right
lobe of the liver, avoiding the main portal veins.
Covariates
Information on ethnicity (coded according to census criteria), current
smoking status, and lipid-lowering medication use was obtained fol-
lowing an interview-administered questionnaire with a health care
professional. Height and weight (Tanita TBF-611 body fat monitor/
scale; Tanita, West Drayton, UK) were obtained by trained staff
according to standard operating procedures, and the subsequent

 values were used to compute BMI (kilograms/meters2). Social depri-
vation was determined by assigning an index of multiple deprivation
score to the participant’s resident area (based on postcode). Index of
multiple deprivation scores are publicly available continuous meas-
ures of compound social and material deprivation linked to health
outcomes (including income, employment, education, living environ-
ment, and health). The dietary habits of participants were assessed
by using the Dietary Instrument for Nutrition Education food fre-
quency questionnaire, which is a method of measuring fiber, fat, and
unsaturated fat intake in primary care (32). Only self-reported die-
tary fat intake is reported within this paper.
Statistical analysis
SPSS Statistics version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York) was
used to conduct all statistical analyses. Linear regression analysis
was used to examine the independent association of total, bouts, and
breaks in sedentary time with liver, subcutaneous, visceral, and total
abdominal fat. We display the main results per 60 minutes of seden-
tary time for ease of interpretation.
Model 1 was adjusted for age (continuous), sex, ethnicity (white
European/South Asian/other), social deprivation (continuous), smok-
ing status (current/ex/never smoked), lipid-lowering medication (yes/
no), study arm (intervention/control), dietary fat intake, and time the
accelerometer was worn (average number of minutes per day).
Model 2 was additionally adjusted for MVPA or sedentary time and
MVPA (breaks). In order to examine the extent to which total adi-
posity attenuated these relationships, model 3 was further adjusted
for BMI. Models were assessed for normality and multicollinearity
was assessed through the variance inflation factor.
Significant observations in model 3 were followed up with interac-
tion terms to assess whether associations between total sedentary
time and adiposity were modified by levels of MVPA (active vs.
inactive) or sex (male vs. female). Analysis was further stratified by
MVPA status to show the direction of significant interactions.
Two-tailed P values � 0.05 were considered statistically significant
for main effects. P < 0.1 was considered significant for interactions.
The results of the generalized linear regression analysis are pre-
sented as the unstandardized beta coefficient (b; 95% confidence
interval [CI] per 60 minutes of sedentary time). Adjustment was not
made for multiple comparisons; therefore, data were viewed with
caution and in relation to the overall pattern of results.
Results
In total, 124 participants (age5 64.067.1 years; male5 65.3%) of a
possible 141 had valid measures of objective activity, MRI, and covariate
data. There were no significant differences (P> 0.05) in anthropometric,
metabolic, and demographic measures between participants who were
included in this analysis versus those not included. Table 1 displays the
demographic, anthropometric, MRI-derived, and accelerometer charac-
teristics of all included participants and when stratified by MVPA levels.

minutes of sedentary time was associated with higher liver (1.86%;

[0.54-1.74]), and total abdominal fat (1.74 L [0.96-2.46]). Results
are displayed in Table 2. All associations persisted after further
adjustment for MVPA. The association of sedentary time with vis-
ceral and liver fat remained after additional adjustment for BMI.
Bouts of prolonged sedentary time
Results for bouts and breaks are displayed in Supporting Information
Table S1. In the fully adjusted model, there were no significant
associations between 0- to 30-minute bouts of sedentary time and
MRI outcomes. Continuous 30- to 60-minute bouts of prolonged
sedentary time were significantly associated with liver (1.44% [0.18-
2.70]), visceral (0.78 L [0.36-1.26]), subcutaneous (1.08 L [0.12-
2.04]), and total abdominal fat (1.86 L [0.66-3.12]). When further
adjusted for BMI, the results remained significant for visceral fat
(0.48 L [0.18-0.78]).
A similar pattern was observed for continuous 601 minute bouts. In
the fully adjusted model, continuous 601 minute bouts of sedentary
time were significantly associated with liver (1.44% [0.66-2.22]),
visceral (0.66 L [0.24-1.08]), and total abdominal fat (2.88 L [1.62-

Breaks in sedentary time
The number of breaks in sedentary time was significantly inversely
associated with visceral (20.06 L [20.85 to 20.26]), subcutaneous
(20.68 L [21.35 to 20.01]), and total abdominal fat (20.12 L

uated once adjusted for total sedentary time, MVPA, and BMI.
Interaction analysis
Interaction analyses indicated MVPA status modified some associa-
tions, with inactive individuals displaying stronger associations of
total sedentary time with liver, visceral, and total abdominal fat
(interaction values shown in Supporting Information Table S2).
After stratification, no significant associations were found in active
individuals. Conversely, each 60 minutes of sedentary time in the
inactive cohort was associated with 2.16% higher liver fat (1.08-
3.30), 0.54 L (0.12-0.96) higher visceral fat, and 1.80 L (0.54-
3.06 L) higher total abdominal fat (Table 3). There were no signifi-
cant interactions for bout length or breaks in sedentary time (all
P > 0.1; data not shown).
Figure 1 displays fat percentage images (from the bottom of the
symphysis pubis to the top of liver) depicting total abdominal fat in
two male participants with similar sedentary time but different
amounts of MVPA. Figure 2 displays the multiple linear regression
coefficients for 0 to 30 minutes, 30 to 60 minutes, and 601 minute
bouts of sedentary time (95% CI) with MRI-derived measures of
adiposity.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that for individuals at high risk of T2DM,
sedentary time is detrimentally associated with liver, visceral, and
total abdominal fat, independent of important confounders (including
MVPA). These findings extend previous cross-sectional results
observed in the general population (33) and in those at high risk of
T2DM (18) by showing that associations between sedentary time
and liver, visceral, and total abdominal fat are stronger in those who
do not reach the current exercise recommendations for health (< 150
min/wk), whereas no significant associations were observed in the
active (> 150 min/wk) cohort. Furthermore, the bout length of sed-
entary time influenced the strength of the association.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to look at the modifying influ-
ence of MVPA on associations between sedentary time and MRI-
derived fat distribution. The finding that the association between sed-
entary time and visceral fat is stronger in the inactive cohort is intrigu-
ing and lends credence to the proposition that physical activity levels
may be an important determinant in the accrual of adipose tissue (9).
Broadly, visceral fat has been associated with incident cardiovascular
disease, cancer, and mortality after adjustment for clinical risk factors
and generalized adiposity. In particular, it has been suggested to be an
important link between cardiorespiratory fitness (with its high correla-
tion with MVPA) and markers of the metabolic syndrome (34,35),
with exercise training studies showing inverse associations between
visceral fat and insulin sensitivity in subjects with obesity (36). Fur-
thermore, regular MVPA may induce selective reductions in visceral
abdominal adipose tissue and other region-specific fat deposits (sub-
cutaneous) that would not necessarily be apparent when using more
traditional measures to quantify body mass or adiposity (e.g., BMI,
waist circumference).
Similarly, the observation that liver fat is strongly associated with
sedentary time in the inactive cohort is a novel finding, which may
be partially explained by excess visceral fat, in which nonesterified
fatty acids (NEFA), glycerol, and hormones released from adipose
tissue within the visceral peritoneum are drained into the hepatic
portal vein that feeds directly to the liver (37). Sustained exposure
of the liver to an increased flux of NEFA via the portal circulation
is the antecedent to many of the disturbances in glucose and lipids,
thus predisposing an individual to peripheral insulin resistance,
hyperlipidemia, and hypertension (38). This process may be further
exacerbated by high levels of sedentary time and low levels of phys-
ical activity. Indeed, it has been shown that a prolonged bout of sit-
ting (7.5 hours) elicits a less favorable NEFA postprandial response
when compared with breaking sitting with either standing or walking
(5 minutes every 30 minutes), which may reflect an increase in the
lipolysis of triglycerides stored in adipose tissue in order to supply
the working muscle (39).
Our observations for a modifying effect of MVPA status on the
association of sedentary time with visceral, liver, and total abdomi-
nal fat broadly corroborates other cross-sectional research, which
has demonstrated that those who are physically active have a more
desirable cardiometabolic and inflammatory profile, even when com-
bined with high sedentary time (17,19). Similar results have also
been shown in individuals recently diagnosed with T2DM, for
whom results were suggestive of a stronger association between sed-
entary time and subcomponents of metabolic risk among individuals
below the median for cardiorespiratory fitness (15). This hypothesis
appears to extend beyond traditional markers of health, as a recent
meta-analysis, which included more than 1 million people and used
self-reported data, found that when compared with the referent
group (< 4 h/d of sitting and �60-75 min/d of moderate-intensity
activity; 9.0% of the cohort), there was no increased risk of

 mortality during follow-up in those who sat for more than 8 h/d but
also engaged in �60 to 75 minutes of activity (hazard ratio: 1.04;
95% CI: 0.99-1.10; 4.4% of the cohort). However, these high activ-
ity levels were shown to attenuate, rather than eliminate, the associ-
ation with mortality of those watching 5 h/d or more of TV (1.15;
1.05-1.29) (12).
The aforementioned observational findings have also been explored
in an experimental context, which showed that individuals with
higher fitness levels demonstrated a lower incremental area under
the curve response for glucose and insulin when subjected to 7.5
hours of prolonged sitting (38). Similarly, they also accrued less of
a metabolic benefit from breaking sitting time with light walking
when compared with those with lower fitness levels, although small
benefits were still seen for the reduction in insulin levels in individ-
uals with higher fitness. Taken together, the experimental and cross-
sectional literature have implied that sedentary time may be not be
as pertinent in individuals with a relatively high fitness level or in
those who engage in recommended levels of MVPA.
We found no significant associations between overall breaks in seden-
tary time and MRI outcomes. However, our findings do reinforce pre-
vious studies that have demonstrated that prolonged bouts of sedentary
time are detrimental to health, particularly when examining markers
of cardiometabolic health (21). We found that as the prolonged seden-
tary bout length increased (from 0-30 minutes, to 30-60 minutes, to
601 minutes), so did the strength of the association with MRI-derived
markers. This further reiterates the importance of targeting prolonged

Our study has multiple strengths. Most notably, it provides novel
evidence of the modifying effect of MVPA on MRI-derived adipos-
ity in a sedentary population with a high risk of T2DM. Secondly,

 we used gold standard measures in order to quantify regional fat
deposition and physical activity levels. All measurements (including
MRI scans) were also performed by the same team of trained staff
following identical standard operating procedures. Thirdly, partici-
pants were recruited from a multiethnic community.
Limitations include the cross-sectional design, which limited infer-
ence about the direction of causality between sedentary time and
markers of MRI-derived adiposity; as such, reverse causality remains
a possibility. It is also plausible that unmeasured lifestyle variables
(e.g., alcohol intake) and residual confounding may have influenced
the observed relationships. Exposures were only carried out at one
time point (up to 7 days), which may not be an accurate reflection of
habitual activity. Finally, accelerometers rely on categorizing move-
ment (acceleration) as opposed to distinguishing between specific pos-
tures (sitting, lying, and standing behaviors), which may lead to an
underestimation of the true association between sedentary time and
markers of adiposity.
Conclusion
These novel findings from a cohort with a high risk of T2DM sug-
gest that the deleterious associations of objectively measured seden-
tary time with visceral, liver, and total abdominal fat may be partic-
ularly
pertinent
for
those
individuals
who
do
not
undertake
sufficient amounts of MVPA. Moreover, the manner in which seden-
tary time is accumulated may influence the strength of the associa-
tions with markers of MRI-derived adiposity.O
