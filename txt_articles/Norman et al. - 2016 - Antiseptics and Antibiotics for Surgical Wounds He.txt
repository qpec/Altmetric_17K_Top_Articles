Antiseptics and Antibiotics for Surgical Wounds Healing
by Secondary Intention
Summary of a Cochrane Review
Gill Norman, PhD; Jo C. Dumville, PhD; Emma J. Crosbie, PhD
Most surgical incisions are closed with clips or sutures; approxima-
tion of cut skin edges helps wounds to heal by “primary intention.”
Wounds are left open to heal “by secondary intention”if skin edges
cannot be approximated or risk of infection is high. Others become
chronic wounds healing by secondary intention after failing to heal
by primary intention.
Surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (SWHSI) heal
slowly and cause distress, discomfort, and delayed hospital dis-
charge.Currentmanagementishighcost:regulardressingchanges
in hospital or community settings.
Open wounds are prone to microbial colonization and infec-
tion, which may affect healing, even without clear signs of infec-
tion. Antimicrobial interventions include systemic or topical antibi-
otics or antiseptics, which aim to kill or slow growth of pathogenic
microorganisms. Such treatments can prevent or treat microbial
overgrowth;thismayacceleratewoundhealing.Toassesswhether
the use of systemic and topical antibiotics, and antiseptics, is ben-

which is summarized in this article. The primary outcomes were
wound healing and wound infection.

CLINICAL QUESTION Do antiseptics and antibiotics benefit surgical wounds healing by
secondary intention (SWHSI)?
BOTTOM LINE No high-quality randomized clinical trials have addressed this question.
Current evidence is limited and insufficient; it is uncertain whether treating SWHSI with
antiseptics or antibiotics is beneficial.

•Two comparisons assessed different iodine preparations com-
pared with no antiseptic treatment; limited outcome data found
no clear evidence of treatment effects (N = 71 and N = 100) (low-
quality evidence).
Discussion
There is limited evidence to support routine use of antimicrobials
to prevent or treat infection in SWHSI. For wound healing, whereas
RCTsdoreportpossibletreatmenteffects,theevidencequalitywas
moderateorlow,withallevidencesubjecttolimitations.Almostno
evidence assessed antibiotic treatments; most evidence related to
topical antiseptic treatments.
Limitations
The studies included in our review were small and often poorly
reported, limiting their ability to indicate best practice. Partici-
pant characteristics and primary outcome measures varied
greatly between studies and were sometimes poorly described. It
was unclear how well the interventions assessed reflected cur-
rent clinical practice.
Comparison of Findings With Current Practice Guidelines
Current practice is varied and lacks a robust evidence base. The
United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
guidance3advisesagainstuseofEUSOLandgauze,ormoistcotton
gauzeormercuricantisepticsolutions,tomanageSWHSIbutmakes
no alternative recommendation, suggesting only using an “
appro-
priate interactive dressing.”
