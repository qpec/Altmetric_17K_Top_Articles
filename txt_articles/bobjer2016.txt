Summary
Objective It is yet unknown to which degree young subfertile
men present with signs of hypogonadism and whether low
testosterone concentration, like in older men, is associated with
risk of osteoporosis and metabolic derangements in those sub-
jects. The objective was therefore to investigate the prevalence of
hypogonadism and its association with metabolic and bone
parameters in young subfertile men.
Design Cross-sectional case–control study.
Patients Men from infertile couples (n = 192); 18–50 years;
sperm concentration <20 9 106/ml and population-based age-
matched controls (n = 199).
Measurements Blood sampling, anthropometrics, blood pres-
sure, ankle–brachial index and assessment by dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry were undertaken. Odds ratios of biochemical
hypogonadism (total testosterone <8�0 nmol/l and/or luteinizing
hormone ≥8�6 IU/l and/or ongoing androgen replacement ther-
apy) were calculated. Serum concentrations of sex hormones,
lipids, glucose, insulin and HbA1c were assessed and bone min-
eral density (BMD) evaluated.
Results Compared to controls, the risk of hypogonadism was
increased among subfertile men (OR 10; 95% CI, 5�1, 22), being
highest in those with nonobstructive azoospermia. Hypogonadal
men had higher HbA1c concentration (mean diff. 2�8 mmol/
mol; 95% CI, 0�64, 4�9; P = 0�011) and lower lumbar spine
BMD (mean diff. 0�05 g/cm2; 95% CI, 0�01, 0�10; P = 0�032)
compared to eugonadal subfertile men, even more pronounced
in subfertile men with subnormal testosterone levels.
Conclusion Young subfertile men have 10 times increased OR
of hypogonadism, which is linked to increased HbA1c and
decreased bone mineralization. Endocrine assessment and, if
needed, measures to prevent metabolic sequelae and osteoporo-
sis should be included in the routine management of men from
infertile couples.

Introduction
In older men, the association between androgen deficiency and
metabolic disturbances such as the metabolic syndrome (MetS),1
type 2 diabetes,2 cardiovascular disease3 and osteoporosis4 is
firmly established. Yet, the underlying mechanisms between
androgen deficiency and these conditions are complex and not
fully understood. Some studies suggested that low testosterone is
merely a marker of poor general health in elderly men.5 More-
over, the potential benefits or risks related to testosterone sup-
plementation in, for example, cardiovascular health are debated.6
Most knowledge is derived from older men with prevalent con-
current diseases, while few studies have been conducted on
younger men. In this regard, male infertility patients constitute a
relevant group for studying metabolic effects of low testosterone,
as these relatively young men often present with varying degrees
of testicular dysfunction while the prevalence of systemic mor-
bidity is low.
Approximately fifteen per cent of all couples experience invol-
untary childlessness. In about half of the cases, male subfertility
is the underlying cause, and in many fertility centres, the infer-
tility treatment is focusing on obtaining gametes for assisted
reproduction. However, decreased life expectancy has been
reported in men with impaired semen quality, but the causes are
not known and no prevention strategies have hence been devel-
oped.7 Decreased testosterone levels among men with fertility
problems have also been described and might be one of the pos-
sible causes of the increased mortality.8–12 In the subgroup of
men with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA), 50% risk of
hypogonadism has previously been reported.13 This proportion

 is, however, unknown in the more broad group of patients with
fertility problems and decreased sperm counts. Despite this lack
of sufficient data, major clinical guidelines either recommend
routine assessment of sex hormones in all infertile men14 or only
in those with sperm concentration <10 9 106/ml.15
The primary objective of this study was therefore to assess the
prevalence of biochemical indices of hypogonadism in men from
infertile couples and secondly to examine possible links between
hypogonadism and early signs of metabolic disturbance includ-
ing MetS, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.
Subjects and methods
Subjects
A retrospective cohort of male infertility patients (n = 310, 18–
50 years and sperm concentration <20 9 106/ml in at least two
samples) was identified from a consecutive group of male part-
ners of infertile couples referred to the Reproductive Medicine
Centre at Sk
�
ane University Hospital Malm€
o, Sweden, during the
period December 2006–October 2009. In addition, all patients
referred from November 2009 to July 2012, who met the same
inclusion
criteria
(n = 229,
18–50 years
and
sperm
conc.
<20 9 106/ml in at least two samples) were prospectively invited
(for details see Appendix S1). After exclusion, the final merged
cohort included 192 subjects who agreed to participate in the
study (Fig. 1).
Men who had been diagnosed with obstructive azoospermia
after the initial investigation were not invited for participation
in the study. This diagnosis was based on clinical characteristics
(normal testicular volume and reproductive hormonal profile)
and normal spermatogenesis in testicular biopsy.
Subgroups of subfertile men were also created based on sperm
concentration: (i) nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA), (ii) sev-
ere oligozoospermia (0�1–10 9 106/ml) and (iii) mild oligo-
zoospermia
(10�1–20 9 106/ml).
Sperm
concentration
was
comparable between the two inclusion arms, retrospective and
prospective: NOA: 36% vs 41%; severe oligozoospermia: 47% vs
41%; mild oligozoospermia: 17% vs 18%.
To assess the representativeness of the study sample, the dis-
tribution of sperm parameters among study participants was
compared to all men referred to our sperm laboratory during
the calendar year 2012 who presented with a sperm concentra-
tion <20 9 106/ml (n = 446). The study cohort had a slight
overrepresentation of men with low sperm concentration (NOA
39% vs 26%; severe oligozoospermia 45% vs 38%; mild oligo-
zoospermia 17% vs 36%).
A control group was selected through the Swedish Population
Registry and invited by letter. Among 977 invited controls, 235
accepted to participate. The distribution of childless, those hav-
ing 1 child and those with 2 + children was similar among par-
ticipants and nonparticipants (Appendix S1). The controls were
shared with a parallel study on young male cancer survivors,
and therefore, the number of controls and cases and their mean
age was not matched exactly in this study. Of the controls, 36
men were excluded, leaving 199 in the study (Fig. 1).
Background characteristics including medical history and
medications of cases and controls are presented in Table 1.
Genetic abnormalities were found in seven men diagnosed with
Klinefelter’s syndrome (47 XXY) and nine subjects with Y chro-
mosome
microdeletions
were
also
included
in
the
study
(Table 1).
The study was approved by the regional ethical review board
at Lund University. All subjects and controls provided written
informed consent.
Investigations
Fasting blood samples for hormonal analyses were drawn
between 0800 and 1000 h. Height, weight, waist and hip circum-
ference were measured and body mass index (BMI), waist–hip
ratio and ankle–brachial systolic blood pressure index (ABI)

 based on brachial and ankle blood pressure measurements were
calculated (Appendix S1).
Hormone assays
All analyses were performed at the Dept. of Clinical Chemistry,
Sk
�
ane University Hospital, Malm€
o, Sweden. In case, a change of
methods occurred during the course of the study, a transforma-
tion to the values for the
most recent
assay was made
(Appendix S1).
Serum values of total testosterone (TT) were assessed by a
two-step competitive immunoassay with a luminometric tech-
nique
[electrochemiluminescence
immunoassay
(ECLIA)].
Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations were
determined with a one-step immunometric sandwich assay,
ECLIA. Serum oestradiol (E2) was assessed by an immunofluo-
rometric method (DELFIA Estradiol, Wallace OY). Free testos-
terone (cFT) was calculated from TT, SHBG and a fixed
albumin level (43 g/l).16
Other blood chemistry
Lipid concentrations (P total cholesterol, P-LDL cholesterol, P-
HDL cholesterol, fP-triglycerides) were determined using stan-
dard enzymatic methods. Fasting plasma glucose was assessed
with an automated hexokinase method and fasting insulin levels
in serum were measured with an immunometric sandwich assay
(Access
Ultrasensitive
Insulin,
Beckman-Coulter,
2005,
387067C). Insulin resistance was estimated using the homeo-
static model assessment (HOMA) index. The index is calculated
as ((f-Insulin 9 f-Glucose)/22�5). Blood levels of HbA1c (IFCC)
were assessed with the VARIANT
TM TURBO Hemoglobin A1c
Kit 2.0 program using cat ion exchange and gradient elution.
The imprecision and lower detection levels for all current and
previous assays are presented in Table S1 and S2.
Hypogonadism
Participants were considered hypogonadal at TT <8�0 nmol/l
and/or LH >8�6 IU/l and/or receiving androgen replacement
therapy, initiated after completion of infertility management.
The cut-off levels were based on the normal reference values of
the laboratory (normal range for men <50 year: TT 8–30 nmol/
l; LH 1�7–8�6 IU/l). Those who were hypogonadal were further
classified into subgroups: uncompensated (subnormal testos-
terone levels) or compensated (elevated LH levels but normal
testosterone levels). Those with uncompensated hypogonadism
were also categorized as either primary (elevated LH levels) or
secondary (low/normal LH levels) hypogonadism.

terol

(NCEP-ATP III) criteria were utilized (Table S3).
Bone mineral density
Bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm²) at total hip (TH) and lum-
bar spine L1–L4 (LS) was measured using dual X-ray absorp-
tiometry (DXA; Prodigy; Lunar, GE, Madison, WI, USA) as
previously described: CV% 0�50% (total hip) and 0�65% (lum-
bar spine).17 The system stability of the DXA equipment was
checked daily by the use of a manufacturer-supplied phantom.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive values were expressed as means (SD) or medians
with interquartile ranges (IQR) for parameters with normal or
skewed distribution. The latter parameters were log-transformed
before further analysis (E2 and HOMA index).

Hypogonadism in subfertile men
3
 Comparisons of subfertile men and controls were performed
using univariate regression analysis, with and without adjust-
ment for established confounders (age, BMI and smoking).
Results are presented as mean difference between groups, with
95% confidence interval (CI). Mean differences for log-trans-
formed variables were back-transformed and correspond to
mean ratios.
Binary logistic regression analysis was applied to calculate
odds ratios (ORs) for hypogonadism in subjects vs. controls and
in subgroups of subfertile men (NOA, severe oligozoospermia,
mild oligozoospermia and excluding Klinefelter’s syndrome) vs.
controls. Also, age-adjusted ORs for MetS were calculated in
subjects vs controls as well as in hypogonadal vs eugonadal sub-
fertile men. Subjects with ongoing androgen replacement therapy
(n = 9) were included for group descriptive statistics and in cal-
culations of OR for hypogonadism, but excluded in all other
statistics.
Moreover, blood pressures, biochemical parameters and BMD
in hypogonadal subfertile vs. eugonadal subfertile were compared.
All calculations comparing hypogonadal and eugonadal sub-
fertile men were made for the entire group of hypogonadal
patients as well as separately for those with compensated and
overt hypogonadism. Men receiving antihypertensive treatment,
lipid lowering therapy, antidiabetics or corticosteroids were
excluded from calculations when relevant (Table 1). Finally, sta-
tistically significant results were rechecked after exclusion of
men with Klinefelter’s syndrome.
P < 0�05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical
analysis was performed using the SPSS version 22 software
(SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Sex hormones
Subfertile men had lower concentrations of TT, cFT and higher
serum concentrations of LH, FSH and E2 compared to controls,
also after adjustment for BMI (Table 2).
Biochemical hypogonadism
Biochemical hypogonadism was observed in 66 (34%; 95% CI,
28, 42) of the subfertile men and 10 (5�0%; 95% CI, 2�4, 9�1) of
the controls (Table 3). Among the hypogonadal subfertile men,
9 (14%) had ongoing androgen replacement therapy; 11 (17%)
presented with primary hypogonadism; 9 (14%) had secondary
hypogonadism; and 37 (56%) men had compensated hypogo-
nadism. Of the 10 hypogonadal controls, 7 had low testosterone
but normal LH, whereas 3 men had isolated high LH.
Comparison of study variables in subfertile men with com-
pensated vs. overt hypogonadism is presented in Table S4.
Blood pressure and ABI
Subfertile men had higher systolic, but not diastolic, blood pres-
sure compared to controls, whereas ABI was lower (Table 2).
No differences were observed between hypogonadal and eugo-
nadal subfertile men (Table 4).
Glucose metabolism parameters
Subfertile men had higher HOMA index compared to controls,
but not after adjusting for BMI (Table 2). Hypogonadal subfer-
tile men had higher HbA1c levels compared to eugonadal sub-
fertile men. Subfertile men with subnormal testosterone levels,
but not those with compensated hypogonadism, had higher
HOMA index compared to eugonadal subfertile men (Table 4
and Table S4).
Blood lipid parameters
Subfertile men had lower LDL cholesterol levels compared to
controls (Table 2). Subfertile men with subnormal testosterone
levels had higher triglyceride levels compared to eugonadal sub-
fertile men (Table 4).
Bone mineral density
When adjusting for age, BMI and current smoking, subfertile
men had lower BMD compared to controls at total hip, but not
at lumbar spine (Table 2).
Hypogonadal subfertile men had significantly lower BMD
compared to eugonadal subfertile men in both the crude and
the adjusted model at lumbar spine but not at total hip
(Table 4).
Subfertile men with subnormal testosterone levels, but not
those with compensated hypogonadism, had lower BMD at lum-
bar spine in both the crude and adjusted models, whereas BMD
at total hip was lower in the adjusted models only (Table 4 and
Table S4).
Metabolic syndrome
Fifteen (8�2%, 95% CI, 4�7, 13) and 14 (7�0%, 95% CI, 3�9, 12)
of the subfertile men and the controls, respectively, met the cri-
teria for MetS. Distribution of participants matching different
MetS criteria is presented in Table S5. Age-adjusted OR for
MetS was 1�6 (95% CI, 0�71, 3�5; P = 0�261) for subfertile men
compared to controls and 3�5 (95% CI, 1�2, 11; P = 0�027) for
subfertile hypogonadal men compared to subfertile eugonadal
men. Compared to eugonadal subfertile men, the age-adjusted
OR for MetS was 11 (95% CI, 3�1, 38; P < 0�001) and 2�2 (95%
CI, 0�63, 7�8; P = 0�215) for subfertile men with overt and com-
pensated hypogonadism, respectively.
Exclusion of patients with Klinefelter’s syndrome
For all statistically significant associations, except for the higher
serum E2 concentrations in subfertile men compared to controls
detected in the crude comparison, the P-values were still below
0�05 following exclusion of the seven subjects with Klinefelter’s
syndrome (data not shown).

 Discussion
The main finding of current study was that more than one-third
of young subfertile men, below 50 years of age, presented with
biochemical
hypogonadism,
either
overt
or
compensated.
Subfertile men who were hypogonadal had reduced bone den-
sity, most pronounced in men with subnormal testosterone
levels with lower BMD at both spine and hip. Metabolic distur-
bances were also pronounced in hypogonadal men, manifesting
as elevated levels of HbA1c, indicating long-term elevation of
glucose concentration in the circulation. Furthermore, subfertile
men with subnormal testosterone concentration presented with
higher triglycerides and signs of insulin resistance as well as
increased risk of manifest MetS compared to subfertile men with
testosterone and LH levels within the normal range.
For BMD, our results are in line with two previous studies on
young infertile men,12,18 showing the most pronounced decrease
in those with subnormal testosterone levels. Considering the bio-
chemical parameters, our findings indicate that the derange-
ments found to be associated with hypogonadism in older men,
already may be present at a younger age without signs of overt
metabolic or cardiovascular disease.
Low serum testosterone has previously been described as a
risk factor for metabolic disease,19 and suggested as a possible
mechanism, independent of adiposity, underlying the develop-
ment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.20 For men above
40 years, in the European Male Aging Study (EMAS), hypogo-
nadism was linked to increased risk of MetS,21 poor general
health22 as well as increased mortality.23
In the current study, deviations in study variables were found
primarily in subfertile men with subnormal testosterone levels.
This group comprises both primary and secondary hypogo-
nadism, the latter occasionally related to obesity. However, all
calculations were adjusted for BMI to rule out the possibility
that obesity would be the main driving force behind the detected
differences. Furthermore, metabolic parameters did not differ
significantly between eugonadal subfertile men and those with
compensated hypogonadism. Important to remember is that

Data are presented as the unadjusted mean (SD) unless *median (IQR) in case of non-Gaussian distribution. The latter variables have been log-trans-
formed prior to analysis and, accordingly, values in the mean difference column for those variables have been back-transformed and correspond to a
mean ratio. Data exclude subjects (n = 9) with ongoing testosterone replacement therapy. Adjusted P-values refer to age, BMI and (for ABI and BMD)
also current smoking. BMI, body mass index; BP, blood pressure; ABI, ankle–brachial index; TT, total testosterone; cFT, calculated free testosterone;
LH, luteinizing hormone; SHBG, sex hormone-binding globulin; E2, oestradiol; TH, total hip; LS, lumbar spine; †P < 0�05; ‡P < 0�01; §P < 0�001.

Hypogonadism in subfertile men
5
 younger men with compensated hypogonadism may, over time,
develop to an early uncompensated stage, as observed in older
men,24 and therefore merit further follow-up.
Our study has some limitations. We used a strictly biochemi-
cal definition of hypogonadism disregarding the presence of
clinical symptoms related to androgen deficiency as it often can
be difficult to distinguish symptoms related to testosterone defi-
ciency from those due to involuntary childlessness in men with
fertility problems.
In our selection of subjects, there was some overrepresentation
of those with very low sperm counts, which might lead to
increased risk estimates for the total group of subfertile men.
However, this did not affect the overall conclusion, as also men
with mild oligozoospermia displayed increased risk of hypogo-
nadism. Traditional immunoassays were used for sex hormone
analyses, whereas the new generation of liquid chromatography–
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is considered as gold
standard. However, while suffering from some imprecision, these
assays should still be sufficient for identification of men with sub-
normal levels of testosterone, as testosterone analyses performed
by both methods give comparable results regarding prediction of
risk of cardiac and metabolic disease in adult men.25 The single
sample collection is an obvious weakness of the study. We stan-
dardized the sampling with respect to diurnal variation, sleep and
food intake in order to limit this impact on our results.
The main strength of this study is the inclusion of relatively
young subjects with low prevalence of concurrent systemic dis-
eases, which might be the cause and not consequence of
impaired testosterone production. An additional strength is the
inclusion of a population-based control group.
Current study clearly pinpoints infertile men as a risk group
for hypogonadism, but cannot answer the question whether
androgen replacement should be recommended to those sub-
jects. There is no published randomized placebo-controlled trial
for metabolic and cardiovascular effects of androgen replacement
therapy in young hypogonadal men, but available data point to
an increase in BMD with such therapy.26
In conclusion, as a significant proportion of men from infer-
tile couples present with biochemical signs of hypogonadism,
overt or compensated, levels of reproductive hormones should
be checked in all men seeking advice for fertility problems. As
overt hypogonadism is associated with metabolic derangements
and lower BMD, this strategy will enable not only to help the
couples with the problems of involuntary childlessness, but also
in identifying subjects with androgen deficiency and in prevent-
ing serious long-term morbidity.
