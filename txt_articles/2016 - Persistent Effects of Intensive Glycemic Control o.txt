OBJECTIVES
This study investigated whether the beneficial effects of intensive glycemic con-
trol and fenofibrate treatment of dyslipidemia in reducing retinopathy progres-
sion demonstrated in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes
(ACCORD) Eye Study persisted beyond the clinical trial.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The ACCORD Study (2003–2009) randomized participants with type 2 diabetes to
intensive or standard treatment for glycemia (A1C level at <6.0% [42 mmol/mol]
vs. 7.0–7.9% [53–63 mmol/mol]), systolic blood pressure (<120 vs. 140 mmHg),
and dyslipidemia (fenofibrate [160 mg] plus simvastatin or placebo plus simvas-
tatin). ACCORD Eye Study participants, who had baseline and year 4 eye exami-
nations and fundus photographs, were reexamined in the ACCORD Follow-On
(ACCORDION) Eye Study (2010–2014) 4 years after the ACCORD trial closeout.
The outcome measure was diabetic retinopathy progression of three or more
steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale.
RESULTS
Diabetic retinopathy progressed in 5.8% with intensive glycemic treatment versus
12.7% with standard (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.28–0.63, P <
0.0001), 7.5% with intensive blood pressure treatment versus 6.0% for standard
(aOR 1.21, 95% CI 0.61–2.40, P = 0.59), and 11.8% with fenofibrate versus 10.2%
with placebo (aOR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71–1.79, P = 0.60) in ACCORDION Eye participants
(n = 1,310).
CONCLUSIONS
Prior intensive glycemic control continued to reduce diabetic retinopathy progres-
sion, despite similar A1C levels, when the ACCORD Study ended. This is the first
study in people with type 2 diabetes of 10 years’ duration and established car-
diovascular disease, unlike the newly diagnosed participants of the UK Prospec-
tive Diabetes Study, to demonstrate this effect. The benefit of fenofibrate,
however, did not persist. Intensive blood pressure control had no effect.

DIABETES CARE SYMPOSIUM
 The United Kingdom Prospective Diabe-
tes Study (UKPDS) (ISRCTN75451837)
demonstrated that intensive glycemic
control and intensive blood pressure
(BP) control (,150/85 mmHg) slowed
the progression of diabetic retinopathy
in people with newly diagnosed type 2
diabetes (1,2). The continued beneficial
effects of intensive glycemic control for
microvascular complications were ob-
served 10 years after the clinical trial
(3). Similarly, the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial (DCCT) showed that
;6.5 years of intensive glycemic control
was effective in reducing the risk of pro-
gression of diabetic retinopathy and
that the effect persisted for at least 10
years after the trial ended in people with
type 1 diabetes (4). The Fenofibrate Inter-
vention and Event Lowering in Diabetes
(FIELD) study found that fenofibrate re-
duced retinopathy progression in people
with type 2 diabetes and additional risk
factors for cardiovascular outcomes (5).
For type 1 diabetes, the DCCT showed
that ;6.5 years of intensive glycemic con-
trol was effective in reducing the risk of
progression of diabetic retinopathy and
that the effect persisted for at least 10
years after the trial ended (4). Most re-
cently,theActiontoControlCardiovascular
Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Eye Study dem-
onstrated that intensive glycemic control
and fenofibrate both reduced retinopathy
progression in people with established
type2diabetesandadditionalcardiovascu-
lar risk factors, whereas lowering of systolic
BP (,120 mmHg) did not affect progres-
sion compared with ,140 mmHg (6).
After the ACCORD trial was completed,
surviving participants who were invited
for follow-up in the main study and who
had fundus photographs at baseline were
invited to have additional photographs
8 years after randomization. The effects of
a mean of 3.7 years of intensive glycemic
control and ;5 years of intensive BP con-
trol and/or fenofibrate on the progression
of diabetic retinopathy during 8 years
of follow-up in the ACCORD Follow-On
(ACCORDION) Eye Study are reported here.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
ACCORD Study and ACCORD Eye
Study
The designs of the original ACCORD Study
and the ACCORD Eye Study were previ-
ously reported (7,8). Briefly, the ACCORD
Study, a randomized trial conducted in
the U.S. and Canada, enrolled 10,251
volunteers who had type 2 diabetes
with glycosylated hemoglobin of $7.5%
(58 mmol/mol). All participants were
randomized to receive intensive glyce-
mic control (targeting glycated hemo-
globin level of ,6.0% [42 mmol/mol]) or
standard control (target of 7.0–7.9%
[53–63 mmol/mol]). The 5,518 partici-
pants with dyslipidemia in the lipid trial
were given simvastatin to lower the level
of LDL cholesterol and were randomly as-
signed tofenofibrate (160mg/day), tode-
crease triglyceride levels and to increase
HDL cholesterol levels, or to placebo. The
remaining 4,733 participants were ran-
domly assigned intensive BP control (target-
ing systolic BP of ,120 mmHg) or standard
treatment (,140 mmHg). The primary
outcome was a composite end point of
time until the first occurrence of nonfatal
stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or
death from cardiovascular causes.
The ACCORD Eye Study analyzed a
subset of 2,856 participants who had
not received laser photocoagulation or
vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic reti-
nopathy and who had baseline and year-
4 data. These participants had seven-field
stereoscopic fundus photographs that
were assessed using a standard protocol
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
Fundus Photograph Reading Center by
trained graders with no knowledge of
treatment assignments. The photographs
were graded using an abbreviated and
modified version of the Early Treatment
Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Final
Retinopathy Severity Scale for Persons,
whichaccountsforbotheyeswith17steps
(from 1, which is no retinopathy in either
eye, to 17, which is high-risk proliferative
diabetic retinopathy in both eyes) (9).
At each annual ACCORD visit, we
asked participants whether they had un-
dergone retinal laser photocoagulation
or vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic
retinopathy. Visual acuity was measured
in the study clinics every 2 years in all
ACCORD participants using a standardized
visual acuity chart (ETDRS chart) to assess
moderatevisionloss,definedasworsening
in either eye by three or more lines on the
visual acuity chart from baseline.
The primary outcome for ACCORD Eye
was a composite of progression of retinop-
athy of three steps or more or vitrectomy
or laser photocoagulation for proliferative
diabetic retinopathy. The primary goal was
to determine whether any of three medi-
cal interventions would affect diabetic ret-
inopathy progression. The ACCORD Study
demonstrated that both intensive glyce-
mic control and fenofibrate, but not in-
tensive BP control, reduced retinopathy
progression (6).

 baseline. The ACCORDION Eye Study ex-
amination was ;8 years after randomiza-
tion and 3 to 5 years after the end of the
randomized clinical trial. The8-yearexam-
ination included stereoscopic fundus pho-
tographs, but no additional clinical data
were collected. The primary outcome
was progression of diabetic retinopathy
by three or more steps on the ETDRS per-
son scale based on fundus photographs at
year 8 compared with baseline. Measure-
mentofvisualacuitycontinuedevery2years
in all participants at the ACCORDION clinics.
A secondary outcome was the effect of the
medical therapies on moderate visual loss,
defined as in ACCORD Eye, three or more
lines of vision loss compared with baseline.
Statistical Analyses
Comparisons of groups were made using
a two-sample t test, x2 test, or trend test
(baseline retinopathy). Separate models
were used for each of the three primary
hypotheses (glycemic control, lipid con-
trol, and BP control). In the ACCORDION
Eye Study, the main comparisons were
madeusinglikelihood-ratio testsfromlogis-
tic regression models with adjustment for
the same factors used in the ACCORDION
primary analyses (the trial [lipid vs. BP],
the other treatments, prior cardiovascular
events, and the network centers that su-
pervised the clinics in each of the local
regions). All analyses were based on the
intention-to-treatprinciple.Interval-censored
Cox proportional hazards models were
used to assess three-step ETDRS progres-
sion using data at 0, 4, and 8 years in
sensitivity analyses. Similar models were
used to test for visual acuity loss in the
entire ACCORDION cohort. Finally, mod-
els accounting for the competing risk of
death were examined (10).
We performed 36 protocol-specified
comparisons of subgroups defined on the
basis of cutoff points that had been pre-
viously chosen (8) or used in the main
ACCORD studies (11–13). Tests of interac-
tion of baseline characteristics and other
variables with treatment effect were per-
formed by adding the subgroup and the
interaction term to the primary models
and using a likelihood-ratio test for the
interaction. No adjustment for multiple
comparisons was made. Multiple imputa-
tion was used for sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS
Of 2,856 ACCORD participants with base-
line and year 4 eye examinations, 543
refused to enroll in the overall ACCORDION
Study, 33 died before ACCORD finished,
82 died in the ACCORDION Study, and
23 were in sites that did not partici-
pate in the ACCORDION Study (Fig. 1).
This left a potential 2,175 ACCORD Eye
Study participants eligible for the
ACCORDION Eye Study; of these, 1,268
(58%) had eye examinations at baseline,
year 4, and year 8. In addition, 616
ACCORD Eye Study participants had base-
line examinations only, and 42 of them
returned for the examination at year 8,
giving us 1,310 participants for this report.
Table 1 compares ACCORD Eye Study
participants who were examined in the
ACCORDION Eye Study (n = 1,310) with
those who did not participate in the
ACCORDION Eye Study (n = 2,162). The
ACCORDION Eye Study participants
were more likely to be white, with lower
levels of glycated hemoglobin, LDL cho-
lesterol, systolic BP, and urinary albumin
creatinine ratio, and lower rates of cur-
rent and past smoking. They had fewer
prior cardiovascular events and had less
severe diabetic retinopathy than the
nonparticipants.
Baseline Characteristics
Of the 1,310 ACCORDION Eye Study par-
ticipants, 762 were enrolled in the lipid
study and 548 in the BP study. The com-
parisons of the baseline characteristics
by treatment group for each of the
three studies showed minimal differ-
ences (Table 2).
At the beginning of the ACCORD Eye
Study in 2003, the baseline glycated he-
moglobin was 8.1% (65 mmol/mol) for
the intensive glycemia group and 8.2%
(66 mmol/mol) for the standard glyce-
mia group (Fig. 2A). During the course of
the ACCORD Eye Study, the hemoglobin
A1c decreased to a mean of 6.4% (46
mmol/mol) in the intensive group and
to 7.7% (61 mmol/mol) in the standard

 group. Intensive glycemia management
was stopped in February 2008, after a
median of 3.7 years (IQR 2.7–4.3) of
follow-up due to an increase in all-cause
mortality (11). Eye study participants
continued in the trial with the standard
therapy until the end of the study in June
2009. The glycated hemoglobins were
7.3% (56 mmol/mol) for the intensive
glycemia group and 7.7% (61 mmol/mol)
for the standard glycemia group at the
beginning of the ACCORDION Study. By
the end of ACCORDION, the A1C levels
were similar: 7.8% (62 mmol/mol) and
7.9% (63 mmol/mol) for the intensive
and standard treatment groups, respec-
tively (P = 0.1) (Fig. 2A).
Similarly, the serum triglyceride levels
in both groups of the study were almost
identical at baseline at 196 mg/dL and
194 mg/dL, for the fenofibrate plus sim-
vastatin and the placebo plus simvasta-
tin groups, respectively. However, the
difference in the serum triglyceride
levels achieved during the course of
ACCORD in the two treatment groups
was eliminated during the ACCORDION
Study when fenofibrate was no longer
administered (Fig. 2B). The difference in
the HDL cholesterol achieved during the
study also diminished when fenofibrate
was stopped (Fig. 2C). Intensive BP man-
agement also reduced the systolic and di-
astolic BPs compared with the standard
BP treatment during the ACCORD Study.
Again, this difference was reduced when
the clinical trial was stopped, although
some difference remained (Fig. 2D).
Progression of Diabetic Retinopathy
Table 3 reports the results of the pre-
viously published data on the effects of
the medical therapy in ACCORD using
the composite primary outcome, which
consisted of three or more steps of pro-
gression along the ETDRS scale or vit-
rectomy or laser photocoagulation for
diabetic retinopathy. Similar analyses
were repeated for the ACCORD data us-
ing the ACCORDION primary outcome of
progression of three or more steps along
the ETDRS scale only. The results for this
outcome were not substantially different
from the analyses of the composite out-
come, confirming the beneficial effects of
intensive glycemic control and the man-
agement of dyslipidemia with fenofibrate
(plus simvastatin) on the progression of
diabetic retinopathy, with adjusted odds
ratios (ORs) of 0.61 (P = 0.001) and 0.54
(P = 0.002), respectively (Table 3).

year 8. The adjusted OR was 0.42 (95%
CI 0.28–0.63, P , 0.0001) (Table 3). By
an interval-censored Cox proportional
hazards model with data for years 4
and 8 but including only participants
who had data at year 8, the adjusted
hazard ratio (HR) was 0.45 (95% CI
0.32–0.64, P , 0.0001) (Table 4). Similar
analyses including all participants with
data at year 4 or year 8 resulted in the
adjusted HR of 0.56 (95% CI 0.44–0.71,
P , 0.0001), again indicating a benefi-
cial effect of intensive glycemic control
compared with standard care (Table 4).
When adjusted for the competing risk of
death, the adjusted HR was 0.58 (95% CI
0.46–0.73, P , 0.0001) (Table 4). When
the analysis was confined to the follow-
up period in ACCORDION only, measuring
the change at 8 years from the 4-year
visit, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was
0.67 (95% CI 0.39–1.14, P = 0.13).
Fenofibrate Plus Simvastatin Versus
Placebo Plus Simvastatin
The rates of diabetic retinopathy progres-
sion at year 8 from the beginning of
ACCORD were 11.8% (47 of 399) in the
fenofibrate group and 10.2% (37 of 363)
in the placebo group, with an adjusted OR
of 1.13 (95% CI 0.71–1.79, P = 0.60) (Table
3). Using the Cox proportional hazards
model resulted in an adjusted HR of 0.76
(95% CI 0.57–1.03, P = 0.08) (Table 4).
When adjusted for the competing risk of
death, the adjusted HR was 0.83 (95% CI
0.69–1.00, P = 0.04) (Table 4).
Intensive Versus Standard BP Control
The rates of diabetic retinopathy pro-
gression were 7.5% (21 of 280) and
6.0% (16 of 268) in the intensive and
standard BP groups, respectively, with
an adjusted OR of 1.21 (95% CI 0.61–
2.40, P = 0.59) (Table 3). Using an inter-
val censored Cox proportional hazards
model resulted in an adjusted HR of
1.05 (95% CI 0.73–1.51, P = 0.79) (Table 4).

Subgroup Analyses
In the ACCORDION Eye Study, similar to
the ACCORD Eye Study, we found no
significant interactions between treat-
ment and any of the prespecified char-
acteristics in subgroup analyses, with
the exception of baseline retinopathy
(nominal P = 0.01) in the lipid trial and
sex (nominal P = 0.01) and smoking
(nominal P = 0.02) in the BP trial (Figs.
3, 4, and 5). With the exception of in-
teraction of sex in the BP trial, there was
no interaction between treatment and
sex or between sex and race in these
analyses.
Sensitivity Analyses
Two sensitivity analyses were done to
assess the applicability of these findings
from a subset of ACCORDION partici-
pants to all ACCORDION participants.
First, an analysis was restricted to par-
ticipants at ACCORDION sites in which
80% or more of the participants were
examined in both arms of the glycemia
trial at year 8 (n = 365). In this subset,
the OR for progression of diabetic reti-
nopathy was 0.32 (95% CI 0.06–1.65).
Second, the effect of the intervention
on a post hoc composite outcome of
progression of eye disease or death
was estimated as an alternative way of ac-
counting for the competing risk of death.
This estimate yielded an OR of 0.71 (95% CI
0.58–0.87).
CONCLUSIONS
Our results showed that intensive glyce-
miccontrolconferred enduringprotection
from progression of diabetic retinopathy
even though the glycated hemoglobin
levels were similar 8 years after randomi-
zation and ;4 years after the cessation
of the clinical trial. This is the first study
in people with type 2 diabetes of ;10
years’ duration and established cardio-
vascular disease, unlike the newly diag-
nosed participants in the UKPDS, that
demonstrated this effect. This phenom-
enon has been called “metabolic mem-
ory” or “legacy effect” in the studies of
type 1 diabetes (14). At 10 years after the
clinical trial, the UKPDS showed that mi-
crovascular complications, which included
self-reports of vitreous hemorrhage, reti-
nal photocoagulation, or renal failure,
continued to be reduced significantly by
24% in those previously assigned to tight
glycemic control (sulfonylurea-insulin
group) versus standard glycemic control
(relative risk 0.76, 95% CI 0.64–0.89, P ,
0.001) (3). However, for those random-
ized to metformin versus standard care
in the UKPDS, there was no statistically
significant beneficial effect in reducing
microvascular risk (relative risk 0.84,
95% CI 0.60–1.17, P = 0.31) (3). The first
report after the termination of DCCT also
showed that after 4 years of follow-up in
EDIC, the intensive glycemic treatment
group had a 75% (P , 0.001) reduction
in the risk of progression of diabetic ret-
inopathy compared with the conven-
tional glycemic treatment group (15).
This effect was shown to last for 10 years
in a subsequent report (14). Their most
recent report showed, after a median
follow-up of 23 years, a 48% reduction in
theriskofocularproceduresinparticipants
originally randomized to the intensive
treatment group (16). It has been sug-
gested that it is important to implement
intensive glycemic control as early as pos-
sible to obtain the maximum effect (14).
The ACCORDION findings demonstrate
a similar legacy effect of intensive glyce-
mia control on the progression of retinal
disease in people with established type 2
diabetes. Moreover, this effect occurred
in response to a median of 3.7 years of
intensive glycemic control (17), and was
observed in people with type 2 diabetes
and additional cardiovascular risk fac-
tors, whose mean diabetes duration
was 10 years, and whose initial mean
HbA1c was 8.2%. These observations sug-
gest that glucose lowering can reduce
progression of retinal disease relatively
late in the course of diabetes and that
the retina responds to relatively short-
term changes in glucose levels. Whether

 lost. The benefit was no longer seen, ex-
cept in analyses accounting for death
as a competing event, and even here,
the estimated effect was greatly dimin-
ished. This would suggest that the
beneficial effect of fenofibrate on the
progression of diabetic retinopathy
during the trial may be clinically impor-
tant and that these effects require con-
tinued treatment with fenofibrate to be
maintained. The subgroup analyses
from the ACCORD Eye Study showed
that the beneficial effect was most
prominent in people who had diabetic
retinopathy at baseline (6). Our second-
ary analyses in theACCORD Eye Study also
showed that in those with baseline mild
and moderate diabetic retinopathy, the
ORs were 0.27 (95% CI 0.12–0.63, P =
0.0009) and 0.41 (95% CI 0.14–1.18,
P = 0.09), respectively (18). These find-
ings confirm the overall FIELD study
results, which showed beneficial effects
of fenofibrate (200 mg daily) versus pla-
cebo in reducing the need for laser pho-
tocoagulation (HR 0.69, 95% CI0.56–0.84,
P = 0.0002) (4). In a substudy of partici-
pants in the FIELD study with fundus pho-
tographs, an exploratory composite end
point, which included two-step pro-
gression of diabetic retinopathy, the
development of macular edema, or
the need for laser photocoagulation,
was also significantly lower in the fe-
nofibrate group compared with the
placebo group (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47–0.94,
P = 0.02) (4).
The results of these two studies would
suggest that fenofibrate may potentially
be a therapy for individuals with type 2
diabetes to decrease the progression of
diabetic retinopathy, especially in those
with preexisting diabetic retinopathy. A
number of investigators have evaluated
the potential mechanisms of action, in-
cluding its ability to be a lipid-modifying
drug, by decreasing plasma triglyceride,
apolipoprotein B, and LDL cholesterol lev-
els and by increasing HDL cholesterol and
apolipoprotein A-I (19). However, the
beneficial effects of fenofibrate did not
correlate with changes in serum lipid lev-
els in the FIELD and ACCORD Eye Study. It
is possible that the serum lipids have less
of a role, while the regulation of intrare-
tinal lipid transport has been implicated
in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopa-
thy. A number of other nonlipid-related
mechanisms have also been proposed, in-
cluding antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory,

 antioxidant, and antiangiogenic actions.
There are also thoughts that fenofibrate,
a peroxisome proliferator–activated re-
ceptor a agonist, may also impart neuro-
protective effects and provide protection
from the breakdown of the blood-retinal
barrier (20).
Because fenofibrate failed to have an
effect on cardiovascular events in ACCORD
andFIELD, it is not routinely prescribed for
the management of dyslipidemia by
medical physicians. Ophthalmologists
rarely prescribe medical therapies di-
rected at other organ systems, but in
this instance, it is important for both
ophthalmologists and medical physi-
cians to collaborate and to reconsider
the role of fenofibrate for the treatment
of diabetic retinopathy, especially in
those who already exhibit some degree
of diabetic retinopathy (21).
We did not demonstrate an effect of
intensive BP control on the progression
of diabetic retinopathy at 4 or 8 years. In
contrast, the UKPDS showed that inten-
sive BP control (,150 vs. ,180 mmHg)
resulted in a significant reduction in the
progression of diabetic retinopathy
(34.0% vs. 51.3%, P = 0.004) and moder-
atevision loss (10.2% vs. 19.4%, P = 0.004)
after 7.5 years (2).
That the reduction in the progres-
sion of diabetic retinopathy did not af-
fect the rates of moderate visual loss
is not surprising. This was also seen in
the ACCORD Eye Study. To show a dif-
ference in visual acuity, a much larger
sample size would be required because
the treatments for diabetic retino-
pathy are highly effective in reducing
severe vision loss by as much as 95%
(22).
Limitations in the ACCORDION Eye
Study include the low recruitment rate
of ACCORD Eye participants (nearly 60%
of those eligible from the ACCORD Eye
cohort) and that the participants in
ACCORDION Eye tended to be healthier
and younger, with lower baseline gly-
cated hemoglobin, fewer previous car-
diovascular events, and less severe
diabetic retinopathy. However, our
sensitivity analyses showed that the
point estimate of 0.32 from the ad-
justed OR of the participants who
were enrolled in clinics, in which 80%
of the participants returned for the
follow-up study at year 8, was similar
to the overall adjusted OR of 0.42. The
effect of the intervention on a post hoc
composite outcome of progression of
eye disease or death was estimated as
an alternative way of accounting for
the competing risk of death. This esti-
mate yielded an OR of 0.71 (95% CI
0.58–0.87). The point estimates of
the clinics with a high yield of return
participants in ACCORDION were very
similar to the overall results from
Figure 5—Subgroup effects in the ACCORDION participants previously randomized in the BP trial. The estimated ORs for progression of diabetic

 ACCORDION Eye, suggesting that these
results from the subset of ACCORDION
Eye Study participants may indeed be
applicable to the ACCORDION Study
population.
Another limitation of our study was
that data on retinopathy outcomes
were collected only once during this fol-
low-up study. Although some studies
such as the DCCT collected annual pro-
gression rates, it is important to note
that progression in diabetic retinopathy
was evaluated during 3-year intervals in
the UKPDS, a study of individuals with
type 2 diabetes. We also found no evi-
dence of significant differences in miss-
ing data rates, and the results of the
sensitivity analyses supported the re-
sults of the primary analyses.
In summary, our study results pro-
vide evidence that intensive glycemic
control is beneficial for reducing the
progression of diabetic retinopathy
and that the legacy effect is evident in
people with type 2 diabetes. ACCORD
previously reported that 3.7 years of
intensive glycemic control reduced
progression of albuminuria as well as
neuropathy during the treatment pe-
riod and at 1.3 years after cessation of
treatment (23). The addition of the
ACCORDION retinal results to these
prior findings demonstrates a posttreat-
ment benefit of intensive glycemia con-
trol on the progression of eye, kidney,
and nerve disease. There is also evidence
that the beneficial effect of fenofibrate
on diabetic retinopathy in the ACCORD
Eye Study may be real but requires con-
tinued use of this treatment to maintain
benefit. Therefore, it may be important
to reconsider the use of fenofibrate for
the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.
Finally, systolic BP control to the levels
of 140 mmHg or 120 mmHg had no
harmful or beneficial effect in both the
ACCORD Eye Study and the ACCORDION
Eye Study.
