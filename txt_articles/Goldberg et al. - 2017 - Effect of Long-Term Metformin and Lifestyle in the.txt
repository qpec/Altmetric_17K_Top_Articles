ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE
BACKGROUND: Despite the reduced incidence of coronary heart 
disease with intensive risk factor management, people with diabetes 
mellitus and prediabetes remain at increased coronary heart disease 
risk. Diabetes prevention interventions may be needed to reduce 
coronary heart disease risk. This approach was examined in the DPP 
(Diabetes Prevention Program) and the DPPOS (Diabetes Prevention 
Program Outcome Study), a long-term intervention study in 3234 
subjects with prediabetes (mean±SD age, 64±10 years) that showed 
reduced diabetes risk with lifestyle and metformin compared with 
placebo over 3.2 years.
METHODS: The DPPOS offered periodic group lifestyle sessions to all 
participants and continued metformin in the originally randomized 
metformin group. Subclinical atherosclerosis was assessed in 2029 
participants with coronary artery calcium (CAC) measurements after 
an average of 14 years of follow-up. The CAC scores were analyzed 
continuously as CAC severity and categorically as CAC presence (CAC 
score >0) and reported separately in men and women.
RESULTS: There were no CAC differences between lifestyle and placebo 
intervention groups in either sex. CAC severity and presence were 
significantly lower among men in the metformin versus the placebo 
group (age-adjusted mean CAC severity, 39.5 versus 66.9 Agatston units, 
P=0.04; CAC presence, 75% versus 84%, P=0.02), but no metformin 
effect was seen in women. In multivariate analysis, the metformin effect 
in men was not influenced by demographic, anthropometric, or metabolic 
factors; by the development of diabetes mellitus; or by use/nonuse of 
statin therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin may protect against coronary atherosclerosis 
in prediabetes and early diabetes mellitus among men.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH

T
he incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) is 
increased ≈2-fold in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 
CHD remains the single most important cause of 
morbidity and mortality in diabetes mellitus.1 Interven-
tions targeting factors that accelerate coronary ath-
erosclerosis such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyper-
glycemia, and a procoagulant state have contributed 
to the significantly reduced incidence of CHD in the 
general population in recent years.2 However, despite 
intensive management of CHD risk factors and paral-
lel reductions in overall rates of CHD in diabetes melli-
tus, there remains considerable diabetes-related excess 
CHD risk, suggesting that there are limitations to the 
benefits of these CHD-targeted clinical interventions in 
established diabetes mellitus.3 Greater success in reduc-
ing CHD may thus be achieved by initiating preventive 
approaches as early as possible in the course of dia-
betes mellitus, including diabetes prevention itself. For 
example, lifestyle or pharmacological interventions for 
diabetes prevention, implemented early in the progres-
sion from prediabetes to diabetes mellitus when clinical 
CHD events are less common, may be the key to fun-
damentally altering the increased risk of atherosclerosis 
in this disease.
The DPP (Diabetes Prevention Program) and DPPOS 
(Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study) make 
up one of the few clinical trials testing the effects of 
therapeutic interventions in subjects with prediabetes 
on long-term health outcomes. DPP demonstrated that 
intensive lifestyle change or metformin treatment re-
duced the incidence of diabetes mellitus and improved 
the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profile in a cohort 
of subjects at high risk for diabetes mellitus.4 Because 
the onset of diabetes mellitus was systematically ascer-
tained through semiannual assessments, it was possible 
to demonstrate that development of diabetes mellitus 
was accompanied by deterioration of cardiovascular 
risk factors in DPP and DPPOS.5,6 However, to date, 
there are too few CVD events to assess the effect of 
our interventions on these outcomes. Coronary artery 
calcium (CAC) measurements reflect total coronary 
atherosclerotic burden and provide an effective, non-
invasive tool to predict CHD events in cohorts with and 
without type 2 diabetes mellitus and without known 
CHD.7,8 We performed measurements of CAC to assess 
DPP/DPPOS treatment effects on this early marker of 
subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.
METHODS
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, 
and the studies were approved by the institutional review 
board at each clinical center (Figure 1 shows the CONSORT 
[Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials] flow diagram).
DPP Design 
The DPP was a randomized clinical trial comparing metfor-
min treatment or an individual behavioral lifestyle interven-
tion program with placebo in preventing or delaying incident 
diabetes mellitus.4 Inclusion criteria were age ≥25 years, body 
mass index (BMI) ≥24 kg/m2 (≥22 kg/m2 in Asian Americans), 
fasting plasma glucose levels between 95 and 125 mg/
dL, and impaired glucose tolerance (2-hour postload glu-
cose of 140–199 mg/dL). Those taking medications known 
to alter glucose tolerance, had experienced a CVD event in 
the prior 6 months, or had illnesses that reduced their abil-
ity to participate were excluded. Participants were randomly 
assigned to 1 of 3 interventions: metformin 850 mg twice 
daily, placebo twice daily, or an intensive program of lifestyle 
modification. Treatment assignments were stratified accord-
ing to clinical center and double-blinded for the metformin 
and placebo groups. The goals of lifestyle change were to 
achieve and maintain a weight reduction of at least 7% of 
initial body weight through consumption of a low-calorie, 
low-fat diet and to engage in moderate physical activity for 
at least 150 min/wk. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed on the 
basis of an annual oral glucose tolerance test or a semiannual 
fasting plasma glucose test according to American Diabetes 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Despite intensive risk factor management, cardio-
vascular disease remains a major cause of morbid-
ity and mortality in diabetes mellitus, raising the 
question of whether diabetes prevention interven-
tions may be important in reducing cardiovascular 
disease risk in diabetes mellitus.
• We found that men but not women with predia-
betes treated with metformin for an average dura-
tion of 14 years in the Diabetes Prevention Program 
Outcome Study had lower coronary calcium scores 
than their placebo group counterparts.
• No difference in coronary calcium scores was 
observed in the group receiving a lifestyle interven-
tion compared with the placebo group.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Several studies in subjects with diabetes mellitus 
have suggested that metformin treatment is asso-
ciated with a reduction in cardiovascular disease 
events.
• These findings provide the first evidence that 
metformin may protect against coronary athero-
sclerosis in men with prediabetes, although dem-
onstration that metformin reduces cardiovascular 
disease events in these subjects is needed before 
firm therapeutic implications of these findings can 
be determined.
• The reason for an absence of an effect in women is 
unclear; women have less coronary atherosclerosis 
and coronary calcium than men, and therefore, a 
metformin effect may be more difficult to identify 
in women.

Association criteria.9 The diagnosis required confirmation by 
a second test, usually within 6 weeks. If diabetes mellitus was 
diagnosed and confirmed, diagnoses were reported to the 
participants, and their healthcare providers were informed. 
Study metformin or placebo was provided until hyperglyce-
mia worsened to a fasting plasma glucose level ≥140 mg/
dL during DPP or an hemoglobin A1c >7.0% during DPPOS. 
When this occurred, study drug was discontinued, and dia-
betes management was transferred to the participant’s own 
healthcare provider. Although participants and their providers 
were informed of study-related blood pressure and lipid pro-
file results, all medical management decisions were made by 
the participants’ healthcare providers.
DPPOS Design 
DPP showed that lifestyle intervention reduced incidence of 
diabetes mellitus by 58% and metformin by 31% compared 
with placebo during an average follow-up of 3.2 years.4 At 
the end of DPP
, the placebo and metformin groups were 
unmasked to their treatment assignment, and all participants 
were offered the lifestyle intervention in a group format dur-
ing a 1-year bridge period. All surviving consented members 
(n=3149) of the 3 original DPP treatment arms, regardless 
of diabetes status, were invited to participate in the DPPOS, 
and 2776 participants (88%) joined.10 Maintenance group 
lifestyle sessions, offered quarterly to all DPPOS participants, 
reinforced the basic lifestyle content and the weight loss 
and physical activity goals. In addition to the maintenance 
sessions, the original lifestyle group was offered supplemen-
tary group programs, reinforcing specific behavioral self-man-
agement activities, twice per year. During DPPOS, metformin, 
now unmasked, continued to be provided to participants ran-
domized to metformin who remained eligible.
Clinical and Metabolic Variables
Standardized interviewer-administered questionnaires were 
used to obtain demographic and clinical data. Ever smoking 
was defined as prior use of ≥100 cigarettes. Blood pressure 
(BP), height, and weight were measured with standardized 
techniques. Hemoglobin A1c, lipid profile, serum creati-
nine and urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein (CRP) and plasma tissue-type plasmino-
gen activator (tPA) measurements were performed at the 
Central Biochemistry Laboratory (Northwest Lipid Research 
Laboratories, University of Washington, Seattle) as previously 
reported.4,6 Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated 
with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 
equation.11 All assessments were performed at baseline and 
annually thereafter except for CRP and tPA, which were mea-
sured at baseline, at year 1 for DPP
, and years 1 and 5 for 
DPPOS.
CAC Measurements
CAC was measured during year 10 of DPPOS in 2029 partici-
pants at all 25 sites according to previously published meth-
ods.12 This represents 74% of the DPPOS cohort (Figure 1).

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
Participants who weighed >350 lb at the time of scanning6 
were ineligible to participate in the CAC substudy because of 
the inability to acquire the relevant images on conventional 
equipment; 201 refused consent; 57 had a stent; 32 had 
atrial fibrillation; and 1 was pregnant. At the DPP baseline 
examination, participants who later underwent CAC stud-
ies had slightly higher minority race/ethnicity representation, 
were slightly younger, and had modestly lower BMI and lower 
systolic BP
, and slightly fewer were smokers compared with 
those who did not undergo the procedure. Baseline meta-
bolic measures were not different between the tested and 
untested groups except for slightly higher high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in tested participants. The 
proportion with CAC measurements did not differ among 
treatment groups. Chest computed tomography was per-
formed by certified technologists at each site using pro-
spectively ECG-triggered scan acquisition at 50% of the R-R 
interval with a multidetector system, acquiring a block of four 
2.5-mm slices for each cardiac cycle in a sequential or axial 
scan mode. Subjects were scanned twice, and the CAC mea-
surement was calibrated against a phantom of known physi-
cal calcium concentration. A radiologist or cardiologist read 
all computed tomography scans at the central reading center 
(Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA, 
Torrence, CA) in a manner blinded to patient characteristics 
and treatment assignment. Discrepancies were reviewed, and 
agreement was obtained through consensus. For each scan, 
a total phantom-adjusted averaged Agatston score13 was cal-
culated, defined as the sum of calcium measures from the left 
main, left anterior descending, circumflex, and right coronary 
arteries.
Statistical Methods
The outcomes reported in these analyses are based on data 
obtained as of January 2, 2014, for the 2061 DPPOS par-
ticipants who had CAC measurements. All treatment group 
comparisons were conducted on the basis of the original ran-
domized interventions.
CAC was expressed both as a continuous variable (CAC 
severity) and as a categorical variable, mainly with a cut point 
of 0 (CAC presence) but also with cut points of10 and 100 
Agatston units. CAC severity was considered the primary 
measure for this analysis because of greater power in ana-
lyzing continuous outcomes. CAC severity was analyzed by 
Tobit regression14 of the CAC score with the lifereg procedure 
in SAS to account for the skewness resulting from the rela-
tively large number of individuals with a CAC score of 0. CAC 
scores were transformed to log(CAC+1). The Tobit regression 
coefficient represents the log ratio of the geometric mean 
CAC score per unit increase in the covariate, assuming some 
true measurable calcification for all subjects, including those 
with undetectable levels. The adjusted CAC mean scores 
were expressed as the geometric mean by back-transforming 
the adjusted censored mean calculated from the Tobit model. 
The presence of CAC (CAC >0) was analyzed with logistic 
regression.
Prespecified analysis of treatment effect modification by 
demographic subgroups (baseline age, sex, and race) and dia-
betes status subgroups was conducted with the use of an 
interaction term in the models for CAC severity. If significant 
heterogeneity or interaction was detected among subgroups, 
then under the closure principle,15 the difference between 
groups can be tested within each subgroup or category at the 
0.05 level without the need to adjust for multiple tests. There 
was an interaction between sex and the metformin versus 
placebo effect on CAC presence (P=0.01) and CAC severity 
(P=0.08). Thus, all analyses were stratified by sex as a result of 
the interaction and of the expected differences between men 
and women. Other secondary analyses were not adjusted 
for multiple comparisons and are nominally significant at the 
0.05 level.
RESULTS
Cohort Characteristics 
Characteristics at baseline and follow-up of the cohort 
included in this analysis are shown in Table 1. Mean age 
of participants at the time of scanning was 67±10 years 
in men and 63±9 years in women, with a mean study 
duration of 13.7±0.08 years since randomization. Dur-
ing DPPOS, 57% of nondiabetic metformin participants 
took ≥80% of the prescribed metformin dose and 70% 
took metformin in any amount compared with 1% of 
nondiabetic participants in the lifestyle and 3% in the 
placebo groups taking metformin prescribed outside 
the study. Mean years of metformin use in the met-
formin group was 9.6±4.6 years, whereas in the pla-
cebo and lifestyle groups, it was 1.7±2.9 and 1.3±2.5 
years, respectively. Overall, diabetes mellitus developed 
in 59% of the placebo group compared with 54% and 
51% in the metformin and lifestyle groups, respective-
ly, at the time of scanning, with the mean duration of 
diabetes mellitus being 5.4±5.3, 4.5±5.1, and 3.8±4.6 
years and mean hemoglobin A1c being 6.0±0.7%, 
5.9±0.6%, and 5.9±0.6% in the placebo, metformin, 
and lifestyle groups, respectively. The mean follow-up 
BMI was significantly lower in the metformin and life-
style groups compared with the placebo group in both 
sexes, whereas systolic BP was lower in the lifestyle 
group in men only. Statin use increased significantly 
over time in DPPOS to >50% of participants, greater in 
men than in women; this was not different across treat-
ment groups. The proportion of current smokers was 
low during the study, although a much higher propor-
tion had a history of cigarette smoking. tPA levels were 
lower in the metformin and lifestyle groups compared 
with the placebo group in both sexes, whereas CRP was 
lower and HDL-C was higher in the active treatment 
groups among women only.
CAC Severity and Presence

ment effects on the CAC score using our primary mea-
sure, CAC severity, derived from the logarithmically 
transformed CAC score ([log(CAC+1)]), as well as our

secondary measure, CAC presence (CAC >0). As shown 
in Table 2, CAC severity was significantly greater in men 
than in women (P<0.001). In men, CAC severity was 
significantly lower in the metformin than in the lifestyle 
group in unadjusted analyses and 41% lower in the 
metformin than placebo group after age adjustment. 
These effects persisted whether metformin group par-
ticipants were defined as ever having used metformin 
or as currently using metformin (data not shown). No 
effect of metformin to lower CAC severity was seen 
in women. Similarly, among men but not in women, 
the presence of CAC >0 was significantly lower in the 
metformin group than in the other 2 groups (10.7% 
lower versus placebo and 11.7% lower versus lifestyle), 
but this was not the case for the CAC >10 or CAC 
>100 categories (Figure 2). There were no differences 
in CAC prevalence by categories among the 3 treat-
ment groups. Differences in CAC severity but not CAC 
presence were observed between race/ethnic groups 
and by age categories, diabetes status, and statin use 
subgroups in both men and women (Table 2).
By age groups, both CAC severity and CAC >0 were 
significantly lower in the 25- to 44-year-old group 
among men in the metformin group versus the placebo 
group, with a tendency in this direction in the older 
age groups. CAC severity was significantly higher in the 
lifestyle than the placebo group among women in the 
25- to 44-year-old group. CAC severity and presence 
among men in the metformin group tended to be low-
er in both those with and without diabetes mellitus and 
in all race/ethnic subgroups, although this did not reach 
significance (except for CAC >0 in those without dia-
betes mellitus). Among women, there was an interac-
tion between diabetes status and treatment group for 
CAC severity (P=0.04). CAC severity was higher among 
statin users in both men and women.
Baseline age, systolic BP
, estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate (inversely), and non–HDL-C correlated with CAC 
severity in men and women and in all 3 treatment groups, 
as did mean systolic BP and estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate during follow-up, but there was no relationship 
with hemoglobin A1c levels and only weak associations 
with BMI, HDL-C, tPA, and CRP (Figure 3A and 3B).
Models Adjusted for Demographic 
and CVD Risk Factors, Diabetes Status 
and Duration, and the Effects of 
Interventions on CAC Severity Stratified 
by Sex 
To determine whether the lower CAC severity in men 
with metformin could be accounted for by demograph-
ic or cardiovascular risk factors or by diabetes develop-
ment, their effects were examined in a series of multi-
variate models stratified by sex, comparing CAC severity 
in the metformin group with CAC severity in the placebo 
or lifestyle group (Figure 4). After adjustment for age, 
the lower CAC severity in men in the metformin versus 
placebo group (Figure 4, top left) was not attenuated 
by controlling for differences in race/ethnicity, baseline 
and follow-up risk factors, or diabetes status. Compared 
with men in the lifestyle group (Figure 4, bottom left), 
CAC severity was also lower in the metformin group in 
the unadjusted model but with little change in the point 
estimate in all adjusted models.

DISCUSSION
We evaluated the effect of lifestyle intervention and 
metformin on CAC severity and presence in the long-
term DPP/DPPOS. The major findings in this analysis 
are that in men but not in women, CAC severity and 
presence were lower in the metformin group compared 
with the placebo group, with a similar tendency in the 
metformin versus the lifestyle group. A tendency to-
ward lower CAC in the men of the metformin group 
was also evident in race/ethnicity and age subgroups 
and was most prominent in younger men; these factors 
did not attenuate the effect of metformin in multivari-
ate analysis. There were no CAC differences between 
the lifestyle and placebo groups.
This study evaluated CAC cross-sectionally an aver-
age of 13 to 14 years after baseline randomization 
and suggests that compared with placebo, metformin 
treatment may have reduced early stages of plaque 
development in men. Notably, there was also a higher 
prevalence of CAC in this cohort than has been re-
ported in other population studies such as the Multi-
Ethnic Study of Subclinical Atherosclerosis. Possible 
explanations include the lower proportion of DPP 
subjects from minority race/ethnic groups (who have 
a lower prevalence of CAC compared with whites) 
and the higher prevalence of DPP participants with 
metabolic syndrome (which has been shown to be 
associated with higher CAC) than without this syn-
drome.16,17
Metformin has been demonstrated to reduce CHD 
events compared with diet18 and sulfonylurea treat-
ments19 and compared with placebo in insulin-treated 
subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.20 This is the first 
demonstration that metformin may have a beneficial 
effect on coronary atherosclerosis in a prediabetic pop-
ulation. Recently, a 1-year treatment program using 
metformin in subjects with HIV infection and metabolic 
syndrome demonstrated reduce CAC progression with 
metformin compared with placebo.21 In contrast, met-
formin treatment had no effect on carotid intima-media 
thickness in the latter study or in a larger study of non-
diabetic patients with CHD,22 raising the possibility that 
coronary calcification may be a more sensitive marker 
of a metformin effect on atherosclerosis than is carotid 
intima-media thickness.
The mechanisms for protective effects of metfor-
min on atherosclerotic vascular disease are not well 
understood. In addition to its antihyperglycemic ac-
tion, metformin has been shown to improve endo-
thelial function23 and to favorably alter the lipid pro-
file,24 as well as lowering markers of inflammation 
and procoagulation.6 Although we observed associa-
tions between CAC and baseline non–HDL-C, systolic 
BP, estimated glomerular filtration rate, CRP, tPA, and 
HDL-C, adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors did 
not account for the effect of metformin on CAC in 
men. Our present findings could reflect other effects 
of metformin on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, 
perhaps directly on the vessel wall. Recently, evidence 
for direct antiatherogenic actions of metformin in-
volving adenosine monophosphate-activated protein 
kinase–mediated inhibition of monocyte-to-macro-
phage differentiation,25 inhibition of vascular senes-
cence, and downregulation of angiotensin II type 1 
receptors has been demonstrated in experimental 
models.26 In addition, metformin has been shown 
to inhibit vascular calcification in rat smooth muscle 
cells.27
The sex difference in the effect of metformin on CAC 
that we observed has not been reported in studies of 
the preclinical or clinical effects of metformin on CVD. 
CAC severity was considerably lower in women than 
in men in our study, making it more difficult to identify 
an effect of metformin in women. On the other hand, 
more than half of the women had measurable CAC, 
yet there was no suggestion of an effect of metformin 
on CAC presence in women. At entry into the study, 
36% of women were premenopausal. Atherogenesis 
proceeds more slowly in premenopausal women, espe-
cially in those who remain without diabetes mellitus, 
which might have contributed to the lack of effect of 
metformin in women. However, we were not able to 
detect an effect of metformin on the basis of a strati-
fication of the female population into those ≥45 com-
pared with <45 years of age at randomization (data 
not shown). Intriguingly, a similar sex dimorphism has 
previously been seen in DPP in terms of the prevention 
of metabolic syndrome28 wherein metformin had a pro-
found effect in men (P=0.002) yet no effect in women 
(P>0.20). This raises the possibility of hormonal interac-

tions; for example, it has been shown that metformin 
reduces testosterone levels in men29 but not women.30
It was notable that there was no reduction in the 
prevalence of clinically significant CAC, for example, 
CAC>100, among men in the metformin compared 
with the placebo group. That is, the effect of metfor-
min on CAC was most evident in those with lower CAC 
scores. Although lower CAC scores are more suscepti-
ble to obesity-associated scanning artifacts, CAC scores 
at the lower end of the range are associated with a 
significant increase in the CHD event rate.31 These find-
ings could imply that the effect of metformin involves 
smaller and more recently calcifying plaques rather 
than well-established lesions. This is supported by the 
observation that the most prominent difference in CAC 
severity or presence was found in younger men, who 
would be expected to have atherosclerotic lesions ear-
lier in their development than older men. Whether this 
means that metformin would have less clinical efficacy 
in older men must await testing of the effect of metfor-
min on clinical outcomes.
It was also of interest to find that lower CAC in the 
metformin group was evident regardless of whether 
diabetes mellitus had developed. Although metformin 
has a durable effect to delay diabetes development and 
its use in prediabetes has been endorsed by the Ameri-
can Diabetes Association,32 it is unknown whether the 
use of metformin before the development of diabetes 
mellitus has benefit for vascular complications. The 
present findings provide initial evidence that metformin 
may have a favorable effect on atherosclerosis both in 
the prediabetes phase and in the early period after the 
development of diabetes mellitus in men, suggesting 
that the effect of metformin on CAC in men does not

The treatment effects are stratified by sex along the columns, displayed along the rows, and expressed as geometric mean 
ratio of metformin compared with placebo and metformin compared with lifestyle. The geometric mean ratio is calculated 
by taking the antilog of the treatment effect coefficient obtained from the Tobit regression model with ln(CAC+1) as the 
outcome. Adjustments to the treatment effects are sequentially modeled as defined below. Baseline risk factors (RFs) include 
family history of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD), body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), log normal albumin/
creatinine ratio (ACR), non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL-C), HDL-C, systolic blood pressure (SBP), estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), and log normal C-reactive 
protein (CRP), and ever-smoker status. RFs during follow-up include mean levels for BMI, HbA1c, ln(ACR), non–HDL-C, BMI,

depend on diabetes prevention. In this regard, it should 
be noted that the eligibility for DPP required both im-
paired glucose tolerance and a fasting glucose >95 mg/
dL, which would have excluded prediabetic subjects 
with milder degrees of dysglycemia. Therefore, these 
findings cannot be generalized to all subjects with pre-
diabetes. Overall, 54% of the DPP/DPPOS cohort had 
developed diabetes mellitus at the time of scanning, 
but despite the presence of only modest hyperglyce-
mia and a relatively short diabetes duration, we found 
that CAC severity was increased in those who devel-
oped diabetes mellitus compared with those who did 
not. Incident diabetes mellitus was identified in the 
DPP/DPPOS study by semiannual testing, which allows 
for a narrow definition of the timing of its biochemical 
onset and suggests that progression of dysglycemia to 
diabetes mellitus influences atherosclerosis. Taken to-
gether, these findings support the notion that the use 
of metformin within a few years before or after diabe-
tes development has a beneficial effect on early stages 
of atherosclerosis in men.
The absence of an effect of lifestyle intervention 
on CAC in the face of the metformin finding is some-
what surprising because the lifestyle group experienced 
more significant reductions in the development of dys-
lipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome and 
a greater lowering of CRP levels than the metformin 
group.6,28,33 Furthermore, lifestyle change had a greater 
long-term effect on diabetes prevention than metfor-
min treatment during the first 10 years of follow-up.33 
Our findings extend those reported in a shorter 1-year 
Mediterranean diet intervention trial with a 3-year fol-
low-up in a small study of subjects with CHD that found 
no effect on CAC progression.34 Our findings are not 
concordant with the results of the Da Qing Diabetes 
Prevention Study, which found a significant reduction 
in mortality that was due largely to reduced CVD in the 
lifestyle intervention compared with the control group 
after 23 years of follow-up. However, this observation 
was seen in women but not men, and there were asym-
metrical losses to follow-up and differences in age and 
smoking behavior between the 2 intervention groups.35 
It remains possible that there may be long-term effects 
on CVD outcomes with lifestyle intervention that are 
not reflected by its effect on CAC measured 10 to 13 
years after randomization. One important difference 
between metformin and lifestyle in the DPP/DPPOS 
is the intensity of exposure over the period of obser-
vation. Metformin treatment was consistently used 
throughout the entire follow-up period, whereas the 
intensive period of lifestyle intervention averaged only 
3.2 years, after which the net exposure was reduced, 
leading to reduced efficacy as measured by a diminu-
tion of weight loss.
Medication use might also have confounded these 
observations. During the post-DPP time period, lipid-
lowering therapy and antihypertensive therapy were in-
creasingly prescribed in all treatment groups, and at the 
time of the CAC scan, lipid-lowering medications were 
used by 58% and antihypertensive medications by 67% 
of the entire cohort. These factors may have limited or 
obscured a beneficial effect of the lifestyle intervention 
on CAC. Indeed, as others have shown, we found that 
CAC severity (total plaque burden) was greater in statin 
users than nonusers in all treatment groups, and it has 
been suggested that statin use may be associated with 
plaque stabilization.36 Nevertheless, CAC severity was 
lower in men in the metformin group despite the pos-
sible confounding effects of lipid-lowering and antihy-
pertensive therapies and was in fact less prevalent in 
men taking statin medications in the metformin group. 
These observations suggest that metformin may slow 
or delay atherosclerosis independently of the effect of 
modern cardioprevention strategies in these subjects.
There are several limitations to this study. First, 
although metformin treatment was almost exclusive 
to the metformin intervention group, small numbers 
of participants from the other 2 intervention groups 
were taking out-of-study metformin. Second, the na-
ture of the lifestyle intervention in the 3 treatment 
groups changed in the transition from DPP to DPPOS. 
Third, the study cohort was selected on the basis of 
glucose and body weight entry criteria, and those 
weighing >350 lb were excluded, so the results can-
not be generalized to the entire prediabetic popula-
tion. Finally, because CAC was measured only once 
at year 14, it was not possible to directly measure 
the effect of our interventions on CAC over time. 
Interpretation of the effect of the interventions was 
therefore based on the assumption that there were 
no differences in baseline CAC given the randomiza-
tion of subjects into intervention groups at baseline. 
We found no differences in cardiometabolic risk fac-
tors at baseline between treatment groups except 
for slightly lower HDL-C and higher smoking rates in 
women in the placebo group only.
CONCLUSIONS
These findings add support to the evidence base that 
metformin may protect against atherosclerotic vascular 
disease early in diabetes development and potentially 
extend the range of this action to include high-risk male 
prediabetic subjects. Whether these findings translate 
into beneficial effects on CVD events will require ongo-
ing follow-up.
