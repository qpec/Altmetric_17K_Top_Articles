Introduction
Auditory verbal hallucinations, which are typically of a 
derogatory and threatening nature, are reported by 
approximately 60–70% of people with schizophrenia.3 
Although pharmacological therapy is effective at reducing 
hallucinations in many people, approximately 25% of 
people with psychotic conditions continue to experience 
them.4 Cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis is also 
helpful for many people, although average effect sizes are 
in the small to moderate range,2 and training and resource 
requirements mean that, in practice, therapy is delivered 
to only a fraction of those who might benefit.5 Consequently, 
there is considerable interest in the development of novel 
therapies that draw on the principles of cognitive 
behavioural therapy for psychosis but which are shorter, 
specifically targeted at auditory verbal hallucinations, and 
are capable of being delivered by a wider workforce.
Several novel therapies build on the perspective that 
auditory verbal hallucinations are experienced as coming 
from entities that have personal identities, speak with 
purpose, and with whom the hearer establishes a 
personal relationship. The operation of power within this 
relationship is viewed as crucial.6,7 The voice is typically 
experienced as dominant (even omnipotent), with the 
voice-hearer assuming a submissive role characterised 
by feelings of inferiority and powerlessness that can 
reflect social relationships more generally.8 In light of 
this finding, explicitly relational and interpersonal 
approaches have been developed that locate voices (and 
voice relationships) within the person’s biographical 
context9 and target key interpersonal dimensions such as 
power and proximity.1,7
AVATAR therapy belongs to this new wave of relational 
approaches but, uniquely, the voice-hearer’s experiences

with psychosis: a single-blind, randomised controlled trial

Summary
Background A quarter of people with psychotic conditions experience persistent auditory verbal hallucinations, despite 
treatment. AVATAR therapy (invented by Julian Leff in 2008) is a new approach in which people who hear voices have 
a dialogue with a digital representation (avatar) of their presumed persecutor, voiced by the therapist so that the avatar 
responds by becoming less hostile and concedes power over the course of therapy. We aimed to investigate the effect 
of AVATAR therapy on auditory verbal hallucinations, compared with a supportive counselling control condition.
Methods We did this single-blind, randomised controlled trial at a single clinical location (South London and Maudsley 
NHS Trust). Participants were aged 18 to 65 years, had a clinical diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum (ICD10 F20–29) 
or affective disorder (F30–39 with psychotic symptoms), and had enduring auditory verbal hallucinations during the 
previous 12 months, despite continued treatment. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive AVATAR 
therapy or supportive counselling with randomised permuted blocks (block size randomly varying between two and 
six). Assessments were done at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks, by research assessors who were masked to therapy 
allocation. The primary outcome was reduction in auditory verbal hallucinations at 12 weeks, measured by total score 
on the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scales Auditory Hallucinations (PSYRATS–AH). Analysis was by intention-to-
treat with linear mixed models. The trial was prospectively registered with the ISRCTN registry, number 65314790.
Findings Between Nov 1, 2013, and Jan 28, 2016, 394 people were referred to the study, of whom 369 were assessed 
for eligibility. Of these people, 150 were eligible and were randomly assigned to receive either AVATAR therapy (n=75) 
or supportive counselling (n=75). 124 (83%) met the primary outcome. The reduction in PSYRATS–AH total score 
at 12 weeks was significantly greater for AVATAR therapy than for supportive counselling (mean difference 
–3·82 [SE 1·47], 95% CI –6·70 to –0·94; p<0·0093). There was no evidence of any adverse events attributable to either 
therapy.
Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first powered, randomised controlled trial of AVATAR therapy. This brief, 
targeted therapy was more effective after 12 weeks of treatment than was supportive counselling in reducing the 
severity of persistent auditory verbal hallucinations, with a large effect size. Future multi-centre studies are needed to 
establish the effectiveness of AVATAR therapy and, if proven effective, we think it should become an option in the 
psychological treatment of auditory verbal hallucinations.

are brought into therapy in a new way, allowing a face-to-
face interaction with a digital representation (avatar) 
whose speech closely matches the pitch and tone of the 
persecutory voice. The therapist (switching between 
speaking as therapist and as avatar) facilitates a dialogue 
in which the voice-hearer gradually gains increased 
power and control within the relationship, with the 
initially omnipotent voice loosening its grip over the 
hearer by becoming more conciliatory over time.
A pilot study10 that compared AVATAR therapy with a 
treatment as usual in 26 patients who had a longstanding 
single or dominant persecutory voice found significant 
reductions in the frequency, distress, omni 
potence, and 
malevolence of the voice. We report the results of a larger, 
randomised controlled trial11 that compared AVATAR 
therapy with an augmented supportive counselling 
intervention. There were three objectives: to test the 
clinical efficacy of AVATAR therapy compared with 
supportive 
counselling, 
to 
explore 
explanatory 
mechanisms of action and moderators for AVATAR 
therapy, and to determine preliminary estimates of cost-
effectiveness of AVATAR therapy.
This paper addresses the primary objective—to test 
clinical efficacy—with the following hypotheses: AVATAR 
therapy will be more effective in reducing the frequency 
and severity of auditory verbal hallucinations, by com-
parison with supportive counselling, at 12 weeks; 
AVATAR therapy will be more effective in reducing the 
reported omnipotence and malevolence of auditory 
verbal hallucinations, by comparison with supportive 
counselling, at 12 weeks; and the improvements 
attributable to AVATAR therapy will be maintained at 
24 weeks follow-up. The other two objectives will be 
addressed in subsequent publications.
Methods
Study design and participants
The study was a single-blind, randomised controlled trial 
done in the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust. 
Potential participants were referred to the study by their 
treating clinician in routine clinical service. All referrals 
were screened for eligibility against the following inclusion 
criteria: 
having 
had 
distressing 
auditory 
verbal 
hallucinations for at least 12 months in the context of a 
diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (ICD-10 
F20–29) or affective disorder with psychotic symptoms 
(ICD-10 F30–39 subcategories with psychotic symptoms), 
currently a patient of NHS psychiatric services, older than 
18 years, and able to speak and read English. All participants 
had been taking antipsychotic medication before the trial 
but their auditory verbal hallucinations had been 
unresponsive or only partially responsive to previous 
treatment. Participants were excluded if they were unable 
to give informed written consent; were currently receiving 
psychological therapy for psychosis, including attending 
so-called hearing voices groups; were refusing medication; 
had a diagnosis of organic brain disease, learning disability, 
or primary substance dependency; and heard voices in a 
language not spoken by the therapists. All participants 
gave written informed consent.
The study was approved by the London-Hampstead 
Research Ethics Committee (reference 13/Lo/0482). 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The previous pilot study that prompted this randomised 
controlled trial was unique in the use of specific digital 
technology to enable a trialogue between therapist, patient, 
and a simulation of the auditory hallucination experienced by 
the patient. We searched Medline, PubMed, and PsychInfo 
databases for articles published in English between Jan 1, 1950, 
and June 30, 2017, with search terms “auditory hallucinations”, 
“voices”, “psychosis”, “schizophrenia”, AND “psychological 
therapy”, “CBT”, and “voice dialogue”. We also reviewed 
published meta-analyses of cognitive behaviour therapy for 
hallucinations. As we expected, there is substantial literature in 
which assessment of auditory hallucinations have been 
reported as one component of a wider therapy, typically with 
small to moderate effect sizes. In addition to the pilot study of 
AVATAR therapy, there were two other specifically relational 
approaches to distressing voices: voice dialogue, which to date 
has been reported as single cases, an ongoing case series, and a 
pilot controlled trial; and Relating Therapy for voices, which has 
shown a reduction of voice-related distress compared with 
treatment as usual. Neither use digital representations of 
patient experiences in therapy.
Added value of this study
We corroborated the results of the earlier pilot study in a larger, 
powered, randomised controlled trial comparing AVATAR 
therapy with an augmented supportive counselling control 
condition. The effect size on our primary outcome is greater 
than that reported by meta-analyses of cognitive behaviour 
therapy for psychosis.
Implications of all the available evidence
Traditional cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis is a 
lengthy therapy that is delivered by highly trained therapists 
and is, consequently, a scarce resource, which achieves small 
to moderate effects on auditory verbal hallucinations. Results 
from our study suggest a benefit for briefer therapies that 
employ digital representations of voices in dialogue and are 
focused on specific target processes, which could be 
incorporated within a broader therapy (such as cognitive 
behaviour therapy for psychosis) or offered 
as a standalone approach.

The trial protocol has been published elswhere.11 The 
study was overseen by an independent trial steering 
committee and a separate Data Monitoring and Ethics 
Committee.
Randomisation and masking
All participants continued to receive standard psychiatric 
care, with the agreement that existing medication was to 
remain unchanged over the duration of the trial unless 
otherwise determined by clinical need. Participants were 
randomly assigned (1:1) to receive AVATAR therapy or 
supportive counselling with randomised permuted 
blocks (block size randomly varying between two and 
six). Randomisation was done on completion of baseline 
assessments through an independent web-based service 
provided by the UKCRC Registered Clinical Trials Unit at 
King’s College London (registration number 053) to 
maintain allocation concealment. Participants were 
informed of their allocation by a therapist.
All assessments were done by research assessors who 
were masked to therapy allocation. To avoid unmasking, 
we ensured that assessors did not have access to clinical 
records after the baseline (pre-randomisation) assessment 
or access to the therapy database at any stage, that all 
assessments were done at sites remote from the clinic, and 
that participants were reminded before each assessment 
not to disclose their allocation. 
Procedures
Therapy in both groups was provided at a single clinical 
location. AVATAR therapy was delivered by experienced 
clinicians 
skilled 
in 
psychological 
therapies. 
Participants first created a computerised representation 
of the entity that they believed was the source of their 
main voice. After completing the set-up of the avatar in 
an 
intro 
ductory 
session, 
which 
included 
a 
comprehensive assess 
ment of the voice(s) and included 
verbatim content, the therapy was delivered over 
six weekly 50-min sessions. 10–15 min of each session 
involved face-to-face work with the avatar, wherein the 
therapist facilitated a direct dialogue between the 
participant and the avatar. Participants sat in one room 
facing their avatar on a computer monitor. The therapist 
sat in a second room with a control panel that allowed 
them to speak in his or her own voice, or as the avatar. 
A video link allowed the therapist to see and hear the 
participant’s responses, enabling them to adjust 
therapeutic interventions and modify the avatar 
interaction according to the unfolding dialogue. The 
progress of sessions was determined by a discussion in 
each session concerning any change in severity, 
malevolence, or frequency of the voices. All sessions 
were audio recorded and a copy of the avatar dialogue 
was provided on an MP3 player to the participant with 
instructions to listen to the recording at home, 
especially when they heard the voice(s). The content of 
the sessions has been described elsewhere.12 Briefly, 
therapy proceeds through two phases. Phase one 
(typically sessions one to three) involved exposure to 
the avatar speaking the typical verbatim content of the 
participant’s voices while the therapist encouraged 
assertive respon 
ding—eg, that the person tell the avatar 
that they are no longer prepared to accept these threats 
and 
insults 
and 
to 
challenge 
any 
apparent 
misconceptions the avatar seems to have. In phase two 
(typically sessions four to six), the dialogue gradually 
evolved 
as 
the 
avatar 
conceded 
ground 
and 
acknowledged the strengths and good qualities of the 
participant. There is an explicit focus on self-esteem 
and acknowledgments of the participant’s strengths 
and capabilities.
Therapists used a detailed therapy manual written for 
the trial by the team, developed from an earlier brief

guide provided by JPL, who also provided initial training 
and consultation through periodic attendance at weekly 
group supervision meetings. The complete audiotaped 
clinical record of 64 sessions across a random selection 
of 12 participants (including discussions before and after 
active dialogue) was rated by JPL against a 25-item scale 
developed to assess adherence to the manualised 
approach and skill in delivery.
The control condition, supportive counselling, was 
delivered by graduate assistant psychologists who were 
recruited on the basis of extensive experience of working 
therapeutically in a psychosis context. They were trained 
and closely supervised throughout by the therapy co-
ordinator (TW). The intervention comprised a manual-
based, face-to-face supportive counselling approach 
adapted with permission from that employed by the 
SoCRATES Trial Group.13 Whereas the inherited manual 
proposed activities such as board games and listening to 
music together, we wanted to provide more than a simple 
attention or time control and augmented the manual to 
deliver an emotion-focused psychological intervention 
that facilitated exploration of issues of fundamental 
importance in the person’s life, in the context of an 
empathic, non-directive therapeutic relationship.14 At the 
same time, we wanted to avoid the interpersonal 
treatment targets of AVATAR therapy (ie, shift in power 
or control in the relationship with the voice[s])
Typical themes of counselling included improving 
quality of life, issues of identity or belonging, coming to 
terms with past trauma, and identifying personal 
resources and qualities. Counselling was delivered over 
the same number and duration of sessions as AVATAR 
therapy. At the end of each session, participants recorded 
a weekly positive message onto an MP3 player to listen 
back to during the week (matching the use of MP3 
recordings in the AVATAR therapy group).
An 
independent 
counselling 
psychologist 
rated 
67 sessions across 14 participants for fidelity to the 
manual and evidence of key therapeutic processes, using 
core items of the counselling adherence scale.15 For the 
counselling adherence scale, there are seven items, 
scored 0 (no evidence) to 4 (very good evidence).
At the end of therapy, participants in both groups were 
given a therapy summary letter and a copy of this was 
sent to their responsible clinician in routine care. No 
attempt was made to intervene or monitor participants 
between the end of therapy and the assessment points.
Discontinuation of therapy from either group was 
defined by one or more of the following criteria: non-
attendance at three consecutive sessions, the participant 
decided to discontinue, or discontinuation recommended 
by the therapist or peer supervision group. Following the 
protocol, therapy could also be terminated if the 
participant reported complete absence of any voices for 
at least three consecutive sessions. The total number of 
sessions could also be extended by up to three sessions 
when there was a rationale for probable benefit, agreed 
by therapy team consensus.
Audiotaped assessments were carried out by trained 
research staff at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after 
randomisation. We assessed inter-rater reliability using 
intra-class correlations, two-way mixed-effects model, and 
absolute agreement type for the main outcome measure in 
25 (20%) of 125 interviews. We calculated indices for each 
of the items and total score of this scale.

Outcomes
The prespecified primary outcome was the total score 
(0–44) on the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales, auditory 
hallucinations subscale (PSYRATS–AH16) at 12 weeks.
The secondary outcome measures of voices were 
dimensional subscales of the PSYRATS-AH:17 voice 
frequency (frequency, duration, and disruption items) 
and voice distress (negative content, distress, and control 
items), Revised Beliefs about Voices Questionnaire18 
(BAVQ-R; perceived malevolence, omnipotence, and 
benevolence subscales), the Voice Acceptance and Action 
Scale19 (VAAS; acceptance and action subscales), Voice 
Power 
Differential 
Scale20 
(VPDS; 
power 
and 
assertiveness subscales).
The other secondary outcomes measures were scores 
for the Scale for Assessment of Positive and Negative 
Symptoms21 (SAPS and SANS), Psychotic Symptoms 
Rating Scale–Delusions16 (PSYRATS-DEL), Depression 
Anxiety and Stress Scale22 (DASS-21), Calgary Depression 
Scale,23 Rosenberg self-esteem,24 Manchester Short 
Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA),25 and the 
Maudsley Addiction Profile (MAP).26
Information about possible adverse events was 
monitored for the duration of the study, up to week 24 of 
follow-up. Possible adverse events included hospital 
admissions (due to physical or mental health deter-
ioration), crisis team involvement, self-harming be-
haviour and suicide attempts, and violent incidents 
necessitating police involvement (whether the participant 
was victim or perpetrator). All adverse events were 
reported to the trial steering, data monitoring and ethics, 
and research ethics committees.
We paid close attention to the occurrence of any adverse 
events that might be attributed to either therapy, including 
whether the AVATAR therapy sessions were followed by 
any therapy-specific issues such as seeing the avatar outside 
of the sessions. Therapy was to be terminated in the event 
of any evidence of therapy being associated with significant 
increased distress, risk of harm to self or others, or both.
Statistical analysis
We planned to enrol 142 participants. In the pilot study10 
there was a clinically meaningful five-point greater change 
in the total PSYRATS–AH score, favouring the AVATAR 
condition with an effect size (Cohen’s d) of approximately 
0·8. Supportive therapy typically achieves a modest effect 
of d=0·2. On the assumption that a replication study 
might be expected to achieve broadly similar results, we 
calculated that a sample size of 71 in each group would 
have 90% power to detect a net effect size of 0·6, using a 
two-group t-test with a 0·05 two-sided significance level, 
while also allowing for a 20% loss to  follow-up.
We did the statistical analysis with Stata (version 14.1). 
We report on all outcomes related to our primary 
(efficacy) objective, as specified in our published protocol 
and statistical analysis plan, and as agreed with the data 
monitoring and ethics committee before any analysis 
was done. All analyses used the original randomised 
groups, including participants with observed outcome 
data. Descriptive statistics within each randomised 
group are presented for baseline values, including 
counts and percentages for binary and categorical 
variables and means and SDs for continuous variables

and counts of missing values. No statistical tests were 
done on baseline measures. 
We analysed the primary outcome (PSYRATS–AH total 
score at 12 weeks) using a linear mixed-effects model 
allowing for the baseline measurement of PSYRATS–AH 
and randomisation as fixed effects. Because of the nested 
trial design, we used mixed models to include a random 
intercept for each therapist in the two randomised 
groups, allowing for differential clustering by group. We 
analysed secondary outcome measures using the same 
modelling approach. We also analysed the primary and 
secondary outcomes at 24 weeks using mixed models. 
We examined if baseline factors were associated with 
missing outcomes using logistic regression, and no 
significant predictors were present once baseline scores 
and randomised group were accounted for.
In the event that a participant reported a complete 
absence of auditory verbal hallucinations for the entire 
week at either 12 or 24 weeks, the best possible score was 
imputed for BAVQ-R, VAAS, and VPDS scales, which 
cannot be used in the absence of auditory verbal 
hallucinations. Missing data on other measures were 
pro-rated if more than 90% of the total items were 
completed, otherwise the measure was considered as 
missing. We used logistic regression to examine if base-
line factors were associated with missing outcomes, and 
no significant predictors were present once baseline 
scores and randomised group were accounted for.
The trial was prospectively registered with the ISRCTN 
registry, number 65314790.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data, 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The funder reviewed and approved the 
application for the trial. RE had full access to all the data 
in the study and the corresponding author had final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Between Nov 1, 2013, and Jan 28, 2016, there were 
394 referrals to the study (figure 1). 25 were excluded 
before eligibility screening because they could not be 
contacted or refused to meet the researcher for screening. 
We assessed 369 participants, of whom 150 were eligible 
and gave informed consent. Participants were randomly 
assigned to AVATAR therapy (n=75) or supportive 
counselling (n=75; figure 1). Reasons for participant 
exclusion at eligibility assessment were: not providing 
consent (n=50); not meeting diagnostic criteria (n=29); not 
hearing distressing voices, hearing voices for less than 
12 months, or reporting voices not speaking in English 
(n=85); being acutely unwell in hospital, not having the 
capacity to give consent, or both (n=28); and several other 
reasons (eg, severe physical ill health, pregnancy, and 
refusing to take medication; n=27). The majority of 
participants (n=369) were referred by secondary mental 
health services. 25 participants were self-referred in so far 
as they or a family member initiated contact with the 
research team. In all cases, acceptance into the study 
included the agreement of the participant’s responsible 
clinician, who provided clinical and risk information and 
agreed to be contacted regarding any deterioration in

mental state. Attrition was within the prespecified target of 
20% for the primary outcome at 12 weeks: 63 (84%) of 75 in 
the AVATAR group and 61 (81%) of 75 in the supportive 
counselling group completed assessments (figure 1). At 
24 weeks, 57 (76%) participants in the AVATAR group and 
58 (77%) in the supportive counselling group completed 
assessments of primary outcome measures (figure 1).
Unmasking occurred in 28 participants (18·6%), 14 in 
each study group. When unmasking occurred, subsequent 
assessments were done by a different researcher. 
Replacement was not possible in three of these 
28 participants (two participants refused to see any other 
researcher and one participant repeatedly unmasked the 
replacement researcher).
Overall, there was a greater proportion of men, the 
mean age was 42·7 years (SD 10·7), and approximately 
40% of participants in each group belonged to an ethnic 
minority population (table 1). Most participants were 
unemployed and the most common diagnosis was 
paranoid schizophrenia (table 1). Participants had an 
average length of illness of 20·1 years (SD 10·8) and all 
were prescribed antipsychotic medication before the 
trial, with more than a third prescribed clozapine. There 
was no difference at baseline or follow-up in the total 
dose of prescribed antipsychotic medication (olanzapine 
or chlorpromazine equivalents). The majority of 
participants (n=117 [78%]) reported hearing multiple 
voices (mean 3·6 [SD 3·5], range 1 to >20) and most 
identified the source as of human origin, though only a 
third said they thought they knew the person responsible.
Across both therapy groups, 1030 therapy sessions were 
offered to the participants. The average number of sessions 
attended was 5·6 (SD 2·8, range 0–10) for AVATAR therapy 
and 
5·1 
(3·1, 
0–10) 
for 
supportive 
counselling. 
103 participants completed a full course of therapy, with a 
further 27 discontinuing between sessions one and 
six (figure 1). Reasons for discontinuation varied and 
included logistical issues (time and distance to travel), 
physical health problems, or participants reporting that the 
approach was not relevant or helpful for them (in both 
groups). There were no cases in either group of therapists 
discontinuing therapy or treating clinicians requesting 
discontinuation because of concerns about adverse effects 
of therapy. 20 participants attended no sessions at all 
(five in the AVATAR group, 15 in the supportive counselling 
group). Rates of non-attendance were 23% for supportive 
counselling and 15% for AVATAR therapy. Fidelity to the 
manualised approach and skill in delivery was high and 
did not differ between therapists, with an overall adherence 
to the manual with a mean score of 18·9 (SD 2·3) out of a 
maximum of 21 (range 15–21) and average skill rating of 
28·2 (SD 1·7) out of a maximum of 30 (range 25–30). The 
adherence to the supportive counselling manual was high, 
with an overall mean of 15·2 (SD 1·2) out of a maximum 
of 16. For the counselling adherence scale in which seven 
items are scored 0 (no evidence) to 4 (very good evidence), 
the mean was 21·8 (SD 1·9) out of a maximum of 28, 
which equates to a rating of greater than 3 (good evidence) 
across the seven items. Intra-class correlations for inter-
rater reliability ranged from 0·78 to 0·98, showing good to 
excellent agreement
Both the descriptive statistics (table 2) and the effect 
estimates (figure 2) show that at 12 weeks, AVATAR 
therapy led to significantly greater reductions in auditory 
hallucinations than did supportive counselling, as 
assessed by the PSYRATS–AH total score (estimated 
mean difference –3·82, SE 1·47, 95% CI –6·70 to –0·94; 
p=0·009; d=0·8). There were also significant differences 
in reported frequency of voices and reduced distress at 
12 weeks (table 2). The trajectories of the PSYRATS–AH 
measures over time for each group are shown in figure 3.
Nine participants reported a complete absence of 
voices during the preceding week at the week 12 
assessment (seven in the AVATAR therapy group and 2 in 
the supportive counselling group), and 14 participants 
reported an absence at 24 weeks (eight in the AVATAR 
group and six in the supportive counselling group).
At 12 weeks, there were significant differences in 
reductions in the secondary outcomes of perceived 
omnipotence of voices, as measured by BAVQ-R–
Omnipotence, VAAS–Acceptance, and VAAS–Action 
(table 2).

group were maintained (table 2; figure 3). The supportive 
counselling group, however, continued to improve such 
that there were no significant differences between the 
two groups by this point. No significant differences 
between the two groups were observed for any of the 
other secondary outcomes at either 12 or 24 weeks.
During 24 weeks, five participants in the AVATAR 
therapy group and seven in the supportive counselling 
were admitted to hospital, and one additional participant 
in each group required acute home treatment. Severe 
mental or physical health deterioration was observed in 
three participants (one in the AVATAR group and two in 
the supportive counselling group). Violent incidents 
were reported in the clinical records of five participants 
(three in the AVATAR therapy group and two in the 
supportive counselling group), and in one of these the 
participant was the victim. There were no recorded 
incidents of self-harm or suicide attempts. The 
independent data monitoring and ethics committee 
found none of the adverse events to be attributable to 
AVATAR therapy or supportive counselling.
Discussion
AVATAR therapy was feasible to deliver, acceptable to 
participants, and did not result in any adverse events that 
could be attributed to the therapy. The study corroborated 
the primary hypothesis concerning clinical efficacy by 
showing a rapid and sustained reduction in the severity of 
auditory verbal hallucinations by end of therapy at week 12 
that was significantly superior to that achieved by supportive 
counselling. The observed outcomes at week 12 were larger 
than expected, with a between-group effect size for the 
primary outcome of 0·8. This is a larger effect than the 
mean effect reported for voices by the most relevant recent 
meta-analysis of cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis 
(d=0·46),2 which is very likely to be an upper estimate given 
that it includes data from the earlier AVATAR pilot study,10 
and given that few trials of other psychological therapies for 
psychosis have included an active control condition. Our 
second and third hypotheses were also largely supported, 
in that AVATAR therapy had a positive and significant on 
omnipotence, and that these positive effects on voices were 
sustained at 24 weeks. However, it had no significant effect 
on the reported malevolence of voices.
It is important to note that the trial involves a 
sample of people suffering from persistent psychoses who 
reported unremitting and very distressing auditory 
hallucinations for at least the previous 12 months, despite 
regular supervision and continuing pharmacological 
treatment. More than a third of all patients across both 
therapy groups had a clinical record of treatment resistance 
and were prescribed clozapine before the start of the study. 
The average number of voices in people with psychosis 
ranges between 3·2 and 4·3 when uncountable numbers 
are excluded,27 a figure that is consistent with the average 
noted in our sample. In testing the therapy as an 
intervention that would have wide applications, we decided

not to pre-specify the number of voices, but instead to ask 
participants to select the voice that they most wished to 
influence, with our clinical impression being that positive 
changes can generalise from the target voice.
In terms of limitations, the absence of a treatment-as-
usual control condition com 
plicates interpretation of the 
absence of a significant difference between the two groups 
at 24 weeks. Although, as hypothesised, the large effect of 
AVATAR is maintained after therapy up to 24 weeks, 
participants who received supportive counselling show a 
small improvement after therapy, reducing the between-
group difference. There are two main possibilities to be 
considered. First, that the results reflect regression to the 
mean in both groups. We consider this to be unlikely, in 
that the participants were selected for persistent 
symptoms and were not recruited in crisis, thus the 
baseline state should be relatively stable without an 
intervention. This possibility would also not explain the 
more rapid improvement in the AVATAR therapy group. 
Of note in our study is the finding that, in both groups, 
improvements on the PSYRATS score at week 24 follow-
up were well in excess of the five-point change defined, a 
priori, as a clinically significant reduction,11 with a larger 
numerical change in the AVATAR therapy group than in 
the supportive counselling group.
However, although it was less rapidly effective, 
supportive counselling as delivered in this trial could 
probably also be beneficial for treatment of auditory 
hallucinations. Supportive counselling is a control 
condition with non-specific factors that, compared with 
no treatment, can be effective in its own right.28 There is 
evidence for a small positive effect for supportive 
counselling and befriending in psychosis, by contrast 
with smaller or zero effects of treatment as usual.29 When 
designing the supportive counselling intervention, we 
made every effort to ensure that this therapy was delivered 
competently, with close weekly supervision provided by 
the trial therapy coordinator, which included regular use 
of live recordings. Furthermore, supportive counselling 
in this trial went beyond a simple attentional control and 
addressed practical concerns about living with psychosis, 
finding ways to improve current quality of life, coming to 
terms with past trauma, and identifying personal 
resources and qualities. The scores of counselling 
competency delivered in the control group suggest that 
this therapy was delivered proficiently. Provision of 
audiotaped recordings of the best 10 min of each 
supportive counselling session and encouragement of 
participants to reflect on these recordings as an attempt 
to control for the homework element of AVATAR therapy 
went beyond what is usually provided in a therapist 
attention control, which is why we consider this to be an 
augmented form of supportive counselling. Whether 
comparisons of AVATAR and supportive counselling with 
treatment as usual would favour AVATAR cannot be 
addressed with this study. The issue of when best to 
compare new treatments with treatment as usual is 
discussed by Gold and colleagues,28 who come to the 
broad conclusion that this approach is most appropriate 
at early phase 2, and much larger, subsequent pragmatic 
trials with active controls are useful at an intermediate 
stage along this pathway. We originally considered a 
three-arm study but rejected it on the grounds of the 
resources required and the stage of AVATAR research. In 
future studies, different options for design and control 
conditions, including novel designs and how and whether 
to include a treatment-as-usual condition, should be 
carefully considered.28
Another limitation is the fact that the study was done 
in only one centre by skilled therapists with substantial 
expertise in the psychological treatment of psychosis, 
which limits generalisation to other centres or to delivery 
by a wider mental health workforce. At this stage, we also 
cannot be certain that the outcomes of AVATAR therapy 
would be superior to an equivalent relational therapy that 
did not have the added costs of audio-visual technology.
Given that AVATAR therapy was effective at the end of 
therapy but had less comparative benefit at follow-up, 
could the immediate effect of AVATAR therapy be 
enhanced by any changes in the therapy approach? As 
delivered, and following the original AVATAR pilot study, 
AVATAR therapy was a very brief and tightly focussed 
intervention. 
Longer-term 
benefits 
might 
require 
additional sessions or effectiveness might be increased by 
a higher dose (ie, a more intensive focus over longer than 
3–6 sessions) on potential effective mechanisms, such as 
increasing control and reducing perceived omnipotence. 
Even with a brief intervention such as AVATAR therapy, it 
would also be relevant to examine in future research the 
contribution of the different intervention components 
(eg, exposure and anxiety reduction, assertiveness and 
control, self-esteem, and trauma re-processing) to the 
reduction in auditory hallucinations.
How do the effects of AVATAR therapy compare with 
other therapies for auditory verbal hallucinations? To our 
knowledge, the AVATAR therapy effects on frequency 
and severity of auditory verbal hallucinations, as assessed 
by PSYRATS–AH, are stronger than more general 
cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis, as applied to 
voices.2 The COMMAND trial,7 one of the most successful 
trials for auditory verbal hallucinations to date, employed 
a more targeted cognitive behavioural therapy approach 
for command hallucinations, and showed sustained 
benefits for compliance with commands (the primary 
treatment target), although not on frequency or distress 
associated with the hallucinations (PSYRATS–AH) or 
omnipotence as measured by the BAVQ-R. However, the 
COMMAND trial involved a much longer-term therapy, 
delivered over 25 sessions and 9 months, with a different 
treatment goal and participant selection criteria, and 
where the comparator was treatment as usual rather than 
an active treatment control. A recently published pilot 
study of Relating Therapy1 has also reported encouraging 
preliminary results on reducing voice-related distress

when compared with treatment as usual.1 Like AVATAR 
therapy, Relating Therapy focuses on dialogue with 
voices and increasing assertiveness, albeit without a 
digital avatar, but differs in being of longer duration and 
with a stronger focus on wider social relationships.1
AVATAR therapy is a brief therapy for persistent, 
distressing voices that makes creative and novel use of 
digital representations of psychotic experiences to 
provide a controlled but realistic therapeutic encounter, 
enabling dialogue and change. In a rapid development, 
from an initial pilot to the first powered randomised 
controlled trial, AVATAR therapy has shown large, 
clinically worthwhile benefits for voice hearers. In future 
reports, 
we 
will 
examine 
secondary 
hypotheses 
concerning mediation and moderation of effects, heath 
economic analysis, the participant experience of the 
virtual reality aspects of the avatar (such as sense of 
presence), and processes of therapy delivery.
