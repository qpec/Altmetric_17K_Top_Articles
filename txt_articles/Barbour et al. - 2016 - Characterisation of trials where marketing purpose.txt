Abstract
Background: Analysis of trial documentation has revealed that some industry-funded trials may be done more for
marketing purposes than scientific endeavour. We aimed to define characteristics of drug trials that appear to be
influenced by marketing considerations and estimate their prevalence.
Methods: We examined reports of randomised controlled trials of drugs published in six general medical journals
in 2011. Six investigators independently reviewed all publications, characterising them as YES/MAYBE/NO suspected
marketing trials, and then met to reach consensus. Blinded researchers then extracted key trial characteristics.
We used blinded cluster analysis to determine if key variables could characterise the categories of trials (YES/
MAYBE/NO).
Results: 41/194 (21 %) trials were categorised as YES, 14 (7 %) as MAYBE, 139 (72 %) as NO. All YES and MAYBE trials
were funded by the manufacturer, compared with 37 % of NO trials (p < 0.001). A higher proportion of YES trials had
authors or contributors from the manufacturer involved in study design (83 % vs. 19 %), data analysis (85 % vs.15 %)
and reporting (81 % vs. 15 %) than NO trials (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between groups in the
median number of participants screened (p = 0.49), but the median number of centres recruiting participants was
higher for YES compared with NO trials (171 vs. 13, p < 0.001). YES trials were not more likely to use a surrogate (42 %
vs. 30 %; p = 0.38) or composite primary outcome measure (34 % vs. 19 %; p = 0.14) than NO trials. YES trials were often
better reported in terms of blinding, safety outcomes and adverse events than NO trials. YES trials more frequently
included speculation that might encourage clinicians to use the intervention outside of the study population
compared to NO trials (59 % vs.37 %, p = 0.03). Cluster analysis based on study characteristics did not identify
a clear variable structure that accurately characterised YES/MAYBE/NO trials.
Conclusions: We reached consensus that a fifth of drug trials published in the highest impact general
medical journals in 2011 had features that were suggestive of being designed for marketing purposes. Each
of the marketing trials appeared to have a unique combination of features reported in the journal
publications.

 Background
Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) are done to reduce un-
certainty over the efficacy and safety of an intervention
and should be designed in such a way that they yield as
much useful and unbiased information as possible from as
few participants and clinical events as is necessary. How-
ever, analysis of trial documentation has revealed that
some industry-funded drug trials may be done more for
marketing purposes than science [1]. Confidential internal
company documents have revealed drug trials designed,
or heavily influenced by, the marketing departments of
pharmaceutical companies [1, 2]. These trials have often
been referred to as marketing or seeding trials [3, 4].
Currently, there are few documented examples of mar-
keting trials. Nonetheless, there are reasons why marketing
trials should be of concern to patients and physicians. Not-
ably, the true research objectives – to promote the use of a
medical product – may not be clear to investigators and
communicated to participants. The features that suggest a
trial may be considered as marketing are, however, cur-
rently unclear. Vested interests, recruitment of investiga-
tors who are frequent prescribers of competing products;
disproportionally high payments given to investigators;
sponsorship by the company’s sales and marketing div-
ision; minimal requirements for data leading to poor data
quality and recruitment of a large number of centres have
all been suggested as features of a trial designed for mar-
keting purposes [3, 4].
Pharmaceutical companies funding, designing and con-
ducting drug trials have rational motives for establishing
and advertising evidence of product efficacy and safety in
order to increase prescribing of the drug during the win-
dow before patent expiration [1, 2]. Yet, the existence of
marketing trials, and their provenance is difficult to prove
in the absence of confidential internal company docu-
ments [1, 2]. Even less is known about their characteristics
and how marketing considerations may intrude on trials
of scientific and clinical value. Accordingly, the objective
of this descriptive study was to define the characteristics
of trials published in major medical journals that had fea-
tures suggestive of marketing trials to inform efforts to
better identify marketing considerations in trial design
and reporting.
Methods
Phase 1: estimating the prevalence of suspected
marketing-driven trials in leading general medical
journals
Scoping of marketing trial features
In order to reach a broad consensus on the characteris-
tics of a marketing trial, which have not previously been
defined, the study team met to share 24 examples of
published trials one or more of us suspected of being de-
signed partly for purposes of marketing. Based on this
discussion and features of confirmed marketing trials
[1–4] six characteristics of marketing-influenced trials
were proposed and agreed upon by raters: 1) a high level
of involvement of the product manufacturer in study de-
sign, 2) data analysis, 3) and reporting of the study, 4) re-
cruitment of small numbers of patients from numerous
study sites for a common disease when they could have
been recruited without difficulty from fewer sites, 5) mis-
leading abstracts that do not report clinically relevant
findings, and 6) conclusions that focus on secondary end-
points and surrogate markers.
Sample
We generated a list of all trials evaluating one or more
drug treatments published in 2011 in the top general med-
ical journals, based on Impact Factor (New England Jour-
nal of Medicine (NEJM), The Journal of the American
Medical Association (JAMA), Lancet, Annals of Internal
Medicine, PLOS Medicine, and The BMJ). We included hu-
man drug and vaccine RCTs (excluding single patient and
single arm trials). Papers describing subgroup analysis or
just trial follow up data were excluded. Trials of devices
were also excluded unless the device contained a drug e.g.
drug eluting stents. We also excluded all studies that expli-
citly stated they were phase I or dosing escalation studies,
but did not exclude phase II trials (or phase I studies that
did not explicitly state their phase).
Independent rating of trials
Six members of the study team (VB, FG, RL, DB, CH, JR)
independently rated included trials based on whether they
were suspected to be marketing trials (YES, NO, or
MAYBE). They did not use fixed criteria, but based their
decisions on the extent to which they each felt the six
characteristics of marketing-influenced trials described
above influenced the research reported. Raters were not
blinded to the journal, as successful blinding was not
achievable with a team so familiar with the differences in
journal formatting styles. One author [SS] then collated
the independent ratings.. Trials with ≥4 independent YES
ratings were categorised as suspected marketing trials (re-
ferred to as YES trials), whilst trials with ≥ 3 independent
NO ratings were classified as non-marketing trials (NO tri-
als). Trials with <3 NO and <4 Yes ratings were considered
to be possible marketing trials and a consensus meeting
was convened to discuss these in more depth. The initial
independent ratings were collated and presented to the
consensus group and then a consensus decision to assign a
YES/MAYBE/NO for each of these trials was reached
through discussion. VB and FG were excluded from rating
trials that were published in their own journals (PLOS
Medicine and The BMJ). For these trials, five ratings were
collated, not six, and trials with ≥ 4 independent NO rat-
ings were classified as non-marketing trials (NO trials).

 Phase 2: characterisation of suspected marketing trials
In the second phase we sought to extract key variables, in-
cluding basic information about the trials and independ-
ent assessments of their clinical relevance and quality to
see if suspected marketing trials share characteristics that
differentiate them from the other trials.
Data extraction
The study team developed a data extraction form (see
Additional file 1) to capture variables that might cat-
egorise a trial as suspected marketing or not. Three
members of the team (JR, VB, DB) and one independent
data extractor piloted the form for ease of completion. A
further eight independent data extractors were recruited
to undertake further data extraction. They were blinded
to our study objectives and the categorisation of the tri-
als and were given instructions for gathering specific
variables to encourage consistency. To assess clinical
relevance and trial quality of each included study we ex-
tracted data from the McMaster PLUS (Premium Litera-
tUre Service) database of scientifically robust studies [5].
Correspondence with editors
To gather further information to characterise these stud-
ies, and the degree to which marketing interests might
have influenced them, we wrote to the editors of the par-
ticipating journals where we suspected trials were mar-
keting (see Additional file 2). We asked editors if they
considered that they might partly be marketing trials
when they were being reviewed, and how their editorial
teams approach the possibility of marketing as a driver
in trials. To aid our understanding and inform our ana-
lysis we also asked for editors to share in confidence
copies of the anonymised peer review comments relating
to these articles.
Survey of authors
We emailed the corresponding author of all 194 trials to
invite them to complete a survey (see Additional file 3)
containing further questions about the design and con-
duct of the trials. We were transparent in explaining the
purpose of our study and included a link to our pub-
lished abstract presented at the Seventh International
Congress on Peer Review and Biomedical Publication
[6]. Non-responders were sent one email reminder.
Data analysis
Initial data was collated in an Excel spreadsheet by SS
and the analysis was performed using SPSS (version
18.0). We summarised data using proportions and used
Chi-square and Kruskal Wallis tests to make compari-
sons across the three chosen categories (YES/MAYBE/
NO). As the MAYBE trials were also suspected market-
ing trials we ran a sensitivity analysis to see if it made a
difference to the results if the MAYBE trials were com-
bined with the YES trials versus the NO trials. For this
sensitivity analysis (two categories only = YES/NO) we
used Chi-square and Mann Whitney U Tests.
To determine if the key variables extracted could cor-
rectly identify the three study categories (YES/MAYBE/
NO) RP carried out a cluster analysis in R (version
3.1.0). Briefly, these methods use all categorical and nu-
merical variables to determine a measure of ‘similarity’
between studies. Studies that have exactly the same
values for all variables will have highest similarity (typic-
ally = 1) and those with completely different values the
lowest (typically = 0). These similarities are then used to
determine how close studies and clusters of studies are
to each other hence defining membership to a selected
number of clusters. The ‘internal structure’ of these clus-
ters – tight groups within clusters and large differences
across clusters – can be used to determine if the data
show important differences between these studies – in our
case MARKETING vs. NOT-MARKETING. We used a
“gower” metric to account for a mixture of continuous
and categorical data and “partitioning around medoids”
(PAM - similar to k-means) to create the clusters [7]. The
number of clusters was set at 2, 3, 4 and 5 and silhouette
graphs were used to test for internal structure with values
of the average silhouette width above 0.5 required to de-
termine that at least a reasonable structure has been iden-
tified [8]. We also used dendrograms to explore how these
studies group and in particular looking for a clear separ-
ation between marketing and not-marketing trials in rela-
tion to combinations of the variables. All cluster analyses
were carried out blinded to the categorisation (YES/
MAYBE/NO), which were only used to define consistency
with membership allocation.
Ethics
We did not seek ethical approval for our study. The
main study did not involve humans and was mainly
documentary analysis so did not require ethical approval.
The only involvement of humans was the author survey.
Authors did not give consent to take part; participation
in the survey was considered an indication of consent.
Authors were free to ignore our request to provide add-
itional information about their studies.
Results
Figure 1 shows that we included 194 (referenced in
Additional file 4) of the 263 potential trials identified from
the search strategy. Of these, 150 (77 %) were from two
journals: NEJM (92) Lancet (58). Table 1 shows we cate-
gorised 41/194 (21 %) trials as YES, 14/194 (7 %) as
MAYBE, and 139/194 (72 %) as NO trials. All of the trials
published in The BMJ and PLOS Medicine received at
least 4 or 5 NO ratings from the 5 independent raters.

 Figure 2 shows that all of the 41 YES and 14 MAYBE
trials were funded by the manufacturer compared with
37 % (51/139) of the NO trials (p < 0.001, Table 2). YES/
MAYBE trials were more likely to have authors or con-
tributors from the manufacturer involved in the study
design, data analysis and reporting of trials than NO tri-
als (p < 0.001 for all three comparisons). In addition, for
YES/MAYBE trials, the manufacturer was significantly
(p < 0.001 for all three comparisons) more likely to have
control of the design of the study, data analysis and
reporting of the study.
YES/MAYBE trials were more likely to have at least one
author from the product manufacturer on the authorship
byline (p < 0.001) and at least one author with a declared
financial conflict of interest with the product manufac-
turer compared with the NO trials, p < 0.001 (Table 2).
YES/MAYBE trials were also more likely to report editor-
ial assistance with preparing the manuscript (e.g. the use
of professional writers or an indication of help with manu-
script preparation in the Acknowledgements section) than
NO trials, p = 0.001. There was no significant difference
between groups in the use of group authorship on the
byline (p = 0.70).
There was no significant difference between groups in
the median number of participants screened (p = 0.49), but
the median number of centres recruiting participants was
171 for YES trials and 74 for MAYBE trials compared with
13 for NO trials (Fig. 3 and Additional file 5), p < 0.001.
The median number of patients screened per study site
was 11 in YES trials, and 18 in MAYBE trials compared
with 112 in NO trials, (p < 0.001). The median number ran-
domised per centre was 9, 16 and 37 (p < 0.001), respect-
ively. However, the median number of months to recruit
patients was significantly less for YES trials (19 months)
compared
to

(24
months)
and

(32 months), p = 0.003. Of note, of the 194 trials several

 were missing basic information about the numbers of
patients screened (29 %), countries (12 %), and study
sites (9 %).
A higher proportion of YES trials (32 %) reported the
use of statistical imputation than NO trials (9 %) and
MAYBE trials (7 %), p = 0.001 (see Additional file 4).
YES trials were no more likely to use a surrogate primary
outcome measure (p = 0.38) or a composite primary out-
come measure (p = 0.14). However the Abstract’s conclu-
sions of YES trials (39 %) were more likely to focus on
surrogate outcomes (7 % MAYBE, 25 % NO; p = 0.05).
YES trials included speculation or generalised phrasing
59 % of the time that might encourage clinicians to use
the intervention outside of the study population compared
to 29 % for MAYBE and 37 % for NO trials (p = 0.03).
However, the last two results were affected if the MAYBE
trials were reclassified as YES (see Additional file 4).
Grouping the MAYBE trials with the YES trials and per-
forming a two group comparison did not alter substan-
tially the pattern of results for other outcomes.
A higher proportion of YES trials blinded clinicians
(83 % vs. 43 % MAYBE and 53 % NO, p = 0.03), re-
ported safety outcomes and adverse events in the Ab-
stract (83 % vs. 54 %, p < 0.001) and the main text of
the paper (100 % vs. 84 %, p = 0.006), than NO trials.
There was no difference in terms of type of trial picked
up in Evidence Updates (p = 0.36), nor in median
highest clinical relevance (p = 0.34) and newsworthiness
(p = 0.42) ratings.
In the cluster analysis we found no groupings that
could identify trials as marketing versus non-marketing
based on all the extracted variables (Figs. 4 and 5,
Table 3). Table 3 presents how the different trials in the
study were allocated assuming different number of
groups (to account for possible subgroups within the
YES/NO studies). Although when using only 2 or 3
groups most (36/41) of the YES trials were allocated to
Group 2, this group also included a high number of
NOs and MAYBEs. This is roughly equivalent to having
high sensitivity (88 % of YES trials allocated there) with
poor specificity. This performance did not improve by
increasing the number of groups. The best average sil-
houette width (measure of adequate clustering) was ob-
tained when selecting only two clusters, generating a
similarity score of 0.28 suggesting that no substantial
structure was identified.
Correspondence with editors and authors
We received a response from editors at all four journals
where YES trials were published. Editors did not agree that
marketing considerations had played a key part in any of
their published studies and noted to us the underlying im-
portance and novelty of the clinical research described by
the manuscripts. For reasons of confidentiality, none of

 the editors were willing to share peer reviewers’ reports or
any editorial notes on the decision making for these
manuscripts.
From the 194 survey invitations to corresponding au-
thors we received a delivery failure notice for 11 (6 %).
Of the 183 authors 55 (30 %) completed at least some of
the questionnaire. The response rate was higher for au-
thors of MAYBE (38 %) and NO (33 %) trials compared
with YES trials (18 %). Due to the low response rate we
are unable to draw firm conclusions from the data.
Discussion
Six clinical research experts and medical journal editors
proposed that 21 % of drug trials published in 2011 in
the leading general medical journals had characteristics
consistent with the aim of marketing the product. Use of
expert opinion is necessarily subjective and also open to
bias. Therefore our methods aimed to reduce this bias,
or at least to explore and make it explicit, and to better
classify what seemed to us to be the characteristics of
trials designed with marketing in mind. To achieve this
we used independent data extractors to try and identify
a consistent set of characteristics of marketing trials.
The proposed set of marketing trials were more likely to
be explicitly funded by the manufacturer, have authors
or contributors from the manufacturer involved in or in
control of the study design, data analysis and reporting
of trials. In addition, suspected marketing trials con-
tained speculation or generalised phrasing that might
encourage clinicians to use the intervention outside of
the study population.
There was an unavoidably circular aspect to our efforts,
since we started with the feeling that marketing was a
strong element of a number of trials and attempted to de-
fine the characteristics that contributed to that impres-
sion. Moreover, we could not define any groupings, based
on the extracted variables, which could delineate trials as
marketing. Furthermore, the reported methods of most of
the proposed marketing trials were high quality. Our pre-
conceptions, therefore, may have been biased by prior
knowledge of marketing or seeding studies. In effect, the
group of experts through consensus were able to identify
a group of suspected marketing trials, but this grouping
could not be validated, and remains open to experi-
menter’s bias: a subjective bias whereby the result is
overtly influenced by the experimenters, in this case the
six raters. We call upon other independent researchers to
further investigate this important topic.
One characteristic, though, is worth mentioning. The
proposed group of marketing trials did report recruiting
large numbers of patients from multiple countries and
study sites yielding a very small average number of patients
per centre. Recruitment from multiple sites is more expen-
sive
and
harder to
manage.

 recruiting from a large number of centres might include
the need to get sufficient numbers of patients in a shorter
period, targeted enrolment for regulatory approval pur-
poses, and the need to ensure a diverse geographical sam-
ple. Nonetheless, compared with interventional trials
conducted without industry support, it is notable that trials
identified by the study team as marketing with a YES score
reported on common conditions where, in the opinion of
the raters, patients could easily have been recruited from a
smaller number of centres in a similar time period, with
less risk to data quality and at reduced cost. Involvement in
the design of the study could include recruitment strat-
egies. The justification for specific recruitment strategies
are not typically reported in journal articles, protocols or
trial registries so this information can only be gathered
from the manufacturers or the authors of the study. We
tried but failed to obtain this information from individual
trial authors.
The question as to whether marketing trials exist re-
mains controversial. At one end of the spectrum past
editors such as Marcia Angell (NEJM) and Richard
Smith (The BMJ) have claimed medical journals have
become
the
advertising
agencies
of
pharmaceutical
companies [9, 10]. However, this view was not supported
by the editors of the journals we contacted. To reach
conclusive proof of marketing intent would require con-
firmatory evidence, such as access to key confidential
company documentation, which we did not have.

Fig. 4 Represents how the groupings are done and are based on
similarity between studies. Studies that are more ‘similar’ to each
other will appear jointed earlier. The Y-axis (height) is based on the
inverse of the ‘similarity’ with studies (or groups of studies) joining
up at greater heights representing studies (or group of studies) that
are less similar than those that join up at lower heights. The overall
spread of the studies with roughly equal numbers in groups appear
to show a lack of clustering structure (at least in relation to YES/NO/
MAYBE) and is consistent with the silhouette graph

Fig. 5 (Silhouette plot) helps with the interpretation of how many
groups are needed as well as how ‘similar’ the studies are within
each group. This figure shows that the two groups get a
considerable number of studies instead of one group accounting for
just a handful of studies. At the same time it shows that the
10.1186/s13063-015-1107-1 ‘similarity’ within groups is relatively poor
with averages within group of (0.31 and 0.22). In case of adequate
discrimination and grouping, these averages would be expected in
the region of 0.6. The Figure presented here was typical of that
found for larger values for the number of groups

 An absence of marketing, though, may undermine im-
plementation of beneficial interventions. As an example,
tranexamic acid in trauma has been proven to be effective
[11] but has not been widely used in practice; had the trial
been designed with marketing in mind, recruiting smaller
numbers of patients from a considerably larger number of
centres, it might have been more influential (as well as
more expensive). Nor is it even necessarily unethical to
conduct a trial purely as a marketing exercise. The ISIS-2
trial examined the effect of streptokinase versus placebo
in acute myocardial infarction [12], despite the fact that
the authors were already persuaded on the basis of a
meta-analysis
that
streptokinase
worked
[13].
The
placebo-controlled trial of streptokinase was done not to
discover a novel truth but because it was the most effect-
ive way to change medical practice. Such confirmatory tri-
als are an important component of the evidence-base to
ensure generalisability and the ability to replicate the
intervention.
This study has manifest limitations. Firstly, we recog-
nise that we are a self-selected group and other readers
may not agree with our interpretation. Whilst some of
us work, or have worked, for journals included in the
analysis we have attempted to reduce this influence: no
one individual made a determination and editors did not
assess their own journal’s papers. Secondly, our team
does not include clinical experts in all the diseases re-
ported. However, three of the six raters are medical
practitioners who see or have seen patients with most of
the conditions reported in the included trials. Thirdly,
without access to key confidential internal documents,
we cannot conclusively know by whom, and with what
purpose, the trials were designed. Fourthly, we only fo-
cused on RCTs whereas marketing studies may have a
range of study designs and therefore the estimate pro-
posed in this study may vary substantially. Fifthly, we
only studied the large general medical journals and the
problem we are trying to characterise and quantify may
be more or less common in the wider universe of med-
ical journals where most RCTs are published. Sixthly,
the study team categorised the trials as YES/MAYBE/
NO using just the main trial report. It is possible that
they may have categorised trials differently if they
assessed all the supplementary documentation accom-
panying the publications. Data extractors did extract
data from the online supplementary files. Seventhly, con-
tacting authors and editors did not offer confirmatory
evidence of any of our findings. Finally, there was a lot
of unreported information (for example the proportion
of the sample who dropped out) and this may have influ-
enced the cluster analysis. We took a pragmatic ap-
proach of sampling all trials published in six general
medical journals in a particular year and it is possible
that the study did not have sufficient statistical power.
This study revealed the difficulties of trying to apply a
quantitative approach to characterising something as nebu-
lous as a marketing trial. Inevitably our conclusions are
more suited to start a debate than to settle it. The main
issue raised is whether the current system of designing and
publishing interventional trials does serve the best interests
of patients and health practitioners. We hope that this re-
search will trigger further debate on trials and remind edi-
tors, peer reviewers and readers of the need to closely
scrutinise clinical trials for their design (including recruit-
ment strategies and the role of the product manufacturer
in the design, analysis and reporting of the study) as well as
their findings.
Conclusions
Manufacturers have to market their drugs but marketing
imperatives should not unduly influence the design of the
studies and the clinical question under investigation. In
this study six raters reached a consensus that a fifth of
drug trials published in the top six general medical jour-
nals were suggestive of trials designed to a large degree for
marketing purposes. We were unable to create a tax-
onomy for marketing-influenced trials using statistical
methods suggesting that individual trials have a unique
combination of features reported in the journal publica-
tions. The pattern of features makes marketing-influenced
studies difficult to identify by the average reader.
Further guidance is warranted to alert funders, ethics re-
view boards, editors, peer reviewers and readers to warn-
ing signs of marketing-influenced trials. Marketing trials
arise because manufacturers continue to have such a dom-
inant role in the design, conduct and reporting of human
testing of their own products. We support the idea that
the design, analysis and reporting of clinical trials should
only be done by truly independent investigators.
