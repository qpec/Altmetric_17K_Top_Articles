 Abstract 
Background 
Studies in many health systems have found evidence of poorer quality of 
healthcare for patients admitted on weekends or overnight (weekend effect). We 
hypothesised that variation in quality was dependent on not just day but also 
time of admission and aimed to describe the pattern and magnitude  24/7 
variation in the quality of acute stroke care occurring across the entire week. 
Methods 
Nationwide registry based prospective cohort study. Data were from the Sentinel 
Stroke National Audit Programme of 74307 patients admitted with acute stroke 
in England and Wales. Adjusted odds for thirteen measures of acute stroke care 
quality were estimated by fitting multilevel multivariable regression models 
across 42, four hour time periods per week.  
Findings 
Care quality varied across the entire week, and not just between weekends and 
weekdays, with different quality measures showing different patterns and 
magnitudes of variation. Four patterns of variation were identified: a diurnal 
pattern (e.g. dysphagia screening), a day of the week pattern (e.g. physiotherapy 
assessment), an off hours pattern (e.g. door to needle time for thrombolysis) and 
a flow pattern where quality changed sequentially across days (e.g. stroke unit 
admission). The largest magnitude of variation was for door to needle time 
within 60 minutes (Coefficient of Variation 18.2%, range 34.8-66.3%). There was 
no significant difference in adjusted 30 day survival between weekends and 
 weekdays (adjusted OR 1.03, 0.95-1.13) but patients admitted overnight had 
lower odds of survival (adjusted OR 0.90, 0.82-0.99). 
Interpretation 
The "weekend effect" is a simplification, and just one of several patterns of 
weekly variation occuring in stroke care quality. Weekly 24/7 variation should 
also be sought for in other healthcare settings and quality improvement should 
focus on reducing 24/7 variation in quality and not just the weekend effect.

 In Context 
Evidence before this study 
We carried out a literature search of the MEDLINE database for English language 
studies published prior to June 2015 describing temporal variation in healthcare 
quality. The primary focus was to identify studies of stroke care but we also 
carried out searches to identify studies in other clinical settings. The search 
included the following terms: "Weekend", "Weekend effect", "Off hours", 
"Temporal variation", " AND Stroke", "AND quality".  Studies of the weekend 
effect were identified in a wide range of clinical settings and geographies, 
describing evidence of poorer outcomes for patients admitted on the weekend or 
overnight with MI, stroke, pulmonary embolus and general emergency 
admissions.  We identified only a small number of studies that considered 
variation across both time of admission and day of week, including a study of 
obstetric outcomes in California and a study of hospital inpatients from 
Australia.  
Added value of this study 
We found evidence that in acute stroke care, the weekend effect is just one of 
several patterns of variation in quality that occur in real world practice. Quality 
varied across the whole week and different aspects of quality showed different 
patterns of variation. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
These findings imply that in acute stroke care, the weekend effect is a simplification 
of the true extent of temporal variation in healthcare quality that occurs across the 
 week. A focus just on reducing differences in care quality between weekends and 
weekdays will therefore not fully address the problem of variation in healthcare 
quality across the week. Although we only looked at stroke care, the findings from 
previous studies observing the weekend effect in a wide variety of clinical setting 
suggests that these 24/7 variations in quality might also be pervasive across acute 
healthcare settings, and should be sought for and be a focus of quality improvement 
efforts.    
 
 
 
 Introduction 
 
It is now well recognised that the quality of healthcare that patients receive may 
in part be determined by when they are admitted to hospital.1 The "weekend 
effect" (poorer care quality and outcomes for patients admitted at the weekend) 
or “off hours effect” (poorer care outside of usual working hours) have been 
observed in many studies across a wide variety of clinical presentations.2,3,4,5  
Such studies have had a major, and sometimes contentious, impact on health 
policy, for example by prompting moves to increase the number of doctors 
working in hospitals at weekends.6 However, our understanding of why 
healthcare quality may be worse overnight or at the weekend is lacking in 
evidence and remains largely speculative7, creating difficulty in guiding health 
policy and quality improvement. Moreover, previous studies have generally 
taken the approach of comparing weekdays with weekends, or regular and off-
hours, rather than measuring care quality across both day of the week and time. 
This risks obscuring other patterns of temporal variation in care quality which 
might occur and which might have important implications for understanding and 
improving the quality of healthcare services.  
 
We therefore aimed to describe the pattern and magnitude of 24/7 variation in 
multiple domains of care quality for people admitted to hospital with acute 
stroke. Globally, stroke is the second leading cause of death8 and the third largest 
contributor to disease burden9.  There is however good quality evidence for 
acute interventions (such as intravenous thrombolysis and organised stroke unit 
care) effective in improving outcomes after stroke10: how quickly acute stroke 
 care is delivered is therefore both important and can be measured against 
evidenced based standards. Our hypothesis was that care quality is dependent 
on not just day but also time of admission.  
 
 Methods 
 
The study was carried out using data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit 
Programme (SSNAP), the national register of stroke care in England and Wales. 
SSNAP collects data on the clinical characteristics and care quality of patients 
admitted to all acute admitting hospitals in England and Wales with acute 
ischaemic stroke or primary intracerebral haemorrhage. Data were collected and 
validated by clinical teams and entered into the SSNAP database using a secure 
web interface. The investigators used an anonymised extract of this database. 
SSNAP is estimated to include approximately 95% of all adults admitted to 
hospital in with stroke.11 
 
Care quality was measured using a pre-existing set quality indicators reported 
routinely by SSNAP11, which are derived from UK national guidelines.10 These 
indicators reflect the time critical nature of acute stroke care:  Receiving a brain 
scan within 1 hour or 12 hours of admission, direct admission to a stroke unit (or 
intensive care unit or high dependency unit) within 4 hours of admission, 
administration of intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase, door to needle time 
of <60minutes for patients treated with thrombolysis, dysphagia screen within 4 
hours of admission, reviews by a stroke specialist physician and nurse within 24 
 hours of admission, and assessments by physiotherapy, occupational therapy 
and speech and language therapy within 72 hours.  Patients with clinical 
exclusions for dysphagia screening or therapy assessments (e.g. being treated 
palliatively only) were excluded from the denominator of these specific 
indicators. Only patients with ischaemic stroke presenting within 4.5 hours of 
stroke onset were included in the denominator for thrombolysis. The outcome 
measure was 30-day post admission survival. 
 
The cohort was all adult patients (aged >16 years) admitted to hospital with 
acute stroke (ischaemic or primary intracerebral haemorrhage) in England and 
Wales from April 2013-March 2014.  
 
Statistical Analysis 
Time of admission was recorded for all patients and grouped into six 4-hour 
blocks for each day of the week (Midnight to 03:59 , 04:00  to 07:59,  08:00 to 
11:59, 12:00 to 15:59, 16:00 to 19:59 and 20:00 to 23:59), resulting in 42 time 
categories in total. 4 hour blocks were chosen because it was the shortest time 
period that provided sufficient numbers of patients in each block for analysis 
(≈350+). For patients with stroke occurring as an inpatient, the time of stroke 
onset was used in place of time of admission.  
 
Patterns of care quality were visusalised using heatmaps, which show the 
performance for each of the 4 hour time blocks across the  week: Blue indicates 
relatively good performance and red indicates relatively poor performance. The 
 unadjusted heatmaps display the crude performance in each time block as a 
proportion of the mean. The multivariable heatmaps display the adjusted odds 
ratio for each quality indicator as estimated from the multivariable models. The 
middle ranking time period in the unadjusted analyses was used as the reference 
category in the multivariable analyses, to aid in visual comparison between the 
unadjusted and multivariable analyses. Black dots indicate time periods where 
the 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio did not cross unity.  
 
The magnitude variation between the time blocks was quantified by calculating 
the coefficient of variation. Multivariable analysis was carried out by fitting 
multilevel logistic regression models including patient age, sex, place of stroke 
onset (inpatient or out of hospital), stroke type, vascular comorbidity (atrial 
fibrillation, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, previous stroke or TIA, 
hypertension), pre-stroke functional level (as measured by the modified Rankin 
score12), time from stroke onset to admission, stroke severity (either National 
Institutes of Health stroke severity score, or the level of consciousness on 
admission) and hospital level random intercepts. Data were 100% complete for 
all baseline variables apart from NIHSS on admission, which was available for 
54048 patients (72.7%). We carried out sensitivity analyses to explore the effect 
of these missing data. Firstly, models were fitted using level of consciousness on 
admission (which was available for 100% of patients) as a proxy for stroke 
severity. Secondly, models were fitted following multiple imputation of 20 
datasets (results reported in the supplementary material). In order to aid 
comparison with previous literature on the weekend effect, we also fitted models 
 in which admission was classified in four larger time categories: weekdays and 
weekends 0800-1959, and weekday and weekends 2000-0759.  
Analyses and visualisations were carried out using STATA 14. 
 
Results 
 
There were 74307 patients with acute stroke admitted to 199 hospitals. The 
median age of patients was 77 (IQR 67-85) and 65193(87.7%) had an ischaemic 
stroke [Figure 1]. The most frequent day of admission was Monday (15.6%), and 
admissions were less frequent on Saturdays (12.7%) and Sundays (12.8%) 
compared to weekdays. Discharges from hospital were less common at 
weekends, with only 5.7% and 3.1% of hospital discharges occurring on 
Saturday and Sunday respectively.  
 
There was wide variation in both the magnitude and pattern of temporal 
variation in quality across the 13 quality indicators [Figure 2]. In unadjusted 
analyses, the greatest magnitude of variation was observed for door to needle 
time of < 60 minutes, which ranged from 34.3-66.3% (Coefficient of Variation 
18.2%). The indicators with the smallest variation were 30 day survival, which 
ranged from 79.6-90.0% (CV 3.1%) and assessment by a stroke nurse (Range 
77.4-90.2%, CV 3.5%). 
 
 We observed four main patterns of 24/7 variation in the heatmaps and these 
were similar in both the unadjusted and multivariable analyses of each indicator 
[Figs 3-15].  
 
Four of the indicators showed a diurnal pattern of variation, with quality varying 
across time of day (dysphagia screen, brain scan within 12 hours, brain scan 
within 1 hour, thrombolysis). This variation was not just restricted to differences 
between daytimes and overnight – for example patients arriving during the 
morning were more likely to receive a brain scan within 1 hour compared to 
those admitted in the afternoon. Six of the indicators varied across days of the 
week, with lower quality care for weekend admissions (stroke physician 
assessment and nurse assessment) or for patients admitted on a Thursday or 
Friday (Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, communication SLT therapy and 
swallow SLT assessments). The third pattern was for a poorer care both 
overnight and at the weekend (door-to-needle time for thrombolysis). The fourth 
pattern was of sequential change in quality across both day and time, with 
quality improving sequentially across weekdays and then deteriorating over the 
weekend, resulting in patients on Mondays having the lowest quality of care 
(stroke unit admission). 
 
There was no significant difference in adjusted 30 day survival between patients 
admitted during the day on weekend compared to weekdays (aOR 1.03, 0.95-
1.13) [Fig 16, 17] . Survival was lower for patients admitted overnight on 
weekdays, albeit at very borderline levels of statistical significance (aOR 0.90, 
0.82-0.99). The point estimate and confidence intervals of survival for patients 
 admitted overnight at weekends differed between models – survival was poorer 
in the models using level of consciousness (aOR 0.84, 0.77-0.93) and with 
multiply imputed NIHSS (aOR 0.86, 0.77-0.95) but not in the complete case 
analysis (aOR 0.89, 0.78-1.01). The analyses using imputed datasets were 
otherwise very similar (Results in supplementary material) 
 
Discussion 
  
Variations in the quality of acute stroke care were found to occur across the 
whole week and not just between weekends and weekdays, with individual 
indicators of care quality differing in the magnitude and pattern of variation.  
This suggests that even within a single, well defined clinical pathway such as 
acute stroke care, temporal variation is a complex phenomenon that probably 
has multiple causes. Our findings indicate that the concept of the “weekend 
effect” is a major simplification of the true extent and nature of temporal 
variation in healthcare quality and that it is just one of a number of patterns of 
variation in care quality that occur in real world clinical practice.  Unmasking 
these potentially hidden sources of variation in quality through appropriate data 
collection and visualisation might help in identifying the factors causing 
variation in quality (such as staffing levels or bed capacity) and has the potential 
of being an important tool for quality improvement in healthcare.  
 
There is an extensive previous literature exploring differences in care quality 
and outcomes between weekdays and weekends.2,5,13,14,15 Some studies have also 
 described differences in care between daytimes and overnight16 and between 
regular hours and off-hours17. Studies of the weekend effect in stroke care 
specifically have been conflicting. Some have found evidence for reduced quality 
of care for patients admitted on weekends18, but the evidence for differences in 
mortality between weekend and weekday admissions has been mixed.19,20,21  
These differences might be explained by differences in how stroke care services 
are organised21, and there is evidence that low nurse staffing levels on stroke 
units are associated with higher mortality at weekends.22   
 
The limitation of much of the previous literature on the "weekend effect" is that 
it has typically been based on comparisons of weekends versus weekdays, or 
regular versus off-hours, without taking into account variation that might occur 
across both day of the week and time of day.  There are however a small number 
of studies that have considered how care might vary in this way.  For example, 
administrative data has been used to model daily and diurnal patterns in 
mortality risk as part of a prognostic model for hospital inpatients23 and 
identified weekend effects lag into the following week24. Diurnal patterns have 
also been observed in the frequency of obstetric complications.25  It therefore 
seems likely that patterns of healthcare quality we observed in this study are not 
restricted to stroke care and would be found other acute healthcare settings if 
they were sought for.  
 
We identified four main patterns of temporal variation in stroke care quality and  
we hypothesise that they reflect differing underlying causal factors. Recognising 
characteristic patterns of variation might therefore be useful in helping policy 
 makers, clinicians or healthcare managers identify and tackle the underlying 
causes and organise healthcare services more effectively.  
 
The diurnal patterns we observed may be the result of reduced clinical services 
overnight – such as lower staffing levels or reduced access to diagnostics. 
However, we found that variation in quality also occurred during usual working 
hours, suggesting that there may be other contributory factors. For example, that 
patients admitted in the afternoon were less likely to get an urgent brain scan 
than those admitted in the morning might be due to higher demand for CT 
scanning at busier times of the day. 
 
Variation in quality that relates directly to admission on, or in relation to the 
weekend suggests that how healthcare is organised on the weekend affects 
quality.  Survey data show that stroke services in England and Wales are more 
likely to provide seven day physiotherapy than occupational therapy or speech 
therapy services26 - consistent with the pattern of variation seen in this study.  
The data are also evidence that the provision of healthcare on weekends may 
also affect patients admitted on other days of the week, with patients admitted 
on Thursdays and Fridays experiencing the longest waits for therapy 
assessment.   
 
One indicator (door to needle time) showed a strong relationship to both day of 
week and time of day, with reduced performance both overnight and at  
weekends. Achieving fast door to needle times in acute stroke requires that the 
entire diagnostic, decision making and treatment pathway is carried out quickly 
 – if just one stage is slow then this may cause critical delays in the whole 
pathway.  Interventions that require this type of rapid coordinated, systems 
response with on-site presence of key decision makers might be therefore show 
the greatest magnitude of 24/7 variation.  
 
The pattern of care quality observed for stroke unit access seems most likely to 
reflect patient flow and bed capacity within stroke care services. We hypothesise 
that this is due to loss of spare bed capacity over the weekend as a result of 
reduced frequency of hospital discharges, resulting in the slowest transfers to 
stroke units occurring on Mondays.  
 
Variation in survival after stroke was largely explained by differences in patient 
characteristics, with proportionally more unwell patients being admitted during 
off hours. Therefore one of the reasons for apparent temporal variation in care 
quality are factors which determine when and how patients present to 
healthcare services. It is possible therefore that the conflicting nature of the 
literature on the presence or not of the weekend effect reflects the ability of 
different studies to properly control for this source of confounding.27 
 
Further research could help to test these hypotheses and identify the reasons for 
these patterns of temporal variation, identify new patterns of temporal variation 
and perhaps aid in developing new taxonomies of temporal variation in care 
quality. In the meantime, these findings imply that there will not be a single 
solution to eradicating time based inequalities in care. Solutions are likely to 
require not just ensuring appropriate clinical staffing but also measures to 
 improve the capacity and utilisation of beds, generate more efficient patient flow, 
improve access to diagnostic and clinical support services, and improve the 
overall resilience of care pathways.  They also need to consider the wider 
healthcare system and not just the hospital in isolation, such as the availability of 
social care and community services at the weekends, on which patient 
discharges from hospital are dependent.  Much of the current discourse on 
reducing weekend effects has occurred in the absence of a detailed 
understanding of why temporal variation in care quality occurs.  Since solutions 
are likely to come at significant financial and opportunity cost28, policy makers, 
healthcare managers and funders need to ensure that the reasons for temporal 
variation in quality are properly understood and that resources are targeted 
appropriately. For example, simply transferring clinicians from weekdays to 
weekends may not have the intended effect on quality and may lead to 
unintended consequences for the quality of care provided on weekdays. One 
potential method for gaining a better insight into variations in care quality might 
be to make use of the types of data visualisations we have used in this study, 
which is becoming increasingly feasible to do as electronic healthcare data 
increases in scope and detail.  
 
This study is strengthened by using data from a national registry, which is based 
on clinical rather than administrative data, and with high levels of estimated case 
ascertainment, reducing the risk of selection bias. Overall the data were very 
complete, but data were missing for one variable (NIHSS).  Although the main 
analysis used a complete case analysis, we found that the study results were 
similar when a proxy measure of severity was used, and when multiple 
 imputation was used to account for missing data.  The study would have been 
strengthened by including more outcome measures, particularly of measures 
important after stroke, such as disability and quality of life. However, most of the 
process measures have a strong empirical rationale from good quality 
randomised controlled trial evidence29,20, and longer term outcomes data are not 
currently available in SSNAP.  The evidence for stroke therapy interventions is 
generally weaker than other aspects of acute care but are widely recognised in 
clinical guidelines to be an essential element of acute stroke care10. The study 
used time sensitive care quality indicators, which are likely to be more subject to 
temporal variation than aspects of care where timeliness is less important. The 
selection of the indicators was however not arbitrary, but used the already 
existing national set of acute stroke measures used in the NHS.   Extending this 
methodology to other areas of healthcare, particularly for presentations where 
the timeliness of care is an important determinant of outcomes (such as acute 
myocardial infarction or surgical emergencies) would be useful further areas of 
study.  
 
Summary 
 
We found evidence that care quality in acute stroke care varies with time in 
much more complex ways than previous studies of the “weekend effect” in 
healthcare would suggest. Although this study is of the quality of care received 
by people with acute stroke, it seems unlikely that stroke is alone in displaying 
such patterns of temporal variation in quality. This suggests that there is a need 
 for a more sophisticated understanding of the patterns of and reasons for 
temporal variation in care quality and that this should become a routine part of 
quality improvement in healthcare.
