by Promoting the Survival of Lung and Liver Mononuclear
Phagocytes

Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia is a common and dangerous infection with diminishing treatment options due to increasing
antibiotic resistance among causal pathogens. The mononuclear phagocyte system is a heterogeneous group of leukocytes com-
posed of tissue-resident macrophages, dendritic cells, and monocyte-derived cells that are critical in defense against pneumonia,
but mechanisms that regulate their maintenance and function during infection are poorly defined. M-CSF has myriad effects on
mononuclear phagocytes but its role in pneumonia is unknown. We therefore tested the hypothesis that M-CSF is required for
mononuclear phagocyte-mediated host defenses during bacterial pneumonia in a murine model of infection. Genetic deletion
or immunoneutralization of M-CSF resulted in reduced survival, increased bacterial burden, and greater lung injury. M-CSF
was necessary for the expansion of lung mononuclear phagocytes during infection but did not affect the number of bone marrow
or blood monocytes, proliferation of precursors, or recruitment of leukocytes to the lungs. In contrast, M-CSF was essential to
survival and antimicrobial functions of both lung and liver mononuclear phagocytes during pneumonia, and its absence resulted
in bacterial dissemination to the liver and hepatic necrosis. We conclude that M-CSF is critical to host defenses against bacterial
pneumonia by mediating survival and antimicrobial functions of mononuclear phagocytes in the lungs and liver.

P
neumonia caused by aerobic Gram-negative bacilli is
among the most common and dangerous nosocomial
infections and an important cause of death, prolonged
hospital stay, and increased healthcare costs. Gram-negative bacilli
colonize the upper aerodigestive tract as part of the normal response
to acute illness and cause pneumonia when introduced into the
lower respiratory tract by microaspiration (1, 2). The progressive
rise in antibiotic resistance among the causative organisms in
recent decades has markedly diminished the available treatment
options for these infections, lending new impetus to mechanistic
studies that may inform the development of better therapeutic
strategies.
The mononuclear phagocyte system encompasses heteroge-
neous populations of cells from three distinct lineages, namely
yolk sac–derived and self-renewing tissue-resident macro-
phages, Flt3 ligand–dependent pre–dendritic cell (DC)-derived
cells, and monocytes and their progeny (3). The latter lineage,
derived from circulating monocytes that express high levels of the
surface glycoprotein Ly6C in mice, can differentiate into diverse
populations of mononuclear phagocytes depending on environ-
mental cues: under homeostatic conditions, mouse Ly6Chi mono-
cytes terminally differentiate into endothelial-patrolling Ly6Clo
counterparts in the blood and also give rise to some short-lived
populations of tissue macrophages. In response to tissue injury,
Ly6Chi monocytes extravasate into the damaged tissue and differen-
tiate into inflammatory macrophages, repopulate some tissue-resident
macrophage populations, and differentiate into monocyte-derived
inflammatory DC that are phenotypically similar to, but tran-
scriptionally distinct from, CD11b+ pre-DC–derived conven-
tional DC (4). The mouse lung, in particular, contains at least five
populations of mononuclear phagocytes under homeostatic con-
ditions, namely the tissue-resident and long-lived alveolar mac-
rophages, short-lived monocyte-derived interstitial macrophages,
CD11b+ conventional DC, CD103+ airway DC, and plasmacytoid
DC (5). In the context of injury, Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo monocytes,
monocyte-derived DC, and macrophages enter the lungs and res-
ident cells display accelerated efflux and death, comprising a
complex and dynamic network.
M-CSF was the first cytokine described for its induction of
macrophage colonies from bone marrow progenitors in soft agar
(6, 7) and is a key regulator of the development and homeostasis
of the mononuclear phagocyte system (8–10). In different exper-
imental conditions, M-CSF has been shown to mediate diverse
functions in the differentiation, proliferation, survival, and effector
functions of multiple cell types from different mononuclear phago-
cyte lineages (11). In addition, the sole receptor for M-CSF, CSF1R,
or CD115 is shared with a structurally unrelated ligand, IL-34 (12).

 M-CSF and IL-34 have distinct tissue expression patterns and, at
least in the development of osteoclasts, microglia, and skin Lang-
erhans cells, have nonredundant roles (13). Most recently, protein
tyrosine phosphatase-z was described as a second receptor for IL-34
(14, 15).
Evidence from multiple experimental systems support a critical
role for mononuclear phagocytes in host defenses but the mech-
anisms that control the development, homing, and survival of these
cells during specific infections are incompletely defined. In the
context of bacterial pneumonia, monocytes are recruited to the
lungs via a CCR2-dependent mechanism, and both recruited and
resident mononuclear phagocytes mediate host defenses by direct
killing of bacteria and NF-kB–mediated recruitment of other
leukocytes (16–20). In this context, we previously defined the
dynamic changes in the various mononuclear phagocyte pop-
ulations during experimental Gram-negative pneumonia and
reported that CCR2 was necessary not only to the recruitment of
monocyte-derived lineage cells but, unexpectedly, also controlled
the number and phenotype of alveolar macrophages and all DC
populations in this infection (17). Little is known about the role of
the M-CSF/IL-34 biologic axis in the context of infection, and
many of the published studies in the field predate current under-
standing of the lineages of mononuclear phagocytes (21–25). To
our knowledge, this mechanism has not been investigated in
pulmonary infections to date. We therefore sought to define the
role of this biological axis in pneumonia by testing the hypothesis
that M-CSF is required for mononuclear phagocyte-mediated host
defense during Klebsiella pneumonia.
Materials and Methods
Animals and in vivo procedures
We used a previously characterized model of experimental bacterial pneu-
monia (26, 27). C57BL/6 and op/+ mice, purchased (The Jackson Laboratory,
Bar Harbor, ME), were bred and maintained under pathogen-free conditions
and in compliance with institutional animal care regulations. Age- and sex-
matched 6- to 8-wk-old mice were used in all experiments. Klebsiella
pneumoniae strain 43816 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA)
was grown overnight at 37˚C to midlog phase in tryptic soy broth. Bacteria
were administered intratracheally as previously described (17). Unless other-
wise noted, all mice received i.p. injections of 100 mg/100 ml anti–M-CSF–
neutralizing Ab (clone 5A1), anti-CSF1R–neutralizing Ab (clone AFS98),
IgG1 isotype control (clone HRPN), or IgG2A isotype control (clone 2A3)
beginning 2 h before intratracheal inoculation and then every 24 h through
day 2 postinfection (all from BioXCell, West Lebanon, NH). In some ex-
periments, mice received three i.p. injections of 2 mg BrdU (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA) in 0.2 ml PBS, every 3 h until 2 h before bacterial inoculation,
as described (28). At designated time points, mice were euthanized with an
injection of ketamine and xylazine.
Tissue harvest
Blood was collected in heparinized syringes from the right ventricle. Lung
and liver vasculature were perfused with 3 ml PBS with 2 mM EDTA before
excision. Blood and homogenized lungs and right liver lobes were serially
diluted and cultured on blood agar plates for quantification of bacterial
content. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed as previously described
(26). Histology was performed on lungs and left liver lobes as previously
described (26, 29). In other experiments, whole lungs, left liver lobes, and
plasma were processed for ELISAs as described (27).
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was performed as previously described (26, 30, 31). Cell
suspensions of whole lungs, median liver lobes, bone marrow, and peripheral
blood were prepared as previously described (27, 29, 32). The following
reagents were used to label cells for flow cytometry (from BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA; eBioscience, San Diego, CA; or BioLegend, San Diego, CA):
7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD), anti-CD3–PE-Cy7 (clone 17A2), anti-
CD11b–allophycocyanin-Cy7 (clone M1/70), anti-CD11c–PE-Cy7 (clone
HL3), anti-CD19–PE-Cy7 (clone 1D3), anti-CD24–allophycocyanin (clone
M1/69), anti-CD45–PerCP or AmCyan (clone 30-F11), anti-CD64–BV421
(clone X54-5/7.1), anti-CD103–allophycocyanin (clone 2E7), anti-CD115
(clone AFS98), anti-CD117-FITC (clone 2B8), anti-CD135–BV421 (clone
A2F10.1), anti-F4/80–Pacific Blue (clone BM8), anti-F4/80-PE (clone T45-
2342), Fc block (anti-CD16/CD32), anti–I-A/I-E–FITC or AmCyan (clone
M5/114.15.12), Ki-67–PE and isotype control (clones B56 and MOPC-21),
anti-Ly6C–PE or Pacific Blue (clone HK1.4), anti-Ly6G–PE-Cy7 (clone
1A8), anti-NK1.1–PE-Cy7 (clone PK136), and anti–plasmacytoid DC
Ag-1–allophycocyanin (clone 129c1). In some experiments, cells were
labeled, fixed, and permeabilized using a commercial kit (Cytofix/Cytoperm;
BD Biosciences) before staining for intracellular Ags. Data were acquired
on an FACS Canto II instrument using BD FACSDiva software (version
8.0; BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (version 8.8.6;
Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Leukocyte subsets were identified as previously
described (4, 17, 33) with minor modifications, as depicted in the figures.
The absolute number of each cell type was determined as the product of
the percentage of the cell type and the total number of cells in the
sample, as determined on an automated cell counter (Countess; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA).
ELISA and assays for alanine transaminase, aspartate
aminotransferase, urea nitrogen, and lactate
ELISAs for M-CSF and IL-34 were performed according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Albumin ELISA
was performed using 5 mg/ml goat anti-mouse albumin (A90-134A), 0.025
mg/ml goat-HRP detection (A90-134P), mouse reference serum (rs10-101)
(Bethyl Laboratories; Montgomery, TX), and 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plasma alanine transaminase, aspartate ami-
notransferase, and urea nitrogen were measured using commercial kits
(Liquid ALT Reagent Set and Liquid AST Reagent Set; Pointe Scientific,
Canton, MI; and DetectX Urea Nitrogen Detection Kit; Arbor Assays, Ann
Arbor, MI). Plasma lactate was measured using a commercial device
(Lactate Plus Meter; Nova Biomedical, Waltham, MA).
In vitro studies
Bone marrow cells were cultured as described to generate macrophages
(34). In viability assays, macrophages were washed and resuspended in
DMEM with 10% FCS without antibiotics, and 1 3 105 cells were cultured
overnight in opaque flat-bottom 96-well tissue-culture plates (BD Falcon,
Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cells were then incubated with or without 5 ng
M-CSF for 2 h before the addition of K. pneumoniae. After 150 min, plates
were washed with sterile HBSS, and viability was measured using a
commercial kit (LIVE/DEAD viability/cytotoxicity kit for mammalian
cells; Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For phagocytosis assays,
bacteria were labeled with a pH-sensitive cyanine dye that acquires fluo-
rescence in acidic environments (35, 36): 1 3 105 macrophages were seeded
into round-bottom tissue culture–treated plates (Costar, Corning, NY) and in-
cubated with or without M-CSF as above. Midlog phase K. pneumoniae cells
were suspended at 1 3 109/ml in sterile saline, fixed in 5 ml 70% ethanol for
5 min, washed, and resuspended in sterile HBSS; CypHer5E dye (GE Health-
care Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) was added at a final concentration of 5 mmol
before incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Bacteria were then washed,
and 1 3 108 bacteria were added to wells containing macrophages. Plates were
centrifuged for 30 s to achieve cell contact and incubated at 37˚C and 5% CO2
for 30 min, then placed on ice, washed in cold HBSS, and analyzed immediately
by flow cytometry. Positive gating was set using an unstained control.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using Prism statistical software (version 5.0d;
GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data from survival experiments were
analyzed using the log-rank test. Values between two groups over multiple
time points were compared with two-way ANOVA. Comparisons between
two groups at a single time were performed using the nonparametric Mann–
Whitney U test. Comparisons between multiple groups at a single time
point were performed using the Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric test with
Dunn comparison posttest. Comparison of paired samples receiving dif-
ferent treatments was made using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test
or two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. The p values ,0.05 were con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
Role of M-CSF during pulmonary infection with
K. pneumoniae
We began by measuring the concentration of M-CSF and IL-34 protein
in whole-lung homogenates during experimental pneumonia induced

 by K. pneumoniae. Both ligands were detectable in uninfected lungs.
As compared with animals challenged with intratracheal saline
vehicle, the concentration of M-CSF increased ∼2-fold as the
infection progressed but the concentration of IL-34 did not
change significantly (Fig. 1A, 1B). In contrast, the concentration
of plasma M-CSF protein remained undetectable in plasma
throughout the time course, suggesting that M-CSF was produced
locally in the lungs during infection. Given these findings, we
focused our studies on the role of M-CSF during Klebsiella
pneumonia.
To assess the contribution of M-CSF during bacterial pneumonia,
we next examined the outcome of animals deficient in M-CSF during
infection. Mice homozygous for an inactivating mutation in the
M-CSF locus (op/op) had notably increased mortality during ex-
perimental pneumonia as compared with littermate controls, with
no animals surviving beyond 2 d; this was associated with increased
incidence and severity of bacteremia on the first day of the infection
(Fig. 1C, 1D). The role of M-CSF during development of the
mononuclear phagocyte system results in a number of well-
documented phenotypic abnormalities in op/op mice, including
reduced number of alveolar macrophages in juvenile, but not adult,
animals and spontaneous production of matrix metalloproteinases
by mutant alveolar macrophages (37). To discriminate between the
role of M-CSF induction during bacterial pneumonia and its role
during development, we tested the effect of immunoneutralization
of M-CSF starting at the onset of the infection. Wild-type mice
receiving anti–M-CSF–neutralizing Ab had increased mortality,
increased lung bacterial burden, and markedly increased incidence
and severity of bacteremia as compared with animals receiving an
isotype control Ab (Fig. 1E, 1F). We found similar results with
antagonism of CSF1R during the infection. The administration of a
neutralizing CSF1R Ab to uninfected animals did not influence the
number of blood Ly6Chi monocytes or lung mononuclear phago-
cytes but lead to a reduction in blood Ly6Clo monocytes (Fig. 2A,
2B), consistent with prior reports that, in steady state, M-CSF

 mediates differentiation of blood Ly6Chi monocytes to their Ly6Clo
counterparts (38, 39). In the context of infection, administration of
anti-CSF1R Ab resulted in a similar increase in mortality and
bacterial burden as noted with M-CSF neutralization (Fig. 2C, 2D).
These data indicate that the M-CSF–CSF1R interaction is necessary
for host defenses during bacterial pneumonia independent of their
role in development.
Mechanism of M-CSF–mediated host defense during
pneumonia
To begin to address how M-CSF mediates its beneficial effects
during bacterial pneumonia, we examined the effect of M-CSF
neutralization on lung mononuclear phagocyte subsets in the
lungs in the context of pneumonia (Fig. 3A). M-CSF neutralization
resulted in a significant reduction in the numbers of cells of
monocyte lineage, namely Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo monocytes,
monocyte-derived macrophages, and monocyte-derived inflam-
matory DC, in the lungs of mice during pneumonia (Fig. 3B–D).
In addition, M-CSF neutralization caused a reduction in the
number of alveolar macrophages and conventional CD11b+ DC,
but not other DC subsets or neutrophils (Fig. 3E–J), similar to our
prior report in mice with CCR2 deficiency (17).
To understand how the M-CSF–CSF1R axis contributes to the
numbers of lung mononuclear phagocytes during Klebsiella pneu-
monia, we reasoned that the observed reduction in lung monocyte-
derived cells, and possibly alveolar macrophages and conventional
CD11b+ DC, may be attributable to impairments in monocytopoeisis,
trafficking between the bone marrow, blood, and lung compartments,
or survival of leukocytes that have arrived in the lungs. We found that
neutralization of M-CSF had no effect on the concentration of Ly6Chi
and Ly6Clo monocyte numbers in bone marrow or blood (Fig. 4A,
4B). Consistent with this, we found no difference in the proliferation
of bone marrow macrophage-DC progenitor or the recently described
committed-monocyte progenitor (40) after neutralization of M-CSF
(Fig. 4C, 4D). These data indicate that M-CSF is dispensable for the
generation of monocytes from progenitor cells in the bone marrow
during bacterial pneumonia.
M-CSF can be chemotactic for mononuclear phagocytes (41,
42). To assess for this possibility, we pulsed uninfected mice with
the thymidine analog, BrdU, thereby labeling populations of
FIGURE 3.

 proliferating cells that were in S-phase at the time of the pulse and
then quantified the number of labeled leukocytes in various
compartments after the onset of infection. As expected, we found
fewer BrdU-positive bone marrow neutrophils and a marked in-
crease in labeled neutrophils in the blood and lung of infected
mice compared with uninfected controls that was independent of
M-CSF neutralization (Fig. 5A–C). M-CSF neutralization also did
not influence the numbers of labeled Ly6Chi monocytes in the
bone marrow, blood, or lungs during infection (Fig. 5A–C), sug-
gesting that M-CSF is also dispensable for the recruitment of lung
monocyte-derived cells during pneumonia.
We next assessed the role of M-CSF on survival of mononuclear
phagocytes during infection, because the M-CSF–CSF1R axis can
mediate survival of mononuclear phagocytes under homeostatic
conditions (43). We addressed this question by measuring the
proportion of dead cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of
infected animals to minimize the artifact of ex vivo cell death that
inevitably occurs during processing of samples. M-CSF neutrali-
zation resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of dead
Ly6Chi monocytes in the lungs of infected animals (Fig. 6A),
potentially implicating M-CSF as a survival factor for lung
monocyte-derived cells during pneumonia. To directly examine the
role of M-CSF in mediating monocyte survival during infection, we
also assessed the survival of bone marrow–derived macrophages
coincubated with K. pneumoniae. As compared with cells incubated
with bacteria in the presence of M-CSF, monocyte-derived macro-
phages incubated with bacteria in the absence of M-CSF had reduced
survival (Fig. 6B). In addition, the surviving monocyte-derived
macrophages had impaired phagocytosis of K. pneumoniae in the
absence of M-CSF (Fig. 6C), suggesting that M-CSF promotes the
survival of mononuclear phagocytes during infection and also
contributes to the antimicrobial functions of these cells inde-
pendent of its effect on the number of leukocytes.
Role of M-CSF in controlling liver injury during bacterial
pneumonia
In the course of the above studies, we noticed that M-CSF neutral-
ization during pneumonia was associated with gross visual evidence
of liver injury. To investigate this, we assessed the effect of M-CSF
neutralization on the histology of lung and liver during experimental
pneumonia. The lung histology did not differ between pneumonic
mice treated with anti–M-CSF and isotype controls; in contrast,
M-CSF neutralization during pneumonia resulted in large areas of
sharply demarcated hepatocellular necrosis, associated with
prominent hepatocyte microvesicles (Fig. 7A). Consistent with
this, neutralization of M-CSF resulted in elevations in plasma

 concentrations of aspartate transaminase and alanine transami-
nase during pneumonia (Fig. 7B). Because M-CSF neutralization
resulted in increased incidence and extent of bacteremia (Fig. 1),
we next assessed whether the observed hepatocellular injury was
associated with increased hepatic bacterial content after the liver
had been perfused to displace its blood content. We found that,
in mice with pneumonia, M-CSF neutralization resulted in in-
creased liver bacterial burden (Fig. 7C), potentially explaining
the increased liver injury. To assess whether the hepatocellular
injury is merely a reflection of multiorgan dysfunction in the
context of sepsis, we also quantified other parameters of end-
organ dysfunction. As expected, M-CSF neutralization resulted
in increased lung injury, as measured by albumin concentration
in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (Fig. 8A). In contrast to its
effect on the liver, however, M-CSF neutralization did not affect
renal function, as measured by the concentration of blood urea
nitrogen, nor cause significant end-organ hypoperfusion, as quan-
tified by plasma lactate concentration (Fig. 8B, 8C), suggesting that
M-CSF neutralization results in specific injury to the liver in ad-
dition to the lungs.
In order to investigate the contribution of M-CSF in the liver
during bacterial pneumonia, we assessed the liver levels of M-CSF
protein, because the plasma concentrations of M-CSF were un-
detectable during the infection. The liver contained high concen-
trations of M-CSF protein at baseline that did not change
significantly during the infection (Fig. 9A). We therefore tested the
hypothesis that, similar to our findings in the lungs, liver M-CSF
mediates the survival of liver mononuclear phagocytes during the
infection, leading to better clearance of bacteria from the liver.
Consistent with this and analogous to the lungs, we found that
liver monocyte-derived macrophages and F4/80+CD11b2 resident
Kupffer cells were reduced in number with M-CSF neutralization
during pneumonia (Fig. 9B, 9C). Also similar to our findings in
the lungs, M-CSF neutralization resulted in increased death of
liver Ly6Chi monocytes during pneumonia (Fig. 9D). Taken to-
gether, these data indicate that M-CSF is also required for
mononuclear phagocyte-mediated defense in the liver during
bacterial pneumonia.
Discussion
The mononuclear phagocyte system has been implicated in host
defense against bacterial pneumonia (16, 17, 44, 45), but the
mechanisms that generate and maintain these cells during the
infection have not been defined. In the current study, we report
that M-CSF, but not IL-34, is induced in the lung during the in-
fection. M-CSF was essential to the survival of the host as a
critical survival signal for mononuclear phagocytes in infected tis-
sues, but appeared to be dispensable for the generation, recruitment,

 and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes during the infection.
The absence of M-CSF thus resulted in reduced numbers of both
monocyte-derived cells and resident macrophage populations in the
lungs and the liver, resulting in increased bacterial burden and injury
to these organs and increased incidence and extent of bacteremia.
M-CSF is produced by many cell types, including mononuclear
phagocytes themselves, and has been documented to have a mul-
titude of effects on mononuclear phagocytes in different experi-
mental conditions, including development during embryogenesis,
monocytopoeisis in adulthood, proliferation, differentiation, che-
motaxis, and survival (as reviewed in Ref. 11). M-CSF has not been
studied extensively in the context of infections, but has been asso-
ciated with host defense in intracellular infections caused by Listeria
monocytogenes (22, 46) and influences macrophage phenotype in
experimental tuberculosis and schistosomiasis (47, 48). We report
that M-CSF appeared to be dispensable for the proliferation and
recruitment of monocytes and their progenitors during pneumonia,
similar to recent findings in sterile peritonitis (39). Our studies did
not directly examine the role of M-CSF in the differentiation of
mononuclear phagocytes in the lungs in vivo, but the intact re-
cruitment of monocytes to the lungs, together with the role of
M-CSF in maintaining the numbers of both lung monocytes and
monocyte-derived cells during infection indicates that the differen-
tiation of monocytes into other mononuclear phagocytes during
pneumonia remained intact despite M-CSF neutralization. In con-
trast, M-CSF was essential in maintaining lung and liver monocytic
phagocyte populations by promoting their survival. M-CSF has been
shown to be critical to survival of mononuclear phagocytes during
development and under homeostatic conditions (49–52), but, to our
knowledge, has not been shown to mediate mononuclear phagocyte
survival in the setting of infection or inflammation. In this context,
macrophage survival is a known regulatory factor in the context of
infection: alveolar macrophage apoptosis, for example, is both an-
timicrobial and anti-inflammatory during pneumococcal pneumonia
(53, 54), whereas macrophage necroptosis induces lung damage
during Gram-negative and S. aureus pneumonia (55, 56).
In addition, we found that M-CSF mediates enhanced phagocytosis
of bacteria by surviving mononuclear phagocytes. In this context,
macrophages from op/op animals have been shown to have impaired
phagocytosis against bacteria but not parasites (57, 58), but it is
difficult to differentiate whether any effect in op/op macrophages is
attributable to developmental abnormalities of the cells or lack of
exposure to M-CSF during acute infection. Similar to our findings,
however, M-CSF results in enhanced phagocytosis of fungal conidia
by human monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro (59). Taken to-
gether, these data suggest that locally produced M-CSF can enhance
antimicrobial properties of mononuclear phagocytes in target organs.
An unexpected finding in our study was the role of M-CSF in
protecting the liver from injury during experimental pneumonia.
The propensity of Gram-negative bacteria, specifically Klebsiella,
to infect the liver is recognized clinically (60). In the context of
experimental pneumonia, the liver is responsible for a protective
acute-phase response, but is also susceptible to TNF-mediated
injury (61–63). M-CSF has recently been shown to mediate pro-
liferation of liver macrophages and recruitment of monocytes to
the injured liver (64). Our data add to this literature, indicating
that endogenous production of M-CSF during pneumonia medi-
ates the accumulation of both monocyte-derived macrophages and
Kupffer cells and protects the liver from disseminated infection.
The present work has several implications for future research.
First, our data suggest that M-CSF is required not only for main-
taining the number of monocyte-derived cells, but also alveolar
macrophages and CD24+ [and thus pre-DC–derived (4)] CD11b+
DC in the lungs as well as Kupffer cells in the liver. This finding is
reminiscent of our prior report in CCR2-deficient mice (17) and
suggests either that Ly6Chi monocytes repopulate other lineages of

 mononuclear phagocytes in the acute setting, as has been shown
previously (9, 65), or that M-CSF is necessary to the maintenance of
all three lineages of mononuclear phagocytes in the setting of acute
injury. Second, we found M-CSF to have a marked role in the ac-
cumulation of Ly6Clo monocytes in the lungs, but any role of these
cells in the setting of acute infection remains undefined. Third, our
work documents the critical role of M-CSF during bacterial pneu-
monia but does not preclude an additional contribution for IL-34 or
its second receptor, protein tyrosine phosphatase-z, in the context of
pneumonia. Finally, our findings may be relevant to efforts to inhibit
M-CSF signaling as a therapeutic strategy in cancer (66), because
such strategies may be expected to predispose patients to more
severe pneumonia.
