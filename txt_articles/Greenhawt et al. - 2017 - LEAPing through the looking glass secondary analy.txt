Abstract
Background: In the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) study, early
peanut introduction in high-risk 4- to 11-month-olds was associated with a signif-
icantly decreased risk of developing peanut allergy. However, the influences of
key baseline high-risk factors on peanut tolerance are poorly understood.
Methods: Secondary analysis was conducted on the publically available LEAP
dataset, exploring relationships between peanut tolerance, baseline peanut/egg
sensitization, eczema severity/duration, age of introduction, gender, and race.
Results: A multiple logistic regression model predicting odds of successful oral
food challenge (OFC) at 60 months noted higher odds with early introduction
(OR 9.2, P < 0.001, 95% CI 4.2–20.3), white race (OR 2.1, P = 0.04, 95% CI
1.1–3.9), and advancing age (OR 4.8, P = 0.04, 95% CI 1.1–20.8). Odds of pea-
nut tolerance were lower with increasing peanut wheal size (OR 0.58, P < 0.001,
95% CI 0.46–0.74), increased baseline SCORAD score (OR 0.98, P = 0.04, 95%
CI 0.97–1), and increased kUA/l of egg serum IgE (sIgE) (OR 0.99, P = 0.04,
95% CI 0.98–1). The probability of peanut tolerance in the early introduction
group was 83% vs 43% in the avoidance group with SPT wheal of <4 mm. The
probability of a successful OFC was significantly higher with peanut introduction
between 6 and 11 months than at 4–6 months. Increasing eczema severity had
limited impact on the probability of peanut tolerance in the early introduction
arm.
Conclusion: Increasing peanut wheal size predicted peanut tolerance only in the
avoidance arm. Peanut introduction between 6 and 11 months of age was associ-
ated with the highest rates of peanut tolerance, questioning the ‘urgency’ of intro-
duction before 6 months.
Food allergy affects an estimated 8% of US children and
10% of Australian 1-year-olds (1, 2). Peanut allergy in the
United States may affect as many as 1.4–4.6%, depending on
the methodology used (1, 3–5). Comparatively, peanut allergy
prevalence in Australia among 1-year-olds is 3%, and 1.2–
1.4% among children in the UK (2, 6). While there are sev-
eral

 treatment for peanut allergy. Studies suggest that approxi-
mately 24% of individuals will outgrow peanut allergy,
meaning that for the majority it is lifelong (7).
Recent focus has turned to primary prevention as a way to
stem the potential rise in peanut allergy, although this rise
may be more country-selective (4, 5, 8). A thought-provoking
study from Du Toit et al. in 2008 (9) showed that between
two large observational cross-sectional samples of Ashkenazi
Jewish children living in London and Tel Aviv, the London
cohort had a 10-fold higher prevalence of reported peanut
allergy. This difference was significantly associated with
reported prolonged delay in peanut introduction until after
3 years of age in the London sample vs introduction within
the first year of life in the Tel Aviv sample (9). This finding
led to the development of the LEAP (Learning Early about
Peanut) study, a randomized controlled trial of intentional
delayed vs early peanut introduction. The LEAP study
showed a significant absolute risk reduction among those
randomized to early intervention (between 4 and 11 months),
with a number needed to treat of 8.5 among those with no
skin test sensitization and four among those with 1–4 mm
peanut wheal diameter on skin prick testing (10, 11).
In the ensuing months, an interim consensus document,
agreed upon by 10 international allergy/immunology, pedi-
atric,
and
dermatology
organizations
recommended
that
children meeting the high-risk criteria in the LEAP study
start early peanut introduction between 4 and 6 months of
life and provided some practical recommendations for how
the provider and caregiver could accomplish this task given
the firm belief that the study findings would be beneficial to
help
potentially
decrease
the
number
of
children
who
develop peanut allergy (12). However, to date, only Aus-
tralia has issued any official change to its policies regarding
the timing of infant complementary feeding/solid food intro-
duction and early introduction of high-risk allergens, includ-
ing peanut. While efforts are underway to do so in the
United States, spearheaded by the National Institutes for
Allergy
and
Infectious
Diseases
(NIAID),
an
updated
addendum to the 2010 Food Allergy Guidelines has just
been recently published.
As part of a process for transparency in government-
funded research and per agreement in receiving funding from
the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN), the LEAP study
team has made multiple datasets available for public viewing
through www.trialshare.org (13). The published LEAP analy-
sis primarily focused on a simple skin test stratified propor-
tional
comparison
between
intervention
arms,
and
longitudinal assessment of some key immunological markers
of change (primarily skin test results, as well as peanut-speci-
fic sIgE and sIgG4). However, this analysis and final report-
ing of the LEAP trial left lingering questions regarding the
ideal age for the timing of peanut intervention, specific risk
inferred with incremental baseline wheal size up until the
study cutoff at 5 mm, and any predictive associations with
peanut tolerance (14–16). We therefore undertook an analysis
of the publically available data from the LEAP trial to inves-
tigate a more robust understanding of what risk factors influ-
ence peanut tolerance.
Methods
The descriptions of the LEAP study, its sampling frame,
inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary/secondary outcomes, and
data analysis methodologies have been previously published
elsewhere in full detail (8, 10). The ITN TrialShare is a ‘clini-
cal trials research system that provides clinical datasets for
research and analysis as well as a platform for the scientific
community to share data in a secure manner’. Interested
users can register for a free account and can access data,
data reports, and interactive data analysis tools for ITN-
sponsored studies made available by a particular study team
(13).
The primary study authors registered an account with
www.trialshare.org and downloaded the publically available
LEAP datasets to a Microsoft excel spreadsheet (Microsoft
Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). Available variables in
the dataset for downloading are detailed at www.trialshare.
org. Not all variables collected in the LEAP trial and ana-
lyzed in the primary publication were made publically avail-
able. Information from the available datasets were combined
into a master spreadsheet and then exported into Stata SE 13
(College Station, TX, USA), for analysis. All 640 individuals
from the LEAP study included in the dataset with complete
data available for enrollment and 60-month oral food chal-
lenge (OFC) outcomes to determine ultimately if the subject
was peanut tolerant or peanut allergic were included for anal-
ysis. Proportional analysis was performed using chi-square/
fisher exact test, and multiple logistic regression was used to
model associations with a given outcome. Predictive proba-
bilities from this regression model were assessed using the
Stata margins command and visually displayed using the
marginsplot command. Strength and fit of regression models
were assessed through use of receiver-operating characteristic
and area under the curve. This study was not subject to insti-
tutional review board oversight nor does it meet human sub-
jects
research
criteria
given
that
it
involves
publically
available, de-identified data which this authorship group did
not obtain through direct intervention or interaction with the
individual or identifiable private information.
Results
We first explored the relationship in the LEAP study between
peanut wheal size and challenge outcome, maintaining the
trial stratification of negative (0 mm) peanut skin tests
(n = 542) vs a combined group of all infants with ‘positive’
(1–4 mm) peanut skin tests (n = 98), which assumes homo-
geneity of wheal size from 1 to 4 mm and clinical significance
of 1 and 2 mm sensitization, despite an established conven-
tion of clinical significance at 3 mm or greater (17). To test
the
assumption
of
wheal
size
homogeneity
within
the
1–4 mm skin test-positive subgroup, we compared infants
with 1- to 2-mm wheals vs those with 3- to 4-mm wheals for
differences in the rates of successful vs unsuccessful OFCs
within and between the trial arms (Table 1). Within the
avoidance
group,
there
were
no
significant
differences
between 1 and 2 mm vs 3 and 4 mm skin tests (P = 0.7), but

LEAPing through the looking glass
 within the early introduction group there were significant dif-
ferences seen (P = 0.004) and all subjects had successful
OFCs in the 1–2 mm skin test subgroup. Within these wheal
size
subgroups
between
trial
arms,
among
those
with
1–2 mm skin test, 12/32 (37.5%) in the avoidance group vs
0/30 (0%) in the early introduction group had an unsuccess-
ful OFC (P < 0.001), a significant difference in favor of early
introduction. Among those with 3–4 mm skin tests, rates of
unsuccessful OFC were very similar – 6/19 (31.6%) in the
avoidance arm vs 5/17 (29.4%) in the early introduction arm,
which while underpowered represents no difference between
groups. Thus, in univariate subgroup analysis, nearly 70% of
those with a 3- to 4-mm wheal had successful peanut OFC
irrespective of their randomization arm, and the overall
occurrence of unsuccessful OFC was lower in both the 1–2
and 3–4 mm subgroups among the early introduction arm
compared with the avoidance arm.
A multiple logistic regression model was created to explore
the influence of baseline peanut skin test and sIgE, egg skin
test and sIgE, patient age, eczema severity and duration,
race, and gender on the odds of a successful peanut OFC at
month 60, the primary trial endpoint (Table 2A). We noted
significantly higher odds of successful peanut OFC at month
60 with randomization to the early introduction arm, with
each 1-month increase in the infant’s age at introduction of
the intervention, and with white race. Odds of successful
OFC were significantly lower with each 1-mm increase in
peanut wheal skin test size, 1-kUA/l increase in egg sIgE, and
1-point increase in SCORAD score. Age demonstrated a
nonlinear (quadratic) interaction indicative that the age effect
is parabolic, and the probability of successful peanut OFC
increases with increasing age to a point and then decreases.
Additional interactions (and quadratic effects) among the
model variables were assessed and noted to be either non-
significant or not to improve model AUROC with their
inclusion. The overall regression model AUROC was 0.83,
with a sensitivity of 99%, a positive predictive value of 91%,
and correctly classified 90.5% of cases as tolerant of peanut.
An alternative model, using a mild–moderate–severe categori-
cal eczema severity rating variable instead of SCORAD, had
an identical AUROC, nearly identical variable point esti-
mates (and same nonsignificant confounders), and noted only
severe eczema (vs mild or moderate eczema) was associated
with decreased odds of a successful month 60 peanut chal-
lenge (OR 0.2, P = 0.03, 95% CI 0.04–0.87) (Table 2B).
To better isolate subgroup effects influencing month 60
peanut tolerance, predicted probabilities were calculated from
the regression model. We first tested the effect of increasing
peanut wheal size on peanut tolerance at month 60 (Fig. 1).
This demonstrates that within the early introduction arm, the
probability of a successful OFC diminishes somewhat mini-
mally with increasing wheal size, ranging from 98% at 0 mm
to 83% at 4 mm. In contrast, in the avoidance arm, the
probability rapidly declines from 86% at 0 mm to 43% at
4 mm. A second predicted probability investigated the effect
of increasing age at the time of peanut introduction on
month 60 peanut tolerance within the early introduction
group. (Fig. 2A) This demonstrates an overall high predicted
probability of successful OFC at month 60 across all trial
ages of introduction, but a significantly lower probability
between 4 and 6 months of life compared with between 6
and 11 months. The 95% CIs were widest at 4–5 months of

 age, and very narrow at the other ages. As a sensitivity anal-
ysis, we demonstrated the predicted probabilities at 4 and
5 months are highly susceptible to variable inclusion in the
model and the 95% CIs remain constantly wide, although
the probabilities and CIs for introduction between 6 and
11 months remain virtually unchanged. While the probability
at 4–6 months is 92% in the model detailed in Table 2, an
alternative model which approximates the clinical considera-
tions in the NIAID addendum (which include only peanut
wheal size, age, and eczema severity as considerations) noted
this probability dips to 86%, with a model AUROC of 0.8
(Fig. 2B). Importantly, irrespective of model, the probability
of tolerance was consistently higher (and CIs the narrowest)
with introduction between 6 and 11 months of life, relative
to introduction at 4–5 months. Additional predicted proba-
bilities were calculated for SCORAD score, eczema severity,
and race, detailed in Fig. S1A–D. These analyses demon-
strate limited impact of increasing SCORAD score or severe
eczema categorization on the predicted probability of tolerat-
ing the month 60 peanut OFC in the early introduction arm.
As well, these suggest a mildly diminished predicted probabil-
ity of peanut tolerance for non-white race, worse at 4–
5 months of introduction than at other ages, as well as a
more pronounced reduced probability of peanut tolerance for
non-white race based on an increased SCORAD score.
Discussion
In this secondary analysis of the publically available LEAP
trial data, we describe the relationship between reported pre-
randomization risk factors and the primary outcome of pea-
nut tolerance at age 5 and also highlight multiple distinct
and highly significant subgroup effects not described in the
initial Du Toit et al. trial publication (11). The predictive
model may help the practicing allergist to better understand
patient attributes that most critically influence the end-trial
outcome of peanut tolerance, which as per our model is pre-
dominantly early peanut introduction. The subgroup effects
strongly support early peanut introduction and better high-
light that the true value of the prerandomization peanut skin
test wheal size and eczema severity was of most importance
in predicting OFC outcome among the avoidance group.
This distinctly highlights worse and divergent outcomes for
those children randomized to avoid peanut at each incremen-
tal peanut wheal size (or SCORAD score) vs those who had
early introduction. This demonstrated effect raises questions
as to the value of performing skin testing in children where

 introduction to only those with severe eczema (as opposed to
all eczema severity).
Moreover, we also demonstrate an optimal window for the
specific timing of peanut introduction that is several months
wide. The highest predicted probability of peanut tolerance
occurred with peanut introduction between 6 and 11 months
of life, which withstood sensitivity analysis. Arguably, the
probability of tolerance is not lower than 85% with introduc-
tion at 4 and 5 months even in the most conservative model,
which would be supportive of a policy suggesting peanut
should be introduced starting as early as 4–6 months of life.
However, peanut introduction between 6 and 11 months of life
was consistently associated with better outcome (~95% proba-
bility of tolerance, with a very narrow 95% CI) in all models.
From a policy standpoint, waiting until at least 6 months for
introduction may perhaps better harmonize with WHO guide-
lines of 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding. This would create
a ‘win-win’ situation maximizing the potential benefits of both
interventions, which would not potentially elevate a rather nar-
row and singular benefit of early peanut introduction before
6 months over the many positive outcomes associated with
6 months of exclusive breastfeeding and will integrate well
with nutritional milestones of the infant.
These additional data from this secondary analysis can be
helpful to inform future policy, or fine-tune existing policy to
ensure that the implementation of early peanut introduction
is as feasible as possible for the clinician. It is crucial to
understand the true impact of specific risk factors, advise an
appropriate starting time, and optimize any health services
utilizations to help facilitate introduction (12). In this vein,
we show that so long as the infant received peanut early, the
stipulated risks of eczema severity (either through SCORAD
score or categorical rating) and baseline peanut sensitization
imparted little leverage against the development of peanut
tolerance. Figures 1 and S1 in particular highlight this mod-
erating effect, and it should be emphasized that 85% of
infants with a peanut wheal of 4 mm successfully tolerated
peanut OFC, including for subjects with high SCORAD or
severe eczema. We would hope this is reassuring for the prac-
ticing clinician. Properly interpreting these risks will be key
for optimizing the implementation of any forthcoming policy.
The more pressing concern from the trial may be the degree
of potential missed benefit of early peanut introduction
among those excluded from the trial with wheal sizes >4 mm
(15). The recommendations in the forthcoming NIAID Food
Allergy Guideline Addendum recommends an 8-mm peanut
wheal size cutoff as opposed to 4 mm, but it is unclear how
the practicing allergist will apply such guidance, and if even
this expanded cutoff is warranted (18).
These data suggesting a window of 6–11 months for poten-
tial early peanut introduction are also of clinical relevance.
Introduction between 6 and 11 months has a ~95% probabil-
ity of tolerance in all models. The issue is again how any pol-
icy would be implemented. A longer time window for
successful peanut introduction, up to almost the end of the
first year of life without adversely affecting predicted toler-
ance, should reassure providers and hesitant caregivers wary
to attempt peanut introduction between 4 and 6 months that
slight delay will make little difference to the outcome.
Notwithstanding the better harmonization with WHO guid-
ance on duration of exclusive breastfeeding, a longer window
for introduction may give the infant more time to develop a
fondness for eating and comfort with textures/tastes, and
allow more familiarity for assessing the child’s behavior with
foods. This would give a clear distinction in what are normal
eating behaviors (e.g. spit up, perceived gag, irritation-type
rashes) and clearly abnormal ones so that peanut is not
removed from the diet prematurely and ‘allergy’ overascribed
to insignificant events. In this vein, it is important to main-
tain a perspective that the introduction of solid food is part
of normal development and not a medical event. A recent
study noted <0.5% of US infants have peanut introduced by
5 months and <20% by 12 months according to data from
the Infant Feeding Practices II study 2014, despite 2008 AAP
recommendations to not delay solid food introduction past
4–6 months of life (19). These additional few months may
also be of significant benefit given the contrasting experience
in the Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT) trial, where only
61.9% of children under 6 months of age were able to com-
ply with early introduction of peanut (11, 20). The EAT trial
may reflect the more ‘real-world’ scenario.
Our analysis has distinct limitations. Many are limitations
of the primary LEAP study. One such main limitation is lack
of outcome data available on children with >4 mm wheal sizes
as these children were excluded from study, making the wheal
size vs outcome relationship in Fig. 1 difficult to extrapolate
as to where the predicted probability curve may have an
inflection point toward unfavorable outcomes. Another key
limitation is that the data available in the TrialShare data set
do not include all potentially collected study variables. Vari-
ables of interest that were not available include maternal diet
during pregnancy, lactation status, and other trends that were
described in the LEAP nutrition paper, including effects of
dietary diversity. Thus, our models will need to be revised,
and updated analysis submitted, if these additional data
become available. Their future inclusion may potentially add
to our understanding of what influences the development of
peanut tolerance. Another limitation was that in the original
LEAP analysis, egg allergy and eczema were presumed to have
equal weight as a risk factor for developing peanut allergy, a
factor which we could not empirically test the accuracy of in
our models. Of concern is that only egg allergy and not any
other food allergy was considered as a risk factor. This is
important given little historical evidence children <6 months
of age have robust enough routine dietary egg exposure for
there to be an appreciable rate of clinical egg allergy (as
opposed to having egg sensitization) (20–26). Other limitations
of the LEAP study applicable to our secondary analysis were
that skin test cutoffs, dose/duration of the study, and use of
skin testing were chosen a priori and were neither randomized
nor controlled, and the study sample is clustered as it was
obtained at a single food allergy referral center in the UK,
and that we have no data available for outcomes of children
older than 11 months. All of these limitations may limit gener-
alizability of our findings in this analysis to different samples
or populations.

LEAPing through the looking glass
Greenhawt et al.
 In conclusion, we show novel and significant relationships
that are associated with the likelihood of peanut tolerance at
60 months among infants randomized to early peanut intro-
duction or prolonged delayed introduction, using the publi-
cally available original LEAP data. These data further
emphasize the heterogeneity of the treatment effect of early
vs delayed peanut introduction, that wheal size was of far
more utility in predicting less favorable OFC outcomes only
in the avoidance group, and that introduction after 6 months
of life was associated with a higher probability of successful
peanut OFC at month 60 compared with introduction before
6 months. These data strongly emphasize a risk-reducing
effect of early peanut introduction and will hopefully provide
reassurance to parents and providers concerned with possible
pre-existing peanut sensitization, or the difficulties of intro-
ducing peanut so quickly and in such a narrow window after
complementary feeding begins. These secondary analyses
should be viewed as enhancing the potential benefit of early
peanut introduction, and complementary to forthcoming pol-
icy on implementing peanut allergy prevention strategies at a
national or international level.
