Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neu-
rodevelopmental disorder that affects individuals across the 
lifespan. ADHD medication use among pregnant women is 
increasing (1), but consensus about the safety of ADHD medi-
cation use during pregnancy is lacking. Given that nearly half 
of U.S. pregnancies are unintended (2), and early pregnancy 
is a critical period for fetal development, examining trends in 
ADHD medication prescriptions among reproductive-aged 
women is important to quantify the population at risk for 
potential exposure. CDC used the Truven Health MarketScan 
Commercial Database* for the period 2003–2015 to estimate 
the percentage of women aged 15–44 years with private 
employer-sponsored insurance who filled prescriptions for 
ADHD medications each year. The percentage of reproduc-
tive-aged women who filled at least one ADHD medication 
prescription increased 344% from 2003 (0.9% of women) to 
2015 (4.0% of women). In 2015, the most frequently filled 
medications were mixed amphetamine salts, lisdexamfetamine, 
and methylphenidate. Prescribing ADHD medications to 
reproductive-aged women is increasingly common; additional 
research on ADHD medication safety during pregnancy is 
warranted to inform women and their health care providers 
about any potential risks associated with ADHD medication 
exposure before and during pregnancy.
CDC used the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial 
Database to examine outpatient pharmacy prescription drug 
claims for ADHD medications among reproductive-aged 
(15–44 years) women during 2003–2015. These data repre-
sent a convenience sample of persons with private employer-
sponsored insurance and their dependents in the United States. 
Demographic data are available for all persons enrolled at any 
point during the year, regardless of whether a claim is filed, 
and are linkable to submitted outpatient pharmacy claims. 
This analysis was restricted to women aged 15–44 years with 
≥11 months of enrollment in a private health insurance plan 
that included prescription drug coverage during the year of 
interest. Outpatient pharmacy claims for ADHD medications 
were identified using national drug codes, irrespective of the 
indication for use. Data were analyzed to assess the annual 
percentage of reproductive-aged women who filled any ADHD

medication prescription during 2003–2015, as well as by 
age group, U.S. geographic region, and medication class. To 
examine time trends, the percentage change in the percentage 
of reproductive-aged women dispensed ADHD medications 
from 2003 to 2015 was estimated. Among women who filled 
at least one ADHD medication prescription in the given year, 
CDC examined the distribution of specific medications and 
average number of prescriptions filled per year.
Approximately 2.3–6.8 million privately insured reproduc-
tive-aged women constituted the analytic sample each year 
during 2003–2015 (median = 4.6 million). The percentage 
of reproductive-aged women with private employer-sponsored 
insurance who filled a prescription for any ADHD medica-
tion increased 344% from 2003 (0.9%) to 2015 (4.0%). 
The increase in the percentage of women prescribed ADHD 
medications was confined to a rise in the prescribing of stimu-
lant medications† (388% increase from 2003 to 2015); the 
percentage of women prescribed the nonstimulant medication 
atomoxetine was stable over time (0% change from 2003 to 
2015) (Figure).
The percentage of reproductive-aged women who filled a 
prescription for any ADHD medication increased over time for 
all age groups and geographic regions (Table 1). In 2015, the 
highest percentage of ADHD medication prescriptions filled 
among reproductive-aged women were for those aged 15–19 
(5.4%), 20–24 (5.5%), and 25–29 (4.0%) years. From 2003 
to 2015, the largest increase in ADHD prescriptions filled 
occurred among women aged 25–29 years (700%). In 2015, 
the highest percentage of ADHD medication prescriptions 
were filled by reproductive-aged women who resided in the 
South (4.8%) and North Central (4.0%) U.S. regions; the larg-
est increase from 2003 to 2015 occurred in the South (380%).
In 2015, among reproductive-aged women who filled any 
ADHD prescription, 60.8% filled a prescription for mixed 
amphetamine salts, 26.7% filled a prescription for lisdexam-
fetamine, and 18.1% filled a prescription for methylphenidate 
(Table 2). Among reproductive-aged women who filled any 
ADHD medication prescription in the given year, the percent-
age who filled a prescription for mixed amphetamine salts and 
† In this analysis, stimulant medications include amphetamine, mixed 
amphetamine salts, dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, 
methamphetamine, methylphenidate, and pemoline.

 * Women aged 15–44 years enrolled ≥11 months per year in a plan that includes prescription drug coverage were defined as “eligible.”
 † The same woman could be included in multiple years of data.
 § Percentage of privately insured reproductive-aged women with each ADHD prescription medication dispensed was calculated among eligible women with at least 
one prescription filled for any ADHD medication in the given year.
 ¶ Not mutually exclusive; percentages might sum to >100% because multiple medications might have been prescribed to individual women within 1 calendar year. 
The first eight medications are stimulant ADHD medications and the last medication (atomoxetine) is a nonstimulant ADHD medication; these were the medications 
searched for in this analysis.
 ** Lisdexamfetamine was first approved by the FDA in 2007; pemoline was discontinued in 2005.
 †† Among privately insured reproductive-aged women with at least one ADHD medication filled; this calculation is based on the average number of prescriptions 
filled each year from any type of ADHD medication.
lisdexamfetamine increased from 2003 to 2015, while the 
percentage who filled a prescription for methylphenidate and 
atomoxetine decreased over the same period. Among women 
who filled any ADHD medication prescription, the average 
number of prescriptions filled for any ADHD medication per 
year rose from an average of 5.5 prescriptions in 2003 (standard 
deviation [SD] = 4.4) to 7.2 in 2015 (SD = 5.1).
Discussion
The percentage of reproductive-aged women with private 
employer-sponsored insurance that included drug coverage 
who filled an ADHD medication prescription increased 344% 
from 2003 to 2015. In 2015, 4.0% of reproductive-aged 
women in this large convenience sample filled an ADHD medi-
cation prescription. A rise in stimulant ADHD medication 
prescriptions accounted for this increase; prescriptions for the 
nonstimulant atomoxetine have remained stable since 2003. 
The substantial increase in the percentage of reproductive-aged 
women filling ADHD medication prescriptions from 2003 
to 2015, across age groups and U.S. geographic regions, is 
of public health concern given the high percentage of unin-
tended pregnancies (2) and uncertainty concerning the safety 
of ADHD medication exposure before and during pregnancy 
(3). In studies with samples of U.S. pregnant women, ADHD 
medication use estimates have ranged from 0.4% (2000–2013 
data) (4) to 1.3% (2013 data) (1). Although evidence is 
limited and findings are mixed (3), ADHD medication use 
during pregnancy might be linked to increased risk for poor 
pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion (5,6). 
The safety of ADHD medications with regard to risk for birth 
defects is largely unknown, with only one sufficiently powered 
published study (4).
ADHD medication prescription trends among reproductive-
aged women in non-U.S. populations align with CDC’s 
findings that an increased percentage of women are filling 
ADHD medication prescriptions, with the highest percentage 
among younger reproductive-aged women. In an analysis of 
2003–2008 data from the United Kingdom (7), the preva-
lence of ADHD medication prescriptions increased over time 
among women aged 18–24 years (from 0.12 to 0.34 per 
1,000 women) and women aged 25–45 years (from 0.01 to 
0.05 per 1,000 women). In an analysis of Canadian adults 
during 2005–2015 (8), the prevalence of ADHD medica-
tion prescriptions increased over time for men and women 
aged 18–25 years (from 0.7% in 2005 to 3.2% in 2015) and 
26–35 years (from 0.3% in 2005 to 1.6% in 2015). CDC’s

estimates were higher than those from the United Kingdom 
and Canadian data sets, which might reflect higher ADHD 
medication prescribing in the United States or differences in the 
types of ADHD medications either prescribed across countries 
or included in the analyses. Most adult ADHD medication 
use prevalence estimates use older data (5,7), whereas results 
from this analysis demonstrate a continued increase in ADHD 
medication prescribing into 2015.
CDC’s findings indicate that mixed amphetamine salts, lis-
dexamfetamine, and methylphenidate are among the ADHD 
medications most commonly prescribed to privately insured 
U.S. reproductive-aged women. In the United States, mixed 
amphetamine salts and methylphenidate are the most fre-
quently prescribed ADHD medications among children (9) 
and pregnant women (1). Data from this analysis similarly 
suggests that mixed amphetamine salts and methylphenidate 
are two of the three most commonly prescribed medications 
among reproductive-aged women. However, in this analysis, 
lisdexamfetamine, which was approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration in 2007, was the second most commonly 
prescribed medication among reproductive-aged women. This 
is noteworthy given that most analyses that have examined 
ADHD medication safety among women before and during 
pregnancy have not included lisdexamfetamine as a medica-
tion of interest (3–6).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi-
tations. First, although this analysis included 2.3–6.8 million 
reproductive-aged women per year, data are from a convenience 
sample of privately insured women with prescription drug 
coverage. Approximately 45% of U.S. births occur to women 
with Medicaid coverage (10); ADHD medication prevalence 
estimates might differ between publicly and privately insured 
women of reproductive age. Second, data are based on out-
patient pharmacy claims and no information is available on 
women who paid for prescriptions out-of-pocket or who 
obtained ADHD medications from someone other than their 
prescribing physician. Third, although data represent ADHD 
medications dispensed, verification that women took the medi-
cations after the prescription was filled is not available. Finally, 
this analysis focused on women aged 15–44 years and did not 
identify pregnant women or women’s risk for pregnancy.
This analysis used a large database to estimate the percent-
age of privately insured reproductive-aged women who filled 
an ADHD medication prescription during 2003–2015. The 
increasing trend toward prescribing ADHD medications 
to reproductive-aged women highlights the importance of 
research examining ADHD medication safety in this popula-
tion, including safety before and during pregnancy. CDC’s 
Treating for Two: Safer Medication Use in Pregnancy initiative 
(https://www.cdc.gov/treatingfortwo) helps address this need 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication use 
has increased among U.S. pregnant women, and consensus 
about its safety during pregnancy is lacking. Given that half of 
U.S. pregnancies are unintended, ADHD medication use among 
reproductive-aged women might result in early pregnancy 
exposure, a critical period for fetal development.
What is added by this report?
The percentage of privately insured reproductive-aged 
women who filled a prescription for an ADHD medication 
increased 344% from 2003 (0.9%) to 2015 (4.0%). ADHD 
medication prescriptions increased across all age groups and 
U.S. geographic regions, and the increase was confined to 
stimulant medications.
What are the implications for public health practice?
ADHD medication prescriptions are increasingly common 
among privately insured, reproductive-aged women. Additional 
research on ADHD medication safety among this population, 
including safety before and during pregnancy, could help 
women and their health care providers make evidence-based 
decisions concerning the risks and benefits of pharmacologic 
and behavioral treatment options for common conditions, 
including ADHD.
by conducting research on medication safety before and during 
pregnancy to help women and their health care providers make 
evidence-based decisions regarding the risks and benefits of 
pharmacologic and behavioral treatment options for common 
conditions, including ADHD.
