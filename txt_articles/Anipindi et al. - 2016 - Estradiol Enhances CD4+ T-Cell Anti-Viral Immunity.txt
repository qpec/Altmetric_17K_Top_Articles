Abstract
Clinical and experimental studies have shown that estradiol (E2) confers protection against
HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Here, we investigated the underlying mecha-
nism. Better protection in E2-treated mice, immunized against genital HSV-2, coincided
with earlier recruitment and higher proportions of Th1 and Th17 effector cells in the vagina
post-challenge, compared to placebo-treated controls. Vaginal APCs isolated from E2-
treated mice induced 10-fold higher Th17 and Th1 responses, compared to APCs from pro-
gesterone-treated, placebo-treated, and estradiol-receptor knockout mice in APC-T cell co-
cultures. CD11c+ DCs in the vagina were the predominant APC population responsible for
priming these Th17 responses, and a potent source of IL-6 and IL-1β, important factors for
Th17 differentiation. Th17 responses were abrogated in APC-T cell co-cultures containing
IL-1β KO, but not IL-6 KO vaginal DCs, showing that IL-1β is a critical factor for Th17 induc-
tion in the genital tract. E2 treatment in vivo directly induced high expression of IL-1β in vagi-
nal DCs, and addition of IL-1β restored Th17 induction by IL-1β KO APCs in co-cultures.
Finally, we examined the role of IL-17 in anti-HSV-2 memory T cell responses. IL-17 KO
mice were more susceptible to intravaginal HSV-2 challenge, compared to WT controls,
and vaginal DCs from these mice were defective at priming efficient Th1 responses in vitro,
indicating that IL-17 is important for the generation of efficient anti-viral memory responses.
We conclude that the genital mucosa has a unique microenvironment whereby E2
enhances CD4+ T cell anti-viral immunity by priming vaginal DCs to induce Th17 responses
through an IL-1-dependent pathway.

 Author Summary
Female sex hormones can affect susceptibility and immune responses to infections. While
a number of previous studies, including our own, have shown that progesterone and pro-
gesterone-derived hormonal contraceptives increase susceptibility and impair immune
responses, estradiol protects against sexually transmitted infections. The reason why estra-
diol is protective remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of estradiol on
dendritic cells, specialized immune cells that determine what type of anti-viral cellular
immune responses will be mounted following infection with a sexually transmitted virus,
HSV-2. Our studies show that estradiol influences dendritic cells in the vaginal tract of
mice to initiate unique anti-viral T cell immunity that results in better protection against
genital HSV-2 infection. This type of T cell response is unique to the vaginal tract and not
found in any other mucosal lining of the body. This is the first study to show directly that
estradiol, a female sex hormone, can determine how well the immune system will combat
a sexually transmitted viral infection. The information from this study will be very impor-
tant in understanding what type of immunity can protect women from sexually transmit-
ted infections and how we can use this information to develop better vaccines.
Introduction
The female sex hormones estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) play a key role in controlling
development and function of the reproductive tract, but can also regulate susceptibility and
immunity to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) [1–3]. A number of clinical and experimen-
tal studies have shown that the menstrual cycle, hormonal contraceptives, and exogenous hor-
mones can determine susceptibility to HIV-1, HSV-2 and C. trachomatis [2, 4–7]. While P4
and P4-based hormonal contraceptives appear to increase susceptibility and transmission to
sexually transmitted viruses, E2 is generally considered protective. Studies in macaque models
demonstrated that while medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), a P4-based contraceptive,
enhanced susceptibility to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), E2-treatment protected ani-
mals against infection [8, 9]. Studies, including our own, have shown that E2, P4 and hormonal
contraceptives influence the anti-viral immune responses and protection outcomes, in a
murine model of HSV-2 infection [10–15]. Although the mechanism underlying increased sus-
ceptibility to HIV-1 in women using hormonal contraceptives has gained much attention, the
protective effect of E2 remains under-investigated.
HSV-2 is the predominant cause of genital herpes, one of the most prevalent sexually trans-
mitted infections in the world. Over 530 million people worldwide are seropositive for HSV-2
[16], and genital herpes is a known co-factor in the acquisition and transmission of HIV-1
[16]. Currently, there is no known vaccine for HSV-2, and anti-viral formulations only reduce
the incidence and symptoms of recurrences. Attempts to develop vaccines against HSV-2 have
failed since the 1980s [7]. The last large-scale clinical trial of a glycoprotein D based vaccine
showed no efficacy, except for partial protection in a sub-group of women seronegative for
HSV-1 and HSV-2 [17, 18]. These studies emphasize the need to better understand sex-specific
immune responses in the reproductive mucosa, in order to develop effective vaccines against
sexually transmitted infections.
A number of studies have examined factors that affect anti-viral immunity in the female
reproductive tract [2, 19]. Our own studies have demonstrated that intranasal, subcutaneous or
intravaginal immunization with live attenuated thymidine kinase deficient (TK−) HSV-2, in
the presence of P4, led to protection accompanied by excessive genital inflammation and

 pathology post-challenge [13, 14]. However, immunization in the presence of E2 led to signifi-
cantly better protection outcomes: better survival without pathology [13–15]. This protective
effect of E2 was verified by others, using an HSV-2 subunit-based glycoprotein gD vaccine can-
didate [10]. Based on these studies, we hypothesized that the differences in protection quality
may be due to the influence of sex hormones on the function of antigen presenting cells
(APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs) in the female genital tract. Vaginal DCs have been exam-
ined in a limited number of studies. Four groups of Langerhans cells were characterized in the
murine vagina by immunohistochemistry: I-A+ F4/80+, I-A+ F4/80−, I-A− CD205+ and I-A+
CD205− [20]. In a separate study, using flow cytometry, CD11c+ MHCII+ DCs in the vaginal
epithelium were identified as CD11b+ F4/80hi, CD11b+ F4/80int, and CD11b− F4/80− subsets
[21]. The same group also described a network of CD11c+ CD11b+ MHCII+ DCs in the vaginal
lamina propria [22]. The frequency and distribution of these immune cells were shown to alter
with the stage of the hormone cycle [23]. CD11c+ MHCII+ DCs in the vaginal epithelium were
distributed abundantly during the metestrus and diestrus phases, but were only found sparsely
during the estrus phase. Furthermore, Langerhans cells near the lumen were missing during
the estrus phase and only found during the diestrus and matestrus phases [22].
Previous studies have shown that vaginal DCs may be key to the development of CD4+ T
cell responses against HSV-2 [24], and both E2 and P4 can modulate DC phenotype and func-
tions [25, 26]. It is well documented that alterations in DC functions can shape CD4+ T cell-
mediated adaptive immune responses [27, 28]. For example, IL-12, IL-15, and TNF-α pro-
duced by DCs can bias Th0 cells towards Th1 effectors, while TSLP, IL-33, and IL-25 can lead
to Th2 responses. Similarly, TGF-β, IL-10, retinoic acid, and the expression of PDL-1 by DCs
can prime T regulatory cells, while IL-6, TGF-β, IL-1 and IL-23 can induce Th17 differentiation
[28, 29]. Therefore, we examined whether E2 can directly influence vaginal DCs to direct the
differentiation of CD4+ T cells, and consequently alter the profile of anti-viral T cell responses.
The role of Th1 effectors in HSV-2 anti-viral immunity has been well-described [30]. In
brief, IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells are critical, as demonstrated by studies where the depletion of
CD4+ T cells and neutralization of IFN-γ, compromised protection against HSV-2 [31]; the
administration of exogenous IFN-γ restored protection to CD4+ T cell deficient mice [32]. Th2
cells and Tregs may lack a direct anti-viral role in the HSV-2 mouse model [33], but the latter
have been implicated in facilitating the efficient influx of immune cells such as NK cells, DCs
and T cells to the vagina post-primary infection [34]. IL-17, primarily produced by Th17 cells,
is a normal response of the immune system to C. albicans and N. gonorrheae infections in the
vagina [35, 36]. However, the role of Th17 effector responses in viral infections of the genital
mucosa has not been clearly defined.
In the current study, we examined the mechanism underlying the enhanced protection out-
comes seen under the influence of E2 in the HSV-2 vaccine model. We observed earlier recruit-
ment, and increased proportions, of Th17 and Th1 effector cells post-challenge in the vagina of
E2-treated immunized mice. E2 treatment directly conditioned vaginal CD11c+ APCs to
induce Th17 responses through an IL-1-dependent, but IL-6-independent, pathway. Further-
more, the ability of vaginal CD11c+ APCs to induce predominantly Th17 responses was distinct
compared to APCs from spleen and other mucosa, suggesting that the hormonal conditioning
of APCs is unique to the genital mucosa.
Results
E2 treatment enhances protection against WT genital HSV-2 challenge
We have previously shown that intranasal immunization of ovariectomized (OVX) E2-treated
mice with live attenuated TK− HSV-2, leads to optimal protection with minimal pathology

 post-challenge, compared to hormone-naïve OVX controls [14]. We wanted to determine
whether enhanced protection would also be seen in E2-treated mice immunized with non-live
virus vaccine formulations such as an HSV-2 glycoprotein subunit (gD), or a heat-inactivated
(HI) HSV-2. OVX mice implanted with 21-day release E2 pellets, were intranasally immunized
with HSV-2 gD + CpG, HI HSV-2 + CpG, or live attenuated TK− HSV-2, and 6 weeks later,
challenged intravaginally (IVAG) with a lethal dose of wild type (WT) HSV-2 333. Survival,
genital pathology and viral shedding were monitored post-challenge. The control group of
OVX mice was implanted with placebo pellets (mock), but underwent similar immunization
and challenge. E2 treatment was associated with 80% survival against lethal HSV-2 challenge
in the TK− HSV-2 vaccine group, and 75% survival in the gD + CpG and HI HSV-2 + CpG vac-
cine groups (Fig 1A). However, only 30% of mock controls survived lethal challenge in the TK−
HSV-2 vaccine group, while none survived in the gD + CpG or HI HSV-2 + CpG vaccine
groups (Fig 1A). Better survival in E2-treated mice corresponded with lower cumulative
pathology scores (Table 1), and fewer mice shedding virus on any given day post-challenge
(Fig 1C), compared to mock controls (Fig 1B and 1C). Overall, consistent with our previous
report [14], these results show that immunization under the influence of E2 enhanced protec-
tion by improving survival, and diminishing disease pathology and viral shedding post-chal-
lenge, regardless of the vaccine formulation.
E2 treatment leads to earlier recruitment and higher proportion of Th1
and Th17 cells in the vagina
HSV-2–specific IFN-γ-producing Th1 CD4+ T cells are known to play a critical role in the reso-
lution of intravaginal HSV-2 infection in the mouse model [31, 32]. We wanted to examine
whether improved protection in E2-treated mice was related to enhanced Th1 responses in the
vagina, post-challenge. OVX mice treated with E2 or placebo (mock) pellets were immunized
intranasally with TK− HSV-2, and challenged 6-weeks later, intravaginally, with WT HSV-2
333. Vaginal tissue from each group of mice was pooled, and the phenotype of CD4+ T cells
was examined on days 1, 3 and 5 post-challenge (p.c.). CD4+ T cells were gated based on total
CD3+ cells in the vagina (Fig 2A), and the profile of mucosal memory CD4+ T cells (CD44+
CD103+) was compared between E2 and mock treatment groups. Vaginal tissue from
E2-treated mice contained higher proportions of mucosal memory CD4+ T cells at all three
time points compared to mock controls (Fig 2B). To compare functional differences in the
CD4+ T cells between these groups, IFN-γ and IL-17 expression in these cells was examined by
intracellular staining (ICS). E2-treated mice showed a higher proportion of IFN-γ+ Th1 and IL-
17+ Th17 cells at earlier time points (days 1 and 3 p.c.) (Fig 2C and Table 2). On day 5 p.c.,
while a higher proportion of Th17 cells was still present in the vagina of E2-treated mice com-
pared to the mock controls, fewer Th1 cells were observed in E2-treated mice, likely due to ear-
lier clearance of virus. Following in vitro stimulation with PMA and ionomycin, a higher
proportion of total Th1 and Th17 cells was seen in E2-treated mice compared to mock controls
at all three time points (D1, D3 and D5 p.c.) (Table 2). Overall, these observations suggest that
E2 treatment augments anti-viral responses in the female genital tract by accelerating, and
enhancing, Th1 and Th17 responses post-challenge.
Vaginal cells from E2-treated mice induce IL-17 and IFN-γ from T cells in
APC-T cell co-cultures
Since E2-treated mice demonstrated accelerated, and greater Th1 and Th17 responses, we next
wanted to examine whether E2 influences CD4+ T cell responses by conditioning vaginal
APCs. OVX mice were implanted with E2 or placebo (mock) pellets, and two weeks later,

 vaginal tissue cells (TC) containing all local APCs were isolated and pulsed with 5x105 pfu/ml
ultraviolet (UV)-inactivated HSV-2 for 16 hours. These TC were co-cultured for 3.5 days with
CD4+ T cells (TC + HSV-2 CD4) isolated from the draining lymph nodes and vaginal tracts of
OVX mice immunized and challenged intravaginally with HSV-2, to determine the influence
of E2 on HSV-2 specific T cell responses. To determine if E2 treatment would influence non-
specific CD4+ T cell responses, co-cultures were done with naïve CD4+ T cells (TC + control
CD4) isolated from the spleen of uninfected OVX mice, as detailed in the Materials and Meth-
ods section. T cell responses were determined by measuring IL-17 levels (mean ± SD) in co-cul-
ture supernatants by ELISA. IL-17 levels were significantly increased in co-cultures containing
TC from E2-treated mice and CD4+ T cells from HSV-2 challenged mice, following in vitro
HSV-2 challenge, indicating an HSV-2 specific T cell response (Fig 3A). IL-17 levels were high
in all co-cultures containing TC from E2-treated mice, regardless of whether T cells were from
HSV-2 challenged mice or naïve T cells. In comparison, co-cultures containing TC from mock
(OVX) mice had little to no IL-17, regardless of the source of T cells. Only in co-cultures con-
taining CD4+ T cells from HSV-2 challenged mice, low levels of IL-17 were detected following
in vitro challenge, but this was significantly lower than that seen in E2 TC co-cultures (Fig 3A).

Cumulative pathology is calculated by denoting the number of mice with their maximum pathology score and the number of days that score was observed
for each group. This takes into consideration that each mouse in a group can reach varying degrees of pathology through the experiment. Average
pathology score per mouse was calculated by dividing the sum of cumulative pathology by total number of mice.

 Overall, these results indicate that APCs in the E2-treated vaginal tissue are uniquely condi-
tioned to induce differentiation of CD4+ T cells towards Th17.
Given the practical challenge of obtaining sufficient numbers of CD4+ T cells from HSV-2
immunized/challenged mice and the low HSV-2 specific T cell responses seen in previous
experiments, we next determined if this phenomenon of E2-conditioned Th17 responses could
be observed using a previously well-described chicken ovalbumin (OVA) peptide model with
OVA-specific OT-II transgenic (Tg) CD4+ T cells [37]. OVX mice were implanted with E2, P4,
or placebo (mock) pellets, and two-weeks later, vaginal tissue cells containing all local APCs
were isolated, pulsed with OVA peptide, and co-cultured with CFSE-stained OT-II Tg CD4+ T
cells (TC+CD4), as detailed in the Materials and Methods section. To examine Th1 and Th17
differentiation in these co-cultures, IFN-γ and IL-17 levels (mean ± SD) in culture supernatants
were measured by ELISA. While there were no differences in CD4+ T cell proliferation between
E2, P4 or mock cultures (Fig 3B), the supernatants from co-cultures containing TC from
Fig 2. E2 pre-treatment enhances the recruitment of CD103+ CD44+ CD4+ T cells in the vagina, and is related to increased proportions of Th1 and
Th17 cells, post-challenge. WT OVX mice implanted with E2 or placebo pellets (mock) (n = 5–10 mice/group in all three time points: D1, D3 and D5 p.c.),
were immunized intranasally with 1x103 pfu/mouse TK− HSV-2, and five weeks later, challenged intravaginally with 5x103 pfu WT HSV-2 333. Vaginal
tissues isolated at D1, D3 and D5 post challenge (p.c.), from each group were pooled, processed and stained with a panel of antibodies against CD3, CD4,
CD8, CD44, CD103, IL-17 and IFN-γ according to protocols detailed in the Materials and Methods section, and examined by flow cytometry. (A) CD8- CD4+ T
cells were gated among total CD3+ T cells in the vagina. (B) The proportion of mucosal memory CD103+ CD44+ T cells from tissues isolated on days 1, 3 and
5 p.c. were compared between E2- and placebo (mock)-treated mice. (C) For intracellular staining of IL-17 and IFN-γ, vaginal cells pooled from n = 5 mice per
group, at days 1, 3 and 5 p.c, were incubated in the presence of golgi inhibitors alone to examine the in vivo response to HSV-2 challenge, or stimulated in
vitro with cell stimulation cocktail (CSC) containing golgi inhibitors and PMA + ionomycin, for 18h. Intracellular staining for IL-17 and IFN-γ was used to
examine the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th17 and Th1 cells, respectively. A representative of this data from day 3 p.c. is shown. Data is representative
of two independent experiments.

 E2-treated mice had > 7 to 18-fold higher IL-17 and 12-fold higher IFN-γ levels, compared
to co-cultures containing TC from P4- and mock (placebo)-treated mice (Fig 3C) (IL-17 in
TC+CD4: (E2: 6297 ± 974 pg/mL; P4: 805.6 ± 82 pg/mL; mock: 349 ± 76 pg/mL); IFN-γ in
TC+CD4: (E2: 996 ± 331 pg/mL; P4: 79 ± 19 pg/mL; mock: 61 ± 26 pg/mL)). Intracellular
staining on day 2 of co-cultures showed that over 70% of proliferating CFSE-stained OT-II Tg
CD4+ T cells in E2-treated vaginal TC co-cultures expressed IL-17 and ROR-γt, the master-reg-
ulator transcription factor for Th17 cells, showing that Th17 cells were the primary source of
IL-17 in these co-cultures (Fig 3D). These results indicated that co-cultures utilizing OT-II Tg
CD4+ T cells and OVA peptide could be used to examine the effect of E2 on vaginal APCs in
further experiments.
The E2-dependent induction of Th17 responses by vaginal tissue cells has not been
described previously. Given this unique observation, we examined hormone-dependent Th17
differentiation further. Both E2 and P4 are continually present in the reproductive tract, albeit
in different ratios, throughout the different phases of the reproductive cycle [38]. We wanted
to examine if the differential conditioning of vaginal APCs to induce Th17 responses could be
observed in the vagina of mice during the normal reproductive cycle. Co-cultures were con-
ducted with vaginal TC isolated from mice in estrus (E2-dominant) or diestrus (P4-dominant)
stages, while vaginal TC from OVX mice served as a control. Vaginal TC from mice in estrus
induced over 3- to 4-fold higher IL-17 levels in co-cultures compared to TC from mice in dies-
trus or OVX controls (Fig 3E) (Estrus: 23827 ± 2452 pg/mL; Diestrus: 8248 ± 3244 pg/mL;
OVX: 5744 ± 1573 pg/mL). This suggests that although E2 is present throughout the reproduc-
tive cycle, changes in E2 levels during the estrus cycle may be sufficient to condition vaginal
APCs to prime differential Th17 responses.
To confirm the role of E2, IL-17 levels were compared between co-cultures conducted with
vaginal TC from estrogen receptor knockout (ERKO) mice, and a pooled group of WT mice at
different stages of the reproductive cycle. Vaginal cells from ERKO mice induced 12-fold lower
IL-17 levels compared to WT controls (WT: 6837 ± 1938 pg/mL; ERKO: 559 ± 58 pg/mL), con-
firming that E2 is critical for the priming of Th17 responses by vaginal TC (Fig 3F). Interest-
ingly, ERKO spleen TC co-cultures contained significantly higher IL-17 levels compared to
WT controls (WT: 364 ± 61 pg/mL; ERKO: 828 ± 121 pg/mL) (Fig 3F). This suggests that the
E2 conditioning of APCs to induce Th17 responses may be limited to the vagina.

 Fig 3. E2 can influence the differentiation of CD4+ T cells in vaginal APC-T cell co-cultures. (A) OVX WT mice were implanted with E2 or placebo
(mock) pellets, and two weeks later, vaginal tissue cells (TC) were isolated and pulsed with 5x105 pfu/ml UV-inactivated HSV-2 for 16h. These TC were co-
cultured for 3.5 days with HSV-2 specific CD4+ T cells (TC + HSV-2 CD4) isolated by MACS from the draining lymph nodes and vaginal tracts of HSV-2
immunized and challenged mice. For control co-cultures, naïve CD4+ T cells (TC + control CD4) were isolated from the spleen of uninfected OVX mice. IL-17
levels in co-culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. (B) Vaginal tissue cells (TC) (5x105 cells/ml) from OVX mice (n = 6 mice/group) implanted with
E2, P4, or placebo pellets (mock) were pulsed with OVA peptide and co-cultured with OT-II Tg CD4+ T cells (TC+CD4) (5x105 cells/ml) for 3.5 days.
Proliferation of CD4+ T cells was compared among co-cultures conducted with TC from E2-, P4- or placebo (mock)-treated mice. (C) IL-17 and IFN-γ levels in
co-culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. Data is mean±SD of three individual co-culture wells from one of three separate experiments with similar

γ, and analyzed on a flow cytometer. (E) Vaginal tissues from ovary-intact mice were pooled depending on the stage of their reproductive cycle (n = 6 mice/

 Overall, these results indicate that E2-conditioned vaginal cells induce the differentiation of
CD4+ T cells into IL-17-producing Th17 cells. Furthermore, endogenous levels of E2 through-
out the reproductive cycle appeared sufficient to prime vaginal APCs for induction of Th17
responses. Therefore, in the following experiments, we pooled mice from all stages of their nor-
mal reproductive cycle so that we could conduct experiments with larger n numbers.
Vaginal CD11c+ DCs are potent inducers of Th17 responses
Next, we wanted to identify the specific APC populations in the vagina that were responsible
for priming these Th17 responses. DCs, broadly classified as CD11c+ cells, macrophages
(CD11c− CD11b+ F4/80+ Gr-1−), neutrophils (CD11c− CD11b+ F4/80− Gr-1+), monocytes
(CD11c− CD11b+ F4/80+ Gr-1+) and other cells (CD11c− CD11b−), were sorted by FACS,
pulsed with OVA peptide, and co-cultured in different ratios with 1x105 OT-II Tg CD4+ T
cells. Vaginal TC, CD11c+ DCs, and macrophages induced a similar degree of CD4+ T cell pro-
liferation in co-cultures (Fig 4A). However, cytokine analysis showed that vaginal CD11c+ DCs
were the primary inducers of IL-17 from T cells in co-cultures (1331 ± 276 pg/mL at 1:2 ratio,
Fig 4B). Macrophages also induced IL-17 levels, albeit 8-fold less in magnitude (170 ± 125 pg/
mL at 1:2 ratio) compared to DCs. Neutrophils, monocytes, and other cells did not induce any
detectable IL-17, showing that DCs and macrophages may be the sole inducers of Th17 differ-
entiation in vitro.
To confirm that CD11c+ DCs were the primary inducers of Th17 responses in the genital
tract, CD11c+ cells were depleted in the vagina by injecting CD11c-DTR mice with 400ng
(200ng IP + 200ng intravaginally) of diphtheria toxin (DT); a separate group of CD11c-DTR
mice treated with PBS were used as controls. Vaginal TC from both these groups were pulsed
with OVA peptide, and co-cultured with OT-II Tg CD4+ T cells. Since Th17 cells are known to
produce IL-22 in addition to IL-17 [39], we measured both in co-culture supernatants. Co-cul-
tures with TC from CD11c-depleted mice (DT group) contained approximately 3.5-fold lower
levels of IL-17 (PBS: 20895 ± 3766 pg/mL; DT: 6152 ± 341 pg/mL), and 2-fold lower levels of
IL-22 (PBS: 134 ± 17 pg/mL; DT: 75 ± 8 pg/mL), compared to TC from CD11c-intact mice
(PBS group) (Fig 4C). Similar to the observations in Fig 3E, co-cultures with splenocytes from
CD11c-depleted mice showed an increase in IL-17 compared to controls.
These findings confirm the role of vaginal CD11c+ DCs in priming Th17 responses (Fig 4B),
and indicate tissue-specific differences in the propensity of APC populations to prime Th17
CD4+ T cell responses.
Given the distinct differences in Th17 responses between vaginal and spleen co-cultures, we
examined whether the potential of vaginal TC or CD11c+ DCs to prime Th17 responses is com-
parable to total cells or CD11c+ DCs from other mucosal tissues, such as the lung or small
intestine. Vaginal, lung and small intestine TC (containing all their respective APC popula-
tions), were pulsed with OVA peptide, co-cultured with OT-II Tg CD4+ T cells, and Th17 cyto-
kines were examined in co-culture supernatants. There were no differences in CD4+ T cell
proliferation among co-cultures of TC+CD4 from all three mucosal tissues; however, vaginal
co-cultures contained over 15-fold higher levels of IL-17 (Vagina: 27780 ± 4051 pg/mL; Lung:
1086 ± 326 pg/mL; Intestine: 1827 ± 878 pg/mL) and 4-fold higher levels of IL-22 (Vagina:
2105 ± 157 pg/mL; Lung: 430 ± 54 pg/mL; Intestine: 331 ± 81 pg/mL), compared to lung or
days. IL-17 levels in co-culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. Data is mean+SD of three individual co-culture wells, representative from one of
three separate experiments with similar results, and significance was calculated by two-way ANOVA (**** p<0.0001). (F) IL-17 levels were compared
among WT and ERKO vaginal and spleen tissue co-cultures. Data is representative of two separate experiments with similar results, and significance was
calculated by two-way ANOVA (*** p = 0.0005).

 Fig 4. Vaginal CD11c+ DCs are the primary inducers of Th17 responses, and are more potent inducers than other mucosal DCs. Vaginal cells from
WT mice (n = 13 mice) were pooled and sorted by FACS, and total vaginal cells, as well as sorted populations, were pulsed with OVA peptide and co-cultured

 intestine TC co-cultures (Fig 4D), suggesting mucosal tissue-specific differences in the ability
of the respective APC populations to prime CD4+ T cell responses.
To directly compare the abilities of vaginal and lung CD11c+ DCs to prime Th17 responses,
CD11c+ and CD11c− cells from both these tissues were sorted, peptide pulsed, and co-cultured
with OT-II Tg CD4+ T cells at a 1:2 ratio of APC:CD4. Vaginal CD11c+ DCs induced 10-fold
higher IL-17 levels compared to lung CD11c+ DCs (Vagina: 7017 ± 577 pg/mL; Lung:
764 ± 105 pg/mL) (Fig 4E). Vaginal total cells (Vagina: 1901 ± 315 pg/mL; Lung: 858 ± 102 pg/
mL) and CD11c− cells (Vagina: 436 ± 109 pg/mL; Lung: 206 ± 70 pg/mL) also induced signifi-
cantly higher levels of IL-17, although not as striking as CD11c+ DCs. In order to examine the
role of CD11c− cells in conditioning the vaginal and lung CD11c+ cells, CD11c+ cells from each
mucosa were mixed with CD11c− cells from the heterologous mucosa in APC:T cell co-cul-
tures. We found that CD11c− cells did not influence the ability of vaginal or lung CD11c+ cells
to prime Th17 responses (Fig 4E: Mixed tissues). Vaginal and lung CD11c+ DCs retained their
respective ability to induce Th17 responses, regardless of the tissue source of CD11c− cells
(Vagina CD11c+ + Lung CD11c−: 7633 ± 307 pg/mL; Lung CD11c+ + Vagina CD11c−:
994 ± 351 pg/mL). This suggests that mucosal DCs are programmed within their respective tis-
sue microenvironment, and a short-term co-culture with cells from other tissues is not suffi-
cient to change their propensity.
To determine if increased Th17 responses seen in E2-treated mice were primarily due to the
effect of E2 on CD11c+ DCs, CD11c+ DCs from the vaginal tracts of E2- and placebo (mock)-
treated mice were sorted, peptide pulsed, and co-cultured with OT-II Tg CD4+ T cells. Vaginal
CD11c+ DCs from E2-treated mice induced significantly higher IL-17 levels compared to mock
controls (E2: 1571 ± 284 pg/mL and mock: 1064 ± 171 pg/mL) (Fig 4F).
Overall, these results indicate that E2 conditions CD11c+ cells in the vagina to become the
primary inducers of Th17 responses, and this phenomenon is unique to vaginal mucosa.
E2 influences vaginal DCs to induce Th17 responses through an IL-
1-dependent, but IL-6-independent mechanism
Next, we wanted to examine the factors responsible for priming Th17 responses in vaginal tis-
sue co-cultures. A cytokine microenvironment containing IL-6, TGF-β and IL-23 is considered
essential for priming canonical Th17 responses [40]. However, alternative pathways involving
IL-1 signalling in combination with IL-6, IL-21 and IL-23 have also been described [41]. To
determine the key factors for Th17 responses induced by vaginal CD11c+ DCs, IL-6, IL-23,
TGF-β and IL-1β levels were measured in supernatants of TC+CD4 co-cultures from vagina,
lung and intestines (Fig 5A). There were no significant differences in IL-23, and TGF-β levels
were highest in lung co-cultures (Fig 5A). However, vaginal TC alone constitutively produced
high levels of IL-6 (4755 ± 1223 pg/mL) (Fig 5A), and this was further enhanced in vaginal
way ANOVA (** p<0.01, *** p<0.001). (D) The vagina, lung and small intestine from WT mice were isolated, pooled (n = 7 mice) and processed into a cell
suspension. Total tissue cells (5x105 cells/ml) were cultured alone (TC) or co-cultured with 5x105 OT-II Tg CD4+ T cells for 3.5 days, and IL-17 and IL-22
levels in culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. Data is represented as mean±SD of three separate culture wells from one of three separate
experiments with similar trends, and significance was calculated by one-way ANOVA (*** p<0.001). (E) CD11c+ DCs and CD11c− cells were sorted by
FACS from the lungs and vagina of WT mice, and total tissue cells (5x105 cells/ml), or purified cells (2.5x105 cells/ml), were OVA peptide pulsed and co-
cultured with OT-II Tg CD4+ T cells (5x105 cells/ml). For heterologous mixed co-cultures, CD11c+ cells (2.5x105 cells/ml) from the vagina or lung were mixed
with CD11c− cells (2.5x105 cells/ml) from the other tissue, pulsed with OVA peptide, and co-cultured with CD4+ T cells (5x105 cells/ml). IL-17 levels in
supernatants were measured by ELISA. Significance was calculated by comparing mean±SD of three separate co-culture wells per condition, by one-way
ANOVA (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001, **** p<0.0001). Data is representative from two separate experiments with similar trends. (F) CD11c+ DCs
(2.5x105 cells/ml) sorted from the vaginal tissues of OVX mice implanted with E2 or placebo (mock) pellets (n = 20 mice/group), were pulsed with OVA
peptide, and co-cultured with CD4+ T cells (5x105 cells/ml) for 3.5 days. IL-17 levels in co-culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. Significance was
calculated by comparing mean±SD of 6 replicates per condition, by a two-tailed unpaired T test with Welch’s correlation (* p = 0.026).

 TC+CD4 co-cultures (14407 ± 1602 pg/mL). Both lung (8857 ± 766 pg/mL) and intestinal
(136 ± 9 pg/mL) co-cultures produced significantly lower levels of IL-6. While we were unable
to detect IL-1β secreted into co-culture supernatants by ELISA, intracellular staining showed
that IL-1β and IL-6 were both produced by vaginal CD11c+ DCs and to a much less extent by
macrophages (Fig 5B), suggesting that either one or both cytokines may play an important role
in induction of Th17 responses.
To determine the role of IL-6 and IL-1β in the induction of Th17 responses, vaginal TC
(Fig 5C) or CD11c+ cells sorted from reproductive-cycle matched WT controls, IL-6 KO mice
(Fig 5D) and IL-1β KO mice (Fig 5E) were co-cultured with OT-II Tg CD4+ T cells. Vaginal
TC and CD11c+ DCs from IL-6 KO mice (Fig 5C and 5D) were fully capable of priming Th17
responses in co-cultures, and the addition of exogenous rIL-6 did not significantly affect IL-17
levels in co-cultures (Fig 5D). However, Th17 responses were significantly impaired in co-cul-
tures containing vaginal TC or CD11c+ DCs from IL-1β KO mice (Fig 5C and 5E), and this
effect was reversed by the addition of exogenous rIL-1β (Fig 5E). These results show that IL-1,
but not IL-6 signalling, was essential in vaginal DCs for the induction of Th17 responses.
Next, we wanted to determine the link between IL-1 and E2 in vaginal DC conditioning.
Vaginal TC were isolated from OVX mice treated with E2, P4, or placebo (mock) pellets, and
ICS was used to examine whether E2 induced IL-1β production within vaginal DCs. E2 treat-
ment induced a unique, IL-1βhigh CD11c+ DC population that was decreased in both
P4-treated, ERKO and placebo-treated (mock) controls (Fig 5F). Data compiled from three
separate experiments showed that this decrease in the IL-1βhigh CD11c+ DC population was
consistent and significant (Fig 5G). Furthermore, we did not observe any significant differences
in the proportion of total CD11c+ DCs among E2, mock and ERKO mice (Fig 5H), suggesting
that the differences in Th17 responses among hormone-treated mice is primarily due to
increased frequency of IL-1βhigh CD11c+ DCs in the E2-treated vaginal tract and not due to
altered proportion of CD11c+ DCs.
Overall, these results show that E2 can directly condition vaginal DCs to become potent
inducers of Th17 responses, through an IL-1-dependent pathway.
E2-mediated conditioning of DCs is not altered by TLR ligands
While the influence of E2 on DC conditioning was clearly observed in previous experiments,
whether the activation of DCs by viral PAMPs also played a role in the ability of DCs to induce
Th17 responses was less clear. Previously, others have shown that TLR9 expressed in cDCs and
pDCs recognizes HSV-2 dsDNA [42, 43]. Hence, we conducted an experiment to test whether
a known TLR9 ligand, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG), could affect IL-1β production and
Th17 responses primed by vaginal DCs. TC from ERKO or OVX mice treated with E2 or pla-
cebo (mock) pellets were stimulated with CpG as described in the Materials and Methods sec-
tion, and ICS was used to examine IL-1β expression. As expected, IL-1β expression was high in
CD11c+ CD11b+ DCs from E2-treated mice, compared to mock controls and ERKO mice.
Treatment with CpG did not have any effect on IL-1β expression in any of the groups (Fig 6A).
To further examine if treatment with CpG could influence Th17 responses primed in TC co-
cultures, vaginal TC from E2- or placebo (mock)-treated mice were pulsed with OVA peptide
in the presence or absence of CpG and co-cultured with OT-II Tg CD4+ T cells, and IL-17 lev-
els in supernatants were measured by ELISA. Consistent with the observations seen in IL-1β
expression (Fig 6A), CpG did not significantly influence Th17 responses primed by TC from
E2- or placebo (mock)-treated mice (Fig 6B). Co-cultures conducted with pure CD11c+ DCs
sorted from E2-treated mice and OT-II Tg CD4+ T cells, confirmed that IL-17 production by
CD4+ T cells was not affected by CpG. Overall, these results indicated that viral pathogen-

 associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as CpG, do not significantly influence E2-condi-
tioned Th17 responses primed by vaginal DCs.
IRF4 is not essential for vaginal Th17 responses
Previously, others have shown that human and murine mucosal DCs expressing IRF4, may
play a central role in mucosal Th17 differentiation [44, 45]; furthermore, in vitro, E2 could
induce IRF4 expression in bone-marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) [46]. Therefore, we wanted to
examine whether IRF4 was critical for induction of Th17 responses primed by vaginal tissue
cells. To examine whether E2 directly induces IRF4 expression in vaginal DCs in vivo, IRF4
expression in the vagina of OVX mice treated with E2, P4 or placebo (mock) pellets was exam-
ined. E2 treatment led to approximately 2-fold higher IRF4 expression in freshly isolated total
vaginal cells (E2: 15.8%; P4: 6.5%; mock: 2.3%), and CD11c+ DCs (E2: 52%; P4: 28%; mock:
22%), compared to P4- or placebo (mock)-treatments (Fig 7A). ERKO mice showed a similar
frequency of IRF4-expressing total cells and DCs compared to placebo (mock)-treated controls
(Fig 7A). This indicates that in agreement with previous in vitro studies [46], E2 can directly
induce IRF4 expression in vaginal DCs in vivo.
Next, we examined whether IRF4 plays a critical role in Th17 responses primed by vaginal
DCs, by conducting APC-T cell co-cultures with vaginal TC from IRF4 KO mice and comparing
them with WT control mice. Somewhat surprisingly, there were no significant differences in IL-
17 levels between co-cultures with vaginal cells from IRF4 KO or WT controls (Fig 7C). The IRF4
KO phenotype was confirmed by ICS to rule out technical issues with IRF4 KO mice (Fig 7B).
Overall, this shows that while E2 can directly upregulate IRF4 in vaginal DCs in vivo, IRF4
does not appear to play a critical role in DC priming of Th17 responses.
Fig 6. E2 conditioned Th17 responses are not altered by the addition of CpG. (A) OVX mice were implanted with E2 or placebo (mock) pellets, and 14
days later, vaginal cells were isolated and incubated overnight unstimulated (UNS), or stimulated with the TLR ligand CpG. ICS was conducted to examine
the expression of IL-1β in CD11c+ vaginal DCs. (B) Vaginal cells from E2- or placebo (mock)-treated mice, and CD11c+ DCs flow sorted from E2-treated
mice were pulsed with OVA peptide in the presence or absence of CpG for 12h, and co-cultured with OT-II Tg CD4+ T cells for 3.5 days. IL-17 levels in
supernatants were measured by ELISA. Significance was calculated by comparing mean±SD of three separate co-culture wells per condition, by two-way
ANOVA (* p<0.05, **** p<0.0001), and data is representative of two similar experiments.

 IL-17 KO mice are more susceptible to intravaginal HSV-2 re-exposure
due to lower IFN-γ responses
Since our results demonstrated that better protection in E2-treated mice post-challenge (Figs 1
and 2) coincided with enhanced Th17 responses and E2 treatment conditioned DCs to prime
Th17 responses (Fig 3), we wanted to examine whether IL-17 played a role in anti-viral immu-
nity against HSV-2. Based on vaccine models against lung Mycobacterium tuberculosis [47], we
predicted that HSV-2 exposed IL-17 KO mice would display a compromised recall memory T
cell response, and would be unable to protect against subsequent intravaginal exposure to
HSV-2. OVX IL-17 KO and WT mice were infected intravaginally with a sub-lethal dose (102
pfu/mouse) of WT HSV-2 333. Following this primary exposure, there were no differences in
the survival, pathology or viral shedding, indicating no difference in susceptibility or anti-viral
Fig 7. IRF4 expression is not critical for E2-mediated priming of vaginal Th17 responses. (A) Vaginal
cells from WT OVX mice implanted with E2, P4 or placebo (mock) pellets for 14 days were cultured in media
overnight without any stimulation (12h), and stained for antibodies against IRF4 and DCs (CD11c, CD11b).
ICS was conducted according to protocols in Materials and Methods to identify IRF4 expression in total
vaginal cells and vaginal CD11c+ DCs. (B) Spleens from IRF4 KO mice and their WT littermates were
isolated, and cultured overnight without stimulation. IRF4 expression in CD4+ T cells was compared between
IRF4 KO mice and WT littermates by ICS. (C) Vaginal cells from reproductive cycle stage matched WT and
IRF4 KO mice were pulsed with OVA peptide, and co-cultured with OT-II Tg CD4+ T cells for 3.5 days. IL-17
levels in co-cultures were measured by ELISA, and expressed as mean±SD of three replicate wells from one
of two different experiments. Analysis was conducted by two-way ANOVA.

 responses between IL-17 KO and WT mice to primary infection. We then sought to examine
whether these HSV-2 pre-exposed IL-17 KO mice would show compromised anti-viral
responses following re-exposure, since this would test the efficacy of recall memory Th1 effec-
tor cells. Pre-exposed OVX IL-17 KO and WT mice were re-exposed, intravaginally, to a lethal
dose (5x103 pfu/mouse) of WT virus. 100% of WT control mice survived the lethal challenge,
while only 20% of mice survived in the IL-17 KO group (Fig 8A). IL-17 KO mice also showed
greater cumulative pathology (12), compared to WT controls (0) (Table 3, Fig 8B). Further-
more, 80% of IL-17 KO mice shed virus compared to 50% of WT controls (Fig 8C). These
results support our hypothesis and show that IL-17 KO mice are more susceptible to HSV-2
re-exposure due to decreased efficiency of recall HSV-2 anti-viral responses compared to WT
mice. Similar results were obtained with mice pre-exposed to two other sub-lethal doses of
HSV-2 followed by challenge.
Next, we wanted to examine whether the decreased efficiency of memory recall responses in
IL-17 KO mice corresponded to an intrinsic impairment in priming Th1 responses by vaginal
Fig 8. IL-17 KO mice are more susceptible to intravaginal HSV-2 challenge. OVX IL-17 KO (n = 5 mice) and WT mice (n = 4 mice) were intravaginally
exposed to a sub-lethal dose of HSV-2 333 (102 pfu/mouse), and 8 weeks later, intravaginally challenged with a lethal dose of HSV-2 333 (5x103 pfu/mouse).

 APCs. Vaginal TC from estrus cycle stage-matched IL-17 KO mice and WT controls were
pulsed with OVA peptide, and co-cultured with OT-II Tg CD4+ T cells; IFN-γ levels were mea-
sured in co-culture supernatants after 3.5 days. Vaginal TC from IL-17 KO mice were signifi-
cantly impaired at inducing IFN-γ+ in co-cultures compared to WT TC (WT: 2951 ± 650 pg/
mL; IL-17 KO: 404 ± 77 pg/mL) (Fig 8D). These results indicate that IL-17 may indeed enhance
anti-viral Th1 responses in the genital tract.
Discussion
In the current study, we provide evidence for a novel mechanism whereby E2 enhances anti-
viral responses in the genital tract by modulating the functions of vaginal DCs. We demon-
strated that better protection in E2-treated mice coincided with accelerated and greater Th1
and Th17 responses in the vagina post-intravaginal HSV-2 challenge. E2 treatment directly
conditioned vaginal DCs to become potent inducers of Th17 responses, and this ability of E2 to
direct Th17 responses was dependent on the induction of IL-1β in vaginal CD11c+ DCs. Fur-
thermore, this novel mechanism of E2-mediated conditioning was specific to vaginal DCs, as it
was not observed in DCs isolated from spleen or other mucosal tissues including the intestine
and lung. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that E2 can
directly regulate T-cell mediated adaptive anti-viral immunity in the female genital tract by
modulating DC functions.
While others and we have previously reported that the presence of E2 during immunization
can improve anti-viral protection in HSV-2 vaccine models [10, 12, 14, 15], the underlying
mechanism has remained largely unknown. The current study was designed to address this,
and shows that the unique feature of the E2-mediated enhanced protection against HSV-2 was
through the induction of Th17 responses in the genital tract. While the contribution of IFN-γ+
CD4+ Th1 cells to HSV-2 anti-viral responses is well understood, this is the first report indicat-
ing that Th17 cells may augment the HSV-2 anti-viral Th1 responses. The efficiency of T-cell
immunity against HSV-2 is best tested in recall responses post-challenge, and this effect was
clearly seen in IL-17 KO mice pre-exposed to HSV-2, that were impaired in resolving intravagi-
nal viral challenge compared to WT controls (Fig 8).
Our results indicated that the absence of IL-17 in KO mice resulted in overall decreased effi-
ciency of HSV-2 memory recall responses. However, the exact mechanism of how IL-17 could
affect anti-viral responses remains to be elucidated. Comparison of DCs from IL-17 KO mice
with normal WT mice in our studies indicated that DC conditioning may be altered in absence
of IL-17. This is in agreement with another study where, in a lung C. muridarum infection
model, neutralization of IL-17 significantly impaired DC functions [48] by downregulating lev-
els of IL-12 production and decreasing MHCII and CD40 expression on DCs. The DCs

Cumulative pathology is calculated by denoting the number of mice with their maximum pathology score and the number of days that score was observed
for each group. This takes into consideration that each mouse in a group can reach varying degrees of pathology through the experiment. Average
pathology score per mouse was calculated by dividing the sum of cumulative pathology by total number of mice. Data representative of three separate

 produced higher levels of IL-10 in absence of IL-17 and induced higher IL-4, skewing the
immune responses toward a Th2 phenotype instead of typical Th1 response [48]. Thus, further
studies are necessary to examine whether similar effects of IL-17 might exist in the in vivo
HSV-2 model. We are currently examining the mechanism by which IL-17 can influence the
conditioning of vaginal DCs in vivo.
The Th17 responses shown in our study were induced by vaginal DCs through an IL-
1-dependent, but IL-6-independent pathway (Fig 5C, 5D and 5E). While IL-6, along with IL-
23 and TGF-β, is required for the canonical pathway of Th17 differentiation [39], IL-6-inde-
pendent Th17 responses have also been identified in mucosal tissues [41, 49]. In the lamina
propria of the small intestine, the IL-1β-IL-1R pathway, but not IL-6, has been shown to be
essential for the differentiation of steady state Th17 cells in response to the microflora [50].
Furthermore, while IL-6-dependent Th17 responses were critical for the clearance of C. roden-
tium [51]¸ IL-6-independent Th17 cell responses were important for the resolution of H. poly-
gyrus infection [52]. This suggests that the nature of antigens, and/or the local cytokine milieu,
can determine the pathways of CD4+ T cell differentiation. Our study showed that while IL-1β
and IL-6 were both produced by vaginal DCs, IL-1β was required, while IL-6 was dispensable,
for vaginal Th17 responses. Furthermore, our results showed that these Th17 responses were
induced by direct conditioning of vaginal DCs by E2 to express high levels of IL-1β. In order to
examine the pathway/s that link E2 to IL-1β production and Th17 differentiation, we examined
intracellular factors that are induced by E2 and involved in Th17 differentiation. Others have
shown that IRF4 expression in DCs was critical for the generation of lung and intestinal Th17
responses [44, 45]. Additionally, E2 was found to directly induce IRF4 expression in bone mar-
row DCs [46]. Hence, we sought to examine whether IRF4 is integral to the pathway of Th17
responses primed by vaginal DCs. While E2 did indeed upregulate IRF4 expression in vaginal
DCs in vivo (Fig 7A), unlike the observations in lung or intestinal DCs [44, 45], IRF4 was dis-
pensable for Th17 differentiation, as evident by intact IL-17 levels in vaginal TC co-cultures
conducted with IRF4 KO and WT mice (Fig 7C). While, it is likely that other IRFs may com-
pensate for IRF4 in vaginal DCs [53], E2 could also upregulate inflammatory mediators,
including IL-1β in DCs required for induction of Th17 responses through other pathways [54].
Furthermore, IRF4 may be involved in other immune functions that influence DC functions.
Studies have shown that while IRF4 was dispensable for the development of skin-derived DCs,
it was crucial for their CCR7-mediated migration to the draining lymph nodes [55]. Therefore,
further in vivo studies may provide more comprehensive information if there are other IRF-4
related mechanisms involved in DC mediated enhancement of HSV-2 anti-viral responses.
In this study, we examined DC populations by gating CD11c+ cells in the lung, vagina, and
small intestine. Most studies that examine DCs in mucosal tissues use a panel of cell surface
markers such as CD11c, MHCII, CD8α, CD103, F4/80 and CD205 [21, 22, 56–60] to identify
subsets of DCs. We chose CD11c as the primary marker to define DC populations in all tissues
in order to make equivalent comparisons across different mucosal tissues. We reasoned that
although this would lead to inclusion of distinct APC subsets that are unique for each mucosa,
it would allow us to compare the functions of a natural mix of APCs present in each mucosa,
reflecting the normal immune responses in that tissue and providing an understanding of the
overall differences that exist among different mucosal tissues. On the other hand, this strategy
limits comparison of APC subsets that are functionally distinct. For example, other studies
examining CD11c+ DCs in the lung [56] have found that under steady state conditions,
CD11b− MHCII− alveolar macrophages also express CD11c, and these cells may suppress infil-
tration of migratory DC populations into the lung lamina propria (LP) [61, 62]. These alveolar
macrophages likely represent the primary CD11c+ population in the lung isolates used in our

 experiments. Therefore, there are clear limitations to the conclusions from our study, with the
results mainly reflecting the functions of overall mucosal APCs.
Although a number of groups have examined the functional relevance of Th17 responses in
reproductive tract infections, its role under homeostatic conditions has not been examined. IL-
17 has been shown to be an important part of the immune response to N. gonhorreae and C.
albicans infections [35, 36, 63]. Vulvovaginal fungal infections affect 70–75% of women, and
these infections have been correlated with the E2-dominant phase of the reproductive cycle
[63–65]. Therefore, pre-programming of DCs to induce a Th17 response under the influence of
E2 may represent an evolutionary adaptation for protecting the reproductive tract against these
infections. The role of Th17 responses in viral infections is relatively unclear. Two previous
studies have suggested that IL-17 may not have a direct protective role in vaginal HSV-2 infec-
tion [66, 67]. However, both of these studies utilized MPA, a P4 derivative, to make mice sus-
ceptible to HSV-2. Previous studies, including our own, have shown that MPA can
significantly downregulate endogenous hormone levels, including E2, and decrease mucosal
anti-viral responses to HSV-2 [11, 68]. This may have precluded an accurate assessment of the
contribution of Th17 cells in HSV-2 anti-viral responses. As seen in the current study, the hor-
monal environment can have a profound effect on the induction of adaptive immune
responses. Therefore, anti-viral immune responses in the female genital tract need to be exam-
ined under clearly defined hormonal conditions.
Our study showed that Th17 responses coincide with augmented anti-viral immunity in
E2-treated mice, and further studies are needed to demonstrate the underlying mechanism. In
a pulmonary M. tuberculosis vaccination model where, like anti-HSV-2 immunity, IFN-γ pro-
duced by CD4+ T cells is integral to the protective immune response, the presence of IL-17 cor-
related with accelerated CD4+ T cell responses and early resolution of bacteria post-challenge
[47, 69]. The Th17 response post-challenge was correlated with a concurrent CXCL9, CXCL10
and CXCL11 chemokine response, which was essential for the accumulation of CD4+ IFN-γ+ T
cells in the lung [47]. Our observations were very similar in that E2-induced Th17 responses
coincided with earlier and greater proportions of CD4+ IFN-γ+ T cells in the vagina post-chal-
lenge (Fig 2 and Table 2). We also showed that the presence of IL-17 was critical for priming
efficient Th1 responses in vitro (Fig 8). Thus, like the M. tuberculosis study, IL-17 is likely
responsible for facilitating the rapid infiltration of memory Th1 cells through chemokine
induction in the vaginal tract. Further studies examining the chemokines and T cell subsets in
the vagina post-challenge are ongoing to examine this possibility.
In summary, our study describes for the first time a mechanism by which E2 enhances anti-
viral protection following vaccination in the genital HSV-2 mouse model. E2-priming resulted
in vaginal APCs becoming potent inducers of Th17 responses, and this coincided with earlier
recruitment and a greater accumulation of IFN-γ+ CD4+ T cells post-challenge. Furthermore,
we demonstrated that CD11c+ cells in the vagina were the primary inducers of Th17 responses,
and E2 was the critical factor that upregulated IL-1β, required for induction of Th17 responses.
Overall, our study provides insight into a potential mechanism by which the hormonal micro-
environment during immunization can regulate the induction of mucosal anti-viral T cell
immune responses in the female genital tract. Hence, hormonal status should be an important
consideration in the development of mucosal vaccines against sexually transmitted pathogens,
to assess whether the modulation of hormonal microenvironment can potentially optimize
vaccine-mediated immune responses against STIs in the female genital tract.

 Materials and Methods
Animals
C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories Inc (Saint-Constant, QC, Can-
ada). Chicken ovalbumin (OVA) receptor transgenic (Tg) mice (OT-II) whose CD4+ T cells
express TCR specific for the ovalbumin 323–339 (OVA323-339) epitopes [37], and IL-6 knock-
out mice (IL-6 KO) [70], were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA).
IL-1β KO and IL-17 KO mice were kindly provided by Dr. Yoichiro Iwakura (University of
Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan) [71, 72], estradiol receptor α knockout mice (ERKO) were
kindly provided by Prof. P. Chambon (University de Strasbourg, France), and CD11c-DTR
mice [73] were bred internally (McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada). IRF4 KO mice
[74] were kindly provided by Dr. Tak Wah Mak (University Health Network, Princess Marga-
ret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON), and bred internally (McMaster University, Hamilton, ON,
Canada).
Surgeries and treatments
Endogenous hormones were depleted by ovariectomies (OVX) according to previously pub-
lished protocols [13]. Briefly, OVX mice were anaesthetised with injectable anaesthetic (150mg
Ketamine/kg + 10mg Xylazine/kg body weight) and subcutaneously implanted with either
21-day release E2 (476 ng/mouse/day), or P4 (476 μg/mouse/day), or placebo pellets, pur-
chased from Innovative Research of America (Sarasota, Florida, USA) using previously pub-
lished protocols [14]. The level of serum E2 resulting from the pellets has previously been
shown to correspond to that measured during the estrus cycle [75] and the P4 levels to those
seen during pregnancy [76]. DCs were depleted in CD11c-DTR mice using 400ng diphtheria
toxin (DT) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (200ng IP + 200ng intravaginal injections)
treatment 18h before tissue retrieval.
Infections
One week after implanting hormone pellets, OVX mice were immunized intranasally with
1x103 TK− HSV-2 or 5μg HSV-2 gD + 30μg CpG or 1x104 pfu (plaque forming units) HI HSV-
2 333 + 30μg CpG. The immunization was repeated two weeks later, and mice were challenged
intravaginally with 5x103 pfu/mouse WT HSV-2 333, according to previously published proto-
cols [11]. Vaginal washes were collected daily post-challenge and frozen until use at -80°C. To
quantify shed virus within these washes, plaque assays were conducted on Vero cells, as
described before [11]. Survival and genital pathology was monitored on a five-point scale. 0: no
infection, 1: slight redness of external vagina, 2: swelling and redness of vagina, 3: severe swell-
ing and redness of vagina and surrounding tissues, 4: genital ulceration with severe redness and
hair loss, and 5: severe ulceration extending to surrounding tissues, ruffled hair, hunched back
and lethargy. Animals were sacrificed before they reached stage 5. For the intravaginal infection
model to obtain HSV-2 specific CD4+ T cells, OVX mice were IVAG immunized with 1x105
pfu/mouse of TK- HSV-2, and three weeks later, challenged IVAG with 1x105 pfu/mouse WT
HSV-2 333. CD4+ T cells were isolated from the vagina and draining iliac lymph nodes from
these mice 3 days post-challenge.
Tissue isolation and co-cultures
Mucosal tissues were enzymatically digested (lung: collagenase I 150U/mL, intestine: collage-
nase A 0.239mg/mL and DNase I 20U/mL, vagina: collagenase A 150U/mL; (Roche Diagnos-
tics, Mississauga, ON, Canada)) at 37°C for 1-2h as previously described [77–79]. Spleen was

 mechanically disrupted and ACK buffer (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used to lyse
blood cells. Mononuclear cells were counted and cell preparations were seeded in a 96-well
plate, at 5x105 cells/mL or 2.5x105 DCs/mL, in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS,
100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1x
non-essential amino acids and 1x sodium pyruvate (Gibco Life Technologies, Burlington, ON,
Canada). Cells were pulsed with ovalbumin 323–339 (OVA) peptide (Biomer technology,
Pleasanton, CA, USA) or 5X105pfu/ml of UV-inactivated HSV-2 for 6-18h. CD4+ T cells were
magnetically sorted using CD L3TE microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA, USA) from the
spleen of OT-II mice, and stained with 50μM CFSE (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
according to published protocols [80]. Peptide-pulsed tissue cells were co-cultured with CFSE-
stained splenic OT-II Tg CD4+ T cells at a 1:1 ratio for 3.5 days at 37°C based on previously
published protocols [81]. For activation of TCs with CpG, vaginal TCs were isolated from
OVX mice implanted with E2 or placebo (mock) pellets for 14 days and incubated in the pres-
ence or absence of 6 ng/ml CpG ODN for 12h prior to ICS or co-culture with OT-II Tg CD4+
T cells. In some experiments as indicated in figure legend, 40 ng/mL rIL-6 (R&D systems, Min-
neapolis, MN, USA) or 100 ng/mL rIL-1β (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was added
on the first day of co-culture. Co-culture supernatants were frozen for cytokine analysis and
cells were phenotypically characterized for CD4+ T cell proliferation and intracellular cytokine
detection by flow cytometry.
Flow cytometry
Mononuclear tissue cells or cell fractions from co-cultures were stained with a cocktail of anti-
bodies: [CD11c PE-Cy7, Gr-1 AF700, F4/80 APC, CD3 AF700 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA,
USA), CD11b PE-CF594, I-Ab FITC (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) CD3 BV785, CD4
BV421 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA)]. For intracellular staining, on day 2 of co-culture,
cells were treated with 2μl/mL Cell Stimulation Cocktail plus protein transport inhibitors
(500X) (cocktail of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), ionomycin, brefeldin A and mon-
ensin) (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) for 12–16 h, permeabilized and fixed with BD Phar-
mingen™ Transcription Factor Buffer Set (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and stained
with intracellular antibodies against cytokines (IL-17 APC, IL-6 PE (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA, USA); ROR-γ PE, IRF4 PE, IL-1β PE, IFN-γ FITC (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA)).
Data was acquired on a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Canada) and analyzed with
FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland, OR, USA). Flow sorting was conducted using a BD FAC-
SAria III (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) flow sorter to isolate the following populations:
DCs (CD11c+ cells); macrophages (CD11c− CD11b+ F4/80+ Gr-1− cells); monocytes (CD11c−
CD11b+ F4/80+ Gr-1+ cells), neutrophils (CD11c− CD11b+ F4/80− Gr-1+ cells) and others
(CD11c− CD11b− cells). Purity was verified by flow analysis of purified fractions on the BD
FACSAria™ III, and was consistently found to be over 95%. Cells were analyzed and initially
gated on forward and side scatter parameters to select total cells excluding debris or aggregates.
Singlet events were selected based on forward scatter area, height and width parameters. CD3+
CD4+ T cells were selected, and IFN-γ+ or IL-17+ cells were gated to examine Th1 and Th17
populations.
Cytokine analysis
Co-culture supernatants were assayed using DuoSet ELISA kits to measure IL-17, IL-23, IL-22
and TGF-β (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). In some experiments, a custom MSD mul-
tiplex kit was used to measure TNF-α, IL-12, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-17, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 and plates
were analyzed on a Sector Imager 2400 (Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD, USA).
