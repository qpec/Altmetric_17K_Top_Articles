ABSTRACT
Objectives: To determine how ‘overdiagnosis’ is
currently conceptualised among adults in the UK in light
of previous research, which has found that the term is
difficult for the public to understand and awareness is
low. This study aimed to add to current debates on
healthcare in which overdiagnosis is a prominent issue.
Design: An observational, web-based survey was
administered by a survey company.
Setting: Participants completed the survey at a time
and location of their choosing.
Participants: 390 consenting UK adults aged
50–70 years. Quota sampling was used to achieve
approximately equal numbers in three categories of
education and equal numbers of men and women.
Primary outcome measures: Participants were
asked whether they had seen or heard the term
‘overdiagnosis’. If they had, they were then invited to
explain in a free-text field what they understood it to
mean. If they had not previously encountered it, they
were invited to say what they thought it meant.
Responses were coded and interpreted using content
analysis and descriptive statistics.
Results: Data from 390 participants were analysed.
Almost a third (30.0%) of participants reported having
previously encountered the term. However, their
responses often indicated that they had no knowledge
of its meaning. The most prevalent theme consisted of
responses related to the diagnosis itself. Subthemes
indicated common misconceptions, including an
‘overly negative or complicated diagnosis’, ‘false-
positive diagnosis’ or ‘misdiagnosis’. Other recurring
themes consisted of responses related to testing (ie,
‘too many tests’), treatment (eg, ‘overtreatment’) and
patient psychology (eg, ‘overthinking’). Responses
categorised as consistent with ‘overdiagnosis’ (defined
as detection of a disease that would not cause
symptoms or death) were notably rare (n=10; 2.6%).
Conclusions: Consistent with previous research,
public awareness of ‘overdiagnosis’ in the UK is low and
its meaning is often misunderstood or misinterpreted.
INTRODUCTION
Academics,
healthcare
professionals
and
policymakers are becoming increasingly con-
cerned about circumstances in which the
health
benefits
of
a
given
intervention
are not considered to clearly justify the
associated risks. The British Medical Journal
has been a prominent voice in this area
through their ‘Too Much Medicine’ cam-
paign,1 which has recently gained support
from
the
Academy
of
Medical
Royal
Colleges.2 A central topic within the cam-
paign is ‘overdiagnosis’, defined here as the
diagnosis of disease which would never have
become clinically apparent in a person’s life-
time
(ie,
causing
neither
symptoms
nor
death).3
4 Debate continues regarding the
magnitude, significance and implications of
overdiagnosis. Much attention is focused on
breast cancer screening, where estimates of
the
ratio
of
screening-prevented
breast
cancer
deaths
to
overdiagnosed
breast
cancer cases range from 9:45 to 5:173 for
1000 women screened over 20 years. There is
also
an
increasingly
common
view
that
screening invitees should appreciate the pos-
sibility
of
overdiagnosis
before
deciding
whether to participate,6 although there is
professional controversy regarding how best
to inform people about the concept.7
Public awareness of overdiagnosis appears
to be low in many countries. A study from
2000 in the USA found that only a small
minority (7%) of women were aware of the
concept of non-progressive breast cancer.8
Recently, a focus group study in Korea found
that women had difficulty understanding the
meaning of overdiagnosis in the context of
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This is the first study to investigate how the UK
general public understands and interprets the
term ‘overdiagnosis’.
▪ Free-text fields allowed participants to respond in
their own words without being limited to cat-
egories preselected by the researchers.
▪ The results of this study corroborate those of a
previous survey in Australia and are consistent
with previous research indicating that overdiagno-
sis is a difficult concept for people to understand.
▪ An
appreciable
proportion
of
participants’
responses were ambiguous in their meaning and
some could not be coded into a specific category.

 thyroid cancer screening.9 Very similar findings have
been reported in a small interview study about breast
cancer screening based in Denmark.10 In addition,
Moynihan and colleagues recently reported a survey of
500 Australian adults drawn from the general popula-
tion, who were asked to state whether they had seen or
heard the term, before indicating what they thought it
meant. The majority (50–63%) reported having encoun-
tered the term before, but only 41% of the sample were
categorised as responding with even an approximately
correct definition of the term. Participants categorised
as being approximately correct often described it in
terms of misdiagnosis, too many diagnoses or overstating
the significance of a diagnosis, with 35% of responses
falling into one of these categories.11 Although these
have some similarities with the intended meaning of
overdiagnosis, there is an apparent lack of awareness
regarding its specific meaning. This suggests that despite
attention in health-related literature, overdiagnosis has
not become a familiar term among the general public.
The present study extends the previous work by
exploring people’s definitions of ‘overdiagnosis’ as part
of a web-based survey of adults in the UK. We used the
same measures of awareness as Moynihan et al11 to allow
comparability between studies.
METHODS
This study took place as part of a web-based survey of
attitudes and beliefs about cancer in February 2015. The
sample consisted of consenting members of the UK
general population aged 50–70 years, recruited through
a survey company (Survey Sampling International, SSI).
SSI maintains a panel of potential survey participants;
these individuals are periodically invited to complete
online surveys in exchange for small amounts of com-
pensation (eg, air miles) via a generic recruitment
email. The email contained a link that directed partici-
pants to the online survey. Quotas were used to ensure
an equal proportion of men and women, and equal pro-
portions of participants with different levels of education
(three categories: leaving school before 16 years; com-
pleting CSEs, O-levels or equivalent; completing A-levels,
higher, university education or equivalent).
As in the Australian study, participants were first asked:
‘have you seen or heard the term “overdiagnosis” before
today’. Those responding ‘yes’ were then asked ‘what do
you understand the term “overdiagnosis” to mean’;
those who responded ‘no’ were asked ‘what do you
think the term “overdiagnosis” means’.i Participants
responded to the latter two questions by completing a
free-text field. They were also asked for basic demo-
graphic information (gender, age, level of education
and ethnicity).
The questions on overdiagnosis formed part of a
larger survey on views relating to cancer screening;
hence, participants were selected to be approaching or
at an age at which they would be eligible for breast or
colorectal
cancer
screening
in
the
UK.
Screening-specific questions always came after questions
on overdiagnosis, and so responses could not have been
influenced by the questions on screening (results not
reported here).
Demographic data and self-reported recognition of
the term ‘overdiagnosis’ were analysed using simple
descriptive
statistics.
Content
analysis
was
used
to
examine responses to free-text questions.12 Responses
were categorised independently by two researchers (AG
and SFM), who read participants’ answers repeatedly
before assigning a provisional code (eg, misdiagnosis) to
each one, based on their interpretation. After both
researchers had completed their separate coding, the
two lists were compared and disagreements resolved
through discussion. The final list of codes was then
reviewed to determine whether several codes could be
meaningfully renamed, grouped together or split into
further codes. The overarching themes and specific sub-
themes identified were then summarised using descrip-
tive statistics and illustrated using exemplar quotes.
Responses of participants who reported having seen or
heard the term before and those of participants who
reported
no
previous
exposure
to
the
term
were
reported separately.
RESULTS
Participant characteristics
The sample comprised 390 adults (201 women; 51.5%)
with a median age of 60 years (interquartile range
(IQR) 55–65). Most stated their ethnicity as Caucasian
(n=382; 97.9%). Per our quota sampling, approximately
equal numbers had left school before 16 years (133;
34.1%), completed CSEs, O-levels or equivalent (125;
32.1%), and had completed A-levels, higher, or univer-
sity degree, or equivalent (132; 33.8%).
Definitions of ‘overdiagnosis’
One
hundred
and
seventeen
participants
(30.0%)
reported having seen or heard the term previously.
Median length of free-text responses relating to partici-
pants’ understanding was seven words (range 1–42; IQR
4–12.5); for responses from participants who had not
seen or heard it before, it was four words (range 1–28;
IQR 2–8).
Responses are presented separately for those who had
and those who had not previously encountered the
term. For both groups, responses could be categorised
into one of six broad themes. These are summarised in
iAn error in the skip logic of the survey meant that participants who
responded ‘yes’ were also asked the second question. Hence, data on
questions asked in error were not analysed since participants often
responded with the same answer or noted that they had already
answered a very similar question. One participant who responded ‘no’
was able to complete both questions and so was excluded from the
analysis since their answer to the second (correctly asked) question
may have been affected by the first (incorrectly asked) question.

 table 1 (for participants who had previously encoun-
tered the term) and table 2 (for those who had not),
respectively, along with exemplar quotes. Participants
commonly reported either no knowledge of what the
term meant (even when they reported having encoun-
tered it before) or responded in a way that could not be
categorised (frequently because the response was too
vague or entirely unclear). Three other themes were
aligned with different stages of a patient trajectory: from
testing (too many tests) to diagnosis, and treatment. The
theme relating to diagnosis was the most prevalent;
38.5% and 26.1% of responses from participants who
had and had not been previously exposed to the term
were categorised into this theme. Relevant subthemes
included an ‘overly negative or complicated diagnosis’, a
‘false-positive
diagnosis’
and
a
‘misdiagnosis’.
Treatment-related responses referred to ‘overtreatment’,
‘inappropriate treatment’ and ‘unbeneficial treatment’.
A further broad theme referred to conceptions of how
patients’ psychology related to overdiagnosis, with the
most common subtheme being ‘overthinking’. The final
grouping consisted of other responses that could not be
categorised into one of the preceding five themes.
Responses were rarely consistent with ‘overdiagnosis’
itself, whether or not participants had previously been
exposed to the term (n=9, 7.7%; n=1, 0.4%). All such
responses are reported in box 1.
DISCUSSION
This survey of definitions of ‘overdiagnosis’ among
adults in the UK found that despite approximately one
in three people stating that they had seen or heard the
term before, only a minority (2.6% of all participants)
provided a response that was even broadly consistent
with the meaning considered correct: diagnosis of a
disease that would not cause symptoms or death.3 This
finding can be interpreted in light of the inconsistent
usage of the term among academics and clinicians. As
Carter et al4 note, the intended meaning can vary,
depending on the specific context being addressed
within the general domain of ‘Too Much Medicine’. For

 example, the term may be used to describe detection
of
‘incidentalomas’
in
lung
cancer
screening,13
or
diagnosis due to diagnostic criteria being expanded
(eg,
pre-diabetes14
and
attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder15). Hence, it is not surprising that a single clear
meaning has not reached public awareness. However,
concerns regarding overdiagnosis are likely to be an
increasingly influential aspect of both policy-level and
patient-level
decisions.
Consequently,
policymakers,
healthcare providers and communicators may consider
this to be an important concept that the public should
understand. One risk of a lack of awareness is scepticism
regarding the true purpose of an attempt to reduce the
delivery healthcare interventions (eg, the belief that it is
an attempt to reduce costs). This may account for the
generally negative views among women regarding the
US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommen-
dation that women aged 40–49 should not undergo
routine mammography screening16 17 and it might be
hypothesised that there are similar negative perceptions
among men regarding the USPSTF recommendation
against prostate-specific antigen screening in 2012.18
The present findings indicate that there is substantial
potential to increase public awareness.
After excluding responses that could not be cate-
gorised and those where participants stated they had no
knowledge, the most commonly occurring themes were
related to diagnosis, including an ‘overly negative or
complicated diagnosis’, or a ‘false-positive diagnosis’.
These findings are similar to those of the Australian
survey,11 in which 22% thought it meant exaggerating
an existing condition and 10% thought it meant diag-
nosing a non-existent condition. The patient-related sub-
themes such as ‘overthinking’ were more surprising,
showing that patients do not necessarily only consider
the healthcare provider’s or the healthcare system’s
responsibility in influencing overdiagnosis, but also rec-
ognise the possible influence of patient attitudes towards
health and illness. Some previous studies19 have pro-
vided participants with information that aims to clarify
the distinction between overdiagnosis and false positives;
the present findings suggest that there may be additional
assumptions to be addressed.
Our findings are also consistent with discussion group
studies in the UK and Australia where the term ‘over-
diagnosis’ was explained to lay members of the public in
the context of breast cancer screening. These studies
reported that most participants found the term counter-
intuitive, in part because it involved understanding that
some medical conditions, including cancer, will never
cause harm.20 21 The term was also seen as difficult for
participants
to
understand.
Participants
were
given
detailed information on overdiagnosis using a method
that allowed them to ask and receive answers to ques-
tions that arose. However, when asked a multiple choice
question on the most applicable definition, 16% gave an
incorrect answer and a further 24% gave only a partially
correct answer.20 Comparable trends have also been

from other countries, which have reported both low
levels of awareness and difficulty understanding the
term.
This study has limitations. Coding of participants’ defi-
nitions necessarily relied on the authors’ interpretations
of brief free-text responses, and so the reader may dis-
agree with some of our coding. Furthermore, as previ-
ously
noted,
there
is
continuing
academic
debate
regarding the most appropriate definition of overdiagno-
sis.4 22 In addition, some responses coded as consistent
with overdiagnosis also contained misconceptions (eg,
relating to false positives). In these cases, the most
appropriate code to use was ambiguous. Similarly, the
brevity of participants’ responses precluded an in-depth
understanding of their intended meanings, resulting in
categories that warrant further exploration. In particular,
participants’ ideas regarding ‘overthinking’ may have
been related to the source and context in which they
encountered
the
term
but
these
factors
were
not
recorded in the present study. There was also an appre-
ciable proportion of responses that could not be coded.
Future qualitative research could be undertaken to
address
this.
Future
research
could
also
evaluate
whether alternative terminology (eg, overdetection)19
would be more intuitive to participants, resulting in a
greater proportion of correct interpretations. Finally,
survey response rates were not available from the survey
company, creating uncertainty regarding the representa-
tiveness of the sample.
In conclusion, this study found that ‘overdiagnosis’
was rarely defined correctly by the public, indicating sub-
stantial scope to increase awareness. Future research
should be designed with an assumption of extremely low
pre-existing knowledge of the concept in the general
population.
