Abstract
Aberrant expansion of follicular helper T (TFH) cells occurs in lupus patients. An unanswered 
question is whether an altered T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is associated with this expansion. 
Here, we demonstrate that Blimp-1 repressed expression of the cathepsin S gene (Ctss) which 
encodes a cysteine protease that cleaves invariant chain and produces antigenic peptides for MHC 
class II loading. The increased CTSS in dendritic cells (DCs) of female Prdm1 conditional 
knockout (CKO) mice altered antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells. Analysis of Vβ CDR3s 
demonstrated a more diverse repertoire of TFH from female CKO mice. In vivo treatment of CKO 
mice with a CTSS inhibitor abrogated lupus-related phenotypes and reduced the diversity of the 
TFH TCR repertoire. Thus, Blimp-1 deficiency in DCs leads to a loss of appropriate regulation of 
Ctss expression in female mice thereby modulating antigen presentation and TFH repertoire to 
contribute to autoimmunity.

 Introduction
The T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is determined through positive and negative selection of 
T cells based on recognition by the TCR of peptide–major histocompatibility (MHC) 
complexes presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In the periphery, CD11chi classical 
dendritic cells (cDCs) are the primary APCs playing a critical role in both innate and 
adaptive immune responses1, 2. DCs activate natural killer (NK), NK T, and innate 
lymphocytes at the site of infection or sterile inflammation. They also process antigens and 
migrate to local lymphoid organs where they activate naïve T cells3. T cells require signals 
from a peptide-MHC (MHCII) complex, co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines provided 
by DCs for differentiation to various subsets of CD4+ T effector cells or CD4+ regulatory 
cells with each CD4+ T effector cell subset executing unique functions and secreting 
different cytokines4.
The cytokine milieu is critical to CD4+ T cell differentiation. A dominant cytokine helps 
establish CD4+ T helper (TH) cell initial polarization; interleukin 12 (IL-12) for TH1, IL-4 
for TH2, IL-6 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) for TH17, IL-6 for follicular helper 
(TFH) and TGF-β and IL-10 for regulatory T (Treg) cells. CD4+ T cell differentiation can be 
modulated by several other factors such as the type of antigen and dose of exposure, affinity 
of the TCR for the MHCII complex and the duration of stimulation5, 6.
Antigen-processing pathways have been extensively investigated in mouse DCs. After 
uptake, antigens are transported into the endolysosomal compartment where they are cleaved 
and some of the fragments that are generated enter the groove of the MHCII molecule for 
presentation to CD4+ T cells7. This process is dependent on the action of endocytic 
proteases in endosomal–lysosomal compartments8 that fall into three main classes: cysteine 
(cathepsins B, F, H, L, S, Z), aspartate (cathepsins D, E), and serine (cathepsins A, G). 
While all cathepsins can function in antigen processing and many show an overlapping 
expression pattern, cathepsin S (CTSS) has been shown to be expressed primarily in 
professional APCs including B cells and DCs where it plays a critical role in the cleavage of 
invariant chain (Ii) to permit loading of peptide into MHCII9. CTSS also contributes to 
antigen processing through degradation of antigen in the endolysosome, helping to establish 
the pool of peptides that is available for presentation by MHCII10, 11. Appropriate 
expression of CTSS is critical for establishing the repertoire of immunocompetent cells. 
Modulation of CTSS and CTSL expression can change the pool of peptides which are 
presented in vitro to CD4+ T cells10. Overexpression of CTSS in DCs and medullary 
epithelial cells in the thymus has been shown to permit autoreactive T cells to escape 
negative selection, presumably through too exuberant degradation of autoantigen12. Whether 
negative regulation in the periphery is also affected by CTSS has not been addressed.
PRDM1, the gene encoding Blimp-1, was identified as a systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) risk allele in a genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Chinese Han and 
Northern European populations13, 14. We previously demonstrated that CD14+ monocyte-
derived DCs (MO-DCs) derived from risk single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (C/C) 
carriers express less PRDM1 transcripts compared to MO-DCs from control SNP (T/T) 
carriers15. To investigate the pathologic function of Blimp-1 in SLE, we generated mice with

 a DC-specific deletion of Prdm1 by mating CD11c-Cre to mice with floxed Prdm1 (CKO 
mice). In female CKO mice, DCs that lack Blimp-1 exhibit an activated phenotype with 
enhanced MHCII expression and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
following Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. These DCs resemble DCs from individuals 
with the SLE-associated PRDM1 risk allele, which are characterized by increased MHCII 
expression and hyper-responsiveness to TLR stimulation15. The frequency of TFH cells is 
increased in the blood of lupus patients16, which correlates with disease activity17, 18. We 
reported an expansion of TFH cells in female CKO mice which is associated with an 
increased number of germinal center B cells that produce autoantibodies and cause 
antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis. We also demonstrated that this phenotype is 
critically dependent on increased IL-6 produced by Blimp-1 deficient DCs as all 
autoimmune features are absent in CKO Il6+/− female mice19. In the present study, we show 
that Blimp-1 also regulates Ctss expression in DCs and that Blimp-1 deficient splenic and 
bone marrow-derived DCs (BM-DCs) exhibit increased Ctss expression and alterations in 
antigen presentation compared to wild-type DCs. These alterations lead to a more diverse 
TCR repertoire in TFH cells of CKO mice. Finally, inhibition of CTSS in CKO mice 
suppresses the development of the lupus-like phenotype, and is associated with a reduced 
number and diversity in the TFH TCR repertoire.
Results
Increased cathepsin S expression in Blimp-1-deficient DCs
Blimp-1 has previously been suggested to participate in antigen presentation through 
downregulation of MHCII transactivator (Ciita) in B cells and CD11c+ DCs20, 21. Consistent 
with these studies, we had reported increased MHCII expression in Blimp-1 deficient 
DCs15. To test whether Blimp-1 deficiency in DCs also leads to altered antigen processing, 
we assayed Blimp-1 deficient DCs from female C57BL/6 mice for expression of H2-Aa, 
Ciita, H2dmb, and Ctss and other genes involved in antigen presentation.. The expression of 
H2-Aa, Ciita, H2dmb, and Ctss was significantly higher in Blimp-1 deficient than wild-type 
DCs whereas other genes showed no difference in expression (Fig. 1a).
To investigate whether Blimp-1 can directly regulate cathepsin gene expression, we searched 
for the Blimp-1 consensus core binding sequence, 5′-GAAAGT-3′, in a region 1500 bp 
upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) of the first exon of each mouse cathepsin 
genes22. Ctsc, Ctsd, Ctse, Ctsg, Ctsk, Ctsl1, Ctso, Ctss, and Ctsw contain one or more 
Blimp-1 consensus sequences (Supplementary Table 1). We, therefore, measured expression 
of each cathepsin gene in DCs from wild-type and CKO female mice. Expression of Ctss 
and Ctsl, but not other cathepsins, was increased in splenic DCs and bone marrow-derived 
DCs (BM-DCs) of CKO female mice (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). Expression of 
Ctss was also increased in blood DCs of female CKO mice (Fig. 1c). To confirm that the 
increased expression of Ctss in DCs correlated with increased CTSS functional activity, we 
assayed CTSS enzymatic activity in DCs purified from spleens of female CKO mice. In 
vitro enzymatic activity was measured by assaying fluorescence generated upon cleavage of 
a CTSS substrate. Blimp-1 deficient DCs exhibited increased catalytic activity compared to 
wild-type DCs (Fig. 1d). We previously observed that CKO male mice do not exhibit altered

 DC function and do not develop lupus-like disease19. Both Ctss transcript abundance and 
CTSS catalytic activity were similar in DCs derived from wild-type and CKO male mice 
(Fig. 1d, e), suggesting that Blimp-1 deficiency in combination with gender-specific 
alterations in DCs alters Ctss expression.
To address whether CTSS expression is associated with BLIMP-1 expression in human MO-
DCs, we measured CTSS expression in MO-DCs of risk and control SNP carriers. MO-DCs 
from female risk SNP carriers exhibit decreased PRDM1 expression, as reported, and 
increased CTSS expression compared to MO-DCs from non-risk individuals (Fig. 1f).
Given the presence of a Blimp-1 consensus binding site within the Ctss promoter and the 
enhanced expression of CTSS in DCs of female CKO mice, we performed chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to determine whether Blimp-1 binds to the Ctss 
promoter region in splenic CD11c+ cDCs from wild-type mice. As expected, the Ctss 
promoter region was immunoprecipitated with Blimp-1, indicating Blimp-1 binds in vivo to 
the Ctss promoter in wild-type, but not CKO mice (Fig. 2a). To test whether Blimp-1 
binding negatively regulates transcription of Ctss, assays were performed with a luciferase 
expression reporter driven by the Ctss promoter (−1300 to +10). There was a significant 
suppression of luciferase when Blimp-1 was expressed, demonstrating that Blimp-1 
downregulates Ctss promoter activity (Fig. 2b). Moreover, Prdm1 siRNA, but not control 
siRNA, in wild-type DCs led to increased Ctss expression (Fig. 2c) and restoration of 
Blimp-1 expression suppressed the abundance of Ctss transcripts and CTSS protein in 
Blimp-1–deficient DCs (Fig. 2d). These data demonstrate that Ctss is a target gene of 
Blimp-1 in DCs, and that the binding of Blimp-1 to the promoter region of Ctss suppresses 
transcription.
Gender specificity of altered Ctss expression
Differential Ctss expression in Blimp-1 deficient DCs from male and female mice suggests 
that additional regulators are present in cells of female mice that contribute to Blimp-1-
mediated Ctss regulation. Our previous study showed that DCs from female CKO mice 
exhibit increased expression of IL-6 following TLR activation compared to DCs from 
female wild-type mice, while DCs from male CKO and wild-type mice exhibit similar IL-6 
expression19. This observation was not surprising as IL-6 has been shown to be positively 
regulated by estrogen in BM-DCs23, which we confirmed (Supplementary Fig. 2). The IL-6 
signaling pathway activates the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STAT3), which has been reported to be involved in the regulation of CTSS 
activity24 We first asked whether IL-6 exerts a direct effect on Ctss expression. Exogenous 
IL-6 enhanced Ctss promoter activity in BM-DCs using the luciferase reporter construct 
described above (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 3). We also investigated whether STAT3 binds 
the Ctss promoter. We identified a canonical consensus sequence for STAT3 binding, 
TTCCnGGAA25, at position −1118, and three additional candidate binding sequences 
upstream of the transcription initiation site of the Ctss (Fig. 3b)26. STAT3 binding to each 
region was assessed by ChIP in wild-type BM-DCs. STAT3 bound at −1118 and −21 but not 
at −2616 and −299, suggesting direct up-regulation of Ctss by IL-6–STAT3 signaling 
pathway in DCs. To confirm the binding of STAT3 to −1118, we deleted this binding site in

 the Ctss promoter region of the luciferase construct. IL-6 did not enhance luciferase 
expression from the construct with the deletion of TTCCnGGAA, while it significantly 
enhanced luciferase expression from the construct with the intact Ctss promoter (Fig. 3b 
right).
To address the regulation of Ctss expression by IL-6 in vivo, we employed two approaches. 
First, we analyzed Ctss expression in DCs of CKO female mice that are haplosufficient for 
IL-6 (Il6+/−). Equivalent Ctss expression was observed in DCs from female Prdm1 CKO 
Il6+/− mice and wild-type mice (Fig. 3c, left). We also administered neutralizing antibody to 
female CKO mice. There was a significant decrease in Ctss expression in DCs from mice 
treated with neutralizing antibody (MP5-20F3) compared to control IgG treated mice (Fig. 
3c. right). Thus, IL-6 participates in positive regulation of Ctss in DCs and likely contributes 
to the increased level of Ctss transcript seen in Blimp-1 deficient female DCs.
Blimp-1 deficient DCs preferentially induce IL-21 producing T cells
The increased numbers of TFH cells in female CKO mice might result from skewed 
differentiation to TFH induced by Blimp-1 deficient DCs as previously reported19 or from 
DC-induced changes in gene expression in TFH cells that lead to enhanced survival of TFH 
cells of CKO mice. Genes encoding transcription factors that positively influence TFH cell 
numbers include Irf4, Maf, Batf and Bcl627. TFH cells were isolated from female wild-type 
and CKO mice and expression of these genes was assessed. Only Bcl6 was significantly 
increased in TFH cells of female CKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting the 
possibility of enhanced survival of TFH cells.
We reasoned that the increased expression of Ctss in Blimp-1 deficient DCs might affect 
antigen presentation by MHCII molecules, influencing the TCR repertoire in a manner 
favorable for the development of autoreactive TFH cells. We, therefore, assayed activation of 
OT-II CD4+ cells that recognize an ovalbumin (OVA) peptide, amino acids 323–339 
(OVA323–339), MHCII complex. CD4+ T cells purified from OT-II mice were co-cultured for 
3 days with CD11c+ cDCs isolated from spleens of female CKO or wild-type mice and 
either intact OVA protein or OVA peptide. T cell proliferation, measured by CFSE dilution, 
was vigorous in the presence of both antigen preparations, regardless of the source of DCs 
(Fig. 4a).
CD4+ T cell activation is characterized also by cytokine production. Splenic DCs pre-
incubated with OVA protein were cultured with OT-II cells and cytokine mRNA expression 
and the percentage of cells staining positive for cytokine protein were measured by qPCR 
and flow cytometry, respectively (Fig. 4b, c). Blimp-1 deficient DCs led to a modest but 
significant increase in IL-2 mRNA, however, the intracellular abundance of IL-2 did not 
differ between T cells co-cultured with wild-type DCs or Blimp-1 deficient DCs. Secreted 
IL-2 concentrations were also not different (Supplementary Fig. 5), explaining the lack of 
difference in proliferation index when T cells were stimulated with either wild-type or 
Blimp-1 deficient DCs.
Many cytokines that are preferentially expressed by TH1, TH2, TH17 or Treg cells were not 
significantly different between cultures with Blimp-1 deficient DCs or wild-type DCs

 (Supplementary Fig. 6). While the expression of IL-21, produced by TFH cells, was 
relatively low compared to other cytokines, IL-21 transcription and protein production were 
greater in cultures with Blimp-1 deficient DCs and intact ovalbumin (Fig. 4b, c and 
Supplementary Fig. 5). The increased IL-21 was dependent on antigen-processing, since it 
was abrogated in cultures in which OVA323–339 peptide was used as antigen (Supplementary 
Fig. 7) and on T-DC contact as it was also abrogated in transwell cultures (Fig. 4b,c). 
Fixation of DCs after incubation with OVA protein also revealed increased expression of 
IL-21 in cultures with Blimp-1 deficient DCs compared to wild-type DCs, although IL-21 
production by fixed DCs of both strains was less than is seen in unfixed cells (Fig. 4b), 
presumably due to both the absence of cytokine secretion and the absence of membrane 
fluidity.
The activation of OT-II T cells by OVA protein represented a cognate interaction between T 
cells and DCs, since the TCR-transgenic T cells were not activated with an irrelevant antigen 
(hen egg lysozyme, HEL) (Supplementary Fig. 8). To confirm that the enhanced T cell 
activation mediated by Blimp-1 deficient DCs resulted from increased CTSS, we treated 
cultures with a CTSS inhibitor, 219393 (~ 400 fold greater selectivity over CTSB)28 or a 
CTSB inhibitor as a control. When the CTSS inhibitor (Fig. 4b, c), but not the CTSB 
inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. 8), was added during OVA processing, there was no increased 
IL-21 production seen in cultures with Blimp-1 deficient DCs. To confirm that CTSS 
functions to alter antigen processing rather than antigen uptake fluorescence-conjugated DQ-
OVA protein was incubated with purified DCs from each strain overnight, and OVA uptake 
was assessed by flow cytometry. There was no significant difference in the level of OVA 
internalized by wild-type and Blimp-1 deficient DCs (Fig. 4d). These data strongly suggest 
that Blimp-1 deficient DCs have altered antigen processing. Thus, increased CTSS alters 
antigen presentation which induces activated CD4+ T cells differentiates to TFH cells.
Diversity of the TFH TCR repertoire
To ask whether the expansion of TFH cells in CKO mice is accompanied by a change in their 
antigenic specificity, we compared the TCR repertoire of TFH cells in wild-type and CKO 
mice. TFH cells were purified from the spleens of young (6–10 weeks old) female and male 
mice. TFH cells were identified by the expression of CXCR5 and PD-1; they also expressed 
Bcl-6 (~95%) and ICOS-1 (~70%) (Fig. 5a). Although no autoantibodies are detected at this 
age, there was already an increase in number of TFH cells in female CKO mice compared to 
wild-type mice (Fig. 5a). We focused on Vβ sequences as these are more diverse than Vα 
sequences. We analyzed over 100,000 TFH Vβ sequences from each of 5 female and 5 male 
mice of each strain. TFH cells from female CKO mice exhibited a more diverse repertoire 
than TFH cells of female wild-type mice. Importantly, TFH cells from male CKO and wild-
type mice exhibited similar diversity (Fig. 5b).
To confirm that the diverse TCR Vβ repertoire in TFH cells was associated with 
autoimmunity, we examined the Vβ repertoire of wild-type and CKO female mice 
haplosufficient for Il6. As previously shown, neither of these strains develops disease. No 
difference in repertoire diversity was seen consistent with their similar TFH cell numbers

 (Fig. 5b). Thus, the more diverse repertoire was seen only in association with a lupus 
phenotype.
CTSS inhibitor suppresses the development of lupus
Based on the increased activity of CTSS in Blimp-1 deficient DCs and the promising effects 
of CTSS inhibition on TFH differentiation in vitro, we investigated whether CTSS inhibition 
would suppress the development of the lupus-like phenotype in CKO mice as had previously 
been shown in MRL/lpr mice29. First, we assessed lymphocyte development following long-
term treatment with RO5461111. Accumulation of the p10 Ii fragment of invariant chain 
was seen in splenocytes of RO5461111-treated wild-type and CKO mice but not in 
splenocytes of mice fed control chow, demonstrating the efficacy of the treatment (Fig. 6a). 
RO5461111 treatment did not alter the overall frequency of either lymphocytes or DC 
subsets in wild-type mice (Fig. 6b). DC activation measured by class II expression was also 
not affected (Fig. 6b). RO5461111 was given to female CKO mice to investigate whether 
CTSS inhibition prevents the development of lupus-like phenotypes. Splenomegaly was 
suppressed by CTSS inhibition with a reduction in the number of splenocytes in 
RO5461111-treated CKO mice (Fig. 6c). Ciita expression was not altered in splenic DCs in 
RO5461111 treated CKO mice (Fig. 6d). RO5461111-treated CKO mice showed 
significantly reduced titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies at both 4 and 6 months (Fig. 6e). 
Proteinuria and IgG deposition in glomeruli was also significantly lower in RO5461111 
treated compared to non-treated CKO mice (Fig. 6f, g).
The frequency of TFH and TEM cells was significantly reduced in RO5461111-treated CKO 
mice (~3.5- and 2-fold respectively) (Fig. 7a) while the frequency of naïve T cells 
(CD44loCD62Lhi) was slightly higher in RO5461111-treated than in non-treated CKO mice 
(~ 2 fold). Consistent with the reduction in TFH cells, the frequency of GC B cells and 
plasma cells was also severely decreased (~ 10 fold) in RO5461111-treated CKO mice (Fig. 
7b, c). These data demonstrate increased CTSS expression promotes the development of a 
lupus-like phenotype in CKO mice, and that inhibition of CTSS activity can suppress the 
development of disease.
Finally, the Vβ repertoire was significantly less diverse in TFH from RO5461111-treated 
CKO mice than untreated CKO mice (Fig. 7d). Thus, higher CTSS expression and activity in 
DCs leads to a TFH population with greater TCR diversity.
Discussion
Alterations in antigen presentation can lead to autoimmune or inflammatory diseases30. 
Human genetic studies have shown that HLAII genes represent prominent risk alleles for 
autoimmune diseases, including SLE31, 32. As HLA molecules are critical in establishing 
thresholds for T cell selection and activation, the TCR repertoire has been presumed to be a 
key contributor to many autoimmune diseases33.
A role for Blimp-1 in antigen presentation was initially suggested in a study showing that 
Blimp-1 regulates expression of Ciita, a positive regulator of MHCII expression in B cells20. 
More recently, Blimp-1 was shown to regulate MHCII in DCs, thereby affecting the

 threshold for CD4+ TH cell activation in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE)34.
The importance of antigen presentation prompted us to investigate whether Blimp-1 alters 
antigen presentation to T cells and, thus, the TCR repertoire. Blimp-1 deficient DCs show 
altered expression of several genes involved in antigen presentation including Ctss. Blimp-1 
deletion led to increased Ctss transcription in DCs because Blimp-1 is a transcriptional 
repressor of Ctss and of Il6. IL-6 is highly expressed in Blimp-1 deficient DCs of female 
mice leading to increased Ctss expression. Thus, Bimp-1 directly and indirectly regulates 
Ctss expression. As described in a previous study, increased IL-6 and STAT3 activation also 
decreases Cst3 expression, subsequently enhancing CTSS activity24. The increased CTSS 
activity in DCs of female CKO mice led to increased diversity in the TCR repertoire of TFH 
cells which was abrogated by a CTSS-specific inhibitor. These findings suggest that an 
increase in CTSS expression associated with absence or low expression of Blimp-1 
generates a repertoire more skewed to self- reactivity. While it is likely that the PRDM1 risk 
allele for SLE leads to a more diverse TFH repertoire also, this requires confirmation in risk 
allele and non-risk allele human subjects.
The importance of appropriate expression of CTSS in antigen presentation is now widely 
accepted and its molecular mechanism has been investigated in other studies.. Modulation of 
expression of CTSS and CTSL led to alterations in the pool of peptides which are presented 
in class II molecules in an in vitro study10, 35. Thymic DCs express CTSS and efficiently 
cleave a number of known autoantigens; when CTSS concentrations are increased, it is 
presumed those T cell epitopes that mediate negative selection are destroyed, allowing 
escape of autoreactive T cells to the periphery12. Conversely, CTSS deficient mice are 
markedly resistant to the development of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis 
(EAMG)36. Our current study definitively shows that enhanced CTSS in DCs can lead to an 
alteration of T cell repertoire in the TFH compartment. Notably, increased CTSS was 
observed in serum from SLE and lupus nephritis patients37
An increased frequency of TFH cells in peripheral lymphoid organs is a commonly observed 
phenotype in animal models of SLE38,39. However, it has not been clearly understood 
whether an increased number of TFH cells predisposes to autoimmunity or whether the 
antigenic specificity of the TFH cells in these models is also altered. The antigenic specificity 
of activated CD4+ T cells is largely determined by encounter with peptide: MHCII 
complexes on DCs40, 41. While TCR selection occurs in the thymus, differentiation of 
effector T cells occurs in the periphery when CD4+ T cells encounter APCs presenting 
specific peptide: MHCII complexes42. We do not yet know whether the differential TCR 
repertoire of TFH cells observed in our study is determined by selection in the thymus or 
activation in the periphery. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates the importance of precise 
regulation of CTSS in APCs in determining the T cell repertoire and the fate of autoreactive 
T cells.
Recently, a CTSS inhibitor was shown to prevent disease onset in the MRL/lpr lupus mouse 
model29. Our study also demonstrated that CTSS inhibition can prevent disease onset and 
lupus related phenotypes in CKO mice. More interestingly, inhibitor treatment made the

 TCR repertoire of TFH cells less diverse. Because long-term treatment with inhibitor did not 
reduce MHCII expression on DCs, we speculate that the major function of the inhibitor is to 
change the pool of peptides presented on class II in vivo.
These data help explain how the SLE-associated PRDM1 risk allele with low expression of 
Blimp-1 and high expression of IL-6 in DCs contributes to the risk of developing SLE.
Online Methods
Mice
Prdm1 CKO mice (Prdm1fl/fCd11c-Cre+) and wild-type (littermate control Prdm1fl/flCd11c-
Cre−) mice on a C57BL/6 background are bred and maintained in a specific pathogen-free 
facility at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research. OT-II mice were purchased from 
Jackson laboratory (B6.Cg-Tg (TcraTcrb) 425Cbn/J).
All the experiments conducted in this study strictly followed the guidance in the Guide for 
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol 
was approved by the committee on the Ethics of Animal Welfare of The Feinstein Institute 
for Medical Research (protocol number 2009-048). All the animals were euthanized at the 
end time point of experiments by CO2 instillation.
Sample size to achieve adequate power was chosen based on our previous studies with 
similar methods. We randomized the female or male mice from different cages and different 
time points to exclude cage or batch variation. Experiments and data analysis was performed 
without afore-mentioned genotype or treatment information.
Preparation of PBMCs, blood DCs and in vitro differentiation of MO-DCs
The protocol for study of human samples was approved by the IRB of the Feinstein Institute 
for Medical Research (FIMR) (approval number: 09-081A). Healthy PRDM1 rs548234 risk 
allele carriers and non-risk allele controls were identified from the Genotype and Phenotype 
(GAP) registry at the FIMR and obtained the informed consent from all participants. Both 
cohorts consisted of hormonally active females under 55 years old and were of various race 
and ethnicity. Participants consented for the study prior to their participation. Total PBMCs 
were collected by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation. Briefly, whole blood or leukopack 
was diluted with HBSS (Life Technologies) and layered on the Ficoll (GE Healthcare Life 
Sciences). Cells were centrifuged at 750g for 20 min without a break at 20 °C. PBMCs were 
collected from the intermediate layer and washed three times with HBSS.
To generate MO-DCs, CD14+ monocytes were purified by EasySep kit (Stem Cell 
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The purity of CD14+ cells was 
determined by flow cytometry with an LRSII (BD Biosciences). After purification, CD14+ 
monocytes were cultured with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 
1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (P/S), 1% L-glutamine, 100 ng/ml of recombinant human 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Peprotech) and 100 ng/ml of 
recombinant human IL-4 (Peprotech) for 7 days.

 CTSS inhibitor treatment
The protocol was adapted from a published study29 with modifications. Briefly, three-week-
old female Prdm1 CKO mice were randomized to receive either a medicated diet formulated 
by mixing the CTSS inhibitor (RO5461111 (provided by F.Hoffman-La Roche), 262.5 
mg/kg chow) or standard diet (control) (n = 20 in each group). When the mice became 7–8 
weeks old (duration of inhibitor treatment is a minimum of 4 weeks), mice were sacrificed 
and spleens were collected for TFH cell TCR repertoire experiments (n = 5 in each group). 
Additional mice were sacrificed at age 6 months or 10 months to investigate lupus-like 
phenotypes (n = 10 in each group) and lupus nephritis phenotype (n = 5 in each group), 
respectively.
To confirm the CTSS inhibitor activity in vivo, p10 of Ii accumulation was measured in total 
splenocytes by immunoblotting. Spleens were collected from control mice and RO5461111 
treated mice and lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), containing protease 
inhibitor (Roche). Total protein was transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and the 
membrane was incubated with anti-CD74 polyclonal antibodies (R&D systems). The 
membrane was developed with ECL (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Purification of TFH cells for TCRβ sequencing
Age- and gender-matched control and Prdm1 CKO mice, or Il6+/− female Prdm1 CKO mice 
were sacrificed at 6–8 weeks old and spleens were collected for TFH cell purification. CD4+ 
TFH cells (defined by TCRβ+CD4+CXCR5+PD-1+ICOS-1+) were sorted on the FACSAria 
(BD Biosciences). Sorted TFH cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C 
until sequencing.
Amplification and analysis of the TFH TCR repertoire diversity
For each FACS-sorted TFH cell population, the cells were treated with 1 ml of TRI reagent 
(Life Technologies) and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol of 
the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was generated from total RNA using a 
SuperScript RT II kit (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT primer. The resulting cDNA was used as 
template for FastStart High Fidelity PCR amplification (Roche) using mouse-specific 
barcoded constant region primer (5’-GCACTGATGTTCTGTGTGACAG-3′) and 23 Vβ-
specific primers43. The PCR products were gel-purified to isolate the amplified TCR Vβ 
DNA and total quantities were determined with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). 200 ng of 
DNA per mouse was processed for Illumina MiSeq DNA sequencing according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced, yielding 2–5 × 105 raw sequences per mouse.
All sequencing data was first processed using the sequence quality and signal filters of the 
Illumina MiSeq pipeline and then subjected to bioinformatics analysis that relied on 
homologies to conserved framework regions using the MiXCR software package. Vβ CDR3 
sequences were then clustered using the CD-HIT software package with a 90% amino acid 
sequence similarity cut-off. Repertoire diversity for each mouse was determined by 
calculating the true Shannon diversity of 3 or more subsamples of 105 sequences and the 
results were averaged for each mouse and the diversity indices normalized to the wild-type 
mice.
In vitro OT-II T cell activation with DCs
CD11chiMHCIIhi cDCs were sorted from spleens of age-matched female control or Blimp-1 
CKO mice (6–8 weeks old) by FACSAria. cDCs were resuspended at 106/ml with 
recombinant mouse GM-CSF (20 ng/ml) and 100 µl (105 cDCs) was plated at 96-well flat-
bottom plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). CD4+ T cells were sorted from lymph nodes of 
female OT-II mice and mixed with cDCs at ratio of 1:10 (DC:T). For OVA protein-derived 
antigen presentation, 10 µg/ml of OVA protein (InvivoGen) was added to cDCs and 
incubated for overnight before T cell co-culture. OVA323–339 peptide (InvivoGen) (0.1–10 
ng/ml) or HEL (10 µg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to cDCs. CTSS inhibitor (1 nM) or 
CTSB (10 nM), was added with OVA protein incubation in certain experiments. To measure 
T cell proliferation, OT-II CD4+ T cells were labeled with 10 µM CFSE (Invitrogen). 
Transwell experiments were performed in 0.4 µm plates (Corning). cDCs purified from 
wild-type or CKO mice were plated on upper wells and CD4+ OT-II T cells were cultured 
with OVA-presenting wild-type DCs on the bottom wells. Purified DCs from wild-type or

 CKO mice were cultured with OVA protein for 6 hour and fixed with 0.001% glutaraldehyde 
for 30 sec. Fixation was terminated by 0.2 M glycine treatment followed by washing three 
times with PBS.
Measurement of CTSS activity
In vitro CTSS enzyme activity was measured by fluorometric analysis kit (Abcam). DCs 
were purified by cell sorter and equal number of DCs (1 × 106) from wild-type or Prdm1 
CKO mice were lysed in cell lysis buffer. An equal volume of reaction buffer was added into 
the cell lysis and amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC)-labeled CTSS substrate peptide 
(Ac-VVR-AFC) (200 µM) was added and incubated for 2 hour at 37 °C. For negative 
control, CTSS inhibitor was added to the substrate mixture or a reaction mixture that does 
not contain cell lysate was prepared. After incubation, samples were read in a fluorometer 
with a 400 nm excitation and 505 nm emission. Fold change in CTSS activity was 
determined by comparing the relative fluorescence units (RFU) to the level in the negative 
control sample.
ChIP assay
5 µg of anti-BLIMP-1 polyclonal antibody (sc-13206, Santa Cruz Biotech) or normal goat 
IgG were conjugated with 50 µl of Protein G-magnetic beads (Invitrogen) by overnight 
incubation. CD11chiMHCIIhi cDCs were purified from spleens of wild-type or Prdm1 CKO 
mice. Purified DCs (5–10 × 106 cells per experiment) were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde 
(final concentration) for 10 min at 20 °C. To quench cross-linking, 1.375 M Glycine (100 
µl/ml) was added and cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in 
cell lysis buffer and subjected to sonication. Antibody-conjugated magnetic beads were 
incubated with sonicated DNA at 4 °C with rotation. The next day, unbound DNA was 
washed away and the antibody bound complex was eluted in elution buffer. The protein and 
DNA complex was de-crosslinked at 65 °C overnight. DNA was further purified by RNase 
treatment and DNA cleanup using PCR cleanup kit (QIAGEN). Purified DNA was used for 
PCR.
Kidney histology
Kidneys collected from animals at the end of experiments (6 month-old) were cut into two 
pieces longitudinally. One half was frozen with tissue freezing, Tissue-Tek O.C.T. 
compound medium (Fisher) and the other half was immediately fixed with 4% formaldehyde 
(Sigma-Aldrich) and kept in 70 % alcohol at 4 °C. Frozen or fixed sections were sliced to 7 
mm thickness and stored until staining. To detect immunoglobulin deposition, frozen kidney 
section was fixed with Acetone (−20 °C for 5 min) and blocked with blocking solution (2 % 
BSA, 0.5 % TritonX-100, 2 % normal goat serum (Invitrogen) in PBS) for 1 hour at 20 °C. 
Alexafluoro 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:200 in blocking solution) was incubated with 
tissue for 2 hour at 20 °C. Tissue was washed with PBS three times and analyzed by 
microscope.

 Anti-dsDNA and albumin ELISA
To measure the titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies, Prdm1 CKO mice or RO5461111 fed Prdm1 
CKO mice were bled at indicated ages (2 months, 4 months and 6 months old). Mouse 
serum was prepared from blood and frozen at −20 °C until assayed. 96-well plates (Costar) 
were coated with 100 µg/ml of sonicated and filtered calf thymus DNAs (Sigma-Aldrich). 
The plate was blocked with 3% FCS for 1 hour at 20 °C, and diluted samples from 
experimental mice or positive control (old NZB/W F1) mice were incubated for 2 hours. The 
plate was washed and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were applied. The 
reaction was developed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich). OD was monitored 
at 405 nm.
Urine samples were collected from 6 month old mice maintained in metabolic cages. 
Albumin concentrations in urine samples were measured by mouse albumin ELISA 
quantitation set (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Luciferase assays
BM-DCs (2 × 106 cells) were transfected with a wild-type or mutated Ctss promoter 
construct by Nucleofector kit (Lonza). Luciferase plasmid and Tk-Renilla luciferase plasmid 
was added to the cells at a 10:1 ratio. Relative light units were measured 6–12 hours post 
transfection using Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega).
Transfection of siRNA and Blimp-1 expression vector
SiRNAs (SR420429) targeting Blimp-1 was purchased from Origene and 200 nM of each 
siRNA or control scrambled siRNA were used for each transfection. Blimp-1 plasmid and 
control plasmid were purchased from Genecopoeia. siRNAs or plasmid were mixed with 
DCs in Nucleofector solution and transfected by Amaxa electroporation (program Y-01). 
Transfected DCs were immediately transferred to culture media (supplemented with GM-
CSF) and further cultured for 2 days.
Bio-Plex
Multiple cytokines were measured by Bio-Plex pro mouse cytokine standard 23-plex, group 
I and group III (Bio-Rad) followed by manufacturer’s protocol. The assay was measured by 
Bio-Plex suspension array system and the data was analyzed by Bio-Plex manager software.
Statistics
Statistical significance was calculated and determined by a nonparametric, Mann-Whitney 
test, and P- values less than 0.05 was considered significant. No exclusion of sample was 
done.

 Figure 1. Increased Ctss in DCs from female Prdm1 CKO mice
(a) Splenic CD11c+ cDCs were purified from 6–8 week old female wild-type or CKO mice 
and gene expression was measured by qPCR using specific primers and relative expression 
of each gene was calculated by normalization to Polr2a. Mean ± SEM (n=6 from 3 
independent experiments). (b) mRNA levels of Ctss and Ctsl were measured in splenic cDCs 
or BM-DCs from the age-matched female wild-type (open circle) or CKO mice (closed 
circle) by qPCR. The relative expression was normalized to the level of Hprt. Each dot 
represents an individual mouse and the bar represents the mean ± SEM (n=9 for splenic DCs 
and n=6 for BM-DCs from 3 independent experiments). (c) mRNA amount of Ctss in blood 
cDCs (a representative flow image, top) from age-matched female wild-type or Prdm1 CKO 
mice was measured by qPCR and the relative expression was normalized to the level of 
Hprt. Each dot represents an individual mouse and the bar represents the mean± SEM (n=4 
from 2 individual experiments). (d) Enzyme activity of CTSS in cDCs was measured in 
vitro. Fold-increase in CTSS activity was determined by comparing the fluorescence units 
with the fluorescence of the unincubated control. In the box-and-whisker plot, horizontal 
bars indicate the median, boxes indicate 25th to 75th percentile, and whiskers indicate 10th

 Figure 2. Blimp-1 regulates Ctss expression in DCs
(a) Blimp-1 binds to the promoter of Ctss in vivo. DNA was prepared from purified cDCs 
prepared from spleens of female wild-type or CKO mice, and immunoprecipitated with 
antibody to Blimp-1 or goat polyclonal IgG. Specific sequences were amplified by Ctss 
promoter specific primers and visualized in agarose gel (upper panel, one representative 
image from 4 independent experiments) and quantified by qPCR (lower panel). In the box-
and-whisker plot, horizontal bars indicate the median, boxes indicate 25th to 75th percentile, 
and whiskers indicate 10th and 90th percentile (n=4 from 4 individual experiments). (b) 
Increased Blimp-1 suppresses Ctss promoter activity. A Ctss promoter/luciferase plasmid 
was transfected alone or together with a GFP control vector or a Prdm1 GFP vector at a 2:1 
ratio into BM-DCs. 24 hours later, the transfection efficiency was measured by the 
expression of GFP by flow cytometry (one representative GFP flow image from 4 individual 
experiments is in the upper panel and quantitation is in the bottom left graph). Ctss-promoter 
(Luciferase) activity and control luciferase (Renilla) activity was measured immediately 
after. Luciferase activity was normalized to the level of renilla luciferas. In the box-and-
whisker plot, horizontal bars indicate the median, boxes indicate 25th to 75th percentile, and 
whiskers indicate 10th and 90th percentile (n=4). (c) Knockdown of endogenous Prdm1 
increases Ctss expression in BM-DCs. Prdm1 siRNA or scrambled (control) siRNA was 
transfected into BM-DCs. 48 hours later, Prdm1 and Ctss mRNA were measured by qPCR.

 Figure 3. IL-6 plays a role in Ctss expression in DCs
(a) Stimulation with IL-6 increases Ctss promoter activity. 2 µg of Ctss promoter/luciferase 
plasmid was transfected into BM-DCs. Transfected BM-DCs were further cultured with or 
without IL-6 (100 ng/ml) for 2 hours. Luciferase activity was measured by luminometer. 
Each dot represents an individual experiment. (b) In vivo binding of STAT3 in Ctss 
promoter. Putative STAT3 binding sites are depicted and primers are labeled (double arrow) 
as position 1 through 4. ChIP assay was performed in IL-6 (100 ng/ml) stimulated BM-DCs. 
After stimulation, BM-DCs were cross-linked and DNA was incubated with either control 
IgG or anti-STAT3 antibody (124H6) overnight. After precipitation, qPCR was performed 
with each primer set. Fos and Myc genes were amplified as positive controls. % of input was 
calculated relative level to the total input. Each dot represents an individual experiment and 
the bar represents the mean ± SEM (n=3). A mutant luciferase construct was made as 
depicted in the diagram (box), and the promoter activity was measured by the luciferase 
assay. Each dot represents an individual sample (n=3). (c) Increased expression of Ctss is 
abrogated in DCs from Il6+/− Prdm1 CKO mice (left panel) or from anti-IL-6 antibody 
(MP5-20F3) treated mice (right panel). To inhibit IL-6, 50 µg of anti-IL-6 or control IgG 
was injected into mice i.p. for 2 weeks. Splenic DCs were prepared from female wild-type 
or CKO mice (either from Il6+/+ or Il6+/− mice) or from antibody treated mice. Ctss

 Figure 4. Preferential differentiation of IL-21 producing T cells by co-culture with Blimp-1 
deficient DCs in vitro
DCs (spleens of female wild-type (open symbol) or CKO (closed symbol) mice) and OT-II 
CD4+ T cells were co-cultured for 3 days at various ratios of DCs to T cells with OVA 
protein (10 µg/ml). (a) To assess proliferation, OT-II T cells were labeled with CFSE (10 
µM) before co-culture with DCs. Proliferation was measured by calculation of division index 
(total number of divisions/number of starting cells). A representative flow image is 
presented on the left (red line represents wild-type DCs and filled blue represents Blimp-1 
deficient DCs). The box-and-whisker plot, horizontal bars indicate the median, boxes 
indicate 25th to 75th percentile, and whiskers indicate 10th and 90th percentile (n=4). (b) To 
assess cytokine expression, T cells were harvested after co-culture with DCs (either unfixed 
DCs or fixed DCs as designated in figure) and total RNA was purified. Cytokine mRNA was 
measured by qPCR and the relative expression was calculated by normalization to Polr2a. In 
the box-and-whisker plots, horizontal bars indicate the median, boxes indicate 25th to 75th 
percentile, and whiskers indicate 10th and 90th percentile (unfixed DCs (n=12) and fixed 
DCs (n=10)). (c) Protein level of cytokines was measured by intracellular staining of T cells. 
After co-culture, T cells were stimulated with PMA (100 ng/ml)/ionomycin (1 µg/ml) for 6

cells were identified by flow cytometry and their frequency was calculated. In the box-and-
whisker plot, horizontal bars indicate the median, boxes indicate 25th to 75th percentile, and 
whiskers indicate 10th and 90th percentile (n=8). For both (b) and (c), 1 nM CTSS inhibitor 
was added during the OVA protein incubation with DCs or cells were cultured in transwell 
plates. Flow images are from one representative set from 4 individual experiments. (d) DQ-
OVA protein was incubated with DCs from wild-type (open circle) or CKO (closed circle) 
mice overnight. After incubation, DCs were extensively washed and OVA uptake was 
measured by flow cytometry (upper panel, a representative image from 3 individual 
experiments). The Geo MFI is presented as a dot plot graph (bottom graph). Each do 
represents an individual experiment and the bar represents the mean ± SEM (n=3).
