BACKGROUND: Understanding the magnitude of mental health problems, particularly life-
threatening ones, experienced by transgender and/or gender nonconforming (TGNC) youth 
can lead to improved management of these conditions.
METHODS: Electronic medical records were used to identify a cohort of 588 transfeminine and 
745 transmasculine children (3–9 years old) and adolescents (10–17 years old) enrolled in 
integrated health care systems in California and Georgia. Ten male and 10 female referent 
cisgender enrollees were matched to each TGNC individual on year of birth, race and/
or ethnicity, study site, and membership year of the index date (first evidence of gender 
nonconforming status). Prevalence ratios were calculated by dividing the proportion of 
TGNC individuals with a specific mental health diagnosis or diagnostic category by the 
corresponding proportion in each reference group by transfeminine and/or transmasculine 
status, age group, and time period before the index date.
RESULTS: Common diagnoses for children and adolescents were attention deficit disorders 
(transfeminine 15%; transmasculine 16%) and depressive disorders (transfeminine 
49%; transmasculine 62%), respectively. For all diagnostic categories, prevalence was 
severalfold higher among TGNC youth than in matched reference groups. Prevalence ratios 
(95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for history of self-inflicted injury in adolescents 6 months 
before the index date ranged from 18 (95% CI 4.4–82) to 144 (95% CI 36–1248). The 
corresponding range for suicidal ideation was 25 (95% CI 14–45) to 54 (95% CI 18–218).
CONCLUSIONS: TGNC youth may present with mental health conditions requiring immediate 
evaluation and implementation of clinical, social, and educational gender identity support 
measures.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Small, specialized, clinic-
based studies reveal a high prevalence of mental health 
diagnoses and self-reported emotional and behavioral 
problems among transgender and/or gender nonconforming 
youth.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In this large cohort study of an 
unselected transgender and/or gender nonconforming group, 
youth experienced a high relative prevalence of mental health 
conditions such as anxiety, depression, and attention deficit 
disorders compared with their cisgender counterparts.

 As gender identity develops, it may 
not match the gender of rearing or 
gender assigned at birth, which are 
typically based on the appearance 
of external genitalia.1 
– 
3 When 
gender identity differs from the one 
assigned at birth, the terms gender 
diverse or gender nonconforming 
may apply.4, 
5 Although the natural 
history of gender nonconformity 
presented in early childhood remains 
an area of ongoing research, some 
gender nonconforming children may 
go on to adopt an identity that is 
different from their assigned gender 
(10%–30%, according to reported 
estimates).6, 
 
7 Researchers in studies 
of gender development in the general 
population support that gender-
typed behavior is noticeable and 
stable between 3 and 8 years of age, 
especially in children with relatively 
high or low gender-typical behavior.8, 
 
9  
Individuals may identify as 
transgender, a term that refers more 
narrowly to those whose identity is 
“opposite” of their assigned gender.10 
Conversely, individuals who identify 
with the gender assigned to them at 
birth are sometimes referred to as 
cisgender.10
An important priority for the health 
of transgender and/or gender 
nonconforming (TGNC) children 
and adolescents is the identification 
and management of mental health 
conditions.11 
– 
13 These conditions 
may be related to gender dysphoria, 
which is defined as a feeling of 
distress when one’s assigned gender 
does not match their identity.14 
In addition, children with gender 
nonconforming behavior may 
experience stress from prejudice 
and discrimination because of being 
part of a minority group, which can 
create or exacerbate emotional and 
behavioral problems.15
The literature on TGNC youth 
consistently reveals a high 
prevalence of self-reported emotional 
and behavioral problems and mental 
health diagnoses.16 
– 
23 Most of the 
available data used to address 
the mental health status of TGNC 
youth come from specialized clinics 
providing care to this population.24 
Although researchers in clinic-
based studies offer detailed and 
high-quality data, 
25, 
 
26 they often 
lack information on individuals who 
have not sought or had no access 
to specialized care. Moreover, a 
reliance on specialized clinics to 
identify study participants may yield 
relatively small sample sizes, making 
it difficult to select comparable 
reference groups from the same 
underlying population.27
These issues motivated the 
researchers in the Study of 
Transition, Outcomes, and Gender 
(STRONG), which was designed to 
assess morbidity among TGNC people 
overall and in the transfeminine 
and transmasculine subgroups of 
different ages, and captured in any 
care setting. However, this study 
communication is focused on cohort 
members who first presented as 
TGNC before their 18th birthday. 
Our objectives in this study were 
to estimate the prevalence of 
mental health diagnoses among 
transfeminine and transmasculine 
children and adolescents at the 
time of their initial presentation 
(index date) and compare their 
mental health status to that of their 
cisgender counterparts.
METHODS
The STRONG was designed as an 
electronic medical record (EMR)–
based retrospective and prospective 
cohort study of members at 3 Kaiser 
Permanente (KP) sites (Georgia, 
Northern California, and Southern 
California) in partnership with the 
coordinating center at the Emory 
University Rollins School of Public 
Health. These KP sites provide 
comprehensive health services 
to >8.8 million members who are 
sociodemographically diverse and 
representative of their respective 
communities.28, 
 
29 In the clinical 
setting, the identification of TGNC 
youth may begin at age 13 years 
during physical examinations as part 
of the psychosocial and/or behavioral 
assessment recommended by the 
American Academy of Pediatrics30; 
however, some TGNC children 
may be identified earlier or later 
in life. All activities were reviewed 
and approved by the institutional 
review boards of the 4 participating 
institutions.
As described previously, 
31, 
 
32 
persons with first evidence of 
TGNC status between January 1, 
2006, and December 31, 2014, 
were identified on the basis of 
International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Edition (ICD-9) 
codes and the presence of specific 
keywords in free-text clinical notes 
(Supplemental Table 5). TGNC status 
was then verified (Supplemental Fig 
1). A second free-text program was 
developed with additional anatomy-
related or gender-affirmation 
keywords, which were reviewed and 
adjudicated for transfeminine or 
transmasculine status (Supplemental 
Table 6). Transfeminine and/or 
transmasculine status was assigned 
by using demographic information 
from the EMRs of 220 children 
whose gender assignment could 
not be determined from text strings 
because a validation revealed that 
the demographic variable accurately 
reflected assigned gender in 96% 
of youth. Subjects with evidence of 
disorders of sex development (eg, 
variation of chromosomal, gonadal, 
and/or anatomic sex development) 
were excluded because they may 
have distinct medical histories and 
gender identity trajectories.33
Ten male and 10 female cisgender 
KP enrollees were matched to each 
member of the final validated TGNC 
cohort on the basis of year of birth, 
race and/or ethnicity, site, and 
membership year of the index date. 
Because reference group enrollees 
had not been identified as TGNC by 
the methods described above, they

 were assumed to be cisgender (ie, 
no evidence that gender identity 
does not correspond to assigned 
gender at birth). The race and/or 
ethnicity categories used were non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic African 
American, Asian American and/or 
Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and other 
races. Index date was defined on the 
basis of the first recorded evidence of 
TGNC status. For some TGNC cohort 
members, <10 matched reference 
cisgender males or females were 
available; no TGNC individual was 
matched to <7 referents of either sex.
Subjects 3 through 17 years old 
at the index date were included in 
this study. Children <3 years old 
were excluded to reduce possible 
instability in gender identification and 
mental health diagnoses among the 
cohort.8 The ICD-9 codes for mental 
health diagnoses were grouped into 
categories of conditions according 
to recommendations from the 
Mental Health Research Network34: 
anxiety disorders, attention deficit 
disorders, autism spectrum disorders, 
bipolar disorders, conduct and/
or disruptive disorders, depressive 
disorders, eating disorders, other 
psychoses, personality disorders, 
schizophrenia spectrum disorders, 
self-inflicted injuries (including 
poisonings), substance use disorders, 
and suicidal ideation (Supplemental 
Table 7). People could be represented 
more than once if they had multiple 
diagnoses and were thus counted in 
each category for which they had a 
diagnosis.
The prevalence of mental health 
conditions in each of these categories 
was calculated for 2 time windows: 
any time (ever) and within 6 months 
before the index date. These 2 time 
windows were selected to examine 
mental health status just proximal to 
TGNC identification and to capture 
longer-standing conditions diagnosed 
at earlier ages (eg, autism spectrum 
disorders). In these calculations, 
the numerator for each disorder 
or group of disorders included 
persons with at least 1 relevant 
diagnostic code recorded during 
the time interval of interest. All 
prevalence estimates were calculated 
separately for transfeminine and 
transmasculine subjects within 2 
age groups: 3 to 9 years (children) 
and 10 to 17 years (adolescents). 
Age categorization was selected to 
separately represent young school-
aged children and adolescents by 
using the adolescent starting age of 
10 years, corresponding to the World 
Health Organization’s definition.35 To 
assess differences in the severity of 
the conditions of interest, additional

 analyses were conducted for 
admittance or most serious diagnoses 
associated with hospitalizations.
Each prevalence estimate in the 
TGNC cohort was compared with 
corresponding estimates among 
matched cisgender male and female 
referents. For ease in presenting 
results, cisgender males and females 
will be referred to as male or female 
referents. Referents were assigned 
the same index date as the matched 
TGNC cohort member. For rare 
events (prevalence ≤10% in both 
the TGNC and referent cohorts), 
the prevalence ratios (PRs) were 
approximated by calculating the odds 
ratios with exact 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). For events with >10% 
prevalence in either group, PRs and 
CIs were calculated by using logistic 
regression with the log link option.
In addition to the primary analysis 
that captures the true prevalence 
of mental health conditions, we 
conducted sensitivity analyses to 
address possible differences in 
the prevalence of mental health 
conditions because of differences 
in health care visit frequency (use) 
between TGNC cohort members and 
those in the referent groups. We 
excluded the index date from the 
time window, and when the sample 
size was sufficient (>5 cases in 
each group), the PR estimates were 
adjusted for use of care. Average 
health care use was calculated for 
each individual by dividing the total 
number of visits by the cumulative 
duration of enrollment; this was 
expressed as the number of visits per 
year of enrollment in the analyses of 
“ever” prevalence and as the number 
of visits per month of enrollment in 
the analyses within 6 months before 
the index date. In adjusted analyses, 
average use was dichotomized for 
each time interval as above (high) 
or below (low) the median by using 
cutoffs for the overall population.
Analyses were conducted by using 
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, 
Cary, NC) with custom macros 
developed at the Biostatistics and 
Bioinformatics Shared Resource 
at the Winship Cancer Institute of 
Emory University.36
RESULTS
A total of 2164 cohort candidates 3 
to 17 years of age at the index date 
were initially identified in the EMR. 
After validation, 1347 (62%) were 
confirmed as TGNC. People excluded 
from the TGNC cohort were most 
often those with keywords referring 
to family or partners, standard 
disclaimers not related to care (eg, 
listing indications for hormone 
use), or evidence of disorders of 
sex development. After excluding 
subjects with unknown gender 
assigned at birth (N = 14), the final 
analysis data set was based on a 
cohort of 1333 subjects matched with

Downloaded from 
 13 151 reference males and 13 149 
reference females.
The cohort included 588 (44%) 
transfeminine and 745 (56%) 
transmasculine children and 
adolescents (Table 1). Children 
<10 years old represented 27% 
of the transfeminine cohort and 
12% of the transmasculine cohort. 
Compared with TGNC children 
(n = 251), in which 36% (n = 90) 
were transfeminine, 61% (n = 
655) of adolescents (n = 1082) 
were transmasculine. More than 
45% of subjects in both groups 
were white; Hispanics represented 
30% of transfeminine and 27% of 
transmasculine subjects, whereas 
the remainder of the study 
population was approximately 
equally distributed among African 
Americans, Asian Americans and/
or Pacific Islanders, and persons 
whose race and/or ethnicity was 
characterized as other or unknown. 
Health care use levels were much 
higher in both transfeminine and 
transmasculine subjects than in 
those in the corresponding reference 
groups.
The most common diagnostic 
categories among TGNC children 
3 to 9 years of age were attention 
deficit disorders (15% transfeminine; 
16% transmasculine) and anxiety 
disorders (12% transfeminine; 16% 
transmasculine; Table 2). The PR 
(95% CI) estimates for attention 
deficit disorders ranged from 2.8 
(95% CI 1.6–4.9) to 13 (95% CI 
5.9–27). The PR (95% CI) estimates 
for anxiety disorders ranged from 
4.4 (95% CI 2.6–7.4) to 23 (95% 
CI 8.8–69) depending on the time 
window before the index date 
and the reference group. Among 
transfeminine children, 5% had an 
autism spectrum disorder diagnosis; 
however, no cases were observed 
in transmasculine children. For 
all the diagnostic categories, the 
most pronounced PR estimates 
were observed within the 6-month 
period before the index date. 
Among transfeminine children, 
the highest PR (95% CI) estimate 
was for conduct and/or disruptive 
disorders relative to reference 
females (83 [95% CI 11–3707]). 
Among transmasculine children, the 
highest PR (95% CI) estimate was 
for depressive disorders relative 
to reference males (43 [95% CI 
8.4–422]). Additional analyses of the 
prevalence of hospitalizations by 
mental health diagnostic category 
were not possible in this age group 
because of small sample sizes.
In the adolescent group (age 10–17 
years), like in the younger age 
group, attention deficit disorders 
and anxiety disorders remained 
common (“ever” prevalence: 
25% transfeminine and 16% 
transmasculine; 40% both 
transfeminine and transmasculine, 
respectively; Table 3). The 
diagnostic category with the highest 
prevalence in this age group was 
depressive disorders, which were 
found in 49% of transfeminine and 
62% of transmasculine subjects. 
For all diagnostic categories, PR 
estimates used to compare STRONG 
adolescents to matched reference 
groups were highest within 6 
months before the index date. 
Compared with reference females, 
transfeminine and transmasculine 
adolescents experienced particularly 
pronounced increased prevalence 
in psychoses (PR 101 and 95% CI 
14–4375; PR 30 and 95% CI 12–94, 
respectively). Additionally, the PR 
estimates among transfeminine 
subjects were particularly elevated 
for autism spectrum disorders 
(PR 261; 95% CI 43–10 734) and 
among transmasculine subjects for 
schizophrenia spectrum disorders 
(PR 50; 95% CI 11–470) compared 
with reference females. Compared 
with reference males, PR estimates 
for suicidal ideation and self-inflicted 
injuries for transfeminine subjects 
were 54 (95% CI 18–218) and 70 
(95% CI 9.0–159), respectively, 
which were also high among 
transmasculine subjects, (45 [95% CI 
23–97] and 144 [95% CI 14–4338], 
respectively).
When prevalence estimates were 
limited to mental health conditions 
recorded during hospitalizations, 
the patterns among adolescents 
generally remained the same. In 
several instances, however, the PR 
estimates could not be calculated 
because of the absence of cases in the 
reference groups (Table 4).
The median cutoff values used for 
adjusted analyses were 3.2 average 
visits per year for the “ever” analyses 
and 0.2 average visits per month for 
the 6-month analyses. The prevalence 
estimates were slightly attenuated or 
remained approximately the same for 
most diagnostic categories. However, 
some estimates changed appreciably. 
For children 3 to 9 years, adjusting 
for use 6 months before and 
excluding the index date produced 
the largest decrease in the PR (95% 
CI) for anxiety disorders, from 23 
(95% CI 8.8–69) to 9.0 (95% CI 
2.9–29) when transfeminine children 
were compared with reference males 
(Supplemental Table 8). The PR 
(95% CI) for suicidal ideation among 
transfeminine adolescents compared 
with reference males within 6 
months of the index date decreased 
from 54 (95% CI 18–218) to 38 (95% 
CI 12–159; Supplemental Table 9).
DISCUSSION
The results of this study reveal that 
among TGNC youth, mental health 
conditions, specifically anxiety 
and depression, are common and 
often severe among adolescents, as 
evidenced by diagnoses associated 
with hospitalizations. Gender 
nonconforming children (3–9 years 
of age) have a higher prevalence 
of anxiety and attention deficit 
disorders compared with their 
cisgender counterparts. In nearly all

Downloaded from 
 instances, mental health diagnoses 
were more common in the TGNC 
youth than in referent children and 
adolescents.
These results support findings 
from previous research in which 
the sample sizes were much 
smaller.17,

42 Researchers in 
a survey of 101 transfeminine and 
transmasculine patients ages 12 
to 24 years in a transgender youth 
clinic in Los Angeles found that 
35% had symptoms of depression 
and >50% had suicidal thoughts.19 
In comparison, we found that 
adolescents had a higher prevalence 
(40%–60%) of depression but a 
lower prevalence of suicidal ideation 
(5%–10%). In a medical record 
abstraction study of 97 transfeminine 
and transmasculine patients ages 4 
to 20 years presenting to the Gender 
Management Service Clinic at Boston 
Children’s Hospital, 44% presented 
with a significant psychiatric history, 
21% had a history of self-mutilation, 
and 9% had documentation of 
suicide attempts.22 In a UK study, a 
baseline chart review of children 5 
to 11 years old referred to a national 
specialty clinic revealed that 17% 
had symptoms of anxiety, and 15% 
had a history of suicidal ideation, 
self-harm, and/or a diagnosis of 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder recorded before entering 
services.39 Our results for children 
were similar for demonstrated 
anxiety (9%–16%) and attention 
deficit disorders (14%–16%). Direct 
comparisons to the current study 
are challenging because there are 
methodological differences. Two 
important differences are the way 
in which mental health conditions 
were ascertained and presentations 
of age. In addition, we included a 
broader population of children and 
adolescents who were not necessarily 
seeking treatment for gender-related 
issues.
In recent years, researchers in 
several studies have suggested that 
gender dysphoria may be associated 
with autism spectrum disorders.43 
– 
45 
The most widely cited evidence 
supporting this hypothesis comes 
from a study of 204 children and/or 
adolescents referred to the Gender 
Identity Clinic in Amsterdam.46 The 
presence of an autism spectrum 
disorder was established via a 
standardized diagnostic interview, 
47  
yielding a prevalence of 10%  
among transfeminine patients and 
4% among transmasculine patients, 
which was reported by the authors 
to be higher than the 1% estimate 
reported in the general population. 
The prevalence of autism spectrum 
disorders in our study was somewhat 
lower (7% in transfeminine and 
3% in transmasculine subjects 
across both age groups), but our 
case ascertainment was based on 
documented diagnostic codes, and 
the denominator in our calculations 
was not limited to children with 
established gender dysphoria.  
With these differences in mind,  
our results are generally comparable 
to those reported in the Dutch  
study.
The gender ratio in this TGNC cohort 
reveals that transfeminine youth 
may present earlier in age than 
transmasculine individuals, which 
may pose a unique challenge to the 
early identification of mental health 
needs in transmasculine children and 
adolescents. Historically, researchers 
in studies of TGNC adolescents have 
reported a greater proportion of 
transfeminine than transmasculine 
subjects, but in recent years, the 
direction of the transmasculine: 
transfeminine ratio appears to have 
changed.48 For example, researchers 
in 1 recent study observed that 
transmasculine youth with gender 
dysphoria (aged 12–24 years) 
presented in significantly higher 
numbers than their transfeminine 
counterparts.19 Our data, which 
were based on EMRs, were used to 
confirm this observation. Therefore, 
providers should also be aware of the 
growing transmasculine population 
needing timely and appropriate 
medical and psychosocial services.
An important contribution of the 
STRONG to the extant literature is 
its relatively large cohort, which 
allowed for focusing on previously 
understudied groups (such as 
young children), and an evaluation 
of relatively rare events (such 
as hospitalizations). In addition, 
the current study was based on 
children and adolescents who 
were not necessarily in specialized 
care and enrolled in a large health 
care system; and we did not 
require participant opt-in. The 
availability of a well-defined source 
population allowed for matching 
transfeminine and transmasculine 
study subjects to male and female 
referents of the same age, race and/
or ethnicity, and geographic region. 
This design feature permitted 
direct comparisons of prevalence 
estimates among transfeminine, 
transmasculine, and cisgender 
referent groups.
A limitation of this study is its cross-
sectional design. Although we were 
able to retrospectively ascertain 
mental health conditions before 
the index date and we matched 
on the basis of membership year, 
a differential ascertainment of 
diagnoses could have occurred. The 
identification of the TGNC cohort was 
based on health care use, which is 
different from the matched referent 
groups. Results from sensitivity 
analyses adjusting for use and 
excluding the index date revealed 
a similar or slight attenuation of 
the PR results for most diagnostic 
categories. However, when adjusting 
for use 6 months before the index 
date, a more notable attenuation of 
PRs was seen in anxiety disorders 
in transfeminine children and 
suicidal ideation in transfeminine 
adolescents compared with reference 
males, indicating possible higher 
surveillance of mental health 
conditions in the several months

 before cohort identification. 
Nevertheless, this baseline study 
reveals that TGNC youth experience a 
multitude of mental health problems 
before initial presentation. However, 
there is indication that TGNC 
children who receive meaningful 
gender identity support do not 
necessarily experience elevated rates 
of depression and anxiety.49 As the 
STRONG cohort follow-up extends, it 
will be possible to examine temporal 
changes in the frequency and 
severity of mental health problems, 
particularly in relation to the age of 
gender affirmation, which is an area 
of considerable uncertainty, and 
the impact of interventions to treat 
gender dypshoria.50

CONCLUSIONS
The most important finding is the 
high frequency of mental health 
conditions that TGNC children and 
adolescents experience. Especially 
worrisome are the results for 
suicidal ideation and self-inflicted 
injuries with prevalence estimates 
orders of a magnitude that is higher 
in TGNC children and adolescents 
than in matched cisgender reference 
groups. For nearly all mental 
health disorders, the PRs increased 
during the time window closest to 
the index date. Overall, these data 
reveal that children and adolescents 
presenting as TGNC to health care 
providers may require not only 
thorough and immediate evaluation 
of mental health needs but also 
urgent implementation of social 
and educational measures of gender 
identity support.
