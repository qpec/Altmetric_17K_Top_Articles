background and objective Low-load exercise 
training with blood flow restriction (BFR) can increase 
muscle strength and may offer an effective clinical 
musculoskeletal (MSK) rehabilitation tool. The aim of 
this review was to systematically analyse the evidence 
regarding the effectiveness of this novel training modality 
in clinical MSK rehabilitation.
Design This is a systematic review and meta-analysis 
of peer-reviewed literature examining BFR training 
in clinical MSK rehabilitation (Research Registry; 
researchregistry91).
Data sources A literature search was conducted 
across SPORTDiscus (EBSCO), PubMed and Science 
Direct databases, including the reference lists of 
relevant papers. Two independent reviewers extracted 
study characteristics and MSK and functional outcome 
measures. Study quality and reporting was assessed 
using the Tool for the assEssment of Study qualiTy and 
reporting in EXercise.
Eligibility Search results were limited to exercise 
training studies investigating BFR training in clinical MSK 
rehabilitation, published in a scientific peer-reviewed 
journal in English.
results Twenty studies were eligible, including ACL 
reconstruction (n=3), knee osteoarthritis (n=3), older 
adults at risk of sarcopenia (n=13) and patients with 
sporadic inclusion body myositis (n=1). Analysis of 
pooled data indicated low-load BFR training had 
a moderate effect on increasing strength (Hedges’ 
g=0.523, 95% CI 0.263 to 0.784, p<0.001), but was 
less effective than heavy-load training (Hedges’ g=0.674, 
95% CI 0.296 to 1.052, p<0.001).
conclusion Compared with low-load training, low-load 
BFR training is more effective, tolerable and therefore 
a potential clinical rehabilitation tool. There is a need 
for the development of an individualised approach to 
training prescription to minimise patient risk and increase 
effectiveness.
IntroDuctIon
Muscle weakness is highly prevalent among the 
most clinical musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions 
worldwide. The degenerative effects of muscle 
atrophy can be seen with both acute and chronic 
MSK injuries that result in prolonged treatment 
or muscle immobilisation, such as fractures and 
ligament injuries.1 Loss of strength is a major risk 
factor for osteoarthritis (OA),2 3 the most common 
MSK disease responsible for reduced function3 
and quality of life of sufferers,4 affecting around 
250 
million adults worldwide5 with a prevalence 
correlating with the increasing age of the popu-
lation.6 Muscle weakness is increasingly evident 
in non-injured healthy populations such as older 
adults due to sarcopenia. This describes a loss of 
physical function due to the decrease in muscle 
mass and strength,7 vascular function8 and bone 
mineral density9 that occur with ageing. Sarcopenia 
appears to be underpinned by the reduced sensi-
tivity of ageing muscle to anabolic stimuli such as 
resistance exercise.10 The consequences of progres-
sive and injury-related loss of muscle strength can 
be life changing. Strength training is indispensable 
in clinical MSK rehabilitation, and clinicians are 
faced with the task of turning the growing body of 
research into effective clinical practice. For instance, 
greater quadriceps strength has been linked to a 
lower risk of symptomatic knee OA11 and reduced 
joint space narrowing,12 as well as reduced pain and 
positive changes in physical function.13 Heavy-load 
resistance training has been advocated to offset 
age-related loss in muscle strength and mass,14 and 
strength training post-immobilisation is essential to 
regain the strength lost as a result of muscle disuse 
atrophy.
Historically, 
heavy 
exercise 
loads 
of 
approximately 
70% of an individual’s one repetition maximum 
(1RM) have been deemed necessary to elicit muscle 
hypertrophy and strength gains.15 Recent research 
has demonstrated that low-load training to failure 
can stimulate muscle hypertrophy comparable 
in magnitude to that observed with heavy-load 
training after 616 and 817 weeks of training three 
times per week. However, strength adaptations 
were maximised with heavy-load training,16 17 and 
cross-sectional comparisons would suggest that 
hypertrophy and strength gains observed with 
low-load training are not as great as those achieved 
with heavy-load training.18 Nevertheless, from a 
clinical MSK rehabilitation perspective, training to 
muscular failure may provide one strategy to maxi-
mise hypertrophy when training using low loads in 
situations when using heavy loads is not feasible. 
Training with low loads may therefore be useful, as 
the early addition of muscle mass and function in 
rehabilitation may be beneficial for individuals who 
have suffered from atrophy.
In recent years, research has demonstrated 
that augmentation of low-load resistance training 
with blood flow restriction (LL-BFR) to the active 
musculature can produce significant hypertrophy 
and strength gains,19–22 using loads as low as 30%

review
1RM.23 BFR training has been found to yield hypertrophy 
responses comparable to that observed with heavy-load resis-
tance training;24 however, studies with such findings regarding 
muscle hypertrophy are not common among the present liter-
ature. Physiological adaptations in leg strength25 and vascular26 
and pulmonary27 components have been reported with low-load 
aerobic exercise and BFR. From a mechanistic standpoint, it is 
hypothesised that an ischaemic and hypoxic muscular environ-
ment is generated during BFR to cause high levels of metabolic 
stress, alongside mechanical tension when BFR is used in tandem 
with exercise. Both metabolic stress and mechanical tension have 
been described as ‘primary hypertrophy factors’28 and theo-
rised to activate other mechanisms for the induction of muscle 
growth. These proposed mechanisms include: elevated systemic 
hormone production,29 30 cell swelling,31 production of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS),32 33 intramuscular anabolic/anticatabolic 
signalling34–36 and increased fast-twitch fibre recruitment.37–39 
However, at present these are mainly hypothetical and theo-
retical-based associations. Pragmatic and specific identification 
of these proposed mechanisms, including their magnitude of 
involvement and actual source of activation in BFR-induced 
hypertrophy is currently lacking and requires further exploration.
Nevertheless, these findings have important implications 
for individuals who cannot tolerate the mechanical stress of 
heavy-load exercise.40 LL-BFR strength training may be a clini-
cally relevant MSK rehabilitation tool as it does not require the 
high joint forces associated with heavy-load exercise. Interest 
in the use of BFR training as a clinical rehabilitation tool is 
mounting,26 41 42 given the practicality that this training mode 
may offer in a clinical setting. To date, the effectiveness of 
LL-BFR training in clinical MSK rehabilitation has not been 
examined. It also remains unclear whether emerging research 
is informed by evidenced-based guidelines of implementing 
this novel training method to ensure safety and validity of 
 
findings.43 44
The main aims of this review were to conduct a meta-analysis 
to examine the effectiveness of LL-BFR training in clinical MSK 
rehabilitation, and a systematic analysis to examine study quality 
and reporting with a focus on safe and effective application of 
BFR. Thus, the objectives of this review were to (1) compare the 
effectiveness of LL-BFR training to both low- and heavy-load 
training without BFR; (2) systematically review studies exam-
ining LL-BFR training in clinical MSK rehabilitation and (3) 
from the results of the systematic analysis, examine and provide 
recommendations regarding safe and effective implementation 
of BFR training in clinical musculoskeletal rehabilitation.
MEthoDs
search strategy
This review was registered on the Research Registry database 
(reviewregistry91) and composed according to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-anal-
yses (PRISMA) guidelines.45 A literature search to identify 
research papers examining BFR training in clinical MSK rehabil-
itation was carried out on the following databases for the time 
period of 1st January 1990 to 31st March 2016: SPORTDiscus 
(EBSCO), PubMed and Science Direct. The title and abstract of 
each study was screened; exercise training studies utilising BFR 
as a clinical MSK rehabilitation tool were selected. The refer-
ence list of relevant papers was also examined. The exact search 
terms were: ‘blood flow restriction’ OR ‘vascular occlusion’ 
OR ‘kaatsu’ AND ‘strength training’ OR ‘resistance training’ 
OR ‘exercise training’. This study received approval from the 
University’s ethics committee.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Exercise training studies involving individuals with a clinical 
MSK condition, published in English in a scientific peer-re-
viewed journal were included in the analysis. Studies were 
required to include BFR concurrently with exercise training. 
Only randomised controlled trials comparing LL-BFR training 
to either a low-load or high-load protocol without BFR were 
included in the meta-analysis. Any acute studies, case studies, 
single-arm studies or those not published in a scientific peer-re-
viewed journal in English were excluded from meta-analysis.
study selection and data extraction
Studies were initially screened independently by two reviewers 
(LH and SDP) and those failing to match the inclusion criteria 
and any duplicates were excluded. From the remaining eligible 
papers, data were recorded relating to (1) study design; (2) clin-
ical population characteristics; (3) rehabilitation protocol: type, 
frequency, occlusion characteristics, training load and duration 
of BFR training and (4) outcome measure: muscle strength and 
size, physical function and pain. Data regarding the safety of 
BFR implementation were obtained from the systematic analysis 
of the studies. Data were extracted using a custom spreadsheet 
composed by LH and SDP
. For the meta-analysis, two compari-
sons were made: (1) LL-BFR training versus a matched protocol 
without occlusion and (2) LL-BFR training versus heavy-load 
training. Due to limited data regarding muscle size and physical 
function, the focus of the meta-analysis was on muscle strength. 
Risk of bias (figure 1) was calculated according to the Cochrane 
Collaboration guidelines.46
Meta-analysis
Data analysis was performed by one author (LH) and reviewed 
by a statistician (CG). Data were extracted in the form of mean, 
SD and sample size for the meta-analysis. When insufficient 
raw data were provided, authors were contacted to provide 
raw data, or means and SDs were extrapolated from figures. 
Effect sizes were set at <0.40= 
small, 0.40–0.70=moderate 
and >0.70= 
large.47 All meta-analyses were conducted with 
the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software V
.2.2.064 (Biostat, 
Englewood, New Jersey, USA). Pooled data were analysed with 
a fixed-effect model to determine heterogeneity between studies 
using the I2 statistic, which determines the percentage of vari-
ability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity. Hedges’ g 
and 95% 
CI were used to calculate standardised mean differ-
ences for trials with sufficient data available. Significance level 
was set a priori p<0.05.
study quality and reporting
Individual studies were assessed using the ‘Tool for assessment 
of study quality and reporting in exercise’ (TESTEX).48 TESTEX 
is a 15-point assessment scale, consisting of five available points 
for study quality and 10 for study reporting. For study quality, 
a point is awarded for: (1) eligibility criteria specification; (2) 
randomisation specification; (3) group allocation concealment; 
(4) presentation of baseline characteristics with no group differ-
ences and (5) blinding of an assessor to at least one primary 
outcome measure. For study reporting, points are awarded for: 
(1) at least 85% patient adherence; (2) reporting of adverse 
events; (3) reporting of exercise attendance; (4) intention-to-
treat analysis; between-group statistical comparisons for a (5) 
primary and (6) secondary outcome measure; (7) use of point 
estimates; (8) control group activity is controlled and presented; 
(9) adjustment of exercise load and (10) if exercise volume and

energy expenditure can be calculated. Data concerning reporting 
of adverse events and adjustment of exercise load, along with 
occlusive pressures, were used to address aim three of exam-
ining the safety and effectiveness of BFR implementation. 
Higher scores reflect better study quality and reporting. Any 
 
discrepancies in scores between reviewers were resolved by a 
third party (CG).
rEsults
The database search yielded 1502 articles. After initial title and 
abstract screening, 171 were assessed for eligibility. Regarding 
clinical MSK conditions, a total of 30 articles were identified, 
including 20 exercise training studies, 6 exercise training case 
studies and 4 acute studies. From this selection, 20 and 13 
studies were included in the final systematic and meta-analyses, 
respectively (figure 2). An overview of the studies is summarised 
in table 1. The main findings from the risk of bias assessment 
was that the majority of studies could not blind participants or 
conceal group allocation, and sequence generation was largely 
unclear (figure 1).
Meta-analysis
Eight studies meeting the inclusion criteria and comparing 
LL-BFR training to the same training without BFR had data 
extracted for meta-analysis. LL-BFR training had a moderate 
effect on increasing muscle strength in individuals suffering MSK 
weakness (Hedges’ g=0.523, 95% 
CI 0.263 to 0.784, p<0.001; 
figure 3). The I2 statistic of 49.8% represented moderate 
heterogeneity in the results. Five studies had data extracted for 
meta-analysis comparing LL-BFR training to heavy-load training. 
Heavy-load training had a moderate effect on increasing muscle 
strength compared with LL-BFR training (Hedges’ g=0.674, 
95% 
CI 0.296 to 1.052, p<0.001; figure 4). The I2 statistic 
revealed minimal heterogeneity in the results (0%).
clinical populations and bFr training interventions
Studies involved individuals with knee OA41 49 50 (n=3), ligament 
injuries42 51 52 (n=3), sporadic inclusion body myositis53 (n=1) 
and older adults susceptible to sarcopenia26 27 54–64 (n=13). The 
average age was 58±14 years for a sample range of 10–41 partic-
ipants. BFR was used in combination with low-load resistance 
training,41 49 50 53 55 57 59 63 64 elastic band resistance training60 61 
and low-moderate intensity walk training.26 27 56 58 62 BFR training 
was also used in conjunction with body weight exercises42 52 54 
and individually without any exercise.51 BFR exercise training 
load ranged from 10% to 30% 1RM for resistance exercise, and 
45% of heart rate reserve to 67 
m/min−1 for aerobic and walking 
exercise. BFR was achieved using either pneumatic cuffs, hand-
pumped blood pressure cuffs or elastic wraps ranging from 3 to 
18 
cm in width. Occlusive pressure across studies ranged from 
60 to 270 
mmHg. Studies either selected a pressure based on 
previous research, on total limb occlusive pressure or on systolic 
blood pressure. The duration of the BFR training intervention 
ranged from 2 to 16 weeks, with a frequency of 2 to 6 training 
sessions per week. Some studies did repeated sessions on the 
same day when BFR was used in isolation51 and in combination 
with simple muscle exercises.52

Median values regarding criteria matching were 2 (1–5) for 
study quality and 5 (3–7) for study reporting. Overall, studies 
had a median score of 7 out of the 15 possible points (range

DIscussIon
Meta-analysis
There is a growing interest in the use of LL-BFR training as 
a clinical MSK rehabilitation tool; however, the effectiveness 
of this novel training modality in clinical MSK rehabilitation 
has not been examined. Therefore, this review has provided 
insight into its effectiveness as a clinical rehabilitation tool 
for muscular weakness. The results indicate that augmenta-
tion of low-load rehabilitative training with BFR can produce 
greater responses in muscular strength compared with 
low-load training alone. At present, the strength gains appear 
to be smaller in magnitude to those achieved with heavy-load 
training. However, LL-BFR training is a more effective alterna-
tive to low-load training alone and may act as a surrogate for 
heavy-load training. Thus, LL-BFR training may be used as a 
progressive clinical rehabilitation tool in the process of return 
to heavy-load exercise.
The total Hedge’s g of 0.52 indicates that with the addition 
of BFR to low-load training, 69% of the population will expe-
rience greater gains in muscular strength.65 Mechanical tension 
would likely be similar between these modalities, and at present 
there is no literature to identify a clear mechanism to explain 
how LL-BFR training stimulates greater increases in strength 
compared with low-load training in clinical populations.41 It may

likely be driven by hypertrophy and neural adaptations similar 
to those observed with heavy-load training, and the underlying 
mechanisms are also likely similar. However, with BFR exercise, 
these mechanisms may be activated by the combination of tension 
and hypoxia. It is important to note that this review indicated 
the strength gains observed with LL-BFR training were smaller 
in magnitude than those observed with heavy-load training. The 
total Hedge’s g of 0.67 suggests that in the comparison of these 
two training modalities, 76% of the population will experience 
greater gains in strength with heavy-load training;65 this is in line 
with previous research.36 62
Although there was insufficient data to examine an effect 
size for muscle size in the meta-analysis, individual studies have 
demonstrated greater muscle volume26 and CSA in both lower26 
27 42 and upper limbs61 alongside strength increases following 
LL-BFR training. This reflects findings in the literature involving 
healthy and athletic cohorts, where LL-BFR training has been 
shown to elicit greater increases in muscle size compared with 
low-load training alone.20 21 23 24 Furthermore, studies comparing 
LL-BFR training to heavy-load training in individuals with clin-
ical MSK weakness reported similar increases in muscle CSA,60 
62 63 which is in agreement with previous research.40 A number 
of factors have been propounded to have a potential role; again, 
however, no clear mechanism for BFR-induced hypertrophy is 
known. There appears to be a similarity between LL-BFR and 
heavy-load exercise in terms of molecular factors that lead to 
muscle growth. Therefore, the hypertrophy pathway may be 
similar between these two exercise modalities but possibly in 
response to different triggers due to, in large part, the character-
istics of the exercise.
systematic analysis
Results of the systematic TESTEX analysis of all exercise 
training studies examining BFR in clinical MSK rehabilitation 
demonstrated that a large majority of studies do not report on 
any or no adverse events to BFR,26 27 42 50 52 56 58 60–62 and many 
are not adjusting and individualising the occlusive stimulus and 
training load.26 27 41 49 54 56 58 61 64 Examination of extracted data 
regarding MSK and functional outcome measures revealed that 
LL-BFR training is effective at improving physiological aspects 
aside from muscle strength26 27 35 55 57 64 66 and may even be used 
without exercise to prevent muscle atrophy in early immobilisa-
tion.51 Furthermore, addition of BFR to low-load training does 
not appear to worsen condition or exercise-related pain;41 49 
however, at present, there is a lack of investigation as to how 
muscular adaptations impact on an individual’s physical function.

and correct implementation has been affirmed to present no 
greater risk than traditional exercise modes.71 An epidemio-
logical study in Japan reported low occurrence of any of the 
above adverse effects other than skin bruising.72 At present, 
there are no complete standardised recommendations for use 
even in healthy populations. Recently, cases of rhabdomyo-
losis have emerged73 74 despite a reported incidence of 0.008% 
in the aforementioned study. Most recently, this was reported 
in an obese Japanese male  after only three sets of 20 reps of 
BFR exercise;74 however, no information regarding the exercise 
load or occlusive pressure was available, and the individual had 
been sedentary for a number of years. It is more likely that the 
cause was the stress of unaccustomed exercise on a sedentary 
body or the inappropriate use of BFR. However, another study 
by Iverson et al73 reported rhabdomyolosis in a 31-year-old ice 
hockey player after one session of low-load BFR exercise.
This review illustrates that the majority of studies do not 
report on the presence or absence of adverse events. Although 
injury resulting from this type of training seems rare,44 the 
risks of adverse events may be exacerbated in clinical popula-
tions. Although muscle damage is common in BFR exercise75 
and is necessary for training effects/adaptations, the possible 
risks of rhabdomyolosis occurring during BFR exercise may be

heightened in cases of muscular disuse atrophy. It is important 
that practitioners rule out potential causes of rhabdomyolosis, 
such as infections and prolonged immobilisation76 before imple-
menting training, and include measures of muscle damage 
markers (eg, serum creatine kinase) throughout the training 
period. This also emphasises the need for an individualised 
approach to BFR training when selecting cuff pressure for both 
safety and effectiveness.
Effective implementation of BFR training
Despite evidence of the effectiveness and tolerability of LL-BFR 
training in a clinical setting, various issues must be considered 
during implementation. Within the current literature, there is a lack 
of individualised prescription of BFR training. First, the occlusive 
pressure used is one aspect that should be individualised in the 
pursuit of safe and effective application. Research in healthy indi-
viduals has identified thigh circumference as an important predictor 
of occlusion pressure,43 with larger limbs requiring a higher 
pressure to reach the same level of occlusion as smaller limbs.77 
Therefore, set pressures across a whole clinical cohort may not 
restrict blood flow to the same extent in all individuals. This may 
result in adverse cardiovascular outcomes,78 particularly if selected 
pressures result in complete arterial occlusion. It may also influence 
the effectiveness of the BFR stimulus, partially explaining discrep-
ancies in study findings. For instance, the same LL-BFR protocol 
used in OA women by Segal et al41 did not augment any increases 
in strength observed in the low-load exercise group in the same 
study in men.49 Men tend to have greater thigh circumference than 
women; therefore, it is conceivable that the same BFR pressure 
provided an insufficient hypertrophic stimulus in the male study.
A recent technique has emerged whereby calculation of total 
arterial limb occlusive pressure (LOP) allows for selection 
of a pressure at a percentage of LOP to standardise the level 
of occlusion across cohorts. This is used by the Association of 
Perioperative Registered Nurses to calculate required tourni-
quet pressures to restrict blood flow during surgery to minimise 
the risk of adverse events.79 LOP-based cuff pressures are lower 
than commonly used pressures but produce an effective surgical 
environment.80 Recent research employing this technique 
during BFR exercise demonstrated that higher LOP pressures 
are not required for greater facilitation of muscular responses 
to exercise compared with lower pressures.22 Furthermore, 40% 
LOP produced similar increases in muscle size, strength and 
endurance after 8 weeks of training to that of 90% LOP but 
without the high ratings of discomfort that were reported with 
the latter pressure.81 Lower and more tolerable pressures may 
elicit sufficient MSK adaptations while minimising the risk of 
adverse events and pain, highlighting the need for individualised 
prescription of clinical BFR training.
Individualisation of training prescription tools must also be 
considered, as this may effect progression and timescale of MSK 
adaptations. Although pronounced hypertrophy and strength 
gains have been reported after 4 weeks,23 2 weeks21 and even 
only 6 days82 of LL-BFR training, conflicting research demon-
strated that BFR did not accelerate strength adaptations following 
4 weeks of low-load training,49 suggesting longer training 
durations may be necessary.24 Progression of training load by 
re-evaluation of training prescription tools such as the 1RM is 
necessary for continued MSK adaptations to occur. A lack of this 
may compound the effects of the training stimulus and partially 
explain any insufficient MSK adaptations observed in longer dura-
tion training. The TESTEX analysis in this review revealed a lack 
of training progression in almost half of the studies, which may 
partially explain discrepancies in findings of MSK outcomes.41 49
A recent review advocated that for clinical populations, two 
to three LL-BFR training sessions per week with progressive 
overload is sufficient for enhanced strength adaptations.44 A 
previous meta-analysis of healthy cohorts demonstrated that this 
training frequency maximised adaptations to LL-BFR training.24 
Progression of training may be difficult in certain clinical 
contexts, particularly post-surgery and during immobilisation. A 
progression model for using BFR in early rehabilitation through 
to high-load resistance training has been proposed by Loenneke 
et al,83 which encompasses a four-step approach: (1) BFR alone 
during periods of bed rest; (2) BFR combined with low-workload 
walking exercise; (3) BFR combined with low-load resistance 
exercise and (4) LL-BFR training in combination with high-load 
exercise. Considering evidence from this review, a progressive 
model of BFR training may provide an effective rehabilitation 
tool from early ambulation to return to heavy-load exercise.
Other physiological adaptations to BFR training
Findings from the systematic review of all exercise training 
studies utilising LL-BFR training in clinical MSK rehabilita-
tion identifies adaptations aside from muscle strength. In older 
adults who are increasingly susceptible to sarcopenia, LL-BFR 
training was shown to stimulate mTORC1 signalling and muscle 
protein synthesis in older men.35 Research has demonstrated 
increased serum concentrations of bone alkaline phosphatase66 
and increased bone turnover following 6 weeks of LL-BFR 
training, suggesting an impact on bone health. Low-load walk 
training with BFR has been demonstrated to increase knee 
extensor and flexor torque,55 carotid arterial compliance,26 
peak oxygen uptake,27 peak post-occlusive blood flow57 and 
vascular endothelial function and peripheral nerve circulation64 
in older individuals. LL-BFR training can attenuate the effects 
of sarcopenia and may be effective at improving bone health. 
It may also be applicable for other clinical populations who 
suffer from MSK weakness and bone degradation (eg, patients 
with osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma and 
lymphoma). In premature situations when individuals suffering 
from muscle weakness are not able to begin even low-load 
exercise (eg, postoperative immobilisation), BFR alone can 
be used as an early rehabilitation intervention. Research has 
demonstrated effective attenuation of muscle atrophy51 and 
muscle strength84 using an occlusion protocol even at a low 
pressure of 50 mmHg,85 suggesting that BFR per se is effective 
at minimising atrophy. As high pressures can sometimes cause 
an uncomfortable dull ache,86 the notion of utilising lower 
pressures is clinically relevant. A definitive mechanism behind 
such adaptations to BFR per se, despite the absence of mechan-
ical tension, has not been identified as yet. However, muscular 
responses to ischaemia and hypoxia induced by BFR such as 
increased ROS production,87 cell swelling31 and other intra-
muscular metabolic changes28 may play a role in promoting 
tissue growth in these situations.
An interesting observation in this systematic review is that 
the addition of BFR to low-load strength training does not 
appear to worsen condition or exercise-related pain. In women 
present with symptomatic factors of knee OA, Segal et al41 
found that the greater muscle strength increases observed after 
4 weeks of LL-BFR (30% 1 RM) resistance training did not 
exacerbate knee pain throughout training, assessed using the 
Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score tool. The same 
study in men49 also found that BFR did not worsen knee pain. 
Research has shown that perceived exertion is higher during 
acute LL-BFR exercise compared with low-load exercise 
without BFR (both 30% 1RM).88 This was also demonstrated

in a study involving older adults,89 alongside higher reported 
values for ratings of perceived pain during BFR exercise. 
However, such reported values for perceived exertion and 
pain are not necessarily high, and comparison of perceptual 
responses to LL-BFR (30% 1RM) versus heavy load (70% 
1RM) exercise demonstrates that these responses are lower 
in LL-BFR compared with an equivalent form of exercise at 
a higher intensity.90 In addition, research has demonstrated 
a similar time course of adaptation to perceptual responses 
between LL-BFR and heavy-load exercise.91
This was recently reflected in clinical research when 
comparing this novel training modality to heavy-load training 
in patients with OA.50 The authors actually observed less knee 
pain during exercise across the training period in the LL-BFR 
group, likely attributable to the lower exercise load, alongside 
similar increases in muscle size and strength to the heavy-load 
group. Considering this and the findings from Hollander et al,90 
individuals may be able to tolerate perceptual changes during 
LL-BFR to a better extent due to lower joint forces and stress. 
In addition, such research advocates that LL-BFR training may 
potentially be comparable in effectiveness but more tolerable as 
a MSK rehabilitation tool compared with heavy-load exercise; 
however, the current research base for this is limited.
In clinical MSK rehabilitation, much emphasis is placed on 
an individual’s physical function and their quality of life. In this 
systematic review, it was evident that the majority of current 
research does not examine how MSK adaptations to BFR training 
transfer to these aspects. The few studies examining this demon-
strated alleviation of condition-related pain41 50 and changes in 
various tests of functional ability.26 47 50 However, more inves-
tigation is needed to determine how MSK adaptations to BFR 
training are linked to changes in physical function and recovery 
of different clinical conditions.
conclusIon AnD rEcoMMEnDAtIons
Strength training is important for many clinical populations 
during MSK rehabilitation. The clinical relevance of this review 
is the demonstration that LL-BFR training can provide a more 
effective approach to low-load and more tolerable approach 
to heavy-load rehabilitation. Individualised LL-BFR training 
prescription may provide a comparable surrogate for heavy-load 
training while minimising pain during training.41 50 51 92 This 
review has discussed some parameters of BFR training necessary 
to facilitate safe and optimal implementation, allowing clinical 
practitioners to make more informed decisions on the applica-
tion of LL-BFR training as a clinical rehabilitation tool. BFR may 
facilitate early engagement in low-load strength training with 
limited joint stress in a broad range of clinical populations; there-
fore, it’s use in clinical rehabilitation warrants further study. As 
discussed in this review, future research should adopt an individ-
ualised and progressive approach to facilitate the effectiveness 
and safety of BFR training. And finally, future research must 
focus on identifying how various training adaptations impact 
physical function and quality of life during rehabilitation.

What is already known on this topic?
A number of meta-analyses have demonstrated that low-load 
blood flow restriction (BFR) training can elicit substantial muscular 
hypertrophy and strength gains in healthy and athletic populations. 
The low-load nature of BFR training marks its potential as a clinical 
rehabilitation tool; however, the effectiveness of BFR training as 
such a tool has not been systematically examined.
What are the findings?
This study synthesises the available literature examining low-load 
BFR training in clinical populations, demonstrating its effectiveness 
in attenuating strength loss and facilitating strength rehabilitation 
in clinical populations suffering from musculoskeletal (MSK) 
weakness. Furthermore, low-load BFR training can have a 
positive impact on muscle size and numerous other physiological 
adaptations, and may act as a surrogate for heavy-load strength 
rehabilitation training in a broad range of clinical populations. 
Finally, this study provides recommendations regarding: 
developing a more effective individualised approach to BFR 
training, safe application of BFR training in a clinical setting and 
potential clinical conditions where BFR training may be beneficial.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the near future?
 
► This manuscript has discussed issues surrounding BFR 
and provided recommendations regarding the safe and 
effective implementation of BFR training in clinical MSK 
rehabilitation.
 
► This paper may inform clinical practitioners of the many 
benefits of low-load BFR training and it’s use as a clinical 
MSK rehabilitation tool. BFR training is an emerging ‘hot 
topic’ in the UK and all around the world at present—this 
manuscript provides the first evidence base and guidelines 
within clinical MSK rehabilitation in the National Health 
Service and private healthcare setting.
