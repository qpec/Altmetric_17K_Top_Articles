ABSTRACT
The association between proton pump inhibitors (PPI) use and risk of acute interstitial nephritis has been
described. However, whether exposure to PPI associates with incident CKD, CKD progression, or ESRD is
not known. We used Department of Veterans Affairs national databases to build a primary cohort of new
users of PPI (n=173,321) and new users of histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2 blockers; n=20,270) and
followed these patients over 5 years to ascertain renal outcomes. In adjusted Cox survival models, the PPI
group, compared with the H2 blockers group, had an increased risk of incident eGFR,60 ml/min per
1.73 m2 and of incident CKD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.18 to 1.26;
and HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.34, respectively). Patients treated with PPI also had a significantly elevated
risk of doubling of serum creatinine level (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.42 to 1.65), of eGFR decline .30% (HR, 1.32;
95% CI, 1.28 to 1.37), and of ESRD (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.18). Furthermore, we detected a graded
association between duration of PPI exposure and risk of renal outcomes among those exposed to PPI for
31–90, 91–180, 181–360, and 361–720 days compared with those exposed for #30 days. Examination of
risk of renal outcomes in 1:1 propensity score-matched cohorts of patients taking H2 blockers versus
patients taking PPI and patients taking PPI versus controls yielded consistent results. Our results suggest
that PPI exposure associates with increased risk of incident CKD, CKD progression, and ESRD.

Numerous prior observations have suggested a re-
lationship between exposure to proton pump in-
hibitors (PPI) and acute kidney injury and acute
interstitial nephritis. Antoniou et al. conducted a
population-based study involving Ontario resi-
dents aged 66 years and older who initiated PPI
therapy and found an increased risk of both acute
kidney injury and acute interstitial nephritis.1
Klepser et al. built a nested case-control study
using claims data from a private insurer in a single
Midwestern state and also found a significant asso-
ciation between PPI use and acute kidney injury.2
Blank et al. conducted a nested case-control study
using routinely collected national health and drug
dispensing data in New Zealand and found that
current use of PPI was associated with increased
risk of acute interstitial nephritis relative to past
use.3 Data from adverse event reporting systems sug-
gest that PPI is a common cause of drug-induced
acute interstitial nephritis.4 While most patients
recover kidney function, some may not fully recover
and might develop CKD and progress to ESRD.5,6
While the association between PPI exposure and
acute kidney disease has been well documented, it is
unclear whether exposure to PPI is associated with

 an increased risk of incident CKD and progression to ESRD.4,7
In this report, we used national United States Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) databases to build a primary cohort of
new users of PPI and new users of Histamine H2-receptor
antagonists (H2 blockers), and additional cohorts for sensi-
tivity analyses, including a 1:1 propensity score-matched
cohort of PPI and H2 blockers, a 1:1 propensity score-
matched cohort of PPI, and a control group, and examined
the association between PPI exposure and risk of incident
CKD, CKD progression, and ESRD among United States
veterans without kidney disease at baseline (baseline
eGFR.60 ml/min per 1.73 m2).
RESULTS
There were 20,270 and 173,321 participants in the H2 blockers,
and PPI groups, respectively (Figure 1). The demographic
and health characteristics of the two groups are described
in Table 1.
Association between PPI and Risk of eGFR<60 ml/min
per 1.73 m2, and Risk of CKD
The incident rate for eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was
5408.24 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 5248.96 to
5567.52) and 7241.27 (95% CI, 7176.61 to 7305.93) per
100,000 person-years for H2 blockers and PPI groups, respec-
tively (Table 2). Unadjusted Cox survival model results are
provided in Supplemental Table 1. In Cox survival models
adjusted for demographic, eGFR, clinical comorbid condi-
tions, and other health characteristics, we evaluated the risk
of incident eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2; compared with
users of H2 blockers, the PPI group showed an increased
risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.26) (Table 2).
The incident rate for CKD (defined as two measurements of
eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at least 90 days apart) was
2569.86 (2463.30, 2676.43) and 3683.12 (95% CI, 3638.52
to 3727.72) per 100,000 person-years for H2 blockers and
PPI groups, respectively (Table 2). Adjusted survival models
showed that the risk of CKD was increased in those exposed to
PPI (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.34). The attributable risk for
incident eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and incident CKD was
1.83% and 1.11%, respectively, and number needed to harm
was 55 and 90, respectively.
Association between PPI and Risk of Kidney Disease
Progression and ESRD
The incident rate of doubling of serum creatinine was 816.98
(758.86,875.10)and 1387.02(95% CI, 1360.81 to 1413.22) per
100,000 person-years for H2 blockers and PPI groups, respec-
tively. The incident rate for .30% decline in eGFR was
4533.25 (4391.86, 4674.64) and 6170.27 (95% CI, 6112.51
to 6228.03) per 100,000 person-years, respectively (Table 3).
In adjusted survival models, risk of doubling of serum creat-
inine and eGFR decline .30% was significantly elevated in
those treated with PPI (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.42 to 1.65; and
HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.37, respectively) (Table 3). The
attributable risk for doubling of serum creatinine and .30%
decline in eGFR was 0.57% and 1.63%, respectively, and
number needed to harm was 175 and 61, respectively.
Incident rate for the outcome of ESRD was significantly
higher among those treated with PPI compared with H2
blockers (41.25 [95% CI, 36.79 to 45.70] and 26.50 [95%
CI, 16.11 to 36.88] per 100,000 person-years, respectively).
In adjusted survival models, the risk of
ESRD was significantly increased in the
PPI group (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.21 to
3.18) (Table 3). Risk of ESRD, or .50%
decline in eGFR was elevated in patients
treated with PPI (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.38
to 1.57) (Table 3). The attributable risk for
ESRD and composite outcome of ESRD or
.50% decline in eGFR was 0.01% and
0.66%, respectively, and number needed
to harm was 6780 and 153, respectively.
Duration of PPI Use and Risk of Renal
Outcomes
We evaluated the association between
duration of exposure and risk of renal
outcomes among new users of PPI
(n=173,321). Compared with those ex-
posed for #30 days, there was a graded as-
sociation between duration of exposure
and risk of renal outcomes among those
exposed for 31–90, 91–180, 181–360,
and 361–720 days (Figure 2, Table 4).

 The association seems to diminish with exposure exceeding
720 days.
Sensitivity Analyses
We examined the risk of renal outcomes in a 1:1 propensity
score-matched cohort of new users of PPI (n=20,270) and
new users of H2 blockers (n=20,270). The flowchart for the
cohort design is provided in Supplemental Figure 1; Sup-
plemental Table 2 provides description of demographics
and health characteristics. The standardized difference for
age, race, sex distribution, clinical comorbid conditions,
and heath characteristics was ,0.1, indicating balance
between the two groups (Supplemental Table 2). Exami-
nation of the association of PPI use and renal outcomes
yielded results consistent with those shown in the primary
analysis (Table 5).
We also examined the risk of renal outcomes in a 1:1
propensitymatchedcohortofnewPPIusers(n=173,321)anda
control group (n=173,321) (see Concise Methods) (Supple-
mental Figure 2, Supplemental Table 3); the cohort was well
balanced. Compared with the control group, patients treated
with PPI exhibited an increased risk of renal outcomes,
and results were consistent with those shown in the primary
analyses (Table 6).
Asatestofcalibration,weevaluatedtheassociationbetween
PPI exposure and the outcome of AKI. The intent of this
analysis was to examine the presence of an association where a
priori observations suggest that an association is expected.1–3
The results suggest that patients in the PPI group have an
increased risk of AKI (HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 2.00 to 2.32). To
examine whether the association of PPI exposure and risk
of chronic renal outcomes is mediated by occurrence of
AKI, we controlled for AKI occurrence during exposure to
acid-suppression therapy. The results suggest that associa-
tions remain significant (Table 7).
We evaluated the association of PPI exposure and risk of
renal events in a number of additional sensitivity analyses
where we: (1) included the number of eGFR measurements for
each patient as a covariate (Supplemental Table 4), (2) included
use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), defined
as exposure to NSAIDs for 30 days or more before (Supplemental
Table 5A) and during time in cohort (Supplemental Table 5B) as a
covariate, (3) included baseline microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio
as a covariate in a subcohort of patients where data were avail-
able (n=29,059) (Supplemental Table 6), (4) included
serum bicarbonate as a covariate (n=174,322) (Supplemental
Table 7) and (5) included the angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB),

results remained consistent in all sensitivity analyses.
DISCUSSION
This study leverages the availability of a national comprehen-
sive database in an integrated network of health systems to
examine the association between PPI exposure and long-term
renal outcomes. Among users of acid-suppression therapy, H2
blockers and PPI—2 classes of drugs generally prescribed for
similar indications—we have shown that exposure to PPI
is associated with increased risk of development of CKD, pro-
gression of kidney disease, and risk of ESRD. The results also
suggest a graded relationship between duration of exposure
and risk of renal outcomes. The results were consistent in
multiple sensitivity analyses, including an assessment of risk
in a 1:1 propensity score-matched and balanced cohort of H2
blocker and PPI users where risk of renal outcomes was sig-
nificantly elevated in patients treated with PPI compared
with those treated with H2 blockers, and a 1:1 propensity
score-matched and balanced cohort of PPI users and controls
where risk of renal outcomes was significantly increased in
PPI users.
The results of our study further expand on the findings of a
recently reported observational cohort study by Lazarus et al.8
The investigators followed 10,482 participants in the Athero-
sclerosis Risk in Communities Study and assessed the associ-
ation between self-reported PPI use and the risk of incident
CKD defined by diagnostic codes that indicated CKD at
hospital discharge or death or by incident ESRD as determined
through linkage with United States Renal Database System. In
adjusted analyses, they found that participants who used PPIs
at baseline had a significantly increased risk of incident CKD
compared with nonusers. Similar associations were seen in
the Geisinger Health System replication cohort of 248,751
participants, where incident CKD was defined as sustained
eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or development of ESRD. In
addition, twice-daily PPI dosing was shown to be associated
with a higher risk of CKD than once-daily dosing. The study
by Lazarus et al., and this study, reached remarkably similar
conclusions using comparable study designs but in unrelated,
population-based cohorts. Our study adopted a new user
design, on the basis of pharmacy records, where the primary

 outcomes for incident CKD and CKD progression were de-
fined using actual laboratory parameters (not ICD-9 codes).
In addition to reporting an association between PPI and the
risk of incident CKD, our results demonstrate that PPI use is
also associated with an increased risk of CKD progression
(doubling of serum creatinine, eGFR decline .30%) and
ESRD; furthermore, we show a graded association between
duration of exposure and risk of renal outcomes. The constel-
lation of findings in our study lends further validity to the
observations reported by Lazarus et al., further elucidates
our understanding of the expanding spectrum of renal adverse
events associated with PPI use, and suggests the need to
exercise judicious use of PPI, limit exposure to the minimum
dose necessary, and for close monitoring of renal function
during PPI use.9
PPI are widely used and generally perceived as safe; they are
often overprescribed, started inappropriately during a hospital
stay, and their use extended for long-term duration without
appropriate medical indication.10–12 Strid et al. examined
the use of acid-suppressant drugs in patients with CKD and
concluded that acid-suppression therapy is often prescribed
without adequate indication, where PPI were the most
common drug class used for acid suppression.13 Because of
the wide use of PPI, the findings in this study may have public
health relevance, in that, while seemingly benign, PPI use may
be significantly associated with an increased risk of serious
renal outcomes. We also note that, while the associations
are significant, the incident rate of CKD, doubling of serum
creatinine, eGFR decline .30%, and ESRD is relatively in-
frequent; therefore, while pharmacovigilance about safety of
any approved therapeutic is a meritorious approach, the
findings should not deter from prescription and use of PPI
where medically indicated.
Recent examples that are relevant to PPI exposure and
adverse outcomes include reports on risk of hypomagnesemia
associated with PPIuse among those admitted to intensive care
units and in a population-based cohort
study.14,15 It is notable that the risk of hy-
pomagnesemia in PPI users was not ob-
served in clinical trials and postmarketing
studies. Randomized controlled trials are
often undertaken in an idealized setting,
are generally underpowered, and do not
cover a sufficiently prolonged span of
time to detect untoward events that
may be rare and/or require a long time
course for disease progression to manifest.
The Food and Drug Administration
postmarketing safety surveillance systems
for drug and therapeutic biologic products
are passive and rely on data obtained
from manufacturers or through voluntary
physician and consumer reporting.16 The
systems may not capture long-term unto-
ward outcomes.16 The newly established
Sentinel Initiative aims to leverage the increasing availability
of ‘Big Data’ and significant advances in analytics to proactively
and systematically detect adverse signals associated with pre-
scription medications and to uncover latent adverse events
that are relatively rare and would not otherwise be observed
in randomized clinical trials, postmarketing studies, or be
captured through the passive surveillance mechanisms.16–18
The Sentinel Initiative, however, is informed (and often
prompted) by observations (or signals) from clinical litera-
ture. Our results may help facilitate further discussion on PPI
exposure and the risk of renal outcomes and, more broadly,
on the role the scientific community could play in compre-
hensively fulfilling the promise of the Sentinel Initiative to
protect and promote public health.17,19,20
The mechanism(s) underpinning the observed associations
are not clear; several studies have suggested an association
between PPI exposure and acute interstitial nephritis.1,3,4,6
PPI-induced acute interstitial nephritis is thought to be a
cell-mediated immune response that maybe idiosyncratic,
and likely represents a class effect and does not seem dose-
dependent.4,21 It has been reported that 30–70% of patients
with acute interstitial nephritis did not fully recover
renal function, likely due to rapid development of interstitial
fibrosis shortly after onset of the acute inflammatory process,
especially in the setting of delayed diagnosis or treatment.4,5
This incomplete recovery of renal function, possibly along
with chronic interstitial nephritis, leads to CKD and poten-
tially CKD progression and ESRD.6,22 The relationship be-
tween AKI and subsequent development of CKD is supported
by multiple observations, suggesting an important and grow-
ing role of AKI in the global epidemiology of CKD and
ESRD and a bidirectional nexus between AKI and CKD
and progression to ESRD.23–25 In our analyses, we observed
that the association of PPI and renal outcomes remained
significant even after controlling for AKI, suggesting that the
described associations may be independent of clinically

 detectable AKI episodes and may be either the result of
subclinical or unrecognized AKI or chronic indolent, but
progressive, renal injury. PPI use may also cause severe
hypomagnesemia,14,15 which is associated with faster
eGFR decline in CKD patients and in patients with type
2 diabetes mellitus,26–28 progression to ESRD in diabetic
nephropathy,29 decreased renal allograft survival,30 and,
more recently, incident CKD.31 While our study did not
examine this mechanistic link, it is hypothetically plausible
that hypomagnesemia may mediate or partially explain the
observed associations in this report.31
The results show a graded association between duration of
exposure and risk of renal outcomes; however, the association
seems to weaken in those exposed for more than 720 days,
which is most likely a reflection of a survivorship bias—a
phenomenon commonly referred to in pharmacoepidemiology
as “depletion of susceptibles,” i.e., those remaining in the cohort
are likely resistant to the effect of PPI on renal outcomes.32–34 In
this study, we examined the risk of renal outcomes in a
cohort design of new users of PPI and H2 blockers, a category
of therapeutics (acid-suppression therapy) generally prescribed
for similar medical indications which may reduce confounding
by indication bias; we built multivariate Cox survival models
adjusting for known confounders. While our study is sufficiently
large, and the outcome is not particularly rare, we further tested
the sensitivity of the results to changes in cohort design
(and specification of statistical models) where associations
were examined in two propensity score-matched and balanced
cohorts (H2 blockers versus PPI, and PPI versus control).35 The
results obtained using propensity score analyses were similar
to those obtained using multivariate Cox regression analyses
(i.e., were robust to changes in epidemiologic design), consistent
with observations by Strümer et al. that, in most large studies,
propensity score analyses do not yield substantially different
risk estimates from conventional multivariate methods.36
Winklemeyer and Kurth note a limitation of both approaches,
in that they cannot account for unmeasured and unknown
confounders and suggest that traditional multivariate re-
gression adjustment is preferable in pharmacoepidemiology
studies when the sample size is sufficiently large and the
outcome is not rare.37
Our study has a number of limitations. The cohort
included mostly older white male United States’ veterans,
thus the results may not be generalizable to less narrowly
defined populations. The imperfect nature of administrative
data and the retrospective design of the study may also lead to
sampling bias and inaccurate measurements of the predictor
variables. In order to minimize such measurement bias, we
used definitions of comorbid illnesses that are validated for
use in VA administrative data.38 In our analyses, we consid-
ered drug exposure as PPI prescription; since PPI is available
over the counter in the United States, it is possible that some
patients in this cohort may have obtained and used PPI with-
out prescription. However, owing to financial consider-
ations, this is not highly likely, and if it occurred in some

 patients, it will have biased the results against the primary
hypothesis and resulted in underestimation of risk. While
we report attributable risk to PPI use and number needed to
harm, these numbers should not be extrapolated or other-
wise generalized to other cohorts or the general population.
The study has a number of strengths, including the use of
national large-scale data from a network of integrated health
systems which was captured during routine medical
care which minimizes selection bias. We evaluated multiple
outcomes in the continuum of CKD evolution, including
development of CKD, progression of CKD, and the definite
and terminal renal outcome of ESRD. We have taken

 considerable care to test the robustness of the associa-
tions in different cohort designs and numerous models in
sensitivity analyses.
CONCISE METHODS
Patients
Cohort for primary analyses
Using administrative data from the United States Department of
Veterans Affairs, we identified users of the VA healthcare system
who had no PPI prescription between October 1, 1999
and September 30, 2006. Patients were then further selected into
PPI-treatment and H2-blockers groups. The PPI-treatment
group selected patients who had at least one PPI prescription be-
tween October 1, 2006 and September 30, 2008. Patients in the PPI-
treatment group were further restricted to those with a baseline
eGFR.60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 within 90 days before their first PPI
prescription and at least one other eGFR measurement after their
first PPI prescription (n=173,321). The H2-blockers group in-
cluded those who did not have a PPI prescription from October
1, 1999 until the end of follow-up on September 30, 2013, and
had no H2 blocker prescription between October 1, 1999 and
September 30, 2006. The H2-blocker group was restricted to those
with a new prescription of H2 blockers between October 1, 2006
and September 30, 2008. They were also restricted to those with a
baseline eGFR.60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 within 90 days before the
first H2 blocker prescription and at least one other eGFR measure-
ment after their first H2 blocker prescription (n=20,270) (Figure
1). Patients in cohort were followed for 5 years from their baseline
eGFR measurement or until death. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the VA Saint Louis Health Care
System, Saint Louis, MO.
Data Sources
We used Department of Veterans Affairs databases including inpatient
andoutpatientmedicalSASdatasets(thatincludeutilizationdatarelated
to all inpatient and outpatient encounters within the VA system) to
ascertain detailed patient demographic characteristics and comorbidity
information based on Current Procedural Terminology codes, and
ICD-9-CM diagnostic and procedure codes associated with inpatient
and outpatient encounters.39–42 The VA Managerial Cost Accounting
System Laboratory Results (a comprehensive database that includes
VA-wide results for selected laboratory tests obtained in the clinical
setting) provided information on outpatient and inpatient laboratory
results. The VACorporate Data Warehouse Production Outpatient Phar-
macydomainprovidedinformationonprescriptions.TheVAVitalStatus
and Beneficiary Identification Records Locator Subsystem files provided
demographic characteristics and death follow-up through September 30,
2013.39,40 United States Renal Database System data provided informa-
tion about occurrence of ESRD and date of first ESRD services.
Primary Predictor Variable
The primary predictor variable is outpatient use of PPI. Medications
that contain esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole,
or rabeprazolewerecounted as PPI.Medications including ranitidine,
cimetidine, and famotidine were counted as H2 blockers. Distribution
of PPI and H2 blocker use is provided in Supplemental Table 9.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes in survival analyses were eGFR,60 ml/min per
1.73 m2, with CKD defined as two eGFRs,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at
Table 7.

 least 90 days apart, where the first eGFR measurement date was con-
sidered the date of CKD occurrence. Outcomes to capture kidney
disease progression included .30% decline in eGFR, doubling of
serum creatinine, ESRD,43–45 and ESRD or .50% decline in
eGFR.45,46 All outcomes except ESRD were based on outpatient
serum creatinine. Outcomes were ascertained for 5-year duration
from time of cohort entry (where baseline eGFR was captured).
Covariates
Baseline covariates were ascertained from October 1, 1999 until
baseline eGFR measure (T0), where baseline eGFR was defined as the
eGFR within 90 days before first PPI or H2 blocker prescription
between October 1, 2006, and September 30, 2008. Covariates in-
cluded baseline eGFR, age, race, sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
cardiovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular
disease, chronic lung disease, hepatitis C, HIV, dementia, and
diseases associated with PPI use. eGFR was calculated using the
abbreviated four-variable Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
Collaboration equation on the basis of age, sex, race, and outpatient
serum creatinine.47 Race/ethnicity was categorized as white, black,
or other (Latino, Asian, Native American, or other racial/ethnic
minority groups). Diseases associated with PPI use included gastro-
esophageal reflux disease, upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding, ulcer
disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, Barrett esophagus, achalasia,
stricture, and esophageal adenocarcinoma.48 Comorbidities, except
for hepatitis C and HIV, were assigned on the basis of relevant
ICD-9-CM diagnostic and procedures codes and Current Proce-
dural Terminology codes in the VA Medical SAS datasets.38,45,49,50
Hepatitis C and HIV were assigned based on laboratory results.
Statistical Analysis
t-test was used to detect mean difference for parametric continuous
variables; Kruskal–Wallis test was used to detect difference for
nonparametric continuous variables and chi-squared test was
used to detect proportions difference between H2 blockers
and PPI treatment. Incident rates per 100,000 person-years were
computed for outcomes and confidence intervals were estimated
based on normal distribution. Attributable risk and number
needed to harm were calculated from incident rates. Cox propor-
tional hazard regression models were used in the assessment of
the association between PPI exposure and risk of renal outcomes.
Multiple models were built to assess the relationship while con-
trolling for different covariates.
We evaluated the association between duration of exposure and
riskofrenaloutcomesamong newusersofPPI.Durationwas defined
in cumulative days of use and categorized as #30, 31–90, 91–180,
181–360, 361–720, or $721 days, where #30 days was used as the
referent category. Time of cohort entry was defined as the date of last
use of PPI before occurrence of renal event.32,51 Duration of PPI use
was computed from the date of first PPI use until beginning of
follow up.32,51 In regression analyses, a 95% CI of an HR that
does not include unity was considered statistically significant. In
all analyses a P value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically
significant. All analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide
version 6.1 and 7.1.
Sensitivity Analyses
To further explore the possibility of hidden bias we undertook
additional analyses examine the risk of renal outcomes in a 1:1
propensity score-matched cohorts of new users of H2 blockers who
initiated a first prescription of H2 blockers between October 1, 2006,
and September 30, 2008 (n=20,270) and new users of PPI who
initiated a first prescription of PPI between October 1, 2006, and
September 30, 2008 (n=20,270) (Supplemental Figure 1), and
also between new users of PPI (n=173,321) who initiated a first
prescription of PPI between October 1, 2006, and September 30,
2008, and a control group without PPI prescription between October
1, 2006, and September 30, 2008 (n=173,321) (Supplemental Figure
2). Propensity scores were calculated using a nonparsimonious
logistic regression model with PPI exposure as the dependent
variable, with predictor variables of baseline eGFR, age, race, sex,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, peripheral
artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, hep-
atitis C, HIV, dementia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper
gastrointestinal tract bleeding, ulcer disease, H. pylori infection,
Barrett esophagus, achalasia, stricture, and esophageal adenocar-
cinoma. Nearest-neighbor matching without replacement was
used, with a caliper distance set as 0.1, after the order of the treat-
ment and control group was randomized.52,53
After 1:1 propensity score-matched cohorts of new users of PPI
(n=20,270) and H2 blockers (n=20,270) (Supplemental Figure 1,
Supplemental Table 2), and 1:1 propensity matched cohort of new
PPI users (n=173,321) and a control group (n=173,321) (Supple-
mental Figure 2, Supplemental Table 3) were obtained, standardized
differences were used to evaluate balance in distribution of baseline
variables between PPI and control groups in matched cohorts,
where a difference ,0.1 was taken to indicate sufficient balance.
Multivariate conditional Cox proportional hazards regression that
stratified by matched pairs were conducted to examine the associa-
tion between PPI and outcomes.
As a test of calibration, we evaluated the association between PPI
exposure and the outcome of AKI during exposure to acid-suppression
therapy and where AKI was defined as 0.3 mg/dl or 50% increase in
serum creatinine within 30 days.45,49,54 To examine whether the asso-
ciation of PPI exposure and risk of chronic renal outcomes is mediated
by occurrence of AKI, we controlled for AKI occurrence during
exposure to acid-suppression therapy.
In order to further evaluate the consistency and robustness of
the findings of our study, we examined the observed associations
in a number of additional sensitivity analyses where we: (1) in-
cluded the number of eGFR measurements from October 1, 1999
until time of cohort entry (T0) for each patient as a covariate, (2)
included use of NSAIDs, defined in separate models as exposure
to NSAIDs for 30 days or more before and during time in cohort,
as a covariate, (3) included baseline microalbumin-to-creatinine
ratio as a covariate in a subcohort of patients where data
were available (n=29,059), (4) included serum bicarbonate as a
covariate where it was treated as a continuous variable, and (5)
included the ACEI and ARB, defined as exposure to ACEI or ARB
for 30 days or more before and during time in cohort as a covariate
in separate models.
