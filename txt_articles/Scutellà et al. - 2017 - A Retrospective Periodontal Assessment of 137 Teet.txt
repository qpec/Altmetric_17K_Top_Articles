A Retrospective Periodontal Assessment of 137 Teeth After 
Featheredge Preparation and Gingittage
The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the periodontal response 
of periodontally healthy teeth prosthetically restored using a featheredge finish 
line preparation combined with a light rotary curettage (gingittage). A total of 137 
restored teeth were included in the study. Mean follow-up time was 18.2 months 
(range: 6 to 60 months). Bleeding on probing was noted in 18% of cases, while 
the Plaque Index was found to be 11%. The probing depth in 99.4% of cases was 
≤ 3 mm. In only 7 cases (5.1%), a slight restoration margin exposure was recorded. 
Although randomized controlled studies with longer follow-up are advocated, the 
present investigation seems to suggest that this protocol is a viable procedure.

In fixed prosthodontics, the unsat-
isfactory appearance resulting from 
apical migration of the free gingival 
margin around definitive crowns is 
a major complication.
1 This can ul-
timately expose the crown-to-tooth 
interface and make the restoration 
unsuccessful, especially in the es-
thetic areas. 
Soft tissue recession around 
crown margins has been exten-
sively investigated, and a number 
of etiologic factors have been sug-
gested, including excessively sub-
gingival placement of the crown 
margin, iatrogenic soft tissue trauma 
during tooth preparation, aggressive 
and invasive gingival displacement 
procedures for the final impression, 
lack of marginal accuracy, horizontal 
overcontouring, and a thin and scal-
loped biotype. 
Although scientific evidence for 
many of these factors is lacking, a rela-
tionship between marginal inaccura-
cy and soft tissue recession has been 
reported.2 The finish line geometry 
(horizontal versus vertical) has often 
been held responsible for creating 
inaccuracy and thus tissue instabil-
ity.3 The cross-sectional configura-
tion of the finish line for full-coverage 
restorations has been extensively 
investigated, yet it remains a contro-
versial topic in prosthetic dentistry.4,5 
Various shapes have been described 
and advocated. Kuwata6 formulated 
a classification of the finish line from

the point of view of the margin an-
gle. He defined a margin angle be-
tween 0 and 30 degrees as a bevel, 
between 31 and 60 degrees as a 
chamfer, and between 61 and 90 de-
grees as a shoulder. A different and 
more practical system for classifying 
the geometry of the finish line was 
later proposed in which margins are 
broadly divided into two main class-
es: vertical and horizontal.7 Among 
margin designs, dentists usually pre-
fer horizontal, such as shoulders or 
chamfer, over vertical preparation, 
such as featheredge. This is most 
likely for practical reasons, includ-
ing that horizontal preparations are 
distinct; are readily visible on the 
prepared tooth, impression, and die; 
give a neat margin on the relined 
provisional restoration; and should 
produce better seating for the res-
toration. Vertical preparations such 
as featheredge have been consid-
ered unsuitable for metal-ceramic or 
all-ceramic crowns because of poor 
marginal adaptation, horizontal over-
contouring, and possible distortion 
of the cast during porcelain firing.8 
However, according to the literature, 
the vertical geometry rather than the 
horizontal has proven to reduce the 
marginal gap of the restoration and 
create a less irritating environment 
within the gingival sulcus.
9–11 Recent 
clinical studies have discussed the 
application of featheredge tooth 
preparation in different clinical situ-
ations.
12–14 The aim of this study is 
to retrospectively evaluate the peri-
odontal response of prepared pros-
thetic teeth with a featheredge finish 
line combined with a rotary gingival 
curettage (gingittage).
Materials and Methods
The data collection was carried out 
between November 2015 and Janu-
ary 2016, and patients subjected to 
regular hygiene recall were enrolled. 
The inclusion criteria were as follows: 
(1) at least one restored periodon-
tally healthy tooth treated according 
to the protocol; (2) American Soci-
ety of Anesthesiologist (ASA)-1 or 
-2 classification; (3) aged > 18 years. 
Patients with disabling diseases and 
those on anticoagulant therapy were 
excluded.
Data were collected using a 
specific form before each session of 
programmed dental hygiene.
Restorative Procedures
All teeth analyzed in this study were 
prepared by the same operator (F.S.) 
according to standardized technical 
procedures. Tooth reduction started 
after the sulcus depth was measured. 
Sulcus probing may also provide im-
portant information regarding the 
tissue biotype and soft tissue thick-
ness. The biotype was considered 
thin if the periodontal probe could 
be seen through the gingiva; oth-
erwise, it was categorized as thick.
15 
Simultaneous to tooth preparation, 
a rotary curettage of the gingival 
sulcus (gingittage) was performed. 
Such gingittage has already been 
described16,17 as an expected con-
sequence of the featheredge type 
of preparation. The preparation did 
not extend subgingivally deeper 
than 1 mm from the gingival margin 
regardless of the probing depth re-
corded at baseline so as to avoid any 
violation of the biologic width.
18,19 
The depth of preparation could be 
easily controlled using specifically 
designed laser-marked burs (Komet 
6862D / 012) (Fig 1). Such burs have 
the same reference markers as a 
periodontal probe, where the first 
black mark begins 1 mm from the tip 
and is readily visible throughout the 
entire preparation process. There-
fore, the markers allow the opera-
tor to know the exact depth of the 
sulcus at all times. Once the tooth 
preparation was completed, allow-
ing sufficient room for the restor-
ative materials, a fine-grit diamond 
bur was used to refine the prepara-
tion and create a smooth surface 
with parallel walls and a featheredge 
design. The immediate temporary

crown application with its convex 
profile prevented the soft tissue 
margin from collapsing on the pre-
pared tooth surfaces. The margin 
of the provisional crown was always 
placed within 1 mm subgingivally. 
The gingittage led to blood clot for-
mation and enhanced the healing 
response.20,21
None of the treated teeth had 
to be reprepared after the first ap-
pointment. 
At 1 to 2 weeks after tooth prep-
aration, a final impression was taken. 
The impression could be taken using 
a conventional material, such as poly-
ether or silicone, or digitally, through 
an intraoral scanning device (Bluecam 
Sirona Dental Systems), after placing 
either single (000) or double (00 + 
000) retraction cord (Ultrapak Clean 
Cut, Ultradent). The restorative mate-
rial for the final crowns was indiffer-
ently selected among metal-ceramic, 
zirconium oxide, and lithium disilicate, 
following only the esthetic require-
ments and/or mechanical properties 
required by the case. The definitive 
restoration margins were visually 
tested and assessed by probing the 
sulcus to be sure they were located 
1 mm subgingivally. 
Final cementation was per-
formed a few days after the im-
pression with the corresponding 
cementation system selected ac-
cording to the guidelines present in 
the literature.22
Therefore, complete healing of 
the newly formed tissue took place 
around a definitive ceramic restora-
tion, which had a smoother surface 
and better-defined contours and 
was more accurate in terms of pre-
cision compared to the temporary 
crown. 
Figures 2 to 21 illustrate two cas-
es that describe the above technique.
Fig 2 Tooth preparation was always carried 
out by means of a laser-marked bur (see 
Fig 1). This allowed consistent placement 
of the end of the preparation 1 mm within 
the gingival sulcus. All teeth included in 
this study were prepared following the 
same strict protocol. At the end of tooth 
preparation, each tooth was checked 
visually and by probing the sulcus for a 
1-mm subgingival finish line where the 
provisional was placed. At the time of final 
impression, on removal of the provisional, 
finish line position was checked again and 
no clinical changes in the gingival level 
were noticed. The stone dies prepared by 
the lab (see Fig 12) are evidence of this 
clinical observation. After 1 to 2 weeks, 
before the final restoration was cemented, 
margin positions were checked once 
again and were found to still be 1 mm 
subgingivally. It was finally assumed that 
throughout all steps of the procedures, 
from tooth preparation to final delivery, soft 
tissue margins remained at the same level.

Examined Variables 
The following primary variables (at 
tooth level) were analyzed: keratin-
ized mucosa, probing depth (at six 
points per tooth), tissue recession 
(meaning the distance between the 
restoration and the gingival mar-
gin), bleeding on probing (BoP), and 
presence of plaque (at six sites per 
tooth).
Secondary variables were full-
mouth plaque score (FMPS) and full-
mouth bleeding score (FMBS) of the 
patient, periodontal biotype, type 
of restorative material, and pros-
thesis complications such as loss of 
vitality of the element, presence of 
caries, chipping/fracture, and loss of 
retention.
Statistical Analysis
Differences in the outcome vari-
ables between patients with dif-
ferent biotypes were evaluated. 
Pearson’s chi-square was used for 
recession incidence, and unpaired 
Student t test was used for other 
variables (Plaque Index, BoP
, FMPS, 
and FMBS). P = .05 was considered 
the significance threshold.

Results
A total of 21 patients (15 women 
and 6 men) with a mean age of 59.9 
years (range: 36 to 84 years) were 
finally included in the study. Gen-
eral features of the study sample 
are reported in Table 1. FMPS and 
FMBS were recorded before the 
dental hygiene sessions and found 
to be 17.71% and 17.23%, respec-
tively, on a patient basis; 55% of 
teeth had a thick periodontal bio-
type. The 137 rehabilitated teeth 
included in the analysis had a mean 
follow-up of 18.20 months (range: 6 
to 60 months) and were divided into 
three groups based on restorative 
material: 50% metal ceramic, 27% 
zirconia, and 23% lithium disilicate. 
The distribution of tooth type is de-
scribed in Table 2. The keratinized 
gingiva was on average 2.09 mm.

periodontal indexes shows that the 
BoP was 18%, while the Plaque In-
dex (PI) was 11% on a tooth basis. In 
52% of the treated teeth, no bleed-
ing was noted, and in 65.6% no 
plaque was present. In 99.4% of the 
cases, probing depth, carried out 
at 6 points per tooth, was ≤ 3 mm, 
while in the remaining 0.6% it was 
4 mm. Soft tissue recession (con-
sidered as crown margin exposure) 
occurred in 5.1% of the cases, or 7 
restored teeth of 137. Of these, two 
occurred in the same patient, who 
also showed significant teeth abra-
sion due to an aggressive brushing 
technique. Taking into account the 
periodontal biotype, there were 
no statistically significant differ-
ences in terms of recession inci-
dence (P = .22), BoP (P = .97), or PI 
(P = .09). Finally, only two prosthetic 
complications occurred: loss of re-
tention and caries infiltration.
Discussion
Soft tissue recession around crown 
margins has always been a major 
concern in restorative dentistry. 
Many etiologic factors have been 
suggested, though few have been 
scientifically demonstrated to be 
responsible.2 The tooth preparation 
design may significantly influence 
soft tissue behavior, namely the ac-
curacy with which different design 
types guarantee the final restoration. 
The proposed protocol allows 
proper management of the subgin-
gival portion of the restoration. The 
laser-marked bur allows minimiza-
tion of the trauma to the connective 
tissue. 
Many in vitro and in vivo studies 
have demonstrated that the feath-
eredge preparation shows the least 
marginal discrepancy compared to 
other preparation designs.4,9–11
Furthermore, a smaller gap will 
cause less extrusion of cement that 
would be in direct contact with the 
sensitive gingival sulcus environ-
ment.
The gingittage or rotary curet-
tage of the soft tissue wall of the 
gingival sulcus, which is central to 
the present protocol, has been de-
scribed in the literature
16 and further 
developed by Ingraham et al17 with 
the purpose of removing a limited 
amount of soft tissue from the lat-
eral sulcus wall while a chamfer finish 
line was simultaneously prepared on 
the tooth structure.
17 The suitabil-
ity of the gingiva for this procedure 
is determined by three factors: an 
absence of BoP
, a sulcus depth of 
< 3 mm, and adequate keratinized 
tissue height.
17 Several studies have 
been carried out to compare the 
clinical efficacy and wound healing 
of rotary curettage with more con-
ventional techniques for soft tissue 
displacement before the final im-
pression. Kamansky et al23 reported 
fewer changes in gingival height with 
rotary curettage than with lateral 
gingival displacement using retrac-
tion cords. Ingraham et al17 reported 
slight differences in tissue healing 
after testing three different soft tis-
sue displacement techniques: rotary 
gingival curettage, pressure packing 
cord, and electrosurgery.
Another key element of the 
suggested protocol is the shape of 
the crown contour. The contour of 
the artificial crowns is a widely dis-
cussed topic.20 Overcontouring has 
been frequently considered a detri-
mental anomaly in crown construc-
tion, leading to tissue inflammation 
and periodontal problems.25 The 
crown contour has two major com-
ponents: the emergence profile (EP) 
and the cervical contour (CC). The 
term EP was first proposed by Stein 
and Kuwata,26 and the EP has been 
defined as “the contour of a tooth 
or restoration, such as a crown on a 
natural tooth or dental implant abut-
ment, as it relates to the adjacent 
tissues.”27 In contrast, the CC is nei-
ther flat nor concave, but convex. It 
corresponds to the cementoenamel 
junction (CEJ) bulk and was first de-
scribed by Wheeler,28 who referred 
to it as a curvature that should always 
be recreated in artificial crowns. De-
claring that it should be physiologic, 
he added that it has the important 
role of “holding the surrounding tis-
sues into tension and health.” The 
CC is the subgingival cervical start 
related to the profile and is differ-
ent from the EP
. The latter is straight 
and flat, while the former is convex. 
The amount of this convexity can be 
measured through the emergence 
angle (EA), the angle formed by 
the junction of a line through the 
long axis of the tooth and a tan-
gent drawn coronal to the tooth as 
it emerges from the sulcus29 (Fig 10). 
In the past, anecdotal information 
has been used to assign a value to 
the EA.30 However, a more recent 
study has reported on measure-
ment of this angle on natural human 
teeth with a scientific protocol.29 The 
authors, using a three-dimensional 
radiologic assessment, measured 
this angle on 148 maxillary anterior

teeth. Central incisors showed an 
average angle of 15 degrees, lat-
eral incisors had an angle of 12 de-
grees, and the average canine angle 
was 11 degrees. The same authors 
measured the EP
, which is located 
coronal to the CC and emerges 
from the gingival margin, reporting 
that it is definitely flat.
Every time the CEJ is lost, this 
anatomical landmark should be 
artificially recreated with a physi-
ologic angle that supports the sur-
rounding soft tissue. This should 
not be seen as an overcontour but 
as an artificially recreated CEJ. This 
physiologically convex area must be 
reproduced, and it will increase the 
bulk of the restorative material in the 
cervical third. This also allows the 
use of any kind of restorative mate-
rial, including metal-ceramic, lithium 
disilicate,
12 or zirconium oxide.31 
Artificial crowns on a vertical 
margin have been used over the 
years, especially in cases of peri-
odontally involved teeth where the 
featheredge was the only resource, 
as it was impossible to prepare a 
shoulder or a chamfer at root level.32 
A recent publication demonstrated 
the effectiveness of this therapy 
with 20 years follow-up.33
The retrospective study pre-
sented in this paper, although it in-
cluded a small number of patients, 
shows that teeth restored with this 
protocol do not suffer from any 
periodontal disease. All periodontal 
indices were measured before the 
regular hygiene recall; therefore, we 
can assume a standard situation was 
registered. Second BoP and PI of 
the restored teeth are in accordance 
with FMPS and FMBS, meaning that 
there is no difference between the 
restored teeth and the rest of the 
patients’ dentition. Also with regard 
to the probing depth (carried out 
at 6 points per tooth), 99.4% of the 
cases fell within the physiologic lim-
its. The use of a standardized clinical 
protocol and dedicated instruments 
allowed correct crown margin po-
sitioning, respecting the biologic 
width and achieving a good soft tis-
sue response. The presence of an 
adequate band of keratinized gin-
giva, which was about 2 mm, was 
definitely a favorable factor and has 
undoubtedly contributed to the sta-
bility of the result. 
Conclusions
Although further studies are need-
ed with a larger number of patients 
and a longer follow-up, the present 
study suggests that the application 
of a precise protocol that involves 
the use of featheredge and gingit-
tage is respectful of the supporting 
periodontal tissues. The absence of 
signs of periodontal inflammation 
around prosthetic crowns is a tangi-
ble sign of tissues responding posi-
tively to this operational protocol (or 
approach), which gives the clinician 
more freedom to change the form 
and esthetics of the restoration, 
shortens and simplifies the labora-
tory phases, and provides greater 
tissue stability in the midterm.
