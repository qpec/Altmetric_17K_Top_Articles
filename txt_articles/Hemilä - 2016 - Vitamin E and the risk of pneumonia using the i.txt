Abstract
Analyses in nutritional epidemiology usually assume a uniform effect of a nutrient. Previously, four subgroups of the Alpha-Tocopherol,
Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study of Finnish male smokers aged 50–69 years were identified in which vitamin E
supplementation either significantly increased or decreased the risk of pneumonia. The purpose of this present study was to quantify the level
of true heterogeneity in the effect of vitamin E on pneumonia incidence using the I 2 statistic. The I 2 value estimates the percentage of total
variation across studies that is explained by true differences in the treatment effect rather than by chance, with a range from 0 to 100 %. The
I 2 statistic for the effect of vitamin E supplementation on pneumonia risk for five subgroups of the ATBC population was 89 % (95 % CI 78,
95 %), indicating that essentially all heterogeneity was true variation in vitamin E effect instead of chance variation. The I 2 statistic for
heterogeneity in vitamin E effects on pneumonia risk was 92 % (95 % CI 80, 97 %) for three other ATBC subgroups defined by smoking level
and leisure-time exercise level. Vitamin E decreased pneumonia risk by 69 % among participants who had the least exposure to smoking and
exercised during leisure time (7·6 % of the ATBC participants), and vitamin E increased pneumonia risk by 68 % among those who had the
highest exposure to smoking and did not exercise (22 % of the ATBC participants). These findings refute there being a uniform effect of
vitamin E supplementation on the risk of pneumonia.

The effect of vitamin E supplementation on mortality has been
studied in numerous randomised trials, the results of which
have been pooled in several meta-analyses(1–3). Usually meta-
analyses calculate a single estimate of effect, such as a 4 %
increase in mortality by vitamin E(1). The calculation of a single
estimate is based on the assumption that there is a uniform size
of effect that is informative for all the included trials, and also
applies to populations not included in the analysed trials.
Biology is complex, and it is possible that the effect of vitamin E
on health outcomes depends on various characteristics of
people and on their lifestyles. Therefore, a single universal
estimate of vitamin E effect might be substantially misleading
for some population groups. We found in our previous analyses
of the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention
(ATBC) Study on Finnish male smokers that the effects
of vitamin E supplementation were modified as follows: the
risk
of
common
cold
by
age,
smoking
and
residential
neighbourhood(4), the risk of tuberculosis by vitamin C intake(5)
and mortality by age and vitamin C intake(6). These findings
challenge the notion that the health effects of vitamin E are
uniform over the entire ATBC Study population. However, a
quantitative estimation of the true within-trial heterogeneity in
vitamin E effects has not been carried out previously.
The I 2 statistic was developed for the quantification of true
heterogeneity between multiple controlled trials included in a
meta-analysis(7,8). The I 2 value estimates the percentage of total
variation across different studies, which is explained by true
variation in the treatment effect rather than by chance variation.
The range of the I 2 scale is from 0 to 100 %, and a value greater
than about 75 % indicates a high level of true treatment
heterogeneity(8). To our knowledge, the I 2 statistic has not been
used previously to quantify the level of true heterogeneity
between the subgroups of a single randomised trial.
Vitamin E is an antioxidant and it influences the immune
system(9,10). Therefore, it might influence infections of the lungs
exposed to O2 and airborne oxidants. In our previous analyses
of the ATBC Study data, the effect of vitamin E on pneumonia
incidence differed from the null effect for several subgroups,
which were identified by different types of reasoning: by the
level of smoking, physical activity, weight and dietary vitamin C
intake(11–15). The goal of this study was to quantify the level of
true heterogeneity in the effect of vitamin E on pneumonia risk

 over the identified ATBC Study subgroups by using the
I 2 statistic.
Methods
Participants
The rationale, design and methods of the ATBC Study, to
examine the effects of vitamin E (DL-α-tocopheryl acetate, AT,
50 mg/d) and β-carotene (BC, 20 mg/d) on the incidence of
lung cancer and other cancers and the primary findings, have
been described in detail(16,17). The ATBC Study is registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier NCT00342992. In brief,
males aged 50–69 years who smoked ≥5 cigarettes/d at entry
(n 29 133) were randomised into one of four intervention
arms – placebo, AT, BC or AT + BC – according to a 2 × 2
factorial design. Supplementation with vitamin E in the form
of DL-α-tocopheryl-acetate increased the mean serum levels of
α-tocopherol by 50 % compared with baseline(17). The inter-
vention continued for 5–8 years until April 1993. The trial was
approved by the review boards of the participating institutions,
and all participants gave their written informed consent. Com-
pliance with supplementation was high: 90 % of the subjects
took >90 % of their prescribed capsules during their active
participation in the trial(17).
Baseline characteristics
Before
randomisation,
the
participants
completed
ques-
tionnaires on medical and smoking histories and general
background
characteristics(11,12,16,17).
The
baseline
ques-
tionnaire enquired about the intensity of leisure-time physical
activity in terms of the following three alternatives: (1) light:
reading, watching TV, listening to the radio or going to movies;
(2) moderate: walking, fishing, hunting or gardening quite
regularly; and (3) heavy: actual physical exercise such as
jogging, skiing, swimming, gymnastics and court and field
sports quite regularly. In the current analysis, ‘exercise during
leisure time’
combines positive
responses to
alternatives
(2) (n 15 191) and (3) (n 1744).
Outcome and follow-up time
The outcome of this study, the first hospital-treated case of
pneumonia after randomisation, was ascertained from the
national Hospital Discharge Register using the volunteer’s
unique personal identification number, given to all Finnish
residents, for linkage(11). Follow-up time began from the day of
randomisation and continued until the date of the first hospital
discharge for pneumonia, death or the end of the trial, which-
ever came first. There was a total of 167 968 person-years of
observation (median follow-up 5·8 years).
Statistical methods
The effect of vitamin E supplementation on pneumonia inci-
dence was estimated by Cox’s proportional hazards models.
The
trial
participants
to
whom
vitamin
E
alone
or
in
combination with BC were administered (AT and AT + BC) were
compared with the no-vitamin E supplement groups (placebo
and BC). The exceptions were subgroup 3 in Fig. 1 and 2 and
subgroup A in Fig. 3, for which the comparison was restricted to
no-BC
participants
because
of
the
significant
interaction
between AT and BC(15). We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and
the 95 % CI of the RR using the PROC PHREG program of the
SAS package of programs (release 9.4; SAS Institute Inc.). Forest
plots were constructed using the metagen and forest programs
of the R program package; the I 2 statistic with its 95 % CI and
the Cochran Q test-based χ2 values for heterogeneity were
calculated(18). To test the statistical significance of interaction
between vitamin E supplementation and the set of subgroups,
vitamin E and the subgroups were first added to the Cox’s
model. The statistical significance of the interaction was there-
after calculated from the change in −2 × log (likelihood) when
the vitamin E subgroup interaction terms were added to the
model.
Results
The ATBC Study included males aged 50–69 years who smoked
≥5 cigarettes/d at entry. Further characteristics of the partici-
pants have been described previously(11–17). There were 898
pneumonia cases during the follow-up period corresponding to
an average rate of 5·3 pneumonia cases per 1000 person-years.
Among all 29 133 ATBC participants, the pneumonia cases were
identically distributed between the vitamin E and no-vitamin E
groups, 449 v. 449, corresponding to the average effect of
vitamin E supplementation of RR 1·00 (95 % CI 0·88, 1·14).
To quantify the level of heterogeneity in vitamin E effect, the
ATBC participants were divided into six subgroups on the basis
of previous findings (Fig. 1). The primary cut-off point for the
subgroups was the age at which the participant initiated
smoking (≤20 v. ≥21 years), which significantly modified the
effect of vitamin E in the first series of subgroup analyses(11).
The second-level subgroups 1 and 2 were formed by the
subject’s body weight and dietary vitamin C intake(14), and
subgroups 3 and 6 were formed by the level of cigarette
smoking at baseline and the level of exercise at leisure time at
baseline(15). The participants who did not fall into these second-
level subgroups were classified as ‘the rest’, and they comprised
subgroups 4 and 5. A forest plot of the six subgroups is shown
in Fig. 2. The number of pneumonia cases in the six subgroups
is shown in the online Supplementary Table S1.
Essentially all heterogeneity over the six subgroups was true
variation in the vitamin E effect rather than chance variation:
I 2 = 87 % (95 % CI 73, 93 %) (Fig. 2).
In subgroup 6, vitamin E supplementation decreased the risk
of pneumonia by 69 % (95 % CI 44, 87 %; n 2216). This group
included people who started smoking at a later age (≥21 years),
smoked just 5–19 cigarettes/d at study entry and carried out
leisure-time exercise(15). This subgroup in which vitamin E was
beneficial covered 7·6 % of the ATBC participants.
The three groups – 1, 2 and 3 – for which vitamin E increased
pneumonia risk by 209 % (95 % CI 45, 560 %; n 468), 134 %
(95 % CI 7, 408 %; n 1328) and by 68 % (95 % CI 18, 140 %;

 n 3022), respectively, included males who started smoking at a
younger age (≤20 years). In addition, these participants had low
body weight and vitamin C intakes above the median (group 1),
high body weight (group 2), smoked ≥20 cigarettes/d at study
entry and did not carry out leisure-time exercise (group 3)(14,15).
In all, these three subgroups in which vitamin E was harmful
covered 28 % of the ATBC participants.
Vitamin E supplementation did not influence pneumonia risk
among the rest of the participants (groups 4 and 5). These two
subgroups covered 66 % of the ATBC study participants.
In Fig. 1 and 2, these two groups are shown separately to
illustrate the background of the subgroup division. However,
maintaining the two ‘rest of the participants’ groups separately
is redundant, as both of them are consistent with no effect.
When these two groups were combined, the heterogeneity over
the remaining five subgroups increased to I 2 = 89 % (95 % CI 78,
95 %) (online Supplementary Fig. S1). When the five subgroups
were allowed independent vitamin E effects in the Cox’s
regression model, the statistical model was improved by
χ2 = 42·3 (4 df) corresponding to P = 10 − 8.

 When small subgroups are formed, the balance of the
baseline variables might be compromised. The uppermost
subgroup 1 was small with only 468 participants – that is, only
1·6 % of all ATBC Study participants (Fig. 1 and 2). Nevertheless,
the baseline differences in relevant variables between the
vitamin E and no-vitamin E participants in this subgroup were
close to zero with narrow CI. Furthermore, inclusion of baseline
variables in the Cox’s model did not substantially change the
estimate of vitamin E effect (online Supplementary Table S2).
Thus, the difference in pneumonia occurrence between the
vitamin E and the no-vitamin E participants in subgroup 1
cannot be explained by an imbalance in relevant baseline
variables. The other groups, 2, 3 and 6, in which vitamin E
significantly affected pneumonia risk are much larger, and a
baseline imbalance is of even less concern.
A simplified analysis with only three subgroups was also
carried out (Fig. 3). This division was based on the age at
initiating smoking, the level of cigarette smoking at baseline
and the level of leisure-time exercise at baseline(15). Group A
had the highest smoking levels without leisure-time exercise.
Group C had the lowest levels of smoking with active
leisure-time exercise. Thus, the characteristics of group C are
the opposite of group A. The effects of vitamin E also point to
the opposite directions in these two subgroups. Group B
includes participants who did not belong to group A or C. The
I 2 statistic for heterogeneity in this set of three subgroups was
92 % (95 % CI 81, 97 %), indicating that essentially all the het-
erogeneity in this subgroup division was a true variation of the
vitamin E effect and not chance fluctuation. When the three
subgroups were allowed independent vitamin E effects in the
Cox’s regression model, the statistical model improved by
χ2 = 28·7 (2 df) corresponding to P = 10 − 6.
Discussion
The number of pneumonia cases in the ATBC Study was evenly
distributed between the vitamin E and the no-vitamin E parti-
cipants, indicating no overall average effect with great accuracy.
Nevertheless, within the ATBC Study population, there was a
high level of true heterogeneity for the effect of vitamin E
on pneumonia risk as shown in the present study. Not only
the I 2 point estimates but also the entire 95 % CI ranges of the
I 2 were above the 75 % level, which has been judged as the
threshold for high level of true heterogeneity(8). This indicates
that the overall average zero effect is not applicable for all
ATBC participants. It follows, therefore, that there cannot be a
uniform vitamin E supplementation effect on pneumonia risk
over the Western male population, as Finnish males of the
ATBC Study form a subgroup of Western males.
All the variables used to define the subgroups of Fig. 1 have a
biological rationale: smoking has an influence on vitamin E
metabolism(19), vitamins C and E interact(19,20) and sporadic
physical activity causes oxidative stress(21) against which anti-
oxidant vitamin E may protect. Finally, the dose–effect rela-
tionship is a basic concept in pharmacology. Consequently, the
effects of a fixed vitamin E dose may depend on body weight as
the dose per body weight varies(14).
When the modification of vitamin E effect is complex and
defined by half a dozen or more variables, there is no unam-
biguous way to form subgroups that are distinguished by
different sizes of the vitamin E effect. Pragmatic cut-off limits are
used in Fig. 1–3; yet, it is unreasonable from the biological
perspective to assume exact cut-off points. Nevertheless, the
main issue in this study is not the specific locations of the cut-off
points, but the finding of the very high level of true hetero-
geneity
in
the
vitamin
E
effect
over
the
29 133
ATBC
participants.
The level of true heterogeneity of vitamin E effect depends
on the combination of the sizes of the vitamin E effects for the
subgroups and the sizes of the subgroups themselves. Thus, the
estimate of I 2 = 92 % in Fig. 3 is not a characteristic of vitamin E
but it is generated by the combination of the specific subgroup
sizes and the effects of vitamin E within the particular sub-
groups of the ATBC Study cohort.
The high level of true heterogeneity in the effect of vitamin E
on pneumonia has important implications. First, it provides a
strong argument against the opinion that subgroup analyses of

Fig. 3. A forest plot of three subgroups on vitamin E and the incidence of pneumonia in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study,
1985–1993. Group A in this forest plot includes participants who started smoking at ≤20 years of age and smoked ≥20 cigarettes/d at study entry and did not carry out
leisure-time exercise (23·0 % of the ATBC participants). Group C includes males who started smoking at ≥21 years of age and smoked 5–19 cigarettes/d at study entry
and carried out leisure-time exercise (7·6 %). Group B includes all the other participants (69·4 %). The estimate of effect shown for subgroup 3 is based on the
no-β-carotene participants only, as vitamin E and β-carotene had a significant interaction in that subgroup; see Hemilä & Kaprio(15) for the origin of these three
subgroups. In the forest plot on the right-hand side, the vertical line indicates the placebo level. The Cochran Q heterogeneity test χ2 = 25·7 (2 df) corresponds to

Heterogeneity in the effects of vitamin E

 randomised trials should be strongly discouraged because they
can lead to false-positive findings due to the multiple compar-
ison problem(22–25). Altman stated that biological plausibility is a
weak criterion when deciding whether a subgroup finding is
likely to be real, as in his view ‘doctors seem able to find a
biologically plausible explanation for any finding’(22). Although
there is much room for speculation at the molecular level of
biology because the number of genes and proteins is huge, the
number of variables relevant at the population level of biology
is much more limited. Few variables are as important at the
population level as smoking, which modified the effect of
vitamin E (Fig. 1–3).
Many trials are small and they do not have the statistical
power to analyse subgroup differences. For example, one
study on vitamin E and respiratory infections included 652
participants who were followed-up for 788 person-years(26),
and another study included 617 participants followed-up for
540 person-years(27). In contrast, the ATBC Study included
29 133
participants
followed-up
for
168 000
person-years.
Consequently, the ATBC Study, when analysed as subgroups,
may be considered to be a large series of small studies covering
a wide range of population groups with different characteristics.
A large, randomised trial has consistent treatment and outcome
definitions. Therefore, a subgroup analysis of a large trial is
much more informative than a comparison of a series of small
trials with slightly varying interventions and outcome defini-
tions, even when the total number of participants in the latter
might be the same. Although the multiple comparison problem
is a relevant concern in subgroup analysis of small studies, it is
not a reasonable explanation for the narrow CI of the I 2 statistic
found in the present subgroup analysis (Fig. 2 and 3).
Biology is complex and it is unlikely that the belief in a
uniform treatment effect is usually justified. The groups of
people in whom a treatment is either most or least effective can
be found only by comparing the effects on different groups of
people. Feinstein wanted to ‘rescue the scientific importance of
valid pathophysiologic subgroups from being forgotten or
destroyed by excessive vehemence in suggestions that all
subgroups are evil’(28) and Lagakos commented that ‘avoiding
any presentation of subgroup analysis because of their history
of being over-interpreted is a steep price to pay for a problem
that can be remedied by more responsible analysis and
reporting’(29). Given the long-term commitment of study parti-
cipants and the resources invested, it might even be considered
as an ethical duty of the researchers to analyse large trials
extensively rather than simply calculating a single overall
average effect. Nevertheless, it is also important to carry out
subgroup analysis with caution and not over-interpret the
findings.
The second implication of the high level of true heterogeneity
within the ATBC Study cohort concerns the pooling of diverse
randomised trials in meta-analyses. Calculation of a pooled
estimate of effect is based on the assumption that there is a
uniform effect that is informative. However, small studies have
wide CI and may not reveal heterogeneity even if the biological
effect does differ between the studied populations. On the other
hand, large studies may include people who vary substantially
in their characteristics and in the effects of treatments; yet, the
overall average effect may camouflage substantial variations
between subpopulations as shown in Fig. 1–3. Therefore, the
pooled estimates of meta-analyses can be spuriously precise
and may suffer from ecological fallacy, which means that study-
level analysis can lead to different conclusions than corre-
sponding individual-level analysis(30,31). Analyses of the ATBC
Study also found evidence that the effect of vitamin E on
mortality was heterogeneous(6,32). Therefore, the averages cal-
culated in meta-analyses, such as the 4 % increase in mortality
for vitamin E supplementation(1), may not be valid for many
population groups.
The third implication of the heterogeneity in vitamin E effects
is that cohort studies on nutrition and health may often be
misleading. In cohort studies, confounders are adjusted to allow
the calculation of a single estimate of effect over the study
population. For example, in their cohort study with male US
health professionals between 40 and 75 years of age, Merchant
et al.(33) reported no association between daily vitamin E intake
and community-acquired pneumonia. However, when several
variables modify the effect of vitamin E on pneumonia risk
(Fig. 1–3), it is evident that the effects of vitamin E should be
investigated separately in subpopulations defined by those
modifier variables, instead of calculating a single average effect
adjusting for those variables as if they were confounders. Large
trials such as the ATBC Study can give accurate effect estimates
for subgroups as shown by the current study. However, similar
subgroup analyses in cohort studies are much more challenging
or impossible because of the close associations between dietary
variables with each other and with numerous other lifestyle
factors(34).
Finally, vitamin E supplementation has been proposed for
improving the immune system(35). However, in the ATBC Study,
28 % of males had an increased risk of pneumonia because of
vitamin E administration (Fig. 1). In addition, the combination of
vitamin E supplementation and a high level of dietary vitamin C
intake increased the risk of tuberculosis by 72 % (95 % CI 4,
185 %)(5), and vitamin E increased the risk of common cold in a
subpopulation of the participants(4). Thus, even though sub-
group 6 of Fig. 1 indicates that some people may benefit from
vitamin E by gaining protection against infection, there is evi-
dence of harm in some other people. Given the current limited
understanding about who might benefit, vitamin E should not
be suggested for the general population for improving the
immune system.
Although the 69 % reduction in the risk of pneumonia is a
substantial effect in subgroup 6 (Fig. 1), given the pneumonia
rate of about six cases/1000 person-years, approximately 250
people would need vitamin E supplementation for 1 year to
prevent one episode of pneumonia in males in that subgroup.
Community-acquired pneumonia in middle-aged people is
usually cured quite rapidly by antibiotics and rarely leads to
long-term or permanent sequelae; thus, the practical sig-
nificance of vitamin E is not clear even in this subgroup. Fur-
thermore, the ATBC Study participants were mostly born in the
1920s and 1930s and lived through the WWII years. Therefore,
the estimate of effect calculated for the 7·6 % subgroup of the
ATBC Study cohort should not be generalised to current
middle-aged males in Western countries.

 In conclusion, the I 2 statistic may be a useful measure when
analysing within-trial heterogeneity in large, randomised trials.
The numerical estimates of vitamin E effect in the analysed
subgroups of the present study are much less essential than the
high level of true heterogeneity over the entire ATBC Study
cohort. When an effect is heterogeneous, great caution should
be exercised in the extrapolation of the effect estimates to other
contexts. The high level of true heterogeneity found in the
current study indicates that the uniform effect estimates calcu-
lated in meta-analyses and cohort studies on vitamin E may
often be misleading. There seems to be a need for further
research on vitamin E for non-smoking, middle-aged and older
males who exercise in their leisure time.
