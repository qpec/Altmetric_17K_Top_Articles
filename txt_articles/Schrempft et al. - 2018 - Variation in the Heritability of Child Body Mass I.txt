IMPORTANCE The early obesogenic home environment is consistently identified as a key
influence on child weight trajectories, but little research has examined the mechanisms of
that influence. Such research is essential for the effective prevention and treatment of
overweight and obesity.
OBJECTIVE To test behavioral susceptibility theory’
s hypothesis that the heritability of body
mass index (BMI) is higher among children who live in more obesogenic home environments.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study was a gene-environment interaction twin
study that used cross-sectional data from 925 families (1850 twins) in the Gemini cohort
(a population-based prospective cohort of twins born in England and Wales between March
and December 2007). Data were analyzed from July to October 2013 and in June 2018.
EXPOSURES Parents completed the Home Environment Interview, a comprehensive measure
of the obesogenic home environment in early childhood. Three standardized composite
scores were created to capture food, physical activity, and media-related influences in the
home; these were summed to create an overall obesogenic risk score. The 4 composite
scores were split on the mean, reflecting higher-risk and lower-risk home environments.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Quantitative genetic model fitting was used to estimate
heritability of age-adjusted and sex-adjusted BMI (BMI SD score, estimated using British 1990
growth reference data) for children living in lower-risk and higher-risk home environments.
RESULTS Among 1850 twins (915 [49.5%] male and 935 [50.5%] female; mean [SD] age, 4.1
[0.4] years), the heritability of BMI SD score was significantly higher among children living in
overall higher-risk home environments (86%; 95% CI, 68%-89%) compared with those living
in overall lower-risk home environments (39%; 95% CI, 21%-57%). The findings were similar
when examining the heritability of BMI in the separate food and physical activity environment
domains.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings support the hypothesis that obesity-related
genes are more strongly associated with BMI in more obesogenic home environments.
Modifying the early home environment to prevent weight gain may be particularly important
for children genetically at risk for obesity.

umanbodymassindex(BMI)(calculatedasweightinki-

heritable, as indicated in recent reviews of twin
studies.1,2However,thereissubstantialvariationinBMIherita-

talcharacteristics.TheheritabilityofBMIishigherinpopulations

pothesisthatobesity-relatedgenesaremorestronglyassociated
with BMI in more obesogenic home environments.
Molecular genetic studies have corroborated findings from
twin studies, showing that the environment modifies the as-
sociation between measured genetic risk of obesity and BMI.
In a large European sample of children (n = 4406), the effect
of the FTO genotype on BMI was stronger among children with
parents of low socioeconomic status.6 In another study, the as-
sociation between a composite indicator of genetic risk of obe-
sity and BMI was stronger for more recent birth cohorts, who
by implication had had greater exposure to the obesogenic
environment.7
Differences in economic growth and socioeconomic sta-
tus are macro-level influences of the environment. The food,
physical activity, and entertainment environments are proxi-
mal or micro-level influences on energy intake and physical
activity; these include the home, school, and neighborhood
settings.8 Some research has found that living in more walk-
able neighborhood environments suppresses genetic vari-
ance in adult BMI.9 However, no studies have examined
whether the heritability of BMI varies by the home environ-
ment in childhood. This is an important research endeavor be-
cause the home environment is within an individual’
s con-
trol and has been identified as a key influence on early weight
trajectories.10,11 Understanding the role of the home environ-
ment from a gene-environment perspective can further in-
form home-based childhood obesity prevention and treat-
ment efforts, which have been ineffective.12
The obesogenic home environment incorporates food,
physical activity, and media-related influences, such as the
availability of healthy and unhealthy foods, opportunities for
physical activity, and parental rules around media use.13,14 Any
single aspect of the home environment probably has limited
influence on weight-related outcomes; therefore, composite
measures should capture overall obesogenic risk most effec-
tively.Recentfindingshaveshownthatpreschoolchildrenwho
lived in higher-risk home environments, as measured by the
Home Environment Interview (HEI) (the sum of 21 food-
related, 6 physical activity-related, and 5 media-related fac-
tors), had poorer diets, engaged in less physical activity, and
watched more television than did children who lived in lower-
risk home environments.15
This study expands previous research by examining
whether the heritability of child BMI varies by the early
obesogenic home environment. It is hypothesized that the
heritability of BMI will be higher among children living in
higher-risk home environments compared with those living
in lower-risk home environments.
Methods
Sample
Gemini cohort data (a nationally representative twin study of
early growth16) were used in this study. In total, 2402 of 6754
families (36% of those with live twin births in England and
Wales during March-December 2007) gave written consent to
participate and completed a baseline questionnaire when their
children were a mean (SD) of 8.2 (2.2) months of age (range,
4–20 months). The HEI was completed by 1113 of 2402 fami-
lies (46% of the total sample) when the children were a mean
(SD) of 4.2 (0.4) years of age (range, 3–5 years). This study
sample comprised 925 twin pairs (1850 twins) with data on all
study variables. Data were analyzed from July to October 2013
and in June 2018. Ethical approval was granted by the Univer-
sity College London Committee for the Ethics of non–
National Health Service Human Research. Data were deiden-
tified.
Measures
Zygosity
Opposite-sex twins were classified as dizygotic (DZ). Parents
of same-sex twins were asked to complete a previously vali-
dated 20-item zygosity questionnaire,17 which assesses the
twins’physical likeness, blood type, how easily friends and
familymemberscantellthetwinsapart,andparentsandhealth
professionals’opinions about the twins’zygosity. The ques-
tionnaireshowed100%agreementwithDNAsamplesof81ran-
domly selected Gemini twin pairs (43 monozygotic [MZ] twins
and 38 DZ twins) at 29 months of age.18
Body Mass Index
Electronic weighing scales and height charts were sent to all
families when the twins were 2 years of age to collect parent-
reported measurements every 3 months. Parents also pro-
vided their twins’heights and weights at the time of the HEI.
The BMI SD scores, adjusted for age and sex, were calculated
using British 1990 growth reference data19 and the LMS growth
macro for Excel (Microsoft Corporation).
Home Environment
Primary caregivers (1102 of 1113 caregivers [99%] were moth-
ers) completed the HEI by telephone when their twins were 4
Key Points
Question Is the heritability of body mass index higher among
children who live in more obesogenic home environments?
Findings In this cohort study of 925 twin pairs, the heritability of
body mass index at 4 years for those living in higher-risk
obesogenic home environments was 86% and more than double
that for those living in lower-risk obesogenic home environments
(39%).
Meaning These results suggest that obesity-related genes are
more strongly associated with body mass index in more
obesogenic home environments, and that genetic predisposition
to obesity could be buffered by the early home environment.

 years of age. The HEI is a comprehensive home environment
measure assessing food, physical activity, and media-related
influences.15
As described elsewhere,15 the level of obesogenic risk was
determined by creating composite scores, guided by feed-
back from an international panel of 30 experts in pediatric obe-
sity. A total of 32 constructs were included in the composites
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). Constructs associated with lower
riskofexcessiveweightgainwerereverse-scoredsothathigher
total scores would reflect higher obesogenic risk. Each vari-
able was standardized using z scores and summed to create
composite scores for the home food environment (21 vari-
ables), the home activity environment (6 variables), and the
home media environment (5 variables). There were few cases
with missing data on home environment variables; these were
recoded to 0 (the mean value for each standardized variable).
The 3 composites were summed to create an overall home en-
vironment composite, dividing by the number of variables per
compositesothateachdomaincontributedequallytotheover-
all score (food composite/21 + activity composite/6 + media
composite/5).
Test-retest reliability of the home environment compos-
ites from 7 to 19 days (mean [SD], 9.6 [3.4] days) was accept-
able to high. The intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.71
(95% CI, 0.52–0.83) for food, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72–0.91) for ac-
tivity, 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85–0.95) for media, and 0.92 (95% CI,
0.86–0.96) overall.
An overview of the measurement points is given in eTable
2 in the Supplement.
Statistical Analyses
Heritability Analyses
Genetic and environmental contributions to variation in a trait
can be estimated by comparing similarity between MZ twins
(who share 100% of their genes) with that between DZ twins
(who share approximately 50% of their genes). Comparing MZ
and DZ correlations enables variation in a trait to be decom-
posed into 3 latent factors (the ACE model): additive genetic
effects (ie, heritability) (A); shared environmental influence
(shared experiences that make twins within a pair similar) (C);
and nonshared environmental influence (experiences unique
to an individual that make twins within a pair different) (E),
which also includes random measurement error.20
Two methods were used to estimate the heritability of BMI
at 4 years of age: twin correlations and maximum likelihood
structural equation modeling (MLSEM).21 For each method,
4-yearBMISDscorewasresidualizedforageatBMImeasurement
and sex effects using linear regression.22 The analyses were re-
peated using BMI SD scores additionally residualized for gesta-
tional age, which is also exactly correlated within twin pairs.
Heritability estimates for 4-year BMI SD scores were cal-
culated for the total sample and for home environment groups
dichotomizedonthemean(0):lower(≤0)andhigher(>0)over-
all risk, food, activity, and media home environments.
Twin Correlations
Intraclass correlations were calculated for each zygosity (MZ
andDZ)andforeachzygositybyeachhomeenvironmentgroup
(eg, MZs living in a home environment with higher overall risk)
in R23 using the structural equation modeling software
OpenMx, version 2.2.6.24
Model Fitting
Univariate twin models were created in R23 using the struc-
tural equation modeling software OpenMx, version 2.2.624 to
producereliableparameterestimatesforthewholesamplewith
95% CIs and goodness-of-fit statistics. A heterogeneity model
was used to test for differences in the magnitude of A, C, and
E between the lower-risk and higher-risk home environment
groups (eFigure in the Supplement). A, C, and E were esti-
mated using the covariance between twins. Because MZs share
100% of their genes and DZs share approximately 50% of their
genes, the genetic correlations within MZ and DZ pairs were
fixed at 1.0 and 0.5, respectively. Because it is assumed that
shared environmental influences are equal for MZ and DZ
twins, the shared environmental correlation was fixed at 1.0
for both zygosities.
A common effects model was fitted to compare param-
eter estimates in lower-risk and higher-risk home environ-
ment groups. This model allows the magnitude of variance
explained by A, C, and E to differ between groups. The fit of
more constrained nested models was then compared with the
original model using likelihood ratio tests. A significant dif-
ference between the negative log-likelihood of the nested
model and that of the original model indicates a deteriora-
tion in model fit.25,26 The 2 nested models in this study were
the scalar model, which allows variance differences but not
quantitative differences between groups, and the null model,
which constrains all parameters to be the same across the 2
groups. If the scalar or null models show a better fit than the
common effects model, there are no quantitative differences
in parameter estimates between groups.25,26 Statistical sig-
nificance was set at .05, and P values were 1-sided.
Results
Sample Characteristics
Of the total HEI sample (1113 families; 2226 twins), 12 twin-
pairs had unknown zygosity, and 174 first-born twins and 177
second-born twins had missing data for 4-year BMI. This left
a sample of 925 twin pairs (1850 twins; 915 [49.5%] male and
935 [50.5%] female; mean [SD] age, 4.1 [0.4] years). There were
no significant differences between the study sample and the
total HEI sample with respect to the study variables (eTable 3
in the Supplement).
Three hundred fourteen of 925 twin pairs (34%) were MZ.
There were slightly more twin pairs living in lower-risk home
environments than higher-risk homes (508 [56%] vs 417
[46%]). Mean (SD) 4-year BMI SD score was below that of the
reference population (first-born twins: −0.01 [1.03]; second-
born twins: −0.10 [1.03]). The ranges for the home environ-
ment composites (standardized scores) showed that there was
substantial variation (overall, −2.44 to 4.02; food, −19.24 to
25.24; activity, −4.93 to 16.15; media, −7.00 to 18.12). Sample

risk home environments had significantly higher risk scores
for each of the food (t838 = −19.35; P < .001), physical activity

educated mothers (χ2
2 = 31.57) and families with professional
occupations(χ2
2 = 26.70)wassignificantlysmalleramongthose
living in higher-risk home environments (P < .001).
Twin Correlations
The intraclass correlation coefficients for 4-year BMI SD score
(adjusted for age and sex) by zygosity and home environ-
ment groups are shown in Table 2. Correlations were higher
between MZ than DZ twins (ranges, 0.78-0.87 vs 0.37-0.54),
indicating additive genetic variation in BMI. The size of the dif-
ference between MZ and DZ twins varied by the level of home
environment risk, with greater differences in higher-risk than
lower-riskhomeenvironments(overall,0.46vs0.27;food,0.43
vs 0.28; activity, 0.46 vs 0.27), although the difference was
smaller between higher-risk and lower-risk media environ-
ments (0.39 vs 0.32). The results were the same when addi-
tionally adjusting 4-year BMI SD score for gestational age.

Discussion
This is the first study, to our knowledge, to test behavioral sus-
ceptibility theory’
s hypothesis that the heritability of BMI will
be higher among children who live in more obesogenic home
environments. As hypothesized, heritability of BMI was higher
among children living in overall higher-risk home environ-
ments compared with those living in lower-risk home envi-
ronments. The modeling indicated that none of the variance
in BMI was attributable to shared environmental factors in the
higher-risk group. In contrast, a similar proportion of the vari-
ance in BMI was attributable to shared environmental factors
and additive genetic factors in the lower-risk group. The find-
ings were similar when examining the heritability of BMI in the
separate food and physical activity environment domains.
For the total sample, 62% (95% CI, 49%-75%) of the vari-
ance in 4-year BMI SD score was attributable to additive ge-
netic factors, 18% (95% CI, 5%-29%) to shared environmental
factors, and 20% (95% CI, 17%-24%) to nonshared environ-
mental factors. These estimates largely concur with previous
studies of 4-year-old children.27 The heritability of BMI in-
creasesthroughoutchildhood,27-29perhapsasindividualsseek
out environments in line with their genotype and allow it to
be expressed freely (active gene-environment correlation)30
or because gene expression changes developmentally.31
This study builds on earlier findings that the heritability
of BMI is higher in populations with higher average BMIs, with
higher levels of gross domestic product, and with lower so-
cioeconomic status.2 Examining the role of proximal environ-

kilograms divided by height in meters
squared); NA, not applicable.
a The BMI SD scores modeled were
residuals adjusted for age at BMI
measurement and sex. Presented
models include all children with
valid data for age, sex, Home
Environment Interview score, and
4-year BMI SD score. An additional 7
cases in which just 1 twin within the
pair had available BMI data were
included in the maximum-likelihood
structural equation modeling,
performed with OpenMx software,
version 2.2.6.
bStatistical analyses: standard ACE
model-fitting analyses for
continuous data were used to
model BMI SD score at 4 years of
age.
c Includes measurement error.
dP values were based on the
likelihood ratio test and AIC.
A better-fitting submodel showed a
change in χ2 that did not represent a
significant worsening of fit
designated by the P value.

their potential association with neurobiological pathways that

Physical activity suppresses the effect of obesity-related genes
on BMI, perhaps also via appetitive and reward-related
pathways.46,47Futureresearchshoulddirectlyexaminewhether
thehomeenvironmentmoderatesgeneticinfluenceonBMIusing
a genetic risk score, because BMI is a highly polygenic trait.48,49
Althoughtherewerelargeobservabledifferencesinparam-
eterestimateswhencomparinghigher-riskandlower-riskhome
physicalactivityenvironments(80%vs49%forvarianceattrib-
utabletoadditivegeneticfactors),themodel-fittingindicatedthat
the 2 groups could be combined, with no significant worsening
of fit. Significant differences may emerge in larger, higher pow-
eredsamplesandinmoreextremehomephysicalactivityenvi-
ronments, because there was a skew toward lower risk in this
sample.50,51 Of note, although the common effects model pro-
videdthebestfitforthehomemediaenvironmentdata,thedif-
ferencesinparameterestimateswhencomparinghigher-riskand
lower-riskgroupsweresubstantiallysmallerthanthoseobserved
for the overall environment and food domain (65% vs 60% for
variance attributable to additive genetic factors). There was no
difference in the proportion of variance in BMI attributable to
shared environmental factors across the higher-risk and lower-
riskgroups(17%vs18%).Itisthereforequestionablethatthedif-
ferences observed for the home media environment are mean-
ingful. It is possible that gene-environment effects of the
home media environment are stronger in more extreme
environments50,51andlaterindevelopment,whenmediainflu-
ences are more prominent.52 Research should further examine
gene-environmenteffectsoftheseparatefood,physicalactivity,
andmediadomainsinlargerandmorediversesamplestoclarify
their relative contributions.
Limitations
Although the findings suggest gene-environment interac-
tion, they may be partly explained by gene-environment
correlation.30,53 For example, a child may be born into a home
environment that is correlated with their genotype (passive
gene-environment correlation), and some aspects of the home
environment, such as parental feeding practices, may be re-
sponsive to the child’
s genotype (reactive gene-environment
correlation). Models have been developed to take into ac-
count gene-environment correlation effects,54 but larger
sample sizes are needed than that available in this study.
There are also some limitations of the twin method, which
may lead to overestimation of heritability estimates. The as-
sumption of equal shared environments among DZ and MZ
twins has been challenged by individuals who believe that MZ
twins experience environments that are more similar than
those experienced by DZ twins.55,56 There is also evidence that
theprenatalenvironmentmaymakeMZtwinslesssimilarthan
the twin method assumes.57 However, studying twins reared
apartovercomestheequalenvironmentsassumption,andprin-
cipalfindingsmatchthosereportedintwinmodelingstudies.58
Twins are less representative of the general population than
singletons in several ways, including their growth59; how-
ever, there is no evidence that growth patterns differ be-
tween MZ and DZ twins, which would compromise findings
from twin studies.
Although it is not clear whether or how gene-environ-
ment interaction would vary by race/ethnicity, some re-
search suggests that heritability of BMI is higher among white
adolescents than East Asian adolescents.60 It would there-
fore be informative to replicate our findings in an ethnically
diverse sample. Finally, as in other cohort studies, heritabil-
ity estimates were derived from parent reports of height and
weight. However, research supports the validity of parent-
reportedBMI,especiallywhenthemeasuresaretakenathome,
as in this study.61
Conclusions
This is the first study, to our knowledge, to examine whether
the heritability of child BMI varies by the extent to which the
early home environment is obesogenic. Heritability of BMI
was higher in higher-risk home environments, which sup-
ports the theory that obesity-related genes are more strongly
associated with BMI in more obesogenic environments and
suggests pathways through which macro-level factors, such
as socioeconomic status, are associated with obesity. These
findings provide further insight into the mechanisms under-
lying overweight and obesity and how they may be pre-
vented.
