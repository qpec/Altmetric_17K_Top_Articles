Global, regional, and national age-sex specific mortality for 
264 causes of death, 1980–2016: a systematic analysis for 
the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016
GBD 2016 Causes of Death Collaborators*
Summary
Background Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can 
address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a 
comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This 
assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where 
local patterns deviate from these trends.
Methods We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were 
calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause 
of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; 
national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys 
and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported 
on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major 
garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, 
we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We 
used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for 
each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in 
relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per 
capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, 
we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016.
Findings The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), 
while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal 
autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72·3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71·2–73·2) of deaths in 2016 
with 19·3% (18·5–20·4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional 
(CMNN) diseases and a further 8·43% (8·00–8·67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs 
decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised 
rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006–16—age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries 
decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower 
respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and 
trauma, combined resulting in 1·80 million deaths (95% UI 1·59 million to 1·89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a 
profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176–181) increase in deaths in ages 90–94 years 
and a 210% (208–212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL 
significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2·89%); the median 
annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1·59%) during the same interval. Globally, the 
five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other 
common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV
/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of 
disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, 
cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth 
complications, HIV
/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia 
and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for 
women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI 
alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from 
HIV
/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within 
Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The 
level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs 
for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in 
both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe.

Introduction
Tracking age-sex-specific death rates by cause is an 
essential component of health surveillance. Recent health 
challenges such as the emergence of Zika and Ebola 
viruses, or the ongoing challenges of interpersonal 
violence, conflict, drug deaths, and natural disasters, affect 
health-system decision making.1,2 Rapid progress to 
reduce mortality is possible for some causes, as evidenced 
by previously documented declines in central Europe for 
cardiovascular disease death rates or decreasing mortality 
from malaria in eastern sub-Saharan Africa.3 Trends in 
cause-specific mortality can inform decision makers about 
Interpretation The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and 
nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their 
SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs 
have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes 
such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from 
conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing 
costs to health systems.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
This paper builds on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 
(GBD 2015). GBD 2015 provided estimates on 249 causes of 
death for 195 countries and territories, including subnational 
assessments for 11 countries from 1980 to 2015. GBD 2015 also 
provided analyses of causes of death in relation to the 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI)—a measure of per capita income, 
education, and total fertility. In addition, periodically updated 
estimates of causes of death are produced by WHO for a broad 
list of causes for all age groups, for cancers by the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer, and for child causes by the 
Maternal and Child Epidemiology Estimation group. Many 
groups also publish periodically on specific causes for a subset of 
locations. The GBD study remains the only peer-reviewed, 
comprehensive, and annual assessment of mortality by age, sex, 
cause, and location for a long time series that complies with the 
GATHER guidelines.
Added value of this study
GBD 2016 both provides estimates for 2016 and updates the 
entire time series from 1980 produced for GBD 2015. 
This update advances the measurement of deaths and years of 
life lost (YLLs) in several ways. First, greater data availability or 
policy interest supported several causes being removed from 
broader residual categories and separately assessed in the GBD 
cause hierarchy, including multidrug and extensively 
drug-resistant tuberculosis, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, 
urogenital congenital anomalies, and self-harm by firearm. 
Second, the terminal age group in all previous GBD analyses was 
80 years and older; this age group has been separated into 
80–84 years, 85–89 years, 90–94 years, and age 95 years and 
older. Third, we added 169 country-years of vital registration 
(VR) data at the national level and 24 verbal autopsy studies. 
Fourth, the verbal autopsy (VA) data collected through the 
Sample Registration System for the period 2004–13 were shared 
by the Government of India with the Indian Council of Medical 
Research for inclusion in the GBD analysis; these data included 
detailed International Classification of Diseases codes for deaths 
in each state, stratified by urban and rural residence. Fifth, we 
included data and expanded estimation to the level of local 
government areas for England and provinces in Indonesia. Sixth, 
we analysed and report on the fraction of deaths captured by 
VR systems that are assigned to major garbage codes. Seventh, 
we created a star rating system for the overall quality of cause of 
death data for each location in each year; this system represents 
VR completeness, percentage of deaths coded to causes that 
cannot be true underlying causes of death (garbage codes), detail 
of the cause list and age groups, and time periods covered. 
Eighth, we modelled antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage for 
each location-year by CD4 count at initiation, age, and sex based 
on household survey data; this was a revision to the UNAIDS 
model assumption of ART coverage being highest among 
populations most in need. Ninth, important model 
improvements were implemented for malaria, tuberculosis, 
HIV/AIDS, and cancers. Tenth, we provide more exploration of 
the patterns of changing YLLs for SDI quintiles as assessed 
in 2016. Last, we explore the relation between rates of change 
and levels of age-standardised YLL rates.
Implications of all the available evidence
Quality and coverage of cause of death data are slowly improving, 
strengthening the basis for cause of death estimation; improved 
and sustained use and collection of data is an important 
contribution of the GBD study. Globally, age-standardised YLL 
rates have declined since 1980—particularly for communicable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases. However, 
age-standardised rates significantly increased by 2016 for some 
locations and a few causes, highlighting emerging challenges. 
Overall, global progress has generally been faster for the largest 
causes of YLLs than causes resulting in fewer YLLs, suggesting 
future shifts in the relative ranking of causes of premature 
mortality.

what programmes might be working, where progress lags 
behind, and the emergence of new or unexpected health 
challenges. The broader health agenda of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) requires expanded tracking of 
a number of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and 
injuries. Support for this expanded agenda in a world of 
complex 
health 
changes 
requires 
comprehensive, 
comparable, and timely estimates of causes of death by 
cause and by age, sex, location, and year.
Several episodic efforts to estimate global and national 
mortality from specific diseases exist, as well as more 
limited efforts to estimate mortality from a comprehensive 
set of causes.4–17 The latest assessment from the Maternal 
and Child Epidemiology Estimation (MCEE) group reports 
estimates for 15 cause groups of child death for 
194 countries for the period 2000–15,18 while the Global 
Health Estimates (GHE) programme through WHO 
recently published estimates for 176 causes of death for 
183 countries from 2000 to 2015.19 The Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) study, however, provides the only annual, 
comprehensive assessment of a detailed set of underlying 
causes disaggregated by age, sex, location, and year, 
enhancing opportunities to make comparisons across 
time and between locations.
The primary objective of this study was to estimate 
mortality for 264 causes by sex for 23 age groups in 
195 countries or territories from 1980 to 2016. This GBD 
cycle incorporates seven notable updates or changes: 
(1) new data sources released since GBD 2015; (2) data 
sources from earlier years that were published in the past 
year; (3) further disaggregation of national or subnational 
units for selected locations; (4) further disaggregation of 
residual causes into individual causes, particularly those 
of policy interest; (5) improved data-processing methods 
such as the redistribution of deaths assigned to 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes that 
cannot be underlying causes of death (garbage codes); 
(6) model improvements for synthesising different 
sources of data and filling in data gaps; and (7) novel ways 
to visualise, summarise, or analyse results, such as by 
development status. These advances stem from both 
published critiques and recommendations from the 
extensive GBD network of 2518 collaborators from 
133 countries and three territories. As with each annual 
cycle of GBD, the entire time series was re-estimated to 
ensure that all comparisons are made using a consistent 
dataset and methods; these results, therefore, supersede 
all previously published GBD cause of death estimates.
Methods
Overview
The GBD study provides a highly standardised approach to 
dealing with the multiple measurement challenges in 
cause of death assessment, including variable complete-
ness of vital registration (VR) data, levels and trends in the 
fraction of deaths assigned to garbage codes, the use of 
verbal autopsy (VA) studies in locations with incomplete 
VR, and overall data missingness. Here we provide a 
general description, organised in 12 sections; detail is 
provided in the methods appendix (appendix 1 p 288). 
Statistical code used in estimation is available through an 
online repository; analyses were done using Python 
version 2.7
.12 and 2.7
.3, Stata version 13.1, and R 
version 3.2.2. As in GBD 2015, we follow the Guidelines for 
Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting 
(GATHER) for the development and documentation of 
GBD 2016 (appendix 1 p 292).
Geographical units and time periods
The GBD geographical hierarchy includes 195 countries 
and territories grouped within 21 regions and seven GBD 
super-regions (appendix 1 p 460). For the GBD 2016 
estimation, new subnational assessments were developed 
for Indonesia by province and for England by local 
government area. In this publication, we present 
subnational estimates for all countries with a population 
greater than 200 million in 2016: Brazil, China, India, 
Indonesia, and the USA. The likelihood of substantial 
geographical heterogeneity in these large populations is 
high, requiring disaggregated assessments to be policy 
relevant. Due to space limitations, we only provide these 
subnational estimates in maps; detailed subnational 
assessments will be provided in separate publications.
Cause-specific estimation for GBD 2016 covers the 
years 1980 to 2016. For a subset of analyses in this paper, 
we focus on the past decade, from 2006 to 2016, to 
address more current policy priorities. GBD 2016 results 
for all years and by location can be explored further with 
dynamic data visualisations.
GBD cause list
For GBD, each death is attributed to a single underlying 
cause—the cause that initiated the series of events 
leading to death—in accordance with ICD principles. 
This categorical attribution of causes of death differs 
from the counterfactual approach, which calculates how 
many deaths would not have occurred in the absence of 
disease. GBD also differs from approaches involving 
excess mortality in people with disease monitored 
through cohort or other studies. Deaths in such studies 
might be assigned as the underlying cause, be causally 
related to the disease, or include deaths with confounding 
diagnoses.3
The GBD cause list is organised as a hierarchy (appendix 1 
p 477), with each level composed of causes of death that are 
mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. The GBD 
cause hierarchy, with corresponding ICD9 and ICD10 
codes, is detailed in appendix 1 (p 300). GBD Level 1 causes 
are grouped as three broad categories: communicable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases; 
NCDs; and injuries. Level 2 causes contain 21 cause groups, 
including subsets of CMNN causes, cancers, cardio 
vascular 
diseases, and types of injuries (eg, transport injuries, self-
harm, and interpersonal violence). Individual causes are

primarily recorded at Level 3 (eg, malaria, asthma, and road 
injuries), while a subset of Level 3 causes are disaggregated 
further to Level 4 causes (eg, four sub-causes within chronic 
kidney disease).
For GBD 2016, we disaggregated some Level 3 causes to 
expand the cause hierarchy used for GBD 2015 by 
18 causes of death. GBD cause list expansion was 
motivated by two main factors: inclusion of causes that 
result in substantial burden and inclusion of causes that 
are of high policy relevance. New causes for GBD 2016 
included Zika virus disease, congenital musculoskeletal 
anomalies, urogenital congenital anomalies, and digestive 
congenital anomalies. Other leukaemia was added as a 
Level 4 subcause to leukaemia rather than being estimated 
in the Level 3 residual category of other neoplasms. The 
Level 3 cause of collective violence and legal intervention 
was separated into “executions and police conflict” and 
“conflict and terrorism”. Disaggregation of existing Level 3 
causes resulted in the addition of 11 detailed causes at 
Level 4 of the cause hierarchy: drug-susceptible tubercu-
losis, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and extensively 
drug-resistant 
tuberculosis; 
drug-susceptible 
HIV–
tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant HIV–tuberculosis, and 
extensively drug-resistant HIV–tuberculosis; alcoholic 
cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and other cardiomyopathy; 
and self-harm by firearm, and self-harm by other means. 
Within each level of the hierarchy the number of 
collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive causes for 
which the GBD study estimates fatal outcomes is three at 
Level 1, 21 at Level 2, 145 at Level 3, and 212 at Level 4. For 
GBD 2016, separate estimates were developed for a total of 
264 unique causes and cause aggregates.
Sources of cause of death data
The GBD study combines multiple data types to assemble 
a comprehensive cause of death database. Sources of data 
included VR and VA data; cancer registries; surveillance 
data for maternal mortality, injuries, and child death; 
census and survey data for maternal mortality and 
injuries; and police records for interpersonal violence and 
transport injuries. Since GBD 2015, 24 new VA studies 
and 169 new country-years of VR data at the national level 
have been added. Six new surveillance country-years, 
106 new census or survey country-years, and 528 new 
cancer-registry country-years were also added. An 
important development has been the release of the Sample 
Registration System (SRS) VA data by the Government of 
India for use in GBD. This includes cause of death data 
for 455 460 deaths covered by SRS from 2004–06, 2007–09, 
and 2010–13 across all Indian states and union territories. 
For this analysis, we established 2005, 2008, and 2012 as 
midpoint years for these three periods. The SRS in India 
is operated by the Office of the Registrar General of India 
working under the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government 
of India. Using the 2001 census, 7597 geographical units, 
4433 (58·4%) of which were rural, were sampled for the 
2004–13 SRS, ultimately covering a population of 
6·7 million across all states and union territories.20 The 
inclusion of SRS for GBD 2016 offers a comprehensive 
picture of causes of death in India, particularly in rural 
areas. For a subset of causes, we used the India Medical 
Certification of Cause of Death (MCCD) data source or 
Survey of Causes of Death (SCD) data rather than SRS. 
The decision to use MCCD and SCD data in addition to 
SRS was limited to causes for which we had clear evidence 
of time trends not reflected by using the three SRS 
midpoint years alone (eg, maternal mortality). The Office 
of the Registrar General of India is not involved with the 
production of the GBD modelled estimates, and as a result 
their estimates might differ from those presented here. 
Methods for standardisation or correction of data sources 
are described in detail in appendix 1 (p 14).
Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and epidemiological 
transition analysis
The SDI was developed for GBD 2015 to provide an 
interpretable synthesis of overall development, measured 
by the geometric mean of scores on relative scales of lag-
dependent income per capita (LDI), average educational 
attainment in the population aged older than 15 years, 
and total fertility rates (TFR).3 For GBD 2016, the SDI 
was slightly revised; the correlation of the GBD 2015 and 
GBD 2016 versions of SDI is 0·977 (p<0·0001)—see 
Wang and colleagues21 for details on the changes. We 
estimated the relationship between SDI and each age-
sex-cause death rate using Gaussian process regression 
(appendix 1 p 282). These relationships were used to 
estimate deaths and YLLs expected on the basis of SDI 
alone for each age-sex-location-year.
Cause of death data standardisation and processing
Crucial steps in the standardisation of cause of death data 
include dealing with the small fraction of deaths that are 
not assigned an age or sex; deaths assigned to broad age 
groups not 5-year age groups; and various revisions of the 
ICD and national variants of the ICD. Details on the 
standardised protocols for these cases are provided in 
appendix 1 (p 9). A key step to the GBD cause of death 
database development is identifying and redistributing 
deaths assigned to ICD codes that cannot be underlying 
causes of death (eg, senility or low back pain); are 
intermediate causes of death rather than the underlying 
cause (eg, sepsis and heart failure); or lack specificity in 
coding 
(eg, 
unspecified 
cancer 
or 
unspecified 
cardiovascular disease). These so-called garbage codes are 
redistributed using the GBD method established by 
Naghavi and colleagues22 and explained in greater detail 
in appendix 1 (p 19). In brief, deaths coded in this manner 
were reassigned to likely causes of death using four 
approaches: 
proportional 
reassignment, 
regression 
models, fractional reassignment of a death assigned 
multiple causes, and redistribution based on fixed 
proportions. For each approach, garbage codes were 
redistributed by age, sex, location, and year.

Figure 1: Percent of garbage coded deaths in GBD levels 1 and 2 for all ages by country and year, 1980–2016
Cells are colour-coded by percent of data redistributed in a given country-year from garbage coding to a likely underlying cause of death. Blank white cells indicate lack of vital registration. Major 
garbage codes are causes of death that are redistributed onto Level 1 or 2 of the GBD cause hierarchy. Countries without vital registration for 1980–2016 are not listed. High percentages of vaguely 
coded deaths highlight the importance of improvements in accurate reporting of mortality data to avoid redistribution of deaths to broad level causes.

The GBD cause hierarchy allows redistribution of 
garbage codes across different levels of specificity. For 
example, the garbage code “cancer, unspecified” contains 
sufficient detail to be redistributed across all cancers (at 
Level 3 of the cause hierarchy). We distinguish four levels 
of garbage codes based on the levels of the GBD cause 
hierarchy across which they are redistributed. Major 
garbage codes are those that are redistributed across 
causes that span Levels 1 and 2 of the GBD cause hierarchy 
such as heart failure or sepsis. Figure 1 shows the 
proportion of major garbage codes in VR data by location-
year. The fraction of deaths assigned to major garbage 
codes varies widely, even across high SDI countries. 
Because of the potential for bias, data sources with 
location-years with more than 50% of deaths assigned to 
major garbage codes were excluded from the GBD 
analysis. Additional details on garbage code redistribution 
can be found in appendix 1 (p 19).
Data completeness assessment
We assessed VR completeness by location-year as part of 
the GBD 2016 all-cause mortality analysis.21 Due to the 
potential for selection bias in incomplete VR, we excluded 
VR sources that were less than 50% complete in any 
given location. We also characterised sources as non-
representative if they were estimated to be 50–70% com 
-
plete. We used completeness estimates to inform variance 
of our statistical models, with lower completeness resulting 
in higher variance. Ultimately, all included sources were 
adjusted to 100% completeness by multiplying the cause 
fraction for a given location-age-sex-year by the estimated 
all-cause mortality for that location-age-sex-year. Appendix 1

(p 291) shows VA and VR availability and completeness by 
country from 1980 to 2016.
For GBD 2016, we developed a rating system that applies 
a level of 0 to 5 stars to describe the quality of data available 
for each country over the full time series from 1980 to 2016. 
These ratings were not used to directly adjust estimates; 
instead they provide context for interpreting the overall 
reliability of cause of death estimation for a location. 
Ratings were based on the fraction of deaths “well certified” 
in each location and time period; the latter was defined by 
six 5-year intervals and a terminal interval of seven years 
from 2000 to 2016. To qualify as well certified for each 
interval, we multiplied three measures: (1) completeness 
of death registration; (2) fraction of deaths not assigned to 
major garbage codes; and (3) fraction of deaths assigned to 
detailed GBD causes. Subnational VA data were multiplied 
by 0·10 because they might differ substantially from 
national results if they were available. VA data were further 
adjusted by 0·64, or the published chance-corrected 
concordance for physician-certified VA compared with 
medical certification of death.23 The percent of data well 
certified by location is provided in table 1; additional details 
on the selection of adjustment factors are in appendix 1 
(p 31). By location and time interval, we assigned the 
following stars using bins that were arbitrarily selected but 
meant to capture a range of quality from highest to lowest: 
5 stars if percent of data well certified equaled or 
exceeded 85%; 4 stars for 65% to less than 85%; 3 stars 
for 35% to less than 65%; 2 stars for 10% to less than 35%; 
1 star for greater than 0% to less than 10%; and 0 stars 
for 0%. More detail on the calculations is provided in 
appendix 1 (p 31).
Cause of death estimation
In GBD, the vast majority of cause of death estimates are 
modelled using the Cause of Death Ensemble model 
(CODEm). Due to their unique epidemiology or known 
biases, a subset of causes of death are modelled using 
alternative estimation strategies: negative binomial 
models for relatively rare causes, incidence and case 
fatality models, subcause proportion models, and 
prevalence-based models. The estimation of HIV
/AIDS 
also requires a different modelling approach;21 and in 
previous publications.3,21,24 Due to lags in reporting, 
estimates for the most recent years rely more on the 
modelling process. Additional details on CODEm and all 
alternative estimation strategies are provided below and 
in appendix 1 (p 33 and p 35).
Major methodological changes from GBD 2015 were 
made for several models in GBD 2016: the distribution of 
antiretroviral therapies (ART) in countries with high 
HIV
/AIDS prevalence were modelled based on an 
empirical pattern derived from household studies rather 
than on the assumption that ART was allocated to those 
individuals most in need; tuberculosis was modelled for 
prevalence of disease and then for prevalence of latent

Maximum values of percent well certified within each 5-year interval, as well as a data quality rating from 0 to 5 stars and the percent well certified over the entire time series 
(1980–2016) are shown for each country. “Percent well certified” is calculated as described in appendix 1 (p 31). Values of 0 indicate no vital registration or verbal autopsy data 
with sufficient detail for the 5-year interval. Countries are given 0 to 5 stars depending on the percent well certified for the full time series (1980–2016).Classification is as 
follows: 85–100%, 5 stars; 65–84%, 4 stars; 35–64%, 3 stars; 10–34%, 2 stars; >0–9%, 1 star; 0%, 0 stars. Instances in the table that show 1 star despite all zeros in percent well 
certified are a result of very small values that round to 0 at one decimal place.

infection, which were then used as covariates for the 
CODEm model; malaria in high-endemicity Africa was 
estimated using a pixel-level geospatial model, while 
malaria outside of Africa was estimated using a new suite 
of spatiotemporal covariates in CODEm; and cancer 
mortality-to-incidence data inclusion and modelling were 
revised to better capture the likely effects of worse access 
to treatment in lower-SDI settings.
CODEm
CODEm, used for 177 causes of death for GBD 2016, is the 
GBD cause of death estimation approach in which a large 
number of model specifications are systematically tested 
in terms of functional forms and permutations of relevant 
covariates which are subsequently used to predict true 
levels for each cause of death.25,26 CODEm uses multiple 
iterations of cross-validation tests to evaluate the out-of-
sample predictive validity of model variants that met 
predetermined requirements for direction and significance 
of regression coefficients. These models were then 
combined into a weighted ensemble model, with models 
performing best on out-of-sample prediction error of both 
levels and trends weighted highest. Additional details of 
the methods used to develop these ensemble models are 
provided in appendix 1 (p 33). Independent CODEm 
models were run for each cause of death by sex, and 
separately for countries with and without extensive 
complete VR data. All data were included in models for 
countries without extensive VR coverage to enhance 
predictive validity; data from countries without extensive 
VR coverage were excluded from models for countries 
with this coverage to avoid inflation of uncertainty.
Negative binomial models
We used negative binomial models for nine causes of 
death (other intestinal infectious diseases; upper res-
piratory infections; diphtheria; varicella and herpes 
zoster; schistosomiasis; cysticercosis; cystic echino-
coccosis; ascariasis; and iodine deficiency) for which 
death counts are typically very low, or might frequently 
have zero counts in high-SDI countries.
Incidence and case fatality models
For causes in locations with insufficient data from VR or 
VA data, we used incidence and case fatality models—
also known as natural history models—separately 
estimating incidence and case fatality rates and then 
combining them to produce estimates of cause-specific 
mortality. We used incidence and case fatality models 
for 14 causes: measles; visceral leishmaniasis; African 
trypanosomiasis; yellow fever; syphilis (congenital); 
typhoid fever; paratyphoid fever; whooping cough; Zika 
virus disease; and acute hepatitis A, B, C, and E. We also 
used an incidence and case fatality model for malaria 
incidence in sub-Saharan Africa as produced by the 
Malaria Atlas Project and age-sex-specific case fatality 
rates from available data.27
Subcause proportion models
For some causes—meningitis, maternal disorders, liver 
cancer, cirrhosis, and chronic kidney disease—data other 
than VR data provide considerable additional detail (eg, 
end-stage renal disease registries), or data are reported in 
too few places to be modelled directly in the CODEm 
framework. In these cases, we first estimated the parent 
cause using CODEm and then estimated subcauses by 
each age-sex-location-year using the Bayesian meta-
regression tool DisMod-MR 2.1, developed for the GBD 
studies.21,26,28
Prevalence-based models
An increased likelihood of reporting Alzheimer’s disease 
and other dementias, Parkinson’s disease, and atrial 
fibrillation and flutter as underlying causes of death on 
death certificates has resulted in an apparent large 
increase in death rates associated with these diseases. The 
absence of a parallel increase of the same magnitude in 
reported rates of age-specific prevalence of these diseases 
supports the view that these changes are reporting 
artefacts rather than true changes in epidemiology. 
Because the redistribution algorithms used to build the 
cause of death database for previous iterations of GBD 
did not seem to adequately capture this trend in death 
certification over time for these causes, estimates for 
these three causes for GBD 2016 were derived from 
prevalence surveys and from estimates of excess mortality 
based on deaths certified in countries with the greatest 
proportion of deaths allocated to the correct underlying 
cause of death in recent years. The derivation of cause-
specific mortality rates from prevalence and excess 
mortality models was completed in DisMod-MR 2.1.
CoDCorrect algorithm for combining estimates
After generating underlying cause of death estimates and 
accompanying uncertainty, we combined these models 
into estimates that are consistent with the levels of all-
cause mortality estimated for each age-sex-year-location 
group using a cause of death correction procedure 
(CoDCorrect). Using 1000 draws from the posterior 
distribution of each cause and 1000 draws from the 
posterior distribution of the estimation of all-cause 
mortality, we used CoDCorrect to rescale the sum of 
cause-specific estimates to equal the draws from the all-
cause distribution (appendix 1 p 280). We introduced a 
change in the CoDCorrect algorithm to take into account 
that deaths from Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s 
diseases are more likely miscoded to lower respiratory 
infections, protein-energy malnutrition, other nutritional 
deficiencies, cerebrovascular disease, interstitial nephritis 
and urinary tract infections, decubitus ulcer, and pul-
monary aspiration and foreign body in airway than other 
causes (see appendix 1 p 279 for details).29–31
Fatal discontinuities occur when events such as 
military operations or terrorism, natural disasters, major 
transportation accidents, or large infectious disease out-

breaks lead to abrupt departures from expected mortality 
rates in a given location. To capture these events, we used 
VR data for locations assigned a 4-star or 5-star data 
quality rating over the period from 1980 to 2016. For 
locations with a 3-star rating or lower (122 of 195 
locations), we used the Uppsala Conflict Data Program 
for military operations and terrorism;14 the Centre for 
Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters’ International 
Emergency Disasters Database for natural disasters, 
transport accidents, fires, exposure to mechanical forces 
(eg, building collapses, explosions), and famine;32 and the 
Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network 
for cholera and meningococcal meningitis. The latter two 
infectious diseases were included as fatal discontinuities 
for GBD 2016 because CODEm smooths year-to-year 
irregularities in deaths from these causes and thus risks 
underestimating their effects. There is frequently a lag in 
reporting and data publishing for the most recent years, 
so we used supplementary data sources, including news 
reports, when gaps existed for known fatal discontinuities.
Detail on the data and analytic approaches used for fatal 
discontinuities is available in appendix 1 (p 39).
YLL computation
As for GBD 2015, we calculated the years of life lost 
(YLLs)—a measure of premature mortality—from the 
sum of each death multiplied by the standard life 
expectancy at each age. For GBD 2016, the standard life 
expectancy at birth was 86·6 years, derived from the 
lowest observed risk of death for each 5-year age group; to 
avoid problems associated with small numbers, we 
restricted this to all populations greater than 5 million 
individuals in 2016. Age-standardised mortality rates and 
YLL rates were computed using the world standard 
population developed for the GBD study,3 which is a time-
invariant standard. Details of these calculations are 
available in appendix 1 (p 281).
Uncertainty analysis
Point estimates for each quantity of interest were derived 
from the mean of the draws, while 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UIs) were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th 
percentiles. Uncertainty in the estimation is attributable 
to sample size variability within data sources, different 
availability of data by age, sex, year, or location, and cause-
specific model specifications. We determined UIs for 
components of cause-specific estimation based on 
1000 draws from the posterior distribution of cause-
specific mortality by age, sex, and location for each 
year included in the GBD 2016 analysis. In this way, 
uncertainty could be quantified and propagated into the 
final quantities of interest. Limits on computational 
resources mean we do not propagate uncertainty in the 
covariates used by cause of death models. We remain 
unable to incorporate uncertainty from garbage code 
redistribution algorithms into our final estimates. When 
measuring changes over time, the change was considered 
statistically significant if the posterior probability of an 
increase (or decrease) was at least 95%—ie, if the mortality 
rate increased (or decreased) in at least 95% of the draws. 
Future methodological improvements that allowed the 
incorporation of more sources of uncertainty could result 
in currently marginally significant results no longer being 
significant within our definition.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in the study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or the 
writing of the report. All authors had full access to the 
data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results 
Data quality rating
We applied a rating system scored with stars to describe 
the quality of data available by locations over the full time 
series from 1980 through 2016. Using this rating system, 
25 countries were assigned 5 stars, 48 countries had 
4 stars, 30 countries had 3 stars, 21 countries had 2 stars, 
and 44 countries were assigned 1 star (figure 2). While 
most countries with a 5-star time series rating were high-
SDI countries, some high-SDI countries were rated at 
4 stars, such as France, Poland, and Puerto Rico. Some 
high-middle-SDI countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and 
Israel also received data quality ratings of 4 stars. A rating 
of 0 stars was assigned to 27 countries where no VA or VR 
data were available over the period from 1980 to2016. 
Global causes of death
Cause-specific mortality estimates in each year of the GBD 
estimation period 1980–2016 by age and sex are available 
through an online results tool and through the previously 
mentioned data visualisation tool. Global estimates of total 
deaths and YLLs and age-standardised death and YLL rates 
by cause across all levels of the GBD cause hierarchy for the 
years 2006 and 2016, as well as the percentage change in 
mortality over that time period, are shown in table 2. 
Globally, CMNN causes resulted in 19·3% (95% UI 
18·5–20·4) of the total deaths in 2016 (10·6 million 
[10·1 million to 11·1 million]). NCDs accounted for 72·3% 
(95% UI 71·2–73·2) of global deaths in 2016, or 39·5 million 
deaths (38·8 million to 40·3 million), and injuries caused 
8·43% (8·00–8·67) of global deaths that year, or 4·61 million 
deaths (4·36 million to 4·77 million). Both the total number 
of deaths and age-standardised rates from CMNN causes 
decreased from 2006 to 2016; total CMNN deaths decreased 
by 23·9% (95% UI 21·6–26·1), while age-standardised 
death rates decreased by 32·3% (30·3–34·2). While total 
NCD deaths increased from 2006 to 2016, rising 16·1% 
(95% UI 14·2–18·0)—an additional 5·47 million deaths—
the global age-standardised NCD death rate decreased 
12·1% (10·6–13·4), to 614·1 deaths (603·0–625·3) per 
100 000 in 2016. Total deaths due to injuries varied 
minimally between 2006 and 2016, rising from 4·59 million

(95% UI 4·35 million to 4·71 million) to 4·61 million deaths 
(4·36 million to 4·77 million); at the same time, age-
standardised injury death rates decreased by 14·4% 
(12·0–16·5) to 64·4 deaths (60·7–66·6) per 100 000 in 2016.
Figure 3 shows the number of deaths in 1990 and 2016 
by GBD age group for the 21 GBD Level 2 causes. Total 
deaths declined in the age group intervals of 0–6 days, 
7–27 days, 28–364 days, 1–4 years, 5–9 years, 10–14 years, 
15–19 years, and 20–24 years, and increased by more than 
60% in age groups 80–84 years, 85–89 years, 90–94 years, 
and 95 years and older. Shifts at age 90 and older were the 
most substantial, with a 17·8% (95 UI 176–181) increase in 
the number of deaths in the 90–94 age group and 210% 
(208–212) in age 95 years and older, illustrating a profound 
shift toward deaths at older ages since 1990. Between 1990 
and 2016, the global number of deaths from cardiovascular 
diseases for people aged older than 70 years increased by 
53·7% (95% UI 49·3–57·8) to 11·1 million deaths 
(10·9 million to 11·4 million). Notably, deaths from 
neoplasms also increased  for older ages, rising 86·3% 
(95% UI 81·0–90·5) to 3·93 million deaths (3·85 million 
to 4·01 million) for age 70 years and older in 2016. Causes 
of deaths for those aged older than age 70 years that 
increased by more than 90% were neurological disorders; 
diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases; un-
intentional injuries; other non-communicable diseases; 
musculoskeletal disorders; and mental and substance use 
disorders. 
Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional 
diseases
Generally, communicable diseases decreased as a leading 
source of death, and much of this decrease was driven by 
reductions in large contributors to global mortality, 
including 
HIV
/AIDS, 
malaria, 
tuberculosis, 
and 
diarrhoeal diseases (table 2). Overall, HIV
/AIDS deaths 
decreased by 45·8% (95% UI 43·7–47·7) from 1·91 million 
deaths (1·81–2·00) in 2006 to 1·03 million deaths 
(987 000 to 1·08 million) in 2016. This decrease in absolute 
mortality level was accompanied by a large decrease in the 
global age-standardised HIV
/AIDS death rate, which 
dropped 52·8% (95% UI 51·0–54·4) from 29·0 deaths 
(27·6–30·3) per 100 000 in 2006 to 13·7 deaths (13·1–14·3) 
per 100 000 in 2016. HIV
/AIDS mortality peaked in 2005 
Figure 2: Classification of national time series of vital registration and verbal autopsy data, 1980–2016, on the basis of the fraction of deaths well certified and assigned to a detailed GBD cause
Only vital registration data and verbal autopsy data were considered for this metric, and a country with no data in this form received 0 stars. Verbal autopsy data were down-weighted as a whole, 
to represent lower accuracy in cause of death ascertainment, and studies which were not nationally representative were significantly down-weighted for the star rating. Stars were assigned in 
proportion to completeness, percentage of deaths assigned to major garbage codes, time series availability, age and sex coverage, and geographical coverage. GBD=Global Burden of Disease.

globally, with declining death rates probably reflecting the 
successful 
expansion 
of 
ART 
programmes 
and 
programmes focused on the prevention of mother-to-child 
transmission (PMTCT). An estimated 1·21 million deaths 
(95% UI 1·16 million to 1·27 million) were caused by 
tuberculosis in 2016, a decrease of 20·9% (17·9–24·5) 
since 2006. Among subcauses of tuberculosis, drug-
susceptible tuberculosis deaths composed the largest 
portion (91·2% [95% UI 90·9–91·6]) of overall tuberculosis 
deaths; the fastest decrease from 2006 to 2016 occurred for 
deaths from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (28·9% 
[21·5–35·6]). Both total deaths and age-standardised death 
rates from diarrhoeal diseases fell between 2006 and 2016; 
total deaths decreased by 24·2% (95% UI 14·2–32·2) from 
2·18 million deaths (1·72 million to 3·01 million) in 2006 
to 1·66 million deaths (1·24 million to 2·37 million) in 
2016, while age-standardised rates dropped by 35·9% 
(27·2–42·4) from 39·2 deaths per 100 000 (30·1 to 55·0) in 
2006 to 25·1 deaths (18·8–36·0) per 100 000 in 2016. Other 
communicable diseases that decreased in terms of total 
deaths included malaria, measles, leishmaniasis, and 
intestinal infectious diseases, which decreased by 25·9% 
(95% 
UI 
6·13–41·4), 
72·5% 
(67·8–77·0), 
54·1% 
(49·8–57·9), and 14·7% (8·87–22·0), respectively, from 
2006 to 2016.
Progress in lowering mortality levels and rates was 
notably slower from 2006 to 2016 for some communicable 
diseases. For several causes, changes from 2006 to 2016

in global numbers of deaths were not significant: Chagas 
disease (increase of 1·42% [95% UI –4·88 to 9·49), yellow 
fever (decrease of 11·8% [–25·9 to 6·44]), and other 
neglected tropical diseases (NTD; an increase of 3·06% 
[–23·2 to 34·3]). Dengue was the only NTD with a 
significant increase in cause-specific mortality, with an 
81·8% (95% UI 42·3–132·6) increase in total deaths, 
from 20 800 deaths (6000–26 500) in 2006 to 37 800 
(10 900–52 700) deaths in 2016, while age-standardised 
rates increased from 0·3 deaths per 100 000 (0·01–0·4) in 
2006 to 0·5 (0·2–0·7) deaths per 100 000 in 2016. The 
global number of deaths from Zika virus disease—newly 
estimated for GBD 2016— was two deaths (95% UI 1–5) 
in 2015 and 19 deaths (4–57) in 2016.
All maternal and neonatal causes of death decreased 
globally in terms of both total deaths and age-standardised 
death rates between 2006 and 2016. The largest decrease in 
deaths from maternal disorders were for other maternal 
disorders (35 300 deaths [95% UI 26 800–45 200] in 2016), 
maternal 
sepsis 
and 
other 
maternal 
infections 
(19 500 deaths [14 300–26 200] in 2016), and maternal 
haemorrhage (72 400 deaths [58 500–89 100] in 2016), which 
represented decreases of 27·4% (19·2–34·8), 26·7% 
(17·5–35·6), and 23·8% (15·2–31·6), respectively, from 
2006. Total deaths from maternal disorders decreased by 
23·6% (95% UI 16·7–29·3), while age-standardised death 
rates across maternal disorders decreased by 30·5% 
(24·2–35·7) to 3·0 (2·8–3·3) per 100 000 in 2016. Neonatal 
disorders decreased by 25·3% (95% UI 21·3–29·3) for 
total deaths, declining from 2·32 million deaths 
(2·24 million to 2·42 million) in 2006 to 1·73 million

(21·0–29·0) for age-standardised death rates (33·6 deaths 
[32·4–35·1] per 100 000 in 2006 to 25·2 deaths [23·9–26·5] 
per 100 000 in 2016). The largest decrease for neonatal 
disorders was for haemolytic disease and other neonatal 
jaundice, which caused 36 900 fewer deaths in 2016 than in 
2006 (a reduction of 42·8% [95% UI 34·4–50·7]).
Deaths from nutritional deficiencies constituted 3·49% 
(95% UI 3·31–3·79) of total deaths due to CMNN causes, 
resulting in 368 100 (334 000–422 700) in 2016. Protein-
energy malnutrition caused the largest number of deaths 
for nutritional deficiencies with 308 000 deaths (95% UI 
277 000–356 000) in 2016, followed by other nutritional 
deficiencies, which caused 54 500 deaths (46 000–65 000). 
Progress toward reducing mortality rates associated with 
nutritional deficiencies was similar to maternal and 
neonatal disorders: age-standardised mortality rates for all 
nutritional deficiencies decreased by 23·7% (95% UI 
15·4–30·8) from 7·26 deaths (6·75–7·86) per 100 000 in 
2006 to 5·54 deaths (5·04–6·34) per 100 000 in 2016.
Non-communicable diseases
For NCDs in 2016, the largest number of deaths at Level 2 
were caused by cardiovascular diseases (17·6 million 
deaths [95% UI 17·3 million to 18·1 million]) followed 
by neoplasms (8·93 million deaths [8·75 million to 
9·09 
million]), 
and 
chronic 
respiratory 
diseases 
(3·54 million deaths [3·40 million to 3·74 million]; table 2). 
Globally, deaths from cardiovascular disease increased by 
14·5% (95% UI 12·1–17·1) between 2006 and 2016, though 
age-standardised death rates from cardiovascular disease 
decreased by 14·5% (12·5–16·2) over this same time 
period. Ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular 
disease (stroke) combined accounted for more than 85·1% 
of all cardiovascular disease deaths in 2016. Total deaths 
from ischaemic heart disease rose by 19·0% (16·2–22·1), 
increasing from 7·96 million deaths (7·81 million to 
8·12 million) in 2006 to 9·48 million deaths (9·23 million 
to 9·76 million) in 2016, which largely accounts for the 
overall increase in total deaths from cardiovascular 
diseases. Declines in age-standardised cardiovascular 
disease mortality rates were primarily driven by declines in 
cerebrovascular disease death rates, which decreased 
21·0% (95% UI 19·0–22·9) between 2006 and 2016, from 
an age-standardised death rate of 110 deaths per 100 000 
(106–113) in 2006 to 86·5 deaths (83·3–89·9) per 100 000 in 
2016. The absolute number of deaths and the total YLLs 
from diabetes both increased between 2006 and 2016 by 
31·1% (95% UI 28·9–33·4) and 25·3% (23·2–27·7), 
respectively, while age-standardised YLL rates decreased 
2·12% (0·29–3·81) over the same time period.
Deaths from neoplasms increased globally by 17·8% 
(95% UI 15·8–19·9), rising from 7·58 million deaths (7·46 
million to 7·67 million) in 2006 to 8·93 million deaths 
(8·75 million to 9·09 million) in 2016. Over  the same time 
period, the overall age-standardised neoplasm death rate 
fell by 9·38% (7·78–10·8) from 147·7 deaths per 100 000 
(145·4 to 149·5) in 2006 to 133·9 deaths (131·3–136·3) per 
100 000 in 2016. From 2006 to 2016, increases of greater 
than 30% occurred for several neoplasms that were large 
causes of deaths (greater than 200 000 in 2016): prostate 
cancer (30·8% [95% UI 24·5–36·6], to 381 000 deaths 
[321 000–413 000]); pan 
creatic cancer (30·2% [26·2–33·7], 
to 405 000 deaths [394 000–416 000]); and other neoplasms 
(30·0% [24·5–33·0], to 431 000 deaths [393 000–444 000]). 
Total global deaths decreased significantly for only one 
type of neoplasm from 2006 to 2016: Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(decreased 6·24% [95% UI 3·07–9·75]). Age-standardised 
death rates fell across most neoplasms, most notably for 
stomach cancer (decrease of 22·5% [95% UI 20·7–24·5], 
to 12·6 deaths [12·3–12·9] per 100 000 in 2016) and 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (decrease of 22·4% [19·9–25·3], to 
0·4 deaths [0·4–0·5] per 100 000 in 2016). Both lung cancer 
and breast cancer deaths increased from 2006 to 2016, 
from 1·44 million deaths (95% UI 1·42 million to 
1·47 million) to 1·71 million deaths (1·66 million to 
1·75 million) for lung cancer and from 466 000 deaths 
(451 000–486 000) to 546 000 deaths (517 000–582 000) for 
breast cancer, but age-standardised mortality rates for 
these causes decreased by 9·31% (6·9–11·8) and 9·92% 
(4·87–15·4), respectively, over the same time period. 
Chronic respiratory diseases contributed 8·96% of 
NCD deaths in 2016, with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) leading to the most deaths from these 
conditions (2·93 million deaths [95% UI 2·82 million to 
3·12 million]). Since 2006, age-standardised death rates 
from COPD significantly decreased (21·1% [18·2–23·3]), 
to 46·8 deaths (45·0–49·8) per 100 000. Age standardised 
rates for asthma also decreased (24·3% [19·1–30·3] to 
6·29 deaths [5·08–7·77] per 100 000), but increased, 
although not significantly, for interstitial lung disease and 
pulmonary sarcoidosis (5·85% [–4·31 to 13·9], to 2·0 
deaths [1·42–2·31] per 100 000). Among NCD causes 
included in the expansion of the GBD cause hierarchy for 
GBD 2016, age-standardised death rates fell globally 
between 2006 and 2016 for alcoholic cardiomyopathy, 
digestive 
congenital 
anomalies, 
and 
congenital 
musculoskeletal and limb anomalies, by 24·0% (95% UI 
7·52–36·8), 19·0% (3·73–31·3), and 18·2% (1·11–31·4), 
respectively, while rates did not change significantly on a 
global scale for amphetamine use disorders, opioid use 
disorders, or other drug use disorders over that time 
period.
Injuries
Although global age-standardised death rates fell across all 
injuries by 14·4% (95% UI 12·0–16·5) from 75·3 deaths 
(71·0–77·3) per 100 000 in 2006 to 64·4 deaths (60·7–66·6) 
per 100 000 in 2016, total injury deaths were largely 
unchanged from levels in 2006 (table 2). Unintentional 
injuries accounted for the most injury deaths in 2016, 
with 1·80 million deaths (95% UI 1·59 million to 
1·89 million) composed mainly of deaths from falls 
(678 000 deaths [559 000–719 000]), drowning (302 000 deaths 
[273 000–322 000]), and exposure to mechanical forces

(155 000 deaths [124 000–165 000]). Age-standardised rates 
for unintentional injuries overall decreased 16·1% 
(13·6–18·6) from 2006 to 2016 from 31·4 deaths (27·6–32·7) 
per 100 000 to 26·3 deaths (23·1–27·6) per 100 000. In 
terms of number of deaths in 2016, unintentional injuries 
were followed by transport injuries (1·44 million deaths 
[95% UI 1·40 million to 1·49 million]), and self-harm and 
interpersonal violence (1·21 million deaths [1·11 million to 
1·29 million]). Deaths from physical violence by firearm 
were the largest portion (41·2%) of overall interpersonal 
violence in 2016; globally, age-standardised rates for deaths 
and for YLLs of physical violence by firearm decreased 
from 2006 to 2016 by 5·34% (95% UI 0·80–9·52) and 
5·19% (0·51–9·71), respectively. Self-harm by firearm 
constituted 8·26% of global deaths from self-harm; age-
standardised rates of both deaths and YLLs from self-harm 
by firearm decreased from 2006 to 2016 by 11·6% (95% UI 
3·96–17·0) and 12·6% (3·87–18·4), respectively. The largest 
decreases in injury deaths from 2006 to 2016 occurred for 
exposure to forces of nature (49·2% [95% UI 35·2–63·2], 
to 7060 deaths [4220–10 100]) and drowning (19·0% 
[13·3–22·2], to 303 000 deaths [273 000–322 000]), while the 
largest increase was for conflict and terrorism at 143·3% 
(42·6–370·6), from 61
,900 deaths (33 
,100 to 91 
,000) deaths to 
150 000 deaths [101 400–202 700]). 
Large, abrupt changes in mortality levels can result 
from a number of causes and these stochastic events are 
separately modelled as fatal discontinuities in the GBD 
study due to their departure from typically observed 
demographic or epidemiological trends (figure 4). From 
1980 to 1988, conflict and terrorism resulted in 
2·28 million deaths (95% UI 1·55 million to 3·11 million) 
worldwide (figure 4A). In 1994, deaths in Rwanda 
(504 000 deaths [95% UI 180 000– 826 000]) dominated 
the highest single-year death toll from conflict and 
terrorism worldwide. The recent increase in global 
deaths from conflict and terrorism (2011–16) was 
dominated by mortality in North Africa and the

Number of deaths due to fatal discontinuities are presented by region for each of the shock cause groups. Results are shown every year from 1980 to 2016; regions are colour-coded by super-region. 
Regions for which data were unavailable for specific causes are not presented. Specific events that cause a disproportionate number of deaths are identified. Conflict and terrorism includes military 
operations, civil conflicts, and terrorist attacks. Epidemics include outbreaks of cholera, meningococcal meningitis, and Ebola virus disease. Famine includes deaths due to protein-energy malnutrition. 
Natural disasters include exposure to forces of nature. Other injuries includes other transport injuries, fire, heat, and hot substances, poisonings, and other exposure to mechanical forces.

Middle East which ranged from a low of 77·2% (95% UI 
63·0–83·9) in 2014 to a high of 90·9% (85·8–94·3) in 
2016 of global conflict and terrorism deaths during this 
time period. Epidemic-prone infectious diseases also 
resulted in fatal discontinuities from 1980 to 2016 
(figure 4B) with peak years in 1991, 1996, and 2014 
dominated by mortality from infectious disease outbreaks 
in 
western 
sub-Saharan

Protein-energy 
malnutrition resulted in 1·22 million (95% UI 670 000 to 
1·81 million) deaths globally from 1980 to 2016 
(figure 4C), a total that is largely composed of mortality in 
eastern sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa and the 
Middle East during the 1980s, and in countries in ast Asia 
from 1995 through 2002.
Natural disasters—categorised as exposure to forces 
of nature—were large contributors to fatal discon-
tinuities between 1980 and 2016 (figure 4D). Generally

discontinuities from other injuries were more evenly 
distributed between regions, and total mortality in each 
year represents the accumulation of many smaller 
events relative to other forms of fatal discontinuity 
(figure 4E). Additional details on fatal discontinuities by 
location can be found in the additional supplemental

Causes of child death
Table 3 shows the major causes of under-5 deaths within 
each Level 1 cause grouping for 2006 and 2016 in addition 
to the median percent change over that time period. In 
2016 there were 5·00 million deaths (95% UI 4·78 million 
to 5·23 million) in children under 5, a decrease of 33·0% 
(29·7–36·2) from 2006, when 7·46 million (7·27 million to 
7·66 million) children died. Deaths in neonates (0–27 days 
of age) composed the largest proportion, 43·3% (95% UI 
42·7–43·8), of total under-5 deaths in 2016. Deaths in this 
group decreased by 28·9% (95% UI 25·5–32·1) from 
2006 to 2016, from 3·04 million (2·97 million to 
3·12 million) to 2·16 million (2·06 million to 2·27 million); 
these decreases occurred across all mortality sources, 
although differences were not significant for neonatal 
sepsis and other neonatal infections. The largest percent 
change for neonates was in deaths due to tetanus, which 
decreased 67·6% (95% UI 57·9–75·3) from 46 300 deaths 
(24 000–62 100) in 2006 to 15 000 deaths (8330–20 400) in 
2016, followed by diarrhoeal diseases, which decreased 
58·3% (51·8–63·6) from 88 400 deaths (79 200–99 600) to 
36 900 deaths (32 700–41 300), then by lower respiratory 
infections, which decreased 44·5% (38·9–49·6) from 
278 000 deaths (245 000–305 000) to 154 000 deaths 
(133 000–172 000). 
Total deaths among post-neonates (aged 28–364 days) 
and children aged 1–4 years decreased between 2006 and 
2016 by 34·5% (95% UI 31·3–37·4) to 1·49 million deaths 
(1·42 million to 1·55 million) and 37·2% (33·3–40·5) to 
1·35 million deaths (1·28 million to 1·43 million), 
respectively. Among post-neonates, half of deaths in 2016 
were caused by lower respiratory infections (22·7% 
[95% UI 20·7–25·3], 338 000 deaths [306 000–377 000]), 
diarrhoeal diseases (15·5% [13·7–17·5], 231 000 deaths 
[202 000–263 000]), and malaria (11·3% [8·35–14·53], 
167 000 deaths [123 000–217 000]). Injuries contributed 
relatively more to mortality among children aged 1–4 years 
compared with children younger than 1 year, accounting 
for 160 000 deaths in 2016 [146 000–175 000]. Deaths from 
measles decreased the most from 2006 to 2016 among 
both post-neonates and children aged 1–4 years, dropping 
by 72·0% (95% UI 66·6–76·5) from 63 100 deaths (23 700 
to 140 000) to 17 700 deaths (6470–39 300) and by 72·0% 
(66·7–76·9) from 147 000 deaths (59 600 to 302 000) to 
41 300 (15 700–87 300), respectively. 
Global YLLs (by cause)
Figure 5 shows both the level of age-standardised YLL rates 
for each cause and the trend since 2006 represented as the 
annualised rate of change in the age-standardised YLL rate. 
Two causes had statistically significant, positive annualised 
rates of change in age-standardised YLL rates since 2006: 
dengue (3·8% [95% UI 1·4–6·4]); and Parkinson’s disease 
(0·25% [0·054–0·46]). Among the leading ten causes of 
YLLs, the median rate of change was a decrease of 2·89%, 
higher than the median rate of change (decrease of 1·59%) 
for causes below the leading ten for YLLs. 
Total YLLs by SDI quintile for Level 1 causes within the 
GBD cause hierarchy are shown in figure 6A. The greatest 
total burden of YLLs for CMNN causes in 2016 were in 
low and low-middle SDI, at 204 million (95% UI 
193 million to 217 million) and 259 million (246 million to 
274 million), respectively. The largest decrease in total 
YLLs from 1990 to 2016 was for CMNN causes in middle 
SDI, which decreased by 36·9% (95% UI 34·7–39·2). The 
largest increase in total YLLs was for injuries in low 
SDI 21·2% (95% UI 11·7–31·9). 
Trends in age-standardised YLL rates (figure 6B) further 
illustrate the epidemiological transition within and across 
locations by SDI quintiles. Across quintiles, the greatest 
difference between SDI quintiles in YLL age-standardised 
rates in each time period was for CMNN causes, which 
ranged from 1875·4 (95% UI 1793·1–2032·5) per 100 000 
in high SDI to 51 247·8 (48 640·9–53 887·2) per 100 000 in 
low SDI in 1980, and in 2016 from 739·0 (707·7–761·7) per 
100 000 in high SDI to 21 299·6 (20 220·9–22 549·4) per 
100 000 in low SDI. Declines in age-standardised YLL rates 
for CMNN causes over the 37 years examined ranged from 
60·6% (95% UI 58·2–64·7) for high SDI locations, 77·0% 
(73·4–79·9) for high-middle SDI, 74·1% (72·3–76·0) for 
middle SDI, 69·0% (66·9–70·9) for low-middle SDI, and 
58·5% (55·6–61·0) for low SDI.
Although not as large as the gradient between SDI 
quintiles observed for CMNN causes, age-standardised 
YLL rates for NCDs were generally higher at lower 
increments of SDI in each year examined. In all quintiles, 
age-standardised rates for NCDs have decreased; by 
contrast with trends for CMNN causes, the pace of decline 
for NCD rates was slowest in low SDI and fastest in high 
SDI. Age-standardised YLL rates due to injuries varied the 
least across quintiles and over time but were highest in the 
low-SDI quintile. The primary exception was the large 
increase in age-standardised YLL rates from injuries 
among low-SDI locations in 1994, a finding driven by 
deaths from conflict and terror in Rwanda. Reflecting the 
availability of data for causes of death, the UIs for each of 
the cause groupings are larger in the lower SDI quintiles. 
The number of communicable diseases in the leading 
30 causes of YLLs in each quintile of SDI decreased with 
increasing SDI, reflecting the ongoing epidemiological 
transition (figure 7). In 2016, the leading 30 causes of 
all-age YLLs for high-SDI locations were predominantly 
from NCDs and injuries, with one CMNN cause—lower 
respiratory infections—within the leading 30 causes 
(figure 7A). There was no change from 2006 to 2016 in 
the leading three causes of YLLs for high-SDI, 
high-middle-SDI, and middle-SDI locations, although 
age-standardised YLL rates decreased for each of these 
causes (figure 7A–C). The largest reduction in 
age-standardised YLL rates for high-SDI locations came 
from road injuries, which fell by 25·2% (95% UI 
22·5–27·6), while the largest increase was for drug use 
disorders (rising by 18·9% [13·8–23·3]). For both low-
middle-SDI and low-SDI quintiles, age-standardised

rates decreased from 2006 to 2016 for all causes ranked 
higher than the tenth leading cause (figure 7D, E) with 
the exception of ischaemic heart disease at low-middle 
SDI, for which the increase was non-significant. In low-
SDI locations, shifts in cause rankings by YLLs from 
2006 to 2016 occurred beyond the top ten causes, with 
many CMNN causes decreasing in rank, surpassed by 
NCD causes and injuries. 
Country-specific findings
In 2016, the burden of all-cause YLLs ranged from an 
age-standardised rate of 6834·9 (95% UI 6702·8–6974·3) 
per 100 000 in Japan to 80 115·5 (68 631·5–92 475·5) per 
100 000 in the Central African Republic, however, the 
causes that contributed the most YLLs varied with 
location—although regional patterns and patterns 
associated with SDI were also evident. The global shift 
toward NCDs for both sexes has been driven by the 
effects 
of 
population 
growth, 
ageing, 
and 
the 
epidemiological transition;3,25 the leading cause in each 
location provides a very high-level view of how these 
factors have affected patterns of premature mortality 
across the world. Detailed location-specific findings on 
YLLs are available online.
Leading causes of YLLs
Figure 8 maps the leading Level 3 causes of YLLs in 2016 
in 195 countries and territories by sex. Ischaemic heart 
disease was the leading cause of YLLs for men in 
113 countries and for 97 countries for women, spanning 
both high-SDI and high-middle SDI locations as well as 
many lower SDI locations, such as Kyrgyzstan. For both 
sexes, cerebrovascular disease was the leading cause of 
YLLs for many countries in Southeast and East Asia. 
Interpersonal violence was the leading cause for men in a 
corridor that runs from Central America through Tropical 
Latin America. In India, ischaemic heart disease was the 
leading cause for men and women. The leading cause of 
YLLs in China was cerebrovascular disease for both men 
and women. Across much of sub-Saharan Africa, the 
leading cause for both men and women varied between 
HIV
/AIDS, malaria, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower 
Figure 7: Leading 30 Level 3 causes of total YLLs by SDI grouping (high, A; high-middle, B; middle, C; low-middle, D; low, E) for 1990, 2006, and 2016, with percent change in number of YLLs, 
and all-age and age-standardised rates
Causes are connected by arrows between time periods; solid lines are increases and dashed lines are decreases. For the time period 1990–2006 and for 2006–16, three measures of change are shown: 
percent change in the number of YLLs, percent change in the all-age YLL rate, and percent change in the age-standardised YLL rate. Statistically significant changes are shown in bold. COPD=chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease. STDs=sexually transmitted diseases. SDI=Socio-demographic Index. YLLs=years of life lost.

respiratory infections; however, for men in the Central 
African Republic, tuberculosis was the leading cause. A 
few leading causes stand out for their departure from 
global or regional patterns; for men these included conflict 
in Syria, Yemen, and Afghanistan, and self-harm in 
Greenland and South Korea. For women, the general 
patterns were similar with the exception of a higher 
ranking for Alzheimer’s disease as compared to men, in 
France, Spain, and Japan. Also notable were the high levels 
of YLLs for women from chronic kidney disease in Mexico, 
neonatal encephalopathy in Pakistan, cerebro 
vascular 
disease in Uruguay, and neonatal preterm birth 
complications in Iraq. Maternal disorders were not the 
leading cause of YLLs in any location.
Observed YLLs compared to expected YLLs
The leading ten causes of YLLs by location and the ratio of 
the observed and expected YLLs on the basis of SDI alone 
in 2016 are detailed in figure 9. A variety of patterns emerge 
from this comparison, beginning with variation in leading 
causes by location. Globally, ischaemic heart disease and 
cerebrovascular disease were the leading causes of YLLs 
for both sexes for 123 countries in 2016, including in China 
(cerebrovascular disease [stroke]) and India (ischaemic 
heart disease). Countries where other causes ranked 
higher were primarily found in three GBD super-regions: 
sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV
/AIDS was the leading 
cause of YLLs for 16 of 46 locations; North Africa and the 
Middle East where conflict and terrorism was the leading 
cause in three of 21 locations; and Latin America and the 
Caribbean, where either interpersonal violence or lower 
respiratory infections  were the leading causes of YLLs in 
six of 32 locations. Nonetheless, ischaemic heart disease 
was common among countries of Latin America and the 
Caribbean, ranking in the leading three causes in all 
countries in the region, and lower respiratory infections 
were also commonly within the leading five causes of YLLs 
in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. For locations in the 
high-income GBD super-region, cancers, particularly the 
cause grouping of tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer, 
ranked within the leading five causes of YLLs in 32 of 
34 locations. In 2016, of the ten leading causes of YLLs 
globally, ischaemic heart disease was the cause for which 
YLLs were most often lower than expected on the basis of 
SDI alone (in 117 locations globally). This was commonly 
the case in the region of North Africa and the Middle East, 
where Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar in 
particular had observed-to-expected ratios of YLLs for 
ischaemic heart disease below 0·50. Other leading causes 
for which observed YLLs were notably lower than expected 
included neonatal preterm birth complications in many 
countries of both south Asia and southeast Asia, and 
cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. The opposite, 
where observed levels were much higher than expected on 
the basis of SDI, was most commonly noted in the case of 
HIV
/AIDS and malaria in sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes 
mellitus, especially in Oceania; and cardiomyopathy and 
myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. In 
China, a number of cancers—lung cancer, liver cancer, 
stomach cancer, and oesophageal cancer—were within the 
leading ten causes of YLLs, and each of these caused 
higher than expected levels of YLLs on the basis of SDI; 
from 1·70 times higher for lung cancer to 5·43 times 
higher for liver cancer. For India, YLLs from tuberculosis, 
diarrhoeal diseases, COPD, and the residual category of 
other neonatal causes were more than twice as high as 
expected in 2016 based on SDI alone (3·75, 2·88, 2·18, and 
2·43 times higher, respectively).
Discussion
Main findings
The quality of data available for estimating the global 
causes of death has improved; with the new rating system 
reported here, 50 countries had a higher star rating in the 
most recent period (2010–16) compared with their overall 
rating since 1980. The global transition from a pattern of 
premature mortality dominated by CMNN diseases to one 
dominated by NCDs and injuries can be seen in the 
37 years of data examined for GBD 2016. This transition 
was characterised by declining rates of CMNN diseases in 
all SDI quintiles, with faster rates of decline in lower-SDI 
quintiles. NCDs surpassed CMNN diseases in terms of 
global all-ages YLL rate in 2009 and earlier—in 1992—for 
age-standardised rates. NCD age-standardised YLL rates 
also declined for each SDI quintile from 1980 to 2016, but 
rates of decline were slowest at low SDI and fastest for 
high SDI. Injury age-standardised YLL rates declined in 
each SDI quintile, although this was punctuated by large 
increases in some years due to fatal discontinuities from 
conflict and terrorism, disasters, and epidemics. The 
impact of these fatal discontinuities was more noticeable 
in lower-SDI quintiles. While declines in age-standardised 
YLL rates are an indicator of progress, the absolute 
numbers of YLLs increased for NCDs in all but the high-
SDI quintile; these increases in absolute YLLs from NCDs 
occurred in tandem with steadily increasing life expectancy 
in most locations worldwide.21 Increasing numbers of 
YLLs and the associated higher prevalence of chronic 
diseases will drive rising needs for health service provision 
and pose substantial financial, workforce capacity, and 
man 
agerial challenges for health systems. Declining age-
standardised rates, but rising numbers of YLLs for non-
communicable diseases, such as breast cancer, oeso 
phageal 
cancer, and ischaemic stroke, are fun 
damentally driven by 
population growth and rising average population age. 
Between the three broad Level 1 cause groups, there was 
greater 
heterogeneity 
in 
rates

age-standardised YLLs for CMNN causes compared with 
non-communicable causes, while the least variation 
occurred for injuries. At a more detailed cause level, there 
is even greater heterogeneity in trends. Over the 37-year 
period analysed here, global deaths due to the HIV
/AIDS 
epidemic rose from 4224 deaths (95% UI 2842–6274) 
in 1980, peaked in 2005 at 1·91 million (1·81 million to 
2·01 million), and declined to 1·03 million (0·99 million 
to 1·08 million) in 2016. Since 2006, statistically significant 
increases in YLL rates occurred for opioid use, 
amphetamine use, and other drug use disorders in some 
locations—particularly at high-SDI. Globally, progress has 
been neither universal nor uniform. For SDI quintiles, 
and by GBD regions or locations, there was considerably 
more hetero 
geneity in trends—eg, 36 countries had 
significant increases in age-standardised YLLs across 3 or 
more of Level 3 causes.
Cross cutting themes
At the global level, significant declines from 2006 to 2016 in 
age-standardised YLL rates occurred for the leading ten 
causes by number of global YLLs. The median annualised 
rate of change for this set of leading causes of YLLs was a 
decrease of 2·89%, compared with 1·59% for the remainder 
of causes in the hierarchy. Generally, the findings suggest 
that we have observed faster rates of decline for causes with 
larger initial YLL rates. If annualised rates of decline are 
compared to levels of age-standardised YLLs in 2006 rather 
than 2016, these observations also hold true. This 
phenomenon of greater progress on average for larger 
problems33 is also seen in each SDI quintile. The 
consistency of this finding suggests that it is unlikely to be 
due to chance alone. One alternative explanation is that 
through investments in research and development, 
national and global policy, and strategic allocation of

resources, a more concerted and sustained effort has been 
made to tackle the leading causes in each location. This 
hypothesis provides an optimistic view of society’s potential 
to take on new challenges as they emerge; however, 
confirming that this is the best explanation for the pattern 
we observe is challenging. There are specific supporting 
examples such as the rise of the HIV
/AIDS epidemic in 
some countries, followed by the development and mass 
rollouts of PMTCT and ART,34 with subsequent declines in 
YLL rates. Another example is the population-change-
driven rise of malaria, followed by the emergence of drug 
resistance, then subsequent decline in malaria death rates 
traced to insecticide-treated bednet scale-up and artemisinin 
combination therapy.27 The rise and now apparent fall in 
alcohol-related mortality in countries in Eastern Europe 
might be yet another example.35–38 Further research on the 
broader drivers of these patterns that transcend the details 
of specific causes is warranted.
Since 1980, annualised rates of decline for NCDs have 
been faster for high-SDI quintiles than low-SDI 
quintiles—a sharp contrast with the rapid reductions in 
CMNN diseases achieved by lower-SDI locations. This 
trend might reflect combinations of funding priorities, 
international programmes, and social determinants of 
health and behaviours, as well as the crucial role of access 
and quality of both primary and secondary personal health-
care in preventing deaths from a number of NCDs, and 
point to where gaps persist in providing high-quality 
health services to properly address these conditions. Past 
studies show the effect of access to high-quality personal 
health care on both communicable and non-comm-
unicable diseases, highlighting the importance of 
prioritising personal health-care access and quality for all 
populations across the development spectrum.39–42 Our 
findings here correspond with a GBD 2015 analysis of 
personal health care access and quality,43 wherein absolute 
levels of and progress on NCDs amenable to personal 
health care were greater among higher-SDI locations than 
those of lower SDI. These differences are probably driven 
by myriad factors, including access to effective pre-hospital 
care, differences in primary and secondary care services; 
improved diagnosis and management of many conditions; 
availability and staffing of specialised health units and 
related equipment required for more complex disease 
management or surgery; and financing structures.42,44
International declarations and agreements for develop-
ment and health have attracted political actions at the 
highest level but have also generally focused on indicators 
related to CMNN causes. This focus is reflected in the rapid 
reductions in CMNN diseases achieved by lower-SDI 
locations over the past four decades. However, until 
the 2015 adoption of the SDGs, NCDs were not strong 
priorities in these declarations and did not receive 
equivalent levels of political commitment in many 
locations.45–47 By contrast, many high-SDI locations have 
national health priorities and policies that focus on NCDs, 
risk factors, or behavioural interventions, and have invested 
in these programmes outside of the explicit support of 
international declarations. In addition to the role of health 
care, improvements to the broader social determinants of 
health might be less developed in low-SDI locations—
eg, low-income and middle-income countries lag behind in 
implementing evidence-based tobacco control regulation.48 
Variations in age-standardised YLL rates by cause and over 
time might provide insight into how health care or other 
determinants of health evolve alongside development. We 
can further examine locations that have attained better 
health outcomes than expected on the basis of SDI to 
identify potential avenues for accelerating risk modification 
programmes, development of regulations, health-care 
access, or health-care quality in places lacking this success.
Seven SDG indicators are based on measures of cause-
specific mortality beyond the Millennium Development 
Goal agenda, specifically death rates due to natural 
disasters (SDG 1.5.1, 11.5.1, and 13.1.2); cardiovascular 
disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease 
among 30–70-year-olds (SDG 3.4.1); self-harm (SDG 3.5.1); 
road injuries (SDG 3.6.1); unintentional poisonings 
(SDG 3.9.3); interpersonal violence (SDG 16.1.1); and 
conflict (SDG 16.1.2).17 The inclusion of several high-
priority NCDs and injuries for the post-2015 agenda has 
been widely lauded, but critiques of current indicators and 
the omission of particular causes or health areas are 
comparably prevalent. Two causes—Alzheimer’s disease 
and other dementias, and chronic kidney disease, ranked 
fourth and 11th, respectively, among the leading causes of 
death globally—are increasing sources of health burden, 
particularly for low-SDI to middle-SDI locations; however, 
the SDG agenda offers at best a minimal platform for 
drawing attention to the health care and monitoring 
needs of these conditions. Globally, reductions in 
age-standardised death rates due to hepatitis C have 
largely stagnated since 2010 even though a highly effective 
cure is available—and in the USA, total deaths from 
hepatitis C have now surpassed deaths from all other 
notifiable infectious diseases,49 yet the SDGs are focused 
on tracking hepatitis B incidence (SDG 3.3.4). Several 
SDG indicator revisions and potential additions were 
recently proposed to the Inter-Agency and Expert Group 
on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators, suggesting 
that an opportunity might exist to better align the 
sustainable development agenda with the world’s most 
pressing causes of untimely death.4
The accelerated declines in cause-specific YLLs rates for 
nearly all causes is occurring despite threats to human 
health such as climate change, antimicrobial resistance, 
obesity, emerging infectious diseases, and conflict.6,50–60 
The debate over whether progress in human health can 
continue through some combination of innovation and a 
societal focus on leading problems despite the advent of 
these risks in some ways parallels an explanation for the 
well-known environmentalist’s paradox in which human 
so-called well-being has continued to improve globally 
even as resources are depleted and many ecosystems show 
 Global Health Metrics

1199
signs of degradation.53 An alternative explanation is that 
these threats have substantial time lags so that health 
consequences of climate change, for example, might be 
major in the future even if not notable to date. The 
continued global increase and expansion of dengue and its 
four serotypes is a potential indicator of the complex 
changes that are underway and might be partly related to 
changes in climate in addition to other factors.61 Other 
challenges, such as conflict and terrorism, are clearly 
causing reversals in some locations such as Syria and 
Yemen. The apparent reversal in progress in survival in 
the USA is a complex phenomenon whose causes and 
magnitude remain contested, but recent research has 
pointed to rising mortality among some groups, especially 
non-Hispanic whites, from increased deaths from drugs, 
alcohol, and suicide, coupled with slower progress in 
reducing deaths from cardiovascular disease and cancer, 
and rising levels of obesity and associated disease.57,62 These 
threats are substantial and deserving of policy attention 
and response. Given the gulf between a future driven by a 
continuation of the trends we have observed in the last 
37 years and one dominated by emerging risks, close 
monitoring of patterns in health outcomes will be 
essential. Further work to identify specific health outcomes 
in particular locations might be sentinel markers of the 
effect of these threats might also improve our capability for 
early detection of changes in trends in certain locations.
Changes in GBD 2016 compared with GBD 2015
A strength of the GBD study is the re-analysis of the 
entire time series using continually improving methods 
and newly available data sources. Estimates for a given 
cause, location, or year are not necessarily constant 
between GBD iterations as new techniques or data 
sources improve model validity and decrease uncertainty 
from various sources. The magnitude of differences in 
estimation between GBD 2016 and GBD 2015 is 
presented in the appendix (2 p 26); specific method or 
data changes underlying several notable differences in 
estimation are discussed in greater detail below.
One of the most important changes in GBD 2016 was the 
release of the SRS VA data to the India GBD collaboration 
by the Government of India. These detailed ICD code data 
were for the period 2004 to 2013, and were disaggregated by 
urban and rural areas in each state. The inclusion of the 
detailed SRS VA data in GBD 2016 substantially changed 
estimates for multiple causes. In some cases, the new SRS 
data over a 10-year period not only changed results for India 
but, through changing coefficients in regression models, 
also modified estimates for other locations that were lower 
in the stars system of data quality rankings developed for 
GBD 2016. These data are a tremendous resource and it is 
a welcome development that the data have been shared 
with the Indian Council of Medical Research, providing the 
opportunity for their inclusion in GBD. Nevertheless, these 
data are still based on VA, which in rigorous validation tests 
performs well for some causes and not others.63
An important emphasis in GBD 2016 has been reporting 
by location-year on the extent of garbage coding on death 
certificates. By introducing the concept of levels of garbage 
coding we have focused attention on those deaths assigned 
to garbage codes that get redistributed across the three large 
cause groups in GBD or the 21 Level 2 cause groups that 
have the largest effect on cause of death patterns. Reporting 
on the fraction of deaths assigned to major garbage codes 
by location-year provides a tool for national statistical 
authorities to track progress in improving the quality of 
death certification. We hope that annual reporting on this 
quantity might encourage policies and programmes to 
improve the quality of death certification. Countries such 
as Finland, Moldova, New Zealand, Singapore, and that 
have less than 5% of deaths on average since 2010 assigned 
to major garbage codes strongly imply that high-quality 
certification is possible at the national level. Even in the 
population aged older than 80 years, these countries have 
kept major garbage coding less than 20%. By contrast, 
some systems, such as those in Egypt, Thailand, and 
Turkey, have more than 50% of deaths assigned to major 
garbage categories. Given that registration systems are 
recording these deaths, which requires considerable 
institutional development and system infrastructure, 
the marginal value of intervening to improve death 
certification quality would be great. Initiatives such as the 
Bloomberg Data for Health Initiative will hopefully lead to 
improvements in cause of death certification and coding.64 
At the global level, the fraction of all registered deaths 
assigned to major garbage codes decreased over the past 
37 years, owing to ongoing improvements in data collection 
and recording. Because there is a strong relationship 
between garbage coding and age, and important 
demographic shifts are underway, reporting of garbage 
codes should perhaps in the future be age standardised.
In the interest of providing more guidance about the 
quality of the data used for estimating causes of death, we 
have introduced a scoring system for the overall quality of 
the time series estimates for a location ranging from 
5 stars (best) to 0 stars (worst). The quality rating of the 
time series has been assigned on the basis of the fraction 
of well certified deaths. In 2010–16, we reported more 
countries with 4-star or 5-star ratings. The improve 
ments 
in data quality in some large countries, such as Brazil, 
China, and India, is particularly encouraging. The goal of 
GBD is to generate unbiased estimates for all locations 
with 95% UIs that reflect sampling error, non-sampling 
error, and modelling error based on the available evidence. 
These UIs are meant to also communicate to the user the 
strength of the evidence supporting each cause-specific 
estimate. In settings with five stars, the results in future 
iterations of GBD are unlikely to change even if the model 
life tables improve or there are changes in how garbage 
codes are redistributed. Because of the weaker empirical 
basis, results for locations with lower star ratings are more 
subject to change in how data are processed or models 
estimated; however, even for locations with lower-quality 
 Global Health Metrics
1200 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 390   September 16, 2017
data, our methods support the generation of unbiased 
estimates and as such we do not expect deaths in these 
locations to be systematically higher or lower than 
estimated. For GBD 2016, we have opted to develop a 
relatively simple system and accommodated the system to 
settings where only VA studies are available. In future 
GBD updates, we might improve on this first iteration of 
the quality rating system.
Updates in the data collated and improvements to the 
methodological approach for malaria mortality estimation 
in the GBD 2016 iteration have resulted in changes in 
estimates of both contemporary mortality and trends 
through time. At the global level, estimates for malaria in 
the most recent years are slightly higher compared with 
those in GBD 2015, but earlier years were estimated to be 
lower, including the years of peak global malaria mortality 
in the early 2000s. As such, the proportional decline in 
malaria deaths between 2006 and 2015 is now estimated to 
be 27·9% (95% UI 8·71–42·8), which is smaller than the 
WHO estimated decline of 42% (33–55).7 These changes 
were driven primarily by updates to estimates for 
sub-Saharan Africa, where the slightly slower rate of 
decline since 2006 reflects the inclusion of geospatial 
predictions of new cross-sectional household surveys in 
the Malaria Atlas Project, reporting higher infection 
prevalence or lower coverage of malaria control 
interventions, both of which translate into larger mortality 
estimates. Changes to estimates in the earlier part of the 
time series reflect mainly refined covariates, including 
access to and efficacy of antimalarial drugs. Outside sub-
Saharan Africa, changes were driven mainly by (1) a 
modified mortality model that is informed by the newly 
developed Malaria Atlas Project estimates of clinical 
incidence through time for each country, which in turn 
draw upon a new assembly of routine case surveillance 
data; and (2) new adoption of notification data. These 
modifications led to different changes in different 
countries, but most notably overall declines in predicted 
malaria deaths in Myanmar and India. Changes in India 
were most pronounced and driven by inclusion of the 
much-improved SRS mortality data, which lowered 
estimates in all years, but particularly earlier years.
We changed the modelling strategy of tuberculosis in 
GBD 2016 by first modelling prevalence of disease and 
prevalence of latent infection, which were then used as 
covariates for the CODEm model. This, together with the 
addition of SRS data for India and changes to the mortality 
envelope, has not resulted in major changes to our general 
conclusions on the global epidemiology of tuberculosis, 
although the number of deaths at the global level was 
slightly higher than that of GBD 2015 for all years. The 
estimated number of deaths in several African countries 
have significantly increased; Nigeria and Zambia were 
notable with more than twice the number of estimated 
deaths in 2015. In addition, for the first time, we have 
estimated multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and extensively 
drug-resistant tuberculosis (8·8% [95% UI 7·4–10·4] of all 
tuberculosis deaths) from the global tuberculosis envelope. 
Due to the different composition of drug-resistant types, 
these numbers are lower than the 13·9% of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis deaths (multidrug-resistant and rifampicin-
resistant tuberculosis combined) among all tuberculosis 
deaths reported by WHO for the same year.6
As in previous iterations of GBD, cancer mortality was 
estimated using mortality data from VR system data and 
VA studies, as well as cancer incidence data from cancer 
registries that were transformed to mortality estimates 
using separately modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios 
(MIR). GBD 2015 estimated MIRs did not capture the 
likely effects of worse access to treatment in lower-SDI 
settings; we have revised the MIR data-inclusion and 
modelling approach to better capture the relationship 
observed in high-quality registry data between MIR (and 
implicitly 5-year survival) and health-system access and 
quality of care. The changes in MIR modelling as well as 
the changes in data led to some shifts in cancer mortality. 
For example, estimates of deaths from other pharynx 
cancers in 2010 at the global level increased by 72·3% for 
men and by 73·8% for women; most of this increase 
comes from India. Estimates for deaths from Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma in 2010 increased by 28·1% for men and 
by 16·8% for women compared with GBD 2015 at the 
global level. This difference comes mainly from an 
increase in the mortality estimates for sub-Saharan Africa, 
where the inclusion of more registry data for Nigeria, 
Uganda, and other locations changed the estimates. 
Deaths estimated from lip and oral cavity cancer in 2010 
increased by 17·0% for both sexes compared with 
GBD 2015, which again was mainly caused by a large 
increase in deaths estimated for India due to the addition 
of SRS as well as an increase in the MIR estimate. 
Compared with in GBD 2015, estimated deaths in 2010 
due to other neoplasms increased by 20·3% for men and 
by 5·1% for women. This increase was mainly due to a 
change in redistribution of myelodysplastic syndrome, 
which was redistributed to the leukaemia subcauses for 
GBD 2015, and to other neoplasms for GBD 2016.
In view of the large outbreak of Zika virus disease across 
the Americas, WHO’s declaration of the outbreak as a 
Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and 
broad concern about the disease, we added Zika virus 
disease to the GBD cause list. Although Zika virus infection 
is primarily associated with non-fatal outcomes (eg, fever, 
rash, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and congenital outcomes), 
a small number of deaths have been reported, and these are 
captured within GBD 2016. The global number of Zika 
virus deaths was comparatively small—estimated at two 
(95% UI 1–5) in 2015 and 19 (4–57) in 2016. Given trends in 
the disease, we do not expect the number of Zika virus 
disease deaths to increase substantially in the coming years.
We have explored alternative data processing and 
modelling for neonatal causes. Even in countries with 
5-star cause of death quality ratings, there is remarkable 
variation in neonatal cause of death patterns. Western 
 Global Health Metrics

Europe is an example where the overall death rate due to 
neonatal disorders in the early neonatal period is quite 
similar across the region, but there is as much as a 
three-fold difference in death rates within Level 3 causes 
(eg, neonatal preterm birth complications, cardiovascular 
diseases).65,66 There is no reason to believe that these large 
differences in the causes of deaths in the first month of life 
between countries with nearly the same SDI in the same 
GBD region are real; rather, we strongly suspect there is 
variation in medical culture in how neonatal deaths 
are assigned.
For example, in some locations all deaths in premature 
infants might be assigned to prematurity as a cause and 
not only those where inadequate development of organ 
systems is the underlying cause of death. As a concrete 
clinical example, particular locations might be predisposed 
to assign deaths following clinical events, such as 
intraventricular haemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis 
to cardio 
vascular diseases and neonatal sepsis, respectively, 
instead of preterm birth complications or congenital birth 
defects. We tested alternative modelling strategies, but 
improvements in the assignment of neonatal deaths to 
specific causes might require improvements in the 
fundamental quality of the data, reconsideration of GBD 
cause classification in these age groups, or considering 
alternative age-specific data redistribution approaches.
Comparison of GBD 2016 to other estimates
WHO has produced cause of death Global Health 
Estimates (GHE) at the country level with the most recent 
spanning from 2000 to 2015 for 183 countries and 176 
causes of death.19 These estimates combined GBD 2015 
estimates, International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC) cancer estimates, UN Population Division life 
tables, vital registration data for 70 countries, and selected 
cause-specific and country-specific adjustments. Cause-
specific comparisons of these estimates to GBD 2015 and 
GBD 2016 are provided in appendix 2 (pp 25–26). 
Uncertainty bounds for GHE 2015 cause-specific estimates 
are available from WHO online sources.19 The GBD study, 
as recognised in the GHE 2015 technical paper, remains 
the “only source of comprehensive uncertainty estimates 
for mortality by cause.”19
 The Globocan project at IARC produces estimates of 
major cancer types on a periodic basis for 184 countries; 
IARC estimates do not currently meet GATHER 
guidelines.15 We believe that the IARC estimates of MIR 
in the lower three SDI quintiles are low for a number of 
important cancers, particularly where there is clear 
evidence of the impact of access and quality of care, and 
empirical evidence of this gradient from recent analyses 
employing the Healthcare Access and Quality Index.43 
Due to the complexities of the IARC estimates, if the bias 
in their estimates from underestimated MIRs primarily 
affects their estimates of incidence or the site-specific 
mortality estimates is unclear. Given the push to 
accelerate declines in under-5 deaths, several efforts are 
underway to quantify deaths by cause in children.67 The 
MCEE, WHO, and GBD each produce estimates of child 
deaths by age and cause. WHO uses MCEE results for the 
limited causes included in that analysis and supplements 
for other child causes using the GBD 2015 results.
Limitations
GBD 2016 has made a number of advances in method 
ology 
to address the unique difficulties of estimating cause-
specific mortality; at the same time, we recognise that 
limitations remain. Limitations that reflect aspects of 
specific causes—such as inconsistencies between cause of 
death and prevalence data for select causes, complexities 
around including mental health disorders as risks for death 
for many causes, efficiency in capturing the effects of 
differential use of ART for younger age groups or by sex, 
the lack of detail available for causes such as drug use 
disorders, or the effects of mass migrations on estimation—
are described in greater detail in appendix 1 (p 39). Here, 
we identify cross-cutting limitations applicable across 
many causes. First, the newly developed data quality ratings 
by location do not incorporate the extent of redistribution 
for miscoded causes of death or other sources of error that 
might affect the accuracy of estimation based on those data. 
Second, both VR data and VA data sources depend on how 
accurately underlying cause of death is assigned and this is 
complicated by multimorbidities. Through correction for 
under-registration 
and 
garbage 
code 
redistribution 
algorithms, we have made substantial efforts to enhance 
the comparability of results; systematic problems in 
selected locations might still remain and affect the 
estimated time trends. Third, in estimating fatal 
discontinuities for countries with a 3-star data quality rating 
or lower, we primarily relied on international organisations 
that collate these data, and thus our results are subject to 
the limitations in data coverage or representativeness of 
those sources; details of adjustments for known data issues 
are in appendix (1 p 273). Fourth, in adjusting VA studies 
relative to medical certification, we rely on the single 
available study on this comparison;68 of necessity this is a 
limited basis for the adjustment. Fifth, sources of VA data 
vary substantially in terms of the training provided and the 
instrument used in collecting the data, which might reduce 
the comparability of cause of death data between locations. 
Sixth, our approach to garbage code redistribution is vital to 
the results presented in GBD 2016—although our methods 
of redistribution could theoretically contribute bias, we 
have identified no evidence of this.3 Seventh, a low level of 
identified garbage coding for a given location does not 
necessarily indicate quality or accuracy in cause of death 
certification. Eighth, while some causes use negative 
binomial modelling approaches to improve estimation 
with over-dispersed data, we have not yet developed a 
standardised empirical approach for selecting causes to use 
this method. Ninth, we have not been able to systematically 
carry uncertainty from the statistical models used for many 
of the garbage code redistribution algorithms through to 
 Global Health Metrics
1202 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 390   September 16, 2017
our final estimates due to limitations in computational 
require 
ments and storage needed; we are exploring ways 
this can be accommodated in future GBD iterations. Tenth, 
additional sources of uncertainty might not be captured, 
such as for the covariates used in the models with the 
exception of the HIV crude death rate. Finally, GBD results 
are necessarily a combination of data and esti 
mation. Due 
to lags in reporting, estimates for the most recent years rely 
more on the modelling process—evidenced by larger 
median UI by year between 2012 and 2016— as do 
estimates for locations with low levels of data completeness.
Future directions
Based on feedback from across the GBD collaboration, the 
Independent Advisory Committee to the GBD study, we 
have identified a number of areas where GBD 2017 and 
subsequent GBD updates can improve the estimation of 
causes of death. First, we would like to be able to capture 
uncertainty in garbage code assignment into the final UIs 
for our estimates. Given the computational requirements 
for CODEm, propagating uncertainty in the primary data 
used for modelling will require major changes in data 
storage and computational capacity or substantial changes 
to the CODEm model pool. Second, as spatially explicit 
analyses become available for more causes, such as 
diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, tuber-
culosis, HIV, and many NTDs, these more granular 
assessments should affect the GBD estimates. Third, the 
Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance 
study—funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation—
might provide important high-quality data on the 
underlying causes of death in a sample of deaths in low-
SDI settings based on minimally invasive tissue sampling. 
This could change our understanding of the leading 
causes of death in some groups such as neonatal sepsis. 
Fourth, we will continue the push toward more 
subnational assessments in future iterations, targeting 
the countries with the largest populations and those that 
are about to surpass the 200 million population mark.
Conclusion
Patterns of global health are clearly changing, with more 
rapid declines in CMNN conditions than for other diseases 
and injuries. This is a laudable and welcome reflection of 
the intense focus of the global health community over the 
past several decades on improving child survival and 
reducing pregnancy-related risks. The impact of the mass 
scale-up of interventions funded through development 
assistance on mortality from diseases such as HIV
/AIDS, 
malaria, and measles is best measured by comprehensive 
annual cause of death assessments as reported in this 
paper. These data also point to the much slower declines in 
mortality for major NCDs and injuries, suggesting that 
these conditions, which cause very substantial mortality in 
young and middle-aged adults, need to receive much 
greater policy priority given the compelling evidence from 
some countries that bold public policies to reduce avoidable 
mortality from these causes are effective. Moreover, it is 
much less a matter of financing such policy initiatives than 
sustained government commitment toward them that will 
ensure they have the impact that is intended. The true 
value of timely, comprehensive, and annual mortality data 
in informing policy dialogue depends greatly on their 
diagnostic accuracy and completeness; as this study 
demonstrates, the majority of countries still lack good-
quality vital registration systems to adequately support 
public policy, mandating that future global health 
development 
strategies 
include 
improvements 
for 
these systems.
