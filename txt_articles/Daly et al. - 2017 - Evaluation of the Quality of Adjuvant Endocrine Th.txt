IMPORTANCE Randomized trials in breast cancer have demonstrated the clinical benefits of
adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) in preventing recurrence and death. The examination of
concordance with AET guidelines at a national level as a measure of quality of care is
important.
OBJECTIVE To investigate temporal trends and factors related to receipt of AET for breast
cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study included 981 729
women with breast cancer in the National Cancer Database from January 1, 2004, to
December 31, 2013. Women with stages I to III breast cancer who received all or part of their
treatment at the reporting institution were included in the analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Temporal changes in AET receipt (estimating the annual
percentage change) and AET practice patterns (using logistic regression) and the effect of
AET guideline concordance on survival of women with hormone receptor–positive (HR+)
breast cancer (using the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model).
RESULTS Of the 981 729 eligible patients (mean [SD] age, 60.8 [13.3] years), 818 435 had HR+
and 163 294 had HR-negative (HR−) cancer. Among the patients with HR+ cancer, receipt of
AET increased over time, from 69.8% in 2004 to 82.4% in 2013. Among patients with HR−
cancer, receipt decreased from 5.2% in 2004 to 3.4% in 2013. Hospital-level adherence
(�80% of patients with HR+ cancer received AET) increased from 40.2% in 2004 to 69.2%
in 2013. Receipt of AET varied significantly by age (lower in patients �80 years), race (lower
in African American and Hispanic participants), geographic location (lower in West South
Central, Mountain, and Pacific census regions), and receptor status (lower in patients with
estrogen receptor–negative and progesterone receptor–positive cancer). Surgery and
radiotherapy were the factors most significantly associated with appropriate AET receipt
(only 45.0% in patients who received lumpectomy without radiotherapy). Receipt of AET was
associated with a 29% relative risk reduction in mortality. Based on this effectiveness
estimate, if all patients with HR+ cancer received AET, approximately 14 630 lives would have
been saved over 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE From 2004 to 2013, underuse and misuse of AET have
decreased for patients with breast cancer, but optimal use has not been achieved, and
significant variation in care remains. The involvement of surgery and radiotherapy were
among the most significant factors associated with optimal use, which underscores the
benefits of team-based care to support guideline-concordant therapy.

ince the 1983 publication of the landmark Nolvadex
Adjuvant Trial Organisation results, adjuvant endo-
crine therapy (AET) has been an integral treatment in
breast cancer.1,2 The Early Breast Cancer Trialists’Collabora-
tive Group (EBCTCG)3 meta-analysis showed that 5-year
results for treatment with tamoxifen citrate reduced recur-
rence by 39% and 15-year breast cancer mortality by approxi-
mately one-third in estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) dis-
ease. Aromatase inhibitors have become the standard of care
for postmenopausal women.4 An EBCTCG5 meta-analysis
found that compared with 5-year findings for tamoxifen, 5
years of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor reduced
recurrence and mortality.
Previous guidelines recommended treatment of premeno-
pausal women with hormone receptor–positive (HR+) disease
with tamoxifen for 5 years and postmenopausal women for 5
years with an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen or both in se-
quence.Basedonrecenttrials,6-9theAmericanSocietyofClini-
cal Oncology issued a 2016 guideline update10 to recommend
ovarian suppression for 5 years in combination with AET for
high-risk premenopausal women and AET alone for women
with stage I breast cancers not warranting chemotherapy and
node-negative cancers of 1.0 cm or less. Similarly, the National
Quality Forum11 (cancer measure 0220) endorsed tamoxifen or
a third-generation aromatase inhibitor (considered or admin-
istered) within 1 year of diagnosis as a marker of quality care for
patients with HR+ American Joint Committee on Cancer stage
T1cN0M0,II,orIIIdisease.Studieshavedemonstratedthateven
patients with node-negative cancers of 1.0 cm or less benefit
fromAET.12-14TheseguidelineshighlighttheimportanceofAET
in the treatment of nonmetastatic breast cancer.
Analysis of different populations has shown a range in
guideline concordance. In studies using the Surveillance, Epi-
demiology and End Results (SEER) Medicare-linked data for
2006to200715 and2006to2009,16 therateofAETusewasap-
proximately 70%. Kimmick et al17 examined North Carolina
Medicaid-linked data and found a prescription fill rate of 70%.
In the Breast Cancer Quality of Care Study (B-QUAL),18 a pro-
spective cohort study at 3 US sites, the investigators found that
12.0% to 17.9% of participants did not initiate AET. Flanagan
et al19 examined AET in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ
usingtheNationalCancerDatabase(NCDB).Theauthorsfound
that fewer than half of patients with ER+ disease received AET.
The objectives of this study were to describe the temporal
changes and AET practice patterns and to evaluate the effect
of AET guideline concordance on survival of women with HR+
breast cancer. In the context of the changing landscape of can-
cer care, an increased emphasis on tying reimbursement to
guideline-concordantcare,andrecentdata20showingsomepa-
tient populations being left behind, identification of factors as-
sociated with quality in breast cancer treatment is important.
Methods
Data Source and Study Population
The NCDB data are annually reported from about 1500
Commission on Cancer–accredited hospitals and cap-
ture approximately 70% of newly diagnosed malignant can-
cers in the United States. Aspects of the NCDB data have
been described elsewhere,21,22 and data were coded and
reported using established protocols. This study used
deidentified data and was deemed exempt from human pro-
tection oversight and informed consent by the institutional
review board of the University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.
Data from 2 032 209 patients diagnosed with breast can-
cer from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2013, were que-
ried. The study was limited to women 18 years or older with
a diagnosis of American Joint Committee on Cancer stages I
to III breast cancer who received all or part of their first
course of treatment in the reporting facility. Patients under-
going surgery but no neoadjuvant systemic treatment were
eligible. The study excluded patients with prior cancer diag-
noses. Patients with missing data for HR status or AET status
were also excluded. The type of endocrine therapy is not
specified in the NCDB. After these selections, 981 729
patients were included (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Study Variables
In the NCDB, AET recommended and administered as first-
course treatment was recorded, and the reason for nonadmin-
istration was recorded for a subset of patients. Based on HR
status, the population was divided into the following 2 groups:
those with HR+ (ER+ or progesterone receptor–positive [PR+])
cancer and those with HR negative (HR− [ER− and PR−]) can-
cer for investigating AET underuse and misuse, respectively.
Because the American Society of Clinical Oncology and
College of American Pathologists lowered the ER and PR cut-
off point positivity from 10% to 1% positive nuclei in 2010,23
10% may have been used before and 1% may have been used
after 2010. For the analysis of underuse, we calculated patient-
level and hospital-level adherence. Consistent with prior stud-
ies, adherence was benchmarked at 80%, based on the
Commission on Cancer adherence standard.24
Treatment modalities examined included surgery, radio-
therapy, and chemotherapy. Patient demographics, includ-
ing age at diagnosis, race, and insurance status, were ana-
lyzed as categorical variables. Patient comorbidity status
was represented by the adoption by Deyo et al25 of the
Charlson Comorbidity Index, which is a cumulative score of
Key Points
Question What are the patterns and factors associated with
receipt of adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer?
Findings This cohort study of 981 729 women with stages I to III
breast cancer in the National Cancer Database found that receipt
of adjuvant endocrine therapy increased from 69.8% in 2004 to
82.4% in 2013 among patients with hormone receptor–positive
cancer. Surgery and radiotherapy were the factors most
significantly associated with receipt of adjuvant endocrine
therapy.
Meaning Optimal receipt of adjuvant endocrine therapy has not
been achieved, but team-based care may support
guideline-concordant care.

 15 health conditions. Tumor characteristics, including tumor
size, lymph node involvement, grade, histologic type, and
ER and PR status, were analyzed as categorical variables.
Tumor size was also analyzed as a continuous variable using
restricted cubic spline functions, a less biased method of
modeling continuous variables. Area-based indicators of
income and educational attainment were derived at the zip
code level from 2012 US Census data and included as quar-
tiles in the general US population. Geographic region was
based on the reported residence at diagnosis. The 2013 rural-
urban continuum codes were assigned according to the
patient’
s county of residence. Facility-level characteristics
included facility type (community, comprehensive commu-
nity, and academic cancer center), annual patient volume,
and distance to the facility.26
Statistical Analysis
We examined the temporal trend of AET receipt from 2004 to
2013 and estimated the annual percentage change using a gen-
eralized linear model for binomial distribution with identity
link. Then we investigated demographic, clinical, and facility
factors that were associated with AET receipt using logistic re-
gression models. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were esti-
mated in the regression models. Given the large sample size,
P < .001 was considered statistically significant, and the χ2 sta-
tistic was reported as an indicator of significance strength.
To estimate the effectiveness of AET guideline concor-
dance on overall survival, we fit multivariable Cox propor-
tional hazards models among patients with HR+ cancer diag-
nosed from 2004 to 2012. Patients diagnosed in 2013 were
excluded because the duration of follow-up was too short.
To eliminate survivor bias, we removed survival time of the
first 8 months from diagnosis (termed landmark analysis)27
because only survivors who live long enough can receive
AET. We chose the 8-month cutoff point because approxi-
mately 80% received AET within 8 months, and most deaths
in the first 8 months are likely not related to AET. As a mea-
sure of relative benefit, we calculated hazard ratios and 95%
CIs. To facilitate clinical interpretation, we estimated mar-
ginal mortality risks from the fitted Cox proportional haz-
ards models. The marginal mortality risk can be interpreted
as the population mean risk if all patients in a specific sub-
group received or did not receive AET, while keeping all
other prognostic factor profiles unchanged. Furthermore, we
estimated the number of lives lost owing to nonadherence
with AET guidelines by applying the difference in 10-year
marginal mortality risks between AET users and nonusers to
the total number of untreated patients with invasive breast
cancer. Herein, we assumed that the NCDB captured 72.5%
of US breast cancer cases.28 All statistical analyses were con-
ducted with STATA software (version 14.0; StataCorp).
Results
AET Receipt From 2004 to 2013
Of the 981 729 eligible patients (mean [SD] age, 60.8 [13.3]
years), 818 435 had HR+ cancer and 163 294 had HR− cancer.
In the patient-level adherence analysis, the receipt of AET
amongpatientswithHR+cancerincreasedfrom69.8%in2004
to 82.4% in 2013 (Figure 1A). This change represents an an-
nual percentage change of 1.51% (95% CI, 1.48%-1.54%;
P < .001). Among patients with HR− cancer, the AET receipt
decreased from 5.2% in 2004 to 3.4% in 2013, representing an
annual percentage change of −0.17% (95% CI, −0.14% to
−0.21%; P < .001). In hospital-level adherence analysis, 40.2%
of hospitals met the 80% threshold of guideline concordant
care in 2004, which increased to 69.2% in 2013 (Figure 1B).

 aged 50 to 69 years (>80%) and particularly low among those
younger than 40 years (79.1%) and patients 80 years or older
(60.5%). Compared with non-Hispanic white patients (79.0%),
black (76.4%) and Hispanic (75.9%) patients were less likely
to receive AET. The combination of ER and PR status was
strongly associated with AET receipt; only 51.2% of the pa-
tients with ER−/PR+ cancer received AET. The association be-
tween tumor size and AET receipt was nonlinear for patients
with node-positive and node-negative disease, with receipt of
AET highest for patients with tumors measuring 1.0 to 2.0 cm
(eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Receipt of AET dramatically dif-
fered by local treatment as follows: postmastectomy radio-
therapy (90.1%), postlumpectomy radiotherapy (85.5%), mas-
tectomy alone (73.2%), and no radiotherapy after lumpectomy
(45.0%). Patients receiving chemotherapy were more likely to
use AET (86.4%) compared with those who did not (74.6%).
Receipt of AET varied by geographic regions, with New
England(83.3%)andtheWestNorthCentralstates(83.9%)hav-
ing the highest proportions and West South Central states
(71.2%) having the lowest proportion of AET use (eFigure 3 in
theSupplement).Interestingly,facilitiesinruralareasandthose
treating a large volume of cases were more likely to be con-
cordant with AET guidelines.
As expected, time to initiation of AET strongly depended
on whether radiotherapy and chemotherapy were given, but
only weakly depended on surgery type (Figure 2). For pa-
tients not receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the me-
dian duration from diagnosis to AET was 75 days, compared
with 112 days for radiotherapy alone, 202 days for chemo-
therapy alone, and 241 days for radiotherapy and chemo-
therapy (P < .001).
Of 174 786 patients who did not receive AET, 34 314
(19.6%) were recommended but refused, 7957 (4.6%) were
recommended but not administered without a reason, 9473
(5.4%) were not recommended owing to patient risk factors.
For the remainder of AET nonusers, reasons were not given.
We explored factors associated with refusal (vs nonrefusal
in women not receiving AET) and found that older women,
those living in communities with higher educational levels,
and those living in rural or small urban areas were more
likely to refuse, whereas Hispanic women were less likely to
refuse AET.
Factors Related to AET Misuse
Among Patients With HR− Cancer
eTable 2 in the Supplement presents AET receipt among pa-
tients with HR− cancer by factors that were statistically sig-
nificant in multivariable logistic regression. Among patients
with HR− breast cancer, 4.2% received AET, although it lacks
efficacy and risks adverse effects. Patients treated in low-
volume hospitals (4.6%) were more likely to be inappropri-
ately treated. Geographically, patients living in New England
(3.7%) and West North Central states (3.5%) were less likely
while those living in West South Central states (5.4%) were
more likely to be inappropriately treated.
Effectiveness of AET Receipt and Lives Lost
A total of 708 393 patients were included in the survival
analysis (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). During a median
follow-up of 4.9 years, 76 565 patients died. In the multi-
variable Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age,
race, insurance status, comorbidity index, year of diagnosis,
ER and PR status, histologic type, tumor grade, tumor size,
node status, surgical margin, type of surgery, radiotherapy,
chemotherapy, facility type, facility location, and facility
volume, receipt of AET was associated with a 29% relative
reduction in mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI,
0.70-0.73; P < .001), with an absolute difference of 2.8% at
year 5 and 6.1% at year 10 (Figure 3). Based on this effective-
ness estimate of overall survival, if all patients with HR+
cancer were treated in concordance with guidelines,
approximately 14 630 lives would have been saved during

 the 10 years of the study period. We explored the heteroge-
neity effect of AET by several clinical factors and found the
effect of AET was significant in all subgroups (Table)
(P < .001). The effect of AET was similar across subgroups
defined by age, node status, or chemotherapy, whereas it
was weaker among patients treated with lumpectomy but
without radiotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.80-
0.87). More than half these patients were older than 70
years (57.1%), and we have shown that the effect of AET is
smaller for older patients (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.74-
0.77), possibly owing to limited life expectancy.
Discussion
We investigated temporal changes and relevant factors asso-
ciated with AET receipt in the United States from 2004 to 2013.
Factors associated with AET receipt varied, and we found lo-
cal treatments, including surgery and radiotherapy, to be the
most important factor. In 2013, a considerable proportion of
patients with HR+ cancer who did not receive AET (17.6%) and
approximately 3% of patients with HR− cancer were inappro-
priately treated. Optimistically, from 2004 to 2013, AET un-
deruse and misuse decreased. These findings demonstrate a
significant improvement in AET receipt for patients with in-
vasive breast cancer compared with a similar study using the
NCDB for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ19 that found
fewer than half of patients received AET in 2012. In addition,
the rate receiving AET is similar to or better than the rates
for prior studies examining AET initiation through other
means.15-18,29
Wealsodemonstratedtheimportanceofconcordancewith
AET guidelines and found that AET use was associated with a
29% relative risk reduction in mortality. This finding expands
that of prior literature regarding mortality and disease-free
survival associated with discontinuation and nonadherence
by examining AET initiation.30,31 This estimate of AET effec-
tiveness is in line with relative risks of 0.66 to 0.71 from ran-
domized clinical trials.3
The NCDB also differs from SEER data in that the former
is a convenience sample of Commission on Cancer–
accredited hospitals and does not capture all cases in a
defined region. Accredited hospitals have more general and
cancer-related resources than nonaccredited hospitals.32
However, given its scope and larger number of cases, as
compared with the SEER database, the NCDB can be used to
assess national practice patterns.32 For example, we found
that exact HR status was strongly associated with AET
receipt, highest among patients with ER+/PR+ cancer, fol-
lowed by those with ER+/PR− cancer, and lowest among
those with ER−/PR+ cancer, suggesting that clinicians place
more value on the ER. Patients with the ER−/PR+ tumors are
being undertreated if not given AET.33
Age also played a role in AET decision making. The low
AET rate in younger patients has been found in prior studies
of adherence and persistence.34-36 Premenopausal women
may be more likely to make a risk-benefit assessment reject-
ing AET because these therapies are associated with adverse
effects. In addition, tamoxifen is a category D drug, and
young women may prioritize fertility issues.37 However,
the significant benefit of AET may be underrecognized in
these women who are increasingly choosing bilateral
mastectomy.38 In the group 80 years or older, this could
reflect a consideration of comorbidities, life expectancy, and
quality of life.39,40
Localtreatmentsappeartobekeyfactorsassociatedwithlike-
lihood of appropriate AET use. One possible explanation is that

ceivestandard-of-caretherapyingeneral.Inaddition,withmore

mended standards and best practices with a team-based
approach.41-45
We also investigated sociodemographic factors related to
AET use. Black women were less likely to receive AET. This
important finding could be contributing to the disparity in
racial breast cancer survival, especially in the setting of an
increasing incidence of HR+ tumors in this population.20,46,47
Receipt of AET was also less likely in Hispanic and more
likely in Asian women, a finding that is similar to those of
other studies that have examined ethnic and racial differ-
ences in AET initiation and could contribute to the survival
variation in these groups as well.48-50 Recent evidence sug-
gests that economic interventions aimed at lowering out-of-
pocket costs could potentially help lessen racial disparities in
AET use.51
Facility factors also played a role in AET receipt, for
which the rate varied substantially by facility volume and
geographic location. We found that facilities in West South
Central states and low-volume institutions were more likely
to misuse and underuse AET. These quality-of-care deficits

 could affect breast cancer mortality, because geographic
differences have been well documented.52-54
Limitations
The study has limitations. Use of AET is known to be under-
reported in registry data because outpatient treatments are
not always reported in hospital records. A calibration study in
the SEER database suggested that the AET use was approxi-
mately 10% underreported,55,56 and the NCDB may experi-
ence a similar magnitude of underreporting. The database
also does not provide information on adherence, persistence,
or whether AET was used as directed. In addition, other
known NCDB limitations that could affect patients’treatment
decisions, including absence of the specific type of AET rec-
ommended, family history, and genomic profile.19 We are also
not privy to the physician-patient discussion that occurred,
and suboptimal communication affects AET patterns of
care.18,57,58 For example, in the B-QUAL study,18 noninitiation
was less likely in those who found the quality of patient-
physician communication to be higher. Friese et al59 used
SEER data and found that inadequate information about
adverse effects detrimentally affects AET initiation.
Conclusions
This study reported nationwide data on AET practice patterns
from2004to2013.Thesecularpatternsshowedthatappropriate
AET use has been increasing, but optimal use has not been
achieved. Our findings suggest that local treatment, including
surgeryandradiotherapy,mayplayasubstantialroleinAETde-
cisionmaking.Facilitationofmultidisciplinaryteam–basedcare
mayhelpoptimizeguideline-concordanttreatmentbyensuring
patients are not lost to follow-up and are recommended for

tionsarebeingdeprivedofthislife-savingtherapy,includingmi-
noritiesandthoseoneitherendoftheagespectrum.Wehopethat,
with the coming launch of the Medicare Access and CHIP
