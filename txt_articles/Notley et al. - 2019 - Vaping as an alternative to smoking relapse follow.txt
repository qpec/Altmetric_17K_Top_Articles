Abstract
Background and Aims. E-cigarettes are the most popular aid to quitting smoking in the UK. Although many smokers
quit, relapse is common. Historically, the literature has reported strong associations between tobacco smoking lapse and relapse
following a quit attempt. This article aims to explore how smoking lapse is experienced by those who vape to quit smoking.
Design and Methods. A purposive sample of 40 UK vapers were matched to a sampling frame from a representative sam-
ple of UK quitters. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted. Data were thematically analysed iteratively situat-
ing reported experiences of smoking lapse within narrative descriptions of vaping. Iterative categorization was used as a
technique to further explore a subset of data specifically focused on smoking lapse. Results. Analysis revealed that smoking
lapse is perceived qualitatively differently when using e-cigarettes as compared to past quit attempts. Having the pleasurable
alternative of vaping meant that full relapse to smoking was not inevitable. Instead, lapses were perceived as ‘permissive’ or
‘purposive’, intentional and contextualised, or for some as unintentional, with the resulting emotional response negatively rein-
forcing ongoing tobacco smoking abstinence. Discussion and Conclusions. Our novel findings suggest that the role of
tobacco smoking lapse in relation to relapse status may be theoretically redefined, drawing on data from vapers. These findings
question the utility of previous theories of the role of smoking lapse in the relapse process. For ex-smokers, vaping offers a plea-
surable, viable pharmacological, but also social and psychological, substitution option for smoking and potentially powerfully
alters the experience and threat of any lapse. [Notley C, Ward E, Dawkins L, Holland R, Jakes S. Vaping as an alterna-

Introduction
E-cigarettes are the most popular aid to quitting smok-
ing in the UK [1]. There is support for vaping as a
harm reduction approach and an alternative to tobacco
smoking from UK Medical [2] and Public Health
[3,4] bodies. Although many smokers manage to quit,
evidence (primarily predating the widespread use of e-
cigarettes)
suggests
that
many
successful
quitters
relapse over time [5]. Most vapers use e-cigarettes for
smoking cessation or reduction [3], but we still have
little understanding of how vapers use e-cigarettes to
avoid long-term smoking relapse. Emergent qualitative
evidence from our research has suggested that e-
cigarettes may be important in helping people to main-
tain long-term smoking abstinence, by substituting not
only the physical but also the psychological and social
aspects that ex-smokers had previously enjoyed about
smoking [6]. It is also important to understand how
those who quit smoking using an e-cigarette experi-
ence tobacco smoking lapse and relapse. This is so that
we can develop evidence based advice, guidance or
interventions to support those who have quit smoking
to stay abstinent in the longer term, as relapsing back
to tobacco smoking is so harmful to health [7]. In the
additional analysis reported in this article, we build on
our research findings by undertaking analysis of a dis-
tinct and unique data set focused on participant expe-
riences of smoking lapse.
A lapse to tobacco smoking can be defined as a one
off incident (a single ‘puff’) [8] or a number of ciga-
rettes smoked on any one occasion. Relapse, according
to the Russell standard [9], can be defined as more
than five instances of tobacco lapse in the previous
50 weeks following a quit attempt, or a return to con-
tinuous smoking [10]. However, these definitions may

 not match user or health professional views, as ex-
smokers may not see a one off ‘slip’ as a lapse [11].
Published evidence on relapse to tobacco smoking is
primarily quantitative, linking predictors of initial lapse
to full smoking relapse [10,12]. A spectrum of ‘risk
factors’ encompassing: physical (craving, urges, nico-
tine
dependence
[13]);
psychological
(self-efficacy
beliefs [14], motivation [15]); individual differences
such as education level [16]; social (partner support
[14]) and cultural factors (wider environment support-
ive of smoking [17]), have been correlated with
tobacco smoking relapse. This medicalised approach
assumes a deficit view of tobacco use, positioning the
individual as potentially vulnerable to addiction. Argu-
ably, the concept of addiction itself is morally laden,
globally characterised by society as inherently bad.
Adopting a medicalised approach to tobacco addiction
positions the individual who lapses or relapses as in
need of ‘treatment’ for their addiction. However, qual-
itative studies have suggested that, for some, smoking
lapse, and relapse, situated in people’s lives, is com-
plex, related to unfolding processes of identity devel-
opment, and involving the loss and regaining of
pleasure. A lapse may therefore be situationally adap-
tive, particularly from a social perspective [18]. Adopt-
ing this alternative view positions relapse as more than
a health behaviour; the understanding of which may
ultimately contribute to harm reduction interventions
that are implementable, sustainable, and meaningful to
the lived realities of smokers and ex-smokers.
Theoretical understanding of smoking relapse is
underdeveloped and would benefit from updating.
There
are
currently
no
effective
recommended
approaches to preventing smoking relapse [5]. Mar-
latt & Gordon’s theory of relapse, based on cognitive–
behavioural theory [19] has underpinned previously
developed relapse prevention interventions. Central to
the model is a detailed taxonomy of risk factors that
can precipitate or contribute to relapse. Although risk
factors are both individual and social, the model takes
a primarily individualistic stance. The abstinence viola-
tion effect (AVE) suggests that following a cue driven
initial lapse to smoking (a ‘violation’ of smoking absti-
nence), the individual’s negative emotional response
[20] and the causes to which they attribute the lapse
[21], create cognitive dissonance [22], resulting in
breakdown of willpower, culminating in full smoking
relapse [23]. This effect is well evidenced [21,24,25].
However, the AVE phenomenon has, to our knowl-
edge, never been explored in the context of vaping.
Evidence
and
theorising
regarding
the
role
of
tobacco smoking lapse and relapse in the lives of users
predates the widespread consumer use of e-cigarettes
in the UK as a quitting aid. We therefore propose that
a detailed, qualitative understanding of the role of
tobacco lapse and relapse is undertaken in the context
of vaping, in order to generate hypotheses and develop
new theory. In this article we focused specifically on a
subset of data reporting users experiences of tobacco
smoking lapse, seeking to address the research ques-
tion: ‘How is smoking lapse experienced by those who
vape to quit smoking?’ A qualitative approach was par-
ticularly suitable in this context, where existing theory
is outdated in the context of a fast moving consumer
market establishing e-cigarettes as integral to the
majority of smoking quit attempts.
Methods
The analysis reported in this article draws on data
gathered as part of a wider study (The ECtra study
[6]). This was a qualitative interview study taking a
critical realist epistemological approach, drawing on
principles of constructivist grounded theory [26]. The
approach prioritises the perspectives of individuals
and takes at face value the information divulged dur-
ing the socially constructed situation of the research
interview. The interviews broadly sought to illuminate
the subjective experiences of vapers who quit smoking
using an e-cigarette, whether or not they reported
having maintained abstinence from smoking or expe-
rienced tobacco smoking lapse and/or relapse. Partici-
pant smoking and vaping status was self-reported.
Participants self-reporting having quit smoking using
an e-cigarette were recruited using word of mouth,
via self-referral through advertising in local, national
and social media, and snowballing to seek referrals
from interviewees. The inclusion criteria for the study
was broad, aiming for maximum variation in demo-
graphic characteristics of individuals (e.g. gender,
age,
reported
smoking
history,
reported
vaping
history).
From eligible referrals, a purposive sample of 40 UK
vapers were matched by gender and age to a sampling
frame of demographic characteristics from a represen-
tative
sample
of
past
12 month
UK
quitters
(as reported in Notley et al. [6]). Interview guides were
constructed taking a narrative approach, asking partici-
pants to ‘tell the story’ of their history of tobacco use,
previous quit attempts, quitting using an e-cigarette,
patterns and experiences of e-cigarette use over time,
and, for this article, the focus was on detailing any
lapses or the circumstances surrounding relapse where
this had occurred. Interview guides were piloted with
‘experts by experience’ who advised the research team
throughout. The cross-sectional semi-structured quali-
tative interviews were conducted between September
2016 and May 2017.

 Participants gave written consent for interviews
(face-to-face or telephone if preferred). Interviews were
conducted by experienced researchers trained in quali-
tative
interviewing
techniques.
Interviews
typically
lasted 60–90 min and participants were given a £20
shopping voucher as reimbursement for their time.
Audio files of interviews were transcribed verbatim and
anonymised. Detailed interviewer/field notes were kept
following each interview. Participant codes used to ref-
erence quotes refer to participant’s gender and age
(e.g. ‘F24’ for ‘female aged 24’. Letters were used
where age and gender duplicates occurred.).
Data were inductively thematically analysed case by
case independently by both CN and EW. Thematic
analysis is the most appropriate analysis technique in
this context, where we aimed to undertake exploratory
inductive analysis to allow issues and themes of impor-
tance to arise without imposing a priori hypotheses to
the data [27]. Where they occurred, lapse experiences
were analysed as part of the narrative of the individual
trajectory through initiating e-cigarette use, through to
quitting smoking. Themes were discussed and com-
pared across cases to identify meta-themes. As a sec-
ond stage of analysis, iterative categorisation (IC) [28]
was used as a technique by CN to explore meta-
themes. For the analysis reported in this article, the
meta-theme of lapse to tobacco smoking was the focus
of analysis. All instances of thematic coding relating to
the experience of lapse to tobacco smoking were
extracted and further analysed using IC. IC is a rigor-
ous and transparent qualitative analytical technique,
‘coding on’ and developing analysis from initial the-
matic coding [28], creating a clear audit trail linking
analysis back to raw data. This facilitated the process
of interpretation by helping to identify clear patterns
and situated significance in the data. IC codes were
checked and verified by EW.
Ethical approval for the study was granted from
UEA’s Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences
Research ethics committee, September 2016.
Results
Overall sample characteristics are reported in Notley
et al.[6]. The mean age of participants was 41 years
(SD: 14.0, range 21–70). All participants identified as
White British or European, 16 were employed in man-
agerial, professional or technical occupations, and
33 were recruited in East Anglia with the remainder
located across other parts of England. Four interviews
were undertaken over the telephone at the request of
the participant. There was no discernible difference in
data quality between face to face and telephone
interviews. Vaping experience varied from starting
2 weeks before interview, to 7 years. Thirty-one partic-
ipants were vaping and abstinent from tobacco (19 had
reported lapses), six participants had relapsed (five
dual using both tobacco and vaping) and three were
no longer using either e-cigarettes or tobacco.
Iterative categorisation of meta-themes coded under
reported situations of tobacco smoking lapse or relapse
resulted in four overarching themes. Within these
themes we developed 113 unique codes that encapsu-
lated the meaning of the experiences described during
interviews (Appendix S1, Supporting Information).
Codes are used as descriptive qualifiers for analysis.
Quotations were selected from frequently occurring
codes across interviews as best representing the analyt-
ical point.
Vapers’ reports of tobacco smoking lapse situations
Although most of the sample were currently vaping,
reporting tobacco abstinence, nearly half reported
either brief or regular lapses to tobacco smoking.
Lapses reportedly primarily occurred in social situa-
tions, particularly those previously associated with
smoking:
‘Even now I still go outside and smoke at the pub, but it
is just when you’re standing with other people’ (F26b).
Situated lapse reasons were more complex, drawing
very specifically on aspects of vaping that were per-
ceived as having been ineffective, in the moment. For
example,
brief
lapses
were
attributed
to
device
malfunction:
‘I think I’ve had, maybe one cigarette since I’ve been vap-
ing, and that was because my battery died’ (F21).
Or were blamed on deficits in individual functioning
(forgetting):
‘…there was some wine involved, it was at a social gath-
ering, ex-colleague, and there was one lonely smoker in
the garden and she said ‘come out with me’, and I didn’t
have my e-cigarette, and I’m like “oh, I’ll just smoke
one of yours”’ (F36b).
These ‘one off’ lapses were justifiable in terms of
device or individual ‘failure’. However, a strong theme
that appears novel in relation to vaping, is that many of
the sample described instances of purposefully lapsing:
70

Drugs
 ‘there was part of me that wanted to know if it would be
the same or not, and part of me wanted to just sort of,
“I’ll give it a go and just see what’s what”, and because
I was in a very confident position, then I didn’t feel in
the slightest bit at risk of sort of regressing, and I think
that’s part of what it was actually, it was a sort of, it
was a check box to say “yes, that’s not a prob-
lem”’ (M58).
This ‘purposive lapse’ was situated as a test of
resolve, seeing whether one was able to return to being
fully abstinent. For these people the lapse was externa-
lised. In contrast, others demonstrated a residual
desire for tobacco smoking, perhaps through positive
associations with smoking as a social behaviour, such
that they positioned lapse as purposive in the sense of
being ‘motivated by naughtiness’, enjoying the secret
of a purposive lapse, or flaunting an ability to lapse
without craving more and fully relapsing ‘just because
I can’:
‘I was like, I’m just going to have a cigarette, just
because I could, but I also felt quite naughty doing it, as
I was doing it I was like, “I hope he doesn’t come down
and see me do this”’ (M30).
When asked how they responded immediately to a
lapse,
overwhelmingly
reported
were
feelings
of
disgust:
‘I have had cigarettes between, in the last three years
and they’re the most disgusting things, absolutely awful,
you know, just out of curiosity sometimes have a ciga-
rette’ (F62b).
Particularly, unpleasant smell and taste sensations
were described:
‘it just doesn’t taste very nice, it makes you smell, and
it’s not a particularly pleasant thing to be doing com-
pared to vaporising, it’s just so much nicer’ (M37a).
Immediate reactions were described in these very
physical terms, with internalised feelings secondary in
the descriptions of immediate reactions:
‘I’ve tried one, hated it, it made me feel sick so I can’t
ever go back…sometimes I’ve smelt someone else having
a cigarette, you know, when I’ve been outside and I just,
and just fleetingly think I wouldn’t mind a cigarette, but
then I remember having tried a cigarette again, and just
how sick it made me feel’ (F48).
Reacting and reflecting
Reflecting on the lapse beyond the immediate reaction,
individuals
deployed
justifications
to
protect
self-
esteem against the potential attack of ‘failure’ at having
lapsed. For example, lapse was minimised in discus-
sion, (‘it didn’t really count’), positioned as insignifi-
cant, i.e. not leading to relapse:
‘I mean even on this, I do still have the occasional crav-
ing for a cigarette, they are very occasional, it’s not
something that I’m faced with daily or indeed even
weekly, so on that particular occasion there were a group
of friends, about half of which smoked… so yes obviously
I was joining them, initially started on the vape, but of
course there was lots of tobacco around…’ (M44).
Strong physical and emotional immediate responses
to a lapse were experienced by participants as being
negatively reinforcing, thus potentially adaptive in
helping to avoid future lapse situations:
‘then again in December I tried the same thing and was
like, “this isn’t working for me to be honest”, so I knew
at that point it’s like, I’m not going to go back to smok-
ing cigarettes’ (M30).
Critically, and recurring frequently across cases, was
‘permissive
lapse’.
Participants
described
how,
at
times, they deliberately set out to have a smoking
lapse, either to permit themselves the pleasure of
smoking in a time or situation limited way, in the
knowledge that they would continue to vape following
the lapse:
‘I always consider myself a vaper, no I will never be a
smoker again, so I know that if I have a fag then I can
just cut it and it can be a long time before I‘ll have
another one for whatever reason, I’m not worried that
it’s going to be a routine anymore, cos it’s not, I’ve bro-
ken the habit as far as I’m concerned, and I feel confi-
dent in that, so that’s why I’m not afraid if I do feel I
need one in extreme circumstances, I will have one, and I
won’t relapse’ (F34).
Maintaining abstinence from smoking following lapses
On the path to maintaining abstinence from tobacco
smoking, barriers, controls and strategies were dis-
cussed at a number of interacting levels. At the indi-
vidual level, beliefs were fundamental. For some this
meant not allowing permissive lapses:
Vaping as an alternative to smoking relapse
71

Drugs
 ‘I think if I smoked again I would just be straight back
into it’ (F26b).
Here an ‘abstinence violation discourse’ was appar-
ent. Participants had previous experiences of lapsing
during past quit attempts where they had not used e-
cigarettes, which was usually quickly followed by full
relapse. Drawing on these past experiences to develop
beliefs about current or future likely outcomes helped
some individuals to remain abstinent:
‘….(in the past)… it would just sort of be the occasional
cigarette, and then it would be a couple more, and then it
would be back on ten a day, so it was just like, that
would just be how it went, so it would just go straight
back down that slippery slope’ (M36a).
When discussing smoking abstinence, vapers in our
sample talked about the pleasurable and enjoyable
aspects of vaping that in many ways had made it easy
to stop smoking, certainly compared with previous quit
attempts. Vaping was seen as an ‘alternative to smok-
ing’, a direct substitution:
‘they’re the perfect replication of smoking, nothing else
gives you that, and if you’re like me, and there is a lot of
people like me enjoy smoking, the action of it, the feel of
it, it becomes, it’s important to you isn’t it? that feeling,
and you enjoy it…it is all about the action and that’s the
only thing I’ve ever found that replicates it’ (F34).
Some people described how they were completely
satisfied by vaping:
‘buying that e-cigarette, I mean I can’t explain it, except
to say it satisfied me’ (M63).
Or went further by describing how vaping, for them,
was even ‘better than smoking’:
‘I much prefer vaping that is something that I actually
enjoy, and cigarettes I don’t’ (F34).
These pleasurable and positive aspects of vaping are
completely novel in comparison to other methods of
smoking cessation support. For many users, the posi-
tive benefits of vaping meant that they felt that this
substitution option was protective against the likeli-
hood of tobacco smoking relapse:
‘so I’d have a cigarette alongside a drink, that e-cigarette
didn’t seem to sate that, but that gradually changed over
time, so I can now go out and use an e-cigarette all
night’ (F46a).
For some, pleasurable aspects of vaping contrasted
particularly with less pleasurable aspects of smoking,
again potentially protecting against the likelihood of
relapse. For example, vapers who discussed enjoying
the smells and flavours of vape demonstrated greater
levels of dislike, or disgust, for the smell of tobacco
smoke. Here, a participant describes the pleasure and
enjoyment of flavours as ‘a thing in and of itself’—a
uniquely pleasurable aspect of e-cigarette use that
offers something beyond merely smoking cessation:
‘I really like them, I like the flavours of the liquids, cos
that was one thing when I started on like getting fla-
voured liquids, I was like I really want one that tastes
like tobacco, and then I was like, no, I really don’t, you
can get strawberry and vanilla and yummy things, so I
love the flavours… so I really enjoy it, I like it as a thing
in and of itself’ (F38).
Shifting identity
Five
participants
reported
‘dual
using’
both
e-
cigarettes and tobacco daily. Dual users discussed feel-
ing under no pressure to quit tobacco smoking, mean-
ing that they could ‘take it or leave it’. While this may
have the discursive effect of justifying continued smok-
ing,
alternatively
the
‘no
pressure’
situation
may
encourage smokers to eventually quit, even if this had
not been their intention.
‘after a while, because I thought it didn’t really matter,
and potentially had some health benefits of not having
any nicotine at all, and I started vaping more, and then
sort of gradually I felt I’ll have the vape and won’t spend
money on cigarettes, not only because I don’t really crave
it that much anymore, and sort of, this is gradually, it
wasn’t a conscious effort, it was more a by-product of
having a vape that I stopped smoking, because I wasn’t
planning on stopping, it just happened’ (M21).
This suggests that time limited dual using when
switching to vaping can be a stepping stone towards
smoking cessation. A period of dual using, if preceding
eventual tobacco smoking abstinence, can be under-
stood less as a phenomenon of physical addiction, and
more as shifting social identity. Although many of our
sample saw themselves as ‘non-smokers’, many also
retained a smoker identity, as evidenced by a residual
attraction for smoking, and the associated psychologi-
cal and social perceived positive aspects of tobacco
smoking:
72
C. Notley et al.

Drugs
 ‘part of me did miss it, as I said before, I’ve never dis-
liked smoking per se, I mean, I dislike the effects of smok-
ing, it’s always been a sort of nice thing to get that sort
of, after you get lunch or whatever, and there’s a certain
kind of vibe feeling it gives you’ (F36b).
For
some,
there
was
evidence
of
identity
‘in
transition’:
‘I don’t think that I’ve ever thought that I would ever go
back and smoke like I used to… I do get a little bit con-
cerned sometimes that if I put the e-cig down, if they
stopped, if they became suddenly illegal and were banned,
then I don’t know how I would be in terms of, if I would
go back smoking or whether I would go and find another
alternative’ (F33).
Here the participant discusses a shifting identity
from smoker to vaper, but draws on a retained identity
that is in transition. Significantly she draws attention
to cultural and political contexts permitting e-cigarette
use, suggesting that restrictions could impact on subse-
quent alternative behaviours.
These people we defined as ‘sliders’ towards tobacco
smoking abstinence rather than ‘switchers’. However,
others within our sample saw themselves very firmly as
‘vapers’, with the switch to e-cigarettes seemingly
complete.
Discussion
Findings demonstrate that ex-smokers experience vap-
ing as a pleasurable and enjoyable direct substitution
for smoking, particularly apparent in circumstances
contrasting the experience of tobacco smoking lapse.
Aspects specific to vaping, such as smell, sensory plea-
sure of inhaling vapour, and the action of vaping, may
be
protective
against
smoking
relapse,
as
vapers
described how they came to prefer vaping over smok-
ing.
Lapses
to tobacco
smoking
were
commonly
reported, particularly in the early phases of quitting
smoking by vaping. Lapse was often purposefully
sought in order to ‘test resolve’ in remaining smoke
free, or lapses were permissible in certain circum-
stances due to confidence that relapse could be
avoided due to the availability of vaping.
In previous literature, a brief lapse has been strongly
associated with smoking relapse [29]. In our data too,
individuals
frequently
described
how
previous
instances of lapse prior to vaping inevitably led to
relapse. However, in the context of quitting smoking
by vaping, brief lapses could be purposive or permis-
sive,
without
resulting
in
subsequent
relapse.
In
countries with policies enabling vaping, vaping is a via-
ble, and indeed for many, preferable, alternative to
smoking, allowing any sense of ‘failure’ at lapsing to be
minimised. By interrupting the almost automatic pro-
cesses between lapse and relapse through offering an
alternative; our exploratory study suggests that relapse
need not be inevitable following a brief tobacco lapse
amongst those who vape.
The concept of ‘permissive lapse’ implies a ‘no pres-
sure’ solution to forgiving the occasional ‘slip’. This
may reduce the pressure that gradually constrains indi-
viduals when attempting to maintain abstinence from
smoking. This idea underpins the AVE hypothesis.
The build-up of pressure due to cognitive dissonance
(the inconsistency between one’s resolve to be absti-
nent and the smoking lapse, along with the internal
attribution (‘I’m a failure because I have lapsed’))
results in full-blown relapse. In the context of continu-
ing to vape, however, individuals seemed able to
release some of this pressure. A permissive lapse allows
small indiscretions presumably creating less cognitive
dissonance, which in turn meant that full relapse was
not inevitable.
Strong
physical
and
emotional
immediate
responses to a smoking lapse, particularly when con-
trasted with the positive sensory experience of vap-
ing, were experienced by participants as negatively
reinforcing. Previous literature on smoking relapse
has reported the common phenomenon of negative
affect following relapse, creating cognitive disso-
nance [21]. However, the strong disgust reaction
described by our sample was primarily sensory—a
reaction to dislike of the taste, smell and sensation of
tobacco smoking once habituated to the alternative
of vaping. In this sense, while vaping, a brief tobacco
lapse could be hypothesised as being functionally
adaptive in helping to avoid future lapse situations.
This is a novel initial finding, as it suggests that, as
opposed to a lapse strongly predicting future relapse,
lapses may actually negatively reinforce sustained
abstinence from tobacco smoking, through initiating
a strong ‘disgust’ reaction. This is an important
hypothesis arising from and grounded in the analysis
of our qualitative cross-sectional data. Clearly, this
may be contested by evidence from other data-
sets [30], requires future investigation, and particu-
larly testing with longitudinal data.
Previous literature has described ongoing ‘identity
work’
as
individuals
attempt
to
quit
smoking
[18,31,32]. For some, quitting smoking can be
exceptionally hard due to the shift in identity that is
necessary to prevent smoking relapse. Similarly in
our sample, vapers provided evidence of shifts in
identity, being ‘in transition’ between a smoker and
an ex-smoker identity, with the alternative identity of
Vaping as an alternative to smoking relapse
73

 ‘vaper’ adopted to a greater or lesser extent. Identity
shifts as people move from becoming smokers to
vapers require further examination. Particularly for
dual users whose identity may be ‘in transition’,
there is a need for longitudinal follow-up to ascertain
how transitioning identity unfolds over time, with
behaviour either resulting in continued tobacco use
or abstinence.
In practice, the findings from our focused qualitative
analysis of the experience of vapers quitting tobacco
smoking suggest that vaping could be supported in
encouraging not just smoking cessation, but long-term
relapse prevention. Particularly, in countries where
policies allow vaping, vaping offers a viable alternative
to smoking, and is available as a ‘fall back’ option if a
brief tobacco smoking lapse occurs. Supporting ongo-
ing vaping then suggests that the UK service approach
of encouraging ‘not even a puff’ may need re-examin-
ing, as in fact a brief lapse need not result in relapse if
the user has a sufficiently satisfying and enjoyable
method of vaping as an alternative. This also has
potential implications for the measurement of smoking
cessation and relapse prevention outcomes in clinical
trials [9].
Theoretically, the concept of the AVE may not
apply to those who vape, as our data suggest that brief
lapse need not inevitably lead to relapse. However,
this conclusion is based on cross-sectional qualitative
findings. This is a limitation—we are able to offer
potential hypotheses for future study that require fur-
ther testing and replication with larger representative
populations.
Purposive sampling and rigorous analytical proce-
dures suggest that findings are transferable to wider
populations of vapers. However, the sample is qualita-
tive, and thus findings are not generalisable to wider
populations of ex-smokers, since we did not set out to
achieve
statistical
representativeness.
Particularly,
despite our best efforts, we were unable to sample rep-
resentatively from lower socioeconomic groups [33].
We did not seek biochemical validation of smoking sta-
tus since our focus was concerned with understanding
the participant perspective rather than confirming
objective biochemical status. Our sample only included
two people who had reported having tried vaping and
did not have at least some success in reducing their
smoking.
We tentatively suggest that our findings uniquely
demonstrate how the role of smoking lapse may be
theoretically redefined, in the context of vaping, ques-
tioning the utility of previous theories of the role of
smoking lapse in the relapse process. For ex-smokers,
vaping appears to offer a powerful substitution option
for smoking and an alternative to relapse, even follow-
ing situations of brief lapse.
