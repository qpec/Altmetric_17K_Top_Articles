Abstract
Objectives: This article provides the first estimates of educational differences in age-specific prevalence, and changes in 
prevalence over time, of dementia by education levels in the United States. It also provides information on life expectancy, 
and changes in life expectancy, with dementia and cognitively healthy life for educational groups.
Method: Data on cognition from the 2000 and 2010 Health and Retirement Study are used to classify respondents as 
having dementia, cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND), or being cognitively intact. Vital statistics data are used 
to estimate life tables for education groups and the Sullivan method is used to estimate life expectancy by cognitive state.
Results: People with more education have lower prevalence of dementia, more years of cognitively healthy life, and fewer years 
with dementia. Years spent in good cognition increased for most sex-education groups and, conversely, years spent with demen-
tia decreased for some. Mortality reduction was the most important factor in increasing cognitively healthy life. Change in the 
distribution of educational attainment has played a major role in the reduction of life with dementia in the overall population.
Discussion: Differences in the burden of cognitive loss by education point to the significant cost of low social status both 
to individuals and to society.
Keywords:  Dementia prevalence, Health and Retirement Study, Trends
The prevalence of dementia appears to be on the decline in 
the United States and some Western European Countries, 
at least in the most recent decade (Langa et al., 2017; 
Wu et al., 2017). Life expectancy in the United States has 
continued to increase at a modest pace in recent decades; 
this has resulted in an increase in life expectancy without 
dementia and a decrease in life years spent with dementia 
among older Americans (Crimmins, Saito, & Kim, 2016). 
However, neither levels nor trends in prevalence of demen-
tia and life expectancy are equal across educational groups 
in the United States. Persons with lower educational attain-
ment have poorer cognitive functioning and more dementia 
(Langa et al., 2008; Lièvre, Alley, & Crimmins, 2008; Stern, 
Albert, Tang, & Tsai, 1999). In addition, life expectancy 
of those with less education is shorter than that of those 
with more education (Hummer & Lariscy, 2011) and in 
recent years life expectancy differentials between higher 
and lower education groups have been increasing (Meara, 
Richards, & Cutler, 2008; Montez, Hummer, Hayward, 
Woo, & Rogers, 2011; Olshansky et al., 2012; Sasson,

 2016), largely due to dramatic declines in mortality in the 
higher education group (Montez & Zajacova, 2013).
Increasing levels of educational attainment in the American 
population over recent decades are one of the factors to which 
decreases in dementia prevalence are attributed; however, 
dementia levels and trends within education groups of a 
nationally representative sample of Americans have not been 
clarified nor have changes in cognitively healthy life expec-
tancy by education been estimated. This article examines 
change over 10 years in cognitive functioning and years of 
life expectancy in cognitive states by educational attainment 
for people aged 65 years and over in the United States. We 
produce the first life tables demonstrating the size of differ-
ences by education level for the U.S. population in years of life 
expectancy with dementia, with cognitive impairment with-
out dementia (CIND) and cognitively healthy life. In addition, 
we examine the effect on changes in cognitive life expectancy, 
of changes over time in the prevalence of cognitive state, as 
well as changes in mortality within education groups.
Method
Data
Cognitive data
Data on cognitive ability for the U.S. population aged 
65 years and over come from the 2000 and 2010 Health 
and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS is a nationally rep-
resentative sample of persons over 50 years of age who are 
interviewed every 2 years beginning in 1992. In 2000 and 
2010, 88% and 89% of those scheduled for reinterview 
were surveyed. Our analysis is based on 10,374 partici-
pants in 2000 and 9,995 in 2010 who were aged 65 years 
or older. This included both community-dwelling and nurs-
ing home residents (3.9% in 2000 and 4.2% in 2010 were 
nursing home residents), as well as self- and proxy respond-
ents (about 12.2% in 2000 and 8.4% in 2010 were proxy 
respondents) (Table 1). The average age of the sample at 
both dates was about 75 years, of whom about 58% were 
females (Table 1). Because results for cognitive status are 
imputed if some tests are missing, very few cases had miss-
ing data on cognitive status, only 10 cases in 2000 and 
5 cases in 2010 (Fisher, Hassan, Faul, Rodgers, & Weir, 
2017). All of those missing on dementia status are persons 
with a proxy respondent. In 2000, 5 of the 10 missing cases 
were in the low education category; in 2010, 3 had com-
pleted high school but no college.
Cognitive status is determined through responses to a ser-
ies of tests for individuals who are self-respondents and, for 
those who are not self-respondents, answers to a set of ques-
tions to proxies and interviewer observations. Because poor 
cognitive functioning is one of the reasons people do not 
respond for themselves, it is particularly important to include 
these people in assessment of the prevalence of cognitive state. 
Categorizing people as having good cognition, dementia, or 
CIND is based on the concordance of HRS cognitive function-
ing scores and diagnosis of dementia and CIND in a subset 
of HRS respondents who had neuropsychological assessment 
in the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS) 
(Crimmins, Kim, Langa, & Weir, 2011; Langa et al., 2017).
Self-respondents’ cognitive scores can range from 0 to 
27 and are based on tests of immediate recall of 10 words, 
delayed recall of the same 10 words, 5 trials of Serial 7s, 
and Backward counting (score 0–2). If a respondent does 
not complete all the tests, the missing measures are imputed 
(Fisher et al., 2017). Respondents with scores from 12 to 
27 are classified as having good cognitive functioning; 0 to 
6 as dementia; and 7 to 11 as CIND.
This classification system was developed by regressing 
scores on the HRS tests on clinical diagnoses performed in 
the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), a 
subsample of the HRS for which interviews began in 2001.
For individuals whose information is provided by prox-
ies, the classification is based on a direct assessment of 
memory (0 excellent, 1 very good, 2 good, 3 fair, 4 poor); 
an assessment of limitations in 5 instrumental activities of 
daily living (managing money, taking medication, prepar-
ing hot meals, using phones and doing groceries) (0–5); and 
the interviewer assessment of difficulty completing the inter-
view because of cognitive limitation (score 0–2 indicating, 
none, some, prevents completion). These scores are summed 
and those with a score of 0–2 are classified as cognitively 
healthy; 3–5 as CIND; and 6–11 as having dementia. For 
the entire sample the percent with dementia decreased from 
11.8 in 2000 to 9.4 in 2010 and the prevalence of good cog-
nitive functioning increased from 67.0% to 70.9% (Table 
1), both changes being statistically significant.
Reported years of educational attainment are used to 
divide people into 4 categories: 16 years or more (approxi-
mating college degree or more), 13–15 years (some college), 
12 years of education (high school degree), and less than 
12 years of education (did not complete high school). In 
2000, about 33% of HRS respondents over age 65 years

 had an educational level of less than high school, 34% 
with high school completion, 17% with some college, and 
16% with college or more. In 2010, the percent changed to 
22% for less than high school, 35% for high school com-
pletion, 21% with some college, and 22% with college or 
more (Table 1). Because this is a longitudinal survey, people 
report their education at the initial wave, generally long 
before the onset of dementia.
Education is not included in the categorization of cogni-
tive state. In an earlier article where the original approach 
to categorization of cognitive state was developed, educa-
tion groups did not differ in the likelihood of having a diag-
nosis of dementia or CIND after controlling for the scores 
on the individual cognitive tests included in the definitions 
(Crimmins et al., 2011). We have reproduced the original 
analysis with the categorization of education used here (4 
groups instead of 3); the results were similar with the excep-
tion that people in the ADAMS subsample with 12 years of 
schooling were still twice as likely to have CIND as those 
who have at least 16 years of education.
Mortality data
Mortality data for educational groups for 2000 and 2010 
are from the U.S. National Vital Statistics. Life tables for 
education groups were developed from mortality rates esti-
mated by Sasson (2016). Sasson estimated mortality rates 
with a categorization of educational attainment thought to 
be optimal for examining trends in mortality by education, 
by estimating mortality for the educational attainment 
groups of 0–11, 12, 13–15, and 16+ years for the black 
and white populations of the United States for 2000 and 
2010. Data for deaths come from the U.S. Multiple Cause 
of Death Public Use Files (Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 2013); population denominators come from 
the 5% Integrated Public Use File for the Census (Ruggles 
et al., 2010) and the American Community Survey. These 
estimates of changes in mortality by education over this 
period are thought to be the most reliable and valid 
(Sasson, 2017).
Analytic Approach
First, we examine the prevalence of cognitive state by educa-
tion group in 2010 and then change between 2000 and 2010 
for education groups. Nonoverlapping confidence intervals 
imply significant change over time. Life expectancy by cog-
nitive state for education groups is estimated by combining 
measures of the prevalence of dementia, CIND, and good 
cognition by education with education-specific life tables. 
The life table years lived in each age group are divided into 
these three states using the prevalence of the cognitive states 
at each age. We use the Sullivan method for computing the 
length of expected life with dementia, CIND, and good cog-
nitive functioning (Jagger, Cox, Roy, & the EHEMU team, 
2007; Saito, Robine, & Crimmins, 2014). Years lived with 
dementia, CIND, and good cognition are summed at all ages 
after the specified age and divided by the number of people 
alive at that age to obtain life expectancy with dementia and 
CIND. Cognitively healthy life expectancy reflects the aver-
age number of years at a specified age a person can expect 
to live with good cognitive skills given current mortality and 
prevalence of cognitive problems. Standard errors for the 
estimated values are computed using the approach provided 
by Jagger et al. (2007).
In order to see the relative effect of changes in the preva-
lence of cognitive state and changes in mortality on the 
overall change in life expectancy by cognitive state for edu-
cation groups, we then examine what would have happened 
if only one component changed and the other did not. To 
do this, we recompute the life tables using the observed 
data on prevalence of cognitive state or mortality for the 
two dates while the other is held constant at the 2000 level. 
We assess the effect of the change in the educational distri-
bution, on the change in cognitive life expectancy for the 
total population by computing the change using the distri-
butions of education by age and sex for the two dates and 
comparing the results.
Results
Education Differences in the Prevalence of Good 
Cognition, CIND, and Dementia
Good cognition characterizes the majority of people with 
at least a college education into their late 80s; for people 
with less than a high school education this is only evident 
up to ages in the 70s (Table 2 and Supplementary Tables 
S2 and S3). On the other hand, by age 90 dementia char-
acterizes more than half of women (53.4%) and more than 
a third of men (37.4%) with less than a high school edu-
cation which is two to three times the level in the college 
educated group at that age (28.1% for women and 12.8% 
for men) (Table 2).
Change in the prevalence of good cognition, CIND, and 
dementia by education
For the entire sample, the prevalence of dementia decreased 
and that of good condition increased in each age group 
from 2000 to 2010 for both males and females; however, 
the majority of the changes are not significant, although 
more changes were significant among women (four out 
of six age groups increased in prevalence of good cogni-
tion) than men (one out of six age groups increased in the 
prevalence of good cognition) (Supplementary Table S1). If 
we examine change within educational groups of men and 
women, between 2000 and 2010, there is no statistically 
significant change in the prevalence of dementia for most 
age-sex-education groups; only 2 out of 48 show a statisti-
cally significant decline (female ages 70–74 with college and 
above, and ages 80–84 with some college) (Supplementary 
Figure 1a and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). It is also 
evident that there is little significant change in the percent in 
good cognitive condition with only 3 out of the 48 groups 
S22

 experiencing a significant increase (male ages 70–74 with 
some college, female ages 70–74 with less than high school 
and ages 90+ with high school) (Supplementary Figure 1b 
and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).
Level and change in life expectancy by education
Life expectancy at age 65 increased for men and women 
in every education group over the 10-year period 
(Table 3). Increases for both men and women are great-
est among those with the most education (2.33 years for 
men and 1.45 years for women who completed college); 
and lowest for those with the least education (0.68 years 
for men and 0.66 years for women) (Table 3). Note that 
the improvement in life expectancy for older men with 
at least a college education is substantially greater than 
that for women. At age 85, there are also increases in 
life expectancy for every educational group (Table 4). 
They do not differ systematically by educational level; 
however, again males with the highest education have the 
greatest increase (1.18 years).
Education differences in life expectancy by cognitive state
At age 65, life expectancy with good cognition is substan-
tially higher among those with more education. In 2010, 
men and women with less than a high school education 
lived 7.50 years and 8.76 years on average, respectively, 
with good cognition; for those who graduated from college, 
years with good cognition were more than twice as long, 
16.71 for men and 17.92 for women (Table 3). On the other 
hand, years with dementia were much longer among those 
with low education. Among those with at least a college 
education, average years with dementia in 2010 were 0.77 
for men and 1.57 for women; for those with less than a high 
school education years spent with dementia were about 3 
times as long, 2.57 years for men and 4.12 years for women.
This pattern indicates that persons who graduated from 
high school can expect to live on average at least 70% of 
remaining life after age 65 with good cognition. Persons 
aged 65 years with a college degree or more can expect 
to spend more than 80% of their lifetime with good cog-
nition in 2010. However, persons with less than a high

 school education can expect to spend less than 50% of 
their remaining years with good cognition. Conversely, 
people who have graduated from college can expect to 
spend a small percent of life, on average, with dementia (in 
2010, 3.8% for men and 7.0% for women); and those with 
the lowest education can expect to spend a substantially 
greater portion of life with dementia (in 2010, 16.6% for 
men and 21.8% for women).
At age 85, there are similar differences in life expectancy 
by cognitive state (Table 4). Life expectancy with good cog-
nitive health is higher for those with a college education 
(in 2010, 3.85 for men and 3.52 for women with college 
education and 1.29 and 1.38 for men and women with less 
than a high school degree). For people with some college 
education or more, about 45% of life at age 85 is expected 
to be in good cognitive health; for those with less than a 
high school education this is only about 20%.
Expected years with dementia are two to three times 
larger at age 85 for those with the lowest level of education 
(in 2010, 2.16 for men and 3.50 for women) than for those 
with a college degree (0.65 for men and 1.48 for women). 
For those in the highest category of education, life expect-
ancy at age 85 with dementia is quite similar to that at age 
65 (e.g., in 2010, 0.65 vs 0.77 for men and 1.48 vs 1.57 for 
women with college education) meaning that most demen-
tia occurs after age 85. For those with the lowest levels of 
education, life expectancy with dementia at age 65 exceeds 
expected life with dementia at age 85, indicating younger 
dementia in this education group.
Change in life expectancy by cognitive state
At age 65 every education group for men and all but the 
lowest education group for women experienced a signifi-
cant increase between 2000 and 2010 in expected years 
of life with good cognition (Table 3 and Figure 1). The 
increase was greatest among those with the highest edu-
cation (1.51 years for men and 1.79 years for women) and 
lowest for those with the least education (0.66 years for 
men and 0.27 years for women).
Among women there was a significant decline over 
the 10 years in expected years with dementia at age 65 
for college graduates (−0.30) and for those who attended 
college (−0.24); for those with less education, there was 
no significant change. For men at age 65, two education 
groups experienced small but significant increases in life 
with dementia (0.12 for college graduates and 0.18 for 
high school graduates). In the other groups of males, years 
with dementia decreased significantly (−0.31 for those with 
some college and −0.39 for those with less than 12 years of 
schooling). These changes resulted in very little, and unsys-
tematic, change in the proportion of life in each of the three 
cognitive states within education group.
At age 85, life expectancy with good cognition increased 
significantly for women in each of the four education 
groups. At age 85, in no education group for males there 
was a significant change in life expectancy with good 
cognition. Life with dementia decreased significantly at age 
85 for women in two education groups and increased in 
one group; for men one group decreased significantly and 
one group increased.
Effects of change in mortality and in the prevalence of 
cognitive states
If the prevalence of cognitive state changed as it actually 
did between 2000 and 2010 for the education groups, 
but mortality held constant at the 2000 level (Figure 2a), 
most education groups would have seen little increase in 
life expectancy with good cognition. Among women with 
a college education, improvement would have been about 
a year less than our estimated change (Figure 1); while the 
improvement for college-educated men would have been 
about 1.5 years less. On the other hand, the decrease in 
Figure 1. Change from 2000 to 2010 in expectation of life at age 65 by 
cognitive state by education.
S25
Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2018, Vol. 73, No. S1
 average years with dementia would have been somewhat 
greater than observed.
If mortality changed within education group as observed 
between 2000 and 2010, but the prevalence of cognitive 
states by age and education held constant, length of life in 
all states would have increased and the improvement in life 
expectancy in good cognition would have been similar to 
what was actually observed (Figure 2b vs Figure 1). This 
implies that most of the improvement was due to lengthen-
ing life and the differentials by education in improvement 
were due to differences in life expectancy change.
Effect of change in educational composition on change in 
life expectancy with dementia for entire population
We noted at the beginning of our analysis that prior 
research has hypothesized that educational shifts in the 
population were one factor responsible for increases in life 
expectancy without dementia and decreases in life expec-
tancy with dementia. Using the life expectancies by educa-
tion and changes in the distribution of education shown 
in this study, we calculated that for men about half of the 
increase over 10 years in cognitively intact life expectancy 
(0.9 of 1.8 years) and half of the decrease in time with 
dementia (0.2 of 0.4 years) for the total population reflects 
the compositional shift toward higher education in the 
older population. For women the change is about a third 
(0.1 out of 0.3 and 0.5 out of 1.6).
Discussion
There are large differences in the prevalence of cognitive 
status by educational attainment in the older population. 
Persons with lower levels of education have a significantly 
higher prevalence of dementia. There are also large differ-
ences in the length and proportion of life spent with demen-
tia by education; with those with less education living more 
years and a greater proportion of their lives with dementia. 
While there was little significant change in the prevalence 
of cognitive status within education groups over the years 
from 2000 to 2010, the pattern was of declines in prevalence 
of dementia and increases in the prevalence of good cogni-
tion. On the other hand, there were significant increases in 
the life expectancy with good cognition after the age of 65 
for both men and women in all education groups except for 
women with the lowest education. The increases in years 
with good cognition were largest for those with the highest

 education and lowest for those with the least education, 
resulting in an expansion of the educational differential 
over the 10-year period. At age 85, the improvements in 
cognitively healthy life for women appeared to be greater 
than those for men across the educational range. This may 
have arisen from more consistent and larger reduction in 
the prevalence of dementia and increase in prevalence of 
good cognition among the oldest women.
The increase in life expectancy has been the primary rea-
son why there has been an increase in the length of life with 
good cognition over the decade for most sex-education 
groups. However, the small changes in the prevalence of 
cognitive states alone, without changes in mortality, were 
sufficient to cause reductions in life with dementia in the 
absence of mortality change for all education groups of 
women and two groups for men. These decreases alone 
would have resulted in declines in years with dementia 
larger than observed. Decreases in dementia prevalence did 
less to affect life expectancy with good cognition. Decreases 
in mortality, however, worked to increase life in all states, 
demented and cognitively healthy, and counterbalance the 
effects of decreases in dementia prevalence. The costs of 
mortality decline, if it occurs among those with and with-
out dementia, is that the length of life in all states, including 
with dementia, will increase.
There are limitations to our analysis. We are limited to 
the short time period that covers the availability of consist-
ent data on cognitive functioning, and we know from ana-
lysis of physical functioning that observations between two 
points may not reflect a long term trend (Freedman et al., 
2012). There are also features of the data that may affect 
our results. For instance, the decrease in the use of proxies 
could have an effect, although our assessment is that this is 
likely to be small and it resulted from attempts by HRS to 
increase self-response which was assumed to improve sur-
vey results. We also assume our ability to assign cognitive 
status is the same across educational groups, which may 
need further assessment. Finally, we are examining cogni-
tive status at a point in time, rather than change in cogni-
tive ability among individuals; this does not allow us to 
assume that all the cognitive differences between groups 
occurred because of changes late in life as there could be 
early life differences related to education and other fac-
tors contributing to the observed differences. Further work 
needs to examine change in cognition along with mortality 
using repeated longitudinal samples to get at the underlying 
processes determining the cross-sectional changes we have 
observed.
However, our study does provide an assessment of the 
size of the disparities by education, and the increase in dis-
parities, in the length of cognitively healthy and unhealthy 
life. Much of the increase in the differential length of 
healthy life by education is the result of the increasing dif-
ferentials in mortality by educational status. Higher educa-
tional status appears to provide lifelong cognitive benefits 
from both its effect on cognitive functioning and its effect 
on longer life. This analysis also confirms the important 
role that the changing distribution of education has had on 
improving the length of cognitively healthy life for the total 
population. The increases in differentials in healthy cogni-
tive life by education and the role of educational change in 
affecting overall population trends in prevalence of cogni-
tive health may be driven by cohort trends in education and 
the increasing association of education with a life that pro-
motes good health and good cognition across the life span.
