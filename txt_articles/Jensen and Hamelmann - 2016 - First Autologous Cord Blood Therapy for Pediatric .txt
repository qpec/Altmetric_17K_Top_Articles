Intracranial laceration due to traumatic birth injury is an extremely rare event affecting approximately one newborn per a
population of 4.5 million. However, depending on the mode of injury, the resulting brain damage may lead to lifelong sequelae,
for example, cerebral palsy for which there is no cure at present. Here we report a rare case of neonatal arterial ischemic stroke
and cerebral palsy caused by fetal traumatic molding and parietal depression of the head during delivery caused by functional
cephalopelvic disproportion due to a ‚Äúlong pelvis.‚Äù This patient was treated by autologous cord blood mononuclear cells (45.8 mL,
cryopreserved, TNC 2.53 √ó 10ùëí8) with a remarkable recovery. Active rehabilitation was provided weekly. Follow-up examinations
were at 3, 18, 34, and 57 months. Generous use of neonatal head MRI in case of molding, craniofacial deformity, and a sentinel
event during parturition is advocated to enhance diagnosis of neonatal brain damage as a basis for fast and potentially causative
treatment modalities including autologous cord blood transplantation in a timely manner.
1. Introduction
Traumatic birth injury with intracranial laceration is an
extremely rare event yielding a prevalence of only one new-
born per a population of 4.5 million per year [1]. However,
depending on the mode of injury, the resulting brain damage
may lead to lifelong sequelae, for example, cerebral palsy for
which there is no cure at present.
Here we report a rare case of neonatal arterial ischemic
stroke after fetal traumatic head depression caused by func-
tional cephalopelvic disproportion due to a ‚Äúlong pelvis‚Äù
[2] during a precipitate delivery in 2004. The girl (M.H.),
who was born vital with normal Apgar scores and normal
umbilical arterial pH, presented a massive craniofacial defor-
mity with depression of the left parietal bone and upper
left jaw (maxilla). After six months, there were first neuro-
logic anomalies. After 10 months right spastic hemiplegia
was diagnosed and an arterial ischemic infarction with a
porencephalic cyst in the central and paraventricular left
white matter was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). Regular physiotherapy and occupational therapy were
commenced on a weekly basis. At the age of five years, the
patient received a transplantation of autologous mononuclear
cells derived from her own umbilical cord blood that was
collected at birth and stored in a blood bank. The girl
recovered from hemiplegia to such an extent that she is
now able to participate in endurance city runs, obtained the
lifeguard certificate in swimming, rides two-wheel bicycle,
and plays piano using her affected right hand.
2. Case Presentation
2.1. Medical History. A primigravid pregnant woman at
term (I.H.), 33 years of age, was admitted after uneventful
pregnancy to a community hospital with light irregular labor
and shortening of the cervix. After preparation for delivery by
enema and warm bath, rupture of the membranes occurred
and hyperactive labor with strong contractions commenced.

Figure 1: MRI of the maternal pelvis (I.H.). (a) This MRI documents a ‚Äúlong pelvis‚Äù [2] with assimilated (fused) lumbar vertebral body to
form a sacral bone with an excessive vertebral body (arrow). (b) The ‚Äúlong pelvis‚Äù has 6 vertebral bones instead of the normal 5. In addition,
the 6 sacral bones in the ‚Äúlong pelvis‚Äù fail to be concave; rather they form a straight plane (indicated by the straight line), which reduces the
capacity of the mid-pelvis. (c) The pelvic inlet angle is < 90‚àò (angle I) in a ‚Äúlong pelvis‚Äù [2]. (d) The distance from the top of the 6th (excessive)
vertebral body to the end of the sacral bone in this ‚Äúlong pelvis‚Äù [2] is prolonged ((d), distance 135 mm) (3-Tesla, T1w TSE triplanar sequence).
First and second stage of labor only lasted approximately 2
hours, suggesting precipitate labor. The mother gave birth
to a seemingly healthy daughter with Apgar scores of 9, 10,
and 10 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively, and a normal
pH of 7.30 in the umbilical arterial blood. Fetal heart rate
(cardiotocography, CTG) was normal during the course of
labor.
The baby (M.H.) was born in a right occipitoanterior
vertex presentation with head circumference of 36 cm (>97th
percentile for girls [3]), length of 52 cm (>97th percentile),
and birth weight of 3290 grams (50th percentile). After
birth, the umbilical cord blood was collected for autologous
banking. Though vital, the newborn presented a massive
skull-facial deformity on the left side with depression of the
parietal and maxillary bones of the left upper jaw.
2.2. Maternal MRI Examination of the Pelvis. A MRI of the
maternal pelvis revealed an anomaly of the sacral bone, which
normally consists of five vertebral bodies, in that the 5th
lumbar vertebral body was assimilated (fused) to form a
sacral bone with an excessive 6th vertebral body (Figures
1(a) and 1(b)), increasing the distance between the top of
this excessive 6th vertebral body to the end of the last sacral
vertebra to 13.5 cm (Figure 1(d)). This so-called ‚Äúlong pelvis‚Äù
anomaly, named and described by Kirchhoff in 1949 [2], is
rare but well known. A ‚Äúlong pelvis‚Äù is causing obstetrical
problems in that the functional capacity of the pelvis inlet
is inadequate to allow the fetus to negotiate the birth canal.
Due to the high promontory, which is formed in this anomaly
by the 4th lumbar vertebral body, and thus due to the steep
pelvic inlet plane (angle I < 90‚àò, i.e., the ‚Äúopening angle of

the pelvis‚Äù [2], Figure 1(c)), the fetal head is forced to kink
the neck sideways to a greater extent than normal for head
engagement (angle II > 90‚àò, Figure 1(c)) so that the main
pressure gradient primarily impacts the left parietal fetal
bone in a right cephalic occipitotransverse presentation in
the pelvic inlet [2]. In addition, the sacral bones in a ‚Äúlong
pelvis‚Äù reduce the capacity of the mid-pelvis because they
fail to be concave; instead, the six sacral bones form a rather
straight plane, as is depicted in the MRI (Figures 1(a), 1(b),
1(c), and 1(d)). Given the large fetal head circumference of
36 cm (>97th percentile), the hampered engagement, and the
strong labor that forced the head onto the pubic arch (pelvic
inlet) and then through the birth canal, the depression of
the soft fetal left parietal bone is comprehensible. This birth
mechanism suggests excessive cephalic molding and hence a
traumatic functional cephalopelvic disproportion.
2.3. Neurologic Examinations. The routine examinations of
the newborn were normal in the first 4 months (U1‚ÄìU4)
except for the conspicuous faciocranial deformity. After six
months, there were first neurologic anomalies (deformity of
the right foot, asymmetric hand grip).
At 10 months of age, right spastic hemiplegic cerebral
palsy was diagnosed and MRI (08/26/2005) revealed a
periventricular arterial ischemic infarction with a poren-
cephalic cyst in the left central white matter and internal cap-
sule accompanied by an enlarged left lateral ventricle (Figures
2(a) and 2(b)). The cephalic deformity was conspicuous on
MRI along with a total volume reduction of 15 mL (3.3%)
in the left hemisphere as compared with the right (Figures
3(a) and 3(b)). Adding up the reduction of left hemispheric
white matter, the volume of the porencephalic lesion, and
the volume of the enlarged left ventricle (minus the volume
of the intact right ventricle), amounted to as much as 20%
(v/v), estimated total white matter loss by ischemic stroke
(Figures 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), and 6(d)). The location of the lesion,
affecting the left internal capsule with its long corticospinal
tracts passing through, explained the obvious increase in
muscular tone of the right upper and lower extremities, that
is, the spasticity of the patient.

Case Reports in Transplantation
The neurologic examination confirmed spastic hemiple-
gia with right adductor/extensor pattern in the lower and
adductor/flexor pattern in the upper extremity including
pronation and ulnar deviation of the flexed wrist, flexed
fingers forming a fist enclosing the adducted thumb, and
the arm flexed at the elbow. The right leg was extended and
adducted at the hip, slightly flexed at the knee, and plantar
flexed at the ankle with inversion and external rotation of
the foot. Active rolling from supine in prone position was
only possible over the left side. In prone position there
was supportive action of the right forearm with increased
spasticity in the leg and fist closure of the fingers. Passive
standing was possible, but marked equine position of the foot
and increased spasticity in the right leg contributed to the
difficulty in transferring weight onto the involved side and in
the acquisition of standing balance. On the left side, aimed
grip is swift and quick. On the right, there is delayed and
slow attempted grip movement with spread fingers; in most
cases object was not reached. Head circumference (MRI)
was 48.0 cm (>97th percentile). The mental development
was appropriate for age. In all, movement disorder with
unambiguous spastic hemiplegia on the left side was noted.
Intense physiotherapy and exclusion of thrombophilia were
recommended. After provision of an orthosis for the right
foot and ankle, free walking was possible at 15 months of age.
Thrombophilia was ruled out by blood tests.
At 2.8 years of age, occupational therapy reported nor-
mal receptive and expressive speech competence and social
behavior, self-confidence, curiosity, joyful playing and paint-
ing, recognition of colors, and the ability to concentrate on
tasks.
Fine motor function: the left hand compensated many
fine motor activities on the right, but clapping hands and
waving were possible. Some supportive action of the right
hand was noted. During falling, there was insufficient reflex
counter-response on the right side. There was also hemine-
glect on the right side.
Gross motor function: she had the ability to drive Bobby
car and to walk with leg orthosis and managed to walk on
slopes but presented an unsteady gait. She loved slides on the
playground. Overall she had improved fine and gross motor
function. She intended to attend the kindergarten.
2.4. Autologous Cord Blood Cell Transplantation. At 4.5 years
of age, the parents contacted the Campus Clinic Gynecology
Bochum to inquire about a potential individual treatment
with their daughter‚Äôs cord blood that had been collected at
birth and stored in a blood bank (Vita 34, Leipzig, Germany).
After written informed consent of the parents, autologous
cord blood transplantation was prepared to take place at
the Department of Pediatrics, Ruhr-University Bochum,
according to the German legal requirements (AMG ¬ß41(2)
[BGBl.1S.2631], guideline Bundes¬®
arztekammer) as described
previously [4, 5]. Identity cord blood unit/patient (CBU
ID-Number 10.02.86.55.1) was confirmed genetically (Gen.
number PEI G.03988.01.1).
The
neurologic
examination
before
transplantation
included EEG (10:20-system) and blood tests. There was no
evidence of epilepsy. The actual MRI (11/17/2009) confirmed
clear evidence for an ischemic stroke with a circumscribed
porencephalic cyst and minor gliosis in the left periventricu-
lar and central white matter with no evidence for residuals of
cerebral hemorrhage (hemosiderin) (Figures 4(a), 4(b), 4(c),
and 4(d)). The patient was shy and spoke little. There was
spastic hemiplegia on the right side with increased muscle
tone in the upper and lower extremities with emphasis on the
upper limb. There was no monopodal jumping on the right
side; only brief monopodal standing was possible. Pigeon
toes on the right side internally rotated. Circumduction gait
was noticed on the right hip joint. Babinski sign was positive
on the right side but negative on the left side. There were
no contractures, but there was slight convex scoliosis on the
right side. Right arm flexed at the elbow, and pronation of
the flexed wrist and slight flexion of the fingers with slight
reduction of fine motor ability and strength were noticed, but
segmental alternating finger movements were possible. There
was hemineglect on the right side. Deep tendon reflexes
(BSR, RPR, and PSR) were hyperactive on the right side, ASR
was noticed on the right side also, and the same was found
on the left side. Taken together, there was mild to moderate
right spastic hemiplegia with comparatively minor spasticity
in the lower extremity (body weight 26 kg (<97th percentile),
height 123 cm (>97th percentile)).
The cord blood unit (CBU) contained 45.8 mL blood,
cryopreserved by 6.0% DMSO (w/v), with a total nucle-
ated cell count (TNC) of 2.53 √ó 10ùëí8 mononuclear cells
without erythroblasts, but including 0.72 √ó 10ùëí6 CD34+
(15.8/mL), and 0.23 √ó 10ùëí6 colony forming cells (CFC) (vital-
ity 84.4%, hemoglobin 91.8 [mg/mL]). After premedication
(Dimetindene Maleate 1 mg i.v., ranitidine 20 mg i.v.), the
CBU was washed (Sepax S100, Biosafe, Switzerland), volume
reduced, and erythrocyte depleted, and the separated unma-
nipulated autologous mononuclear cells (1 √ó 10ùëí7/kg body
weight) were transplanted intravenously over 15 minutes
(150 mL/h). No adverse effects were noted and monitoring
was continued for 24 hours. The patient was discharged and
physiotherapy and occupational therapy were provided on
a weekly basis. Follow-up was at 3, 18, 34, and 57 months
after the transplantation of autologous mononuclear cells,
respectively.
2.5. Outcome. Following cord blood treatment, there were
some remarkable changes in motor development.
After three months, the patient presented self-conscious-
ness and curiosity, knew all letters, wrote her name, solved
easy arithmetic problems in the range one to ten, and
attended a swimming course as well as the kindergarten.
She used the right hand on demand to hold a spoon or a
fork, but daily routine was accomplished generally with the
left hand including writing. Lower leg orthosis and left shoe
inlay to compensate for leg length difference (1.5‚Äì2.0 cm)
were used. During slow concentrated walking, heel-to-toe
movement of the centrally positioned foot was possible. Fast
walking and running was also possible, but external rotation
of the right arm was noted. Left heel walking was better

than the right one. Walking on tiptoes on both sides was
possible. Monopodal standing on the right (affected) leg
was improved, though still presenting slight spastic paresis.
Monopodal jumping using the right side was not possible.
Slow alternating movements of the right hand were possible.
Only minimal alternating finger movements on the right side
were observed during high concentration. Slow pincer grip,
grasping an object with all fingers, and hand opening were
possible, but there was a tendency for pronation and internal
rotation of the wrist. Babinski sign on the right side was
positive and that on the left side was negative. The patient
concentrated and was motivated during examination. Muscle
tone in the right leg was only slightly increased. No significant
difference in muscle strength between right and left was
noted.
After 18 months, there was further intellectual and motor
function improvement on the affected side. The patient solved
arithmetic tasks in the range of 1 to 100. She showed good
social behavior but was reluctant to share. The patient entered
primary school and there was no evidence of mental retarda-
tion. She learned to ride a bicycle and there were independent
walking and running with orthosis and reduced hemineglect.
Monopodal standing on the right side was shortened, but
standing jump was possible. Monopodal jumping on the
right side was not possible. Right finger-to-nose-test and
finger-to-finger-test were slow, but possible. Muscle reflexes
were similar on both sides but reflex zones enlarged. The
patient was pleasant, talked in full sentences, and met all
requirements.
On MRI examination, 18 months after transplantation
and at almost seven years of age, there was still a conspicuous
depression of the patient‚Äôs brain as evidenced in Figure 5
and the residuals of ischemic arterial stroke left including
porencephalic cyst with only minor gliosis and enlarged left
ventricle were largely unchanged as compared with the MRI
before transplantation (Figures 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), and 6(d)).
After 34 months and at almost eight years of age, the
patient presented further progress. There were reduced usage

of orthosis, intensive swimming, frequent grasping with the
right hand, and improved right muscle strength and she
was binding shoelaces and having high grades at school.
There was a slight residual spastic hemiplegia on the right
side, insecure monopodal jumping, and monopodal standing
on the right leg. Independent walking and hand usage
were further improved. Though still wearing orthosis, the
patient rode bicycle, learned to swim, and learned to play
keyboard. Developmental psychology testing revealed an IQ
score of 105, slightly above average (Hamburg-Wechsler Test,
HAWIK-IV). Overall, there was tangible progress.
After 57 months, at the age of 11, and 5.5 years after
autologous cord blood transplantation, the patient presented
a minor neurologic residual syndrome on the right side, but
now she preferred to use the right hand for daily routine with
only minimally reduced fine motor control, enjoyed horse-
back riding, entered jogging competition without orthosis
(3 km city run), earned a lifeguard certificate in swimming
and diving (German Lifesaving Organisation (DLRG), gold
badge), and played piano using both hands. Except for the
running competitions, the patient is still wearing orthosis
and awaits a transposition osteotomy to become independent
of it. There is still a slightly reduced sensitivity and fine
motor control of the foot and no walking on tiptoes or heels,
perhaps due to the weight gain >99th percentile (63 kg, BMI
24 kg/m2), along with a certain weakness on the affected side.
However, rehabilitation was extraordinarily successful
with activities in music, sports, full social integration among
peers, and high grades at school (5th grade, secondary
school). In age adjusted developmental psychology testing the
patient now scored an IQ of 112 (>75 percentile, Hamburg-
Wechsler Test, HAWIK-IV).
3. Discussion
We report a rare case of traumatic neonatal ischemic
stroke with hemiplegic cerebral palsy caused by functional
cephalopelvic disproportion and parietal head depression
due to a ‚Äúlong pelvis‚Äù of the mother [2] that was treated with
autologous cord blood mononuclear cells [6]. The ischemic
stroke resulted from a traumatic occlusion of a penetrating
thalamostriatal tributary of the left middle cerebral artery
supplying the white matter beyond the basal ganglia, a unique
feature of the developing brain [7]. During parturition the
pressure gradient on the parietal bone and the depression
were obviously sufficient to kink and/or occlude one of these
small penetrating thalamostriatal arterial tributaries of the
left middle cerebral artery that‚Äîunlike in the adult‚Äîprovide
vascular supply to the paraventricular white matter beyond
the basal ganglia [7].
Due to the anatomical fact that long corticospinal nerve
tracts originating from the motor cortex, which represents
the whole body motor function, pass through the periven-
tricular region and internal capsule supplied by this thalam-
ostriatal tributary, the neurologic sequelae match the injured
tracts resulting in isolated hemiplegia of the upper and lower
extremities in this case.
As we have shown previously in an acute perinatal
cerebral hypoxic-ischemia model in newborn rats [8, 9],
mononuclear cells derived from human cord blood show a
highly specific ‚Äúhoming‚Äù and migrate into the lesioned region
of the brain in large numbers within 24 hours when given
intraperitoneally [9, 10]. This chemotactic process is mediated
in part by stromal-derived factor- (SDF-) 1, a chemokine
that is expressed in the lesioned brain, and transplanted
human umbilical cord blood cells expressing the SDF-1
receptor CXCR4 migrate to the lesioned site [11]. Thus, neu-
rotrophic (e.g., BDNF, VEGF), synaptotrophic (e.g., NGF),
anti-inflammatory (e.g., Il-6, Il-8, and Il-10), antigliotic (e.g.,
Cx43), antiapoptotic, and proangiogenic neuroregenerative
effects are entrained resulting in significant functional neu-
roregeneration [12‚Äì16]. The beneficial effects of cord blood
mononuclear cells observed after acute brain damage caused
by hypoxic-ischemia include reduced spastic paresis and
recovery of gross motor function, fine motor coordination,
muscle strength, somatosensory cortical processing, and, as
observed in children, recovery of cognition, vision, and active
and receptive speech competence [4, 6, 9, 11, 13]. To what
extent these processes may be involved in neuroregeneration
after late transplantation of autologous cord blood mononu-
clear cells as in the present case remains to be established in
further systematic clinical research.
Though causality is impossible to establish, there is clin-
ical and experimental evidence to support the view that the
patient‚Äôs functional neuroregeneration observed particularly
in the upper right extremity after ischemic stroke may be in
part mediated by therapeutic effects of autologous cord blood
mononuclear cells along with intense physiotherapy and
occupational therapy. Of note is the delayed transplantation
of the mononuclear cells approximately 5 years after the
insult, and it may be argued that in this case the balance of
evidence suggests rather a spontaneous recovery from stroke
than a therapeutic effect of cell treatment. Of course, this view
cannot be rebutted in an individual treatment and most of the
experimental evidence votes for early intervention; however,
there already exists clinical evidence for successful treatment
of cerebral palsy using autologous [6, 17] and allogeneic [18]
cord blood several years after the insult. The mechanisms
involved in therapeutic effects after delayed mononuclear
cell treatment still await elucidation. Particularly, the acute

inflammatory response and chemotactic SDF-1 expression,
important for the ‚Äúhoming‚Äù of the cells to the lesion, are likely
to have ceased by that time of transplantation. Also, long-
acting inflammatory responses after brain damage promoting
‚Äúhoming‚Äù after late cord blood transplantation have not been
described as yet. However, notably, the blood-brain barrier
disruption after traumatic brain injury is an early event that
may persist for many years in humans [19]. This may explain
in part as to why therapeutic effects are observed even after
late transplantation of mononuclear cells derived from cord
blood.
To our knowledge, this is the first published report
on an individual autologous cord blood treatment of a
pediatric ischemic arterial stroke and cerebral palsy caused
by traumatic skull depression in the neonate during delivery
on the basis of a ‚Äúlong pelvis‚Äù in the mother [2].
Interestingly, there was isolated white matter damage
causing exclusive motor deficits in a child with fully devel-
oped mental, intellectual, social, and emotional capacities
enabling her to excel at school performance. This is particu-
larly noteworthy, because there was a significant hemispheric
volume reduction on the affected left side by 15 mL (‚àí3.3%)
as compared to the right side, indicative of degeneration of
neurones while the head circumference (MRI) at 10 months
of age continued to be > 97th percentile (48 cm, [20]).
Adding up the reduction in left hemispheric white matter
by the lesion and the enlarged ventricle amounted to as
much as 20% estimated total white matter loss by ischemic
stroke. In the developing brain, it is known that hypoxic-
ischemia is followed by retrograde and antegrade ‚ÄúWallerian‚Äù
transsynaptic degeneration of (e.g., subplate) neurones [21].
Thus, the total loss of neuronal tissue following ischemic
stroke is high and renders the degree of the patient‚Äôs motor
recovery in the absence of mental delay in spite of late cell
therapy particularly remarkable.
Hypoxic-ischemic brain lesions have recently been suc-
cessfully treated in human newborns and children by autol-
ogous human cord blood mononuclear cells, demonstrating
that this novel treatment modality is safe and efficacious
[4‚Äì6, 17, 22, 23]. However, it seems important to combine
cell treatment with intense physiotherapy and occupational
therapy for maximum effect [4]. In the present case, par-
ticularly supportive for a successful rehabilitation were the
absence of any mental and intellectual deficits and the high
level of cognitive, language, and communication abilities.
Thus, the patient‚Äôs rehabilitation culminated in the ability to
 8

perform endurance runs, practicing lifeguard swimming on
premier level, and playing piano using her affected hand with
dexterity.
A maternal ‚Äúlong pelvis‚Äù is rare [2] and an isolated
occlusion of a small thalamostriatal artery by depression
of both the parietal skull and the infant‚Äôs temporal brain
is extremely rare. However, craniofacial deformation and
molding of the head of newborns is a comparatively frequent
observation, which is currently considered normal‚Äîa fact
that merits reconsideration [24].
Given the facts that (1) 40% of the newborns presenting
neonatal stroke are asymptomatic, (2) stroke is among the
top ten causes of death in childhood [25‚Äì27], and (3)
50‚Äì85% of survivors of stroke will be left with long-term
problems (e.g., seizures, physical disability, and speech or
learning difficulties), a different management of children
born with significant molding of the head and/or other
sentinel events during birth seems mandatory. Generous
usage of appropriate imaging techniques, particularly of head
MRI, must be employed to reduce the false negative detection
rate of neonatal stroke. In spite of the low prevalence of
the condition, the resulting years lived with both physical
and intellectual disability (YLDs) after pediatric stroke are a
significant global burden [28].
Thus, neonatal cephalic molding during birth and head
deformity particularly when combined with sentinel events
during parturition require further examination of the head
by MRI for early diagnosis of neonatal brain damage as a
basis for a causative treatment of imminent cerebral palsy in
a timely manner, for example, by autologous cord blood cell
therapy.
