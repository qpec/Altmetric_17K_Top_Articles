Abstract: Since the Seven Countries Study, dietary cholesterol and the levels of serum cholesterol
in relation to the development of chronic diseases have been somewhat demonised. However,
the principles of the Mediterranean diet and relevant data linked to the examples of people living in
the five blue zones demonstrate that the key to longevity and the prevention of chronic disease
development is not the reduction of dietary or serum cholesterol but the control of systemic
inflammation. In this review, we present all the relevant data that supports the view that it is
inflammation induced by several factors, such as platelet-activating factor (PAF), that leads to the
onset of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) rather than serum cholesterol. The key to reducing the
incidence of CVD is to control the activities of PAF and other inflammatory mediators via diet,
exercise, and healthy lifestyle choices. The relevant studies and data supporting these views are
discussed in this review.

1. Introduction
1.1. Biological Signifi
cance of Cholesterol—Circulating Blood Cholesterol
Cholesterol, an unsaturated alcohol of the steroid family, is essential for the normal function of
all animal cells. It is also a fundamental element for the normal structural makeup and the fluidity
of all cell membranes. Cholesterol interacts with phospholipid bilayers in the cell membrane and
increases membrane packing. Cholesterol also takes part in signal transduction, intracellular transport,
nerve conduction, and signalling pathways through lipid rafts and caveolae. Cholesterol has various
other biological functions, i.e., it is a precursor molecule for several biochemical pathways such as
the synthesis of vitamin D, steroid hormones (e.g., cortisol, aldosterone, and adrenal androgens),
and sex hormones (e.g., testosterone, oestrogens, and progesterone). Cholesterol is also a constituent
of bile salts, which are crucial constituents of digestion, as they facilitate the absorption of lipids, fats,
and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K [1].
Since cholesterol is mostly a lipophilic molecule, it does not dissolve well in blood. For this
reason, it is packed into lipoproteins that are composed of a lipid core (which can contain
cholesterol esters and triglycerides) and a hydrophilic outer membrane comprising phospholipids,
apolipoprotein, and free cholesterol. This allows for the transport of the nonpolar lipid molecules
such as cholesterol and triglycerides around the body through the blood to cells that require them.
Plasma lipoproteins are separated into five major classes: chylomicrons, very-low-density lipoproteins
(VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and high-density
lipoproteins (HDL) [1,2].
Cholesterol can enter the blood through the digestion of dietary fat via chylomicrons. However,
since cholesterol has an important role in cellular function, it can also be directly synthesised by each

cell in the body. Notably, LDL particles are thought to act as a major transporter of cholesterol to the
peripheral tissues, as at least two-thirds of circulating cholesterol resides in LDL. Conversely, HDL
molecules are thought to do the opposite. They take excess cholesterol and return it to the liver for
excretion [1,2].
Recent evidence suggests that dietary intake of cholesterol can influence plasma and serum levels,
but not significantly. However, this is still subject to debate and further study [3]. Plasma cholesterol
levels along with the levels of LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and serum triglycerides are currently
used as biomarkers of the so-called standard ‘lipid profile’ for each individual. The standard lipid
profile has been widely used as a traditional biomarker, not only for cardiovascular health but also for
other lipid-related abnormalities and disorders [4].
1.2. Cholesterol Levels: Demonising a Risk Factor but Not the Causative Mechanisms of Chronic Diseases
Several modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors (genetic, environmental, nutrition, and lifestyle, etc.)
are thought to influence the balance between health and disease by inducing mechanisms related to
disease onset, development, and the manifestations of symptoms. The presence or coexistence of these
risk factors seem to trigger underlying molecular and cellular mechanistic pathways that can lead to
continuous chronic manifestations and the long-term loss of tissue homoeostasis and tissue dysfunction.
These continuous chronic manifestations can develop over time before cellular disturbances manifest
and cause tissue disorders, while, if not counterbalanced by our immune system and by specific
preventive measures such as a healthy diet and lifestyle, the subsequent symptomatic disease finally
appears, and medical treatment may be required to reduce the risk of mortality. Elucidating these
molecular and cellular mechanistic pathways and acquiring the mechanistic evidence of the underlying
multifactorial causes of a chronic disease can lead to suitable preventive targets against these diseases
with fewer side effects, which is an ongoing difficult and demanding task. Such difficulties have
misled the scientific and medical community to often and lightly extrapolate the easily acquired
observed statistical and epidemiological correlations of traditional risk factors to several chronic
diseases, towards matching these risk factors as the causative agents of these diseases.
According to the ‘cholesterol hypothesis’, high blood cholesterol is a major risk factor, while
lowering cholesterol levels can reduce risk [5].
Dyslipidaemias (i.e., hypercholesterolaemia or
hyperlipidaemia) are abnormalities of lipid metabolism characterised by increased circulating levels of
serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and decreased levels of serum HDL cholesterol.
High levels of LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol have been associated with cardiovascular risk,
while other cholesterol-related serum markers, such as the small dense LDL cholesterol, lipoprotein(a),
and HDL particle measurements, have been proposed as additional significant biomarkers for CVD
risk factors to add to the standard lipid profile [6]. HDL cholesterol has been considered as the
atheroprotective ‘good’ cholesterol because of its strong inverse correlation with the progression of
CVD [7]; however, it is the functionality of HDL cholesterol, rather than its concentration that is more
important for the preventative qualities of HDL cholesterol in CVD. In general, dyslipidaemias have
been ranked as significant modifiable risk factors contributing to prevalence and severity of several
chronic diseases including aging, hypertension, diabetes, and CVD. High serum levels of these lipids
have been associated with an increased risk of developing atherosclerosis [8].
Furthermore, dyslipidaemias have been characterised by several studies not only as a risk
factor but as a “well-established and prominent cause” of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
worldwide [9]. Even though such an extrapolation is not adequate, it was, however, not surprising that
this was made, because since the term arteriosclerosis was first introduced by pioneering pathologists
of the 19th century, it has long been believed that atherosclerosis merely involved the passive
accumulation of cholesterol into the arterial walls for the formation of foam cells. This process
was considered the hallmark of atherosclerotic lesions and subsequent CVD. Moreover, one-sided
interpretations of several epidemiological studies, such as the Seven Countries Study (SCS), have
highlighted outcomes that mostly concerned correlations between saturated fat intake, fasting blood

cholesterol concentrations, and coronary heart disease mortality [10–13].
Such epidemiological
correlations between dyslipidaemias and atherosclerosis led to the characterisation of atherosclerosis
as primarily a lipid disorder, and the “lipid hypothesis” was formed, which would dominate thinking
for much of the 20th century.
In the clinical setting, in order to address the lipid hypothesis, the levels of cholesterol related
plasma lipoproteins and triglycerides (lipid profile) have been used as traditional biomarkers for
cardiovascular risk, but also for dietary and treatment guideline designs [5]. Dietary and medical
guidelines have focused on the reduction of cholesterol and lipid levels as the best way to prevent
chronic diseases such as CVD [5,9]. Such guidelines suggest the application of statin therapies in
order to reduce the levels of cholesterol (through inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors); however, numerous side effects have been reported, including the development
of other chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus [14]. Moreover, specific dietary strategies for
reducing cholesterol intake are the mainstay of management in most cases of dyslipidaemia, prior to,
or simultaneously with, the initiation of a lipid lowering agent [9]. Dietary fats, cholesterol, and the
levels of serum cholesterol in relation to the development of CVD have been somewhat demonised.
On the other hand, since cholesterol is an essential biomolecule for the normal function of all
our cells, an emerging question has recently surfaced: “how much do we need to lower the levels of
cholesterol”? Furthermore, given the fact that cholesterol plays a crucial role in several of our cellular
and tissue mechanisms, it is not surprising that there are several consequences due to the aggressive
reduction of cholesterol levels in the body, which has been common practice over the last few decades.
In addition, targeting cholesterol and fat intake by introducing diets with low-fat products and by
reducing the intake of high-fat foods can lead to less absorption and lower bioavailability of other
lipids containing high value nutrients, such as several lipid soluble vitamins (especially vitamin D) and
other lipid molecules. Such lipids have exhibited a plethora of beneficial bioactivities, not only related
to reducing the risk of chronic diseases but also through a wide range of important bio-functionalities
and anti-inflammatory properties [3]. Therefore, lower cholesterol levels do not equate to better health,
or to lower risk of chronic diseases such as CVD. Homeostasis must be maintained, even with regard
to cholesterol, both HDL and LDL [15].
Moreover, recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have started to question the validity of
the lipid hypothesis, as there is lack of an association or an inverse association between LDL cholesterol
and both all-cause and CVD mortality in the elderly [15] and several cancers such as lung, prostate,
and breast cancer [16–18]. Such studies provide the rationale for more research about the causes (and
not only the risk factors) of chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, CVD, and cancer, but also for
a re-evaluation of the guidelines for cardiovascular prevention, in particular because the benefits of
statin treatments have been exaggerated [15].
Statistical and epidemiological extrapolations often lack fully clarified biochemical mechanistic
evidence, while associations and correlations do not necessarily mean causation.
In addition,
a follow-up by systematic reviews and meta-analyses often present contradictory outcomes against the
initial results that were introduced by early stage epidemiological studies lacking consistency, biological
gradient, and coherence. Thus, such extrapolations can lead to one-sided, premature targeting of risk
factors accompanied with consequences, often without the desirable outcomes. Targeting a risk factor
such as high serum cholesterol may decrease the probabilities for a disease, but usually cannot prevent
the causation of chronic diseases.
1.3. Revisiting the Lipid Hypothesis: Outcomes of the Mediterranean Diet against Inflammation
Previous epidemiological and observational studies, such as the SCS in which the lipid hypothesis
was mostly based, have been re-evaluated. For example, even though within the SCS the strength
of the association between serum cholesterol and cardiovascular mortality were similar in different
cultures, the absolute risks differed substantially. Kromhout reported that at a serum cholesterol
level of 200 mg/dL, the 25-year cardiovascular mortality rate was five times higher in the Northern
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 604
4 of 38
European populations of the SCS compared to the Southern Mediterranean populations [19], and thus
the relations between diet, serum cholesterol, and cardiovascular mortality are more complex than
originally thought. This is because it is not only dietary cholesterol involved, but other lipids and
antioxidants may play a role in the onset and prevention of atherosclerosis [19]. Such a low prevalence
of cardiovascular mortality in the Mediterranean cohorts of SCS is now attributed to their lifestyle
and especially to their dietary habits, namely the traditional Mediterranean diet (Med-diet) [10,20].
A common feature of the diet amongst populations in the Mediterranean is a relatively high dietary
intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, monounsaturated fats, and nuts, followed
by moderate consumption of fish, dairy products (mainly cheese and yogurt), alcohol, and low
consumption of red and processed meats [21].
The major outcomes of the SCS and other similar epidemiological studies (i.e., studies trying
to decipher the ‘French Paradox’ [22]) concerning the protective effects of dietary patterns, such as
the Med-diet against chronic diseases, were initially either neglected or misinterpreted. CVD and
cardiovascular mortality occurred in much relatively lower rates in the Southern European populations
(i.e., Italy and Greece) despite a rather high dietary intake of saturated fats and cholesterol [10,20,23].
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that Med-diet can actually reduce the incidence
of cardiovascular events, breast cancer, and type II diabetes mellitus, without any restriction on fat
intake [24].
Over the last 2 years there has been a significant number of studies referring to adoption of the
Med-diet pattern and its associated beneficial outcomes in a plethora of several chronic diseases that
are either directly or indirectly related to inflammation. These studies refer to heart failure, CVD [25],
cancer [26,27], obesity [28], metabolic syndrome [29–31], diabetes [31–34], and other subsequent
manifestations such as diabetic retinopathy [35], asthma [36], autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis [37], incident frailty risk [38], non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [39,40], inflammatory bowel
disease [41], cognitive health, the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia [42–44], and age-related
macular degeneration [45].
In addition, the Med-diet has also been associated with beneficial outcomes, even in secondary
CVD prevention [46]. When patients suffering from CVD or diabetes follow the Mediterranean
dietary pattern, the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events is reduced.
The protective effect of this dietary pattern can be maintained for up to four years after the first
infarction (Lyon Diet Heart Study) [47]. Moreover, in contrast to the contradictions of lipid hypothesis
and mortality in elderly people [15], the HALE project has also shown that individuals aged 70 to
90 years following a Med-diet and healthy lifestyle have a 50% lower rate of all-cause and cause-specific
mortality [48]. Followers of the Med-diet are also less likely to suffer sudden cardiac death and
age-related cognitive decline [49].
The inverse association between Med-diet and all causes of diseases and cardiovascular-mortality
has been attributed to several of its pleiotropic protective effects. For instance, the Med-diet can
beneficially influence several risk factors such as lowering BMI, blood pressure, reducing insulin
resistance, reducing lipid levels (i.e., the ratio of cholesterol/HDL cholesterol), and improving
HDL-cholesterol functionality [50–54]. However, the main beneficial impact of Med-diet is on the
improvement of endothelial function and the decrease of the inflammatory milieu, inflammation-related
mediators, biomarkers such as platelet-activating factor (PAF), and several cytokines. It is also
suggested that there is an improvement of oxidative stress, with lower concentrations of oxidised
LDL and improved apolipoprotein profiles, and, finally, there is evidence of beneficial effects against
platelet aggregation and blood coagulation [3,55–58].
The overall outcomes and beneficial effects of Med-diet have radically shifted the attention from
the lipid-centric model that is characterised by the desired reduction of cholesterol levels to more
effective targeting against the factual causative factors of chronic diseases, which are inflammation
and its related manifestations. Prevention is key to reducing global mortality due to chronic diseases
such as CVD; therefore, it is imperative to separate the underlying causes and processes of the disease

from the risk factors and symptoms of disease. The clarification of the key roles and interplay of
various cells, inflammatory mediators, and pathways during chronic inflammatory manifestations
related to the onset of several chronic diseases is of great importance and may lead to a plethora of
novel potential targets for fine-tuning of the inflammatory response during the chronic smouldering of
inflammation that characterises these disorders.
2. Re-Discovering Chronic Inflammation as the Cause for Chronic Diseases
Inflammation is a physiological reaction of the innate immune system that maintains a constant
internal milieu while being exposed to continuously changing environmental pressures, irrespective of
whether the initial causes originate from mechanical, physical, chemical, infectious, immunological,
or reactive natural traumatic injury or metabolic dysfunction. The inflammatory response aims
to reduce the agent that causes tissue injury and/or minimise these effects, to induce appropriate
wound healing and to restore tissue homeostasis. Inflammatory responses are initiated by innate
sensing mechanisms that detect the presence of microbial infection, stressed or dying cells, loss of
cellular integrity, barrier breach, etc. A cascade of inflammatory pathways and mechanistic effects is
supposedly well-orchestrated by the immune system in order to eradicate the causative agent.
Several immune cells can change their number, morphology, and nature depending on the stage
and type of inflammation. Biochemically, inflammation is denoted by a local increase of numerous
tissue hormones, transmitters, complement components, cytokines, and lipid mediators such as PAF
and eicosanoids. Most of these products are autacoids that are synthesised at the site of inflammation
in order to resolve the inflammatory process by removing or inhibiting the actions of the triggering
agent [8]. Provided that the immune response succeeds in eliminating the infectious agent or to repair
the initial tissue injury, the inflammatory process will be terminated in a timely fashion and thus only
affects tissue function transiently.
However, in cases where the inflammation fails to resolve due to the persistence of the
triggering agent or due to unsuccessful repair of the initial tissue injury or dysfunction, a sustained
underlying inflammatory process develops, leading to further tissue dysfunction and detrimental
consequences. Several traditional and emerging risk factors are thought to influence our health and,
especially, inflammation-related chronic diseases, by their interrelation with underlying molecular
and cellular manifestations that result in chronic inflammatory responses leading to the loss of
tissue homoeostasis and dysfunction. Apart from dyslipidaemias, other well-established risk factors
include hypertension, diabetes, smoking, excessive food intake, previous infections (influenza, oral
pathogens) or underlying autoimmune diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, pollution,
and genetic abnormalities [59]. It is now well established that a common junction of such risk
factors is chronic and unresolved inflammatory manifestations. Inflammation that causes endothelial
dysfunction seems to be the key causative underlying mechanistic player, at the molecular and cellular
level, for the onset and development of subsequent inflammation-related chronic disorders such
as atherosclerosis and subsequent CVD, ischemic and renal disorders, cancer metastasis, diabetes,
infections, and comorbidities [8,57–62].
For example, in cases of dyslipidaemia, increased cholesterol levels are not the causative agent or
the underlying biochemical mechanism responsible for endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis
development. The accumulation of excess plasma LDL cholesterol is addressed by the innate immune
system as an undesired event. Therefore, an inflammatory response at the endothelial wall is promoted
to reduce the threat by the removal of excess LDL and oxidised-LDL (Ox-LDL) cholesterol from the
blood stream to the subendothelium, where they are engulfed by comigrated monocytes for final
removal [63,64]. During chronic inflammatory diseases, inflammation and infections can also induce
a variety of alterations in lipid metabolism, including decreases in serum HDL cholesterol, increases in
triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), and LDL levels. These changes of the lipid levels may initially dampen
inflammation or fight infection; however, the sustained inflammation can contribute to the increased
risk of atherosclerosis [65]. In addition to affecting serum lipid levels, inflammation also adversely
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 604
6 of 38
effects lipoprotein function; LDL is more easily oxidised, as the ability of HDL to prevent the oxidation
of LDL is diminished, while several steps in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway are also adversely
affected during inflammation. The greater the severity of the underlying inflammatory disease,
the more consistently these abnormalities in lipids and lipoproteins are observed [65]. Thus, it is not
serum cholesterol and lipoproteins that influence the endothelium but the inflammatory response that
affects the well integrity and functionality of the endothelium.
Apart from the effects of inflammation on plasma lipids, it is now well established that more
important soluble and cellular immune factors associated with chronic inflammation can promote
inflammation-related endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis, either during dyslipidaemia or
independently of dyslipidaemia [66]. Even though atherosclerosis and CVD were previously viewed
as lipid storage disorders, we now recognise that inflammation drives much of endothelial dysfunction
and mechanisms of clinical complications with these diseases and related comorbidities, such as
sepsis [67,68], human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [69–74], periodontal diseases [75–77],
kidney disorders [78–81], healthy ageing, and inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as systemic
lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, independently of traditional cardiovascular risk factors
such as serum lipid levels [66,82,83].
Inflammation plays a key role in all stages of the formation of vascular lesions maintained
and exacerbated by several risk factors such as unhealthy diet and lifestyle,
smoking,
hyperlipidaemia/hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, etc. The consequence
of chronic inflammation is endothelial dysfunction that sets in, and we can define it as an integrated
marker of the damage to arterial walls by classic risk factors. Endothelial dysfunction is usually
characterised by an inflammation-related milieu acting on leukocytes and endothelial cells,
through an interplay with other immune cells such as T lymphocytes, mast cells, dendritic cells
(DC), and platelets [57,58,66,84,85]. The orchestrated overexpression and increased production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines occurs, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and
its receptor, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), type I interferons (IFN-α, IFN-β), adhesion
molecules, chemokines, and lipid inflammatory mediators such as PAF and eicosanoids. Other linked
events include the increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the increased oxidation of
LDL cholesterol, and the reduction of protective nitric oxide levels.
Therefore, the mechanistic pathways and key players implicated in the inflammatory crosstalk
taking place throughout the onset, development, and progression of chronic diseases is of great
importance, in order to unravel putative preventive and therapeutic targets with less side effects.
The inverse effects of the Med-diet with chronic diseases is mostly related to the pleiotropic
effects and interplay of its food constituents on all these inflammation-related pathways; following
a Mediterranean dietary pattern leads to the reduction of several inflammatory mediators and
biomarkers related to the endothelial functionality, such as decreases in hsCRP, IL-6, and intracellular
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) [27].
3. The Role of PAF in Chronic Diseases and the Beneficial Effects of the Mediterranean Diet
3.1. PAF Structure, Activities, and Metabolism: The Role of PAF
3.1.1. PAF Structure and Physiological Roles
PAF is a potent lipid inflammatory mediator with pleiotropic effects that are implicated in several
chronic diseases [57]. The classic PAF molecule is characterised by an alkyl ether linkage at the sn-1
position, an acetyl group at the sn-2 position, and a phosphocholine group at the sn-3 position of
glycerol backbone (1-O-alkyl-2-sn-acetyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine, [86]) (Figure 1A). These three
structural features are all equally important requisites for the optimal biological activity of PAF,
mediated by its stereospecific binding to its specific receptor [87,88]. Because of the ether linkage at
the sn-1 position, the classic molecule of PAF is an unusual lipid, as such moieties are not common
in animals, nor is it common to find the acetic acid esterified directly to glycerol at the sn-2 position.
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 604

Thus, it seems that PAF was chosen by evolution to participate in specific functions in several of
our cells, tissues, organs, and throughout the body. PAF was the first intact phospholipid known to
have messenger functions by binding to a specific receptor on the cell membrane, and not simply via
physicochemical effects on the plasma membrane of the target cell [79].

messenger functions by binding to a specific receptor on the cell membrane, and not simply via 
physicochemical effects on the plasma membrane of the target cell [79].

Representative structures of bioactive polar lipids (PL) towards the PAF inflammatory pathways (B), 
which have been identified in several foods of the Mediterranean diet [56]. 
Lately, the term ‘PAF family’ has been proposed to include every other phospholipid molecule 
called PAF-like molecules, which have similar structures to those of the classic PAF molecule, and 
they exhibit similar bioactivities [89]. However, such PAF-like moieties are usually less potent than 
PAF by several orders of magnitude, i.e., increasing the chain length beyond 3 carbons at the sn-2 
position decreases its biological potency; likewise, altering the polar group at sn-3 position decreases 
the potency of the molecule. The molecular composition of PAF varies depending on different species 
and cell types. Related PAF-like lipids include, for example, the acyl-phosphatidylcholine-PAFs (with 
a short chain acyl group at the sn-2 position), ethanolamine-PAFs, inositol-PAFs, oxidised alkyl-acyl 
phosphatidyl glycerophosphocholines [90,91], and hydroxyl-alkyl acyl phospholipids [76,77]. 
PAF, in general, play a vital role in various physiological processes such as mediation of normal 
inflammatory responses, regulation of blood circulation and pressure, regulation of coagulation 
responses, glycogen degradation, brain function, reproduction, foetal implantation, lung maturation, 
initiation of parturition, and exocrine gland functions [92]. However, PAF can be regarded as both a 
friend, since it is presumed to have evolved as part of a protective mechanism in the innate host 
defence system, but also as a foe, because of its involvement in uncontrolled inflammation-related 
pathological conditions [93]. When present in excess, PAF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
several inflammation-related chronic disorders [57]; thus, its synthesis, distribution, and degradation 
are all strictly controlled, as would be predictable for such a potent molecule with a wide range of 
diverse actions. 
3.1.2. The PAF/PAF-Receptor Signalling Pathways 
PAF and PAF-like molecules act through their binding to a unique G-protein coupled seven 
transmembrane receptors, called the PAF-receptor (PAF-R) [87,88]. Species identity, differentiated by 
heterogeneity in linkage, degree of unsaturation, and carbon chain length of the alkyl or acyl chains 
at the sn-1 and sn-2 position, partially dictates signalling specificity by eliciting various signal 
transduction pathways following PAF-R activation [94,95]. The PAF-R is constitutively present on 
Figure 1. (A) Typical structure of classic platelet-activating factor (PAF) molecule [86]. (B) Representative

called PAF-like molecules, which have similar structures to those of the classic PAF molecule, and they
exhibit similar bioactivities [89]. However, such PAF-like moieties are usually less potent than PAF
by several orders of magnitude, i.e., increasing the chain length beyond 3 carbons at the sn-2 position
decreases its biological potency; likewise, altering the polar group at sn-3 position decreases the
potency of the molecule. The molecular composition of PAF varies depending on different species
and cell types. Related PAF-like lipids include, for example, the acyl-phosphatidylcholine-PAFs (with
a short chain acyl group at the sn-2 position), ethanolamine-PAFs, inositol-PAFs, oxidised alkyl-acyl
phosphatidyl glycerophosphocholines [90,91], and hydroxyl-alkyl acyl phospholipids [76,77].
PAF, in general, play a vital role in various physiological processes such as mediation of normal
inflammatory responses, regulation of blood circulation and pressure, regulation of coagulation
responses, glycogen degradation, brain function, reproduction, foetal implantation, lung maturation,
initiation of parturition, and exocrine gland functions [92]. However, PAF can be regarded as both
a friend, since it is presumed to have evolved as part of a protective mechanism in the innate host
defence system, but also as a foe, because of its involvement in uncontrolled inflammation-related
pathological conditions [93]. When present in excess, PAF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
several inflammation-related chronic disorders [57]; thus, its synthesis, distribution, and degradation
are all strictly controlled, as would be predictable for such a potent molecule with a wide range of
diverse actions.
3.1.2. The PAF/PAF-Receptor Signalling Pathways

chains at the sn-1 and sn-2 position, partially dictates signalling specificity by eliciting various signal
transduction pathways following PAF-R activation [94,95]. The PAF-R is constitutively present on
platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells, and further expression may be induced by appropriate
stimuli. PAF-R is highly expressed by cells within the innate immune and cardiovascular systems [96],
pointing to a role for PAF and PAF-like molecules as pleiotropic communicators in plasma [97].
Ligand binding (PAF and/or PAF-like molecules) to the PAF-R subsequently triggers multiple
intracellular signalling pathways and gene-expressions, depending on the target cell and PAF levels
(concentration) in blood or tissue [87–89,98] (Figure 2 (A1–A3)). For example, activation of the PAF-R
signalling initiates (through a Gq-linked mechanism) PLCβ-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 to produce
IP3 and DAG, leading to transient elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ released from intracellular stores and
activation of PKC. The rise in Ca2+ also activates cPLA2α, leading to the release of arachidonic acid
(AA) and lysophosphatides, which can serve as substrates for further synthesis of eicosanoids and
PAF, respectively. In addition, signalling through Gi-linked PAF-R inhibits the conversion of ATP to
cAMP by adenylate cyclase, thus preventing the activation of PKA and related signalling events.

stimuli. PAF-R is highly expressed by cells within the innate immune and cardiovascular systems 
[96], pointing to a role for PAF and PAF-like molecules as pleiotropic communicators in plasma [97].

eicosanoids and PAF, respectively. In addition, signalling through Gi-linked PAF-R inhibits the 
conversion of ATP to cAMP by adenylate cyclase, thus preventing the activation of PKA and related 
signalling events. 
Signalling through other pathways is also amplified by the PAF/PAF-R pathway activation, 
since inhibition of PAF synthesis or PAF-R blockade significantly attenuates signalling through 
apparently unrelated pathways, suggesting a critical role for PAF/PAF-R action as a co-stimulatory 
signal. For example, many VEGF-directed effects on vascular endothelium require PAF synthesis 
[57]. Nevertheless, the activation of the PAF/PAF-R pathway further triggers the activation and 
aggregation of platelets and leukocytes and promotes leukocyte and platelet adherence, motility, 
chemotaxis, invasion, migration, ROS generation, and further PAF formation (Figure 2) [89,98].

and progression of inflammation-related chronic diseases. A1. Several risk factors and related
upstream pro-inflammatory stimuli trigger formation of PAF and PAF-like molecules (i.e., oxidised
phospholipids) and expression of PAF-R. A2. Binding of PAF/PAF-like molecules on PAF-R promote
several inflammation-related intracellular pathways; activation of the PAF-R signalling initiates
(through a Gq-linked mechanism) PLCβ-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 to produce IP3 and DAG,
leading to transient elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ released from intracellular stores and activation of
PKC. The rise in Ca2+ also activates cPLA2α, leading to the release of AA and lysophosphatides,
which can serve as substrates for further synthesis of eicosanoids and PAF, respectively. Signalling
through Gi-linked PAF-R inhibits the conversion of ATP to cAMP by adenylate cyclase, in this way
preventing the activation of PKA and related anti-inflammatory signalling events. A3. Activation
of the PAF/PAF-R intracellular pathways leads to the activation of cPLA2 and PAF biosynthetic
enzymes (LPCAT) for further formation of PAF and other lipid second messengers, thus creating
a PAF cycle and further amplification of the initial inflammatory stimuli, while expression of genes
involved in inflammatory manifestations (such as genes of several cytokines, integrins, selectins,
metalloproteinase, several enzymes for eicosanoids, and ROS, etc.) is also induced. The pathways
inducing the PAF-CPT-related synthesis of PAF are not fully elucidated. B. Increased PAF levels at
the site of inflammation and ligand binding (PAF and/or oxidised phospholipids binding) on PAF-R
can promote a broad spectrum of PAF effects depending on the cell type and tissue, which is achieved
through the production and release of various downstream mediators, such as PAF itself and several
other mediators of inflammation such as eicosanoids, cytokines (i.e., TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, INF-γ,
etc.), growth factors (i.e., VEGF, IGF, TGF), ROS, and RNS, but also through the expression of selectins
and integrins (i.e., ICAM, VCAM, P-Selectin, E-Selectin) in the membranes of activated cells. Thus,
increased downstream mediators, PAF levels, and the subsequent further activation of the PAF/PAF-R
pathways promotes the activation and aggregation of platelets and leukocytes, activation of endothelial
cells, leukocyte adherence, motility, chemotaxis, invasion, migration, and subsequent endothelial
dysfunction, thus stimulating the onset and development of inflammation-related chronic diseases
and disorders. C. Microconstituents of several foods of the Mediterranean diet have been found to
beneficially inhibit the PAF/PAF-R pathways and PAF synthesis towards homeostatic re-equilibration
of PAF levels and activities [57].

Signalling through other pathways is also amplified by the PAF/PAF-R pathway activation,
since inhibition of PAF synthesis or PAF-R blockade significantly attenuates signalling through
apparently unrelated pathways, suggesting a critical role for PAF/PAF-R action as a co-stimulatory
signal. For example, many VEGF-directed effects on vascular endothelium require PAF synthesis [57].
Nevertheless, the activation of the PAF/PAF-R pathway further triggers the activation and aggregation
of platelets and leukocytes and promotes leukocyte and platelet adherence, motility, chemotaxis,
invasion, migration, ROS generation, and further PAF formation (Figure 2) [89,98].

3.1.3. PAF Levels Result from Enzymatic Biosynthesis, Non-Enzymatic Oxidative Synthesis,
and Enzymatic Catabolism
Under normal circumstances, homeostatic levels of PAF present in plasma and biological tissue
seem to be regulated by a balance of its biosynthetic and catabolic enzymatic pathways [57]. PAF is
synthesised throughout the body by the specific stimulation of various cell types such as platelets,
macrophages, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and endothelial cells. PAF is mostly produced in
the blood, lungs, kidney, myocardium, brain, liver, skin, saliva, retina, uterus, and embryo [56,99,100].
Two enzymatic pathways by which PAF is biosynthesised in the body are the ‘remodelling’ and the
‘de novo’ pathways (Figure 3(A1)).

been proposed that this pathway is periodically involved in the acute pro-inflammatory production 
of PAF under activation of several cells during inflammation [101]. More specifically, the action of 
cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) yields a precursor of PAF called lyso-PAF (1-O-alkyl-sn-
glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine), which is then acetylated by at least two isoforms of acetyl-CoA: lyso-
PAF acetyltransferases, namely, LPCAT1 and LPCAT2 (lyso-PAF AT), leading to the formation of 
PAF [102]. LPCAT2 is highly expressed in inflammatory cells, and, depending upon the 
inflammatory stimulus used to activate the cells, PAF is produced within seconds, minutes, or hours 
following stimulation. In addition, PAF itself can act as an inflammatory signal, and the binding of

The remodelling enzymatic pathway of PAF biosynthesis involves remodelling of a membrane
lipid constituent (a long-chain fatty acyl residue in sn-2 is replaced with an acetyl residue), and it
has been proposed that this pathway is periodically involved in the acute pro-inflammatory
production of PAF under activation of several cells during inflammation [101]. More specifically,
the action of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) yields a precursor of PAF called lyso-PAF
(1-O-alkyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine), which is then acetylated by at least two isoforms of
acetyl-CoA: lyso-PAF acetyltransferases, namely, LPCAT1 and LPCAT2 (lyso-PAF AT), leading to the
formation of PAF [102]. LPCAT2 is highly expressed in inflammatory cells, and, depending upon the
inflammatory stimulus used to activate the cells, PAF is produced within seconds, minutes, or hours
following stimulation. In addition, PAF itself can act as an inflammatory signal, and the binding of
PAF to its receptor on inflammatory cells can promote the very rapid (within 30 s) production of PAF;
PAF-induced, protein kinase, Cα-mediated phosphorylation of LPCAT2 enhances enzymatic activity,
leading to the vary rapid production of PAF. Thus, a PAF cycle can consistently induce increased PAF
levels and subsequent inflammatory cascades (Figures 2 and 3)
The de novo enzymatic pathway of PAF biosynthesis is similar but distinct to the biosynthesis
of phosphatidylcholine, since a phosphocholine function is transferred to alkyl acetyl glycerol. This
pathway has been initially reported as the pathway responsible for the constitutive production of PAF
basal levels. A key step in this route is the conversion of 1-O-alkyl-2-sn-acetyl-glycerol to PAF by a specific
dithiothreitol l-insensitive CDP-choline: 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol cholinephosphotransferase
(PAF-CPT) [57,81]. Interestingly, apart from the remodelling pathway, which is always activated
in both acute and chronic inflammation, the key enzyme of the ‘de novo pathway, PAF-CPT, seems to be
more active during chronic inflammatory manifestations, thus contributing to an increase of basal levels
of PAF that seem to be related to the continuous activation of inflammatory cascades in the long-term
during the development of inflammation-related chronic disorders [57,70,81]. Thus, the regulation
of the biosynthetic pathways of PAF seems to be more complicated than was initially thought, while
both PAF biosynthetic routes are correlated with well-established inflammatory and immunological
biomarkers (i.e., several cytokines, viral load, CD-40L, etc.) in several cases [57,69,70,79,81,103,104].
Apart from its enzymatic biosynthetic pathways, PAF and PAF-like lipids can also be produced
through non-enzymatic synthesis by oxidation of other lipids during oxidative stress [105,106].
The production of PAF and such PAF-like oxidised lipids usually occurs during inflammation and
oxidative stress (Figure 3(A2)). Vice versa, PAF and PAF-like lipids can also stimulate the production of
ROS and nitrogenous species such as reactive nitrogen species (RNS) during oxidative and nitrosative
stress in inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis [89].
The main catabolic enzyme that reduces PAF levels is PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), delicate
phospholipase A2 that removes the acetate group from the PAF molecule and thus transforms
PAF to its inactive form of lyso-PAF (Figure 3B) [107]. These enzymes, PAF-AH, are produced
largely by hepatocytes and macrophages, and are widely distributed in human plasma, blood cells,
and a variety of tissues. Subsequent research revealed that the PAF-AH family includes intracellular
forms called PAF-AH I and PAF-AH II, as well as an extracellular third isoform [108]. PAF-AH,
an extracellular isoform in plasma, is a member of the PLA2 superfamily of enzymes that is also
known as lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), since it circulates in blood in association
with plasma lipoprotein particles such as LDL and HDL, or the PLA2 group 7 (PLA2G7) [107–110].
Intracellular PAF-AH type I exists in the cytoplasm of many (probably all) types of mammalian
cells and tissues [111]. Interestingly, the intracellular PAF-AH Type II that has no homology with
PAF-AH I, but shares sequence similarity to plasma PAF-AH, was reported to act as a cellular
Phospholipase A2 that hydrolyses oxidatively modulated or truncated phospholipids (with short
length or oxidatively modified sn-2 acyl chains). It is thus suggested that PAF-AH (II) functions as
an antioxidant phospholipase that plays a protective role also against oxidative stress [108,112].

3.2. The PAF Pathway and Metabolism in Chronic Diseases
Under normal conditions, plasma and tissue levels of PAF are tightly regulated by its metabolic
pathways.
However, production of PAF and PAF-like molecules can become elevated and/or
dysregulated during extended periods of immune activation and chronic inflammation-related
disorders by amplification of its synthesis, either through cascades activating its biosynthetic enzymes
or through oxidative production of PAF, or usually by both [57,69,70,79,81,103,104,113]. PAF plays
a major role in the physiopathology of inflammatory reactions and is produced and released in large
quantities by inflammatory cells in response to specific stimuli, such as upstream regulators (IL-1, IL-6,
TNF-α, Endothelin, oxidative stress, and PAF itself; Figure 2A) [57,78,89,114].
Increased PAF levels at the site of inflammation can activate several cell types through its receptor.
This leads to the initiation of a broad spectrum of PAF effects depending on the cell type and tissue,
which is achieved through the production and release of various downstream mediators, such as PAF
itself and several other mediators of inflammation such as eicosanoids, cytokines (i.e., TNF-α, IL-1α,
IL-6, IL-8, INF-γ, etc.), growth factors (i.e., VEGF, IGF, TGF), ROS, and RNS, but also through the
expression of selectins and integrins (i.e., ICAM, VCAM, P-Selectin, E-Selectin) in the membranes of
activated cells (Figure 2B) [57,58,78,89,113,114].
The interconnected crosstalk between PAF, pro-inflammatory upstream mediators that induce PAF
production, and PAF-induced downstream mediators seems to be interrelated during inflammatory
manifestations and inflammation-related chronic diseases. These pathways serve as one of the main
junctions between many inflammatory cascades that ultimately lead to endothelium dysfunction and
inflammation-related disorders such as atherosclerosis, CVD, renal disorders, cerebrovascular, central
nervous system (CNS) disorders, metastatic angiogenesis during cancer, sepsis, and several other
chronic disorders (Figure 2B) [57,58,78,89,113].
3.2.1. PAF in Atherosclerosis and CVD
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death worldwide. It is estimated that
49 million people are now living with the disease in the European Union alone [115]. Atherosclerosis
is a slow progressive disease in which lesions or plaques form in large and medium-sized arteries,
consisting of necrotic cores, calcified regions, accumulated modified lipids, migrated smooth muscle
cells (SMC), foam cells, endothelial cells, and several leukocyte subtypes. Monocytes, circulating blood
precursors of tissue macrophages, and myeloid-derived DC influence plaque development following
recruitment into the intima and differentiation to foam cells.
In contrast to the previous notions concerning the passive accumulation of lipids in macrophages
during the formation of foam cells, it is now clear that there are more complex inflammatory
mechanisms acting on monocytes, macrophages, platelets, several other leucocyte subtypes,
and endothelial cells that seem to promote atherosclerosis via pro-inflammatory foam cell
formation [66]. Persistent and unresolved inflammation at the vascular wall gives rise to inappropriate
platelet and leukocyte recruitment at the endothelium. The inflammatory interplay and crosstalk
between these cells and endothelial cells, facilitated by several inflammatory mediators, initiates the
cascades that induce chronic inflammatory manifestations at the vascular wall, which counteracts the
homeostatic inflammatory response, leading to endothelial dysfunction and initiation of proatherogenic
events that lead to atherogenesis and atherosclerosis [116]. PAF is one of the main junctions between
several inflammatory pathways (cytokines, oxidative stress, eicosanoids, etc.) and their interplay
with cells participating in inflammation-related atherosclerosis. Therefore, PAF is implicated in all
stages of atherosclerosis, from the initiation of atherogenesis all the way through to plaque formation,
development, instability, and rupture [58,89,105,117].

The Pro-Inflammatory Crosstalk between PAF with Several Cells and the Endothelium Induces Early
Pro-Atherogenic Phases of Endothelial Dysfunction
At early pro-atherogenic conditions, PAF is produced in several cells, such as platelets, leukocytes,
and endothelial cells under pro-inflammatory stimuli and/or by the oxidation of lipoproteins.
Thus, PAF can further propagate oxidative stress, through the oxidation of LDL and the reduction
of NO bioavailability, but mostly by acting as a potent chemotactic factor for other human cells
that exhibit its receptor on their membranes, such as monocytic and granulocytic leukocytes of the
innate and adaptive immune system, endothelial cells, etc. Following these activations, a number of
mediators are released by these activated cells (e.g., PAF itself, several cytokines, eicosanoids, ROS,
RNS, and several enzymes), while adhesive molecules are expressed in their cell membranes (i.e.,
chemokines, selectins, and integrins, such as E-selectin, P-selectin, MCP1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, etc.)
that facilitate platelet-platelet, platelet-leukocyte, and platelet-leukocyte-endothelium aggregates and
interplay [58,89]. The PAF pathway downstream products can further contribute to the propagation
of atherosclerosis.
Molecules of the selectin family mediate interactions between platelets and leukocytes, with
the endothelium allowing leukocytes and platelets to roll along the vascular endothelium wall.
Platelet binding of the endothelium seems to precede the appearance of leukocytes in plaques and
induces bidirectional expression of adhesion molecules and the production of monocyte attracting
chemokines, such as PAF that plays a central role in cytokine-induced monocyte adherence to
endothelium [58,89,117,118]. Activated platelets that adhere to the inflamed endothelium may enhance
leukocyte recruitment, activation, and transmigration, thereby enhancing the inflammatory processes
underlying atherosclerosis [119]. PAF and Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), derived by activated platelets,
leukocytes or endothelium, but also thrombin (through PAF and LTB4 pathways), can propagate
the activation of platelets and the subsequent activation and adhesion of leucocytes through the
interplay of chemokines and their receptors [117]. An important aspect of this platelet-leucocyte
interplay is the diversity of leukocytes recruited by vessel wall adherent platelets, such as the
platelet-mediated recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, DC, T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes,
and NK-cells to endothelium [117].
In addition, platelets regulate neutrophil activation through the generation of PAF as
a chemoattractant pro-inflammatory lipid [120]. Activated endothelial cells and platelets generate
considerable amounts of PAF, which act cooperatively with other extracellular stimuli to induce full
integrin activation and leukocyte arrest [58,89,120]. However, whether PAF mostly originates from
activated platelets, endothelial cells or leukocytes are not well defined yet [120]. Independently of
its origin, the presence of PAF activates through its PAF/PAF-R pathways expression of integrin
molecules at cell membranes to promote firm adhesion between leukocytes, platelets, and vascular
endothelium [117].
PAF, other vasoactive compounds, angiogenic compounds, and pro-inflammatory mediators,
such as arachidonic acid metabolites, histamine, cytokines, chemokines, and proteolytic enzymes, can
also be released by mast cells that accumulate in the human arterial intima and adventitia during
atherosclerotic plaque progression, and thus aggravate atherogenesis [8]. Cytokines produced by
mast cells may be activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines, hypercholesterolemia,
and hyperglycaemia, and trigger the endothelial expression of adhesion molecules such as P-selectin,
VCAM-1, and chemokines such as PAF that mediate the recruitment and adhesion of leukocytes [8].
Similar to other chemoattractants, PAF has been detected in circulation; however, this molecule
is mostly cell membrane-associated and operates in a paracrine manner on the G-protein coupled
receptors of neighbouring cells [58,89,120]. Thus, PAF is also a main player in juxtacrine signalling and
adhesion of leukocytes to other cells, and has also been shown to regulate firm neutrophil adhesion on
the surface of immobilised spread platelets [119,121]. The level of platelet stimulation impacts directly
on neutrophil adhesion to platelets monolayer, upon which neutrophil activity is spatially regulated
by PAF generation [58,89,120]. Platelets and activated neutrophils act jointly to induce expression

of adhesion molecules, permeability changes, and limit the bioavailability of nitric oxide, altogether
aggravating endothelial dysfunction and facilitating subsequent monocyte plaque recruitment [122].
The Inflammatory Crosstalk Between PAF and Several Cells at the Intima and Subintima Leads to the
Induction of Plaque Development and Increased Plaque Growth and Expansion
In the aortic lumen, endothelial cells have been activated by the aforementioned PAF-implicated
downstream manifestations, leading to increased endothelium permeability and endothelial
dysfunction.
Subsequent abnormal recruitment, migration, and infiltration of monocytes then
take place in the intima and subintima. Within the intima, monocytes secrete lipoprotein-binding
proteoglycans, resulting in increased accumulation of modified LDL, which sustains inflammation.
In addition, once in the intima, differentiation factors such as the macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (M-CSF) differentiate pro-inflammatory monocytes into inflammatory type macrophages that
ingest modified lipoprotein to become foam cells [59,123].
Emerging evidence suggests that the role of monocytes and macrophages in atherosclerosis is
not simply that of a passive acceptor of lipids [66]. Apart from their phagocytic roles, macrophages
can also instruct or be instructed by other immune cells by producing various immune effector
molecules and by acting as antigen-presenting cells (APC). Plaque-related macrophages can have
many phenotypes and functions depending on the stage of the disease; several monocyte subtypes exist,
and subsequently several pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophage subtypes also exist,
while macrophages can rapidly adapt their phenotype and consequently their function in response
to changes of the microenvironment and intracellular signalling pathways [122]. After appropriate
activation, macrophages can exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype that can further activate endothelial
cells, which in turn triggers further blood monocyte recruitment [122,124]. Thus, upon activation,
the pro-inflammatory subtype of macrophages and foam cells produce inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines that enhance inflammation and further regulate monocyte and T cell infiltration [59,124].
Macrophages express a myriad of receptors including G-protein coupled receptors such as PAF-R,
through which they scan their environment for activation or polarisation signals, e.g., cytokines,
growth factors, oxidised phospholipids, etc., [59,124–126], while, when in the atherosclerotic plaque,
macrophages are capable of releasing a large repertoire of pro-inflammatory cytokines according to
their phenotype and depending on the plaque microenvironment, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15,
IL-18, TNF family members, and PAF, as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β
family members (TGF-β1, BMPs, GDFs) [58,59,124].
Several autacoid molecules of the microenvironment, such as PAF and its receptor, play
a significant role in the pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages by oxidative stress and in the
uptake of Ox-LDL by macrophages [125], since Ox-LDL contains inflammatory PAF-like oxidised
phospholipids that mimic PAF and interact with these cells [105]. In addition, autacoids such as PAF
and PAF-like molecules in Ox-LDL also play a significant role in the cytoskeletal reorganisation of these
cells during differentiations [127], as macrophages engulf and retain large molecules such as Ox-LDL,
oxidised phospholipids, and blood cells, which have also migrated into the intima and sub-intima.
The macrophages become lipid-loaded foam cells through phagocytosis, scavenger-receptor mediated
uptake, and pinocytosis; the macrophages become lipid-loaded foam cells [58]. The term ‘foam cells’
both reflects the microscopic appearance of these lipid-laden macrophages and denotes early fatty
streak lesions [122]. This process is outlined in Figure 4.

exist, while macrophages can rapidly adapt their phenotype and consequently their function in

of leukocytes on the activated endothelium and subsequent migration of these leukocytes and Ox-LDL
to the subendothelium. There, the crosstalk of key-junction inflammatory mediators such as PAF
within the developing plaque microenvironment, with a panel of inflammatory cells of both the
innate and adaptive immune system, favours inflammatory phenotypes in these cells and perpetuates
a continuous inflammatory milieu, leading to the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages, which
engulf Ox-LDL and further transform to foam cells; thus, facilitating the onset, increase, and expansion
of atherosclerotic plaque. (IV) Although plaques can grow to a sufficiently large size to compromise
blood flow, most of their clinical complications are attributable to arterial occlusion due to plaque
erosion or rupture. Vulnerable plaques are typically large, with a necrotic core covered by a thin fibrous
cap, and they contain high levels of inflammatory immune cells. Gradually accumulating foam cells
die in the intima due to inflammation-induced apoptosis, and when not promptly disposed of, become
necrotic, progressively leading to the formation of a thrombogenic and pro-inflammatory necrotic core
with cholesterol crystals. In addition, the thin layer of the fibrous cap easily ruptures due to PAF-related
inflammatory and atherothrombotic stimuli. Thus, as the plaque continues to develop, it can become
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 604

unstable and rupture, leading to major cardiovascular event. PAF: platelet-activating factor; PAF-R:
G-protein coupled PAF-receptor; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RNS: reactive nitrogen species; Ox-LDL:
oxidised LDL; Ox-PL: oxidised phospholipids; IL-6: interleukin-6; IL-1: interleukin-1; TNFα: tumor
necrosis factor-α; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor.
The interplay of PAF with other APC such as DC is also implicated in several stages of
atherosclerosis. Under atherosclerotic conditions, the role of DC is to take up atherosclerosis-specific
antigens, which become locally activated, and migrate out of the plaque towards either local draining or
distant lymph nodes, where they induce protective anti-inflammatory T cell activation and proliferation.
However, apart from their role in directing different T and B cell subsets, not all their functions have
been fully elucidated or understood. Nevertheless, impaired migration of DC to lymph nodes results
from inhibitory signals generated by PAF or Ox-LDL that act as a PAF mimetic, thus suppressing
immunologic priming. In contrast, normal DC migration and priming can be restored by HDL or
HDL-associated PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), which mediates inactivation of PAF and oxidised
LDL. In this context, HDL and PAF-AH maintain a normally functional DC compartment [128].
In addition, DC produce PAF that engage the PAF-R in DC membranes during maturation, and thus
the capacity of DC to present antigens to lymphocytes is downregulated, due to the induction of
IL-10 and the sustained and increased PGE2 synthesis mediated by the PAF-R. In contrast, PAF-R
antagonists, by disrupting this suppressor pathway, increase DC function and could therefore be useful
in increasing efficiency of vaccines and/or treatment [129]. The above PAF effects on DC perpetuate
local inflammation, decrease the activation of anti-inflammatory T-lymphocytes, and thus further
increase plaque growth.
Lymphocytes, particularly T-lymphocytes, are also recruited to the vessel wall by mechanisms
such as monocyte recruitment; thus, they are present in atherosclerotic lesions in parallel with
macrophages, but in lower amounts. CD4+ T cells (also called Th1 cells) express pro-atherogenic
roles, whereas prominent Th2 (CD8+ T cells) and Treg responses seem to exhibit unclear and still
controversial anti-inflammatory effects, resulting in a reduction of atherosclerosis and/or a more
favourable plaque morphology in atherogenesis.
PAF and other platelet-related inflammatory
mediators, such as thromboxane A2, serotonin, and histamine, also display Th1 cell-regulatory effects
towards the Th1 response that promotes the progression of atherosclerosis and diverse effects on
Th2 response [130]. Activated platelets produce a significant amount of TxA2, which inhibits Th1
proliferation and cytokine production [131], while they also express PAF-R, and PAF can enhance Th1
cytokine production [130,132].
PAF can also promote differentiation of Th17 cells that are present in atherosclerotic lesions,
which can induce cytokine production by these cells. Activated platelets and platelet thrombi create
a unique microenvironment with counteracting mediators for Th17 polarisation by secreting substantial
amount of PAF, TGFβ, and IL-1β [130]. However, the role of Th17 also remains controversial, as both
atherogenic, as well as atheroprotective, effects have been reported [59]. Nevertheless, both PAF and
Ox-LDL that mimic PAF and the PAF-R have the capacity to induce atherogenesis due to activation
of T-cells and monocytes/macrophages [133]. These events lead to an expansion of atherosclerotic
plaque burden and perpetuation of the pathogenic T-cell response.
Overall, there is intricate interplay and crosstalk between a panel of inflammatory cells of both
the innate and adaptive immune system. When key-junction inflammatory mediators within the
developing plaque microenvironment are increased, there is favour towards inflammatory phenotypes
in these cells, which perpetuates a continuous inflammatory milieu, leading to further increase and
expansion of the atherosclerotic plaque. Subsequently, the intimal thickness increases, and blood flow
is eventually impaired. Gradually accumulating foam cells die in the intima through inflammation
induced apoptosis. When these cells are not promptly disposed of they become necrotic, progressively
leading to the formation of a thrombogenic and pro-inflammatory necrotic core containing cholesterol
crystals [58].

The Overgrowth and Instability of Plaques and Subsequent Acute Cardiovascular Events
During plaque growth and expansion, SMC migrate from the media to the intima and proliferate,
forming a fibrous cap from extracellular matrix deposition, where activated lymphocytes and calcium
deposits are found. Although plaques can grow to a sufficiently large size to compromise blood
flow, most of their clinical complications are attributable to arterial occlusion due to plaque erosion
or rupture. Vulnerable plaques are typically large with a necrotic core covered by a thin fibrous cap
and contain high levels of inflammatory immune cells [122]. The thin fibrous cap easily ruptures,
as there are areas of the plaque where few SMC are present, and macrophages exist in abundance.
This is because inflammatory cells cause the death of SMC, which are the main source of collagen that
produce and maintain the fibrous cap. PAF is also implicated in the release of several proteases from
leukocytes, such as elastase, that degrade the vessel’s extracellular matrix components of the intima,
which may lead to plaque rupture [58]. As the plaque continues to develop it can become unstable and
rupture, leading to a major cardiovascular event such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or congestive
heart failure, depending on the location of the rupture.
Platelets are critical effectors in the development, progression, and resolution of the final stages
of atherosclerosis, and plaque rupture, which is responsible for acute coronary disorders and stroke,
not only due to their direct effects on the endothelium but also by acting as a ‘bridge’ for other
cells within the vascular system [119,121]. Plaque rupture occurs under inflammatory cascades and
atherothrombosis through an interplay of platelet-leukocyte aggregates. Upon vessel injury (i.e., plaque
rupture), platelets readily adhere to damaged endothelium, and this binding event facilitates further
activation and discharge of activating factors stored in platelet granules. Such platelet secretory
components include membrane ligands and several chemokines such as PAF that play a role in
further recruitment of leukocytes, additional platelets, or other blood cells to the vessel wall [121].
Platelet adhesion under conditions of high shear stress, which occurs in stenotic atherosclerotic arteries,
is central to the development of arterial thrombosis. Therefore, precise control of platelet adhesion
must occur to maintain blood fluidity and to prevent thrombotic complications [119].
Concluding Remarks on PAF in Atherosclerosis and CVD
The potent pro-inflammatory mediator, PAF, and its related PAF/PAF-R pathways are
key-junctions of the inflammatory milieu during all stages of atherosclerosis and subsequent CVD.
Some biochemical mechanisms involved include the pro-inflammatory induction of endothelial
dysfunction, oxidative and nitrosative stress, increased platelet reactivity, recruitment/tight-adhesion,
and trans-endothelial cell migration of inflammatory cells from the circulation, differentiation of
pro-inflammatory monocytes to inflammatory macrophages, induction of macrophage uptake of
Ox-LDL, foam cell formation, induction of plaque growth, plaque instability that leads to eventual
plaque rupture, and subsequent cardiovascular events. Outcomes from multiple animal model
experiments and several clinical studies have also outlined the crucial role of PAF in atherosclerosis due
to its elevated levels and its inflammatory interplay and crosstalk with several cells in the pathogenesis
of cardiovascular disorders. Clinical studies that have evaluated the role of PAF as a predictor of CVD
have also been reviewed [89].
PAF-R antagonists have been tested with promising results [134–140], however the most
prominent beneficial outcomes against atherosclerosis development and CVD were found when
food-derived PAF inhibitors such as those present in the foods of the Med-diet. These molecules
beneficially inhibit PAF activities and modulate its metabolism towards homeostatic PAF
levels [103,140–145].
Many of these components are present in olive oil, wine, fish, and dairy
products (Table 1). Interestingly, the administration of polar lipid extracts from fish or olive oil
to hypercholesterolemic rabbits lead to the regression of atherosclerotic plaques [103,142–145]. These
results clearly outline that targeting inflammation and its key-junctions such as the PAF/PAF-R
pathways and PAF metabolism provide beneficial outcomes against atherosclerosis and CVD, even
without targeting hypercholesterolaemia. Thus, by targeting inflammation, the cause of these disorders

through non-toxic approaches such as the Med-diet and by not targeting single risk factors (such
as hypercholesterolaemia) seems to provide preventive and protective beneficial results against
atherosclerosis and CVD.

3.2.2. The Role of PAF in Cancer and Metastatic Angiogenesis
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in developed countries. New blood vessel formation
penetrating solid tumours seems to be required for their growth and metastasis. Production of PAF
and overexpression of PAF-R are implicated in the tumour-endothelium interplay during cancer
growth, invasion, and metastasis in several types of cancer [57,114,169–171]. PAF and PAF-R are
also involved in tumour growth that is associated with immunosuppression [172–174], while the
crosstalk between PAF/PAF-R pathways and growth factors receptors pathways suggests a potentially
important signalling link between inflammatory and growth factor signalling in cancer [173–175].
It is not yet fully understood whether the initial levels of PAF in the tumour microenvironment
originate from migrated inflammatory circulating cells as a response, or by activated endothelial cells
in the vessels neighbouring tumours, or by the tumour cells themselves. However, there is correlation
between the malignancy of cancer cells and PAF production and PAF-R expression. It seems that the
production and accumulation of PAF in the tumour microenvironment originates from the coexistence
of two or of all these procedures and/or by the inactivation of PAF-AH. For example, the PAF basic
biosynthetic enzymes such as LPCAT1 (an isoform of lyso-PAF-AT) are overexpressed in several cancer
cells and correlated with cellular invasiveness and migration. Therefore, LPCAT1 seems to contribute
to tumour growth and metastasis in these types of cancer [176,177]. Moreover, endothelial cell PAF
production results in enhanced inflammatory cell recruitment, while endothelial accumulation of PAF
by PAF production and inactivation of PAF-AH plays also a role in cancer cell migration to distal
locations [178]. In addition cigarette smoking, a classic risk factor for several cancers, contributes to
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 604
19 of 38
metastatic disease via production of PAF and PAF-like molecules in lung tumours [174], while smoking
related inhibition of breast cancer cell PAF-AH results in PAF accumulation and a subsequent increase
in cell motility, tumour growth, and metastasis [178,179].
Independently of the origin, the presence of PAF in the microenvironment of tumours activates
cancer cells and endothelial cells to further amplify the production of both PAF, angiogenic factors,
and increased expression of their receptors on cell-membranes, including the PAF-receptor, leading
to a PAF cycle and further induction of several PAF/PAF-R related cascades.
These cascades,
in coordination with angiogenic cytokines and growth factors, enhance the initial signal and induce
morphological alterations and cellular activities such as growth proliferation and motility, expression
of adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix breakdown, migration, and endothelium reorder that leads
to the formation of distinct neoplastic vessels in the tumour microenvironment [57]. All of the above
result in the onset and development of tumour-induced angiogenesis and metastasis [57]. For example,
in pancreatic cancer, PAF overexpression leads to cell proliferation and tumourigenesis through the
PAF/PAF-R related MAPK signalling pathway, causing neoplasia [170]. In addition, PAF and PAF-like
molecules are in part transported by tumour-derived extracellular vesicles, which play an important
role in intercellular communication through PAF-R expressed by a variety of microenvironmental cells
and endothelial cells, favouring metastasis [172]. Apart from its crucial role in cancer metastasis, which
has been extensively reviewed [57], recent outcomes have demonstrated that PAF is also implicated in
immunosuppression-related cancer induced by UV-irradiation, in which UV-induced production of
PAF and PAF-like molecules and the expression of PAF-R activates systemic immune suppression and
delays DNA repair [93].
On the other hand, PAF and its receptor have been beneficially associated with cell survival
during radiotherapy or chemotherapy, by proliferative signals on the surviving cells that are induced
by apoptotic cells. These signals take place through mechanisms dependent on the activation of PAF-R
related pathways of NF-kB, such as up-regulation of anti-apoptotic factors and decrease of the cytotoxic
effect of chemotherapeutic agents, thereby contributing to cell survival [172]. However, recent studies
have demonstrated that during cancer therapies (i.e., irradiation of carcinoma cells or chemotherapy),
PAF-R ligands can be generated that further aggravate immune suppression and, when bound on the
PAF-R of cancer cells, induce anti-apoptotic factors that protect the tumor cells from death induced by
these treatments, while the combination of radiotherapy with PAF-R antagonists could be a promising
strategy for cancer treatment [173,180].
In several cancer types, PAF through the NF-kB pathway controls the expression of genes that take
part in processes that lead to metastatic angiogenesis on one hand, while on the other hand it results in
apoptosis of cancer cells, during the immune response and haematopoiesis during chemotherapies and
radiotherapies [57]. It seems that PAF is a unique growth regulator with apparently diverse functions;
PAF, like NF-kB, seems to promote distinct biological processes, and these dual actions of PAF may
relate to the point of action in the cell cycle [57]. The timing, space, and quantity of its production play
a significant role in the malignant or beneficial direction of its effects. Understanding how conditions
and factors that control timing, location of activity, and the quantity of PAF levels and how these relate
to the metabolic enzymes of PAF is of great importance.
PAF-R antagonists have exhibited promising results in vitro and in vivo as anti-angiogenic
molecules in several cancer cells and tumours, but also by reducing persistent pain during
cancers [57,114,181,182]. In addition, the combination of chemotherapy and classic PAF-R antagonists
seems to reduce the tumour volume and cause higher tumour regression when compared to each
treatment alone [172,180]. Recently, synthetic glycosylated alkyl-phospholipids that act as PAF agonists
and antagonists have exhibited promising antiproliferative outcomes and are now regarded as and
can be new class of anti-tumour drugs [183]. However, apart from using synthetic or classic PAF
antagonists, a dietary profile rich in bioactive molecules and food-derived PAF inhibitors such as those
present in foods of the Mediterranean diet seems to provide beneficial preventive and protective effects
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 604
20 of 38
against development, growth, and metastatic manifestations of cancer cells by inhibiting PAF activities
and/or modulating its metabolism towards homeostatic PAF levels [57,137] (Table 1).
3.2.3. The Role of PAF in Glomerulosclerosis and Renal Disorders
PAF has been characterised as one of the main inflammatory mediators implicated in renal
pathophysiology [184]. Production of PAF in the kidney can potentially be attributed to infiltrating
inflammatory cells, but mostly to resident renal cells such as the mesangial cells of glomeruli [81,185].
Once synthesised, PAF does not accumulate in renal cells, but it is secreted and thus affects mesangial
cells, neighbouring podocytes, and other infiltrating cells by binding to its receptor and inducing
PAF/PAF-R pathways. In the kidney, PAF-R mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, and a gradient of its
expression levels seems to exist; it is higher in the renal cortex, lesser in the outer medulla, and much
lesser in the inner medulla, while within the nephron, the glomerulus demonstrates the highest PAF-R
expression [78]. PAF infusion affects renal hemodynamics and glomerular permeability, resulting in
changes in filtration rate and proteinuria [78].
Apart from the physiological effects of PAF, its increased levels and overexpression of PAF-R
in kidney are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of renal damage and acute renal
failure [78,184,186,187]. Thus, PAF is implicated in antibody- and complement-mediated glomerular
injury, in antithymocyte antibody-induced glomerular damage and other experimental models of
immune renal damage, and in patients with lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy [78]. PAF participates
in the development of kidney graft dysfunction, namely, transplant rejection chronic transplant
nephropathy and immunosuppressive drug-mediated nephrotoxicity [78]. PAF is also implicated
in drug-related renal damage of different causes, such as cyclosporin A, glycerol, gentamicin,
and cisplatin [78].
However, the most important role of PAF in renal dysfunction is its implication in the onset and
progression of glomerulosclerosis, a renal disorder that shares common features with atherosclerosis
and can lead to organ failure. Crosstalk between several renal cells of the glomeruli, such as the
mesangial cells and podocytes, takes place during this disorder and the PAF/PAF-R pathways form
key junctions during all steps. It has been proposed that PAF might be one of the chemokines
released by mesangial cells that mediate their communication with podocytes. PAF enhances its
own receptor expression [188], through which it stimulates multiple downstream inflammatory
signalling pathways, mostly in mesangial cells, leading to the release of AA metabolites and
subsequent prostanoid and thromboxane generation, leukocyte recruitment, mesangial cell contraction,
intracellular lipid accumulation, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β mediated upregulation of
extracellular matrix production. All of these molecular events potentially culminate in the development
of glomerulosclerosis and fibrosis, which are key feature of progressive renal disease, regardless of the
primary cause [78,188,189]. In addition, PAF promotes inflammatory infiltration of the glomerulus,
since it functions as a chemoattractant, and it increases adhesion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and
monocytes to mesangial cells through integrins [78]. PAF increases the expression of the LDL-receptor
and scavenger receptors in mesangial cells, and thus causes an increased uptake of lipids and their
accumulation in mesangial cells, leading to the formation of foam cells, which is an important stage of
glomerulosclerosis and a key factor that participates in the initiation and progression of lipid-mediated
renal injury [78,188].
Several PAF-R antagonists have been used in several of the aforementioned renal disorders
with promising results [78,137]. However, apart from using classic PAF antagonists, recent results
have highlighted the protective role of a dietary profile rich in bioactive molecules, antioxidants,
and food-derived PAF inhibitors such as those present in the Mediterranean diet through beneficially
inhibiting PAF activities and/or modulating its metabolism towards homeostatic PAF levels [80,81]
(Table 1). In addition, the use of vitamin D or vitamin-D analogues as treatment in haemodialysis
patients has also exhibited similar beneficial effects, since such a treatment strongly inhibits PAF and
thrombin activities, affects PAF metabolism towards equilibrating PAF levels, and reduces circulating
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 604
21 of 38
levels of IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-α [79]. As reducing dietary cholesterol levels may be ineffective, such
outcomes have further supported the notion of using full-fat products such as dairy products and
non-low-fat products, since the full-fat dairy products exhibit higher bioavailability of high-value
nutrients such as bioactive polar lipids and vitamin D, which both possess strong anti-inflammatory
and protective properties [3].
3.2.4. The Role of PAF in Cerebrovascular and Central Nervous System Disorders
PAF and the PAF/PAF-R pathways are also present in the CNS, where they exhibit a number of
diverse physiological and pathological functions. PAF is synthesised in neuronal cells throughout the
CNS, while these cells also express the PAF-R [190,191]. When present at normal concentrations,
PAF is a modulator of many CNS processes, ranging from long-term potentiation to neuronal
differentiation [113,191]. Excessive levels of PAF appear to play an important role in neuronal cell injury
and in various inflammation-related CNS pathological conditions, such as neuroinflammatory cascades
implicated in depression and neurodegeneration, Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, ischemia-reperfusion
injury, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, neuropathic pain, epilepsy, central
malaria, meningitis, depression, cognitive deficits, and HIV-induced neurotoxicity [190–192]. Increased
PAF synthesis through the PAF/PAF-R pathways can cause a severe inflammatory response,
reduction of biological membrane integrity, ROS and RNS formation, expression and release of
cytokines, alterations in blood–brain barrier permeability and the permeability of blood vessel
walls, activation and recruitment of inflammatory and immune cells, secretion of cell-specific
proteins, induction of cell apoptosis through specific signalling pathways, and other pathological
responses [113,190–193]. PAF accumulation in CNS diseases exacerbates the inflammatory response
and pathological consequences, while application of PAF inhibitors or PAF-R antagonists significantly
reduces inflammation, protects cells, and improves the recovery of neural functions by blocking the
PAF pathway [191,192,194]. Several PAF inhibitors of natural origin have also exhibited beneficial
outcomes in CNS disorders, especially ginkgolides that are derived from Ginkgo biloba [137,195].
However, further studies are required to establish the mechanisms surrounding how a healthy diet
can improve systemic inflammation associated with the PAF pathway and CNS disorders.
3.2.5. The Role of PAF in Allergies and Asthma
Anaphylaxis is defined as a severe, life-threatening, systemic or general, immediate reaction of
hypersensitivity, with repeatable symptoms caused by a dose of stimulus that is well tolerated by
healthy persons [196,197]. Recently, PAF and PAF-AH have been reported as clinically valuable
biomarkers of anaphylaxis [196], since PAF produced and released by mast cells, basophils,
neutrophils, eosinophils, fibroblasts, platelets, endothelial cells, and even cardiac muscle cells plays
an important role in anaphylaxis and several other allergic reactions, from allergic rhinitis to asthmatic
complications [67,196–202]. Eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils are implicated in allergies, and they
have the capacity to influence each other’s functions through a crosstalk, where other mediators such
as PAF are also implicated [198–200,203]. PAF increases the production of eicosanoids, ROS, cytokines,
growth factors, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), RANTES, and degranulation of eosinophils,
while it also acts as a chemoattractant for these cells, and, via integrins, it increases their adhesion to
vascular endothelium. Mast cells not only produce PAF, but they can also be activated by it through
the PAF/PAF-R pathways. Thus, exposure of mast cells to PAF leads to the induction of specific
functions in these cells such as degranulation of their granules via neuropeptides and PAF-dependent
release of histamine. In fact, the greater the levels of PAF in mast cells microenvironment, the more
enhanced the release of histamine. At the same time, PAF-activated myocardial mast cells locally
release factors responsible for cardiac dysfunction and hypotension that occur in severe anaphylactic
reactions [197,200].
Increased levels of PAF correlate with the severity of allergic systemic reactions. Thus, PAF has
been found to be involved in several allergic and anaphylactic reactions and shock, in inflammation of
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 604
22 of 38
bronchi and bronchial asthma and in asthmatic patients’ bronchoconstriction, in mucus hypersecretion,
in allergic rhinitis, and in urticaria pathogenesis [200]. Several studies have shown that PAF can
enhance obstructive changes of bronchi by stimulation of allergic inflammation of the respiratory
tract epithelium, while PAF can also increase the permeability of skin’s capillaries and induces the
development of wheals, flare, and inflammatory reactions in the skin through its interactions and
crosstalk of the aforementioned inflammatory cells involved in these pathological conditions [200].
The protective role of PAF-AH in reducing PAF levels is usually highly diminished through
allergic reactions [196,200], while administration of recombinant PAF-AH in animal models exhibited
protective results and reduced mortality due to anaphylactic reactions [196], implying that modulation
of PAF metabolism towards homeostatic PAF levels can also provide beneficial outcomes in these
disorders too.
In addition, specific PAF-R inhibitors have been used in several allergy-related
disorders [137], and even specific anti-allergic drugs were designed and are currently used according
to their anti-PAF effects [204,205], while combination of PAF inhibitors with other therapies such as
antihistamines provided better outcomes [137,198,199,201]. However, further studies are required to
establish the potential of a healthy diet to improve systemic inflammation associated with the PAF
pathway and allergic complications.
3.2.6. The Role of PAF in Chronic Infections and Inflammation-Associated Comorbidities
Inflammatory and immune responses are central to protecting against most infectious agents.
However, the pathogenesis and tissue damage after infection are not usually related to the direct
action microorganisms and of their replication, but instead to altered immune and inflammatory
responses triggered following contact with the pathogen. Many diseases develop as an adverse
consequence of an imbalanced inflammatory response; thus, chronic and unresolved infections are
usually accompanied by chronic and unresolved inflammatory manifestations and comorbidities [206].
PAF and PAF-like molecules are implicated in inflammatory manifestations occurring in several
infections [206,207], such as HIV [69–74,85], leishmaniosis [208], periodontitis [75–77], or even in
sepsis [67,209]. The relationship between increased PAF levels, overexpression of PAF-R, and the
PAF/PAF-R pathways with several other mediators such as cytokines and inflammatory cells leads to
the progression of such diseases and their related comorbidities.
The most common coexistent diseases associated with chronic infections are CVD, CNS disorders,
and tumour malignancies, which are usually promoted by increased levels of PAF and PAF-related
continuous and unresolved inflammation [57,67–77,85,208]. In addition, PAF seems to act in synergy
with infectious agents to initiate and propagate the disease process, i.e., viral load in HIV-infected
patients was positively correlated with PAF synthesis and levels, while viral products such as
Tat-protein induce PAF synthesis and PAF-related HIV-induced non-AIDS comorbidities, such as
CVD, Kaposi sarcoma, neurodegeneration, and dementia [69–74].
Several PAF inhibitors have been used in infectious diseases with promising results, mostly in relation
to their deterioration of the PAF-related chronic inflammatory manifestations [67,71,74,85,137,207,209–211].
However, in the case of severe sepsis, clinical trials using recombinant human PAF-AH or PAF-R
antagonists failed to reduce the mortality of severe septic patients, although a substantial reduction
in organ dysfunction was achieved [206]. Drugs administrated in such infectious pathologies have
also been thoroughly screened for potential dual actions against both the infectious agent and PAF
activities and synthesis. Several antiretrovirals and their combinations in highly active antiretroviral
therapy have been found to exhibit beneficial outcomes in HIV infected patients through their
capabilities to inhibit PAF activities and to influence PAF metabolism towards reduction of PAF levels
in vitro and in vivo, while similar outcomes have also been found for several antibiotics [68,69,71,73].
Nevertheless, inhibition of PAF activities and modulation of PAF metabolism towards homeostatic
PAF levels seem to be useful therapeutic targets with which to interfere with inflammatory damage
that follows an infection, and thus they may reduce the risk of several comorbidities in infectious
disorders. Although there are several studies published on the importance of a healthy diet for
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 604
23 of 38
infection prevention, further studies are required to establish the potential role of healthy eating to
improve systemic inflammation associated with the PAF pathway and related complications during
chronic infections.
3.2.7. The Role of PAF in Various Inflammation-Related Chronic Diseases
PAF has also played a role in several other inflammation-related chronic diseases and
their related comorbidities, including types I and type II diabetes mellitus [212–214], acute
pancreatitis [215,216], liver injury [217], inflammation-related intestine tissue dysfunction such as
necrotising enterocolitis [218,219], inflammatory ocular diseases [220], vascular dysfunction during
acute lung injury [221], and autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and Crohn’s disease [222–224].
Several PAF inhibitors have been used in these inflammation-related diseases with promising
results [137,216,217,222,225,226]. These effects were mostly due to the deterioration of PAF-related
chronic inflammatory manifestations present in these disorders.
However, apart from using
synthetic or classic PAF antagonists, a dietary profile rich in bioactive molecules, antioxidants,
and food-derived PAF inhibitors such as those present in foods of the Mediterranean diet may provide
beneficial preventive and protective effects against these diseases too, through beneficially inhibiting
PAF activities and/or modulating its metabolism towards homeostatic PAF levels. For example,
the consumption of components of the Med-diet or a traditional Greek Mediterranean diet can reduce
PAF-related inflammatory outcomes such as platelet activity in patients suffering from type II diabetes
mellitus and metabolic syndrome, but also in healthy subjects. This has been attributed to the presence
of PAF inhibitors among other possible effects, and these effects can occur over a short period of
time [227–229]. In addition, the use of probiotics has exhibited beneficial effects against necrotising
enterocolitis [218]; this is unsurprising, as fermented dairy products, which are also components
of the Med-diet, are rich in PAF inhibitors and have also exhibited beneficial outcomes in several
inflammation-related intestine dysfunctions [3].
3.3. Targeting the PAF Pathways and Metabolism –Benefi
cial Outcomes of the Mediterranean Diet
Common junctions in the mechanistic crosstalk of inflammatory mediators, signalling pathways,
and cellular interactions that occur during chronic and unresolved inflammatory manifestations
seem to be promising therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of inflammation-related
chronic diseases. Drug-based therapeutic interventions targeting inflammatory mediators such as
cytokines (i.e., by using specific antibodies against pro-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors)
and eicosanoids (i.e., by using specific inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2) have also been proposed,
and relative trials such as CANTOS are still in progress. However, such approaches can sometimes
provide undesirable effects and may leave the individual immunocompromised and at a greater risk of
infections, since disruption of the physiological balance seems to be a risky strategy [230,231], which is
clearly behind the multifaceted effects of such mediators.
On the other hand, since PAF and its related inflammatory cascades belong to the most vital
joint mechanistic pathways of inflammation-related chronic disorders, the exploration of possible
therapeutic approaches targeting PAF and its related pathways may provide better outcomes. Focus
initially was given to the PAF/PAF-R interaction, thus inhibiting the exacerbation of the complex
PAF inflammatory pathways [89,134–137].
There are several agonists of synthetic and natural
origin [57,89,134–137,140,232], which can competitively or noncompetitively displace PAF from
its binding sites on PAF-R and thus directly inhibit the PAF/PAF-R related pathways and PAF
activities. Furthermore, other similar molecules can indirectly affect the PAF/PAF-R pathways by
affecting the up-stream and/or downstream microenvironment of PAF-R, lipid, rafts, and other related
cellular receptors.
Even though such specific PAF antagonists for the PAF/PAF-R pathway have exhibited promising
results, the most prominent beneficial effects have been derived from polar lipids and polar
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 604
24 of 38
lipid extracts derived from several foods, particularly from foods in the Med-diet (Figure 1B
and Table 1) [56,57,80,81,103,142,146–159,162–165,233,234].
These Med-diet polar lipids exhibit
in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory activities through either directly or indirectly inhibiting
the PAF/PAF-R pathways and thus PAF activities, but also by downregulating its levels through
modulating the activities of key metabolic enzymes of PAF by either upregulation of the PAF catabolic
enzymes and/or the downregulation of the basic PAF biosynthetic enzymes (Figures 2C and 3C,
and Table 1) [57,80,81,103,146,148].
Notably, the uptake of such dietary polar lipids seems to beneficially affect the functionality
of HDL lipoproteins, especially in atherosclerotic conditions. HDL has been characterised as the
‘good’ cholesterol, since not only does it remove excess cholesterol from the blood stream and from
atherosclerotic plaques, but it has also exhibited anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties
through a plethora of cardioprotective enzymes bonded in HDL, including the aforementioned PAF-AH
enzyme activity, which is the main catabolic enzyme of PAF [110]. These HDL-associated activities
contribute to the maintenance of endothelial cell homeostasis, which protects the cardiovascular
system [235]. Plasma PAF-AH is also found in atherosclerotic lesions, since it comigrates there
along with the lipoproteins (i.e., LDL), where it is incorporated. Plasma PAF-AH (Lp-PLA2) mainly
plays an anti-inflammatory role in leukocyte/platelet/endothelium activation and seems to suppress
atherogenic changes in plasma lipoproteins (such as LDL) by promoting the catabolism of PAF and
by removing oxidised phospholipids present in Ox-LDL, including oxidised phospholipids that
mimic PAF, which are generated by oxidative modifications of lipoproteins such as LDL during
pro-atherogenic and atherosclerotic events [107,109,110]. Thus, during inflammatory cascades that
cause increased PAF levels, this isoform of PAF-AH (LpPLA2) seems to be activated as a homeostatic
mechanism to downregulate these events by downregulating the levels of PAF and oxidised
phospholipids as a terminator signal [236]. However, during persistent and prolonged inflammatory
cascades and persistent oxidation of plasma lipoproteins, plasma PAF-AH is progressively inactivated
(plasma PAF-AH is incorporated mainly in LDL) and loses its capacity to protect against the
pro-inflammatory actions of PAF and PAF-like lipids [98]. Because of that, but also because of the
activities of the oxidised sub products of PAF-AH actions in LDL oxidised phospholipids, the use of
plasma PAF-AH as an atherogenic biomarker and therapeutic target has been debated [109,236].
Nevertheless, HDL and its enzymes, including PAF-AH, seem to protect against these
manifestations. The focus has been placed on increasing HDL levels as one of the main goals of
dietary interventions and drug administration for cardioprotection [110]. Dietary intake of bioactive
polar lipids, particularly those baring ω-3 PUFAs, increase HDL levels and the incorporation of such
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant dietary polar lipids to HDL, thus providing an additional protective
mechanism by increasing plasma PAF-AH activity and protecting the HDL enzymes (such as PAF-AH)
from oxidation-related inactivation. This is in agreement with the beneficial in vitro and in vivo effects
of several dietary polar lipids, especially on PAF metabolism and HDL biofunctionality [56].
PAF can generate ROS, and oxidative stress is a key feature of the atherothrombotic processes in
the pathology of CVD. Therefore, it is important to recognise that foods of the Med-diet such as fruit
and vegetables are high in chemical constituents, many of which are regarded as powerful antioxidants,
such as vitamins A, C, and E [237]. Despite positive findings from in vitro studies, clinical trials have
consistently failed to show a benefit for the use of antioxidants, as associations between plasma
concentrations of antioxidant vitamins and protection against CVD have proved elusive, and large
interventional trials have failed to conclusively show any benefit of their administration [238–241].
Despite this, the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition (EPIC) Norfolk study
found that increased plasma concentrations of vitamin C were inversely associated with CVD-related
mortality and all-cause mortality. The study found that this increase was due to increased intake of
fruit and vegetables, which led to an approximate 20% decrease in CVD mortality [242]. However,
a meta-analysis has shown that vitamin C supplementation did not reduce cardiovascular events;
thus, the antioxidant effects of vitamin C were not responsible for the beneficial effects of increased
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 604
25 of 38
consumption of fruit and vegetables [243]. A large-scale, 20-year study found that diets rich in vitamin
C were associated with a lower incidence of stroke, but no coronary heart disease in the elderly [244].
Considering these findings, it may be the case that vitamin C may not be the active agent that induced
the effects witnessed in the Norfolk study, but although eating fruit and vegetables will increase
plasma vitamin C levels, the effects observed may be through other fruit- and vegetable-derived
nutrients [241], or synergism between multiple nutrients that affect different mechanisms including
inflammation through the mechanisms of the PAF pathways [245].
The bioavailability of vitamins, phenolic compounds, and other antioxidants is often cited as
the main reason that in vitro and ex vivo studies do not seem to agree [237]. For instance, some
antioxidants such as phenolic compounds are effectively screened out by the gut of rapidly metabolised
and excreted [246]. Plasma concentrations of phenolic compounds are typically in the nanomolar
range—too low to have a direct impact on antioxidant capacity [241]. However, many of these
antioxidant molecules do seem to possess beneficial effects upon consumption, including the idea that
they induce indirect antioxidant activity by acting as a mild toxin to stimulate a general xenobiotic
and/or an antioxidant response [237]. Further research is required to elucidate the effects of certain
biomolecules against ROS and inflammatory pathways.
Overall, the protective outcomes of the adoption of Med-diet towards chronic diseases seem
to be associated with the pleiotropic beneficial effects of its bioactive microconstituents that are not
only limited to increasing plasma-HDL levels, functionality, and providing better stability against
oxidation, but mainly on their effects on the levels, activities, and metabolism of key-inflammatory
mediators such as PAF [56,57]. However, more in vivo results are needed in several chronic disorders
and their inflammation-related manifestations in order to further support these findings. In particular,
clinical trials implementing dietary patterns such as the Med-diet that are rich in bioactive polar lipids
interacting with the PAF/PAF-R pathways and metabolism are required to gain further insight into
the role of PAF in chronic diseases.
4. Conclusions
In this review, we clarify the roles of risk factors, such as plasma cholesterol and the importance
of causative agents for chronic diseases, namely chronic and unresolved inflammation and its
manifestations. Instead of cholesterol, targeting and treatment of inflammation will lead to lower side
effects in chronic disorders. The overall outcomes and the extensive paradigms of the beneficial effects
of the Mediterranean diet against the inflammatory milieu, without any reported side effects so far,
have radically shifted attention away from the lipid-centric hypotheses and the subsequent trends for
targeting cholesterol towards more effective approaches against inflammation, which is the causative
factors of chronic diseases.
Therefore, the causative role of inflammation in the onset and progression of several chronic
disorders is summarised with respect to the role of PAF and its related inflammatory cascades, which
seem to serve as common junctions of the inflammatory milieu. The coexistence of several risk factors
seems to upstream pro-inflammatory stimuli (i.e., cytokines, oxidative stress, PAF itself, etc.), leading
to increased levels of PAF that, through the PAF/PAF-R pathways, attenuate the initial signal, while
downstream inflammatory cascades, in combination with inactivation of homeostatic mechanisms
such as PAF catabolism, can result in chronic and unresolved inflammatory manifestations and related
chronic disorders.
Common junctions, such as PAF and its related inflammatory pathways, seem to be
promising therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of the onset and progression of
inflammation-related chronic diseases, particularly CVD. Implementation of healthy lifestyle choices
based on appropriate dietary interventions and exercise have exhibited beneficial outcomes and
health benefits, without noticeable side effects. Adoption of dietary patterns such as the Med-diet
provides bioactive food microconstituents with pleiotropic beneficial effects that are not limited to
decreasing co-absorption of cholesterol and increasing plasma HDL levels and functionality, but mainly
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 604

by providing better stability against oxidation and inflammation. Therefore, microconstituents such
as polar lipids and vitamins present in foods of the Med-diet beneficially affect the levels, activities,
and metabolism of key inflammatory mediators implicated in chronic diseases, including the PAF
pathway, towards reducing inflammation and acquiring homeostasis, which can lead to reduced risk
of inflammation-related chronic disorders.
Nature has provided us with a wide range of dietary weapons, which, if appropriately combined
in dietary patterns such as the Med-diet, can beneficially contribute to improving our quality of
life, health, and life expectancy by equilibrating the inflammatory milieu to normal levels and thus
preventively reducing the risk of inflammation-related chronic disorders. Let us not forget the words
of Hippocrates of Kos (460-377 BC), who is universally recognised as the father of modern medicine:
“Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food”.
