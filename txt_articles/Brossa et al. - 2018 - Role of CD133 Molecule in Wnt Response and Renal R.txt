ABSTRACT
Renal repair after injury is dependent on clonal expansion of proliferation-competent cells. In the
human kidney, the expression of CD133 characterizes a population of resident scattered cells with
resistance to damage and ability to proliferate. However, the biological function of the CD133 mol-
ecule is unknown. By RNA sequencing, we found that cells undergoing cisplatin damage lost the
CD133 signature and acquired metanephric mesenchymal and regenerative genes such as SNAIL1,
KLF4, SOX9, and WNT3. CD133 was reacquired in the recovery phase. In CD133-Kd cells, lack of
CD133 limited cell proliferation after injury and was specifically correlated with deregulation of
Wnt signaling and E-cadherin pathway. By immunoprecipitation, CD133 appeared to form a com-
plex with E-cadherin and b-catenin. In parallel, CD133-Kd cells showed lower b-catenin levels in
basal condition and after Wnt pathway activation and reduced TCF/LEF promoter activation in
respect to CD1331 cells. Finally, the lack of CD133 impaired generation of nephrospheres while
favoring senescence. These data indicate that CD133 may act as a permissive factor for b-catenin
signaling, preventing its degradation in the cytoplasm. Therefore, CD133 itself appears to play a
functional role in renal tubular repair through maintenance of proliferative response and control
of senescence. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2018;7:283–294
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
In the human kidney, the expression of CD133 characterizes a population of resident scattered
cells with resistance to damage and ability to proliferate. However, the biological function of
the CD133 molecule is unknown. It was found that the CD133 molecule, expressed on human
tubular cells, may act as a permissive factor for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, regulating cell pro-
liferative response after damage, together with limiting cell senescence. These data may con-
tribute to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in renal tissue repair.
INTRODUCTION
Acute kidney injury, defined as an abrupt loss of
proper kidney function, currently affects up to 7%
of hospitalized patients, with those treated in
intensive care facing the highest risk [1]. An
increasing amount of evidence indicates that, in
spite of an apparent functional repair, renal tissue
is permanently damaged after injury and does not
completely return to its original state. This may
favor the development of fibrosis and the suscep-
tibility to progression toward chronic kidney dis-
ease [2, 3].
Studies aimed to elucidate the process of
renal tissue repair following an acute damage
identified that it is mediated by proliferation of
resident tubular cells [4, 5]. The nature of the
regenerating cells has been attributed, in mice,
to both de-differentiation of tubular mature cells
[6] and/or activation of resident cells with
progenitor characteristics [7]. Indeed, genetic studies
in mice recently showed that renal repair is depend-
ent on clonal expansion of segment restricted unipo-
tent cells, identified as proliferation-competent cells
[8]. In mice, markers such as Sox-9, vimentin, and
CD24 have been used to label scattered cells along
the nephron [9–11]. In the human kidney, CD241/
CD1331 cells within different nephron segments
appear as a population of resident renal progenitor
cells (RPCs) with the ability of expansion, self-
renewal, and epithelial differentiation both in vitro
and in vivo [11–14]. Indeed, the CD1331 population
appears to be the proliferating one in human biop-
sies of patients undergoing renal insults, further
implying its role in renal repair [14, 15].
The CD133 molecule is a pentaspan-trans-
membrane glycoprotein [16, 17], recognized by a
specific glycosylation dependent epitope using
the AC133 Ab. It has been found to be expressed

TISSUE-SPECIFIC PROGENITOR AND STEM CELLS
 by immature cells such as hematopoietic stem/progenitors,
tissue-specific progenitors, and developing intestinal and neuronal
cells [18–20]. In cultured CD1331 renal cells, CD133 has been
shown to be upregulated by hypoxia [21]. However, the mole-
cule’s biological function along with its possible modulation during
kidney damage is currently unknown.
In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the biological func-
tion of CD133 expressed by tubular cells during damage, and its
possible implication in the repairing process. Our data showed that
CD133 is involved in the early response to Wnt signaling, through
regulation of b-catenin levels. Moreover, CD133 favored cell prolif-
eration in the regenerative phase and limited cell senescence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation of Human RPCs
CD1331 RPCs were obtained from biopsies of normal tissue of a
human kidney surgically removed for polar carcinoma per-
formed (after the approval of ethical committee for the use of
human tissue of Molinette Hospital; n. 168/2004), as previously
described [13]. In particular, the outer medullary tissue at the
opposite pole of the tumor was used and absence of tumor infil-
tration was evaluated by a pathologist. Tissue samples were cut
to obtain 3–5 mm3 fragments, digested in 0.1% collagenase type
I (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) for 30 minutes at 378C and subse-
quently forced through a graded series of meshes for the sepa-
ration of cell components from stroma and aggregates. The
filtrate was then pelleted by centrifugation. To recover CD1331
cells, the single cell suspension underwent magnetic separation
for CD133 (Mylteni, Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, CD133
Cell Isolation Kit, containing the anti-CD133/1 mAb, clone
AC133). CD1331 cells (>98% as evaluated by cytofluorimetric
analysis) were resuspended in expansion medium (Endothelial
Basal Medium plus supplement kit; CambrexBioScience, East
Rutherford, NJ, USA) and plated at density 1 3 104 viable cells
per cm2. CD133 expression in the 12 cell lines in study tested
before experiments of transfection and RNA sequencing was
90.5% 6 8.8%. Cells were used until passage six and maintained
their phenotype during the passages.
Generation of CD133 Knockdown (CD133-Kd) RPCs
For CD133 knockdown pGIPZlentiviral Vectors (Open Biosystems,
Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA) carrying two different shRNA
against CD133 (shPROM1 and shPROM2), or a scrambled
sequence (GFP) were used.
shPROM1: oligo ID: V2LHS_71819 sequence: GAGTCCTTCCTAT
AGAACA
shPROM2: oligo ID: V2LHS_71820 sequence: CTGTTGGTGATT
TGTATAA
The cell line 293T was transfected with constructs using Vira-
Power Packaging Mix (Life Technologies, ThermoFischer, Waltham,
MA, USA) for lentiviruses production according to manufacturer’s
instructions. After titering the lentiviral stock, CD1331 RPCs, iso-
lated from 12 different nephrectomy specimens, were infected
with lentiviral particles following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were selected by puromycin (Gibco, ThermoFischer) (1 lg/
ml) and, after 6 days, antibiotic-resistant cells were expanded. Cell
infection was considered effective when the percentage of GFP1
cells was >95%, and the reduction in CD133 protein expression
was >70%, as assessed by FACS and Western blot analysis.
RNA Sequencing
For RNA sequencing library preparation, approximately 3 lg of
total RNA isolated from CD1331 (GFP) and CD133-Kd RPCs
(n 5 3), all at passage #4, were subjected to poly(A) selection, and
libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit
(Illumina, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiScan SQ plat-
form. Reads were mapped to the Homo sapiens hg19 reference
assembly using TopHat v2.0.10,46 and RPKMs (reads per kilobase
per million mapped reads) for transcripts were calculated with
Cufflinks v2.1.1.47. Transcripts with RPKM �1 were considered
expressed and further investigated for differential expression anal-
ysis between cisplatin treated (CIS GFP) or untreated cells (GFP).
Genes with log2(CIS GFP/GFP) �1 or �–1 were considered modu-
lated by cisplatin treatment. Modulated genes were subsequently
analyzed in shPROM1/2 cells, at passage #4. Genes differentially
modulated by cisplatin treatment in shPROM1/2 cells versus GFP
cells (Fold change: log2(CIS shPROM1/2/CIS GFP) �–1 or �1)
were defined as upregulated or downregulated by CD133-Kd in
cisplatin treated cells. Functional Enrichment analysis tool (Fun-
Rich, http://www.funrich.org/) [22] and PANTHER software
(http://pantherdb.org/) were used for pathways enrichment anal-
ysis. Gene Ontology analysis for biological processes was con-
ducted using BINGO plug-in from Cytoscape software [23].
Real Time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from different cell preparations using Trizol
reagent (Ambion, ThermoFischer) according to manufacturer’s
protocol. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically (Nanodrop
ND-1000, Wilmington, DE). First-strand cDNA was produced from
200 ng of total RNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Tran-
scription Kit (Applied Biosystems, ThermoFischer). For gene
expression analysis, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was per-
formed in 20-ml reaction mixtures containing 5 ng of cDNA tem-
plate, the sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers (purchased
from MWG-Biotech, Eurofins Scientific, Bruxelles, Belgium) and
the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).
GAPDH mRNA was used as housekeeping normalizer. Fold change
expression respect to control was calculated for all samples. The
sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers used are shown in the
Supporting Information Table S1.
Protein Extraction and Western Blot
For protein analysis, cells were lysed at 48C for 30 minutes in RIPA
buffer (20 nM Tris�HCl, 150 nM NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS,
1% Triton X-100, pH 7.8) supplemented with protease and phos-
phatase inhibitors cocktail and PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich). Aliquots of
cell lysates containing 20–30 mg of proteins, as evaluated by Brad-
ford, run on 4%–20% Mini-Protean TGX Stain–Free Gels (BIO-RAD,
Hercules, CA, USA) under reducing conditions and blotted onto
PVDF membrane filters using the iBLOT system (Life Technologies).
For Western blot analysis, anti-CD133 (AC133 epitope) (Miltenyi
Biotech), anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA),
anti-b-catenin (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), anti-E-
cadherin (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and anti GSK3
alpha and beta (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) Abs were used. Data are
expressed as mean 6 SD of band intensity normalized to actin of
six independent experiments.

 Cytofluorimetric Analysis
For cytofluorimetric analysis, CD1331 and CD133-Kd RPCs were
detached from plates using the non-enzymatic cell dissociation
solution (Sigma-Aldrich), and stained (30 minutes at 48C) with allo-
phycocyanin (APC)-conjugated CD133 antibody (AC133 epitope)
(MiltenyiBiotec). Isotype (MiltenyiBiotec) was used as negative
control. Cells were then subjected to cytofluorimetric analysis
(FACScan, Becton Dickinson), and the geometric mean of CD133-
APC fluorescence intensity was measured.
Cisplatin Induced Damage
Toxic damage induced by cell treatment with 5 lg/ml of cisplatin.
Cisplatin (Vinci Biochem, Vinci, FI, Italy) was dissolved in DMSO,
suspended in 0.9% NaCl to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and
stored at 48C following manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were
treated with cisplatin in RPMI plus 2% Fetal Calf Serum for the
evaluation of the early phases of damage. During cell recovery cul-
tured medium was changed every 2 days until day 8 (recovery
phase).
Wnt/b-Catenin Signaling Stimulation
The Wnt signaling pathway was stimulated using a Wnt activator
CHIR99021 (Sigma-Aldrich), dissolved in DMSO up to a final con-
centration of 3 mM and stored at 2208C according to manufac-
turer’s instructions. For Wnt signaling activation, CD1331 and
CD133-Kd RPCs were treated with 6 lM of CHIR99021 in RPMI 2%
Fetal Calf Serum for 1, 3, or 6 hours. Data are normalized to
CD1331 (GFP) not treated cells (CTL) and to one and expressed as
mean 6 SD of at least three different experiments.
Luciferase Reporter Assay
For the evaluation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling, 8 3 103 cells per
well were seeded in a 96-well plate. The day after, cells were
transfected in serum and antibiotic free DMEM with construct car-
rying the TCF/LEF promoter for b-catenin. 48 hours later, cells
were lysed with GloLysis Buffer (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA) for
15 minutes. Luciferin was then added and the luminescent signal
was measured according to manufacturer’s instructions. Data are
expressed as mean 6 SD of at least three independent experi-
ments performed in triplicates normalized to GFP
.
Immunoprecipitation
For protein immunoprecipitation 10 lg of anti-E-cadherin Ab (BD
Biosciences) were added to 1 mg of Magnetic Beads (SureBeads-
Megnatic Beads, BIO-RAD) and the mix was left rotating at room
temperature for 1 hour according to manufacturer’s protocol.
After three washes with PBS-Tween 0.1% for the removal of
unbound antibodies, 1 mg of CD1331 cell lysates was added to
Beads-Ab complex and left for 1 hour rotating at room tempera-
ture. For the elution, the new complex formed (Beads-Ab-Pro-
teins), was suspended in 100 ll of Laemmli buffer (BIO-RAD) with
10% b-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 10 minutes at 708C.
Beads were then magnetically removed and 30 ll of the eluted
complex were then used for protein analysis by Western blot.
Cell Proliferation
Cell proliferation was assessed by the incorporation of 5-bromo-2-
deoxyuridine (BrdU) into cellular DNA after 24 hour culture in
expansion medium, according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Optical density
was measured with an ELISA reader (BioRad) at 415 nm (reference
490 nm). Experiments were performed in triplicates; data are
expressed as mean 6 SD of the media of absorbance of at least
three independent experiments, normalized to CD1331 cisplatin-
treated cells.
Spheroid Formation
Renal CD1331 and CD133-Kd cells were plated in 6-well culture
plates at a density of 104 cells per milliliter in non-adherent
medium consisting of serum free DMEM F12 supplemented with
10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 20 ng/ml epidermal
growth factor, 5 mg/ml insulin and 0.4% bovine serum albumin
(Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described [24] and maintained in
hypoxia chambers (1% O2 and 5% CO2) (Stem Cells Technologies,
Vancouver, Canada) for 72 hours. Cells were then observed with a
Nikon inverted microscope. For each experimental condition, at
least 30 images with 34 magnification for spheroid number evalu-
ation and 10 images with 320 magnification for spheroid area
measurement were taken. For the assessment of spheroid form-
ing capacity, images were analyzed with imageJ software. The
number and area of spheroids were evaluated in each 34 and
320 image, respectively.
MTT Assay
For the evaluation of sphere vitality MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-
2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was performed.
Briefly, spheroids deriving from 100,000 cells after 72 hours of cul-
ture in hypoxic conditions were centrifuged and resuspended in
300 ll of PBS solution for efficient disaggregation. Spheroid-
derived cells were then plated in 96-well plates in triplicates and
analyzed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Merck-
Millipore). Data are expressed as mean 6 SD of the media absorb-
ance of three different experiments performed in triplicates and
normalized to GFP.
Evaluation of Senescence
Cells were infected and cultured for five passages, up to a total of
10 cell divisions of the starting population. GFP, shPROM1,
shPROM2 cells were then plated in 6-well culture plates at density
of 1 3 104 cell per cm2 for b-galactosidase assay (b-gal staining
kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), or in 58 cm2 dishes for DNA
extraction and telomere length evaluation. Cells were washed
with PBS, fixed and incubated with b-galactosidase substrate
staining solution for 16 hours at 378C, according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Cells were then observed with a Nikon
inverted microscope and for each experimental condition at least
20 images were taken with 310 magnification. The number of b-
galactosidase positive cells was then evaluated for each image.
For the evaluation of telomere length, genomic DNA was iso-
lated from GFP and CD133-Kd cells of five different lines with a
DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) and
quantified spectrophotometrically with Nanodrop (Nanodrop ND-
1000, Wilmington, DE). Relative telomere length was determined
using an optimized assay [25, 26] originally described by Cawthon
[27]. Separate PCR experiments were performed for telomere
(TEL) and 36B4, a single-copy gene (S), in 96-well optical reaction
plates (Applied Biosystems). Briefly, 100 ng of DNA sample were
transferred in triplicate to identical positions for TEL as well as for
36B4 experiments, together with 10 ll of Power SYBR Green PCR
master mix (Applied Biosystems) and the sequence specific oligo-
nucleotide primers. The 36B4 experiments were performed using
Brossa, Papadimitriou, Collino et al.

RESULTS
Characterization of Adult Human RPCs
CD133 has been widely used as a marker for the isolation of renal
human cells with the phenotype of undifferentiated progenitors
and the ability to proliferate after damage [13, 14]. In the current
study, we aimed to elucidate the function of CD133 in renal tubu-
lar cells and its possible modulation during damage. To better
characterize the phenotype of CD1331 RPCs we first assessed
their transcriptional profile by RNA sequencing. The cultured cells
expressed highly genes previously reported both by in vivo and ex
vivo studies, as characteristics of RPCs [28]. In particular, in our
CD1331 RPCs we confirmed the expression of the progenitor
markers CD24 and PAX2, as well as of vimentin and cytokeratins
18 and 19 (Table 1).The stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase

cium bind protein A6 (Table 1), all described as characteristic of
scattered tubular cells [11, 12, 15, 29], were found highly
expressed in our CD1331 RPCs. In addition, these cells expressed
the epithelial cell adhesion molecule, known to be expressed by
adult tubular CD1331 cells [30], while genes characteristic of
metanephric mesenchyme (such as FOXD1, SIX2, CITED1, OSR1,

 analysis showed the upregulation of 964 genes and the downreg-
ulation of 1,521 genes in CD1331 RPC cells submitted to cisplatin
treatment in respect to control untreated cells. Gene ontology
analysis showed that cisplatin treatment induced upregulation of
genes mainly associated with the following biological processes:
nucleic acid metabolism, transcription regulation, cell cycle, prolif-
eration, regulation of enzymatic activities, and cell death proc-
esses (Supporting Information Fig. S1). Downregulated genes
were involved in multiple other functions, such as cell motility
and Rho signal transduction, TGF-b receptor signaling, chromatin
remodeling, morphogenesis, regulation of gene expression, and
cytoskeleton reorganization (Supporting Information Fig. S2).
Moreover, RNA sequencing data showed that cisplatin treatment
for 8 hours induced downregulation of the majority of genes char-
acteristic of CD1331 RPCs, including CD133 itself, PAX2, VCAM1
and cadherin (Fig. 1A). At variance, genes characteristic of meta-
nephric mesenchyme such as KLF4, SNAI2 and FOXD1, along with
pro-regenerative genes WNT3 and SOX9 were found upregulated
in cisplatin treated RPCs (Fig. 1A). Cap mesenchyme genes (SIX2,
CITED1, and EYA1) remained under the threshold of 1 RKPM. The
modulation of PAX2, VCAM1, SOX9, and FOXD1 was confirmed by
qRT-PCR (Fig. 1B). CD133 expression in cisplatin treated RPCs was
confirmed as downregulated at 48 hours, to be re-acquired 1
week later (recovery phase) at RNA level (Fig. 1C). The observed
downregulation was further detected at protein level by evalua-
tion of both total CD133 by Western blot analysis and of the cell
surface molecule by cytofluorimetric analysis (Fig. 1D, 1E). More-
over, the modulation of the surface CD133 molecule was con-
firmed on freshly sorted CD1331 cells (>98% positivity for CD133,
Supporting Information Fig. S3).
Finally, to exclude that the observed modulation in CD133
expression was due to differential loss/expansion of the
CD1331 fraction over the CD1332 fraction present in the RPC
lines (CD1332 cells: 8.8 6 6.1, n 5 4), cells in culture were
sorted on the basis of CD133 expression and the positive and
negative populations labeled with green and red dyes,

 respectively. Cells were further mixed at 9:1 ratio, subjected to
cisplatin damage, and their respective number followed, as
described [14]. The ratio of CD133 positive and negative popu-
lation did not significantly vary over time, indicating the
absence of differential loss/expansion of the CD1331 fraction
after damage and recovery (Supporting Information Fig. S3).
Interestingly, the CD1332 cells did not acquire positivity for
CD133 (Supporting Information Fig. S3).
These data indicate that CD1331 RPCs lost the characteristic
CD133 signature and upregulated genes needed for the reparative
process during the early phase of cisplatin damage, modulating
their phenotype toward a more mesenchymal state.
Gene Modulation upon Cisplatin Treatment in
CD133-Kd Cells
To further investigate the role of CD133 in cell response upon cis-
platin damage, we generated CD133 knockdown RPCs (CD133-Kd)
by lentiviral infection, using two vectors silencing PROM1 gene
(shPROM1 and shPROM2) and a scrambled sequence (GFP). The
CD133-Kd RPCs were silenced at high efficiency, as evaluated by
Western blot, qRT-PCR and cytofluorimetric analysis (Fig. 2). RNA
sequencing analysis of CD133-Kd RPCs showed only the specific
downregulation of PROM1, indicating no effect of transfection on
the cell phenotype (not shown). We then compared cisplatin-
induced gene modulations in both CD1331 (GFP) and CD133-Kd
RPCs. We firstly sorted only transcripts significantly modified in
GFP cells by cisplatin. Subsequently, by comparative analysis, we
found 102 genes differentially expressed in shPROM1 cells in
respect to GFP cells after cisplatin damage. Enrichment analysis of
pathways was then conducted using PANTHER bioinformatics tool.
An over-representation of genes related to Wnt and cadherin sig-
naling pathways was observed (Fig. 3A). In addition, PDGF signal-
ing, Alzheimer-related and DNA replication pathways were also
highlighted (Fig. 3A). Sixty-nine of the 102 modulated transcripts,
were confirmed in both shPROM1 and shPROM2 cells after cispla-
tin damage (mean shPROM1/2 vs. GFP) (Supporting Information
Table S2). The analysis of the common genes, conducted using
Funrich software, confirmed an enrichment in genes involved in
Wnt pathway, along with the DNA repairing process and telomer-
ase synthesis associated pathways (Fig. 3B), supporting the
Figure 3.

 possible implication of these pathways in CD133-mediated
response of RPCs to cisplatin.
CD133 Is Implicated in Wnt/b-Catenin Signaling
We therefore focused our attention on the role of CD133 in the
activation of Wnt pathway. Interestingly, CD133-Kd cell lines
showed a reduced expression of Wnt4 after cisplatin-induced
damage in respect to GFP cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, CD133-Kd
cells showed an impaired response to the pharmacological activa-
tion of Wnt signaling pathway using CHIR99021 [31] (Fig. 4B). The
role of CD133 in Wnt signaling activation was confirmed using a
luciferase assay reporting the activation of the TCF/LEF promoter.
As shown in Figure 4C, luciferase activity in CD1331 RPCs was sig-
nificantly higher than the one in CD133-Kd cell lines, indicating a
reduced b-catenin activation in CD133-Kd cells. This was not
related to differential levels of GSK3 alpha and beta in CD133-Kd
cell lines in respect to CD1331 RPCs, as assessed by Western blot
analysis (not shown).
We then analyzed the possible interaction of CD133 with b-
catenin and E-cadherin, as reported in other stem cell types [32].
Western blot analysis after immunoprecipitation of E-cadherin
showed the concomitant presence of CD133 and b-catenin, sug-
gesting that CD133 and E-cadherin may form a complex at the
membrane level with b-catenin, thus limiting its cytoplasmic deg-
radation (Fig. 4D). Indeed, b-catenin levels were significantly
lower in CD133-Kd cells in respect to CD1331 RPCs both in basal
culture conditions and upon stimulation with b-catenin stabilizer
CHIR99021 (Fig. 4E).Taken together, these data confirm the results

 obtained by RNA sequencing analysis, involving CD133 molecule
in the regulation of Wnt canonical pathway in RPCs.
CD133 Is Involved in the Regenerative Response After
Damage
Tubular cell recovery after damage appears to be mediated by clo-
nal proliferation of Wnt-responsive cells [8]. We therefore, eval-
uated whether CD133 molecule could play a role in the
regenerative response, by studying proliferation of CD133-Kd
cells after cisplatin-induced damage, and generation of sphe-
roids under hypoxia (Fig. 5). When CD1331 and CD133-Kd
RPCs were subjected to cisplatin treatment, they similarly
underwent reduction in cell number (Fig. 5A). However,
CD133-Kd cell lines exhibited a significantly lower proliferative
capacity during the recovery phase compared to the CD1331
RPCs (Fig. 5A). In addition, evaluation of kidney spheroid
generation in hypoxic conditions showed an impaired capacity
of CD133-Kd cells to generate spheres, which were less in
number and significantly smaller in surface area (Fig. 5B, 5C).
The

spheroids

appeared reduced as well (Fig. 5C). These data suggest a role
of CD133 in the maintenance of clonal proliferation of RPCs,
an important process for the regenerative capacity of the
kidney.
CD133 Expression Limits Cell Senescence
Finally, we evaluated the role of CD133 in cell senescence, a mech-
anism of exhaustion occurring after repeated proliferation cycles

 [33]. CD1331 and CD133-Kd RPCs were maintained in culture for
five passages, and b-galactosidase expression and telomere length
were evaluated at passage six. The number of b-galactosidase
expressing cells undergoing senescence appeared significantly
higher in the CD133-Kd cells compared to their CD1331 control
(Fig. 6A, 6B). To further confirm these data, we assessed the telo-
mere length using an optimized assay originally described by Caw-
thon [27]. The evaluation of T/S ratio revealed a significant
reduction in telomere length in CD133-Kd cells compared to their
CD1331 controls (Fig. 6C), suggesting an implication of CD133 in
the prevention of cell senescence.
DISCUSSION
The identification of mechanisms involved in proliferation and
repair after injury are still unclear in human tubular cells. In the
present study, we evaluated the role of stem cell marker CD133 in
renal cellular repair at both molecular and functional level. We
found that CD133 regulated b-catenin and that its absence
impaired cell proliferation after injury, clonal generation of
spheres while favored senescence, indicating that CD133 may act
as a permissive factor for Wnt/beta catenin signaling and may
play a role in tissue repair.
During nephrogenesis, CD133 is expressed from the vesicle
stage onwards [34, 35] and marks a population of epithelial differ-
entiated embryonic renal cells [36], while in adult renal tissue is
maintained in unevenly distributed cells, commonly referred to as
scattered cells [11, 13, 14]. Beside CD133, a number of different
markers have been reported as characteristic of these scattered
cells. We here validated the expression of genes characterizing the
progenitor cell phenotype in cultured CD1331 RPCs. In particular,
CD1331 RPCs expressed CD24, vimentin, cytokeratins, VCAM1
and decorin, as previously reported [11, 21, 29] as well as claudin
1, S100A6 [11, 15] and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 [12]. These
data indicate that the phenotype of cultured CD1331 RPCs
reflects the one observed in vivo in human tissues, validating our
in vitro model. The expression of CD133 has been shown to
increase in biopsies of renal tissue after acute tubular necrosis
[14]. It was unclear, however, whether this increase could repre-
sent the expansion of CD1331 RPCs or a de novo acquisition of
CD133. When analyzing the changes occurring in CD1331 RPCs
upon cisplatin damage, we found a down-regulation of the CD133
molecule that was reversed during recovery. This modulation
was accompanied by loss of the characteristic signature reported
for RPCs. In parallel, CD1331 RPCs activated a number of
mesenchymal-associated transcriptional factors including FOXD1
and SNAIL1 as well as SOX9 required for the reparative process.
Indeed, mesenchymal genes are known to be expressed in vivo by
renal tissue after injury in human and murine tissues [9, 30, 37]. It
can be therefore postulated that CD1331 RPCs possess a plastic
phenotype, and that the CD133 molecule marks cells able to con-
tribute to the regeneration processes of the kidney. However,
RPCs did not acquire a phenotype comparable to embryonic
nephron progenitors, characterized by the expression of SIX2,
CITED1, OSR1, and EYA. Indeed, it has been reported that SNAIL1
is required but not sufficient to generate cells with the phenotype
of nephron progenitors [38].
In our in vitro model, we found a rapid (24–48 hours) down-
regulation of CD133 after injury, followed by its re-expression dur-
ing the regeneration phase, characterized by cell proliferation. The

 observed loss of CD133 upon tissue damage (24–48 hours) was
not reported in renal biopsies of AKI patients [15, 16]. In particu-
lar, the description of AKI tissue reported the presence of long
stretches of CD1331 cells in regenerating tubules [15], and associ-
ation of CD133 expression with light microscopic signs of tubular
regeneration such as nuclear prominence or flattening of tubular
cells [16]. It could be speculated that CD133 expression in renal
biopsies of AKI patients may reflect a phase of tubular regenera-
tion occurring in the days after the damage, rather than a phase
of injury. As there is no indication on the timing of the biopsy in
both papers, this cannot be precisely estimated. It is also conceiva-
ble that injuries of a different nature (toxic vs. ischemic) may have
a differential impact on CD133 expression. At variance, our results
are consistent with the analysis of human tissue deriving from
patients undergoing kidney transplant. In fact, patients with
delayed graft function, undergoing acute tubular damage, showed
an early reduction in the number of CD1331 proliferating cells in
respect to pre-transplant biopsies and early graft function tissues
[39]. In this study, CD133 levels were restored within 4 weeks
after transplant [39]. The loss and re-acquisition of CD133 upon
cisplatin damage clearly limit the role of this molecule to the early
or late phases of tissue regeneration. Indeed, a very limited num-
ber of genes showed an altered modulation in the early response
to injury in CD133-Kd cells respect to CD1331 cells. In particular,
genes related to Wnt and E-cadherin signaling were disregulated.
The role of CD133 as inductor of Wnt/b-catenin signaling has
been previously reported in tumor stem cells. In particular, CD133
has been found implicated in Wnt canonical pathway through the
stabilization of Wnt’s primary target b-catenin [40] and the conse-
quent activation of TCF/LEF promoter [41]. Accordingly, we found
that CD133 is associated with E-cadherin and b-catenin, and that
b-catenin levels and transcriptional activity are decreased in
CD133-Kd cells, implying a role for CD133 in b-catenin protection
from degradation. The activation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling is
involved in kidney damage by promoting cellular repair [42, 43],
and in particular by inducing the proliferation of regenerating clo-
nal cells in tubules [8]. Therefore, CD1331 cells appear a relevant
population involved in kidney regeneration. In addition, these
data parallel the role of CD133, expressed on human renal tissue,
with the one of Lgr5, a Wnt target gene restricted to clusters of
undifferentiated epithelial cells residing within tubular structures
in the early postnatal kidneys [7]. The Lgr51 cells have been
shown to selectively contribute to the development of Henle’s
loop and distal tubules [7].
The function of CD133 has been previously associated with
glycolytic metabolism and invasion of tumor stem cells [44]. In our
study, we identified a functional role of CD133 in normal RPCs
related to the proliferation and to prevention of cell senescence.
In particular, our data showed that CD133 loss limited cell prolifer-
ation after injury, in the recovery phase, and cell ability to grow in
spheres under hypoxia. In this last condition, kidney cells are
known to enhance the expression of stemness related markers
and tubulogenic potential [45, 46]. Our data, suggesting an impli-
cation of CD1331 RPCs in the repairing process of renal tissue as
well as an ability to survive an insult, are in line with data reported
in an ex vivo explant model, in which CD1331 scattered cells
selectively survived an ischemia–reperfusion damage [15]. Finally,
our study showed that the expression of CD133 is pivotal in the
regulation of cell senescence, a characteristic of cell exhaustion
after repeated proliferation cycles. Senescence, physiologically
associated with aging, reduces the ability of tissue repair and may
be correlated with maldifferentiation and fibrosis development
after injury [33]. Considering these implications of CD133 in the
process of renal tissue repair, our data suggest that CD133 does
not solely represent a stem cell marker, but rather a functional
protein.
CONCLUSION
Our data indicate that CD133 identifies a Wnt-responding popu-
lation, able to de-differentiate and proliferate in response to
injury. In particular, CD133 itself appears to play a role in the
maintenance of cell homeostasis, clonal proliferation, and renal
tubular repair, by controlling Wnt signaling while limiting cell
senescence.
