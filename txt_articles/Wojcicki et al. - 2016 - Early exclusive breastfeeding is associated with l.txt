ABSTRACT
Background: Telomere length (TL) is a marker of cellular aging,
with the majority of lifetime attrition occurring during the first 4 y.
Little is known about risk factors for telomere shortening in child-
hood.
Objective: We evaluated the relation between early life feeding
variables and preschool TL.
Design: We assessed the relation between dietary, feeding, and weight-
associated risk factors measured from birth and TL from blood samples
taken at 4 y of age (n = 108) and 5 y of age (n = 92) in a cohort of
urban, Latino children (n = 121 individual children). Feeding variables
were evaluated in children with repeat measurements (n = 77).
Results: Mean TL (in bp) was associated with exclusive breastfeed-
ing at 4–6 wk of age (adjusted coefficient: 353.85; 95% CI: 72.81,
634.89; P = 0.01), maternal TL (adjusted coefficient: 0.32; 95% CI:
0.11, 0.54; P , 0.01), and older paternal age (adjusted coefficient:
33.27; 95% CI: 4.10, 62.44; P = 0.03). The introduction of other
foods or drinks in addition to breast-milk or replacement-milk sub-
stitutes before 4–6 wk of age was associated with mean TL at 4 and
5 y of age (adjusted coefficient: 2457.01; 95% CI: 2720.50, 2193.51;
P , 0.01). Infant obesity at 6 mo of age and soda consumption at 4 y
of age mediated the relation in part between exclusive breastfeeding
at 4–6 wk of age and mean TL at 4 and 5 y of age. High soda
consumption at 3 y of age was associated with an accelerated attrition
from 4 to 5 y of age (adjusted coefficient: 2515.14; 95% CI:
2986.06, 241.22; P = 0.03).
Conclusion: Exclusive breastfeeding at 4–6 wk of age may have
long-term effects on child health as evidenced by longer TL at 4 and
5 y of age.

INTRODUCTION
Telomeres, inflammation, and obesity
Telomeres are the protective nucleoprotein structures that
consist of repeated (TTAGGG) DNA sequences and bound pro-
teins that cap the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres shorten as cells
divide in vitro and as human beings age in vivo (1, 2). A telomere-
sequence loss does not happen at a constant rate throughout life but
rather is characterized by a rapid decline from birth through age 4 y
(1, 2). Telomeres shorten w100 bp for each cell division because
of incomplete replication and also likely as a result of exposure to
oxidative damage from chronic inflammation (3, 4).
The guanine base triplets of telomere sequences are highly
sensitive to hydroxyl radical damage that can cause breakage
during DNA replication, which renders telomeres particularly
susceptible to reactive oxygen species–induced damage (5). As
such, a higher free-radical concentration, as is the case in chronic
inflammatory states including obesity and other chronic diseases,
can cause more rapid telomere attrition (6). Meta-analyses of 16
adult studies have suggested an inverse association between adult
BMI and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) (7).
Studies in children of the relation between obesity and shorter
LTL have been inconclusive (8–10). Possibly, the metabolic
complications of obesity including inflammatory processes,
which are more common in adults than in children, and not
obesity per se, are associated with rapid telomere attrition (11).
Telomere length, breastfeeding, and dietary intake
Few studies have examined the relations between telomere
attrition and environmental exposures in early childhood when
the attrition process is greatest (12, 13). Although breastfeeding
has been shown to have a small, consistent, protective effect
against obesity in children in meta-analyses (14) and for chronic
disease in general, to our knowledge, there have been no previous
studies that have examined the relation between early dietary
intake, including breastfeeding and other feeding patterns as-
sociated with or protective against obesity, and telomere length
(TL) attrition in the first 5 y of life.
In adults, dietary factors, including cereal fiber and diets that
are high in fruit and vegetables, that are protective against obesity
have also been shown to be associated with longer TL, and
linoleic acid intake and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption
have been inversely associated with TL (15, 16). We examined
prospective associations between critical early life factors that are

 known to be important for developmental health, specifically
nutritional exposures such as early exclusive breastfeeding and
early adiposity, and shorter TL. We hypothesized that a longer
duration of breastfeeding would be associated with longer TL at
ages 4 and 5 y because of the anti-inflammatory health benefits
that are associated with breastfeeding.
METHODS
Study population and procedures
Latina mothers were recruited prenatally at 2 local hospitals in
San Francisco during the second and third trimesters of preg-
nancy (n = 201) in 2006 and 2007. The cohort has been de-
scribed in previous publications including recruitment and
procedures (17–21). The inclusion criterion was being a Latina
pregnant woman who was expecting a healthy newborn without
any contraindications for breastfeeding, and exclusion criteria
included mothers with insulin-treated gestational diabetes mel-
litus and infant Apgar scores ,7 at 5 min. The cohort was
relatively socioeconomically homogenous with almost all
mothers participating in the Women, Infants, and Children
program and the majority of mothers were foreign born and
Spanish speaking. Briefly, at follow-up from delivery, at 4–6 wk
of age, and subsequently at 6 and 12 mo of age and annually
thereafter, child weight and recumbent length or height (to
calculate the BMI percentile) and waist circumference were
collected. Childhood obesity was defined as having a BMI $95th
percentile (or weight-for-length $95th percentile if the child
was ,2 y of age), and childhood overweight was defined as
having a BMI $85th percentile (or weight-for-length $85th per-
centile if the child was ,2 y of age including children who were at
or above the 95th percentile or obese) with the use of CDC growth
curves (22). Children who were underweight had a BMI less than
or equal to the fifth percentile (if $2 y of age) or weight-for-age
less than or equal to the fifth percentile (if ,2 y of age). Childhood
underweight at birth was defined as having a birth weight ,2500 g,
and obesity at birth was defined as having a birth weight $4000 g.
Childhood abdominal obesity was defined as having a waist-
circumference measurement $90th percentile with the use of
NHANES III definitions (23).
Maternal prenatal BMI (kg/m2) was self-reported and based on
CDC cutoffs for underweight or normal weight (,18.5 or 18.5 to
,25, respectively), overweight (25 to ,30), and obesity ($30)
[http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.
html (24)]. Maternal age and paternal age were analyzed contin-
uously and also dichotomously with the use of advanced maternal
and paternal age as $35 y. Maternal ethnicity was categorized as
either Mexican or Central American origin on the basis of a self-
report with the majority of women originating from Southern
Mexico. Maternal self-reported smoking history and second-
hand-smoke exposure were also collected prenatally, at de-
livery, and at the infant ages of 6 and 12 mo. Medical records
were also reviewed for self-reported smoking.
Chronic childhood overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity
were defined as having multiple measures of overweight (.1
measure), obesity and abdominal obesity (at 4 and 5 y, 2–5 y, or
from 6 mo to 5 y of age) to assess either the impact of chronic
obesity during the preschool years (2–5 y) and chronic obesity
from infancy through preschool (from 6 mo to 5 y of age).
From 4 to 6 wk of age, dietary recall information was collected
by trained research assistants including the initiation of breast-
feeding, breastfeeding duration, exclusive breastfeeding, and the
age of the introduction of solids with the use of 24-h dietary
recalls and food-frequency questionnaires. The consumption of
sugar-sweetened beverages, including sodas and fruit drinks,
100% fruit juice (with no added sugars), flavored milks, and
water were evaluated in relation to the following frequencies:
any, $1 time/wk, $4 times/wk, and daily. Exclusive breast-
feeding was defined as feeding only the infant breast milk with
the exception of medicine and vitamins but with the exclusion of
water and other non–breast-milk liquids with the use of the
WHO’s definition of exclusive breastfeeding (14). The in-
troduction of other foods and liquids at 4–6 wk of age was de-
fined as feeding the infant any other liquid or solids at 4–6 wk of
age with the exclusion of breast milk and other replacement
breast-milk substitutes (infant formulas).
Maternal mental health histories, including depressive
symptoms, clinical depression, and child behavior, were col-
lected as described in Wojcicki et al. (25). All procedures were
approved by the Institutional Review Board and Committee on
Human Research at the University of California, San Francisco,
and mothers provided written consent to approve their partici-
pation and the participation of their children.
TL measurement
We quantified TL via a quantitative polymerase chain reaction
with the use of genomic DNA from dried blood spots obtained
from finger-prick specimens. Samples were taken from 108 four-
year-old Latino children and their mothers, and 92 five-year-old
children during years 4 and 5 of follow-up of our original cohort.
Approximately 175 women and children were approached in
years 4 and 5 to provide blood spot specimens from children. We
collected 108 samples at 4 y of age and 92 samples at 5 y of age as
well as from 3 children between 4 and 5 y of age, with 77 children
having measures at both 4 or 4.5 and 5 y of age for 121 individual
children. Two children had 3 telomere measurements between 4
and 5 y of age. The flowchart for enrollment is shown in Figure 1.

 We previously published the within-individual changes in TL in
children from 4 to 5 y of age (26).
TL is expressed as the T:S (i.e., the ratio of a telomeric product
to a single-copy gene product). DNA was extracted with the use
of the QIAamp DNA Investigator Kit (catalog number 56504;
QIAGEN). The TL-measurement assay was adapted from the
published original method by Cawthon (27). A detailed de-
scription of the method has been presented by Lin et al. (28).
The average CV for this study was 4.8% (26).
To convert T:S ratios to base pairs, the described method
was used to determine the T:S ratios of a set of genomic
DNA samples from the human fibroblast primary cell line
IMR-90 at a different population doubling as well as with
the telomerase protein subunit gene human telomerease re-
verse transcriptase (hTERT) infected on a lentiviral con-
struct. This set of DNA samples represents different T:S
ratios from the same parental cell line. The mean length of
a telomeric restriction fragment from these DNA samples
was determined with the use of a Southern blot analysis and
was compared with the T:S ratios for these samples to
convert T:S ratios to base pairs according to this formula:
base pairs = 3274 + 2413 3 (T:S). All telomere measure-
ments are expressed as bp.
Statistical analysis
Preliminary exploratory analyses were based on graphical
comparisons of distributions of TLs between groups that were
defined by key categorical predictor variables with the use of
density, box plots, and scatter plots to examine marginal relations
between TL and continuous predictors.
We used linear regression models to investigate the associa-
tion of TL with childhood exposures including child obesity
and abdominal obesity at different time points in childhood,
breastfeeding duration and exclusivity, the timing of the in-
troduction of solids and dietary intake, and sociodemographic
factors such as child sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
Because repeated observations of TLs (at both 4 and 5 y of age)
were available for a subset of infants, inferences were based on
robust SEs to account for the within-individual correlation in
outcome measures.
Initial regression analyses focused on assessing marginal as-
sociations between selected variables and TL. Variables with
associations that were significant at P # 0.01 and those that were
identified as being plausibly related on the basis of previous re-
search findings or for biological reasons were considered in
multiple-predictor regression models. Examples of the latter in-
cluded the reported consumption of soda $4 times/wk at age 4 y,
breastfeeding, and obesity at 6 mo of age. Because of the role of
possible confounding by child age at collection in relation to TL
and breastfeeding and other feeding practices, we included child
age in all models (29). We also evaluated the evidence for in-
teractions between demographic, weight, and dietary variables
and child age in multiple linear regression predictor models.
Last, we evaluated dietary intake in relation to the TL change
from 4 to 5 y of age in children who had repeat measurements
(n = 77) with the use of Student’s t tests for dichotomous pre-
dictors. In addition, we evaluated dietary variables with the use
of multiple linear regression predictor models that were adjusted
for child baseline TL and sex.
Diagnostic checks of results revealed some evidence for de-
partures from normality of TL measurements, and thus, we
conducted parallel analyses with the use of bootstrapped SEs as
a sensitivity analysis to assess possible impacts of key findings.
We used a lower threshold of inclusion in multivariable models
(P # 0.01) because of the large number of predictors that were
tested for significance. Exclusive breastfeeding and the con-
sumption of other non–breast-milk foods and drinks were not
included together in models because of collinearity. We ran
a separate multivariable model that compared results without
paternal age at the child’s birth because w18% of observations
were missing compared with the results that included paternal
age. Other predictor variables in the model had ,5% of ob-
servations missing. We conducted additional regression analyses
to investigate the role of early obesity and soda consumption as
possible mediators of the effects of exclusive breastfeeding and
TL at 4 and 5 y of age. These analyses were based on methods
for a causal mediation analysis (30) and are summarized as the
estimated percentage of the effect of breastfeeding as explained
by the mediating variables. Analyses were conducted with the
use of Stata software (version 13; StataCorp LP).
RESULTS
Mean 6 SE TL in all children was 7622.0 6 80.3 bp at age
4 y and 8025.4 6 80.5 bp at age 5 y (Table 1). Mean TL in girls
was somewhat higher than in boys (7913.8 6 93.0 compared
with 7669.8 6 92.1 bp, respectively; P = 0.07) (Table 1).
Children of fathers who were older ($35 y of age) also had
longer mean TLs than children of younger fathers (8129.8 6
173.8 compared with 7683.7 6 74.3 bp, respectively; P = 0.02).
Paternal age analyzed continuously was also positively associ-
ated with child TL (P , 0.01). We did not find any differences
in mean TL on the basis of ethnicity (Mexican compared with
Central American), maternal prenatal BMI category, or maternal
age represented as either a continuous or categorical variable
(Table 1). We did not evaluate the relation between maternal
smoking in the perinatal period or during the first year of life
because of the low number of mothers who reported any
smoking (n = 2 during the perinatal period, and n = 4 at 6 mo of
age).
Child-weight variables
Children who were underweight at 6 mo, 3 y, and 4 y of age had
lower mean TL than children did who were not underweight
[7388.2 6 223.2 compared with 7830.6 6 70.8 bp (P = 0.06);
7466.7 6 19.8 compared with 7811.9 6 67.6 bp (P , 0.01); and
7805.3 6 67.6 compared with 8154.1 6 47.1 bp (P , 0.01);
respectively] although the number of children underweight at
each time point was small (n = 4, n = 2, and n = 2, respectively)
(results not shown). Obesity at birth was associated with shorter
TL, as was obesity at 6 mo of age compared with children who
were not obese [7523.0 6 130.8 compared with 7829.8 6 71.8 bp
(P = 0.04) at birth and 7507.5 6 169.4 compared with 7878.6 6
75.1 bp (P = 0.048) at 6 mo of age] (Table 2), although obesity
at later time points were not associated with shorter TLs. When
we modeled the possible interaction between obesity and child
age in relation to TL, we did show an interaction with age
(P , 0.05; interaction coefficient: 241.88; 95% CI: 282.58, 1.19;

 results not shown), which suggested that early obesity is associated
with shorter child TL, whereas later obesity is not. Abdominal
obesity and obesity at other time points were not associated with
shorter TL (Table 2). Chronic obesity from 6 mo to 5 y of age was
associated with shorter TLs at 4 and 5 y of age (7099.2 6 302.8
compared with 7830.5 6 67.2 bp; P = 0.02), whereas obesity
from 2 to 5 y of age was not associated with shorter TL nor
was obesity at the later time points (4 and 5 y of age) (results
not shown). The number of chronically obese children be-
tween 6 mo and 5 y of age was small [6 of 200 chronic obesity
measurements (3.0%); or 3 of 121 individual children studied
(2.4%)].
Breastfeeding
Exclusive breastfeeding at 4–6 wk of age was associated with
longer TLs at 4 and 5 y of age compared with nonexclusive
breastfeeding (7996.3 6 113.4 compared with 7678.0 6 76.3 bp
respectively; P = 0.02) (Table 3), as was not feeding children
other foods or drinks compared with early food and non–breast
milk or replacement milk consumption at 4–6 wk of age by w350
bp (7897.9 6 82.2 compared with 7538.4 6 91.3 bp respectively;
P , 0.01). Any breastfeeding at 4–6 wk of age tended to be
associated with longer telomeres at 4 and 5 y of age (P = 0.07)
(Table 3). At 6 mo of age, any breastfeeding compared with no
breastfeeding was also associated with longer telomeres in the
preschool years (7898.9 6 89.5 compared with 7635.4 6 96.4 bp;
P = 0.048). TLs did not differ at 4 and 5 y of age in relation to
breastfeeding at 12 mo of age (Table 3; P = 0.95).
Dietary intake
TLs did not differ on the basis of the timing of the introduction
of solid foods, intake of fruit juice, or early consumption of soda
at 6 or 12 mo of age (results not shown). Consumption patterns of
beverages at 2, 3, and 4 y of age were not associated with shorter
TLs at 4 and 5 y of age with the exception that daily high fruit
juice consumption at 3 y of age was associated with shorter TLs at
4 and 5 y of age than were lower daily fruit consumption
(7667.2 6 81.6 compared with 7931.4 6 102.6 bp respectively;
P = 0.047) and soda consumption at 4 y of age [$4 compared
with ,4 times/wk (7442.7 6 149.0 compared with 7852.1 6
71.3 bp; P = 0.015)] (Table 4). Soda consumption at 5 y of age
($4 times/wk) and soda consumption at 2 y of age (.1 time/wk)
trended towards significance with shorter TLs at 4 and 5 y of age
compared with less soda consumption (P = 0.06 and P = 0.07,
respectively) (Table 4). Daily fruit-juice intake from 3 y of age
similarly trended toward increased risk of shorter TLs at 4 and 5 y
of age compared with lower fruit juice intake (7543.8 6 144.8
compared with 7844.6 6 72.3 bp, respectively; P = 0.07; data not
shown). Water consumption was not associated with shorter or
longer TLs in children at any time point, although almost all
children drank water daily in all years (results not shown).
The marginal distribution of TLs in relation to exclusive-
breastfeeding status at 4–6 wk of age and the consumption of non–
breast milk and other milk liquids and solids are plotted in Figures
2 and 3, respectively. These kernel-density plots indicate the
marginal distribution of TLs defined by exclusive-breastfeeding

 status and the consumption of non–breast milk and other milk
liquids and solids at 4–6 wk of age.
Dietary intake and telomere attrition from 4 to 5 y of age
We did not show any differences between changes in TL from 4
to 5 y of age (n = 77) on the basis of early life feeding practices
including breastfeeding at 4–6 wk of age (P = 0.65), the con-
sumption of other non–breast milk or replacement milk foods and
drinks at 4–6 wk (P = 0.81), exclusive breastfeeding at 4–6 wk of
age (P = 0.31), any breastfeeding at 6 mo of age (P = 0.89), or
exclusive breastfeeding at 6 mo of age (P = 0.64) (results not
shown). Beverage intake, including 100% fruit juices and soda,
was also not associated with the rate of telomere attrition from 4
to 5 y of age with the exception of high soda consumption at 3 y
of age, which trended toward significance (P = 0.08). Compared
with children who drank soda ,4 times/wk at 3 y of age, children
who drank soda $4 times/wk were more likely to have an ac-
celerated loss from 4 to 5 y of age (adjusted coefficient: 2515.14;
95% CI: 2986.06, 241.22; P = 0.03) (results not shown).
Multivariable regression and mediation
In a multivariable regression model, we entered the child’s age
at collection in years, the father’s age at the child’s birth in years,
child sex, maternal TL, and exclusive breastfeeding at 4–6 wk of
age. Because of the collinearity between exclusive breastfeeding
and the consumption of other foods and drinks, we ran separate
models (one model with exclusive breastfeeding and one model
with the consumption of other foods and drinks).
Independent predictors for longer TLs at 4 and 5 y of age in-
cluded older paternal age (adjusted coefficient: 33.27; 95% CI:
4.10, 62.44; P = 0.03), having a mother with longer TLs (ad-
justed coefficient: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.54; P , 0.01), and
exclusive breastfeeding at 4–6 wk of age (adjusted coefficient:
353.85; 95% CI: 72.81, 634.89; P = 0.01) (Table 5). These
findings suggest that children who were exclusively breastfed
at 4–6 wk of age had longer telomeres by 353.85 bp than did
children who were not exclusively breastfed. In addition, for each
additional maternal base pair in TL, there was a 0.32 increase in
child TL, and each additional year of the father’s age corresponded to
an additional 33.27 bp in child TL. We ran a similar multivariable
regression model to the one displayed in Table 5, whereby we re-
placed exclusive breastfeeding at 4–6 wk of age with the consumption
of other nonmilk drinks and foods at 4–6 wk of age. The consumption
of other foods and drinks at 4–6 wk of age was similarly associated
with reduced TL after controlling for other predictors (adjusted co-
efficient: 2457.01; 95% CI: 2720.50, 2193.51; P , 0.01). We did
not show any differences in coefficients or P values with the use of
bootstrapped SEs compared with robust SEs in the multivariable
analysis.
When we removed paternal age from the multivariable model
and had a greater number of observations (n = 192), our in-
dependent predictors (exclusive breastfeeding at 4–6 wk of age,
other food and liquid consumption at 4–6 wk of age, and adult
TL) were similar although the effect size was slightly attenuated.
Mediation analyses revealed that an estimated 15% of the effect
of early exclusive breastfeeding on TL at 4–6 wk of age was

 consumption at 4 y of age ($4 times/wk) accounted for 13% of
the effect. Although the accuracy of these estimates depended on
controlling for other important confounders, the results suggest
a possible role of these variables as mediating influences.
Women who breastfeed are less likely to have children who are
obese at 6 mo of age and possibly less likely to have children
who consume excessive amounts of soda in preschool. We did not
find any role for obesity at 6 mo of age or for soda consumption at
4 y of age in mediating the relation between other food and drink
consumption at 4–6 wk of age and TL.
We also evaluated the relation between breastfeeding at 4–6
wk of age and maternal depressive symptoms during the post-
partum and preschool time periods as well as child behavioral
issues during preschool on the basis of our previous findings
(24). Although mothers with depressive symptoms and clinical
depression were less likely to breastfeed in the postpartum pe-
riod, there was no mediation or confounding by maternal de-
pression in the relation between breastfeeding at 4–6 wk of age
and TL at 4 and 5 y of age.
DISCUSSION
In this cohort study, we examined prospective detailed mea-
surements of feeding behaviors over time in relation to TL at 4
and 5 y of age to detect whether effects exist in the preschool
years and, if so, if there appear to be critical periods. To our
knowledge, ours is the first study to find an association in
preschool children (4 and 5 y of age) between longer TL and
early dietary patterns including exclusive breastfeeding at 4–6 wk
of age. We also showed a deleterious impact of introducing
other foods and nonmilk liquids to infants at 4–6 wk of age on
TL when the children were 4 and 5 y old. Children who were
exclusively breastfed and mothers who did not introduce other
liquids or solids at 4–6 wk of age had TLs at 4 and 5 y of age
that were w 350 and 450 bp longer, respectively, than those of
children who were mixed fed, were fed replacement milk, and
had solids or nonmilk liquids introduced early. A unique as-
pect of our cohort is that it was relatively homogenous in
terms of possible confounders associated with breastfeeding
including socioeconomic status and cultural background.
The cohort was almost exclusively of low socioeconomic
status, Spanish speaking, and from Southern Mexico and
Central America.
These findings, although dramatic, were not surprising because
of the strong body of science on the biochemical effects of
breastfeeding and anti-inflammatory and immune-system pro-
tective effects (31–33), which extend past the weaning period
(34).
Exposures to oxidative stress and inflammation are associated
with accelerated telomere shortening in adults (4, 35), and the
protective effect of breastfeeding against inflammation may ex-
plain the association between exclusive breastfeeding at 4–6 wk of
age and longer TL in the preschool years.
We showed that the early introduction of nonmilk liquids and
solids is associated with shorter TL at 4 and 5 y of age. Early
exposure to certain foods may trigger an abnormal immune re-
sponse to food antigens because the infant gut may be too im-
mature before 4–6 mo of age (36–38). The heightened immune

 response that is associated with early exposures to solid foods
may also result in accelerated telomere aging because TL is
connected with processes of premature immunosenescence (39).
In the current article, we report that early life obesity (from
6 mo of age) may also affect childhood TL possibly through the
mediation of the relation between breastfeeding and shorter TL
because breastfed babies are less likely to be obese. We also
showed an independent association between shorter TL and early
obesity (at 6 mo of age) in the adjusted models with the removal of
paternal age to have a larger sample size. Chronic obesity (from
6 mo to 5 y of age) was also associated with shortened telomeres at
4 and 5 y of age in bivariate analyses. Children who are exposed to
a more chronic form of obesity rather than episodic obesity are
simultaneously exposed to inflammatory processes for more
sustained periods and at more severe levels, and the biochemical
environment of higher inflammation and insulin is known to be
detrimental to telomeres. However, our numbers of children who
had exposure to chronic obesity were small, and thus, these results
were not tested for independence in a multivariable analysis, and
future studies with larger sample sizes are necessary.
The relation between longer preschool TL and early exclusive
breastfeeding may also be explained by the association between
early exclusive breastfeeding and later dietary habits (40). We
showed that high soda consumption at 4 y of age mediated the
relation between exclusive breastfeeding and TL, whereas soda
consumption has also been independently associated with shorter
TL in adults (15).

 When we evaluated risk factors for accelerated TL attrition in
our cohort, we showed that high intakes of soda were associated
with accelerated attrition in children even after controlling for
baseline TL, thereby confirming similar findings in adults (15).
The mechanisms for accelerated attrition are not clear although
we did not show any associations between early life obesity and
TL attrition in this cohort (26). It is possible that high soda
consumption may increase oxidative stress, inflammation, and
subsequently risk of insulin resistance, all of which are processes
that also damage TL independent of obesity levels. Meanwhile,
larger, more detailed dietary studies are needed to confirm our
findings.
Last, our results in Latino children confirmed the results of
previous studies on the heritability of TL (41) because we
showed a strong correlation between maternal TL and that of
children although we could not rule out the commonality of
environmental factors. We also showed that paternal age was
positively associated with TL as have other studies (42). It
has been speculated that TL in sperm may be longer in older
men because of a higher amount of exposure to telomerase
activity (43).
Limitations of our study include the smaller sample size and
the fact that the study was conducted in Latino children only.
Therefore, these results need to be replicated in other populations.
Also, we had only 2 measures of TL, both of which occurred
during preschool years, and a better study design would have had
more successive measures of TL, specifically at birth and at 1 y of
age, to see the immediate effects of breastfeeding on TL attrition in
the first year of life as well as the role of breastfeeding on the TL
attrition rate from birth through the preschool years. Future studies
should include larger sample sizes, multiethnic populations, and
early measurements in childhood. However, as previously dis-
cussed, although our sample size was small, and we restricted the
cohort to one ethnic group, we were able to minimize the number
of possible known and unknown confounders associated with
dietary intake by having a relatively homogenous group.
In addition, although our population was, in general, a rela-
tively healthy group of Latino children, it is not clear if the
benefits of breastfeeding would be sustained in a subpopulation
of children with chronic disease (e.g., asthma or diabetes mel-
litus) or a sustained exposure to environmental insults. Although
we did not see any diminished effect of breastfeeding in regards
to the exposure to maternal depressive symptoms or clinical
depression, we did not evaluate more severe exposures such as an
exposure to trauma or child abuse. Additional studies should
evaluate the long-term benefits of breastfeeding in different
subpopulations of children.
In conclusion, this study suggests that early breastfeeding in
the first month of life, without introducing other foods, may
play a critical role in promoting healthy telomere biology, and
this effect can be seen 4–5 y later. Other cofactors that could
also affect inflammation and reactive oxygen species damage
such as maternal smoking were not significant factors in our
cohort, and other exposures such as maternal clinical de-
pression or depressive symptoms did not mediate or confound
the relation between early breastfeeding and later childhood
TL. However, in other populations that have a more extensive
exposure to smoking or in which children have other trauma or
stress exposures, there may be fewer sustained benefits from
breastfeeding; these variables need to be systematically assessed
in follow-up studies with repeated TL measurements. In addi-
tion, we did not evaluate genetic factors, which could have af-
fected TL and attrition patterns that might have accounted for
the differences in our population of children. Also, early obesity,
by 6 mo of life, also appears to have an imprint on childhood
TL. Together, these novel findings point to the critical role of
the early intervention and education of women of childbearing
age about nutrition and breastfeeding and infant obesity. It is
possible that an understanding of how the pregnancy health
of women and feeding practices can affect the telomeres of
their babies may offer a new insight and motivation for im-
proved health in the critical perinatal and early years of their
children’s lives.
