Abstract
Purpose—The ability of human melanotransferrin (hMTf) to carry a therapeutic concentration of 
trastuzumab (BTA) in the brain after conjugation (in the form of trastuzumab-melanotransferrin 
conjugate, BT2111 conjugate) was investigated by measuring the reduction of the number and size 
of metastatic human HER2+ breast cancer tumors in a preclinical model of brain metastases of 
breast cancer.
Methods—Human metastatic brain seeking breast cancer cells were injected in NuNu mice 
(n=6–12 per group) which then developed experimental brain metastases. Drug uptake was 
analyzed in relation to metastasis size and blood-tumor barrier permeability. To investigate in-vivo 
activity against brain metastases, equimolar doses of the conjugate, and relevant controls (hMTF 
and BTA) in separate groups were administered biweekly after intracardiac injection of the 
metastatic cancer cells.
Results—The trastuzumab-melanotransferrin conjugate (BT2111) reduced the number of 
preclinical human HER2+ breast cancer metastases in the brain by 68% compared to control 
groups. Tumors which remained after treatment were 46% smaller than the control groups. In 
contrast, BTA alone had no effect on reducing number of metastases, and was associated with only 
a minimal reduction in metastasis size.
Conclusions—The results suggest the novel trastuzumab-melanotransferrin conjugate (BT2111) 
may have utility in treating brain metastasis and validate hMTf as a potential vector for antibody 
transport across the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB).

4. Introduction
Brain metastasis of breast cancer is of concern due to increasing mortality rates and poor 
quality of life after diagnosis. The incidence of brain metastasis in breast cancer patients 
range from 10–16% in patients with disseminated breast cancer (1). For women with 
symptomatic CNS metastases, the median survival is approximately 4 months (2), with less 
than 2% of women surviving two years post diagnosis (3). Head computed tomography (CT) 
scan and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (4) suggest that that an additional 15% of 
asymptomatic metastatic breast cancer patients may have occult brain metastases and 
further, it is suggested that approximately 30% of disseminated breast cancer patients have 
lesions discovered upon autopsy (5, 6).
Hormone receptor status is a correlated risk factor in developing brain metastases of breast 
cancer (7). Breast cancer is subcategorized based on the receptor status to endocrine receptor 
(ER, estrogen or progesterone receptor), HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), 
or triple negative (negative for estrogen, progesterone, or HER2 receptors) (7). Both triple 
negative and Her2 positive primary tumors have been reported to be correlated with the 
development of (8–10). Importantly, HER2-positive breast cancers tend to grow and 
metastasize faster compared to HER2-negative breast cancers (11, 12).
Trastuzumab, BTA, (Herceptin, Genentech/ Roche), a humanized monoclonal antibody, is 
widely used to target HER2+ breast cancer since it binds to the extracellular juxtamembrane 
domain of HER2 and inhibits proliferation and survival of HER2-dependent tumors (13). 
Trastuzumab is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with 
HER2 positive breast cancers (14). The first clinical study of trastuzumab (15) showed 
therapy decreased mortality at 1 year (22% vs. 33%, P=0.008) and produced a longer 
median survival (25.1 vs. 20.3 months, P=0.046) with a 20% reduction of death risk. 
Unfortunately, when breast cancer progresses to brain, Trastuzumab has limited efficacy 
because it poorly crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-tumor barrier (BTB) (16).
An approach to translocate pharmaceuticals across the BBB is to design drugs or carriers to 
use BBB transporters to allow penetration into the CNS. One such mechanism that can be 
used to facilitate uptake of active pharmaceutical ingredients across the BBB is 
melanotransferrin (hMTf) or melanoma tumor antigen (p97). Melanotransferrin (hMTf) has 
been identified as a potential vector to transport drugs across the BBB for the treatment of 
brain diseases. Human melanotransferrin (hMTf) is a glycosylated, bi-lobed protein 
belonging to the transferrin family of iron binding proteins, which include transferrin, 
lactoferrin, and ova transferrin among others (17). They are characterized by conserved 
sequences of amino acids organized into an N lobe and a C lobe with each lobe having the 
capacity to bind one molecule of iron. The exception is melanotransferrin, which can bind

 only one molecule of iron due to an amino acid substitution in the iron-binding site of lobe C 
(17). hMTf is a chemical and structural homolog of transferrin (Tf) (18). Contrary to Tf, 
hMTf does not bind to the transferrin receptor but involves directly or indirectly a receptor 
of the family of Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor related Protein (LRP) such as LRP-1 
(19, 20). These data have been demonstrated in an in-vitro BBB transcytosis assay as Tf 
never competed with hMTf for transcytosis suggesting two separate receptors (20).
Previous studies have shown that hMTf can cross the BBB to deliver iron (21) and can also 
shuttle doxorubicin to brain tumors (22). hMTf has been demonstrated to cross very 
efficiently the BBB as measured by in-vitro BBB model using bovine brain capillary 
endothelial cells (BBCEC) and using the in-situ brain perfusion methods (23). Finally, hMTf 
has been demonstrated to direct adenovirus (Ad5) across the BBB by transcytosis across an 
in-vitro model of the BBB (24).
In the current work, we investigated brain and brain metastases uptake of a 
melanotransferrin (hMTf, P97)-trastuzumab (BTA) conjugate (BT2111), and determined if 
the conjugate had efficacy in reducing the number and size of metastatic lesions in a 
preclinical model of brain metastases of breast cancer. BT2111 is a conjugate comprised of a 
melanotransferrin, a unique blood-brain barrier transporter, and herceptin (Trastuzumab, 
BTA). BT2111 is a novel recombinant conjugated protein developed by Bioasis 
Technologies Inc.(25), and currently in the non-clinical development as an intravenous 
product for the treatment of brain metastasis of breast cancer.
5. Materials and methods
5.1. Chemicals
Texas Red (Sulforhodamine 101) was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Cold 
conjugate (Trastuzumab-hMTf Conjugate; p97-BTA conjugate; BT2111), trastuzumab 
(Herceptin; BTA, MW ~ 145,532 Da) and human melanotransferrin (p97; hMTf, MW ~ 
80,000 Da) were supplied by BiOasis, Inc. as stock solutions of 5, 5 and 10 mg/mL 
respectively (Purity of >99% (26)). The estimated molecular weight (MW) of BT2111 was ~ 
270,000 Da based on conjugation ratios. BT2111 was formulated in 50 mM potassium 
phosphate buffer and 150 mM sodium chloride adjusted at pH of 6.7. Trastuzumab (Roche) 
was buffer-exchanged into 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer and 150 mM sodium chloride 
adjusted at pH of 6.7. Test articles (BT2111 conjugate, BTA and hMTf) were radiolabeled 
with 125I. 125l-labeled p97, trastuzumab, and p97- trastuzumab proteins purity is >99%, as 
measured by HPLC(26). Several batches of radioactive test articles were prepared and the 
specific radioactivity of test articles used in this study differed from one batch to another. 
The specific radioactivity of the predominant batch used in this study for BT2111 conjugate, 
BTA and p97 was 0.2899, 0.5686 and 0.31 µCi/µg respectively. The purity of the radioactive 
materials was not confirmed by HPLC analysis. Information on synthesis methods, stability, 
purity, composition, or other characteristics that define the test article(s) components is on 
file with BiOasis, Inc. All other chemicals are of analytical grade and were purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

 5.2. Animals
Homozygous Female NuNu(27) (Crl:NU-Foxn1nu, Strain code 088) mice (25–30 g) were 
obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Kingston, NY) and used for all experiments in 
this study. This outbred, isolator maintained, hairless, albino mouse lacks a thymus and is 
unable to produce T cells. The Nu Nu mouse strain was selected because these animals are 
immunodeficient and will not mount an immune response against injected human cells. This 
immunodeficient strain is utilized as an animal model of choice in oncology research (27). 
All studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Texas Tech University 
Health Sciences Center, and conducted in accordance with the 1996 NIH Guide for the Care 
and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animals were acclimated to laboratory conditions before 
study initiation at least for a week.
5.3. Cell Culture
Human metastatic triple-negative breast cancer over-expressing Her2 cells (MDA-MB-231-
BRHER2/eGFP) were cultured in DMEM (10-17-CV, Cellgro Inc.) supplemented with 10% 
FBS and Zeocin (300 µg per 500 mL media, Invitrogen). MDA-MB-231-BRHER2/eGFP cells 
were selected because they over-express HER2 receptors and as such are sensitive to 
herceptin treatment. All cells were used in passages 1–10 and maintained at 37°C with 5% 
CO2. Transfection was conducted using retroviral vector pLEGFP-CD from BD 
Biosciences. EGFP expression (95% to 99%) was confirmed by fluorescent microscopy after 
being selected in the presence of 0.8 mg/mL G418. Cells are passaged in DMEM, 10% FBS 
with 2 mL L-Glutamine. The cells were subsequently transfected with pCMV4.ErbB2 full-
length human cDNA and pSVzeo to create the MDA-MB-231-BRHER2/eGFP line. The 
sequence of the Her-2 insert in pCMV4.ErbB2 was confirmed by sequencing. Stable 
colonies were selected in the presence of 0.75mg/mL zeocin (Invitrogen). For preparation of 
MDA-MB-231-BRHER2/eGFP cells for intracardiac injection, cells were grown to 70% 
confluency, trypsinized, and rinsed twice in 4°C PBS to remove all traces of serum. Cells 
were resuspended in serum free 4°C DMEM media and placed on ice.
5.4. Development of Metastases and Administration of Drugs
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated with the breast cancer cell line 
(MDA-MB-231-BR-Her2: 1.75 × 105/100 µL DMEM/mouse) in the left cardiac ventricle. 
MDA-MB-231-BRHER2/eGFP cells are brain seeking metastatic cells that upon injection into 
the left cardiac ventricle, circulate in the peripheral vasculature, arrest in brain capillaries, 
extravasate across the blood brain barrier (BBB), and develop metastatic lesions 
predominantly in brain (28).
5.4.1. Test articles uptake into brain and brain metastases of breast cancer 
after intravenous administration in mice: preclinical pharmacokinetics and 
comparison with systemic tissues—To examine the BT2111 conjugate uptake into 
brain and brain metastases of breast cancer, animals were administered radiolabeled BT2111 
conjugate (17 mg/kg), trastuzumab, BTA (10 mg/kg) and melanotransferrin, hMTf (7 
mg/kg) intravenously and sacrificed at three time points for each group (30 min, 2 and 8 
hours). IV administration was used to ensure 100% test article delivery into circulation. A

 dose level of BTA (10 mg/kg), route of administration and dosing schedule were selected 
based on literature data for this drug(29). hMTf and BT2111 conjugate were injected at 
corresponding molar equivalent doses. At least 3 animals per time point were used in this 
study except for hMTf/0.5 hour group (4 mice), BT2111/8 hour (4 mice) and BT2111/2 
hours (6 mice). Injections of 125I-labeled Test Articles (14 µCi/mouse) were performed week 
5–6 after cell injections when animals start exhibiting neurological symptoms. The levels of 
radioactivity in the brain and brain metastasis were determined using radiotracer imaging of 
brain sections. Before euthanasia, the animals were injected with Texas Red-Dextran. The 
uptake of BT2111 versus hMTf and BTA was analyzed in relation to metastasis size, blood-
tumor barrier permeability, and time of circulation. In addition to the brains, blood was 
collected immediately after the animals were euthanized (before the removal of the brain). 
The radioactivity of whole blood was measured and expressed as cpm/mL and then 
converted to nCi/mL and nCi/g.
In addition to blood, samples were collected from other tissues and organs for comparative 
analysis (brain stem, heart, lung, liver, spleen, one kidney, muscle, fat, and intestine). Parts 
of organs or tissues were collected, washed and weighted. Weights were recorded for each 
organ or tissue collected. Radioactivity was measured immediately after collection and 
expressed as cpm/mg and then converted to nCi/g. The tissue/blood concentration ratios 
were determined based on ratio of radioactivity in tissue to blood normalized by weight.
5.4.2. Test articles effect on the number and size of brain metastases of breast 
cancer after intraperitoneal administration in mice—Furthermore, we compared the 
BT2111 conjugate and hMTf versus BTA activity in-vivo against brain metastases of breast 
cancer. Following cell administration, the animals were randomized into treatment groups. 
8–9 mice/group were used in the vehicle control and BT2111 groups; 13 mice/group in the 
hMTf and BTA groups. The test facility assigned the increased number of animals to the 
hMTf and BTA groups because of anticipated higher mortality rates as compared to the 
BT2111 group. In this study, animals were administered BT2111 conjugate (17 mg/kg), 
BTA (10 mg/kg) and hMTf (7 mg/kg) intravenously biweekly. Treatment was initiated on 
day 21 after the initial intracardiac injections of MDA-MB-231-BRHER2/eGFP. All animals 
within each group were sacrificed on day 35 after the intracardiac injection of MDA-
MB-231-BRHER2/eGFP cells. The different drugs and controls efficacy was assessed by 
counting the number and size of metastases in brain at the termination of the experiment. All 
experiments were conducted in accordance with approved animal use protocols. Animal 
observations were performed and body weights were measured periodically.
5.5. Harvesting of The Brain
Animals were euthanized, and brain tissue was removed, and placed in isopentane (-65°C). 
Brain was removed rapidly (less than 60 seconds) since slower removal may cause changes 
in the spatial distribution of small molecular weight tracers (30, 31). Brains were sliced (20 
µm) using a cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Wetzler, Germany) and sections were mounted 
on glass slides, air dried, and stored at −80 °C.

 5.6. Quantitative autoradiography (QAR)
Autoradiograms were generated by co-exposing the sections on Fuji film (FLA 7000, 
Stamford, CT) with tissue-calibrated 1H-standards for 2–3 weeks. Quantitative analysis of 
the regional radioactivity was performed using a micro-computer image device (MCID) 
(Linton, Cambridge, England). Test article concentrations in tumor and normal brain areas 
were expressed in nCi/g based on the calibration curve per mm2.
5.7. Immunofluorescence
Slides adjacent to the slides used for QAR analysis were used for immunofluorescent 
staining. All chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich 
(St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise indicated. Tissues were rehydrated briefly in phosphate 
buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde (4°C) for 30 minutes. After 
three washings with PBS, the slides were then covered in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate for 5 
minutes and rinsed again with PBS. Primary antibodies [Anti-Cytokeratin mouse 
monoclonal IgG antibody (MNF 116, Abcam) that reacts with human tissue and Anti-LRP1 
(low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) rabbit monoclonal IgG antibody (AB 
92544, Abcam) that reacts with human tissue] were diluted 1:500 in 5% goat serum and 
were incubated with slides overnight at 4°C following by washing.
Sections were covered in 0.03% hydrogen peroxide + 0.1% sodium azide for 10 minutes and 
subsequently washed. After a second blocking with 10% goat serum for 30 minutes, slides 
were incubated with secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted in 5% goat serum at 
1:1000 [Alexa Fluor® 488 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (labeled with bright, photostable, green-
fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 dye) and Alexa Fluor® 594 Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG1 (labeled 
with bright, photostable, red-fluorescent Alexa Fluor 594 dye, spectrally similar to Texas 
Red® dye) and is prepared from affinity-purified antibodies that react with the Fc portion of 
the heavy chain of mouse IgG1]. DAPI (Invitrogen, 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 
dilactate,) was added to this solution at 1 mg/mL 1:500 and slides were incubated for 1 hour 
at room temperature. Slides were again washed, mountant (DAKO) was added, and 
coverslips were applied. Fluorescence analyses on whole brain sections were performed 
using an Olympus MVX10 microscope with a 2× objective (NA=0.5) and an optical zoom of 
(0.63–6.3)×. Excitation and emission filters were 470±40 and 525±50 nm for eGFP, 560±55 
and 645±75 nm for Texas Red dextran and 740±35nm and 780 longpass filter for near-
infrared indocyanine green. Fluorescent image analysis was performed using Slidebook 5.0 
program (Olympus).
On selected slides processed for immunochistochemistry staining, excitation and emission 
filters were 470±40 and 525±50 nm for green (Alexa Fluor AF488), 560±55 and 645±75 nm 
for red (Alexa Fluor 594), and 320±50 and 430±60 nm for DAPI blue. Immunohisto-
fluorescent images were taken with an Olympus IX81 microscope (Center Valley, PA).
5.8. Unidirectional uptake transfer constants (Kin)
Kin values were then calculated from brain distribution volume versus time as indicated in 
the literature (28).

 5.9. Survival study
Animals were injected with MDA-MD-231Br-Luc into the left cardiac ventricle and imaged 
using Bioluminescent imaging (BLI, IVIS Lumineer XV (PerkinElmer)) to confirm a 
successful injection. All animals included in the study displayed BLI signal in brain 
indicating a successful intracardiac injection. Metastases were allowed to develop for 21 
days. On the 21st day, treatment of vehicle, BT2111 conjugate (17 mg/kg), BTA (10 mg/kg) 
and hMTf (7 mg/kg) was started via intraperitoneal (IP) injection as usually administered in 
trastuzumab treatment and repeated biweekly. Animals were also imaged for BLI once 
weekly. Animals were sacrificed when neurological symptoms became noticeable (as 
previously mentioned). Animals were sacrificed under anesthesia (ketamine/xylazine; 
100mg/kg and 8mg/kg respectively).
5.10. Bioluminescent imaging
Mice were injected with D-luciferin potassium salt (150mg/kg; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) 
dissolved in sterile 1× PBS via intraperitoneal injection and then anesthetized under 2% 
isoflurane. To determine the appropriate time to image after injection, five control mice were 
imaged sequentially every five minutes for 100 minutes immediately after IP injection of D-
luciferin potassium salt (150mg/kg) and BLI signal in brain was measured over time to 
identify the peak signal and time course. It was determined that 15 minutes after IP injection 
of D-luciferin the BLI provided a consistent peak intensity which reflects the substrates 
kinetic profile. Fifteen minutes after IP injection of D-luciferin, darkfield images of mice 
were acquired with an IVIS Lumineer XV (PerkinElmer) to detect bioluminescence. 
Animals were imaged 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hours post intracardiac 
injection. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn according to the circumference of the 
cranium and all data were reported as radiance (photons/sec/cm2/seradian).
5.11. Data analysis
Statistical significance by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple 
comparison’s test. All differences were considered statistically significant at p< 0.05. Data is 
reported as Mean ± Standard Error of Mean (SEM) (GraphPad Prism 5.0, San Diego, CA). 
Results associated with drug levels determined in tumor and brain distant to tumor (BDT) 
areas represent Mean values of combined readings from all tumor and BDT areas in the 
study group without separation by individual animal data. In case of Kin analysis, values 
obtained at different time points were also pooled together.
6. Results
Brain metastasis and primary tumors have been associated with the presence of different 
receptor target sites drug delivery (32). One receptor site is the low density lipoprotein 
receptor-related protein (LRP-1), which has a rapid rate of endocytosis (t½< 30 s)(32). 
LRP-1 is highly expressed at the BBB and is upregulated in brain tumors (33). LRP-1 has 
been involved with transcytosis of several proteins and peptides such as tissue plasminogen 
activator (tPA), receptor associated peptide (RAP), and melanotransferrin (hMTf) across the 
BBB (20, 32). Fluorescence images showing LRP Expression in MDA-MB-231-
BRHER2/eGFP brain metastases are shown in Fig 1. DAPI (Blue), anti-cytokeratin mouse

 monoclonal IgG antibody (green) and anti-LRP-1 rabbit monoclonal IgG antibody (red, AB 
92544, Abcam) were used to localize cell nucleus, to stain epithelial cells and illustrate LRP 
1 expression respectively. The LRP-1 fluorescence (red) was predominantly co-localized 
with cytokeratin staining of epithelial cells (green fluorescence).
Test drugs (hMTf, BTA or BT2111) uptake into brain and brain metastases of breast cancer 
after intravenous administration in mice was investigated. MDA-MB-231-BRHER2/eGFP cells 
were cultured, harvested and injected into the left cardiac ventricle of NU/NU mice. 
Animals start exhibiting neurological symptoms, 5 to 6 weeks after cell injections on 
average. As soon as neurological symptoms start, animals were injected with 125I-labeled 
hMTf, BTA or BT2111 (14 µCi/mouse). The animals were sacrificed at various time points 
(30 min, 2 and 8 hours) and levels of radioactivity in the brain and brain metastasis were 
determined using autoradiography imaging of brain sections. The uptake of BT2111 vs. 
hMTf and BTA was analyzed in relation to metastasis size, blood-tumor barrier 
permeability, and time of circulation.
Test article concentrations in blood and selected organs and tissues (brain stem, heart, lung, 
liver, spleen, muscle, fat, and intestine) were determined by radioactive counting. The 
majority of BTA remained in blood circulation with low tissue penetration. At 2 hrs, the 
BTA tissue/blood concentration ratio was the highest in well perfused organs such as 
kidneys (0.34), spleen (0.28), liver, lung and heart (0.13–0.15) while lower levels were 
observed in muscles, fat and intestine (0.04–0.06). The lowest ratios of BTA were recorded 
in the brainstem (0.0054). hMTf showed significantly higher tissue/blood concentration 
ratios as compared to BTA, with test article concentrations in selected tissues being higher 
than in blood. Specifically, at 2 hours the following tissue/blood concentration ratios were 
observed: liver (4.0), spleen (2.47), kidney (1.22), fat (1.03), lung, intestine, heart, and 
muscle (0.17–0.46). hMTf tissue/blood concentration ratio for the brainstem was 0.071 13-
times higher than BTA). Conjugation of BTA to hMTf resulted in higher tissue/blood 
concentration ratios as compared to free BTA. The highest ratios were observed at 2 hrs as 
compared to 30 min and 8 hrs. The highest tissue/blood ratio was observed in lungs (1.86), 
followed by liver (1.23), spleen (0.89), muscle, fat, intestine (0.28–0.43). Similar to hMTf, a 
relatively low level of BT2111 was noted in the heart (0.12).
Fig 2 shows representative images of brain tumors and distribution of Trastuzumab (BTA), 
hMTf (p97) and BT2111 (BTA-p97) at either 0.5, 2 or 8 hours post injection. The choice of 
the time points in Fig 2A–2D was dependent on the highest brain tissue/blood concentration 
ratio for each moiety, either P97, BTA or BT2111. For each moiety, the time point 
corresponding to the highest brain tissue/blood concentration ratio was used. The test article 
concentrations at 0.5, 2 and 8 hours post injection were determined in areas containing brain 
tumors and compared to the concentrations detected in areas distant to tumors. All test 
articles demonstrated higher brain/blood concentration ratio in the tumor area as compared 
to the normal brain area. Specifically, the ratios in the tumors at 0.5 and 2 hours were 
increased 7.9 and 5.1 times (BTA), 3.2 and 1.8 times (hMTf), 4.0 and 1.4 times (BT2111), 
respectively, as compared with the tumor-free brain areas. With respect to the time course, 
all test articles exhibited higher brain/blood concentration ratio at later time points (2 or 8 
hours) as compared to 30 min. Similarly to other tissues, BTA demonstrated the lowest

 tissue penetration with the brain/blood concentration ratios of approximately 1 × 10−7 and 4 
× 10−7 in tumor-free areas and 8 × 10-7 and 19 × 10−7 in tumor lesions at 0.5 and 2 hours, 
respectively. Corresponding hMTf ratios were higher by 2 orders of magnitude: 
approximately 1 × 10−5 and 6 × 10−5 in normal areas and 3 × 10−5 and 10 × 10−5 in tumors, 
respectively. The ratios of BT2111 were significantly higher than the corresponding ratios of 
the free drug. Namely, at 0.5, 2 and 8 hours the brain area/blood concentration ratios were 
approximately 0.2 × 10−5, 9 × 10−5, and 29 × 10−5 in the tumor-free areas and 0.8 × 10−5, 13 
× 10−5, and 51 × 10−5 in tumors, respectively. In general, the BT2111 values were 
comparable to the hMTf values but were 10 to 225 times higher than the corresponding ratio 
values of BTA. In addition to relative values, the concentrations (pg/g) of the test articles in 
tumor areas were estimated. BTA concentrations were 6.4 pg/g at both 0.5 and 2 hrs post 
injection. BT2111 demonstrated significantly higher levels of 33 and 48 pg/g at 2 and 8 
hours. BT2111 concentrations were lower as compared with hMTf (77 and 79 pg/g at 0.5 
and 2 hrs).

BTA, hMTf, and BT2111 at 0.5, 2 and 8 hours’ time points is shown in Fig 2. There was no 
correlation between any of the test articles and the tumor size in which their concentration 
was determined. These results suggest that all test articles exhibit similar penetration into the 
tumors of different sizes, from ~0.1 mm2 and up to ~4 mm2. Under the conditions of the 
study, the pharmacological effect on the tumor size is not anticipated since drug 
concentrations were determined within 0.5–8 hours post single dose administration.
Kin values were determined separately for normal and tumor areas of the brain (Figs. 3 & 4 
and Table 1). Uptake of BTA in “normal” brain (brain distant to tumor; BDT) was 0.17 
± 0.004 × 10−6 mL/s/g and nearly 10 fold higher on average in metastatic lesions (1.1 ± 0.04 
× 10−6 mL/s/g). hMTf uptake into BDT (18.4 ± 0.5 × 10−6 mL/s/g) and brain metastases 
(53.0 ± 3.1 × 10−6 mL/s/g) was significantly higher (p<0.01) than that of the BTA alone. 
BT2111 was nearly 30 fold higher (p<0.01) than that of the BTA alone in BDT (3.91 ± 0.3 × 
10−6 mL/s/g) and 10 fold higher (p<0.01) in metastases (10.7 ± 0.43 × 10−6 mL/s/g).
To quantify the effect of BT2111 on tumor cell colonization of the brain, the number and 
size of metastatic lesions were determined in brain sections. The results are summarized in 
tables 2 and 3 and presented in Fig 4. MDA-MB-231-BRHER2/eGFP cells were cultured, 
harvested and injected into the left cardiac ventricle of mice. BT2111 (17 mg/kg), BTA (10 
mg/kg), hMTf (7 mg/kg) and vehicle control were injected twice per week intraperitoneally 
starting from day 21 post cell injections. All animals were sacrificed on day 35 post 
intracardiac injection of MDA-MB-231-BRHER2/eGFP cells. On the day of euthanasia, 
animals in the control group (vehicle), hMTf and BTA-treated groups exhibited clinical 
signs with almost all animals in the control group showing severe signs. The appearance of 
animals in the BT2111 group was significantly better as compared with the vehicle control 
group. The brains were collected; brain sections prepared and tumor number and size were 
determined based on fluorescent EGFP detection of the transfected tumor cells. Fig 4 shows 
representative fluorescent images from each group highlighting the metastatic lesions size in 
the isolated brain of test NuNu mice after administration of saline, hMTf, BTA and BT2111 
biweekly for two weeks.

 BT2111 reduced the number of preclinical human HER2+ breast cancer metastases in the 
brain of control animals (85 ± 6.3) by 68% (27.6 ± 3.9; P<0.001) (Fig 4A). Further, lesions 
in control animals were 54% larger (1.7 ± 0.7 µm2) than those in the BT2111 treated animals 
(0.78 ± 0.6 µm2; P<0.001) (Fig 4B). In contrast, BTA alone had no effect on reducing the 
number of metastases (74 ± 5.0, P>0.05) and was associated with only a minimal (21%) 
reduction in metastasis size (1.34 ± 0.04 µm2).
7. Discussion
A limitation with the use of Trastuzumab is the continued progression of brain metastases 
despite therapy (22). A large meta-analysis (16), demonstrated the incidence of brain 
metastases increased as a first site of relapse with prolonged exposure to trastuzumab 
antibody. The specific trials included, four phase three randomized controlled trials (NSABP 
B31, NCCTG N9831, HERA, and PACS), which had 125 out of 4921 breast cancer patients 
develop brain metastasis as the site of first recurrence for an overall incidence of 2.56%. In 
contrast, 78 out of 4099 breast cancer patients who did not receive trastuzumab developed 
brain metastasis with an incidence of 1.94%. Further work has shown that the ratio of brain 
metastases to total recurrence events was 16.94% (95% CI, 10.85% – 24.07%) and 8.33% 
(95% CI, 6.49%–10.86%) for patients treated with trastuzumab and those not treated with 
trastuzumab respectively (34). It has been suggested that the increased incidence of brain 
metastasis with trastuzumab therapy maybe a result of increased survival time (35).
A reason for the continued progression may be that trastuzumab as an antibody, has poor 
penetration across the intact BBB (36). For example, patients who have cranial lesions, 
Trastuzumab levels in their cerebrospinal fluid can be ~300-fold lower than concentrations 
in plasma (37) suggesting poor CNS penetration. In a retrospective study (38), healthcare 
administrative data demonstrated 40 patients developed secondary brain metastases of 681 
patients on trastuzumab therapy. Given the poor CNS distribution in both healthy and 
lesioned brains, it is reasonable to suggest trastuzumab treatment does not increase risk for 
brain metastases but rather controls peripheral systemic disorders (39).
Melanotransferrin (hMTf, p97) is a naturally occurring transport protein found at low 
concentrations in the blood (under 7.5 ng/ml = 0.08 nM in healthy adults) (40, 41) and is 
predicted to be one of the oldest members of the Tf family (40, 41). Recombinant MTf is 
actively transported across the BBB in an in vitro model of BBB transcytosis (42, 43), with 
transport rate of 10–15 times higher than that of Tf (42, 43). Biodistribution studies have 
shown preferential distribution of MTf in brain tissue (20, 43, 44), likely facilitated through 
a receptor-mediated transcytosis involving a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-
related protein family (LRP) (20, 21, 45, 46).
This vector has a unique capacity to carry drugs into brain since the concentration of MTf is 
not high enough to significantly competitively inhibit binding of exogenously injected MTf 
conjugates to the receptor (40). Further, MTf-drug conjugates have been shown to traverse 
the brain capillary endothelium within minutes, with end brain concentrations 10 fold higher 
than unconjugated drug (22). Furthermore, as an autologous human protein, immune 
hypersensitivity or elimination via neutralizing antibodies are less likely to be an issue in

 clinical setting. Lastly, since MTf traverse the BBB as part of its normal function, MTf does 
not appear to pose toxicity related issues for the delivery of MTf-drug conjugate into the 
brain. Subsequently, MTf poses less risk than cytokines TNF, which could disrubt the BBB 
by generating a focal inflammatory response(47). Melanotransferrin (hMTf, P97) is branded 
Transcend™ vector platform by BiOasis Inc. (48).
With regard to using this strategy for the treatment of CNS tumors, it has been shown that 
MTf-adriamycin conjugates inhibit growth of subcutaneous gliomas, prolong survival of 
animals with mammary tumors or intracranial gliomas (22). The conjugate MTf has also 
been used to transport monoclonal antibodies across the BBB for the treatment of brain 
cancers. This study is the first to test whether hMTf can be used in the treatment of a human 
Her2+ brain metastasis of breast cancer model.
In order to overcome the trastuzumab inability to cross the BBB and treat brain metastases 
of HER2+ breast cancer, BT2111, a novel bioconjugate of trastuzumab (BTA) was 
developed by biOasis Inc., which is based on the melanotransferrin (hMTf, p97) 
Transcend™vector platform. Administration of BT2111 to NuNu nude mice with brain 
metastasis induced by administration of MDA-MB-231-BRHER2/eGFP cells was 
characterized by significantly improved penetration through the BBB as compared to BTA. 
This effect was associated with the following increased parameters: 1) The brain /blood 
concentration ratio of BT2111 in normal and tumor areas of the brain was 10 to 225 times 
higher than the corresponding ratio for BTA and 2) BT2111 has a Kin value that was 40 
times higher in tumor-free areas of the brain and 10 times higher in tumor areas of the brain 
as compared to BTA. In addition, administration of BT2111 was characterized by 
significantly higher tissue/blood concentration ratios in other organs and tissues of NuNu 
mice as compared to BTA.
Administration of BT2111 (17 mg/kg, IP, biweekly, starting from day 21 post tumor 
injection) resulted in statistically significant reduction of the number (68% reduction) of 
brain tumors induced by administration of human metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-
MB-231-BRHER2/eGFP) to female NuNu mice. The remaining tumors were significantly 
smaller in size (57–60% reduction) than the tumors observed in the control animals. In 
contrast, administration of BTA (10 mg/kg) and hMTf (7 mg/kg) was not accompanied by 
reduction of the brain tumor numbers or by decrease of tumor sizes.
To our knowledge, trastuzumab has not been conjugated to a delivery peptide or vehicle as a 
chemotherapeutic. Currently, trastuzumab is either used alone or in combination therapy for 
breast cancer and its brain metastases. In a case study reported by Şendur et al (49), lapatinib 
and capecitabine combination was used followed by trastuzumab in HER2-positive brain 
metastatic breast cancer. No progression of cranial metastases was found post-treatment. In 
another case report (50), one case out of three HER-2 positive breast cancer patients with 
brain metastasis maintained brain metastases post-treatment with a combination of weekly 
trastuzumab plus vinorelbine after brain metastasis. In an animal study, it was observed that 
the combination of a HER2 inhibitor with an anti–VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) antibody 
along trastuzumab and lapatinib treatment significantly slows tumor growth in the brain, 
(51). According to the authors, trastuzumab may transiently act as an antiangiogenic in a

 leptomeningeal metastasis model of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer through, resulting 
in trastuzumab and lapatinib controlled tumor progression in breast but failing to contain 
tumor growth in brain (51).
In spite of lack of reports on the use of trastuzumab bioconjugates for its antitumor activity, 
previous studies have used trastuzumab as a bioconjugate to specifically deliver antitumor or 
diagnostic agents to HER2-positive cells. For example, bioconjugated 64Cu-DOTA PET 
imaging agent with trastuzumab for the detection of breast cancer and its primary brain 
metastasis on 6 patients. The pilot tumor images of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET 
demonstrated successful tumor uptake and visualization of HER2-positive primary breast 
carcinoma in the 6 patients but only its metastatic lesions in the brain of 2 patients (52) In a 
similar study by Kurihara et al. (53) among five patients, metastatic brain lesions could be 
visualized by 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET in all of cases. In both studies, the number of 
cases were too small to suggest that trastuzumab can pass the BBB and penetrate into CNS 
lesions.
A major trastuzumab bioconjugate, is Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) (54), that links 
trastuzumab, with maytansinoid, DM1, a potent microtubule-disrupting agent. Initial phase 
III clinical trials demonstrated that the conjugate prolonged progression-free and overall 
survival with less toxicity than lapatinib plus capecitabinen in patients with advanced HER2-
positive breast cancer (55). In 2013, T-DM1 received FDA approval for the treatment of 
patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had previously received 
trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination, the first antibody bioconjugate to 
receive full approval based on a randomized study (56). Another example, XMT-1522, 
which conjugates a modified trastuzumab antibody to ~15 auristatin molecules using 
Fleximer, a biodegradable hydrophilic polymer (57).
The results presented in this study provide evidence that BT2111 has efficacy in treating 
brain metastasis in preclinical models and validates the role hMTf has as a vector 
(Transcend™ vector platform) for the transport of antibodies across the BBB. This study has 
shown that Transcend can deliver Herceptin®, a chemotherapeutic used to treat HER2-
positive breast cancer, in sufficient quantity to the brain to significantly reduce the number 
of HER2-positive metastatic brain tumors. The ability to more effectively permeate both the 
blood-brain and the blood-tumor barrier opens the door for the creation of new drugs 
designed to treat a wide variety of neurological diseases and disorders. Additionally, 
Transcend™ vector platform offers the potential to take existing clinically approved drugs 
that are near their end of patent life and extend them.
