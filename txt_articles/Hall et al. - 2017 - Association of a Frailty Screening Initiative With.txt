IMPORTANCE As the US population ages, the number of operations performed on elderly
patients will likely increase. Frailty predicts postoperative mortality and morbidity more than
age alone, thus presenting opportunities to identify the highest-risk surgical patients and
improve their outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To examine the effect of the Frailty Screening Initiative (FSI) on mortality and
complications by comparing the surgical outcomes of a cohort of surgical patients treated
before and after implementation of the FSI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-site, facility-wide, prospective cohort quality
improvement project studied all 9153 patients from a level 1b Veterans Affairs medical center
who presented for major, elective, noncardiac surgery from October 1, 2007, to July 1, 2014.
INTERVENTIONS Assessment of preoperative frailty in all patients scheduled for elective
surgery began in July 2011. Frailty was assessed with the Risk Analysis Index (RAI), and the
records of all frail patients (RAI score, �21) were flagged for administrative review by the
chief of surgery (or designee) before the scheduled operation. On the basis of this review,
clinicians from surgery, anesthesia, critical care, and palliative care were notified of the
patient’
s frailty and associated surgical risks; if indicated, perioperative plans were modified
based on team input.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Postoperative mortality at 30, 180, and 365 days.
RESULTS From October 1, 2007, to July 1, 2014, a total of 9153 patients underwent surgery
(mean [SD] age, 60.3 [13.5] years; female, 653 [7.1%]; and white, 7096 [79.8%]). Overall
30-day mortality decreased from 1.6% (84 of 5275 patients) to 0.7% (26 of 3878 patients,
P < .001) after FSI implementation. Improvement was greatest among frail patients (12.2%
[24 of 197 patients] to 3.8% [16 of 424 patients], P < .001), although mortality rates also
decreased among the robust patients (1.2% [60 of 5078 patients] to 0.3% [10 of 3454
patients], P < .001). The magnitude of improvement among frail patients increased at 180
(23.9% [47 of 197 patients] to 7.7% [30 of 389 patients], P < .001) and 365 days (34.5% [68
of 197 patients] to 11.7% [36 of 309 patients], P < .001). Multivariable models revealed
improved survival after FSI implementation, controlling for age, frailty, and predicted
mortality (adjusted odds ratio for 180-day survival, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.98-4.16).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Implementation of the FSI was associated with reduced
mortality, suggesting the feasibility of widespread screening of patients preoperatively to
identify frailty and the efficacy of system-level initiatives aimed at improving their surgical
outcomes. Additional investigation is required to establish a causal connection.

any patients older than 65 years undergo surgery.1
Forsome,surgerywillconfersubstantialbenefits(eg,
extended life, improved quality of life). For others,
surgery will confer burdens for patients, families, and society
at large (eg, pain, distress, increased inpatient admissions, in-
stitutionalization,financialhardship,andincreasedhealthcare
costs).2,3 Thus, there is an imperative to identify patients at
greatest risk for harm, ensure their decision-making process
regardingsurgeryispatientcentered,andprovidetailoredclini-
cal care to improve surgical outcomes in high-risk patients.
Recent data indicate that frailty is a more powerful pre-
dictor of increased perioperative mortality, morbidity, and cost
than predictions based on age or comorbidity alone.2-7 For ex-
ample, when compared with robust patients, frail surgical pa-
tients are less likely to be discharged to home,6 more likely to
be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days,3,7 and more likely
to have substantially increased rates of perioperative mortal-
ity and complications.2,4,5,7,8 As such, measuring frailty sub-
stantially improves the receiver operating characteristic of pre-
dicting mortality and morbidity when compared with classic
tools,suchasAmericanSocietyofAnesthesiologists(ASA)clas-
sification and the Lee criteria, which systematically underes-
timate mortality and morbidity in high-risk populations and
are not suitable for rapid, system-level screening.5,7,9-11 How-
ever, to our knowledge, no published studies have examined
facility-wide preoperative screening for frailty aimed at im-
proving the care and outcomes of these vulnerable surgical
patients.
The Surgical Service Line at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Ne-
braska–Western Iowa Health Care System (NWIHCS) in Omaha
conducts 3600 operations annually, of which 41.8% are per-
formed in those 65 years or older. Before 2011, preoperative
risk assessment at the NWIHCS focused on traditional cardio-
pulmonary testing and evaluation by anesthesia. However, be-
cause of increasing postoperative mortality in 5 of 7 quarters
before July 2011, the NWIHCS chief of surgery (J.M.J.) de-
signed and implemented a quality improvement (QI) project
called the Frailty Screening Initiative (FSI) aimed at improv-
ing postoperative survival. The FSI screened for frailty among
all patients considering elective surgery, and for those iden-
tified as frail, the FSI reviewed the surgical decision making
with surgeons, anesthesiologists, and palliative care physi-
cians. Informed by the Standards for Quality Improvement Re-
porting Excellence 2 guidelines for reporting QI projects,12 we
examined the effect of the FSI on mortality and complica-
tions by comparing the surgical outcomes of a cohort of
surgical patients treated before and after implementation of
the FSI.
Methods
Context
TheFSIwasconductedattheNWIHCStoaddressaclinicalneed
of increased rates of case- and complexity-adjusted postop-
erative mortality. The NWIHCS is a large level 1b hospital at
which 3600 operations are performed per year across 12 sur-
gical service divisions (general surgery, vascular surgery, tho-
racic surgery, plastic surgery, urology, otolaryngology, oph-
thalmology, neurosurgery, orthopedics, oral maxillofacial,
gynecology, and podiatry). Once a patient and surgeon agree
to pursue surgery, the procedure is posted to the operating
roomschedule,andthepatientisreferredtothesurgicalevalu-
ation unit (SEU) for perioperative risk assessment and man-
agement. The workup typically focuses on cardiopulmonary
testing and optimization, but after implementing the FSI, it ex-
panded to include frailty assessment.
TheNWIHCSInstitutionalReviewBoarddeterminedthese
procedures to be an operations activity not constituting re-
search, and thus, per Veterans Health Administration policy
(Handbook 1058.0513), the information presented in this ar-
ticle does not require informed consent or institutional re-
view board approval.
Intervention
The FSI consisted of 2 parts: (1) screening for frailty with the
goal of rapid assessment without need for patient medical rec-
ord access and (2) review of surgical decision making. Begin-
ning in July 2011, all patients presenting for elective surgical
procedures at the NWIHCS were screened for frailty using the
Risk Analysis Index (RAI) as part of the standard intake ex-
amination at the outpatient surgical clinics. The RAI is a 14-
item questionnaire that takes less than 2 minutes to com-
plete in a nonfrail patient, generates scores ranging from 0 to
81, and powerfully predicts postoperative mortality.14-17 To en-
sure adherence, the RAI score was required to schedule an op-
eration.
Patients identified as frail (RAI score, ≥21) were flagged by
the surgical quality nurse (G.P.) for administrative review by
the chief of surgery (J.M.J.) or his designee. Reviewers in-
cluded surgeons with a range of experience from senior staff
to house officers. Reviewers examined the electronic medi-
cal record of each patient identified as frail to clarify decision
making regarding surgery and optimize perioperative care. In-
terventions included informal discussions with the sur-
geons, anesthesiologists, and critical care physicians aimed at
alerting them to the patient’
s frailty, the attendant risks, and
patient prognosis for 6-month mortality. When appropriate,
formal preoperative palliative care consultation focused on
Key Points
Question Can surgical outcomes of frail patients be improved by
facility-wide frailty screening and subsequent administrative
review of perioperative surgical decision making?
Findings After implementing a quality improvement project
called the Frailty Screening Initiative in a prospective cohort of
9153 patients who underwent surgery, postoperative mortality
decreased significantly at 30, 180, and 365 days. Multivariate
models revealed a 3-fold survival benefit after controlling for age,
frailty, and predicted mortality.
Meaning Frailty screening of preoperative patients is feasible and
may be an effective tool for improving surgical outcomes for an
aging and increasingly frail US population.

clarifying goals and expectations for the surgery and postop-
erativerecovery,includingdiscussionsregardingventilatorde-
pendence, dialysis, and do-not-resuscitate or do-not-
intubate status.
The goals of the FSI were clearly focused on assisting and
enhancing the decision making shared by surgeon and pa-
tient, and the frailty score was never used to refuse an opera-
tion that the surgeon and patient wanted to pursue. How-
ever, it is likely that the frailty diagnosis occasionally changed
the decision to operate, the choice of specific procedure, or the
anesthetic plan, although because of the operational focus of
this QI project, we were not able to capture qualitative or quan-
titative details about those changes. Nonetheless, the opera-
tive volume at the NWIHCS did not change substantively, sug-
gestingthatmostoperationsproceededasplanned.Inaddition,
and as described previously in a subgroup analysis of this
cohort,15 the FSI significantly changed the pattern of pallia-
tive care consultation such that, after implementing the FSI,
palliative care consultation was most often ordered before
rather than after the operation and by a surgeon rather than
an intensivist or hospitalist.
Statistical Analysis
To examine the effect of the FSI, we analyzed prospectively
collected data from a cohort of patients treated at the NWI-
HCS from October 1, 2007, to July 1, 2014. These data were
drawn from a QI database maintained by the NWIHCS that in-
cludes multiple quality variables, including all variables ab-
stractedthroughtheVeteransAffairsSurgicalQualityImprove-
ment Program (VASQIP). The database constitutes a
representative sample of all the noncardiac, major elective sur-
gicalproceduresconductedattheNWIHCS.18Wefurtherlinked
these data to the US Department of Veterans Affairs vital sta-
tistics file to capture dates of death for all patients who had
died.
To measure frailty in this cohort retrospectively, we
mapped VASQIP variables to each of the 14 items of the RAI
and calculated an RAI score as described elsewhere.14 We also
calculated the modified Frailty Index as previously
described4,19 and used by others.20 We calculated the length
of survival from the date of surgery to the date of death, pre-
suming that patients without a date of death remained alive.
Mortality rates before and after FSI implementation were com-
pared using the Pearson χ2 tests. Two-sided P < .05 was con-
sideredsignificant.Multivariablelogisticregressionmodelsex-
amined the effect of the FSI on mortality, controlling for age
and frailty. For illustrative purposes, we plotted Kaplan-
Meier survival curves stratified by RAI score for the cohorts
before and after FSI implementation, comparing the curves
withpairwiseMantel-Coxlogranktests.Allanalyseswerecon-
ducted using SPSS statistical software, version 23 (IBM Inc).
Results
Development and testing of the FSI began in July 2010. Ret-
rospective analysis of a cohort of patients with hip fracture re-
vealedtheRAI’
spromisingabilitytopredictpostoperativemor-
bidity and mortality. Pilot tests in small convenience samples
of outpatients confirmed the RAI’
s ease of clinical adminis-
tration. On the basis of these data, we began screening pa-
tients with the RAI in the SEU in October 2010. This approach
confirmed our ability to identify a limited group of frail pa-
tients at high risk, but we learned that screening in the SEU was
not ideal because not all patients were evaluated by the SEU
and diagnosis of frailty was delayed until after the decision for
or against surgical treatment. We therefore moved the frailty
screen upstream, deploying the RAI to select surgical clinics
in January 2011, with increasing adoption during 2 quarters.
Weekly assessment and feedback to clinics revealed increas-
ing adherence in nearly 90% of elective surgical patients being
assessed. Given the positive feedback from the effected sur-
gical services, we made the RAI score mandatory in July 2011:
the case scheduler was instructed to record the RAI score into
the electronic medical record, thus achieving near 100% ad-
herence for elective surgical procedures.
Administrative review of frail patients initially focused on
clarifying the operative plan through discussion between the
reviewer and the surgeon of record. During the first 6 months,
the review rapidly expanded to include formal and informal
consultation with anesthesiologists and critical care physi-
cianstodevelopplansforintraoperativeandpostoperativecare
informed by geriatric care principles and strategies for early
recognition and treatment of expected complications (eg, res-
cue therapy). In addition, the reviewer recommended preop-
erative palliative care consultation to the surgeon of record
when the medical record did not document a clear discussion
of the patient’
s goals of care or the high risk of surgery in the
setting of frailty.
The analysis includes data from a prospective cohort of
9153 patients who underwent surgery at the NWIHCS from Oc-
tober 1, 2007, to July 1, 2014 (mean [SD] age, 60.3 [13.5] years;
653 females [7.1%] and 7096 white [79.8%]). These patients
included all those in the local VASQIP-related QI database who
were also matched to the vital statistics file for long-term sur-
vival and mortality. Demographic characteristics of the pa-
tients treated before and after FSI implementation (July 2011)
were similar with regard to age, sex, race, ASA classification,
and comorbidity (Table 1). Most patients were not frail, with
only 6.8% scoring 21 or higher on the RAI and only 11.1% scor-
ing higher than 0.27 on the modified Frailty Index. Patient age
and frailty were similar before and after FSI implementation
(mean [SD] age of 60.3 [13.4] years before and 60.3 [13.7] years
after, mean [SD] RAI score of 8.36 [4.86] before and 10.33 [7.38]
after,andmean[SD]modifiedFrailtyIndexscoreof0.20[0.10]
before and 0.20 [0.10] after). As expected, mortality rates in-
creased with frailty (Table 2). For example, 180-day mortality
increased from 1.6% (113 of 7217 patients) among those with
the lowest RAI scores to 29.6% (16 of 54 patients) among those
with the highest RAI scores.
As reported in Table 3, overall 30-day mortality de-
creased from 1.6% (84 of 5275 patients) to 0.7% (26 of 3878 pa-
tients) (P < .001) after FSI implementation. Improvement was

0.3% [10 of 3454 patients], P < .001). The magnitude of im-
provement among frail patients increased at 180 (23.9% [47
of 197 patients] to 7.7% [30 of 389 patients], P < .001) and 365
days (34.5% [68 of 197 patients] to 11.7% [36 of 309 patients],
P < .001). Kaplan-Meier curves (Figure) reveal that increas-
ing frailty is associated with an increased risk of death but that
these risks were significantly reduced after FSI implementa-
tion (P < .001).
Multivariable models controlling for age and RAI score re-
vealed that postoperative survival improved at each time ho-
rizon (Table 4). To examine what portion of the effect was at-
tributable to the intervention, we added to our model an
interaction between FSI implementation and frailty (eg, RAI
score >21). At 30 days, the interaction was not a significant pre-
dictor of mortality (P = .66), but the interaction predicted sur-
vival at 180 and 365 days (Table 4). Finally, for all but 418 pa-
tients, our data included the probability of death predicted by
the VASQIP algorithms based on patient- and procedure-
related risk factors. Adding this to our model diminished the
magnitude of the main effect slightly, but the overarching find-
ings of the analysis remained robust after this control (Table 4),
confirming the independent role of the screening initiative in
decreasing mortality.
Discussion
This study reveals the feasibility of facility-wide frailty screen-
ing in elective surgical populations. It also suggests the po-
tential to improve postoperative survival among the frail
through systematic administrative screening, review, and op-
timization of perioperative plans. The absolute reduction in
180-day mortality among frail patients was more than 19%,

Although the initiative was aimed primarily at frail pa-
tients, improvements were noted among both frail and ro-
bust patients. This finding is likely because of a Hawthorne
effect.21,22However,improvementwasgreatestamongfrailpa-
tients at 180 and 365 days (odds ratios, 2.19 and 1.88, respec-

days. By identifying frail patients (eg, RAI score ≥21) and tar-

a Differences between mortality before and after implementing the FSI were
tested using the Pearson χ2 test. Differences were significant at every time

The sample included all 9153 patients (5275 before FSI implementation and
3878 after FSI implementation). Mantel-Cox log rank tests for differences in the
survival distribution are as follows (P < .001 for overall difference before and
after FSI implementation). Before FSI implementation, the lowest 2 strata of
frailty were different from each other and from all the other strata (all P < .001).
There was no difference between the 16 to 20 and 21 to 25 Risk Analysis Index
(RAI) strata (P = .31), although the 16 to 20 RAI stratum was different from the
highest 3 strata of frailty (all P < .05). The 21 to 25 RAI stratum was not different
from the 26 to 30 (P = .16) or the 31 to 35 (P = .24) RAI stratum, but it was
different from the 36 to 62 RAI stratum (P = .004). Although the lines of the
highest 3 strata diverge, the differences did not reach statistical significance (all
P > .05); however, this is likely attributable to the low numbers in these RAI
strata. After FSI implementation, the lowest frailty stratum was different from
all others (P < .001), but there was no difference between the next RAI strata
(eg, 11-15, 16-20, and 21-25; all P > .20), although these 3 were different from the
top 3 strata (all P < .03). There was no difference between the top 3 strata (eg,
26-30, 31-35, and 36-62; all P > .50), but they were all different from each of the
lowest 3 strata (all P < .05). Hash marks indicate censored data.

with frailty itself. This finding also suggests that it takes more
than 30 days to detect the effect of these interventions, fur-
ther delineating the limitations of 30-day outcomes noted by
others.23,24
The ultimate cause of the survival benefit is likely multi-
factorial, including changes in preoperative decision making,
intraoperative management, and postoperative rescue. A con-
sensus panel outlined several potential targets for improving
the perioperative management of frail patients, including
frailty-specific anesthetic plans, clarified goals of care identi-
fied in the preoperative setting, and improved postoperative
management.25 Postoperative rescue therapy deserves spe-
cific consideration. Research reveals that major complica-
tions occur in 40% of frail patients after major operations, and
thus frail patients frequently require attempts at rescue from
those complications.20 By identifying frail patients at great-
est risk for complications, the FSI may have raised the vigi-
lance of clinicians to recognize those complications earlier and
treat them more effectively. In addition, we suspect that in-
creasing reliance on preoperative palliative care consultation
andformal,preoperativedocumentationofgoalsmayhaveim-
proved the rate of rescue by better delineating the patient’
s ex-
pectations regarding rescue therapies, such as ventilator man-
agement or dialysis in the immediate postoperative period. In
fact, on more than one occasion, NWIHCS clinicians de-
scribed situations when a patient became incapacitated from
a complication in the postoperative period: the surrogate de-
cision maker initiated conversations about withdrawal of care,
but the palliative care consultant’
s note clearly stated the pa-
tient’
s intention to pursue aggressive rescue therapies for at
least a time-limited trial. Having these expectations well docu-
mented by somebody other than the surgeon may help build
consensus among patients’families and clinicians, thus giv-
ing rescue therapies adequate time to treat some of the sur-
vivable complications that frail patients predictably incur. Fi-
nally, on the basis of improvement in survival not only at 30
days but also at 180 and 365 days, we suspect postdischarge
care and social support were also improved through engage-
ment of the family in the entire operative process, including
long-term recovery.
Although our data cannot quantify how the FSI changed
perioperative decision making, it is likely that some frail pa-
tients did not undergo surgery and are thus not included in this
analysis. This potential selection bias could explain some of
the effect. However, the mean frailty of the cohort after FSI
implementation was actually higher than that in the cohort be-
fore FSI implementation (mean RAI scores, 10.33 vs 8.36), sug-
gesting that many frail patients continued to seek and secure
surgical treatment—even in light of preoperatively diagnosed
frailty. In a previously published subgroup analysis of 310 of
these patients receiving palliative care consultations, we con-
trolled for whether patients underwent surgery, and the sur-
vival benefit remained robust (odds ratio of dying after FSI
implementation, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22-0.62).15
These results also provide estimates of the likely rates of
postoperative mortality over time at different levels of frailty,
and these estimates have potential to inform the shared deci-
sion making between surgeons and patients. For example, pa-
tients with RAI scores between 26 and 30 have associated mor-
tality risks of 20.3% at 6 months, increasing to 32.0% at 1 year.
The associated 30-day mortality of only 9.5% might be per-
ceived as a better than 90% chance of survival, and thus sur-
geons and patients alike might persevere with surgical treat-
ment. However, with these reliable estimates of longer-term

a For the interaction between FSI implementation and frailty, patients were
considered frail if they had RAI scores of 21 or higher. Sample sizes for models 1
and 2 were 9153, 8667, and 8056 for the 30-day, 180-day, and 365-day
survival groups, respectively. Because 418 patients were missing data on the
predicted mortality based on Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement
Program algorithms, the sample sizes for model 3 were 8735, 8249, and 7638
for the 30-day, 180-day, and 365-day survival groups, respectively.

mortality, it is likely that some patients will consider the risks
too great and forgo surgery. Such longer-term mortality esti-
mates are critical for shared decision making when the time
to treatment equipoise26 for the proposed surgery ap-
proaches or exceeds the patient’
s expected life span.
From a systems perspective, frailty screening with the RAI
has many advantages. First, because the RAI is based on the
deficit accumulation frailty model, it is easier to operational-
ize than functional assessments, such as the Fried frailty
phenotype.27 However, because it includes 10 elements of the
Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index and be-
cause a similarly abbreviated version of the Canadian Study
of Health and Aging Frailty Index had excellent predictive
ability and discrimination compared with the Fried frailty
phenotype,27 it is likely that the RAI will also perform on par
with functional assessments of frailty. Second, because the
RAI encompasses multiple domains of frailty (comorbidity,
functional status, nutrition, and cognition), it represents a
more comprehensive frailty assessment than the modified
Frailty Index, the other deficit accumulation model of
frailty validated in surgical populations that only includes
domains of comorbidity and functional status. Third, the
RAI is the only surgical frailty measure to look beyond 30
days, predicting longer-term outcomes to 1 year. Fourth, the
current study reveals the ability to screen entire populations
of surgical patients with a precision that makes it flexible for
clinical use.
Limitations
Our findings are limited in several ways. Most important, al-
though we were able to control for frailty, we were unable to
account for patients who screened as frail and did not un-
dergo surgery. This limitation may be a source of significant
selection bias, although it is clear that surgeons continued to
operate on frail patients. Further research using a random-
ized controlled design will be necessary to establish the causal
connection between the FSI and mortality outcomes. In ad-
dition, our QI intervention did not adhere to a formal postop-
erative intervention or prehabilitation protocol, thus limiting
our ability to infer the causative factor behind improvement.
Further research is required to standardize the approach and
discern which parts of the intervention are essential and in-
fluential. The generalizability of our findings is limited to a
single Veterans Affairs medical center, although the charac-
teristics of the cohort appear comparable to other Veterans Af-
fairs populations. Last, although survival improved, we know
littleaboutthequalityofthesurvivinglife.Futurestudiesmust
confirm this assumption by assessing patient-centered out-
comes, such as quality of life and the patient-centeredness of
decisions.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to document
the feasibility of facility-wide screening of frailty and how
implementation of an FSI is associated with improved sur-
vival at 30, 180, and 365 days. We also found that the RAI pre-
dicts postoperative mortality, with an initial calibration of the
RAItopredictmortalityamongelectivesurgicalpatientswithin
aVeteransAffairspopulation.Dependingonthethresholdcho-
sen, the RAI identifies 5% to 20% of the population as poten-
tially frail, and although further research is needed, there are
several plausible interventions to improve outcomes among
the frail through prehabilitation,28,29 patient-centered deci-
sion making,15 and rescue therapy. This project is timely in the
changing health care environment, which incentivizes value-
based care deployed to enhance population health. Hospitals
and surgeons are looking for replicable models that can effi-
ciently use existing resources and improve the quality and
safetyofsurgeryinarapidlyagingpopulation.Thisstudybuilds
a platform for further investigation into the causal connec-
tions and mechanisms behind improved survival after sys-
tematic frailty screening in preoperative populations. The sus-
tainability of FSI in the long term and implementation in

flow, use of electronic medical records, and standardization

Invited Commentary
A Call for Frailty Screening in the Preoperative Setting
Anne M. Suskind, MD, MS; Emily Finlayson, MD, MS
Frailty is associated with an increased risk of undesirable post-
operativeoutcomesacrosssurgicalsubspecialties,includingcom-
plications,lengthofstay,dischargetoaskilledorassisted-living
facility,1-3andmorbidity.4With
the rapidly increasing older
population,frailtyassessment
in the preoperative setting is
becoming an increasingly important, yet rarely performed,
screening tool that is recommended by both the American Col-
lege of Surgeons and the American Geriatric Society.5
In this issue of JAMA Surgery, Hall et al6 share their expe-
rience with the implementation of the Frailty Screening Ini-
tiative at a Veterans Affairs medical center. They used the Risk
AnalysisIndex,whichisadeficitaccumulationmodeloffrailty,
to identify frail individuals to undergo further review before
their anticipated operation. Compared with a historical con-
trol of patients in the same medical center before implemen-
tation of the Frailty Screening Initiative, patients who under-
went frailty screening had a decrease in overall mortality from
1.6% to 0.7%. However, this decrease was most pronounced
