SUMMARY
Aberrant activation of the SRC family kinase hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) triggers 
hematological malignancies as a tumor cell-intrinsic oncogene. Here we find that high HCK levels 
correlate with reduced survival of colorectal cancer patients. Likewise, increased Hck activity in 
mice promotes the growth of endogenous colonic malignancies and of human colorectal cancer 
cell xenografts. Furthermore, tumor-associated macrophages of the corresponding tumors show a 
pronounced alternatively activated endotype, which occurs independently of mature lymphocytes 
or of Stat6-dependent Th2 cytokine signaling. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition or genetic 
reduction of Hck activity suppresses alternative activation of tumor-associated macrophages and 
the growth of colon cancer xenografts. Thus, Hck may serve as a promising therapeutic target for 
solid malignancies.

INTRODUCTION
The cytoplasmic hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) is one of nine SRC family non-receptor 
tyrosine kinases (SFKs) and is expressed primarily in cells of the myeloid and B lymphocyte 
lineages (Ziegler et al., 1987). The physiological functions of Hck have been delineated in 
mice either completely deficient for Hck expression (HckKO) (Lowell and Benton, 1998), or 
in HckCA mice expressing a constitutive active kinase encoded by a mutation in the 
endogenous Hck gene (Ernst et al., 2002). These studies suggest a regulatory role for Hck 
during innate immune responses, with HckCA mice showing enhanced migration of myeloid 
cells resulting in exacerbated response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration (Ernst et 
al., 2002).
Owing to a common molecular structure, aberrant activation of SFKs most frequently results 
from truncation or phenylalanine missense mutation of the C-terminal located negative 
regulatory tyrosine residue (Y499 in mouse Hck), which was first recognized as the 
molecular mechanism bestowing oncogenic activity to the viral oncoprotein v-Src (Snyder 
and Bishop, 1984). Subsequent studies have identified similar mutations in the cellular 
counterpart c-SRC, including somatic truncation mutations in 12% of advanced human 
colon colorectal cancer (CRC) (Irby et al., 1999). Likewise, hematopoietic malignancies can 
occur from aberrant HCK activation as a consequence of de novo formation of oncogenic 
HCK fusion proteins, or expression of viral proteins that impair the catalytic regulation of 
HCK activity (Pene-Dumitrescu et al., 2012). Increased HCK expression is also associated 
with breast, gastric, and other solid malignancies (Kubo et al., 2009; Rody et al., 2009), and 
a transcriptome survey of human CRC xenografts grown in mice identified Hck as the most 
abundantly expressed SFK in the tumor-associated host stroma (Isella et al., 2015).

 The tumor stroma comprises a heterogeneous collection of cells including fibroblasts, 
adipocytes, endothelial and mesenchymal cells, together with cells of the adaptive and innate 
immune systems. Among the latter, macrophages and other myeloid-derived cells promote 
tumorigenesis through the secretion of growth factors and cytokines that enhance 
angiogenesis, stimulate tumor cell survival, invasion, and metastasis, and confer immune 
evasion (Lanskron et al., 2014). Some of these cells undergo polarization within the tumor 
microenvironment in response to cues from tumor cells and activated lymphocytes. For 
neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and best characterized for macrophages 
(Mantovani, 2014), this encompasses a phenotypic continuum from M1-like, classically 
activated macrophages (CAMs) with phagocytic activity to M2-like, alternatively activated 
macrophages (AAMs) associated with wound-healing and tissue-repair responses (Qian and 
Pollard, 2010). Accordingly, interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) 
induce polarization toward CAM endotypes associated with tumoricidal responses, and 
characterized by the induction of NOS2 and the release of inflammatory cytokines. In 
contrast, the Th2-derived cytokines, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 promote polarization 
toward AAM endotypes associated with the induction of Arg1 to collectively promote 
angiogenesis, tissue remodeling and immune suppression (Biswas and Mantovani, 2010).
We previously observed that exacerbation of inflammatory signaling and enhanced immune 
cell recruitment in HckCA mice resulted in spontaneous innate immune cell consolidation in 
the lung that was reminiscent of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and infrequently 
triggered formation of pulmonary adenocarcinoma (Ernst et al., 2002). Because of the 
striking expression of HCK in the non-epithelial stromal compartment of colon cancer 
xenografts, we here determined the mechanism by which Hck signaling in immune cells 
promotes inflammation and tumor formation.
RESULTS
Excessive HCK Expression in Human CRC Is Associated with an AAM Gene Signature
HCK is the most abundantly expressed SFK in the stroma of mice bearing human CRC 
xenografts (Isella et al., 2015), but the functional relevance of this observation remains 
unclear. We therefore used the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein isoforms as surrogate 
markers for HCK activity in matched human CRC and control biopsies, and observed 
increased abundance of the phosphorylated (p)-p59HCK and p-p61HCK protein isoforms in 
three of seven tumors (Figure 1A). This observation correlated with elevated HCK mRNA 
expression in these biopsies (r = 0.8, p = 0.048) (Figure 1B). In these tumors, we confirmed 
that HCK protein localized to stromal cells co-expressing the leukocyte common antigen 
CD45, but not to EpCAM+ epithelial cells (Figure 1C).
We next defined the median level of HCK gene expression in two independent datasets 
(GEO: GSE16125, GSE17537) to categorize human CRC samples into HCKHigh and 
HCKLow cohorts (Goswami and Nakshatri, 2013). Surprisingly, we identified a poorer 
overall survival for the HCKHigh cohorts (Figure 1D). We next mined TCGA transcriptome 
datasets by Voom differentially expressed gene analysis and identified 864 genes with at 
least a 2-fold difference in expression between HCKHigh and HCKLow sporadic CRC tumors 
(844 upregulated, 20 down-regulated, p < 0.05). Because HCK may regulate gene expression

 in alternatively activated human monocytes (Bhattacharjee et al., 2011), we interrogated the 
expression signatures of the HCKHigh and the HCKLow CRC cohorts for genes associated 
with AAMs and CAMs. We used transcriptional profiling studies from polarized monocytes 
(Kadl et al., 2010; Lacey et al., 2012) as a guide to identify CAM- and AAM-associated 
genes that were at least 2-fold more abundant (p < 0.05) in the HCKHigh than the HCKLow 
cohort. Among the 100 most differentially expressed genes, 39 were associated with an 
AAM and 25 with a CAM endotype (Figure 1E). When subjected to KEGG pathway 
analysis, the HCKHigh gene expression set revealed enrichments for pathways associated 
with asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, leishmaniasis, and other AAM-linked diseases (Table S1).
Given the overlapping activity among SFKs, we next sought to identify AAM and CAM 
genes associated with the four SFKs most prominently expressed in the mouse stroma of 
human CRC xenografts (Isella et al., 2015). Using a similar strategy to that for sub-dividing 
patients according to HCK expression, we identified CAM- and AAM-associated markers 
from the top 100 upregulated genes for the FGR, LCK, and LYN cohorts (Figure S1A). 
Interestingly, the HCKHigh group contained by far the largest number of AAM-associated 
genes, while the LYNHigh cohort contained the most CAM-associated genes. We then 
selected IL7R, HLA-DQA1, PLEK, and IGSF6 for CAM, and F13A1, C3AR1, C1QB, and 
SLAMF8 for AAM genes overexpressed in HCKHigh tumors, alongside IDO1 and MARCO 
as CAM and AAM genes regulated by all four SFKs, and confirmed their differential 
expression between HCKHigh and HCKLow CRC tumors analyzed in Figure 1A by qPCR 
(Figure S1B). Collectively, this provides a strong correlation between HCK gene expression, 
HCK activation, and expression of an AAM signature associated with poor patient 
prognosis.
Constitutive Hck Activity Enhances Sporadic and Colitis-Associated CRC Associated with 
Increased Stat3 Activity
To investigate a functional link between excessive HCK activity and CRC, we exploited 
HckCA mutant mice, which carry a homozygous tyrosine-to-phenylalanine (Y499F) 
substitution mutation in the endogenous Hck protein to render the kinase constitutively 
active (Ernst et al., 2002). We subjected HckCA mutant mice to a model of sporadic colon 
tumorigenesis by repeated administration of the carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM). In a 
complementary model, we also used AOM in conjunction with exposure two cycles of 
dextran sodium sulfate to replicate the inflammation flares observed in colitis-associated 
colon cancer (CAC). In the sporadic CRC model we reproducibly detected at least twice as 
many tumors in HckCA mice compared with wildtype (WT) mice, and those tumors were 
consistently larger (Figures 2A and 2B). This observation was also replicated in the CAC 
model (Figures S2A and S2B). We then quantified the phosphorylated protein isoforms of 
Stat3, Erk, and rpS6 as surrogates for activation of pathways underpinning CRC growth 
(Putoczki et al., 2013; Thiem et al., 2013) and observed prominent Stat3 and rpS6 
phosphorylation in tumors from HckCA mice in either model (Figures 2C and S2C), while 
the excessive Erk pathway remained restricted to tumors of CAC-challenged HckCA mice 
(Figure S2C). Because we previously showed that Gp130-family cytokines facilitates the 
growth of CRC tumors (Thiem et al., 2013), we analyzed expression of the genes encoding 
IL-6 and IL-11, and detected elevated expression of both cytokines in sporadic and CAC

 tumors of HckCA mice (Figures 2D and S2D). We therefore conclude that irrespective of the 
presence of overt colitis, excessive Hck activity promotes tumor incidence/initiation as well 
as tumor growth/progression, and this correlates with activation of signaling pathways 
engaged by IL-6 and IL-11 (Bollrath et al., 2009; Putoczki et al., 2013).
Hematopoietic HckCA Promotes Tumorigenesis
To investigate the cellular fraction that conferred increased susceptibility of HckCA mice to 
tumorigenesis, we enriched for CD45+CD11b+F4/80+ tumor-associated macrophages 
(TAMs) and EpCAM+ tumor epithelial cells to confirm that HCK expression remained 
restricted to TAMs (Figures 3A and S3A). We then derived reciprocal bone marrow 
chimeras and controlled for confounding whole-body irradiation effects with syngeneic 
Hck←Hck (Recipient←Donor) and WT←WT chimeras. We observed a larger tumor burden in 
WT←Hck bone marrow chimeras subjected to either the sporadic or the CAC tumorigenesis 
protocol (Figures 3B, 3C, S3B, and S3C), while the tumor burden in Hck←WT mice 
remained similar to that of WT←WT controls. Western blot analysis of sporadic and CAC 
tumors from Hck←Hck and WT←Hck mice revealed elevated Stat3 and rpS6 activity when 
compared with WT←WT and Hck←WT mice, while elevated p-Erk1/2 remained specific to 
CAC tumors from mice harboring HckCA bone marrow (Figures 3D and S3D).
Given the expression of HCK in the myeloid and B lymphoid cells, and the recognized 
crosstalk between lymphoid- and myeloid-derived immune cells during CRC progression 
(DeNardo et al., 2010), we exploited mature B and T lymphocyte-deficient Rag1 knockout 
mice (Rag1KO). Although we confirmed that Rag1KO mice were resistant to AOM-induced 
sporadic tumorigenesis (Becker et al., 2004), we observed similar tumor burden between 
WT and HckCA;Rag1KO mutants in both models, although HckCA;Rag1KOmice harbored 
larger tumors (Figures 3E and S3E). Thus, constitutive Hck activation in the non-lymphoid 
bone marrow cell compartment boosts tumor initiation and growth.
HckCA Tumors Harbor AAMs
Since Hck activity enhances migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation (Ernst et al., 
2002; Mazzi et al., 2015), we quantified tumor-associated immune cells by flow cytometry. 
Surprisingly, in both CRC models we observed a comparable abundance between WT and 
HckCA mice of CD45+ cells gated for CD19+ B lymphocytes (15.90% ± 0.93% versus 
14.93% ± 0.73%; data refer to sporadic model), TCRβ+ T lymphocytes (36.87% ± 1.88% 
versus 33.73%±1.53%),orCD11b+F4/80+macrophages (17.8% ± 0.50% versus 19.36% 
± 2.67%).
Since Hck signaling has been suggested to facilitate polarization of monocytes to an 
alternatively activated endotype (Bhattacharjee et al., 2011), we assessed the AAM markers 
Il4, Il10, Il13, Arg1, and Ym1, and CAM markers Il1β, Tnfα, Nos2, and Cd86 in tumors 
from WT and HckCA mice (Figures 4A and S4A). Although AAM markers were more 
abundantly expressedintumors than in unaffected areas, we detected more profound AAM 
polarization in tumors of HckCA mice, and in particular of the functional AAM-determinant 
Arg1 when compared with its CAM-counterpart Nos2. In HckCA tumors we also noted a 
further increase of Il1β and Tnfα expression, while tumor-free colon regions of these mice

 showed also elevated expression of Arg1 and Ym1 (Figures 4A and S4A). Since we did not 
detect any difference in gene expression between colons of treatment-naive WT and HckCA 
mice, AAM polarization may occur through long-range signals from tumor cells rather than 
from their physical association with each other. These data mirror the prominent AAM 
signature in human HCKHigh tumors and indicate that Hck activation promotes polarization 
toward an AAM endotype, rather than conferring quantitative changes to the various tumor-
infiltrating immune cell populations.
Hck Activation Promotes Alternative Activation of TAMs
Next, we used CD206 expression in purified CD45+CD11b+F4/80+ cells to identify AAMs, 
and confirmed their preferential accumulation in tumors of HckCA mice (Figures 4B and 
S4B). This coincided with purified CD45+CD11b+F4/80+ TAMs in HckCA mice expressing 
higher levels of the AAM markers Il4, Il10, Il13, Arg1, Ym1, and Tie2 than those isolated 
from tumors of WT mice (Figures 4C and S4C). We then performed reciprocal bone marrow 
transfer experiments to prove that the macrophage endotype was an intrinsic consequence of 
cells expressing the HckCA mutation. When compared with purified CD45+CD11b+ F4/80+ 
TAMs from Hck←WT and WT←WT chimeras, the corresponding cells isolated from 
WT←Hck mice in either CRC model retained elevated expression of Il1β, Tnfα, Il4, Il13, 
Il10, Arg1, Ym1, and Tie2 observed in Hck←Hck mice (Figures 4D and S4D).
Excessive Hck Activation Mediates Tumor-Promoting AAM Polarization through a Non-
canonical Signaling Mechanism
Given the capacity of TNF-α to promote inflammation and tumor-igenesis in the CAC 
model (Popivanova et al., 2008), and the profound Tnfα expression in HckCA TAMs 
reminiscent of the exaggerated LPS-dependent TNF-α production by alveolar macrophages 
(Ernst et al., 2002), we constructed HckCA;TnfαKO mice. Surprisingly, these compound 
mutant mice exhibited a similar tumor burden as HckCA mice in either model, despite 
TnfαKO mice remaining tumor free in both models (Oshima et al., 2014; Popivanova et al., 
2008) (Figures 5A and S5A). Indeed, HckCA;TnfαKO mice had larger tumors than all other 
cohorts, consistent with the notion that increased Tnfα expression may limit tumor 
progression (Craven et al., 2015). However, TNF-α is unlikely to affect macrophage 
polarization in HckCA mice, because tumors from HckCA;TnfαKO and HckCA animals 
harbored both an AAM signature (Figures 5B and S5B).
To further clarify the contribution of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 to macrophage 
polarization in HckCA mice, we impaired intracellular signaling response to these cytokines 
by generating HckCA;Stat6KO mice. Surprisingly, these mice still developed significantly 
more tumors than WT littermates, albeit fewer than observed in HckCA mice and retained 
elevated AAM gene expression (Figures 5C, 5D, S5C, and S5D). While Stat6KO mice 
remained completely protected from sporadic CRC development, the tumor burden of CAC-
challenged Stat6KO mice was attenuated compared with WT mice, consistent with Stat6 
deficiency enhancing tumor immunity in mice (Ostrand-Rosenberg et al., 2000). Thus, 
HckCA myeloid cells retain an AAM phenotype through non-canonical, IL-4/IL-13-
independent signaling mechanisms, and these cells are further polarized in the context of 
colitis and mediate tumor formation independently of TNF-α.

 Therapeutic Inhibition of Hck Antagonizes Tumor Progression in Mice
To translate the findings from HckCA mice to a clinically relevant setting, we first confirmed 
a prominent role for macrophages in Hck-driven cancer by limiting expression of the 
macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (encoded by the Cfms gene) in HckCA mice. 
We then established syngeneic MC38 CRC allografts in the corresponding HckCA;Cfms+/− 
mice, and noted significantly smaller tumors in these hosts than in their HckCA;Cfms+/+ 
littermates (Figure 6A). This coincided with reduced abundance of F4/80+ macrophages in 
the tumors of HckCA;Cfms+/− mice (Figure S6A). Likewise, HckKO mice had significantly 
smaller MC38 allograft tumors than WT hosts, thereby genetically confirming that ablation 
of Hck conferred an anti-tumor effect (Figure 6B).
Next, we exploited the HCK-specific pyrrolo-pyrimidine derivative RK20449, which kills 
stem cells required for the growth of acute myeloid leukemia xenografts (Saito et al., 2013). 
Accordingly, RK20449 also suppressed proliferation of the acute monocytic leukemia cell 
lines MOLM-13 and MV4-11, but not of MC38 CRC cells (Figure S6B), in which we could 
not detect Hck transcripts by qPCR analysis (data not shown). We then treated WT mice 
with palpable MC38 tumors and observed significantly smaller tumors with less 
phosphorylated Hck in the RK20449-treated cohort than in those treated with the 
biologically inactive stereoisomer or vehicle (Figures 6C and S6C). Because RK20449 
administration did not affect tumor burden of MC38 allografts inoculated in HckKO hosts 
(Figure 6B), we surmise that the effect of RK20449 is mediated primarily through Hck 
inhibition in the host.
Pharmacological inhibition of Hck with RK20449 did not alter the infiltration of 
hematopoietic CD45+ cells or F4/80+ macrophages, but reducedtheabundanceofCD206+ 
cells,proliferating BrdU+ cells, and CD31+ endothelial cells (Figures 6D and S6D), which 
correlated with reduced expression of the AAM genes Il4, Il10, Il13, Arg1, and Ym1, but 
minimal effects on the CAM genes Il1β, Tnfα, and Nos2 (Figure 6E). We also observed a 
similar reduced AAM gene expression in HckKO hosts, which was not further exaggerated in 
RK20449-treated HckKO hosts (Figure 6F), and RK20449 treatment did not further diminish 
BrdU+ MC38 cells in allografts in HckKO mice (Figure S6E).
We then used the human CRC cell lines HCT116, DLD1, and SW480, which do not express 
Hck and remained refractory to RK20449-dependent inhibition of growth (Figure S7A), to 
established subcutaneous tumors in immune-compromised Rag1KO mice. After 10 days of 
systemic treatment with RK20449, we observed significantly smaller xenografts in 
RK20449-treated hosts compared with control cohorts (Figure 7A). Moreover, 
tumorsfromRK20449-treated micecontained less of the activated p56Hck and p59Hck 
isoforms, but not of the corresponding phosphorylated isoforms of p60Src or p53Lyn 
(Figure 7B).We also observed reduced expression of AAM genes in the xenografts grown in 
RK20449-treated mice (Figure S7B), consistent with a smaller proportion of CD206+ TAMs 
and Ki67+ proliferating cells in these xenografts (Figures 7C and S7C).

 Hck Mediates Induction of the AAM Endotype Independently of Stat3
While in sporadic and CAC tumors most p-Stat3 remained within the mucosal epithelium, 
we observed limited co-localization between p-Stat3 and Hck in hematopoietic cells (Figure 
8A). Consistent with our observation that IL-6/IL-11 stimulation resulted in a small, but 
significant induction of Arg1, but not of Nos2, expression in macrophages (Figure 8B), 
others proposed that Stat3 can promote an AAM endotype by cooperating with Stat6 
(Stritesky et al., 2011), or possibly through mechanisms that involve the Stat3 target gene 
cMyc (Pello et al., 2012). In HckCA TAMs we confirmed a marked increase in the Stat3 
target genes Socs3 and cMyc, as well as of the angiogenic cMyc target genes Vegfα, Hif1α, 
and Tgfβ, and of the Stat3-activating cytokines Il6 and Il11 (Figure 8C). Because Stat3 can 
also be activated by non-receptor-associated tyrosine kinases (Guryanova et al., 2011), we 
determined Stat3 activity in naive bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). While p-
Stat3 remained comparable between WT, HckCA, and HckKO BMDMs (Figure 8D), these 
cells already showed differential expression of the AAM markers that matched their Hck 
genotype (Figure 8E). Consistent with Hck activity being functionally uncoupled from Stat3 
activity during AAM polarization, we found that inhibition of Stat3, either genetically in 
WT cells or pharmacologically with Stattic in HckCA cells, neither inhibited Th2 cytokine-
induced AAM polarization in WT cells nor AAM polarization of HckCA cells (Figure 8F). 
From these collective observations, we surmise that Hck-mediated Th2-cytokine/Stat6-
independent AAM polarization occurs also largely independent of Stat3.
Having observed a pronounced angiogenic expression signature in F4/80+ TAMs on HckCA 
tumors (Figures 4C, S4C, and 8C), we found more Tie2+F4/80+, as well as Tie2+F4/80− 
cells in sporadic and CAC tumors of HckCA mice than of WT mice (Figure S8A). Indeed, 
the more abundant CD31 staining in tumors of HckCA mice (Figure S8B) suggests that 
excessive Hck activity may increase tumor burden in part by enabling endothelial cell 
expansion.
DISCUSSION
Here we provide evidence for dysregulated SFK activity in the tumor microenvironmentas 
adriver for solid tumor growth. We correlate these findings with an AAM endotype-biased 
expression signature of TAMs, reduced tumor burden in HckCA mice following adaptive 
transfer of WT bone marrow, and diminished CRC allograft growth in WT hosts treated with 
a Hck kinase inhibitor. These functional findings are consistent with our observation that 
increased HCK activity in CRC biopsies correlated with an AAM-biased expression profile, 
a poorer survival of patients with high HCK expression, and our observation that therapeutic 
inhibition of stromal Hck suppressed the growth of human CRC xenografts.
Many immune cells undergo an endotypic change by switching from their host defense 
function to an “alternatively activated” tissue-repair program that promotes tumor growth 
and progression (Qian and Pollard, 2010). Accordingly, IL-4 (DeNardo et al., 2009; 
Gocheva et al., 2010), IL-10 (Lang et al., 2002), and immunoglobulin signaling through Fcγ 
receptors (Andreu et al., 2010) confers AAM polarization. Likewise, mucosal-derived IL-13, 
CD4+ T cells (Pedroza-Gonzalez et al., 2011), and CD1d-restricted NKT cells (Terabe et al., 
2003) also confer TAM polarization. Our observations suggest that HckCA myeloid cells

 promote tumor initiation (resulting in more tumors), In addition, the Tie2 endotype 
displayed by TAMs in HckCA mice, the more extensive vascularization of tumors in HckCA 
mice, and a converse, albeit very moderate reduction of CD31+ cells in tumors of HckKO 
hosts, may provide a mechanism by which Hck promotes tumor progression.
IL-4 and IL-13, as the predominant AAM-inducing cytokines, are overexpressed in TAMs of 
HckCA mice. However, neither expression of the prototypical AAM markers Il10 and Arg1, 
nor the increased tumor burden in HckCA mice, required Stat6, the common signal 
transducer engaged by IL-4 and IL-13. These observations are surprising, since Stat6KO 
mice are protected against IL-4/IL-13-mediated type 2 immune responses (Kuperman et al., 
1998; Stamm et al., 1998; Yokozeki et al., 2000), and suggest that the TAM endotype in 
HckCA mice is unlikely to be mediated by CD4+ cell-derived Th2-cytokines. However, non-
canonical pathways for AAM development have been associated with c-Myc and Stat3. In 
human macrophages, for instance, c-MYC and PPAR-γ expression enhance the AAM 
endotype (Pello et al., 2012). On the other hand, Stat3 may interact with, or substitute for 
Stat6 (Stritesky et al., 2011), consistent with findings that Stat3 activation within immune 
cells is more pronounced in colitis-associated cancer than in dysplastic or normal colon 
tissues, where p-Stat3 and p-Stat6 show a reciprocal relationship (Wick et al., 2012). Thus, 
our results suggest that the elevated abundance of IL-6/IL-11 in CRC (Putoczki et al., 2013) 
may further promote AAM polarization irrespective of the Hck activation status in these 
cells. By contrast, Stat3 activity in the neoplastic epithelium, triggered by CD45+ leukocyte 
and EpCAM+ epithelial cell-derived IL-11 (Putoczki et al., 2013), drives excessive 
proliferation of colorectal tumor cells as long as signaling through the mTorc/rpS6 pathway 
is not rate limiting (Thiem et al., 2013).
Our data suggest a mechanism whereby Hck signaling elicits an AAM endotype possibly 
through its physical association with the Fcγ receptor and the Gp130 receptor subunit shared 
among the IL-6 family cytokines (Crowley et al., 1997; Ernst et al., 1994; Schaeffer et al., 
2001). Thus, the abundantly expressed IL-6/IL-11 cytokines in the tumors of HckCA mice 
may provide an autocrine/paracrine mechanism to prime or stabilize an AAM endotype 
characterized by excessive production of TNF-α, vascular endothelial growth factor, and 
IL-10 (Wang et al., 2010), and which may be further enforced by Fcγ receptor activation in 
response to B lymphocyte-secreted IgG complexes. Such a mechanism is consistent with 
BMDMs from HckCA mice intrinsically displaying an AAM endotype. Furthermore, 
constitutive Hck activity may also short-circuit Fcγ receptor signaling in HckCA;RagKO 
mice to promote AAM polarization and tumor formation.
The extensive sequence similarities among SFK members underpins functional redundancies 
and minimal phenotypes in mice individually lacking Hck (reduced macrophage 
phagocytosis in vitro), Fgr (no overt phenotype in mice), or Yes (no overt phenotype in 
mice) (Lowell et al., 1994; Stein et al., 1994). Although Hck and Fgr only show overlapping 
localization at the cell membrane, compound HckKO;FgrKO mice are unable to clear Listeria 
infection (Lowell et al., 1994), and show blunted recruitment of myeloid cells to arterial 
plaques or to LPS-challenged lungs (Mazzi et al., 2015; Medina et al., 2015). By contrast, 
excessive activation of endogenous SFK results in a lethal autoimmune response in LynCA 
mice (Hibbs et al., 1995) and inflammatory lung disease in HckCA mice (Ernst et al., 2002).

 The latter phenotype can be rationalized by the presence of Wasp, Cbl, paxilin, and other 
Hck substrates in adhesion and migration complexes (Poh et al., 2015), and the capacity of 
Hck to mediate β1/2 integrin-dependent outside-in signaling and to facilitate the formation 
of podosomes (Kovács et al., 2014). However, we note that despite the more aggressive 
growth of tumors in HckCA, the extent of TAMs remained comparable. This observation is 
consistent with reports that the extent of macrophage infiltration is not predictive for long-
term survival of CRC patients, but more likely to correlate with the TAM endotypes (Bailey 
et al., 2007; Edin et al., 2012).
Targeting the genetically more stable cells of the tumor microenvironment, possibly in 
conjunction with therapies tailored against tumor-driving mutations, provides a strategy to 
lessen the resistance afforded by acquisition of mutations in genetically less-stable tumor 
cells. Accordingly, multiple approaches for targeting macrophages are pursued, including 
blocking of tumor-derived factors that recruit monocyte-derived macrophages, inhibiting 
macrophage function, or selectively targeting TAMs to decrease their viability (Germano et 
al., 2013). Conceptually more attractive are manipulations to “re-educate” macrophages by 
reducing their tumorigenic AAM profile in favor of reactivating a tumoricidal CAM 
program. Indeed, recent approaches to block CSF1 receptor signaling resulted in re-
polarization of TAMs toward a CAM endotype, and increased survival in a mouse model of 
glioma (Pyonteck et al., 2013). However, CSF1 blockade may also cause systemic 
suppression of all macrophage endotypes (Ries et al., 2014; Ruffell et al., 2014). Inhibition 
of PI3K γ/δ kinases may also suppress expression of genes associated with wound healing 
and AAMs (Balakrishnan et al., 2015; Kieckbusch et al., 2015), although their deficiency 
distorts T cell development and can cause multiple organ failure (Ji et al., 2007). By 
contrast, our data strongly suggest that targeting of HCK would selectively suppress AAM 
endotypes, while in its complete absence the phagocytic activity of macrophages is retained 
in HckKO mice and prevents the development of detrimental phenotypes (Lowell et al., 
1994). Dasatinib and other approved pan-SFK inhibitors could therefore confer a beneficial 
effect to cancer patients with excessive HCK activity in the tumor microenvironment or 
indeed in epithelia, as a mechanism likely to confer a chemotherapy-tolerant state to breast 
cancer cells (Goldman et al., 2015). The availability of crystal structures for inhibitor-bound 
SFKs (Schindler et al., 1999) should allow for the rapid development of inhibitors with 
superior properties than RK20449.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Study Approval—All animal studies were approved and conducted in accordance with the 
Animal Ethics Committee of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research or the Walter and 
Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. Human colorectal tumor biopsies from de-
identified patients were obtained with signed patient-informed consent and approval from 
the Human Ethics Review Committee of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute.
Mice—All mice were bred on C57BL/6 genetic background and maintained in specific 
pathogen—free facilities at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research or the 
Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Australia. Co-housed, sex-matched and age-matched 
WT, HckCA (Ernst et al., 2002), HckKO (Lowell et al., 1994), HckCA;Rag1KO, 
HckCA;TnfαKO, HckCA;Stat6KO, HckCA;Cfms+/− and their corresponding single allele 
Rag1KO (Mombaerts et al., 1992), TnfaKO (Marino et al., 1997), Stat6KO (Takeda et al., 
1996) and Cfms+/− (Dai et al., 2002) controls were used.
Tumor Models—Sporadic colon cancer was induced by a single weekly intraperitoneal 
injection of azoxymethane (AOM, 10mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 consecutive weeks 
(Neufert et al., 2007). Mice were collected at 16 weeks following the last AOM injection. To 
model colitis-associated cancer, 6 week old mice received a single AOM injection followed 
by two cycles of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-supplemented drinking water (2% m/v,

 MW 36–50kDa, MP Biochemicals) ad libitum for 5 days. The DSS cycles were interspersed 
with two weeks of normal drinking water. Mice were collected 8 weeks after the last DSS 
cycle.
The mouse MC38 CRC cell line was cultured in DMEM and 10% fetal calf serum. Six-
week-old female C57BL/6 mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 1×106 MC38 cells 
into the left and right flanks. The human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines HCT116, DLD1 
and SW480 and the human leukaemia cell lines MOLM-13 and MV4-11 were cultured in 
RPMI and 10% fetal calf serum. Six-week-old Rag1KO mice were inoculated 
subcutaneously with 4×106 HCT116, DLD1 or SW480 cells into the left and right flanks. 
Once palpable tumors formed, mice were randomized into treatment groups. Tumor 
measurements were recorded by an independent assessor who was blinded to the 
experimental conditions.
METHOD DETAILS
Experimental Design—All experiments were performed atleast twice with aminimum of 
three age- and sex-matched mice per group. The specific n (number of animals) used per 
cohort is indicated in the respective figure legends. For RK20449 studies, mice with 
comparable tumor sizes were randomized into treatment groups. Tumor growth was 
measured and recorded by an independent assessor who was blinded to the experimental 
conditions.
Generation of Bone-Marrow Chimeras—Bone-marrow was harvested from the femurs 
and tibias of donor mice by flushing with sterile PBS. Recipient mice were lethally 
irradiated with 2 doses of 5.5 Gy γ-irradiation 3-hours apart, before receiving 5×106 donor 
bone marrow cells via tail vein injection. Mice were then maintained on antibiotic-
supplemented water (Baytril™) for 3 weeks and complete bone marrow reconstitution was 
assessed 8 weeks later as described (Putoczki et al., 2013).
Tissue Collection—Two hours prior to euthanization, mice were given a single 
intraperitoneal injection of BrdU (Amersham Biosciences, 50mg/kg). Excised colons were 
flushed clear of feces with PBS, opened longitudinally and laid flat onto paper-towels and 
photographed. Prior to dissection, tumors were scored according to their size. Tumors and 
PBS-rinsed colons from treatment-naïve and tumor-bearing mice were either snap frozen for 
molecular analysis or fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight at 4°C for 
histological analysis.
In Vitro Cell Line Proliferation Assay—To determine proliferation of cancer cell lines 
in vitro, 105 cells were treated with RK20449 or 0.001% DMSO as vehicle for 48 hours. 
Cultures were then trypsinized and counted with a Countess II Automated Cell Counter 
(Invitrogen) following trypan blue exclusion staining.
RK20449 Treatment—RK20449 and its biologically inactive cis-stereoisomer (Saito et 
al., 2013) were synthesized as described (Calderwood et al., 2002), dissolved in 12% 
Captisol® and administered twice daily (i.p., 30mg/kg) for 7 (MC38 allograft model) or 10 
days (HCT116, DLD1 and SW480 xenograft models).

 Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—Protein lysates from were prepared 
using the TissueLyser II (Qiagen) and RIPA lysis buffer containing protease- and 
phosphatase-inhibitor tablets (Roche). Protein concentration was determined by the 
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Thereafter, tissue homoge-nates were reconstituted in 4x 
Laemmli’s loading buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and dry-transferred 
onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C 
with the indicated primary antibodies, followed by incubation with fluorescent conjugated 
secondary antibodies for 1 hour (refer to Key Resources Table). Proteins were visualized 
using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Densitometry analysis 
was performed in FIJI (ImageJ) as described (Miller, 2010).
RNA Extraction and qPCR—RNA extraction from whole tissues and FACs sorted 
macrophages was performed as described (Putoczki et al., 2013; Thiem et al., 2013), using 
TRIzol (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA extraction on 
FACS purified cells was performed using the RN-easy Mini Plus kit (Qiagen). RNA(2μg) 
was used to generate cDNA with the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit 
(Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR 
analysis was performed on duplicate samples with SensiFAST SYBR kit (Bioline) or 
Taqman® Real-Time PCR Master mix (Life Technologies) using the Viia7 Real-Time PCR 
System (Life Technologies) over 40 cycles (95°C for 15s, 60°C/1min) and following an 
initial denaturation step at 95°C/10min. 18S, Gapdh or ACTIN were used as house-keepers 
and fold changes in gene expression were obtained using the 2-∆∆CT method.
Taqman® probes used were human ACTIN (Hs01060665_g1), HCK (Hs01067403_m1), 
IL7R (Hs00233682_m1), PLEK (Hs00160164_m1), HLA-DQA1 (Hs03007426_mH),

Immunostaining and Quantification—For antigen retrieval, paraffin-embedded 
sections were submerged in citrate buffer and heated in a microwave pressure cooker (pH 6 
for 15 minutes). Sections were blocked in 10% (v/v) normal goat serum for 1 hour at room 
temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in 10% (v/v) normal goat serum and incubated 
at 4°C in a humidified chamber (refer to Key Resources Table). Biotinylated secondary 
antibodies from the Avidin Biotin Complex ABC-kit (Vector Laboratories) was used 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Antigen visualisation was achieved using 3,3-
Diaminobenzine (DAB, DAKO). Images were collected and analyzed with Aperio 
ImageScope v11.2.0.780 software. Quantification of positive staining per mm2 was 
performed using an automated cell counter script in FIJI (ImageJ).
Immunofluorescence—Automated staining was performed using the DAKO Omnis 
system according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For antigen retrieval, paraffin-embedded 
sections were heated in Envision Flex Target Retrieval Solution. Primary antibodies were 
diluted in Envision Flex Target Retrieval Solution and incubated at 32°C for 1 hour (refer to 
Key Resources Table). Fluorescent secondary antibodies purchased from Invitrogen were 
incubated for 30 minutes. Slides were mounted with ProLong® Gold Antifade Mountant 
containing DAPI as a nuclei counterstain. Images were collected using the Zeiss Axio 
Observer microscope.
Isolation and Stimulation of BMDMs—Bone marrow was harvested from the femur 
and tibia of mice by flushing with sterile PBS. Cells were washed twice in PBS and filtered 
through a 100mm sieve. The single cell suspension was then cultured in DMEM containing 
10% (v/v) FCS and L929 conditioned media. To fully differentiate BMDMs, cells were 
cultured for 7 days with fresh media changed every other day. Adherent macrophages were 
detached from plates using a cell-scraper, and cell viability was assessed by trypan blue 
exclusion. BMDMs were seeded onto 6 well plates at a density of 1×106 live cells per well 
in fresh L929 conditioned media. Where indicated, BMDMs were either unstimulated or 
stimulated the next day with recombinant mouse IL-4 (20ng/mL, Peprotech), 
IL-13(20ng/mL, Peprotech), IL-6 (20ng/mL, Peprotech), IL-11 (20ng/mL, Peprotech) or 
Stattic (10mM, Cayman Chemical) in fresh L929 conditioned media. After 24 hours, wells 
were washed with ice-cold PBS and adherent macrophages were detached from plates using 
a cell-scraper.
Isolation of Epithelial and Immune Cells—Epithelial and immune cells were isolated 
as previously described (Rankin et al., 2016). In brief, tissues were cut into 2mm pieces and

 incubated at 37°C in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks medium plus 1mM EDTA with gentle 
shaking. After 30 minutes, tissues were vortexed for 30 seconds and the supernatant 
containing intraepithelial lymphocytes was separated from the tissue fragments and kept on 
ice. These tissues were further digested in Collagenase/Dispase (Roche) and DNase I 
(Roche) in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks medium plus 5% FCS for 45 minutes at 37°C under 
continuous rotation. Subsequently, samples were vortexed for 30 seconds to dissociate 
lamina propria leukocytes from the remaining mucosa, and the cell suspensions from both 
incubations were pooled, filtered and washed in PBS plus 5% FCS for analysis by flow 
cytometry.
Flow Cytometry—Cells were incubated with fluorophore-conjugated primary antibodies 
(1:200) for 20 minutes on ice in the dark, washed twice and re-suspended in PBS 
supplemented with 5% FCS as previously described (Rankin et al., 2016). Flow cytometry 
was performed on the Fortessa x20 (BD Biosciences) or Aria L cell sorter. Background 
fluorescence was estimated by substituting the primary antibodies with their specific isotype 
controls and fluorescent-minus-one controls, as well as using compensation beads and 
unstained controls (referto Key Resources Table). Dead cells were identified by Propidium 
iodide staining and excluded from analysis. Analysis of all experiments was performed 
using compensated data with FlowJo software (Version 10).
RNA-Seq Analysis—In total 622 human colon (COAD) and rectal (READ) tumor 
RNASEQ gene expression data were retrieved from TCGA data portal (https://tcga-
data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). Expressed genes were filtered by a log2 read count per million of 
four in at least 10 tumor samples and further filtered for variable genes with an interquartile 
range of greater than 0.5. Tumor samples were normalized using TMM (Robinson and 
Oshlack, 2010) and split into HCK high and low expressers based on median gene 
expression value. Differential genes were identified using the Voom algorithm within 
LIMMA (Law et al., 2014) and EdgeR (Robinson et al., 2010), FDR adjusted and were 
considered significantly differential if the adjusted p value was < 0.05 and showed > 2-fold 
change in expression. Differential genes were separated into upregulated and downregulated 
gene sets and analysed for significant pathway enrichment against the KEGG PATHWAY 
database (Kanehisa et al., 2016) with adjusted p value < 0.05 using GOseq (Young et al., 
2010).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All experiments were performed at least twice with a minimum of three age- and sex-
matched mice per group. The specific n (number of animals) used per cohort is indicated in 
the respective figure legends. For RK20449 studies, mice with comparable tumor sizes were 
randomized into treatment groups. Tumor growth was measured and recorded by an

•
Abundant HCK in tumor leukocytes of human colon cancer correlates with 
poor survival
•
Excessive myeloid HCK activity results in alternative macrophage 
polarization
•
Myeloid HCK promotes colon tumorigenesis associated with increased Stat3 
activity
•
Ablation of HCK or its therapeutic inhibition limits colon cancer xenograft 
growth

 Significance
Excessive activity of SRC family kinases (SFK) results in the transformation of cells and 
the associated development of solid and hematological malignancies. Here we provide 
functional evidence for the capacity of dysregulated SFK activity within the 
stromatopromote the growth of colon cancerin mice irrespective of coinciding chronic 
inflammation. Rather than modifying immune cell infiltration of tumors, Hck activity 
promotes polarization of tumor-associated macrophages toward a tumor-promoting M2-
like endotype and the accumulation of IL-6/lL-11 family cytokines, which drive a Stat3-
dependent growth response in neoplastic cells. Accordingly, inhibition of Hck activity 
reduces tumor burden in mice, while low expression of HCK in colorectal cancer is 
associated with prolonged patient survival.
