BACKGROUND: The extent to which omega-3 fatty acid status is related to risk for death from any
cause and for incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To examine these associations in the Framingham Heart Study.
DESIGN: Prospective and observational.
SETTING: Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort.
MEASUREMENTS: The exposure marker was red blood cell levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosa-
hexaenoic acids (the Omega-3 Index) measured at baseline. Outcomes included mortality (total, CVD,
cancer, and other) and total CVD events in participants free of CVD at baseline. Follow-up was for a
median of 7.3 years. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for 18 variables (demographic,
clinical status, therapeutic, and CVD risk factors).
RESULTS: Among the 2500 participants (mean age 66 years, 54% women), there were 350 deaths
(58 from CVD, 146 from cancer, 128 from other known causes, and 18 from unknown causes). There
were 245 CVD events. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, a higher Omega-3 Index was associated with
significantly lower risks (P-values for trends across quintiles) for total mortality (P 5 .02), for non-
CVD and non-cancer mortality (P 5 .009), and for total CVD events (P 5 .008). Those in the highest
(.6.8%) compared to those in the lowest Omega-3 Index quintiles (,4.2%) had a 34% lower risk for
death from any cause and 39% lower risk for incident CVD. These associations were generally stronger
for docosahexaenoic acid than for eicosapentaenoic acid. When total cholesterol was compared with
the Omega-3 Index in the same models, the latter was significantly related with these outcomes, but
the former was not.

Introduction
Several recent studies have linked higher blood levels
and/or dietary intakes of the long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFAs) with greater longevity. Plasma phos-
pholipid n-3 PUFA levels were inversely associated with
total mortality rates in the Cardiovascular Health Study,1
and similar associations were seen for this endpoint with
the red blood cell (RBC) content of eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the Heart and
Soul Study.2 This latter metric, called for simplicity the
Omega-3 Index, has been proposed as a risk factor for death
from cardiovascular disease (CVD).3,4 Consistent with
these observations, there is an inverse relationship between
the Omega-3 Index and the rate of telomere attrition, a
marker of cellular aging.5 Although early randomized
controlled trials with n-3 PUFAs found reduced overall
mortality,6,7
other
more
recent
studies8–11
have
not
confirmed such a protective effect. Some of the potential
reasons why recent studies may have yielded null results
for intervention with n-3 PUFAs (background use of sta-
tins,12 short follow-up periods, low n-3 PUFA doses, im-
provements in acute care, etc.) have been reviewed.13,14
In the present investigation, we examined the relations be-
tween RBC n-3 PUFA levels in participants in the Framing-
ham Heart Study’s (FHS’s) Offspring cohort and total
mortality as the primary endpoint, with secondary end-
points of death from CVD and other causes, and of incident
coronary heart disease (CHD), CVD, and ischemic stroke.
Methods
The FHS is a longitudinal community-based cohort
study that was initiated in 1948. Adult children of the
original cohort were recruited in 1971 into the Framingham
Offspring Cohort. The selection criteria for this cohort (and
for the more racially diverse Framingham Omni Cohort)
have previously been described.15,16 We evaluated Fra-
mingham Offspring/Omni participants (n 5 3021) who at-
tended their 8th/3rd examination cycles (2005–2008).
Participants were excluded in hierarchical order if they
were missing RBC FA measurements or relevant clinical
covariates (n 5 122), leaving 2899. We also excluded
399 with a history of CVD (ie, nonfatal CHD or stroke),
leaving 2500 for the present investigation. The study proto-
col was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
Boston University Medical Center. Informed consent was
provided by all participants.
Covariates and mortality outcomes
We considered 18 primary baseline demographic and
CV risk covariates: sex, age, body mass index, marital
status, education level, employment status, health insurance
status, regular aspirin user, prevalent hypertensive status,
use of cholesterol-lowering drugs, prevalent diabetes,
history of CVD, alcohol consumption, smoking status,
physical activity (in metabolic equivalent units), the total
cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio,
systolic blood pressure, and C-reactive protein. Four mor-
tality endpoints were examined: total, CVD [fatal myocar-
dial infarction (MI), CHD death, sudden cardiac death, fatal
ischemic stroke, or other CVD death), cancer, and other (ie,
non-CVD, non-cancer; Note that in the Framingham Heart
Study, ‘‘other’’ causes of death were not specifically
identified]. Incident CVD-related endpoints were also
examined: total CVD (total stroke, total CHD, or CVD
mortality), total stroke (any fatal or nonfatal ischemic
stroke), and total CHD (fatal or nonfatal MI, CHD death or
sudden cardiac death).
RBC FA analysis
Blood was drawn after a 10- to 12-hour fast into an
EDTA tube, and RBCs were separated from plasma by
centrifugation. The RBC fraction was frozen at 280�C
immediately after collection. RBC FA composition was
determined as described previously.17 Briefly, RBCs
were incubated at 100�C using boron trifluoride meth-
anol and hexane to generate FA methyl esters that were
then analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ioniza-
tion detection. N-3 FAs analyzed included a-linolenic
acid (ALA; 18:3n3), EPA (20:5n3), docosapentaenoic
acid (DPA; 22:5n3), DHA (22:6n3), and the Omega-3 In-
dex (EPA 1 DHA).3 The coefficients of variation for
these
were
10.7%,
7.8%,
3.8%,
3.3%,
and
2.4%,
respectively.
Statistical analysis
Sample characteristics were summarized using standard
statistical metrics (eg, means, standard deviations (SDs),
and correlations). Hazard ratios were estimated using the
survival package in R.18 Primary analyses related incident
clinical outcomes by date of event (or censoring) to quin-
tiles of the Omega-3 Index, with follow-up analyses adjust-
ing for demographic and medical history covariates.
Harris et al
Omega-3 Index and mortality
719
 Secondary analyses explored relationships of outcomes by
quintiles of individual n-3 PUFA levels, of a modified
Omega-3 Index that included DPA, and by risk category
of the Omega-3 Index (high risk, #4%; intermediate risk,
.4% to ,8%; and low risk, $8%).19 In other analyses,
we included the n-6 FAs as covariates and also compared
the n-6:n-3 ratio with the Omega-3 Index. Finally, baseline
total cholesterol levels were compared with the Omega-3
Index in the same models to get a sense of how this
emerging risk factor compared with an established one.
All analyses used 2-sided tests at the P , .05 statistical sig-
nificance level.

 and there were more women (57%) than men (43%). There
were 350 deaths during the follow-up period: 58 were attrib-
utable to CVD (17%), 146 to cancer (42%), 128 to other
known causes (37%), and 18 from unknown causes (5%).
Overall, there were 245 incident cases of CVD, 119 of
CHD, and 105 ischemic strokes. (Case and control numbers
and length of follow-up for each outcome are in Table S1).
The Omega-3 Index and total and cause-specific
mortality
We estimated the associations between adjusted risk for
fatal outcomes across quintiles of the Omega-3 Index
(Fig. 1, with details in Table S2). In the multivariable-
adjusted model, death from any cause was significantly
and inversely associated with the Omega-3 Index (P for
trend 5 .02). When comparing individuals in the lowest
quintile of the Omega-3 Index (,4.2%) to those in the
highest (.6.8%), risk was 34% lower. Median values for
the extreme quintiles were 3.7% and 7.8%. The modified
Omega-3 Index (which included DPA) performed no differ-
ently from the original metric (Table S3), and an examina-
tion of the relations between risk and the three Omega-3
Index risk categories found a significant trend across the
categories (P 5 .04), but only the intermediate category
differed significantly from the high-risk category (possibly
because there were 10-fold more subjects in the intermedi-
ate than the highest categories; Table S4). When we
controlled for RBC n-6 PUFA levels in the original anal-
ysis, or substituted the n-6:n-3 ratio for the Omega-3 Index,
there was no material improvement in mortality hazard ra-
tios (Table S5). In neither case did the n-6 PUFAs alter the
n-3 PUFA associations.
Regarding cause-specific mortality, the Omega-3 Index
was only significantly associated with risk for death from
‘‘other’’ (non-CVD, non-cancer) causes (P for trend 5 .009),
with the participants in the first (reference) quintile being at
significantly higher risk than those in quintiles 2–5. There
was a trend for reduced risk for CVD across Omega-3 Index
levels (eg, there was a 61% lower risk between extreme quin-
tiles), but with wide confidence intervals, the differences
were nonsignificant. The results for total and cause-specific
mortality were similar in analyses including all 2899 partic-
ipants (ie, including those with a history of CVD; Table S6).
The Omega-3 Index and CVD outcomes
The Omega-3 Index was significantly and inversely
associated with total CVD, total CHD, and total stroke
after adjusting for covariates in a linear trend analysis
across quintiles (Table 2; P values for trends 5 .008, .03,
and .006, respectively). Unadjusted hazard ratios are
shown in Table S7. The hazard ratio for total CVD was
significantly reduced in quintile 5 vs 1, but for total
CHD or total stroke, no individual quintile differed signif-
icantly from the reference. Similar findings were observed
in the full cohort (n 5 2899) for total CHD and total
stroke, but the relationship with total CVD was no longer
statistically significant (Table S8). Using the modified
Omega-3 Index (with DPA) did not change the pattern
of results (Table S3), and when Omega-3 risk categories
were tested, the general pattern of relationships remained
the same, but they were mostly nonsignificant (Table S4).
Finally, neither including n-6 PUFAs as covariates nor re-
placing the Omega-3 Index with the n-6:n-3 ratio altered
the original results (Table S5).

 Individual RBC n-3 PUFAs and outcomes
The adjusted risk for experiencing the endpoints of
interest by each of the four n-3 PUFAs separately is shown
in Table 3 (unadjusted hazard ratios in Table S9). The
plant-derived n-3 PUFA, ALA, was not significantly associ-
ated with reduced risk for any of the outcomes tested
(Table 3). In general, as the levels of the EPA and (espe-
cially) DHA increased, risk for disease outcomes and total
(and other) mortality decreased (Table 3). The only
outcome that DPA was (marginally, P 5 .059) associated
with was death from other causes (Table 3).
Omega-3 Index vs total cholesterol
In the head-to-head comparison of the Omega-3 Index
and total cholesterol for total and CVD mortality and for
the 3 CVD outcomes, the former metric was significantly
associated with risk for 4 of the 5 outcomes, whereas the
total cholesterol level, in the same models, was not
associated with risk for any of these outcomes (Table 4).
Discussion
In
this
study
of
participants
in
the
Framingham
Offspring study, the baseline Omega-3 Index at about
66 years of age was inversely associated with total mortal-
ity over the next 7 years—with values of the Omega-3
Index significantly lower in those who died during follow-
up than those who did not. The same was generally true for
the 2 components of the Index, EPA and DHA, but not for
RBC DPA n-3 or ALA. Findings for the Omega-3 Index
persisted in a model adjusted for 18 other relevant variables
including plasma lipids and C-reactive protein.
We recently reported similar findings to these in the
Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study where there was a
significant inverse trend across quartiles of the Omega-3
Index for total mortality, with the highest quartile being at
22% lower risk for death compared with the lowest.20 That
study followed a nationwide sample of 6500, approximately
70-year-old women for 15 years. Kleber et al. also found a
9% decrease in risk for all-cause mortality per 1 SD increase
in the Omega-3 Index after 10 years of follow-up in 3259
German CHD patients.21 In the present study, we followed
up 2500 men and women for half as long and found an in-
terquintile risk reduction of 34%. We also found reduced
risk for total CVD events, CHD events, and stroke. The
approximately 50% lower risk for CVD mortality was, how-
ever, not statistically significant, most likely due to having
only 58 events in the analysis (see below). Nevertheless,
these findings are generally consistent with those of several
meta-analyses that all linked higher n-3 PUFA biomarker
levels with reduced risk for ‘‘coronary events’’22 or fatal
CHD.19,23 This study was somewhat unique, however, in
exploring relations between RBC n-3 PUFA levels instead
of whole plasma or plasma phospholipid n-3 PUFAs. But
since these markers of n-3 PUFA status are strongly intercor-
related,24 this coherence is expected.
The causes of death most strongly associated with the
Omega-3 Index were non-CVD and non-cancer, ie, ‘‘other’’
causes. By design, the FHS focused primarily on CVD
outcomes, so details of the other causes of death are
unavailable. An 11% reduction (per 1 SD increase in the
Omega-3 Index) in risk for death from other causes was also
seen in the women’s study mentioned previously.20 It is un-
clear what mechanism might explain this observation; but
since n-3 PUFAs are known to have a wide variety of effects
on cell membrane biology,25,26 a systemic impact of higher
levels of these FAs on overall cellular health is possible.
As noted earlier, several recent randomized trials of fish
oil with total mortality as an endpoint have been null, but
they typically showed trends toward a benefit.27,28 More
consistent with our observations was a 2017 meta-analysis,29
which found a significant 19% reduction in risk for coronary
death associated with fish oil treatment. Two nonrandomized
retrospective studies using governmental databases to track
patient outcomes (one from England30 and another from
Italy31) reported lower risk for all-cause mortality in those
CHD patients who had been prescribed 1 g of fish oil at
discharge. Finally, higher plasma long-chain n-3 FA levels
were strongly associated with reduced risk for total mortality
and CHD outcomes in renal transplant patients in Norway.32

Omega-3 Index and mortality
723
 A somewhat surprising observation in this study was the
low rate of CVD in this population, with only 17% of
deaths being attributable to CVD (as opposed to 42% from
cancer). Part of this is clearly the exclusion from the
analysis set of participants with CVD at baseline, but even
including these individuals, the CVD death rate was only
22%. This relatively low CVD death rate should perhaps
not be surprising given the reduction in heart disease
mortality in the United States over the last several decades.
For example, the age-standardized death rate from heart
disease per 100,000 people dropped from 520 in 1969 to
167 in 2014, a 68% decline.33
With regard to the individual RBC n-3 PUFAs studied
here, in the multivariable-adjusted model, ALA was not
significantly related to any measured outcome in the
quintile analysis. The null mortality findings for ALA
agree with some previous studies,34,35 but higher circu-
lating ALA levels (primarily plasma and plasma phospho-
lipids) have been favorably associated with CVD death,23
and ALA intake was associated with reduced total mortality
in a large randomized clinical trial (RCT) from Spain.36 So,
evidence for ALA remains mixed. Turning to DPA, in the
final model, it was not related with any examined outcome
(although trends were favorable). This contrasts with a pre-
vious meta-analysis in which this FA (again, more often
measured in whole plasma or plasma phospholipids) was
inversely associated with risk for CVD death.23 In light
of this and other prior reports (eg, in heart failure37), the
utility of RBC DPA as a risk marker remains unclear.
Nevertheless, because of the growing evidence for a bene-
ficial role of DPA,38 it is reasonable to ask why this FA is
not a component of the Omega-3 Index. Including it would
be reasonable if adding it to EPA and DHA improved the
utility of the metric in risk assessment. In the present study,
we compared the original and the modified Omega-3 Index
(Table S3) and found essentially the same associations with
outcomes for both. This would be expected since the corre-
lation between these 2 predictor variables is 0.98. Hence,
our findings provide no compelling reason to alter the orig-
inal definition/components of the Omega-3 Index.
We found that the risk of stroke was inversely associated
with the Omega-3 Index, but not in a linear manner, ie,
hazard ratios were reduced only in the upper 2 quintiles;
however, the trend across quintiles was significant. Risk
reduction was largely associated with DHA, where risk was
59% lower in the fifth (vs the first) quintile (P , .05). An
association between serum long-chain n-3 PUFA levels
and stroke risk has been reported previously in cross-
sectional studies.39,40 The impact of marine n-3 PUFA
levels on ischemic stroke may extend beyond the risk of
incident event. Lower plasma proportions of EPA and
DHA have been shown to be independently associated
with increased ischemic stroke severity and, for DHA,
poor functional outcomes at 90 days after stroke.41 In addi-
tion, a higher ratio of EPA or DHA to arachidonic acid in
serum was associated with lower likelihood of early neuro-
logic deterioration after ischemic stroke.42 A 2012 meta-
analysis of 32 observational cohorts and 13 n-3 RCTs
reported inverse associations with stroke and fish intake,
but no significant relations with either circulating bio-
markers or with supplementation,43 although a 2017 study
of plasma phospholipid omega-3 FA and incident stroke
from 3 cohorts found inverse relations with DHA as we
did here.44 A randomized, open-label study in patients

 surviving myocardial infarction45 showed a reduction in
risk of nonfatal stroke with n-3 FA supplementation, and
an open-label study in Japan demonstrated no effect on pri-
mary prevention of stroke but a 20% relative reduction in
recurrent total stroke with EPA supplementation.46 Howev-
er, some studies have found no relations between n-3 PUFA
levels and stroke,47,48 so the n-3 PUFA and stroke literature
is mixed, and more studies are needed.
A variety of exploratory analyses were conducted here.
Given the controversies regarding the CVD effects of the n-
6 PUFAs and the frequent use of the n-6:n-3 ratio, in one
analysis we controlled for RBC n-6 PUFA levels and in
another we directly compared the ratio with the Omega-3
Index. In neither case did the n-6 PUFAs add or detract
from the omega-3 effect. Hence, this study found no
support for using a combined metric with n-6 and n-3
PUFAs. Finally, we compared associations with disease
outcomes for the Omega-3 Index with that of total
cholesterol, one of the most well-known CVD risk factors.
This analysis was undertaken to give some perspective of
the relative sensitivity of these 2 biomarkers. In head-to-
head comparisons with the same multivariable models, a
higher Omega-3 Index was significantly associated with
reduced risk for 4 of the 5 outcomes studies, but cholesterol
was unrelated to risk for any outcome. This may be because
about 38% of participants were on a cholesterol-lowering
medication, and so cholesterol levels at baseline were
therapeutically reduced; because 399 subjects with a
diagnosis of CVD at baseline were excluded; or because
those who were particularly susceptible to cholesterol-
induced CHD may have already died. There is indeed some
controversy regarding the predictive power of serum
cholesterol in older individuals.49 Nevertheless, in the
unique context of this study in which we controlled for
17 other variables, cholesterol levels were unassociated
with these outcomes. Whatever the reasons, this observa-
tion supports the need for further research to more clearly
define the relative roles of traditional and emerging bio-
markers in risk stratification.
The originally proposed (in 2004) clinical cut-points for
the Omega-3 Index were ,4% (high risk) and .8% (low
risk).3 Although these have recently been confirmed in a
meta-analysis including 10 cohorts and over 27,000 sub-
jects,19 it was of interest to explore their utility in the pre-
sent study as well. We found a significant trend across risk
categories for total mortality and significant reductions in
risk for the intermediate group compared with the high
group, but not for the .8% category. This may reflect a
nonlinear relationship between the Omega-3 Index and
risk as has been suggested by others,25 or the fact that
only 10% of the sample was in the .8% category. Never-
theless, the hazard ratio of 0.69 for any death in the .8%
category is at least suggestive of lower risk.
As alluded to earlier, mechanisms that may explain the
associations between higher RBC n-3 PUFA and improved
longevity and reduced CVD risk are not clearly understood,
but there are beneficial effects of these FAs on a variety of
CV risk factors. These include reductions in serum
triglyceride levels,50 blood pressure,51 platelet aggrega-
tion,52 heart rate,53 susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation
(in some settings),54 inflammatory markers,55,56 and plaque
vulnerability57,58 along with improvements in endothelial
function.59 The observation that blood EPA 1 DHA levels
are independently associated with slower rates of telomere
shortening,5 a purported marker of ‘‘cellular aging,’’ is yet
another favorable biomarker relationship, but it is not a mo-
lecular mechanism.
From an observational study, we cannot conclude that
raising the Omega-3 Index will have heart benefits and/or
prolong life. Nevertheless, it is instructive to consider how
much more EPA 1 DHA an individual might need to
consume to move the median Omega-3 Index in quintile 1
(3.7%) to that in quintile 5 (7.8%). Based on a recent dose-
response study,60 one can estimate that it would take about
1300 more mg of EPA 1 DHA per day to do this. This
amount of EPA 1 DHA could be obtained from a single
serving (100 g) of farmed salmon61 daily. Alternatively, 4
standard fish oil pills per day would suffice. Several early
omega-3 RCTs used 800–1000 mg/d and reported reduced
total mortality,6,7,62 whereas other more recent studies at
the same dose have not.9,11,63 Several possible reasons for
this discrepancy have been proposed.64,65
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of our investigation include the relatively
large sample size from a well-characterized community, the
unambiguous nature of the primary endpoint, and the use of
an objective and standardized biomarker of PUFA exposure
that has low biological variability.66 Weaknesses include
the assessment of PUFA exposure at only one point in
time (which cannot capture changes in PUFA status that
may have occurred during follow-up) and the largely
Caucasian
cohort
(which
precludes
firm
conclusions
regarding other races). Also, the relatively low event rates,
especially for CVD death, limited our ability to detect asso-
ciations with this endpoint. Although clearly affected by
omega-3 PUFA intake, other factors can influence the
Omega-3 Index such as smoking and body weight,67 both
of which were controlled for here. What we did not (and
could not) control for is heritability, which we showed pre-
viously to explain about 24% of the variability in this
biomarker.67 In the same vein, we did not include in our
models the intake of key nutrients (kilocalories, saturated
FAs, salt, fiber, etc.), which might contribute to the relation-
ships reported here. However, by controlling for some of
the physiological/metabolic consequences of consuming di-
ets of poor quality (body weight, blood pressure, hyperlip-
idemia, and CRP levels), as well as for socioeconomic
variables (which themselves track with poor diets), it is un-
likely that including individual nutrients would have altered
the outcome of the study. As always, the presence of resid-
ual or unmeasured confounding also precludes inferences
about causality. For example, despite controlling for
Harris et al
Omega-3 Index and mortality
725
 multiple lifestyle/health factors, higher omega-3 PUFA
levels may simply be a marker for a healthier overall diet
and behaviors, which themselves, independent of the
omega-3 levels, may be cardioprotective.
In conclusion, we observed that higher RBC levels of n-
3 PUFAs were associated with greater longevity and
reduced risk for several CVD-related endpoints in this
community-based sample. These findings, in the context of
the totality of available evidence on this topic, provide
further support for a role for the use of the Omega-3 Index
in risk stratification algorithms.
