Background-—The impact of hemoglobin levels and anemia on stroke mortality remains controversial. We aimed to systematically
assess this association and quantify the evidence.
Methods and Results-—We analyzed data from a cohort of 8013 stroke patients (mean�SD, 77.81�11.83 years) consecutively
admitted over 11 years (January 2003 to May 2015) using a UK Regional Stroke Register. The impact of hemoglobin levels and
anemia on mortality was assessed by sex-specific values at different time points (7 and 14 days; 1, 3, and 6 months; 1 year) using
multiple regression models controlling for confounders. Anemia was present in 24.5% of the cohort on admission and was
associated with increased odds of mortality at most of the time points examined up to 1 year following stroke. The association was
less consistent for men with hemorrhagic stroke. Elevated hemoglobin was also associated with increased mortality, mainly within
the first month. We then conducted a systematic review using the Embase and Medline databases. Twenty studies met the
inclusion criteria. When combined with the cohort from the current study, the pooled population had 29 943 patients with stroke.
The evidence base was quantified in a meta-analysis. Anemia on admission was found to be associated with an increased risk of
mortality in both ischemic stroke (8 studies; odds ratio 1.97 [95% CI 1.57–2.47]) and hemorrhagic stroke (4 studies; odds ratio
1.46 [95% CI 1.23–1.74]).
Conclusions-—Strong evidence suggests that patients with anemia have increased mortality with stroke. Targeted interventions in
this patient population may improve outcomes and require further evaluation. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e003019 doi:

Key Words: hemoglobin • mortality • prognosis • stroke
A
nemia is common in patients presenting with acute
stroke. Hospital-based studies have reported prevalence
up to �30%.1,2 Although anemia has been independently
associated with increased mortality in a variety of conditions
including chronic kidney disease,3 heart failure,4 and acute
coronary syndromes,5 observational studies investigating the
association between anemia and mortality in stroke have
shown conflicting results. Early studies found no association
between anemia and stroke outcomes6,7; however, others
have found both low and high hemoglobin levels to be
associated with increased mortality,8–10 suggesting a U-
shaped relationship. Guidelines have been unable to specify
the optimal treatment options for acute stroke patients with
anemia.11
Previous studies were limited by small sample sizes, and a
majority did not report outcomes by stroke subtype. In
addition, no previous study stratified analysis by sex-specific
hemoglobin levels. This is particularly important because of
the natural variance in the normal hemoglobin ranges
between sexes. The literature describes various plausible
mechanisms that explain how anemia could directly con-
tribute to poor outcomes.12 There is a paucity of information,
however, investigating the impact of an important clinical
factor: whether stroke patients with anemia receive fewer
preventative
medications
pertinent
to
stroke,
such
as
antiplatelets and anticoagulants (antithrombotics). In addition,

Impact of Hemoglobin on Stroke Mortality

 there is a lack of data regarding the comorbidity burden in
anemic stroke patients and inadequate control for this in
statistical analyses.
The current study aimed to clarify these important
questions by assessing the impact of admission hemoglobin
levels and anemia on stroke mortality at different time points
up to 1-year follow-up. A systematic review and meta-analysis
were also carried out to further quantify the impact of
admission hemoglobin and anemia on stroke mortality
outcomes.
Methods
Database Study
The study population consisted of 8013 patients with acute
stroke who were admitted consecutively between January
2003 and May 2015 to Norfolk and Norwich University
Hospital, a regional tertiary center in East Anglia, UK, with a
catchment population of �750 000. Ethics approval was
obtained from the Newcastle and Tyneside National Health
Service Research Ethics Committee (12/NE/0170), and the
study protocol was approved by the steering committee of the
register used. Individual patients were not required to provide
written informed consent because this source is a research
database register that included all consecutive patients.
The data collection methods for this prospective hospital-
based register have been reported previously.13 Briefly, the
data were obtained from paper and electronic records,
reviewed, and then entered into the register database. This
was done by the hospital stroke data team and vetted by
clinical team members for accuracy. For each patient
admitted, the prestroke modified Rankin Scale score (scores
are defined in Table 1), as modified by UK-TIA investigators,14
was ascertained from nursing and medical records by stroke
specialist nurses. At discharge, deceased or living status was
recorded to capture in-hospital mortality. Follow-up for
mortality was obtained by electronic record linkage with the
Office of National Statistics data through hospital episodes in
May 2015. For the purposes of this study, the follow-up was
truncated at 365 days for all patients.
The variables included were age, sex, stroke subtype
(ischemic or hemorrhagic), prestroke disability depicted by
modified Rankin Scale score (0–5), Oxfordshire Community
Stroke Project (OCSP) classification (total anterior circulation
stroke, partial anterior circulation stroke, posterior circulation
stroke, lacunar stroke), hemoglobin levels at admission,
comorbidities (coronary heart disease, congestive heart
failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, previ-
ous stroke, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease,
gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcers, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, falls, malignancy,
dementia), and prior use of antithrombotics. Mortality was
assessed at several different time points: inpatient; at 7 and
14 days; at 1, 3, and 6 months; and at 1 year. Results
were displayed selectively in Tables 2 and 3, and data for the
7- and 14-day time points were not included because of the
similarity in results and to ensure brevity. Only confirmed
cases of stroke were included. Stroke was diagnosed using
evidence from clinical features and neuroimaging (typically
computed tomography and, in some cases, magnetic reso-
nance imaging). Anemia was defined according to the World
Health Organization criteria of hemoglobin <12.0 g/dL in
women and <13.0 g/dL in men, and elevated hemoglobin
was defined as >15.5 g/dL in women and >17.0 g/dL in
men.15
The associations between hemoglobin levels and age, sex,
prestroke modified Rankin Scale score, stroke type, OCSP
classification, comorbidities, prior antithrombotic use, and
inpatient mortality were assessed using the chi-square test.
Logistic regression models were constructed to assess
the impact of hemoglobin levels (by quintiles) and anemia on

used to calculate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs).
Sex- and stroke type–specific analyses were performed
controlling for age, OCSP classification, prestroke modified
Rankin Scale score, comorbidities, and prior antithrombotic
usage.
To better understand the potential mediating factors for
the observed associations, we examined the distribution of
selected chronic comorbidities between patients with ane-
mia and no anemia
and assessed the differences in
proportions of patients receiving antithrombotic medications
by a vascular indication (defined as presence of previous
stroke, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, peripheral
vascular disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation). The
analysis was performed using the SPSS version 23.0 (IBM
Corp).

Stroke Project classification, prestroke Rankin Scale score, prior antithrombotic use, coronary heart disease, previous stroke, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, falls, malignancy, dementia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and
peptic ulcer. We also adjusted for International Normalized Ratio in patients with hemorrhagic stroke. The International Normalized Ratio was included as a dichotomous categorical
variable: <1.40 versus ≥1.40. Data for the time points 7 and 14 days were removed for brevity. Mean ages for the male quintiles were 82.80, 80.48, 78.49, 78.09, and 78.38 years for
quintiles 1–5, respectively. Mean ages for female quintiles were 83.04, 81.81, 80.45, 78.96, and 78.06 years for quintiles 1–5, respectively.

 Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
We selected full journal articles reporting on studies that
evaluated the association between baseline hemoglobin or
anemia and subsequent mortality in patients diagnosed with
stroke. PubMed and Embase were searched from inception
until December 2014 using the following search terms with no
language restriction: stroke OR intracranial-hemorrhage OR
intracerebral-hemorrhage AND haemoglobin OR hemoglobin OR
anaemia OR anemia AND mortality OR fatal* OR survival OR
death NOT rivaroxaban OR dabigatran OR apixaban OR sickle
OR surgery OR glycated OR glycosylated OR HbA1C or
erythropoie*. In addition, we checked the bibliographies of
relevant articles for any studies that met our selection criteria.
Two reviewers (R.B. and K.H.) independently screened
abstracts and titles. Potentially relevant studies were reviewed
to confirm their eligibility. The selection and data extraction of
included studies were performed by R.B. and K.H. and checked

 by a senior reviewer (Y.K.L.). To assess study validity, included
studies were assessed for the methods used for diagnosing
stroke, determination of hemoglobin levels and anemia, ascer-
tainment of mortality or outcome subsequent to the stroke, and
the analytic procedures aimed at minimizing the risk of bias from
confounders. We pooled the reported associations (adjusted OR
if available) using the inverse variance method and random-
effectsmodelinRevMan5.3software(NordicCochraneCenter).
The comparisons of interest were for categories of anemia
versus no anemia in patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke versus the referent “normal” category. We evaluated
heterogeneity by calculating the I2 statistic, for which a value
>50%wasindicative ofsubstantial heterogeneity.We alsoaimed
to check for publication bias through a funnel plot if there were
>10 eligible studies in our systematic review.
Results
Database Study
Of the 11 886 episodes recorded in the registry, 3873 were
excluded for various reasons (Figure 1). Overall, 2659 of
these episodes were excluded because of missing data, and
991 were excluded because they were related to secondary
entry into the register due to subsequent stroke. The sample
included in the current study consisted of 8013 patients with
acute stroke admitted consecutively between January 2003
and May 2015. The mean age in the cohort was 77.81�11.83
years, 52.4% were women, and 86.7% had ischemic stroke.
The most common OCSP stroke classification was partial
anterior circulation stroke (33.1%), and the majority of
patients (62.6%) had a prestroke modified Rankin Scale score
of 0. Inpatient mortality was 21.3%, and 1 in 4 patients
(24.5%) had anemia on admission.
Table 1 shows sex-specific sample characteristics by
anemia status. Increasing age, higher prestroke disability,
increased stroke severity, inpatient mortality, and all comor-
bidities (with the exception of hyperlipidemia in women) were
associated with anemia (Figures 2 and 3). Prior antithrom-
botic use in men and ischemic stroke in women were also
associated with anemia.
Table 2 depicts the impact of hemoglobin levels on stroke
mortality by quintiles of sex-specific admission hemoglobin
levels, presented separately for ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke. Quintile 1 contains those with the lowest values, and
quintile 5 has the highest. The cutoff points were 12.40, 13.80,
14.64, and 15.60 g/dL for men and 11.70, 12.80, 13.60, and
14.50 g/dL for women. In men with ischemic stroke, low
hemoglobin (quintile 1) was significantly associated with
increased mortality at all time points measured compared
with those with normal hemoglobin levels (quintile 3). High
hemoglobin (quintile 5) was also associated with increased

hemoglobin levels and short-term mortality in men with
ischemic stroke. In women with ischemic stroke, low
hemoglobin levels were significantly associated with mortality
at 5 time points; inpatient; 1, 3, and 6 months; and 1 year. In
women with hemorrhagic stroke, low hemoglobin levels were
associated with increased mortality at all time points.
Table 3 shows the impact of anemia and elevated
hemoglobin levels on mortality. In men with ischemic
stroke, anemia was associated with higher odds of death at
all time points assessed, and elevated hemoglobin was

(P=0.032). Conversely, in men with a negative vascular

addition, anemia was associated with increased comorbidity
burden in both sexes (Figures 2 and 3).

cohort studies,1,16,20 13 were prospective cohort studies,2,6–
10,17–19,22–25 and 2 were secondary analyses of randomized
control trials.27,28 There were also 2 studies that did not state
the design.21,26 There was a high degree of diversity in
geographic location, with cohorts from Germany,8,19,25 Switzer-
land,16,20 the United States,18,24 the People’s Republic of
China,2,22 Canada,23,28 India,6 Israel,10 the Republic of Korea,9
Denmark,21 Taiwan,17 the United Kingdom,26 and Poland.7 In
addition, 2 studies were conducted across multiple coun-
tries.1,27 Regarding stroke type, 9 studies assessed patients
with ischemic stroke,1,2,8,9,17,20,21,27,28 6 assessed patients
with hemorrhagic stroke,9,18,22–25 and 5 evaluated both types
of stroke.6,7,10,16,26 The number of participants in the studies
ranged from 106 to 3020. When combined with the participants
from the current study, the total pooled study population
included 29 943 participants of whom 24 816 were meta-
analyzed. ORs included in the meta-analysis were from the
mortality time point of 1 year or the closest time point available
to 1 year.
Validity Assessment
Different methods were used for ascertainment of stroke
diagnosis. Imaging (computed tomography, magnetic reso-
nance imaging, or both) was used in 17 studies,1,2,6–8,10,17–
25,27,28 1 study relied on clinical evaluation alone,26 and 2 did
not state the method used.9,16 The methods used to ascertain
mortality also varied. Attending doctors confirmed in-hospital
mortality in 2 studies,24,25 whereas death registry data were
used in 4 studies.10,20,21,23 Telephone interviews were used
by 7 studies, typically in conjunction with other methods such
as outpatient visit, home visit, mailed questionnaire, analysis
of death registries, or review of medical records.6,8,9,16,18,19,22
One study used outpatient visits only,17 and the method used
to establish mortality status was unclear in 6 studies.1,2,7,26–
28 Despite the variety of approaches taken to ascertain
mortality, all seemed reliable.
Eleven studies used the World Health Organization defini-
tion of anemia as hemoglobin cutoffs,2,8,10,16–22,24 7 used
prespecified values,1,9,23,25–28 and 2 did not specify the values
used.6,7 By using prespecified thresholds in constructing
categorical comparisons for anemia, it is possible that cut
points have been drawn up that favor statistically significant
findings.

 Meta-analyses of pooled results showed that anemia is
associated with an increased risk of mortality in ischemic
stroke (pooled OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.57–2.47) (Figure 5).We also
found a significant association for the evaluation of anemia
and mortality in hemorrhagic stroke, albeit at a lower
magnitude of association (OR 1.46, 95% 1.23–1.74) (Fig-
ure 6).The number of studies providing ORs for the relation-
ship between elevated hemoglobin and stroke mortality was
insufficient for a meta-analysis to be conducted. Although
available data suggest that elevated hemoglobin predicts
short-term mortality in ischemic stroke, findings are less
consistent for hemorrhagic stroke (Table 7). The funnel plot
depicting ORs for mortality in anemic ischemic stroke patients
shows asymmetry (Figure 7), with an underrepresentation of
studies on the left side that we would typically expect to
consist of those reporting no significant harm in the
relationship between anemia and stroke mortality. We
encountered 5 such studies that reported no significant
association in our systematic review that we could not
incorporate into the meta-analysis because ORs were not
given, causing asymmetry in the funnel plot.
Discussion
Our study examined the association between anemia and
hemoglobin levels and mortality in acute stroke in a large
unselected stroke patient population and sought to quantify
this association using systematic review and meta-analysis. At
24.5%, prevalence of anemia was high in the cohort analyzed
in the current study. Low hemoglobin levels were associated
with older age, increased stroke severity, higher prestroke
disability, and the increased comorbidity burden. This sug-
gested that outcomes were mediated by the impact of
confounders; however, we found anemia to be independently
associated with mortality subsequent to making the appro-
priate adjustments. A systematic review and meta-analysis of
the literature confirmed our findings. In addition, we found
elevated hemoglobin to be associated with poorer outcomes
in acute stroke, suggesting a U-shaped relationship between
hemoglobin levels and stroke mortality.
The literature has described several pathological mecha-
nisms that can plausibly explain the independent association
between anemia and increased mortality risk in stroke. First, by
lowering the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, anemia may
intensify ischemia and thus hypoxia within the penumbral
lesions in patients with ischemic stroke.29,30 Second, anemia
can compromise cerebrovascular autoregulation, leading to
fluctuations in cerebral perfusion; this alters the delivery of
oxygen to the brain,31,32 thereby exacerbating damage caused
by ischemia or hemorrhage. Third, augmentation of cerebral
blood flow can create turbulence, which can trigger the
migration

 thromboembolism.33 Fourth, anemia may lead to hyperdy-
namic circulation, which has been shown to modulate the
expression of adhesion molecules on vascular endothelial cells
by upregulating their production. This may trigger an inflam-
matory response that leads to thrombus formation in a process
similar to atherosclerosis.34,35 Fifth, anemia may worsen
outcomes in stroke because of its relationship with inflamma-
tory mediators; it can upregulate the production of inducible
nitric oxide synthase and CXC chemokine receptor 4,36 both of
which have been associated with brain damage during
ischemia.37,38
In
addition
to
the
pathophysiological
mechanisms
described, there is also a plausible clinical explanation for
the excess mortality risk in stroke patients with anemia. It
may be the case that anemic patients were less likely to be
prescribed antithrombotics because of the increased risk of
bleeding. This was suggested by a finding shown in Table 4 in
which fewer anemic women who had a positive vascular
indication were on prior antithrombotics compared with those
without anemia. This finding potentially supports the well-
documented differential management of cardiovascular risk
factors between sexes. The reverse trends were observed for

previous
observations that inappropriate prescribing may be more

The association between anemia and mortality suggests
that interventions may improve outcomes. Although previous
studies have shown that packed red blood cell transfusions
reduce mortality at 30-days in anemic patients with myocar-
dial infarction,39 a recent systematic review and meta-analysis
found that blood transfusion after percutaneous coronary
intervention is associated with adverse outcomes,40 casting
doubt on the potential benefits of packed red blood cell
transfusions in anemic stroke patients. Observational studies
reporting the association between mortality and transfusion in
anemic patients with hemorrhagic stroke have had varied
results, with one finding a reduction in mortality41 and
another finding no change.18 To the knowledge of the authors,
no studies assessing the impact of packed red blood cell
transfusion on anemic ischemic stroke patients have been
conducted. Because of the paucity of evidence, guidelines
have been unable to specify hemoglobin targets or optimal
management options.11 A randomized controlled trial is
required to gauge the impact of transfusions and to establish
optimum hemoglobin ranges in patients with acute stroke.
Our study has a number of strengths. The stroke cases were
prospectively identified, and the cohort had almost complete
follow-up using validated methods. Because a large sample
population was used, it was possible to conduct a rigorous
analysis by sex and stroke type, enabling us to provide new
insights. We were also able to control for a diverse array of
confounders, thereby mitigating the effects of residual con-
founding. The meta-analysis included patients from a wide
array of countries, increasing the generalizability of our
findings. The inclusion of a large number of participants in
the meta-analysis provided sufficient statistical power to obtain
results for both stroke subtypes. Finally, all studies included in
the meta-analysis were of high methodological quality.

 This study has some limitations. The small sample number
of patients with hemorrhagic stroke may have contributed to
the nonsignificant P values. Some of the models used did not
fit the data well. Hosmer–Lemeshow tests were significant for
ischemic stroke in men at 3 and 6 months and 1 year
(Table 2). Although this result does not alter the associations
found, it indicates that for this subgroup, there may be other
factors or interactions that might help better predict mortality
outcome at these time points. It is possible that we were not
able to control for unknown factors. In this registry-based
study, we were not able to fully adjust for treatment effect (eg,
blood transfusion, use of iron supplements and erythropoietin-
stimulating agents). Nonetheless, transfusion for mild to
moderate anemia in stroke is not a routine practice, and the
likelihood of such confounding is minimal. We were unable to
consider the duration of anemia or to assess the impact of
abnormal hemoglobin levels subsequent to a stroke; there-
fore, the independent association between anemia and excess
mortality in stroke cannot be described as a causal relation-
ship. The studies in the meta-analysis had high heterogeneity
for ischemic stroke (I2>50%). Finally, the possibility of
underrepresentation of studies that reported no significant
harm in the relationship between anemia and stroke mortality
raises the issue of selective reporting. Consequently, our
meta-analysis may have overinflated estimates of the asso-
ciation between anemia and excess mortality risk.
In conclusion, we showed that a significant proportion of
stroke patients have anemia at the time of stroke onset and
that this is associated with increased mortality up to 1 year.
The optimal treatment option in this patient group is unclear.
Studies are required to examine the clinical and cost-
effectiveness of interventions in this patient population in
an acute stroke setting.
