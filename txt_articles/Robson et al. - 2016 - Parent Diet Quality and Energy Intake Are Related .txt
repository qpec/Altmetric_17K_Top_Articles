 Background—Parents' diets are believed to influence their children's diets. Previous studies have 
not adequately and simultaneously assessed the relation of parent and child total diet quality and 
energy intake.
Objective—To investigate if parent and child diet quality and energy intakes are related.
Design—A cross-sectional analysis using baseline dietary intake data from the Neighborhood 
Impact on Kids (NIK) study collected in 2007-2009.
Participants/setting—Parents and 6-12 year old children from households in King County 
(Seattle area), WA and San Diego County, CA, targeted by NIK were recruited. Eligible parent-
child dyads (n=698) with two or three 24-hour dietary recalls were included in this secondary 
analysis.
Main Outcome Measures—Child diet quality (Healthy Eating Index-2010 [HEI-2010], 
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] score, and energy density (for food-only) and 
energy intake were derived from the dietary recalls using Nutrition Data Systems for Research.
Statistical Analyses Performed—Multiple linear regression models examined the 
relationship between parent diet quality and child diet quality, and the relationship between parent 
energy intake and child energy intake. In both analyses, we controlled for parent characteristics, 
child characteristics, household education and neighborhood type.
Results—Parent diet quality measures were significantly related to corresponding child diet 
quality measures: HEI-2010 (standardized beta [β] = 0.39, p<0.001); DASH score (β = 0.33, 
p<0.001); energy density (β = 0.32, p<0.001). Parent daily average energy intake (1763 ± 524 
kilocalories) also was significantly related (β = 0.30, p<0.001) to child daily average energy intake 
(1751 ± 431 kilocalories).
Conclusion—Parent and child intakes were closely related across various metrics of diet quality 
and for energy intake. Mechanisms of influence are likely to be shared food environments, shared 
meals, and parent modeling.

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that individuals two years of age or older 
consume nutrient-dense foods (e.g., fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, 
lean meats) to promote health and reduce chronic disease risk.1 Despite these 
recommendations, usual intakes from 2007-2010 demonstrated that the majority of children 
were not meeting recommendations for fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy.2 In fact, 
children were consuming large quantities of energy from dietary components targeted for 
reduction, such as added sugars and solid fats.3 Consumption of larger portions4 and 
nutrient-poor, energy dense foods5 have been associated with higher weight and obesity in 
children.
Eating behaviors adopted during childhood have been found to track into adulthood.6 In 
childhood, eating behaviors are commonly acquired through observational learning7 
influenced by the home food environment, which include parent directed child feeding

 strategies.8,9 Parents are considered to be the gatekeepers of food, particularly for young 
children9,10 and have the primary responsibility for feeding their children.11 Thus, a parent's 
diet can be expected to have a substantial impact on a child's diet.12 However, results are 
mixed regarding the common perception that parent and child intakes are similar, and very 
few studies have examined the resemblance between children and their parents' in overall 
dietary quality and energy intake.13 A meta-analysis by Wang and colleagues13 examined 
parent-child dyad studies focused only on total energy and dietary fat and found weak 
associations between parent and child percent energy from fat (r = 0.20, 95% CI 0.13-0.28) 
and energy intake (r = 0.21, 95% CI 0.18-0.24).
Previous findings need to be interpreted with caution due to variability in dietary assessment 
methods and focus on selected components of the diet (e.g., energy, fat) instead of broader 
dietary patterns that may be more strongly related to health outcomes. Diet quality indices 
provide a better representation of overall dietary patterns.14 Dietary intake as measured by 
multiple 24-hour recalls,15 or records have have demonstrated stronger correlations between 
parent and child intake than when using food frequency questionnaires.13
More accurate diet quality data on parent and child were analyzed in the current study using: 
Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010),16,17 Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) 
score,18 and energy density (ED)19. The present study builds upon previous findings and 
uses data collected from a large sample of parent-child dyads to estimate the association of 
parent diet quality and energy intake on child diet quality and energy intake. In particular, 
confounding variables from both the parent and child were controlled for within the analysis 
to allow for a more precise estimation of the relationship between parent and child diet 
quality and energy intake.
Methods
Study Population
Parent-child dyads were part of the Neighborhood Impact on Kids (NIK) study, a 
longitudinal cohort study that examined differences in neighborhood environments in 
relation to obesity and related behaviors among children (6-12 years old) and parents living 
in King County (Seattle area) WA and San Diego County CA.20 Neighborhood physical 
activity environments (PA) and nutrition environments (NE) were assessed using existing 
land use and street network data (e.g residential or commercial uses), food establishment 
data (e.g. availability of restaurants), park observations (e.g. park availability and quality), 
and other spatial data (e.g. residential density) in a Geographic Information System to assign 
neighborhoods to low or high PA scores and low or high NE scores.21 High PA and NE 
neighborhoods indicated a more favorable neighborhood environment for these factors.
From September 2007 to January 2009 parents and children were recruited based on 
neighborhood type (high PA/high NE; high PA/low NE; low PA/high NE; low PA/low NE). 
Eligible parent-child dyads had to: 1) live ≥5 days per week in one of the identified 
neighborhoods; 2) be able to engage in at least moderate-intensity physical activity; 3) not 
have a medical condition associated with obesity (e.g., Cushing's syndrome); and 4) not be 
participating in a medical treatment known to impact growth. Parent-child dyads were

 excluded if the child had a chronic illness known to affect growth; ≤10th percentile BMI for 
age and sex based on parent report; had eating disorder pathology; on medically prescribed 
dietary regimen; or had psychiatric problems that would interfere with participation. Only 
one child per household was eligible to participate and the parent had to be the legal 
guardian.
A total of 8,616 households were contacted, 4,975 were screened for interest and eligibility. 
Of the 944 who agreed to participate, 730 families attended an anthropometric measurement 
visit and provided consent/assent. At the beginning of the anthropometric measurement visit 
the study procedures were described in detail with each parent and child. After addressing 
any questions, written consent was obtained from the parent and assent was obtained from 
the child. Among these dyads, 698 families had both the parent and child having two or 
three days of dietary recalls (on the same days) and were included in this secondary analysis. 
Demographic and anthropometric characteristics of parents and children included (n=698) 
did not significantly differ from parents and children excluded (n=32) from this analysis (not 
shown). The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Seattle 
Children's Hospital and San Diego State University.
Measures
Demographics—Individual (e.g., child and parent age, race, sex, etc.) and household-level 
demographic (e.g., highest level of education for the adult) information was collected by 
parent completion of a questionnaire (available at: http://www.seattlechildrens.org/research/
child-health-behavior-and-development/saelens-lab/measures-and-protocols/).
Anthropometrics—Parent and child height and weight were collected by a trained 
research assistant at the clinic or the family's home (based on parent location preference). 
Weight and height were measured in at least triplicate to the nearest 0.1kg and 0.1cm, 
respectively, using a digital scale (Detecto 750; Detecto DR400C) and stadiometer (235 
Heightronic digital stadiometer, portable SECA 214). Further measurements were taken 
until 3 of 4 consecutive measures were within 0.1cm and 0.1kg respectively. The child's 
BMI was calculated and the value was standardized relative to the CDC 2000 norms to 
determine standardized BMI (z-BMI).22 BMI (kg/m2) was also calculated for parents 
defining overweight as BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 and obesity as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2.23
Dietary Intake—Dietary intake of each parent and child was assessed by up to three 
random, 24-hour dietary recalls representative of both week day and weekend days 
conducted by trained staff over the phone using a standard multiple-pass approach. Recalls 
were planned to occur within three weeks of the anthropometric measurement visit, but the 
timeframe was extended when necessary to obtain up to 3 recalled days. Staff used a self-/
parent-report approach thus, additional resources (e.g. schools) were not consulted. For 
children younger than eight years-old, a consensus recall approach was used with parents 
and children reporting together; children eight years-old or older reported individually with 
parent assistance. At the anthropometric measurement visit, parent-child dyads were given 
two-dimensional food models to assist with portion estimation during the phone recalls. 
Recall data were analyzed using Nutrition Data System for Research (NDS-R) (version 2.92,

 2010, Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota) software. NDS-R is based on 
the United States Department of Agriculture Nutrient Data Laboratory as the primary source 
of nutrient values and composition with supplementation of food manufacturers' information 
and data available in the scientific literature.24 NDS-R uses standardized published 
imputation procedures to minimize missing values.25 Child and parent diet quality and 
energy intake estimates were based on averages across recall days. Overall diet quality for 
both parent and child was assessed three ways: the HEI-201017, DASH score18, and energy 
density19.
The HEI-2010 evaluates diet quality in comparison to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans.16,17,26 The HEI-2010 score is derived from 12 components, including nine 
adequacy components (total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables, greens and beans, whole 
grains, dairy, total protein foods, seafood and plan proteins, fatty acids), and three 
moderation components (refined grains, sodium, and empty calories).17,26 Higher scores for 
each component represent better diet quality with moderation components thus being reverse 
scored. HEI-2010 score ranges from 0-100. The DASH score, which measures adherence to 
the DASH dietary pattern rich in vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy products27 was 
calculated according to Günther and colleagues18. The total DASH score is based on eight 
food groups (grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy, meat, nuts/seed/legumes, fats/oils, and sweets). 
There is a maximum component score of 10 for each food group when intake meets 
recommendations with lower intakes scored proportionately.28 Reverse scoring is used when 
lower intakes (e.g, fats/oils and sweets) are favored. Component scores are summed to create 
the overall DASH adherence score ranging from 0 to 80. Energy density, which is the 
number of kilocalories per gram of intake was also used to evaluate diet quality with lower 
ED reflective of a diet richer in foods high in water and fiber, and lower in fat. Emerging 
evidence suggests lowering ED as an effective means to improved diet quality.29 Several 
methods exist for calculating ED30,31; however, the calculation using food only, excluding 
beverages and water, was used. Intake in grams and energy were directly derived from NDS-
R software and averaged across days for the child and parent individually.
Analysis
Parent-child dyads with at least two days of dietary intake were included in analyses. Less 
than 1.5% of the population had only two days, with the remaining having three days. First, 
paired t-tests were used to compare all diet quality measures and energy intake between 
parents and children. Next multiple linear regression models in Mplus Version 7.3 (Muthén 
& Muthén, 1998-2012) were used to examine if parent diet quality (HEI-2010, DASH score, 
and ED) predicted child diet quality (HEI-2010, DASH score, and ED, respectively), and if 
parent energy intake predicted child energy intake after controlling for parent characteristics 
(sex, BMI, age, race/ethnicity), child characteristics (sex, BMI z-score, age, race/ethnicity), 
household education (no college, some or college graduate, graduate or professional degree) 
and neighborhood type. Unstandardized and standardized beta coefficients were reported 
and a p-value less than 0.05 (two-tailed) were considered significant a priori.

 Results
Parent and child demographics and anthropometrics are presented in Table 1
Diet Quality
Parent diet quality was significantly better than child diet quality in terms of total HEI-2010, 
DASH, and ED scores (Table 2). All HEI-2010 and DASH components scores also 
significantly differed between parent and child, except for whole grains in HEI-2010 and 
meat, poultry, fish, egg in DASH. On average parents achieved 64.5% and 56.6% of the 
maximum HEI-2010 and DASH score, respectively. The percent maximum achieved by 
children was slightly lower, with values at 58.3% for HEI-2010 and 54.3% for DASH.
Across all diet quality measures parent diet quality significantly predicted child diet quality 
for HEI-2010, DASH score and ED (Table 3). The total amount of variance accounted for 
from child characteristics, household education, neighborhood-type and parent diet quality 
on child diet quality ranged from 14 to 17%. In addition, parent diet quality contributed an 
extra 15.2%, 10.6%, and 10.2% to explaining variance in children's HEI-2010, DASH, and 
energy density, independent of the other factors in the models, with these values representing 
the semi-partial r-squared value for the parent diet quality term.
Energy
On average children consumed 1751 ± 431 kcal/day, which was not significantly different 
than the 1763 ± 524 kcal/day consumed by parents. As shown in Table 3 parent energy 
intake (adjusted for demographics and neighborhood-type) significantly explained child 
energy intake (standardized beta [β] = 0.295, p < 0.001). Parent energy explained 9.2% of 
the variance in children's energy intake independent of the other factors in the model, with 
the full model also including demographics and neighborhood type accounting for 21% of 
child energy intake variance.
Discussion
This investigation examined the relationship between parent and child diet quality and 
energy intake, from nearly 700 parent-child dyads. Parent diet quality, adjusted for parent 
and household characteristics and neighborhood-type, significantly predicted child diet 
quality as calculated using HEI-2010, DASH, and energy density. After adjustments parent 
diet quality variables were consistently the strongest independent predictors of child diet 
quality in these models. Similar outcomes were found for the relationship between parent 
and child energy intake. While previous studies have investigated relationships between 
parent and child dietary intake, adjustments have not been made for confounding 
demographic and environmental variables, thus these strong effects demonstrate a more 
precise estimate of the relationship between parent and child diet quality and energy intake.
While direct comparisons cannot be made due to inconsistent measurement and analysis 
methodologies, results from the current study suggest a stronger relationship between parent 
diet quality and child diet quality than that found previously in a nationally-representative 
study. The previous study assessed diet quality using the HEI-2005 based on only two days

 of dietary intake in a more diverse population of parents and children 2-18 years-old.32 One 
explanation for the stronger parent-child diet quality and energy intake associations found in 
the current study may be a narrower age range of children (6-12 years) that were included in 
the NIK cohort compared to a wider age range of children and adolescents in the national 
study. In general, parents have greater control over food choices in younger children 
compared to older children and teens.33 Two studies using the HEI have been conducted in 
younger children and the results are of a similar magnitude to that found in the current 
study.34 Among the prior studies, analyses of father-child dyads found father HEI-2010 was 
positively associated with child HEI-2010 (β = 0.39, p<0.0001)35 and analyses of mother-
child dyads found mother HEI-2005 positively correlated with child HEI-2005 (r = 0.44, 
p<0.0001).34 It is important to note diet quality in many prior studies32,34,35 was derived 
from less than the recommended three 24-hour recalls15 which were obtained from 98.5% of 
parent-child dyads included in the current study.
Several interesting findings about the association between parent dietary intake and child 
dietary intake did emerge. Mean parent energy intake and mean child energy intake were 
found to be nearly equivalent. As parents assisted children with dietary recalls this may have 
influenced energy intake as parents have been found to over-estimate energy intake in 
children compared to child report of their own diet.36 Further, adults often underreport 
energy intake on 24-hour recalls as compared to doubly labeled water.37 Together, over-
reporting in children and underreporting in parents may result in similar energy intakes. Due 
to similar energy intakes, it is not surprising the association between parent energy intake 
and child energy intake was also significant. Previously, the relationship between parent and 
child energy intake was shown to be weak to moderate (r = 0.21, 95% CI 0.18-0.24) in a 
meta-analysis.13
Not surprisingly, our study indicates that most children were not meeting dietary 
recommendations, and parents had better diet quality than their children across all measures 
of overall diet quality and most components of these measures. On average parents had 
higher scores for vegetables, greens and beans, when calculated using the HEI-2010 and 
higher scores for total vegetables using the calculated DASH score. Parents also had higher 
scores, signifying greater adherence to recommendations, than children for the refined grains 
and extra calories components of HEI-2010, and the fats, oils, and sweets components of 
DASH. These results confirm under-consumption of vegetables and over consumption of 
empty calories among children, based on HEI-2010, appear to be major contributing factors 
to their poorer diet quality. While ED (food-only) was included as a measure of total diet 
quality of all foods consumed over a day it may better measure diet quality for individual 
foods (e.g., a piece of fruit, macaroni and cheese, etc.). Energy density scores were 
consistent with HEI-2010 and DASH such that children had poorer diet quality than their 
parents. However, the respective energy density scores of 1.7 and 1.9 for parents and 
children as found in this study would be classified as low-energy dense19, indicating a higher 
diet quality. This interpretation does not appear to be consistent with HEI-2010 and DASH 
findings.
The present study has several strengths including use of multiple 24-hour recalls for both 
parents and children and three different diet quality indicators (HEI-2010, DASH, energy

 density). The large sample (n = 698) of parent-child dyads enhanced confidence in the 
findings; however, they need to be interpreted within the context of the limitations. 
Limitations include the cross-sectional design of the study, a highly educated sample of 
mainly mothers, limited ethnic/racial diversity, and representation from only two geographic 
regions of the US. Future research should investigate the influence of parent diet quality and 
energy intake on child diet quality and energy intake in more economically and racially/
ethnically diverse populations. Lastly, due to the self-reported nature of dietary data and 
parents reporting intake for children <8 years of age, self-report bias could have been 
introduced in addition to the parents' involvement biasing results.38 Thus, it is possible that 
the strong association found could be due to parents reporting for themselves and their 
children.
Conclusions
This cross-sectional study found substantial associations between parent and child scores on 
diet quality and energy intake, independent of demographic, BMI, and environmental 
covariates. Although results might be influenced by parents reporting for both members of 
dyads, these finding suggest the need for research that evaluates interventions targeting 
parents' eating patterns and observes the impact on the entire family's eating patterns.
