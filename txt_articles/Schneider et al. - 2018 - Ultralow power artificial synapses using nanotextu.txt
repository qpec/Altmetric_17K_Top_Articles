magnetic Josephson junctions

Neuromorphic computing promises to markedly improve the efficiency of certain computational tasks, such as per-
ception and decision-making. Although software and specialized hardware implementations of neural networks have
made tremendous accomplishments, both implementations are still many orders of magnitude less energy efficient
than the human brain. We demonstrate a new form of artificial synapse based on dynamically reconfigurable super-
conducting Josephson junctions with magnetic nanoclusters in the barrier. The spiking energy per pulse varies with
the magnetic configuration, but in our demonstration devices, the spiking energy is always less than 1 aJ. This com-
pares very favorably with the roughly 10 fJ per synaptic event in the human brain. Each artificial synapse is composed
of a Si barrier containing Mn nanoclusters with superconducting Nb electrodes. The critical current of each synapse
junction, which is analogous to the synaptic weight, can be tuned using input voltage spikes that change the spin
alignment of Mn nanoclusters. We demonstrate synaptic weight training with electrical pulses as small as 3 aJ. Further,
the Josephson plasma frequencies of the devices, which determine the dynamical time scales, all exceed 100 GHz.
These new artificial synapses provide a significant step toward a neuromorphic platform that is faster, more
energy-efficient, and thus can attain far greater complexity than has been demonstrated with other technologies.
INTRODUCTION
Recently, neuromorphic computing has been demonstrated in a number
of hardware platforms, including modified complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) architectures (1), static random-access memory–
type synapses with CMOS neurons (2), and memristive synapses with
CMOS neurons (3). These implementations have demonstrated signif-
icant improvements in efficiency compared to software neural networks
run on CMOS platforms using a standard von Neumann architecture,
and yet, all of these implementations are orders of magnitude less effi-
cient than the human brain (2). The synapse is widely believed to be
integral for both learning and memory (4). With approximately 1015
synapses in the human brain, it is a critical component of neural
circuitry. Hence, finding a simple, low-energy, artificial synapse is an
important step in making a neuromorphic computer that can ap-
proach the level of complexity of the human brain. The potential gains
from neuromorphic computing have led to intense research in devices
that can mimic the functionality of a synapse (5–12). Here, we dem-
onstrate a new physical implementation of an artificial synapse that is
orders of magnitude more efficient than that of a human brain, with a
spiking energy that is sub-attojoule per synaptic event.
These new artificial synapses are compatible with single flux quan-
tum (SFQ) Josephson junction (JJ) circuits that can provide the under-
lying technology platform needed to scale large neuromorphic systems
(13–16). On the basis of the Josephson effect (17), a JJ can produce fast,
low-voltage spikes of a few picoseconds in duration when the current
through the junction exceeds its critical current Ic (13). These SFQ
spikes have a time-integrated voltage amplitude given by the flux
quantum F0 = 2.068 × 10−15 V·s. With its intrinsic spiking behavior,
neuromorphic SFQ circuitry has been proposed and demonstrated at
a basic level (18–23). A missing component of these neuromorphic
systems has been a compact low-energy plastic synapse analog. Here,
we demonstrate a synaptic element based on a dynamically reconfig-
urable JJ synapse capable of non-Hebbian learning (4, 24). We also
demonstrate the basic energy and size scaling behavior required to
realize a low-power, complex neuromorphic system based on these
artificial synapses combined with SFQ neurons.
RESULTS
In its most basic form, an artificial synaptic element acts to weight the
input and output signals to and from neuronal elements. In the human
brain, this is accomplished, in part, by long-term changes in the quan-
tity of neurotransmitter vesicles and the number of neurotransmitter
receptors (4). For example, a synaptic connection would be strengthened
if the number of receptors in the postsynaptic dendrite was increased.
The artificial synapse demonstrated below is composed of a JJ barrier
that contains Mn nanoclusters and superconducting Nb electrodes.
Each of these clusters has a net spin alignment. By aligning the net spins
of several clusters, we increase the overall magnetic order in the JJ syn-
apse, which tunes the critical current of that synapse. By changing the
critical current of the JJ synapse, we can change the connection strength
between two neuronal SFQ elements. Figure 1A shows a schematic of a
JJ synapse in the strong and weak weighting configurations. The
amount of magnetic order between the clusters is analogous to the
number of neurotransmitter receptors in the biological system.
Superconducting properties of the JJ synapse
To understand the dynamic range of the JJ synapse and thus its
potential range of weighting values, the superconducting critical cur-
rent must be characterized as a function of the magnetic nanocluster
configurations. These device transport measurements for a 10-mm
circular JJ synapse are shown in Fig. 1 (B and C). The device voltage
versus current for a JJ synapse in the disordered magnetic state is
shown in Fig. 1B. The relatively large value of the superconducting
critical current corresponds to a strong synaptic weighting value. The
data (blue circles) are well fit by a standard RSJ model (25), with a
critical current of 1.30 ± 0.02 mA and a normal state resistance of
1.32 ± 0.02 milliohm. The dc voltage measured here is the time aver-
age of the spiking state of the JJ synapse. When the superconducting

 critical current is exceeded, the device leaves the superconducting
state and enters the voltage state, where it starts emitting SFQ pulses.
The bottom inset in Fig. 1B shows a device simulation displaying the
spiking behavior, which gives the measured average voltage-current
characteristic upon time averaging.
The magnetic ordering of the nanoclusters of a JJ synapse can be
increased by applying current pulses in an applied magnetic field,
which will lower the synaptic weighting value of the devices. To in-
crease the synaptic weight, one must decrease the magnetic order in
the barrier, which can be accomplished by applying electrical pulses
in a zero field. The high synaptic weight state (low magnetic order)
of a 10-mm circular JJ synapse is shown in Fig. 1B. The application of a
5-mT static field alone does not change the magnetic order in the
artificial synapse. However, the combination of electrical pulses in
an external 5-mT magnetic field sets the device into the low synaptic
weight state (that is, magnetically ordered) (Fig. 1C). In this example,
the ordering was carried out with 11 electrical pulses of about 4 pJ and
1 ns in duration. In the magnetically ordered state, there is a substantial
decrease in the superconducting critical current, Ic = 0.08 ± 0.02 mA,
while the same approximate normal state resistance of 1.30 ±
0.02 milliohm is maintained.
To scale the devices to a size below 100 nm, the observed change in
Ic and, thus, the synaptic weight would ideally be the result of the in-
teraction between the superconducting and magnetic order parameters
(26), as opposed to the result of a stray field from the barrier on the
superconducting electrodes. We verify that this is the dominant mech-
anism for the change in Ic in the JJ synapses. A JJ with a uniform
barrier leads to a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of the superconducting
order parameter (as measured by the JJ critical current Ic) as a function
of an applied magnetic field (27). For circular JJ synapses in the dis-
ordered and partially ordered states, the critical current versus applied
field data can be fit to an Airy function. Figure 1D shows the Ic versus
applied field data from a 10-mm-diameter JJ synapse for four different
levels of magnetic order. The data are presented in a waterfall plot,
with each magnetically less ordered data set being offset by +0.3 mA
relative to the previous data set. The solid lines through the data
points in Fig. 1D are fits to the Airy function, as expected for circular
junctions. In the most disordered state (blue), there is a shift of the cen-
tral peak of −0.36 ± 0.04 mT. This implies that some overall magnetic
order even in this “disordered” state remains (28). The magenta, black,
and red data show further ordering of the same device. The side lobes
do not fit the Airy function well, indicating that the current flow
through the junction is nonuniform for those applied fields. This is
likely the result of local magnetic order in the magnetic nanoclusters
(29). The reduction in amplitude of the main peak of the Fraunhofer
patterns indicates that the dependence of Ic on magnetic order is due
to the interaction between the superconducting order parameter and
the net spin ordering of the nanoclusters in the JJ synapse. Therefore,
the devices should not lose their wide synaptic weight range when
scaled to much smaller sizes.
Device operation and scaling
A demonstration of apotentialscheme to change thesynapticweighting
via changing magnetic order using electrical current pulses is shown
in Fig. 2A for a 10-mm-diameter JJ synapse. Starting in a disordered state
withhighsynaptic weight, the net Mn nanoclusterspinsare increasingly
ordered using 70-ps rise time and 242-ps duration, 11-pJ current pulses
that are applied in a 20-mT magnetic field. The value of Ic is reduced in a
relatively continuous manner, as is desired for variable weight tuning of
a synapse. We expect that given enough pulses, the trend in Fig. 2A will
eventually saturate to the minimum value of about 10 mA. The slow
variation in Ic with a larger number of pulses will be useful in architec-
tures where the synapse is undergoing online learning and where small
changes of synaptic weight are desired for any given pulse. In the case of
an architecture with an initial training phase, after which the operating
pulses are not desired to alter the synaptic weight, a larger pulse energy
could be used to markedly speed up the process. The energy required to

 change the magnetic order of the devices is more efficient than a simple
joule heating mechanism. In the case of Fig. 2A, if all the energy in these
current pulses went into heating the junction, we would expect a rough-
ly 15-K temperature increase, which is below the 52-K magnetic
blocking temperature of this device. This implies a direct interaction
between the spin clusters and the current, an effect that becomes more
pronounced for the smaller device sizes shown below.
Reducing the size of the JJ synapse should also reduce the total
energy per pulse required to change the magnetic order. This general
size-energy scaling behavior for single pulse ordering can be seen in
Fig. 2B. In the smallest JJ synapses, with an elliptical cross section of
1.5 mm × 3.0 mm, the energy required to order the magnetic clusters
is 3 aJ, excluding the energy required to supply the 20-mT external field.
Note that these synapses operate at 4 K, and thus, a neuromorphic
system based on this technology has an additional cooling overhead.
Typically for larger-scale systems, one can cool 1 W at 4 K using 1 kW
of power (30). Even considering this overhead for cooling, large-scale
systems of JJ synapses with 1018 synaptic events per second will be
more energy-efficient than either CMOS or biological systems with a
clear path to further lower the energy by reducing the JJ synapse size.
It should also be noted that 3 aJ is the energy required to tune the JJ
synapse. The energy per synaptic spike (the mechanism of information
transfer during real-time operation of a neural system) is given by
the SFQ pulse energy ~IbF0 (31). This energy is lower than that of
the magnetic cluster ordering for these JJ synapses. Figure 2B shows the
size-energy scaling for both JJ synapse tuning (red squares) and synaptic
spiking (blue circles). The data in blue are the calculated pulse energies
~IcF0 at the maximum Ic of the JJ synapses (13). We find that both the
energy required to order the magnetic clusters and the operating pulse
energy are reduced as the device size is decreased. It is not understood
why the training energy is reducing so rapidly with the device diameter.
We speculate that it may be the result of nonuniform current density
during the application of the training pulses in the larger devices. The
pulse energy of the JJ synapse sets the energy scale for circuit operation.
DigitalSFQ circuitstypically target criticalcurrentsof nolessthan100mA
because unintended pulsing from thermal energy must be controlled
precisely to maintain extremely low error rates (13). However, in neu-
romorphic circuits, stochastic firing of the JJ elements may be a desirable
property (32), and this opens up the potential to reduce the operating
pulse energy below 100 zJ. In addition, depending on the architecture
chosen, it may be desirable to have the synaptic weights modified using
theoperatingpulseenergy(forexample,inthecaseofHebbianlearning).
Figure 2B suggests that scaling to smaller-size junctions may be a way to
enable this type of synaptic weight training paradigm in neuromorphic
JJ circuits. Using the devices currently demonstrated, one could make a
direct hardware implementation of a neural network where the weights
of the JJ synapses are set initially before operation. Further tuning of the
synaptic weights could be performed during a nonoperational phase.
With additional circuitry to provide pulses with sufficient energy to re-
orient the magnetic clusters, more frequent weight tuning could be im-
plemented during an update step.
Magnetic JJs based on continuous ferromagnetic films designed for
cryogenic memory applications have already been demonstrated with
cross sections as small as 50 nm × 100 nm (26). With the reduction in
Mn cluster size and barrier thickness, we expect that the neuromorphic
technology should be able to reach similarly small sizes. It would also
significantly reduce the complexity of design for neuromorphic JJ syn-
apse systems if no magnetic field control lines were needed to order the
JJ synapses. The orientation of the ferromagnet in a magnetic JJ, for use
in cryogenic memories, can be manipulated using spin transfer torques
(26, 33–36), which allow the devices to attain the ordered (parallel)
state and the disordered (antiparallel) state without the use of external
fields. Incorporating similar polarizing structures in the JJ synapse is a
promising avenue for the elimination of magnetic field control lines
while still maintaining the full dynamic range of the JJ synapse.
Device modeling
Large-scale neural circuits will require the ability to model individual
circuit elements and require layout tools and electronic design automa-
tion for circuit modeling. We have developed circuit models of the JJ
synapses in Verilog and ported them into a version of SPICE suitable
for SFQ circuit modeling. A modified version of the resistively and
capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model (27) was used to simulate
the reconfigurable JJ synapses. The dynamical equations of a JJ, in the
simplest model, are isomorphic to that of a forced damped pendulum.
An SFQ pulse, our synthetic neural spike, corresponds to one revolution
of the pendulum, overcoming a potential energy barrier of IcF0/2p. The
spiking rate is dependent on the energy barrier, the input current, and
the device temperature. One can calculate the Josephson plasma fre-
quency in this model as wp ¼

, where C is the capacitance
of the junction. Using the values for the 1.5 mm × 3.0 mm junctions
demonstrated above, we estimate that the natural frequency of these
junctions would be 170 GHz. This natural frequency would allow for
very-high-speed implementations of neuromorphic systems based on
the JJ synapse.
The dynamical equations of a JJ synapse are similar to those for
a standard JJ, except that the JJ synapse device parameters, such as
critical current, are dependent on the internal magnetic structure
characterized with a magnetic order parameter, m ¼ 1

i, where
mi
→ are the moments of each Mn cluster and M is the total moment
of all clusters. The effect of the magnetic order parameter m should be
governed by the superconducting proximity effect in ferromagnetic
metals (37–39). We would expect that the ordering of the magnetic
clusters should be analogous to changing the thickness of the ferro-
magnetic layer. Thus, the variation of Ic could be quite complex and
nonmonotonic. We expect that with proper materials tuning, we can
fabricate JJ synapses with electrical parameters such that Ic will be re-
duced in an approximately linear manner with increasing magnetic
order. We model this behavior as

where Icv is the portion of the critical current that changes with the
magnetic state, Icm is the minimum critical current in the totally ordered
magnetic state, T is the device temperature, and Tc is the superconduct-
ing critical temperature. In the model used for this work, Icv = 8 mA and
Icm = 2 mA, corresponding to a 10-mA maximum critical current
achieved when m = 0 (disordered state) and T = 0. The magnetic order
parameter varies with the integrated junction voltage as dm º V(t)dt
between m = 0 and m = 1; that is, a voltage pulse across the junction
causes the order parameter to increase and critical current to decrease
up to a saturation point.
The circuit schematic that was used to test the basic neuromorphic
circuit element, demonstrating the functionality of the JJ synapse, is
shown in Fig. 3A. A standard dc bias to SFQ pulse JJ (14) used to re-
present the output of a presynaptic neuron is shown in blue. This JJ

 provides the input pulses for the circuit. A 100-milliohm resistor R1
was used to minimize any flow of dc current from the presynaptic
neuron’s bias source into the following JJ synaptic element. R1 not only
prevents the dc bias current from flowing to the synaptic magnetic JJ
(MJJ) but also breaks the superconducting loop (JJ1, L1, and L2),
preventing the accumulation of the flux in the loop, which would lead
to the eventual stoppage of operation. The flux will leak out from the
loop through R1 with a resistor-inductor time constant. Thus, the max-
imum frequency of pumping fluxons in this circuit is set by this time
constant and can be controlled with Ib1 current. The current parameters
maintain a system balance and operation up to a gigahertz scale. The JJ
synapse element acts to weight the pulses from the presynaptic neuron
(shown in black). Here, we use the variable Josephson inductance (25),
which in the small current limit, is proportional to 1/Ic as a means to
split the incoming current pulse. This synaptic circuit element can then
be roughly viewed as two inductors in parallel, with the current through
each inductive branch determined by the critical current of the JJ syn-
apse. Figure 3B shows the peak current through the inductor L2 as a
function of the critical current of the JJ synapse for an input pulse with
150-mA peak current. The range of critical currents within the blue box
represents the range that we have demonstrated in a single JJ synapse, as
discussed above.
Mutual inductance, with a coupling efficiency of 50%, is used to
couple the pulse from the synaptic stage at L2 to the output stage via
L3. The postsynaptic output neuron is modeled as a superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID). The junctions in the output
SQUID are designed to have a fast response time compared to the
pulse width of the coupled input flux. In this regime, the output device
behaves similarly to a dc-to-SFQ converter (13), with the net coupled
flux bias from one or multiple input synapses serving as its “dc” input.
When the amplitude of the net input flux bias pulse exceeds a threshold,
the junctions in the output SQUID sequentially undergo 2p phase
slips as the flux bias rises above, and then falls back below, this threshold.
In a larger circuit, we would envision multiple synchronous synaptic
inputs coupled to a single large-inductance output SQUID stage (40).
The output pulse produced at this stage could then be further con-
nected to subsequent neural network layers.
Figure 3C shows the output of the three main elements for the case
of a low synaptic weight, which is implemented with high Ic = 100 mA
that can be achieved by disordering the magnetic state. The presynaptic
JJ neuron undergoes 2p phase slips (shown in blue) because its input
current is in the “on” state. Although the phase of the JJ synapse also
shows some small phase variation, it does not continuously evolve and
does not undergo any 2p phase slips. The JJ synapse retains this small-
signal behavior over the course of the input pulse, even when Ic is sup-
pressed, partly because the characteristic response time of the MJJs
increases as their Ic decreases. As a result, no 2p phase slips were ob-
served from this JJ over the entire range (Fig. 3B) of critical currents
tested. The output is shown as the phase and voltage of a JJ in the output
SQUID, labeled in Fig. 3A. Thus, as desired in the case of low synaptic
weight, no phase evolution of the output JJ was observed even when the
presynaptic neuron is firing.
Figure 3D shows the output of the three main elements for the case
of high synaptic weight, which is implemented with low Ic = 50 mA that
can be achieved by ordering the magnetic state. Again, the presynaptic
JJ neuron undergoes 2p phase slips (shown in blue) because its input
current is in the “on” state. The phase of the JJ synapse again shows
some small phase variation but does not continuously evolve because
it does not undergo any 2p phase slips, as desired. However, in this case,
the peak current through the coupling inductor L2 is increased (Fig. 3b)
because the low Ic MJJ has a larger inductance, and the resulting peak
flux bias through the output stage causes an output SFQ pulse. This can

Stochastic modeling
Stochasticity mimics natural brain operation and has been shown to
benefit learning algorithms in deep neural networks (32). Because we
can operate near the thermal stability limit of the JJ synapse, we can
induce variable amounts of stochasticity in our circuits by elevating
the temperature. We define the stochasticity as 1/d, where d ¼
f0Ic
2pkBT
is the thermal stability given by the ratio of the spiking energy barrier
to the thermal energy. Here, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the
temperature in kelvins. For stochasticity values of less than one, the dy-
namics are basically deterministic, whereas when the stochasticity is
greater than one, there is a significant stochastic component. Given
the large nonlinear variation of Ic, with temperature near the supercon-
ducting critical temperature Tc, we can expect to be able to vary 1/d over
a wide range by adjusting the temperature over just a few degrees, there-
by controlling the amount of stochasticity in the neural circuit. We find
that there is a smooth nonlinear variation of the Ic as a function of tem-
perature in the partially ordered state of a 10-mm JJ synapse, as shown in
Fig. 4A. On the right axis of Fig. 4A, we plot 1/d for a simulated device
with a diameter of 100 nm to show the large range of potentially avail-
able stochasticity in smaller devices.
To investigate the potential advantages of stochastic neuromorphic
SFQ circuits, we have developed a SPICE model that includes thermal
fluctuations. Specifically, an additional current branch is added to our
modified RCSJ model to account for “white noise” current fluctuations.
Theoretically, the thermal fluctuations have constant power spectral
density, given by the Johnson-Nyquist formula as SIð f Þ ¼ 4kBT
RN . As the
thermal stability ratio d becomes smaller, the probability for a JJ to
temporarily bias into the voltage state and emit an SFQ pulse becomes
larger.
Figure 4B shows a block diagram of the circuit that we modeled to
understand the influence of thermal noise on JJ synapses. In these simu-
lations, the magnetic order parameter varies from m = 0 to m = 1 within
100 SFQ voltage pulses, and we monitor the spiking rate output by a JJ
synapse. Given a certain input current, a reconfigurable JJ synapse will
generate SFQ voltage spikes at a rate nonlinearly dependent on Ic, which
is dependent on the history of input spikes, the input current, and device
temperature (41). The JJsynapse circuit, shown in Fig.4B, wassimulated
at two different temperatures using the same input spike stream to show
the effects of stochasticity and the dynamically reconfigurable magnetic
order. At 2 K, there is no significant change in output spiking of the
simulated circuit (Fig. 4C), and the simulated magnetic order parameter
does not change significantly. Increasing the simulated temperature
to 3 K and, thus, the stochastic energy in the JJ synapse, significantly
changes both the magnetic order parameter and the output voltage
spiking (Fig. 4D). In this case, the magnetic order parameter increases
as it accumulates incoming spikes, which leads to more spiking activity
out of the JJ synapse for the same initial input spike train.
DISCUSSION
A new type of dynamically tunable JJ has been demonstrated with
potentialapplicationasasyntheticsynapticelementforsuperconducting
neuromorphic computing. In these devices, the JJ critical current, in
a zero applied magnetic field, can be varied in an analog manner.

 been extensively demonstrated (26, 35, 42, 43), to our knowledge, re-
producible zero-field analog control has not previously been shown.
The device behaves naturally as an artificial synapse that can interact
with low-energy electrical pulses. There are potentially other appli-
cations of these novel JJs. For example, the low energy involved in
changing the order of the magnetic clusters makes this barrier an ex-
cellent candidate for cryogenic memory applications, possibly as the
magnetic free-layer material in a pseudospin-valve magnetic JJ. In ad-
dition, because of their natural spiking behavior, these devices could
be used as integrate and fire neurons.
The device demonstrated here requires an external magnetic field to
order the magnetic nanoclusters in the JJ synapse. One physical imple-
mentation would be to lithographically pattern magnetic field control
lines above the JJ synapses. This type of implementation should work up
to considerable scale, as evidenced by field-switched magnetic random-
accessmemoryproductscurrentlyavailablewithmorethan1.6×107bits
per chip (44). However, implementations without additionalfield con-
trol lines would allow an even better scaling. It has previously been
demonstrated that spin transfer torques can be used to switch a mag-
netically soft layer in a two-state JJ with a magnetic pseudospin-valve
barrier (26, 35). Similar spin-polarizing layers should also allow for the
elimination of a field control line in future JJ synapses. In addition, if
the energy required to reorder the magnetic clusters is on the order of
the SFQ pulse energy, then the JJ synapses will be capable of Hebbian
learning (24). The scaling of pulse energy with device size appears to
be a promising path toward realizing magnetic cluster reordering
energy that will be on the order of the SFQ pulse energy.
One of the significant advantages of this system is its ability to
leverage existing digital SFQ JJ logic infrastructure. Digital SFQ circuits
have been demonstrated with more than 105 JJs (45). In addition, be-
cause of their superconducting nature, SFQ circuits can have so-called
ballistic communications, both on-chip and chip-to-chip, with data
transmission rates demonstrated up to 60 gigabits/s (46–48). The
main advantage is that the transmission of SFQ pulses is not limited
by the typical capacitive charging, which semiconductor electronics typ-
ically face. In addition, there is very little energy cost in transmitting the
pulses along superconducting wires/transmission lines (30), and zero
static dissipation SFQ circuits have recently been demonstrated (49).
This results in the main energy dissipation mechanism as the pulse gen-
eration itself. For example, in our basic circuit element in Fig. 3, the
energy dissipated for a presynaptic spike, followed by the synaptic
weighting and output spike (if the synaptic weight is above threshold),
would be ~3 IbF0 ~ 1 aJ. The main additional cost is cooling to 4 K,
which, for large-scale systems, is ~1000, bringing the energy required
for this operation up to ~1 fJ. There would be an additional cost for
supplying the bias currents, but these currents could be shared within
each layer because they are not the tunable element. The high-speed
communications could be combined with one of the many neuro-
morphic interconnect strategies that have been developed in CMOS,
such as matrix-vector multipliers combined with thresholding (50), tree
routing (51), or self-timing (52). Leveraging of fabrication tools and
techniques that have been developed for CMOS and modified for both
commercial magnetoresistive random-access memory and large-scale
digital SFQ logic should greatly accelerated the progress of neuro-
morphic circuits using JJ neurons and JJ synapses. However, we should
note that, although the demonstrated device and the circuit modeling
are quite promising, considerable work remains to demonstrate a large
neuromorphic architecture with complex layout and routing using this
new technology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The devices were measured in a liquid He flow cryogenic probe station
with a base temperature of 3.9 K and a stability of ±5 mK. The chips
were thermally heat-sunk to the cold stage with an In0.51Bi0.325Sb0.165
alloy. High-speed pulses were provided via microwave cables and
ground-signal-ground probes. The voltage and pulse durations were
taken to be the geometric mean of the pulse reduction and pulse
stretching that occurred when two high-speed probes were connected
via a 50-ohm impedance connection (at 4 K) using nominally identical
lines on both sides. This was compared to the pulse output connected
directly to a high-speed oscilloscope to determine the calibration factor,
which was a 0.504 reduction in voltage and a lengthening to 242 ps
for a nominal 100-ps input pulse. The current of the pulse was as-
sumed to be that of a 50-ohm load driving a short (that is, the current
was about twice that of the equivalent voltage driving a 50-ohm load).
The measured device resistances varied from 1 to 100 milliohms. Given
that the devices have nonzero resistance, the values quoted in the main
text represent upper bounds on the currents and, thus, the energies that
were calculated.
Defluxing of superconducting circuits prevents trapped flux due to
persistent current loops that can distort the measurements. To remove
this potentially trapped flux, the circuits were heated to 9.5 K for 2 min,
above the superconducting critical temperature of the junctions and the
Nb wiring, and then returned to 4 K for 3 min before measurement. The
junction critical current was confirmed to be stable after the 3-min
cooling wait time. Defluxing was performed after all major changes,
such as contacting a device, and after any pulse larger than 100 pJ that
occurred in the measurement. The critical current was confirmed to
be the same before and after current pulses of less than 100 pJ before
pulse experiments. In addition, defluxing was also implemented after
any field ramping other than in the direct Fraunhofer patterns. Field
ramps to 20 mT and back were confirmed not to change the value of
Ic without the addition of a current pulse. In neuromorphic applica-
tions, all of the signal and training pulses are expected to be <<100 pJ,
and any magnetic fields would be applied locally with a field control
line, alleviating any need for in operando defluxing.
Magnetic barrier properties
Control of the magnetic cluster size allows one to vary the amount
of energy required to adjust the weight of the artificial synapse.

 With postdeposition annealing (41) or by varying the Si-Mn super-
lattice spacing, one can tune the cluster size from a large number of
net spins per cluster to a small number of net spins per cluster. Char-
acterization of the clustering was carried out on blanket film stacks
using a SQUID magnetometer. The blocking temperature is the tem-
perature below which the net magnetic moments stop fluctuating on
the time scale of the magnetometry measurements and give a measure
of the magnetic anisotropy energy (Fig. 5A). The magnetic anisotropy
energy is the energy required to reorient the spin clusters and determines
how easy it is to reconfigure the magnetic order of the JJ synapses. The
blocking temperature is approximated as the point in the graph (Fig.
5A) where there is a maximum in the zero field–cooled magnetic
moment. This temperature also corresponds to the point in the field-
cooling curve where measured magnetic moments starts to increase with
decreasing temperature, which signifies the increase in the net mag-
netic order (53). All of the magnetic JJ synapses presented here were
fabricated by sputter deposition of Nb70(Si0.6Mn0.5) × 3Si0.6Nb70,
where the thicknesses are in nanometers. After deposition, the blanket
films were annealed at 400°C for 10 min in an atmosphere of 5% H in
95% Ar and were subsequently patterned using optical lithography.
One die from the device wafer was left unpatterned and was used
to characterize the nanoclusters using a SQUID magnetometer. Figure
5A shows the field- and zero field–cooled data from this witness die.
We found that the blocking temperature of our JJ synapses was 52 ±
2 K. The size of the Mn nanoclusters can be estimated by measuring
the magnetic moment versus applied magnetic field in the paramagnetic
limit, above the blocking temperature (54). Figure 5B shows magnetic
moment versus applied field data taken on the same witness die at a
temperature of 70 K. We fit the data (blue circles) to the Langevin func-
tions (red line), estimating 2 × 104 Mn clusters/mm2, with each cluster
having 2000 ± 100 mB, where mB is the Bohr magneton. By reducing the
cluster size, there is a clear path for reducing the pulse energy required
to order/disorder the JJ synapses.
