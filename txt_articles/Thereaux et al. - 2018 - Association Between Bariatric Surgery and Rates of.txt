IMPORTANCE Few large-scale long-term prospective cohort studies have assessed changes in
antidiabetes treatment after bariatric surgery.
OBJECTIVE To describe the association between bariatric surgery and rates of continuation,
discontinuation, or initiation of antidiabetes treatment 6 years after bariatric surgery
compared with a matched control obese group.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This nationwide observational population-based cohort
study extracted health care reimbursement data from the French national health insurance
database from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2015. All patients undergoing primary
bariatric surgery in France between January 1 and December 31, 2009, were matched on age,
sex, body mass index category, and antidiabetes treatment with control patients hospitalized
for obesity in 2009 with no bariatric surgery between 2005 and 2015.
EXPOSURES Bariatric surgery, including adjustable gastric banding (AGB), gastric bypass
(GBP), and sleeve gastrectomy (SG).
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Reimbursement for antidiabetes drugs. Mixed-effects logistic
regression models estimated factors of discontinuation or initiation of antidiabetes treatment
over a period of 6 years.
RESULTS In 2009, a total of 15 650 patients (mean [SD] age, 38.9 [11.2] years; 84.6% female;
1633 receiving antidiabetes treatment) underwent primary bariatric surgery, with 48.5%
undergoing AGB, 27.7% undergoing GBP, and 22.0% undergoing SG. Among patients
receiving antidiabetes treatment at baseline, the antidiabetes treatment discontinuation rate
was higher 6 years after bariatric surgery than in controls (−49.9% vs −9.0%, P < .001). In
multivariable analysis, the main predictive factors for discontinuation were the following:
GBP (odds ratio [OR], 16.7; 95% CI, 13.0-21.4), SG (OR, 7.30; 95% CI, 5.50-9.50), and AGB
(OR, 4.30; 95% CI, 3.30-5.60) compared with no bariatric surgery, as well as insulin use (OR,
0.17; 95% CI, 0.13-0.22), dual therapy without insulin (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.32-0.45) vs
monotherapy, lipid-lowering treatment (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.91), antidepressant
treatment (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55-0.81), and age (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.97) per year. For
patients without antidiabetes treatment at baseline, the 6-year antidiabetes treatment
initiation rate was much lower after bariatric surgery than in controls (1.4% vs 12.0%,
P < .001). In multivariable analysis, protective factors were GBP (OR, 0.06; 95% CI,
0.04-0.09), SG (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.06-0.11), and AGB (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.14-0.20) vs
controls, and risk factors were as follows: body mass index category (OR, 2.04; 95% CI,
1.68-2.47 for �50.0 vs 30.0-39.9 and OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.49-1.90 for 40.0-49.9 vs
30.0-39.9), antihypertensive treatment (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.33-1.67), low income (OR, 1.43;
95 % CI, 1.26-1.62), and age (OR, 1.04; 95 % CI, 1.03-1.05) per year.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Bariatric surgery was associated with a significantly higher
6-year postoperative antidiabetes treatment discontinuation rate compared with baseline
and with an obese control group without bariatric surgery.

Methods
The French National Health Insurance Database
The SNIIRAM database covers the entire French population
(64.3millioninhabitantsin2009),includinglow-incomepatients
eligiblefor100%coveragewithCouvertureMaladieUniverselle.
Since 2005, the database contains comprehensive data on all
reimbursementsforhealth-relatedexpenditure,aswellasdemo-
graphic data and medical information on all admissions to
Frenchpublicandprivatehospitals(accordingtotheInternational
StatisticalClassificationofDiseases,10thRevision[ICD-10]).These
data are used to refund outpatient medical expenditure to the
population, as well as the cost of hospital stays to public and
private hospitals.
TheSNIIRAMisoneofthelargestdatabasesintheworldand
hasbeenextensivelyusedtoguidepublichealthpoliciesinFrance
becausethesedataallowsystematicfollow-upofallmedicalcare
receivedinFrance,includingforlow-incomepeople.26,27Several
studies28-30 onbariatricsurgeryinFrancehavebeenpreviously
published.
Analyses of the SNIIRAM database for the present study
were approved by the French personal data protection agency
(Commission Nationale Informatique et Libertés). No other
ethical approval or informed patient consent was required
because this database is anonymous and all analyses were
performed by French national health insurance staff.
Population and Matching Process
All patients undergoing primary bariatric surgery in France be-
tweenJanuary1,2009,andDecember31,2009(bariatricsurgery
group), were identified and classified based on the type of pro-
cedureperformedin2009(AGB,GBP,SG,andothers,suchasbil-
iopancreatic diversion with or without duodenal switch) based
on hospital coding for bariatric surgery (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). Patients with a previous coding for bariatric surgery or a
revisional procedure during 2005 to 2008 were excluded.
During the same period (January 1, 2009, to December 31,
2009), all patients hospitalized with an ICD-10 code of obesity
(eTable 1 in the Supplement) were identified. An obese control
groupincludedpatientswithnohistoryofbariatricsurgerydur-
ing 2005 to 2015, as well as no cancer, pregnancy, chronic in-
fectious disease, or serious acute or chronic disease, such as
pulmonary embolism or heart failure, in 2008 to 2009.
Patientswithobesitywithorwithoutbariatricsurgerywith
no health care reimbursement (medical visit, treatment, labo-
ratorytests,hospitalization,etc)foreachofthe6follow-upyears
during 2010 to 2015 were also excluded. Those patients were
likelytohavebeenoutofthecountryduringthattimeortohave
voluntarily opted out of national health insurance and would
thusbelikelytohavepooradherencetotherecommendedbar-
iatric surgery or obesity follow-up and treatment.
Patients in the bariatric surgery group were then matched
1:1onage(±5years),sex,bodymassindex(calculatedasweight
inkilogramsdividedbyheightinmeterssquared)category,and
antidiabetes treatment at baseline with control patients hos-
pitalized for obesity in 2009 with no bariatric surgery be-
tween 2005 and 2015. Several bariatric surgery patients could
be matched to the same control patient.
Data Collection and Definitions
Data were extracted from the SNIIRAM database from Janu-
ary 1, 2008, to December 31, 2015. Patient follow-up was es-
tablished on the basis of 12-month data, with the shortest
follow-up being from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2014,
Key Points
Question What are the rates of discontinuation or initiation of
antidiabetes treatment 6 years after bariatric surgery?
Findings In this nationwide population-based cohort study of
more than 30 000 adults, bariatric surgery was associated with a
significantly higher 6-year postoperative antidiabetes treatment
discontinuation rate compared with an obese control group, as
well as with a low antidiabetes treatment initiation rate, with
gastric bypass being the most effective procedure.
Meaning Patients and physicians should be aware that morbid
obesity remains a chronic disease even after bariatric surgery
because 50.1% of patients with preexisting antidiabetes treatment
remained on treatment 6 years after surgery.

 and the longest follow-up being from December 31, 2008, to
December 30, 2015.
Age and sex were obtained from the SNIIRAM database.
Body mass index (BMI) was not reported in outpatient data but
was available at the time of hospitalization based on the fol-
lowing 3 categories: 30.0 to 39.9, 40.0 to 49.9, and 50.0 or
higher. Precarity was evaluated using 2 variables, including
universal health insurance coverage for low-income families
(Couverture Maladie Universelle) and a validated geographic
socioeconomic deprivation index (Indice Géographique de
Défavorisation).31
Medications were identified by reimbursements as those
treatments not available over the counter and directly paid by
health insurance when dispensed to the patient by a pharmacy.
Medications were classified based on Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemicalcode,describedonlinebytheWorldHealthOrganiza-
tion (http://www.whocc.no) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). For
the purposes of this study, we considered patients to be treated
withantidiabetesdrugs(includinginsulin)throughouttheyear
when they received at least 3 drug reimbursements at different
times over a 12-month period. Antidiabetes treatments were
stratified into the following 3 exclusive categories based on the
last4monthsoftheyeartoreducetheriskofcountingswitches
asmultipletherapies:monotherapywithoutinsulin,dualtherapy
or triple therapy without insulin, and insulin therapy (with or
without other antidiabetes drugs). The baseline (preoperative)
year used to describe clinical characteristics and medication
reimbursementswasdefinedastheyearbeforebariatricsurgery.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using a software program
(SAS, version 9.3; SAS Institute). The samples were described
in terms of covariates and comparisons between bariatric sur-
gery and control patients that were performed using χ2 test for
categorical variables and t test for continuous variables.
The timing of antidiabetes treatment discontinuation and
initiation was determined for each major bariatric procedure
(AGB, GBP, and SG) and for the control group using Kaplan-
Meier plots. Data were compared using log-rank test.

antidiabetes treatment) of patients with at least 1 antidiabetes
treatmentforatleast1yearoffollow-up.Asoftwareprogram(R,
version 3.3.1; R Project for Statistical Computing) was used.
To assess changes in antidiabetes treatment during follow-
up, generalized linear mixed modeling approaches were used
to account for repeated measures and within-individual corre-
lations. Mixed-effects logistic regression models with robust
error variance were used to estimate (1) discontinuation of an-
tidiabetes treatment among patients with antidiabetes treat-
ment at baseline and (2) initiation of antidiabetes treatment
among patients without antidiabetes treatment at baseline.

Baseline Characteristics
Between January 1 and December 31, 2009, a total of 18 477 pa-
tientsunderwentbariatricsurgeryinFrance,and15650ofthese
patientswereincludedinourstudyafterexcluding2827patients

operativeyears(n = 2618).Excludedpatientswereyounger(mean
[SD] age, 33.5 [11.8] vs 38.9 [11.2] years; P < .001) and had fewer
coexisting conditions (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Overall,AGB(48.5%)wasthemostcommonprocedureper-
formed in the 15 650 bariatric surgery patients included in the
study, ahead of GBP (27.7%), SG (22.0%), and other proce-
dures (1.8%) (Table 1). Gastric bypass was the most common
procedure (P < .001) performed in the subgroup of 1633 bar-
iatric surgery patients with antidiabetes treatment at base-
line (493 [30.2%] AGB, 655 [40.1%] GBP, 433 [26.5%] SG, and
52 [3.2%] others) and in the subgroup of 330 bariatric surgery
insulin users (83 [25.2%] AGB, 137 [41.5%] GBP, 100 [30.3%]
SG, and 10 [3.0%] others).
By design, the bariatric surgery and control groups were
similar in terms of age (mean [SD] age, 38.9 [11.2] vs 39.4 [11.2]
years; not significant), proportion of women (13 241 [84.6%]),
BMI between 40.0 and 49.9 (9335 [59.6%]), and antidiabetes
treatment(1633[10.4%]).However,patientsinthebariatricsur-
gery group were less likely to have lower rates of antihyperten-
sive (24.1% vs 27.5%, P < .001), lipid-lowering (10.6% vs 12.1%,
P < .001), anxiolytic (10.5% vs 14.4%, P < .001), and opioid
(20.1% vs 24.1%, P < .001) treatments but had a similar rate of
antidepressanttreatmentatbaseline.Amongpatientswithbase-
line antidiabetes treatment, metformin was the most common
treatmentinboththebariatricsurgeryandcontrolgroups(91.7%
vs 91.0%, P > .05). Table 1 lists baseline characteristics and
details about receiving antidiabetes treatment at baseline.
Changes in Antidiabetes Treatment
Discontinuation of Antidiabetes Treatment
During the 6-Year Follow-up
Among patients receiving antidiabetes treatment at baseline,
the rate of antidiabetic use at 6 years had decreased markedly
in the bariatric surgery group compared with the control group
(−49.9% vs −9.0%, P < .001). The rate of insulin use also de-
creased considerably in the bariatric surgery group with anti-
diabetes treatment at baseline but increased in the control
group (−40.0% vs 119.8%, P < .001). Figure 1A shows Kaplan-
Meier plots of the 6-year cumulative discontinuation of anti-
diabetestreatmentinpatientswhohadundergonebariatricsur-
gery in 2009 and in controls for patients with antidiabetes
treatment at baseline (3266 overall).
During follow-up, 30.9% (n = 2348) of the 7592 patients
who had undergone AGB at baseline subsequently under-
went a revision procedure, including band removal in 41.4%,
conversion to SG in 31.2%, GBP in 19.9%, AGB in 7.4%, and an-
other procedure in 0.1%. Among the small subgroup with

tients who underwent conversion to GBP (18 of 38 [47.4%]) and

Initiation of Antidiabetes Treatment During the 6-Year Follow-up
For patients without antidiabetes treatment at baseline, the
6-year antidiabetes treatment initiation rates were 1.4% and
12.0%,respectively,forthebariatricsurgeryandcontrolgroups

rates of total discontinuation from year 2 to year 6 were higher

Discussion
This nationwide observational population-based cohort study
demonstrates that bariatric surgery is associated with high
6-year antidiabetes treatment discontinuation rates and low
treatment initiation rates compared with matched control
patients. A marked association after GBP was seen.
The efficacy of bariatric surgery as treatment for metabolic
conditionsassociatedwithmorbidobesity,especiallytype2dia-
betes,hasbeenwidelystudiedintheliterature.9,10,15,16,18,23How-

Even when antidiabetes treatment was not discontinued
in our study, it was often simplified. Six years after bariatric
surgery, 40.0% of patients using insulin at baseline had
switched to another treatment, and 57.0% of patients receiv-
ing dual therapy had switched to monotherapy or no antidia-
betes treatment (Figure 2A).
Few studies have assessed the incidence of diabetes after
bariatric surgery compared with control patients. Two studies,
one in which surgery mostly consisted of vertical banded
gastroplasty22 and another based on short follow-up (median,
2.8 years),23 reported an incidence of diabetes after bariatric
surgery of less than 1% and 4.3%, respectively. In our study, the
incidenceofdiabetesafterbariatricsurgerybasedontreatment
initiationwas1.4%at6years,whichismuchlowerthantherate
observedinourmatchedcontrolpatients(12.0%),withagreater
association of GBP and SG than AGB. Our findings support the
hypothesisthatthebenefitsofbariatricsurgerypersistmanyyears
after the procedure.
Other predictive factors for antidiabetes treatment discon-
tinuation or initiation were also identified. As expected, the in-
tensity of treatment at baseline (insulin use or dual therapy
without insulin) and older age were the 2 major factors limiting
theprobabilityofdiscontinuation,whilepatientswithantidepres-
sant or lipid-lowering treatment at baseline were also less
likelytodiscontinueantidiabetestreatment.Recentstudies33,34
have focused on the relationship between depression and
diabetes distress.

 Strengths and Limitations
Themainstrengthofourstudyisthatitwasbasedonthenation-

tionontreatmentiscomprehensivelycollectedforallreimbursed
drugs.Patientsareidentifiedbytheirpersonalsmartcardandonly
have to pay a co-payment for each drug dispensed, and remote
data transmission to the French national health insurance net-
work is performed by pharmacists on a daily basis. The costs of
antidiabetestreatment,aswellaslaboratorytestsandconsulta-
tionswithaphysician,arereimbursed,includingforlow-income
patients, for whom co-payment is waived. Therefore, access to
health care for patients undergoing bariatric surgery should
not constitute a limitation to receiving appropriate care during
follow-up,exceptwhenpatientsconsiderthattheydonotrequire
andthusdonotseekmedicalcare.Whilethenumberofpatients

alsexcludedfromthestudypopulationwerethosewhowereout

Themajorlimitationofourstudyisthatsomeimportantdata

with shorter follow-up and smaller sample sizes may have also
included laboratory test results, such as glycated hemoglobin
level. Long-term antidiabetes treatment discontinuation rates
couldbeoverestimatedinourstudyandinfluencedbypoortreat-
ment adherence because patients who have undergone bariat-
ricsurgerymaynotseekfurthermedicalfollow-up.Thistypeof
bias related to patients lost to follow-up is also present in other
investigations, explaining why few studies report long-term
results after bariatric surgery.35 Finally, 226 patients who died
during follow-up were excluded from our study.
Another limitation is that our control group was composed
ofhospitalizedpatientswithobesitybecauseBMIisonlyreported
inthedatabasewhenpatientsarehospitalized.Thecontrolgroup
was matched with cases based on age, sex, BMI category, and
antidiabetes treatment. It differed from the bariatric surgery

 frequency and complexity of antidiabetes treatment 6 years
after bariatric surgery, with a marked association for patients
undergoing GBP. In parallel, we demonstrated a low rate of
antidiabetes treatment initiation 6 years after bariatric sur-
gery. However, patients and physicians should be aware that
morbid obesity remains a chronic disease even after bariatric
surgery because 50.1% of patients with preexisting antidiabe-
tes treatment remained on treatment 6 years after surgery. Our
study highlights the message that these patients require
careful lifelong follow-up to monitor obesity complications.

Can We Do Better?
Michel Gagner, MD, FRCSC
In a study of more than 30 000 adults in France published in
this issue of JAMA Surgery, Thereaux et al1 observed that
bariatric surgery was associated with a significantly higher
antidiabetic
treatment
discontinuation rate 6 years
after surgery (50%) com-
pared with the discontinuation rate in a control group of
patients with obesity (9%), with gastric bypass being the most
effective procedure. Beyond the usual and obvious dangers of
interpreting data from an administrative database, this analy-
sis lacks a defined criteria for type 2 diabetes and weight loss;
however, it confirms other analyses, such as those resulting
from the Swedish Obesity Study.2
A small percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes
receive bariatric surgery in France (11%); in the United States,
this percentage is less than 30%.3 Moreover, it remains to be
seen if French surgeons will do Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for
every French citizen that requires bariatric surgery (and has
