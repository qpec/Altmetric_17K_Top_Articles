Mammalian sleep consists of distinct rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM)
states. The midbrain region ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) is known to be
important for gating REM sleep, but the underlying neuronal mechanism is not well under-
stood. Here, we show that activating vlPAG GABAergic neurons in mice suppresses the
initiation and maintenance of REM sleep while consolidating NREM sleep, partly through their
projection to the dorsolateral pons. Cell-type-specific recording and calcium imaging reveal
that most vlPAG GABAergic neurons are strongly suppressed at REM sleep onset and
activated at its termination. In addition to the rapid changes at brain state transitions, their
activity decreases gradually between REM sleep and is reset by each REM episode in a
duration-dependent manner, mirroring the accumulation and dissipation of REM sleep
pressure. Thus, vlPAG GABAergic neurons powerfully gate REM sleep, and their firing rate
modulation may contribute to the ultradian rhythm of REM/NREM alternation.

uring behavioral sleep, the mammalian brain alternates
between two distinct states—rapid eye movement (REM)
sleep with desynchronized electroencephalogram (EEG)
and non-REM (NREM) sleep characterized by large-amplitude
slow-wave activity1, 2. While the switch between these brain states
occurs rapidly within seconds, the recurrence of the NREM/REM
cycle follows a much slower ultradian rhythm, on a timescale of
minutes in rodents to hours in humans3. Understanding the
mechanisms controlling sleep requires characterization of the
neuronal processes operating on both timescales.
The ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) in the midbrain
is known to play an important role in gating REM sleep. Inhi-
bition of the vlPAG and the nearby deep mesencephalic reticular
nucleus through muscimol injection causes a marked increase in
REM sleep4–7, whereas disinhibition of this area with bicuculline
decreases REM sleep. Lesion of the vlPAG neurons also increases
REM sleep in cats8, rats9, and mice10. c-Fos immunohistochem-
istry following REM sleep deprivation identified a large number
of REM-off neurons that are GABAergic7, and recent studies
based
on
optogenetic11
and
chemogenetic12
manipulations
demonstrated that activation/inhibition of the vlPAG GABAergic
neurons decreases/increases REM sleep.
Although these studies indicate a crucial role of the GABAergic
neurons in gating REM sleep, the underlying circuit mechanism is
not well understood. Anatomical tracing revealed a strong vlPAG
projection to the dorsolateral pons13, an important REM-
promoting area9, 14–17, but the functional contribution of this
projection in gating REM sleep remains to be assessed. The onset
and termination of each REM sleep episode occur rapidly on a
timescale of seconds. Although vlPAG GABAergic neurons have
been shown to express c-fos after REM sleep deprivation7, the
slow time course of c-fos expression obscures their firing rate
changes associated with brain state transitions. Furthermore, the
REM/NREM alternation is known to follow an ultradian rhythm
on a timescale of minutes, but the mechanism controlling the
ultradian timing is poorly understood. Given the crucial role of
vlPAG GABAergic neurons in gating REM sleep, an interesting
question is whether their activity is modulated on a timescale of
minutes and whether such slow modulation could influence the
ultradian timing of REM sleep.
In this study, we characterize the activity of vlPAG GABAergic
neurons on both fast and slow timescales and assessed their roles
in regulating REM and NREM sleep. We first measure the effects
of activating these neurons on brain states. Rabies virus (RV)-
mediated trans-synaptic retrograde tracing is used to establish the
postsynaptic targets of these neurons in the dorsolateral pons, and
the functional contribution of this projection in gating REM sleep
is tested optogenetically. We then perform cell-type-specific
recording and calcium imaging to characterize the spiking activity
of these GABAergic neurons across sleep–wake cycles. Analysis of
their firing rate modulation show that, while the rapid activity
changes over seconds are directly associated with REM sleep
onset and termination, their slow modulations over a time course
of minutes closely mirror the accumulation and dissipation of
REM sleep pressure, well suited for the ultradian regulation of the
REM/NREM alternation. These results clarify the roles of vlPAG
GABAergic neurons in both the direct gating and ultradian reg-
ulation of REM sleep.
Results
Optogenetic activation of vlPAG GABAergic neurons. Our
previous study showed that channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2)-medi-
ated optogenetic activation of vlPAG GABAergic neurons (20 Hz
laser stimulation, 5 min per trial, applied every 15–25 min) causes
a near-complete suppression of REM sleep, a strong reduction of
wakefulness, and a marked increase in NREM sleep11. We have
now confirmed these effects in additional animals (Fig. 1a–c,
Supplementary Fig. 1a, P < 0.0001 for all three brain states;
bootstrap, n = 12 mice). The EEG power spectrum during spon-
taneous NREM sleep was indistinguishable from that during the
NREM sleep overlapping with laser activation of ChR2 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1b), and in control mice expressing enhanced yellow
fluorescent protein (eYFP) without ChR2 laser stimulation had
no effect on brain states (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Histological
examination confirmed ChR2-eYFP expression and optic fiber
placement in the vlPAG (Supplementary Fig. 1d, e), and across
mice the effect of optogenetic stimulation was highly consistent
(Supplementary Fig. 1f, g). Furthermore, ChR2-medicated acti-
vation of glutamatergic neurons in the vlPAG strongly promoted
wakefulness (Supplementary Fig. 2), distinct from the effect of
activating GABAergic neurons.
To distinguish whether the laser-induced change in the
percentage of time in each brain state is due to a change in the
initiation or maintenance of that state, we analyzed the transition
probability between each pair of brain states. Laser activation of
the vlPAG GABAergic neurons caused marked decreases in
NREM→REM and REM→REM transitions (Fig. 1d–f; P < 0.001,
bootstrap), indicating a suppression of both the initiation and
maintenance of REM sleep. Laser stimulation also caused
significant
increases
in
NREM→NREM
and
wake→NREM
transitions (P < 0.001). However, as shown in the cumulative
transition probability analysis, the increase in the wake→NREM
transition was much weaker compared to the decreases in
NREM→wake and NREM→REM transitions (Fig. 1f), indicating
that the increased NREM sleep was primarily due to enhanced
maintenance rather than initiation. Consistent with these changes
in transition probabilities, the mean duration of REM episodes
was shortened (P = 0.04, z = 7.0, Wilcoxon sign-rank test), and the
NREM episodes were prolonged (Fig. 1g; P = 0.004, z = 2.0).
During the baseline period without laser, 22.2% of the NREM
episodes transitioned into REM sleep and 77.8% to wakefulness;
laser stimulation significantly reduced the proportion of transitions
into REM sleep to 7.6% (Fig. 1h; P = 0.003, z = 1.0, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Interestingly, the effect of laser stimulation on the
initiation of wakefulness depended on the preceding state: while the
NREM→wake transition was reduced (P < 0.001), the REM→wake
transition was enhanced (Fig. 1d, e; P = 0.049). Thus, unlike the
unambiguous suppression of REM sleep by vlPAG GABAergic
neurons, their effect on wakefulness is more complex: wakefulness
is enhanced relative to REM sleep but suppressed relative to NREM
sleep, with an overall reduction in the amount of wakefulness.
Previous studies have shown that lesion of the vlPAG increases
REM sleep8–10. To test the effect of cell-type-specific ablation of
GABAergic neurons, we injected into the vlPAG of GAD2-Cre
mice Cre-inducible adeno-associated viruses (AAV) expressing
pro-Caspase 3 and an enzyme that cleaves pro-Caspase 3 into its
active, pro-apoptotic form Caspase 318. Compared to the control
GAD2-Cre mice expressing eYFP, the number of GAD2-
expressing neurons in the vlPAG was greatly reduced (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3a, b). The amount of REM sleep increased
significantly during both the light (P = 0.009, z = 50.0, Wilcoxon
rank-sum test) and dark phases (P = 0.03, z = 0.26; Supplementary
Fig. 3c–i), which was due primarily to an increased frequency of
REM sleep episodes (light phase, P = 0.02, z = 0.49; dark phase, P
= 0.03, z = 0.26; Supplementary Fig. 3f, i). This is consistent with
previous lesion studies8–10, and it further supports the role of
vlPAG GABAergic neurons in gating REM sleep.

 including the sublaterodorsal nucleus (SLD)9, 13, known to be
crucial for the generation of REM sleep. However, the functional
contribution of this inhibitory projection has not been tested
directly. We injected Cre-inducible AAV expressing ChR2–eYFP
into the vlPAG of GAD2-Cre mice and implanted an optic fiber
near the ventrolateral boundary of the pontine central gray to
stimulate axon fibers projecting to this region of the dorsolateral
pons (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). Activation of the vlPAG
axons in this region caused a near-complete suppression of REM
sleep and strong reduction of wakefulness (Fig. 2b; P < 0.0001,
bootstrap). The magnitudes of the effects were comparable to
those caused by stimulating the vlPAG cell bodies (Fig. 1c),
suggesting a strong functional contribution of this projection.
Glutamatergic neurons in the SLD are known to be important
for REM sleep generation9, 14–17. To test whether these neurons
are directly innervated by the vlPAG GABAergic projection, we

 are GABAergic, we performed in situ fluorescence hybridization
(FISH) for GAD2 mRNA (see Methods section). We found that
41% (317/782) of eGFP-labeled vlPAG neurons were GABAergic
(Fig. 2g, h, k; n = 3 mice), suggesting that the suppression of REM
sleep by vlPAG GABAergic neurons could be partly mediated by
their direct inhibition of SLD glutamatergic neurons.
Since the cholinergic laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) and
noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) are also within the projection
field
of
the
vlPAG
GABAergic
neurons,
we
tested
their
monosynaptic innervation using RV-mediated retrograde tracing.
We found that 34% (33/96) of eGFP-labeled vlPAG neurons
innervating cholinergic LDT neurons were GABAergic (Fig. 2e, i,
k; n = 3 mice), and 56% (83/148) of the neurons innervating
noradrenergic LC neurons were GABAergic (Fig. 2f, j, k; n = 3
mice). Stimulating the LC noradrenergic neurons increases
wakefulness24. Optogenetic activation of cholinergic neurons in
the LDT and the nearby peduncolopontine tegmentum increased
NREM to REM transitions25, although chemogenetic activation
of these neurons was found to promote light NREM sleep
instead26. Our result suggests that the suppression of REM sleep/
wakefulness and consolidation of NREM sleep by vlPAG
GABAergic neurons could also be mediated in part by inhibition
of the cholinergic and noradrenergic neurons in dorsolateral
pons.
Optrode recording from vlPAG GABAergic neurons. To
understand how vlPAG GABAergic neurons control the initiation
and termination of REM sleep, it is important to characterize
their firing rate changes at brain state transitions. Although a
powerful
method
for
identifying
REM-on
and
REM-off
neurons7,
9,
15, c-Fos immunohistochemistry cannot detect
activity changes on the timescale of seconds, given the slow time
course of c-fos expression. While electrophysiological recordings
have been made in the vlPAG previously6, 27, 28, it is unclear
whether the recorded neurons were GABAergic.
To identify vlPAG GABAergic neurons, we used optogenetic
tagging and optrode recording29. High-frequency laser pulse
trains (15 or 30 Hz, 5–10 ms/pulse, 1 or 0.5 s/train) were applied
in the vlPAG of GAD2-Cre mice injected with Cre-inducible
AAV-expressing ChR2-eYFP. Single units exhibiting reliable
laser-evoked spiking with short latencies and high reliability
were identified as GABAergic neurons (Fig. 3a and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5a, b; see Methods section), which typically had biphasic
spike waveforms (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Laser stimulation
increased the firing rates of all identified units, irrespective of
their baseline activity (Supplementary Fig. 5d, e), and subsequent
histological examination confirmed the locations of the identified
units (see Methods section, Supplementary Fig. 5f). The majority
of these neurons (11/19, 58%) were significantly less active during
REM sleep than during both NREM sleep and wakefulness (P <
0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, post-hoc Bonferroni correction,
Fig. 3b–d, Supplementary Movie 1), consistent with the large
number of REM-off GABAergic neurons detected by c-Fos
immunohistochemistry7. A small number of identified neurons
(4/19, 21%) were most active during REM sleep, consistent with
the existence of REM-on neurons in this region6, 7, 10, 28. During
wakefulness, vlPAG GABAergic neurons were preferentially
active during locomotor behaviors (Supplementary Fig. 5g).
Compared to the identified GABAergic neurons, the unidentified
cell population contained a lower percentage of REM-off neurons
(Supplementary Fig. 6a–d; 4/22, 18.2%). Interestingly, some
neurons in the vlPAG were inhibited by the laser pulses,
suggesting that they receive inhibitory inputs from vlPAG
GABAergic neurons. This neuronal population contained the
highest percentage of REM-on neurons (6/10, 60%; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 6c–f), suggesting that local inhibition of REM-on
neurons within the vlPAG also contributes to REM sleep
suppression by the GABAergic neurons.
We then analyzed the firing rate changes of these neurons at
brain state transitions. The GABAergic REM-off neurons showed
a strong firing rate reduction seconds before the onset of REM
sleep, which persisted through most of the REM sleep episode
(Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 7a), suggesting that the silencing of
these neurons contributes to natural REM sleep onset and
maintenance.
In
contrast,
the
REM→wake
transition
was
associated with an abrupt increase in firing rate, consistent with
the finding that optogenetic activation of these neurons shortened
REM
sleep
by
increasing
the
transition
into
wakefulness
(Fig. 1d–f). Surprisingly, the NREM→wake transition was also
accompanied by a firing rate increase and the wake→NREM
transition by a decrease (Fig. 3e, see Discussion section).
Interestingly, while their firing rates decreased gradually over
the course of each NREM sleep episode before the transition to
either REM sleep or wakefulness, the overall firing rate was
significantly lower during the episodes leading to REM sleep
(Fig. 3f; P = 0.0001, T(8) = −7.03, paired t-test; Supplementary
Fig. 7b). This is consistent with the finding that NREM episodes
with optogenetic activation of the GABAergic neurons were less
likely to transition into REM sleep (Fig. 1h); it also suggests that
the natural firing rates of vlPAG GABAergic neurons during each
NREM episode is predictive of whether the animal will transition
into REM sleep or wakefulness. To test this possibility directly, we
predicted the transition to either REM sleep or wakefulness based

 on the preceding NREM-period activity of each REM-off neuron
using a linear classification method (Fisher’s linear discriminant;
see Methods section). We found that even 60 s before the
transition the prediction accuracy was significantly above the
chance level (P = 0.04, bootstrap), and it reached 68.6% 30 s
before the transition (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Thus the NREM
activity of individual vlPAG REM-off GABAergic neurons is
informative about future brain state changes. In contrast, the
REM-on neurons in the unidentified population showed no firing
rate difference between the NREM episodes leading to REM or
wakefulness (Supplementary Fig. 6g, h; P = 0.31, T(10) = 1.06,
paired t-test; Supplementary Fig. 8b).
Calcium imaging of vlPAG GABAergic neurons. In addition to
optrode recording, we also performed calcium imaging, which
allows observation of multiple vlPAG GABAergic neurons
simultaneously. AAV was injected into the vlPAG of GAD2-Cre
mice for Cre-inducible expression of the calcium indicator
GCaMP6f30. Imaging was performed in freely moving mice
through a gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens coupled to a
miniaturized integrated fluorescence microscope31 (Fig. 4a, Sup-
plementary Fig. 9).
We observed strong variation of the calcium activity across
brain states (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Movie 2). The great majority
of imaged neurons exhibited lower activity during REM sleep
than NREM sleep or wakefulness (Fig. 4c, d). Analysis at brain
state transitions showed a strong activity suppression before the
NREM→REM transition and throughout the REM sleep episode
but a rapid increase in activity at wake onset (Fig. 4e).
Furthermore, the activity during NREM sleep was significantly
lower prior to the transition to REM sleep than to wakefulness
(Fig. 4f). Together, these results confirmed our findings in the
optrode recording experiments (Fig. 3), indicating that the great
majority of vlPAG GABAergic neurons are REM-off, and the
suppression of their activity is closely associated with REM sleep
initiation and maintenance.

 alternation3. Since the vlPAG GABAergic neurons powerfully
gate REM sleep, we wondered whether they also play a role in
controlling its ultradian timing. Thus, in addition to the rapid
activity changes at brain state transitions, we also analyzed their
slow modulation during the period between successive REM sleep
episodes (inter-REM interval), which consists of both NREM and
wake episodes.
First, we temporally compressed each inter-REM interval to
unit duration before averaging the vlPAG activity over multiple
inter-REM intervals and across multiple REM-off GABAergic
neurons. Both optrode recording and calcium imaging revealed a
high activity at the beginning of the interval, which decreased
slowly but consistently throughout the interval (Fig. 5a, Supple-
mentary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Fig. 11a). Interestingly, when
we analyzed the activity within NREM and wake states separately
during the inter-REM interval, the decrease was significant for
NREM (R = −0.48, P = 2.5 × 10−4, T(53) = −3.93, linear regression)
but not for wake states (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. 11b; R =
−0.04, P = 0.76, T(52) = −0.29). Consistent with this observation,
the firing rate was significantly higher in the first than the last
NREM episode within each inter-REM interval (Fig. 5c; P = 0.008,
T(10) = 3.28, paired t-test; Supplementary Fig. 11c), but no
significant difference was found for the wake episodes (Fig. 5d, P
= 0.15, T(10) = 1.56; Supplementary Fig. 11d). Furthermore, when
the activity was averaged across all NREM or wake episodes, the
decrease was apparent within a single NREM but not wake
episode (Fig. 5e; NREM, R = −0.65, P = 2.8 × 10−15, T(108) =
−8.77; wake, R = 0.21, P = 0.027, T(108) = 2.24; Supplementary

 Fig. 11e). These findings suggest that the slow process modulating
vlPAG activity during each inter-REM interval operates selec-
tively during NREM sleep. Given the strong REM suppression
effect of vlPAG GABAergic neurons (Fig. 1), the slow decrease of
their firing rates could gradually enhance the propensity of the
next REM episode and thus regulate the ultradian timing of the
REM/NREM alternation. In contrast, the REM-on neurons in the
unidentified population showed no consistent change in their
NREM or wake activity during the inter-REM interval (Supple-
mentary Fig. 12a–e; NREM, R = 0.13, P = 0.33, T(58) = 0.99; wake,
R = −0.17, P = 0.19, T(58) = −1.32; linear regression).
Homeostatic regulation of REM sleep and vlPAG activity. The
duration of the inter-REM interval is highly variable in rodents,
and in the rat it was found to be correlated with the duration of
the preceding REM episode32, 33. Here we found a similar rela-
tionship in the mouse (Fig. 6a; R = 0.39, P = 6.8 × 10−36, T(970) =
13.03, linear regression), with longer inter-REM intervals fol-
lowing longer REM periods (Fig. 6b). Such a correlation suggests
that the inter-REM interval is under homeostatic regulation, in
which REM sleep pressure accumulated during inter-REM
intervals is partially dissipated by each REM sleep episode33, 34;
a longer episode causes stronger dissipation of the pressure and
thus requires a longer interval for accumulation before the next
REM episode. As a further test of this homeostatic regulation, we
performed closed-loop activation of vlPAG GABAergic neurons
(see Methods section), in which laser stimulation was applied as
soon as spontaneous REM sleep onset was detected and lasted
until the REM episode ended (in 50% of randomly selected REM
episodes). We found that shortening of REM episode duration by
the stimulation (P = 0.002, T(5) = 5.88, paired t-test) also led to a
significant shortening of the subsequent inter-REM interval, likely
due to a reduced dissipation of REM sleep pressure (Fig. 6c; P =
0.003, T(5) = −5.29, paired t-test).
We then examined the effect of each REM episode on the
NREM activity of vlPAG GABAergic neurons. Compared to the
pre-REM activity, the NREM activity following a REM episode
was significantly elevated (Fig. 6d; P = 0.006, T(10) = −3.43, paired
t-test; Supplementary Fig. 13a), suggesting that a single REM
episode can reset the firing rate of vlPAG GABAergic neurons,
which has been decreasing slowly during the preceding inter-
REM interval. In contrast, we found no significant difference in
NREM activity before and after a single wake episode (Fig. 6e; P =
0.41, T(10) = 0.84, paired t-test; Supplementary Fig. 13b), suggest-
ing that the firing rate reset is specific to REM sleep. The post-
REM activity of vlPAG GABAergic neurons was higher following
long (>90 s) REM episodes than following short (≤90 s) REM
episodes (Fig. 6f; P = 0.03, T(3) = −3.8, paired t-test; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 13c), and the mean firing rate during the inter-REM
interval was significantly correlated with the preceding REM
episode duration (Fig. 6g; P = 0.001, T(38) = 3.58, linear regres-
sion; Supplementary Fig. 13d). In contrast, the activity of
unidentified REM-on neurons showed no dependence on the
preceding REM duration (Supplementary Fig. 14). These results
point to a strong parallel between the modulation of vlPAG
GABAergic neuron activity and the accumulation and dissipation
of REM sleep pressure. Finally, we found a strong correlation
between the duration of the inter-REM interval and the vlPAG
firing rate during the interval (Fig. 6h; P = 1.6 × 10−5, T(38) = 4.95;

 Supplementary Fig. 13e). This is consistent with the finding that
higher vlPAG activity is associated with lower propensity for
REM sleep (Figs. 1d–g, 3c, d and 4c, d), and it provides correlative
evidence that the modulation of vlPAG activity by prior sleep
history can mediate the homeostatic regulation of REM sleep.
Discussion
Using optogenetic manipulation and Caspase 3-mediated cell
ablation, we found that vlPAG GABAergic neurons powerfully
suppress REM sleep. Activation of these neurons greatly reduced
both NREM→REM transitions and REM sleep maintenance while
consolidating NREM sleep (Fig. 1), which are likely mediated in
part by their projection to the dorsolateral pons (Fig. 2). Optrode
recording and calcium imaging showed that their activity was
strongly suppressed at the onset of each REM sleep episode and
increased abruptly at its termination (Figs. 3 and 4), consistent
with their functional role in gating REM sleep. In addition to the
rapid changes at brain state transitions, their activity was also
modulated on a timescale of minutes. The dependence of their
firing rates on sleep history closely parallels the accumulation and

 dissipation of REM sleep pressure (Figs. 5 and 6). These results
support the notion that REM sleep onset and termination are
controlled by fast synaptic inhibition from vlPAG GABAergic
neurons to REM-promoting neurons in the pons, whereas the
ultradian timing of REM sleep is regulated by a homeostatic
process acting through slow modulation of vlPAG GABAergic
activity.
The strong suppression of vlPAG activity during REM sleep
(Figs. 3e and 4e) could be mediated in part by inhibitory inputs
from REM-active neurons. In addition to the small number of
REM-on neurons within the vlPAG7 (Figs. 3c, d and 4c, d, red),
which could locally inhibit the REM-off neurons, REM-active
GABAergic neurons in the pons, ventral and dorsal medulla,
lateral hypothalamus, and preoptic area have all been shown to
project to the vlPAG9, 11, 35. In particular, rabies-mediated trans-
synaptic retrograde tracing has shown that GABAergic neurons
in the ventrolateral medulla, which powerfully promote REM
sleep, directly innervate GABAergic vlPAG neurons11. Optoge-
netic activation of these axon projections promoted REM sleep at
a magnitude similar to that of activating the medulla neuron cell
bodies, suggesting that inhibition of the vlPAG REM-off neurons
is a major mechanism promoting REM sleep.
Surprisingly, the REM-off vlPAG neurons were most active
during wakefulness (Figs. 3 and 4), even though their optogenetic
activation increased NREM sleep and decreased wakefulness
(Figs. 1 and 2). One of the excitatory inputs driving their wake
activity may be the projection from orexin/hypocretin neurons in
the hypothalamus9, which are most active during wakefulness36,
and vlPAG GABAergic neurons are known to express orexin/
hypocretin receptors10. Given the power of vlPAG GABAergic
neurons in suppressing REM sleep (Fig. 1), this input may
effectively prevent unwanted intrusions of REM sleep into
wakefulness. Although superficially the high wake activity of
vlPAG GABAergic neurons may seem incompatible with the
wake-suppressing effect of their optogenetic activation (Fig. 1),
we note that the effect was primarily due to an enhanced NREM
sleep maintenance. The low efficacy of these neurons in inducing
wake→NREM transitions (Fig. 1f) may allow other wake-
promoting neurons to counteract the high firing rates of the
vlPAG neurons to maintain wakefulness. On the other hand,
activation of these neurons was highly effective in reducing
NREM→wake transitions (Fig. 1f); the increase in their natural
firing rates at this transition indicates that natural awakening
from NREM sleep is not due to, but in spite of, the firing rate
change of vlPAG GABAergic neurons.
To account for the ultradian alternation between REM and
NREM sleep, the first circuit model emphasized reciprocal
interactions between cholinergic REM-on and monoaminergic
REM-off neurons37. Subsequent studies have highlighted the
importance of GABAergic inhibition between REM-on and REM-
off neurons7, 9, 11, 35. Although fast GABAergic interactions can
account for rapid transitions between brain states, they are
insufficient to explain the temporal dynamics of NREM/REM
alternation on a timescale of minutes (rodents) to hours
(humans); a separate, slow-varying process is required38, 39. Here,
in addition to confirming the correlation between the REM epi-
sode duration and subsequent inter-REM interval in mice
(Fig. 6a), we found that shortening of REM sleep episodes
through an optogenetic manipulation also shortened the sub-
sequent inter-REM interval (Fig. 6c). These findings support the
notion that the ultradian timing of REM sleep is strongly regu-
lated by a homeostatic pressure that accumulates on a timescale
of minutes and is partially dissipated by each REM sleep
episode33, 34, 39. Interestingly, chemogenetic manipulations that
shortened/prolonged
REM
sleep
duration
also
decreased/
increased the EEG delta power in subsequent NREM sleep12,
suggesting that, in addition to dissipating REM sleep pressure,
REM sleep also contributes to the accumulation of NREM sleep
pressure.
At the neuronal level, we found that vlPAG GABAergic neuron
activity decreased gradually during the inter-REM interval (Fig. 5)
and was reset by each REM episode, the magnitude of which
depended on the episode duration (Fig. 6). These firing rate
modulations mirror the accumulation and dissipation of REM
sleep pressure33, 34, and implementation of such slow modula-
tions of REM-off neurons in circuit models can account for the
temporal dynamics of REM/NREM alternations38, 39. Previous
studies have shown that REM sleep deprivation for several hours
decreased/increased the activity of REM-off/REM-on neurons40
and increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor
in the pons41, 42. It would be interesting to know whether these
processes also operate on a timescale of minutes and whether they
are causally linked to the firing rate modulations in vlPAG neu-
rons (Figs. 5 and 6). Regarding the cellular mechanisms for these
slow activity modulations, recent work in flies showed that sleep
pressure is reflected by the change in excitability of sleep-
promoting neurons projecting into the dorsal fan-shaped body,
regulated through the antagonistic actions of two types of
potassium channels43. It would be interesting for future studies to
test whether conductances of vlPAG GABAergic neurons are
similarly regulated by homeostatic need for REM sleep in the
mammalian brain.
Methods
Animals. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee at the University of California, Berkeley. Optogenetic manipulation
experiments were performed in male or female GAD2-Cre (Jackson Laboratory
stock 010702) and VGLUT2-Cre (016963) mice. Optrode recording, calcium
imaging, lesion, and rabies-mediated trans-synaptic tracing experiments were all
performed in male or female GAD2-Cre, VGLUT2-Cre, TH-Cre (008601), and
ChAT-Cre (006410) mice. Animals were housed on a 12-h dark/12-h light cycle
(light on between 0700 and 1900 hours). Animals with implants for EEG/EMG
recordings, optogenetic stimulation, optrode recordings, or calcium imaging were
housed individually. Mice injected with viruses for trans-synaptic tracing were
housed in groups of up to six animals.
Surgical procedures. Adult (6–12-week-old) mice were anesthetized with iso-
flurane (3% induction, 1.5% maintenance) and placed on a stereotaxic frame. Body
temperature was kept stable throughout the procedure by using a heating pad.
After asepsis, the skin was incised to expose the skull, and the overlying connective
tissue was removed. For access to the vlPAG, a craniotomy (1 mm diameter) was
made on top of the right superior colliculus (4.6–4.8 mm posterior to bregma,
0.6–0.7 mm lateral). AAV2-EF1a-FLEX-ChR2–eYFP, AAV2-EF1a-FLEX–eYFP
(produced by University of North Carolina Vector Core), AAV1-Syn-Flex-
GCaMP6f (University of Pennsylvania Vector Core), or AAV-DJ-EF1a-FLEX-
ChR2–eYFP (University of Stanford Gene Vector and Virus Core) was loaded into
a sharp micropipette mounted on a Nanoject II or Nanoject III and injected slowly
at a depth of 2.5 mm from the brain surface (300–500 nl, unilateral). An optical
fiber (0.2 mm diameter) was inserted with the tip 0.2 mm above the virus injection
site. To stimulate axon projections of vlPAG GABAergic neurons in the dorso-
lateral pons, the optical fiber was implanted within the pons (5.2–5.3 mm posterior
to bregma, 0.9 mm lateral, 3.0 mm depth). For cell-type-specific lesion experiments,
AAV2-Flex-taCasp3-Tevp (University of North Carolina Vector Core) was injected
bilaterally into the vlPAG (200–300 nl). For optogenetic experiments, data from
animals where the tip of the optical fiber was not within the aimed location were
excluded. For lesion experiments, data from animals where virus expression was
not restricted to the vlPAG were excluded.
For EEG and EMG recordings, a reference screw was inserted into the skull on
top of the left cerebellum. EEG recordings were made from two screws, one on top
of hippocampus (about 2 mm posterior to bregma) and one on top of the
prefrontal cortex (about 1 mm anterior to bregma). Two EMG electrodes were
inserted into the left and right neck muscles. For EEG/EMG recordings in
differential mode, four screws were fixed on the skull, two posterior and two
anterior of bregma. All screws, electrodes, microdrives, connectors, and GRIN
lenses required for EEG/EMG recordings, optrode recordings, and calcium imaging
were secured to the skull using dental cement.
Rabies virus tracing. For retrograde tracing, AAV-CAG-FLExloxP-TC66T (1.0 ×
1012 gc/mL) and AAV8-CAG-FLExloxP-RG (1.8 × 1012 gc/mL) was mixed at a 1:1

 ratio and stereotaxically injected. For tracing from glutamatergic neurons in the
dorsolateral pons, 100 nl was injected into VGLUT2-Cre mice at −5.3 mm AP, 0.8
mm ML, 3.3 mm DV, unilaterally. For tracing from the LDT, 300–500 nl was
injected in ChAT-Cre mice at −5.2 mm AP, 0.7 mm ML, 3.2 mm DV, bilaterally.
For tracing from the noradrenergic neurons in the LC, 200–300 nl was injected into
TH-Cre mice at −5.34 mm AP, 0.8 mm ML, 3.2 mm DV, unilaterally. Two weeks
after the AAV injection, 300–400 nl of RVdG-eGFP+EnvA (1.0 × 109 cfu/ml) was
injected into the same location. The injection pipette for AAV was tilted at 20
degrees from vertical while the injection pipette for RV was inserted vertically to
limit virus coinfection along a common injection tract. We excluded animals with
inefficient trans-synaptic labeling indicated by <30 rabies-GFP-labeled cells
detected outside of the injection site.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Mice were deeply anesthetized and
transcardially perfused with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS. After removal, brains stayed overnight in 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde. For cryoprotection, brains were stored in 30% sucrose (w/v) in PBS
solution for at least 1 night. Brains were sliced in 30 or 40 μm sections using a
cryostat (Leica). For immunohistochemistry, non-specific binding sites were
blocked by incubating the brain sections in 2% goat serum (Millipore) in PBST
(0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS).
To amplify the fluorescence of axon fibers expressing ChR2-eYFP or eYFP, we
applied antibodies for GFP (A11122, Life Technologies, 1:1000). Brain sections
were incubated with the primary antibody diluted in blocking solution for 2 nights.
A species-specific secondary antibody conjugated with green Alexa fluorophore
(A11008, Life Technologies, 1:1000; goat anti-rabbit) was diluted in PBS and
applied for 2 h. Fluorescence images were taken using a confocal microscope (LSM
710 AxioObserver Inverted 34-Channel Confocal, Zeiss), fluorescence microscope
(Keyence, BZ-X710), and Nanozoomer 2.0 RS (Hamamatsu).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization. FISH was performed to detect GAD2 mRNA.
Brains were embedded and mounted with Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura
finetek), and 30 μm sections were cut using a cryostat (Leica). FISH was performed
using an RNAscope assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (RNA-
scope® Fluorescent Multiplex Reagent Kit, Cat. # 320850, Advanced cell Diag-
nostics). Sections were hybridized with a GAD2 probe (Mm-Gad2, 439371) and
eGFP probe (EGFP-C3, 400281-C3), and amplification steps were carried out
followed by Hoechst staining. Fluorescence images were taken using a confocal
microscope (LSM 710 AxioObserver Inverted 34-Channel Confocal, Zeiss) or a
fluorescence microscope (BZ-X700, Keyence).
Polysomnographic recordings. EEG and EMG electrodes were connected to
flexible recording cables via a mini-connector, and recordings were made in the
animal’s home cage placed in a sound-attenuated box. Recordings started after at
least 1 h of habituation. The signals were recorded with a TDT RZ5 amplifier
(bandpass filter, 1–750 Hz; sampling rate, 1500 Hz) or an A-M Systems amplifier
(sampling rate, 600 Hz). For the recordings using the TDT amplifier, EEG and
EMG signals were referenced to a common ground screw, placed on top of the
cerebellum. Recordings with the A-M Systems amplifier were made in differential
mode. We used the difference between the voltage potentials recorded from an
anterior (on top of prefrontal cortex) and posterior screw (on top of hippocampus)
as EEG signal and the difference between the potentials from the two EMG elec-
trodes as EMG signal.
To determine the brain state from the recorded EEG and EMG signals, we first
calculated the power spectrum for the EEG and EMG signals using 5 s sliding
windows, sequentially shifted by 2.5 s increments. Next, we summed the EEG
power in the range from 1 to 4 Hz and from 6 to 12 Hz, yielding time-dependent
delta and theta power. For further analysis, we computed the theta/delta power
ratio. We also summed the EMG power in the range 20–300 Hz. As a first step, we
determined for each time point the brain state using an automated threshold
algorithm. We first determined a threshold for the delta power (delta threshold),
separating the typically bimodal distribution of the delta power into a lower and
higher range. A state was assigned as NREM sleep if the delta power was larger
than the delta threshold and if the EMG power was lower than its mean plus one
standard deviation. A state was classified as REM if (1) the delta power was lower
than the delta threshold, (2) the theta/delta ratio was higher than one standard
deviation above the mean, and (3) the EMG power was lower than its mean plus
one standard deviation. All remaining states were classified as wake. The wake state
thus encompassed states with high EMG power (active awake) or low delta power
but without elevated EMG activity or theta/delta ratio (quiet awake). Finally, we
manually verified the automatic classification using a custom-built graphical user
interface programmed in Matlab.
Optogenetic stimulation. We performed optogenetic activation experiments
4–6 weeks after injection of AAV-expressing ChR2. Experiments were performed
in the afternoon (1200 and 1900 hours) and lasted at least 6 h. For optogenetic
stimulation of GABAergic vlPAG neurons, each trial consisted of a 20 Hz pulse
train lasting for 300 s using a blue 473-nm laser (6–8 mW at fiber tip, Shanghai
Laser). The inter-trial interval was randomly chosen from a uniform distribution
from 15 to 25 min.
To test the role of vlPAG GABAergic neurons in REM sleep maintenance, we
applied a closed-loop stimulation protocol. Sleep/wake states were classified based
on EEG and EMG in real time. When REM sleep was detected, the laser was turned
on with 50% probability and turned off only when the REM episode ended. This
allowed comparison of the REM episode durations and the subsequent inter-REM
intervals with and without laser stimulation within the same recording session.
Transition analysis. To quantify transition probabilities between brain states, we
discretized time into 20 s bins and aligned all laser stimulation trials from all N
mice by the onset of laser stimulation at time 0.
To determine the transition probability from state X to Y for time bin i, Pi(Y|X),
we first determined the number of trials (n) in which the animal was in brain state
X during the preceding time bin i−1. Next, we identified the subset of these trials
(m) in which the animal transitioned into state Y in the current time bin i. The
transition probability Pi(Y|X) was computed as m/n. In Fig. 1d, each bar represents
the transition probability averaged across three consecutive 20 s bins. To compute
the baseline transition probabilities, we averaged across all time bins excluding the
laser stimulation period and the 2 min period following laser stimulation.
Ablation of vlPAG GABAergic neurons. To test the impact of ablating vlPAG
GABAergic neurons, we recorded the EEG and EMG of mice expressing pro-
Caspase 3 in the vlPAG, 2–3 weeks after virus injection. Each mouse was habi-
tuated for at least 1 day, and sleep–wake behavior during the light or dark cycle was
recorded for at least 2 days. For control, we recorded from mice expressing eYFP
that underwent identical procedures.
Optrode recording. To record single unit activity from vlPAG GABAergic neu-
rons, we used custom-built optrodes, consisting of 12–14 microelectrodes (Sta-
blohm 675, California Wire Company) twisted into stereotrodes or tetrodes and
attached to an optic fiber (0.2 mm diameter). The electrodes were inserted into a
screw-driven microdrive and soldered to a 2 × 10 connector. For EEG/EMG
recordings, two additional wires were attached to the connector. For stability, all
components were attached to a custom-designed circuit board (fabricated by
oshpark.com). The tips of the electrodes were electro-plated in a gold solution
(Sifco 5355) mixed with 0.1% PEG solution (Sigma). Each electrode was plated
iteratively, till reaching an impedance of 500–800 kΩ. Neurophysiological signals
were recorded using a TDT RZ5 amplifier (Tucker-Davis Technologies) at a
sampling rate of 25 kHz and bandpass filtered (0.3–8 kHz). The optrode was slowly
lowered in 50 μm steps to search for well-separated, light-responsive units.
Recordings were performed during the light cycle and lasted for at least 60 min. For
each mouse, recordings were carried out over a period of 1–2 months, starting
3 weeks after virus injection.
Before sacrificing the animal, an electrolytic lesion was made to mark the end of
the electrode tract by passing a current (100 μA, 10 s) through two electrodes.
Based on the location of the lesion and the optrode tract, the anatomical location of
each unit was reconstructed. We excluded units whose anatomical location was
outside the vlPAG.
Spike sorting. Spikes were sorted offline based on the waveform energy, the three
largest principal components for each spike waveform on each stereotrode or
tetrode channel, and a further parameter measuring for each potential unit the
distance between spontaneous and laser evoked waveforms (as quantified by the
inner product). Single units were identified either manually using the software
Klusters (http://neurosuite.sourceforge.net) or automatically using the software
KlustaKwik (http://klustakwik.sourceforge.net). Only units with a clear refractory
period in the auto-correlogram and satisfying criteria for isolation distance (>20)
and L-ratio (<0.15) were included in the data set. The median values of the
isolation distance and L-ratio for all units were 36.9 and 0.022, respectively. Two
units recorded with the same stereotrode or tetrode on different days were counted
as the same unit if their waveforms were similar, their recording depths differed by
<100 μm, and if their average firing rates were not significantly different.
Optogenetic tagging. To identify ChR2-expressing vlPAG GABAergic neurons,
high-frequency laser pulse trains (15 and 30 Hz with durations of 1 and 0.5 s,
respectively) were delivered every minute. In a subset of recordings, we presented a
0.1 or 0.2 s long step pulse instead of the 15 Hz pulse train. The recorded units were
classified into three categories (identified GABAergic units, laser-inhibited, or
laser-unmodulated units) using the following approach: First, we tested whether
the activity of each unit was significantly modulated by single laser pulses using a
previously developed statistical test (SALT)44. This method probes whether the
distribution of spike patterns (within 30 ms windows) elicited by single laser pulses
is different from spontaneous spike patterns. Second, to determine whether a
significantly modulated unit was excited or inhibited by laser stimulation, we tested
whether the average firing rate during the 30 Hz laser pulse train was significantly
increased or decreased relative to the firing rate in the 0.5 s window preceding laser
stimulation (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Finally, among those that are
excited by the laser stimulation, we identified units that followed each laser pulse

 with short first-spike latency (<10 ms) and high reliability (>0.4) as GABAergic
units. We excluded units exhibiting longer latencies or lower reliabilities. Units that
were inhibited or not significantly modulated by laser stimulation were summar-
ized as unidentified.
In total, we recorded 19 identified and 22 unidentified neurons. The low
number of unidentified neurons is likely due to a sampling bias in our recording
strategy: As the success rate for finding a driven unit in the vlPAG is generally low,
we spent the 1–2 h on recording only if we found at least one unit that appeared to
be activated by the laser pulses. As a result, most of the unidentified units were
recorded simultaneously with other laser-driven, putative GABAergic units.
Behavioral monitoring. To identify the awake behaviors during which vlPAG
GABAergic units are activated, we made video recordings (sampling rate of 5 Hz)
using a camera placed on top of the mouse cage along with the electrophysiological
signals. Active behaviors were divided into five categories: eating, grooming,
moving, running, and quiet wake. The behavioral scoring was performed manually
using a custom written graphical user interface (programmed in MATLAB).
Firing rate calculation. After spike sorting, the activity of each unit was repre-
sented as a spike train (sequences of 0 s and 1 s) with 0.67 ms time resolution. For
firing rate calculation, spike trains were downsampled to 2.5 s time bins aligned
with the brain state annotation. To reduce noise, spike trains were filtered with an
exponential kernel with a time constant of 7.5 s. To quantify the firing rate
dynamics during each sleep or wake episode, we normalized the length of each
episode by dividing it into a fixed number of bins, allowing us to average across
episodes and neurons.
Prediction of brain state transitions. To test whether the NREM activity of
vlPAG GABAergic neurons is predictive of whether the animal will transition to
REM sleep or wakefulness, we performed a classification analysis. Using Fisher’s
linear discriminant, we tested how well the future brain state (REM or wake) can be
predicted from the neural activity in each 10 s bin from 0 to 60 s before the actual
transition. The data set used for classification included the neural activities
recorded up to 60 s before the transition. As the trials with NREM→Wake tran-
sitions outnumbered NREM→REM trials, we balanced the data set to avoid sys-
tematic prediction biases. The resulting data set included all NREM→REM trials
and an equal number of randomly selected NREM→wake trials. To quantify the
prediction accuracy, we performed a 10-fold cross-validation: The data set was
randomly divided into 10 training and test sets, each comprising 90 and 10% of the
trials, respectively. The classifier was trained on the training sets (comprising all
time bins preceding the transition), and its performance was evaluated at each time
bin using the test sets. The resulting accuracy value quantified how well, in average,
the future transition can be predicted from the activity of a single neuron. Con-
fidence intervals and P-values were calculated using bootstrapping by repeating the
cross-validation procedure 100 times.
Calcium imaging. Calcium imaging experiments were performed 3–8 weeks fol-
lowing injection of AAV-expressing GCaMP6. Imaging sessions took place during
the light cycle in the home cage placed within a sound-attenuated chamber. The
animal was briefly anesthetized with isoflurane to secure the microscope to the
baseplate and to focus it to a given field of view. The animal was then allowed to
recover from anesthesia and habituate in the home cage for at least 30 min prior to
imaging. Calcium activity was acquired using the nVista hardware and nVista HD
software (Inscopix), with a 10 Hz image acquisition rate using 0.2–0.7 mW illu-
mination. An Intan RHA2000 system (Intan Technologies) was used to simulta-
neously record EEG and EMG activity (bandpass filter, 1–750 Hz; sampling rate,
25 kHz). An output signal (20 Hz) delivered from the Inscopix system to the Intan
system throughout the recording session was used to synchronize the timing
between the imaging and EEG/EMG recordings. Recording sessions lasted between
40 and 110 min and were repeated up to 6 times per animal, spanning across 5
different days.
Calcium imaging analysis. Imaging data were processed in Python and Matlab
(Mathworks). First, the acquired images were spatially downsampled by a factor of
4. To correct for lateral motion of the brain relative to the GRIN lens, we applied an
algorithm based on a previous study45. We created a high-pass filtered image stack
by calculating the difference between the image stack and a spatially low-pass
filtered version of the image stack. A high-contrast region of the mean projection of
the high-pass filtered image stack was selected as a reference. The spatial shift that
maximized the cross-correlation between the reference region and each frame of
the high-pass filtered image stack was calculated to obtain the motion corrected
images.
Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected using a graphical user interface
(programmed in Python) by manually identifying cell-body-sized regions with
fluorescence activity across time and defining the coordinates of a polygon that
contains the pixels of the ROI. The pixel intensities within each ROI were averaged
to create a fluorescence time-series. In cases where the same ROI was identified
across imaging sessions, the ROI was grouped together for analysis.
To correct for contamination of the fluorescence signal by out-of-focus
neuropil, we calculated the neighboring neuropil signal, Fneuropil, from a bordering
concentric ring with 20 μm distance from the perimeter of each ROI, excluding
other ROIs, and subtracted Fneuropil, scaled by a correction factor, cf, from the raw
ROI signal, Fraw (Fneuropil-subracted = Fraw − cf × Fneuropil). The cf for each recording
session was estimated by calculating the ratio between the mean pixel intensity of a
manually selected blood vessel, Fblood vessel, and a nearby region lacking an ROI
signal, Fnear blood vessel(no ROI), each subtracted by the mean pixel intensity of an off-
lens region, Foff-lens (cf = [Fblood vessel − Foff-lens]/[Fnear blood vessel(no ROI) − Foff-lens]).
In cases where a blood vessel was not clearly present, the mean value obtained from
other animals, cf = 0.55, was used.
The baseline of each neuropil-subtracted fluorescence time-series was estimated
by calculating the best linear fit using periods of low fluorescence activity,
represented by the 20th percentile of each recording session. Slope values were
typically smaller than zero and thus allowed compensating for a drift in the
fluorescence signal due to photobleaching of GCaMP.
Statistics. For optogenetic and ablation experiments, GAD2-Cre mice were ran-
domly assigned to control (injected with AAV-expressing eYFP) and experimental
groups (injected with AAV-expressing ChR2-eYFP or Casp3). No randomization
was used for rabies-mediated trans-synaptic tracing. Investigators were not blinded
to animal identity and outcome assessment.
All statistical tests (paired t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Wilcoxon signed-
rank test, bootstrap) were two-sided. For both paired and unpaired tests, we
ensured that the variances of the data were similar between the compared groups.
For t-tests, we verified that the data were normally distributed using Lilliefors test
for normality.
The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for brain state percentages and transition
probabilities (Figs. 1c, d and 2b) were calculated using a bootstrap procedure. For
an experimental group of n mice, we calculated the CI as follows: we repeatedly
resampled the data by randomly drawing for each mouse p trials (random sampling
with replacement). For each of the m iterations, we recalculated the mean brain
state percentages or transition probabilities across the n mice. The lower and upper
CIs were then extracted from the distribution of the m resampled mean values. To
test whether a given brain state or transition probability was significantly
modulated by laser stimulation, we calculated for each bootstrap iteration the
difference between the averaged brain state percentages or transition probabilities
during laser stimulation and the corresponding baseline values for periods without
laser stimulation. From the resulting distribution of difference values, we then
calculated a P-value to assess whether laser stimulation significantly modulated
brain states or transitions between brain states.
Sample sizes. For optogenetic activation experiments, cell-type-specific ablation
experiments, and in vivo recordings (optrode recordings and calcium imaging), we
continuously increased the number of animals until statistical significance was
reached to support our conclusions. For rabies-mediated and anterograde tracing
experiments, the selection of the sample size was based on numbers reported in
previous studies. For optrode recordings, we first recorded a preliminary data set of
six units from two mice. Based on analysis of this data set and given the success
rate in finding identified GABAergic units, we predicted that about 20 units are
sufficient to statistically support our conclusions.
