Agrp neuron activity is required for alcohol-induced
overeating
Sarah Cains1,*, Craig Blomeley1,*, Mihaly Kollo2, Romeo Ra

Alcohol intake associates with overeating in humans. This overeating is a clinical concern, but
its causes are puzzling, because alcohol (ethanol) is a calorie-dense nutrient, and
calorie intake usually suppresses brain appetite signals. The biological factors necessary for
ethanol-induced overeating remain unclear, and societal causes have been proposed. Here we
show that core elements of the brain’s feeding circuits—the hypothalamic Agrp neurons that
are normally activated by starvation and evoke intense hunger—display electrical and
biochemical hyperactivity on exposure to dietary doses of ethanol in brain slices.
Furthermore, by circuit-specific chemogenetic interference in vivo, we find that the Agrp
cell activity is essential for ethanol-induced overeating in the absence of societal factors, in
single-housed mice. These data reveal how a widely consumed nutrient can paradoxically
sustain brain starvation signals, and identify a biological factor required for appetite evoked by
alcohol.

rinking an ape
´ritif to stimulate appetite has been
mentioned as a human practice since at least the 5th
century AD1. Modern studies confirm that alcohol intake
acutely stimulates eating, and correlates with obesity2–6. Due to
the rising incidence of obesity and its co-morbidities, the link
between alcohol intake and overeating is becoming a recognized
clinical concern2–4. Popular explanations for alcohol-induced
overeating include an alcohol-induced loss of self-control, leading
to a disregard for societal constraints on eating4,6,7. Biological
factors required for alcohol-induced overeating remain elusive2–4.
In
homoeostatic
models
of
eating
control,
the
brain’s
appetite-stimulating
signals
are
negatively
regulated
by
nutrients8–11. An essential eating-stimulating signal is provided
by Agrp neurons, a starvation-activated, molecularly distinct
hypothalamic cell type12,13. The Agrp cells are found in mice and
humans, and their chemogenetic or optogenetic stimulation
is sufficient to cause rapid overeating, even in the absence of
energy shortage14–17. Such eating despite energy sufficiency
resembles the nutritionally paradoxical nature of alcohol-induced
overeating. Although ethanol (EtOH, the active ingredient in
alcoholic beverages) is the second most calorie-dense nutrient
after fat, it stimulates rather than inhibits eating2–4. This suggests
that EtOH creates a hunger state, but does not resolve whether
EtOH highjacks normal homoeostatic signals of starvation, or
evokes a different (for example, hedonic) hunger. Causal links
between EtOH-induced overeating and brain hunger signals
remain elusive. Establishing such a link would require a
demonstration that EtOH-induced overeating is prevented by a
selective interference with a molecularly defined hunger pathway.
Most molecular pathways associated with human obesity reside
in the brain18, and are conserved in lower animals. Therefore, we
hypothesized that EtOH may stimulate eating across species by
distorting brain hunger signals. Here we probed this by: (1)
determining EtOH impact on natural eating of animals isolated
from social pressures, (2) examining EtOH action on genetically
defined hunger signals and (3) establishing causality between
specific hunger signals and EtOH-induced overeating. We present
results suggesting that, in mice, EtOH sustains the activity of
eating-stimulating hypothalamic Agrp cells, and Agrp cell activity
is required for eating stimulation by EtOH.
Results
Effect of EtOH on food intake in mice. First, to test if
EtOH-induced overeating occurs in non-human mammals, we
examined the effects of EtOH on food intake of mice. We used
single-housed mice to minimize social confounders, male and
female mice to examine gender differences, and intraperitoneal
(i.p.) administration of EtOH for precise dosage and to remove
taste confounders. In an ‘alcoholic weekend’ experiment, each
animal was given EtOH for three days, and saline for 3 days
before and after (see Methods for consideration of EtOH dosage).
The food intake was significantly and reversibly increased on the
EtOH days, and the magnitude of this increase was similar in
males and females (Fig. 1a,b; statistics are given in the figure
legends). The effect of EtOH on food intake was also apparent at
finer (hourly) time points (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Fig. 2). These
data suggest that alcohol-induced overeating is an evolutionarily
conserved biological phenomenon occurring across mammals,
irrespective of aesthetic beliefs and social conditioning.
Effect of EtOH on hypothalamic Agrp cells. Second, we sought
to establish whether EtOH rapidly modulates endogenous hunger
signals. To test if Agrp cell activity is modulated by EtOH, we
injected a Cre-inducible ultrasensitive calcium activity reporter
GCaMP6s (ref. 19) into the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus of Agrp-
Cre mice (Fig. 2a; Methods). Subsequent imaging of the Agrp-
GCaMP6s network in brains slices revealed rapid, dose-dependent
and reversible EtOH-induced activation of Agrp neurons (Fig. 2b,c).
After i.p. injection of EtOH concentrations similar to those used in
our in vivo experiments, deep brain EtOH concentrations have been
measured to reach 30–80mM in rodents20–23 (see ‘Ethanol dosage’
in Methods for further discussion). We found that such EtOH
concentrations produced similar Agrp cell activation (E40%
cytosolic calcium elevation, Fig. 2c) to that caused by fasting or
physiological hunger hormones24.
The calcium liberation implies activation of biochemical
cascades in neurons25, but does not directly prove that the
electrical spiking of Agrp neurons, the signal driving eating16, is
increased. Thus, we also examined the electrical activity and
membrane currents of Agrp cells in brain slices. In cell-attached
electrical recordings (Methods), EtOH acutely and reversibly
accelerated Agrp cell spiking (Fig. 3a). Similar effects were
seen
in
whole-cell
membrane
potential
recordings
under
pharmacological synaptic isolation (Fig. 3b,c), consistent with a
direct postsynaptic action of EtOH. In contrast, non-Agrp arcuate

 neurons (that is, putative satiety cells16) were not excited by
EtOH (Supplementary Fig. 1A). While this suggests a degree of
cell-type selectivity of EtOH actions in the arcuate, we note that
the unidirectional inhibition of satiety cells by hunger cells26,27
implies that such selectivity may not be critical for increasing
eating (Discussion).
We next addressed mechanisms of the EtOH-induced excita-
tion. Membrane potential recordings revealed that EtOH-induced
excitation
involves
membrane
depolarization
and
increased
conductance (Fig. 3b,c). Whole-cell current–voltage relations
further showed that this conductance increase is due to an
EtOH-activated non-selective ionic current (Fig. 3d, equilibrium
potential ¼ � 32±3.1 mV; n ¼ 7 cells). Buffering cytosolic Ca2 þ
increases by 10 mM BAPTA in the pipette solution abolished
EtOH-induced excitatory actions (Fig. 3e), suggesting that a rise in
cytosolic calcium is required for EtOH action. Cytosolic calcium
elevations can activate plasmalemmal 3Na þ/Ca2 þ exchanger
(NCX), which can trigger membrane depolarization and excitation
due to NCX electrogenicity28–32. Thus, we tested whether EtOH-
induced excitation of Agrp neurons requires this transporter. Bath
application of the selective NCX inhibitor KB-R7943 (refs 31,33)
prevented EtOH-induced excitation (Fig. 3f). Together, these data
suggest that EtOH-induced excitation of Agrp cell membrane is
mediated by cytosolic calcium signals and plasmalemmal NCX
activity. Overall, these data demonstrate that EtOH evokes a
functional remodelling in the brain’s biophysical generators of
hunger drive, thereby sustaining false ‘starvation alarms’ despite
extracellular nutrient sufficiency.
Effect of Agrp cell silencing on EtOH-induced eating. Third,
to
investigate
whether
Agrp
cell
activity
is
required
for
EtOH-induced
overeating,
we
targeted
Cre-dependent
neuroinhibitory receptor hM4Di, or control protein ChR2-
mCherry,
to
Agrp
neurons
in
Agrp-Cre
mice
(Fig.
4a;
Supplementary
Fig.
1B).
This
made
it
possible
to
block
Agrp-hM4Di
neuron
spiking
by
the
physiologically
inert
hM4Di
receptor
ligand
CNO
(Fig.
4b,c).
The
CNO
concentrations we used did not affect spiking of Agrp-ChR2
neurons (Supplementary Fig. 1B), nor eating in mice not
expressing hM4Di (Supplementary Fig. 1C,D), confirming that
CNO did not modulate the parameters under study without
hM4Di. In the absence of CNO, EtOH increased food intake in
mice with Agrp-hM4Di or Agrp-ChR2 neurons, (Fig. 4d),
confirming that transgene expression per se does not prevent
ethanol-associated eating. We then gave all mice CNO, to
suppress Agrp neurons of Agrp-hM4Di mice. Under this
condition, eating of Agrp-hM4Di mice is reduced (Fig. 4d), as
previously
reported17,
but—importantly—despite
this
lower
baseline, eating stimulation remains possible by eating-control
neurons downstream of Agrp34. However, despite this existence
of neurons that can increase eating in the absence of Agrp34,35, we
found that in the presence of CNO, EtOH no longer stimulated
food intake of Agrp-hM4Di mice (but stimulated it normally in
control Agrp-ChR2 mice, Fig. 4d, left plot). While these findings
do not preclude EtOH actions on targets other than Agrp, they do
imply that such actions are insufficient to cause eating without
Agrp cell activity.
Finally, we analysed whether EtOH controls the contribution
of
the
natural
activity
of
Agrp
cells
to
eating
in
vivo.
We hypothesized that if EtOH-activated Agrp neurons in vivo
(as predicted by in vitro data, Figs 2 and 3), then EtOH should
increase Agrp cell-dependent eating. Because CNO silences
Agrp-hM4Di cells (Fig. 4b,c), the magnitude of the CNO effect
on eating in Agrp-hM4Di mice reflects Agrp cell-mediated eating,
that is, in vivo Agrp cell activity (if Agrp cell activity is low, its
silencing will have a small effect on eating, and if Agrp cell
activity is high, its silencing would have a large effect). We found
that the effects of CNO on eating in Agrp-hM4Di mice were
significantly greater in the presence of EtOH (Fig. 4d, right plot),
consistent
with
the
idea
that
EtOH
increases
Agrp
cell
contribution to eating in vivo (Discussion).
Together, these data identify Agrp cell activity as a critical
process required for the EtOH action on food intake.
Discussion
Agrp cell activity potently increases motivation for feeding, and
has been called a neural correlate of hunger17. Thus our
data suggests that alcohol sustains fundamental appetite signals,
not just disinhibits their behavioural manifestation. Apart
from the Agrp cells, other powerful controllers of food intake
exist
in
the
brain,
for
example,
MC4R
neurons
of
the
paraventricular hypothalamus36, Vgat neurons of the lateral
hypothalamus37 and neurons of the parabrachial nucleus34.
Crucially, the control of feeding by some of these modules
does not require Agrp neurons35. Therefore, alcohol actions on
the latter non-Agrp eating controllers would be expected to
alter eating even when Agrp cells are silenced. However, we found
that when Agrp cells were chemogenetically silenced, alcohol
no loger modulated food intake. Thus, we propose that the
alcohol-associated activity of Agrp neurons—mediated either by
direct alcohol actions described here, or via a still-unknown
upstream
element—is
the
critical
step
in
alcohol-induced
overeating.
There are previous reports of ethanol actions on diverse
cellular targets, including eating-regulating systems such as
midbrain dopamine neurons, and on diverse and ubiquitously

 expressed molecular targets, such as neuronal GABA and NMDA
receptors38–42. We believe that these previous reports are
compatible with our findings and conclusions. First, our finding
that the Agrp cells are an essential locus of alcohol-induced
eating does rule out that there are other sites in the brain, where
alcohol can plausibly influence eating. Second, similar to previous
studies of other neurons, we found that ethanol acts on Agrp
neurons by modulating fairly ubiquitous molecular operators
(calcium and NCX), rather than a process that is unique to Agrp
cells. We propose that this lack of specificity at the cellular and
molecular levels is compatible with a specific action at the
whole-system level, due to the non-random, directed interactions
between different neuronal controllers of behaviour43. Non-
random neuronal connectivity has been reported throughout the
brain43, including appetite systems (for example, Agrp cells
inhibit POMC cells but not vice versa27). Such a unidirectional
network connectivity would ‘filter’ non-selective actions at the
cellular/molecular levels (for example, direct ethanol-induced
excitation of both hunger and satiety cells) into a behaviour-
selective action (that is, eating versus non-eating) at the system
output level. Testing this proposal by developing tools for
disrupting directed connectivity, in conjunction with cell-type
specific in vivo recordings, is an interesting direction for future
work, especially considering that Agrp neurons can be modulated
differently in vitro and in vivo.
Overall, our findings provide an explanation for how a
commonly consumed nutrient may generate a positive feedback
on energy intake, offering new mechanistic and conceptual
insights into pathological overeating behaviour linked to morbid
disorders.

 Methods
Animals and feeding studies. All animal procedures followed United Kingdom
regulations (Animals, Scientific Procedures Act 1986) and were approved by local
welfare committees and veterinarians. Adult (10–12-week old) male and female
mice on the C57/BL6 background were used for all experiments.
For experiments involving transgene expression in Agrp neurons, we used,
where indicated, two previously described and characterized transgenic mouse
lines: Agrp-IRES-Cre (Jax no. 012899 (ref. 44)) and NPY-hrGFP (Jax no. 006417
(ref. 45)). Mice were kept on a standard 12 h light–dark cycle (lights on at 7:00),
and on standard mouse chow (LabDiet 5021) and water ad libitum. Room
temperature was kept at 22 �C. During food intake measurements, the chow was
provided in ‘anti-spill’ cylindrical hoppers (TSE Systems). In Fig. 1a,b,d,
measurements were performed in home cages by lowering the hoppers onto cage
floor through a modified cage lid, and food intake was measured daily by manual
weighing of the hoppers. In Fig. 1c, food was weighed automatically in suspended-
hopper cages (TSE PhenoMaster) equipped with custom-elevated floors (with
openings to maintain hopper suspension) that brought food closer to the floor to
facilitate access despite potential ethanol-induced motor incoordination46. When
placed in unfamiliar cages, mice were allowed to acclimatize for at least one week
before measurements.
Drugs (EtOH 2 g kg � 1, CNO 5 mg kg � 1) were sterile-filtered and injected i.p.
at 12.65 ml g � 1 total volume (0.9% NaCl saline was used as vehicle). Control
i.p. injections contained saline only (12.65 ml g � 1). Mice were injected at 19:00
(the beginning of the dark phase) and subsequent eating was measured by weighing
the food consumed at different times after injection. In an alternative experimental
design (which produced similar data to the main findings), mice received a single
1 g kg � 1 EtOH i.p. injection at 16:00 and food intake was monitored using
standard TSE Phenomaster cages (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Ethanol dosage. For in vivo experiments, we used EtOH doses of 2 g kg � 1 in
Figs 1 and 4, and 1 g kg � 1 in Supplementary Fig. 2; for in vitro experiments, we
used 10–100 mM EtOH. These doses were based on the following considerations.
First, the i.p. EtOH doses we used are compatible with studies of mouse
behaviour47, and have been reported to elevate deep brain EtOH concentrations to
20–80 mM in rodents in vivo20–23, which we here mimicked in brain slices.
We confirmed these reports of deep brain ethanol elevations using a custom EtOH
sensor in the arcuate nucleus (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Second, these doses resemble those relevant for humans (after correcting for
body weight). Specifically, these doses would approximately represent the amounts
reported to be consumed by 27% of young UK people at least once per week
(418 units alcohol, according to a UK government survey for 2012:

unit contains 8 g EtOH, the 18 units consumed by a 70 kg human equates to an
ethanol dose of 2.06 g kg � 1. The blood EtOH concentration of a 70 kg human male
was estimated (Widmark formula) to be B50 mM after consuming the 18 units of
alcohol. Since EtOH readily crosses membranes and rapidly equilibrates across the
blood–brain barrier, similar EtOH concentrations occur in the blood and the brain,
and in different brain regions20,23.
Network activity imaging. For calcium imaging of Agrp cell activity, AAVs
carrying Cre-dependent GCamp6s (rAAV9.CAG.Flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40; titre
2.74 � 1013 gc ml � 1, Penn Vector Core) were stereotaxically injected into the
arcuate nucleus of the Agrp-Cre mice. Two 100 nl injections of the GCaMP6s virus
were made at: � 1.4 mm from Bregma; ±0.3 mm from midline; and � 5.80 and
� 5.70 mm from skull surface. Cre dependency of viral expression was confirmed
by injections of the Cre-dependent AAV into the brains of Cre-negative mice
(n ¼ 3 mice). Acute coronal brain slices were prepared 10–14 days after AAV
injection, and confocal imaging and analysis of GCaMP6s signals was performed as
previously described48.
Single-neuron electrophysiology. Acute coronal brain slices were prepared and
cell-attached and whole-cell recordings performed as previously described49.
Briefly, fluorescent neurons were visualized an upright Olympus BX51WI
microscope equipped with an oblique condenser, a xenon lamp and appropriate
filter sets. Somatic recordings were carried out at 37 �C using a HEKA EPC 10 USB
patch-clamp amplifier controlled by Patchmaster software (HEKA Elektronik,
Germany), after slices were allowed to equilibrate in the recording chamber for
10–15 min. Arcuate Agrp neurons were identified for slice electrical recordings
using either Cre-dependent fluorescent transgenes in Agrp-Cre mice
(hD4Di-mCherry, ChR2-mCherry); or NPY-hrGFP mice since all NPY expression
in arcuate neurons co-localizes with Agrp50.
Chemogenetics. To target the CNO-activated inhibitory receptor hM4Di to Agrp
cells17,51, Cre-dependent AAV (rAAV8/hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry; titre
5.30 � 1012 gc ml � 1, Penn Vector Core) was stereotaxically injected into the
arcuate hypothalamus of the Agrp-Cre transgenic mice. Two 100 nl injections of
rAAV8/hSyn-DIO-hm4(Gi)-mCherry or a control Cre-dependent protein
(AAV2/EF1a-DIO-ChR2(E123T/T159C)-mCherry, 7.3 � 1012 gc ml � 1, UNC
Vector Core) were made at: � 1.4 mm from bregma; ±0.3 mm from midline; and
� 5.80 and � 5.70 mm from skull surface. Agrp-Cre mice were first injected with
saline during the first 3 days (12.65 ml g � 1 body weight, i.p.) at dark onset. They
were then supplied with a single dose of CNO (5 mg kg � 1 body weight in saline
i.p.) at dark onset during the next 3 days.
Drugs and solutions. EtOH (absolute analytical reagent grade) was from Fisher
Scientific. CNO and KB-R7943 were from Tocris Bioscience. For synaptic isolation,
we used CNQX 10mM, TTX 1mM, and D-AP5 50 mM (Sigma Aldrich UK) and PTX
50mM (Tocris Bioscience). All other drugs were from Sigma. Artificial cerebrospinal
fluid was gassed continuously with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and contained the following (in
mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 21 NaHCO3, 1 D-( þ )-
glucose. For whole-cell recordings, patch-clamp pipettes were filled with intracellular
solution containing the following (in mM): 120 K-Gluc, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.1
EGTA, 4 K2ATP, 2 Na2ATP, 0.3 Na2GTP, 2MgCl2, pH 7.3 with KOH.
In Fig. 3, KB-R7943 was applied extracellularly and 10 mM BAPTA was applied
intracellularly, as in ref. 32.
Immunohistochemistry. To confirm hM4Di-mCherry transgene targeting to the
arcuate nucleus, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and dissected
brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution for a minimum of 48 h.
Free floating cryosections (50 mM) of the arcuate nucleus and cell nuclei were
counterstained with Hoescht.
Statistical analyses. Statistical tests and descriptive statistics were performed as
described in the figure legends. In general, we found that 20–30% of Agrp neurons
did not respond to EtOH application in our in vitro preparation (for example, see
Fig. 2b); these non-responding cells were included in group analysis of calcium
responses to assess net effect of EtOH on all Agrp neurons (Fig. 2c), but excluded
from group quantification of electrical responses to measure EtOH response size at
the level of individual cells (Fig. 3a–d). In parametric tests, normality was assessed
with Shapiro–Wilk, Lilliefors, Anderson–Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
tests, and variances were assessed for homogeneity using Levene’s, Brown–Forsyth
and F-tests. The analysis was performed using Origin 2015 (OriginLab) or
GraphPad Prism 6.
