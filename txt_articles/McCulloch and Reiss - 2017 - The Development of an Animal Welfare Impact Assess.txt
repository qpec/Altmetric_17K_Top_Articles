Abstract Bovine tuberculosis (bovine TB) is a controversial animal health policy
issue in England, which impacts farmers, the public, cattle and badgers. Badgers
(Meles meles) act as a wildlife reservoir of disease. Policy options for badger control
include (1) do nothing, (2) badger culling, and (3) badger vaccination. This paper
argues for mandatory Animal Welfare Impact Assessment (AWIA) for all policy that
significantly affects sentient animals. AWIA includes (1) species description, and (2)
AWIA analysis stages. In this paper, AWIA is applied to impacts of bovine TB policy
options on cattle and badgers. Over 4 years, 85,000 badgers will be culled to prevent
the slaughter of *17,750 cattle over 9 years. Hence, about five badgers are culled for
every cow which avoids slaughter. The AWIA analyses the impact of badger vacci-
nation on cows and badgers based on a set of stated assumptions. The AWIA estimates
badger vaccination to reduce the number of cows slaughtered by 11,600, i.e. a 12.5%
reduction. Additional to the harm of killing, culling has greater welfare impacts on
badgers compared to non-culling options. Actors in animal health and welfare policy
were interviewed about the concept of AWIA. Policy actors supported the idea of
AWIA to provide objective data to feed into policy making. The paper concludes with
the proposal that AWIA is a necessary stage of just policy making where sentient
animals are impacted by government policy.

 Introduction
The objectives of this paper are threefold. First, the paper argues for the inclusion of
a mandatory formal and systematic process to assess the impacts of public policy on
sentient animals. We propose and describe an Animal Welfare Impact Assessment
(AWIA) tool to fulfill this role. Secondly, we apply AWIA to bovine tuberculosis
(TB) policy, which is an economically important and controversial policy issue in
England. Thirdly, we describe how animal health and welfare policy actors view the
concept of AWIA, based on semi-structured interviewing of policy elites.
The Justification for Animal Welfare Impact Assessment in Government
Policy Making
Animal health and welfare policy issues have the potential to cause considerable
controversy in society. Prominent examples in the UK include foot and mouth
disease, intensive farming methods and bovine tuberculosis control. Animal welfare
legislation, such as the UK Animal Welfare Act 2006, has been enacted to protect
the interests of sentient animals. Despite this, policymaking processes which impact
animals are less stringent than those to appraise impacts on human society. In
government, policy options are routinely appraised for impacts on humans and the
environment by a number of formal impact assessments. These include Social
Impact Assessment (SIA), Health Impact Assessment (HIA) and Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA). Economic Impact Assessment (EIA) is conducted for all
policy to evaluate the economic costs and benefits of policy options (BIS
2011a, 2011b).
This paper argues for the adoption of a mandatory Animal Welfare Impact
Assessment (AWIA) for all policy that significantly impacts sentient animals. We
propose three arguments to support the use of mandatory AWIA:
i.
Sentiency grounds moral consideration.
Sentient animals have a subjective experiential life that can go well or badly
(Dawkins 2006; DeGrazia 1996; Duncan 2006). Depending on their situation,
sentient animals can experience a good life or can experience suffering (FAWC
2009a). Sentiency is the ultimate ground for animal welfare legislation to protect
animals’ interests.
ii.
To represent public concern about sentient animals.
The UK is a liberal democratic nation state and has a proud history as a leader in the
compassionate treatment of animals (Radford 2001; Ryder 2000).1 The British
public consistently demonstrates concern about the treatment of nonhuman sentient
1 For instance, Elizabeth Truss, Secretary of State for Defra, stated ‘‘I am proud that our food is produced
to world-leading standards of quality, safety, traceability and animal welfare’’ (Truss 2015).

 species.2 A legitimate democratic government should represent the interests and
values of its citizens. Hence, democratic governments should have policymaking
processes that accounts for the legitimate concerns and justified moral values of its
citizens. The AWIA is a robust mechanism whereby government can demonstrate it
is accounting for animals’ interests in policy making.
iii.
Animal Welfare Impact Assessment is entailed by the Treaty of Lisbon.
The Treaty of Lisbon 2009 amends the founding Treaty of the European Union.
Article 13 of the Treaty of Lisbon states the following:
In formulating and implementing the Union’s agriculture, fisheries, transport,
internal market, research and technological development and space policies,
the Union and the Member States shall, since animals are sentient beings, pay
full regard to the welfare requirements of animals, while respecting the
legislative or administrative provisions and customs of the Member States
relating in particular to religious rites, cultural traditions and regional heritage.
We argue here that member states cannot pay full regard to animal welfare if there is
no formal and systematic government policy process to facilitate this.3 The AWIA
is such a formal and systematic process to account for the interests of sentient
animals.
Animal Welfare Impact Assessment: A Systematic Three-Stage Process
AWIA should be conducted by government experts for all policy options that have
the potential to significantly impact the interests of sentient animals. We
recommend a three-stage process. Stage 1 is a species description for each species
impacted by policy options. The data collected in the species description have the
potential to be morally relevant and influence government decision making. Stage 2
is a harms and benefits list of impacts for all affected species for all policy options
under review. Stage 3 is the AWIA analysis stage, which again is conducted for
each policy option and each species impacted. The AWIA process is illustrated in
Fig. 1.
2 For instance, in interview, a Defra civil servant reported that the department’s largest postbag has been
on animal welfare issues for the last 15–20 years [Civil servant, AHVLA]. Public consultations, for
instance on bovine TB and badger culling (Defra 2006b), consistently receive high response rates, which
are supportive of progressive animal welfare policies. The government also regularly receives petitions on
animal health and welfare issues, for instance on bovine TB and badger culling (HM Gov 2013).
3 In 2016, the British public voted in a referendum to leave the EU and at the time of writing (July 2017)
it is the stated policy of the Westminster government to implement ‘Brexit’. Nevertheless, the UK
currently remains an EU member state. Additionally, we would argue that regardless of the UK’s status
with respect to the EU, mandatory AWIA is justified by the ‘sentiency’ and ‘democratic’ arguments
outlined in (i) and (ii) in the main text above.

 Bovine TB policy in Britain
Bovine TB has been described as the most important animal health policy issue in
Britain (Defra 2011c; Reynolds 2006).4 The disease, which affects cattle, badgers
and other species, is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium bovis. Policy on bovine
TB has caused considerable controversy, both in the scientific community (Bateson
et al. 2012; Boyd and Gibbens 2012) and the wider public (HM Gov 2013). Policy is
particularly controversial because of the Westminster government’s policy to cull
badgers as part of a package of control measures to reduce and ultimately eradicate
bovine TB. Spencer has described how England, Wales and Scotland have three
different policies to account for the role of badgers in bovine TB (Spencer 2011).5
Whereas policy in England is to cull badgers in high incidence areas, the Welsh
Assembly has followed a badger vaccination policy.6 Scotland is officially bovine
TB free, and thus neither culls nor vaccinates badgers. The discussion in this section
and the AWIA analysis in the following section refer to badger control in England,
as determined by the Westminster government.

5 The different policies arise principally because animal health and welfare is a devolved policy area.
Defra is the department responsible for bovine TB policy in England.
6 In October 2016, the Welsh government announced plans that may include the cage-trapping and
culling of M. bovis-infected badgers on chronically infected cattle farms (Messenger 2016). The measure
is in part due to the global shortage of the BCG vaccine.

 In 1997, the Conservative government commissioned a review of the evidence
base on the contribution of badgers to bovine TB in cattle. The review, chaired by
Professor John Krebs,7 found the evidence base to be insufficient to draw firm
conclusions. It recommended a randomised controlled field trial to assess the impact
of badger culling on bovine TB incidence in cattle (Krebs et al. 1997). The 1997
Labour government set up the Independent Scientific Group (ISG), chaired by
Professor John Bourne, to conduct the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT).
In its Final report, the ISG recommended against badger culling, and advised that
bovine TB could be controlled and ultimately eradicated by cattle-based measures
alone (Bourne et al. 2007). The government asked its Chief Scientist Advisor, Sir
David King, to review the ISG’s RBCT findings. The King review concluded that
badger culling could indeed contribute to reducing bovine TB in cattle, provided
certain measures were taken (King 2007). Despite King’s report, Hilary Benn, the
then Labour Secretary of State for Defra, announced in 2008 that the government
would not follow a badger culling policy.
In 2010, the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Parties formed a Coalition
Government. The Conservative Party, which was the dominant coalition partner,
had a badger culling policy in its election manifesto. A badger culling policy was
written into the Coalition Agreement (HM Gov 2010), and the government
consulted on a farmer and landowner-led badger culling policy in the same year
(Defra 2010a).
The Pilot Badger Culls in England
After delays due to the 2012 London Olympic Games, a legal challenge brought by
the Badger Trust in the High Court and problems estimating badger numbers, two
pilot badger culls were conducted in Somerset and Gloucestershire between October
and December 2013. The culls were licensed for 4 years by Natural England under
the Protection of Badgers Act 1992. The culls in both Somerset and Gloucestershire
failed to achieve the target to cull 70% of badgers in six weeks, and both areas were
granted significant extensions to their culling licences. Furthermore, the Indepen-
dent Expert Panel (IEP) reported that 7.4–22.8% of badgers took over 5 min to die
after being shot, which failed the government’s test of this figure being under five
percent (IEP 2014). The IEG was disbanded after its 2014 report on the pilot culls in
Somerset and Gloucestershire in 2013, with Defra monitoring the subsequent culls.
Badger culling has continued annually in the Somerset and Gloucestershire
zones, with 2016 being the fourth year of culling. Natural England granted a culling
licence to an area in north Dorset in 2015, and a further seven licences have been
granted for new areas in Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, Cornwall, Devon and
Dorset in 2016 (BBC 2016; Defra 2016b). The following section applies AWIA to
bovine TB and badger control in England. The analysis uses data from a Natural
England report advising Defra on the impact of culling on badger populations in
England (Natural England 2011). The data in the Natural England report includes
estimates on the impact of culling on bovine TB incidence in cattle, as well as

 figures for the numbers of badgers culled. Bovine TB and badger control policy is
discussed further in McCulloch and Reiss (2017a).
Animal Welfare Impact Assessment (AWIA) of Bovine TB and Badger
Control Policy Options
This section applies AWIA to bovine TB and badger control policy. Three policy
options are assessed:
(i)
Do nothing.
(ii)
Badger culling.
(iii)
Badger vaccination.

 AWIA Analyses
The AWIA analyses for the three policy options are found in Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and
8.8 Much of the data in the AWIA analysis tables are taken directly or extrapolated
from a Natural England9 report documenting impacts of badger culling on the
badger population (Natural England 2011). Based on the Natural England report, the
badger population in England is considered to be 220,000 (Natural England 2011).
The AWIA analysis for badger culling is based on achieving a 19% reduction in
bovine TB in cattle. The number of badgers to be culled (85,000) is taken from the
Natural England report, which assumes the granting of 33 cull licences using an

9 Natural England is a non-departmental public body (NDPB) sponsored by Defra. Its role is to advise the
government on protecting nature for the public benefit. In the context of bovine TB policy, a principal
concern of the Natural England 2011 report was to ensure that culling would not cause the local extinction
of badger populations, which would be in contravention of Articles 8 and 9 of the Bern Convention.

 average control area of 350 km2 over a four year period.10 The 19% figure was
proposed by the farming industry. It is based on the meeting of experts that was
hosted by Defra to arrive at some consensus about the impact of badger culling,
after the contradictory recommendations of the ISG and the King review. The 19%
figure is larger than that the 12.4–16% reduction11 agreed at the meeting of experts,
itself based on the RBCT, because the culling areas are larger (350 km2) than those
used in the RBCT (150 km2).12
The AWIA analyses compare impacts on cattle over a policy timeframe of
9 years. The impacts on badgers are based on the four year cull at the beginning of
the 9 years. Natural England states that 4 years is the minimum cull period, but is
expected to be the norm (Natural England 2011, p. 5).13 Hence, since the AWIA
analyses assess impacts on badgers for the 4 years of culling, this may
underestimate the impacts on badgers, especially if culling licences are extended
beyond 4 years. Indeed, in his report after the fourth year of culling in Somerset and
Gloucestershire, the CVO recommends further annual culling to maintain the badger
population at the suppressed level (Defra 2016a).
The ISG reported that 15% of road-killed badgers were infected with M. bovis.
The prevalence was 16.6% in proactive cull areas (Bourne et al. 2007, pp. 74–76).
Based on ISG data, Jenkins et al. report that 14% of badgers in proactive cull areas
were tuberculous (Jenkins et al. 2008, p. 1530). Jenkins et al. have documented that
unpublished studies have shown that more rigorous bacteriological examinations of
RBCT badgers have revealed almost twice the number of sampled badgers were
infected (Jenkins et al. 2008, p. 1358). Based on the same data, Donnelly reports
that about 33% of RBCT badgers were actually infected (Donnelly 2013).14 The
figure of 33% of M. bovis-infected badgers in high incidence areas is used in this
analysis.
The following sections discuss the AWIA analyses for the three policy options
for badger control of (1) do nothing, (2) badger culling, and (3) badger vaccination.
Policy Option 1: ‘Do Nothing’
It is standard for government to have a ‘do nothing’ or minimal approach in its
assessment of policy options. The do-nothing policy option here refers to badger-
based measures alone. Hence, in the do-nothing policy option, bovine TB is
controlled by cattle-based measures alone, such as tuberculin testing and slaughter
10 The minimum control area for a licence is 150 km2. The average application for a licence to Natural
England was 350 km2 (Natural England 2011, p. 4).
11 The experts agreed that that bovine TB incidence would reduce by 3-22% (central estimate 12.4%) if
the incidence is similar inside the cull area and 2 km ring, or 8–24% (central estimate 16%) assuming
higher incidence inside the culling area. These figures are based on four years culling and 5.5 years post-
culling and the same culling methods as used in the RBCT (Defra 2011a).
12 With a larger culling zone, there is a greater ratio of the culling area to the area immediately outside.
Hence, the impact of perturbation is likely to be less.
13 However, Owen Paterson MP, Secretary of State for Defra (2012–2014) during the first year of the
badger culls, stated that badgers might be culled for the next 25 years (Gray 2013).

 of reactors, movement restrictions, slaughterhouse inspection of carcasses and on-
farm biosecurity.
Cattle Population Impacts
The number of cattle slaughtered per herd breakdown is calculated by dividing the
total number of cattle slaughtered by the number of new herd incidences. These
figures are derived from Defra’s Quarterly publication on bovine TB incidence and
prevalence in Britain (Defra and GSS 2016). The figures for high risk areas in
England areas are 7.78 (26,185/3364) cattle slaughtered per new herd incident to
end June 2016 and 6.72 (22,778/3392) to end June 2015. This analysis uses the
mean of the figures for high incidence areas to end June 2015 and end June 2016,
which is 7.25 ((7.78 ? 6.72)/2). Hence, Defra’s data reveal that 7.25 cattle are
slaughtered per new herd incident in high risk areas across June 2014–June 2016.
Thus, the baseline number of cattle culled in 33 high incidence areas is calculated
by multiplying the estimated figure of 12,800 new breakdowns over 9 years without
badger culling (Natural England 2011, p. 17) by the number of cattle culled per
breakdown in high incidence areas (using Defra end June 2014–2016 figures).
Hence, in the do-nothing policy option, 92,800 (12,800 9 7.25) cattle are estimated
to be culled over a nine year timeframe.
Badger Population Impacts
The total badger population over 4 years in the 33 cull areas can be calculated based
on the central estimate of 85,000 badgers culled and the objective to cull 70% of
badgers. Therefore, if 85,000 is 70% of the badger population then the total badger
population across 4 years in the 33 cull areas is 121,429 (85,000 9 100/70). Based
on the total badger population in the 33 cull areas, estimates for welfare impacts can
be made. Donnelly (2013) and Jenkins et al. (2008) report that 33% of badgers in
high bovine TB incidence areas are infected with M. bovis. Hence, 40,072
(33% 9 121,429) badgers are infected with M. bovis over 4 years. Jenkins et al.
found that 1% of M. bovis-infected badgers in the proactive areas of the RBCT had
extensive and severe lesions at necropsy (Jenkins et al. 2008, p. 1350). Hence, 401
(1% 9 40,072) badgers can be assumed to suffer medium-duration, strong intensity,
negative welfare due to M. bovis infection. Most badgers do not suffer severely from
M. bovis infection (Defra 2010b; Jenkins et al. 2008). However, it can be assumed
that M. bovis infection does have some degree of negative impact on quality of life.
Hence, the 39,671 (40,072–401) M. bovis-infected badgers that do not have severe
and extensive lesions are considered to experience a medium-duration, mild
intensity, negative impact on welfare. Despite this, these badgers are considered to
have a life of net positive value, since the negative impact of M. bovis infection is
likely to be outweighed by other positive value in life.
Finally, the AWIA analysis in this paper is concerned with assessing the impacts
of the policy options of (1) do nothing, (2) badger culling, and (3) badger
vaccination. For simplicity and to facilitate comparing the impact of the three policy
options, it is assumed that cattle and badger populations in general have a life of net

123
 positive value. The assumption is to provide a baseline but is not arbitrary. To
illustrate, if a cow has a life of net positive value, then M. bovis infection, since it
leads to slaughter, causes a (very) negative impact. However, if that cow had a life
of net negative value (for instance due to chronic severe lameness), infection with
M. bovis and consequent culling would in fact be a positive impact, since her death
would be the end of her suffering.
Policy Option 2: ‘Badger Culling’
Cattle Population Impacts
The Natural England report to Defra includes a section on the potential benefits for
bovine TB control based on industry proposals in Annex D (Natural England 2011,
p. 17). The report uses the ‘Donnelly model’, which estimates bovine TB incidence
based on 5 years of badger culling, followed by 4 years of non-culling (Jenkins
et al. 2010). As the Natural England report states, because licensing criteria are
based on a four year cull, using the Donnelly model may overestimate the benefits
of the proposed government badger culling policy. Based on the Donnelly model,
without badger culling, there would be *12,800 new breakdowns over the nine
year period in 33 control areas. Based on the Donnelly Model’s 5 years of culling
and a four year post-cull period, there would be *10,350 (19% reduction) new herd
incidents, or a reduction of 2450.
As discussed in policy option 1, the mean number of cattle slaughtered per new
herd incident from end June 2014 to 2016 is 7.25. Hence, the total number of cattle
slaughtered in the badger culling policy option is 75,038 (10,350 9 7.25) Based on
these figures, a 19% reduction in bovine TB incidence due to badger culling would
mean 17,763 (2450 9 7.25) fewer cattle slaughtered. Additional to the harm of
killing, cattle culled due to bovine TB can be assumed to suffer short-duration,
moderate-strong intensity, negative welfare due to the transportation, lairage and
slaughter process (FAWC 2003). Thus, a 19% reduction in bovine TB incidence
results in 17,763 cattle avoiding this negative welfare impact due to being
prematurely culled over a nine year timeframe.15
Badger Population Impacts
For badgers, direct non-killing welfare impacts are defined as the welfare impacts
caused directly by the methods of being shot. The government controlled/free-
shooting humaneness target for the pilot badger culls was fewer than 5% of badgers
taking over 5 min to die after being shot. The IEP reported that 7.4–22.8% of
badgers took over 5 min to die (IEP 2014). The AWIA uses the central estimate of
15.1% of badgers, based on the IEP figures. The IEP also reported that cage trapping
and shooting was used extensively in the pilot culls. After a Freedom of Information
15 Of course, the individual cows will be culled at some point regardless. However, reduced bovine TB
incidence means that fewer cows are culled, and thus fewer experience negative welfare impacts due to
transportation, lairage and slaughter.

 Act request, it was revealed that around 75% of badgers culled in the 2013
Gloucestershire and Somerset pilot culls were cage-trapped and shot (Press
Association 2014). The Defra summary report of the 2016 culls reveals that 55% of
badgers were culled using controlled/free-shooting and 45% using cage-trap and
shooting (Defra 2016c). The AWIA assumes that 50% of badgers are killed by
controlled/free-shooting and 50% by cage trapping and shooting across the 4 years
of culling. The AWIA accounts for the welfare impacts of the 15.1% of badgers in
controlled/free-shooting taking over 5 min to die as short-duration, strong intensity,
negative welfare. Cage trapping wild animals such as badgers also causes negative
welfare. The AWIA accounts for the impact of cage-trapping badgers as short-
duration, moderate intensity, negative welfare.
Indirect non-killing welfare impacts are defined as welfare impacts due to the
culling process other than direct impacts. Based on the RBCT, the ISG found that
badger culling causes social disruption of badger groups, which leads to
perturbation (Bourne et al. 2007; Woodroffe et al. 2006). The best explanation
for the cause of perturbation due to the culling process is stress caused to the badger
population by the activity of culling. The process of badger culling includes killing
individual badgers and causing disruption of social groups due to these deaths.
Further stress and perturbation is likely to result from the loud sounds of shots being
fired. There are no data to quantify the indirect non-killing welfare impacts of
culling, i.e. the stress caused to the local badger population. It is estimated here that
25% of the population experience indirect non-killing negative welfare due to
culling causing disruption of social groups.16
Policy Option 3: ‘Badger Vaccination’
There are no direct scientific data on how the BCG vaccination affects transmission
of M. bovis from badgers to cattle. It has been shown that inoculation results in a
73.8% reduction in positive serological test results for M. bovis in badgers
(Chambers et al. 2011, p. 1913). Defra recommends the vaccination of badgers
around culling zones to reduce the impact of perturbation (Defra 2011b, p. 10).
BadgerBCG can reasonably be assumed to have some positive impact on the
reduction of transmission of M. bovis from badgers to cattle. However, there are no
data to quantify this impact.
For the purpose of illustration, the AWIA analysis for badger vaccination is
based on the following. First, an assumption is made that BadgerBCG reduces the
transmission rate of M. bovis from vaccinated badgers to cattle by 50%.17 Secondly,
16 The 25% figure is likely to be a significant underestimate, given that the target culling rate is 70% of
the population. Indeed, it may be that 100% of the badger population in culling areas experience some
form of negative welfare impact due to the culling process.
17 A recent study by Woodroffe et al. has revealed there to be very infrequent direct contacts between
cattle and badgers on the farm environment (Woodroffe et al. 2016). The finding suggests that badger-to-
cattle and cattle-to-badger transmission of M. bovis is likely to occur through indirect contact via
contamination of the species’ shared environment. This evidence is an important piece in the jigsaw for
the bovine TB policy evidence base. However, it should not affect this model as the assumed figure of
50% reduction in M. bovis transmission from badgers to cattle due to badger vaccination can result from
direct or indirect contact. For instance, if badger vaccination reduces infection rates in badgers, then this

 Donnelly and Nouvellet report that badgers are responsible for 50% of cattle
reactors in high TB-incidence areas. This includes initial badger-cattle transmission
(5.7%) and subsequent cattle–cattle transmission (94.3%) (Donnelly and Nouvellet
2013). Using the assumption of the efficacy of BadgerBCG to reduce badger-cattle
transmission rates, the findings of Donnelly and Nouvellet, and the number of
badgers vaccinated, the impact of badger vaccination can be estimated. The
figures in the AWIA analysis in Tables 7 and 8 are based on the vaccination of 50%
of the badger population in control areas.
Cattle Population Impacts
Based on the assumptions and figures above, the impact of badger vaccination on
bovine TB incidence, and thus the number of cattle culled as reactors, can be
estimated. The AWIA analysis estimates that badger vaccination will result in
11,600 fewer cattle being culled over a 9 year timeframe. This figure is derived in
the following way: 92,800 (cattle slaughtered, do nothing) 9 0.5 (badger wildlife
reservoir causing 50% reactors) 9 0.5 (50% badgers vaccinated) 9 0.5 (assumption
of BadgerBCG reduced badger-cattle transmission efficacy) = 11,600. Thus, the
number of cattle culled over a 9 year timeframe in the badger vaccination policy
option is estimated to be 81,200 (92,800–11,600).
As for the do-nothing and badger culling policy options, slaughtered cattle are
assumed to experience short-duration, moderate-strong intensity, negative welfare
due to transportation, lairage and slaughter process. Thus, badger vaccination results
in 11,600 fewer cattle experiencing this degree of negative welfare as a result of
being culled as bovine TB reactors.
Badger Population Impacts
Chambers et al. (2011, p. 1913) have shown that BadgerBCG reduces positive
serological test results in badgers by 73.8%. As discussed in the do-nothing policy
option, Donnelly (2013) and Jenkins et al. (2008) report that 33% of badgers in
proactive areas in the RBCT were infected with M. bovis. Around 1% of tuberculous
badgers had extensive and severe lesions at necropsy (Jenkins et al. 2008). The
AWIA analysis for the do-nothing policy option found that the majority of the 33%
of M. bovis-infected badgers experience medium-duration, mild intensity, negative
welfare impact. However, this is outweighed by other positive value in their lives,
so this group of infected badgers still have a life of net positive value. Hence, if

 intensity, positive welfare impact in 150 badgers (401 suffering badgers 9 50%

were assumed to die from M. bovis infection, BadgerBCG vaccination results in 150
badgers avoiding death. The remaining 14,877 badgers (15,027–150) experience a
medium-duration, mild intensity, positive welfare impact due to inoculation.
Finally, the cage-trapping of wild species such as badgers can be assumed to cause
moderate negative welfare. Thus, 60,715 badgers (121,429 total population 9 50%
population vaccinated) over a 4 year timeframe experience short-duration, moderate
intensity, negative welfare due to the inoculation process.
Summary of Killing Impacts of Bovine TB Policy Options
Arguably, it is the killing impacts, for both cattle and badgers that are most relevant
in AWIA of bovine TB policy options. Table 9 summarises the killing impacts of
bovine TB policy options.
The 17,763 cattle not slaughtered as a result of badger culling is based on the
19% reduction in bovine TB incidence. The figure is based on Natural England’s
advice to Defra (Natural England 2011). Based on the AWIA vaccination policy
option model and its assumptions in this analysis, badger vaccination is estimated to
reduce the number of cattle culled by 11,600, which represents a 12.5% reduction in
bovine TB incidence. With respect to the badger population, the badger culling
policy involves the killing of 85,000 badgers over 4 years. The number of badgers
culled over the nine year policy timeframe would ultimately depend on whether
culling was extended beyond the original 4-year culling licences granted by Natural
England. The do-nothing and badger vaccination policies do not involve the culling
of badgers.
These figures are consistent with the Natural England advice to Defra (Natural
England 2011). Natural England reported that *30–50 badgers would be killed for
each TB breakdown in cattle. The figures of 85,000 badgers culled to avoid the
slaughter of 17,763 means that 4.785 badgers are killed for every cow which avoids
slaughter. The AWIA has calculated that each herd breakdown results in *7.25
cattle slaughtered. Hence, 34.69 (4.785 9 7.25) badgers are culled to prevent each
bovine TB herd breakdown in cattle.

 Animal Health and Welfare Policy Actors on AWIA
As part of the research undertaken for the project which this paper is based on, the
first author conducted semi-structured interviews with animal health and welfare
policy actors. The AWIA is a policy instrument to be used to analyse impacts on
sentient animals in public policy. For this reason, elites in animal health and welfare
policy were asked about their views on a potential AWIA tool.18 The interviews
were conducted between 2012 and 2013 and 17 individuals were interviewed.
Interviewees were selected primarily based on their roles giving them knowledge of
the animal health and welfare policy process. They included former government
ministers, Defra civil servants, a farming industry official, a senior veterinary
surgeon, a scientific expert and an animal welfare NGO official. Interviewees were
given the option of whether to be identified in the research output or to remain
anonymous. Hence, in the quotations from transcripts below, some actors are
identified, whereas others are labelled with reference to their professional role and
affiliation. Interviews, which were digitally audio-recorded, lasted for around an
hour and the material was transcribed and thematically coded for analysis. The
interviews covered a range of issues related to the broader project and the question
about AWIA was just one part of the interview. Quotations from transcripts below
include references to bovine TB because the policy issue in general was also
discussed during the interview. Interviewees were asked their opinions on the
concept of AWIA and they were not commenting on the AWIA application to
bovine TB policy presented in this paper.
In general, there was broad support for the concept of AWIA. A former British
Cattle Veterinary Association (BCVA) President stated:
What I think you’re trying to do is get some objective information, for
something like what’s the welfare impact of a public policy, and I think that
has to be a good thing. The better informed and the more objective the data to
hand or the information to hand, that has to be a good thing. So in principle I
would welcome it. [Former President, BCVA].
A National Farmers Union (NFU) TB policy official agreed in principle with the use
of an AWIA tool:
Interviewer: So the question is what, either the NFU position if you can speak
on behalf of the NFU, or your position as an individual, would you agree to
that sort of policy tool [AWIA] in principle?
Yeah. I mean I’ve got no problem. I mean most farmers would say, is it right
ethically, welfare-wise, to kill 30? thousand cattle every year, that would be
normally healthy cattle?. Whether they might be close to calving, have calves
18 A participant information sheet was sent to interviewees prior to the interview. The information
included the following: ‘‘The AWIA can be thought of as an envelope of various tools and procedures
used to appraise the impact on animals in the policy process. At its simplest it is an estimate of the
number of animals impacted by each policy option in terms of quantity killed and negative welfare
impacts. The tool can be developed to incorporate positive impacts on animals and estimates of the
intensity of impacts (mild, moderate and severe)’’.

 inside them. You know, [that] can’t be right, when we’re expecting to kill
5,000 badgers, when 50,000 of them are killed on the road each year. [NFU
official, TB policy].
The Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) Chief Executive related AWIA to
intrinsic moral considerations:
I would certainly think that an objective assessment of animal welfare in its
proper sense rather than just its animal health sense would be a very important
tool. I totally agree that the intrinsic moral worth of animals needs to be
addressed, needs to be recognised. [Philip Lymbery, CEO CIWF].
A former Conservative Defra minister was more lukewarm about the idea:
I don’t dissent from the idea, I’m always just cautious of yet another process to
go through before decisions are made and policies are got on with. So often
delay is the enemy of progress and getting things done. And I mean I suppose
you would rightly argue that an impact assessment would address it, but quite
often there are ups and downs. I mean if you take the TB issue, you know, a lot
of the people would argue it is about badger welfare. Actually, it’s a very big
issue about cattle welfare, and you know to do an assessment properly would
have to take into account both sides of that. [Former Defra minister,
Conservative Party].
The Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare (APGAW)
supported AWIA but believed it should be conducted by an independent body:
You’d have to make sure it had the confidence of the public and it had the very
best scientific people on it, because otherwise you see it would be challenged,
and then you’d go straight back into the political arena. You will anyway to a
degree, but the only way you will get trust is through having a good strong
scientific base for it. [Neil Parish MP, Chair APGAW].
An Animal Health Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA)19 official advised
that for it to be done it would have to be compulsory. The official advised that the
AWIA should not be too simple but also not too complicated, and considered it
useful to provide some structure to the assessment of policy impacts [Civil servant,
AHVLA]. The AWIA has been constructed so that it can be completed to varying
degrees of detail to account for the AHVLA official’s point.
A second former Defra minister interviewed discussed the idea that policy
impacts on animals are currently assessed on a ‘‘case-by-case’’ basis [Former Defra
minister, Labour Party]. We would argue that the current approach of assessment on
a case-by-case basis is not sufficiently rigorous. Such an approach permits policy
makers to omit, whether intentional or otherwise, policy impacts that are of critical
importance to sentient animals and public concern. For instance, the impact
assessment on badger culling focuses on the humaneness of culling methods and
19 The AHVLA was the Defra agency responsible for animal health and welfare policy at the time the
interviews were conducted. At the time of writing in July 2017, the Defra agency responsible for animal
health and welfare is the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).

 ecological issues20 (Defra 2011d). However, the public’s principal moral concern
relates to the moral issue of killing badgers (Bennett and Willis 2008; Defra
2006a, 2006b). Despite this, government policy statements pay scant attention to
this issue (Defra 2011c, p. 15).
Discussion
The paper has argued for the mandatory application of formal and systematic
Animal Welfare Impact Assessment (AWIA) to all policy options which potentially
impact the interests of sentient animals. The justification for requiring mandatory
AWIA in policy making is based on the following arguments: (1) sentient animals
are owed direct moral consideration based on their subjective experiential lives
(sentient animals can have a life worth living or a life of suffering); (2) there is
widespread and consistent public concern about how public policy impacts animals;
and (3) the Treaty of Lisbon, which amends the founding Treaty of the EU,
recognises that (certain) animals are sentient and mandates member states to pay
full regard to such animals in policy making.
The AWIA should be conducted in three stages for each species impacted by
policy: (1) species description, (2) harms and benefits list; and (3) AWIA analysis.
This paper applies AWIA to bovine TB and badger control in England. It
demonstrates how AWIA can illustrate positive and negative welfare impacts, and
life and killing impacts, for a number of policy options on a number of species. Such
a policy tool is a necessary element of evidence-based policy making in animal
health and welfare policy.
In bovine TB policy, based on Natural England data and industry figures for a
19% reduction in bovine TB incidence (Natural England 2011), the AWIA reveals
that the badger culling policy results in a far greater number of badgers killed
(*85,000) over a four year period compared to the number of cattle (*17,750) that
would otherwise be slaughtered as TB reactors over a nine year period. These
figures translate to about five (4.8) badgers culled for every cow which avoids
slaughter due to bovine TB. In addition, the badger culling policy causes greater
direct and indirect welfare impacts associated with the culling process. Direct
welfare impacts are caused by badgers suffering as a result of being shot and not
dying instantaneously. Indirect welfare impacts are caused by the disruption of
social groups as a result of badgers being shot, and disturbance to the badger
populations, particularly due to the noise arising from the culling process.
To assess the impact of vaccination the analysis uses a set of stated assumptions.
These are (1) that BadgerBCG reduces the transmission rate of M. bovis from badgers
to cattle by 50%, (2) that badgers are responsible for 50% of cattle TB reactors in high
risk areas, and (3) that 50% of the badger population in high risk areas are vaccinated.
Based on this model, the AWIA reveals that badger vaccination has the potential to
have a lesser but similar impact on reducing the number of cattle slaughtered
(*11,600), compared to badger culling (*17,750). Badgers are not killed in the

 badger vaccination policy options, and the welfare impacts are considerably less
severe compared to those associated with badger culling.
Finally, when comparing the impacts of badger control policy options, it is
important to remember the underlying assumptions in the AWIA. The proposed
19% reduction in bovine TB incidence in cattle due to badger culling is based on
killing over 70% of the badger population in culling areas. However, the IEP
reported that the 2013 pilot badger culls in Somerset (
\
48%) and Gloucester
(
\
39%) fell far short of the 70% target in the original six-week licences for culling
(IEP 2014). The failure to cull 70% of the badger population and the extensions to
the culling times are likely to have limited the efficacy of badger culling in reducing
the incidence of bovine TB in cattle.
There is considerable uncertainty as to the efficacy of vaccinating badgers, in
terms both of protecting badgers against M. bovis infection and of transmitting the
disease to cattle. The analysis in this paper has sought to use conservative estimates
of efficacy. For instance, although Chambers et al. have reported a 73.8% reduction
in seroprevalence in badgers vaccinated with BCG (Chambers et al. 2011), the
AWIA assumes that badger vaccination reduces the transmission rate from a
vaccinated badger to cattle by 50%. However, from a practical standpoint, it is
worth noting that badger vaccination with BadgerBCG must be conducted annually,
which raises questions about its feasibility as a medium-long term policy option. Of
course, this must be compared to badger culling, which is unlikely to be socially
acceptable in the medium-long term.
In interviews conducted as part of the research, animal health and welfare policy
actors were supportive of the idea of AWIA. Interviewees pointed to the need for
objective data and for the analysis to be conducted impartially to gain the respect of
the policy community. The results of the AWIA are used to inform the ethical
analysis of bovine TB and badger control policy options. Elsewhere, utilitarian
(McCulloch and Reiss 2017b), animal rights (McCulloch and Reiss 2017c) and
virtue-based frameworks (McCulloch and Reiss 2017d) have been applied to the
AWIA in this paper.
