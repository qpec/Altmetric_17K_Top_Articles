Abstract
Background—We prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of adding pre-operative 
chemoprophylaxis to our institution’s operative venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis 
policy as part of a physician led quality improvement initiative.
Study Design—Patients undergoing major cancer surgery between August 2013 and January 
2014 were screened according to service-specific eligibility criteria and targeted to receive pre-
operative VTE chemoprophylaxis. Bleeding, transfusion, and VTE rates were compared to 
historical controls who had not received pre-operative chemoprophylaxis.
Results—The 2,058 eligible patients who underwent operation between August 2013 and 
January 2014 (post-intervention) were compared to a cohort of 4,960 patients operated on between 
January 2012 and June 2013 that did not receive pre-operative VTE chemoprophylaxis (pre-
intervention). In total, 71% of patients in the post-intervention group were screened for eligibility; 
82% received pre-operative anticoagulation. When compared to the pre-intervention group, the 
post-intervention group had significantly lower transfusion rates (pre vs. post-intervention, 17% vs

bleeding (difference 0.3%, 95% CI: −0.1% – 0.7%, p=0.2). Rates of deep venous thrombosis 
(1.3% vs 0.2%; difference 1.1%, 95% CI: 0.7% – 1.4%, p <0.0001) and pulmonary embolus (1.0% 
vs 0.4%; difference 0.6%, 95% CI: 0.2% – 1%, p=0.017) were significantly lower in the post-
intervention group
Conclusions—In patients undergoing major cancer surgery, institution of a single dose of pre-
operative chemoprophylaxis, as part of a physician led quality improvement initiative, did not 
increase bleeding or blood transfusions and was associated with a significant decrease in VTE 
rates.

Introduction
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication of hospitalization and is 
associated with significant morbidity and mortality.(1) Although the link between VTE and 
cancer has been known since Trosseau’s seminal observations(2), VTE remains a frequent 
cause of morbidity during treatment for cancer.
Cancer patients are not only more likely to develop a post-operative VTE than patients 
undergoing surgery for other indications (3), but those with a VTE are also more likely to 
develop a subsequent VTE than patients without an underlying malignancy.(4) While 
different malignancies have different thrombotic potential, cancer is associated with a 4-fold 
increase in thrombosis and chemotherapy is associated with a 6.5-fold increase in 
thrombosis.(5) Additionally, cancer patients have a much higher risk of death following 
VTE than non-cancer patients (6). Surgery and systemic chemotherapy, the mainstays of 
modern cancer care, are both associated with increased risk of VTE in cancer patients (5, 7, 
8). Though numerous studies (9–17) have demonstrated that post-operative anticoagulation 
decreases the rate of symptomatic and asymptomatic VTE in surgical oncology patients, the 
effect of adding pre-operative anticoagulation to post-operative VTE prophylaxis is largely 
unknown.
No large studies have directly investigated either the safety or the efficacy of a single 
preoperative dose of chemical VTE prophylaxis. Despite this relative lack of evidence, 
guidelines from the European Society of Medical Oncology(18), the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology(19), and the American College of Chest Physicians(20) recommend 
institution of VTE prophylaxis pre-operatively with either low molecular weight heparin 
(LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) in cancer patients undergoing surgery.
Since 2001 our institution has been prospectively tracking post-operative complications 
using our Surgical Secondary Events (SSE) database (21). Adverse events are graded on a 
1–5 scale that is a modification of the Clavien – Dindo classification (22), with increasing

 severity indicated by the level of intervention required to treat the event. Grade 1 and 2 
events, those requiring bedside care and either oral (Grade 1) or intravenous (Grade 2) 
medicine are defined as minor events. Grades 3 – 5 require invasive intervention (Grade 3), 
result in chronic organ disability (Grade 4), or death (Grade 5); all are defined as major 
events.
The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project 
(NSQIP) provides member hospitals with risk-adjusted rankings on the incidence of 
postoperative adverse events, including VTE (23). Widely adopted, NSQIP provides bench-
marking of events between hospitals and has led to a decrease in adverse events at 
participating institutions (24). While MSKCC was recently recognized by NSQIP for 
achieving meritorious outcomes in surgical patient care (25), higher than expected rates of 
DVT and PE were identified (25).
In response, the MSKCC VTE Task Force was convened and directed a physician led 
prospective quality improvement (QI) initiative to investigate the safety and efficacy of 
instituting pre-operative chemical prophylaxis with LMWH or UFH in patients undergoing 
major operations for cancer.
Methods
Intervention
We performed a single institution prospective, non-randomized, historical cohort-
comparison trial assessing the safety (primary endpoint and secondary endpoints) and 
efficacy (secondary endpoint) of adding pre-operative chemoprophylaxis to our peri and 
post-operative VTE policies, which were not altered. The MSKCC VTE Task Force 
included an attending surgeon from the surgical services performing major adult abdominal, 
thoracic, or orthopedic procedures within the Department of Surgery at Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center (Colorectal, Gastric and Mixed Tumor (GMT), Gynecology 
(GYN), Hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB), Orthopaedic, Thoracic, and Urology) in addition 
to representatives from the Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care Medicine, 
Hematology, Clinical Pharmacy, Pre- and peri-operative Nursing services, and Biostatistics 
and Epidemiology.
Service-specific inclusion criteria for administration of pre-operative VTE prophylaxis were 
formulated based on review of current literature and guidelines. Participating services 
included the Colorectal, GMT, GYN, HPB, thoracic, and urology services. Final inclusion 
criteria during the QI initiative are listed in Table 1. Patients were screened by the nurse 
practitioners on the Pre-operative Surgical Testing (PST) service. Contraindications to 
anticoagulation included patients with any of the following conditions: 1) a diagnosed 
allergy to LMWH or UFH, 2) a known brain mass, 3) platelets less than 50 × 109/l, patients, 
4) serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dl, 5) an active transfusion requirement within the last week, or 
6) a diagnosis or history of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT). In 
appropriate patients, orders were written for either LMWH (40 mg Enoxaparin) or UFH 
(5,000 units unfractionated heparin) to be given subcutaneously in the pre-operative holding 
area by the nursing staff within two hours of operation. Orders were written using an order

 set created specifically for this QI project that included both the service specific inclusion 
criteria as well as the contraindications to pre-operative chemoprophylaxis. LMWH was the 
default anticoagulant during the trial, with UFH reserved for patients who were planned to 
receive an epidural catheter. Patients on pre-existing anticoagulation remained at their 
standard dosing. Patients undergoing emergent operations were excluded from the pilot.
Attending surgeons had the opportunity to change the ordered pre-operative agent (LMWH 
or UFH) or to discontinue the pre-operative anticoagulation. Patients who had been exposed 
to heparin within 90 days of their planned operation or had a platelet count of less than 100 
× 109/l were ordered for a pre-operative anti-heparin antibody testing to rule out 
undiagnosed HITT. Preoperative prophylactic anticoagulation was not ordered until this 
result was known, and if positive both the attending surgeon and the hematology service 
were alerted. Postoperative VTE prophylaxis was administered according to existing 
institutional VTE prophylaxis policies, which were not altered. Beginning on post-operative 
day #1 patients receive either UFH (5,000 units, sub-cutaneous, 2 – 3 times daily) or 
LMWH (enoxaparin 30 – 40 mg subcutaneously, once daily) for the duration of their 
hospital stay. Dosing adjustments are made in consultation with the hematology and 
nephrology services, as necessary, and patients have sequential compression devices placed 
in the operating room.
Study of the Intervention
This QI initiative began on July 15th, 2013 with a planned two-week rollout prior to 
beginning data capture on August 1st. The primary endpoint was the rate of major bleeding 
events (grade ≥ 3 in our SSE database) (21). Secondary endpoints included the rate of DVT 
and PE, the rate of documented bleeding complications (regardless of grade), and the rate of 
blood transfusion. Adverse events, including those diagnosed post-discharge, were collected 
from our institutional SSE database as well as administrative data compiled after discharge. 
As per our standard practice patients in the post-intervention cohort did not receive 
surveillance for asymptomatic VTEs.
Analysis
Patients in the post-intervention group were compared to a cohort of patients who underwent 
surgery between January 1st 2012 and June 30th 2013 (pre-intervention group) that were 
indentified from our institutional medical record using identical inclusion criteria to the 
post-intervention group (with the difference that the pre-intervention group did not, as a 
standard, receive pre-operative VTE chemoprophylaxis). Rates of bleeding, transfusion, 
DVT, PE, and missed doses of post-operative VTE prophylaxis in both groups were 
compared using the chi squared test. Within the post-intervention group rates of screening 
(defined as opening of the project-specific electronic order set), and receipt of pre-operative 
VTE prophylaxis were also analyzed. All analysis was conducted using Stata 12 (StataCorp 
LP, College Station, TX).

 Results
In total, 2,058 patient in the post-intervention group (August 1st, 2013 – January 31st, 2014) 
were compared to 4,960 patients in the pre-intervention group (January 1st, 2012 – June 
30th, 2013). Service-specific inclusion criteria during the pilot are shown in Table 1. Table 2 
shows clinical characteristics for both groups, including the percentage of operations 
performed by the included services, which did not significantly differ between the two 
timeframes.
Of the 2,058 patients undergoing surgery in the post-intervention group, 1,463 (71%) were 
evaluated by the pre-surgical testing service for eligibility to receive pre-operative 
anticoagulation (Table 3). Service-specific evaluation rates ranged from 43% of eligible 
patients on the gynecology service to 84% of patients on the colorectal service. The majority 
of evaluated patients (1,148 of 1,463, 78%) received pre-operative anticoagulation, ranging 
from 52% of patients on the urology service to 84% of patients on the thoracic service. 
Services with the least complex inclusion criteria (Colorectal, GMT, and Thoracic) had the 
highest rates of evaluation. One hundred and twenty nine patients in the pilot were evaluated 
and eligible for pre-operative coagulation but had no order placed by pre-surgical testing. 
The most common reason for not placing an order was “Attending Review Requested” (55 
patients, 42% of evaluated patients who were eligible but had no anticoagulation order 
placed), signifying the pre-surgical testing nurse practitioner wanted to defer the 
anticoagulation decision to the attending surgeon. This often occurred in the context of a 
HITT test that had not resulted by the time the nurse practitioner reviewed the patient’s lab 
results and eligibility for pre-operative chemoprophylaxis. An additional 30 patients (23% of 
screened patients who were not ordered anticoagulation) had no contraindication noted by 
the pre-surgical testing service but were not ordered for pre-operative anticoagulation; the 
remaining 44 patients (34% of screened patients who were not anticoagulated) had strict 
contraindications to anticoagulation (active bleeding: n = 13; brain lesion: n = 9; serum 
creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dl: n = 9; HITT or other heparin allergy: n = 7; thrombocytopenia: n = 6). 
Of the 595 patients who were not evaluated by pre-surgical testing, 58 (10%) received pre-
operative anticoagulation, for a total of 1,206 patients who received pre-operative 
chemoprophylaxis in the post-intervention group.
The 2,058 patients in the post-intervention cohort, when compared to the 4,960 patients in 
the pre-intervention cohort (only 40 of whom received pre-operative chemoprophylaxis), did 
not have a statistically significant difference in the rate of major bleeding events (pre vs 
post-intervention, 0.8% vs 0.5%; difference 0.3%; 95% CI: −0.15 – 0.7%, p = 0.2). 
Additionally, patients in the post-intervention cohort had lower rates of both documented 
bleeding (4.2% vs 2.5%; difference 1.7%; 95% CI 0.8% – 2.6%, p = 0.001) and blood 
transfusion (17% vs 14%; difference 3.1%; 3.1%; 95% CI 1.3% – 4.9%, p = 0.001), as well 
as lower rates of documented DVT (1.3% vs 0.2%; difference 1.1%; 95% CI: 0.7% – 1.4%, 
p<0.0001), and PE (1% vs 0.4%; difference: 0.6%; 95% CI 0.2% – 1%, p = 0.017). There 
were no changes to institutional or service-specific guidelines regarding utilization of 
imaging for investigation of VTE during the study period, and imaging rates were also lower 
in the post-intervention group (11% vs 7.6%; difference: 3.4%; 95% CI: 1.9% – 4.8%, p < 
0.0001). The pre-intervention group had a higher rate of missed post-operative VTE

 prophylaxis doses (3.9% vs 3.3%; difference 0.7%; 95% CI: 0.4% – 0.9%, p < 0.0001) as 
well as a higher percentage of patients with at least one missed postoperative dose (39% vs 
31%; difference 8%; 95% CI: 6% – 11%, p <0.0001) (Table 4).
In total, 373 patients in the post-intervention group met our study’s criteria (platelets ≤ 100 
× 109/l or exposure to heparin within 90 days) for HITT screening prior to the 
administration of pre-operative chemoprophylaxis using an enzyme linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) for heparin dependent antiplatelet antibodies. Of the 373 patients screened, 
only 10 (2.6%) had an ELISA that was either borderline (8/373, 2%) or positive (2/373, 
0.5%). Borderline or positive patients did not receive additional confirmatory testing. 
Subsequent to non-negative HITT tests, two patients had heparin listed as an allergy in their 
chart and electronic medical record, seven patients, including the two patients with a 
positive test, received post-operative heparin, and no patients developed clinical HITT.
Discussion
We conducted this single institutional, non-randomized, prospective QI project to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of adding a single pre-operative dose of either LMWH or UFH to 
current peri- and post-operative VTE prophylaxis policies. Though the European Society of 
Medical Oncology (18), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (19), and the American 
College of Chest Physicians (20) all recommend beginning VTE prophylaxis pre-
operatively, few studies have examined the additive effect of pre-operative 
chemoprophylaxis to peri and post-operative chemoprophylaxis. The initial studies of VTE 
prophylaxis in general surgery and surgical oncology patients all included pre-operative 
VTE prophylaxis (9–13), but they occurred in an era when elective surgery patients were 
routinely admitted to the hospital prior to surgery, thus placing them at increased risk of 
VTE. In fact, the trial design for the early VTE prophylaxis studies comparing different 
medications all included a dose 12 hours before the operation and another dose within two 
hours prior to skin incision (9–13). Previous trial designs and dosing strategies are not 
reflective of current practice patterns, making it difficult to extrapolate the potential added 
effect of the single dose of pre-operative heparin to modern VTE prophylaxis. As a result of 
the discrepancy between initial trial design and our current practice, as well as the 
magnitude of the surgery we typically perform, there was significant concern among our 
attending staff as to whether providing our patients with pre-operative VTE 
chemoprophylaxis was safe. As a result we structured this QI intervention primarily as a 
safety assessment.
Additionally, there is considerable controversy regarding the mandated use of VTE rates as 
a publically reported quality measure. DVT prophylaxis is known to be imperfect (26) and 
there is well characterized surveillance bias regarding publically reported VTE rates (26–
31). Reporting controversies aside, VTE remains an important public health concern 
resulting in substantial morbidity (1). Missed prophylaxis doses remain the major modifiable 
risk factor for the development of DVT and PE in the general surgery population (32, 33).
NSQIP provides risk adjusted outcomes that allow institutions to track individual 
performance compared to other member institutions. After adjusting for case mix and patient

 comorbidities, our institutional VTE rate was identified as higher than expected on repeated 
NSQIP semi-annual reports. Internal review identified high rates of compliance with our 
existing DVT-prophylaxis policies, which did not include pre-operative anticoagulation. 
After comparing VTE prophylaxis guidelines (18–20) to our institutional guidelines, we 
began a QI initiative to primarily study the safety, and secondarily, the efficacy, of adding a 
single dose of pre-operative VTE prophylaxis to our current institutional VTE prophylaxis 
policy in select patients. We found that the single dose of pre-operative VTE prophylaxis 
was safe and was associated with significantly lower DVT and PE rates (Table 4). These 
results held true when we compared the subset of NSQIP patients in the pre and post-
intervention cohorts. These findings have resulted in the revised institutional guidelines for 
addition of pre-operative prophylaxis in surgical patients as outlined in Table 5. We have not 
yet received an institutional NSQIP semi-annual report reflecting our new institutional 
guidelines.
Implementation Challenges
A significant challenge identified during the pilot involved the use of LMWH as the primary 
anti-coagulant, which often resulted in disruptions to the flow of routine clinical care given 
its contraindication in patients receiving neuraxial analgesia. LMWH was chosen as the 
preferred chemoprophylaxis agent for the QI initiative because of its 10-fold lower 
association with HITT. While there were no instances where the LMWH was administered 
inadvertently in a patient planned for an epidural, the additional surveillance and failsafe 
mechanisms necessary to insure this interfered significantly with clinical workflow. Given 
the extra surveillance in patients planned for an epidural, and the fact that a significant 
number of surgeons were cancelling LMWH orders in favor of UFH (56% of all patients 
who received chemoprophylaxis received UFH), our institutional policy enacted as a result 
of this QI initiative uses UFH for all pre-operative chemoprophylaxis. Our post-operative 
chemoprophylaxis agents were not changed during either the pre or post-intervention time 
frames; both UFH and LMWH may be used beginning on post-operative day one.
Screening for HITT also proved to be a significant disruptor to workflow with “positive” 
screens in pre-surgical testing a frequent impediment to the ordering of pre- pre-operative 
chemoprophylaxis. Despite aggressive screening we did not identify a single patient with 
clinical HITT, and as a result we have abandoned routine screening for HITT.
Limitations
Our study, an observational study with historical controls, has several limitations. Because 
we were comparing the pre- and post-intervention cohorts we could not alter our 
institutional tracking of adverse events without adding significant observational bias, so it is 
possible that we are underestimating our VTE rate. We primarily captured VTEs 
documented in our institutional SSE database(21), which captures inpatient and post-
discharge adverse events. Additionally, we combined our SSE database entries with post-
discharge administrative data compiled on our patients in order to decrease the possibility of 
not capturing a documented VTE. We used identical selection criteria for both the pre-
intervention and post-intervention cohorts to identify patients, and after retrieving our 
patient list we confirmed that all patients screened by pre-surgical testing were included in 
Selby et al.

 the post-intervention cohort. It is possible we used incorrect criteria to identify patients and 
included ineligible patients in both cohorts. However, such an error would likely bias our 
results against our findings as we would have included ineligible patients who were not 
anticoagulated and yet considered them anticoagulated in our analysis. Though we did not 
screen all eligible patients for inclusion, this also biases against our null hypothesis as the 
majority of unscreened patients did not receive pre-operative VTE prophylaxis but were 
analyzed as if they did.
There are significant differences between the pre and post-intervention groups in the 
frequency of image utilization as well as the frequency of missed post-operative VTE 
prophylaxis. Imaging frequency (26–31) and missed doses (26, 32, 33) are both known to 
affect VTE rates, contributing to the well characterized surveillance bias regarding 
publically reported VTE rates (26–31). Differences in imaging frequency and missed post-
operative doses between the pre and post-intervention groups (Table 4) may account for the 
higher VTE rate in the pre-intervention group. The primary endpoint of this QI initiative was 
to test whether or not pre-operative VTE prophylaxis was safe in the surgical oncology 
patient, the VTE rate (as well as DVT and PE rates, individually) was a secondary endpoint. 
Because this is an observational study with historical controls it is impossible to determine 
whether the chance in imaging utilization is the result of the decreased VTE incidence (due 
to a decrease in clinical suspicion) or the cause of the decreased VTE incidence (due to 
decreased detection of asymptomatic thromboses). In the post-intervention cohort the 
decreased number of total missed post-operative doses of VTE prophylaxis (as well as the 
decreased percentage of patients who missed any postoperative dose) could explain the 
decreased VTE rate. This finding, however, further reinforces that pre-operative VTE 
prophylaxis is safe in our patient population. Off all the reasons given for skipping a dose of 
VTE prophylaxis (in preparation for epidural removal, as a result of a planned invasive 
procedure, patient refusal, patient condition, or other non-specific reasons), patient condition 
was the most common condition listed by the patient’s treating nurse (1,820 doses/4,365 
total missed doses, 41.7% of all missed doses). When compared to the pre-intervention time 
period, “Patient Condition” was the documented reason for a skipped dose significantly less 
frequently in the post-intervention cohort (2.3% of missed doses vs 2% of missed doses; 
difference 0.3%; 95% CI: 0.1% – 0.5%, p = 0.002).
Subsequent Protocol Changes
Since the internal release of these results, the services have re-reviewed their service-
specific inclusion criteria and two have made changes. With the institutional change to UFH, 
the HPB service has added service-specific exclusion criteria (platelets < 100 × 109/L, INR 
> 1.5, Plavix or Aspirin within 7 days prior to operation, bilirubin > 4mg/dl in the 3 weeks 
prior to operation, current bilirubin > 2mg/dl, or a history of cirrhosis) in addition to 
institutional exclusion criteria, and HPB patients not excluded by either set of criteria now 
receive pre-operative anticoagulation. Though their patients were not included in the QI 
initiative, upon seeing that pre-operative chemoprophylaxis did not increase major bleeding 
while also decreasing our VTE rate they developed their additional service-specific 
exclusion criteria in Table 5. Additionally, it was difficult to operationalize the gynecology 
inclusion criteria, a fact reflected in the low percentage of patients screened by presurgical

 testing. Their criteria have been revised and currently laparotomies are the only GYN cases 
to receive pre-operative anticoagulation. The current institutional inclusion criteria, finalized 
after internal distribution of these results and reflecting these two changes, are shown in 
Table 5.
Summary
The addition of a single dose of pre-operative VTE prophylaxis did not result in a significant 
increase in major bleeding complications in patients undergoing major cancer surgery. 
When compared to a pre-intervention cohort that did not receive the pre-operative dose of 
either UFH or LMWH VTE chemoprophylaxis, the post-intervention cohort that received 
pre-operative VTE prophylaxis did not have a significantly different rate of major bleeding, 
and had significantly lower rates of any documented bleeding complication, blood 
transfusions, DVT, and PE. Though there were differences in post-operative imaging and 
missed doses of postoperative VTE prophylaxis, we believe the addition of pre-operative 
DVT prophylaxis appropriately selected patients undergoing major cancer surgery is safe 
and effective in reducing rates of VTE. We now administer a single dose of UFH (5,000 
units subcutaneously) pre-operatively to all eligible patients.
