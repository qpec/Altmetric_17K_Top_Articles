High-throughput screening of a natural compound library was performed to identify the most efficacious combinatorial treatment
on prostate cancer. Ursolic acid, curcumin and resveratrol were selected for further analyses and administered in vivo via the diet,
either alone or in combination, in a mouse allograft model of prostate cancer. All possible combinations of these natural
compounds produced synergistic effects on tumor size and weight, as predicted in the screens. A subsequent untargeted
metabolomics and metabolic flux analysis using isotopically labeled glutamine indicated that the compound combinations
modulated glutamine metabolism. In addition, ASCT2 levels and STAT3, mTORC1 and AMPK activity were modulated to a greater
extent by the combinations compared to the individual compounds. Overall, this approach can be useful for identifying synergistic
combinations of natural compounds for chemopreventive and therapeutic interventions.

INTRODUCTION
According to the World Health Organization, one-third of all
cancer deaths are preventable through an increased consumption
of natural compounds able to modulate key molecular signaling
cascades that ultimately inhibit cancer cell proliferation and
induce
apoptosis.1–5
A
number
of
dietary
phytochemicals,
including curcumin (CUR), ursolic acid (UA), epigallocatechin-3-
gallate (or EGCG), resveratrol (RES), sulforaphane and 6-shogaol
have shown potential chemopreventive effects in vitro and in vivo
in either animal models or in clinical studies on several cancers,5–9
including
prostate
cancer
(PCa).1,
5,
10–15
These
bioactive
compounds target inflammatory signaling pathways including
Stat3 and NFκB in addition to other signaling pathways associated
with cancer development and progression.7, 8, 11, 16–19 These
studies have led to an increasing enthusiasm in developing novel
strategies for cancer prevention and treatment.5–9 Thus, a pressing
need has arisen to identify novel bioactive phytochemicals and to
understand their therapeutic role and mechanisms of action.
The systematic identification of effective bioactive agents is
very challenging, partly due to the low specificity of phytochem-
icals. In turn, their low toxicity and capability of inhibiting multiple
pathways represents a resourceful long-term strategy for chemo-
prevention or treatment of cancer. For instance, the ability of
these
compounds
to
target
multiple
pathways
might
be
advantageous to limit compensatory signaling feedback loops
and cross-talk between cellular pathways and between different
cell types inside the tumor microenvironment. The vast molecular
diversity offered by natural compound libraries represents an
invaluable resource for identification of synergistic combinatorial
treatments.
However,
the
systematic
search
of
synergistic
combinations is hampered by the many possible combinations,
even for combinations involving only two compounds within a
modest pool of candidates. For example, a single dose (and single
replicate) screening of a chemical library of 100 compounds in
combinations
of
two
agents,
would
require
testing
4950
combinations. To avoid the extensive experimental exploration
of all the possible compound combinations, several methods have
been developed aimed at predicting synergistic combinations.
However, most of these methods focused on the identification of
targeted inhibitors for a single enzyme rather than on monitoring
the global response of cancer cells.
Metabolomics, an emerging field of biomedical and nutrige-
nomics research,20–22 entails the measurement of a comprehen-
sive pool of small molecules, called the metabolome, in biological
samples.23–25 Besides being nutrients essential for cell growth, in
the context of cancer, metabolites represent sensitive markers of
major alterations in cancer cell metabolism and contribute to
oncogenic signaling. Lipid metabolism alteration is considered as
another hallmark of cancer cells since lipid metabolizing enzymes
are directly regulated by the activity of oncogenic signals.
Moreover, fluctuations in local metabolite concentrations,26–30
especially glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids, influence the
efficacy of chemotherapy in several human cancers including
prostate.31,
32 The wealth of information obtained from the
multivariate metabolic readout offers an unprecedented oppor-
tunity to investigate the metabolic consequences of the admin-
istration of natural compound combinations and thereby identify
synergies in their chemopreventive activity, as well as their

 contribution to improve treatment outcome when administered in
combination with current standard of care chemotherapeutics.
In this study, a high-throughput screening approach was used to
screen a natural compound library (NCL) and evaluate the efficacy
of phytochemicals, when administered alone and in combination of
two compounds using murine and human cell lines. The effect of
the most promising compounds (UA, CUR and RES) were tested
in vivo in a murine allograft model of PCa, as individual and
combination treatments. All the natural compound combinations
resulted in synergistic effects on tumor volume and weight.
Therefore, we further analyzed the molecular effects of the
compounds (administered alone and in combination) in in vitro
models of PCa using an untargeted metabolomics approach
combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and mass
spectrometry (MS). A number of metabolic pathways were affected
by the synergistic combinatorial treatments and allowed discrimi-
nation of those which were unequivocally driven by the individual
compounds. Moreover, metabolic flux analysis using isotopically
labeled glutamine indicated that the combination of UA with either
CUR or RES led to a blockade of glutamine uptake by the cancer
cells possibly contributing to the efficacy of these combinations in
hindering PCa growth. Collectively, the approach used in this paper
demonstrates that the metabolic response induced by single agent
screening alone may guide the development of novel combinator-
ial treatments from in vitro to in vivo models and could potentially
be translated into human studies.
RESULTS
Screening of NCL
The effect of a library of 142 natural compounds (listed in
Supplementary Table 1) on cell viability (based on the adenosine
triphosphate, ATP, bioluminescence assay) was screened in the
HMVP2 mouse PCa cell line.33, 34 HMVP2 cells were screened at
three different concentrations (5, 10 and 20 µM) and three time
points (12, 24 and 48 h). Z-factors were calculated to evaluate cell
response (based on ATP suppression) following exposure to the
natural compounds. A Z-factor value greater than 0.5 was
considered a very good response. The 20 µM treatment resulted
in the highest number of compounds with Z-factors greater than
0.5 and ATP values lower than 0.5 (indicating good suppression)
and was therefore selected as the best dose for the selection of
the top hits (Fig. 1, ATP only). ATP and the derived Z-factors for all
treatments and all doses are included in Supplementary Table 1.
ATP suppression in treated HMVP2 cells varied greatly, with the
majority of the screened natural compounds inducing a moderate
drop in ATP concentration to >50% of control (Fig. 1). Notably,
after 12 h of treatment at the 20 µM dose, the majority of the
natural compounds under study induced a greater suppression of
ATP levels compared to untreated (solvent control) samples than
longer treatments at the same dose (Fig. 1). Moreover, the top hits
(selected based on the highest Z-factor) were very consistent
regardless of the treatment dose (Supplementary Table 1) and
include shikonin, dioscin, amygdalin, UA, and oridonin (only for 24
and 48 h of treatment). Shikonin and dioscin were highly effective
at all time points and all doses; however, no differences in ATP
suppression
levels
were
observed
under
the
experimental
conditions for these two compounds (even at lower doses of 5
and 10 µM, as shown in Supplementary Table 1). These results are
likely due to the concentrations being too high. Therefore,
shikonin and dioscin were not granted further investigation in
the metabolic analysis and will be further characterized to
determine a more appropriate concentration range. In spite of
the high Z-factor values, amygdalin was not selected as a top hit
in this study due to the known ineffectiveness as a cancer
treatment.35
UA
was
selected
as
the
top
hit
for
further
combinatorial
treatment
studies,
as
this
compound
overall
resulted in better outcomes than oridonin.
We next performed the screen in HMVP2 cells treated with UA
(top hit from the individual agent screen) in combination with all
the agents screened as individual treatments (both agents used at
20 µM for 12, 24 and 48 h). In addition to the HMVP2 cell line, we
also performed the screen with the combined treatments in 3
androgen-independent, human PCa cell lines, DU145, PC3 and C4-
2B (Supplementary Table 3). The experimental ATP-suppression
values for the combined treatments are included in Table 1
(treatments inducing the top 20 highest ATP-suppression levels).
In HMVP2 cells, the combination of UA with either corosolic acid,
aesculin or CUR led to the highest level of ATP suppression
(besides the combinations with shikonin and dioscin, excluded for
the same considerations mentioned previously for the individual
treatment screen). Corosolic acid is structurally analogous to UA
and was therefore deemed suboptimal for further studies on the
Fig. 1
Screening of a natural compound library. HMVP2 cell viability following treatment with a library of natural compounds was screened
using the ATP bioluminescence assay. HMVP2 cells were treated for 12 (blue), 24 (red) and 48 h (green) with a library of natural compounds
(single agent) at the dose of 5, 10 or 20 µM (only the latter dose is shown in the figure). Natural compounds are sorted according to increasing
ATP bioluminescence values of the 12 h time-point (list of compounds is included in Supplementary Table 1). Relative ATP levels (ATP level in
treated samples normalized by ATP level of untreated samples) as averages of four replicates are shown

 effect of the combined treatment. CUR and aesculin led to
comparable ATP suppression results in HMVP2 cells, however, CUR
showed greatly improved ATP suppression in DU145 and PC3 cells
and similar ATP suppression in C4-2B cells compared to aesculin
(Supplementary Table 3). Therefore, CUR was selected as top hit for
combination treatment with UA. In addition to CUR, we also
included in our metabolic studies the combination of UA with
another natural compound, RES, which in our primary screen
showed little to no ATP suppression (average control-normalized
ATP levels between 0.77 and 1.72 in mouse and human PCa cell
lines) when administered as a single agent, and a greatly improved
ATP suppression following combined administration with UA. The
combination of CUR and RES was also included for comparison. We
also compared the effect on cell survival (using the MTT assay) of
the combination of UA with either CUR or RES to a variety of
standard care of therapeutic agents used for the treatment of
castration-resistant prostate cancer including docetaxel, enzaluta-
mide and abiraterone acetate in mouse HMVP-2 as well as
human (PC3 and LNCaP) PCa cell lines. Both combinations of
natural compounds showed at least comparable suppression of cell
growth/survival (Supplementary Fig. 1) to the standard therapeutic
agents.
In addition to screening for modulation of cell viability
(measured via ATP bioluminescence) following combined treat-
ment with natural compounds, we also monitored generation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in all the mouse and human PCa cell
lines. Notably, screening of ROS levels indicated that UA and RES,
administered either as single agents or in combination either
decreased or did not affect the ROS levels (compared to control).
In contrast, CUR alone induced an increase in ROS in most of the
cell lines (not significant in PC3), which was suppressed by the
combination with UA (Table 2).
In-vivo effects of UA, CUR and RES administered alone or in
combination
After selecting the top-hit compounds of interest from the above
screens the in vivo effects of the single or combined treatments
with the selected natural compounds were evaluated on growth
of tumors derived from HMVP2 spheroids in a mouse allograft
model.
HMVP2
cells
were
grown
into
spheroids,
injected
subcutaneously into the flank of male FVB/N mice and allowed
to grow for 13 days post-injection before starting the treatment.
All compounds were given in the diet. Tumor volume was
monitored starting on the 1st day of treatment and continued
until mice were sacrificed on day 32 of treatment. Moreover,
tumors were weighed at the end of treatment (day 32). Notably,
the addition of the natural compounds into the formulation of the
animals’ diets did not induce changes in either the animals’ body
weight (Fig. 2a) or their daily food consumption (Fig. 2b).
Treatments administered as single agents induced modest, but
not statistically significant, decreases in both tumor volume and
weight (Fig. 2c and d) as compared to mice on the control diet. In
contrast, all of the combinations resulted in significantly smaller
tumors (both volume and weight) than mice on the control diet.
Furthermore, the combination of UA + CUR also resulted in
significantly smaller tumors (both volume and weight) than those
obtained following administration of UA or CUR as single-agent
treatment. Thus, overall the combination of UA + CUR appeared to
be the most effective at inhibiting tumor growth, although all
three combinations produced significant combinatorial effects. We
also
compared
the
effect
of
the
combination
of
natural
compounds on in vivo tumor growth with docetaxel. At the
doses used for this experiment, docetaxel did not produce any
significant effects in the HMVP2 allograft model or in HMVP2 cells
treated in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 2).

 To further evaluate the effectiveness of the natural compounds
as combined treatments compared to the individual agents, we
used the Bliss method36 to investigate whether any of the
treatments resulted in synergistic effects. Using this method, all
the combined treatments produced synergistic effects on tumor
volume and tumor weight, as the predicted combined affected
fraction was lower than the experimental value in all cases
(Table 3; positive Bliss indices in all instances for tumor volume

 Effect of treatment with the natural compounds on PCa cell
metabolism
Given the encouraging outcome of the combined treatments
observed in the in vivo study, the molecular basis for the efficacy
of these natural compounds was further evaluated by performing
a study of cell metabolism. HMVP2 cells were treated with the
individual natural compounds selected above and their combina-
tions. Intracellular
and extracellular polar
metabolites
were
profiled using a combination of ultra-high
pressure
liquid
chromatography (UHPLC)-MS and MRS. Intracellular lipid metabo-
lites were also analyzed using UHPLC-MS.
Polar metabolites.
The UHPLC-MS analysis of the polar intracel-
lular metabolites yielded a total of approximately 600 valid
features from which 103 metabolites (included in the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database) were
identified. Thirty-nine metabolites were identified using the MRS
analysis of which 14 were unique to the MRS analysis (not
identified using the MS analysis). Fold change (normalized to
control) of the metabolite levels in the treated cells are included in
Fig. 3.
In order to visualize and characterize the global effect on cell
metabolism of the different treatments, we performed principal
component analysis (PCA), an unbiased and unsupervised multi-
variate method of analysis, on all the identified polar metabolites.
The PCA scores plot (Fig. 4) clearly indicates that, among the single
agent treatments, UA had the strongest effect on cell metabolism.
Also CUR induced a relevant metabolic change while the effect of
RES on HMVP2 cell metabolism was relatively small. To further
evaluate the effect of the compound combinations on cell
metabolism we calculated the Euclidean distance between all
treatment groups and control in the 2-dimensional (PC1 vs. PC2)
PCA scores plot (Table 3). As expected, given the outcome of the
single agent treatments, the combination CUR + UA affected cell
metabolism the most as shown by the distance from the control
group in the PCA scores plot. In order to evaluate whether the
effect of phytochemical combinations on cell metabolism were
synergistic or at least additive we adapted the Bliss-independence
theory36 to the normalized distance (Euclidean distance between
treatment groups and control, normalized to the maximum
distance between all points in the PCA scores plot) and estimated
the predicted distance (Table 3). For the combinations of UA with
either CUR or RES, the predicted combined affected fraction had
values lower than the experimental ones. Therefore, the combina-
tions of UA with the other natural compounds have synergistic
effects on cell metabolism according to the Bliss independence
based calculation.
The effect of the individual and combined treatments on
specific metabolic pathways was also evaluated using metabolic
pathway analysis (Table 4). In line with the results of the PCA,
pathway analysis indicated that treatment with RES alone induced
much smaller changes than the individual administration of CUR
or UA. UA, which induced the most significant metabolic changes
as an individual treatment, likely drives the changes for most
metabolic pathways when administered in combination with CUR
or RES. Notably, the administration of UA in combination with
both CUR or RES greatly enhanced the modulation of a number of
metabolic
pathways,
including
the
“Alanine,
aspartate
and
glutamate metabolism” and the “tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle”
(Table 4). To gain a better understanding of the specific molecular
basis responsible for these metabolic changes we performed
isotopic labeling of treated HMVP2 cells with 13C5,15N2-glutamine,
as this nutrient is metabolized through the pathways of interest
(according to the metabolic pathway analysis in Table 4).
Intracellularly,13C5,15N2-glutamine (Fig. 5) was detected at low
levels (as percentage of the total glutamine pool) in cells treated
with UA in combination with either CUR (5.4% ± 3.1%) and RES
(undetected). UA administration alone resulted in variable levels of
intracellular
13C5,15N2-glutamine (13.4% ± 23.2%) that are not
significantly different from those detected in the combined-
treatment samples. The low levels of 13C5,15N2-glutamine resulting
after the combined UA treatments could imply either that the
uptake of glutamine from the extracellular space is reduced
following UA-containing combined treatments or that glutamine
is rapidly converted (more so than with the other treatments) to
other metabolites following uptake. However, a very small flux of
labeled carbons was observed in TCA cycle intermediates as well
as other metabolic pathways (e.g. proline) in samples treated with
UA-containing agent combinations, in line with the reduced
glutamine uptake from the extracellular medium. Notably, the
amount of labeled glutamine flux in UA-containing combined
treatments is overall much lower than any of the individual agents
administered alone. The analysis of metabolite levels in the
extracellular space (in growth medium) indicated that glutamine
consumption over the 12 h treatment period was comparable (no
significant differences) for all treatments (data not shown).
However, the relatively small amount of glutamine uptake over
the short treatment period and the large initial glutamine levels in
the medium might mask the changes in glutamine uptake
resulting in the extracellular space.
Lipid metabolites.
The results of the intracellular lipid analysis are
included in Supplementary Results.
Effect of treatment with the natural compounds on relevant cell
signaling pathways
Since the combination of CUR + UA and UA + RES decreased the
uptake of glutamine and ASCT2 is the major glutamine transporter
in the cancer cells, the level of ASCT2 after treatment with
phytochemicals and their combinations was measured. As shown
in Fig. 6, CUR and RES alone did not alter the ASCT2 in HMVP2

 cells. However, UA, either alone or in combination with CUR or
RES, decreased the protein level of ASCT2. To further understand
the underlying mechanisms associated with the outcome of single
or combined phytochemical intervention, the effects of treatment
on several important cell signaling pathways involved in cancer,
such as AMPK, mTORC1, Src and STAT3 signaling, were explored.
As shown in Fig. 6, all the combination treatments decreased
phosphorylation of STAT3 both at tyrosine705 and serine727 more
than the reduction of phosphorylation resulting from any of the
single agents alone. Src is a known upstream regulator of
STAT3 signaling. All the combinations of these natural compounds
also decreased phosphorylation of Src (Fig. 6), with CUR + UA
inducing the largest effect. Next, the effect of the natural
compound combinations on AMPK and mTORC1 signaling were
examined. Both the combinations containing CUR (i.e., CUR + UA
and CUR + RES) resulted in rapid activation of AMPK and a
decrease in mTORC1 activity (as assessed by decrease in
phosphorylation
of
p70S6K
and
downstream
S6
ribosomal
protein). The combination of UA + RES also increased AMPK
phosphorylation and decreased mTORC1 activity at later time
points (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Since the combinations
of UA with CUR or RES showed concurrent activation of AMPK and
inhibition
of
mTORC1,
we
next
examined
AMPK
and
mTORC1 signaling with known regulators of these signaling
pathways, such as metformin (activator of AMPK) and rapamycin
(mTOR inhibitor) in HMVP2 and LNCaP cells. Consistent with our
previous report,37 metformin-activated AMPK and rapamycin
decreased mTORC1 signaling in both mouse and human PCa cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. 4). In line with the HMVP-2 results, the
combination treatments with natural compounds also decreased
STAT3 phosphorylation in DU145 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Importantly,
administration
of
the
combinations
of

 screen based on depletion of cellular ATP levels. Cellular ATP
levels are critical for cell survival, and several reports have shown
that reductions in cellular ATP levels can lead to apoptosis and
other types of cell death in cancer cells, depending on the level of
depletion.38–42 Based on cell viability (from ATP levels) of the
primary screen, we selected the top hit natural compound (UA)
and performed an additional secondary screen to investigate the
effect of the administration of the top hit in combination with the
natural compounds in the library. Notably, UA had previously been
shown to deplete ATP in a glioblastoma cell line leading to
necrotic cell death43 and to exert anticarcinogenic properties in
several animal models of cancer.18, 44–46
For the secondary analysis, we screened both cellular ATP
depletion levels and induction of ROS. Induction of ROS has been
previously associated with reduced tumor cell growth for a
number of tumor types.47 From the secondary screens, we
identified two additional compounds of interest (CUR and RES)
that induced marked reductions in cellular ATP levels when
administered in combination with UA. CUR and RES have both
been widely studied as chemopreventive agents.7, 48, 49 Clinical
trials have been conducted with both CUR and RES administered
as single agents for cancer chemoprevention.50–52 In particular,
CUR has been studied in a number of clinical trials, either
completed or ongoing, for a variety of cancers, including solid
tumors.53 In line with the results of previous reports,16 CUR alone
promoted increased ROS. However, all the other individual
treatments (UA and RES), as well as the combination of both
CUR and RES with UA either had no effect or induced drops in ROS
levels depending on the PCa cell line. Therefore, the combined
treatment efficacy observed in thisin vitro study is likely not
determined by induction of ROS but has an alternative molecular
origin. Before moving on to a more detailed investigation of the
molecular mechanism of action of the selected natural com-
pounds, we validated the effect of the combined treatments on
tumor growth in a mouse allograft model of PCa. The in vivo
studies provided further evidence that the selected natural
compound combinations were highly effective in slowing growth
of murine PCa cells. Notably, all the combinations of the selected
natural compounds led to synergistic effects on tumor volume
and weight (according to the Bliss index); in all cases, the
combined administration of these natural compounds produced
tumors of much smaller size than in untreated mice or mice
receiving the individual compounds, with the combinations of UA
with either CUR or RES yielding the best results.
Additional analysis of the treatment induced metabolic changes
revealed a strong influence of both the combinations of UA either
CUR or RES on glutamine/glutamate-related metabolic pathways.

 pointed to a decreased glutamine uptake from the extracellular
space in cells treated with UA in combination with CUR or RES.
Notably, the dependence on increased amino acid transport (i.e.,
increased expression of the amino acid transporters) for prostate
cell growth has been previously reported, as well as the hindered
PCa cell growth following inhibition of the ASCT2 glutamine
transporter.54, 55 In our study, the levels of ASCT2 decreased
following treatment with UA alone as well as its combinations
with either CUR or RES. Moreover, the combination of CUR + RES
also resulted in decreased levels of ASCT2 (although less dramatic
than for the other combinations). Therefore, the modulation of
ASCT2 alone did not fully explain our observation of glutamine
metabolism nor the possible association with the improved in vivo
outcome.
Recent studies reported that glutamine mediates oncogenic
transformation in highly invasive ovarian cancer cells through
STAT3
signaling.56
Given
the
decreased
cellular
uptake
of
glutamine
resulting
from
the
combined
treatments
with
UA + CUR and UA + RES, we performed Western blotting to probe
the level of phospho-STAT3. All three phytochemical combina-
tions decreased the phosphorylation of Stat3 at both serine and
tyrosine residues. Similarly, all three combinations also decreased
phosphorylation of Src, in line with previous studies that also
reported the decrease in Src phosphorylation in cells under
conditions of both glutamine and glucose deprivation.56 Our
additional mechanistic studies revealed a decrease in mTORC1
activity by the combination of phytochemicals. In this regard,
Wang et al. showed that knockdown of ASCT2 by shRNA in PC-3
cells decreased the mTORC1 activity (measured by p70S6K
phosphorylation) both in culture and in xenograft tumor tissues.54
Finally, as UA and the combinations decreased the cellular ATP
level and depletion of cellular ATP level is associated with AMPK
activation (reviewed in),57 we also measured the AMPK phosphor-
ylation after treatment with the individual agents or their
combinations. The combinations of CUR + UA and CUR + RES
induced AMPK activation compared to untreated samples or

μM CUR, UA, RES or their combinations of two compounds. The levels of the glutamine transporter ASCT2, and phospho and total protein
levels for Src, STAT3, AMPK, p70S6K and S6 were measured by Western blotting. Western blotting was performed two times with β-actin
controls for each experiment. Numbers above blots indicate band intensities (normalized to control). b The percent of apoptotic cells
(measured by Annexin V) and the levels of apoptotic markers (Western blotting) were probed after 24 h of treatment with the natural
compounds. One-way ANOVA with significance at p < 0.05 was used. Statistical significance is shown as different from control (a), CUR (b) and
UA (c)

 treatment with the individual agents. Activation of AMPK might
also be associated with the observed decrease in mTORC1 activity.
Overall, as is expected for natural compounds, the outcome
induced by the individual and, even more so, the combined
treatments is due to complex effects entailing several cellular
targets and pathways. While additional molecular targets are likely
to further contribute to the beneficial effect of treatment with the
selected natural compounds, the metabolic effect on glutamine
metabolism and the associated effects on several key signaling
pathways (STAT3/Src, mTORC1 and AMPK) likely contributed to
the induction of apoptosis observed in HMVP2 cells in vitro and
the synergistic inhibitory effects on tumor growth observed
in vivo.
In conclusion, an initial screening approach has been developed
to identify potential synergistic phytochemical combinations
with chemopreventive/therapeutic efficacy for inhibiting growth
of PCa and possibly other cancer cells. The ability of combinations to
synergistically inhibit tumor growth was linked to synergistic changes
in glutamine metabolism, the associated modulation of STAT3/Src,
mTORC1 and AMPK signaling, and induction of apoptosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell cultures
The HMVP2 murine PCa cell line derived from 1 year old HiMyc transgenic
mice and NMVP cell line derived from FVB/N mice was cultured and
spheroids generated as recently described.34 Human PCa cell lines, LNCaP,
DU145, PC-3 and C4-2B were purchased from the American type culture
collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). All cell lines were grown in 95% air
and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Both murine and human cell lines were maintained in
RPMI-1640 medium (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) and supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 2 mM glutamine (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA). All the experiments were performed within
6–12 months of cell line authentication (using short tandem repeat
analysis; PowerPlex 1.2 System, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and
mycoplasma testing (MycoAlert; Lonza, Rockland, ME, USA).
High-throughput screening
A NCL of 142 phytochemicals (Supplementary Table 1) was screened on
PCa cells. The NCL includes Selleck Chemicals’ NCL (Houston, TX, USA) and
11 additional natural compounds. Betulinic acid, caffeic acid phenylethyl
ester, genistein, palmatine chloride, shikonin and RES were purchased from
CaymanChemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, USA), whereas >98% pure corosolic acid,
epi-maslinic acid, epi-UA, epi-corosolic and maslinic acid were prepared as
recently described.58, 59 For all screens, cells in exponential proliferation
were seeded in 384-well plates using a Viaflo Assist micro-plate dispenser
(Integra Biosciences, Hudson, NH, USA) and allowed to adhere overnight.
During the primary screening, HMVP2 cells were screened with the
individual NCL compounds at 3 time-points (12, 24 or 48 h) and three
doses (5, 10, 20 µM final concentration). A secondary screen was then
performed on both the murine and human cell lines treated for 12 h with
combinations of two compounds administered at the same concentration
(20 µM final concentration). The NCL was dispensed into the seeded 384-
well plates using the Viaflo-384 liquid-handling system (Integra Bios-
ciences). To reduce bias, the treatments were administered based on a
randomized list of well positions.
Two bioluminescence assays, CellTiter-Glo kit and ROS-Glo kit (both from
Promega, Madison, WI), were used according to the manufacturer’s
protocols to measure cell viability and ROS. Both ATP and ROS-based
measurements were acquired on a SpectraMax M5e Series Multi-Mode
Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with 4 replicates per
condition. Relative luminescence values were calculated as the lumines-
cence value of the treated sample over that of solvent control cells within
the same plate.
In addition, the NMVP and HMVP2 cell lines were seeded in 96-well
plates and treated with docetaxel at 1, 10, 25, 50,100 and 250 nM for 12 h.
Cell viability was investigated by performing the ATP bioluminescence
assay.
In vivo tumor growth
All animal husbandry and experiments were carried out in strict
accordance to guidelines defined by the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and approved by the institutional
animal research committees at The University of Texas at Austin.
Spheroids generated from HMVP2 cells were injected subcutaneously
into the flank of male FVB/N mice. Thirteen days after injection of
spheroids, treatment with the natural compounds was started by switching
animals to semipurified AIN76A-based diets containing 1.0% CUR, 0.2% UA,
0.5% RES or their combinations (all ad libitum). Body weight and food
consumption were monitored weekly in all groups. Starting on day 1 of
treatment, tumor volume was measured twice weekly using digital
calipers. Treatment was continued for 32 days and the experiment was
terminated 45 days after injection of the tumor cell spheroids. At the end
of the treatment period, mice were killed, and tumors were excised and
weighed. The effect on tumor weight and volume was also evaluated
following treatment with docetaxel. Four days after the injection of
spheroids, mice were treated weekly with docetaxel (20 mg/kg body
weight with half of the drug volume injected intraperitoneally and half
subcutaneously) for four consecutive weeks. Tumor volume was measured
weekly and tumor weight was measured at the end of the study.
HMVP2 cell extracts for metabolomics and isotopic labeling
analysis
HMVP2 cells were treated for 12 h with either solvent control dimethyl
sulfoxide or UA, CUR and RES administered alone or in combination. For
the glutamine flux analysis, natural abundance glutamine in the medium
was completely replaced with 13C5, 15N2-glutamine (Cambridge Isotopes
Laboratories, Inc.). At the end of the 12-h treatment period, an aliquot of
media was collected from each flask for extracellular analysis. Cells were
washed twice with PBS, harvested and intracellular metabolites were
extracted using a modified Bligh-Dyer procedure, as previously reported60–
63 (as described in Supplementary Information).
MRS-based metabolomics analysis
Polar samples for MRS analysis were resuspended in 45 µl of 0.1 M
phosphate buffer in 90% D2O with 1 mM TSP, 0.05% NaN3, vortexed and
centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. Thirty-five microliters of the supernatant
were transferred into 1.7-mm tubes. One dimensional 1H MRS spectra were
acquired and processed as previously described29, 63, 64 (as described
in Supplementary Information).
MS-based metabolomics analysis
Both polar and lipid analyses were analyzed on a Q Exactive Hybrid
Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Sci., Bremen,
Germany). Sources for all solvents and reagents, and more detailed
experimental procedures are included in Supplementary Information.
Chromatographic separation was performed on a Thermo Scientific
(Thermo Fisher Sci., San José, CA, USA) Accela UHPLC system equipped
with a quaternary pump, vacuum degasser and an open autosampler with
a temperature controller. MS analysis was carried out on a QEx active
benchtop Orbitrap detector loading an electrospray (ESI) source simulta-
neously operating in fast negative/positive polarity switching ionization
mode. For all sample types (media, and polar and apolar intracellular
fractions), quality control samples were run once every five samples.
All raw MS datasets were processed using Sieve 2.2 (Thermo Scientific)
and mined against an in-house database of accurate masses and retention
times generated in our laboratory using the IROA 300, MS Metabolite
Library of Standards (IROA Technologies, Bolton, MA). In addition,
databases of accurate masses taken from the KEGG database65 and the
Human Metabolome database66 were also mined. MS data were then
combined to the MRS data for the subsequent post-processing, followed
by univariate and multivariate statistical analyses.
Treatment of HMVP2 cells and western blotting
HMVP2 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of CUR, UA,
RES or their combinations for the specified time (2, 6,and 24 h).
Experimental procedures and the specific primary antibodies used are
detailed in Supplementary Information. For all the Western blots shown,
samples were derived from the same experiment and were processed in
parallel. Molecular weight markers are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5.

 Statistical and pathway analyses and evaluation of synergy
between natural compounds
For the screens, Z factor was calculated from ATP values to identify top-hit
compounds as previously reported. Z-factor values between 0.5 and 1
were considered as excellent separation of groups; 0 ≤ Z ≤ 0.5 as moderate
separation while Z = 0 as poor separation.
For the in vivo data, one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used
with p < 0.05 considered significant.
PCA was carried out in PLS-Toolbox (Eigenvector Research, Manson, WA,
USA). Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the Euclidean
distance and average linkage clustering methods on the intracellular
levels (normalized to control) of all the identified metabolites. The
pathway analysis of the polar metabolites was carried out using
MetaboAnalyst 3.0.67
To evaluate whether the combination of two natural compounds
induced any synergistic effects compared to the individual effectiveness
we used the Bliss Independence Model.36 This approach is based on the
probabilistic
concept
of
independence;
it
predicts
the
theoretical
combined affected fraction C following treatment with two combined
single agents with individual affected fractions A and B, according to
the formula C = A + B – AB. The predicted combined affected fraction
with values lower than the experimental one is considered synergistic.36
