Summary
Background Very late (aged ≥60 years) onset schizophrenia-like psychosis occurs frequently but no placebo-controlled, 
randomised trials have assessed the efficacy and risks of antipsychotic treatment. We investigated whether low-dose 
amisulpride (100 mg daily) is superior to placebo in reducing psychosis symptoms over 12 weeks and whether any 
benefit is maintained by continuing treatment after 12 weeks.
Methods The ATLAS double-blind controlled trial enrolled participants from 25 old age psychiatry services in the UK. 
Eligible participants (ie, those with a diagnosis of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis and a Brief Psychiatric 
Rating Scale [BPRS] score of ≥30, without cognitive impairment) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three 
groups in a two-stage trial: amisulpride in stage 1 and 2 (group A), amisulpride then placebo (group B), or placebo 
then amisulpride (group C). Treatment (100 mg oral amisulpride daily vs placebo) was given for 12 weeks in stage 1 
and, initially, 24 weeks then reduced to 12 weeks in stage 2. Participants, investigators, and outcome assessors were 
masked to treatment allocation. Primary outcomes were psychosis symptoms assessed by the BPRS at 4, 12, and 24, 
or 36 weeks, and trial treatment discontinuation for non-efficacy. The primary, secondary, and safety endpoints were 
all analysed in participants given at least one dose of study treatment in modified intention-to-treat analyses. This 
study is registered with EudraCT, number 2010-022184-35, and ISRCTN, number ISRCTN45593573.
Findings Between Sept 27, 2012, and June 28, 2016, we recruited 101 participants. 92 (91%) of 101 participants took 
trial medication, of whom 59 (64%) completed stage 1 and 34 (58%) of these 59 participants completed stage 2 
treatment. Despite suboptimal compliance, improvements in BPRS scores at 12 weeks were 7·7 points (95% CI 
3·8–11·5, p=0·0002) greater with amisulpride (mean 11·9 points [SE 1·3]) than with placebo (4·2 points [1·0]). In 
stage 2, BPRS scores improved by a mean of 1·1 points (1·6) from 12 weeks to the final assessment in those who 
continued amisulpride but deteriorated by 5·2 points (2·0) in those who switched from amisulpride to placebo 
(difference 6·3 points [95% CI 0·9–11·7], p=0·024). Fewer participants who were allocated amisulpride than placebo 
stopped treatment because of non-efficacy in stage 1 (p=0·010) and stage 2 (p=0·031). Serious adverse events were 
reported more frequently in the amisulpride group than in the placebo group in stage 1 (p=0·057) and stage 2 
(p=0·19). The most common serious adverse events were infection (five patients in the amisulpride group, three in 
the placebo group) and extrapyramidal side-effects (three patients in the amisulpride group, none in the placebo 
group). Five patients died during the study, one from a gastric ulcer bleed before treatment started (group B), two 
while taking stage 2 treatment (one in group A and one in group C), and two who stopped trial treatment in stage 1 
and died many weeks later (one in group B and one in group C). No deaths were related to treatment.
Interpretation Low-dose amisulpride is effective and well tolerated as a treatment for very late-onset schizophrenia-like 
psychosis, with benefits maintained by prolonging treatment.

Introduction
Onset of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis most 
commonly occurs in late adolescence or early adult life, 
although a late-onset (aged ≥60 years) variant of 
non-affective functional psychosis without dementia has 
long been recognised,1 and is classified as very late-onset 
schizophrenia-like psychosis.2 After dementia and 
depression, very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis 
is the largest diagnostic group seen by older people’s 
mental health services, with a reported annual incidence 
of 27 per 100 000 men and 48 per 100 000 women.3 Female 
sex, increasing age, sensory impairment, and migrant 
status are risk factors but, in contrast to schizophrenia, 
genetic factors have not been implicated in the aetiology 
of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis.2–5 Older 
people with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis 
present with positive psychosis symptoms, typically 
persecutory delusions with or without multimodal

hallucinations, which are distressing, persist for many 
years, and are associated with increased risks of social 
dysfunction, institutionalisation, and death.6,7
Although atypical antipsychotics are used to treat very 
late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis, their benefits 
and risks have not been properly evaluated. To our 
knowledge, the only evidence for efficacy is from a 
retrospective review of case notes8 and one single-arm, 
5-week trial of amisulpride that reported improvements 
in psychosis without worsening of extrapyramidal 
symptoms.9 No randomised placebo-controlled trial data 
are available to guide antipsychotic treatment in very 
late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis.10 Clinicians’ 
concerns about the poor efficacy and substantial risks 
associated with the prescribing of antipsychotic drugs 
for older people with Alzheimer’s disease,11,12 com-
pounded by the characteristic impairment of insight into 
the potential value of treatment among patients with 
very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis, have 
resulted in less than half of eligible patients currently 
receiving treatment.13
The primary aims of the antipsychotic treatment of 
very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (ATLAS) 
trial were to determine whether 12 weeks of treatment 
for very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis with 
low-dose amisulpride (100 mg daily) improves psychiatric 
symptom scores compared with placebo, and whether 
prolonged treatment with 100 mg amisulpride beyond 
12 weeks confers additional benefit. We also aimed to 
assess side-effects and serious adverse events associated 
with amisulpride treatment, compliance with allocated 
treatment in this difficult-to-treat population, and the 
effects of treatment on quality of life.
Methods
Study design
ATLAS was a pragmatic, randomised, three-arm, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with two stages. In 
stage 1, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of 
oral amisulpride over 12 weeks compared with placebo. 
In stage 2, we investigated the effects of continuing 
amisulpride versus withdrawal to placebo. Stage 2 
treatment was initially planned to last 24 weeks, but the 
protocol was amended to reduce the duration to 12 weeks 
to increase the number of patients still being treated at 
the final assessment.
People with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psy-
chosis often have little insight into their illness or the 
possibility that antipsychotic treatment could improve 
their symptoms; therefore we did not consider it 
practicable to involve patients directly in the design or 
management of the trial. Instead, the Service User 
Research Enterprise at the Institute of Psychiatry, 
Psychology and Neuroscience, King’s College London 
(London, UK) advised on the choice of outcome 
measures, trial procedures, and on the use of language in 
trial patient information and consenting materials.
The study was done in compliance with the principles 
of the Declaration of Helsinki (1996) and the principles 
of Good Clinical Practice, and was reviewed and 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and the Cochrane database on 
Jan 13, 2017, for relevant articles, using the search terms 
“late-onset schizophrenia”, “very late-onset 
schizophrenia-like”, “clinical trial”, and “treatment”, with no 
date or language restrictions. We did not find any randomised, 
controlled, double-blind trials in this patient group with onset 
of a schizophrenia-like illness at age 60 years or older. 
Available evidence for the use of antipsychotics in very 
late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis comes from one 
single-arm trial of 5 weeks of treatment with amisulpride that 
reported improvements in psychosis symptoms without 
significant extrapyramidal side-effects and from retrospective 
case-note reviews and published expert opinion. Because of 
the absence of reliable evidence on the benefits of 
antipsychotic treatment and high-profile reports of 
questionable efficacy and adverse safety of such treatment in 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease and psychosis, there are 
concerns that the risks of antipsychotics in an older patient 
group, who are potentially vulnerable to such side-effects, 
might outweigh any benefits. Furthermore, patients with very 
late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis usually have scarce 
insight into the potential value of taking antipsychotic 
treatment, hence most patients with such psychosis have not 
engaged with antipsychotic treatment.
Added value of this study
This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial provides 
the first reliable evidence that an antipsychotic drug 
(amisulpride 100 mg daily) is superior to placebo in reducing 
psychosis symptoms over 12 weeks and 24 weeks in patients 
with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis. The treatment 
effect size from 24 weeks of amisulpride was large despite 
suboptimal compliance. Treatment was well tolerated with 
similar discontinuation rates for side-effects with amisulpride 
and placebo, despite a modest increase in extrapyramidal 
symptoms in patients given amisulpride.
Implications of all the available evidence
Psychosis symptoms in patients with very late-onset 
schizophrenia-like psychosis show a good and sustained 
response to amisulpride (100 mg/day) and this treatment is 
well tolerated. This randomised controlled trial is the first to 
show evidence of clear benefits from antipsychotic treatment 
in a situation where physicians might previously have shared 
the reluctance or ambivalence of their patients about such 
treatment.

approved by The London and Surrey Borders Multicentre 
Research Ethics Committee (reference 11/LO/1267) and 
the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory 
Agency. The protocol is given in the appendix.
Participants
We recruited patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-
like psychosis from community and inpatient specialist 
old age psychiatry services within the UK National Health 
Service. Eligibility criteria were diagnosis of very late-onset 
schizophrenia-like psychosis according to International 
Consensus Group Criteria,2 including onset of delusions 
or hallucinations, or both, at age 60 years or older, BPRS 
score14 of 30 or greater, and capacity to give informed 
consent to participate in the trial. Exclusion criteria were 
cognitive impairment or a standardised Mini Mental State 
Examination15 score of less than 25, diagnosis of affective 
disorder, uncontrolled serious physical illness, prescribed 
amisulpride in the previous 28 days, contraindications to 
amisulpride, and participation in another clinical trial of 
an investigational medicinal product in the previous 
28 days. Participants with conditions that would prevent 
them from having a blood test were excluded from the 
optional blood tests, but not the full trial. People treated 
with antipsychotics other than amisulpride in the 28 days 
before enrolment but who still satisfied eligibility criteria, 
and for whom stopping their current antipsychotic was 
considered 
appropriate, 
could 
participate. 
These 
participants stopped antipsychotic treatment the day 
before starting trial medication. Participants were given 
an information sheet about the study and the trial 
procedures were explained to them, after which 
participants gave written informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Once informed consent was given and baseline as-
sessments were done, we randomly allocated participants 
in a 1:1:1 ratio, using a centralised randomisation service, 
to one of three groups: amisulpride (group A); amisulpride 
followed by placebo (group B); or placebo followed by 
amisulpride (group C). Treatment packs were allocated 
centrally by the ATLAS study office. The minimised 
randomisation procedure aimed to balance treatment 
allocation (as much as possible given available packs at 
each centre) overall, and by six stratification variables: age 
(60–69, 70–79, ≥80 years), sex, living circumstances (living 
with spouse or partner, living alone, other), time since 
onset of symptoms (<6 months, ≥6 months), previous 
antipsychotic treatment (no, yes >1 month previously, yes 
≤28 days ago), and BPRS score (30–39, 40–49, ≥50). 
Participants were enrolled by their clinicians, clinical study 
officers, or ATLAS trial research nurses. These staff did 
outcome assessments. Amisulpride and placebo were 
provided in identical overencapsulated treatment cartons 
to maintain blinding. Participants, prescribing clinicians, 
outcome assessors, and all ATLAS trial staff (except 
statisticians) were masked to group assignment. 
Procedures
Participants were given overencapsulated 100 mg 
amisulpride or placebo in 12-week treatment cartons, 
each containing three 28-day blister packs. Group A took 
one capsule containing 100 mg amisulpride daily for 
36 weeks (24 weeks for patients enrolled after the protocol 
amendment). Group B took one capsule containing 
100 mg amisulpride daily for 12 weeks followed by one 
matching placebo capsule daily for a further 24 weeks 
(12 weeks for patients enrolled after the protocol 
amendment). Group C took one placebo capsule daily for 
12 weeks followed by one 100 mg amisulpride capsule 
daily for a further 24 weeks (12 weeks for patients 
enrolled after the protocol amendment). Data from 
participants in group C were not used for trial analyses in 
stage 2 because there was not an appropriate comparator 
group. Information on compliance and the number of 
tablets taken was collected at each follow-up assessment 
and pills were counted to confirm reported compliance. 
Adverse events were recorded at each visit from a 
checklist of anticipated side-effects of amisulpride and 
free text recording of adverse events.
To determine whether there was an association 
between compliance and baseline characteristics, we 
compared the baseline characteristics of completers 
and dropouts using time to dropout.
Outcomes
Outcomes were assessed at 4 and 12 weeks and at 24 or 
36 weeks for all participants regardless of whether or not 
they continued to take trial medication. The first primary 
outcome was change in psychosis symptoms, assessed 
by the BPRS score, between baseline and week 12 and 
between week 12 and the final assessment (week 24 or 
36). The BPRS is a widely used clinician-rated instrument 
for the assessment of positive, negative, and affective 
symptoms in patients with psychotic disorders and was 
chosen because it covers the important symptoms 
elicited in patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like 
psychosis.16 It has been shown to be sensitive to 
improvements in symptoms associated with anti-
psychotic treatment in patients with very late-onset 
schizophrenia-like 
psychosis,9 
and 
even 
clinically 
inexperienced raters can show test-retest reliability of 
over 90% if provided with guidance for the structured 
interview.17 Each of the 18 BPRS symptom constructs is 
assessed by the rater on a seven-point scale ranging from 
1 (absent) to 7 (extremely severe). The total score (18–126) 
is calculated by summing the scores from the 
18 items, with higher scores indicating more severe 
psychopathology. The BPRS was developed as a scale to 
measure general psychopathology in a wide range of 
psychiatric disorders and our prior hypothesis was that 
benefits of amisulpride would be most apparent on the 
six items (hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinations, un-
usual thought content, tension, and uncooperativeness) 
that most closely reflect the symptomatology of very

late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis; therefore we did 
a prespecified analysis of the change in the combined 
scores from these six BPRS domains.
The second primary outcome was the proportion of 
patients who withdrew from trial treatment because of a 
perceived absence of efficacy between baseline and 
week 12 and between week 13 and the final assessment.
Secondary outcomes were extrapyramidal side-effects, 
measured with the Simpson Angus Scale, which assesses 
nine extrapyramidal signs (gait, arm dropping, shoulder 
shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, leg pendulousness, 
glabellar tap, tremor, and salivation) by direct examination;18 
compliance expressed as proportion of participants who 
discontinued treatment and as percentage of prescribed 
medication taken between weeks 1 and 12 and between 
weeks 13 and 24; quality of life measured with the WHO 
Quality of Life Scale19 and the EuroQol-5D;20 and resource 
usage measured with the Client Service Receipt Inventory.21 
A full economic analysis will be reported separately. 
Pharmacokinetics (ie, blood concentrations of amisulpride 
and the hormone prolactin) were analysed in patients who 
consented to an optional blood test. These data will be 
published separately.
Statistical analysis
Since patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like 
psychosis have rarely been recruited to randomised 
controlled trials, we used an initial feasibility phase to 
assess recruitment and retention, after which the initial 
target sample size of 300 randomised participants was 
pragmatically reduced to 100. This reduction was made 
because of the practical difficulties involved in the 
recruitment of people with this diagnosis, who are largely 
without insight into the presence of illness or the possible 
benefits of treatment. On the basis of a 5-point 
improvement on the BPRS being a minimal clinically 
important difference and the assumption that the SD of 
BPRS measures would be 9 points, we powered the trial 
to detect a moderate treatment effect of 0·56 SDs.22

completed outcome assessments at 12 weeks, this design 
would provide 70% power at p<0·05 (two-sided) to detect 
the 5-point minimal clinically important difference in 
BPRS, and over 80% power to detect a 6-point difference 
in BPRS in stage 1.
Participants who received at least one dose of study 
treatment were included in the modified intention to 
treat analyses of all primary and secondary outcomes 
using standard Student’s t test and repeated measures 
regression methods.23 For patients who were assessed at 
4 weeks but not at 12 weeks, the 4-week assessment was 
carried forward for the 12-week comparisons of change 
from baseline. For  sensitivity analyses, we analysed the 
data with and without using last observation carried 
forward to check for any differences. We used SAS 
software (version 9.3) for all statistical analyses. An 
independent data monitoring and ethics committee 
reviewed and monitored the unblinded accumulating 
data and the safety of patients in the study. This study is 
registered with EudraCT, number 2010-022184-35, and

Health Service mental health trusts in England and 
Scotland. Nine randomised patients did not start trial 
medication and, as prespecified in the protocol, were 
excluded from all analyses; one participant had been 
allocated to group A, four to group B, and four to 
group C (figure 1). Baseline characteristics were well 
balanced across all treatment groups at stage 1 baseline. 
 
Mean age was 80·2 years (SD 6·9), and most participants 
were female, lived alone, and had symptoms for longer 
than 6 months; about half of patients had taken 
antipsychotic treatment previously and BPRS scores 
averaged 41·3 (7·9; table 1) at stage 1 baseline. BPRS 
assessments were done for 92 (100%) of 92 participants 
at baseline, 87 (95%) of 92 at 4 weeks, 83 (90%) of 92 at 
12 weeks, and 54 (92%) of 59 at final assessment.
14 (15%) of 92 participants had stopped taking trial 
medication by 4 weeks and a further 19 (21%) of 
92 participants stopped between weeks 4 and 12 of stage 1 
treatment. Of the remaining 59 participants who entered 
stage 2, 34 (58%) completed the 24 weeks (or later, 
12 weeks) of stage 2 treatment (figure 1).
BPRS scores were significantly lower at weeks 4 and 
12 than at baseline in both the amisulpride and placebo 
groups (figure 2; appendix) Improvements in BPRS 
scores over the 12 weeks of stage 1 treatment were 
significantly greater with amisulpride (groups A and B) 
than with placebo (group C). The difference in change in 
BPRS scores in favour of amisulpride versus placebo 
was clear at 4 weeks (6·7 point difference, 95% CI 
3·2–10·3; p=0·0003) and increased to 7·7 points 
(3·8–11·5) at 12 weeks, which is a mean improvement of 
11·9 points (SE 1·3) with amisulpride versus 4·2 points 
(1·0) with placebo between baseline and week 12 
(p=0·0002). The average difference over the first 
12 weeks was similar in a repeated measures multilevel 
model (6·1 points, 95% CI 2·4–9·8; p=0·001), and in 
sensitivity analyses that did not include the observations 
at week 4 that were carried forward for six patients 
without assessments at week 12 (data not shown).
Of the 41 patients in the stage 2 comparison of 
continuing versus stopping amisulpride, 30 were allocated 
to the 36-week schedule (15 continued amisulpride, 
15 stopped amisulpride) and 11 were allocated to the 
24-week schedule (four continued amisulpride, seven 
stopped amisulpride). BPRS scores improved by a mean 
of 1·1 points (SE 1·6) from 12 weeks to the final assessment 
in patients continuing amisulpride (group A), but 
deteriorated by 5·2 points (2·0) in those switching from 
amisulpride to placebo (group B; difference 6·3 points 
[95% CI 0·9–11·7]; p=0·024; figure 2). An analysis of 
outcomes in stage 2 stratified by treatment period 
(ie, 24 weeks or 36 weeks) produced similar findings to 
those of the unstratified analysis.
Examination of change in the combined scores from 
the six BPRS domains that were hypothesised to be 
most likely to show change in response to effective 
treatment showed that most of the benefit from 
amisulpride was seen in these domains. The difference 
in the 6-item score between amisulpride and placebo 
was 4·1 points (95% CI 1·9–6·2, p=0·0003) at 4 weeks, 
5·3 points (95% CI 2·9–8·7; p<0·0001) at 12 weeks, and 
4·6 points (95% CI 1·3–8·0; p=0·008) at the final 
assessment (appendix). The effect of amisulpride on the 
remaining 12 symptoms on the BPRS at 12 weeks was 
small, with a reduction of 2·4 points (95% CI 0·0–4·8; 
p=0·053).
41 (67%) of 61 participants allocated to amisulpride 
and 18 (58%) of 31 allocated to placebo completed 
stage 1 treatment (p=0·39, table 2). When reasons for 
stopping treatment were compared, fewer participants 
allocated to amisulpride than to placebo stopped 
because of non-efficacy (p=0·010). Similarly, fewer 
participants allocated to continue amisulpride in stage 2 
stopped because of perceived non-efficacy than those

who switched to placebo (p=0·031). No association was 
found between compliance and baseline characteristics 
(data not shown).
There were no significant differences between 
amisulpride and placebo in any of the secondary 
outcome measures in stage 1 or stage 2. Neither group 
had an improvement from baseline on either the 
EuroQol-5D utility score (figure 3) or any of the 
four WHO Quality of Life Scale domains (appendix), nor 
were differences in change from baseline between 
the amisulpride and placebo groups significant. For 
example, at week 12 in stage 1, EuroQol-5D utility scores 
improved by a mean of 0·027 (SE 0·029) with 
amisulpride and deteriorated by 0·009 (0·038) with 
placebo, but this difference was not significant (0·036 
[95% CI –0·060 to 0·133], p=0·47; figure 3). Similarly, no 
significant differences between the two groups were 
seen for any of the subscales of the WHO Quality of Life 
Scale (appendix).
No significant differences in change in Simpson Angus 
Scale scores were seen between participants given 
amisulpride versus placebo (appendix). However, seven 
(11%) of 61 patients allocated to amisulpride developed 
clinically significant (ie, Simpson Angus Scale scores ≥6)18 
extrapyramidal side-effects in stage 1, compared with 
none of the 31 patients given placebo (p=0·051). Serious 
adverse events were reported more frequently in the 
amisulpride group than in the placebo group in both 
stages (table 3). Three participants were admitted to 
hospital because of extrapyramidal symptoms that were 
considered to be related to treatment; all of these patients 
received amisulpride. More patients who received 
amisulpride 
reported 
side-effects 
deemed 
to 
be 
treatment-related by the study investigators than did 
those given placebo, with most of the excess due to 
potentially extrapyramidal symptoms (appendix). Falls 
were also more common in the amisulpride group than 
in the placebo group, but this difference was not 
significant (table 3). Five patients died during the study, 
one from a gastric ulcer bleed before treatment started, 
two while taking stage 2 treatment (chest infection in 
group A and myocardial infarction in group C), and two 
who stopped trial treatment in stage 1 and died many 
weeks later (hypertensive disease in group B and 
septicaemia in group C). No deaths were related to 
treatment.

Treatment efficacy in the amisulpride group, as 
measured by changes in BPRS over the first 12 weeks, 
did not differ according to baseline characteristics 
(figure 4). Significant benefits were seen in patients who 
had taken antipsychotics previously, those with a longer 
duration of symptoms, and those with more severe 
symptoms.
Discussion
The ATLAS trial shows that a single daily dose of 100 mg 
amisulpride is an effective treatment for the symptoms 
of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis. The 
mean improvement in psychosis symptoms of 12 BPRS 
points with amisulpride we report is similar to the mean 
BPRS change of 14 points seen in a previous open-label 
study.9 However, a significant 4-point improvement in 
BPRS scores from baseline was also seen in our placebo 
group, showing that the net benefit of amisulpride is 
around 8 BPRS points compared with placebo. Although 
this 8-point difference in change in BPRS score would 
probably have been larger with better compliance, it is 
close to one standard deviation (8·8 points), indicating a 
large effect size.22
If a worthwhile benefit is defined as a 0·5 SD 
improvement24—which at 4·7 BPRS points is close to our 
predefined minimal worthwhile improvement of 5 BPRS 
points—then at the week 12 assessment, 45 (74%) of 
61 participants in the amisulpride group compared with 
14 (45%) of 31 participants in the placebo group had an 
improvement in BPRS score of 0·5 SD (p=0·007; post-
hoc analysis). Alternative definitions of worthwhile 
benefit, such as a 25% reduction in BPRS score,25 produce 
similar estimates of about three patients as the number 
needed to treat to have one worthwhile benefit.
This benefit of amisulpride in very late-onset 
schizophrenia-like psychosis is substantially greater than 
the moderate effect sizes of around 0·5 SD reported 
from a meta-analysis26 of trials of antipsychotics in the 
reduction of psychosis symptoms in schizophrenia, and 
the small effect sizes of 0·15–0·2 SD reported from 
meta-analyses27,28 of antipsychotic trials in psychosis 
associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Our results should, 
therefore, encourage clinicians to be optimistic about the 
benefits of antipsychotic treatment in a group of patients 
who are generally undertreated.13
Although we chose to use amisulpride, a limbic-selective 
D₂ and D₃ antagonist,29 in ATLAS because it is relatively 
non-sedating (which helps to maintain compliance and 
blinding of treatment allocation), we would expect similar 
results with other antipsychotics. The recommended 
daily dose of amisulpride for patients with early onset 
schizophrenia is 400–800 mg, but our data show that a 
much lower dose (100 mg/day) can improve symptoms in 
patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis.
We tested 100 mg/day of amisulpride because we 
believed that it would be unlikely to induce important 
extrapyramidal side-effects, since an open-label trial9 
had already shown that this daily dose of amisulpride is 
probably effective and well tolerated in our study

population. Although our data suggest a moderate 
increase in extrapyramidal side-effects even at this low 
dose, these side-effects are not of sufficient frequency 
or severity to affect compliance or the benefits of 
amisulpride, even with up to 36 weeks of treatment. 
This finding is consistent with results from a PET 
study30 showing that people with Alzheimer’s disease 
receiving 50 mg/day amisulpride to treat psychosis 
symptoms had a higher occupancy of striatal dopamine 
receptors (40–80%) than was anticipated, which 
increases risk of extrapyramidal side-effects. The mean 
age of ATLAS participants was around 80 years, 
therefore exposure to high-dose antipsychotics would be 
expected to produce a substantially increased risk of 
such side-effects. These effects can be distressing and 
disfiguring, lead to reduced mobility and increased 
falls, and represent an important disincentive to both 
prescription and treatment adherence in this patient 
group. Differences between schizophrenia, psychosis in 
Alzheimer’s disease, and very late-onset schizophrenia-
like psychosis in antipsychotic efficacy, and the dose at 
which extrapyramidal side-effects appear are further 
evidence that these are distinct illnesses with specific 
treatment requirements.
Although 
amisulpride 
improved 
clinician-rated 
psychosis symptoms in the ATLAS trial, successful 
treatment did not result in participant-rated, subjective 
changes in health-related quality of life, as measured by 
the EuroQol-5D or WHO Quality of Life Scale,19,20 which 
might reflect a poor awareness that psychotic symptoms 
could be occurring as part of an illness.31 If participants 
do not recognise that they are unwell or that antipsychotic 
treatment might improve their symptoms or situation, 
they are not likely to rate themselves or their situation 
as better. We used generic quality of life instruments 
because of a absence of validated measures for this 
population. The absence of notable changes in participant 
quality of life could be due to insufficient statistical 
power to detect small differences, but could also reflect 
an insensitivity of such generic quality-of-life assessments, 
which focus on physical and mood difficulties in a 
participant group for whom changes in these domains 
are not likely to take place with treatment. We had similar 
problems with the sensitivity of the Simpson Angus 
Scale, which could not detect clinically significant 
differences in potentially extrapyramidal symptoms 
reported by participants.
The main limitation of our study was that recruitment 
was lower than expected. Despite our sample size, there 
was sufficient statistical power to show the substantial 
benefit of amisulpride over the first 12 weeks of 
treatment, even with only 100 patients randomised and 
suboptimal compliance. The benefits of continuing 
amisulpride compared with stopping after 12 weeks 
appeared to be similar to those in the first 12 weeks. 
However, with only 41 participants completing the first 
12 weeks of treatment and entering the second 
randomisation between continuing and stopping 
amisulpride, this result, although plausible, requires 
confirmation in a larger study population. A further 
limitation was the variable duration of this second stage 
of treatment, which was initially 24 weeks but was 
reduced to 12 weeks to improve compliance, making it 
difficult to recommend an optimal duration of treatment. 
Missing outcome assessments can also introduce bias, 
particularly if participants with missing assessments are 
atypical, for example having worse than average 
symptoms. However, few patients in this study had no 
post-randomisation assessments and we tried to limit 
potential bias from missing data by carrying forward 
assessments from week 4, for the few participants who 
were not assessed at week 12. Results were similar with 
or without this imputation, thus we do not believe that 
the few missing assessments had any substantial effect 
on our conclusions.
The greatest difficulty we encountered with recruitment 
to the ATLAS trial was the inability of many potential 
participants to appreciate that antipsychotic treatment 
could benefit them. Insight into the presence of illness 
and the possible benefits of treatment is uncommon in 
this group,31 who are often only persuaded to take 
antipsychotic medication by the argument that it might 
improve their sleep or anxiety, rather than because it 
might help with their psychosis symptoms. Notably, some 
patients said that they had been motivated to participate 
in this study because their clinical teams were advocating 
the use of antipsychotic treatment and they recognised 
that involvement in the trial carried a 1 in 3 chance of 
allocation to placebo, which they found attractive.
Although substantial numbers of patients declined to 
take part in the ATLAS trial, the clear benefits seen in 
our study population should be reproducible in usual 
clinical practice. Those who took part in ATLAS are 
likely to be representative of the patients with very late-
onset schizophrenia-like psychosis that clinicians can 
successfully engage with drug treatment in usual 
practice. Similarly, some participants in the ATLAS 
trial might have had dementia pathologies, but this 
potential diagnostic heterogeneity will also be true of 
any group of patients considered by their psychiatrists 
to have very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis 
and so the results of the ATLAS trial will apply to the 
treatment of typical future patients despite occasional 
diagnostic uncertainty.
The difficulties we experienced in recruiting patients to 
the ATLAS trial reflect the more general challenge of 
engaging this clinical population in treatment. Even 
when patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like 
psychosis cooperate with a specialist mental health team 
for assessment, less than half will agree to take an 
antipsychotic and less than a third will be on treatment at 
12-month follow-up or at the point of discharge to 
primary care.13 Such low prevalence of antipsychotic 
treatment would be considered unacceptable in younger

people with schizophrenia and the clear evidence of 
benefits from antipsychotic treatment shown in the 
ATLAS trial should encourage clinicians to be more 
confident that active treatment will benefit patients, 
and drive a more assertive approach to antipsychotic 
treatment in this vulnerable group. With less uncertainty 
about the benefits of amisulpride treatment, and without 
the additional complication of explaining randomised 
trials and placebo control, a greater proportion of future 
patients might agree to treatment than agreed to join the 
ATLAS trial. If patients do agree to treatment, even those 
with the least insight would be expected to benefit, 
because we found, if anything, greater benefits from 
amisulpride in those with more severe symptoms.
