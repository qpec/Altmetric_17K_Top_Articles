Abstract
Background—Research on family meals has demonstrated that family meals are protective for 
many aspects of child and adolescent health. It is unclear whether distractions at family meals, 
such as watching TV, are associated with child weight and weight-related behaviors, the emotional 
atmosphere at the meal, or family meal healthfulness.
Methods—Direct observational and objective data were collected on primarily low-income and 
minority families (n=120) with 6–12 year old children. Data were collected during home visits and 
included 24-hr dietary recalls, anthropometry, and video-recorded family meals. Video-recorded 
family meals were coded to assess the presence of TV, whether the family was paying attention to 
the TV, family group enjoyment and the dietary healthfulness of the foods served at family meals.
Results—The presence of TV was negatively associated with the dietary healthfulness and 
emotional atmosphere of the meal and the child’s overall dietary quality. It was positively 
associated with serving fast food for family meals. Those families who were paying attention to 
the TV had significantly worse meal dietary healthfulness and were more likely to have fast food

 at family meals compared to those who were not paying attention. No significant findings were 
found between the presence of TV at family meals and child overweight status.
Conclusions—Study results show that TV is frequently present at family meals. Even if families 
are not paying attention to the TV, it appears that simply having the TV on as background noise is 
associated with deleterious outcomes. In addition to increasing family meals, families should be 
given guidance on turning off the TV and making the family meal a time to connect with one 
another.

Introduction
Family meals have been shown to be protective for many aspects of child and adolescent 
health, including better dietary intake (Christian et al., 2012; Christian, Evans, Hancock, 
Nykjaer, & Cade, 2013; Fulkerson, Kubik, Story, Lytle, & Arcan, 2009; Hammons & Fiese, 
2011; Larson et al., 2013), lower engagement in risky behaviors such as alcohol use 
(CASAColumbia, 2011; Musick & Meier, 2012; Sen, 2010; White & Halliwell, 2010) or 
unhealthy weight control behaviors (Haines, Gillman, Rifas-Shiman, Field, & Austin, 2010; 
Musick & Meier, 2012; Wang et al., 2013), and fewer depressive symptoms (Fulkerson et 
al., 2009; Musick & Meier, 2012; Skeer & Ballard, 2013). In addition, some research has 
shown a negative relationship between the frequency of family meals and child overweight 
status (Anderson & Whitaker, 2010; Berge et al., 2015; Fulkerson et al., 2009; Kubik et al., 
2009; Larson et al., 2013; Wardle, Sanderson, Guthrie, Rapoport, & Plomin, 2002). 
Research on family meals has also shown that the emotional atmosphere during the family 
meal is important. Specifically, studies have shown that a positive emotional atmosphere 
during family meals is associated with lower risk of child overweight status (Berge et al., 
2014; Berge, Jin, Hannan, & Neumark-Sztainer, 2013; Burnier, Dubois, & Girard, 2011; 
Fulkerson, Strauss, Neumark-Sztainer, Story, & Boutelle, 2007; Health, 2003; Jacobs & 
Fiese, 2006; Moens, Braet, & Soetens, 2007; Neumark-Sztainer, Wall, Story, & Fulkerson, 
2004; Sweetman, McGowan, Croker, & Cooke, 2011). Another study found adolescents who 
reported a more positive family meal atmosphere were less likely to engage in disordered 
eating behaviors (Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2004).
While family meal frequency and emotional atmosphere during the family meal have been 
strongly associated with child and adolescent weight and weight-related behaviors, there are 
other factors that might reduce the protective nature of family meals on child weight and 
weight-related behaviors. For example, some prior studies have shown associations between 
TV viewing during family meals and lower overall diet quality in adolescents (Andaya, 
Arredondo, Alcaraz, Lindsay, & Elder, 2010; Coon, Goldberg, Rogers, & Tucker, 2001; 
Feldman, Eisenberg, Neumark-Sztainer, & Story, 2007; Sweetman et al., 2011) and adults 
(Boutelle et al., 2003), and with serving a lower quality family meal (FitzPatrick, Edmunds, 
& Dennison, 2007). Additionally, a study examining adolescent electronic media use during 
mealtimes found that more frequent media use was associated with lower family 
communication and lower family meal importance (Fulkerson et al., 2014). A study in nine

 European countries examining TV viewing during family meals and weight status found a 
positive association between TV viewing during dinner and child overweight status in three 
of the nine countries (Roos et al., 2014). While these previous studies suggest that TV 
viewing during family meals may reduce the protective nature of family meals, many of 
these studies used self-report measures, were not conducted on diverse participants, did not 
differentiate between having the TV on as background noise versus actively watching TV 
during the meal, and did not measure other important family meal variables such as the 
emotional atmosphere and the healthfulness of the foods offered during family meals. Thus, 
the current study uses direct observational data objectively collected during family meals, 
measures multiple important family meal factors (e.g., emotional atmosphere, fast food for 
family meals, healthfulness of foods served at meals) and measures TV as background noise 
versus actively viewing during the meals. Additionally, this study was conducted within a 
low-income and minority sample who are at increased risk of obesity and lower quality 
dietary intake (Gundersen & Kreider, 2009; Slack & Yoo, 2005; Weinreb et al., 2002). 
Objective measurements of family meal characteristics (e.g., TV viewing) serve to 
strengthen the literature and the understanding of the family meal atmosphere.
The primary aim of this study is to use direct observational data to investigate the 
relationships between TV viewing during family meals and: 1) emotional atmosphere of the 
meal, 2) dietary healthfulness of foods served at family meals, 3) overall child dietary 
quality, 4) consumption of fast food for family meals, and 5) child weight status. A 
secondary aim of this study is to evaluate whether paying attention/watching the TV 
compared to using TV as background noise is more strongly associated with the previously 
described outcomes. The main hypothesis of the current study is that more frequent TV 
exposure and more frequent attention to the TV will be associated with poorer outcomes 
(i.e., lower group enjoyment, quality of foods served, overall dietary intake; higher 
overweight status and consumption of fast food for family meals). Understanding TV’s 
influence on family meal outcomes may help providers and nutrition professionals provide 
more nuanced recommendations to families seeking to increase or improve family meals.
Methods
The Family Meals, LIVE! study (Berge et al., 2014) is a cross-sectional study of families 
with a 6–12 year old child designed to examine the home environment factors influencing 
childhood obesity risk. Participants (n=120) were recruited from primary care clinics in 
Minneapolis/St. Paul between 2012–2013, which resulted in a primarily low-income and 
minority sample; recruitment was stratified so that half of the target children (n=60) were 
overweight (≥85th percentile) and half (n=60) were normal weight (>5th and < 85th BMI 
percentile). Data were collected during two separate home visits with families and included 
anthropometric measurements, child 24-hour dietary recalls, and an on-line parent/primary 
guardian survey. In between home visits, families were provided an iPad and were asked to 
record eight days of family meals, with a minimum of two days being weekend meals. All 
study procedures were approved by the University of Minnesota’s Institutional Review 
Board Human Subjects Committee. Detailed study methods and demographic data have 
been published elsewhere (Berge et al., 2014).

 Measures
Emotional Atmosphere at the Meal—Based on the Iowa Family Interaction Rating 
Scales (IFIRS) coding protocol for direct observational research, one weekday (Wednesday) 
and one weekend day (Saturday) family video meals were selected for each family and 
coded for emotional atmosphere (Melby & Conger, 2001). Averaging these two days 
allowed a picture of the family’s typical weekly family meal experience. Coding was 
completed by six trained research members. Training was accomplished with practice videos 
that were coded until research team members reached 95% reliability with a gold standard; 
after reliability was established, research members double coded every fifth video to 
maintain 95% interrater reliability. The IFIRS Group Enjoyment scale was used to assess the 
overall emotional atmosphere of family meals, which was the “degree of enjoyment, 
pleasure, fun, and satisfaction among all family members at the meal.” This particular scale 
was chosen because it assesses family-level emotional atmosphere, rather than individual or 
dyadic. The scale ranged from 1–9, with a higher score indicating more group enjoyment. A 
comprehensive description of coding family meals for emotional atmosphere (including 
group enjoyment) has been previously published (Berge et al., 2014). For all study measures 
using video-recorded data, the first day of meals was not utilized in order to allow 
participants to acclimate being video-recorded (Gardner, 2000; Haidet, Tate, Divirgilio-
Thomas, Kolanowski, & Happ, 2009).
Meal Dietary Quality—A family meal healthfulness index (Healthfulness of Meal (HOM) 
index) was developed to assess the quality of foods served at the video-recorded family 
meals. The HOM index assesses the following components: Fruit, Vegetables, Dark Green 
Vegetables, Dairy, Protein, Sodium, and Added Sugars. Component scores are summed, and 
the maximum total score is 9, indicating a higher quality meal. A comprehensive description 
of the HOM index development and coding can be found elsewhere (Trofholz et al., 2015).
Child Dietary Quality—Three 24-hour dietary recalls (two weekday and 1 weekend day) 
were collected on the target child. The first and third recalls were collected at home visits; 
the second recall was conducted via the telephone in between home visits. Dietary recalls 
were conducted with parents of younger children (6–8 year olds); recalls with older children 
(9–12 year olds) were conducted with child, although clarification by a parent was 
permitted. Dietary recalls were collected using Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR) 
software version 2012, developed by the Nutrition Coordinating Center at the University of 
Minnesota; a detailed review was conducted by staff dietitians on 100% of recalls (Trofholz 
et al., 2015). Using data from these recalls, a Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI) score was 
calculated. The maximum HEI score is 100, indicating a healthier diet. Detailed descriptions 
of the HEI, including calculating the HEI score, are available online (Guenther et al., 2013; 
“HEI Tools for Researchers,” n.d.).
Fast Food Intake—The parent was asked during the on-line survey, “In the past week, 
how many times was a family meal purchased from a fast food restaurant, eaten either at the 
restaurant or at home?” Responses options were Never; 1–2 times; 3–4 times; 4–5 times; 6–
7 times; More than 7 times. For assessment of food frequency intake as a continuous

 measure, the midpoint of each response option was used (e.g., a participant selecting 1–2 
times was assigned a value of 1.5).
Anthropometry—Using standardized procedures, height and weight data was obtained on 
target children by trained researchers. Height was assessed to the nearest 0.1 cm and weight 
to the nearest 0.1 kg. BMI percentile values were calculated using CDC guidelines (“Growth 
Charts, Center for Disease Control,” n.d.).
TV Viewing at Family Meals—For each family meal video, staff coded whether there 
was a TV on in the room in which dinner was being eaten [yes/no]. If the TV was on, staff 
coded whether the family was watching the TV and commenting on the show [yes/no]. If 
this option was not selected, coders indicated that the family was not paying attention to the 
TV. These items were taken from a previously validated direct observational tool (Jacobs & 
Fiese, 2006). Staff also coded whether the TV was on in an adjoining room in which dinner 
was being eaten. If the TV was on, coders had the option to select “The family is paying 
attention to the TV” [yes/no] or “The family is NOT paying attention to the TV” [yes/no]. 
For analyses, the questions regarding the TV being on in the room or in an adjoining room 
were collapsed (i.e., TV on in room and/or in adjoining room). If the family was not paying 
attention to the TV any day, they were categorized as “Not Paying Attention,” (i.e., TV is on 
as background noise). Families paying attention to the TV on one or both days were 
categorized as “Paying Attention.”
Covariates—Parent sex was determined by self-report. Parent age was calculated using the 
date of the first home visit and the parent’s reported birthdate.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations were examined to evaluate the distribution of 
responses and outcomes for the full sample (n=120) and for the sub-sample of families in 
which the TV was turned on during the family meal (n=80). Outcomes were evaluated as 
continuous variables for 1) emotional atmosphere, 2) meal healthfulness (HOM index), 3) 
child dietary intake (HEI), 4) child BMI percentile, and 5) fast food for family meals 
frequency. Independent variables for presence of TV was indicator categorized neither 
weekday nor weekend, either weekday or weekend, and both weekday and weekend. TV 
presence did not appear to be different on weekdays or weekend days for the sample 
population. The variable paying attention to TV was dichotomized as paying attention or not 
paying attention, conditional on the presence of TV at the family meal. OLS regression was 
used to evaluate how the independent variables of interest related to continuous dependent 
variables; all analyses included controls for primary caregiver sex and age. Statistically 
significant differences between indicator-categorized groups (p<0.05) were expressed as 
superscript letters, and groups that shared the same letter were not found to be statistically 
different. Sampling weights that account for the recruitment design were applied to produce 
measures of association generalizable to the primary care clinics from which participants 
were sampled. Stata version 13.1 SE was used for all data management and analytical 
procedures (StataCorp, College Station, TX 77845).

 Results
Frequency of TV as Background Noise or Paying Attention to TV
One third of families (33.3%) had the TV off (i.e., TV was off in room dinner was eaten and 
in adjoining room) during family meals on both of the video-recorded days. Nearly one 
quarter of families (23.3%) had the TV on at least one day during the two video-recorded 
family meal days; almost half (43.3%) of families had the TV on both days. Of the families 
who had TV on at least one day (80/120 families) during family meals, two-thirds (65%) 
were paying attention to the TV. The remaining families (35%) were not paying attention to 
the TV while eating dinner (i.e., background noise).
Associations between TV at Meals and Meal Variables (Group Enjoyment of Meal and Meal 
Dietary Quality)
The prevalence of having the TV on at family meals was negatively associated with group 
enjoyment of the meal (p=0.02). Families who did not have a TV on either day or who only 
had the TV on one day, had a higher group enjoyment score (higher scores indicated higher 
group enjoyment) than those families with the TV on both days. Paying attention to the TV 
was not found to be related to the emotional atmosphere at the family meal (Table 1).
Having the TV on at family meals was also found to be associated with the dietary quality of 
the family meal (HOM index) (p=0.04). Families without a TV on either day had HOM 
index point estimates of 3.42 (95% CI: 3.08, 3.77), which were statistically higher (p<0.05) 
than the point estimates of families with the TV on both days (point estimate: 2.91; 95% CI: 
2.72, 3.10). Of the families with the TV on at least one day (n=80), families who were not 
paying attention to the TV (i.e., had TV on as background noise) had higher (i.e., healthier) 
HOM index estimates than those who were paying attention to the TV (p=0.02).
Associations between TV at Meals and Dietary Intake (HEI and Fast Food Intake)
Having the TV on at family meals was strongly and negatively related (p=0.01) to the child’s 
HEI score (overall dietary quality score). Children not exposed to TV at family meals any 
day had an HEI point estimate of 48.85 (95% CI: 46.86, 50.84), indicating higher levels of 
healthful dietary intake (p<0.05) compared to families with TV on both days (point estimate: 
44.01; 95% CI: 41.55, 46.47) (score range of 0–100 with 100 indicating highest diet 
quality). There was not statistical evidence that paying attention to the TV was associated 
with more or less healthful for child dietary intake (Table 2).
Additionally, having the TV on was strongly and positively associated with the number of 
times a family reported eating fast food for a family meal (p=0.01). Average weekly fast 
food intake was 1.4 times (SD: 1.2; range 0–5.5). Families who had the TV on and also paid 
attention to the TV reported substantially higher use of fast food for family meals (more than 
twice as frequent on average) as compared to those families who did not pay attention to TV 
(i.e., TV on as background noise) (p<0.01).

 Associations between TV at Meals and Child Weight Status
There was not a significant association found between having the TV on and child BMI 
percentile. Additionally, there was not a significant association found between paying 
attention to the TV or not and child BMI percentile (Table 3.)
Discussion
Results from the current study supported our hypothesis that having the TV on during family 
meals would be associated with lower family meal quality (both dietary healthfulness, 
emotional atmosphere) and child weight-related behaviors (i.e., overall dietary quality). 
Specifically, associations between the TV being on during family meals and the emotional 
atmosphere at family meals (i.e., emotional atmosphere), dietary healthfulness of family 
meals (i.e., HOM index), child overall dietary intake (i.e., HEI), and serving fast food for 
family meals were statistically significant. Overall, results suggest that the presence of TV at 
family meals is associated with worse meal and child outcomes. These results support 
previous literature showing a significant association between the presence of TV at family 
meals and lower dietary quality in children (Andaya et al., 2010; Coon et al., 2001; Feldman 
et al., 2007; Sweetman et al., 2011) and adults (Boutelle et al., 2003) and lower dietary meal 
quality (FitzPatrick et al., 2007; Fulkerson et al., 2014). Unlike a previous cross-sectional 
survey showing a positive relationship between TV viewing during dinner and child 
overweight status in 3 of 9 countries (Roos et al., 2014), a significant association between 
the presence of TV and child weight status was not found.
Explanations for the associations between the presence of TV and worse meal and child 
outcomes may vary. Regarding the emotional atmosphere at the meal, it may be that the 
presence of TV is a proxy for family dysfunction, a negative interpersonal environment, or a 
more chaotic environment. Families who place a high value on having family meals may be 
motivated to serve a higher quality meal (HOM index) and less fast food, while also turning 
off the TV. Regarding dietary quality, it is also possible that the presence of TV at meals 
indicates a higher overall level of TV watching for children, which exposes them to 
advertising of unhealthy foods (Harrison & Marske, 2005; Story & Faulkner, 1990), which 
may have detrimental effects on the child’s HEI (overall dietary quality) score.
For the secondary analysis, significant results were found between paying attention to the 
TV during family meals (for those families where the TV was on) and having lower dietary 
quality meals (i.e., lower HOM index score and more frequent fast food for family meals). 
One potential explanation may be that the dietary quality of family meals is lower when the 
family’s plan is to watch TV during a family meal (e.g., ordering a pizza to watch with a 
movie.) There were no significant differences in group enjoyment, children’s overall dietary 
intake, or child weight status between those families who were paying attention to the TV 
versus those not paying attention to the TV. It may be surprising that there was not a 
significant association between paying attention to the TV and emotional atmosphere at the 
meal. Some potential explanations may be that in some families watching TV during family 
meals is a positive event shared by the family (e.g., having lively conversations about the 
content viewed on the TV); in other families, watching TV may prohibit fighting that would 
have occurred without the distraction. It is also possible that in some families the presence/

 viewing of the TV is a result of having a negative emotional atmosphere prior to the meal. 
For those families not paying attention to the TV, it is likely that TV operates as background 
noise; something constantly on but only intermittently paid attention to.
We did not find that TV was related to BMI percentile. Previous research has found a variety 
of influences on child weight, including parent weight status, screen time, sedentary 
behavior and family income (Dowda, Ainsworth, Addy, Saunders, & Riner, 2001). It is 
likely that these factors have a greater influence on child weight status than the presence of 
TV at family meals. Also, family meals are sedentary events regardless of the TV. However, 
for those families who had both the TV on and paid attention to the TV, the child had a non-
significant but substantially higher BMI percentile (8 percentile difference). It may be that 
paying attention to TV is a crude proxy for child sedentary behavior. It is also possible that 
our sample size was simply too small to detect a significant association, or that these 
findings are reflective of the characteristics of the study sample and may not be 
generalizable to other populations.
This study has many strengths. It uses direct observational/objective measurements in the 
form of coded video-recorded family meals to classify the presence of TV, attention paid to 
the TV, the emotional atmosphere at the meal, and the overall family dinner meal dietary 
quality. The use of three 24-hr dietary recalls (used to calculate HEI score) and 
anthropometric data also improve our confidence that exposures are classified accurately. 
Additionally, the specific research questions examined in the current study are strengths of 
the study and will advance the field of family meals research. For example, examining the 
association between the presence of TV and fast food at family meals has not previously 
been explored in the literature. There are also limitations of the study that should be 
considered when evaluating results. As previously mentioned, the cross-sectional nature of 
the study does not allow temporality to be determined. For example, does the family enjoy 
family meals less because of the presence of TV, or was the TV turned on because the family 
was already not enjoying each other’s company? Also, while it is a strength to examine a 
primarily low-income, minority population who are at increased risk for poor nutrition and 
obesity (Gundersen & Kreider, 2009; Slack & Yoo, 2005; Weinreb et al., 2002), it is not 
clear these results would generalize to a population of different race and/or income levels. It 
may be that the patterns of TV viewing during family meals differ significantly among 
different populations. Furthermore, the study measured only TV viewing. Other “screens” 
such as, tablets or smartphones should be studied in future research.
This study has implications for practitioners working with families to improve family meals. 
While it is clear the frequency of family meals is important for child health (Anderson & 
Whitaker, 2010; CASA Columbia, 2011; Christian et al., 2012, 2013; Fulkerson et al., 2009; 
Haines et al., 2010; Hammons & Fiese, 2011; Kubik et al., 2009; Larson et al., 2013; 
Musick & Meier, 2012; Sen, 2010; Skeer & Ballard, 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Wardle et al., 
2002; White & Halliwell, 2010), the atmosphere is also important (Berge et al., 2014; Berge 
et al., 2013; Burnier et al., 2011; Fulkerson et al., 2007; Health, 2003; Jacobs & Fiese, 2006; 
Moens et al., 2007; Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2004; Sweetman et al., 2011). An easily-
communicated message based on the current study results is that families should turn off the 
TV when having family meals. Results also suggest a potentially larger message—that

 families should be encouraged to frame the family meal as a family event rather than just a 
necessity for feeding kids. Families who see the family meal as a time to connect with and 
enjoy their families may be more likely to turn off the TV, have a higher quality meal, and 
enjoy the meal more.
Conclusions
Study results show that TV is frequently present at family meals and is associated with 
reduced meal quality and reduced overall child diet quality. Even if families are not paying 
attention to the TV, it appears that simply having the TV on as background noise is 
associated with deleterious outcomes. In addition to increasing family meals, families should 
be given guidance on improving the environment of the family meal. This includes turning 
off the TV and making the family meal a time to connect with one another.

examined, controlling for parent sex and age. There was evidence of a negative association between the number of days that TV was on in the dining room or in an adjoining room and both HEI (p=0.01) 
and fast food (p=0.01). The effect of paying attention to TV in any room increased serving fast food at family meals (p<0.01); however, the association with HEI was not significant (p=0.08).
