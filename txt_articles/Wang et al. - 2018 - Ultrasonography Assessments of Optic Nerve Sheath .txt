IMPORTANCE The crtierion standard method for monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) can
result in complications and pain. Hence, noninvasive, repeatable methods would be valuable.
OBJECTIVE To examine how ultrasonographic optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) correlated
with noninvasive and dynamically monitored ICP changes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The ONSD was measured before the lumbar puncture
(LP) in 60 patients on admission. Patients with elevated ICP were divided into group 1
(200 < LP � 300 mm H2O) and group 2 (LP > 300 mm H2O). Patients underwent follow-up
ONSD and LP measurements within 1 month. We analyzed the correlations between the
ONSD and ICP on admission and between the changes in ONSD and ICP, which were the
respective changes in ONSD and ICP from admission to follow-up.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The ultrasonographic ONSD and ICP were measured on
admission and follow-up. The correlations between the ONSD and ICP on admission and
between the changes in ONSD and ICP were analyzed using Pearson correlation analyses.
RESULTS For 60 patients (Han nationality; mean [SD] age, 36.2 [12.04] years; 29 [48%]
female) on admission, the ONSD and ICP values were strongly correlated, with an r of 0.798
(95% CI, 0.709-0.867; P < .001). Twenty-five patients with elevated ICP who completed the
follow-up were included. The mean (SD) ONSD and ICP on admission were 4.50 (0.54) mm
and 302.40 (54.26) mm H2O, respectively. The ONSD and ICP values obtained on admission
were strongly correlated , with an r of 0.724 (95% CI, 0.470-0.876; P < .001). The mean (SD,
range) changes in ICP and ONSD were 126.64 (52.51 mm H2O, 20-210 mm H2O) (95% CI,
106.24-146.07) and 1.00 (0.512 mm, 0.418-2.37 mm) (95% CI, 0.83–1.20), respectively. The
change in ONSD was strongly correlated with the change in ICP, with an r of 0.702 (95% CI,
0.425–0.870; P < .001). The follow-up evaluations revealed that the elevated ICP and dilated
ONSD had returned to normal, and no evidence of difference was found in the mean ONSDs
between group 1 (3.49 mm; 95% CI, 3.34–3.62 mm) and group 2 (3.51 mm; 95% CI,
3.44–3.59 mm) (P = .778) at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The dilated ONSDs decreased along with the elevated ICP
reduction. Ultrasonographic ONSD measurements may be a useful, noninvasive tool for
dynamically evaluating ICP.

 T
he optic nerve is an outward form of the diencephalon
during embryogenesis. It is wrapped by the nerve
sheath, which is derived from 3 layers of meninges and
protrudestowardtheorbit.Thus,thecerebrospinalfluidmoves
freely between the intracranial and intraorbital subarach-
noid spaces.1 The intraorbital subarachnoid space surrounds
the optic nerve, and it is subject to the same pressure changes
as the intracranial subarachnoid space.2
The “criterion standard” method for monitoring intracra-
nial pressure (ICP) includes using invasive, intraparenchy-
mal, or intraventricular devices that are often only available
in specialist neurocritical care units.3 These monitoring tech-
niques can result in complications, such as bacterial coloni-
zation and hemorrhaging,4-7 and can be painful for the pa-
tient, especially if repeated evaluations are needed; thus, they
arenotideal.Hence,noninvasive,repeatable,andsimplemeth-
ods of assessing ICP are urgently needed.
Recently, measuring the optic nerve sheath diameter
(ONSD) via ultrasonography has become a popular approach
for detecting elevated ICP.8-11 Previously, we confirmed that
this noninvasive technique could be used to qualitatively and
effectively identify elevations in ICP.12 However, whether ul-
trasonographic ONSD measurements can be used to dynami-
cally monitor ICP changes and assess the efficacy of ICP man-
agement strategies remains unclear. Therefore, in this study,
we evaluated the ONSD and its association to ICP in patients
with elevated ICP both before and after treatment to deter-
mine whether ultrasonographic ONSD measurements could
serve as a noninvasive surrogate marker of ICP changes.
Methods
Study Setting
This study was performed in the ultrasonography center in the
Department of Neurology at the First Hospital of Jilin Univer-
sity, a general public hospital in China. The protocol was de-
signed from August 1, 2015, to October 31, 2015, and was ap-
proved by the ethics committee of the First Hospital of Jilin
University on December 5, 2015 (approval number, 2015-
208). The institutional review board of the First Hospital of Ji-
lin University approved the enrollment of patients who were
suspected of having elevated ICP and needed to undergo lum-
bar puncture (LP) to confirm the elevated ICP. The ultrasono-
graphic ONSD was measured in each patient before LP. The
ONSD measurements were compared with the LP findings. All
methods adhered to the relevant guidelines and regulations.
All participants provided written informed consent. They were
informed that the ultrasonographic ONSD measurements ob-
tained would be compared with their LP findings.

Additionally,thefollowingpatientdatawererecorded:age,sex,
and body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared).
Measurements
The ONSD measurements were performed before the LP. The
interval between these 2 examinations was fewer than 10 min-
utes. Ultrasonography examinations of the eye were per-
formed in B-mode using the iU22 ultrasound system (Philips)
and a 9-3 MHz linear array transducer (Philips). The acoustic
output of the ultrasonography system was adjusted accord-
ing to the “as low as reasonably achievable” principle and the
requirements for orbital sonography to avoid damaging the
retina and lens.15 Patients were examined in the supine posi-
tion. The probe was placed lightly on the closed upper eyelid,
which was covered with a thick layer of ultrasonography gel
to prevent pressure from being exerted on the eye. The posi-
tion of the probe was adjusted to clearly display the entry of
the optic nerve into the globe. Two measurements were per-
formed for each optic nerve; the first measurement was in the
transversal plane with the probe in a horizontal position and
the second measurement was in the sagittal plane with the
probe in a vertical position, according to previous protocols.6,7
The ONSD was assessed bilaterally at 3 mm posterior to the
orbit.16,17 Each eye was examined twice, and the mean value
of the 8 total measurements for both eyes was recorded. All
participants were examined by 2 experienced observers who
were blinded to the ultrasonography results. To minimize vari-
ability, the final ONSD measurement value for an individual
was the average of all 16 values.
The opening cerebrospinal fluid pressure was obtained
through an LP, which was performed by an experienced neuro-
logicalresidentblindedtotheultrasonographyresults.Patients
Key Points
Question What is the association between the optic nerve sheath
diameter and intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with elevated
ICP before and after treatment?
Findings The ICP and optic nerve sheath diameter values
obtained before lumbar puncture were strongly correlated. The
subsequent change in optic nerve sheath diameter was strongly
correlated with the change in ICP.
Meaning These findings suggest ultrasonographic optic nerve
sheath diameter may be a useful, noninvasive tool for dynamically
evaluating ICP.

Results
Ultrasonography ONSD and LP measurements were per-
formed in 60 patients (Han nationality; mean [SD] age, 36.20
[12.04] years; range, 20–62 years; 29 [48%] female) on admis-
sion, 37 (62%) of whom had elevated ICP (>200 mm H2O)
(Table 1). The mean (SD) ONSD and ICP of the 60 patients were
4.18 (0.61) mm (range, 3.40–6.0 mm) and 244 (87.49) mm H2O
(range, 100–400 mm H2O), respectively. For the 60 patients
on admission, the ONSD and ICP values were strongly corre-
lated,withanrof0.798(95%CI,0.709-0.867;P < .001).Twelve
patients were excluded from further analysis because of a lack
of follow-up ONSD and/or LP measurements. We found no evi-
dence of differences in sex, age, BMI, ONSD, or ICP between
the patients lacking follow-up and the patients enrolled. Thus,
25 patients with elevated ICP were included in the final analy-
sis (Han nationality; mean age [SD], 35.16 [12.45] years; range,
20–62 years; 12 [48%] female). The mean (SD) BMI of the pa-
tients was 23.61 (3.66) kg/m2 (range, 17.6–33.2 kg/m2). No evi-
dence of difference was found in sex, age, or BMI between
group 1 and group 2 (Table 1). The causes of the elevated ICP
included cerebral infections (n = 18, 72%), cerebrovascular dis-
ease (n = 5, 20%), and hydrocephalus (n = 2, 8%). One pa-
tient had comorbidities (pneumonia). Pearson correlation co-
efficient between the 2 eyes for observer 1 was 0.794 in the
transversal plane and 0.800 in the sagittal plane, and for ob-
server 2, it was 0.790 in the transversal plane and 0.782 in the
sagittal plane. Pearson correlation coefficient between the 2
observers for the left eye was 0.969 in the transversal plane
and 0.977 in the sagittal plane, and for the right eye, it was
0.968 in the transversal plane and 0.976 in the sagittal plane.
ABland-Altmananalysisyieldedamean(SD)differenceofmea-
surements of 0.014 (0.125) mm for the right and −0.009 (0.118)
mm for the left ONSD. Limits of agreement (mean ± 1.96 times
of SD) were 0.259 and −0.231 mm for the right and 0.222 and
−0.240 mm for the left ONSD. The ICP and ONSD values ob-
tained at admission and follow-up are shown in Table 2. The
elevated ICPs and dilated ONSDs had returned to normal in the
follow-up evaluations. We found that the ONSD and ICP val-
ues obtained on admission were strongly correlated, with an
r of 0.724 (95% CI, 0.470-0.876; P < .001). The mean (SD)
changes in ICP and ONSD were 126.64 (52.1) mm H2O (range,
20–210 mm H2O; 95% CI, 109.24-146.07) and 1.00 (0.512) mm
(range, 0.418–2.37 mm; 95% CI, 0.83-1.20), respectively. The
change in ONSD was strongly correlated with the change in ICP
according to Pearson correlation analysis, with an r of 0.702
(95% CI, 0.425-0.870; P < .001) (Figure 1). The greatest dis-
connects in changes in ONSD and ICP were in a patient with a
change in ONSD of 0.58 mm and a change in ICP of 190 mm
Hg. The partial correlation analysis showed that, after control-
ling for the covariates (age, cause of elevated ICP, and comor-
bidities), the ONSD and ICP values obtained on admission were
correlated, with an r of 0.736 (95% CI, 0.486-0.886; P < .001).

Discussion
In this study, we measured the ONSD and ICP in patients with
elevated ICP and found that the ICP and ONSD values ob-
tainedonadmissionwerestronglycorrelatedwithanrof0.724
(95% CI, 0.470- 0.876; P < .001). Additionally, ultrasono-
graphic ONSD measurements were successfully used to dy-
namically assess the changes in ICP that occurred from admis-
sion to follow-up.
Our previous cross-sectional study12 found that ultraso-
nographic ONSD was correlated with ICP on admission and
suggested that this noninvasive method could be poten-
tially useful for identifying patients with elevated ICP. The
results of this study were consistent with those of the previ-
ous one with different samples. Furthermore, this study
focused on the follow-up of ONSD and ICP. Therefore, this
study both confirmed the ONSD as a predictor of elevated
ICP on admission and found that the change in ONSD was
strongly correlated with the change in ICP according to
Pearson correlation analysis, with an r of 0.702 (95% CI,
0.425-0.870; P < .001). Thus, it was suggested that ONSD
could dynamically detect the changes in ICP in this study.
While many clinical studies have reported this dilation re-
sponse, it was unclear whether the ONSD would decrease af-
tertheICPdecreasedinvivo.Hansenetal19demonstratedsuch
ONSD changes in vitro through the controlled application of
incremental and decreased pressure steps in the SAS. Specifi-
cally, they isolated human optic nerve preparations that were
obtained from autopsies and found that following submis-
sion to pressure, the ONSD increased. Similarly, reducing the
pressure in the SAS invariably resulted in a decrease in the
ONSD. However, to our knowledge, few clinical studies have
estimated the ONSD variations that occur following treat-
ment for elevated ICP. In one study of 13 patients with acute
brain injury, Launey et al11 found a significant correlation be-
tween the ICP and ONSD measurements obtained before and
after mannitol infusion. Likewise, our clinical study showed
that the dilated ONSD decreased following treatment to re-
duce the elevated ICP. We speculate that the pressure-
dependentbehavioroftheopticnervesheathisassociatedwith
its exceptional elastic properties. Killer et al20 reported that the
SAS of the human optic nerve contains various trabeculae,
septa, and stout pillars that are arranged between the arach-
noid and pia layers of the nerve meninges. Therefore, when
the ICP is elevated, the presumably folded trabeculae likely
stretch, allowing the optic nerve sheath to dilate. Similarly, on
reduction of the ICP, the stretched trabeculae refold and the
dilated optic nerve sheath shrinks. Our findings support that
ONSD examinations can be used to dynamically assess varia-
tions in the ICP because of the elasticity of the optic nerve
sheath (Figure 2).
Other studies have also shown that the optic nerve sheath
is quite elastic. For instance, it was recently reported that the
ONSD significantly increases with hypercapnia and subse-
quently reverts to baseline values once normocapnia is
established.21 Moreover, Maissan et al22 reported that during
tracheal stimulation, both the ICP and ONSD increased simul-
taneously, while after the procedure, the ONSD returned to the
baseline diameter at the same rate as the ICP. It has been sug-
gested that the changes in ONSD may reflect a temporary and
reversible increase in ICP because of acute elevations in the
intraabdominal pressure.23 However, the effective range of the
optic nerve sheath’
s elastic properties remains unclear. In vitro
experiments of the ONSD showed that the diameter only re-
covered to baseline when the SAS pressure was less than 35
mm Hg, while residual dilatation remained on decompres-
sion from higher pressure levels (≥45 mm Hg).19 In the
present study, after treating the elevated ICP, the enlarged
ONSDdecreasedto3.09to3.95mm,whichwaswithinthenor-
mal range for healthy Chinese adults.24 In addition, we found

 no evidence of difference in mean (95% CI) ONSDs between
group 1 and group 2 (3.49 mm [3.34-3.62 mm], 3.51 mm [3.44-
3.59 mm], respectively; P = .778) at follow-up, indicating that
the ONSD was able to return to normal after treatment regard-
less of the initial ICP value on admission (maximum ICP value,
400 mm H2O, approximately 29.4 mm Hg). Such findings im-
ply that when the ONSD is within the range of reversible dila-
tion, its structure may not undergo plastic deformation or tra-
becular damage-like overdistention. Hence, when in this
effective range, the dilated ONSD can completely recover to
normal, as was observed in our study.
Pearson correlation coefficients between the change in
ONSD and change in ICP in 1 eye and those assessed by just 1
observer ranged from 0.630 to 0.692, which is similar to the
overall r value (0.702). The results showed relatively good sen-
sitivity. This study showed that ultrasonographic ONSD is a re-
producible technique with high interobserver reliability. A pre-
vious study also confirmed that this technique was easy to
learn25 and with high intra- and interobserver reliability.26,27
Therefore, it may be extensively applicable in clinical set-
tings. Clinicians, such as intensivists or neurosurgeons, could
easily master this technique and have confidence in the reli-
ability of the measurements.

the technique, the change in ONSD cutoff point for identifying
the change in ICP or a mathematical function to noninvasively

and optical coherence tomography could also be used to evalu-

torsthatlimitedthegeneralizabilityofthatstudy.29Inaddition,

Conclusions
We showed that the dilated ONSDs that were observed in pa-
tients with increased ICP decreased along with the ICP reduc-
tion. Although further studies are required, this study sug-
gests that ultrasonographic ONSD measurements may assist
in monitoring patients with elevated ICP, as fluctuations in the
ONSD approximate the respective ICP variations. This find-
ing may be important because existing invasive ICP monitor-
ing techniques can be painful and result in complications, such
as bacterial colonization and hemorrhaging.

Editor's Note
Correlation Between Noninvasive Ultrasonography
and Dynamically Monitored Intracranial Pressure
Andrew G. Lee, MD
Direct measurements of intracranial pressure (ICP) by lum-
bar puncture (LP) remain the criterion standard for diagnos-
ing, following, and treating specific neurologic, neurosurgi-
cal,andneuro-ophthalmicconditionswithelevatedICP.Inthis
issue of JAMA Ophthalmol-
ogy, Wang et al1 used ultraso-
nography to document optic
nervesheathdiameter(ONSD),andtheirresultsreportedacor-
relation between noninvasive ultrasonography and dynami-
cally monitored ICP.
The ONSD was measured before LP in 60 patients on ad-
mission.PatientswithelevatedICPweredividedinto2groups:
group 1 (200 < LP ≤ 300 mm H2O) and group 2 (LP > 300 mm
H2O). Patients underwent follow-up ONSD and LP measure-
ments within 1 month. For the 60 patients on admission, the
ONSD and ICP values were strongly correlated. In addition, the
follow-up evaluations after treatment revealed that the el-
evated ICP and dilated ONSD had returned to normal.
The use of ultrasonography has been reported previously
asapotentialnoninvasivetestforelevatedICP.Thisstudyadds
further evidence for the sensitivity and specificity of ultraso-
nography for this purpose. I already use orbital ultrasonogra-
phy for supporting a diagnosis of elevated ICP in the follow-
ing common clinical circumstances in neuro-ophthalmology
including (1) differentiating difficult cases of pseudopapill-
edema vs papilledema (especially with borderline elevated ICP
on LP), (2) following patients with proven papilledema and el-
evated ICP with residual posttreatment disc changes (eg, disc
elevation without obligatory signs of increased ICP) for whom
repeated LP might be undesirable or unnecessarily invasive or
painful, (3) evaluating patients with significant postpapill-
edema or another optic atrophy with possible elevated ICP for
whom the papilledema may no longer be able to manifest oph-
thalmoscopically (ie, “a dead nerve can’
t swell”), (4) evaluat-
ing patients with cerebrospinal fluid shunts for elevated ICP
due to possible shunt malfunction, and (5) following patients
who refuse or cannot undergo a standard LP for measuring ICP
(eg, patients who are taking anticoagulation or antiplatelet
agents or have intracranial lesions that have a mass effect on
neuroimaging studies). In this study,1 the 2 groups (less and
more than 300 mm H2O ICP) were able to be differentiated by
ONSD on ultrasonography, but further work will be necessary
to determine if the study results are generalizable to lower or
higher levels of ICP.
