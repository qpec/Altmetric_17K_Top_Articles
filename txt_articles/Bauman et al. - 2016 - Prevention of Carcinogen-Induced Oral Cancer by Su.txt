Abstract
Chronic exposure to carcinogens represents the major risk
factor for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
Beverages derived from broccoli sprout extracts (BSE) that are
rich in glucoraphanin and its bioactive metabolite sulforaphane
promote detoxication of airborne pollutants in humans. Herein,
we investigated the potential chemopreventive activity of sul-
foraphane using in vitro models of normal and malignant
mucosal epithelial cells and an in vivo model of murine oral
cancer resulting from the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide
(4NQO). Sulforaphane treatment of Het-1A, a normal mucosal
epithelial cell line, and 4 HNSCC cell lines led to dose- and
time-dependent induction of NRF2 and the NRF2 target genes
NQO1 and GCLC, known mediators of carcinogen detoxication.
Sulforaphane also promoted NRF2-independent dephosphory-
lation/inactivation of pSTAT3, a key oncogenic factor in
HNSCC. Compared with vehicle, sulforaphane significantly
reduced the incidence and size of 4NQO-induced tongue
tumors in mice. A pilot clinical trial in 10 healthy volunteers
evaluated the bioavailability and pharmacodynamic activity of
three different BSE regimens, based upon urinary sulforaphane
metabolites and NQO1 transcripts in buccal scrapings, respec-
tively. Ingestion of sulforaphane-rich BSE demonstrated the
greatest, most consistent bioavailability. Mucosal bioactivity,
defined as 2-fold or greater upregulation of NQO1 mRNA, was
observed in 6 of 9 evaluable participants ingesting glucorapha-
nin-rich BSE; 3 of 6 ingesting sulforaphane-rich BSE; and 3 of 9
after topical-only exposure to sulforaphane-rich BSE. Together,
our findings demonstrate preclinical chemopreventive activity
of sulforaphane against carcinogen-induced oral cancer, and
support further mechanistic and clinical investigation of sulfo-
raphane as a chemopreventive agent against tobacco-related
HNSCC. Cancer Prev Res; 9(7); 547–57. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract, including head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), are strongly associ-
ated with chronic exposure to tobacco and alcohol. The concept
of "condemned mucosa," or epithelial field cancerization from
environmental carcinogens, was introduced by Danely Slaugh-
ter in 1953 (1). Clinically, epithelial field cancerization man-
ifests as an alarming rate of second primary tumor (SPT)
formation in patients curatively treated for an initial primary
HNSCC: 3%–6% per year (2–5). Although smoking cessation
reduces SPTs in HNSCC, moderation of risk is not observed for
5 years, and is insufficient to return risk to baseline (4, 6).
Chemoprevention of SPTs by high-dose isotretinoin, a synthetic
vitamin A analogue, was demonstrated in a phase III HNSCC
chemoprevention study (7, 8). However, toxicities precluded
chronic administration and risk reverted to baseline upon
discontinuation; a subsequent study demonstrated that low-
dose isotretinoin was tolerable but ineffective against SPTs (9).
Molecular targeting of EGFR or COX-2 has shown preclinical
chemopreventive efficacy against oral cancer (10–14), but clin-
ical application has been hampered by poor efficacy and tol-
erability in humans (15–19). Thus, a tremendous unmet need
remains for an effective and well-tolerated chemopreventive
agent against HNSCC.
Epidemiologic studies indicate that diets rich in vegetables
from the Brassica genus of the family Cruciferae (e.g., broccoli,
cabbage, cauliflower) are associated with reduced risk of
HNSCC and SPTs (20–24). Broccoli extracts potently induce
cytoprotective enzymes that promote detoxication of chem-
ical carcinogens, including benzene, aldehydes, and polycy-
clic aromatic hydrocarbons found in tobacco smoke (25–28).
The majority of inducer activity is driven by the phyto-
chemical sulforaphane, a metabolite of glucoraphanin (28).

 Mechanistically, sulforaphane interacts with cysteine residues
on Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), a negative reg-
ulator of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) tran-
scription factor (29). This interaction liberates NRF2 from protea-
somal destruction and results in upregulation of NRF2 and NRF2
target genes (28, 30). Many known NRF2 target genes encode
enzymes affecting carcinogen detoxication, including NAD(P)H
quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutamate-cysteine ligase
catalytic subunit (GCLC), GSTs, and aldo-keto reductases. As
glucoraphanin is 20 to 50 times more concentrated in broccoli
seeds relative to mature plants (31, 32), various broccoli seed
preparations are under development as chemopreventive agents
against carcinogen-induced cancers.
Proof-of-concept clinical trials in healthy volunteers have
shown that broccoli sprout extracts (BSE) rich in glucoraphanin
and/or sulforaphane are well tolerated and promote rapid,
sustained detoxication of the airborne pollutants acrolein and
benzene (28, 33–36). In preclinical studies, sulforaphane has
exhibited chemopreventive activity against carcinogen-induced
stomach, skin, and breast cancers (37–41). Studies in Nrf2�/�
mice have shown that the chemopreventive effect of sulfo-
raphane against benzo[a]pyrene-induced gastric cancer and
7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced skin cancer
depends on the NRF2 signaling pathway (37, 38, 41). Neither
sulforaphane nor BSEs have been investigated in oral cancer
models. However, the relevance of NRF2 to oral cancer che-
moprevention is highlighted by the enhanced susceptibility
of Nrf2�/� mice to oral cancer induced by the carcinogen
4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO), and the reduced suscepti-
bility of Keap1�/� mice (42).
To investigate the chemopreventive activity of sulforaphane
against HNSCC, we examined sulforaphane's impact on NRF2
signaling in a normal mucosal epithelial cell line and four
HNSCC cell lines. We also determined the effects of sulforaph-
ane on apoptosis regulatory proteins, including STAT3. We
investigated the in vivo chemopreventive activity of sulforaph-
ane against carcinogen-induced oral cancer using the 4NQO
murine model. Finally, we conducted a pilot clinical trial test-
ing three BSE regimens in healthy volunteers, evaluating both
bioavailability and effects on NRF2 signaling in oral epitheli-
um: ingestion of glucoraphanin-rich BSE; ingestion of sulfo-
raphane-rich BSE; and topical exposure to sulforaphane-rich
BSE. Our findings provide the first preclinical demonstration
that sulforaphane protects against carcinogen-induced oral
cancer and support further mechanistic and clinical evaluation
of broccoli-derived extracts and sulforaphane against tobacco-
related HNSCC.
Materials and Methods
Reagents
R,S-sulforaphane was from LKT Laboratories, Inc., and cell
culture reagents from Life Technologies. Annexin V/PI staining
kits were from BD Pharmingen. All reagents for RNA purification
and cDNA synthesis, including TRIzol Reagent, RNAqueous-
Micro Total RNA Isolation kits, Superscript III First-Strand cDNA
Synthesis kits, Platinum Taq DNA polymerase were purchased
from Life Technologies. SYBR Green PCR Master Mix was from
Applied Biosystems. UMSCC cell lines were from Thomas Carey
(University of Michigan; Ann Arbor, MI). Het-1A were obtained
from ATCC. UPCI:SCC090 cells were provided by Susanne Gollin
(University of Pittsburgh; Pittsburgh, PA). Cell lines were authen-
ticated genotypically using AmpFLSTR Profiler Plus Amplification
Kit (Applied Biosystems).
Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting as
described previously (43). Blots were probed with antibodies
against NRF2, Mcl-1, Bik (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phos-
pho-STAT3, total STAT3, Bcl-XL, Bax, Bak (Cell Signaling Tech-
nology), Bcl-2 (Dako), Bim (Stressgen Bioreagents), and b-actin
(Sigma).
RNA purification and quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was purified from cells in culture using TRIzol
Reagent. RNA was purified from human buccal cells using RNA-
queous-Micro Total RNA Isolation kits. cDNA was synthesized
using Superscript III First-Strand cDNA Synthesis System. Quan-
titative real-time PCR (qPCR) was carried out using cDNA as
template and the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. Gene-specific
primers for NQO1 were: 50-GTCATTCTCTGGCCAATTCAGAGT-30
(forward) and 50-TTCCAGGATTTGAATTCGGG-30 (reverse). Pri-
mers for GCLC were: 50-GGCGATGAGGTGGAATACAT-30 (for-
ward) and 50-GTCCTTTCCCCCTTCTCTTG-30 (reverse). Primers for
GAPDH were: 50-GGACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGAA-30 (forward)
and 50-GGTGTCGCTGTTGAAGTGAGAG-30 (reverse).GAPDHtran-
script levels were used as the internal control.
Treatment of mice
Female C57BL/6 mice (5–6 weeks; 18 mice/group) in both
treatment groups were administered 4NQO (100 mg/mL) in
ad libitum drinking water for 16 weeks. Stock 4NQO solutions
were thawed, diluted to 12.5 mg/mL in propylene glycol, then 3.8
mL was added to each 450 mL bottle of sterilized drinking water.
The 4NQO-containing water was changed weekly. In addition to
4NQO treatment, group 1 control mice were given PBS thrice
weekly via oralgavage, andmice in group 2 were given6 mmol/L of
sulforaphane thrice weekly via oral gavage. All treatments were
stopped after 16 weeks and mice were maintained for 8 additional
weeks on normal tap water. After 24 total weeks, mice were
sacrificed, tongue tissues harvested, and tongue tumors counted
and measured.
Treatment of human subjects
The pilot clinical trial was approved by the Institutional review
board of the University of Pittsburgh and registered at clinical-
trials.gov (NCT02023931). All participants provided written,
informed consent. Eligibility criteria, participant characteristics,
beverage preparation, and toxicities are described in Supplemen-
tary Materials and Methods.
Ten participants underwent three 5-day interventions. On days
1, 3, 4, and 5 of each intervention, buccal cells were collected by
scraping the inner cheek with a curette, transferred immediately
into RNAlater (Life Technologies), then frozen at �80�C until
analysis. Overnight urine was self-collected from 5 pm on day 1
through the first morning void on day 2, and repeated on days
4–5. Urine volume was recorded, and two 15-mL aliquots were
frozen at �20�C until analysis. On days 2–4 of each intervention,
participants self-administered the designated BSE beverage once
daily (Regimen 1, 600 mmol/L of glucoraphanin-rich BSE/day;
Regimen 2, 150 mmol/L of sulforaphane-rich BSE/day; Regimen 3,

 150 mmol/L of sulforaphane-rich BSE was swished, gargled, and
expectorated for 6 minutes daily). A minimum 3-day washout was
required between regimens. Cruciferous vegetables were avoided
for 48 hours prior to and during each intervention.
The study was designed as a single-arm crossover trial in
which all participants were exposed to the same sequence and
doses of BSEs. As the goals of this pilot study were limited to
feasibility, bioavailability, and obtaining preliminary pharma-
codynamic estimates of NRF2 pathway modulation in oral
mucosa for each BSE intervention, no formal hypothesis testing
was planned. For purposes of descriptive reporting, mucosal
bioactivity was defined as at least 2-fold upregulation of NQO1
buccal mRNA by qPCR, as compared with regimen baseline. A
participant was considered evaluable for a regimen if mRNA
yield was �18 ng/mL at baseline and at least one subsequent
time point.
Analysis of urine specimens
Measurement of sulforaphane and sulforaphane-N-acetylcys-
teine in urine was performed by isotope dilution mass spectrom-
etry, as reported previously (34, 36).
Statistical analysis
ANOVA and t tests were employed for comparisons between
groups. The assumptions of equal variances and Gaussian resi-
duals were checked visually. Welch adjustment for unequal var-
iances was applied if required. Count endpoints were analyzed
using Poisson ANOVA. A linear mixed-effects ANOVA was used to
analyze qPCR data from the trial. All statistical tests were two
sided, and P < 0.05 was required for significance.
Results
Sulforaphane activates NRF2 signaling in normal mucosal
epithelial cells and HNSCC cell lines
The impact of sulforaphane on cellular expression levels of
NRF2 was examined in a normal mucosal epithelial cell line,
Het-1A, and the HNSCC cell lines UMSCC-22A, UMSCC-1,
Cal33, and UPCI:SCC090. Het-1A cells are derived from nor-
mal squamous esophageal cells following transfection with
SV40 large T antigen (44). Untreated or vehicle-treated (DMSO)
Het-1A cells or HNSCC cells expressed only low levels of

 detected as a doublet in the 95 to 110 kDa range. Treatment
with 10 mmol/L sulforaphane led to marked induction of NRF2
in Het-1A cells as well as both human papillomavirus (HPV)-
negative (UMSCC-22A, UMSCC-1, Cal33) and HPV-positive
(UPCI:SCC090) HNSCC cell lines (Fig. 1A and Supplementary
Fig. S1). As cellular levels of NRF2 are known to be regulated by
the proteasome, we also examined the effects of the proteasome
inhibitors bortezomib, carfilzomib, and oprozomib (Supple-
mentary Fig. S2). As expected, proteasome inhibition led to
NRF2 upregulation.
Dose–response experiments revealed maximal elevation of
NRF2 levels with 5 and 10 mmol/L sulforaphane in Het-1A and
UMSCC-22A, respectively (Fig. 1B and D). At high concentra-
tions of sulforaphane (80 mmol/L in Het-1A and 40 mmol/L in
UMSCC-22A), expression of intact NRF2 was lost, perhaps due
to induction of apoptosis signaling. Time course analyses using
a fixed dose of sulforaphane (10 mmol/L) demonstrated eleva-
tion of NRF2 levels at 15 minutes in Het-1A and 30 minutes
in UMSCC-22A (Fig. 1C and E), with peak elevation occurring
at approximately 4 hours in both models. After 12 hours of
treatment, NRF2 levels declined, returning to near baseline
levels by 48 to 72 hours.
To determine whether the NRF2 protein increased by sulfo-
raphane was functionally active, we performed qPCR to exam-
ine expression levels of the NRF2 target genes NQO1 and GCLC
(Fig. 2). Treatment with sulforaphane (10 mmol/L) for 4 hours
resulted in nearly 2-fold induction of NQO1 mRNA in Het-1A,
UMSCC-22A, and UMSCC-1 cells. GCLC mRNA upregulation
by sulforaphane was approximately 5-fold in Het-1A and
approximately 2.5-fold in both HNSCC cell lines. Similar
results were seen in HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC
cell lines (Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). These results dem-
onstrate that sulforaphane activates functional NRF2 signaling
in normal mucosal epithelial cells and HNSCC cells.
Sulforaphane suppresses STAT3 phosphorylation
independently of NRF2
The impact of sulforaphane on STAT3 activation was assess-
ed using an antibody directed against phospho-Tyr705 STAT3
(pSTAT3), the phosphorylated/activated form. Treatment of
Het-1A or UMSCC-22A with increasing concentrations of sul-
foraphane led to loss of pSTAT3 expression at doses 10 mmol/L
or higher (Fig. 3A and C). In contrast, sulforaphane concentra-
tions up to 40 mmol/L in Het-1A and UMSCC-22A did not
markedly alter the expression levels of total STAT3 protein,
indicating the effects of sulforaphane on pSTAT3 were due to
dephosphorylation. Time course analyses revealed rapid loss
of pSTAT3, within 30 minutes, following treatment of Het-1A
or UMSCC-22A with 10 mmol/L sulforaphane (Fig. 3B and D).
The levels of pSTAT3 remained low for 12 to 24 hours
posttreatment and then returned to baseline. In contrast to
effects on NRF2 and pSTAT3 levels, sulforaphane (10 mmol/L,
24 hours) demonstrated little effect on the expression of anti-
apoptotic or proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein
family (Fig. 3E), including antiapoptotic Bcl-XL, a known pro-
survival in HNSCC (45).
To determine whether dephosphorylation of STAT3 by sul-
foraphane treatment was dependent on NRF2, we utilized
siRNA to suppress NRF2 expression. As expected, Het-1A and
UMSCC-22A cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA exhibited
upregulation of NRF2 and loss of pSTAT3 after treatment with
10 mmol/L sulforaphane (Fig. 4A). Transfection with siRNA
directed against NRF2 mRNA resulted in nearly complete abro-
gation of NRF2 upregulation. Inhibition of NRF2 expression did
not interfere with loss of pSTAT3 in sulforaphane-treated cells.
Thus, inactivation of STAT3 by sulforaphane occurs indepen-
dently of NRF2.
The inactivation of prosurvival pSTAT3 by sulforaphane
suggested that sulforaphane may promote cell death in
Het-1A and HNSCC cell lines. Indeed, while sulforaphane
concentrations of 5–10 mmol/L were effective at inducing
NRF2 and NRF2-dependent detoxication enzymes, higher con-
centrations promoted cell death in Het-1A and five different
HNSCC cell lines (Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplementary Fig. S5).
Het-1A and UMSCC-22A exhibited sulforaphane IC50s of 21.3
and 21.1 mmol/L, respectively, in 48-hour assays (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S5). To determine the role of NRF2 in regulating
sulforaphane-induced cell death, we again used siRNA to
inhibit NRF2 expression. Suppression of NRF2 expression in
UMSCC-22A significantly enhanced apoptosis by sulforaph-
ane (10 mmol/L, 24 hours), as determined by Annexin V
staining (P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 4B). Collectively, these results indi-
cate that NRF2 protects against apoptosis induced by high
concentrations of sulforaphane, and does so without modu-
lating sulforaphane-induced dephosphorylation of pSTAT3.

The number of tongue tumors in mice treated with 4NQO

detected in mice treated with 4NQO plus vehicle (P ¼

nation of hematoxylin/eosin–stained sections of the tongues
confirmed a lower incidence of invasive SCC in mice treated
with 4NQO plus sulforaphane versus 4NQO plus vehicle
(Fig. 5B). Immunohistochemical staining of the invasive SCC
specimens for NRF2 failed to reveal a statistically significant
difference (P ¼ 0.46) between the two treatment groups (not
shown), although this was not surprising as treatment with
4NQO/sulforaphane or 4NQO/vehicle was stopped 8 weeks
prior to harvest of the tongues. The tongue tumors in sulfo-
raphane-treated mice were also found to be significantly smal-
ler than those observed in vehicle-treated mice (P ¼ 0.005;
Fig. 5C). The median tumor volume was 0.90 mm3/mouse in
the sulforaphane group, and 9.55 mm3/mouse in the control
group. Together, these findings demonstrate that sulforaphane
reduced the incidence and size of tongue tumors in 4NQO-
treated mice.

 Evaluation of three BSE regimens in healthy volunteers
To evaluate the bioavailability and pharmacodynamic activ-
ity of oral and topical administration of BSE beverages, a pilot
study was conducted in 10 healthy human volunteers. As
described in Materials and Methods, participants were admin-
istered the same sequence of three BSE regimens: Regimen 1,
ingestion of glucoraphanin-rich BSE; Regimen 2, ingestion of
sulforaphane-rich BSE; and Regimen 3, topical exposure to
sulforaphane-rich BSE. To assess bioavailability, overnight
urine was collected at the beginning and end of each regimen
and analyzed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry for
free sulforaphane and its primary metabolite, the glutathi-
one-derived conjugate sulforaphane-N-acetylcysteine. Total
micromoles of excreted sulforaphane plus its mercapturic
acid metabolites were normalized to urinary volume and cre-
atinine (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Table S1). Bioavailability was
significantly greater for sulforaphane-rich BSE (P ¼ 0.0013)
than with the other regimens. Urinary levels of sulforaphane
and mercapturic acids were more variable when glucorapha-
nin-rich BSE was administered. Topical sulforaphane-rich
BSE demonstrated negligible bioavailability, indicating com-
pliance with noningestion and trivial systemic absorption
through oral mucosa.
To evaluate whether BSEs modulate NRF2 signaling in oral
epithelium, as measured by NQO1 qPCR, buccal cells were
collected at baseline and on days 3–5 of each regimen. Median
total RNA yields were: Regimen 1, 461 ng (range 326–2,000);
Regimen 2, 455 ng (range 234–1,324); Regimen 3, 528 ng
(range 302–1,316). Total mRNA yield was <18 ng/mL at 20 of
120 time points; these time points failed to meet quality control
criteria and were excluded from the primary descriptive analysis.
After prespecified definitions for evaluability and mucosal bio-
activity, at least 2-fold upregulation of NQO1 buccal mRNA was
observed with variable kinetics in 6 of 9 evaluable participants
ingesting glucoraphanin-rich BSE; 3 of 6 ingesting sulforaph-
ane-rich BSE; and 3 of 9 after topical exposure to sulforaphane-
rich BSE. Three participants (#2, #7, and #8) provided sufficient
buccal cell RNA at all regimen time points for quantitative
analysis. qPCR of RNA from these participants demonstrated
greater than 2-fold upregulation of NQO1 transcript in partici-
pants #2 and #8 during Regimen 1, and greater than 2-fold
upregulation in participants #7 and #8 during Regimen 2
(Fig. 6B). Upregulation of NQO1 was not detected in any of
the three participants during Regimen 3. Fold change in DCt,
compared with day 1, is shown by regimen for all evaluable
participants (Fig. 6C). Although underpowered, a mixed-effects
ANOVA was conducted to explore the effect of regimen and day
on NQO1 qPCR. All DCt values derived from time points
meeting quality criteria (mRNA > 18 ng) were included. NQO1
mRNA changed significantly by regimen (P ¼ 0.0014) and day
(P ¼ 0.029); however, no significant interaction between day
and regimen was detected (P ¼ 0.66). As compared with
baseline, NQO1 mRNA was significantly upregulated on day
5 in Regimen 1 (P < 0.0001; Westfall correction for multiple
testing). To address the low RNA yield from buccal cell collec-
tion by curette, a feasibility barrier for future studies, we
subsequently collected buccal cells by cytobrush from 10 volun-
teers; this technique achieved substantially higher yields (medi-
an 1,490 ng of RNA; range 285–4,668 ng).
Discussion
Despite preclinical successes, including the prevention of
murine oral cancers by retinoids or COX inhibitors in the DMBA
model and by an EGFR inhibitor in the 4NQO model, no
tolerable and effective agent to prevent HNSCC has been success-
fully translated to the clinic. The developmental failure of isolated
micronutrient and molecular targeting interventions has invigo-
rated interest in "green chemoprevention," cost-conscious and
tolerable interventions based upon whole plants or their simple
extracts (46). In this study, we utilize preclinical in vitro and in vivo

 models as well as a pilot clinical trial to investigate the potential
chemopreventive activity of sulforaphane, a phytochemical found
in cruciferous vegetables, against oral environmental carcinogen-
esis. We observe induction of functional NRF2 signaling by
sulforaphane in both a normal mucosal and several HNSCC cell
lines. Notably, we provide first-time demonstration that concur-
rent oral administration of sulforaphane significantly protects
against carcinogen-induced oral cancer in mice. We further dem-
onstrate that the systemic administration of BSEs, rich in sulfo-
raphane or its precursor glucoraphanin, is well tolerated and
shows preliminary evidence of NRF2 pathway activation in the
oral mucosa of healthy human volunteers.
The impact of sulforaphane on normal epithelial cells and
HNSCC cells is likely to be complex and dependent on dose.
Sulforaphane induction of NRF2 occurred at concentrations as
low at 0.1–0.5 mmol/L, whereas induction of apoptosis typi-
cally required concentrations 10 mmol/L or higher. The eleva-
tion of NRF2 protein and consequent induction of NRF2 target
genes at low concentrations of sulforaphane promotes detox-
ication of environmental carcinogens and cellular protection
from oxidative damage (30). These effects may prevent trans-
formation of normal or condemned mucosal epithelial cells in
at-risk patients, particularly where exposure to carcinogens
continues to be high (e.g., smokers). However, NRF2-mediated
detoxication may lessen the potency of chemotherapy or radi-
ation, as reported previously (47), suggesting that sulforaph-
ane-based chemoprevention against SPTs would ideally start
after completion of curative-intent treatment for HNSCC. At
higher concentrations of sulforaphane (�10 mmol/L) Het-1A
and HNSCC cells underwent apoptosis, consistent with reports
of sulforaphane-induced apoptosis in other cancer models
(48, 49). Interestingly, NRF2 acted to inhibit sulforaphane-
induced apoptosis, as suppression of NRF2 expression led to
elevated levels of cell death in UMSCC-22A cells. Higher con-
centrations of sulforaphane also led to rapid dephosphoryla-
tion of STAT3 via an NRF2-independent pathway. Similar
dephosphorylation of STAT3 has also been reported in prostate
cancer cells (50). As phosphorylated/activated STAT3 plays
a key role in driving the proliferation and survival of HNSCC,
it will be important to determine whether inactivation of
STAT3 represents a primary mechanism of the proapoptotic
activity of sulforaphane in this disease.
The chemopreventive potential of sulforaphane against car-
cinogen-induced oral cancer had not previously been investi-
gated. Our findings demonstrate that cotreatment with sulfo-
raphane markedly reduced both the incidence and size of
tongue tumors in mice exposed to 4NQO. Our pilot study in
mice did not answer whether sulforaphane prevents tumor
initiation, promotion, or both. Determining where and how
sulforaphane acts in the continuum of oral carcinogenesis
may be important to the design of chemoprevention studies.

Sulforaphane (SF) reduces the incidence and size of tongue tumors in 4NQO-treated mice. A, wild-type C57BL/6 mice (n ¼ 17/group) were treated for
16 weeks with 4NQO (100 mmol/L in drinking water) plus vehicle (thrice weekly via oral gavage), or with 4NQO plus SF (6 mmol/L thrice weekly via
oral gavage). After the 16 weeks, treatments were discontinued and mice given regular tap water for an additional 8 weeks. The number of tongue tumors
in each mouse was counted, with significantly fewer in sulforaphane-treated mice (P ¼ 0.012 by Poisson ANOVA). B, tongues from mice exhibiting
tumors were fixed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin/eosin. The stained sections were evaluated by a pathologist blinded
to the treatment groups. The number of mice exhibiting normal tongue tissue only, squamous hyperplasia, dysplasia, or invasive SCC were scored. C, the
total tumor volume per mouse (open circles) was significantly lower in sulforaphane-treated mice (P ¼ 0.005 by Welch two-sample t test). Bold bars,

BSEs are bioavailable and bioactive in the oral mucosa of healthy volunteers. A, overnight urine was collected at baseline, and following the final BSE dose in
each regimen. Regimen 1, 600 mmol/L of glucoraphanin-rich BSE/day; Regimen 2, 150 mmol/L of sulforaphane-rich BSE/day; Regimen 3, 150 mmol/L of
sulforaphane-rich BSE was swished, gargled, and expectorated for 6 minutes daily. Sulforaphane and sulforaphane-N-acetylcysteine were quantified
by isotope dilution mass spectrometry, and normalized to urine creatinine. Sulforaphane-rich BSE was significantly more bioavailable than either
glucoraphanin-rich BSE or topical sulforaphane-rich BSE (P ¼ 0.0013 by mixed-effects ANOVA). Bars, 90% confidence intervals. B, buccal cells were
collected at baseline, and days 3–5 of each BSE regimen. mRNA transcripts for NQO1 were measured by qPCR. Three participants had adequate mRNA at
every regimen time point and are displayed. The protocol definition of mucosal bioactivity, �2-fold upregulation of NQO1 transcripts, is shown for
glucoraphanin-rich BSE in participants #2 and #8, for sulforaphane-rich BSE in participants #7 and #8, and for topical sulforaphane-rich BSE in none.
C, a mixed-effects ANOVA was conducted to explore the effect of regimen and day on NQO1 qPCR. Fold change in DCt is presented by participant

 environmental carcinogenesis (51). NRF2 is a critical mamma-
lian pathway for maintaining homeostatic reduction potential
in the face of chronic oxidative stress. Paradoxically, activating
Nrf2 or inactivating Keap1 mutations were found in 14% and
5% of HPV-negative HNSCC tumors sequenced by The Cancer
Genome Atlas (52), respectively, raising the possibility that
constitutive NRF2 pathway activation promotes HNSCC devel-
opment. However, in vivo, sulforaphane did not potentiate
4NQO-induced tongue tumors. Rather, both incidence and
size of established tumors were markedly reduced, the latter
suggesting that NRF2 activation did not provide a proliferation
or survival advantage to established neoplasias. Future experi-
ments testing sequential 4NQO followed by sulforaphane will
determine whether sulforaphane can prevent postinitiation
tumor formation, potentially analogous to preventing SPTs in
smokers. Experiments with Nrf2�/� mice will clarify whether
the preventive effects of sulforaphane are due to NRF2-medi-
ated detoxication, prevention of tumor initiation and/or pro-
gression, or induction of apoptosis by sulforaphane in devel-
oping tumors. In either case, our in vivo results support the
evaluation of sulforaphane, or more realistically, sulforaphane-
rich plant extracts, as a chemopreventive agent in patients
exposed to high levels of environmental carcinogens.
Toward the development of a "green chemoprevention"
regimen for patients at risk for HNSCC, we performed a pilot
study in healthy human volunteers to evaluate the bioavail-
ability and pharmacodynamic activity of three BSE regimens.
The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of various broc-
coli seed preparations have been well characterized in healthy
volunteers, and standard preparations with defined concentra-
tions of sulforaphane or glucoraphanin have been developed
(28, 33–36, 53). Notably, consumption of a BSE beverage
containing 70 mmol/L sulforaphane equivalent by residents of
a polluted region of China promoted significant and sustained
detoxication of the air pollutants acrolein and benzene, carci-
nogens also found in tobacco smoke (36). Moreover, bioac-
tivity was observed throughout a 12-week exposure and healthy
volunteers demonstrated excellent compliance, raising the
promise of sustainable chronic administration. In our pilot
study, both tolerability and bioavailability of BSE beverages
were consistent with observations from prior trials. Compli-
ance was excellent for ingestion of glucoraphanin-rich or sul-
foraphane-rich BSE. Bioavailability was superior for ingested
sulforaphane versus glucoraphanin, consistent with prior stud-
ies and thought to reflect individual variability of the gut
microbiome and hence, intestinal conversion of glucoraphanin
to sulforaphane (28, 34). Importantly, ingestion of either
beverage demonstrated preliminary evidence of NRF2 pathway
activation in oral mucosa. Because the majority of tobacco-
related HNSCC occurs in the oral cavity and oropharynx, oral
rinses are an attractive and plausible method to concentrate
drug delivery to at-risk tissue. However, we observed low
bioavailability of the topical sulforaphane-rich beverage in
Regimen 3. Although the median topical exposure time was
6 minutes, as recommended, 6 participants also described
grade 1 gum, buccal, or pharyngeal irritation, attributed to the
acidic juice medium. Therefore, we do not recommend devel-
opment of this preparation as an oral rinse. Future studies are
planned with encapsulated broccoli seed powder to enhance
ease of dispensing and acceptability.
In summary, our studies illustrate the chemopreventive poten-
tial of sulforaphane-rich broccoli seed preparations against oral
environmental carcinogenesis, and justify prospective clinical
investigation in patients at risk for tobacco-related HNSCC and
SPTs. Further pharmacodynamic and dose–response studies are
planned in patients who have completed curative treatment for a
first tobacco-related HNSCC. Ultimately, interventions based
upon whole plants or their simple extracts, as compared with
pharmaceutical agents, may ease the production, distribution,
and sustainability of chemoprevention against HNSCC, particu-
larly in resource-poor settings. The identification of a cost-effec-
tive, green chemopreventive agent would have a major global
impact on mortality and quality of life in patients at risk, as the
burden of HNSCC disproportionately affects the developing
world.
