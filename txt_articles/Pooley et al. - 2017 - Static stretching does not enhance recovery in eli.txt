Static stretching does not enhance
recovery in elite youth soccer players
Sam Pooley,1 Owen Spendiff,2 Matt Allen,1 Hannah J Moir2
ABSTRACT
Background Static stretching (SS) is a recovery
intervention used for the reduction of muscle soreness
postexercise. The effects of SS on elite young
footballers have received little attention, and therefore
the aim of this study was to assess the effects of SS
on muscle recovery following competitive soccer
matches in elite young footballers.
Methods Ten male participants (16�1 years) were
recruited from an English Premier League professional
soccer academy. Using a controlled crossover design,
participants followed one of two recovery interventions
(SS or passive recovery (PR)) immediately following
completion of competitive soccer matches. Muscle
oedema, creatine kinase (CK), countermovement jump
with arms (CMJA) performance and perceived muscle
soreness were assessed before, immediately after and
48 hours postmatch.
Results Competitive soccer matches significantly
induced muscle damage, with time intervals of
perceived soreness and CK showing significant
increases (p<0.05), and CMJA showing significant
decreases between prematch, postmatch and 48 hours
postmatch for both SS and PR (p<0.05). Comparisons
of the absolute effects of SS with PR only revealed
significant decreases for CK 48 hours postmatch
(p<0.05) as a result of SS intervention.
Conclusion The current study demonstrated
competitive soccer matches induced muscle damage,
which may have detrimental effects on future
performance within 24–48 hours postmatch.
Furthermore, there was limited evidence to suggest SS
would assist in the reduction of muscle soreness
postexercise. Therefore, it can be argued that SS is not
a beneficial recovery option for elite youth soccer
players.
INTRODUCTION
Static stretching (SS) is an intervention
historically
recommended
as
a
recovery
method following exercise to prevent or
reduce muscle soreness,1 2 often referred to
as delayed-onset muscle soreness. When
performing SS, muscles are elongated, often
to the point of slight discomfort where they
are held for a prescribed period of time.3 It
has been suggested that SS may assist in the
dispersion of postexercise muscle oedema,4
reducing the potential damaging effects of
reactive
oxygen
species,
neutrophils,
lymphocytes and proinflammatory cytokines
which, although act as a protective mecha-
nism, may inadvertently cause further cell
damage.5
In addition to the recommendations for
using SS with non-elite participants,1 SS is
known to be used by elite athletes, with
research highlighting the application on
national-level
basketball4
and
soccer3
players. Furthermore, Dadebo et al6 reported
English Premier League football clubs dedi-
cate almost 40% of training time to flexibility
training, with the most common technique
being SS, although this study did not specify
the context in which SS was implemented
(warm-up or cool-down).
Applied studies investigating the effects of
SS have explored numerous sports such as
basketball,4 7 8 Australian rules football9 and
soccer.3 10 11 Research assessing the effects
of SS in basketball has revealed varied and
inconclusive findings. Montgomery et al7
compared the effects of SS on physical
performance markers of basketball players
with pretournament baseline values, with SS
having no significant effect on performance.
These findings are supported by a review
study by Calleja-Gonz�
alez et al,8 advising
against the use of SS as a recovery interven-
tion for improving flexibility and reducing
adhesions postcompetition. Limitations to
the study produced by Montgomery et al7 can
be
highlighted,
as
data
were
collected
What are the findings?
" Completion of a minimum of 80% of 80 min
competitive soccer matches of elite youth soccer
players significantly induced muscle damage.
" As a result of muscle damage sustained from
competitive soccer matches, elite youth soccer
players are in the process of recovery for at least
48 hours postmatch.
" Static stretching provides little or no recovery
benefit for elite young soccer players following
competitive soccer matches when compared with
passive recovery.

 following
competitive
basketball
matches on
three
consecutive days, suggesting an element of cumulative
muscle damage may exist, questioning the transfer-
ability of these findings to elite youth soccer as this may
not truly represent an expected competitive schedule.
In contrast to research demonstrating SS has no effect
on recovery, Delextrat et al4 report a significant reduc-
tion in perceived muscle soreness (PMS) (females) and a
significant improvement in countermovement jump
with arms (CMJA) performance (males) as a result of an
SS intervention on state-level basketball players. Again
limitations to this study exist as the recovery interven-
tion
incorporated
massage
therapy,
and
therefore
findings cannot be directly compared with studies
focusing solely on SS. Additionally, caution must be
taken when assessing the transferability of findings from
various sports to soccer, as physical demands between
sports are likely to differ, resulting in varying degrees of
muscle damage sustained.
In order to truly assess the effects of SS on recovery
of soccer players postcompetition, it is important to
use soccer players as participants in research studies.
Dawson et al10 reported a significant improvement in
peak power 15 hours postexercise when assessing semi-
professional
male
soccer
players;
however,
no
differences in subjective assessments or range of move-
ment were found. These findings may appear more
applicable
to
elite
youth
soccer;
however,
athlete
training status and participant age (24�3 years) may
not truly represent the elite young population. It may
be suggested that muscle damage elicited from a
competitive semiprofessional soccer match may differ
substantially from that experienced at elite standard,
therefore affecting the impact of SS as a recovery
technique.
In contrast to the findings of Dawson et al,10 Kinu-
gasa and Kilding11 reported SS had no significant
effect on non-elite youth soccer players following three
soccer matches compared with a control. Despite the
use of youth participants (14�1 years), athletes were
considered non-elite, again questioning the applica-
bility
of
findings
to
the
elite
youth
population.
Additional
limitations
to
this
study
may
also
be
highlighted; first the primary assessment method was
subjective, and therefore caution must be taken when
considering the effectiveness of SS for recovery based
on these results; and second, participants completed
three competitive soccer matches within 1 week, and
an average of all prematch, postmatch and postre-
covery assessments for all matches were calculated and
used for statistical analysis. The grouping of all data
for statistical analysis may impact the ecological validity
of this study as results represent cumulative muscle
damage rather than the effects of SS on single trials.
The use of SS as a recovery intervention has been
extensively studied, and despite inconclusive findings
would appear to be used as a recovery intervention
following exercise.3 4 6 To date, limited research has
been conducted on the effects of SS as a recovery inter-
vention following competitive soccer matches for elite
young soccer players, and with a dearth of research in
this area it may be hypothesised that current practices
in elite youth soccer are supported by inapplicable
evidence. The variance in sports studied and partici-
pant training status and age throughout literature does
not allow for current research to be applied to the elite
youth population; therefore, the aim of this study was
to compare the effects of SS with a control of passive
recovery (PR) following competitive soccer matches
using elite young soccer players.
METHODS
Participants
Ten elite young soccer players (mean (�SD): age 16 (1)
years, stature 173.5 (6.1) cm, mass 63.3 (6.5) kg) were
voluntarily
recruited
from
a
professional
football
academy in the English Premier League to participate
in this study. Prior to commencing this study, partici-
pants were informed of any risks that may occur, and
player and parental consent was obtained. Participants
were ensured that any results from testing would be
kept confidential and that the findings would not affect
their
role
within
the
team.
All
procedures
were
conducted
in
accordance
with
the
Declaration
of
Helsinki, and the study was ethically approved by the
Faculty of Science, Engineering and Computing Ethics
Committee (Kingston University London, UK).
Experimental design
Participants were required to complete a minimum of
three 80 min competitive soccer matches for each
recovery intervention (SS or PR). In order to assess the
extent
of
muscle
damage
elicited
from
matches,
markers of muscle damage (creatine kinase (CK)),
CMJA, muscle oedema and PMS were measured before
(pre), immediately after (post) and 48 hours after
(48 hours post) each competitive soccer match.
Experimental protocol
Physical assessments
On arrival to the match facility, participant stature and
mass were recorded, immediately followed by the
recording
of
PMS
at
2.5 hours
prior
to
exercise
commencing. PMS was indicated using a 10-point visual
analogue scale from 0.5 to 5.
Immediately
following
subjective
soreness
assess-
ment, muscle oedema was taken using a constant-
tension tape measure to assess muscle circumference,12
13 using three sites of the lower body; the two sites on
the lower leg of the gastrocnemius were identified by
one-third (OedemaG1) and two thirds (OedemaG2) of
the lower leg length calculated by the distance from
medial condyle of the tibia to the calcaneus tarsal. The
site on the upper leg of the quadriceps (OedemaQ) was
identified by the midpoint of the distance from the

 patella to the iliac crest. Following these initial assess-
ments, CK levels were assessed using the i-STAT 1
Analyser (Abbott Point of Care, Abbott Park, Illinois,
USA) using fingertip whole-blood samples according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Two hours prior to
exercise, CMJA was recorded using the Smart Speed
Jump Mat (Fusion Sport).
Recovery intervention
Prior to any participation in matches, a physical and
technical preparation warm-up was conducted by a
sport scientist and a UEFA-qualified coach, respec-
tively. Warm-ups remained consistent throughout the
duration of the study, comprising 15 min physical
preparation involving muscle activation, movement
preparation and dynamic stretching and mobility, and
15 min of positional and technical football work. For
consistency, the warm-ups were conducted by the same
sport scientist and coach prior to all competitive
games.
Immediately following completion of the competitive
games, participants were required to complete either
the PR protocol which consisted of 10 min passive
seating, or the SS protocol consisting of two 15 s
stretches to the gastrocnemius, hamstrings, quadriceps,
glutes,
hip
flexors,
adductors
and
abductors.
On
completion of the recovery protocols, participants were
required to repeat the assessment of muscle damage
markers in the same order as was taken prematch.
Postmatch assessments were undertaken within 30 min
of completing the match. The same assessments of
muscle damage were recorded at 48 hours postexercise.
On every occasion, the assessments were carried out in
the same order and by the same sport scientist. The
time intervals of assessments (prematch, postmatch
and 48 hours postmatch) were consistent with those
used throughout literature.14–16
Player exclusions
For the purpose of control, and for the monitoring of
physical
outcomes
of
competitive
soccer
matches,
global positioning systems (GPS) were worn by all the
participants when competing in the games. The GPS
units (STATSports Viper) report movement variables
across all axes, as well as heart rate data. Individual
thresholds based on these movement parameters are

 set according to the average of the combined variables
for all full competitive matches completed. As a result,
match percentages were calculated, with the average of
dynamic stress load, metres per minute, speed inten-
sity,
high
metabolic
power
distance,
high
speed
running distance, accelerations, decelerations, heart
rate minutes above 85% of max and heart rate exertion
over all full games amounting to a match percentage of
100%. This match percentage determined the indi-
vidual intensity of training and matches completed for
all players. To ensure the intensity of each competitive
football match remained consistent throughout the
study, participants whose match percentage for any
particular game was �10% of their average match
percentage for all completed matches were excluded
from the data collection for that specific competitive
match. Furthermore, participants were excluded from
data collection for individual games if they failed to
complete a minimum of 80% of the 80 min match,
while goalkeepers were excluded from the study due to
the inability to control consistency in physical loading
for matches.
Statistical analysis
Means
and
SD
of
all
anthropometric
data
were
recorded, and all data were analysed for normal distri-
bution, with analysis of muscle damage markers only
commencing following assessment of normality. The
assessment markers recorded were compared across
the two conditions (SS and PR) and three time intervals
(pre-exercise, postexercise, and 48 hours postexercise)
using a within-subjects repeated-measures analysis of
variance
in
statistical
software
SPSS
V.23.
Paired
samples t-tests were used as posthoc analysis. In case of
data with violations in normality, Friedman’s non-
parametric statistical test was conducted with a Bonfer-
roni posthoc adjustment. Statistical significance was
accepted at p<0.05.
RESULTS
Analysis of data within conditions across time intervals
(prematch, postmatch, 48 hours postmatch) produced
significant differences (p<0.05) between all time inter-
vals for SS and PR interventions when assessing CK,
CMJA and perceived soreness as markers of muscle
damage (table 1). Additionally, significant differences
were found between pre-exercise and 48 hours postexer-
cise for PR of OedemaG1 (p=0.024, effect size (ES):
0.450,
95%
CI
�0.054
to
1.334)
and
OedemaQ
(p=0.023),
while
OedemaQ
SS
showed
significant
differences at prematch and immediately postmatch
(p=0.028).
Further analysis of results for each assessment method
of muscle damage showed no significant difference
(p>0.05) between recovery interventions of SS and PR
for OedemaG1, OedemaQ, perceived soreness and
CMJA (table 1). However, analysis of CK indicated a
significant difference between SS and PR interventions
48 hours postmatch (p=0.032, ES: 0.427, 95% CI 0.024
to 0.362), whereas analysis of OedemaG2 showed signif-
icant differences between SS and PR immediately
postmatch (p=0.029, ES: 0.596, 95% CI �1.047 to
�0.073) and 48 hours (p=0.006, ES: 0.642, 95% CI
�1.109 to �0.251) following completion of competitive
soccer matches.
Due to the inter-individual variability of CK, further
analysis was conducted to assess the percentage change
in CK from precompetition levels at postexercise and
48 hours postexercise between conditions (figure 1).
The results show no significant differences (p>0.05)
between
PR
and
SS
interventions
for
percentage
change; however, a significant difference (p<0.05)
across all time intervals was recognised for PR and SS.
Additionally, the variability between individual meas-
urements of muscle oedema was large, and therefore
further analysis was conducted to assess the percentage
change in muscle oedema at three lower leg sites from
baseline to postexercise and 48 hours postexercise
(figure 2). The results show a significant difference
(p=0.009, ES: 0.601, 95% CI 0.334 to 1.401) between SS
and
PR
at
48 hours
postmatch
when
measuring
OedemaG2.
Furthermore,
significant
differences
(p=0.027, ES: 0.440, 95% CI �0.285 to –5.225) were
identified across time for OedemaG1 between pre-exer-
cise and 48 hours postexercise when assessing SS, while
OedemaQ
demonstrated
significant
differences
between prematch and postmatch (SS: p=0.004, ES:
0.716, 95% CI 0.644 to 2.870; PR: p=0.006, ES: 0.714,
95% CI 0.400 to 2.065), and prematch and 48 hours
postmatch (SS: p=0.046, ES: 0.726, 95% CI 0.353 to
2.670; PR: p=0.008, ES: 0.647, 95% CI 0.471 to 2.196)
for both SS and PR conditions.
DISCUSSION
The main findings from the present study showed that
competitive
soccer
matches
of
elite
young
soccer
players
significantly
induced
muscle
damage

 demonstrated by the significant increase (p<0.05) in
muscle damage markers immediately postmatch when
compared with baseline values (table 1). Furthermore,
this study demonstrated muscle damage was evident
for at least 48 hours postmatch as indicated by the
significant
difference
in
muscle
damage
markers
recorded at this time point (p<0.05) in comparison
with baseline values (table 1). These findings differ
from those of Dawson et al,10 whose results showed a
significant increase in PMS only, at 15 hours postmatch
and 48 hours postmatch in comparison with baseline
values, with no significant differences in performance
measures, therefore suggesting soccer matches of semi-
professional soccer players do not elicit significant
muscle damage. Additionally, Kinugasa and Kilding11
reported no significant differences in muscle damage
markers across time intervals when assessing perceived
soreness and performance measures following competi-
tive matches of non-elite youth soccer players. The
findings of the current study may therefore suggest
that the intensity of competitive soccer matches at elite
standard is higher than non-elite and semiprofessional
matches, and as a result elicit significant occurrences of
muscle damage. These findings present new informa-
tion on the effects of competitive soccer matches for
elite young soccer players.
Further examination of the data from the present
study
demonstrated
a
significant
reduction
in
perceived
soreness,
CK
and
CMJA
assessments
between immediately postmatch and 48 hours post-
match, suggesting that although competitive soccer
matches elicit muscle damage postmatch, at 48 hours
the recovery process had begun and values were
returning to baseline for both PR and SS. That being
said, the report of a significant difference between pre-
exercise and 48 hours postexercise for perceived sore-
ness, CK and CMJA may suggest that the body is going
through a process of repair and regeneration,17 and a
return to optimal performance levels is yet to be
achieved, presenting new information on the recovery
process of elite young athletes in the days following
competitive soccer matches, and may prove useful to
coaches
preparing
training
sessions
at
48 hours
postmatch.
Comparisons between SS and PR show no significant
differences for OedemaG1, OedemaQ, perceived sore-
ness and CMJA (p>0.05). These results are consistent
with previous research suggesting SS as a recovery
technique has no effect on recovery time when consid-
ering muscle oedema,18 perceived soreness10 11 18 and
CMJA7 10; therefore, it may be argued that in contrast
to findings by Delextrat et al,4 SS is an ineffective
method for reducing muscle oedema for elite young
soccer players. Additionally, due to the elite training
status of these individuals, the body may be accustomed
to managing the repair of damaged muscle fibres and
the removal of myoprotein,19 and as a result SS has
little effect on the repair process.
However, in contrast to Gill et al,20 CK was signifi-
cantly elevated (p=0.032) 48 hours postmatch as a
result of no recovery intervention when compared with
SS. Although this may suggest SS significantly reduces
CK following exercise (p<0.05), it may be possible that
the individual variability of CK levels at baseline may
have an influence on statistical interrogation of results
postmatch; therefore, the CK values were aligned for
relative
change
to
baseline
and
expressed
as
a
percentage. Statistical analysis in this form showed no
significant differences between SS and PR (figure 1),
similar to findings of previous studies.3 11
Analysis of OedemaG2 also showed significant differ-
ences between SS and PR interventions immediately
postmatch and 48 hours postmatch. Again this contrasts
the findings in current literature3 10 11; however, when
assessing these results, considerations of compulsory
attire of soccer players must be taken into account. The
assessment of OedemaG2 was taken at the upper third
of the gastrocnemius, an area potentially compressed by
the wearing of supportive tape. This may provide a
compression aid, which could not be avoided due to the
applied nature of this study. As participant use of
supportive tape was not recorded, it cannot be assumed
that it was used across both recovery interventions, and
as such the effects of strappings cannot be directly deter-
mined.
Again
in
order
to
reduce
inter-individual
variability in muscle oedema measures, manipulation of
data to percentage change allowed for further statistical
analysis. Results from this analysis (figure 2) showed a
significant difference between SS and PR of OedemaG2
at 48 hours postmatch (p<0.05). Again the potential
influence of the supportive tape may have a contribution
to the results, leading to the significant difference.20
In conclusion the results of this study indicate that
competitive
soccer
matches
of
elite
young
soccer
players
significantly
induce
muscle
damage,
and
muscle damage markers remain elevated at 48 hours
postmatch. Furthermore, the use of SS showed no
significant reduction in muscle damage markers when

postcompetition.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
In light of these findings, it may be advised that the
use of SS following competitive soccer matches for elite
young athletes provides no definitive recovery effect,
and that alternative postmatch recovery interventions
may be advised. In the applied settings of elite
academy football, situations such as away fixtures
provide little opportunity for alternative recovery inter-
ventions to be implemented postmatch, and as such in
these situations it may be recommended that training
sessions in the days following (at least 48 hours postex-
ercise) have a reduced load.
