Spatial navigation and memory depend on the neural coding of an organism’s location.
Fine-grained coding of location is thought to depend on the hippocampus. Likewise, animals
benefit from knowledge parsing their environment into larger spatial segments, which are
relevant for task performance. Here we investigate how such knowledge may be coded, and
whether this occurs in structures in the temporal lobe, supplying cortical inputs to the
hippocampus. We found that neurons in the perirhinal cortex of rats generate sustained firing
patterns that discriminate large segments of the task environment. This contrasted to
transient firing in hippocampus and sensory neocortex. These spatially extended patterns
were not explained by task variables or temporally discrete sensory stimuli. Previously it has
been suggested that the perirhinal cortex is part of a pathway processing object, but not
spatial information. Our results indicate a greater complexity of neural coding than captured
by this dichotomy.

 O
ver the past decades, research on neural mechanisms
underlying spatial navigation and memory has largely
focused on the neural coding of an animal’s local
position, heading direction and velocity of movement1–5. While
these parameters are needed to mediate detailed navigation, it is
equally useful for animals to encode macrogeometrical knowledge
to navigate in large-scale environments to reach a distant goal.
The ability to orient and navigate successfully in large-scale
environments is also referred to as ‘topographical orientation’6
and the lack of this capacity is one of the hallmarks of
Alzheimer’s
disease6–8.
Topographical
orientation
can
be
illustrated by a car driver who navigates through a city to get
from district A to a house in a remote quarter B. Given this task,
she first needs to apply large-scale knowledge of, for example,
T-junctions and neighbourhoods to map an overall route for
navigation. Only when getting close to B does she require more
detailed knowledge, for example, of which houses she will pass in
succession. Navigation through environments may be facilitated
by ventral hippocampal and entorhinal cell populations, showing
larger scales of spatial coding than their dorsal counterparts1,9.
However, both dorsal and ventral hippocampal cells have place
fields scattered across the environment, and it remains unknown
whether and how chunks of environments or spatial trajectories,
as demarcated by decision points, are coded.
The hippocampus is a key structure for coding an animal’s
detailed location in space2–5,10 and time11,12, and for linking
significant
behavioural
events
to
this
spatiotemporal
framework13–16. Two major open questions are how afferent
structures in the medial temporal lobe supply the hippocampus
with information to build these complex representations, and
whether
they
harbour
neurons
coding
other
large-scale
knowledge of an animal’s task environment than found in
ventral hippocampal–entorhinal circuits. A dominant hypothesis
states that there exist two segregated routes that supply what and
where information to the hippocampus, centred on the perirhinal
(PRH)–lateral entorhinal cortices and the postrhinal–medial
entorhinal
cortices,
respectively15,17–20.
This
hypothesis
is
supported,
amongst
others,
by
evidence
for
spatial
representations encoded by grid cells in medial entorhinal
cortex1,5 and for PRH–lateral entorhinal cortex functions in
object discrimination and recognition18,19,21–24.
An alternative view of PRH holds that it plays a more general
role than merely coding representations of discrete, single objects.
According to this more general account, PRH mediates discrimina-
tion and learning of complex configurations in the environment,
which may include multiple items and environmental context25–28.
Such a unitizing function of the PRH, serving to integrate two or
more previously separate items into a single representation29, is
supported by lesion studies23,30,31, but it remains unclear whether,
and how, PRH encodes neural representations of environmental
context. This also raises the question of whether PRH function
extends from single objects to larger units of information processed
within a task context, representing chunks of the environment.
Spatially restricted firing of PRH cells has been observed before, but
was not stable across different task conditions32. Here we tested the
unitizing hypothesis by recording PRH cells in a sensory
discrimination task set on a figure-8 maze, and demonstrate that
PRH cells do perform integrative operations, globally specifying
where, in the task context, an animal is located. Simultaneously
recorded dorsal hippocampal CA1 and sensory neocortical cells do
not exhibit this integrative property.
Results
Rats navigated a figure-8 maze while performing a visual
discrimination
task
(Fig.
1a,b).
This
task
combined
the
presentation of discrete items with spatial choice behaviour. On
each trial, a visual target stimulus (CS þ ) and distracter (CS � )
were shown on two screens flanking the initial segments of each
side arm. To obtain rewards, rats had to pass a decision
(bifurcation) point, choosing the arm that was flanked by the
CS þ , whereas following the CS � did not produce reward. After
visiting a reward site, rats returned to the middle lane, where they
could initiate a new trial by breaking a photobeam after a sound
cue was given at the end of an intertrial interval (ITI). Additional
tactile cues were provided by way of sandpaper-covered initial
segments of the side arms. While rats were travelling across these
segments, they were allowed to change their initial decision until
passing a ‘point of no return’ (PNR) situated at the end of the
sandpaper-covered segments. This passage was recorded by a
photobeam break, and similarly we recorded the moment when
rats passed the point of returning to the middle lane (point of
return to middle, PRM). Overall, this task presents a rich
combination of spatial and sensory variables as well as elements
critical to behavioural decision-making, thereby offering to gain
insight in PRH coding of a multitude of behaviourally relevant
parameters. Using a 144-channel quad-drive (Supplementary
Fig. 1; N ¼ 3 rats), we made ensemble recordings from four brain
areas simultaneously. Here we will primarily focus on firing
patterns in PRH (518 cells) and compare these to recordings
from hippocampal area CA1 (660 cells), somatosensory cortex
(S1 barrel field, S1BF; 458 cells) and visual cortex (V1M; 43 cells,
presented in Supplementary Fig. 4).
Sustained PRH firing patterns. In PRH we identified several cell
types according to the item presented and task phase in which
their firing activity exhibited significant changes with respect to
baseline (Supplementary Fig. 2). Cells frequently responded to
task elements such as the auditory and visual cues, and
these
firing
responses
were
roughly
similar
to
neural
correlates described earlier for rodent and monkey PRH cells in
an object-cued choice task33 and temporal-order memory task34,
respectively. In addition, however, we identified a large fraction of
PRH cells showing a sustained change in firing rate in the left or
right arm after the animal made an initial choice. Below we will
first present analyses of PRH firing behaviour in the time domain,
because our behavioural set-up allowed us to accurately correlate
firing-rate changes to the passage of the PNR and PRM in time.
Moreover, the repetitive nature of the task permitted insight in
the consistency of firing correlates over trials. Subsequently,
analyses in the spatial domain will be presented.
Whereas firing patterns in area CA1 and S1BF exhibited brief,
transient peaks in firing rate along the arms, PRH neurons often
showed a prolonged firing-rate change, usually stretching from
the spatial decision point, just before reaching the PNR, to the
PRM. These differences were already visible by comparing single
trials into the left or right arm (Fig. 1c,d). A significant left–right
discrimination was made by 72.2% of the total number of PRH
neurons (Methods and Supplementary Table 1); PRH neurons
recorded on the same tetrode were not correlated in their
left–right selectivity. These discriminatory patterns were marked
by an increment in firing rate on one side but not the other
(Figs 1e and 2a), by a decrement on one side (Fig. 1e), or
bidirectional left–right modulations (Fig. 2b and Supplementary
Table 2; firing-rate changes are denoted as increments and
decrements relative to the baseline, computed during the ITI,
spent in the middle lane). A minority of units showed a sustained
increase or decrease in both arms, thus distinguishing the middle
lane from both side loops (Supplementary Fig. 2e,f). In contrast to
PRH, CA1 (Figs 1f and 2c) and S1BF neurons (Fig. 2d) exhibited
transient changes in firing activity. For area CA1, showing

 left–right discrimination in 61.2% of the total number of cells,
selectivity could be ascribed to place fields located on the left or
right arm. In S1BF, a similar pattern of ‘punctate’ responses was
found in 39.7% of the total number of left–right selective
cells (which however should not be considered place cells).
Below we will primarily focus on the sustained nature of PRH
responses.
The firing-rate contrast between the two side arms was
expressed in a normalized firing-rate score quantifying the
difference between a cell’s preferred minus non-preferred arm,

(c,d) During single, correct left and right trials, a subset of PRH cells (black; 1–5) showed sustained firing-rate increments or decrements during locomotion
selectively in one of the side arms. For instance, PRH cell 3 shows a high tonic firing rate except for a sustained decrement selectively in the left arm. Coloured
circles represent successive positions (orange: left trial with lightest colours in middle lane representing period before onset of visual cue; dark orange
represents return to middle lane; purple: idem but for right trial). In contrast, hippocampal (green; 1–4) and S1BF cells (blue; 1–4) showed transient or no
changes when travelling across the left or right arm. For instance, although S1BF cells 3 and 4 were tonically active, they showed a sustained decrement neither
in the left nor right arm. (e) Two PRH cells (PRH unit 4 and 5; same cells as in c) showed left–right selectivity in firing rate (colour-coded) along the maze

 normalized rate difference, NRD (averaged across cells; Fig. 2e;
the arm correlated to the highest mean firing rate of a cell was
labelled the ‘preferred’ arm of that cell). This analysis showed
that the mean level of discrimination in CA1 and S1BF was
much weaker than in PRH. Discriminatory firing by PRH
neurons strongly increased around the passage of the PNR and
steeply decreased when passing the PRM. In addition to this
steep decrease, a residual significant rate difference remained
present when the rat had returned to the middle lane, an effect
that was not observed in area CA1 or S1BF (Fig. 2e). The strong
left–right contrast of PRH cells was further confirmed by
considering an unbiased, shuffle-corrected statistical measure
of left–right discrimination, the discrimination score. All three
recorded regions harboured a considerable fraction of cells
reaching a significant discrimination score (PRH: 35.8%; CA1:
23.0%; and S1BF: 10.2% of the total number of cells per area),
but the PRH cell population stood out by the discrimination
score being elevated for a longer duration in between the PNR
and PRM than in the other three areas (Supplementary Fig. 3).
A population overview of all recorded cells showed the
widespread occurrence of sustained left–right differences in
PRH relative to CA1 and S1BF (Fig. 2f); the same pattern was
observed for individual rats (Supplementary Table 1). This
overview clarifies that the modest, but sustained mean between-
arm differences in CA1 and S1BF (Fig. 2e) arise from the
consecutive line-up of individual, transient responses occurring
on
one of the two arms (Fig.
2f).
Thus, interregional
comparisons indicate that all three recorded areas contain cells
demarcating the engagement in left versus right choice trials,
whereas only PRH neurons show sustained discriminatory
firing throughout this engagement.
Sustained firing patterns in the spatial domain. The temporally
sustained nature of discriminatory PRH firing prompted us to
investigate more systematically how it transfers to the spatial
domain. When firing rates were plotted as a function of the rat’s
spatial position on the maze, the sustained firing-rate changes in
PRH were indeed observed across the left and right arms, most
prominently between the two branch points on the maze (that is,
the decision point and return branch point, which the animals
reached just before passing the PRM photobeam; Figs 1e and 3).
Observing that the left–right difference scores plotted as a func-
tion of linearized position showed widespread discrimination
across the PRH population (Fig. 3c,d), we next asked whether
this discrimination in the spatial domain is attributable to a
systematic contrast between firing-rate increments in one arm
versus decrements in the other arm. In addition to extended
firing-rate
increments
expressed
on
the
cell’s
preferred
arm (Fig. 3e), a sustained decrement in the non-preferred arm
clearly contributed to the discrimination (Fig. 3f; see also Figs 2b
and 3b). In contrast, such decrements were not observed in CA1
(Fig. 3g–i) or neurons in sensory cortices (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Moreover, the consistency of left–right differences across spatial
bins was higher in PRH than other structures (Fig. 3j,k
and Supplementary Fig. 4). The joint expression of sustained
increments and decrements by the same cells suggests that PRH

(colour-coded; different units than Fig. 1). (c,d) NRD in PRH as a function of linearized maze position. Colour code below (d) corresponds to maze positions in c.
Only units (N¼ 349) with a discrimination score 40.5 were included in this graph. The mean NRD is plotted on top of the colour-coded survey (baseline: dashed
line; significance with respect to baseline: horizontal line). Vertical coloured lines correspond to the spatial decision point (cyan), PNR (blue), reward site (purple)
and return to middle (pink; see also c). (e,f) The NRD (d) can be decomposed into sustained PRH firing increments in the preferred arm (Pref) (e), and prolonged
decrements in the non-preferred (NonPref) arm (f). NR is normalized firing rate. Mean NR is plotted on top of the colour-coded surveys. (g–i) Same for
hippocampal CA1 neurons (N¼ 373), showing transient peak responses in one arm, as expected for place fields. For data on sensory neocortex, see Supplementary
Fig. 4. The mean NRD in g shows spatially extended enhancement due to the fact that CA1 cells with place fields in the preferred arm contribute punctate
responses, which add up in the mean NRD. No such enhancement is seen in the CA1 non-preferred arm plot (i) because, by definition, this arm is devoid of strong
place fields. (j) Three examples of PRH (top, black) and hippocampal (bottom, green) neurons contrasting sustained versus transient NRDs as a function of
linearized maze position. (k) Frequency histogram of the consistency of left–right discriminatory firing across spatial bins for PRH (black) and CA1 (green). High
consistency indicates that the firing-rate differences between the preferred and non-preferred sides are uniformly maintained across the spatial bins of the arms.
The consistency of PRH was higher than the consistency of CA1 (Mann–Whitney U-test, Z¼ 17.76, P¼ 0). (l) Left–right firing-rate differences were correlated

 component, as defined relative to baseline, both of which con-
tribute to strong discrimination.
We next asked whether the sustained discriminatory firing of
PRH neurons can be ascribed to the global positioning of the
animal (that is, in the left or right arm), to task variables that are
associated with the animal’s choice behaviour, or with require-
ments to complete a correct trial. For instance, animals may
maintain stimulus information when passing the PNR, until they
reach the reward site and return to the middle lane. We first
tested whether the sustained PRH response may cohere with
completing a correct, rewarded trial. Reward delivery requires not
only a correct initial choice but also the prolongation of the
locomotor response beyond the PNR, which may be coupled with
a higher reward expectation than during an incorrect trial.
This test failed to produce a significant correlation with sustained
PRH responses (Fig. 4a). When we contrasted correct versus
incorrect
trials
for
the
preferred
arm
alone,
we
found
no
discriminatory
firing.
The
same
applied
for
the
non-preferred arm. However, when contrasting the preferred
versus
non-preferred
arm
for
correct
trials
only,
strong
discriminatory firing was found, and the same held for incorrect
trials. Similarly, the presentation of the CS þ stimulus on the left
versus right of the middle lane did not correlate with the
generation of sustained PRH responses, as was also the case for
the CS � stimulus (Fig. 4b). Likewise, the identity of somato-
sensory cues along the initial segments of the arms did not
explain the selectivity of PRH firing patterns (Fig. 4c). Whereas in
the main paradigm described so far the CS þ and CS � images
were displayed until the rat passed the PNR, we interleaved
memory trials having the image offset occur 2 s before the front
barrier was removed in advance of the animal’s initial choice.
Although the memory load in these trials was higher than in
normal trials, they did not reveal a change in left–right
discrimination (Fig. 4d).
In addition to global positioning in the task environment,
sustained PRH responses may arise from left versus right trials
being accompanied by different spatial views of the environment
(scene perception) or by different directions of rotational
movement (coupled to sustained vestibular input). Furthermore,
a left run can be argued to represent a different phase of the
behavioural task than a right run, and not merely a different
large-scale positioning. To assess which of these possibilities

Figure 4 | Control analyses to determine whether the sustained pattern of discriminatory firing in PRH can be ascribed to various task variables.
(a) NRDs between correct and incorrect trials, averaged across the total PRH population and plotted as a function of spatial location. Vertical coloured lines
correspond to the spatial decision point (cyan), PNR (blue), reward site (purple) and return to middle (pink). The difference between correct and incorrect
trials is rendered in orange when the comparison was made for the preferred (Pref) arm of each cell, and in purple for the non-preferred (NonPref) arm.
When all correct trials were split between those made into the preferred versus non-preferred arm (black curve), a high left–right selectivity was found
throughout the arm visit. The same held for the incorrect trials (grey curve). (b) Same as a, but now for the identity of the visual cues shown on the screen
that were positioned to the left versus right of the animal when its head was oriented forward in the middle lane. Again, no significant difference is observed
when visual cue configurations are contrasted within the subset of preferred-arm visits (orange) or the subset of non-preferred arm visits (purple). In
contrast, a clear difference between preferred and non-preferred arms is seen both in the subset of trials with configuration 1 (Config 1; black) or that with
configuration 2 (Config 2; grey). (c) Same as a, but now for rough versus smooth sandpaper textures, which covered the side walls from the decision point
to the PNR. (d) Same as a, but now for normal trials versus memory trials. Horizontal lines below the four curves of each graph indicate statistical
significance with respect to all baseline bins (baseline ¼ bins 3–6; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, a ¼ 0.01); the colour code of these lines is the same as for the
firing-rate difference curves (no significant effects were found for comparisons within the same arm type).

 applied to PRH responses, we contrasted trials in which the
animal first passed the PNR, collected a reward and subsequently
moved forward or travelled in the opposite direction on the same
individual arm, up to the PNR but no further. Here runs in the
opposite direction represent a deviation from the regular task
sequence. PRH cells that were left- or right-arm selective during
regular forward navigation expressed a similar selectivity when
the animal travelled in the opposite direction (Fig. 3l; N ¼ 349,
Pearson’s correlation coefficient r ¼ 0.62: P ¼ 1.56 � 10 � 38).
Thus, sustained PRH responses are best explained by a large-
scale, segmental selectivity, not by other task or sensory variables.
Finally, the residual discriminatory firing occurring after animals
returned to the middle lane (Fig. 2e) was also observed in the
spatial domain (Figs 3a,d and 4, and Supplementary Fig. 2i,k).
This retention effect could not be explained by behavioural
trajectory
differences
of
rats
having
passed
the
PRM
(Supplementary Fig. 2j,l), suggesting a form of retrospective
coding.
Considering that spatially extended firing fields of PRH
neurons seem to co-localize with branch points, whereas dorsal
CA1 place fields may be more scattered across the maze (Fig. 3),
we quantitatively tested this contrast by determining the start and
end points of firing fields of cells in both structures (the start
point is defined here as the point of entry into the firing field
according
to
the
animal’s
heading
direction
during
task
performance; Supplementary Fig. 5). First, we observed that the
circular variance of the PRH start and end points was significantly
lower than for CA1, indicating that indeed the spatial scattering
of
PRH
firing
field
boundaries
is
less
than
for
CA1
(Supplementary Fig. 5e and Supplementary Table 3; all relevant
CA1–PRH comparisons were significant using a bootstrap test).
Next, we compared, on one hand, the distances between the start
points of the firing fields and the decision point (cf. Fig. 1a,b) and,
on the other hand, the distances between the end points and
return branch point (Supplementary Fig. 5f,g; see Methods). For
most comparisons between PRH and CA1, the firing fields of
PRH cells were indeed better aligned with these two branch
points than place fields of CA1 cells were. Especially the end
points of firing fields from both the preferred and non-preferred
arms of PRH cells were more closely aligned to the return branch
point than those of CA1 cells (bootstrap test). Furthermore, the
start points of PRH firing fields on the non-preferred arm were
closer to the decision point than those of CA1 cells (bootstrap
test). The only PRH–CA1 comparison failing to reach signifi-
cance was between the start-to-decision point distances of PRH
cells on the preferred arm versus CA1 cells (Supplementary
Fig. 5f,g and Supplementary Table 3). Despite the impression
raised by Fig. 3d (which shows NRD, a contrast measure),
this lack of effect was due to relatively many PRH activation
patterns surpassing threshold in between the decision point
and reward site (Supplementary Fig. 5b; see also Fig. 3e). In
agreement with the strong contribution PRH deactivations make
to side specificity, the PRH fields coded by decrements in firing
rate were more tightly locked to branch points than the
increments.
Interactions between PRH cortex and hippocampus. Within the
sensory-to-hippocampal hierarchy16,24,35,36, selective firing of
PRH cells may arise in a bottom-up fashion where S1BF and
other neocortical areas feed sensory inputs into PRH, which
subsequently enables the hippocampus to sculpt a refined, spatial
coding. We observed, however, that firing selectivity began to
increase around the same point in the task (that is, the spatial
decision point, leading up to the PNR) in PRH, CA1 and sensory
cortices (Figs 2e, 3 and 4, and Supplementary Fig. 3) and similarly
decreased around PRM. This prompted us to examine whether
rhythmic dynamics of processing in either sensory neocortex or
hippocampus may play a coordinating role in the selectivity of
PRH responses. Specifically, we studied the phase-locking of PRH
firing patterns to rhythmicity in local field potentials (LFPs),
which provides a measure of phase synchronization between local
firing activity and synaptic mass activity reflected in the LFP,
indicative of direct or indirect communication. First, we found a
significant phase-locking of PRH cells selectively to the theta
band of hippocampal LFP (Fig. 5a). Second, the discrimination
score of PRH cells was significantly positively correlated with the
strength of phase-locking to hippocampal theta-band activity
(Fig. 5b). We further examined whether this positive correlation
between PRH cell selectivity and hippocampal theta was found
for S1BF or CA1 units, but this was not the case. S1BF showed a
weak
positive
correlation
with
hippocampal
gamma-band
activity, whereas CA1 units showed a weak negative correlation
to hippocampal theta- and gamma-band activity. We also
analysed the relationship between the discrimination score of
PRH cells and LFP activity recorded from S1BF, but note that this
LFP activity may well be contaminated by volume-conducted
hippocampal LFP activity37. In conclusion, the selectivity of PRH
neurons is specifically associated with the type of hippocampal
dynamics that predominates during spatial navigation and
expression of place-cell activity4,5.

 First, our findings support a wider view of PRH than being merely
implied in the processing of single objects. The firing patterns of
PRH neurons, integrating across large maze segments, are
consistent with the previously proposed role for PRH in
discrimination of complex configurations of visual stimuli30,
contextual and spatial discrimination26,38, and spatial scene
learning39. As indicated by our results, PRH coding of such
configurations may assume the form of larger spatial-contextual
aggregates or environmental ‘chunks’, such as one of the side
arms or the middle lane. This PRH coding is distinct from that of
hippocampal place cells, underscoring that hippocampus and
PRH are not part of one mass-action unit30 (cf. ref. 40). In
conjunction with the fine-grained spatial coding provided by
dorsal entorhinal grid cells or hippocampal place cells, PRH
neurons may be especially useful in coding a pointer to the
animal’s
large-scale
position
in
its
task
environment
(as
delineated by spatial decision points), which may subserve
ongoing spatial navigation, path planning, decision-making and
memory formation.
In terms of firing dynamics, it was previously shown that whole-
cell-recorded PRH neurons in vitro generate prolonged spike trains
induced by current pulses or synaptic inputs41 and, in agreement
with these findings, we show how these intrinsic properties are
compatible with a function in the sustained neural coding of
‘chunks’ of maze trajectories. Along with sustained activation of
PRH cells in one arm of the maze, we typically found sustained loss
of firing of the same cells in the other arm. This deactivation may
correlate either with a loss of excitation or with a powerful
feedforward inhibition, which has been shown to control PRH firing
in isolated brains and may serve to gate the bidirectional transfer of
information between hippocampus and neocortex42. These or
related inhibitory mechanisms may effectively enhance coding of
maze chunks by suppressing activity on one side of the maze but
permitting signal transmission on the other. However, the precise
mechanisms underlying discrimination between maze segments
awaits
further
investigation.
Here
the
main
point
worth
emphasizing is that PRH cells are capable not only of making a
binary spatial distinction but also of making graded distinctions
between multiple maze segments (for example, left versus right
versus middle).
It remains to be determined whether the environmental chunks
coded by PRH neurons are truly spatial (in the sense of
representing positional information allocentrically), and indeed
the role of proximal versus distal cues and contextual elements in
shaping this code awaits further investigation. Nonetheless, the
current results show that task-related variables, such as sensory
cue configurations, and correctness of behavioural performance,
do not explain left–right discriminations. Because reward was
administered only in correctly performed trials, discriminatory
firing is unlikely to be explained by differences in its delivery or
expectancy. In addition to the strong discrimination PRH
neurons made between the left and right arm, a more subtle
residual left–right discrimination was observed after rats returned
to the middle lane. The exact cause of this effect is unknown,
but is unlikely related to rewards applied in the middle lane
because it remained visible when the left versus right arm trials
were contrasted given correct or incorrect performance. In
other words, even when no middle-lane reward was provided, a
left–right difference was observed. Our data further suggest that
residual discriminatory firing, occurring when rats had returned
to the middle lane, is an effect of trial history and reflects
retrospective coding (that is, a dependence of PRH firing on
where the rat came from in the foregoing trial). Although it is
notable that this retrospective activity occurred under different
behavioural conditions, it remains to be examined what the main
factors are for determining the strength of this effect.
Furthermore, the strong correlation in left–right selectivity
between forward and opposite-direction runs occurring after the
rat had passed the PNR speaks against a predominant influence of
head and eye orientation, of single objects in the environment
captured within a spatial view, or vestibular cueing. Indeed, the
finding that left–right selectivity was sustained across entire arcs,
encompassing
multiple
spatial
views
on
the
environment,
strongly argues against a purely object-oriented function of
PRH coding, while being compatible with a unitizing function.
That PRH neurons are distinct in this type of chunking is
underscored by the more punctate and transient firing patterns
found in hippocampus and sensory neocortex. Thus, although
more work is needed to flesh out the exact determinants of
PRH representations, the current findings outline a unique role of
PRH in contextual representations.
Previous unit-recording studies in freely moving rats empha-
sized a role of PRH in coding object-related information18,34,43,
raising the question why these did not identify sustained firing
that was selective for large maze chunks. Two key differences with
the present study are that these previous experiments studied rat
navigation in a single spatial compartment, and that they did not
use tasks in which the animal needed to apply knowledge of its
large-scale position to expect and secure reward. The plausibility
of sustained PRH responses being constrained by behaviourally
significant locations (such as the spatial decision point) is
underscored, first, by the strong input this area receives from
prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas44–46, which have been
implicated in coding task rules, choice parameters and attentional
set47–50. Second, the selectivity of PRH neurons was most
prominently expressed between two maze locations separating
distinct task choices and paths: the decision point and return to
middle.
Although PRH firing behaviour could only be compared
directly to three brain areas including dorsal area CA1, it is
relevant to relate it to other regions. Ventral CA1 neurons express
large place fields, which appear as scaled-up versions of fields
found in dorsal CA1, and thus likely differ from PRH neurons in
that they are scattered across the rat’s environment, not showing
a demarcation by spatial decision points or other behaviourally
significant landmarks9,51. This larger spatial scattering was
confirmed for our dorsal CA1 recordings compared to PRH
neurons. Furthermore, the start and end positions of PRH firing
fields were generally better aligned to the branch points on the
maze (the start points of PRH fields on the preferred arm
presented an exception). The left–right selectivity of PRH
neurons is also somewhat reminiscent of rat parietal neurons.
A number of studies suggest that during freely moving behaviour,
rat
posterior
parietal
cortex
predominantly
shows—often
transient—firing patterns correlated to the animal’s progression
through a route, including performance of particular behaviours
(for example, body turns) and movement direction (for example,
refs 52,53), whereas PRH coding is marked by more sustained
firing coupled with a large spatial extent of firing fields (current
study). Nonetheless, also parietal neurons can code information
on the rat’s spatial position and may change firing rate during
prolonged stretches on a maze52–54. Thus, these suggested
differences await further testing in a direct comparison by
simultaneous posterior parietal cortex and PRH recordings
during maze behaviour. Regarding the subtle but significant
retention effect in PRH observed after the rat’s return to the
middle lane, this type of retrospective coding is similar to that
found in CA1 and entorhinal cortex neurons, at least under some
task conditions such as spatial alternation55. However, we did not
observe retrospective coding in area CA1 of rats performing the
visual discrimination task. Also prospective coding of future paths
has been reported in area CA1 of rats performing spatial

 alternation55,56, but this was not found in PRH or CA1 during
our visual discrimination task.
The sustained nature of firing brings up the question whether
PRH neurons may encode working memory operations, as has
been reported for instance in rat medial prefrontal cortex57.
Several results argue against the (classic) idea of working memory
being a main function of the PRH coding we report here. First,
whether or not a trial included a memory component did not
matter for PRH discriminatory firing. Second, a correlate of
working memory would be expected to be in place until the
relevant action and reward acquisition have occurred, but not
afterwards. In contrast, we found that the sustained firing
patterns continued well after the reward sites had been visited,
declining when the rat returned to the middle lane. Third, after
passing
the
PNR,
no
working
memory
was
required
to
successfully complete the rest of the trial, yet the PNR-to-PRM
trajectory was marked by a pronounced sustained firing. Finally,
even when the rat deviated from the regular trial sequence and
walked in the opposite direction on an arm, spatially selective
firing remained intact. However, in a more general sense the PRH
code may serve to keep track of the animal being localized on a
large maze segment during task performance.
A subject of future investigation is how PRH computes its
spatially selective responses, and which afferent sources provide
the information to do so. While PRH sends a direct projection to
the hippocampus44,58 and PRH cells could thus affect place fields
in CA1, our findings highlight the entrainment of PRH cells to
the hippocampal theta rhythm. Given the evidence for sparse and
tightly
controlled
communication
between
PRH
and
the
hippocampal–entorhinal complex42,46, the correlation between
the contextual selectivity of PRH neurons and their phase-locking
to hippocampal theta suggests that hippocampal activity may be
critical for opening up communication channels for transmission
of PRH signals to a range of target structures. In this context, the
hippocampus may exert a top-down influence on PRH via
outputs from CA1 and subiculum44,59. In addition, afferent
inputs from postrhinal cortex could contribute to sustained PRH
patterns, as this area has been implicated in visuospatial
processing and scene perception44,60.
Altogether, the current findings reveal a role of PRH neurons
in coding large chunks of an animal’s task environment,
contrasting with more transient, local response patterns of
hippocampal and sensory cortical neurons. Because individual
task elements, such as auditory cues, are co-represented in PRH
with large spatial segments, even by the same cells, the findings
argue against a rigid separation of what versus where processing
in the medial temporal lobe (cf. ref. 15) and favour an integrative
function of PRH, combining chunking of maze segments with
coding of individual items. From a conceptual viewpoint, both
maze chunks and other items could be argued to be objects,
defined as composites of informational elements bound by
common multisensory and spatiotemporal properties61. Thus, the
current findings do not contradict a role of PRH in coding what
information per se. Hippocampal theta rhythm may provide a
means for temporally coordinating large-scale and more refined
coding by PRH and dorsal CA1 cell populations, respectively. The
coding characteristics of PRH cells reported here are consistent
with lesion studies in primates and humans6,7, pointing to an
important role of the parahippocampal gyrus (including PRH) in
topographical orientation abilities.
Methods
Subjects. Data were collected from three male Lister Hooded rats, 28–46 weeks of
age (cf. ref. 37). During handling and behavioural training, animals were
communally housed in standard cages under a reversed day/night cycle (lights off:
8:00; lights on: 20:00). During behavioural training and the main experiment,
animals were food-restricted to maintain their body weight at 85% of free-fed
animals, taking the ad libitum growth curves of Harlan www.harlan.com/
online_literature/research_models.hl) and the growth curves in ref. 62 as
references. From 2 days before surgery until after a full post-surgery recovery week,
food was available ad libitum. Rats had ad libitum access to water during all phases
of the experiment. After surgery, animals were housed individually in transparent
cages (40 � 40 � 40 cm). All experiments were conducted according to the National
Guidelines on Animal Experiments and were approved by the Animal
Experimentation Committee of the University of Amsterdam. Animals were not
subjected to differential treatment and thus no blinding procedure was applied.
Apparatus and stimuli. The animals were trained on a two-choice visual
discrimination task set on a figure-8 maze (Fig. 1a; 114 cm � 110 cm). The paths of
the maze were 7 cm wide (that is, 7 cm separation between walls) and were flanked
by walls that were 4 cm high. The floor of the maze was elevated 40 cm above
ground level. During the inter-trial interval, the rat was confined to the middle lane
of the figure-8 maze using two movable Plexiglas blocking walls, referred to as the
front and back blocking walls (with the front wall closer to the display screens).
Stimuli used were two equiluminant figures (inverse Wingdings; Microsoft, Red-
mond, WA; either a diamond or plane; Fig. 1a) that had the same proportions of
black and white pixels. The stimuli were simultaneously presented on two monitors
(LCD, Dell, 15 inch). At the sides of the arms of the maze into which the rat
entered after the decision point, strips of rough (P40) or smooth sandpaper (P180)
were glued to the inner walls of the maze (red strips in Fig. 1a). Food pellets were
delivered at three reward sites, one of which was placed in the middle lane (ITI
confinement space) close to the front blocking wall. Rewards were delivered only
after the animal had passed the PNR. The other two reward sites were situated in
the left and right arms, respectively (Fig. 1a). Eight photobeams were attached to
the outer walls of the maze, with two photobeams in the middle lane and three
photobeams per side arm. Two of these photobeams were positioned to record the
rat passing the PNR and PRM. The behavioural programme was controlled using
Matlab. Events that were detected by the behavioural apparatus and the commands
issued by the behavioural programme were directly time-stamped and synchro-
nized with electrophysiological data by feeding them as inputs into the Neuralynx
data acquisition system.
Behavioural procedure. Following an inter-trial interval with a duration
randomly selected between 15 and 25 s, the two-choice visual discrimination task
began at the onset of a 2 kHz sinusoid sound cue that lasted for 0.1 s. At this sound,
the rat could break an infrared photobeam in the middle-lane confinement space
close to the front blocking wall, causing two visual stimuli to appear. For each rat,
one of the stimuli was designated the CS þ stimulus, while another stimulus
was designated the CS � stimulus. In every trial, both the CS þ and CS � were
presented, with the spatial location (screen to the right or left of the middle lane) of
the stimuli varying randomly. The CS þ and CS � stimuli were shown on the left
and right for equal amounts of trials. Using pseudo-random sequences we made
sure that for each series of 10 consecutive trials, 5 had the CS þ presented on the
left and 5 had the CS þ on the right side. Throughout the session no more than
three same-side trials were applied in succession.
The front blocking wall was removed 4 s after stimulus onset. The rat could now
enter one of the two side arms at a location labelled the ‘decision point’ (Fig. 1b). In
a correct trial, the rat chose the side at which the CS þ was presented; choosing the
other side failed to produce a reward. The rat’s final choice was indicated by the
animal breaking the infrared photobeams that were positioned beyond the visual
screens at the end of the sandpaper walls (Fig. 1a,b; PNR). On passing this point,
the stimuli were immediately turned off and the rat could no longer correct its
initial choice by walking back and entering the other arm. At any point in a side
arm beyond the PNR, however, the rat was able to turn around and walk in the
direction opposite to the regular forward path until reencountering the (now
blocked) PNR again. We refer to these trials with late stimulus offset as normal
trials. We also included a set of memory or early-offset trials, which comprised, on
average, 30% of all trials in a session. During these trials, stimuli were displayed for
only 2 s, implying that the rats had no access to the visual stimulus for 2 s before
they were allowed to make a choice. On a correct choice in either type of trial, two
or three pellets (BioServ, dustless precision pellets, 14 mg) were delivered in the
ceramic cup that was located in the same arm. The conjunction of a correct choice
and rough sandpaper resulted in three pellets, while a correct choice and smooth
sandpaper resulted in two pellets. When the rat returned to the middle lane after
making a correct choice (but not after making an incorrect choice), an additional
pellet was placed in the middle lane cup, and the front and back blocking walls
were placed back in position, after which the next inter-trial interval commenced.
The median time between return to the middle lane and the initiation of a new trial
was 5.3 s. During recording sessions, rats performed 60.1±2.1 (mean±s.e.m.;
N ¼ 46 sessions) trials. Performance was significantly better than chance level
(59.2±0.5% correct, mean±s.e.m.; P ¼ 2 � 10 � 8, Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test).
While this performance level may seem modest, it should be emphasized that
several features made the task relatively difficult for rats: (i) the isoluminance of the
stimuli, preventing a choice strategy based on contrast; (ii) the relatively distal
placement of the visual presentation screens, about 45 cm away from the rat, with

9
 an inter-screen distance of 25 cm. Moreover, well-known behaviours such as
trial-to-trial alternation may have affected performance.
Surgical procedure and recording drive. Each rat’s right hemisphere was
implanted with a custom-built microdrive (labelled here as quad-drives; cf.
refs 37,63) containing 36 individually movable tetrodes, including eight recording
tetrodes directed to the PRH cortex (area 35/36; skull coordinates: � 5.0 mm
anteroposterior (AP) and 5.0 mm mediolateral (ML)64), eight to the dorsal
hippocampal CA1 area ( � 3.5 mm AP and 2.4 mm ML), eight to the somatosensory
cortex (S1BF: � 3.1 mm AP and 5.1 mm ML) and eight to the visual cortex (V1M,
� 6.0 mm AP and 3.2 mm ML to bregma, with one additional tetrode per area that
could be used as a reference). The quad-drive weighed 23 g and was about 52 mm in
height. The PRH bundle was placed at an angle of 17� pointing laterally and an
angle of 24� pointing caudally with respect to a perpendicular orientation relative to
the skull, such that tetrodes were aimed at area 35 and 36 (as a reference we used the
border of 35–36 area indicated in ref. 64: � 6.0 mm AP, 6.4 mm ML and � 6.2 mm
ventral to bregma). Before surgery, rats received a subcutaneous injection of
buprenorphin (Buprecare, 0.01–0.05 mg kg � 1), meloxicam (Metacam, 2 mg kg � 1)
and Baytril (5 mg kg � 1). Rats were anaesthetized using 3.0% (induction) and 1.0–
3.0% (maintenance) isoflurane. Animals were mounted in a stereotaxic frame and
body temperature was maintained between 35 and 36 �C using a heating pad. After
the cranium was exposed, six holes were made to accommodate surgical screws.
Four holes (each B1.8 mm in diameter) were drilled for placement of the four
bundles holding the tetrodes. After removing the dura, the bundles were lowered
onto the exposed cortex and the quad-drive was fixed to the skull and to the surgical
screws using dental cement. One of the skull screws located in the caudal part of the
parietal skull bone contralateral to the drive location served as ground. After
having thus anchored the drive, the tetrodes were lowered 0.4–1.0 mm (depending
on the target area) into the cortex. Over the next 7 days, the animal was allowed to
recover, with ad libitum food and water available. The recording and reference
tetrodes were gradually lowered to their target region over the course of the
first 8–10 days after implantation, with their depths recorded daily. Depths were
estimated by the number of turns of the guide screws and by online monitoring of
LFP and spike signals.
Histology. After the final recording session, current (12 mA for 10 s) was passed
through one lead per tetrode to mark the end point of the tetrode with a small
lesion. Twenty-four hours later animals were deeply anaesthetized with Nembutal
(sodium pentobarbital, 60 mg ml � 1, 1.0 ml intraperitoneal; Ceva Sante Animale,
Maassluis, the Netherlands) and transcardially perfused with a 0.9% NaCl solution,
followed by a 4% paraformaldehyde solution (pH 7.4, phosphate-buffered).
Following post-fixation, transversal sections of 40 mm were cut using a vibratome
and stained with Cresyl Violet to reconstruct tetrode tracks and localize their end
points. Recording locations were carefully reconstructed using the end points and
the recorded number of turns.
Data acquisition and spike sorting. Using tetrodes65 (Nichrome wire, California
Fine Wire, diameter: 13 mm, gold-plated to an impedance 500–800 kO at 1 kHz),
we recorded neural activity with a 144-channel Digital Neuralynx Cheetah set-up
(including 16 reference channels; Neuralynx, Bozeman MT). Signals were passed
through a unity-gain pre-amplifier headstage, a 144-channel, automated
commutator (Neuralynx) and bandpass filtered between 600 and 6,000 Hz for spike
recordings. One millisecond epochs of activity from all four leads were digitized at
32 kHz if a signal on any of the leads of a tetrode crossed a pre-set voltage
threshold. LFPs recorded on all tetrodes were continuously sampled at 2,035 Hz
and bandpass-filtered between 1 and 500 Hz. Spike trains were sorted to isolate
single units using a semi-automated clustering algorithm followed by manual
refinement (KlustaKwik, by K. Harris, and MClust 3.5, by A.D. Redish).
Automated and manual clustering of spikes was performed using the waveform
peak amplitude, energy and first derivative of the energy. Clusters were accepted as
single units when having no more than 0.1% of inter-spike intervals shorter than
2 ms. This criterion was equally applied across all four recorded regions. During
recordings, rat behaviour was video-tracked at 25 Hz, and an array of light-emitting
diodes on the headstage allowed offline tracking of the rat’s position. Estimates of
sample size (cell counts) were based on the prior literature, for example, on
hippocampal place cells.
Statistical testing of neural correlates. For statistical testing of individual
response curves in the peri-event time histograms (for example, Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Fig. 2), firing rates of left- and right-sided trials were tested against
a baseline taken from the ITI preceding trial onset (Wilcoxon signed-rank test).
Although this interval is commonly used in the electrophysiological literature to
compute a baseline, it should be emphasized that in view of the type of spatial
selectivity of PRH cells, this choice of baseline is essentially arbitrary (cf. Fig. 2b).
To compensate for multiple comparisons, each bin of interest was tested against
eight, contiguous baseline bins in a late time segment of the inter-trial interval, at
� 3 to � 1 s relative to the auditory sound at trial onset (bin width: 250 ms). To
qualify as significant, the P values of a test bin needed to exceed the significance
threshold (a ¼ 0.05) against each baseline bin. Thus, the a ¼ 0.05 criterion had to
be met eight times in succession (cf. refs 63,66).
To assess the statistical significance of differences between two conditions
(for example, left versus right) we also made comparisons per bin, using
Mann–Whitney U-test. P values were false discovery rate-corrected for multiple
comparisons (a ¼ 0.05). Both correct (rewarded) and incorrect (non-rewarded)
behavioural trials were included in the analyses described here and below, unless
noted otherwise. Trials in which the rat would turn around before reaching the
PNR and choose the other arm were rare (on average o1 per session) and were
also included.
Spatial linearization of the maze. The figure-8 maze was segmented into a total
of 51 spatial bins, made up of 21 spatial bins for each side arm and 9 bins for the
middle lane. The decision point corresponded to bin 9 and the return branch point
to bin 1. In the spatial domain we used the return branch point as reference
because of its topological significance, whereas the PRM photobeam (located at
bin 3) was only used to document the animal’s behaviour in the time domain
(Figs 1 and 2). Bins were B9 cm in length. The rat’s position, read out from a given
video frame, was assigned to a spatial bin using the minimal Euclidean distance
between the rat’s position to the bin centre positions. Video frames from trials in
which the animal took more than 15 s to respond following stimulus onset (that is,
until breaking a PNR beam) were excluded.
Statistical measure of spatial discrimination. To derive an unbiased metric of
the degree to which firing rates of recorded neurons discriminate between visits to
the left and right arms of the maze, we computed a discrimination score as follows.
We first computed the actual absolute difference in firing rate between left and
right trials for a given time point, called Da. The range of time points included in
this computation were dependent on the chosen synchronizing event (cf.
Supplementary Fig. 3). Next, we performed 100 permutations of left and right trials
and computed the difference in absolute firing rate between the two conditions
after shuffling, called Ds. We then computed the s.d. of the distribution of Ds
values, and computed a T-statistic Ta ¼ (Da–Ds)/s.d., which we refer to as
discrimination score. This Z-statistic attains statistical significance with values
41.63. Two criteria were set for the inclusion of trials: (i) the rat was required to
emit a response by passing the PNR within 15 s after stimulus onset; (ii) each
condition needed to contain at least five trials. The durations of time periods
during which the discrimination score was significantly elevated (that is, larger
than 1.63 during side-arm visits; cf. Supplementary Fig. 3) were compared between
brain areas using Kruskal–Wallis and post hoc Tukey–Kramer tests with a 95%
confidence interval.
Preferred arm and the NRD. Some PRH units showed a firing-rate increase in
one particular arm of the maze, while others showed a decrease for that same arm.
If one would take an average firing rate for one arm across all units, the different
types of firing-rate modulation would cancel out. For this reason we calculated, for
each unit, which of the two arms was ‘preferred’ in terms of being correlated to its
highest firing rate. First, we normalized the firing rates of each unit, assigned across
all 51 spatial bins, by dividing these values by its maximal firing rate. The maximal
rate of each unit was selected from all bins from both the left and right arm trials.
Next, we calculated the average normalized firing rate for all middle-lane bins, as
well as all 21 left- and all 21 right-arm bins, using the time periods associated
with forward locomotion. Normalized firing rates were only determined for units
with an average discrimination score 40.5 calculated across the entire side arms
(this criterion results in different single-unit counts than listed in Supplementary
Table 1). If the mean normalized firing rate for a given unit was higher for the left
arm than for the right arm, the left arm was designated as ‘preferred arm’ and the
right arm as ‘non-preferred arm’ and vice versa. For each unit, we next computed
the NRD in the spatial domain by subtracting the normalized firing rates of the
spatial bins of the non-preferred arm from the normalized firing rates of the
corresponding bins of the preferred arm. The same procedure was followed when
computing NRD values in the temporal domain, now taking temporal instead of
spatial bins. Left–right firing-rate differences for locomotion in forward and
opposite directions (Fig. 3l) were determined between the reward site and PRM.
In the time domain, the significance of mean NRDs was tested against 2 s of
contiguous baseline bins (10 ms in width; see also above, Statistical testing of neural
correlates). If a bin was significantly different from all baseline bins it was taken as
significant (a ¼ 0.01).
To calculate whether single units significantly differentiated between the left
and the right arms, we compared the time segments of left- versus right-sided trials
corresponding with the rat’s occupancy of the side arms ( � 1 s to þ 5 s around
PNR and � 5 s to 0 s around PRM, Mann–Whitney U-test, a ¼ 0.05).
Spatial consistency of left and right differences. Whereas PRH neurons
generated sustained and spatially extended firing patterns distinguishing between
the left and right arms, hippocampal and sensory cortical neurons generated more
phasic differential patterns (for example, Fig. 2). To quantify this difference, we
used a measure of the consistency of firing-rate differences between the left or right
arm across spatial bins. For each cell, we took the NRD across the spatial bins

 corresponding to the side arms (bins 12–30), which in almost all cases yielded
positive NRD values. NRD values smaller than zero were set to 0. We then ensured
that again for each cell, the NRD values summed up to 1, by dividing NRD(x) by
the sum of NRD(x) over the 19 bins (where x represents spatial bin number), thus
defining a quasi-probability variable p. We then computed the entropy of NRD by
summing up –p(x).log(p(x)) over all bins, and dividing this sum by log(19), cor-
responding to the 19 spatial bins. This yields a measure of spatial consistency
ranging between 0 and 1. If the NRD is constant across spatial bins, corresponding
to a situation where left–right differences are constant across all spatial bins, then
the consistency is maximal (1), whereas if the NRD is non-zero only at a single bin,
the consistency is minimal (0).
Distribution of start and end points of firing fields. To quantify the distribution
of spatial start and end points of sustained PRH firing fields and compare these to
CA1 place fields, we divided preferred and non-preferred trial trajectories into 30
bins, made up of 9 middle lane bins and 21 side arm bins (Supplementary Fig. 5a).
As above, this analysis included cells with an average discrimination score 40.5,
and only forward locomotion periods were taken into account. For each PRH unit
the baseline was calculated by taking the average firing rate across all preferred and
non-preferred bins. For both the preferred and non-preferred side this baseline was
subsequently subtracted from the binned firing rates. Because PRH neurons show
deactivations on their non-preferred side, we multiplied these values by � 1 to
obtained absolute values of deflections from baseline. Sustained activity was
subsequently determined by a method similar to those used to identify CA1 place
fields67,68. First, the data were smoothed using a five-point Gaussian. Second, we
determined the longest stretch of contiguous bins with a minimal firing rate of
420% of the maximum rate. A PRH neuron was designated as having an extended
firing field if the number of contiguous bins reaching 420% was at least nine.
Its start point was defined as the first bin (according to the animal’s locomotion
direction during task performance) surpassing the threshold, while the end point
marked the last bin where this threshold was reached. CA1 neurons generally have
smaller place fields. For these cells, at least three adjacent bins were required to
include them in the analysis. For the purpose of determining the start and end
points of spatially extended firing fields, the route travelled in a single, full trial was
assumed to be circular, so bin 1 was adjacent to bin 30. The assumption of
circularity has the advantage that start and end point estimates are not biased by
arbitrary cut-offs.
We determined the amount of scattering of firing fields across the maze by
computing the circular mean and circular variance of their start and end locations
(circular statistics toolbox, MATLAB69). 95% Confidence intervals of the variance
in start and end points were calculated by bootstrapping these points 1,000 times
within each condition and finding the outer 2.5 percentiles. Non-overlapping
confidence intervals are thus significantly different at a ¼ 0.05 (Supplementary
Fig. 5). Subsequently, the alignment of the start and end points of firing fields with
branch points was determined by calculating the spatial offset (in bins) between a
cell’s start point and the decision point (bin 9; Fig. 1a,b) and the offset between a
cell’s end point and the return branch point (bin 1).
Spike to LFP phase-locking. For every frequency f, we determined the spike-LFP
phases by cutting out LFP segments of length 7/f s (that is, 7 cycles) centred around
each spike. Spikes were exclusively related to LFPs recorded from a different
electrode to avoid contamination of the LFP by the spike itself. The spike-LFP
phases were then obtained as the complex arguments of the Hann-tapered LFP
segments.
The strength of spike-LFP phase-locking (Fig. 5) was quantified by the pairwise
phase consistency (PPC), which is unbiased by the number of spikes70. For the j-th
spike in the m-th trial we denote the average spike-LFP phase as ym,j, and similarly
for the k-th spike in a different trial l, where dependence on frequency is omitted in
what follows. The PPC is defined as

PM
l 6¼ m
PNm
j¼1
PNl
k¼1 cosðyl;k � ym;jÞ
PM

l 6¼ m NmNl
;
where Nm is the number of spikes for the m-th trial. The PPC quantifies the average
similarity (that is, in-phaseness) of any pair of two spikes from the same cell in the
LFP phase domain. Note that all pairs of spikes from the same trial are removed by
virtue of preventing l ¼ m in the above equation, because spike phases from the
same trial can typically not be treated as statistically independent random
variables70. PPC values were averaged across the different hippocampal electrodes,
and were computed in the 5–10 s window after image onset, and then correlated on
a cell-by-cell basis with the discrimination scores computed in the same window.
Spearman’s correlation was used to avoid assumptions of parametric regression
testing.
