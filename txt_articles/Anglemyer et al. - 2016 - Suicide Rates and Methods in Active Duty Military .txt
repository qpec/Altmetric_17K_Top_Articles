 Suicide Rates and Methods in Active Duty Military Personnel,
2005 to 2011
A Cohort Study
Andrew Anglemyer, PhD; Matthew L. Miller, MS; Samuel Buttrey, PhD; and Lyn Whitaker, PhD
Background: Suicide prevention programs have become ubiq-
uitous among military units; identifying temporal trends and
nonclinical factors associated with the chosen suicide methods
may help improve suicide prevention strategies.
Objective: To calculate suicide rates of active duty military per-
sonnel and identify those who are at risk for firearm-specific
suicide.
Design: Retrospective cohort study.
Setting: Military units in the United States.
Patients: All active duty enlisted U.S. military personnel from
2005 to 2011.
Measurements: Suicide rates per 100 000 were calculated for
each branch. Adjusted odds ratios for firearm-specific suicide
were calculated with 95% CIs.
Results: 1455 military personnel committed suicide from 2005
to 2011. From 2006 to 2011, the rates were highest among army
personnel (19.13 to 29.44 cases per 100 000). Among suicides
with a known cause of death, 62% were attributed to firearms.
The results of this study also suggest that among army personnel
or marines who committed suicide, those with infantry or special
operations job classifications were more likely than those in non-
infantry positions to use a firearm.
Limitations: Results are generalizable only to enlisted person-
nel and reflect only stateside suicides. Data regarding previous
psychiatric illness, deployment history, and firearms ownership
were lacking.
Conclusion: These results may help inform policymakers and
advisors about differences in risks of suicide and violent suicide
among the armed services and may help guide efforts to pre-
vent self-harm within the military.

S
uicide rates have increased by 60% worldwide dur-
ing the past 47 years and is a leading cause of
death among 15- to 44-year-olds (1). In 2010, suicide
was the 10th leading cause of death in the United
States (2). The overall suicide rate in the U.S. military
has also increased, almost doubling from 2001 to 2011
(3).
Potential factors that have changed over time, such
as deployments and mental health conditions, have
helped clarify the reasons for the increased suicide rate
in the U.S. military. A recent study of suicide risk among
veterans found that deployment did not increase the
risk for suicide (4), whereas other studies explored risk
for suicide after psychiatric hospitalization (5) as well as
psychosocial risk (6).
Research and debate are ongoing regarding the
various motivations for choosing a particular method of
suicide (7, 8). Previous studies showed that men are
more likely to use violent methods of suicide (for exam-
ple, firearm related), whereas women are more likely to
use nonviolent means (for example, poisoning) (8).
Within the military, research suggests that the suicide
risk is significantly greater among personnel whose oc-
cupations provide easy access to firearms than among
those in other occupations (9). Some researchers have
suggested that both psychological and biological dif-
ferences exist between people who choose violent
methods and those who use nonviolent ones (10, 11).
Empirical evidence suggests that among military con-
scripts, previous problems in school may predict vio-
lent suicide attempts, which also may be a strong indi-
cator
of
subsequent
suicide
(12).
Indeed,
violent
suicide attempts have been linked very strongly to sub-
sequent suicide completion (12). In fact, a person who
attempts suicide by firearm has a risk for subsequent
completed suicide about 5 times higher than that of
people who attempt suicide by nonviolent means (haz-
ard ratio [HR], 5.18 [95% CI, 1.27 to 21.24]) (12).
A common limitation in previous analyses evaluat-
ing suicide trends in the U.S. military was a lack of con-
solidated service data. Before 2008, risk factor analyses
for U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) suicides were
performed in relatively small populations, primarily at
the military service level, by using service-unique data-
bases (6). Moreover, the bulk of research has focused
on the army (4, 5, 13–18), whereas studies including all
services have been limited to survey-type data or have
had limited follow-up (16–18).
The objective of the present study is to evaluate
suicide rates among active duty military personnel
across
years
and
to
identify
differences
among
branches. Further, with regard to completed suicides,
we aim to identify the groups of active duty military
personnel who are at greatest risk for firearm-specific
suicide.

 (SDR), which has mitigated the problem of insufficient
consolidated data. The SDR combines data from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) via
the National Death Index (NDI), as well as the Military
Mortality Database, to provide a collection of demo-
graphic and military-specific information on all service
members and veterans who committed suicide and
had served in the armed forces since 1974. The SDR
was fully established in 2013 and to our knowledge is
the most comprehensive source of demographic and
military-specific data on suicides in the U.S. military.
The data for this study were provided by the Defense
Manpower Data Center (DMDC).
Study Population
We used 2 data sets: The first, extracted from the
SDR, contains demographic and military-specific data
for each suicide; the second contains the monthly end
strength, or personnel count on the last day of the
month, for each demographic subpopulation. All sub-
population strata were combinations of the following:
year, sex, age, race, marital status, education, age at
enlistment, rank, and Armed Forces Qualification Test
(AFQT) category (higher AFQT categories represent
lower cognitive ability; for example, category IIIB or
higher is equal to a percentile score <50). Data on ac-
tive duty personnel were not fully available for suicides
occurring before 2005 or for those occurring outside
the United States. Therefore, our study population
comprises all enlisted personnel (that is, nonofficers) of
the U.S. military regular component (including the
army, air force, navy, and marines) who committed sui-
cide while on active duty stateside between 2005 and
2011. For the analysis of firearm-specific suicides, we
attempted to exclude suicides among enlistees who
did not have military service exposure and perhaps had
an unrecognized predisposition to suicidality before
entering the military; therefore, we included only those
who had already completed training. The DOD Human
Research Protection Program and Naval Postgraduate
School's Institutional Review Board approved the col-
lection of the data for this study (NPS.2014.0073).
Statistical Analysis
Temporal Trends of Active Duty Military Suicide
Using the combined data set containing both sui-
cides
and
personnel
counts,
we
determined
the
branch-specific suicide rates. Service branches have
different missions and recruit and attract different types
of personnel; because we could not control for these
differences with our available data, we analyzed data
for each branch separately.
Predictors of Violent Methods Among Active Duty
Military Suicides
Using the cohort of completed suicides in the SDR
data set, we identified predictors of firearm-specific sui-
cide. Predictor variables included factors previously
identified in the literature and a priori hypothesized to
affect both the service and the outcome. To evaluate
the total effect of each military branch on firearm-
specific suicide, we considered several covariates, in-
cluding age at death, rank, sex, education, race, marital
status, religion, length of service at the time of death,
AFQT score category, and primary military occupation
(that is, infantry/special operations). We identified cova-
riates to adjust for in multivariable models using a di-
rected acyclic graph approach (representing the rela-
tionships among service, suicide, and other variables)
to determine minimally sufficient adjustment sets (19)
(Appendix Figure, available at www.annals.org). The
minimally sufficient adjustment set identified included
infantry/special operations job classification, age, sex,
AFQT score category, and education. We restricted the
multivariable models identifying predictors of firearm-
specific suicide to men, because more than 95% of all
suicides were committed by men (only 1 female marine
and 9 female navy personnel committed suicide).
Among the navy and air force suicides, we did not con-
sider infantry/special operations job classification in
multivariable models because only 2 suicides were
identified and this job classification is found more com-
monly in the army and marines.
Of 1416 suicides, 366 (25.8%) had missing data for
firearm-specific suicide or covariates (Appendix Table
1, available at www.annals.org). We used multiple im-
putation to address missing data, and we assumed data
were missing at random. The variables included in the
imputation models included method of suicide, AFQT
score category, education, infantry/special operations
job classification, sex, and age; imputations were run
separately by branch. We specified conditional models
and performed the imputations based on these condi-
tional models. We generated multiple sets (m = 10) of
imputed values, allowing us to account for the uncer-
tainty inherent in using the imputed values in our mod-
els (20, 21). The imputed data sets were combined by
applying Rubin rules (22, 23), which are used to appro-
priately adjust estimated SEs, and thus CIs and P val-
ues, to account for the additional uncertainty associ-
ated with data missingness. Because the mechanism of
these missing data is unknown and may not be consis-
tent with the missing-at-random assumption, these re-
sults should be interpreted cautiously. In a secondary
analysis, we compared multiple imputation results with
a complete case analysis approach, excluding observa-
tions with missing data. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) are
reported with 95% CI. Data were analyzed using R ver-
sion 3.1.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) (24).
The base package was used for the logistic models,
and the mice (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equa-
tions) package (25) was used for the multiple imputa-
tion analyses.

RESULTS
A total of 1455 suicides occurred during 125 mil-
lion person-months among the active duty, regular
component enlisted personnel in the U.S. Army, Air
Force, Marine Corps, and Navy from 2005 to 2011, with

 an average end strength for that period of 451 000,
268 000, 173 000, and 283 000, respectively. The high-
est suicide rates (per 100 000) from 2005 to 2011 were
in the army in 2009 and 2010 (29.44 and 29.15 sui-
cides, respectively) (Figure and Table 1), whereas the
lowest suicide rates were in the air force and navy in
2005 (9.95 and 9.79 suicides, respectively). From 2006
to 2011, the rates were higher among army personnel
(19.13 to 29.44 cases per 100 000) than among mem-
bers of any other branch.
Characteristics
Of these suicides, 1416 occurred among nontrain-
ees, comprising our suicide cohort (Table 2). Most
(52.5%) were among army personnel, and approxi-
mately 95% occurred in men. The median age was 25
years (interquartile range [IQR], 22 to 30 years) across
all branches; however, suicides among marines seem
to have occurred in younger personnel than those
among members of the other services (22 years [IQR,
20 to 25]). Approximately 60% of suicides occurred in
the lower enlisted ranks (E1 to E4). In the navy and air
force, fewer than 50% of suicides were in lower enlisted
ranks, whereas in the army, 66.9% of suicides occurred
in lower enlisted ranks. The lower ranks in the marines
accounted for more than 70% of suicides in that
branch. More than 75% of suicides were carried out by
white service members across all branches, with little
difference among branches, although a higher percent-
age (85.2%) of suicides occurred in marines who were
white. Among service members who committed sui-
cide, little difference in marital status was observed
among the branches, although the air force had the
lowest proportion of suicides (34.7%) in those who
were never married. More than 87% of suicides oc-
curred in service members with only a high school di-
ploma; more than 95% occurred in marines with only a
high school diploma. Nearly half the suicides (45.6%) in
the navy were carried out by members who claimed no
religious preference. In contrast, one quarter (26.3%) of
the suicides in the army and less than one quarter
(22.9%) in the marines and air force occurred in those
who claimed no religious preference. Among service
members who committed suicide, the median length of
service was 4 years (IQR, 2 to 8 years), with army per-
sonnel and marines having the 2 shortest median
lengths of service (3 and 2 years, respectively). Across
all branches, the largest proportion of suicides (38.8%)
occurred among those in AFQT category II. More than
half of all suicides in the air force and navy were carried
out by members in category I or II (50.8% and 51.8%,
respectively).
Firearms were the primary cause of death (47.9%)
across all branches as well as for each branch. Among
suicides with a known cause, firearms accounted for
62.3%. Within the navy, personnel with an aircraft-
related primary occupation made up the second larg-

 est proportion of suicides (19.0%); however, the largest
proportion of suicides (32.3%) in the navy occurred
among personnel in positions outside the common job
classifiers. Among army personnel who died by suicide,
the most common job classifier was infantry or special
operations (24.2%); one quarter (25.0%) of air force sui-
cides occurred among personnel with aircraft-related
primary occupations, and nearly one third (32.4%) of
marine suicides were carried out by those in the infan-
try or special operations.
Odds of Firearm-Specific Suicide
In both the army and marines, the odds of a service
member committing suicide with a firearm were twice
as great if he or she had an infantry or special opera-
tions job classification than if he or she had any other
job classification (aOR, 2.09 [CI, 1.32 to 3.32] for the
army; aOR, 2.70 [CI, 1.17 to 6.23] for the marines), after
adjustment for known confounders (Table 3). The odds
of a service member in the army committing suicide
with a firearm were 1.47 times higher if he or she was in
AFQT category IIIB or higher than if he or she was in
AFQT category I (that is, had greater cognitive ability)
(aOR, 1.47 [CI, 1.02 to 2.12]), after adjustment for
known confounders. Lastly, among air force personnel,
those who had completed some college courses had
0.36 times the odds of committing suicide with a fire-
arm than those with no college education (aOR, 0.36
[CI, 0.15 to 0.91]), after adjustment for known con-
founders. The complete case analyses provide similar
estimates (Appendix Table 2, available at www.annals
.org).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that from 2005 to 2011, the
active duty, regular component enlisted service mem-
bers most at risk for suicide were in the army. In addi-
tion, the navy, air force, and army all had increasing
rates of suicide over time, with the greatest increase in
the army. Our results also suggest that among the army
and marine personnel who committed suicide, those
with infantry or special operations job classifications
were more likely than noninfantry personnel to use a
firearm.
Clearly, a need exists to identify military personnel
at risk for suicide and to provide them with necessary
care. Identifying the service members most at risk is
challenging for various reasons, including a resistance
to seek care because of the fear of stigmatization or of
jeopardizing one's career (26). The American Academy
of Family Physicians has emphasized the need for clini-
cians first to identify at-risk service members by tailor-
ing military-specific questions regarding their mental
health (27). Although the risk dynamics of deployment
history, job classification, and branch of service are not
fully understood, assuming all military personnel are at
risk and assessing them appropriately by using a vali-
dated screening tool may be an effective approach to
reducing suicide attempts (28). Furthermore, clinicians
should recognize the unique risks that firearms pose in
this population: Not only do veterans have 4 times
more firearms than nonveterans (29), they are more
likely than nonveterans to use them to commit suicide
(30).
Our results are particularly interesting in light of the
recent mass shooting of military personnel in Chatta-
nooga, Tennessee. As a result of this terrorist act, U.S.
Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter, after a review of
security policies at military facilities, authorized an in-
crease in firearm presence among qualified DOD per-
sonnel at military installations (31). Concurrently, mem-
bers of the U.S. House of Representatives proposed at
least 3 bills aimed at repealing current restrictions on
carrying firearms at military establishments (Enhancing
Safety at Military Installations Act, H.R. 3115, 114th

 Cong. [2015 to 2016]) and at establishing the right to
carry personally owned and government-issued fire-
arms at recruitment offices (Military Recruiter Right to
Carry Act of 2015, H.R. 3138, 114th Cong. [2015 to
2016]; Securing Military Personnel Response Firearm
Initiative [SEMPER FI] Act, H.R. 3139, 114th Cong. [2015
to 2016]). However, this legislation may have unin-
tended consequences, as increased access to firearms
has been linked repeatedly to increased suicide and
intimate partner violence (32).
The “healthy warrior effect” presumably would
yield a lower suicide rate in the military than in the gen-
eral population because of health screening on entry
and periodic health assessments (33). However, there is
little evidence that the current suicide rate among ser-
vice members is lower than that of the general popula-
tion; in fact, the rates in the present study are higher
than those in the general population. For these rea-
sons, any future research in the military population
should at least consider mental health history, although
its effect on suicide or choice of method remains un-
clear. As previously shown, access to firearms may in-
crease a person's suicide risk (34), but this increased
risk is not unique to individuals with a history of mental
illness (35). Moreover, the risk for suicide as it pertains
to firearm access may be an indicator more of impulsiv-
ity than of underlying mental illness. Previous research,
if stratified by those with and those without a diag-
nosed mental illness, indicates there is no difference in
firearm-specific suicide risk (35).
Our findings are similar to those of previous re-
search evaluating firearm access and suicide risk
among military service members in other countries.
Among the Defence Forces of Ireland, 53% of suicides
were the result of a firearm; however, nearly all suicides
occurring during duty on a military base were caused
by a firearm (36). Similarly, in the present study of U.S.
active duty personnel, 48% of suicides were the result
of a firearm; however, 62% of suicides with a known
cause of death were attributed to firearms.
Two previous studies comparing suicide rates in
the U.S. military with those in the civilian population
found that the rate among civilians was approximately
2 times greater than the rate in military personnel (37,
38). These studies covered the period from 1980 to
1992, which includes a major war (that is, the Gulf War
of 1990 to 1991); however, the long-term, indirect, and
direct effects of combat operations could not have
been seen. Moreover, although several previous stud-
ies of the armed forces of various countries found that
the suicide rate among military personnel was consis-
tently lower than that of the civilian comparison popu-
lation (39–42), we found a higher suicide rate in the
U.S. military than in the civilian population.
From 2006 to mid-2009, a period including the
troop surge and subsequent drawdown in Iraq, the ma-
rines had the second highest suicide rates (Figure). The
army's highest suicide rates occurred from 2009 to
2011, a period encompassing the drawdown in Iraq
and a troop increase in Afghanistan. For these reasons,
it is possible that several unique service-specific risk
factors existed (that is, the surge in Iraq may have af-
fected suicides among marines, whereas the change in
mission emphasis affected suicides in the army). Al-
though some recent research suggests that deploy-
ment may not be a risk factor for suicide (4), our re-
search suggests that several factors may affect suicide
risk,
including
combat
operations
in
2
separate
theaters.
Alcohol and other factors may play important roles
in suicide risk, perhaps even more than suicidal history.
Stenbacka and Jokinen (12) recently found that among
military conscripts with no history of attempted suicide,
those who had a history of alcohol abuse or contact
with police were at higher risk for completed suicide
than those who did not have such a history. In addition,
combat experiences previously were linked to alcohol
misuse. In fact, the adjusted odds of alcohol misuse are
greater for special operations personnel who engage
in combat (aOR, 2.12 [CI, 1.51 to 2.98]) and for special
operations personnel who are determined to be a
threat to themselves (aOR, 1.60 [CI, 1.18 to 2.18]) than
for special operations personnel without those specific
characteristics (43). Similarly, Wilk and colleagues (44)

 estimated the odds of alcohol misuse among recently
redeployed infantry personnel and found similar rela-
tionships between combat and alcohol misuse and
threat to oneself and alcohol misuse.
Our findings are subject to various limitations. We
included only active duty, regular component enlisted
personnel. However, suicide rates in the U.S. military
have been shown to be higher among enlistees and
even higher for junior than senior enlistees (14, 18, 45).
Suicide
rates
may
vary
among
components
and
branches of service. Namely, a member may serve in
the regular, National Guard, or reserve component,
and each component differs in several ways (such as
recruitment
standards,
operational
objectives,
and
stressors). Although suicide is not unique to men, the
generalizability of the analysis of predictors of firearm-
specific suicide is limited to active duty enlisted men
because of the scarcity of data on women who commit
suicide. Our study considered only completed suicides
and did not consider suicide ideation, plans, or at-
tempts. It is possible that reduced access to firearms
has resulted in a shift in preferred suicide methods in
some services. Compared with other branches, among
navy suicides with a known cause of death, the pro-
portion attributed to firearms was the lowest (56%) and
that attributed to pharmaceutical-related suicide was
the highest (8%). In addition, in the analysis of predic-
tors of firearm-specific suicide, the method was missing
for 23% of the suicides, which may have biased our
sample in an unknown direction. Without information
about previous suicide attempts, we could capture only
the completed suicides, biasing our sample toward
methods with higher lethality. Although research sug-
gests that a person who attempts suicide by violent
means has a markedly high risk for subsequent com-
pletion (12), attempts with a firearm largely are success-
ful. Therefore, when considering violent suicide meth-
ods,
any
examinations
of
subsequent
completed
suicide risk are somewhat limited by the method
chosen.
Because of limitations within the source databases,
our study includes only suicides occurring stateside. As
such, we could not evaluate the suicide risk of service
members on deployment. The DMDC, the DOD office
that controls these data, does not yet have NDI data
(CDC controlled) linked to the DOD records beyond
2011. Part of the DMDC's strategic data plan is to have
updated NDI decedent data (through 2013 to 2014)
matched with DOD personnel records by the end of
2016. For a more robust analysis, ideally a longitudinal
data set matching records from the 2 data sets along
with deployment, medical, and other histories would
be constructed. To the extent that our classification of
suicide methods was inaccurate, we acknowledge the
possibility of bias in the firearm-specific suicide analy-
sis, if there was differential misclassification of methods
used among branches of the service. Lastly, because of
a lack of information regarding ownership of the weap-
ons used in these suicides, our results likely are not
especially informative for policies regarding access to
personally owned firearms on military installations.
