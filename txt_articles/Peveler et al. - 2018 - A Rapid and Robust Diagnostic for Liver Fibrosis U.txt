designed from materials that are resistant 
to fouling by protein adsorption and deg-
radation by enzymes, yet can still operate 
with clinically relevant specificity and 
sensitivity.
Liver disease is a particularly significant 
yet underexplored target for PoC blood 
testing, despite its prevalence and socio-
economic costs. In contrast to cancer and 
heart disease, mortality from liver disease 
has increased over the last 30 years and 
is now the fifth most common cause of 
middle-aged death in Western society. Liver 
disease costs health services tens of billions 
of dollars each year,[7] and could affect an 
estimated 30% of people in the US.[8]
Disease severity, prognosis, and response to treatment for 
liver disease are largely determined by the stage of liver fibrosis 
(scarring).[9] Liver health is strongly manifested in blood composi-
tion,[10,11] with immunosensing platforms such as the “enhanced 
liver fibrosis” test (ELF) used to assess and monitor fibrosis 
progression from serum without invasive biopsies currently in 
standard use.[11,12] These blood tests quantify multiple serum bio-
markers to provide a measure of liver fibrosis, shortening time to 
treatment, and improving assessment of patient prognosis.[12,13] 
The instability of the bioconjugates used for biomarker detection, 
however, requires sending samples to centralized pathology labo-
ratories for analysis, increasing cost and complexity of tests, and 
delaying diagnosis and treatment for patients.[14,15]
Cross-reactive “chemical nose/tongue” sensing arrays have 
emerged as a strategy to rapidly profile complex chemical and 
Liver disease is the fifth most common cause of premature death in the Western 
world, with the irreversible damage caused by fibrosis, and ultimately cirrhosis, 
a primary driver of mortality. Early detection of fibrosis would facilitate treat-
ment of the underlying liver disease to limit progression. Unfortunately, most 
cases of liver disease are diagnosed late, with current strategies reliant on inva-
sive biopsy or fragile lab-based antibody technologies. A robust, fully synthetic 
fluorescent-polymer sensor array is reported, which, rapidly (in 45 minutes), 
detects liver fibrosis from low-volume serum samples with clinically relevant 
specificity and accuracy, using an easily readable diagnostic output. The simpli-
city, rapidity, and robustness of this method make it a promising platform for 
point-of-care diagnostics for detecting and monitoring liver disease.
Sensors
Point of care (PoC) diagnostics based on blood serum allow 
rapid and accurate diagnosis of more disease states than any 
other body fluid, and can be administered at the hospital bed-
side, at local clinics, or in the patient’s home.[1–3] PoC diag-
nostics can greatly improve care in both urban and rural 
communities by enabling more frequent monitoring of patient 
health, yielding both lower costs and shorter analysis times.[4] 
In all areas of biomedicine, continuous longitudinal collection 
of health-data can lower patient mortality rates by facilitating 
earlier intervention.[5] Serum is however a challenging medium 
for sensors, containing thousands of different proteins, at con-
centrations ranging over ten orders of magnitude, as well as 
salts, carbohydrates, and lipids.[6] Serum-based PoC diagnos-
tics must be quick, robust, low-cost, and use small sample vol-
umes of serum. Additionally, serum-based diagnostics must be

biological systems using robust synthetic receptors.[16,17] These 
array-based sensors generate patterns from the sample that 
are subsequently classified to generate algorithms for identi-
fying analytes. Synthetic solution-based arrays have been suc-
cessful in “fingerprinting” and distinguishing proteins spiked 
in serum,[18] as well as in cell and cell lysate sensing.[19–21] 
Pattern-based serum sensing, however, has not been widely 
demonstrated, with neither examples based on robust mul-
tiplexed (single well) sensing nor examples that can stage a 
disease.[22–24] Such a “hypothesis-free” approach would allow 
for disease detection using multiple known and unknown bio-
markers in a single assay.
We 
present 
here 
a 
robust, 
multiplexed 
fluorescent-
polymer-based sensor platform that detects liver fibrosis from 
a small-volume serum sample, with clinically relevant accuracy. 
The sensor elements have been engineered to act both as cross-
reactive recognition and transduction elements, with modulated 
fluorescence provided by simple chemical moieties. This chem-
ical approach generates a modular and reproducible array design, 
simplifying implementation relative to most or multi 
part sensor 
systems.[18,25] By mixing three of the chemically stable poly 
mers 
in a single, multiplexed array, an information-rich output (four 
fluorescent channels) is generated from a single sample meas-
urement (Figure 1). This array can accurately distinguish non-
fibrotic patients from those with early stage liver fibrosis, in a 
cohort of 65 benchmarked patient samples. Significantly, the pol-
ymer sensor does not degrade in ambient conditions, dramati-
cally increasing the viability of this platform for PoC diagnostics 
relative to the biologicals used in current methods.
Our sensor array is based on a poly(oxanorborneneimide) 
(PONI) random copolymer scaffold,[26] chosen for its ease of 
modification and good compatibility with biological media.[27] 
The polymer featured benzoate (Bz) monomers to provide pro-
tein recognition and reactive sites for dye attachment using 
NHS-ester chemistry, with the overall fluorophore loading con-
trolled by proportionate mixing of the two monomer units in 
the PONI backbone (Figure 1e). The number of repeat units 
(≈40) was kept low to enhance stability in serum. This scaf-
fold was decorated with environmentally responsive fluorescent 
dyes that act both as cross-reactive recognition and transduc-
tion elements, providing a straightforward array design.
Three PONI-polymer sensor elements were synthesized 
bearing pendant pyrene (Py), dapoxyl (Dap), and PyMPO 
dyes (Figure 1e). Overall, the concise 3-polymer sensor gener-
ates four channels from a single sample measurement. Each 
poly 
mer displayed a change in fluorescence intensity upon the 
addition of specific proteins to the polymer solution, due to 
changes in the ionic strength, pH, and supramolecular inter-
actions of the dyes (Figure 1f).[28,29] The Py polymer displays 
a principle emission at 380 nm and an excimer emission at 
480 nm.[30] The former band is ratiometrically sensitive to the 
polarity of the pyrene microenvironment, and the latter to the 
physical separation of multiple pyrenes.[31] Dapoxyl and PyMPO 
gave emission in the yellow/orange region of the spectrum at 
580 and 570 nm, respectively, but had well separated excitation 
bands (330 and 416 nm) providing spectral resolution in the 
mixed system (Figure S1, Supporting Information).
Initial experiments were performed by testing the array 
against 40 µL human serum samples, the amount available 
from a single drop finger-stick sample, and hence suitable for 
PoC applications.[32] Increases in fluorescence intensity were 
observed for all polymers in differing ratios on mixing with 
serum. While some red- or blueshifting of the peaks were also 
seen, the intensity changes were the major factor (Figure S2, 
 
Supporting Information). In the first tests, the ability of the 
array to measure perturbations in protein levels in human 
serum was tested by spiking analyte proteins (human serum 
albumin (HSA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), transferrin (Trf), 
fibrinogen (Fib), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (a1AT)) into diluted 
or full human serum (Figures S3 and S4 and Table S1, Sup-
porting Information). Full details are given in the Supporting 
Information.

The array was then tested to determine whether it could “fin-
gerprint” liver fibrosis in a serum sample, using the hypoth-
esis-free approach to provide a potentially clinically relevant 
assay. The ELF test, based on three serum biomarkers hypo-
thetically linked to liver fibrosis, was used as our benchmark, 
due to its use as a gold-standard for fibrosis detection in a wide 
range of liver diseases.[11,33] Sixty-five human serum samples 
were previously quantified for hyaluronic acid (HA), PIIINP 
(N-terminal propeptide of Type III collagen), and TIMP-1 
 
(a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase) with the commercial 
ELF test, to generate an ELF score for each sample (Table 1).
This sample library represented an “averaged” disease land-
scape, reflecting the spectrum of liver diseases encountered in 
hospital practice, across age and gender, with equal representa-
tion of healthy patients and patients with moderate and severe 
fibrosis. While age and gender can be used as a proxy for “risk 
factor,” they were not used here, nor in the ELF scoring of the 
samples.[33] Fifty samples were categorized into three groups on 
the basis of their ELF score: healthy (ELF < 8.0), mild-moderate 
fibrosis (8.0 ≤ ELF > 10.5) or severe fibrosis (ELF ≥ 10.5), set as 
per National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
guidance for liver fibrosis.[34] The second set of 15 samples was 
set aside as an independent validation set (Table S2, Supporting 
Information).
Serum was added to the polymer sensor solution in a 
standard microplate for fibrosis detection studies. Samples 
were measured in replicate and the ratiometric change in each 
fluorescent readout used to generate the fluorescent fingerprint 
of each sample (Figure S5 and Table S3, Supporting Informa-
tion). Sensor response was generated in 30–45 min, much 
faster than current methods requiring multiple hours.
The fluorescent patterns generated from mixing the polymer 
and serum samples were processed with a simple LDA (linear 
discriminant analysis) model. Each polymer displays a change 
in fluorescence intensity upon the addition of serum containing 
various proteins to the polymer solution, due to changes in the 
ionic strength, pH, and supramolecular interactions of the dyes 
(Figure 1f). The relative change in the emission intensity (I/I0) 
of each polymer is recorded for each sample in the “training” 
dataset (Figure 1c). The data processing with LDA takes the four 
recorded polymer emissions for each sample and creates a linear 
combination of the input data—a “score.”. This is done in such 
a way as to minimize the variance between samples of the same 
group (e.g., all “healthy” samples have a similar score) while 
maximizing the difference between samples of different groups 
(scores for “healthy” and “fibrotic” samples are as different as 
possible) (Figure 1d). Alternative, nonlinear models such as 
quadratic discriminant analysis, or support vector machines were 
also tested, but had issues of overfitting the data in this case.
For the samples of unknown liver health in the “test” dataset, 
the four polymer emissions are recorded for each as before. 
These data were compared quantitatively to the training set 
through their Mahalanobis distance[35] to the previously defined 
groups (e.g., healthy or fibrotic), a technique that provides effec-
tive classification of new samples.[20,36]
A diagnostic test for healthy, mild-moderate or severe fibrosis 
was developed by training this model against the first 50 patient 
samples. This classification model can distinguish between the 
three individual groups with 60% accuracy (Figure 2a; Figure S6, 
Supporting Information), with the most misclassification occur-
ring between mild-moderate and severe fibrosis. An independent 
reference sample set was analyzed with the same model (n = 15, 
across all classes), with LDA giving 66.7% accuracy using the 
same 3-group model (Table S6, Supporting Information).
Notably, the array could discriminate between healthy sam-
ples and those from patients with fibrosis, a critical distinction 
of interest to clinicians. Thus, further analysis was undertaken 
using the healthy group versus a total fibrotic group combing 
mild/moderate and severe into one class.
Multiple common liver biomarkers were measured in the 
samples and correlated to the classification accuracy (Figure S7, 
Supporting Information). Some small correlations between 
TIMP-1 levels and misclassification of the fibrotic samples were 
evident, but a lack of overall correlation between total protein 
concentrations or key proteins and the misclassified results 
indicate that there are indeed multiple biomarkers being ana-
lyzed to generate the result. Ultimately it is this signature that 
is determined and can be linked back to the disease; this is an 
area we are currently investigating further for future biomarker 
discovery and improvements to fibrosis detection.
Accuracy and sensitivity were determined through receiver 
operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (Figure 2b).[37] 
Improvement in a classifier is indicated by an increase in the 
overall summary metric of area under ROC curve (AUROC), 
with the value ranging between 1 (perfect) and 0.5 (no better 
than chance), and the standard AUROC required of a diagnostic 
test for clinical relevancy is >0.80 (although other measures such 
as positive/negative predictive values must be considered too).[38]
The LDA model was recalculated as described above to 
distinguish healthy patients from those with any degree of 
fibrosis (Figure 2c). This model classified the data with 80% 
accuracy and generated a single LDA score for each data 
point. In the 15-sample test set, the classification was also 
80% for healthy samples versus fibrotic samples (Table S4, 
 
Supporting Information). The means of the two groups in the 
LDA were significantly different (t-test, p < 0.001) and the cut-off 
between healthy and fibrotic was determined to be an LDA score 
of 0.304 (Figure 2c). On this basis, sensitivity (the ratio of true

positives to total positive values found) was calculated as 74% 
and specificity as 94% (the ratio of true negatives to total nega-
tive values found). The AUROC was found to be 0.89 (Figure 2d), 
greater than the threshold for clinical relevance. Our new poly-
mer-based test is fully comparable to other methods of diag-
nosing and staging fibrosis, such as elastography (AUROC = 
 
0.84–0.89)[39] and other serum biomarker tests (AUROC = 
 
0.76–0.89).[33,40] Therefore the result represents a substantial 
advance in both the use of array-based sensors for disease diag-
nosis, and in the detection of fibrosis, and a next step will be to 
recruit a larger cohort for better assessment of clinical utility.
In summary, we have fabricated a new multiplexed fluorescent-
polymer sensor array capable of detecting liver fibrosis using low 
volume serum. The accuracy and sensitivity of our hypothesis-free 
platform compares favorably against other leading biomarker-
driven methods for detecting fibrosis, but does not require the 
specialist instrumentation of, for example, elastography, while 
the robustness of the polymer platform is unprecedented for 
serum assay liver diagnostics, removing the need for cold-chain 
transport and storage. This combination of excellent accuracy, fast 
result time, and stability provides a promising avenue for transla-
tion into a rapid, robust, point-of-care disease diagnostic for near-
patient testing at home or in a primary care setting.
Experimental Section
Polymer Synthesis: Monomers and polymers were synthesized as 
described in the Supporting Information and previous publication.[41]
ELF Characterization: Serum samples were anonymous, unlinked, 
residual samples discarded after clinical evaluation from the liver clinics 
at the Royal Free Hospital, London, of volume between 0.5 and 1 mL and 
stored at −80 °C. The samples represented a range of etiologies of liver 
disease and were from a range of ages and genders. Serum had been 
previously collected and analyzed using standard iQur protocols, as detailed 
in the Supporting Information. All samples were collected, stored, and 
analyzed in compliance with Protocol IRAS: 197224, which has undergone 
ethical review and was approved by the London-South East Research Ethics 
Committee on behalf of the UK National Research Ethics Committee.
Array Methodology: The polymers were diluted and mixed in 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 150 × 10−3 m to final 
concentrations of 4.7 × 10−6 m for PONI-Bz-Py, 13.3 × 10−6 m for PONI-
Bz-Dap, and 6.0 × 10−6 m for PONI-Bx-PyMPO. For the spiked serum 
experiments 190 µL of polymer solution was loaded into a 96-well 
plate, and 10 µL of serum was added. For the fibrosis sensing, it was 
determined that larger fluorescence changes could be achieved with 
a slightly larger volume of serum. Therefore, future experiments used 
40 µL of serum to maximize I/I0 while maintaining a reasonable 
dynamic range: 160 µL of the resultant polymer solution was loaded 
into a 96-well plate following the injection of the specimen (40 µL of 
patient serum specimens). As a control experiment, PBS solution was 
injected instead of the serum specimens to account for dilution (I0). 
The samples were incubated for 45 min, with measures made at 0, 15, 
30, and 45 min. The emission spectra of the polymers were recorded at 
the optimal excitation/emission (Ex/Em) wavelengths: PONI-Bz-Py with 
 
Ex/Em 346/380 nm and an excimer emission 346/480 nm. PONI-Bz-Dap 
with Ex/Em 330/580 nm. PONI-Bz-PyMPO with Ex/Em 416/570 nm, 
using a fluorescence microplate reader, from each well plate (I) and is 
normalized against the PBS reference; I/I0.
Three to six replicates were obtained for each specimen, dependant 
on residual volume, and the 45 min data were used and averaged.

Standard deviations of the averages (the coefficient of variation) were 
8% or less. Fifty patient training set samples and four channels from the 
change in the major excitation-emission of the three PONI-Bz polymers 
generated a 50 × 4 data matrix. LDA was applied using SYSTAT and JMP 
software packages. The canonical scores generated by the LDA model 
were used to classify the training samples and a separate test set of 
15 samples; five each of healthy, mild, and severe. In the case of healthy 
versus fibrotic classification, a single canonical score was generated and 
significance of difference between the two groups tested with a two-
group t-test. ROC analysis preformed in Origin Pro generated a ROC 
curve and AUROC statistics.
