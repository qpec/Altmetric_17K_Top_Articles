and on their relationship with healthcare
professionals

Abstract
Background: Since the emergence of social media in 2004, a growing percentage of patients use this technology
for health related reasons. To reflect on the alleged beneficial and potentially harmful effects of social media use by
patients, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the extant literature on the effects of social media use
for health related reasons on patients and their relationship with healthcare professionals.
Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review on empirical research regarding the effects of social media
use by patients for health related reasons. The papers we included met the following selection criteria: (1) published in
a peer-reviewed journal, (2) written in English, (3) full text available to the researcher, (4) contain primary empirical data,
(5) the users of social media are patients, (6) the effects of patients using social media are clearly stated, (7) satisfy
established quality criteria.
Results: Initially, a total of 1,743 articles were identified from which 22 were included in the study. From these articles
six categories of patients’ use of social media were identified, namely: emotional, information, esteem, network support,
social comparison and emotional expression. The types of use were found to lead to seven identified types of effects
on patients, namely improved self-management and control, enhanced psychological well-being, and enhanced
subjective well-being, diminished subjective well-being, addiction to social media, loss of privacy, and being targeted
for promotion. Social media use by patients was found to affect the healthcare professional and patient relationship,
by leading to more equal communication between the patient and healthcare professional, increased switching of
doctors, harmonious relationships, and suboptimal interaction between the patient and healthcare professional.
Conclusions: Our review provides insights into the emerging utilization of social media in healthcare. In particular, it
identifies types of use by patients as well as the effects of such use, which may differ between patients and doctors.
Accordingly, our results framework and propositions can serve to guide future research, and they also have practical
implications for healthcare providers and policy makers.

 Background
Previous studies on social media use in healthcare iden-
tified different effects of social media use by patients
for health related reasons within the healthcare system.
Social media can serve as an aid to patients. For ex-
ample, it fosters their autonomy by complementing
the information provided by healthcare professionals
[1] and by providing psychosocial support [2]. Social
media use by patients can also be an aid to health-
care professionals by providing a tool to strengthen
the organization’s market position [3, 4] and stimulat-
ing conversation for brand building and improved ser-
vice delivery [4, 5]. In fact, social media may have
effects on both patients, and on the wider healthcare
system [6]. In particular, it allows patients to receive
support [1], and to complement offline information
[2], which may lead to enhancing the empowerment
of patients [6]. However, social media use by patients
does not only provide beneficial effects. It may also
constitute a challenge within the healthcare system to
both patients and healthcare professionals. Since every-
body with access to social media can post “advice” on how
to deal with a certain health condition, it is important
to create reliable online communication channels to
prevent health problems being exacerbated [7]. For ex-
ample, one misguided idea on Twitter urged Nigerians to
drink excessive amounts of salt water to combat Ebola.
However, this may have led to two deaths and more than
12 admissions to hospital [7]. Thus, many healthcare
professionals fear that social media use by patients
for health related purposes often spreads misinforma-
tion among patients [1].
Use of social media by patients for health related rea-
sons provides different effects, which can result in both
benefits and challenges. It is important to identify these
effects of social media for the healthcare system, as “a
growing percentage of patients use social media for
health-related reasons, so health professionals will have
to reflect on the alleged beneficial effects and the po-
tential harmful effects of social media use by patients in
healthcare” [8]. Hence, the review of these effects will
contribute to a better understanding of potential ben-
efits and challenges for both patients and healthcare
professionals, but also other healthcare actors such as
policy makers.
Therefore, this paper provides a systematic literature
review of empirical studies on the effects of social media
use by patients for health related reasons on patients and
on their relationships with healthcare professionals. To
our knowledge no other systematic research on this topic
has been performed to date. Such review also provides the
opportunity to extract general findings from the studies.
Subsequently, healthcare professionals can learn from
these findings about the effects of social media use by
patients and share this knowledge with other patients and
use it to their own advantage. We aim to answer the
following question:
According to recent empirical research, what are the
effects of social media use by patients for health
related reasons on patients and on their relationships
with healthcare professionals?
To answer this question, the paper will address the
following: (1) the types of social media use by patients (2)
the identified effects of social media use by patient
on patients (3) the identified effects on the relationship
between patients and their healthcare professionals and
(4) the relationship between the effects on patients and
healthcare professionals. By addressing the issue (4), we
attempt to bring together our findings from the issues (2)
and (3) and explore linking mechanisms between the ef-
fects patients experience and their subsequent link to the
effects they experience in relationship with the healthcare
professionals.
Study aim and terminology
The aim of this paper is to gain insights in the benefits and
challenges of the effects of social media use by patients
within the healthcare system and especially the effects on
patients and on their relationships with healthcare profes-
sionals. The effects we focus on in this paper can be both
causal and reciprocal, but always start with the use of social
media by patients.
Despite the popularity of social media, there is a confu-
sion about what is exactly meant by the term social media.
Therefore, in this paper we use the definition provided in
the highly cited paper by Kaplan and Haenlein [9]. They
describe social media as “a group of Internet-based appli-
cations that build on the ideological and technological
foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and
exchange of User Generated Content”. The internet-based
applications refer to the different categories of social
media, which are blogs, content communities, social net-
working sites, collaborative projects, virtual game worlds
and virtual social worlds. These types of social media are
accessible to users to utilize for, among other things,
health related reasons.
The term “users of social media in healthcare” in this
paper refer to the patients and their family members.
Patients are treated as any person who self-proclaims
to be suffering from a certain condition, whether officially
diagnosed by a healthcare professional or not. We define
healthcare professionals as those who study, advise on or
provide preventive, curative, rehabilitative and promo-
tional health services based on an extensive body of theor-
etical and factual knowledge in diagnosis and treatment of
conditions and other health problems [10].

 Methods
In order to provide an overview of the different effects
of social media use by patients for health related reasons
on patients and on their relationships with healthcare
professionals, we conducted systematic literature review.
To identify the articles, we employed a search strategy
consisting of three terms as follows
a) “social media” or blog* or “content communit*” or
“social networking site*” or “online social network*” or
“virtual world*” or “online communit*” or “online forum*”
or Facebook or Twitter or Wikipedia or IMVU or “second
life” or YouTube b) “Patient*” and c) “health* provider*”
or “health* professional*” or “physician*” or “doctor*” or
“hospital*”. The full search string is also included in the
Appendix A (see Additional file 1). Additionally, as sug-
gested by the referees of this paper, we also used the term
“client*” instead of “patient*”, together with the other two
original categories of terms.
To perform this literature review, we followed the guide-
lines on conducting a systematic literature review as pre-
scribed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Literature Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [11].
To conduct the search, we chose relevant databases of
Web of Science and EBSCOhost COMPLETE. By focus-
ing on EBSCOhostCOMPLETE, we made sure that the
healthcare databases are included such as “PsycINFO”,
“CINAHL” and “MEDLINE”. We also included the data-
bases such “Business source premier” to include findings
with a business perspective. Search options were slightly
different for each database. For EBSCO the irrelevant
databases were excluded first and no specific search field
was selected for one of the three terms. The list of data-
bases is presented in the Appendix B (See Additional file 2).
Additionally, the option to search only in scholarly
(peer reviewed) journals was used and the publication
dates were selected to be after 2004. In the year 2004 the
term Web 2.0 was used for the first time, which marks the
start of the social media era [9]. On the other hand, we se-
lected topic for all three terms in the Web of Science,
which included the titles, abstracts, author keywords, and
keywords plus fields of the articles.
Selection criteria
For an article to be included in the study it had to meet
several selection criteria as follows: (1) published in a
peer-reviewed journal, (2) written in English, (3) full text
available to the researcher, (4) contain primary empirical
data, (5) the users of social media are patients, (6) the ef-
fects of patients using social media are clearly stated, (7)
satisfy established quality criteria. The articles were
assessed on their quality by using the standard quality
assessment criteria as identified by [12].
Prior to final screening and selection of the papers,
first and second author agreed to independently read
100 abstracts and select the articles that would be included
in the study based on the selection criteria. Afterwards, the
selected articles by the two authors were compared and
there was complete concurrence on the category “yes, this
one will be included”. For some of the articles that were
marked as “maybe”, first and second author had a brief dis-
cussion to reach a consensus. This helped to reach higher
reliability for the inclusion of the articles. Further in the
process, the second author consulted the first author
whenever there was a doubt whether to include or ex-
clude the article. In addition, regular meetings with the
third author also contributed to the overall process of
the selection.
Data analysis
The resulting papers were characterized by the research
aim and the type of research, which is reflected in the
Table 1. The papers were further categorized according
to the focus of the research question and data. Each pa-
per’s empirical findings were categorized by looking at
data and making first notes inductively. Following this,
we looked at our notes on topics that emerged from
analysed articles and compared them to earlier literature.
In this way, concepts from prior literature helped us to
make the sense of data from different articles and
categorize them. A good example for that is the concept
of social support, which we used to classify types of use.
After analysing the articles in this way, we formulated
propositions in the discussion section.
Results
Search results
The searches were carried out in the period ending
on March 17th, 2015. The application of the search
strategy to the two search engines resulted initially in
a total of 1,743 articles. Within the 1,743 articles
many duplicates were found as well within the search
engines as between the search engines. By removing
duplicates the first found article was kept. In this way, we
identified and removed 468 duplicates leaving us with
1,275 articles.
The remaining 1,275 articles were screened on title and
abstract with regards to the selection criteria. Whenever
we had doubts if an article is relevant or when title and
abstract were not clear, we inspected the paper in more
details by accessing full article. An article was removed
when, for example, it became clear that the user of social
media was not a patient but another user, like the hospital,
a regular “healthy” person or healthcare professional. Add-
itionally, several articles referred to internet use by pa-
tients for health related reasons and their effects, but did
not specify the effects of social media. Therefore, such ar-
ticles were removed. Moreover, articles that were written
in a language other than English as well as articles that did

 not comprise primary data or did not elaborate on an ef-
fect of patients using social media. This left us with 22 ar-
ticles that met our criteria. In addition, as a result of the
referees’ suggestion to include term “client”, we identified
one additional article, making the entire list of 23 articles
for the quality assessment.
Quality of the articles was assessed by using the Stand-
ard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary
Research Papers by [12] as presented in the Appendix C
(See Additional file 3). This assessment tool distin-
guishes between qualitative and quantitative research
and provides different quality assessment criteria for
each type of research. The criteria are rated on their
presence in the respective article and are either com-
pletely addressed in the article (resulting in 2 points),
partly addressed (resulting in 1 point), or not addressed
(resulting in 0 points). In case an article scored below
the threshold of a 50 % score of the total amount of
points possible, the article is assumed to be of low qual-
ity and removed from this paper. This cut-off point for
inclusion is relatively liberal according to the authors of
the assessment tool [12]. One article had a quality score
below the 50 % cut-point and was excluded, which left
us with the total of 22 articles for analysis.
The article selection process is shown in Fig. 1.
Overview of the articles
The Table 1 provides an overview of 22 articles in-
cluded in the study. All studies except for three were
published in or after 2010. Moreover, 19 articles were
published in journals that are related to the medical
field, whereas only three articles are published in
journal that do not have a specific connection to medicine:
Journal of Sociology, New Review of Hypermedia &
Multimedia, and Information Research. Only two out
of the 22 articles use a theory or a model to build
their research on, namely the concept of masculinity
[13] and the actant model [14]. The group of articles
consists of nine quantitative, seven qualitative and six
mixed methods studies.
The analysis of articles with regard to the type of social
media and conditions is presented in the Appendix D
(See Additional file 4), which shows that the 12 articles
studied online support communities and most focused on

and conditions were spread among the remaining articles.
Analysis of results
This section presents findings from 22 articles we included
in our study. First of all, an overview of the extracted find-
ings is presented regarding the types of social media use by
patients. Following this, we present the effects of social
media use on patients. Subsequently, an overview of
the extracted findings regarding effects of social media
use by patients on the relationship between patients
and healthcare professionals are presented, discussed,
and categorized.
Types of social media use by patients for health related
reasons
Our analysis starts with the type of use and motivation
for their use of social media. When analysing all articles
it becomes clear that patients do not use social media to
circumvent healthcare professionals, but rather use it as
a complement to healthcare professional services to fulfil
the patients’ needs that cannot be met by the healthcare
professional. The relationship between patients and health-
care professionals is viewed by the patients as a more clin-
ical one, where healthcare professionals provide expert
knowledge about the condition and recommend treatment
based on their medical knowledge, but not on their first-
hand experience [15].
Additionally, doctors often have difficulty expressing
empathy and that they filter information for the patient,
where the patient would rather be informed about all
options. Patients also believe that doctors might not be
aware of the latest breakthroughs [15]. Moreover, one of
the the main reasons for patients to join online health
communities is their dissatisfaction with their healthcare
professional’s inability to meet the patients’ emotional
and informational needs [1]. Another reason for patients
to use social media was to bridge the gap between trad-
itional health information about their condition and
everyday life [16]. In particular, Facebook is seen as an

 important addition to traditional in-office counselling in
improving patient knowledge [17].
Therefore, the types of social media use by patients as
identified in this paper refer to the way in which patients
use social media intended to meet an unfulfilled need.
These are identified in the articles are categorized as shown
in Table 2 and explained below. Categories represent social
support, consisting of emotional, esteem, informational,
and network support [18], and other types of use, which
are emotional expression and social comparison.
Social support The most common type of social media
use by patients for health related reasons that we found
is social support. Social support is defined as “the
process of interaction in relationships which is intended
to improve coping, esteem, belonging, and competence
through actual or perceived exchanges of psychosocial
resources” [19]. Social support is represented through
five different categories and four of these categories were
found to be common types of social media use by pa-
tients for health related purposes [18]. These four types,
namely emotional support, esteem support, information
support, and network support are explained below.
Emotional support. Emotional support is defined as
“communication that meets an individual’s emotional or
affective needs” [20]. It refers to support gained through
expressions of care and concern, which serve to improve
an individual’s mood. Emotional support helps patients
to meet their emotional or affective needs. The use of
social media by patients for emotional support was iden-
tified in 13 articles. Examples of emotional support are
“sharing of emotional difficulties” [21], “encountering
support that feels like a warm blanket wrapped around
you” [22], and “share emotions with other people who
are coping with similar problems” [23].
Esteem support. Esteem support refers to “communica-
tion that bolsters an individual’s self-esteem or beliefs in
their ability to handle a problem or perform a needed
task” [20]. The aim of this type of support is to encour-
age individuals to take the actions needed to successfully
live with their condition. The use of social media by pa-
tients for esteem support was identified in seven articles.
Examples of esteem support include “getting support
from other patient’s encouragement” [24], “share experi-
ences about a new treatment to find encouragement be-
fore starting it” [25], and “rituals of confirming each
other’s endeavours to follow health instructions” [14].
Information support. Information support is “commu-
nication that provides useful or needed information”
[20]. In particular, newly diagnosed patients are in a
need for a lot of information about their condition and
treatment options, which can be provided by patients
who have already dealt with the condition for a longer
period [20]. The use of social media by patients for in-
formation support was identified in all articles. Examples
of information support are “receiving advice about treat-
ments” [26], “help fellow sufferers by sharing experiences
and relevant information about the disease” [24], and
“ask questions about the condition” [25].
Network support. Network support is defined as “com-
munication that affirms an individual’s belonging to a
network or reminds him/her of support available from
the network” [20]. Hence, network support is support
that reminds people that no matter what situation they
are facing, they are not alone. The use of social media by
patients for network support was identified in 13 articles.
Examples of network support include “meeting other
patients who had gone through similar experiences” [27],
“a means to connect with others in similar situations”
[15], and “fostering relationships based on shared attri-
butes” [28].
Other types of use In addition to the social support, we
also identified two other types of use, which could not
be directly placed under one of the subcategories of so-
cial support. These are emotional expression and social
comparison.
Emotional expression. Emotional expression refers to
the unique opportunity provided by social media for pa-
tients (and other users) to express their emotions freely
without having to be concerned about the immediate
feelings or reactions of those who stand close to them.
As noted in one of the articles, “online communities
provide the potential to allow patients to open up and
reduce the inhibitions felt in sharing experiences in face
to face situations”, e.g. hurting other people’s feelings
[13]. Therefore, patients can use social media as a place
to express their emotions freely, like, releasing negative
emotions [24]. In contrast to emotional support, which
is defined as patients interacting in and receiving com-
munication to meet their affective needs, emotional ex-
pression refers to patients expressing their emotions
regardless of whether someone will respond. The use of
social media by patients for emotional expression was
identified in 8 articles. Examples include “a place to vent
about the illness” [25] and “an outlet for expressing your
emotions freely” [15].

 Social comparison. Patients use social media to compare
themselves with other patients to see how “bad” their con-
dition is or to find out how the treatments work. This so-
cial comparison can seem to overlap with social support,
for instance, when patients compare themselves to peers
to recognize that they are not the only person in this situ-
ation (network support) or when patients compare them-
selves to peers to find out how other people suffer from or
cope with the condition (esteem support, emotional sup-
port, or information support). However, social comparison
was categorized separately as within the articles the au-
thors presented it as a different type of use without speci-
fying the details. The use of social media by patients for
social comparison was identified in four articles. Examples
include “upward social comparison” [25] and “comparison
with other members [23].
Effects of the different types of social media use by patients
on patients
In this section the effects of the use of social media by
patients for health related reasons are analysed and pre-
sented. The most common effect of patients using social
media for health related reasons is patient empower-
ment, which is represented through three categories: en-
hanced subjective well-being, enhanced psychological
well-being, and improved self-management and control.
We also identified four other types of effects, which are
less common in our literature review. These are: dimin-
ished subjective well-being, loss of privacy, addiction to
social media, and being targeted for promotion. Identified
categories are presented in Table 3 and explained below.
Patient empowerment In current literature, the con-
cept of empowerment is defined as “an individual trait,
characterized by an emphasis on increased individual
control over the aspects of one’s life” [29]. We argue that
the patient empowerment refers to “the discovery and
development of one’s inherent capacity to be responsible
for one’s own life. Hence, patients are empowered when
they are in possession of the knowledge, skills, and self-
awareness necessary to identify and attain their own
goals” [14]. Information support, esteem support, and
emotional support were significant predictors of a patient’s
sense of empowerment [30]. Informational support was
the strongest predictor of increased sense of empowerment
followed by esteem support and emotional support. The
three subcategories of empowerment, namely enhanced
subjective well-being, enhanced psychological well-being,
and improved self-management and control, are discussed
below.
Enhanced subjective well-being. Subjective well-being
refers to “what people think and how they feel about
their lives in positive ways” [31]. In this paper, enhanced
subjective well-being mainly refers to the pleasant emo-
tions patients experience due to their social media use
for health related reasons. “People experience enhanced
subjective well-being when they feel many pleasant and
few unpleasant emotions” [31]. Consequently, enhanced
subjective well-being refers to an increase in the experi-
ence of pleasant emotions, which in turn heightens peo-
ple’s feeling of empowerment. The effect enhanced
subjective well-being was identified in 12 articles. Exam-
ples from the articles concerning enhanced subjective
well-being are “increased optimism” [22], “increased ac-
ceptance of the illness” [23], “decrease anxiety” [26] and
“increased sense of normalcy” [27].
Enhanced psychological well-being. Psychological well-
being is defined in the literature as “focusing on eudemonic
well-being, which is the fulfilment of human potential and
a meaningful life” [32]. One of the components affecting
psychological well-being is the experience of positive rela-
tions with others. It is argued that a central component of
mental health is to be in warm, trusting, interpersonal rela-
tions [33]. Moreover, “self-actualizers are described as hav-
ing strong feelings of empathy and affection for all human
beings and as being capable of greater love, deeper friend-
ship, and more complete identification with others” [33].
Therefore, enhanced psychological well-being refers to an
increase in the patient’s experience of positive relations
with others through the use social media. The effect en-
hanced psychological well-being was identified in 14 arti-
cles. Examples from the articles include “feeling of being
connected to other people” [34], “increased social network
online as well as offline” [27], and “promotion of deep rela-
tionships” [15].
Improved self-management and control. Improved self-
management and sense of control refers to the improve-
ment in the capability of patients to better handle their
condition. As patients feel better informed, their ability to
make decisions on their own improves, which fosters self-
management and perceived control over the condition.

 Ability to deal with the day-to-day life with the con-
dition also increases, for example due to learning
about coping strategies, which also fosters improved
self-management and perceived control. The effect of
improved self-management and sense of control was
identified in 14 articles. Examples from the articles
include “increase patient’s self-management” [34], “im-
provement in the ability to manage the disease” [16],
and “fostering insight and universality” [26].
Other types of effects In addition to the patient em-
powerment, several other types of effects of social media
use by patients on patients were identified. These are di-
minished subjective well-being, loss of privacy, being tar-
geted for promotion, and addiction to social media.
Diminished subjective well-being. Diminished subjective
well-being is opposite of enhanced subjective well-being
and indicates an increase in the experience of negative
emotions due to the use of social media, such as an in-
crease in feelings of worry and anxiety. It was identified in
six articles. Diminished subjective well-being was the most
common found effect of patients using social media for
health related reasons. Examples include “demoralization”
[25], “hurt feelings due to negative feedback” [16], and
“increased feelings of anxiety” [35].
Loss of privacy. Loss of privacy was mentioned in only
one article [16]. It refers to the finding that the patients
lose their privacy when they post personal videos on
YouTube.
Being targeted for promotion. Being targeted for pro-
motion was also mentioned in only one article by [16]. It
refers to the finding that patients who post videos on
YouTube can be targets product promotions.
Addiction to social media. Addiction was an effect
identified in one article by [35]. It refers to the finding
that sometimes patients experience their social media
use for health related reasons to be addictive. As
such, it often took the time that they usually spent
doing other tasks.
Effects of social media use by patients on the relationship
between patients and healthcare professionals
The use of social media by patients for health related
reasons does not only affect the patients themselves or
other patients, but also the relationship between patients
and healthcare professionals. In total, nine articles dis-
cussed the effects of social media use by patients on the
relationship between patients and healthcare profes-
sionals, although six out of these nine articles only touch
very briefly upon this subject. The effects of social media
use by patients for health related reasons on the rela-
tionship between patients and healthcare professionals
that have been extracted from the articles are presented
in Table 4 and discussed below.
The findings presented in Table 4 are divided into
categories representing the effects on the relationship
between patients and healthcare professionals. These
categories are more equal communication between the
patient and healthcare professional, increased switching of
doctors, harmonious relationships, and suboptimal inter-
action between the patient and healthcare professional.
The categories are discussed below.
More equal communication between the patient and
healthcare professional Social media use by patients for
health related reasons can lead to more equal communica-
tion between the patient and healthcare professional. This
effect refers to patients feeling more confident in their re-
lationship with the healthcare professional. In total, five
articles referred to this effect. With the information from
the social media platforms, patients can increase their
knowledge about treatment options. Consequently, they
are better able to communicate with the healthcare pro-
fessional as they can better understand their condition
[36]. Hence, patients may feel more confident in their re-
lationship with their physician [22, 23]. Patients feel that
they are better prepared for consultations as they are more
informed about their condition and know better what
questions to ask [23]. Social support received through the
use of social media eventually increases the likeliness to
form an intention to actively communicate with the
doctor during a medical consultation [30]. Moreover,
the use of social media provides the opportunity to
learn and increase health communication, which may lead
to an increase in the patients’ willingness to seek medical
attention [37]. Hence, these findings suggest that the use
of social media for health related purposes can increase a
patient’s confidence and active communication in their re-
lationship with healthcare.
Increased switching of doctors Social media use by pa-
tients for health related reasons can lead to shorter rela-
tionships between healthcare professionals and patients.
Patients may change doctor due to online discussions
about physicians or due to negative reactions from doc-
tors about the patients’ treatments supervised by their
regular physicians. Two articles found that patients chan-
ged physician because of those patients’ use of social
media. For example, negative reactions from physicians to

 the mentions of social media use by patients made the pa-
tients to look for second opinion and even change their
doctor [1]. On the other hand, some patients changed
their doctor as a result of online discussion with other
patients [36].
Harmonious relationships Harmonious relationships
between healthcare professionals and patients can be
established as social media provide a place for patients
to release negative emotions. However, the effect of har-
monious relationships also comprises the fact that social
media might empower individuals to follow doctor’s rec-
ommendations, which reduces discussions during clin-
ical interaction. The effect of harmonious relationships
was identified in two articles. Social media provide a
place for patients to express their emotions and main-
tain harmony in the relationship between healthcare
professional and patient in offline consultations, which
focuses on non-emotional aspects of the disease [24].
On the other hand, social media were empowering indi-
vidual users to comply with doctors’ recommendations
as a group, which affects the healthcare professional
patient relationship by potentially reducing discussions
during clinical interactions as patients stick to the recom-
mended treatment [14]. However, it can also be viewed as
a missed opportunity, as patients do not empower each
other to find alternative treatments [14].
Suboptimal
interaction
between
the
patient
and
healthcare professional As patients use social media
for health related reasons, this can affect the patient and
healthcare professional relationship by leading to sub-
optimal interaction between the patient and healthcare
professional. When patients bring social media content
to the consultation, this can lead to increased processes
of sorting information, transforming the potential risk to
the healthcare professional, and challenging the health-
care professional’s expertise [13]. Additionally, if the
healthcare professional reacts negatively to what patient
learned from social media, this might decrease the pa-
tient’s subjective well-being [1]. The effect of suboptimal
interaction between the patient and healthcare profes-
sional was identified in two articles. Discussion of the in-
formation from social media during the consultation
was experienced as a threat by the physician [13]. Fur-
thermore, healthcare professionals reacted negatively to
online health community content raised during clinical
interactions, which made patients feel disempowered,
but it did not change their online behaviour [1].
Relationship between effects on patients and effects on the
patient healthcare professional relationship
In the section about the effect of “more equal communi-
cation between the patient and healthcare professional”,
we already mentioned that increased communication
during a consultation on behalf of the patient can be
caused by patient empowerment. Patient empowerment
refers to “the inherent capacity to be responsible for
one’s own life” [14]. In regards to the relationship be-
tween patients and healthcare professionals, the patients
took more responsibility for their own condition. Five
articles find that the patient empowerment indeed af-
fects the patients’ confidence, ability and willingness to
actively participate in clinical interactions. Patients in-
creased their sense of empowerment through their
intention to actively communicate with the doctor [30].
Additionally, the patient empowerment was associated
with an increased confidence in dealing with the phys-
ician [23]. Moreover, the convenience of social media
use by patients is that it reduces the information gap be-
tween healthcare professionals and patients and patients
have a better understanding of the healthcare profes-
sional during consultations [37]. Social media can em-
power patients by giving them access to information and
opportunities for discussions, which increases the pa-
tient’s involvement in clinical interactions [15]. Finally,
the patient empowerment increases the ability of pa-
tients to communicate with the healthcare professionals
[22]. Hence, we argue that the patient empowerment
contributes to more equal communication between the
patient and the healthcare professional.
Discussion
This review provides an insight into the current body of
knowledge on the effects of social media use by patients
for health related reasons and the effects on patients and
on their relationship with healthcare professionals. All of
the studies were published in the past 10 years, with
only three articles published before 2010. This can be
explained by a recent increase in the use of social media
by patients for health related reasons.
We categorized articles into different types of use and
effects. We identified that the most common type of use
was social support, namely emotional support, esteem
support, information support, and network support. The
types of social media use were most often found to affect
patients by empowering them through enhanced sub-
jective well-being, enhanced psychological well-being,
and improved self-management and control. However, the
types of social media use by patients were also found to
affect patients through addiction to social media, dimin-
ished subjective well-being, being targeted for promotion,
and loss of privacy. Moreover, the identified types of social
media use by patients for health related reasons was also
found to affect the relationship between patients and
healthcare professionals as it can result in more equal
communication between the patient and healthcare pro-
fessional, shorter relationships, harmonious relationships,
Smailhodzic et al. BMC Health Services Research  (2016) 16:442

 and suboptimal interaction between the patient and
healthcare professional. Based on these findings, we made
three propositions.
Relationship between use and effect: Network support
and enhanced psychological well-being
When patients are diagnosed with a certain condition
that nobody in their close (offline) network has experi-
enced before, patients can feel very lonely [27]. As a dia-
betic patient states “I literally felt like the only diabetic
on the planet” [16]. However, social media provide an
opportunity to easily connect with others and reduce
this feeling of loneliness. Consequently, patients using
social media for network support enhanced their psy-
chological well-being. For example, social media provide
means to connect with others in similar situations and
this can break a patient’s loneliness [15]. This is in line
with earlier studies that have shown how the existence
of network support contributes to a better well-being of
the patients [41, 42]. Interestingly, [41] suggest that the
network support may not only benefit the patients them-
selves, but also their families who care for them. Yet, the
relationship between the network support and psycho-
logical well-being may depend on the level of self-esteem.
For example, college students with low self-esteem prof-
ited more from online social networking sites for bridging
social capital and starting relationships than college stu-
dents with high self-esteem [43]. In line with that, social
networking sites provides the unique opportunity for pa-
tients to be able to talk about the sensitive aspects of the
condition, as online communities provide the potential to
reduce inhibitions felt in sharing experiences face to face
[13]. Such an inhibition could reflect low self-esteem in
terms of a reluctance to talk about the condition in face to
face conversations.
Proposition 1: Social media use by patients for network
support leads to enhanced psychological well-being. This
effect is stronger for people with low self-esteem than for
the people with high self-esteem.
Relationship between content and effect: Reading other
people’s stories, improved self-management and control
and enhanced subjective well-being
Not all patients that make use of social media use it ac-
tively. Sometimes patients only use social media to read
about other people’s stories, without actively contribut-
ing themselves. These people are called lurkers. The
lurking behaviour may be related to the level of privacy
concerns and computer anxiety [44]. In particular, anx-
iety leads to increase in lurking. Two articles in our sam-
ple were focused on the effects of patients using social
media merely by reading other people’s stories. From the
two articles, it becomes clear that the effects experienced
by reading other people’s stories are being better informed
[22, 26]. Additionally, by reading other people’s stories
anxiety was found to significantly decrease [26]. Conse-
quently, these findings suggest that reading other people’s
stories on social media can lead to enhanced subjective
well-being and improved self-management and control.
However, [22] and [26] do not elaborate on the content of
the stories read. Contrasting findings were found in other
articles regarding how content affects the effects of read-
ing other people’s stories. For example, cancer patients
who read other people’s stories enhanced their subjective
well-being [24]. Reading about success stories was found
to enhance confidence to fight the condition, whereas
reading about bad experiences prepared the patient men-
tally for difficult times ahead. On the other hand, the pa-
tients suffering from an inflammatory bowel disease who
read other people’s stories about a bad experience suffered
from diminished subjective well-being [25]. This is in line
with earlier findings showing that the lack of sharing and
feedback on this sharing may threaten the need for be-
longing [45]. Finally, patients suffering from infertility ex-
perienced diminished subjective well-being as the result of
reading other people’s stories [35]. Reading stories about
successful pregnancies led to increased feelings of jeal-
ousy, pain and a sense of alienation, whereas reading
about bad experiences led to increased feelings of worry,
anxiety and decreased optimism. Thus, this may lead to
diminished subjective well-being. On the other hand, one
study in our sample shows that this actually may enhance
subjective-well-being [24]. In particular, this paper focused
on blogs whereas other studies focused on online support
groups [24]. Among other uses, blogs can be used as per-
sonals diaries to express thoughts, feelings, and stories [9].
Level of distress actually decreases when people blog
about their emotional difficulties [46].
Proposition 2: Reading other people’s stories about a
negative experience leads to diminished subjective well-
being. This effect is weaker for patients who blog about
their experiences than for those who do not.
Relationship between patients and healthcare
professionals: shift in power balance and increased
quality of decision making
The effects of social media use by patients for health re-
lated reasons show that social media use by patients can
lead to patient empowerment. Patient empowerment is
an established concept in the medical research and has
been promoted to foster patient autonomy [47]. As a re-
sult of the patient empowerment, patients may increas-
ingly interact with their healthcare professional and get
more involved in the decision making process [15]. In
this case, social media can be seen as a “new” technology
adopted by patients, which may shift the power balance
between the healthcare professional and the patient.
The use of new technologies in healthcare has been
Smailhodzic et al. BMC Health Services Research  (2016) 16:442 
Page 11 of 14
 suggested as a way to empower end-consumers by enab-
ling speed and convenience in accessing health related in-
formation [48]. In this line, the patients are able to actively
participate in the interactions with healthcare professionals.
On the other hand, the healthcare professionals may ex-
perience a decrease in power in the decision making
process. According to the political variant of the inter-
action theory [49], “a product of the interaction of system
features with the intra-organizational distribution of power,
defined either objectively, in terms of horizontal or vertical
power dimensions, or subjectively, in terms of symbolism
can be resistance to the system”. Hence, redistribution of
power between patients and healthcare professionals may
cause the resistance from healthcare professionals. Yet, the
role of health professionals has to change because embra-
cing patient empowerment in healthcare means making a
change, which sometimes seem difficult due to traditional
approach, which is embedded in their current training [50].
However, increased patient involvement in the clinical
interaction could potentially increase the risk placed on
the healthcare professionals [13]. Healthcare professional
may not be in complete control of the information used
during decision making as the patient also has a voice,
but the healthcare professional bears full responsibility
for the decision taken. When patients bring in the in-
formation from social media to the consultation, this
could lead to unnecessary processes of sorting rele-
vant information from irrelevant information and can
be experienced as challenging the healthcare profes-
sional’s expertise [1, 13]. Hence, based on these find-
ings it is possible for healthcare professionals to resist
this shift in the balance of power. However, increased
equalization of the healthcare professional and patient
communication can be a positive and desired effect.
In particular, healthcare professionals may become
more patient-centred, thus complementing the patient
empowerment [51]. As a consequence of patient em-
powerment, we propose that the quality of clinical deci-
sion making may be enhanced.
According to the concept of bounded rationality [52],
not all information can be gained on all available treat-
ment options by healthcare professionals, as the human
mind has a limited capacity to process the available in-
formation and often time is limited as well. Hence,
healthcare professionals are unable to know all the infor-
mation regarding treatment options and the newest de-
velopments, which affects their decision making. Thus,
patients can extend this information base of the health-
care professional by specializing themselves in their own
condition. This could provide an opportunity to increase
the quality of the treatment decisions.
Proposition 3: As a result of patient empowerment due
to patients using social media for health related reasons,
the power balance between healthcare professionals and
patients becomes more equalized, leading to increased
quality of clinical decisions making.
Notwithstanding
the
interesting
results
described
above, this research has some limitations which, along
with the three propositions, suggest opportunities for
further research. It is possible that we missed some articles
that could have used different terminology. Consequently,
the results of this paper might not be generalizable for all
social media platforms. For practical reasons, we excluded
non-English papers. Finally, a limitation of every literature
review is that the authors of the included articles will have
had different objectives and used different methods and
means of interpretation in reaching their conclusions. In
this paper, we highlighted the most important findings on
our topic of study and we categorized the key effects of so-
cial media use on patients and on their relationships with
healthcare professionals.
Conclusions
The use of social media by patients for health related
reasons is growing. This systematic literature review
reflects on beneficial and potentially harmful effects
of social media use by patients for health related. The
findings show that patients use social media mainly
for social support, which is represented through infor-
mation support, emotional support, esteem support,
and network support. Other identified types of social
media use by patients have found to be emotional ex-
pression and social comparison. These types of social
media use by patients were found to most commonly
lead to patient empowerment. Other effects of social
media use by patients we identified were diminished
subjective well-being, addiction to social media, being
targeted for promotion, and loss of privacy. The types
of social media use by patients were also found to
affect the healthcare professional and patient relationship
by stimulating more equal communication between the
patient and healthcare professional, shorter relationships,
harmonious relationships, suboptimal interaction between
the patient and healthcare professional. Whereas some of
the articles discussed the effects of patients’ use of social
media on relationship between patients and healthcare
professionals briefly, we encourage future research to
tackle this issue. We developed three propositions, which
may also stimulate further research in this respect.
