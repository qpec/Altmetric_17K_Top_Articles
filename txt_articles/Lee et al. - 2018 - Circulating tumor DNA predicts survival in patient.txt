Background: Patients with high-risk stage II/III resected melanoma commonly develop distant metastases. At present, we
cannot differentiate between patients who will recur or those who are cured by surgery. We investigated if circulating tumor
DNA (ctDNA) can predict relapse and survival in patients with resected melanoma.
Patients and methods: We carried out droplet digital polymerase chain reaction to detect BRAF and NRAS mutations in
plasma taken after surgery from 161 stage II/III high-risk melanoma patients enrolled in the AVAST-M adjuvant trial.
Results: Mutant BRAF or NRAS ctDNA was detected (�1 copy of mutant ctDNA) in 15/132 (11%) BRAF mutant patient samples
and 4/29 (14%) NRAS mutant patient samples. Patients with detectable ctDNA had a decreased disease-free interval [DFI; hazard
ratio (HR) 3.12; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79–5.47; P < 0.0001] and distant metastasis-free interval (DMFI; HR 3.22; 95% CI
1.80–5.79; P < 0.0001) versus those with undetectable ctDNA. Detectable ctDNA remained a significant predictor after
adjustment for performance status and disease stage (DFI: HR 3.26, 95% CI 1.83–5.83, P < 0.0001; DMFI: HR 3.45, 95% CI
1.88–6.34, P < 0.0001). Five-year overall survival rate for patients with detectable ctDNA was 33% (95% CI 14%–55%) versus 65%
(95% CI 56%–72%) for those with undetectable ctDNA. Overall survival was significantly worse for patients with detectable
ctDNA (HR 2.63; 95% CI 1.40–4.96); P ¼ 0.003) and remained significant after adjustment for performance status (HR 2.50, 95% CI
1.32–4.74, P ¼ 0.005).
Conclusion: ctDNA predicts for relapse and survival in high-risk resected melanoma and could aid selection of patients for
adjuvant therapy.

Introduction
Many patients with loco-regional melanoma will subsequently
develop distant metastases; however, current predictors of relapse
are relatively crude. Currently, American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) staging of loco-regional melanoma at the time of
surgery is used to identify different risk groups and can inform
decisions on intensity of follow-up, potential adjuvant therapy and
inclusion in clinical trials. However, there are significant limita-
tions because staging is based on a single snapshot of anatomical or
histological features and then used as a surrogate for the biological
behavior of the tumor over time. Patients are divided into broad
prognostic groups without sufficient information to accurately
predict the likely outcome on an individual patient basis. This is
particularly relevant in light of the recent approval of adjuvant ipi-
limumab in melanoma. Ipilimumab (10 mg/kg) was associated
with 11% improvement in overall survival (OS) at 5 years, from
54.4% to 65.4%, but at the expense of grade 3/4 toxicity in >54%
of patients, including five (1.1%) treatment-related deaths [1].

 This is in a patient population that is potentially cured by surgery
alone.
It is, therefore, important to develop tools that can accurately
identify patients who are at highest risk of progression to stage IV
disease. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA, the tumor-derived
fraction of circulating free DNA or cfDNA) is emerging as a use-
ful measure of tumor burden and prognostic marker in stage IV
melanoma [2, 3]. This study aims to determine whether having
detectable ctDNA within 12 weeks of surgery carried out with
curative intent for high-risk stage II/III disease was associated
with worse survival in a subgroup of patients whose tumors were
known to have either a BRAF or NRAS mutation.
Methods
Study design
Samples were collected as part of the AVAST-M trial (ISRCTN
81261306), which compared bevacizumab versus placebo in 1343
patients with resected high-risk stage II/III melanoma [4]. This study
reported a difference in disease-free interval (DFI) between trial arms
[hazard ratio (HR) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70–0.98,
P ¼ 0.03] but no impact on distant metastasis-free interval (DMFI) or OS
[4]. Patients with a confirmed BRAF or NRAS mutation were randomly
selected from both arms of AVAST-M. Work was carried out in accord-
ance with the Declaration of Helsinki (supplementary Methods, available
at Annals of Oncology online).
Sample size
In this retrospective analysis, 150 patients were determined to provide
80% power to detect a HR of at least 3.5 between patients with undetect-
able and detectable ctDNA for DFI with a 5% significance level, assuming
a 10% marker prevalence and an event rate of 40%.
Analysis of ctDNA
Mutational status was determined using several different methods
including pyro-sequencing of formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue
from the resected primary lesion or involved lymph node, or both where
available. Discordant results were repeated in triplicate to provide a con-
sensus result. Baseline plasma samples were taken within 12 weeks
(median 8.3 weeks from surgery to blood draw; range 2.4–12 weeks) of
surgical clearance for stage IIB, IIC or III melanoma. cfDNA was isolated
from up to 2 ml of plasma (individual patient details in supplementary
Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online) using QIAamp
Circulating Nucleic Acid kits according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) car-
ried
out
using
a
QX200
ddPCR
system
(Bio-Rad,
details
in
supplementary Methods, available at Annals of Oncology online). ctDNA
was defined as detectable if there was �1 copy of mutant DNA detected.
Statistical analysis
The baseline ctDNA result (undetectable/detectable) was compared
against patient and tumor characteristics [age, gender, AJCC stage, nodal
classification, primary melanoma Breslow and ulceration, as well as
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS)]
collected at the time of trial entry using Wilcoxon rank sum test for con-
tinuous factors and a chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test with small
number for categorical factors. A stepwise logistic regression model was
used to identify the independent factors for predicting detectable ctDNA,
with a P-value of 0.05 for inclusion and exclusion.
DFI, DMFI and OS were calculated from the date of randomization to
the trial until date of first recurrence, date of distant metastases and date of
death, respectively. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to construct sur-
vival curves for differences between DFI, DMFI and OS in patients with
detectable ctDNA levels versus undetectable levels and compared using a
Cox proportional hazards model to obtain HRs and 95% CIs. Baseline
ctDNA (detectable or undetectable) and other factors associated with prog-
nosis (Breslow, ulceration, stage, nodal classification and ECOG PS) were
analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards
regression models for DFI, DMFI and OS. Details regarding internal vali-
dation of ctDNA and performance modeling can be found in supplemen
tary Methods, available at Annals of Oncology online. All analyses were car-
ried out using the SAS statistical package (version 9.4).
Results
Patient demographics and detection of baseline
ctDNA
To evaluate the potential for ctDNA to identify melanoma
patients at high risk of relapse following surgery with curative
intent, we analyzed ctDNA in the plasma from 161 patients carry-
ing either a BRAF or NRAS mutation in their baseline resected
tumor (Table 1 and supplementary Tables S1 and S2, available at
Annals of Oncology online). Patient demographics are presented
in Table 1. Within the cohort, 132 tumors had a p.V600E BRAF
mutation and 29 tumors had a p.Q61L/K NRAS mutation.
CtDNA was detected in 19 (12%) of the plasma samples (10 from
the treatment arm and 9 from the observation arm). Of the 19
positive plasma samples, 15 had a p.V600E BRAF mutation and 4
had a p.Q61L/K NRAS mutation. The Poisson-corrected ctDNA
levels ranged from 1.4 to 1608 copies, with a median of 2.8
(supplementary Tables S1 and S2, available at Annals of Oncology
online).
In univariate analyses of known prognostic factors, only PS
was identified as significantly associated with detectable ctDNA
(P ¼ 0.03) (Table 1). This was confirmed using a multivariate
logistic regression. There was a significantly increased chance of
having positive ctDNA in patients with PS 1 compared with 0
(odds ratio ¼ 3.61; 95% CI 1.20–10.82, P ¼ 0.02).
Patient outcomes
At a median of 5 years, 21% (95% CI 7–41%) of patients with
detectable ctDNA were alive and recurrence free compared with
49% (95% CI 40%–57%) for those with undetectable ctDNA. Of
the four patients who did not recur, one patient had stage II dis-
ease, one patient stage IIIA and two patients had stage IIIB dis-
ease, three patients were on the treatment arm and one patient on
the observation arm. All nine patients with >3 mutant copies
have recurred (one patient had regional lymph nodes metastases;
two patients recurred distantly only and six patients had both
loco-regional recurrence and distant metastases). Fifty-two per-
cent (74/142) of patients with undetectable ctDNA have recurred
(patterns of the relapses/outcomes are presented in supplemen
tary Tables S3 and S4, available at Annals of Oncology online).
Twelve (63%) of the 19 patients with detectable ctDNA are
known to have died compared with 49 (35%) of the 142 patients
without detectable ctDNA.

 Prognostic significance of detectable ctDNA
Median DFI was 0.3 years (95% CI 0.1–1.0) in patients with
detectable ctDNA compared with 4.2 years (95% CI 2.5–limit not
reached) in those where ctDNA was not detected (Figure 1A).
There was no significant interaction between trial arm and the
ctDNA in predicting DFI (P ¼ 0.60) (supplementary Analysis S5,
available at Annals of Oncology online). Patients with detectable
ctDNA had significantly increased risk of recurrence compared
with those with undetectable ctDNA [HR for detectable ctDNA
3.12; 95% CI 1.79–5.47; P < 0.0001; prognostic separation D sta-
tistics (PSDS) ¼ 0.97; standard error (SE) ¼ 0.24; Table 2].
Bootstrapping provided internal validation of ctDNA, with
ctDNA being a significant predictor of DFI in 92% of the boot-
strapped samples (PSDS ¼ 0.99, SE ¼ 0.24). At 1 year, 26% (95%
CI 10%–47%) of the patients with detectable ctDNA were disease
free compared with 74% (95% CI 66%–81%) for patients with
undetectable ctDNA (Table 2). Sensitivity for predicting relapse
was 18% and specificity 95%, with a positive predictive value of
79% and negative predictive value of 51%.
Median DMFI was 0.6 years (95% CI 0.2–2.8) with detectable
ctDNA, but was not reached even with 5-year follow-up (95% CI
5.0–limit not reached) for those with undetectable ctDNA
(Figure 1B). Patients with detectable ctDNA had a significantly
increased risk of distant metastatic recurrence compared with
those with undetectable ctDNA (Table 2, HR 3.22; 95% CI 1.80–
5.79; P < 0.0001, PSDS ¼ 0.99, SE ¼ 0.25). Bootstrapping con-
firmed ctDNA as a significant predictor of DMFI in 92% of sam-
ples (PSDS ¼1.03, SE ¼ 0.26). At 1 year, 37% (95% CI 17%–
57%) of the patients with detectable ctDNA were free of distant
metastases compared with 84% (95% CI 77%–89%) for patients
with undetectable ctDNA (Table 2). Sensitivity for predicting dis-
tant relapse was 20% and specificity 95% with a positive predic-
tive value of 74% and negative predictive value of 61%.
OS was significantly worse for the 19 patients that had detect-
able ctDNA compared with the 142 with undetectable ctDNA
(Table 2, HR 2.63; 95% CI 1.40–4.96; P ¼ 0.003, PSDS ¼ 0.82,
SE ¼ 0.27). Bootstrapping confirmed ctDNA as a significant pre-
dictor of OS in 81% of samples (PSDS ¼ 0.83, SE ¼ 0.26).
Median OS was 2.9 years (95% CI 0.9–limit not reached) with
detectable ctDNA compared with median not reached with 5-
year follow-up for those with undetectable ctDNA (95% CI 6.0–
limit not reached, Figure 1C). At 1 year, 72% (95% CI 46%–88%)
of patients with detectable ctDNA were alive compared with 94%
(95% CI 89%–97%) for patients with undetectable ctDNA
(Table 2). At 5 years, 33% (95% CI 14%–55%) of patients with
detectable ctDNA were alive compared with 65% (95% CI 56%–
72%) for those with undetectable ctDNA. Of note, only 12
patients (none in the ctDNA detectable group) received targeted
or immune therapy on relapse due to limited availability of these
treatments at the time of the study (supplementary Table S3,
available at Annals of Oncology online). Results were similar
within the BRAF and NRAS mutant subgroups for all above
perimeters (data not shown).
Association of prognostic factors and ctDNA on
outcome
In univariate analysis ctDNA (P < 0.0001) was significantly more
predictive of DFI than either PS (P ¼ 0.02) or disease stage
(P ¼ 0.03) (Table 2), and none of the other known prognostic
factors (Breslow, ulceration, nodal classification) were signifi-
cant. Similarly, ctDNA (P � 0.0001) was significantly more pre-
dictive of DMFI than PS (P ¼ 0.01) or disease stage (P ¼ 0.03)
(Table 2). Critically, in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards

 regression model, ctDNA remained a significant predictor for
DFI (HR 3.26, 95% CI 1.83–5.83, P < 0.0001) and DMFI (HR
3.45, 95% CI 1.88–6.34, P < 0.0001) after adjustment for PS and
disease stage (Table 3). For OS, in univariate analyses, ctDNA
(P ¼ 0.003) was significantly more predictive than PS (P ¼ 0.01),
and disease stage was not predictive, nor were other factors asso-
ciated with AJCC staging (Table 2). In multivariate analysis,
ctDNA remained a significant predictor of OS after adjustment
for PS (HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.32–4.74, P ¼ 0.005, Table 3). Finally,
to compare the performance of ctDNA in addition to standard
prognostic factors, we modeled the prognostic ability of variables
associated with AJCC staging (stage, nodal classification, ulcera-
tion, Breslow) and then adjusted for ctDNA (Table 4). When
adjusted for ctDNA, all indices (PSDS, Nagelkerke’s R2,
Calibration shrinkage measure) showed significantly improved
prognostic value for DFI, DMFI and OS (Table 4).
Discussion
In the evolving paradigm of effective adjuvant therapy in mela-
noma, it is essential to develop biomarkers identifying patients at
high risk of relapse. Currently, features of the primary tumor such
as ulceration, Breslow and number of mitoses in addition to nodal
classification and disease stage are standard measures to predict
melanoma progression [5]. Furthermore, gene expression profil-
ing has identified subsets that are associated with a poor outcome
in stages I–III melanoma; however, patient numbers in these stud-
ies were small and have yet to be confirmed in larger cohorts [6, 7].
In this study, we showed that detecting ctDNA in plasma taken
within 12 weeks of curative intent surgery is highly predictive of
relapse in patients with stage II/III melanoma. The majority of
patients with detectable ctDNA relapsed within 1 year of surgery
suggesting that ctDNA in the plasma can reveal occult metastatic
disease that is not evident on radiological imaging. Notably, we
were able to identify melanoma patients at high risk of both distant
metastatic relapse and local recurrence, which is consistent with
studies showing that ctDNA can signal micrometastatic disease
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy postsurgical resection in breast
cancer, and following surgery for stage II colorectal cancer [8, 9].
Critically, our findings were independent of standard staging
indices, demonstrating the value of this approach in melanoma.
It is reported that PS is an independent predictor for DFI, DMFI
and OS in the AVAST-M study population [4]. Although the rea-
sons for this intriguing observation are not known, even when
adjusted for PS in multivariate analysis, ctDNA was significant in
predicting DFI, DMFI and OS. Moreover, in this cohort, AJCC
variables were a poor predictor of relapse, but when we created a
model in which the standard AJCC variables were adjusted for
ctDNA, the performance improved significantly. The test was
specific, but not sensitive and therefore should be seen as an
adjunct to current AJCC staging when discussing risk of relapse
and adjuvant options for the individual patient.
The patients evaluated in this study were treated in an era where
access to immune and targeted therapies was limited. It will be

 important to determine whether outcome can be improved in this
extremely poor prognostic subgroup using targeted and immune
therapies in future clinical trials. In stage IV melanoma, baseline
ctDNA levels in patients treated with both targeted and immune
therapies have been shown to correlate with inferior survival and
disease burden [2, 3]. Taken together, these data show that ctDNA
levels during the course of disease reflect disease biology and are
associated with patient outcome.
A minimally invasive, blood test based on ddPCR, which is
simple, relatively inexpensive and could be carried out within 5
days, is particularly advantageous in the clinical setting especially
when compared with next generation sequencing of tumor mate-
rial, which is time-consuming, costly and requires specialist skills
to perform and analyze. ddPCR is extremely sensitive and can
reach detection sensitivities of approximately 0.01% [10] and we
were able to demonstrate significance with only 2 ml of patient
plasma. Moreover, our proof-of-principle study focused on the
driver mutations BRAF and NRAS, which account for up to 70%
of melanomas, and are well suited to this purpose because of the
low likelihood of clonal diversity with trunk mutations such as
these in melanoma. Furthermore, driver mutations usually have
the highest variant allele frequency, which improves the sensitiv-
ity of the test. To analyze ctDNA in patients without BRAF or
NRAS mutations, next generation sequencing of the primary
tumor/lymphadenectomy can be used to identify the driver/
trunk mutations in individual patients and create bespoke panels.
Critically, the strength of this retrospective study is that it
allows sufficient follow-up to identify the patients who relapsed,
using small amounts of sample. Clearly, prospective studies in
the adjuvant setting will be needed to validate these findings and
examine treatment effect of new agents. Based on the findings of
others [8] and the low sensitivity seen in this assay, it is unlikely
that a single time-point following surgery will identify all patients
who are going to relapse, but we propose that longitudinal sam-
pling will resolve this issue and improve the sensitivity.
Longitudinal sampling has identified treatment relapse before
radiological imaging in stage IV melanoma providing a rationale
for such an approach [3]. Furthermore, longitudinal sampling
will reduce the likelihood of false-positive results. For one of the
patients with detectable ctDNA within 12 weeks who did not
relapse within the follow-up period, subsequent analysis was
found to be negative for ctDNA at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60
months, and therefore confirmatory testing should be mandatory
for this assay to be part of clinical decision-making.
The ability to predict progression to stage IV disease is
extremely important in light of recent findings that immune
checkpoint inhibition improves OS in stage III melanoma [1].
Detection of ctDNA allows identification of a subgroup of
patients at high risk of early relapse and inferior survival, allowing
stratification of patients to adjuvant regimens associated with
higher toxicity but greater potential for efficacy [11]. Taken at a
single time-point following surgery, it can add to AJCC staging in

 informing individual prognosis and therefore discussion regard-
ing risks and benefits of adjuvant therapy, while longitudinal
sampling will likely improve the ability to detect disease progres-
sion before radiological imaging. We advocate that our findings
be confirmed in clinical trials investigating treatment responses
in this population in order to evaluate whether it is also a predic-
tive biomarker for response to immune or targeted therapy.
