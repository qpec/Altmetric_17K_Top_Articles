BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Little is known about opioid prescribing for children without severe 
conditions. We studied the prevalence of and indications for outpatient opioid prescriptions 
and the incidence of opioid-related adverse events in this population.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study between 1999 and 2014 included Tennessee 
Medicaid children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 without major chronic diseases, prolonged 
hospitalization, institutional residence, or evidence of a substance use disorder. We 
estimated the annual prevalence of outpatient opioid prescriptions and incidence of opioid-
related adverse events, defined as an emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death 
related to an opioid adverse effect.
RESULTS: There were 1 362 503 outpatient opioid prescriptions; the annual mean prevalence 
of opioid prescriptions was 15.0%. The most common opioid indications were dental 
procedures (31.1% prescriptions), outpatient procedure and/or surgery (25.1%), trauma 
(18.1%), and infections (16.5%). There were 437 cases of opioid-related adverse events 
confirmed by medical record review; 88.6% were related to the child’s prescription and 
71.2% had no recorded evidence of deviation from the prescribed regimen. The cumulative 
incidence of opioid-related adverse events was 38.3 of 100 000 prescriptions. Adverse 
events increased with age (incidence rate ratio = 2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.67–2.96; 
12–17 vs 2–5 years of age) and higher opioid doses (incidence rate ratio = 1.86 [1.45–2.39]; 
upper versus lower dose tertiles).
CONCLUSIONS: Children without severe conditions enrolled in Tennessee Medicaid frequently 
filled outpatient opioid prescriptions for acute, self-limited conditions. One of every 2611 
study opioid prescriptions was followed by an opioid-related adverse event (71.2% of which 
were related to therapeutic use of the prescribed opioid).

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: The discussion of 
pediatric opioid prescribing has been focused on pain related 
to major chronic diseases, surgical procedures, or other 
severe conditions. Little is known about the prevalence 
and consequences of outpatient opioid prescribing for less 
serious, often self-limited conditions in children.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Outpatient opioid prescribing for 
children in the study was frequent; an estimated 15% received 
a prescription annually. One in every 2611 prescriptions was 
followed by an emergency department visit, hospitalization, 
or death related to an opioid-related adverse effect, most 
commonly related to therapeutic use of the prescribed opioid.

 Although children and adolescents 
˂18 years of age constitute one-
quarter of the US population, the 
controversy regarding opioid 
analgesics1 
– 
3 has been largely 
restricted to adults. However, 
there is limited data on the extent 
to which the well-documented 
secular trend of increased opioid 
prescribing and toxicity has affected 
children. Some studies suggest that 
the marked increase in prescribing 
for adults has also occurred among 
children. In the United States, the 
number of office visits with an opioid 
prescription for patients 15 to 19 
years of age nearly doubled between 
1994 and 2007, 
4 the treatment of 
adolescents for opioid overdose 
has increased, 
5, 
 
6 and the number of 
pediatric hospitalizations attributed 
to opioid poisoning doubled from 
1997 to 2012.7 Authors of other 
studies report that the prevalence of 
opioid use in children has remained 
constant8 or decreased slightly9, 
10 
since 2010. Further information on 
the prevalence of opioid analgesic use 
in children and the reasons for which 
these medications are prescribed in 
this population is needed.
The discussion of opioid analgesics 
in pediatric practice has primarily 
been focused on pain related to 
serious chronic diseases, major 
surgical procedures, or other 
severe conditions.3, 
 
11, 
 
12 A recent 
statement from the Food and 
Drug Administration on refining 
guidelines for opioid use suggested 
that children prescribed these 
drugs had “severe conditions that 
include cancer, multisystem trauma 
and serious chronic diseases such 
as sickle cell anemia.” 
3 However, 
pediatric pain management reviews 
have considered opioids for less 
serious conditions, 
13, 
 
14 such as 
pain occurring after outpatient 
surgical or dental procedures15, 
 
16 
and abdominal pain.17 If children 
frequently take opioids for relatively 
minor conditions for which there 
often are other therapeutic options, 
practitioners need better information 
on the harms of opioid therapy in 
children to make informed risk/
benefit prescribing decisions. 
However, the available data are 
limited to case series of hospitalized 
children or to case reports.18 
– 
20 
Furthermore, the pediatric literature 
has been focused on opioid toxicity 
related to inadvertent overdose, 
21 
unsupervised use, 
22 or substance 
abuse.23 Hence, the incidence of 
adverse opioid effects for children 
during appropriate medical use 
for relatively minor conditions is 
unknown. Indeed, a recent Food 
and Drug Administration advisory 
committee meeting stressed the need 
for data on outcomes in pediatric 
patients and concurred that there 
should be “a balance in providing 
pain control for pediatric populations 
and making this population safe from 
the risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, 
overdose, and death.” 
24, 
 
25
Thus, we conducted a retrospective 
cohort study of the outpatient 
prescribing of opioids in a large 
population of children and 
adolescents 2 to 17 years of age. 
Because our objective was to study 
opioid use for children without 
severe conditions, the cohort 
consisted of children without 
major chronic diseases (cancer or 
sickle cell disease) or other severe 
conditions. Our objectives were to (1) 
describe the prevalence of outpatient 
prescriptions for opioid analgesics, 
(2) characterize the children 
prescribed these medications 
(including the prescription 
indication), and (3) estimate 
the incidence of opioid-related 
adverse events and to determine 
the proportion of these adverse 
events associated with appropriate 
therapeutic use.
METHODS
Study Children
Study data came from the 
Tennessee state Medicaid program, 
which provides both medical 
and dental care for qualifying 
children.26 
– 
28 Medicaid files record 
enrollment, medical encounters, 
filled prescriptions, inpatient 
admissions, outpatient visits, and 
other types of care and are linked to 
computerized death certificates29 and 
an “all payers” hospital discharge 
database.26 These data provided 
an efficient way to define a large 
population of children and identify 
both prescriptions for opioids and 
potential adverse effects.
The study population consisted of 
children and adolescents 2 to 17 
years of age enrolled in Medicaid 
between January 1, 1999, and 
December 31, 2014. To ensure 
adequate information for study 
variables, the children selected 
had to be enrolled for at least 1 
year and have recorded medical 
encounters (including prescriptions) 
during that year (Supplemental 
Table 4). They had no previous 
encounters with diagnoses from 
the International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification, procedures from the 
Current Procedural Terminology, 
Fourth Edition or medication 
prescriptions indicating severe 
underlying conditions (cancer, sickle 
cell anemia, congenital anomalies, 
hospitalization for a total of ˃30 days 
in the preceding year, or history of 
an organ transplant), institutional 
residence, or evidence of a substance 
use disorder (Supplemental Table 4).
Study Prescriptions for Opioid 
Analgesics
The study included outpatient 
prescriptions filled during the study 
period for children who satisfied the 
cohort eligibility criteria on the date 
of the prescription fill (Supplemental 
Table 4). The study opioids 
(Supplemental Table 5) excluded 
parenteral opioids (infrequently 
prescribed for outpatients), 
buprenorphine (primarily used as 
treatment of opioid addiction), and

 preparations specifically formulated 
for cough or diarrhea.
We estimated the dose (milligrams 
per kilograms per day) for each 
opioid prescription. We first 
converted the dispensed dose to 
morphine equivalents (Supplemental 
Table 5)30 and calculated the 
milligrams per day from the 
prescription days of supply. Because 
the Medicaid data do not include 
weight, we used the age- and sex-
specific growth charts from the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (https:// 
www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
growthcharts/ 
html_ 
charts/ 
wtage. 
htm#males) to estimate each child’s 
weight as the median weight for 
the child’s age (in months) on the 
day the prescription was filled. The 
primary analysis included weight-
adjusted doses based on tertiles; the 
respective cutoff points (expressed in 
morphine equivalents per kilogram 
per day) were low tertile (≤0.38 
mg/kg per day), intermediate tertile 
(0.38–0.66 mg/kg per day), and high 
tertile (>0.66 mg/kg per day). We 
also performed sensitivity analyses 
with weight estimates based on the 
upper and lower quartiles of the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention growth charts.
Each prescription’s indication was 
assigned with an algorithm that 
gave priority to temporal proximity 
to the prescription fill date and the 
type of medical care (Supplemental 
Section 3; Supplemental Table 6). 
When multiple potential indications 
were noted, we assigned the primary 
indication in the following order: 
outpatient procedure and/or surgery, 
trauma, dental procedure, back 
pain, other musculoskeletal pain, 
abdominal pain, headache or other 
neurologic condition, and infection.
Opioid-Related Adverse Events
An opioid-related adverse event 
was defined as an emergency 
department (ED) visit, hospital 
admission, or death related to an 
opioid adverse effect. Potential cases 
during follow-up were identified 
from deaths or medical encounters 
possibly indicating opioid adverse 
effects (Supplemental Section 5; 
Supplemental Fig 3).31 The medical 
encounters had to have either a 
coded diagnosis explicitly indicating 
an adverse medication effect (opioid 
or an unspecified medication) or 
symptoms consistent with an opioid 
overdose.31 Medical records were 
sought for all of these encounters 
as well as for all deaths (including 
autopsies when available) during 
follow-up. Deidentified records were 
independently adjudicated by 2 study 
physicians (S.T.C. and C.P.C.), with 
disagreements resolved by all the 
investigators.
A confirmed case of an opioid-
related adverse event required 
evidence in the medical record 
of an adverse effect that could 
be reasonably attributed to an 
opioid (Supplemental Section 5; 
Supplemental Fig 4).31 The following 
were the 3 categories of confirmed 
cases (Supplemental Section 5): (1) 
probable with symptoms (opioid 
adverse effect signs or symptoms that 
could not be reasonably attributed 
to another cause); (2) probable with 
intervention (signs or symptoms 
not recorded in the chart, but there 
was direct intervention or escalation 
of care appropriate to manage a 
potential opioid adverse effect); and 
(3) possible (opioid adverse effect 
signs or symptoms, but another 
potential cause was documented).
Case severity was assessed by 
determining if the medical record 
documented an opioid-related 
intervention or escalation of care 
(Supplemental Section 5) or if there 
was hospitalization or death. Medical 
records were used to identify the 
source of the opioid implicated in 
the adverse reaction (the patient’s 
prescription or other source) and 
characterize the circumstances of the 
opioid use as (1) therapeutic use (no 
documentation indicating deviation 
from the prescribed regimen, 
overdose, or substance use disorder), 
(2) unintentional overdose, or (3) 
substance use disorder and/or 
self-harm.
The analysis of opioid-related 
adverse events was restricted 
to prescriptions filled between 
1999 and 2011. This cutoff date 
of 2011 was due to the long lead 
time required to identify medical 
care providers, seek permission to 
review records (with human subjects 
committee submissions), obtain 
the records by an on-site visit if 
necessary, and perform deidentified 
case adjudication.
Analysis: Opioid Prescription 
Prevalence
For each study year, we calculated 
the annual opioid prescription 
prevalence. The numerator was 
the number of children with 1 
or more qualifying study opioid 
prescriptions filled during a given 
year. The denominator was the study 
population size during that same 
year, calculated as the number of 
children enrolled in TennCare on 
July 1 who on that date met the study 
eligibility criteria (Supplemental 
Table 4).
Analysis: Opioid-Related Adverse 
Events
The prescription exposure period 
(follow-up for opioid-related 
adverse events) extended from the 
prescription fill date through 14 days 
after the end of the prescribed days 
of supply (Supplemental Section 4). 
The exposure period was further 
classified as current use (filling of 
the prescription through the end 
of days of supply) and recent use 
(additional 14 days after the end 
of days of supply). Although the 
greatest risk for adverse effects 
should be during current use, the 
exposure period included recent 
use to account for pro re nata 
prescriptions. It was suggested in a 
pilot study that more than one-third 
of cases of opioid-related adverse

 events occurred during the recent 
use period.31 We also classified the 
exposure period according to days 
since the prescription fill (1–3, 4–7, 
≥8) because some adverse effects are 
more likely to occur early in therapy.
We estimated the cumulative 
incidence of opioid-related adverse 
events during the prescription 
exposure period with the product-
limit method.32 To test for differences 
in incidence according to current 
versus recent use and dose, we 
modeled the incidence rate ratio 
(IRR) with Poisson regression. In 
this analysis, both the person-days 
of each prescription exposure period 
and the study cases were allocated to 
the appropriate covariate categories. 
The multivariate model included sex, 
age category, calendar year, days 
since the prescription fill, current 
versus recent use, and dose. The 
primary analysis included multiple 
instances of adverse events for 
the same child (0.5% of cases); an 
analysis in which we excluded these 
had essentially identical results. All 
analyses were done by using Stata/
MP 13.1 (Stata Corp, College  
Station, TX).

RESULTS
Opioid Prescription Prevalence
During the study period, the 
population included an annual 
mean of 401 972 children enrolled 
in TennCare without severe 
conditions or diagnosed substance 
abuse disorders. These children 
had 1 362 503 filled outpatient 
prescriptions for opioid analgesics, 
of which 269 602 (19.8%) were for 
children 2 to 5 years of age, 377 823 
(27.7%) were for children 6 to 
11, and 715 078 (52.5%) were for 
children and adolescents 12 to 17.
Of these children, a mean of 15.0% 
(annual range: 10.2%–17.2%) had 1 
or more filled opioid prescriptions 
each year (Fig 1A). Children and 
adolescents 12 to 17 years of 
age were the most likely to be 
prescribed opioids (Fig 1B); for these 
children, the mean annual opioid 
prescription prevalence was 22.4% 
(15.8%–26.0%). The mean annual 
opioid prescription prevalence was 
lower for younger children (Fig

 1B). For children 2 to 5 years and 
6 to 11 years of age, the respective 
mean annual opioid prescription 
prevalences were 11.2% (range: 
7.6%–13.1%) and 12.1% (range: 
7.9%–14.1%).
For each age group, the annual 
prescription prevalence declined 
after 2009. By 2014, the annual 
opioid prescription prevalences were 
10.2% for all children and 7.6%, 
7.9%, and 15.8%, respectively, for 
those 2 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 17 
years of age.
Characteristics of Children With 
Opioid Prescriptions
Of the study prescriptions, 52.0% 
were for female patients (Table 1). 
There were 6.5% of prescriptions 
for children with disability-related 
enrollment and 11.5% for children 
hospitalized in the previous year.
For study opioid prescriptions with 
an identified indication (85.1%; Table 
1), the most common indications 
were dental procedures (31.1%), 
outpatient surgical or medical 
procedures (25.1%), trauma (18.1%), 
and minor infections (16.5%), most 
frequently ear, nose, throat, and/
or upper respiratory infections. For 
children 2 to 5 years of age, 23.7% 
of prescriptions had an infection 
indication.
The median prescription exposure 
period included 3 days of current 
use and 14 days of recent use, for a 
total study exposure of 17 days. The 
median opioid dose was between 0.5 
and 0.6 mg/kg per day (morphine 
equivalents). The most commonly 
prescribed individual opioids (Table 1)  
were hydrocodone (42.1% of 
prescriptions), codeine (40.2%), 
meperidine (5.2%), oxycodone 
(4.6%), and tramadol (2.9%). 
Meperidine was prescribed more 
frequently for children 2 to 5 years 
of age (10.8% of prescriptions), 
whereas oxycodone and tramadol 
were prescribed more frequently 
for children and adolescents 12 to 
17 years of age (8.2% and 5.3% of 
prescriptions, respectively).
Opioid-Related Adverse Events
We identified 1179 potential opioid-
related ED visits, hospitalizations, 
or deaths between 1999 and 2011. 
Medical records with sufficient 
information for adjudication were 
retrieved for 917 (77.8%) potential 
cases (Supplemental Fig 3), of which 
437 were confirmed cases that met 
the criteria for an opioid-related 
adverse event (Supplemental Fig 4).
Of these cases, 272 (62.2%) were 
adjudicated as probable with

 symptoms (Table 2), 27 (6.2%) as 
probable with intervention, and 138 
(31.6%) as possible, most commonly 
because another drug could have been 
used to explain the signs or symptoms 
that supported opioid involvement 
(Supplemental Table 8). There were 
19.5% of cases with an opioid-related 
intervention or escalation of care, 
hospitalization, or death (Table 2). 
Each of the 3 deaths had an autopsy, 
the underlying cause of death was an 
adverse medication effect, and there 
was evidence that the death was 
related to the prescribed opioid.
The most frequent opioid-related 
symptoms were gastrointestinal 
(30.7%), neuropsychiatric (27.5%), 
dermatologic (23.3%), and central 
nervous system (CNS) depression 
(22.2%). For 88.6% of cases, the 
opioid prescribed for the child was 
implicated in the adverse event. 
For 71.2% of cases, there was no 
recorded evidence of deviation from 
the prescribed regimen.
The characteristics of opioid-related 
adverse events for children and 
adolescents 12 to 17 years of age (n = 
310) differed from those for younger 
children (Table 2). They were more 
likely to result in an opioid-related 
intervention or escalation of care, 
hospitalization, or death; to involve 
opioids from an unidentified source; 
and to be related to substance use 
disorder or self-harm.
Incidence of Opioid-Related Adverse 
Events
The cumulative incidence of opioid-
related adverse events during the 
median prescription exposure 
period was 38.3 (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 34.9–42.1) events per 
100 000 prescriptions (Fig 2A). The 
cumulative incidence for children 
and adolescents 12 to 17 years of 
age was greater than that observed 
for children ages 2 to 5 and 6 to 11, 
respectively (Fig 2B); the adjusted 
IRR for children and adolescents 12 
to 17 years of age (Table 3; reference 
group of children 2–5 years of age) 
was 2.22 (95% CI, 1.67–2.96).
The adjusted incidence of opioid-
related adverse events during current 
use was greater than that observed 
during recent use (Table 3; IRR = 2.09; 
95% CI, 1.58–2.76). Adverse events 
occurred more frequently shortly after 
the prescription fill; the respective 
adjusted IRRs for days 1 to 3 and 4 to 7 
after the fill (reference ≥8 days) were 
3.31 (95% CI, 2.41–4.53) and 1.51 
(95% CI, 1.13–2.02), respectively. The 
incidence of opioid-related adverse 
events increased with increasing dose; 
the adjusted IRRs for the high and 
intermediate dose tertiles were 1.86 
(95% CI, 1.45–2.39) and 1.59 (95% CI, 
1.23–2.04), respectively. Sensitivity 
analyses used to restrict the cases to 
those adjudicated as probable with 
symptoms of opioid adverse effects 
had essentially identical findings 
(Supplemental Table 10).

Downloaded from 
 outpatient opioid prescription 
annually, including ˃10% of children 
2 to 5 years of age. The primary 
indications for these prescriptions 
were acute and, in most cases, 
self-limited conditions (dental 
procedures, outpatient surgical or 
medical procedures, trauma, and 
minor infections).
The prevalence of opioid 
prescriptions for children in 
the study peaked in 2009 and 
subsequently decreased through 
2014, which is consistent with 
other recent data from pediatric 
populations9 and secular trends 
in adults.33 This decrease may be 
related to several factors, including 
greater awareness of the potential 
harms of widespread opioid use 
and a prescription drug monitoring 
program started in Tennessee in 
2012. Nevertheless, the prevalence 
of opioid prescriptions for children 
in the study remained >10% by 
2014. The frequent prescribing of 
opioids in this population, including 
codeine, which now is considered 
a suboptimal analgesic choice for 
children, 
34 underscores the need 
for education regarding multimodal 
opioid-sparing regimens.
One of every 2611 opioid 
prescriptions for the children in the 
study was followed by an opioid-
related ED visit, hospitalization, 
or death. The incidence of opioid-
related adverse events increased for 
children and adolescents 12 to 17 
years of age, during current opioid 
use, and with higher opioid doses.
Because we sought to minimize false-
positive study events, our findings

a The Poisson regression model for adjusted IRRs includes age (2–5, 6–11, and 12–17 years), sex, current versus recent 
use, days since the prescription fill (1–3, 4–7, and ≥8), dose tertile by age, and calendar year (1999–2003, 2004–2007, and 
2008–2011). Current use was defined as the time between the filling of the prescription and the end of the days of supply. 
Recent use was defined as the additional 14 days after the end of the days of supply.

 are likely to underestimate the 
incidence of opioid-related adverse 
events in children. First, unlike 
other definitions, 
35 opioid-related 
adverse events managed with a 
physician visit or not resulting in 
medical care encounters were not 
considered. Second, records with 
diagnoses of less serious symptoms 
(gastrointestinal or dermatologic) 
were not sought unless a coded 
diagnosis indicated an adverse 
drug effect and did not attribute the 
effect to a different drug. Finally, 
the medical records required for 
case confirmation were unavailable 
for 22.2% of potential cases. Thus, 
our study provides a conservative 
estimate of the clinical impact of 
adverse opioid effects in children.
In 89% of the opioid-related adverse 
events, the implicated opioid came 
from the child’s prescription, and,  
in two-thirds of the cases, there  
was no recorded evidence of 
deviation from the prescribed 
regimen. In contrast, in many 
pediatric case reports, opioid adverse 
effects are attributed to errors in 
administration, 
21 unsupervised use, 
22 
 
use of leftover medications, 
36 or 
ingestion of opioids from another 
person’s prescription.37 Our finding 
that nontherapeutic opioid use 
did not account for the majority of 
opioid-related adverse events in 
patients who received outpatient 
opioid prescriptions suggests that 
efforts to improve opioid safety 
in children must go beyond the 
reduction of administration errors or 
inappropriate use.
More than 20% of the children and 
adolescents 12 to 17 years of age 
in the study were prescribed an 
opioid annually. Although the opioids 
implicated in the adverse events 
for these children predominantly 
were those prescribed, more than 
one-fourth of the adolescent cases 
were attributed to substance use 
disorder or attempted self-harm. 
These findings indicate that extra 
precautions may be needed when 
prescribing opioids to adolescents 
for acute, self-limited conditions, 
given the increased likelihood of risk-
taking during this developmental 
period.38 
– 
41
The opioid-related adverse events 
identified from ED visits included less 
serious reactions, such as nausea, 
constipation, pruritus, and rash. 
Although not life-threatening, these 
symptoms did lead to additional 
medical care encounters, which entail 
both inconvenience and additional 
costs. These findings underscore the 
need to develop more comprehensive 
pediatric guidelines for the 
treatment of acute, self-limited 
conditions, which should balance 
both the unnecessary exposure of 
children to increased risk of adverse 
opioid effects and the potential for 
undertreatment of painful short-term 
conditions.
The generalizability of the study 
findings may be limited because 
of the characteristics of the study 
cohort. To better identify indication, 
we required that cohort inclusion 
be dependent on active use of 
medical care in the past year, 
which could underrepresent the 
healthiest children. The cohort came 
from Medicaid enrollees from a 
single state in a region with known 
elevated prevalence of opioid use for 
adults.42 Furthermore, ED use differs 
according to Medicaid status, with 
greater use of services for less severe 
conditions.43 However, children 
enrolled in Medicaid constitute an 
important population per se, because 
an estimated 38% of US children 
have health insurance coverage by 
Medicaid.44
The study relied upon a large 
computerized database used to 
identify both the cohort and potential 
opioid-related adverse events. Thus, 
it lacked important clinical detail. For 
example, because the Medicaid files 
did not include weight, the analysis 
of dose was based on national 
growth charts and was subject to 
misclassification. However, the large 
database did permit characterization 
of opioid prescribing and related 
adverse events in a large, well-
defined pediatric population.
Our study had several other 
limitations. We relied on medical 
records that may be incomplete 
to adjudicate potential cases and 
to identify the circumstances of 
the opioid-related adverse effects, 
including the source of the implicated 
opioid. Because all children in 
the study had a recent opioid 
prescription, adjudicators could 
not be blinded to opioid exposure 
status; however, the adjudication 
process used a structured protocol31 
and required agreement by 2 
independent reviewers, with 
disagreements resolved by all 
investigators.
CONCLUSIONS
In this cohort of children enrolled in 
Medicaid without severe conditions, 
15% of children filled outpatient 
opioid analgesic prescriptions 
annually for acute, self-limited 
conditions. One of every 2611 study 
opioid prescriptions was followed 
by an opioid-related ED visit, 
hospitalization, or death; more than 
two-thirds of these were related to 
therapeutic use of the prescribed 
opioid.
