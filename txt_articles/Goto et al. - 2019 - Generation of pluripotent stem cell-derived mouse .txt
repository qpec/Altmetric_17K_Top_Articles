Regeneration of human kidneys in animal models would help combat the severe shortage of
donors in transplantation therapy. Previously, we demonstrated by interspecific blastocyst
complementation between mouse and rats, generation of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived
functional pancreas, in apancreatic Pdx1 mutant mice. We, however, were unable to obtain rat
PSC-derived kidneys in anephric Sall1 mutant mice, likely due to the poor contribution of rat
PSCs to the mouse metanephric mesenchyme, a nephron progenitor. Here, conversely, we
show that mouse PSCs can efficiently differentiate into the metanephric mesenchyme in rat,
allowing the generation of mouse PSC-derived kidney in anephric Sall1 mutant rat. Glomerular
epithelium and renal tubules in the kidneys are entirely composed of mouse PSC-derived cells
expressing key functional markers. Importantly, the ureter-bladder junction is normally
formed. These data provide proof-of-principle for interspecific blastocyst complementation as
a viable approach for kidney generation.

rgan transplantation is among the most effective treat-
ments to improve quality-of-life (QOL) in patients with
end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, a chronic
shortage of donor kidneys leaves many patients with ESRD no
choice, but to undergo continued dialysis treatment, associated
with poor QOL, high medical costs and risk of complications.
Currently in the USA, an estimated 95,000 patients are waiting
for a kidney transplant, resulting in an 80% kidney demand over
all other organs1. Generation of transplantable kidneys from
pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), such as embryonic stem cells
(ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), is an attractive
solution to this problem. However, despite advances in ex vivo
generation of renal compartments from PSCs2–5, generating
three-dimensional (3D), functional, and size-matched kidneys
from PSCs remains a significant challenge6.
Blastocyst complementation is an innovative and potentially
promising approach7: when blastocysts harvested from mutant
animals lacking specific organs, are injected with PSCs, the entire
organ generates from the PSCs, in the relevant developmental
niche of the resultant chimeras. For instance, use of apancreatic
Pdx1mut/mut mouse host blastocysts allows the generation of PSC-
derived pancreas by blastocyst complementation, in allogenic, as
well as in an interspecific setting between mouse and rat8,9.
Furthermore, transplantation of islets from mouse PSC-derived
pancreas generated in Pdx1mut/mut rats successfully restored
blood glucose levels in diabetic mice, demonstrating a proof-of-
concept for the use of PSC-derived organs for therapy9.
For kidney generation, the anephric Sall1mut/mut model, devoid
of functional kidneys, can provide a suitable developmental niche
for PSC-derived cells. Kidney formation requires reciprocally
inductive interactions between the metanephric mesenchyme, a
nephron progenitor, and the ureteric bud. The metanephric
mesenchyme further differentiates into the glomerular epithelia
and renal tubules. Sall1, an essential gene expressed in the
metanephric mesenchyme, is crucial for ureteric bud attraction
toward the mesenchyme in mice10,11. Thus, Sall1mut/mut mice
show an anephric phenotype due to failed signaling at E11.510.
Mouse PSCs injected into the Sall1mut/mut mouse blastocysts,
form exclusively PSC-derived metanephric mesenchyme which
interacts with the ureteric bud, resulting in the generation of
mouse-PSC-derived kidney12. In an interspecific setting, however,
we previously reported that rat PSCs fail to form kidneys in
Sall1mut/mut mice12, despite developing chimeric renal tissues in
wildtype mice9. This finding impedes testing the therapeutic
potential of kidneys created in a xenogenic environment, as well
as in addressing fundamental questions in biology such as size
regulation of solid organs.
Here, we show, in an interspecific setting between mouse and
rat, that unlike rat PSCs, mouse PSCs efficiently contribute to
Sall1 positive metanephric mesenchyme. Therefore, we are able to
successfully generate mouse kidneys in the Sall1mut/mut rat model
by interspecific blastocyst complementation.
Results
Contribution of PSCs to metanephric mesenchyme in chimeras.
We first attempted to understand the causes behind the failure of
interspecific blastocyst complementation, for kidney generation,
when rat PSCs were injected into Sall1mut/mut mouse blastocysts.
Since, during allogenic blastocyst complementation, wildtype
PSC-derived cells could replace mutant cells in the metanephric
mesenchyme12, we reasoned that a required level of PSC con-
tribution to the metanephric mesenchyme, is essential for the
successful generation of the PSC-derived kidney. The metanephric
mesenchyme expressing Sall1 and Six2, another nephron pro-
genitor marker in mice13,14, initiates the ureteric bud interaction

 at E11.5 in mouse and E13.5 in rat (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus,
we investigated a contribution of donor PSCs to the metanephric
mesenchyme after injection of rat ESCs into wildtype mouse
blastocysts (R- > M) and mouse ESCs into wildtype rat blastocysts
(M- > R) (Fig. 1a). Quantitative immunohistological analysis
revealed that, in the Sall1 positive metanephric mesenchyme, the
contribution of rat ESCs in R- > M was significantly lower than
that of mouse ESCs in M- > R (3.9 vs. 38.0%) (Fig. 1b). Notably, in
R- > M, the contribution of rat ESCs to Sall1-negative surrounding
tissues including the ureteric bud was not as low as the meta-
nephric mesenchyme (Fig. 1a). Indicating that, rat PSCs are less
efficient in differentiating specifically into the metanephric
mesenchyme compared to other tissues in the mouse. These
data suggest that, as in the previous study12, the number of rat
PSC-derived metanephric mesenchyme in Sall1mut/mut mouse
might not be sufficient to attract the ureteric bud for renal
development.
Generation and characterization of Sall1mut/mut rats. Since
mouse PSCs efficiently contribute to metanephric mesenchyme
in M- > R in contrast to rat PSCs in R- > M, we believed we could
generate mouse PSC-derived kidney in anephric rats by inter-
specific blastocyst complementation. To provide the necessary
developmental niche for a kidney in the rat, we first created a
Sall1mut/mut rat model. We microinjected clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 constructs
into rat zygote pronuclei, to delete an approximately 4.9 kb
region containing exon 2 and exon 3 of rat Sall1 gene, and
generated heterozygous founder rats (Fig. 2a, Supplementary
Fig. 2a–c). After intercrossing heterozygous mutant rats, wild-
type (Sall1+/+), heterozygotes (Sall1+/mut), and homozygous
mutant (Sall1mut/mut) zygotes developed to embryonic day 21.5
(E21.5) fetuses in a Mendelian fashion. Notably, the Sall1mut/mut
F0 fetus (CRISPR #7), as well as all of the Sall1mut/mut F2 fetuses
from CRISPR #1 line intercross exhibited a kidney-deficient
(anephric) phenotype (Fig. 2b), similar to Sall1mut/mut mice10. To
visualize the expression of Sall1 in rats, we also generated Sall1-
tdTomato knock-in rats by replacing the Sall1 gene with tdTo-
mato via homologous recombination (HR)-based gene targeting
in rat ES cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). While Sall1tdTomato/
tdTomato neonates exhibited an anephric phenotype like Sall1mut/
mut rats, Sall1+/tdTomato neonate kidneys uniformly expressed
tdTomato (Fig. 2c). Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed the
presence of a rudimentary kidney and intact ureter without
functional nephric units in Sall1tdTomato/tdTomato rats, whereas
normal kidney histology was observed in Sall1+/tdTomato and
Sall1+/+ rats (Fig. 2d). In addition to the renal parenchyma, the
expression of tdTomato was also observed in the brain, uterus,
and limbs in both Sall1tdTomato/tdTomato and Sall1+/tdTomato
neonates (Fig. 2e), which corresponds to the Sall1 expression
pattern in mice10,15. Collectively, these data indicate Sall1 gene is
well conserved between mouse and rat in its essential role in

 kidney development, as well as in its tissue-wide expression
pattern. Importantly, the anephric Sall1mut/mut (including Sal-
l1tdTomato/tdTomato) rat model can now provide the necessary
developmental niche to generate a kidney.
Generation of mouse kidney in rat. We then performed inter-
specific blastocyst complementation using Sall1mut/mut rat blas-
tocysts with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled mouse ESCs
to generate mouse kidney in the rat. We injected 252 blastocysts
derived from the intercross of Sall1+/mut or tdTomato (CRISPR#1,
HR#4) with mouse ESCs and transferred them into pseudo-
pregnant rat uteri. A total of 76 of 110 fetuses were identified as
interspecific chimeras, assessed by GFP fluorescence in the peri-
natal skin at E20.5–21.5 and P0. Retrospective genotype analysis
revealed that Sall1+/+, Sall1+/mut, and Sall1mut/mut chimeric rats
had been born with a Mendelian ratio (Table 1). The mouse ESCs
contributed to various organs including skin, muscle, heart,
thymus, and kidney, but contributed less to the pancreas, liver,
and lung regardless of genotyping (Fig. 3a). Average chimerism in
splenic lymphocytes was 3.0%, independent of genotype (Fig. 3b).
In the kidney, all of the Sall1+/mut and Sall1+/+ chimeric neo-
nates had chimeric kidneys composed of both donor- and host-
derived cells, remarkably, of the 18 Sall1mut/mut chimeric neo-
nates, 12 (67%) had a pair of kidneys uniformly expressing GFP,
indicating successful generation of mouse-PSC derived kidneys in
the rats (Fig. 3c). The rest of the Sall1mut/mut chimeric neonates
without kidneys showed low levels of chimerism in lymphocytes
(red squares in Fig. 3b). Thus, as in the Sall1mut/mut mouse
complemented with rat PSCs, low levels of chimerism, likely
correlate with failure to form PSC-derived kidneys. Furthermore,
we successfully generated kidneys derived from allogenic rat ESCs
(Supplementary Fig. 4a–c), as well as xenogenic mouse iPSCs
(Supplementary Fig. 4d–f), demonstrating the consistency of
blastocyst complementation in kidney, regardless of the donor
cell types. While mouse ESC-derived kidneys in Sall1mut/mut rats
at P0 were histologically normal (Fig. 3d), their size was smaller
than normal neonatal and Sall1+/mut and Sall1+/+ chimeric rats,
and were similar to that of mice kidneys (Fig. 3e). Thus, we
hypothesize that at least until birth, the size of the kidney might
either be under the control of certain species-specific intrinsic
factor(s), or reflect the extent of chimerism of donor PSCs.
We next investigated whether the Sall1mut/mut chimeric
fetuses survived to adulthood. We injected 148 blastocysts
derived from intercrossing Sall1+/mut rats with mouse ESCs; 63
of 100 offspring were GFP-positive interspecific chimeras. Only
21 of the offspring survived for more than 8 weeks. Notably, all
of the 21 rats that survived to adulthood were either Sall1+/+
(n = 9) or Sall1+/mut (n = 12), whereas none of the Sall1mut/mut
rats with mouse PSC-derived kidneys survived much longer
after birth due to defects in milk suckling (Supplementary
Fig. 5a), this phenotype corresponds to Sall1mut/mut mice with
mouse-PSC-derived kidneys10.
Characterization of mouse PSC-derived kidney in rat. We
performed immunohistology to validate correct expression of
functional markers of renal components and to identify the origin
of the cells in the mouse-ESC derived kidneys in Sall1mut/mut rats,
at P0. We distinguish each renal component based on the specific
functional markers (Supplementary Fig. 6a, Supplementary
Table 1). In Sall1+/+ and Sall1+/mut chimeric rat kidneys, all the
renal components consisted of a mixture of mouse and rat-
derived cells (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 6b). In contrast, mouse
PSC-derived kidneys in Sall1mut/mut chimeric rats, were entirely
composed of GFP-positive mouse ESCs-derived cells, including
the Nephrin16-positive podocytes, the Aquaporin 117-positive
proximal tubule, descending limb of loop of Henle, and loop of
Henle, and the Na+/K+ ATPase α-118 strongly positive ascending
limb of loop of Henle and distal tubule (Fig. 4a). Correct locali-
zations of these markers (Nephrin at glomerular basement
membrane; Aquaporin 1 at both apical and basolateral plasma
membrane; Na+/K+ ATPase α-1 at basolateral plasma mem-
brane) were detected. Notably, these markers are strongly asso-
ciated with the functioning of the nephron, suggesting mouse
PSCs differentiate correctly into functional cells in the xenogenic
environment. Additionally, from the histological analysis, we
found the Bowman’s capsular epithelial cells formed outside the
podocytes were also entirely mouse ESC derived (arrowheads in
Fig. 4a upper right). On the other hand, the Calbindin-positive
collecting ducts in the renal medulla, and CD31-positive capillary
vessels of the glomeruli and cortical blood vessels consisted of
both mouse and rat derived cells (Fig. 4b). These results indicate
that all the metanephric mesenchyme-derived cells impaired in
Sall1mut/mut rats originate from mouse PSCs, whereas the other
compartments in the kidney comprise both mouse PSCs and
Sall1mut/mut rat blastocysts (Fig. 4c). The number of glomeruli in
kidney was similar between Sall1mut/mut chimeric rats and control
mice (Supplementary Fig. 7a, c), while the size of glomeruli was
similar between Sall1mut/mut chimeric rats and control rats
(Supplementary Fig. 7b).
We next investigated whether mouse ESC-derived kidneys can
form proper ureter and bladder connections. An intraurethral dye
infusion proved patency between the ureter and the bladder in
two of the four P0 Sall1mut/mut chimeras harboring mouse PSC-
derived kidneys (Fig. 4d), indicating the organ has the potential to
excrete urine.
Finally, to check if the filtering system in the kidneys work,
we measured blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine
(CRE) in the serum of Sall1mut/mut chimeric rats with mouse
PSC-derived
kidney,
10–14 h
after
birth.
No
significant
difference compared with Sall1+/+ and Sall1+/mut chimeras,
as well as Sall1mut/mut rats lacking kidneys was observed
(Supplementary Fig. 5b), possibly due to inadequate activity of
the neonates postnatally.
Discussion
Our work demonstrates the successful generation of mouse PSC-
derived kidneys in Sall1mut/mut rats, by interspecific blastocyst
complementation. This approach has succeeded for pancreas8,9
and thymus19 generation between mouse and rats. However,
applying interspecific blastocyst complementation for kidney

 genesis would have a more substantial impact on regenerative
medicine, due to high donor demand in end-stage renal disease
patients20,21.
A key finding that we report is that sufficient contribution of
xenogenic PSCs to the metanephric mesenchyme is essential for
kidney formation. Histological analysis at the onset of metanephric
mesenchyme and ureteric bud interaction revealed that contribution
of rat PSCs to Sall1 positive metanephric mesenchyme in R- > M is
less efficient than mouse PSCs in M- > R, which likely explains the
failure of kidney formation in Sall1mut/mut mice complemented with
rat PSCs12. Also in M- > R, low chimerism of mouse PSCs is highly
correlated with failure of complementation in Sall1mut/mut rats.
Thus, in the kidney, a minimum level of PSC contribution to the
metanephric mesenchyme is required to initiate interaction with the
ureteric bud. Since PSCs contribute to all other tissues to a similar
extent in an allogenic setting, the interspecific variability for kidney
formation is likely due to incompatibilities in environmental cues
such as cytokines and extracellular matrix during development,
rather than potency of the PSCs. As we have shown previously, in
interspecific chimeras between mouse and rat, the level of con-
tribution of the xenogenic PSCs varies from organ-to-organ8,22.

 remains unknown at this time. Nevertheless, the extent of con-
tribution of xenogenic PSCs to the target organ, specifically the
tissues or lineages to be replaced, should be an important con-
sideration while choosing the appropriate host during interspecific
blastocyst complementation.
The kidney generated by blastocyst complementation in our
study is likely to function in vivo, based on expression of func-
tional markers in the mouse PSC-derived nephron and the ureter-
bladder junction. Additionally, we observed patency between
ureter and bladder, which indicated normal development of the
kidney, with potential to excrete urine. Although testing the fil-
tering system in nephrons would strengthen evidence for its
function, postnatal lethality of Sall1mut/mut rat containing mouse
PSC-derived kidney limits further investigation. Despite the
presence of wildtype PSC-derived cells in chimeras, the milk
suckling defect observed in Sall1mut/mut rats was not rescued, akin

 to Sall1mut/mut mouse with mouse PSC-derived kidney12. Sall1 is
highly expressed in the olfactory bulb. Sall1 mutant olfactory
bulbs are small in size, show abnormalities in neurogenesis and
have reduced mitral cells, likely rendering the newborn mice
anosmic and therefore unable to suckle milk23,24. To overcome
the limitations posed by the mutant host phenotype, disrupting
other essential genes for kidney development should be exam-
ined. Alternately, conditionally deleting essential genes or ablat-
ing specific cells might be an avenue to explore.
For transplantation therapy, further elimination of host
blastocysts derived cells would be essential to reduce the use of
immunosuppressive treatment. While all the metanephric
mesenchyme cells were of mouse PSC origin in Sall1mut/mut
rats, the ureteric bud-derived collecting tubes and blood vessels
were composed of a mixture of donor and host cell types. Thus,
a combination of genetically modified animals, which can
provide the appropriate developmental niche, should be con-
sidered for complete replacement of the kidney by PSC-derived
cells.
In the future, it might be possible to generate human PSC-
derived organs in livestock by using the blastocyst com-
plementation
approach.
Despite
successful
contribution
of
human PSCs to pig embryos after blastocyst injection25, the
chimerism was low and insufficient for organ development, like
our observations for the kidney. Exploring alternative culture
conditions of donor human PSCs or inhibition of apoptosis by
forced expression of anti-apoptotic factors to prevent the elim-
ination of PSC-derived cells might be helpful to increase chi-
merism26–28.
Conversely,
increasing
interspecific
chimerism
associated with poor survival of the chimeras8,25, and raises
ethical concerns regarding the presence of human cells in neural
or germline lineages29. Thus, limiting the potency towards a
specific lineage by genetic manipulation in PSCs30, or context-
dependent usage of differentiated cells from PSCs upon inhibiting

In conclusion, we have extended the application of interspecific
blastocyst complementation between mouse and rat to generate
fully developed kidneys. This study provides a tool to address
fundamental questions on kidney ontogeny and regulation of size
in solid organs and could offer clues to successful generation of
human organs in animals.
Methods
Experimental statement. All procedures for animal experimentation were
reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National
Institute for Physiological Sciences. Specific pathogen-free Crlj:WI rats (RGD ID:
2312504) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc. (Kanagawa,
Japan). Specific pathogen-free C57BL/6 NCrSlc and C57BL/6N-Tg (CAG-EGFP)32
mice were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). All rats and mice
were housed in an environmentally controlled room with a 12-h dark/12-h light
cycle at 23 ± 2 °C and humidity of 55 ± 5%, and given ad libitum access to a
laboratory diet (CE-2; CLEA Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and filtered water. Study
reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless
otherwise stated.
Generation of tdTomato-knockin rats at Sall1 locus. The targeting vector was
constructed from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone RNB1-
261M0433 using a counter-selection BAC modification kit and a BAC subcloning
kit (Gene Bridges Gmbh, Heidelberg, Germany). The RNB1-261M04 was pro-
vided by RIKEN BRC through the National Bio-Resource Project of MEXT,
Japan. In brief, tdTomato (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) with FRT-PGK-
gb2-neo-FRT cassette (Gene Bridges) was substituted at the site between the
second and third exons located within functional DNA binding domains of the
Sall1 gene (accession no. NM_001107415.2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
nuccore/NM_001107415.2)). The BAC backbone was replaced with a plasmid
cassette containing a chloramphenicol resistance gene and ori from pACYC184
DNA (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd., Toyama, Japan). The final targeting vector was
linearized by ScaI digestion.
Rat ESCs (WDB/Nips-ES1/Nips, RGD ID: 10054010) were cultured on
mitomycin C (MMC)-treated Neo-MEFs (KBL9284100; Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd.
Tokyo, Japan) in 2iF medium consisting of N2B27 medium with 1-μM mitogen-
activated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD0325901 (Stemgent Inc., Cambridge,
MA, USA), 3-μM glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor CHIR99021
(Axon Medchem, Groningen, The Netherlands), 1000 U/mL ESGRO® (Merck
Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), and 10-μM forskolin. The targeting vector
(25 μg) was introduced into 5 × 106 ESCs by electroporation at 800 V, 10 μF in
500 μL of N2B27 medium, and the electroporated ESCs were treated with
200-μg/mL G418 for 48 h. Knockin at the Sall1 locus was determined by PCR for
tdTomato with AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster
City, CA, USA) and for the 5’-upstream HR region of Sall1 locus with
PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan), then
confirmed by southern blot using DIG-labeled probes. E4.5 blastocysts were
retrieved from Crlj:WI female rats, injected with recombinant ESCs using a
piezo-driven micromanipulator (Prime Tech Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan), and
transferred into uteri of pseudopregnant Crlj:WI females at 3.5 days post-coitum
(dpc) to generate chimeric rats. F1 heterozygous offspring were derived from
wildtype Crlj:WI females mated with male chimeras (. Genomic DNA samples
were extracted from ear tissues, then used for PCR screening and genotyping in
Sall1 locus. Primer sequences used for PCR screening, Southern blotting, and
genotyping are listed in Supplementary Table 2.
Generation of Sall1-knockout rats by CRISPR/Cas9 system. Pronuclear-stage
zygotes were harvested from 7–8-week-old Crlj:WI females that had been super-
ovulated by intraperitoneal injections of 150-IU kg−1 equine chorionic gonado-
tropin (eCG; Aska Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG; Aska Pharmaceutical) at an interval of 48–50 h and had mated
with fertile Crlj:WI males. Two guide sequences targeted at the second and third
exons of rat Sall1 locus (target 1 and target 2: Fig. 2a) were introduced into bi-
cistronic expression vector px330 expressing Cas9 and single-guide RNA. The
px330 vectors with one of the two guide sequences (2.5 ng μL−1 each) were co-
injected into the pronucleus of zygotes. The zygotes were cultured for 16 h in
mKRB medium at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air, then evaluated for survival and
cleavage to the 2-cell stage. All the surviving embryos were transferred into ovi-
ductal ampullae of pseudopregnant females at 0.5 dpc. Living fetuses were recov-
ered from the recipient females at E21.5, or full-term offspring were delivered from
the recipients. Genomic DNA was extracted from ear tissues of founder rats (#1–
#12), and used for PCR screening and genotyping in Sall1 locus (Supplementary
Table 2).
Generation of chimeras with PSCs. Mouse ESCs and iPSCs with GFP fluorescent
marker (SGE212 and GT3.29), or rat ESCs with Venus fluorescent marker (Crlj:WI-
ES1/Nips, RGD ID: 10053737) and tdTomato fluorescent marker (WDB-
Rosa26em1(RT2)Nips-ES2/Nips, RGD ID: 10054032)34, were used for blastocyst
injection. For interspecific chimera generation, host blastocysts were obtained from
Crlj:WI female rats (4.5 dpc) and C57BL/6NCrSlc female mice (3.5 dpc), respec-
tively. For blastocyst complementation, heterozygous Sall1-KO females among
HR#4 or CRISPR#1 rat lines were mated with heterozygous Sall1-KO males of the
corresponding line, and the Sall1+/mut × Sall1+/mut rat blastocysts were retrieved at
4.5 dpc. Each of the seven PSCs that had been maintained on MMC-treated Neo-
MEFs in the 2iF medium and isolated by trypsinization were microinjected into the
blastocoel cavity of the blastocysts. Following a short-term recovery culture for 1–2
h, the injected blastocysts were transferred into uteri of pseudopregnant Crlj:WI
females at 3.5 dpc (10–16 blastocysts per recipient). Fluorescence-based screening
of chimeric rats was performed using E20.5–21.5 fetuses and P0 neonates, as well as
genotype, chimerism and nephrogenetic phenotype analyses. Otherwise, the sur-
rogate mothers were allowed to deliver, and the newborn offspring rats were
analyzed for fluorescent marker expression, genotype, chimerism and phenotype
either immediately or 8 weeks after birth.
Analysis of genotype and chimerism. Genomic DNA of chimeric rats was
extracted from liver pieces or fluorescent-negative fraction of splenic lymphocytes
sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS, SH800; Sony Corp., Tokyo,
Japan). For HR#4 rat line, the Sall1 locus was amplified by PCR using F1, R1 and
R2 primers (Supplementary Table 2). For CRISPR#1 rat line, the Sall1 locus was
amplified by PCR using F1, R2 and R3 primers (Supplementary Table 2). Splenic
lymphocytes were used to determine the fluorescence-based chimerism of each
xenogeneic or allogeneic chimeric rat. The fluorescence-positive gates were set
using the FACS histograms of the non-chimera samples (negative controls).
Histological analysis. Embryos and kidneys were fixed with 10% formalin neutral
buffer solution or 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin or in optimal
cutting temperature (OCT) compound. Paraffin sections were deparaffinized with
xylene, hydrated with graded ethanol, then HE-stained for light microscopy.
Frozen sections with OCT compound were incubated with blocking buffer for 1 h
at room temperature, and further incubated with primary antibody overnight at
4 °C and secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies used
were anit-Sall1 polyclonal antibody (rabbit IgG, 1:100; ab31526, Abcam plc.,
Cambridge, UK)35, anit-Six2 polyclonal antibody (rabbit IgG, 1:100; 11562-1-AP,
Proteintech Group, Inc., Rosemont, IL 60018, USA)35, anti-GFP polyclonal

 antibody (Chick IgY, 1:1000 dilution; ab13970, Abcam), anti-DsRed polyclonal
antibody (rabbit IgG, 1:200 dilution; 632496, Takara Bio Inc.), anti-Nephrin
polyclonal antibody (goat IgG, 1:200 dilution; AF3159-SP, R&D systems Inc.,
Minneapolis, MN, USA), anti-Podocin polyclonal antibody (rabbit IgG, 1:25
dilution; P0372, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Calbindin polyclonal antibody (mouse
monoclonal IgG, 1:200 dilution; ab82812, Abcam), anti-Aquaporin 1 polyclonal
antibody (rabbit IgG, 1:50 dilution; AB2219, Merck Millipore), anti-Na+/K+
ATPase α-1 monoclonal antibody (mouse IgG, 1:50 dilution; 05-369, Merck Mil-
lipore) and anti-CD31 polyclonal antibody (rabbit IgG, 1:50 dilution; ab28364,
Abcam). The secondary antibodies used for visualization were conjugated with
Alexa488, Alexa546 or Alexa647 (1:300 dilution; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Waltham, MA USA). After treatment with the appropriate antibodies, the sections
were stained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma-Aldrich) for
nuclear visualization. The contribution of xenogenic PSCs to Sall1 positive meta-
nephric mesenchyme was quantified by Fiji software.
Biochemical assays in serum. The serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and
creatinine (CRE) were measured by the Nagahama Institute for Biochemical Sci-
ence at Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd. (Shiga, Japan). BUN was examined by the urease-
glutamate dehydrogenase method, and CRE by the creatininase method,
respectively.
Statistical analysis. The contribution of xenogenic PSCs to Sall1 positive meta-
nephric mesenchyme was analyzed by two-tailed Student’s t-test. The chimerism of
GFP- or venus-positive rats, kidney size, and the serum levels of BUN and CRE
were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD post hoc test with js-
STAR (http://www.kisnet.or.jp/nappa/software/star/), and differences among gen-
otypes were considered to be significant at p < 0.05.
