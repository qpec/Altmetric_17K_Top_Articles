After a traumatic insult, macrophages can become activated leading to general inflammation at the site of injury.
Activated macrophages are partially regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) which when activated
suppresses inflammation by limiting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoting the over ex-
pression of immuno-modulatory mediators. This study aims to determine whether the low molecular weight
fraction of 5% human serum albumin (LMWF5A) and N-acetyl kynurenine (NAK), an N-acetyl tryptophan (NAT)
breakdown product in LMWF5A, can regulate inflammation by inhibiting macrophage activation through the
AhR since kynurenine is a known AhR agonist. Using LCMS, we demonstrate that NAT is non-enzymatically
degraded during accelerated aging of LMWF5A with high heat accelerating degradation. More importantly, NAK
is a major degradation product found in LMWF5A. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophages using
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and pre-treated with 2-fold dilutions of LMWF5A or synthetic NAK with
or without an AhR antagonist (CH223191) prior to overnight stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
Treatment with LMWF5A caused a 50–70% decrease in IL-6 release throughout the dilution series. A dose-
response inhibition of IL-6 release was observed for NAK with maximal inhibition (50%) seen at the highest NAK
concentration. Finally, an AhR antagonist partially blocked the anti-inflammatory effect of LMWF5A while
completely blocking the effect of NAK. A similar inhibitory effect was observed for CXCL-10, but the AhR an-
tagonist was not effective suggesting additional mechanisms for CXCL-10 release. These preliminary findings
suggest that LMWF5A and NAK partially promote the suppression of activated macrophages via the AhR re-
ceptor. Therefore, LMWF5A, which contains NAK, is potentially a useful therapeutic in medical conditions where
inflammation is prevalent such as trauma, sepsis, and wound healing.
1. Introduction
Human serum albumin (HSA) is clinically used for the treatment of
shock, acute restoration of blood volume, and hypoalbuminemia. In
recently completed clinical studies, the low molecular weight fraction
of 5% HSA (LMWF5A) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of
knee osteoarthritis (OA) [1,2]. These improvements in knee OA
symptoms include decreases in pain and increases in overall function.

 Recently published findings have documented biochemical and cellular
events that assist in elucidating the anti-inflammatory effects of
LMWF5A using various in vitro assays. In a cell culture model using
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, LMWF5A was shown to
prime these cells for both mobilization and chondrogenic differentia-
tion [3]. LMWF5A was also shown to significantly decrease TNFα re-
lease in LPS-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) [4]. Finally, the effect of LMWF5A on important mediators of
pain and healing in knee OA such as prostaglandins has been suggested
[5]. Indeed, LMWF5A has been shown to increase the release of pros-
taglandins involved in the resolution of inflammation in a PBMC model
[6]. All of these anti-inflammatory and pro-healing observations occur
far downstream from a possible membrane-initiating effect of LMWF5A.
Therefore, the search for potential membrane targets of LMWF5A is
warranted.
Various components of LMWF5A possess anti-inflammatory prop-
erties that might be relevant to nociception and initiation of healing.
For example, the cyclic compound derived from the N-terminus of HSA,
aspartate-alanine diketopiperazine (DA-DKP), is found in LMWF5A in
micromolar concentrations that are high enough to decrease pro-in-
flammatory cytokine release from PBMC and T-cell lines following sti-
mulation [7,8]. An excipient added to 5% HSA solutions, N-acetyl
tryptophan (NAT), is known to have immuno-modulatory properties via
inhibition of neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) thereby regulating im-
portant pro-inflammatory signals in immune cells [9,10]. NAT de-
gradation products have also been identified in commercial HSA solu-
tions with unknown biological activity [11]. Finally, various non-HSA
derived peptides that co-elute with the HSA fraction have been char-
acterized in commercial HSA solutions [12,13]. As a result, it is possible
that any combination of known and unknown small molecular weight
components of commercial HSA solutions contributes to the anti-in-
flammatory properties of LMWF5A.
Because it is present in large concentrations (4 mM) in 5% com-
mercial HSA solutions, an obvious active ingredient candidate in
LMWF5A is NAT. Besides the already discussed inhibitory effect on
NK1R, it is possible that metabolites of NAT also have biological effects.
This hypothesis is based on the documented biological activities of
metabolites of the amino acid tryptophan. The oxidation of tryptophan
is a complex metabolic pathway that results in the production of ky-
nurenine (KYN) and associated biologically active molecules [14].
Additionally, tryptophan metabolites have certain redox properties
making them important in aging and neurodegenerative processes [15].
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to characterize LMWF5A using
LCMS-MS to identify non-enzymatic breakdown products of NAT. Ad-
ditionally, the anti-inflammatory effect of LMWF5A and a synthetic
NAT breakdown product, N-acetyl kynurenine (NAK), will be assessed
using differentiated THP-1 macrophages stimulated with LPS with
special emphasis on the involvement of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AhR) in the mode of action of LMWF5A.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
5% human serum albumin (HSA) (Octapharma, Hoboken, NJ) was
used for the production of LMWF5A. LCMS solvents were purchased
from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride
(10 ml saline injection syringe flush, USP) was obtained from Excelsior
Medical (Neptune, NJ, USA). All cell culture reagents were obtained
from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). A 1 mg/ml PMA stock
was made in DMSO, and a 1 mg/ml LPS (O55:B5) stock was made in
non-supplemented RPMI 1640 media. N-acetyl kynurenine (NAK) was
synthesized by IsoSciences (King of Prussia, PA). All other reagents
were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise stated.
2.2. Collection of LMWF5A
LMWF5A was isolated by Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Englewood,
CO, USA) using a tangential flow filtration (TFF) process with a 5 kDa
MWCO PVDF filter membrane (Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH,
Germany). In accordance with cGMP guidelines, the isolation process
involved the removal of the > 5 kDa component (primarily HSA) and
the aseptic filling of sterile glass vials with 4.2 ml LMWF5A. Each vial
was sealed with a rubber stopper and a proper metal closure. The vials
were stored in the dark at ambient temperature.
2.3. LCMS Analysis of LMWF5A
LMWF5A was injected on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column
(Waters, Milford, MA, USA) connected to an Acquity H-Class liquid
chromatography system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and Xevo G2S
tandem mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Starting mobile
phase conditions consisted of 99% HPLC-grade water with 0.1% TFA
(Solvent A) and 1% acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA (Solvent B) at a flow
rate of 0.5 ml/min. The gradient was adjusted to 40% Solvent A and
60% Solvent B during the 25 min run. A 5 min equilibration was in-
cluded to return to starting conditions. MS survey conditions consisted
of capillary (2.5 kV), sampling cone
(30 V), source
temperature
(110 °C), desolvation temperature (500 °C), cone gas (150 L/h), deso-
lvation gas (850 L/h) and collision energy (6 V). Accurate mass de-
termination was accomplished using leucine enkephalin. MS-MS was
performed using the same conditions as the LCMS settings above except
the collision energy was set at 15 V.
2.4. THP-1 cell differentiation and dosing
All cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Suspensions of
human THP-1 monocytes (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were initially cultured
in 75 cm2 flasks at 2–3 × 105/ml in RPMI 1640 media supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/ streptomycin (Pen/
Strep). Cells were counted with trypan blue, and 1 × 105cells were
added to each well of a 96-well flat bottom plate. 50 ng/ml (final)
phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate (PMA) was added to all wells.
Dosing solutions consisted of 2 × dilutions of LMWF5A or 200 µM
NAK in saline. Since the starting solutions are saline-based, the dosing
solutions were diluted 1:1 with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20%
FCS, 2% Pen/Strep, 1% L-glutamine, 1% sodium bicarbonate, 1% so-
dium pyruvate, and 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA). After 3 days
of differentiation with PMA, the media was aspirated from each well.
To triplicate wells, 200 µl of the appropriate dosing solution was added
with or without the AhR antagonist (CH223191, final concentration of
10 µM) and incubated for 1 h. 20 µl of 1.1 µg/ml LPS (final = 100 ng/
ml) was added to all wells and incubated overnight.
2.5. qPCR Toll-like receptor signaling pathway array
In 25 cm2 flasks, 3 × 105/cm2 THP-1 cells were plated and differ-
entiated as described above in Section 2.4 scaling up to 10 ml total
volume. Flasks were dosed and stimulated scaling up to 8.8 ml total
volume (8 ml 2 × diluted LMWF5A + 0.8 ml 1.1 µg/ml LPS). After the
overnight incubation, media was aspirated from all flasks. RNA was
isolated from each flask using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit and QIAshredder
spin columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 0.5 µg of total RNA was then
reverse transcribed into cDNA with QuantiTect kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). 4.25 ng cDNA was added to each well of a 96-well RT2
Profiler PCR Array for the Human Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Pathway
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Real time (RT) PCR was performed using a
480 Lightcycler (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Relative gene
expression was calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCT)
method versus LPS only with normalization to internal controls (actin,
β − 2-microglobulin, and GAPDH).

 2.6. ELISA for Biomarkers of Inflammation
After an overnight LPS stimulation, supernatants were collected and
analyzed by ELISA for IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and CXCL-10 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA).
2.7. Data analysis
For the qPCR data, fold-change (2^(-ΔΔCT)) is the normalized gene
expression (2^(-ΔCT)) in the Test Sample divided by the normalized
gene expression (2^(-ΔCT)) in the Control Sample. Fold-regulation re-
presents fold-change results in a biologically meaningful way. A Fold-
change value > 1 indicates a positive- or an up-regulation, and the
fold-regulation is equal to the fold-change. Fold-change values less than
one indicate a negative or down-regulation, and the fold-regulation is
the negative inverse of the fold-change.
A Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test was applied to all data sets
with statistical significance accepted at α < 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. LCMS analysis of LMWF5A
A peak corresponding to the molecular mass of NAK ([M+] =
251.10) was identified in LMWF5A. MS-MS was performed to obtain
structural information (Fig. 1A). To determine if this molecule is
structurally related to kynurenine (KYN), synthetic KYN was also sub-
jected to the same MS-MS conditions at [M+ ] = 209.09 (Fig. 1B). The
two spectra show strong similarities in that major fragment peaks are
observed at m/z of 192.06, 174.05, 146.06, 120.04, and 94.06. These
fragments are presented within the dashed box in Fig. 1C. Also, the
mass of the parent peak of KYN (m/z 209.09) was observed in Fig. 1A
indicating that the acetyl group is cleaved from NAK under these MS-
MS conditions.
Significant differences between the two MS-MS spectra at m/z of
158.04, 130.05, 88.03, and 70.02 were observed for NAK (Fig. 1A). For
the mass fragments at m/z of 158.04 and 130.05, these correspond to
fragments that still contain the N-acetyl group thereby strongly sug-
gesting that the parent compound is NAK (Fig. 1C – solid box). The
mass fragment at m/z of 88.03 is also present in the KYN spectra at
much lower intensity. This fragment does not contain the N-acetyl
group, but it is more intense in the NAK spectra likely due to the spe-
cific MS conditions. The same argument can be made for the mass
fragment at m/z 70.02. Additionally, a synthetic standard of NAK was
analyzed by LCMS and shown to be structurally identical to [M+ ]
= 251.10 identified in LMWF5A (data not shown). Finally, an average
concentration of 200 µM NAK was quantified in multiple lots of
LMWF5A (data not shown) and therefore used in determining the
proper NAK concentration for dosing differentiated THP-1 macro-
phages.
3.2. Effect of LMWF5A on Toll-like receptor signaling pathway
Human THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophages by
treating with PMA. Macrophages were then stimulated overnight with
LPS in the presence of saline or 2 × diluted LMWF5A (N = 3). RNA was
isolated from each flask and then reversed transcribed into cDNA prior
to addition to a 96-well RT-qPCR array specific for the Toll-like receptor
signaling pathway. A minimum threshold of a 4-fold change was ap-
plied to the PCR data. Transcription of mRNA for IL-6 and CXCL-10
significantly decreased 16.3-fold ( ± 0.5) and 19.3-fold ( ± 3.8), re-
spectively (Fig. 2). IL-12A mRNA also significantly decreased 4.2-fold
( ± 1.9) while mRNA for the Toll-like receptors TLR3 and TLR7 sig-
nificantly decreased 4.1-fold ( ± 0.5) and 10.5-fold ( ± 1.3), respec-
tively (Fig. 2). No significant changes were observed in unstimulated
macrophages regardless of treatment type (data not shown).
3.3. Effect of LMWF5A on released markers of inflammation
Differentiated THP-1 macrophages were stimulated overnight in
triplicate wells with 100 ng/ml LPS in the presence of saline or a
manufactured lot of LMWF5A (3 lots total). Supernatants were collected
and tested on 3 separate experiments for IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and CXCL-
10 release by commercially available ELISA kits. IL-6 release sig-
nificantly decreased by 49% in LPS-stimulated differentiated THP-1
cells treated with LMWF5A (Table). An anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-
10) significantly increased by 2.3-fold while IL-12 release significantly
decreased by 45% when treated with LMWF5A (Table). Finally, the
release of the pro-inflammatory chemokine CXCL-10 demonstrated a
statistically significant 62% decrease after LMWF5A treatment (Table).
Differentiated THP-1 macrophages were stimulated overnight in
triplicate wells with LPS in the presence of 1:2 serial dilutions of
LMWF5A or NAK (starting [NAK] = 200 µM) with or without the AhR
antagonist (10 µM CH223191). Supernatants were tested on 3 separate
experiments for IL-6 and CXCL-10 release using commercially available
ELISA kits. IL-6 release significantly decreased (p < 0.05) by 50–70%
in LPS-stimulated differentiated THP-1 macrophages treated with serial
dilutions of LMWF5A versus saline (Fig. 3A). Serial dilutions of NAK
caused a dose-response significant decrease (p < 0.05) in IL-6 release
with a maximum inhibition of 50% observed at the highest NAK con-
centration (Fig. 3A). The AhR antagonist partially blocked the IL-6 ef-
fect at higher dilutions of LMWF5A while significantly blocking
(p < 0.05) the effect of NAK (Fig. 3A). The release of the chemokine
CXCL-10 was also significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) by LMWF5A and
NAK versus saline (Fig. 3B). However, the AhR antagonist had no effect
on this inhibition. No significant changes were observed in IL-6 or
CXCL-10 release from unstimulated macrophages regardless of treat-
ment type (data not shown).
3.4. Additional breakdown products of NAT in LMWF5A
In addition to NAK, other significant NAT breakdown components
of LMWF5A were identified by LCMS. These observed peaks might
correspond to N-acetyl formylkynurenine (m/z 279.09) and 3-hydroxy-
N-acetyl kynurenine (m/z 267.09) (Fig. 4). Accelerated aging increases
the production of NAK in LMWF5A. The mass (m/z 279.09) corre-
sponding to N-acetyl formylkynurenine, the precursor to NAK, increases
by 20–25% with heat (80 °C, 1 week) indicating that formation of this
degradation product of NAT can be achieved non-enzymatically. The
mass (m/z 267.09) corresponding to 3-hydroxy-N-acetyl kynurenine, a
product of NAK metabolism, is present in LMWF5A (Fig. 4). However,
this mass does not increase with heat indicating that the formation of
this degradation product is probably only achieved with an enzyme
(kynurenine 3-mono-oxygenase, KMO).
4. Discussion
NAT is added at a concentration of 4 mM to 5% commercial solu-
tions of HSA for the purpose of stabilizing the protein during the pas-
teurization process [16]. It has been postulated that NAT provides a
protective effect on the free sulfhydryl group (Cys-34) of HSA thereby
diminishing protein oxidation [17]. As a result of this anti-oxidant ef-
fect, the oxidative breakdown of NAT in commercial solutions of HSA
has been described [18]. In this study, the low molecular weight frac-
tion of 5% HSA (LMWF5A) was shown to contain breakdown products
of NAT. This is in agreement with a previous study that identified and
characterized NAT degradation products in HSA solutions using LCMS
methodology [11]. However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to
specifically describe the presence of NAK in a solution derived from
commercially available HSA.
It is well established that the amino acid tryptophan is susceptible to
degradation when exposed to UV light. UV exposure of tryptophan
solutions resulted in significant photodegradation with a gradual color

63
 change and generation of reactive oxygen species [19]. These de-
gradation products that caused the color change after UV exposure were
attributed to major tryptophan oxidation products such as KYN, N-
formylkynurenine, and hydroxytryptophan [20]. Although a similar
color change is observed in LMWF5A over time, it cannot be attributed
to exposure to UV rays since the solution is kept in the dark during
storage. Protecting LMWF5A from light exposure still results in the
production of NAT breakdown products suggesting a gradual, non-en-
zymatic process. This non-enzymatic process is enhanced during ther-
mally forced degradation conditions (80 °C, 1 week) resulting in an
increase in NAK and N-acetyl formylkynurenine formation in LMWF5A.
Finally, an NAT-only solution heated at 80 °C also tested positive for
kynurenine-like compounds (data not shown). This agrees with a study
that observed no oxidation of a tryptophan solution heated at high
temperature in the absence of oxygen but demonstrated first order
degradation kinetics when the thermal treatment was conducted in the
presence of oxygen [21].
It has been suggested that tryptophan metabolites act via the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) which upon activation increases the ratio
between regulatory T cells (Treg) and T helper 17 cells (Th17) thereby
modulating the immune response [22]. Not surprisingly, the tryptophan
metabolites KYN and kynurenic acid (KA) are potent AhR agonists [23].
KYN and KA were included in this study at a concentration of 250 µM
and inhibited CXCL-10 release by ~30% (data not shown). This inter-
action between kynurenine-like molecules and AhR is capable of gen-
erating immuno-suppressive T cells [24]. Finally, various studies have
suggested that AhR activation regulates immune responses via inter-
action with key components of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), an important
promoter of inflammation [25,26]. In this study, we demonstrate that
an AhR antagonist partially blocks the anti-inflammatory activity of
LMWF5A on IL-6 release in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Additionally,
NAK is an active component of LMWF5A since this compound also
significantly inhibits IL-6 release. However, NAK activity is completely
inhibited by the AhR antagonist suggesting that NAK is also an AhR
agonist. Based on these preliminary findings, activation of the AhR
pathway partially explains the mechanism of action of LMWF5A, but

fragments at m/z 192.06, 174.05, 146.06, 120.04, and 94.06. Structural differences include mass fragments at m/z 158.04, 130.05, 88.03, and 70.02 seen in the NAK
spectrum only. (C) Proposed fragment structures for the observed product ions using the LCMS-MS conditions listed in the Materials and Methods section. The

The structural differences of NAK and KYN include mass fragments at m/z 158.04, 130.05, 88.03, and 70.02 (solid box). A synthetic standard of NAK was analyzed by

 blockade of AhR has no effect on LMWF5A and inhibition of CXCL-10
release.
Macrophages are phagocytes found in essentially all tissues where a
primary function is to engulf potential pathogens. They are involved in
both innate immunity (nonspecific defense) and adaptive immunity
(memory for subsequent insults). A primary function of innate im-
munity is the recruitment of other immune cells thereby leading to
adaptive immunity. Macrophages recruit lymphocytes via the produc-
tion and release of various chemical factors. Initially, this macrophage
burst leads to inflammation characterized by pain, swelling, and fever.
However, this process is important in combating the spread of infection
thereby promoting healing and pathogen clearance. This immuno-reg-
ulatory property is partially due to the presence of moderate to high
expression levels of AhR in macrophages [27]. Activation of the AhR
pathway affects IL-6 transcription via inhibition of promoter activity
[28] and also decreases IL-6 production through suppression of hista-
mine production in macrophages stimulated with LPS [29]. No asso-
ciation was found between CXCL-10 and AhR after performing an ex-
tensive literature search. This further supports our findings that
LMWF5A through NAK inhibits IL-6 release via the AhR but inhibits
CXCL-10 release by an AhR-independent mechanism. Also, for IL-6 re-
lease, blockade of the AhR is only effective at low concentrations of
LMWF5A suggesting that other anti-inflammatory components of
LMWF5A or possibly NAT metabolism within the cell (i.e. conversion to
NAK or other kynurenine-like molecules) saturate the AhR and over-
come any AhR antagonism.
There are two main macrophage phenotypes: M1 or classically ac-
tivated macrophages, and M2 or alternatively activated macrophages.
M1 macrophages are described as “killer” macrophages, activated by
LPS, secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines
(IL6, IL-12, CXCL-10), and low levels of IL-10 [30]. M2 macrophages
and M2-like subtypes are seen as “repair” macrophages due to en-
hanced wound healing and tissue repair and can inhibit enhanced im-
mune responses thereby decreasing inflammation via the release of
high levels of IL-10 [30]. Of note, release of specific markers (IL-6, IL-
12, and CXCL-10) of M1 macrophage activation was significantly de-
creased after treatment with LMWF5A and LPS stimulation. This is in
agreement with the decrease in the transcription of these M1 activation
markers obtained by RT-qPCR. Treatment with LMWF5A also sig-
nificantly increased the release of a marker (IL-10) of M2 macrophage
activation. These findings suggest that LMWF5A not only inhibits M1
activation but potentially favors M2 activation. This partially explains
the in vivo mechanism of action for LMWF5A since inhibition of M1
macrophages and potential activation of an anti-inflammatory macro-
phage phenotype (M2) might lead to pain relief, wound healing, and
tissue remodeling.
In conclusion, breakdown products of NAT were detected in
LMWF5A with NAK being the dominant species. LMWF5A and NAK
inhibit IL-6 and CXCL-10 release from activated macrophages via an
AhR-dependent and -independent pathway, respectively. These pre-
liminary findings partially explain the mechanism of action of LMWF5A
in treating chronic conditions characterized by inflammation. Future
studies should focus on downstream targets of AhR such as the AhR
nuclear translocator (ARNT) and target genes such as CYP1A1/1B1 to
fully elucidate the role of AhR in the overall anti-inflammatory effect of
LMWF5A.

 Fig. 3. LMWF5A and NAK decrease the release of IL-6 (A) and CXCL-10 (B) in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml). Data is presented as
% change in release versus saline/LPS ± SD (N = 3). Statistical significance (α < 0.05) is indicated for LMWF5A with AhR antagonist versus LMWF5A only (*) or
for NAK with AhR antagonist versus NAK only (**).
Fig. 4. Proposed non-enzymatic breakdown of NAT in LMWF5A. Under thermal forced degradation conditions (Δ) of LMWF5A, the peak corresponding to the
molecular weight of NAK ([M+] = 251.10) significantly increases. Also, [M+ ] = 279.09 increases with thermal forced degradation conditions (80 °C, 1 week) in
LMWF5A suggesting the increased production of the precursor (N-acetyl formylkynurenine) to NAK. Finally, the mass ([M+] = 267.09) corresponding to a product
(3-hydroxy-N-acetyl kynurenine) of NAK metabolism is present in LMWF5A but did not increase with heat indicating that an enzyme (kynurenine 3-mono-oxygenase)
is necessary. The other enzymes involved in the metabolism of NAT are also included (IDO/TDO and kynurenine formamidase).
