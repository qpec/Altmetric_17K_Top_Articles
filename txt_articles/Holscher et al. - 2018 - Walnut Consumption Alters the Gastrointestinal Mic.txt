Abstract
Background: Epidemiologic data suggest that diets rich in nuts have beneficial health effects, including reducing total
and cause-specific mortality from cancer and heart disease. Although there is accumulating preclinical evidence that
walnuts beneficially affect the gastrointestinal microbiota and gut and metabolic health, these relations have not been
investigated in humans.
Objective: We aimed to assess the impact of walnut consumption on the human gastrointestinal microbiota and
metabolic markers of health.
Methods: A controlled-feeding, randomized crossover study was undertaken in healthy men and women [n = 18; mean
age = 53.1 y; body mass index (kg/m2): 28.8]. Study participants received isocaloric diets containing 0 or 42 g walnuts/d
for two 3-wk periods, with a 1-wk washout between diet periods. Fecal and blood samples were collected at baseline
and at the end of each period to assess secondary outcomes of the study, including effects of walnut consumption on
fecal microbiota and bile acids and metabolic markers of health.
Results: Compared with after the control period, walnut consumption resulted in a 49–160% higher relative abundance
of Faecalibacterium, Clostridium, Dialister, and Roseburia and 16–38% lower relative abundances of Ruminococcus,
Dorea, Oscillospira, and Bifidobacterium (P < 0.05). Fecal secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid,
were 25% and 45% lower, respectively, after the walnut treatment compared with the control treatment (P < 0.05).
Serum LDL cholesterol and the noncholesterol sterol campesterol concentrations were 7% and 6% lower, respectively,
after walnut consumption compared with after the control treatment (P < 0.01).
Conclusions: Walnut consumption affected the composition and function of the human gastrointestinal microbiota,
increasing the relative abundances of Firmicutes species in butyrate-producing Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV, includ-
ing Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, and reducing microbially derived, proinflammatory secondary bile acids and LDL
cholesterol. These results suggest that the gastrointestinal microbiota may contribute to the underlying mechanisms of
the beneficial health effects of walnut consumption. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01832909.

Introduction
The human gastrointestinal tract represents one of the most
densely populated microbial communities on earth, containing
as many microbial cells as there are human cells in the body
and >150 times more bacterial genes than the human genome
(1, 2). Among healthy adults, the large intestine contains
the densest community of microorganisms, containing up-
ward of 1011 microbial cells/g of colonic contents. Beneficial

 contributions of these microbes include salvaging energy by
metabolizing nondigestable dietary fibers to produce bu-
tyrate, a preferential metabolite for colonocytes. However, the
gastrointestinal microbiota can also contribute to deleterious ef-
fects, such as gastrointestinal and systemic inflammation and the
development of noncommunicable diseases, including obesity,
cardiovascular disease, and cancer (2–4).
Epidemiologic data suggest that a Western diet pattern, rich
in saturated fat and simple sugars and devoid of an apprecia-
ble amount of dietary fiber, is associated with increased risk of
obesity, cardiovascular disease, and colorectal and liver cancer
(5, 6). Alternatively, diets rich in nuts, a source of dietary fiber
and unsaturated fatty acids, are associated with a reduced risk
of total and cause-specific mortality from cancer and heart dis-
ease (7). Habitual dietary patterns contribute to the composition
and function of the human gastrointestinal microbiome (8). Im-
portantly, short-term changes in diet can alter the microbiome:
switching from a vegetarian diet to a diet high in saturated fat
and processed meats rapidly (within 2–4 d) changed fecal mi-
crobial profiles, reduced fecal butyrate concentrations, and in-
creased bile acid secretion in healthy adults (8, 9). Although the
consumption of dietary fiber and prebiotics have been shown
to differentially affect the human gastrointestinal microbiome
(10–12), there is a dearth of knowledge on the impact of spe-
cific whole foods on the human microbiota.
Previously, a complete feeding trial that used a randomized
controlled crossover design was completed to determine the me-
tabolizable energy of walnuts when consumed as part of a typ-
ical American diet (13). The metabolizable energy of walnuts
was 21% lower than that predicted by the Atwater values be-
cause of reduced digestibility of macronutrients. Because the nu-
trients that escape digestion in the small intestine enter the large
intestine and provide substrates for fermentation by colonic mi-
crobiota, our objective was to elucidate the effects of the re-
duced digestibility of walnuts on the fecal microbiota, fecal bile
acids, and metabolic markers of health in healthy adults.
Methods
This
study
is
a
follow-up
to
a
previously
conducted
trial
(www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01832909). Details of the design and
results of the primary study, which assessed the metabolizable en-
ergy of walnuts by using bomb calorimetry of diets, walnuts, fecal,
and urine samples, were reported elsewhere (13). Herein, secondary
outcomes, including fecal microbiota and bile acid concentrations,
and metabolic health variables are reported. Briefly, a randomized,
crossover, controlled-feeding study with two 3-wk dietary interventions
was conducted at the Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center. The
fully controlled dietary feeding intervention provided the same base diet
during each treatment condition; the base diet was unsupplemented
during the control condition and supplemented with 1.5 servings
(42 g) of walnut halves and pieces daily during the walnut treatment
condition. This amount is consistent with the FDA qualified health
claim for walnut consumption on coronary artery disease. The base
diet provided 17% of energy from protein, 29% of energy from fat,
and 54% of energy from carbohydrates. The base diet foods were
Supported by the USDA Agricultural Research Service and the California Walnut
Commission.

reduced in equal proportions during the walnut treatment condition
to achieve isocaloric food intake during the 2 diet periods. Diets were
scaled according to the energy requirements of the study participants
for weight maintenance throughout the study. Participants completed
both of the dietary intervention conditions with a 1-wk compliance
break between each condition. The treatment order was randomized by
dividing participants by sex and by using a random-number generator.
Participants completed daily questionnaires for dietary deviations,
medications, unusual exercise, and general well-being.
Participants. Study participants were recruited from the Washing-
ton, DC area. Interested volunteers completed a health history ques-
tionnaire; were measured for height, weight, and blood pressure; and
provided fasting blood and urine samples for the analysis of lipids, glu-
cose, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and complete blood count and
urinalysis. Potential volunteers were excluded for any of the following
reasons: <25 or >75 y of age, BMI (kg/m2) of <20 or >38, fasting
glucose ≥126 mg/dL, blood pressure ≥160/100 mm Hg, fasting total
serum blood cholesterol ≥280 mg/dL, and fasting serum TGs ≥300
mg/dL; if they were smokers or allergic to walnuts; if they abused al-
cohol; if they had kidney disease, liver disease, gout, hyperthyroidism,
untreated or unstable hypothyroidism, certain cancers, gastrointestinal
disease,pancreatic disease,diabetes requiring medication,unstable body
weight over the past 12 mo, malabsorption syndrome; or if they were
women who were pregnant, lactating, or had given birth in the past 12
mo. All of the study procedures were reviewed and approved by the In-
stitutional Review Board of the Medstar Research Institute and were in
accord with the Declaration of Helsinki. All of the participants provided
written consent forms.
Sample collection and analyses. Blood samples were collected
at the beginning and end of each treatment condition after a 12-h
overnight fast. Serum samples were assayed to assess total cholesterol,
LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, TGs, and glucose by using enzymatic
procedures (Vitros 5,1; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.); and inflamma-
tory markers (IL-6, C-reactive protein [CRP], serum amyloid A [SAA],
soluble adhesion molecules [soluble intercellular adhesion molecule
(sICAM) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM)]) were
measured by using sandwich-type immunoassay methods (Meso Scien-
tific Discovery). Plasma noncholesterol sterol (squalene, desmosterol,
lathosterol, cholestenol, campesterol, and β-sitosterol) concentrations
were quantified by GC and expressed relative to total cholesterol (14,
15).
Fecal samples were collected at the beginning and end of each dietary
period. Upon collection, samples were homogenized in a bag, placed in
aliquots, and stored at –80°C at the Beltsville Human Nutrition Re-
search Center before overnight shipping on dry ice to the University of
Illinois. Fecal DNA was isolated with the use of a PowerLyzer Power-
Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories) according to the man-
ufacturer’
s instructions. Bacterial (16S V4 region, 505f/806r) (16), ar-
chaeal (349f/806r), and fungal (ITS1–ITS4) (17) genes were amplified
on a Fluidigm Access Array then sequenced on a MiSeq with the use of
v3 reagents (Illumina, Inc.) in the WM Keck Center for Biotechnology,
University of Illinois, as previously described (18).
Sequence data were analyzed with QIIME 1.8.0; sequences were
clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with the use of
closed reference OTU picking against the 13-8 Greengenes database
(97% similarity) for the bacterial and archaeal sequences (19). Fungal
OTUs were generated with the use of the open reference OTU-picking
algorithm against the UNITE OTUs ITS 12_11 reference database. Ad-
ditional quality filtering (20) was undertaken before rarefying the bacte-
rial sequences to an even sampling depth of 35,957 sequences/sample to
assess α and β diversity measures as well as the impact of treatment on
OTU relative abundances. Predicted bacterial functional capacity was
assessed with the use of PICRUSt, version 1.1.1, and the KEGG Path-
way Database (21).
Freeze-dried fecal aliquots were shipped overnight to the Jean Mayer
USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University
for analysis of bile acids. Briefly, total lipids were extracted overnight
by using a modified Folch method (22) with nor-deoxycholic acid

(0.4 μg/μL; Steraloids) as the internal standard. Samples were analyzed
on an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-
of-flight mass spectrometry UHPLC-QTOF MS (Agilent Technologies)
equipped with a 1290 series LC system and a 6550 iFunnel QTOF MS
detector. Samples were injected onto the column (Zorbax Eclipse Plus
C18; 2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8 μm) maintained at 25°C, and the bile acids
eluted with the use of a 40-min isocratic mobile phase at 0.25 mL/min,
from 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.1% ammonium hydroxide in
100% methanol (pH = 7.5). The primary (cholic and chenodeoxycholic
acids) and secondary (lithocholic and deoxycholic acids) bile acids
were identified on the basis of molecular formula, retention times, and
mass (MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software) and quantified (mi-
crograms per milligram) with the use of the respective standard curves.
Interassay CVs were 1.9% for cholic acid, 5.4% for chenodeoxycholic
acid, 2.4% for deoxycholic acid and 4.5% for lithocholic acid.
Statistical analysis. Differences in serum (lipids, glucose, inflam-
matory markers, and sterols) and fecal (microbial abundances and
bile acids) measures at the end of each dietary treatment period
were analyzed with the use of a mixed-effects ANOVA with treat-
ment as the fixed effect and participant and period as the random
effects. Statistical analysis was conducted in SAS version 9.4 (SAS
Institute, Inc.). The UNIVARIATE procedure and Shapiro-Wilk statis-
tic were used to test for data normality, and logarithmic transfor-
mations were utilized as needed. Changes from baseline scores were
calculated in the walnut group to assess relations between change in
bacterial abundances and change in serum cholesterol concentrations.
Bivariate correlations were conducted to assess the relations between
bacterial abundances and secondary bile acid concentrations at the end
of the walnut consumption period. Pearson’
s correlations were used for
normally distributed variables and Spearman correlation for nonnor-
mally distributed variables. Wilcoxon’
s rank-sum tests were conducted
to compare predicted bacterial butanoate metabolism (KEGG 00650)
and secondary bile acid biosynthesis (KEGG 00121) gene counts at the
end of the walnut and control periods. Linear discriminant analysis ef-
fect size (LEfSE; Galaxy version 1.0) was used to assess KEGG Path-
way Hierarchy Level 2 and 3 metabolism data. For all of the analyses,
P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant and P ≤ 0.10 was considered to be
a trend.
Results
All 18 participants, 10 men and 8 women, who were randomly
assigned completed the study (Supplemental Figure 1). Partic-
ipants had a mean ± SEM BMI of 28.8 ± 0.9 and were aged
53.1 ± 2.2 y (Table 1).
The mean ± SD bacterial OTU was 88,880 ± 47,427,
with a maximum of 288,079 counts and a minimum of
35,957 counts/sample. At the phylum level, the majority of
sequences were dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and
Actinobacteria (84.4%, 6.5%, and 5.4%, respectively). Thirty-
five families were identified. Six families (Lachnospiraceae,
Ruminococcaceae, an undefined family in the Clostridales

period (Table 2). The number of predicted bacterial butanoate
metabolism genes was not different at the end of the walnut
period (488,366 ± 168,601) compared with after the control
period (570,743 ± 151,243) (P = 0.11).
Primary bile acids were not affected by treatment. Micro-
bially derived secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid and litho-
cholic acid, were reduced by 25% and 45%, respectively, in the
walnut group compared with the control (P < 0.01) (Table 3).
The number of predicted bacterial biosynthesis of secondary
bile acids genes tended (P = 0.09) to be lower at the end of the
walnut period (36,331 ± 12,256) than at the end of the control
period (42,714 ± 11,605).
Serum total cholesterol concentrations were lower (P = 0.03)
by 7 mg/dL (4% reduction) and LDL-cholesterol concentrations
were lower (P < 0.01) by 9 mg/dL (7% reduction) after wal-
nut consumption compared with the control (Table 4). Other
metabolic variables were unaffected by walnut consumption.
Serum campesterol was lower (P = 0.01) by 10 μmol/mmol (6%
reduction), and lathosterol concentrations tended to be lower
(P = 0.06) during the walnut period compared with the con-
trol (Table 5). There were no associations between the change
in total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol and microbes affected
by walnut consumption (Table 6). Lithocholic acid concentra-
tions were positively associated with the relative abundances
of Dorea (r = 0.46, P = 0.05) (Figure 1A) at the end of the
walnut treatment period and tended to be negatively associated
with Roseburia (r = −0.42, P = 0.08) (Figure 1B). There were
no associations between deoxycholic acid concentrations and
bacteria affected by walnut consumption (Table 7). Other pre-
dicted bacterial metabolism gene counts were unaffected by
walnut consumption (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the im-
pact of walnut consumption on the human fecal microbiota
and bacterial metabolites and metabolic health. Specifically, in
a completely controlled dietary intervention, the addition of
42 g walnut halves/d increased the relative abundance of Fir-
micutes species in the Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV, in-
cluding Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Clostridium. These
results are supported by preclinical studies indicating that wal-
nuts increased the relative abundances of Firmicutes, includ-
ing the genera Clostridium (23) and Roseburia (24). In vitro
work has shown that Faecalibacterium and Roseburia spp. dis-
play butyryl CoA:acetate CoA transferase activity and ferment
fiber to produce butyrate (25–27). Although in vitro fermen-
tation of walnuts has not been investigated to our knowledge,
finely ground almonds have been shown to increase butyrate
concentrations in vitro (28). However, because our results also
showed a reduction in the relative abundance of Bifidobacteria,
a microbe that produces acetate, a necessary metabolite for bu-
tyrate production through butyryl CoA:acetate CoA transferase
enzyme activity, walnut consumption may not have resulted in
an overall increase in butyrate concentrations. Furthermore, our
results showed that there was not a significant difference in pre-
dicted bacterial butyrate metabolism gene abundances between
the walnut and control groups. Additional in vitro and in vivo
research is necessary to determine if walnuts increase micro-
bial butyrate production and gastrointestinal butyrate concen-
tration, respectively.
The human liver synthesizes 2 primary bile acids, cholic acid
and chenodeoxycholic acid, which are converted to secondary
bile acids—deoxycholic and lithocholic acid, respectively—
by intestinal bacteria (29). Western diets, which are rich in

saturated fat and low in dietary fiber, result in increased
amounts of secondary bile acids in the colon and biliary pool
(30), and evidence suggests that deoxycholic and lithocholic
acids are toxic bile acids associated with gastrointestinal dis-
eases and colon cancer (31, 32). The gastrointestinal microbiota
has been shown to regulate the metabolism and synthesis of
bile acids via the nuclear bile acid receptor farnesoid X recep-
tor (33). Dietary fatty acid composition has also been shown to
differentially affect the interactions between bile acids and the
gastrointestinal microbiota (34). Herein, we report significant
reductions in microbially derived, proinflammatory secondary
bile acids (e.g., deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid) after wal-
nut consumption, and a trend for a reduction in predicted bac-
terial secondary bile acid biosynthesis gene abundances in the
walnut group compared with the control group (P = 0.09).
Both reduced secondary bile acid concentrations and increased
Faecalibacterium have been shown to reduce gut inflammation
(31, 35). Furthermore, a rodent study showed that walnut con-
sumption reduces colon tumor development and size and led to
changes in the cecal microbiota (36). Thus, the findings in this
report provide additional support for the connections between
diet, the gastrointestinal microbiota, and colonic health.
Related to the effects on walnut consumption on cardiovas-
cular health, similar to previous reports our results show that
walnut consumption reduced total and LDL-cholesterol con-
centrations (37). Although walnut consumption reduced total

and LDL-cholesterol concentrations and changed the composi-
tion of the fecal microbiota, there were no significant relations
between microbes affected by walnut consumption and total
and LDL cholesterol. These results suggest that total and LDL
cholesterol are not directly related to gastrointestinal microbes,
which is consistent with a cross-sectional study in 893 subjects
that reported that neither LDL cholesterol nor total cholesterol
were related to the microbiota (5, 6). Interestingly, Dorea and
Roseburia tended to be related to the concentration of the sec-
ondary bile acid lithocholic acid, suggesting that the associa-
tions between the gastrointestinal microbiota and cardiovascu-
lar health may be related to the microbial metabolism of bile
acids and subsequent signally through farnesoid X receptor.
PUFAs have antimicrobial properties, including the inhibi-
tion of bacterial FA synthesis (38), growth, and mucus adhesion
(39). n–3 FA supplementation modulated rodent fecal micro-
biota by suppressing growth of bacteria associated with obe-
sity and inflammation (40). PUFAs can also modulate the gas-
trointestinal microbiota due to differing abilities of bacteria to
metabolize long-chain FAs. For example, in vitro studies have
shown that Roseburia spp. are involved in the process of con-
verting linoleic acid to its conjugated form (41–43). Thus, the
increase in Roseburia in the present study may be related to its
ability to metabolize FAs.
In addition to providing a source of fiber and unsaturated
FAs, walnuts are also high in ellagic acid. Gastrointestinal bacte-
ria can metabolize ellagic acid to produce urolithins, which can
enter the enterohepatic circulation and have anti-inflammatory
and beneficial vascular effects (44–46). Walnut extract, includ-
ing polyphenols and ellagic acid, has shown positive effects on
endothelial health in vitro (47). To our knowledge, studies have
only investigated the effects of walnut, tree nut, and polyphe-
nol consumption on either the presence of urolithin byprod-
ucts through urinalysis or the microbiome through analysis of
fecal samples (48, 49), whereas little is known about the roles
of specific bacteria on polyphenol metabolism and urolithin
production. Fermentation of pomegranate tannins including el-
lagic acid in vitro resulted in increased microbial fermentation,
thereby reducing pH (50). Others have shown that Bifidobac-
terium fragilis is inhibited by the presence of ellagic acid (50),
which could explain the decrease in the relative abundance
of Bifidobacterium spp. after the walnut diet condition in the
present study.
Although the age range for this study population was
fairly broad (35–68 y), 13 of the 18 participants were aged
≥50 y. Thus, the characteristics of the microbiota would gen-
erally be reflective of a slightly older population. Because

 Faecalibacterium and Roseburia have been reported to be neg-
atively associated with age and Oscillospira to be positively as-
sociated with age (51, 52), the consumption of walnuts may
help to slow age-related changes in the microbiota. However,
because semi-supercentenarians show enriched Bifidobacterium
(52), and walnut consumption reduced the relative abundance
of Bifidobacterium, additional research is necessary to assess the
effects of walnut consumption and the microbiota in the context
of aging.
The strength of this study is the use of a complete feeding,
randomized, controlled crossover trial with a washout period
to assess the impact of walnut consumption on physiologic and
microbiological outcomes among human subjects. Study limi-
tations include the lack of fecal fermentative end products, in-
cluding short-chain FAs, and metagenomic analyses to assess the
functional capacity of the microbiota.
In summary, walnut consumption affected the gastrointesti-
nal microbiota and microbially derived secondary bile acids
and reduced serum total and LDL cholesterol in healthy adults.
These results suggest that the gastrointestinal microbiota may
contribute to the underlying mechanisms of the beneficial health
effects of walnut consumption, including cardiometabolic and
gastrointestinal health.
