iabetes mellitus is a major health prob-
lem worldwide and is associated with in-
creased morbidity, mortality, life expec-
tancy and health care costs.1–4 The prevalence of 
diabetes in Canada has increased more than two-
fold over the past decade.5 Currently, the disease 
affects almost 2.4 million Canadians,6 and its 
management, along with that of associated com-
plications, costs more than $9 billion annually.7 
The burden of diabetes is particularly high among 
First Nations people in Canada, with prevalence 
rates 3–5 times higher than those among non–
First Nations people.8
Reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes will 
require a broad set of population-based and indi-
vidual-level interventions that target diabetogenic 
aspects of lifestyle, as well as social determinants 
of health. The changes required to achieve these 
objectives will need buy-in from a wide range of 
stakeholders. Thus, it will be important to com-
municate risk in a way that is understood by the 
general population and by health authorities. 
Although estimates of incidence and preva-
lence provide important information about the 
burden of a disease in the community, they do 
not provide adequate information regarding the 
perspective of risk at the individual level. Life-
time risk (the probability of a disease-free indi-
vidual developing the disease during his or her 
remaining lifespan) may be more informative for 
the general population and for decision-makers. 
Life-table modelling techniques use incidence 
and mortality data to estimate the lifetime risk of 
diabetes. This important assessment of the dis-
ease burden of diabetes has been undertaken in a 
few studies,9–11 but it has not been done in Can-
ada. The need for such estimates is particularly 
relevant given the higher prevalence of diabetes 
among First Nations people in Canada.
We estimated the lifetime risk of diabetes 
among men and women in both First Nations 
and non–First Nations populations using a co-
hort of adults residing in a single Canadian 
province.

Background: Lifetime risk is a relatively straight-
forward measure used to communicate disease 
burden, representing the cumulative risk of an 
outcome during the remainder of an individu-
al’s life starting from a disease-free index age. 
We estimated the lifetime risk of diabetes 
among men and women in both First Nations 
and non–First Nations populations using a 
cohort of adults in a single Canadian province.
Methods: We used a population-based cohort 
consisting of Alberta residents from 1997 to 
2008 who were free of diabetes at cohort 
entry to estimate the lifetime risk of diabetes 
among First Nations and non–First Nations 
people. We calculated age-specific incidence 
rates with the person-year method in 5-year 
bands. We estimated the sex- and index-age–
specific lifetime risk of incident diabetes, after 
adjusting for the competing risk of death.
Results: The cohort included 70 631 First 
Nations and 2 732 214 non–First Nations people 
aged 18 years or older. The lifetime risk of 
diabetes at 20 years of age was 75.6% 
among men and 87.3% among women in the 
First Nations group, as compared with 55.6% 
among men and 46.5% among women in the 
non–First Nations group. The risk was higher 
among First Nations people than among 
non–First Nations people for all index ages 
and for both sexes. Among non–First Nations 
people, men had a higher lifetime risk of dia-
betes than women across all index ages. In 
contrast, among First Nations people, women 
had a higher lifetime risk than men across all 
index ages.
Interpretation: About 8 in 10 First Nations 
people and about 5 in 10 non–First Nations 
people of young age will develop diabetes in 
their remaining lifetime. These population-
based estimates may help health care plan-
ners and decision-makers set priorities and 
increase public awareness and interest in the 
prevention of diabetes.

Methods
Study population
All residents of the province of Alberta are eligi-
ble for insurance coverage by Alberta Health, 
and more than 99% participate in this coverage. 
We included 2 897 299 residents aged 18 years 
or older (1 436 324 men and 1 460 975 women) 
who were registered with Alberta Health 
between Apr. 1, 1997, and Mar. 31, 2008. Each 
person’s first encounter date with Alberta Health 
was considered the study entry date. We 
excluded those who had diabetes at cohort entry.
Classification of First Nations status
We determined participants’ First Nations status 
from an indicator variable in the Alberta Health 
Registry file, which identifies people registered 
with Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Develop-
ment Canada under the Indian Act. A person 
with a First Nations identifier at any time during 
the study period was classified as First Nations; 
all other participants were classified as non–First 
Nations people.12 Aboriginal people in Alberta 
who were not registered within the Indian Act 
(e.g., unregistered First Nations and Metis) were 
included in the non–First Nations group. 
According to the 2011 census, about 52% of the 
Alberta Aboriginal population is registered First 
Nations.13
After Ontario and British Colombia, Alberta 
has the third largest First Nations population 
among the provinces and territories of Canada.14 
About half of the population lives on Indian 
reserves.15 More than half of First Nations people 
in Alberta are under 25 years of age, and less 
than 5% are over 64 years old; the median age is 
23 years.15 Great cultural diversity exists within 
the Albertan First Nations communities, includ-
ing a broad range of spoken languages, the most 
common being Blackfoot, Cree, Chipewyan, 
Dene, Sarcee and Stoney.15
Outcome measure
Participants were followed for the development 
of diabetes after their study entry. The diagnosis 
of diabetes was based on the previously validated 
National Diabetes Surveillance System defini-
tion.16 The case definition required 2 or more 
physician service claims for diabetes (Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision 
[ICD-9] code 250) within 2 years, or 1 or more 
hospital admissions with ICD-9 code 250 (before 
Mar. 31, 2002) or the equivalent ICD-10 (Inter-
national Statistical Classification of Disease and 
Related Health Problems, 10th Revision) codes 
E10–14 (after Mar. 31, 2002),16 selected from all 
available diagnostic codes from the administra-
tive data sources.17 This case definition has been 
reported to have 86% sensitivity, 97% specificity 
and 80% positive predictive values for identify-
ing individuals with diabetes through administra-
tive data sources.16 Death was determined from 
the Alberta Health Registry file. Participants were 
followed from their study index date to the occur-
rence of the study outcome, death, out-migration 
from Alberta or the end of the study period 
(Mar. 31, 2009).
Measurement of cohort characteristics
Socioeconomic status was categorized based on 
Statistics Canada 2001 and 2006 census data. 
Median neighbourhood household income (in 
quintiles) and residency (rural or urban) were 
identified based on census data closest to the 
study entry date of the participants.18 A diagnosis 
of hypertension was determined based on previ-
ously validated criteria.19 We identified other 
comorbid conditions among physician claims and 
hospital admission records using validated cod-
ing algorithms based on the Deyo adaptation 
(ICD-9, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] data) 
and the Quan validation (ICD-10 data) of the 
Charlson Comorbidity Index.20
Statistical analysis
We used age (in years) as the time scale. The 
index age categories started at age 20 years and 
increased by decade to age 60. Risk estimation 
began at an index age; participants who were 
younger than the index age of interest at the 
beginning of the study period entered the analysis 
when they reached the required age. For exam-
ple, for risk estimation at an index age of 20 
years, participants aged 20 years and older were 
included; those who were less than 20 years old 
at cohort entry began contributing to the risk esti-
mation when they attained the age of 20.
We estimated the cumulative incidence of 
diabetes conditional on survival to ages 20, 30, 
40, 50 and 60 years. We estimated lifetime risk 
of diabetes accounting for the competing risk of 
death. We calculated index-age–specific inci-
dence of diabetes and the lifetime risk estimates 
using a modified technique of survival analysis,21 
as in prior reported analyses.22,23 In contrast to 
the conventional Kaplan–Meier survival analysis 
(which considers individuals who die as cen-
sored observations), this modified approach con-
siders death as a competing event. 
All statistical analyses were performed using 
SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute).
Ethics approval
The Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board of 
the University of Calgary approved the study.

Results
The study cohort included 2 802 845 participants 
without a history of diabetes, 70 631 (2.5%) of 
whom had First Nations status (Figure 1). The 
mean follow-up period was 8.71 (standard devia-
tion 3.84) years. The First Nations participants 
were younger, generally had a higher prevalence 
of comorbid conditions and were more likely to 
be in a lower income quintile (Table 1). During a 
total follow-up of 23 362 108.3 person-years for 
the participants 20 years and older during the 
study, diabetes developed in 160 549 participants. 
The number of person-years of follow-up and the 
number of events (diabetes and death) across all 
age groups are presented in Appendix 1 (available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.150787/-/DC1).
Table 2 presents the lifetime risk of diabetes 
as well as the risk over 10-, 20-, 30- and 40-year 
time horizons among First Nations and non–First 
Nations men by index age. The lifetime risk of 
diabetes adjusted for competing risk of death 
among 20-year-old men was 75.6% in the First 
Nations group and 55.6% in the non–First Na-
tions group. As expected, there was a graded in-
crease in the risk of diabetes over longer time ho-
rizons for all index ages in both First Nations and 
non–First Nations groups. For example, among 
20-year-old First Nations men, the risk of diabe-
tes was 1.4%, 6.0%, 15.4%, 31.5%, 51.7% and 
68.6% over the 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, 50- and 60-
year time horizons, respectively. 
Table 3 presents the short, intermediate and 
lifetime risks of diabetes among women in the 
First Nations and non–First Nations groups. 
Among 20-year-old women, the adjusted life-
time risk was 87.3% in the First Nations group 
and 46.5% in the non–First Nations group. The 
lifetime risk of diabetes was lower among 
women than among men in all index age catego-
ries in the non–First Nations group. In contrast, 
First Nations women had a higher lifetime risk 
of diabetes than First Nations men in all index 
age categories (Tables 2 and 3). Again, a graded 
increase in diabetes risk with increasing time ho-
rizon was consistently observed among women 
in both the First Nations and non–First Nations 
groups (Figure 2).
The lifetime risk estimates of diabetes among 
men and women by location of residence (urban 
or rural) are presented in Appendix 2 (available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj 
.150787/-/DC1). The estimates among First Na-
tions men and women were consistently higher 
than those among their non–First Nations coun-
terparts across both urban and rural locations. In 
the First Nations group, the lifetime risk of dia-
betes was notably higher among those living in

rural locations than among those in urban areas. 
This difference was strikingly prominent among 
women. For example, 20-year-old First Nations 
women in rural areas had a lifetime risk of 
94.2%, as compared with 80.4% among their 
counterparts in urban locations. In contrast, non–
First Nations men and women in urban locations 
had slightly higher lifetime risks of diabetes than 
their rural counterparts.
Interpretation
We estimated the lifetime risk of diabetes among 
First Nations and non–First Nations people in a 
population-based cohort of nearly 3 million people 
from a provincial health registry. The observed 
probabilities suggest that about 5 in 10 non–First 
Nations men and women of young age will de-
velop diabetes in their lifetime. The lifetime risk 
was much higher in the First Nations population 
(about 7 in 10 men and 9 in 10 women).
In our study, men had a higher lifetime risk of 
diabetes than women of similar age strata in the 
non–First Nations group. In contrast, women had a 
higher lifetime risk than men in the First Nations 
group. This observation likely reflects the fact that 
the incidence of diabetes is higher among First 
Nations women than among First Nations men in 
Canada.24 That women in First Nations communi-
ties are more likely to be overweight or obese than 
the men, and at a younger age,25 would explain this 
disparity to some extent. Also, there are high rates 
of gestational diabetes among pregnant Aboriginal 
women who develop type 2 diabetes later in life.26
Irrespective of urban or rural location of resi-
dence, we observed a higher lifetime risk of dia-
betes among First Nations people than among 
non–First nations people. However, in the First 
Nations group, the lifetime risk was higher 
among those living in rural communities than 
among those in urban areas. This difference was 
striking among First Nations women. Access to 
care and geographic factors, which have been 
identified as important determinants of health for 
indigenous people,27 may be contributing to the 
higher observed risk.28
We also observed that the First Nations group 
reached a higher risk of diabetes at a much 
younger age than the non–First Nations group. The 
cumulative risk of diabetes among young First Na-
tions men overtook the lifetime risk among non–
First Nations men by about 20 years earlier. 
Among First Nations women, this happened about 
30 years earlier. These findings coupled with the 
observations that younger people had a higher life-
time risk of diabetes than their older counterparts 
indicates the importance of early mobilization of 
preventive measures against the development of 
diabetes among First Nations people.
Reports of a similar nature were limited to 
studies in the United States11 and Australia.9 
However, the methodologic differences across 
these studies hinder direct comparison of the esti-
mates with our results. In the US study, Narayan 
and associates11 used incidence rates and mortal-
ity derived from different sources and a Markov 
chain model to estimate the lifetime risk of diabe-
tes. The authors estimated that the lifetime risk of 
diabetes among people 40 years of age was about 
3 in 10.11 They defined diabetes based on self-
reported disease status, which might have under-
estimated true diabetes rates. 
In the Austrialian study, Magliano and associ-
ates9 used the approach of building a multistate 
life table to estimate the lifetime risk of diabetes 
in an epidemiologic cohort of 5842 adults.9 The 
authors reported that the lifetime probability of

diabetes among people 26 years of age was about 
3 in 10.9 They recognized the potential limitation 
of using a single oral glucose tolerance test to 
define diabetes in their study and acknowledged 
the possibility of underestimation of the true risk. 
Our analysis used a cohort of nearly 3 mil-
lion people from a single Canadian province, 
and diabetes was defined using administrative 
data sources. We used a survival analysis 
approach to estimate the lifetime risk of diabe-
tes, with a special focus on the difference in 
risk between First Nations by non–First Nations 
people. We did not identify prior reports that 
compared estimates of lifetime risk in an 
Aboriginal population and a contemporaneous 
non-Aboriginal counterpart.
Although the lifetime risk of diabetes was high 
in both First Nations and non–First Nations 
groups, it was higher in the former. These findings 
are consistent with population-based diabetes 
reports showing higher incidence and prevalence 
of diabetes among First Nations people than 
among non–First Nations people.24,29,30 Dyck and 
associates24 reported that the incidence and preva-
lence of diabetes were more than 4 times higher 
among First Nations women than among non–
First Nations women, and more than 2.5 times 
higher among First Nations men than among non–
First Nations men. The reasons that have been 
attributed to these differences include genetic sus-
ceptibility,31–34 dietary acculturation,34,35 adoption 
of sedentary lifestyle34,36 and increasing prevalence 
of obesity and metabolic syndrome.37–39 Overall, 
the First Nations populations in Canada, and simi-
larly other indigenous groups worldwide, are vul-
nerable to developing diabetes. It also appears that 
inequities in the social, cultural, historical, eco-
nomic and political determinants of health, lack of 
access to nutritionally adequate food and barriers

to proper health care play major roles in the diabe-
tes epidemic in indigenous populations.40–43
The increase we observed in the cumulative 
risk of diabetes across the time horizons for all in-
dex age categories among both men and women 
reflected the contribution of the age time scale that 
has been reported for other chronic diseases.44–48 
We also observed that the lifetime risk decreased 
by increasing index age,  which is consistent with 
reports of lifetime risk estimation for other dis-
eases.44–48 The decrease in lifetime risk of diabetes 
with increasing age reflects the shorter life expec-
tancy and period at risk among older participants. 
Also, at older ages, competing causes of death 
will increase in importance because older people 
may not live long enough to develop diabetes, 
and people susceptible to diabetes might have de-
veloped the disease at an earlier age.
From the perspective of public health educa-
tion, the lifetime risk estimates are beneficial 
because they are more intuitive than conventional 
epidemiologic measures such as incidence, preva-
lence and relative risk.49 Problems with statistical 
numeracy or low quantitative literacy are not 
uncommon.50 Furthermore, innumeracy and diffi-
culties understanding proportions, ratios and rela-
tive risks seem to be general barriers to knowledge 
translation across all user communities in Canada. 
Indeed, one study found that patients preferred 
their health risks to be presented in absolute terms 
and that their lifetime estimate of risk be given in 
an “X in 100” format.51 In addition, merits of 
reporting lifetime risk estimates have been 
observed. For instance, the widely publicized life-
time risk of breast cancer among American 
women (estimated to be 1 in 8 [12.6%])52 is 
believed to have influenced the increase in screen-
ing mammography for early disease detection.53 
Although lifetime risk lacks the detail and pre-
cision needed for individual clinical consultation, 
the lifetime estimates presented in our study offer 
a useful and understandable summary of risk in a 
population. This will be particularly relevant to 
help researchers and policy-makers appreciate the 
population burden of diabetes.
Limitations
The strengths of our study include the use of a pop-
ulation-based cohort and data that encompassed 
diabetes and mortality. However, our reported esti-
mates need to be interpreted in light of the limita-
tions of this type of methodology.47,52,54–57 First, life-
time risk estimates are population based and reflect 
average individuals in a population. Although they 
serve as general guidelines, lifetime risk estimates 
therefore have only restricted prognostic utility at 
the patient level, where the lifetime risk would be 
influenced by individual risk factors for diabetes. 
Second, lifetime risk estimates assume a fixed 
age and demographic structure for the general 
population, as well as stable diabetes incidence 
rates and mortality. Because studies suggest that 
the incidence and prevalence of diabetes is 
increasing over time, the lifetime risk of diabetes 
may be even higher than reported here. Moreover, 
the temporal trends in life expectancy, sensitivity 
of diagnostic tests and the prevalence of risk fac-
tors could also alter the lifetime risk estimates of 
diabetes. Also, our results are based on popula-
tion-based data from Alberta; they may not be 
generalizable to other provinces in Canada. 
Third, it was not possible for us to recognize 
unregistered First Nations people, which may 
caused misclassification of some individuals in 
the non–First Nations group. Nonetheless, 
given that most of the First Nations population 
in Alberta is registered and given the size of the 
non–First Nations population in our study, we 
expect this potential misclassification to have 
minimal impact on the study estimates. 
Fourth, we did not differentiate between 
type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes. How-
ever, the major form of diabetes in the popula-
tion is type 2 diabetes, which accounts for 
90%–95% of diabetes cases in Canada.6
Conclusion
The observed probabilities indicate that 75.6% 
of First Nations men and 87.3% of First Nations 
women of young age will develop diabetes in 
their lifetime. The corresponding risk among 
non–First Nations people is about 55.6% and 
46.5%, respectively. These measures can be used 
both in assisting health care planners and deci-
sion-makers to set priorities and in increasing 
public awareness and interest in primary preven-
tion initiatives against diabetes.
