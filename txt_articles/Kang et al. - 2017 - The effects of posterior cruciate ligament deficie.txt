Objectives
The aim of the current study was to analyse the effects of posterior cruciate ligament (pcL) 
deficiency on forces of the posterolateral corner structure and on tibiofemoral (TF) and 
patellofemoral (pF) contact force under dynamic-loading conditions.
Methods
A subject-specific knee model was validated using a passive flexion experiment, electromy-
ography data, muscle activation, and previous experimental studies. The simulation was 
performed on the musculoskeletal models with and without pcL deficiency using a novel 
force-dependent kinematics method under gait- and squat-loading conditions, followed by 
probabilistic analysis for material uncertain to be considered.
Results
comparison of predicted passive flexion, posterior drawer kinematics and muscle activa-
tion with experimental measurements showed good agreement. Forces of the posterolateral 
corner structure, and TF and pF contact forces increased with pcL deficiency under gait- and 
squat-loading conditions. The rate of increase in pF contact force was the greatest during the 
squat-loading condition. The TF contact forces increased on both medial and lateral com-
partments during gait-loading conditions. However, during the squat-loading condition, 
the medial TF contact force tended to increase, while the lateral TF contact forces decreased. 
The posterolateral corner structure, which showed the greatest increase in force with defi-
ciency of pcL under both gait- and squat-loading conditions, was the popliteus tendon (pT).
Conclusion
pcL deficiency is a factor affecting the variability of force on the pT in dynamic-loading con-
ditions, and it could lead to degeneration of the pF joint.

Introduction
The posterior cruciate ligament (PCl) is a fundamental 
stabiliser of the knee joint, but its biomechanical mecha-
nism has not been fully understood or investigated.1-3 
The reported incidence of acute PCl injuries ranges from 
1% to 44% of acute knee injuries.4 isolated PCl injuries 
are less common than those with other concomitant liga-
mentous conditions.5,6 The most frequent type of injury 
associated with PCl injury is that of the posterolateral 
corner structure, leading to posterolateral rotatory insta-
bility. The approach for treating PCl injuries remains a 
controversial issue in sports medicine. The majority of cli-
nicians have reported treating PCl injuries without any 
operative interventions.7-9 medial-sided injuries, in par-
ticular, can be conservatively healed using non-operative 
treatment methods. in contrast, lateral-sided and injuries 
to the posterolateral corner structure require, and have 
been more successfully treated with, surgical repair and/
or reconstruction.10-12
Posterolateral corner structure, the injury of which 
often accompanies that of PCl, contains the lateral col-
lateral ligament (lCl), popliteus tendon (PT), and poplit-
eofibular ligament (PFl). lCl and PFl are the primary 
static stabilisers of posterolateral corner structures, and 
PT is a dynamic stabiliser of the knee joint. another issue 
associated with PCl injury is the long-term progress of 
degenerative changes in the tibiofemoral (TF) and patel-
lofemoral (PF) joints.13,14 in a previous study that included 
38 patients with a mean follow-up of 13.4 years post PCl 
injury, eight patients underwent surgery for a meniscal 
tear, and radiographic examinations revealed that the 
rate of articular cartilage degeneration increased.15
in order to understand better the mechanism under-
lying PCl deficiency, several biomechanical research 
studies have evaluated the force exerted on posterolat-
eral corner structures and contact forces on TF and PF 
joints. in previous studies, the force exerted on the PCl 
with selective cutting of posterolateral corner structure 
was evaluated.16-19 most of these studies were experi-
mental and used cadavers in quasi-static conditions, or 
in vivo studies using dual fluoroscopy.16-23 To the best 
 
of our knowledge, there have been no studies that 
 
have investigated the biomechanical effects of PCl defi-
ciency on contact forces in the TF and PF joints, and 
 
on forces exerted on posterolateral corner structures 
under dynamic-loading conditions.
The method for in vitro dynamic studies involve labo-
ratory experiments using cadavers in a physiological gait 
simulator, along with finite element analysis (Fea) and 
multibody dynamic (mBD) simulation.24-26 moreover, 
the majority of Fea studies do not include a physiological 
model associated with anatomical information of bone 
and muscles.27 recently, dynamic computational analy-
sis tools, including musculoskeletal (mSk) mBD struc-
tures, have been introduced. These technologies allow 
dynamic simulations and three-dimensional mSk model-
ling beyond statistical analyses. mSk models provide a 
practical alternative to dynamic simulation with elastic 
ligament bundles that represent the overall kinematic 
behaviour of the joint.28,29
The aim of the present study was to develop a vali-
dated subject-specific mSk lower extremity model that 
allows for 12-degree-of-freedom (DoF) motion at both 
the TF and PF joints. First, to validate the subject-specific 
mSk model, values were evaluated and compared with 
passive flexion results transformed electromyography 
(emG) measurements for the subjects’ knee joints, includ-
ing an assessment of the propagation of uncertain liga-
ment properties using probabilistic simulation, under 
gait- and squat-loading conditions. in addition, the poste-
rior drawer test result in intact and PCl deficiency condi-
tions were compared with previous experiments. Second, 
the contact forces exerted on the TF and PF joints were 
evaluated to investigate cartilage degeneration and pos-
terolateral corner structure forces in order to establish 
the biomechanical effects of PCl deficiency in gait- and 
squat-loading conditions, including an assessment of 
the propagation of uncertain ligament properties using 
probabilistic simulation.
We hypothesised that validated dynamic mechanics 
improves mSk simulation. We also hypothesised that the 
PT is the most important component of the posterolateral 
corner structure in the PCl deficiency condition as a 
dynamic stabiliser under dynamic loading conditions.
Patients and Methods
Passive flexion and eMG experiments. This study was 
approved by the hospital's institutional review Board. 
Subject-specific data were used for mSk model develop-
ment with validations using CT data in passive flexion 
and motion-capture with emG sensors.
The subject of this study was a 36-year-old man (178 
cm, 75 kg). radiological findings showed that his knee 
was normal, without any history of mSk system diseases, 
or related diseases. The knee was examined with a 0.6 
mm slice thickness using a 64-channel CT scanner 
(SomaTom Sensation 64, Siemens Healthcare, erlangen, 
Germany) with respect to six flexion angles (15°, 30°, 
45°, 60°, 75°, 90°) of the knee joint. CT images had been 
taken for six months to protect the subject from radiation 
based on the radiation dose reduction protocol that mini-
mised hazardous exposure. in each scan, CTDivol was 
11.48 mGy which is the same radiation dose in routine 
protocol.30-32 The tube parameters were 120 kvp and 135 
ma, and the acquisition matrix was 512 × 512; the field of 
view was 200 mm.

knee joint kinematics were measured based on a previ-
ous methodology and included the joint coordinate sys-
tem during passive flexion testing. 
 
33 
 Passive flexion data 
were used in validation of the mSk model. The subject 
performed four trials of gait- and squat-loading activities, 
and ground reaction forces were measured using a force 
plate. The subjects’ ground reaction forces were meas-
ured using two force plates (800 mm  
× 600 mm, amTi, 
Niles, illinois). a motion-capture system (vicon mX, 
oxford metrics, united kingdom) consisting of 11 infra-
red video cameras collected marker trajectories at a sam-
pling rate of 250 Hz. an eight-channel surface emG system 
(Bagnoli System, Delsys inc., Boston, massachusetts) was 
used to record emG signals. eight emG signals, marker 
trajectories, and analogue force plate data associated with 
gait- and squat-loading conditions were used in this 
study. The measured muscles included the gluteus maxi-
mus, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, semi-
membranosus, gastrocnemius medialis, tibialis anterior, 
and soleus medialis. raw data from the emG signals were 
transformed into muscle activation data using root mean 
square analysis. emG-to-activation model was used to 
represent the underlying muscle activation dynamics. The 
specification of emG-to-activation transformation has 
been reported in a previous study.

Subject-specific MSK model 
.  
a three-dimensional mSk 
model of the subject-specific knee joint was developed 
using the anyBody modeling System (version 6.0.6; 
anyBody Technology, aalborg, Denmark). To simplify 
the development process of an entirely subject-specific 
model, the lower extremity mSk model was extracted 
from the anyBody managed model repository (version 
1.6.4) and modified for this study. 
 
35 
 
 
The lower extremity mSk model was developed from 
the Twente lower extremity model anthropometric 
database. 
 
36 
 The mSk model was actuated by approxi-
mately 160 muscle units. This model has been validated 
by previous studies to predict muscle and joint reaction 
forces during locomotion.

 The three-dimensional

studies.

 The ligament insertion points were refer-
enced to the anatomy from the subject’s mri. 
 
Based on the subject’s three-dimensional femoral, tib-
ial, fibular, and patellar models, the scales of bone in 
anyBody were adjusted using the non-linear radial basis 
functions with a law of scaling. The remaining parts were 
adjusted with the scale using an optimisation scheme that 
minimises the difference between model markers and 
identified marker positions. in this study, the knee joint 
was considered to have 12-DoF movement (TF: 6-DoF, 
PF:6-DoF). Hip and ankle joints were considered to 
provide 2- and 3-DoF movement, respectively. 
 
The ligament attachment sites were obtained from 
the subject’s mri image. The attachment points in the 
anyBody model were modified using the subject-specific 
attachment sites. as shown in  
Figure 1 
, 21 ligament bun-
dles were modelled. The abbreviation of ligament bun-
dles are shown in  
Table i 
. These were modeled in anyBody 
using non-linear spring elements  
with the piecewise 
force 
– 
displacement relationship based on their functional 
bundles at the actual ligament anatomy.

regarding the formulae, the character f(ε) is the cur-
rent force, k is the stiffness, ε is the strain, and ε1 is 
assumed to be constant at 0.03. The ligament bundle 
slack length, l0, can be calculated from the reference bun-
dle length, lr, and the reference strain, εr, in the upright 
reference position.
most of the stiffness and reference strain values were 
obtained from the literature, but some of them have been 
modified.42-44 The menisci were modelled by linear 
springs to simulate their equivalent resistance.45 The 
wrapping surface using a cylinder and an ellipsoid was 
applied in order to prevent ligament penetration on the 
bone. Furthermore,1-3 wrapping surfaces were applied to 
each ligament to wrap the bony structure around the 
tibia, femur, and patella.
Figure 2 shows three different contact surfaces defined 
in the TF and PF joints. Three deformable contact models 
were defined between the femoral and tibial components 
and between the femoral component and patellar but-
ton. These contact forces are proportional to the penetra-
tion volume and the so-called ‘Pressure module’.44 The 
contact Pressure module in Newtons per meter cube is 
the key parameter in the default force-dependent kine-
matics computational framework of anyBody.46 Because 
the contact model implemented in anyBody very closely 
followed the elastic foundation theory, the equations 
were derived by Fregly et al.35,46 For the pressure module 
calculation, the equation derived by Fregly et al46 was 
used.
Popliteus muscle modification. The PT in posterolateral 
corner structures from anyBody was modified to mini-
mise the effects of inaccuracy (Fig. 2) in order to repre-
sent a more realistic anatomy.47,48 The default popliteus 
muscle, composed of two bundles, was modified to 
represent a third bundle. The origin was modified to 
be located on each different anatomical position as 
identified via mri. The PFl was modified so that it was 
 
connected with the popliteus muscle.

simulation 
and

condi-
tions. Before performing inverse dynamic analyses, 
the kinematics of each trial were calculated on the 
basis of motion-capture data; kinematic optimisation 
was used for this purpose. experimental ground reac-
tion forces and marker trajectories were imported 
into the anyBody mSk modelling system in order to 
calculate muscle forces based on the muscle recruit-
ment criterion (cubic polynomial used in this study) 
for inverse dynamic analysis. The objective of opti-
misation was to minimise the difference between the 
anyBody model marker trajectories and the motion- 
capture marker trajectories. after kinematic optimisation 
was completed, muscle force was evaluated through 
inverse dynamic analysis. muscle activation and liga-
ment force were calculated using inverse dynamic anal-
ysis, and muscle activations were compared with emG 
signals.
To evaluate the effect of uncertainty in ligament stiff-
ness and reference strains on knee kinematics under pas-
sive flexion, monte Carlo (mC) simulations (1000 trials) 
were performed. The isight (Simulia, Providence, rhode 
island) Simcode was used with anyBody to run the mC 
simulations. a passive flexion test condition, from full 
extension to 90° of flexion, was applied. The standard 
deviation of the linear stiffness was 30% of the ligament 
stiffness and 0.02 of the reference strain.49 Gait and squat 
simulations were performed with a subject-specific mSk 
model, which was validated using a passive flexion test

performed on the subject, and used to predict muscle 
activation (Fig. 3). The posterior tibial translations in the 
posterior drawer test under intact and PCl deficiency con-
ditions with 134 N at 30° and 90° of flexion were com-
pared with previous experimental studies.50-54 in order to 
understand the influence of PCl deficiency, the increase in 
ligament forces on the PFl, lCl, and PT were evaluated. in 
addition, the contact forces on the TF and the PF were 
evaluated. mC simulations were performed in order to 
consider uncertainty caused by differences of individual's 
material properties of ligaments. The result of PCl defi-
ciency was represented by the predicted mean value.
Results
Comparison of passive flexion, posterior drawer and 
eMG experimental results with a computational model. 
measurements of TF kinematics using flexion CT for 
passive flexion–extension movements showed consis-
tency with model predictions, generally lying within the 
uncertainty range in simulation (Fig. 4). TF translations 
and internal tibial rotation are the most sensitive fac-
tors that influence a ligament’s properties. The greatest 
 
muscle activities evaluated from the computational model 
showed consistency with transformed emG measure-
ments under gait- and squat-loading conditions (Fig. 5). 
However, there was a different trend due to an increase in 
the prediction error for the tibial anterior muscle.
in the posterior drawer test at 134 N, the intact poste-
rior tibial translations were 5.2 mm and 4.0 mm at 30° 
and 90° of knee flexion, respectively, while those in the 
PCl deficiency condition were 10.3 mm and 12.3 mm at 
30° and 90° of knee flexion, respectively (Fig. 6). For both 
the intact and PCl-deficient knee joint, the variations in 
translation were within the ranges as demonstrated in 
previous experimental studies.50-54
Posterolateral corner ligament force and knee joint con-
tact force under gait- and squat-loading conditions. The 
graphs in Figure 7 show the probability analysis and 
forces on PFl, lCl, and PT with PCl deficiency in the 
gait- and squat-loading condition. The mean ligament 
forces on the PFl, lCl, and PT increased by 5%, 19%, 
and 21%, respectively, with PCl deficiency in the gait-
loading condition (Fig. 7a). The mean ligament force 
on the PFl was not significantly influenced by PCl defi-
ciency in the gait-loading condition.
The graphs in Figure 8 show the probability analysis 
and contact forces on the TF and PF joints with PCl 
 
deficiency in the gait- and squat-loading condition. The 
mean TF contact force was 1.7 times body weight or 
1360 N, and the mean PF contact force was 1.3 times 
body weight, or 1060 N, with an intact model in the gait- 
loading condition (Fig. 8a). The contact forces on lateral 
and medial TF joints were 0.86 and 1.7 times body 
weight, respectively, with an intact model in the gait-
loading condition. The contact force on the medial side 
was greater than that on the lateral side, with an intact 
model in the gait-loading condition. a similar trend was 
observed in the model with PCl deficiency. The mean 
contact forces on the PF and TF increased by 21% and 
10%, respectively, with PCl deficiency in the gait-loading 
condition.
The mean ligament forces on PFl, lCl, and PT 
increased by 33.3%, 10.7%, and 71.5%, respectively, 
with PCl deficiency in the squat-loading condition 
(Fig. 7b). unlike the gait-loading condition, more force 
was exerted on PFl, and, remarkably, it increased on PT.

The mean contact forces on TF and PF were 1.95 and 
3.78 times body weight, or 1490 N and 2890 N, respec-
tively, with intact model in the squat-loading condition 
(Fig. 8b). Similar to the gait-loading condition, the con-
tact force on the medial side was greater than that on 
the lateral side in the squat-loading condition. However, 
with PCl deficiency, the mean contact force increased 
by 25% on the medial side, whereas it decreased 
 
by 11.4 % on the lateral side during the squat-loading 
condition. in addition, the mean contact force on the 
 
PF joint increased by 72.8%, with PCl deficiency in 
squatting.

Discussion
The important finding in this study was that the PT is a 
significant component as a dynamic stabiliser in postero-
lateral corner structures with PCl deficiency under gait 
and squat dynamic loading conditions. The dynamics 
model was developed in this study to evaluate the liga-
ment forces, contact forces on the TF and PF joints, and 
muscle activation in the knee joint during gait-loading 
conditions using an mSk model implanted both with and 
without deficiency of PCl.
until recently, when the importance of the associa-
tion between PCl rupture and damage to posterolateral 
corner structures was recognised, this condition had 
often been underdiagnosed. There has been a wide 
 
variety of treatments for early PCl reconstruction 
accompanied with a primary repair of the damaged 
posterolateral corner structure.55 However, patients 
often developed chronic injuries due to a delay in diag-
nosis or presentation, and the optimal treatment 
method is yet to be established. Posterolateral corner

structures of the knee comprise many structures that 
contribute to its static and dynamic stability. The lCl 
and PFl, both concerned with static components, and 
the PT, which is concerned with dynamic components, 
have been described as the major structures of postero-
lateral corner structures of the knee. Furthermore, the 
most serious problem in PCl rupture is caused by the 
posterior displacement of the tibia that is associated 
with the degeneration of both the medial TF and PF joint 
compartments. However, in most previous studies, the 
methodology has been focused on the use of cadavers 
and medical imaging technology.16-22
The PCl is known as the fundamental stabiliser of the 
knee joint, yet its role in stabilisation is not completely 
understood.56 Thus, we introduced and validated an 
12-DoF (TF: 6-DoF, PF: 6-DoF) mSk knee model applica-
ble for simulating the force-dependent kinematic method 
under gait- and squat-loading conditions to evaluate the 
effects of PCl deficiency.1-3
in previous studies, ligaments were considered to be 
knee joint stabilisers, and four major ligaments, namely 
aCl, PCl, mCl, and lCl, were conventionally included 
in the models.45,57 most knee joint models have solely 
included lCl as it is considered to be the primary stabiliser 
among posterolateral corner structures. However, some 
sequential sectioning tests have suggested that the PFl and 
PT also significantly contribute to knee joint stability.16-19 
recently, a computational knee joint model including the 
PFl has been introduced.43,49 However, the PFl is anatomi-
cally attached to the PT, and not directly to the femoral 
bony structure.9,11,19 although there is a knee model with 
the presence of PT-exerted force by point nodes under 
static loading conditions, it could not substitute the proper 
structure of PT under dynamic loading conditions.58
Therefore, in this study, the PT structure was modelled 
in as much detail as possible in order to represent 
 
anatomical attachment of the PFl to the PT, not to the 
fibula, as in a previous study.49 in addition, the mSk 
model allows us to represent more realistic daily activity 
with muscle force interactions which are not under lim-
ited flexion, whereas current cadaver or Fe studies have 
not considered robust muscle activation.16-19,24,26-28 it is a 
well-acknowledged method in orthopedic biomechanics 
to evaluate the representative result by using a well- 
validated computational model.26-28,43,45
The PFl did not exert the force, but the lCl and the 
PT did, with PCl deficiency in the gait-loading condi-
tion. The role of the PFl was transformed to PT during 
gait cycles, and it showed a similar result as a previous 
study which reported that the lCl is mostly influenced 
in mid-angle flexion.16 laPrade et al59 reported that 
there was a significant increase in graft force with a 
 
partially-deficient posterolateral corner structure. The 
graft force became significantly higher with lCl tran-
section during varus loading at both 0° and 30° of 
knee flexion compared with the identical condition with 
intact posterolateral corner structures. in addition, cou-
pled loading of varus and internal rotation moments at 
0° and 30° of knee flexion increased graft force beyond 
the condition with varus force alone. However, unlike 
lCl, the role of the PFl became important in the squat- 
loading condition. in addition, the ligament force on the 
lCl was sensitive to the low flexion range. The PT was 
the most influential component of posterolateral corner 
structure in both gait- and squat-loading conditions 
considering its characteristics as a dynamic stabiliser. in 
addition, the importance of the PT in posterolateral cor-
ner structure was validated in a previous study involving 
cadaveric experiments.19
PCl deficiency causes the TF and PF joint degeneration 
which could aggravate progressive oa.13,14 it is difficult 
to establish the mechanism of PF and TF contact force

consistent with that in previous studies.43,62,63 in our 
model, the contact force on the PF joint became greater 
than that on the TF jont in high flexion, which showed 
 
a similar trend to that observed by Trepczynski et al.63 
The PF joint plays a fundamental role in the knee joint 
function, particularly in activities associated with high 
flexion.
To the best of our knowledge, there have been no pre-
vious studies that have investigated the contact force on 
the TF and PF joints in both gait- and squat-loading con-
ditions using a normal knee. There were relatively smaller 
increases in contact forces on the TF and PF joints in the 
gait-loading condition. However, in the squat-loading 
condition, the contact forces on the TF and PF joints 
increased by 25% and 72.8%, respectively.
an interesting finding was that the contact force on the 
TF joint increased on the medial side, but decreased on 
the lateral side. in other words, PCl deficiency may accel-
erate the degeneration of the TF and PF joints on the 
medial side due to the increase in contact forces. The con-
tact force on the PF joint particularly increased in high 
flexion. in our study, there were no differences in either TF 
or PF joint biomechanics of intact and PCl-deficient knees 
at 0° and 60° of knee flexion in the gait-loading condition. 
Therefore, rehabilitation exercises could be safely per-
formed in this flexion range. However, successive deep-
squat exercises should be avoided in subjects with PCl 
deficiency, so as not to alter normal PF cartilage loading 
excessively. our data suggest that in vivo knee loading 
can be clearly understood by evaluation of forces on the 
TF and PF joints.
This study had some limitations. First, only one com-
putational model was developed using data from one 
subject, although mC simulation was performed to mini-
mise uncertainty in material properties of the ligaments. 
in addition, the range of values from the subject-specific 
mSk model was confirmed using data from previous 
experimental studies; however, the number of subjects 
could be expanded in future research. Second, ligaments 
were modified into only two or three bundles. Third, to 
improve wrapping around the bony structures, wrap 
objects were included. However, these surfaces were 
modified to represent simple geometric shapes. Finally, 
the ground reaction forces were measured directly from 
feet during gait and squat simulations. Future improve-
ments could be achieved by applying a ground contact 
model that allows reaction force simulation incorporated 
with foot-floor interactions.27
in conclusion, PCl deficiency primarily influenced the 
PT among other posterolateral corner structures. The 
contact forces on the medial side were always greater 
than those on the lateral side in both gait- and squat-
loading conditions. PCl deficiency affects relatively less 
TF and PF joint contact forces during the gait cycles. 
However, the contact forces on the TF and PF joints 
increased, particularly for the PF joint, with high flexion in 
the squat-loading condition. in future studies, a larger 
study sample is required to confirm the present findings.
