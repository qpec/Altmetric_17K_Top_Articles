Updated Recommendations for Use of MenB-FHbp Serogroup B 
Meningococcal Vaccine — Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices, 2016
Monica E. Patton, MD1; David Stephens, MD2; Kelly Moore, MD3; Jessica R. MacNeil, MPH1
Two serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines are cur-
rently licensed for use in persons aged 10–25 years in the United 
States. The two vaccines are MenB-FHbp (Trumenba, Pfizer, 
Inc.) (1) and MenB-4C (Bexsero, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, 
Inc.) (2). In February 2015, the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended use of MenB 
vaccines among certain groups of persons aged ≥10 years who 
are at increased risk for serogroup B meningococcal disease* 
(Category A) (3), and in June 2015, ACIP recommended that 
adolescents and young adults aged 16–23 years may be vac-
cinated with MenB vaccines to provide short-term protection 
against most strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease 
(Category B†) (4). Consistent with the original Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) licensure for the two available MenB 
vaccines, ACIP recommended either a 3-dose series of MenB-
FHbp or a 2-dose series of MenB-4C. Either MenB vaccine 
can be used when indicated; ACIP does not state a product 
preference. The two MenB vaccines are not interchangeable; 
the same vaccine product must be used for all doses in a series. 
In April 2016, changes to the dosage and administration of 
MenB-FHbp were approved by FDA to allow for both a 2-dose 
series (administered at 0 and 6 months) and a 3-dose series 
(administered at 0, 1–2, and 6 months) (5,6). In addition, the 
package insert now states that the choice of dosing schedule 
depends on the patient’s risk for exposure and susceptibility to 
serogroup B meningococcal disease. These recommendations 
are regarding use of the 2- and 3-dose schedules of MenB-FHbp 
vaccine (Trumenba) and replace previous ACIP recommenda-
tions for use of MenB-FHbp vaccine published in 2015 (3,4). 
Recommendations regarding use of MenB-4C (Bexsero) are 
unchanged (3,4).
Methods
The ACIP Meningococcal Vaccines Work Group identified 
studies of the comparative immunogenicity, safety, and anti-
body persistence of 2- and 3-dose schedules of MenB-FHbp 
vaccine by consulting with the manufacturer and searching 
PubMed using the search terms “meningococcal serogroup B 
vaccine,” “Trumenba,” and “MenB-FHbp.” One relevant pub-
lished clinical trial (7) and unpublished data from the same 
trial (Pfizer, unpublished data§) were identified that compared 
immunogenicity and safety of 2- and 3-dose schedules of 
MenB-FHbp vaccine. Additionally, unpublished data were 
identified (Pfizer, unpublished data¶) for participants in the 
same trial who were enrolled in an extension study designed 
to evaluate antibody persistence annually for 48 months and 
response to a single booster dose approximately 48 months 
after the primary series. The Work Group reviewed published 
and unpublished immunogenicity and safety data from the 
clinical trial and unpublished antibody persistence data and 
booster dose response data. The type and quality of evidence 
supporting the use of MenB vaccines in adolescents and young 
adults (including college students) and persons at increased risk 
for serogroup B meningococcal disease were evaluated previ-
ously using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, 
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework (3,4,8,9). 
Summaries of the Work Group discussions and data reviewed 
were presented to ACIP in June and October 2016, and rec-
ommendations were approved by the voting ACIP members 
at the October 2016 meeting (detailed meeting minutes are 
available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/
meetings-info.html).
MenB-FHbp Immunogenicity
Previous ACIP policy statements have described the assess-
ments of MenB-FHbp immunogenicity data for persons aged 
≥10 years that supported FDA licensure (3,4,8,9). The immu-
nogenicity of 3-dose versus 2-dose MenB-FHbp schedules in 
* Persons with persistent complement component deficiencies (including 
inherited or chronic deficiencies in C3, C5–C9, properdin, factor D, factor H, 
or who are taking eculizumab [Solaris]); persons with anatomic or functional 
asplenia (including sickle cell disease); microbiologists routinely exposed to 
isolates of Neisseria meningitidis; persons identified as at increased risk because 
of a serogroup B meningococcal disease outbreak.
† Category A recommendations are made for all persons in an age- or risk-
factor-based group. Category B recommendations are made for individual 
clinical decision making. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/

adolescents and young adults was evaluated in a clinical trial 
conducted in Europe among 1,450 persons aged 11–18 years 
(7) (Pfizer, unpublished data). Participants were randomly 
assigned to one of five groups. Group 1 received MenB-FHbp 
at months 0, 1, and 6 and received a saline injection at month 2; 
group 2 received MenB-FHbp at months 0, 2, and 6 and saline 
at month 1; group 3 received MenB-FHbp at months 0 and 6 
and saline at months 1 and 2; group 4 received MenB-FHbp at 
months 0 and 2 and saline at months 1 and 6; group 5 received 
MenB-FHbp at months 2 and 6 and saline at months 0 and 1 
(referred to as 0, 4 months below). Serum bactericidal antibody 
activity, measured using human complement (hSBA) was used 
as a correlate of protection to assess vaccine immunogenicity 
(10,11). Immunogenicity in the trial was assessed as the per-
centage of subjects who achieved an hSBA titer greater than or 
equal to the lower limit of quantification of the assay (hSBA 
titer ≥1:8) to each of the four selected serogroup B meningo-
coccal strains tested (7,12). For purposes of this evaluation, 
immunogenicity was assessed as the proportion of subjects who 
achieved an hSBA titer ≥1:8** to all four selected strains tested 
(composite response) (Pfizer, unpublished data).
Among the 3-dose schedules evaluated, 83.1% of subjects 
in group 1 (0, 1, 6 months) and 81.7% of subjects in group 2 
(0, 2, 6 months) had a composite response (hSBA titer ≥1:8) 
to all four strains tested at 1 month following the third dose 
(Table) (Pfizer, unpublished data). Among the 2-dose sched-
ules, group 3 (0, 6 months) had the highest percent of respond-
ers, 73.5%; 58.9% of subjects in group 5 (0, 4 months) and 
56.8% of subjects in group 4 (0, 2 months) had a composite 
response to all four strains tested at 1 month following the 
second dose. In addition, whereas geometric mean antibody 
titers (GMTs) were higher to all four strains tested among sub-
jects who received 3 doses compared with those who received 
2 doses, group 3 (0, 6 months) had the highest GMTs among 
all 2-dose schedules (7).
MenB-FHbp Antibody Persistence
Antibody persistence data through 48 months and response 
to a single booster dose at approximately 48 months were 
evaluated for participants aged 11–18 years in the clinical 
trial described who also enrolled in an extension study (Pfizer, 
unpublished data). The percentage of subjects with protective 
titers to all four of the serogroup B meningococcal strains 
tested was evaluated at 1, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months fol-
lowing completion of the aforementioned 2-dose and 3-dose 
schedules and at 1 month following the booster dose at 
48 months. An hSBA titer ≥1:4 was considered protective, a 
lower level of activity than the hSBA titer of ≥1:8 used to assess 
immunogenicity. Among subjects enrolled in the extension 
study who received the 2-dose (0, 6 month) schedule and the 
3-dose (0, 2, 6 month) schedule, the percentages of subjects 
with protective hSBA titers to the four selected strains did not 
statistically differ at any time point (Figure 1). At 1 month 
following completion of the primary series, 78.9%–98.9% of 
subjects who received the 2-dose schedule and 86.5%–99.1% 
of subjects who received the 3-dose schedule had protective 
hSBA titers to the four selected strains. For both groups, the 
percentage of subjects with protective antibodies declined 
sharply at 12 months after completion of the primary series 
and remained stable through 48 months after vaccination 
(Figure 1). The hSBA responses and GMTs following a single 
booster dose at approximately 48 months after primary vac-
cination for the group that received the 2-dose schedule were 
not statistically different from those of the group that received 
the 3-dose schedule (Figure 2).
MenB-FHbp Safety
MenB-FHbp safety data have been reported previously 
(3,4,8,9). No significant increased risk for serious adverse 
events has been identified among >4,250 subjects aged 
10–25 years in seven clinical trials who received at least 1 dose 
of MenB-FHbp (4,6,8,9). The most common adverse reactions 
observed in the 7 days after receipt of MenB-FHbp were pain at 
the injection site (≥85% of subjects), fatigue (≥40%), headache 
(≥35%), myalgia (≥30%), and chills (≥15%). Safety and toler-
ability profiles were similar among subjects aged 11–18 years 
who were randomly assigned either a 3-dose or 2-dose series 
of MenB-FHbp (6,7).
 
** Lower limit of quantification for the MenB strain expressing FHbp A22 was 
hSBA titer ≥1:16.

ACIP Recommendations
These recommendations are regarding use of the 2- and 3-dose 
schedules of MenB-FHbp vaccine (Trumenba) and replace pre-
vious ACIP recommendations for use of MenB-FHbp vaccine 
published in 2015 (3,4). Recommendations regarding use of 
MenB-4C (Bexsero) are unchanged (3,4).
Persons aged ≥10 years at increased risk for serogroup B 
meningococcal disease (Category A recommendation). For 
persons at increased risk for meningococcal disease and for 
use during serogroup B meningococcal disease outbreaks, 
3 doses of MenB-FHbp should be administered at 0, 1–2, 
and 6 months to provide earlier protection and maximize 
short-term immunogenicity. However, if the second dose of 
MenB-FHbp is administered at an interval of ≥6 months, a 
third dose does not need to be administered.
Adolescents and young adults aged 16–23 years (Category B 
recommendation). When given to healthy adolescents who 
are not at increased risk for meningococcal disease, 2 doses of 
MenB-FHbp should be administered at 0 and 6 months. If 
the second dose of MenB-FHbp is administered earlier than 
6 months after the first dose, a third dose should be adminis-
tered at least 4 months after the second dose.
CDC Guidance for Use
There are two MenB vaccines licensed for use in the United 
States among persons aged 10–25 years. Either MenB vaccine 
can be used when indicated; ACIP does not state a product 
preference. The two MenB vaccines are not interchangeable; 
the same vaccine product must be used for all doses in a series. 
The minimum interval between any 2 doses of MenB vaccine 
is 4 weeks. On the basis of available data and expert opinion, 
MenB-FHbp or MenB-4C may be administered concomitantly 
with other vaccines indicated for this age, but at a different 
anatomic site, if feasible. ACIP will consider MenB vaccine 
booster doses for persons at increased risk for serogroup B 
meningococcal disease as data become available.

No randomized controlled clinical trials have been conducted 
to evaluate the use of MenB vaccines in pregnant or lactating 
women. As stated in previous ACIP reports on MenB vac-
cines, vaccination should be deferred in women known to be 
pregnant or lactating unless the woman is at increased risk for 
serogroup B meningococcal disease, and, after consultation 
with her health care provider, the benefits of vaccination are 
considered to outweigh the potential risks. Additional infor-
mation for health care providers and parents can be found at 
https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal.
Precautions and Contraindications
Before administering serogroup B meningococcal vaccines, 
health care providers should consult the package inserts for 
precautions, warnings, and contraindications (6,13). Adverse 
events occurring after administration of any vaccine should 
be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS). Reports can be submitted to VAERS online, by fax, 
or by mail. Additional information about VAERS is available by 
telephone (1–800–822–7967) or online (https://vaers.hhs.gov).

Summary
What is currently recommended?
Two serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines are currently 
licensed for use among persons aged 10–25 years in the United 
States: MenB-FHbp (Trumenba) and MenB-4C (Bexsero). The 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) currently 
recommends routine use of MenB vaccines among persons 
aged ≥10 years who are at increased risk for serogroup B 
meningococcal disease (Category A recommendation), 
including persons who have persistent complement compo-
nent deficiencies; persons who have anatomic or functional 
asplenia; microbiologists who routinely are exposed to isolates 
of Neisseria meningitidis; and persons identified to be at 
increased risk because of a serogroup B meningococcal disease 
outbreak. Adolescents and young adults aged 16–23 years may 
also be vaccinated with MenB vaccines to provide short-term 
protection against most strains of serogroup B meningococcal 
disease (Category B recommendation). Consistent with the 
original Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure for the 
MenB vaccines, ACIP recommended either a 3-dose series of 
MenB-FHbp or a 2-dose series of MenB-4C. Either MenB vaccine 
can be used when indicated; however, they are not inter-
changeable, and the same product must be used for all doses.
Why are the recommendations being modified now?
Changes to the dosage and administration of MenB-FHbp were 
approved by FDA to include both a 3-dose series (administered 
at 0, 1–2, and 6 months) and a 2-dose series (administered at 0 
and 6 months).
What are the new recommendations?
These updated recommendations are regarding use of the 
2- and 3-dose schedules of MenB-FHbp vaccine (Trumenba). For 
persons at increased risk for meningococcal disease and for use 
during serogroup B meningococcal disease outbreaks, ACIP 
recommends that 3 doses of MenB-FHbp be administered at 0, 
1–2, and 6 months. When given to healthy adolescents who are 
not at increased risk for meningococcal disease, ACIP recom-
mends that 2 doses of MenB-FHbp should be administered at 0 
and 6 months. Recommendations regarding use of MenB-4C 
vaccine (Bexsero) are unchanged. Either MenB vaccine can be 
used when indicated; however, they are not interchangeable, 
and the same product must be used for all doses in a series.
