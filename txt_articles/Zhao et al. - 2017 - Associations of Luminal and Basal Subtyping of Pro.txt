IMPORTANCE There is a clear need for a molecular subtyping approach in prostate cancer to
identify clinically distinct subgroups that benefit from specific therapies.
OBJECTIVES To identify prostate cancer subtypes based on luminal and basal lineage and to
determine associations with clinical outcomes and response to treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The PAM50 classifier was used to subtype 1567
retrospectively collected (median follow-up, 10 years) and 2215 prospectively collected
prostate cancer samples into luminal- and basal-like subtypes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Metastasis, biochemical recurrence, overall survival,
prostate cancer–specific survival, associations with biological pathways, and clinicopathologic
variables were the main outcomes.
RESULTS Among the 3782 samples, the PAM50 classifier consistently segregated prostate
cancer into 3 subtypes in both the retrospective and prospective cohorts: luminal A
(retrospective, 538 [34.3%]; prospective, 737 [33.3%]), luminal B (retrospective, 447
[28.5%]; prospective, 723 [32.6%]), and basal (retrospective, 582 [37.1%]; prospective, 755
[34.1%]). Known luminal lineage markers, such as NKX3.1 and KRT18, were enriched in
luminal-like cancers, and the basal lineage CD49f signature was enriched in basal-like cancers,
demonstrating the connection between these subtypes and established prostate cancer
biology. In the retrospective cohort, luminal B prostate cancers exhibited the poorest clinical
prognoses on both univariable and multivariable analyses accounting for standard
clinicopathologic prognostic factors (10-year biochemical recurrence-free survival [bRFS],
29%; distant metastasis-free survival [DMFS], 53%; prostate cancer-specific survival [PCSS],
78%; overall survival [OS], 69%), followed by basal prostate cancers (10-year bRFS, 39%;
DMFS, 73%; PCSS, 86%; OS, 80%) and luminal A prostate cancers (10-year bRFS, 41%;
DMFS, 73%; PCSS, 89%; OS, 82%). Although both luminal-like subtypes were associated
with increased androgen receptor expression and signaling, only luminal B prostate cancers
were significantly associated with postoperative response to androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT) in a subset analysis in our retrospective cohorts (n = 315) matching patients based on
clinicopathologic variables (luminal B 10-year metastasis: treated, 33% vs untreated, 55%;
nonluminal B 10-year metastasis: treated, 37% vs untreated, 21%; P = .006 for interaction).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Luminal- and basal-like prostate cancers demonstrate
divergent clinical behavior, and patients with luminal B tumors respond better to postoperative
ADT than do patients with non–luminal B tumors. These findings contribute novel insight into
prostate cancer biology, providing a potential clinical tool to personalize ADT treatment for
prostate cancer by predicting which men may benefit from ADT after surgery.

 T
he lineage of prostate cancer is unknown. Prostate can-
cer was first thought to derive from glandular luminal
cells; however, there is mounting evidence that basal
cells may also play a role in prostate carcinogenesis.1 Mouse
models have demonstrated that both luminal and basal cells
include self-sustaining lineages that can give rise to prostate
cancer.2 Recent work has sought to characterize luminal3 and
basal4 cells that display characteristics similar to those of stem
cells. However, this is an area of active research, and the simi-
larities and differences of luminal and basal prostate cancer
remain unresolved.5,6
The concept of luminal- and basal-like cells and oncogen-
esis is not limited to prostate cancer. Luminal and basal fea-
tures are thought to define key molecular subtypes in blad-
der cancer7 and, most notably, in breast cancer,8 in which the
well-known PAM50 gene expression classifier identifies the
major molecular subtypes of breast cancer. The PAM50 clas-
sifiercategorizesbreastcancerintoluminalA,luminalB,HER2,
and basal subtypes8,9 and is the basis for the commercially
available Prosigna test (NanoString Technologies).10 Further-
more, these subtypes display significant differences in prog-
nosis and response to treatment in both breast11 and bladder7
cancer. Luminal and basal subtypes of bladder cancer are cor-
related with the luminal and basal subtypes of breast cancer,12
suggesting that underlying biological differences that tran-
scend the organ of origin can be identified using the PAM50
classifier.
Given that prostate and breast cancer are both hormon-
ally driven tumors and share many oncogenic pathways,13-15
we hypothesized that the PAM50 algorithm could identify
luminal- and basal-like subtypes in prostate cancer and that
these subtypes would differ in clinical outcomes and treat-
ment response. We used gene expression data from 3782 pros-
tate cancer samples in 7 distinct cohorts on a clinical-grade
microarray platform to investigate the prognostic and predic-
tive utility of luminal and basal subtypes in prostate cancer.
Methods
Clinical Samples and Microarray Processing
Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST microarray (Affymetrix) data
from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded radical prostatec-
tomy samples were obtained from 6 published retrospective
patient cohorts (n = 1567) and 1 prospective cohort (n = 2215),
for a total of 3782 samples. Retrospective cohorts were from
theMayoClinic,Rochester,Minnesota(2separatecohorts)16-18;
Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio19,20; Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, Baltimore, Maryland21; Thomas Jefferson University,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania22; and Durham Veterans Affairs,
Durham, North Carolina.23 Additional cohort details can be
found in the original articles.16-23 A total of 2215 deidentified,
anonymized, and prospectively collected patients from clini-
cal use of the Decipher test were obtained from Decipher GRID
(clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02609269).24-26 Clinical out-
comes were not available for Decipher GRID. Microarray pro-
cessing was performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments–certified clinical operations laboratory
(GenomeDx Biosciences, Inc). Microarrays were normalized
using Single Channel Array Normalization.27 See the eAppen-
dix in the Supplement for information regarding the andro-
gen deprivation therapy (ADT)–matched analysis, microar-
ray data, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and statistical
analyses. Data collection for the 6 retrospective cohorts was
approved and supervised by the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic,
Johns Hopkins University, Thomas Jefferson University, and
Durham Veterans Affairs institutional review boards (IRBs).
Patient consent for the 6 retrospective cohorts was waived by
the IRB of each institution. Written informed patient consent
and IRB approval for Decipher GRID were obtained through
Quorum Review IRB (Seattle, Washington).
PAM50 Clustering
PAM50 clustering was performed based on the original algo-
rithm from Parker et al.28 Source code was downloaded from
the University of North Carolina Microarray Database (https:
//genome.unc.edu/pubsup/breastGEO/) and used without
modification. Gene expression data were median centered in
each cohort individually as required by the PAM50 algorithm.
The normal-like subtype was excluded because the prostate
cancer samples were macrodissected, limiting the amount of
normal tissue present. The HER2 subtype was also excluded
given the lack of ERBB2/HER2 (OMIM: 164870) amplification
in prostate cancer.29 Assignment of subtype in the prostate
cancer samples was thus assigned by greatest correlation with
luminal A, luminal B, or basal.
Clinical End Points
All primary and secondary end points were preplanned. The
primary clinical end point was distant metastasis–free sur-
vival (DMFS). Secondary clinical end points were biochemi-
cal recurrence-free survival (bRFS), prostate cancer–specific
survival (PCSS), and overall survival (OS). All end points were
defined from time of surgery until time of the event, death,
or last follow-up. The primary analyses in the Decipher GRID
cohort were to validate subtype gene expression patterns and
associations with biological pathways and clinicopathologic
markers in a contemporary cohort.
Key Points
Question Is molecular subtyping by luminal and basal status
clinically relevant in prostate cancer?
Findings In this study of 3782 retrospectively and prospectively
collected radical prostatectomy samples, molecular subtyping by
the PAM50 classifier consistently segregates patients into luminal
A, luminal B, and basal-like subtypes, which are associated with
different lineage markers. Patients with luminal tumors exhibit
increased androgen signaling, and those with luminal B tumors
have poorer outcomes but potentially improved response to
postoperative androgen deprivation therapy.
Meaning Molecular subtyping by luminal and basal status in
prostate cancer is prognostic for clinical outcomes and may be
associated with response to postoperative androgen deprivation
therapy.

 Results
To subtype prostate cancers into luminal- and basal-like sub-
types, we applied the PAM50 classifier to 1567 prostate can-
cer samples with a median clinical follow-up time of 10 years.
A total of 538 samples (34.3%) are classified as luminal A, 447
(28.5%) as luminal B, and 582 (37.1%) as basal, with visually
similar patterns of expression across all 6 independent co-
horts (Figure 1A and eFigure 1 and eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). Expression patterns of PAM50 genes are also similar
between breast and prostate cancer samples (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement). Notably, the estrogen receptor, which is high-
est in luminal breast cancer tumors, and the progesterone re-
ceptor, which is highest in luminal A breast cancer tumors,8
do not demonstrate the same patterns in prostate cancer
(eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
We next examined associations of the luminal A, luminal
B, and basal subtypes with clinical outcomes. Patients with
luminal B tumors consistently have significantly poorer out-
comes for all end points compared with those with luminal A
andbasaltumors(Figure1B).The10-yearactuarialratesforbRFS
are29%forluminalBcomparedwith41%forluminalAand39%

paredwith89%forluminalAand86%forbasal;andforOS,69%
for luminal B vs 82% for luminal A and 80% for basal.
OnunivariableCoxproportionalhazardsanalysis(Tableand

type, the basal and luminal A subtypes had improved bRFS
(basal: hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.59-0.81; P < .001;
luminal A: HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.57-0.78; P < .001), DMFS (basal:
HR,0.50;95%CI,0.40-0.61;P < .001;luminalA:HR,0.42;95%
CI, 0.34-0.53; P < .001), PCSS (basal: HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44-
0.79;P < .001;luminalA:HR,0.38;95%CI,0.27-0.53;P < .001),
and OS (basal: HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56-0.85; P < .001; luminal
A: HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45-0.70; P < .001). However, the lumi-
nal A subtype does not exhibit significantly different bRFS
(HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.89-1.22; P = .61) or DMFS (HR, 1.17; 95% CI,
0.93-1.49; P = .18) compared with the basal subtype. Luminal
A does demonstrate poorer PCSS (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.09-2.16;
P = .01) and OS (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.00-1.55; P = .05) compared
with basal, although this finding is difficult to interpret in the
setting of nonsignificant differences in metastasis and bio-
chemical recurrence. Consistent with our data demonstrating
that patients with luminal B tumors have the poorest clinical
outcomes, those with luminal B tumors also have the highest
preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, Gleason
score, and rates of extracapsular extension (ECE) and lymph
node invasion (LNI), followed by those with basal and then
luminal A tumors (eTable 1 in the Supplement). On multivari-
able analysis (Table and eTable 2 in the Supplement), adjust-
ingforclinicopathologicvariables(age,PSA,Gleasonscore,posi-
tivesurgicalmarginstatus,ECE,seminalvesicleinvasion[SVI],
and LNI), patients with basal and luminal A tumors have sig-
nificantly better independent prognosis than those with lumi-
nalBtumorsforbRFS(basal:HR,0.81;955CI,0.69-0.96;P = .01;
luminal A: HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66-0.93; P = .005) and DMFS
(basal: HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53-0.82; P < .001; luminal A: HR,
0.55; 95% CI, 0.43-0.69; P < .001). Patients with luminal A
tumors also have significantly improved outcomes compared
with those with luminal B tumors for PCSS (HR, 0.50; 95% CI,
0.35-0.71; P < .001) and OS (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55-0.87;
P = .002).Toprovidecomparisonwithacompositeclinicalclas-

(eTable 3 in the Supplement).
We then investigated the relationship between these sub-
types and luminal and basal prostate cancer lineage markers.
The basal lineage CD49f signature4 is increased in basal-like
samples(Figure2A).Concordantly,theluminalmarkersNKX3.1
(OMIM: 602041), KRT18 (OMIM: 148070), and AR (OMIM:
313700)3 are increased in luminal-like samples (Figure 2B-C).
ConsistentwithourfindingsforAR,theandrogenactivitypath-
way is enriched in the luminal subtypes compared with the
basal subtype (GSEA normalized enrichment score, 3.93;
P < .001; Figure 2C). Examining the top GSEA31 hallmark con-
cepts comparing luminal with basal subtypes (eAppendix in
the Supplement) reveals that the MYC pathway is the top en-
riched pathway in luminal-like samples, and genes downregu-
lated by KRAS are the top positive pathway in basal-like
samples (negatively enriched in luminal samples). These re-
sults are concordant with MYC (OMIM: 190080) and KRAS
(OMIM: 190070) expression, which are both increased in
luminal-like samples (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). On ob-
servingthatproliferationgenes,suchasMKI67(OMIM:176741),

the divergent clinical outcomes despite the biological simi-
larities between the luminal A and B subtypes.
We next independently validated the associations of
these subtypes with biological and clinicopathologic factors
in Decipher GRID, a prospectively collected cohort of 2215 ex-
pression profiles of patients who underwent prostatectomy.
The PAM50 gene expression patterns are similar to those in
the pooled retrospective cohorts, and trends of AR and
AR-signaling (higher in the luminal subtypes), CD49f signa-
ture (higher in the basal subtype), and NKX3.1 and KRT19 (both
higher in the luminal subtypes) gene expression are con-
served (Figure 3). A total of 737 samples (33.3%) are classified
as luminal A, 723 (32.6%) as luminal B, and 755 (34.1%) as basal
(eTable 4 in the Supplement). We also confirmed MYC and
KRAS expression patterns, which are both increased in the
luminal subtypes (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). Finally,
while clinical outcomes are not available for patients in the
Decipher GRID cohort, the luminal B subtype demonstrates
the highest Gleason scores, as well as rates of SVI, ECE, and
LNI, consistent with clinical outcomes and clinicopathologic
data in our retrospective cohorts (eTable 4 in the Supple-
ment). This independent prospective validation increases our
confidence that these associations are accurate and appli-
cable in a large contemporary cohort of patients.

 The association between androgen signaling and luminal-
like prostate cancer is of particular interest given the impor-
tance of ADT in treating prostate cancer. We investigated
whether these subtypes could predict response to hormonal
therapy in an exploratory subgroup analysis by first design-
ing a postprostatectomy subcohort of patients (n = 315) who
were either treated with ADT (n = 105) or not treated with ADT
(n = 210) matched by clinicopathologic factors (Gleason score,
PSA, LNI, ECE, SVI, and positive surgical margin status), and
postoperative radiotherapy (Figure 4A and eTables 5 and 6 and
the eAppendix in the Supplement). The matched cohort had
a median follow-up of 13 years. In this analysis, we pooled the
luminal A and basal subtypes to compare with the luminal B
subtype because the luminal A and basal subtypes have simi-
lar outcomes for ADT and no ADT in the matched cohorts. In
the luminal B subtype, which has the poorest prognosis of the
3 subtypes and contains patients with increased expression of
AR-signaling genes, patients treated with ADT had improved
DMFS compared with those who did not receive ADT (10-year
metastasis rates: ADT, 33% vs no ADT, 55%; Figure 4B and C).
However, in the patients with non–luminal B subtypes, pa-
tients treated with ADT had poorer DMFS compared with
untreated patients (10-year metastasis rates: ADT, 37% vs no
ADT, 21%; Figure 4B and C), with a similar trend in patients
with the luminal A or basal subtypes. Separating patients re-
ceiving adjuvant or salvage therapy in the matched cohort re-
sults in similar trends, although the P values are insignificant
owing to the reduced numbers (eFigure 5 in the Supple-
ment). Finally, we used interaction analysis in a Cox propor-
tional hazards model of these matched patients to demon-
strate a statistically significant interaction term between
ADT and the luminal B subtype. Prognostic signatures, such
as Decipher16 and the microarray version of the Cell Cycle and
Progression signature,20,32 did not predict response to post-
operative ADT (eFigure 6 in the Supplement), suggesting that
it is not simply more aggressive disease that responds better
to postoperative ADT. The luminal B subtype represents a sub-
group of prostate cancers with poor prognosis combined with
biological differences in AR-signaling that result in improved
response to postoperative ADT.
Discussion
We demonstrated in 3782 prostate cancer samples that
patients with prostate cancer can be classified into luminal-
and basal-like subtypes by the PAM50 algorithm. The lumi-
nal A, luminal B, and basal subtypes had consistent gene
expression patterns among 6 retrospective cohorts and
1 prospectively collected cohort and were correlated with
clinical outcomes. Although PAM50 subtyping has been
applied to other tumor types, such as lung33 and bladder12
cancer, to our knowledge this is the first reported use in
prostate cancer and suggests that luminal and basal features
are a unifying biological concept across multiple tumor
types. The PAM50 gene expression patterns in prostate

 cancer demonstrate concordance with breast cancer. This
finding is perhaps not surprising given the similarities
between prostate and breast cancer. In both tumor types,
gonadal steroid hormones (testosterone in prostate and
estrogen and progesterone in breast) play a large role in
tumor growth and progression. In addition, both tumors
respond to antihormonal therapy. Moreover, circulating
androgens and estrogens are present in both men and
women, and the role of androgens in breast cancer and
estrogens in prostate cancer is an area of active research and
may indicate further commonalities between the 2 tumor
types.13-15
Despite these similarities, we identified that, in prostate
cancer, patients with luminal B disease have the poorest
prognosis in contrast to the basal subtype in breast cancer.8
While luminal subtypes are driven by the estrogen and pro-
gesterone receptors in breast cancer, luminal subtypes in
prostate cancer have increased androgen receptor expres-
sion and signaling activity. Furthermore, in breast cancer,
luminal subtypes are associated with response to hormonal
therapy, which is unsurprising given the high correlation of
luminal subtypes and estrogen receptor status.11 Our find-
ings again parallel this in prostate cancer, as we demon-
strated that patients with luminal B tumors benefit more
from ADT than do those with non–luminal B tumors.
We did not find the same benefit from ADT for patients
with luminal A tumors, perhaps because these patients
already have a better prognosis; thus, aggressive treatment
may make little difference in the eventual outcome. We also
showed that patients with luminal B tumors have an
elevated PAM50 proliferation score28 compared with those
with luminal A tumors. Proliferation genes, such as MKI67,
have been associated with poorer prognosis in both
prostate20 and breast34 cancer. The high proliferation score
may be in part why patients with luminal B tumors tend to
have poorer clinical outcomes compared with those with

 luminal A tumors despite their biological similarities. Fur-
thermore, one effect of ADT is to reduce proliferation in
androgen-sensitive prostate cancers.35 Thus, luminal B
tumors may represent a high-proliferation, androgen-driven
subset, which may explain why they derive the most benefit
from ADT. Notably, the luminal B subtype has a proliferation
score similar to the basal subtype, indicating that prolifera-
tion genes alone are not the defining drivers of poor progno-
sis and the association with response to ADT.
Androgendeprivationtherapyformsthebackboneoftreat-
ment of metastatic prostate cancer36 and has been shown to
add to the effect of radiotherapy.37,38 However, in a system-
atic review,39 adjuvant ADT in the postoperative setting has
not been shown to improve overall survival, suggesting that
perhaps only a subset of men have androgen-responsive
tumors that are also aggressive enough to require additional
postoperative therapy. In our study, we demonstrated that not
only does the luminal B subtype appear to identify such a sub-
set from retrospectively collected patients, but it also can iden-
tify these men among contemporary patients undergoing
radical prostatectomy on a commercially available genome-
wide expression analysis that was ordered as part of their
routine clinical care.16,17,19,22 Prior work in this area has
focused on identifying clinical and genomic markers for re-
sponse to ADT and has identified clinical factors, such as
Gleason score, PSA, and metastatic disease status, as well as
certain genetic polymorphisms that are associated with out-
comes in men treated with ADT.40,41 However, Gleason score,
PSA, and metastatic disease status are prognostic factors in all
men, even those who do not receive ADT. Because these stud-
ies did not include a similar group of men who were not treated
with ADT, it is difficult to ascertain whether these variables
are predictive for response to ADT or if they are simply prog-
nostic markers in all prostate cancers regardless of ADT
treatment.42

 adjuvant and salvage ADT together because stratification by
these variables separately in the matching process would have
reduced the number of patients and statistical power even fur-
ther. Therefore, these results should be considered hypothesis
generating and should be independently validated, ideally in a
randomized clinical trial. We are currently in the process of
obtaining samples from one such trial, RTOG 96-01,43 which
will allow us to definitively test this hypothesis.
Despite the fact that the PAM50 algorithm was derived in
breast cancer, its classification of basal and luminal subtypes
in prostate cancer samples is correlated with known prostate
luminal and basal markers. We have established that the basal-
like subtype is associated with the basal lineage CD49f
signature4 and that the luminal-like subtype is associated with
the luminal markers NKX3.1, KRT18, and AR.3 A recent study
by Zhang et al44 described a 100-gene set representing the 50
most overexpressed genes in basal and luminal benign pros-
tate cells. However, when sorting our samples into luminal and
basal subtypes based on these 100 genes, we did not find an
association with clinical outcomes in our data set (eFigure 7
in the Supplement). These differences with our findings may
be due to the biological differences in benign tissue used in the
studybyZhangetal44vsthemalignantprostatecancersamples
in our study. These 100 genes were also nominated based on
samples from only 3 patients, which may not adequately cap-
ture the heterogeneity across prostate cancer. In contrast, the
PAM50 clustering was derived specifically in malignant tis-
sue and has been widely validated in breast cancer, bladder
cancer, and now in several thousand prostate tumors. None-
theless, the work by Zhang et al44 further illustrates the inter-
est in the field of exploring the biological and clinical signifi-
cance of luminal and basal prostate cancer.
Although the luminal A and basal subtypes are similar to
each other in clinical outcomes, they are divergent with re-
spect to basal and luminal lineage markers and androgen re-
ceptor signaling, as well as the oncogenic drivers MYC and
KRAS, in which luminal A is much more similar to luminal B.
The luminal A and basal subtypes also differ in proliferation
scores. Our findings suggest that luminal A and basal sub-
types are biologically distinct. Although these differences do
not always translate into differences in prognosis (eg, ERG
[OMIM: 165080] positive vs negative45), they are neverthe-
less important in understanding disease biology and poten-
tially for therapeutic selection.

 Conclusions
We have illustrated the clinical and genetic differences be-
tween luminal and basal subtypes in prostate cancer across
nearly 4000 samples from retrospective and prospective
cohorts on a commercial, high-throughput clinical platform.
We believe this work not only represents a significant step
forward in our understanding of prostate cancer heteroge-
neity but also is a potential classifier that may identify patients
who benefit from postoperative ADT on a clinical-grade plat-
form and provide guidance in personalizing patient care.
