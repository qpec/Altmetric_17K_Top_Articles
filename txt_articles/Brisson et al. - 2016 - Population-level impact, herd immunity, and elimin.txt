Summary
Background Modelling studies have been widely used to inform human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination policy 
decisions; however, many models exist and it is not known whether they produce consistent predictions of 
population-level eff
 ectiveness and herd eff
 ects. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of model predictions 
of the long-term population-level eff
 ectiveness of vaccination against HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11 infection in women 
and men, to examine the variability in predicted herd eff
 ects, incremental benefi
 t of vaccinating boys, and potential 
for HPV-vaccine-type elimination.
Methods We searched MEDLINE and Embase for transmission-dynamic modelling studies published between 
Jan 1, 2009, and April 28, 2015, that predicted the population-level impact of vaccination on HPV 6, 11, 16, and 
18 infections in high-income countries. We contacted authors to determine whether they were willing to produce new 
predictions for standardised scenarios. Strategies investigated were girls-only vaccination and girls and boys 
vaccination at age 12 years. Base-case vaccine characteristics were 100% effi
  cacy and lifetime protection. We did 
sensitivity analyses by varying vaccination coverage, vaccine effi
  cacy, and duration of protection. For all scenarios we 
pooled model predictions of relative reductions in HPV prevalence (RRprev) over time after vaccination and summarised 
results using the median and 10th and 90th percentiles (80% uncertainty intervals [UI]).
Findings 16 of 19 eligible models from ten high-income countries provided predictions. Under base-case assumptions, 
40% vaccination coverage and girls-only vaccination, the RRprev of HPV 16 among women and men was 0·53 (80% UI 
0·46–0·68) and 0·36 (0·28–0·61), respectively, after 70 years. With 80% girls-only vaccination coverage, the RRprev of 
HPV 16 among women and men was 0·93 (0·90–1·00) and 0·83 (0·75–1·00), respectively. Vaccinating boys in 
addition to girls increased the RRprev of HPV 16 among women and men by 0·18 (0·13–0·32) and 0·35 (0·27–0·39) for 
40% coverage, and 0·07 (0·00–0·10) and 0·16 (0·01–0·25) for 80% coverage, respectively. The RRprev were greater for 
HPV 6, 11, and 18 than for HPV 16 for all scenarios investigated. Finally at 80% coverage, most models predicted that 
girls and boys vaccination would eliminate HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18, with a median RRprev of 1·00 for women and men for 
all four HPV types. Variability in pooled fi
 ndings was low, but increased with lower vaccination coverage and shorter 
vaccine protection (from lifetime to 20 years).
Interpretation Although HPV models diff
 er in structure, data used for calibration, and settings, our population-level 
predictions were generally concordant and suggest that strong herd eff
 ects are expected from vaccinating girls only, 
even with coverage as low as 20%. Elimination of HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11 is possible if 80% coverage in girls and boys 
is reached and if high vaccine effi
  cacy is maintained over time.

Introduction
Since 2006, two prophylactic human papillomavirus 
(HPV) vaccines have been widely used worldwide: the 
bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines. Both vaccines target 
HPV 16 and 18, which cause about 50% of high-grade 
cervical lesions, 70% of cervical cancers, and 40–80% of 
other HPV-related cancers.1–5 The quadrivalent vaccine 
also targets HPV 6 and 11, which are associated with 
80–90% of anogenital wart cases.6 Large randomised 
controlled clinical trials have shown that both vaccines 
are highly eff
 ective in protecting against vaccine-type 
persistent HPV infection and precancerous lesions in 
women and men (vaccine effi
  cacy 93–100%).7,8 More 
than 65 countries have introduced HPV vaccination

programmes.9,10 Most programmes target girls only, with 
only a handful of countries vaccinating both girls and 
boys (eg, the USA, Australia, Switzerland, Austria, 
and Canada).11–17 These decisions have been made with 
substantial 
input 
from 
mathematical 
models.11,18–22 
Recently, a nonavalent vaccine, which targets HPV 31, 33, 
45, 52, and 58 also, has been licensed and recommended 
for use in the USA23 after reports of strong effi
  cacy and 
immunogenicity from large trials.24
Mathematical models have consistently predicted that 
vaccinating girls against HPV is highly cost-eff
 ective,25–27 
however, the picture is less clear for vaccinating boys.28–35 
This is because the cost-eff
 ectiveness of vaccinating girls 
is mainly driven by the direct benefi
 t of HPV vaccination 
among vaccinated women, which depends on well 
quantifi
 ed parameters such as vaccine effi
  cacy and the 
proportion of cervical cancer due to the vaccine types.27 
The incremental eff
 ectiveness and cost-eff
 ectiveness of 
vaccinating boys is infl
 uenced largely by the magnitude 
of indirect protection conferred to men by vaccinating 
girls (herd immunity), which depends on a complex 
combination of factors (eg, vaccination coverage and 
sexual behaviour).28,35,36 Modelling studies have shown 
that if vaccinating girls signifi
 cantly reduces the burden 
of HPV-related diseases in men through herd immunity, 
then vaccinating boys will produce limited additional 
population-level benefi
 ts for heterosexual men and 
women and thus will not be cost-eff
 ective at the same 
vaccine price.28,30,35 However, it is unclear what vaccination 
coverage is necessary to achieve substantial herd eff
 ects, 
and whether models are consistent in their predictions.
A 
systematic 
review 
of 
population-level 
HPV 
post-vaccination surveillance data has shown signifi
 cant 
reductions in anogenital warts in young men in the 
fi
 rst 4 years after girls-only quadrivalent vaccination 
programmes with high coverage (≥50%).37 In countries 
with low vaccination coverage (<50%) there was no 
indication of herd eff
 ects.37 In Australia, where 
quadrivalent vaccination coverage among girls has 
been consistently higher than 70%, anogenital warts 
consultations among heterosexual men declined by more 
than 80% within the fi
 rst 5 years of the programme 
(before vaccination of boys).38 These results suggest that 
HPV vaccination can produce important herd eff
 ects for 
the anogenital warts associated types (HPV 6 and 11), and 
that elimination of these types might be achievable.
Better understanding the potential long-term population-
level eff
 ectiveness of HPV vaccination, including herd 
eff
 ects, is crucial to help inform future vaccine policy 
decisions such as the inclusion of boys in vaccination 
programmes, incremental impact of increasing vaccin-
ation coverage and optimal combin 
ations of HPV 
vaccination and cervical cancer screening strategies. 
Mathematical models provide a formal framework to 
examine these questions, which cannot be answered in 
trial settings. However, models require many assumptions, 
which might lead to questions about the validity of 
predictions and uncertainty for decision makers. A large 
number of HPV models have been developed over the past 
decade, but it is still unclear whether the models are giving 
consistent results and whether we can draw general 
principles from them. We conducted a systematic review

Evidence before this study
Many models have been developed over the past decade to 
understand HPV epidemiology and to help guide policy decisions 
concerning HPV vaccination. However, it is unknown whether 
these models are giving consistent results in terms of HPV 
vaccination population-level eff
 ectiveness, herd eff
 ects, 
incremental benefi
 t of vaccinating boys in addition to girls, 
and elimination. To examine this question, we conducted 
a systematic review and meta-analysis of HPV 
transmission-dynamic model predictions of the long-term 
population-level eff
 ectiveness of HPV vaccination against HPV 6, 
11, 16, and 18 infection in women and men. To our knowledge, 
this is the fi
 rst meta-analysis of HPV model predictions, and is the 
fi
 rst to examine the potential for elimination.
Added value of the study
Our study shows that the HPV models give generally consistent 
results, which can be reassuring for decision makers using these 
models for vaccination policy decisions. Results suggest that 
HPV vaccination will produce strong herd eff
 ects leading to 
substantial long-term reductions in HPV infection and related 
diseases in unimmunised women and men. Herd eff
 ects are 
predicted even with vaccination coverage as low as 20%. 
Given the substantial herd eff
 ects of girls-only vaccination 
when coverage is moderate to high, the incremental benefi
 t of 
vaccinating boys is predicted to be small. To our knowledge, our 
study is the fi
 rst to suggest that elimination of vaccine-targeted 
HPV types is possible if vaccination coverage of girls and boys 
reaches 80%. Finally, our study includes a greater number of 
models than any published comparison of infectious disease 
models, refl
 ecting the infl
 uential role modelling has played in 
HPV vaccination policy decisions.
Implications of available evidence
HPV vaccination is likely to have a strong direct and indirect 
impact across diff
 erent countries and coverage levels. The case 
for vaccinating boys could mainly depend on other issues 
besides the predicted additional benefi
 t for heterosexual males, 
such as cost of the vaccine for boys, feasibility of increasing 
coverage in girls, and equity for men who have sex with men. 
Although early post-HPV vaccination surveillance data do not 
show herd eff
 ects in settings with low coverage, our study 
suggests that this is probably because herd eff
 ects take longer 
to become evident when coverage is lower. Policy makers might 
want to examine whether to set objectives to eliminate HPV 
vaccine types in their jurisdictions.

and meta-analysis of model predictions of the long-term 
population-level eff
 ectiveness of HPV vaccination against 
HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 infection in women and men, to 
examine the robustness and variability of predicted herd 
eff

potential for HPV vaccine-type elimination.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we used a 
three-step systematic process to identify independently 
developed HPV transmission-dynamic mathematical 
models from the published literature, which we report in 
accordance with the PRISMA guidelines.39 First, we 
systematically reviewed the literature. Modelling studies 
were eligible for inclusion if the model: (1) was an HPV 
transmission-dynamic model; (2) produced predictions 
of the population-level impact of vaccination on 
HPV 16, 18, 6, or 11 infections among women or men or 
both; and (3) was developed to examine the impact of HPV 
vaccination in a high-income country. We searched 
MEDLINE and Embase databases using a combination of 
the following MeSH terms, title or abstract words, without 
restriction on the language of the articles: (“models, 
theoretical” or “mathematical model” or “models, 
statistical” or “cost-benefi
 t analysis” or “cost-eff
 ectiveness” 
or “risk-benefi
 t analysis”) and (“papillomavirus vaccines” 
or “papillomavirus vaccination” or “human papillomavirus 
vaccine” or “HPV vaccine” or “HPV vaccination”); the exact 
search for both databases is presented in the appendix p 2. 
We included models published between Jan 1, 2009, and 
April 28, 2015, because the authors were likely to use their 
model to inform future policy decisions. We identifi
 ed 
eligible studies through review of titles and abstracts. To 
identify additional studies, we reviewed the references of 
selected articles and hand searched the abstracts from 
the main HPV conferences (Eurogin Congress 2013; 
Florence, Italy; Nov 3–5; and International Papillomavirus 
Conference 2014; Seattle, WA, USA; Aug 20–25). MB, ÉB, 
and MD assessed the eligibility of all studies.
Second, we decided a priori to group the selected 
studies by research team. Teams were not selected if 
they used a model previously developed by another 
team. MB contacted the senior or corresponding authors 
of all teams to determine whether they were willing to 
produce new predictions using a standardised-input 
dataset. The ability to provide new standardised 
predictions was a prerequisite for inclusion of a model 
in this meta-analysis, to adequately compare and pool 
model results. Third, when modelling teams had 
diff
 erent versions of their models, we included only their 
most recent published model in the meta-analysis to 
ensure independence between model predictions.
Data collection and quality assessment
All eligible and participating teams were asked to fi
 ll a 
standardised form to describe their models in detail. 
Additionally, MB and ÉB provided the modelling teams 
with 19 predetermined vaccination scenarios and asked 
them to transfer these new results using a standardised 
format (appendix p 3). Our primary outcome was the 
relative reduction in the overall prevalence (RRprev) of 
HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11 among heterosexual women and 
men after 70 years of vaccination (vs no vaccination). We 
decided, a priori, to stratify outcomes by HPV type and 
sex. Results were stratifi
 ed by sex to investigate the herd 
eff
 ects of vaccinating girls only on RRprev among 
heterosexual men, and were stratifi
 ed by type to examine 
if model predictions of herd immunity or elimination 
diff
 ered between HPV vaccine types. Base-case vaccine 
characteristics used by all groups were 100% vaccine 
effi
  cacy and lifetime duration of protection. In the 
sensitivity analyses, we varied vaccine effi
  cacy (to 90%)

and duration of protection (to 20 years) for fi
 xed 
vaccination coverage of 40% and 80%. As a secondary 
outcome, we present RRprev over time since the 
introduction of vaccination.
Before contacting modelling teams, MB and ÉB 
assessed if the studies were of suffi
  cient methodological 
quality to be included in the pooled analysis. Following 
recommendations from the International Society for 
Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research and Society 
for Medical Decision Making (ISPOR-SMDM) modelling 
good research practices task force,40 the main quality 
criteria were that the models had to be transmission-
dynamic mathematical models and be calibrated to 
epidemiological data. Given that an objective of the 
meta-analysis was to examine herd eff
 ects and HPV 
elimination, the transmission-dynamic model criterion 
was included as an eligibility criterion. Finally, once 
model results were obtained from the participating 
modelling teams, MB and ÉB assessed the construct 
validity of predictions.
Data analysis
We derived pooled predictions of HPV vaccination 
population-level impact by calculating the median and 
10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of the predictions 
of the models, and present RRprev with 80% uncertainty 
intervals (80% UI; the 10th and 90th percentiles). These 
pooled results illustrate the central tendency and 
variability or robustness of model predictions, with all 
models having equal weight. These pooled results 
are diff
 erent to summary estimates from classical 
meta-analysis of empirical studies, which are pooled with 
weights based on sample size or variance. Incremental 
RRprev were obtained by subtracting the RRprev of girls-only 
vaccination from the RRprev of girls and boys vaccination. 
We used univariate linear meta-regressions to identify 
potential sources of heterogeneity among the diff
 erent 
models’ predictions for HPV 16, giving equal weight 
to all models. We looked at model characteristics 
in univariate analysis and examined the potential 
interactions between each characteristic and vaccination

Predicted relative reduction in the prevalence (RRprev) of HPV 16 among women and men after 70 years of girls-only vaccination, assuming 40% (A) and 80% (B) vaccination coverage; and predicted 
incremental relative reduction in the prevalence of HPV 16 among women and men after 70 years by vaccinating boys in addition to girls only, assuming 40% (C) and 80% (D) vaccination coverage. 
The pooled estimates are medians and 80% uncertainty intervals (10% and 90% percentile) of predictions. Models with error bars provided uncertainty intervals (10th and 90th percentile) around 
their median model predictions. When a model’s results includes a median estimate and uncertainty range, the pooled results used the median value. HPV=human papillomavirus. NA=not available.

 erent research teams (fi
 gure 1). Of 
the 19 teams contacted to participate in the meta-analysis, 
17 provided new standardised model predictions. All 
models met the main methodological quality criteria. 
However, one model41 was excluded because it was built 
for short-term predictions, and demographic change 
assumptions produced unstable long-term predictions. 
The 16 models included in the meta-analysis vary in 
terms of type (deterministic or stochastic), structure 
(assumptions 
about 
sexual 
activity, 
partnership 
formation and dissolution, transmission, and natural 
immunity), and baseline HPV prevalence, and were 
developed in ten countries (Australia, Canada, Finland, 
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, UK, and 
USA; appendix pp 4–5). HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11 were 
included in 16, 13, fi
 ve, and three models, respectively.
Among women after 70 years of girls-only vaccination, 
the overall predicted prevalence of HPV 16 decreased 
by 53% (RRprev 0·53 [80% UI 0·46–0·68]) assuming 
40% coverage, and by 93% (RRprev 0·93 [80% UI 
0·90–1·00]) 
assuming 
80% 
coverage 
(fi
 gure 
2). 
At 40% coverage, the corresponding RRprev for HPV 6, 11, 
and 18 were 7 to 28 percentage points greater than HPV 16, 
and at 80% coverage these types were eliminated (HPV 11) 
or close to elimination (HPV 18 and 6; fi
 gure 3A, appendix 
pp 6–13). Given that population-level eff
 ectiveness (RRprev) 
was substantially greater than vaccination coverage for all 
HPV vaccine-targeted types, these results indicate that 
girls-only vaccination is expected to produce substantial 
herd eff
 ects for unvaccinated women even at low coverage, 
with greater herd immunity eff
 ects for HPV 18, 6, and 11 
than for HPV 16 (fi
 gure 3A, appendix p 14).
Important herd eff
 ects were also predicted in men after 
girls-only vaccination for both low and high coverage 
scenarios (fi
 gures 2, 3). Among men, the overall 
prevalence of HPV 16 decreased by 36% after 70 years of 
girls-only vaccination assuming 40% coverage (RRprev 
0·36 [80% UI 0·28–0·61]), and by 83% assuming 80% 
coverage (0·83 [0·75–1·00]; fi
 gure 2). The RRprev of 
HPV 18, 6, and 11 were again greater than that of HPV 16 
(fi
 gure 3A, appendix p 14).
Post-vaccination reduction in HPV prevalence over 
time after girls-only vaccination was faster for women 
than men, for types HPV 6 and 11 compared with HPV 16 
and 18, and at higher coverage than at lower coverage 
(appendix pp 15–16).
Vaccinating 40% of boys in addition to 40% of girls (girls 
and boys strategy) resulted in incremental reductions of 
HPV 16 prevalence of 18% among women (incremental 
RRprev 0·18 [80% UI 0·13–0·32]) and 35% among men 
(0·35 [0·27–0·39]) after 70 years (fi
 gure 2C). Given the 
important herd eff
 ects following girls-only vaccination 
with 80% coverage, vaccinating 80% of boys in addition to 
girls produced small incremental reductions in HPV 16

women and 0·16 [80% 0·01–0·25] for men), after 70 years 
(fi
 gure 2D). The incremental population-level eff
 ectiveness 
of vaccinating boys in addition to girls was similar between 
the HPV vaccine types when assuming 40% coverage, but 
was substantially higher for HPV 16 (vs HPV 18, 6, 11) 
when assuming 80% coverage (fi
 gure 3B). Vaccinating 
boys in addition to girls produced a slightly faster decline 
in vaccine-type-specifi
 c prevalence among women and 
men (appendix pp 15–16).
For the same number of additional vaccinated 
individuals, increasing coverage in a girls-only strategy 
was predicted to provide greater population-level benefi
 ts 
than was including boys in a vaccination programme. 
The models predicted that increasing girls-only 
vaccination coverage by 40% (from 40% to 80%) reduced 
HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11 prevalence in women by an 
additional 40%, 38%, 35%, and 19%, respectively; higher 
than the incremental benefi
 ts of vaccinating 40% of boys 
in addition to 40% of girls (fi
 gure 4; appendix pp 10–13, 
15–16). The same increase in girls-only vaccination 
coverage from 40% to 80% was also more eff
 ective in 
reducing HPV 16, 18, and 6 prevalence in men than the 
incremental benefi
 t of vaccinating 40% of boys in 
addition to 40% of girls, and the strategies were equally 
eff
 ective for HPV 11 (fi
 gure 4, appendix pp 10–13).
Increasing coverage considerably improved population-
level eff
 ectiveness up to 80% for girls-only vaccination 
and 60% for girls and boys vaccination, after which, 
increasing coverage had very little marginal benefi
 t

(fi
 gure 4). Substantial herd eff
 ects were predicted with 
girls-only vaccination coverage as low as 20% (fi
 gure 4, 
appendix pp 10–13). Interestingly, 19% (three of 16), 46% 
(six of 13), 60% (three of fi
 ve), and 100% (three of three) 
of models predicted that HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11, 
respectively, would be eliminated among heterosexual 
populations if girls-only vaccination reaches 80% 
coverage (fi
 gure 4, appendix p 14). The girls and boys 
strategy substantially increased the predicted potential 
for elimination; 64%, 92%, 80%, and 100% of models 
predicted that HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11 would be eliminated 
with 80% coverage, and a few models predicted 
elimination of types HPV 18, 6, and 11 with 60% coverage 
(fi
 gure 4, appendix p 14).
Predicted population-level eff
 ectiveness and herd 
eff
 ects were much lower and more variable across the 
models when assuming that vaccine duration of 
protection was 20 years compared with lifelong protection 
(appendix p 17). However, reducing vaccine effi
  cacy from 
100% to 90% had little impact on the pooled predictions 
(appendix p 17).
In the meta-regression analysis, vaccination coverage 
and vaccination strategies were the main sources of 
heterogeneity between the predictions of the models 
(data not shown). However, the meta-regression results 
are presented separately by vaccination coverage and 
vaccination strategy, given that signifi
 cant interactions 
were observed between these variables and the other 
model characteristics (appendix pp 18–19). Across all 
vaccination scenarios, the main source of heterogeneity 
in predictions for women and men was whether the 
transmission-dynamic 
models 
included 
(or 
not) 
diff
 erent sexual activity risk groups (appendix pp 18–19). 
Models that did not include risk groups for sexual 
activity predicted signifi
 cantly higher population-level 
HPV vaccination eff
 ectiveness and herd eff
 ects. 
Population-level eff
 ectiveness was also signifi
 cantly 
higher among models that assume lower natural 
immunity among women (mostly when vaccine 
protection is assumed lifelong), or include the natural 
history of cervical cancer (when vaccine protection is 
20 years). These results were similar when examining 
model predictions for HPV 18.
Discussion
The fi
 ndings from our systematic review and meta-analysis 
suggest that HPV vaccination will produce strong herd 
eff
 ects leading to substantial long-term reductions in HPV 
infection and related diseases in unimmunised women 
and men. Herd eff
 ects are predicted even with vaccination 
coverage as low as 20%, and to be greater for 
HPV 18, 6, and 11 types than for HPV 16. Given the 
substantial herd eff
 ects of girls-only vaccination when 
coverage is moderate to high, the incremental benefi
 t of 
vaccinating boys is predicted to be small. However, most 
models predict that vaccinating boys in addition to girls 
could eliminate HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11, as long as 
80% coverage is achieved in both sexes and the vaccine 
confers long-term protection.
Our fi
 ndings have important policy implications. First, 
because of the important herd eff
 ects from girls-only 
vaccination, our models predict that increasing HPV 
vaccination coverage among girls has greater incremental 
benefi
 t for both male and female individuals than adding 
boys to a vaccination programme. The herd eff
 ects for 
heterosexual men are predicted to be about the same 
magnitude as the level of girls-only vaccination coverage. 
Given this, the epidemiological and economic con-
siderations about vaccinating boys should focus on the 
following issues: the feasibility and incremental marginal 
costs of increasing vaccination coverage among girls 
versus introducing a gender-neutral programme;42 
whether the price of the vaccine can be reduced for boys 
for the strategy to be cost-eff
 ective; and the importance 
placed on achieving equal protection for men who have 
sex with men (MSM).
Second, our models suggest that elimination of 
HPV 6, 11, and 18 is likely if vaccination coverage of 
girls and boys reaches 80% and the vaccine provides 
long-term protection. However, vaccination coverage 
might have to be slightly higher than 80% to eliminate 
HPV 16, the type responsible for most of the HPV-related 
burden. These results also have implications for the 
recently licensed nonavalent vaccine. Given their 
prevalence and biological characteristics, the additional 
types are expected to behave similarly to type HPV 18 
and thus be easier to eliminate than HPV 16. It should 
also be noted that the time to elimination might be 
shorter than was predicted in the meta-analysis 
(appendix pp 15–16), because we did not include 
scenarios with catch-up programmes. Policy makers 
might want to examine whether to set objectives to 
eliminate HPV vaccine types in their jurisdictions and 
set vaccination coverage targets.
Third, post-vaccination reduction of HPV 6 and 11 
infections was predicted to be steeper than for HPV 16 
and 18 infections, which is due to the shorter durations 
of infectiousness and lower transmissibility of these low 
oncogenic risk types.43 Hence, HPV 6 and 11-related 
disease (eg, anogenital warts) trends are a poor proxy of 
change in HPV 16 and 18 and related diseases, and 
should not be directly extrapolated to inform policy 
decisions regarding prevention of HPV-related cancers 
and its precursors.
Fourth, the models predicted substantial herd eff
 ects 
even at relatively lower coverage (40%). However, a recent 
meta-analysis found evidence of signifi
 cant herd eff
 ects 
only in higher-coverage settings.37 Our study fi
 ndings 
suggest this diff
 erence is likely to be because herd eff
 ects 
take longer to become evident where coverage is lower. 
Early programme impact data should not be used to rule 
out herd eff
 ects in settings where coverage is low.
This study addresses a key source of concern when 
using mathematical model results for decision making:

the robustness and validity of predictions. By system-
atically identifying published HPV transmission-dynamic 
models that were independently developed from one 
another and presenting the distribution of predictions, 
our analysis provides decision makers with a measure 
of uncertainty and robustness surrounding model 
predictions. Reassuringly, the key conclusions of this 
systematic review were consistent among the models, 
even though the models were built to represent diff
 erent 
countries and varied in structure and assumptions.
According to good modelling practice guidelines, 
model 
validation 
should 
include 
between-model 
corroboration using independent models and, if possible, 
external or predictive validation.44 Our systematic review 
shows high consistency in HPV model predictions of 
population-level reductions in HPV vaccine types among 
women and men when vaccination coverage is 80% or 
higher for girls only and 60% or higher for girls and boys 
vaccination. The models also consistently predict that 
post-vaccination reductions will be smaller for HPV 16 
than the other vaccine types. However, there is substantial 
variability in predictions when vaccination coverage is 
between 40–60%, and when duration of vaccine 
protection is 20 years. Our meta-regression identifi
 ed 
two key model choices or parameters that explain this 
variability: inclusion of sexual activity risk groups in the 
model and the level of natural immunity among women. 
Sexual activity has been shown to be very heterogeneous 
in populations (eg, skewed distribution of number of 
partners), leading most models built for prediction of 
interventions against sexually transmitted diseases to 
include sexual risk groups. Furthermore, a recent 
meta-analysis found that the proportion of women who 
develop natural immunity against a subsequent HPV 16 
or 18 infection is greater than 35% when controlling for 
potential confounders or using neutralising assays.45 
When considering only the predictions of models that 
include diff
 erent sexual activity risk groups and that 
assume that the proportion of women who develop 
natural immunity is greater than 35%, the variability in 
predictions is substantially reduced with little impact on 
the median pooled estimates (eg, at 40% vaccination 
coverage, the RRprev of HPV 16 among women after 
girls-only vaccination is 0·52 [80% UI 0·45–0·58] vs 
0·53 [0·46–0·68] when considering all predictions 
(appendix pp 20–21). Finally, although external or 
predictive validation was beyond the scope of the paper, 
the descriptive results of the pooled analysis are in line 
with results from a recent meta-analysis of post-HPV 
vaccination data,37 showing strong herd eff
 ects shortly 
after vaccination in countries with high vaccination 
coverage and very little evidence of herd eff
 ects in this 
timeframe where coverage is low. In addition, models 
included in the systematic review have previously shown 
that they reproduce the reduction in HPV 16 and 18 
infection46,47 and anogenital warts consultations observed 
in the fi
 rst 5 years after HPV vaccination introduction.48
Our main fi
 ndings are likely generalisable to most 
high-income countries given that they are based on 
models from ten of these countries and very little 
heterogeneity remains when results are stratifi
 ed by 
vaccination coverage, vaccination strategy, and key 
model characteristics. In addition, there are similarities 
in sexual behaviour,49 HPV type distribution,50,51 and age 
profi
 le of HPV prevalence52 among high-income 
countries. However, our predicted herd eff
 ects and 
potential for elimination should be extrapolated to 
low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) with 
caution, because there are important diff
 erences 
between high-income countries and LMICs in sexual 
behaviour and potential cofactors of HPV such as high 
HIV prevalence.49,53,54
The study has two main limitations that should 
be considered, in addition to those inherent in 
meta-analysis.55,56 First, although the models were built 
independently from one another and showed variability in 
their structures, similarities remain in key structural 
assumptions, which could contribute to the consistency of 
fi
 ndings. None of the models included MSM, incorporated 
multisite infection or transmission (transmission between 
oral, anal, and genital sites), or the possibility of 
reactivation. Modelling HPV transmission between men 
would be unlikely to have an eff
 ect on predictions about 
the herd eff
 ects of girls-only vaccination, but could slightly 
impact predictions about elimination. Including higher 
risk groups or MSM, who have greater HPV prevalence 
(and higher R0), would make it more diffi
  cult to eliminate 
HPV, and therefore the coverage required for elimination 
could be higher than estimated by the models in the 
systematic review. On the other hand, recent modelling 
studies suggest that adding multisite transmission or 
reactivation would probably have very little impact 
on long-term predictions about the population-level 
eff
 ectiveness of HPV vaccination.57,58 Second, we purposely 
decided to examine the predicted impact of vaccination on 
HPV infection rather than disease endpoints, as the main 
focus of the paper is on herd eff
 ects and elimination of 
HPV vaccine types. Additional uncertainty in HPV model 
predictions, when examining the impact of vaccination on 
disease endpoints, will be in the absolute reduction of 
HPV burden of disease (related to country specifi
 c 
pre-vaccination burden of disease and proportion due to 
the vaccine types) and the timing of these benefi
 ts (related 
to assumptions about progression from infection to 
lesions or cancer).
To our knowledge, our study includes a greater 
number of models than any published comparison of 
infectious disease models, refl
 ecting the infl
 uential 
role that modelling has played in HPV vaccination 
policy decisions. Furthermore, this is the fi
 rst 
model comparison study in which systematic review 
methodology was used to identify all potentially eligible 
mathematical models (reducing possible selection bias); 
independence of models was controlled for by including

e16
only one model per team and producing predictions for 
predetermined and standardised scenarios without prior 
harmonisation of model structures or natural history 
parameters; and meta-analytic techniques were used 
to describe the central tendency and variability of 
predictions and identify sources of heterogeneity in 
results. Finally, our study shows that the HPV models 
developed over the past decade give consistent results in 
terms of population-level eff
 ectiveness against infection, 
herd eff
 ects, and the possibility of elimination, which 
could be reassuring for decision makers using these 
models for vaccination policy decisions. We also 
identifi
 ed key HPV modelling choices (ie, inclusion of 
sexual risk groups, natural history of cervical cancer, and 
natural immunity) that have the greatest infl
 uence on 
model predictions, which should guide the future 
development of models.
In conclusion, the results of this study indicate strong 
promise for the long-term population-level impact of HPV 
vaccination programmes. However, it will be important to 
continue to validate HPV model predictions and to 
compare them to post-vaccination surveillance data, as 
many policy decisions about HPV vaccination (ie, number 
of doses, which vaccine to use, and vaccination of boys) 
and cervical cancer screening remain.
