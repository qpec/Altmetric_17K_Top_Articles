BACKGROUND
In patients with type 1 diabetes who are not pregnant, closed-loop (automated) 
insulin delivery can provide better glycemic control than sensor-augmented pump 
therapy, but data are lacking on the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of closed-loop 
therapy during pregnancy.
METHODS
We performed an open-label, randomized, crossover study comparing overnight 
closed-loop therapy with sensor-augmented pump therapy, followed by a continu-
ation phase in which the closed-loop system was used day and night. Sixteen 
pregnant women with type 1 diabetes completed 4 weeks of closed-loop pump 
therapy (intervention) and sensor-augmented pump therapy (control) in random 
order. During the continuation phase, 14 of the participants used the closed-loop 
system day and night until delivery. The primary outcome was the percentage of 
time that overnight glucose levels were within the target range (63 to 140 mg per 
deciliter [3.5 to 7.8 mmol per liter]).
RESULTS
The percentage of time that overnight glucose levels were in the target range was 
higher during closed-loop therapy than during control therapy (74.7% vs. 59.5%; 
absolute difference, 15.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 6.1 to 24.2; 
P 
= 
0.002). The overnight mean glucose level was lower during closed-loop therapy 
than during control therapy (119 vs. 133 mg per deciliter [6.6 vs. 7.4 mmol per 
liter], P 
= 
0.009). There were no significant differences between closed-loop and 
control therapy in the percentage of time in which glucose levels were below the 
target range (1.3% and 1.9%, respectively; P 
= 
0.28), in insulin doses, or in adverse-
event rates. During the continuation phase (up to 14.6 additional weeks, including 
antenatal hospitalizations, labor, and delivery), glucose levels were in the target 
range 68.7% of the time; the mean glucose level was 126 mg per deciliter (7.0 mmol 
per liter). No episodes of severe hypoglycemia requiring third-party assistance oc-
curred during either phase.
CONCLUSIONS
Overnight closed-loop therapy resulted in better glucose control than sensor-aug-
mented pump therapy in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. Women receiving 
day-and-night closed-loop therapy maintained glycemic control during a high 
proportion of the time in a period that encompassed antenatal hospital admission, 
labor, and delivery. (Funded by the National Institute for Health Research and others;

Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery during Pregnancy
C
omplications of type 1 diabetes 
mellitus during pregnancy include in-
creased rates of congenital anomaly, still-
birth, neonatal death, preterm delivery, and 
macrosomia.1 Congenital anomalies are associ-
ated with poor glycemic control around the time 
of conception, whereas the other complications 
are associated with maternal hyperglycemia that 
persists during pregnancy.2-5
Pregnant women with type 1 diabetes face 
particular challenges in trying to maintain tight 
glycemic control. Insulin requirements typically 
increase by a factor of 2 to 3 during the second 
and third trimesters, with substantial day-to-day 
variability, making the need for dose adjustments 
and their required magnitude unpredictable.6,7 
Even with regular glucose monitoring, intensive 
insulin therapy, and glycated hemoglobin levels 
below 7%, pregnant women with type 1 diabetes 
have glucose levels that are above the target 
range approximately half the time.8,9 They also 
have increased rates of hypoglycemia,6,10-12 with 
glucose levels that are below the target range for 
up to 3.5 hours per day,8 so the benefit of avoid-
ing hyperglycemia for the infant must be weighed 
against the risk of hypoglycemia for the mother.
Technological advances in glucose monitoring 
and insulin delivery, including continuous glucose 
monitoring, insulin pumps, and sensor-augmented 
pump therapy, may allow for safer improvements 
in glycemic control.13 Closed-loop systems use a 
computer algorithm (a set of mathematical in-
structions) to adjust insulin-pump delivery in re-
sponse to glucose measurements obtained from 
real-time continuous glucose monitors.14 These 
systems have been shown to improve glycemic 
control without increasing the risk of hypoglyce-
mia under experimental conditions,15-17 in trials 
of supervised outpatient treatment,18-22 and in 
studies of unsupervised, self-administered treat-
ment among patients who were not pregnant.23-25 
Preliminary data suggest that closed-loop systems 
may maintain near-normal glucose levels and 
minimize the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia 
among pregnant women with type 1 diabetes.26,27 
We performed a 4-week, randomized, crossover 
study of an overnight closed-loop system, fol-
lowed by a 14-week continuation phase of day-
and-night closed-loop therapy, which encom-
passed pregnancy-related challenges, including 
antenatal hospital admission, labor, and deliv-
ery, as well as postnatal adaptation.
Methods
Study Participants
We recruited pregnant women who had a history 
of type 1 diabetes mellitus for at least 12 months. 
Participants were 18 to 45 years of age, with a 
pregnancy between 8 and 24 weeks of gestation 
and a glycated hemoglobin level between 6.5 and 
10.0%. The women were receiving intensive in-
sulin therapy administered by means of either 
multiple daily injections or an insulin pump. 
Women were excluded if they had conceived with 
the use of assisted reproductive technologies, 
were receiving concurrent treatment that might 
influence glucose control, had a multiple-gestation 
pregnancy, or had clinically significant nephrop-
athy, neuropathy, or proliferative retinopathy, as 
judged by the investigator. Detailed inclusion 
and exclusion criteria are provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix, available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent.
Study Oversight
The study protocol was approved by the East of 
England Research Ethics Committee of the 
Health Research Authority, with notification of 
no objection provided by the U.K. Medicines and 
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. The 
study was overseen by an independent data and 
safety monitoring board.
Abbott Diabetes Care provided discounted 
continuous-glucose-monitoring devices and con-
sumables. Company representatives had no role 
in the design of the study; in the collection, 
handling, analysis, or interpretation of data; or in 
the decision to submit the manuscript for pub-
lication. The National Institute for Health Re-
search and Abbott Diabetes Care received a copy 
of the manuscript before submission as a for-
mality but did not provide input on the content.
Study Design
The study was an open-label, multicenter, ran-
domized, crossover trial. Participants were re-
cruited from three U.K. National Health Service 
(NHS) sites.
After enrollment, participants were trained to 
use the study devices: a DANA Diabecare R Insu-
lin Pump (SOOIL) and the FreeStyle Navigator II 
(Abbott Diabetes Care). After a run-in period of 
2 to 4 weeks for device training and optimization

of insulin doses, participants were randomly as-
signed in permuted blocks of 4 to either the 
overnight closed-loop system (intervention) or 
sensor-augmented pump therapy (control). Par-
ticipants underwent a 2-week washout period 
after completing the first assigned intervention 
and before starting the second intervention. 
During the washout phase, participants used 
finger-stick testing, with or without continuous 
glucose monitoring or pump therapy, but could 
not use the closed-loop system.
After completion of the randomly assigned 
interventions, participants could choose to con-
tinue sensor-augmented pump therapy or the 
day-and-night closed-loop system with manually 
administered boluses before meals until delivery. 
This continuation phase provided a longer-term 
feasibility assessment of 24-hour closed-loop 
therapy while addressing the ethical questions 
that would be raised by withdrawal of an effec-
tive treatment during pregnancy.
Participants were advised to perform finger-
stick glucose testing at least seven times daily, 
with standard glucose targets in both groups 
(63 to 99 mg per deciliter [3.5 to 5.5 mmol per 
liter] before a meal and <140 mg per deciliter 
[7.8 mmol per liter] 1 hour after a meal). Rou-
tine antenatal clinic visits were scheduled every 
2 weeks, with fetal ultrasonographic assessments 
performed at 12, 20, 28, 32, and 36 weeks of 
gestation. There were no restrictions on physical 
activity, meals, or overseas travel, and no remote 
monitoring was performed. Participants had ac-
cess to a 24-hour telephone line for assistance 
with technical difficulties.
C-peptide levels were measured when the se-
rum glucose level was within the target range 
(63 to 140 mg per deciliter [3.5 to 7.8 mmol per 
liter]) at baseline, and glycated hemoglobin levels 
were measured at baseline, after each interven-
tion phase, and at 28, 32, and 36 weeks of gesta-
tion. The study design is shown in Figure S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Closed-Loop System
During closed-loop therapy, a computer program, 
housed on a tablet computer, used continuous 
glucose measurements to determine an appro-
priate insulin dose. The insulin was delivered by 
means of an insulin pump every 12 minutes 
(Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Pre-
meal boluses were administered manually (15 to 
30 minutes before the meal) as clinically indicat-
ed.28 To initialize closed-loop therapy, the par-
ticipant’s weight and total daily insulin dose 
were entered in the computer program. During 
the 4-week randomized phase, participants start-
ed closed-loop therapy after their evening meal 
and stopped before breakfast. During the day-
and-night continuation phase, closed-loop ther-
apy was used continuously, with manually ad-
ministered boluses before meals. The device had 
to be within approximately 30 m of the partici-
pant in order to maintain connectivity. There 
were no programming changes in anticipation of 
antenatal glucocorticoid use, labor, or delivery.
Study End Points
The primary efficacy end point was the percent-
age of time that glucose was in the target range 
of 63 to 140 mg per deciliter overnight, as re-
corded by means of continuous glucose moni-
toring during each 4-week study phase. Second-
ary efficacy end points were the mean glucose 
level, the percentages of time overnight and 
during the day and evening that glucose levels 
were above and below relevant thresholds, glu-
cose variability, insulin dose, and glycated hemo-
globin level.
Safety end points included the number and 
duration of hypoglycemic episodes (moderate or 
severe). Moderate hypoglycemia was defined as 
a glucose level of less than 63 mg per deciliter 
for 20 minutes or longer, as measured by con-
tinuous glucose monitoring. A severe hypoglyce-
mic episode was defined as an episode requiring 
third-party assistance.
The feasibility of day-and-night closed-loop 
therapy in the continuation phase (from the end 
of the crossover phase until delivery) was as-
sessed on the basis of glucose measurements 
during sequential 4-week intervals and over the 
period as a whole. The same glucose targets and 
study end points were used during the crossover 
and continuation study phases.
Statistical Analysis
In our previous study of a closed-loop system 
with the use of sensor-augmented pump therapy 
in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (median 
glycated hemoglobin level, 6.4%), the mean (±SD) 
percentage of time that glucose levels were in

Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery during Pregnancy
the target range was 61.7±24.9%.27 We calculated 
that we would need to enroll 16 women for the 
current study to have a power of 80% to detect a 
30% relative increase in the percentage of time 
that glucose levels were in the target range (from 
62% with sensor-augmented pump therapy to 80% 
with the closed-loop system), at an alpha level of 
0.05 (two-tailed). The standard deviation for the 
primary outcome was assumed to be 25%.26,27
Statistical analyses were performed on an 
intention-to-treat basis, with data analyzed ac-
cording to the study phase to which the partici-
pant had been assigned, regardless of adherence 
to the assigned intervention. We used linear 
mixed-effects models to estimate the percentage 
of overnight time that glucose levels were in the 
target range (response variable). The fixed effect 
of interest was whether there was a difference 
between sensor-augmented pump therapy and 
closed-loop therapy. Since the response variable 
was a repeated measure, we included nested 
random effects for the average time-in-target 
value for each study participant and for each 
4-week time period for each participant. The fit 
of the model was not improved by including a 
term for either study phase-by-intervention inter-
action or autocorrelation of the response vari-
able over time, and the estimated difference be-
tween study phases was not materially altered. 
Functional analysis of the continuous glucose 
data29 was performed and adjusted for weeks of 
gestation and period effect. Sequential glucose 
measurements were modeled as trajectories by 
calculating continuous mathematical functions 
of glucose measurements. These trajectories were 
modeled by fitting B-splines to the repeated 
measures.30 A two-sided significance level of 
0.05 was used for both primary and secondary 
outcomes, without adjustment for multiple com-
parisons.
Results
Study Participants
A total of 20 participants were recruited to 
participate in the study. Of these participants, 
3 withdrew during the run-in training phase and 
17 underwent randomization. One participant 
withdrew during her first study phase (sensor-
augmented pump therapy) because of termina-
tion of pregnancy for trisomy 13 (a chromosomal 
anomaly unrelated to diabetes). Sixteen partici-
pants completed both study phases and were 
included in the analyses (Table 1). Six partici-
pants were receiving multiple daily insulin injec-
tions, and 14 participants had no experience with 
continuous glucose monitoring before the study.
Study Outcomes
The percentage of overnight time that glucose 
values were within the target range was signifi-
cantly higher with closed-loop therapy than with 
sensor-augmented pump therapy (74.7% vs. 59.5%; 
absolute difference, 15.2 percentage points; 95% 
confidence interval, 6.1 to 24.2; P

Data are shown for weeks of gestation at randomization. Participants were 
randomly assigned to one of the two intervention phases after 2 to 4 weeks  
of training, when insulin regimens were optimized and participants were con-
fident in the use of the study insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor.

Among the nine women with previous pregnancies, five had previous preg-
nancy losses (five miscarriages and two stillbirths); one woman had a second-
trimester termination of pregnancy because of major fetal malformation, and 
two women had each had two preterm deliveries (before 34 weeks of gestation).

and Fig. 1). The mean glucose level was signifi-
cantly lower during closed-loop therapy than dur-
ing sensor-augmented pump therapy, both over-
night (119 vs. 133 mg per deciliter [6.6 vs. 7.4 mmol 
per liter], P 
= 
0.009) (Table 2) and over a 24-hour 
period (128 vs. 137 mg per deciliter [7.1 vs. 7.6 
mmol per liter], P<0.001) (Tables 2 and 3).
The incidence of maternal hyperglycemia was 
lower during closed-loop therapy than during 
sensor-augmented pump therapy, both overnight 
and over a 24-hour period. The incidence of sub-
stantial nocturnal hyperglycemia (glucose level, 
>180 mg per deciliter [10.0 mmol per liter]) was 
significantly lower during overnight closed-loop 
therapy than during sensor-augmented pump 
therapy (Table 2). Functional data analysis showed 
that overnight closed-loop therapy was associat-
ed with a significantly lower glucose level for a 
total time of 7 hours and 20 minutes (between 
1:50 a.m. and 9:10 a.m.), with no significant ef-
fect for gestational age or study phase (Fig. S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
The percentage of time that glucose levels 
were in the hypoglycemic range (<63 mg per 
deciliter) was low (<2%), with no significant dif-
ferences between the two phases of the cross-
over study. There were no episodes of severe 
hypoglycemia during either phase.
Glycated hemoglobin levels declined from base-
line to the end of both phases, with no significant 
difference in changes between the two phases of 
the crossover study (P 
= 
0.67). Total daily insulin 
doses were similar in the two phases, although 
insulin delivery was significantly more variable

The target range for glucose was 63 to 140 mg per deciliter. The primary efficacy end point was the percentage of time that glucose was in 
the target range overnight, as recorded by continuous glucose monitoring during each 4-week study phase. The reported values were de-
rived from linear mixed-effects models.

The low blood glucose index assesses the duration and extent of hypoglycemia. Vvalues of less than 2.5 indicate a low risk of severe hypo-
glycemia, values of 2.5 to 5 indicate a moderate risk, and values of more than 5 indicate a high risk. The reported values were derived from 
linear mixed-effects models.

Adverse Events
There were 26 adverse events (14 skin reactions 
and 12 minor illnesses), with no significant 
differences between closed-loop and sensor-
augmented pump therapy. There were 95 device 
deficiencies (18 during sensor-augmented 
pump therapy, 21 during closed-loop therapy, 
and 56 during the run-in and continuation 
phases), none of which resulted in severe hypo-
glycemia or hyperglycemia (Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). There were 8 serious 
adverse events. One of these events, which oc-
curred during the randomized phase of closed-
loop therapy, was a hospital admission after an 
episode of self-treated hypoglycemia resulting 
from recurrent vomiting; however, this event 
occurred during the daytime, when the closed-
loop system was not operational. Another seri-
ous adverse event (vomiting due to gastroen-
teritis) occurred during the run-in training 
phase, and 6 events occurred during the con-
tinuation phase (Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). No serious adverse events were con-
sidered by the study investigators to be device-
related.
Feasibility of Day-and-Night Closed-Loop 
Therapy throughout Pregnancy
Fourteen participants chose to continue using 
the closed-loop system after they finished the 
crossover studies, which provided up to an addi-
tional 14.6 weeks (median, 11.6 weeks [interquar-
tile range, 7.1 to 12.7]) of day-and-night closed-
loop use for feasibility assessment. Throughout 
the continuation phase with the closed-loop 
system, glucose levels were in the target range a 
mean of 68.7% of the time, and the mean glu-
cose level was 126 mg per deciliter (7.0 mmol 
per liter).
The median glucose levels were 124, 128, 124, 
and 115 mg per deciliter (6.9, 7.1, 6.9, and 
6.4 mmol per liter) at gestational ages of 24 
weeks to 27 weeks 6 days, 28 weeks to 31 weeks 
6 days, 32 weeks to 35 weeks 6 days, and 36 weeks 
or more, respectively (Tables S5 and S6 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The median percent-
ages of time that glucose levels were in the tar-
get range were 70.9%, 67.6%, 67.8%, and 77.3% 
at the respective gestational ages. The median 
percentages of time that glucose levels were be-
low the target ranged from 1.2 to 2.1% through-
out pregnancy.
Closed-Loop Therapy during Labor  
and Delivery
Fourteen women continued closed-loop therapy 
during labor and delivery (Fig. 2). In the 24 hours 
before delivery, these women had a median glu-
cose level of 110 mg per deciliter (interquartile 
range, 104 to 128 [6.1 mmol per liter; interquar-
tile range, 5.8 to 7.1]), with glucose levels in the 
target range of 63 to 140 mg per deciliter 86.8% 
of the time (interquartile range, 59.6 to 94.1) 
and glucose levels below the target range 0.5% 
of the time (interquartile range, 0 to 1.8). In the 
first 48 hours after delivery, these women had 
a median glucose level of 117 mg per deciliter 
(interquartile range, 104 to 137 [6.5 mmol per 
liter; interquartile range, 5.8 to 5.6]), with glu-
cose levels in the target range 73.7% of the time 
(interquartile range, 61.4 to 86.0) and values 
below the target range 0% of the time (inter-
quartile range, 0 to 0.5). The median total daily 
insulin dose was 53.6% of the predelivery dose 
(interquartile range, 48.6 to 73.6), with substan-
tial variation among the participants (Table S7 
in the Supplementary Appendix). There were no 
episodes of maternal hypoglycemia during the 
24 hours before or 48 hours after delivery.
Obstetrical and Neonatal Outcomes
The median gestational age at delivery was 36.9 
weeks (interquartile range, 34.5 to 37.7). Pre-
eclampsia developed in 5 participants, including 
1 with the HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated 
liver enzyme levels, and a low platelet count). 
Cesarean section was performed in 15 partici-
Figure 2 (facing page). Glycemic Control during Labor 
and Delivery in the 14 Participants Who Continued  
to Use Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery.
Data are shown for the 24-hour period before delivery 
and the 48-hour period after delivery, with delivery at 
time 0. Participants 5, 6, 8, 9, and 15 received ante-
natal glucocorticoids for fetal lung maturation. Partici-
pant 3 had a urinary tract infection in the antepartum 
period, which was the reason for her delivery. Partici-
pant 15 had Addison’s disease and was treated with 
high-dose glucocorticoids in the immediate postpartum 
period. Carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios were changed  
as soon as possible after delivery, and prandial insulin 
was withheld for the first meal after delivery. The dark 
green shading indicates the target glycemic range of  
63 to 140 mg per deciliter (3.5 to 7.8 mmol per liter). 
The light green shading indicates an elevated glycemic 
range of 141 to 180 mg per deciliter (7.8 to 10.0 mmol 
per liter).

pants (2 of whom were under general anesthe-
sia); 10 of the procedures were performed before 
the onset of labor. One participant underwent an 
ovarian cystectomy during cesarean section. 
Seven participants delivered before 37 weeks of 
gestation (with 4 of the 7 participants delivering 
before 34 weeks of gestation), and in 6 partici-
pants, antenatal glucocorticoids were adminis-
tered for fetal lung maturation. On days 1, 2, and 
3 after glucocorticoid administration, glucose 
levels were in the target range a median of 
58.1%, 59.1%, and 70.9% of the time, respectively. 
The closed-loop system delivered a median of 
169 to 178% of the pre-glucocorticoid insulin 
dose, although there was substantial variation 
among the participants (Tables S8 and S10 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
The median birth weight was 3588 g (inter-
quartile range, 2670 to 3998). Thirteen of the 16 
infants had a birth weight (corrected for sex and 
gestational age) that was above the 90th percen-
tile, according to population-based U.K. data.31 
Twelve infants received neonatal intensive care, 
11 of whom were treated with intravenous dex-
trose for neonatal hypoglycemia. Details regard-
ing the obstetrical outcomes are provided in 
Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Discussion
As compared with sensor-augmented pump ther-
apy, overnight closed-loop therapy resulted in a 
significant increase (by 15 percentage points) in 
the percentage of time that glucose levels were 
in the target range for pregnancy over a 24-hour 
period, as well as in a lower mean glucose level. 
These improvements were achieved without an 
increased incidence of hypoglycemia or an in-
crease in the total insulin dose but with more 
variable insulin delivery to minimize hyperglyce-
mic excursions.
After the crossover phase of the study, 14 par-
ticipants continued to use day-and-night closed-
loop therapy for up to an additional 14.6 weeks, 
with the results showing the feasibility of 24-hour 
use of the closed-loop system during pregnancy, 
delivery, and in the first 48 hours after delivery. 
These observations are important because preg-
nancy provides challenges to the use of a closed-
loop system, some of which are an integral part 
of pregnancy (e.g., week-by-week changes in insu-
lin resistance and pharmacokinetics,7 labor and 
delivery, and the rapid decrease in insulin re-
quirements after delivery). Further challenges 
arise from antenatal admissions, administration 
of glucocorticoids for fetal lung maturation, and 
the use of anesthesia for cesarean section. Previ-
ous outpatient studies of closed-loop therapy18,23 
have focused on relatively steady-state diabetes 
in the absence of pregnancy. The closed-loop 
system maintained maternal glycemic control in 
study participants throughout pregnancy and 
delivery and associated challenges without any 
changes in programming to the system and 
without any episodes of severe hypoglycemia 
requiring third-party assistance.
The randomized crossover design of our study 
minimized the effect of confounding factors. 
There was no significant effect of study phase or 
gestational age, suggesting that the closed-loop 
system adjusted insulin consistently. We included 
14 participants who had no previous experience 
with sensor-augmented pumps, 6 of whom had 
never used an insulin pump of any kind. The 
glycemic-control outcomes for these participants 
were similar to the outcomes for the participants 
who were experienced pump users.
Our findings build on recent trials showing 
that a closed-loop system, as compared with 
sensor-augmented pump therapy, improved gly-
cemic control, without increases in hypoglyce-
mic episodes or the insulin dose.18,23 The glucose 
control achieved during our control phase was 
similar to that achieved with closed-loop inter-
ventions among patients who were not pregnant. 
This observation probably reflects the strong 
motivation to maintain glucose control during 
pregnancy and tighter glycemic targets. Despite 
impressive glycemic control with sensor-aug-
mented pump therapy, closed-loop therapy still 
generated substantial improvements when used 
overnight.
Our sample was small but included women 
with a long duration of diabetes and substantial 
prior obstetrical morbidity, including five spon-
taneous pregnancy losses, one second-trimester 
termination, four early preterm deliveries, and 
two stillbirths. Such factors perhaps contributed 
to the high rate of preeclampsia. Among the in-
fants, there were high incidences of birth weight 
above the 90th percentile for gestational age and 
neonatal hypoglycemia, despite the good glyce-
mic control achieved. Fetal hyperinsulinemia 
and increased placental fuel transfer can persist

Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery during Pregnancy
with apparently normal maternal glycemia and 
may in part explain these outcomes.32 Larger trials 
of closed-loop therapy for a longer period are 
needed to evaluate the effects of this therapy on 
obstetrical and neonatal outcomes.
In conclusion, our crossover trial showed that 
overnight closed-loop therapy, as compared with 
sensor-augmented pump therapy, resulted in 
improved glucose control during pregnancy in 
women with type 1 diabetes. In the continuation 
phase, women receiving day-and-night closed-loop 
therapy maintained glycemic control during a 
high percentage of the time in a period that 
encompassed antenatal hospital admission, labor, 
and delivery.
