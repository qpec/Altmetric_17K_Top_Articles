Background: Sucralose is an organochlorine artificial sweetener approximately 600 times sweeter than sucrose 
and used in over 4,500 products. Long-term carcinogenicity bioassays on rats and mice conducted on behalf 
of the manufacturer have failed to show the evidence of carcinogenic effects.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the carcinogenic effect of sucralose in mice, using a sensitive 
experimental design.
Methods: Five groups of male (total n = 457) and five groups female (total n = 396) Swiss mice were treated 
from 12 days of gestation through the lifespan with sucralose in their feed at concentrations of 0, 500, 2,000, 
8,000, and 16,000 ppm.
Results: We found a significant dose-related increased incidence of males bearing malignant tumors (p < 0.05) 
and a significant dose-related increased incidence (p < 0.01) of hematopoietic neoplasias in males, in particular 
at the dose levels of 2,000 ppm (p < 0.01) and 16,000 ppm (p < 0.01).
Conclusions: These findings do not support previous data that sucralose is biologically inert. More studies are 
necessary to show the safety of sucralose, including new and more adequate carcinogenic bioassay on rats. 
Considering that millions of people are likely exposed, follow-up studies are urgent.

Introduction
Sucralose (4, 1, 6-trichlorogalactosucrose) is an intense 
organochlorine artificial sweetener approximately 600 
times sweeter than sucrose and manufactured substituting 
chlorine for three of the hydroxyl groups in sucrose. 1,2 The 
structural formula is presented in Fig. 1.
Sucralose was originally approved for use as a food 
ingredient in Canada in 1991. In 1998, the United States 
(US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permitted the 
use of sucralose in 15 food and beverage categories.3 In 
1999, the FDA expanded the use of sucralose to all cate-
gories of food and beverage.4 The acceptable daily intake 
level of sucralose in the US was established at 5 mg/kg 
of body weight (b.w.)3 and in Europe at 15 mg/kg b.w.5 In 
2004, the European Union approved the use of sucralose 
in a variety of products. 6 Sucralose accounts for 27.9% 
of the $1.146 billion global sweetener market7 and is 
utilized in over 4,500 products, including foods, bever-
ages, and drugs.8 For sucralose to be approved as a food 
additive, over 100 studies were included in the Sucralose 
Food Additive Petition (compiled by McNeil company) 
to demonstrate product safety.9 This is consistent with the 
1958 Food Additive Amendment10 that holds the manufac-
turer responsible for demonstrating product safety using 
well-conducted research and producing reliable results. 
Critical safety studies are available in the published liter-
ature and are briefly summarized below.
Sucralose is claimed stable at elevated temperatures and 
in low-pH products and does not have the bitter aftertaste 
attributed to some other artificial sweeteners.11 Hydrolysis 
of sucralose can occur during prolonged storage at high 
temperatures in highly acidic aqueous food products (e.g. 
sodas). The hydrolysis products, which may be ingested by 
consumers in limited situations, are 4-chloro-4-deoxy-ga-
lactose (4-CG) and 1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxyfructose 
(1,6-DCF).1 The absorption, distribution and metabolism

pattern in five species, including humans, seems to be 
similar.12–15
Sucralose is minimally absorbed after oral adminis-
tration, with 5–15% excreted in the urine and 85–90% 
excreted unchanged in the feces.1 Of the approximately 
15% absorbed, most is excreted unchanged and about 2–3% 
undergoes common phase II metabolism, specifically, glu-
coronidation. 13 Unchanged sucralose and its glucuronide 
conjugates are excreted in the urine without bioaccumu-
lation.12–15 Thus, an oral intake of sucralose is claimed to 
be largely unabsorbed, excreted largely unchanged, not 
metabolized as a source of energy or broken down to yield 
smaller chlorinated compounds, and therefore essentially 
inert in the body. However, the same authors detected the 
presence of metabolites of sucralose in the feces and urine 
of rats and humans by thin-layer chromatographic methods 
indicating that sucralose is metabolized in the gastrointes-
tinal tract and not secreted unchanged.
A recent report summarizing the results from a number 
of unpublished in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, 
conducted as part of the sucralose safety investigation, 
reported no evidence of genotoxicity of sucralose.16 
However, in other studies, the hydrolyzed product 1,6-
DCF was weakly mutagenic in both the Ames test and the 
L5178Y TK +/- assay and sucralose was weakly mutagenic 
in the mouse lymphoma mutation assay.3,17 A previous 
study also concluded that sucralose damaged the gastro-
intestinal organ’s DNA of mice in a comet test.18
In a short-term in vivo study, male Sprague-Dawley 
rats were orally treated for 12 weeks with Splenda, a 
commercial intense artificial sweetener containing 1.1% 
sucralose and 93.6% maltodextrine. The main aim of the 
study was to determine the effects of orally administered 
Splenda on the composition of the variously enhanced 
population of fecal microflora. At the end of the treat-
ment, half of the animals were sacrificed to determine the 
intestinal expression of the membrane efflux transporter 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 
metabolism system. The remaining animals were allowed 
to recover for 12 weeks and then sacrificed. The study 
found several adverse effects on the intestines including 
reduction of beneficial fecal microflora, increased fecal 
pH, increased body weight, enhanced intestinal expression 
of P-gp, CYP3A4, and CYP2D1; several of these changes 
differed from controls even after discontinuation of the 
treatment with Splenda.19
Acute toxicity exposure of mice and rats to sucralose 
administered by gavage did not show any adverse effect on 
the highest tested doses 10–16 g/kg b.w.20 To test the car-
cinogenic potential of sucralose, long-term carcinogenicity 
bioassays on Sprague-Dawley rats and on CD-1 mice were 
performed.21,22 The results of both studies failed to show 
any evidence of carcinogenic effects.
As part of a project started in 1997 by the Ramazzini 
Institute in Bologna (Italy) to test the carcinogenic poten-
tial of widely used intense artificial sweeteners primarily 
in aspartame,23–28 a study on the carcinogenic potential 
of sucralose administered with feed to Swiss mice was 
undertaken. Because human exposure to sucralose might 
occur during in utero development and during adolescence 
and in order to increase the sensitivity of the study, the 
exposure began prenatally and lasted until death.
Material and methods
Nutraceutica (Monterenzio, Bo, Italy) supplied the sucra-
lose for this experiment. The certified grade of purity 
was 99.4% and the impurities were as follows: methanol 
0.05%; heavy metals < 0.1 ppm. Sucralose was pulver-
ized in a standard pelleted diet at concentrations 0, 500, 
2,000, 8,000, and 16,000 ppm and was administered to 
groups of male (n = 117, 114, 90, 66, and 70, respectively) 
and female (n = 102, 105, 60, 65, and 64, respectively) 
Swiss mice from the 12th day of fetal life until death. The 
16,000 ppm dose level of sucralose was selected based on 
available data reported in the literature and to avoid dose 
levels producing poor palatability. Laboratorio Dottori 
Piccioni (Milan, Italy) provided the standard “Corticella 
diet.” This same diet has been used for more than 30 years 
in the laboratory. The diet was analyzed for nutritional 
components, micro-organisms, and potential contaminants 
(pesticides, heavy metals, estrogen activity, nitrosamines) 
every six months. The main constituents of the diet were: 
12% water; 24% raw protein; 3.5% raw fat; 5.5% raw 
fibers; 10.5% ashes; and 56.5% non-nitrogen extracts. The 
pulverized sucralose was stable in the pelleted feed before 
the start of the study and was periodically checked during 
the experiment. Feed and water were supplied at libitum. 
Charles River Laboratories (Milan, Italy) supplied path-
ogen-free Swiss mice used to generate the experimental 
animals. After a 40-day quarantine period the breeders 
were randomly distributed by weight into three groups of 
40 and two groups of 60, encompassing the same number 
of males and females (n = 240). Due to the external ori-
gin of the animals, this matching is considered outbred. 
At 13 weeks of age, one male and one female breeder 
were placed in each cage for five days, after which males 
were removed from the cages. Dietary exposure of the 
experimental animals started on day 12 of fetal life with 
the administration of sucralose in feed to female breeders. 
All male and female pups of each litter were used in the 
experiment to reach the programmed number per sex per 
group and to allow the evaluation of a potential family

effect in the carcinogenic process. This results in an une-
qual distribution of animals among groups, with an “odd” 
number per group. The pups were weaned between four 
and five weeks of age, identified by ear punch and assigned 
to the respective dose groups. The offspring were housed 
10 per cage in polycarbonate cages (41 x 25 x 15 cm) 
with stainless steel wire tops and a shallow layer of white 
wood shavings as bedding. All cages were housed in the 
same room, with a daily light cycle of 12 h, at a temper-
ature of 23 ± 2 °C and relative humidity of 50–60%. The 
experiment was conducted in accordance with Italian law 
regulating the use and humane treatment of animals for 
scientific purposes.29 Drinking water and feed consump-
tion by cage were measured weekly for 13 weeks, and 
every two weeks thereafter, from six weeks of age until 
110 weeks of age. The body weight of each animal was 
measured weekly for 13 weeks and thereafter every two 
weeks until 110 weeks of age, and after that, every eight 
weeks until the end of the experiment. Clinical checks 
on the animals to monitor and record healthy signs and 
symptoms and gross pathological lesions were performed 
concurrently with the measurement of body weight from 6 
to 110 weeks of age and, after that, every two weeks until 
the end of the experiment. To avoid postmortem modifica-
tions as much as possible, a patrol was performed two to 
three times daily. During the health control, unhealthy or 
moribund animals were isolated from the others to avoid 
cannibalization. Moribund animals were euthanized to 
minimize suffering and autolysis. Deceased animals were 
stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C and necropsies were per-
formed within 16–19 h following detection.
At 130 weeks of age, 57 mice were still alive (6.7%), 
equally distributed per group in females but less homoge-
neous among males (0.0% at the highest dose and 4.5, 2.5, 
2.6% for the other decreasing doses, compared to 7.7% in 
controls). Since the number of animal alive was < 10%, a 
final sacrifice was planned and the remaining mice were 
euthanized with CO2 overexposure over the following 
9 days, equally distributing the animals per group and 
sex each day. Liver, femur, and neoplastic lesions (> 1 cm 
of diameter) samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and 
stored at -70 °C for further biomolecular analysis.
During necropsy, all tissues and organs were exam-
ined to detect visible alterations. The following organs 
and tissues were collected: skin and subcutaneous tissue, 
mammary gland (four sites: axillary and inguinal, right 
and left), brain (three sagittal sections), pituitary gland, 
Zymbal glands, salivary glands, Harderian glands, cranium 
(five sections, encompassing oral and nasal cavity, external 
and internal ear ducts), tongue, thyroid, and parathyroid, 
pharynx, larynx, thymus and mediastinal lymph nodes, 
trachea, lung and mainstream bronchi, heart, diaphragm, 
liver, cholecyst, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, adrenal glands, 
esophagus, stomach (fore and glandular), intestine (four 
levels), urinary bladder, prostate, testes, uterus, vagina, 
subcutaneous, and mesenteric lymph nodes, sternum with 
bone marrow, and other organs/tissues with pathological 
changes. All organs and tissues were preserved in solvanol 
70% (a mixture of ethyl and isopropyl alcohol, respec-
tively, approx. 60% and 40%, obtained from VITAL SRL, 
(Bologna, Italy), apart from bone tissues, which were pre-
served in 10% formalin and then decalcified with 10% 
formaldehyde and 20% formic acid in water solution. All 
lesions were trimmed including a portion of normal adja-
cent tissue. The tissues were embedded in paraffin blocks 
and sections of 3–5 μm were cut for each specimen and 
stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Microscopical evalua-
tion was performed for all tissues and organs of all animals 
in each group. A single pathologist evaluated all slides 
and two pathologists reviewed all tumors and lesions of 
oncologic interest. The statistical analyses of survival and 
of the malignant neoplastic lesions were based on the Cox 
proportional hazard regression model,30 which adjusts for 
possible differential survival among experimental groups.
Results
The breeding proceeded well without any setbacks and 
was not affected by the treatment with sucralose. Indeed, 
the percentage of pregnant females varied between 90% 
and 96% among the groups, apart from the group exposed

consumption were observed in treated males and females 
compared to controls.
Concerning body weight, a slight increase was observed 
in males treated at the lowest dose (500 ppm) compared to 
controls (Fig. 4). This increase was evident from 40 weeks 
until 104 weeks of age. No differences were observed 
among other male treated groups. In females treated at 
500 and 2,000 ppm, a slight increase in body weight was 
evident from 72 to 104 weeks of age (Fig. 5). No clinical

lower (83%). The average number of pups per litter was 
between 12 and 13 and the body weight of each pup meas-
ured one week after delivery was between 4.4 and 4.5 g in 
the treated and control groups.
The feed consumption showed that right from the 
beginning both males and females were unaffected by any 
reduced palatability of the diet containing sucralose. As 
shown in Figs. 2 and 3, no substantial differences in food

Total benign and malignant tumors
The descriptive occurrence of benign and malignant tum-
ors of various organs and tissues in males and females 
is reported in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The overall 
incidences of benign and malignant tumors are reported 
in Table 3. The data show: 1) in males, an increased inci-
dence of cortical adenoma in the various treated groups; a 
significant increased incidence of malignant tumor-bear-
ing animals exposed at 16,000 ppm (p ≤ 0.05) with a 
significant dose-related trend (p ≤ 0.05). The tumor type 
that contributed most to this increased incidence was 
hematopoietic neoplasias; 2) in females, an increased 
incidence benign tumors and total tumors per 100 ani-
mals treated at various doses of sucralose, in particu-
lar harderian adenoma, polyp of the glandular stomach, 
adenoma, and cystodenoma of the ovaries and polyp of 
the uterus.
Hematopoietic neoplasias 
The occurrence of hematopoietic neoplasias in males and 
females is reported in Table 3. The data show that sucra-
lose induces significant increased incidence of all hemato-
poietic neoplasias in males exposed to 2,000 (p ≤ 0.01), 
and 16,000 ppm (p ≤ 0.01), with a significant dose-related 
relationship (p ≤ 0.01), as shown also by the cumulative 
hazard by Kaplan–Meier estimation (Fig. 7). The majority 
of these neoplasias were grossly visible during necropsy 
and involved multiple organs such as thymus, spleen, liver, 
and lymph nodes.
Microscopically, most of the neoplasias among males 
treated with sucralose at 2,000–16,000 ppm were leu-
kemias involving lungs, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and 
bone marrow with diffuse permeation of vessels (Fig. 8) 
and extensive infiltration of adjacent tissues (Figs. 9 and 
10). Sparse cases of histiocytic sarcomas in males were 
observed among the groups. At an advanced stage of the

times vacuolated. The nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio was 
high and mitotic figures were numerous (Fig. 11).
Discussion
This study showed that sucralose administered in feed to 
Swiss mice at dose levels of 0, 500, 2,000, 8,000, and 
16,000 ppm from prenatal life until natural death induces 
a significant dose-related increased incidence of malig-
nant tumors (p ≤ 0.01) in male mice. Moreover, a sig-
nificant dose-related increased incidence (p ≤ 0.01) of 
neoplasias, the spleen was markedly enlarged with loss of 
the normal architecture. The liver was infiltrated by large 
neoplastic cells sometimes associated with degenerative 
changes, which were accompanied by nodular regenera-
tive hyperplastic lesions. Other organs such as brain and 
adrenal glands were sometimes also involved. The cells 
appeared medium–large sized with a non-cohesive pattern 
of homogeneous sheets, while nuclei were round, oval, 
and pleomorphic, with varying degrees of differentiation. 
Cytoplasm was moderate in amount, basophilic, and at

difference in the incidences of animals bearing malignant 
tumors, it must be noted that among males treated at the 
highest dose, the incidence was lower than 14% compared 
to controls (38% vs. 44%) and in females the incidence 
at the highest dose was 25% lower than in controls (29% 
vs. 39%).
These results may be affected by the 20% decrease in 
the mean body weight in both males and females treated at 
the highest dose as compared to controls. This observation 
is reinforced by the negative results obtained in the sucra-
lose rat study performed by Mann et al.22 in which the male 
and female rats, at all doses, had significant (p < 0.01) 
decreased body weight compared to controls and the inci-
dence of benign and malignant tumors was lower in all 
treated groups than in controls. It has long been known, 
of course, how body weight may influence the incidence 
of malignant tumors in humans33 and in mice and rats.34,35
Moreover, the negative results of Mann et al.21 may be 
due to the different experimental conditions in which the 
compound was tested in mice, and particularly to the fact 
that in that bioassay the number of animals per sex/group 
was lower, while the experiment started at adolescent 
age, and terminated at 110 weeks of age. These factors, 
are considered to be critical points for identification and 
assessment of carcinogenic risks,28,36–40 make the Mann et 
al. study on mice less sensitive than ours.
Finally, one cannot disregard the fact that sucralose 
itself and the hydrolysis product 1,6-DCF were found to 
be weakly mutagenic and that sucralose is able to alter 
the bacterial composition of the gastrointestinal tract. In 
fact, accumulating data suggest that the microbiota has a 
role in the causes of several types of cancer by influencing 
inflammation, DNA damage, and apoptosis.41
In conclusions, our data do not support the previous 
findings of industry authors that sucralose is a biologically 
inert compound. More studies are necessary to determine 
the safety of this food additive, including a new more 
adequate long-term transplacental carcinogenic bioassay 
on rats. We believe these studies are urgent, considering 
that millions of people may be exposed, including women 
in child-bearing age and children.
Conflict of interest

this work. We also declare that our finding sources had no 
direct role in the study design, data collection, analysis, 
and interpretation of the data in the writing of the manu-
script, or in decision to publish the work.

hematopoietic neoplasias was observed in males, in par-
ticular at the exposure levels of 2,000 ppm (p ≤ 0.01) and 
16,000 ppm (p ≤ 0.01). Since the survival among males 
showed significant differences among the groups, the Cox 
proportional hazard regression model was used to evaluate 
the results of the neoplasias.30
Concerning the plausibility of a causal correlation 
between exposure to sucralose and significant increase 
in the incidence of hematopoietic neoplasias in male 
mice, it is unlikely that this finding is due to chance if we 
consider that: 1) the incidence of the concurrent control 
group (8.5%) falls in the range of the overall historical 
control incidence (5.7%; range: 0.0–12.5%) and the inci-
dence of hematopoietic neoplasias in the males exposed 
to 16,000, 8,000, and 2,000 ppm significantly exceeded 
the higher range of the historical controls; 2) if among the 
males exposed to the highest dose we exclude the animals 
bearing hematopoietic neoplasms, the survival is almost 
the same as among controls; 3) the cumulative hazard is 
much higher among males treated at 16,000, 8,000, and 
2,000 ppm than in males exposed to 500 or 0 ppm (Fig. 
7). Moreover in our study, we observed: 1) an anticipated 
onset of hematopoietic neoplasias associated with early 
increased mortality; and 2) an increased incidence of such 
lesions at the end of the study. This is in agreement with 
previous literature concerning induced hematopoietic neo-
plasias in mice.31,32
The evidence of the carcinogenic effects of sucralose in 
our mouse study is not in agreement with the negative con-
clusions obtained with the CD-1 mouse study performed 
by Mann et al.21
Indeed the Mann et al. results showed: 1) no statisti-
cally significant differences in feed consumption among 
the groups, apart from a slightly lower feed intake among 
females of the high-dose group as compared to controls. 
Water consumption in male mice treated at the highest 
dose was moderately increased as compared to controls; 
2) the mean body weight gain in both males and females 
receiving the 30,000 ppm concentration of sucralose was 
significantly lower than 20% (p < 0.01) compared to con-
trols during the 104 weeks of treatment; 3) differences in 
survival were not observed among the groups at the end 
of treatment. At 110–111 weeks of age (end of the exper-
iment), the percentages of survival were 35% or greater 
among the groups; 4) mice treated at the highest dose had 
erythrocyte counts that were 7–9% lower than those of the 
controls and in females the difference was statistically sig-
nificant (p < 0.05). Other hematological parameters were 
unaffected and no difference in the incidence of hemato-
poietic neoplasia was observed among the groups; 5) no 
statistically significant increase in the incidence of male 
and female mice bearing malignant tumors were observed 
in treated groups compared to controls. No significant 
increase in the incidence of any type of tumors related to 
exposure to sucralose was observed; and 6) concerning the
