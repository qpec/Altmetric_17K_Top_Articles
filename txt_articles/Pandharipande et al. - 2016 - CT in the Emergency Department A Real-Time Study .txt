Purpose:
To determine how physicians’ diagnoses, diagnostic un-
certainty, and management decisions are affected by the 
results of computed tomography (CT) in emergency depart-
ment settings.
Materials and 
Methods:
This study was approved by the institutional review board 
and compliant with HIPAA. Data were collected between 
July 12, 2012, and January 13, 2014. The requirement to 
obtain patient consent was waived. In this prospective, 
four-center study, patients presenting to the emergency de-
partment who were referred for CT with abdominal pain, 
chest pain and/or dyspnea, or headache were identified. 
Physicians were surveyed before and after CT to determine 
the leading diagnosis, diagnostic confidence (on a scale of 
0% to 100%), alternative “rule out” diagnosis, and man-
agement decisions. Primary measures were the proportion 
of patients for whom the leading diagnosis or admission 
decision changed and median changes in diagnostic confi-
dence. Secondary measures addressed alternative diagnoses 
and return-to-care visits (eg, to emergency department) at 
1-month follow-up. Regression analysis was used to identify 
associations between primary measures and site and partic-
ipant characteristics.
Results:
Both surveys were completed for 1280 patients by 245 phy-
sicians. The leading diagnosis changed in 235 of 460 patients 
with abdominal pain (51%), 163 of 387 with chest pain and/
or dyspnea (42%), and 103 of 433 with headache (24%). 
Pre-CT diagnostic confidence was inversely associated with 
the likelihood of a diagnostic change (P , .0001). Median 
changes in confidence were substantial (increases of 25%, 
20%, and 13%, respectively, for patients with abdominal 
pain, chest pain and/or dyspnea, and headache; P , .0001); 
median post-CT confidence was high (95% for all three 
groups). CT helped confirm or exclude at least 95% of alter-
native diagnoses. Admission decisions changed in 116 of 457 
patients with abdominal pain (25%), 72 of 387 with chest 
pain and/or dyspnea (19%), and 81 of 426 with headache 
(19%). During follow-up, 70 of 450 patients with abdomi-
nal pain (15%), 53 of 387 with chest pain and/or dyspnea 
(14%), and 49 of 433 with headache (11%) returned for the 
same indication. In general, changes in leading diagnosis, 
diagnostic confidence, and admission decisions were not well 
explained with site or participant characteristics.
Conclusion:
Physicians’ diagnoses and admission decisions changed fre-
quently after CT, and diagnostic uncertainty was alleviated.

HEALTH POLICY AND PRACTICE: CT in the Emergency Department 
Pandharipande et al
this gap in evidence, we conducted a 
prospective, multicenter, observational 
study to determine how CT affects phy-
sician decision making in patients pre-
senting to the emergency department 
with abdominal pain, chest pain and/
or dyspnea, and headache. Our pur-
pose was to determine how physicians’ 
diagnoses, diagnostic uncertainty, and 
management decisions are affected by 
the results of CT examinations in emer-
gency department settings.
Materials and Methods
This study was supported by a research 
grant awarded by the National Electri-
cal Manufacturers Association (Med-
ical Imaging and Technology Alliance 
Division). Funds supported personnel 
and computer equipment necessary to 
execute the research. The authors had 
control of the study data and informa-
tion submitted for publication.
Each participating center’s insti-
tutional review board approved the 
study before its initiation. All physi-
cians were consented with an opt-in 
or opt-out mechanism. Remuneration 
for physicians’ participation was at the 
department level ($7500 per emer-
gency department) rather than at the 
individual physician level. Each center’s 
institutional review board waived the 
requirement to obtain patient consent. 
All research activities were compliant 
making in incontrovertible ways—for 
example, sparing patients with a nor-
mal appendix from surgery (8,9).
Ensuring that physicians order CT 
examinations only when necessary 
is important to patients and policy-
makers alike. However, evidence that 
addresses the current role of CT in 
common emergency department set-
tings is sparse (10–15). Prospective 
studies that map changes in physician 
decision making after CT have focused 
on abdominal pain and are limited 
to single institutions (10,11,13–15). 
Moreover, they may not reflect current 
practice norms because they draw 
from data collected more than 5 years 
ago (10,11,13–15). Collectively, their 
results suggest that changes in leading 
diagnosis and management after CT—
and improvements in diagnostic con-
fidence—are common (10,11,13–15). 
Conflicting observations have been 
reported when emergency department 
physicians are queried about their 
general perceptions of CT referrals; 
in a survey study of 435 emergency 
department physicians, most believed 
that CT was overused in common 
emergency department scenarios, in-
cluding abdominal pain (16).
To address concerns about CT uti-
lization, research studies designed to 
delineate the current role of CT across 
common emergency department re-
ferral indications—and to evaluate 
whether key external factors (eg, the re-
ferring physician’s years of experience) 
may attenuate or explain its perceived 
benefits—are needed. Without such 
inquiry, future policies that are formu-
lated to optimize CT utilization will lack 
an adequate evidence basis and may 
be ineffective or harmful. To address

Advances in Knowledge
 
n In this prospective, multicenter 
study, we found that, for common 
referral indications for CT in the 
emergency department (ie, ab-
dominal pain, chest pain and/or 
dyspnea, and headache), physi-
cians frequently changed their 
leading diagnosis (51%, 42%, and 
24% of patients with abdominal 
pain, chest pain and/or dyspnea, 
and headache, respectively), diag-
nostic confidence (median 
increase of 25%, 20%, 13%), and 
admission decisions (25%, 19%, 
and 19% of patients with abdom-
inal pain, chest pain and/or dys-
pnea, and headache, respectively) 
after CT results were available.
 
n Across all indications, we found 
that physicians’ diagnostic confi-
dence before CT was inversely 
related to the likelihood of a 
change in leading diagnosis after 
CT (P , .0001), supporting the 
use of diagnostic confidence as a 
measure of diagnostic uncer-
tainty; moreover, after CT, 
median diagnostic confidence 
levels were uniformly high (95% 
for all three patient groups), in-
dicating that uncertainty was 
alleviated.
 
n We found that site and partici-
pant (physician and patient) 
characteristics did not consis-
tently or meaningfully influence 
our findings, which supports the 
generalizability of our results to 
other similar centers.
Implication for Patient Care
 
n For common referral indications 
to CT in emergency department 
settings, physicians’ diagnoses 
and admission decisions change 
frequently after CT and diagnos-
tic uncertainty is alleviated; these 
findings suggest that current or-
dering practices are clinically 
justified.
I
n the past 2 decades, computed to-
mography (CT) utilization in emer-
gency departments across the United 
States has increased more than three-
fold; however, whether patients have 
benefitted is unclear (1–5). Some argue 
that emergency department physicians, 
who face ever-increasing demands to 
make clinical decisions quickly and ac-
curately, order too many CT examina-
tions. Implications of overuse include 
excess radiation exposure, incidental 
findings, and costs generated (6,7). 
Conversely, CT can assist decision

staffing was not feasible. Across sites, 
study staff hours generally began at 8 
am and terminated between 7 pm and 
12 am. Occasional weekend coverage 
was possible at one site; however, at all 
other sites case accrual occurred dur-
ing the weekdays only. In addition, phy-
sicians were not always accessible (eg, 
during high-acuity events).
To address these limitations, stan-
dard operating procedures for case 
identification were prospectively de-
veloped in all centers, with review and 
final approval from the coordinating 
center, to ensure that practices were 
uniform and selection bias was min-
imized. Key principles and steps in-
cluded the following: (a) continuous 
and consecutive identification of all po-
tentially eligible cases during research 
staff’s shifts by using automated lists of 
scheduled emergency department CT 
examinations; (b) corresponding iden-
tification and approach of the referring 
physician; (c) verification of the indi-
cation for CT with the referring phy-
sician; (d) use of a prespecified hier-
archical approach to determine which 
survey type (ie, abdominopelvic, chest, 
or head) took priority if multiple eligi-
ble CT examinations were ordered for 
one patient; and (d) rejection of phy-
sician-initiated requests for surveys on 
specific cases. With these constraints in 
place, our goal was to achieve a repre-
sentative sample.
Review of medical records.—Pa-
tient charts were reviewed to evaluate 
care in the month after the index CT 
examination. The number of return 
visits (ie, to the emergency depart-
ment or for direct hospital admission) 
was the primary follow-up metric eval-
uated. Our goal in reporting this infor-
mation was to further characterize the 
study population to inform the gener-
alizability of our results. Decisions as 
to whether return visits were attribut-
able to the same indication as the in-
dex CT examination were prospectively 
recorded, with oversight from phy-
sician site investigators at each cen-
ter. Site investigators’ specialties and 
years of professional experience were 
as follows: A.T.R., emergency medi-
cine, 14 years of experience; W.D.B., 
CT protocols. Double enrollment of pa-
tients was not permitted.
Study Procedures
Pilot study and pretesting the survey 
instruments.—A pilot study was com-
pleted in the coordinating center from 
2006 to 2008 (10). Drawing from this 
experience, we convened a team to de-
velop new survey instruments. Practic-
ing emergency department physicians, 
radiologists, and experts in survey re-
search and decision science were rep-
resented. Diagnoses and management 
options were selected to ensure that 
common, clinically distinct options 
were comprehensively included. Pre-
liminary surveys underwent pretest-
ing and revision for 1 month (May 22, 
2012, to June 22, 2012) at the coordi-
nating center. Final survey instruments 
are included in Figures E1–E6 (online).
Case identification, survey com-
pletion, and data management.—Case 
identification was accomplished with 
real-time review of CT requisitions. 
For each eligible case, study staff ap-
proached the responsible physician to 
complete a pre-CT survey. When CT 
results were available, the same physi-
cian—or a new physician who was re-
sponsible for the patient if sign-off had 
occurred—was approached to complete 
the post-CT survey. Surveys were ad-
ministered by using mixed modes (elec-
tronic or paper and interview-assisted 
or self-administered) to accommodate 
different workflows. Most commonly, 
physicians completed surveys with in-
terview assistance from study staff and 
responses were entered directly into an 
online electronic database. Physicians 
self-administered paper instruments 
at one site routinely, and at another 
site in the minority of their cases. The 
paper surveys were then returned to 
the study staff for online entry. We re-
quired pre-CT surveys to be completed 
before results of CT were available; 
post-CT surveys could be completed 
up to 7 days after CT. All data were 
entered in a repository within the re-
search electronic data capture or RED-
Cap application (17).
Consecutive case accrual was not 
possible. Twenty-four-hour research 
with the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act.
Overview of the Study Design
This prospective, multicenter, obser-
vational study was designed as a phy-
sician survey study in which surveys 
were linked to active patient cases. 
Four urban U.S. academic medical 
centers participated in the study. The 
medical centers were located in the 
Northeast, 
Mid-Atlantic, 
South-At-
lantic, and Pacific-Northwest regions. 
There were 62 
000–100 
000 emergency 
department visits per center annually. 
In the emergency departments of par-
ticipating centers, study staff identified 
patients who were scheduled for CT 
for one of three nontraumatic indica-
tions: abdominal pain, chest pain and/
or dyspnea, and headache. For each 
case, we surveyed physicians in real 
time before CT to obtain their lead-
ing diagnosis, their confidence in that 
diagnosis (on a scale of 0% to 100%), 
an alternative “rule out” diagnosis, if 
applicable, and their management plan 
if CT were not available. When CT re-
sults became available, we surveyed 
physicians again to identify changes in 
their responses and determine if CT 
helped address alternative diagnoses. 
Medical records were reviewed one 
calendar month after CT to evaluate 
subsequent, related care.
Study Population: Physician and Patient 
Subjects
Case accrual in the four centers was 
started between January 12, 2012, and 
October 13, 2012, and terminated be-
tween October 12, 2013, and January 
13, 2014, spanning 15 months per cen-
ter. Eligible physicians were trainees 
(beyond their 1st postgraduate year) 
and attending physicians who cared for 
patients as part of the emergency de-
partment service. Eligible patients were 
adults (18 years) undergoing CT for 
a study indication. Inclusion was based 
on the indication for CT rather than the 
CT technique used. Patients scheduled 
for perfusion CT of the brain, cerebral 
and neck CT angiography, and cardiac 
CT were excluded because of the re-
stricted diagnoses addressed with these

same indication as that for the index 
CT examination.
Univariate and multiple regression 
analysis were performed to identify as-
sociations between site and participant 
(physician and patient) characteris-
tics and study measures. Independent 
variables were as follows: site of care, 
years of professional experience for the 
physician, training status (attending vs 
trainee), physician race and sex, and 
patient age and sex. Further details 
about race and ethnicity are provided in 
Appendix E1 (online). Dependent vari-
ables were as follows: change in lead-
ing diagnosis (with logistic regression), 
change in diagnostic confidence level 
(with linear regression), and change 
in admission decision (with logistic 
regression).
Characteristics of physicians who 
completed both pre- and post-CT sur-
veys for at least one patient were com-
pared with those who did not (x2 test). 
Characteristics of patients for whom 
the same physician completed both 
pre- and post-CT surveys were com-
pared with those for whom only a pre-
CT survey was completed or for whom 
a different physician filled out pre- and 
post-CT surveys (x2 test).
The study was powered on the ba-
sis of the expected change in diagnos-
tic confidence; an accrual target of 540 
completed cases, per indication, was 
established. Details of the power cal-
culation are provided in Appendix E1 
(online).
Results
Physicians Enrolled and Cases Accrued
A total of 437 eligible physicians were 
approached for participation; 432 phy-
sicians (99%) consented for participa-
tion and 245 (56%) filled in both por-
tions (pre- and post-CT) of a completed 
survey. Baseline characteristics of the 
245 physicians who completed both 
portions of the survey are provided in 
Table 1. Pre-CT surveys were obtained 
for 1811 patients; post-CT surveys were 
completed for 1499 of the 1811 patients 
(83%). For most patients (85%, 1280 
of 1499 patients), the same physician 
emergency medicine, 17 years of expe-
rience; A.Z., radiologist, 7 years of ex-
perience; M.L.G., radiologist, 9 years 
of experience; K.F.L., radiologist, 4 
years of experience; and C.M.M., ra-
diologist, 10 years of experience.
Statistical Analysis
We used software (SAS version 9.3; 
SAS, Cary, NC) for statistical analysis. 
Data were analyzed per indication and 
addressed the completed dataset (cases 
for which both pre- and post-CT sur-
veys were completed). Most survey data 
were automatically coded on the basis 
of a physician’s selection of prespecified 
response options; write-in responses 
were addressed as detailed in Appendix 
E1 (online). For comparisons, P , .05 
was considered indicative of a statisti-
cally significant difference.
This analysis was restricted to cases 
in which the same physician completed 
both pre- and post-CT surveys. The 
proportion of patients for whom the 
leading diagnosis changed was calcu-
lated. For common pre-CT diagnoses 
(.5.0% of responses), we also deter-
mined whether the likelihood of a di-
agnostic change varied according to 
diagnosis (x2 test). To verify diagnostic 
confidence as a measure of diagnostic 
uncertainty, we determined whether 
pre-CT diagnostic confidence was asso-
ciated with the likelihood of a diagnos-
tic change (logistic regression). Median 
changes in diagnostic confidence were 
calculated (rounded up to the nearest 
integer); we evaluated the statistical 
significance of changes in all cases and 
in those where the leading diagnosis 
did—versus did not—change (Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test). The proportion of 
cases in which CT helped confirm or 
exclude an alternative diagnosis was 
calculated. The proportion of cases in 
which an admission decision changed 
was calculated. In addition, we evalu-
ated whether the proportion of cases in 
which management changed toward—
versus away from—admission was sig-
nificant (McNemar test).
The proportion of patients who re-
turned to care (defined earlier) was cal-
culated, as was the proportion whose 
return visits were attributable to the

the leading diagnosis changed, these 
values were +30% and 90%, +25% and 
90%, and +35% and 90%, respectively. 
When the leading diagnosis did not 
change, these values were +20% and 
99%, +20% and 95%, and +10% and 
95%, respectively (Table 2, Fig 2). Me-
dian changes were significant with all 
analyses (P , .0001).
When physicians recorded an alter-
native (“rule out”) diagnosis, CT was 
reported as helpful in confirming or ex-
cluding this diagnosis in 345 of 356 pa-
tients with abdominal pain (97%), 319 
of 328 with chest pain and/or dyspnea 
(97%), and 348 of 368 with headache 
(95%) (Table 2). Recorded alterna-
tive diagnoses were confirmed in 28 
of 345 patients with abdominal pain 
(8%), 34 of 319 with chest pain and/
or dyspnea (11%), and eight of 348 
with headache (2%).
Changes in admission decisions 
occurred in 116 of 457 patients with 
abdominal pain (25%), 72 of 387 with 
chest pain and/or dyspnea (19%), and 
81 of 426 with headache (19%) (Table 
2). Significant differences were not ob-
served when comparing the proportions 
of cases in which decisions changed to-
ward—versus away from—admission (P 
= .22, P = .56, and P = .66 for patients 
with abdominal pain, chest pain and/or 
dyspnea, and headache, respectively).
Patient Follow-up
Follow-up information was available 
during medical record review for 300 
of 460 patients with abdominal pain 
(65%), 266 of 387 with chest pain 
and/or dyspnea (69%), and 249 of 433 
with headache (57%). Of the 460 pa-
tients with abdominal pain, 70 (15%) 
returned to care for related reasons 
(a total of 103 [22%] returned). Of 
the 387 patients with chest pain and/
or dyspnea, 53 (14%) returned to care 
for related reasons (a total of 90 [23%] 
returned). Of the 433 patients with 
headache, 49 (11%) returned to care 
for related reasons (a total of 85 [20%] 
returned). The proportion of patients 
with return visits did not differ signifi-
cantly among sites. For returns related 
to the indication for CT, P values were 
0.19, 0.88, and 0.97 for patients with 
difference was attributable to a rotating 
non–emergency medicine trainee work-
force that spent less time in the emer-
gency department and therefore was 
less likely to encounter eligible cases. 
Relative to completed cases in which 
the same physician filled in both pre- 
and post-CT surveys, cases in which 
only a pre-CT survey was completed—
or in which a different physician filled 
in the pre- and post-CT surveys—were 
comprised of older patients (mean age 
= 54 vs 51 years, P , .003) and fewer 
female (52% [278 of 531 patients]

Changes in Diagnosis, Diagnostic 
Confidence, and Admission Decisions
Changes in leading diagnosis occurred 
in 235 of 460 patients with abdominal 
pain (51%), 163 of 387 patients with 
chest pain and/or dyspnea (42%), and 
103 of 433 patients with headache 
(24%) (Table 2). The most common 
pre-CT leading diagnoses, per indica-
tion, were urinary tract stone, pulmo-
nary embolus, and benign headache, 
respectively (Table 3). For all indica-
tions, the likelihood of a change in lead-
ing diagnosis differed according to the 
specific pre-CT diagnosis (P , .0001) 
(Table 3). Detailed profiles of pre- and 
post-CT diagnoses are provided in Ap-
pendix E1 and Figure E7 (online).
For all indications, pre-CT diagnos-
tic confidence was significantly and in-
versely associated with the likelihood of 
a diagnostic change (P , .0001), verify-
ing diagnostic confidence as a measure 
of diagnostic uncertainty. Notably, even 
when diagnostic confidence was more 
than 90%, the leading diagnosis still 
changed in three of 30 patients with 
abdominal pain (10%), six of 29 with 
chest pain and/or dyspnea (21%), and 
two of 49 with headache (4%) (Fig 1).
Median absolute changes in diag-
nostic confidence and median post-CT 
diagnostic confidence levels, respec-
tively, were as follows: +25% and 95% 
for abdominal pain, +20% and 95% for 
chest pain and/or dyspnea, and +13% 
and 95% for headache (Table 2). When 
completed both surveys. Completion 
rates according to site and indication 
are provided in Table E1 (online).
Baseline characteristics for the 
1280 patients for whom pre- and post-
CT surveys were completed by the 
same physician are provided in Table 1. 
Most of the surveys (66%, 843 of 1280 
patients) were completed by an attend-
ing physician rather than a trainee. The 
mean and median number of cases 
completed per physician (when count-
ing a pre- and post-CT survey together 
as one) was 5.2 (standard deviation = 
5.5) and 4, respectively. Across indica-
tions (abdominal pain, chest pain and/
or dyspnea, and headache), post-CT 
surveys were completed on the same 
day as the index CT examination in 
most cases (83% [379 of 454 patients], 
91% [351 of 384 patients], and 92% 
[394 of 429 patients], respectively), as 
further detailed in Table E2 (online).
Relative to physicians who com-
pleted both pre- and post-CT surveys 
for at least one case, those who did not 
were more likely to be non–emergency 
medicine physicians (61% [118 of 192 
physicians] vs 11% [28 of 245 physi-
cians], P , .0001) and trainees (79% 
[152 of 192 physicians] vs 50% [123 
of 245 physicians], P , .0001). This

Regression Analysis Results: Site and 
Participant Characteristics
In general, changes in leading diagno-
sis, diagnostic confidence, and admis-
sion decisions were not well explained 
with site and participant characteristics 
(Table E3 [online]). At multiple regres-
sion analysis, the site of care demon-
strated the greatest frequency of sig-
nificant associations with dependent 
variables (Table E3 [online]). Notably, 
such associations were not necessarily 
associated with substantial site-to-site 
variation. For example, for patients 
with abdominal pain, site was associ-
ated with the magnitude of physicians’ 
change in diagnostic confidence (P = 
.003). The corresponding range across 
sites, however, was narrow (+20% to 
+30%, Table 2). Respondent training 
status (attending vs trainee) was not 
significantly associated with any de-
pendent variable at multiple regression 
analysis across all indications studied. 
Physician sex, patient sex, and patient 
age were significantly associated with 
dependent variables only in isolated cir-
cumstances (Table E3 [online]). Note 
that P values for regression analyses 
may only be approximate owing to non-
normality of residuals.
Discussion
In this multicenter study of emergency 
department patients referred for CT 
owing to abdominal pain, chest pain 
and/or dyspnea, or headache, we found 
CT to substantially influence key attrib-
utes of physician decision making. Phy-
sicians changed their leading diagnosis 
for one-fourth to one-half of patients, 
across indications, after CT results be-
came available. Before CT, physicians 
demonstrated considerable diagnostic 
uncertainty, whereas after CT, diagnos-
tic confidence improved substantially 
and significantly across indications, 
reaching uniformly high levels. In the 
vast majority of cases, physicians re-
ported CT to be helpful in addressing 
alternative, rule-out diagnoses of con-
cern; these diagnoses were confirmed 
in an important minority. Physicians’ 
admission decisions changed for one-
fifth to one-quarter of patients across 
indications. Site and participant char-
acteristics,

indications and sites of care—suggest 
that these drawbacks must be viewed 
carefully and with balance. Policies 
that prioritize their avoidance, and 
that broadly de-incentivize physicians 
to order CT examinations in emer-
gency department settings as a result, 
may ultimately compromise care by 
failing to account for the considerable 
benefits of CT.
The results of our study are com-
parable to those obtained in our single-
institution pilot study of patients with 
abdominal pain and those obtained in 
other similar studies focused on ab-
dominal pain (10,11,13,14). In the pilot 
study (vs our current study), the leading 
diagnosis changed in 49% (284 of 584 
patients) versus 51% (235 of 460 pa-
tients) of cases after CT (10). Diagnostic 
confidence increased by 22% (vs 20%) 
when there was no change in leading 
diagnosis and by 35% (vs 30%) when 
the leading diagnosis changed (10). 
Changes in management could not be 
readily compared owing to differences 
in response options and measures. 
However, across studies, substantial 
changes in management plans after 
CT—including admission decisions—
were observed (10,11,13,14). To our 
knowledge, there are no analogous 
studies for chest pain and/or dyspnea 
and headache. However, the similarity 
of our single-institution and multicen-
ter results for abdominal pain—despite 
the time elapsed, added institutions, 
and changes to the survey instruments 
and study design—strengthens the va-
lidity of our methods when applied to 
other indications.
Our study has several limitations. 
Given that enrollment occurred in 
large academic medical centers, our 
results may not be generalizable to 
other 
emergency 
department 
set-
tings. In particular, we included both 
trainees and attending physicians in 
our analysis. Although training status 
did not affect primary study outcomes, 
processes of decision making may dif-
fer in training hospitals in ways that 
are not generalizable to other centers. 
Surveys were administered by using 
mixed modes across sites to accom-
modate different workflows. Ideally, 
pre-CT 
diagnostic 
confidence 
was 
high—approaching 100%—in a rea-
sonable number of cases the leading 
diagnosis changed. These observations, 
together with the number of cases in 
which physicians’ diagnoses and admis-
sion decisions changed in our study, 
suggest that, in similar emergency de-
partment settings, current CT ordering 
practices provide a general benefit to 
physician decision making.
The importance of this study per-
tains to the ongoing health policy dia-
logue concerning CT utilization and, 
in particular, how CT benefits weigh 
against its risks and costs (1,3,18,19). 
For policymakers who make related 
judgments, our study provides evidence 
about the potential benefits of CT; we 
did not address its risks (eg, radia-
tion exposure) and costs. However, the 
magnitude and consistency of bene-
fits observed—across multiple clinical 
respondent physician was a trainee 
or attending, did not consistently or 
meaningfully influence these findings, 
which supports their generalizability. 
Our results indicate that, in emergency 
department settings, physicians fre-
quently make different diagnoses and 
decisions for their patients after CT and 
that diagnostic uncertainty is alleviated.
The most compelling insights stem 
from physicians’ diagnostic confidence. 
We found that physicians have a wide 
spectrum of pre-CT diagnostic confi-
dence across patients and are rational 
judges of their own uncertainty. Specifi-
cally, with increasing pre-CT diagnostic 
confidence, the likelihood of a post-CT 
change in leading diagnosis decreased, 
which suggests that the observed spec-
trum of pre-CT diagnostic uncertainty 
was valid. After CT, physicians’ diagnos-
tic confidence increased significantly. 
Furthermore, even when a physician’s

study well suited for a randomized con-
trolled trial (20). Our purpose was to 
examine how CT influenced physician 
decision making when accounting for 
the natural overlap in clinical presenta-
tions across multiple diseases, making 
a randomized controlled trial design ill-
suited for our purpose.
Consecutive enrollment could not 
be achieved. Although considerable 
measures were taken to achieve a ran-
dom sample in which selection bias was 
minimized, it was possible that occult 
biases were nonetheless present. Two 
examples of possible bias are provided. 
First, most study staff hours were dur-
ing the day and early evening from 
Monday through Friday. It is possible 
that patients who came to the emer-
gency department for the study indi-
cations of interest at other times pre-
sented distinct challenges to physician 
decision making that were not captured 
in our study. Second, although case 
identification occurred in a systematic 
fashion, it was possible that case re-
jection—by physicians—did not. Two 
possible consequences warrant consid-
eration: high diagnostic certainty cases 
were disproportionately represented 
or low diagnostic certainty cases were 
disproportionately represented. Given 
the observed, wide spectrum of pre-
CT diagnostic confidence, high post-CT 
survey completion rates, and high rate 
of physician participation across cen-
ters, related biases, if present, were 
unlikely to have substantially affected 
our results.
In conclusion, we found that, in 
the emergency department, physicians’ 
diagnoses, diagnostic confidence, and 
management are likely to change af-
ter CT. When considering the referral 
indications that we studied, our find-
ings suggest that, at present, broadly 
applied physician-targeted incentives 
to decrease the number of CT exami-
nations ordered should be viewed with 
caution, particularly when exercised 
without attention to the likelihood of CT 
benefits. Nevertheless, CT carries risks 
and costs, and efforts to safely elimi-
nate low-yield CT examinations should 
be an ongoing goal (21). It is important 
to recognize that our findings do not 
diagnosis, confidence, and decision 
making. Moreover, it is possible that 
if a specified level of diagnostic evalua-
tion and testing were required before 
ordering CT, the observed changes in 
key attributes of physician decision 
making would have been attenuated.
To avoid several of the mentioned 
biases, a randomized controlled trial 
design would have been necessary. Only 
patients in whom randomization away 
from CT was safe would have been eligi-
ble; such a design may have biased our 
results. Recently, CT and ultrasonogra-
phy were compared in a randomized 
controlled trial to evaluate their respec-
tive value for patients presenting to the 
emergency department who are sus-
pected of having urolithiasis; the single 
clinical indication addressed made this 
modes of administration would be 
identical. We did not incorporate a 
control group that did not undergo CT. 
Therefore, our results are suscepti-
ble to typical biases of observational 
studies. For example, we found that a 
relatively large proportion of patients 
returned to care during follow-up, 
which could reflect a high prevalence 
of chronically ill patients. Similar pa-
tients who did not undergo CT may 
have experienced the same changes 
in physician decision making during 
their emergency department stay, a 
circumstance that would confound our 
results. Before a CT request—and over 
the variable time periods in which CT 
scans were completed and post-CT sur-
veys were obtained—additional factors 
may have contributed to a physician’s

Figure 1: Graph shows relationship between pre-CT diagnostic confidence and likelihood of post-CT 
change in leading diagnosis. For all indications, likelihood of change in leading diagnosis was plotted accord-
ing to physicians’ pre-CT diagnostic confidence levels. For reference, corresponding numbers of patients 
are shown for each diagnostic confidence range. Pre-CT diagnostic uncertainty was prevalent and valid; a 
statistically significant inverse relationship between pre-CT diagnostic confidence and likelihood of a change 
in leading diagnosis was found (P , .0001 for all indications).

imply that current referral practices are 
optimized. Rather, we found substantial 
room for improvement—for example, 
there was no change in leading diagno-
sis in approximately three-fourths of pa-
tients who were referred to CT for the 
evaluation of headache. The challenge 
is to eliminate these referrals without 
affecting patients for whom CT could 
provide a benefit. Initiatives to address 
this problem are already under way 
and are principally centered on the use 
of decision-support tools (22–24). De-
velopment of such tools for CT referral 
represents a prudent approach to re-
ducing unnecessary CT examinations. 
In future research, we will leverage 
data from our study for this purpose, 
specifically integrating observed attrib-
utes of physician decision making with 
clinical data to develop strategies that 
are likely to be effective in real-world 
patient care settings.

significant (P , .0001 for all comparisons) and persisted when there was no change in leading diagnosis. 
Physicians’ diagnostic confidence was uniformly high after CT in both subgroups, across indications.
