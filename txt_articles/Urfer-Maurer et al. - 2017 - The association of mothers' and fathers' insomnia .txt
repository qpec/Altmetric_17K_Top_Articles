Abstract 
Objective: Sleep plays an essential role for children’s well-being. Because children’s sleep is 
associated with parental sleep patterns, it has to be considered in the family context. As a first aim of 
the present study, we test whether parental insomnia symptoms are related to children’s in-home 
sleep-electroencephalography (EEG). Second, we examine the association between parental insomnia 
symptoms and maternal and paternal perception of children’s sleep using actor-partner 
interdependence models. 
Methods: 191 healthy children enrolled in public school (96 were formerly very preterm born 
children) and aged 7 – 12 years took part in the study. Children underwent in-home sleep-EEG, and 
parents reported children’s sleep-related behavior by using the German version of the Children’s Sleep 
Habits Questionnaire. Further, parents completed the Insomnia Severity Index to report their own 
insomnia symptoms. 
Results: Maternal but not paternal insomnia symptoms were related to less children’s EEG-derived 
total sleep time, more stage 2 sleep, less slow wave sleep, later sleep onset time, and later awakening 
time. Mothers’ and fathers’ own insomnia symptoms were related to their reports of children’s 
bedtime resistance, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night wakings, and/or daytime sleepiness. Moreover, 
maternal insomnia symptoms were associated with paternal reports of children’s bedtime resistance, 
sleep anxiety, and sleep disordered breathing. The associations between parental insomnia symptoms 
and parents’ perception of children’s sleep could not be explained by children’s objectively measured 
sleep.  
Conclusions: Mothers’ insomnia symptoms and children’s objective sleep patterns are associated. 
Moreover, the parents’ own insomnia symptoms might bias their perception of children’s sleep-related 
behavior problems.

1. Introduction  
Sleep plays an essential role for children’s daytime functioning including their well-being, 
emotion regulation, cognitive functioning, and academic performance [1-4]. According to self- and 
parent reports sleep problems are frequent: 30%-40% of school-aged children seem to suffer from 
sleep disturbances such as difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, as well as excessive day-time 
sleepiness [5,6]. 
There is compelling evidence that children’s sleep is associated with parental sleep patterns 
[7-10], particularly with maternal sleep [8,9,11-14]. The association was especially salient when 
parents’ and children’s sleep were measured with the same method, e.g. when both parental and 
children’s sleep were reported by the parents [14] or measured with actigraphy [9] or sleep- 
electroencephalography (EEG) [8]. However, to date no study examined the association between 
parental insomnia symptoms and children’s sleep measured by polysomnography, the gold-standard of 
sleep assessment. Similarly, evidence on the association between one parent’s insomnia symptoms and 
the co-parent’s perception of child sleep is missing. 
Several possible mechanisms that could account for the relationship between parents’ and 
children’s sleep have been suggested. First, children may learn sleep habits from their parents, which 
could lead to high correspondence between parents’ and children’s sleep quality [15]. Second, both 
parents and children could for instance be affected by poor family functioning [16-19] as well as by 
environmental stress related to poor socio-economic status leading to poor sleep patterns [20]. Third, 
children may share genetic variation with their parents that predisposes for poor sleep [21]. Fourth, in 
younger children, sleep difficulties can also affect parental sleep [22,23].  
A methodological issue that could account for the association between parental insomnia and 
parent reports of children’s sleep difficulties in particular, is that parental insomnia may affect their 
perception of children’s sleep without any real underlying sleep problem of the child [24]. This can be 
important because parents are often the first to perceive their children’s sleep problems and to seek 
help. Aside from causing unnecessary costs, treatment for sleep disorders without a real underlying 
indication might be harmful and eventually even trigger children’s sleep disturbances [25,26]. This 
might happen in a similar fashion as described by Harvey’s cognitive model of insomnia [27] which 
posits that selective attention and monitoring of sleep difficulties play a crucial role in triggering and 
perpetuating sleep disturbances.  
Moreover, parent reports are often used to assess children’s sleep-related behavior and sleep 
problems in research, since parent reports are practical and inexpensive [28], although being error-
prone and possibly biased due to the parents’ own sleep difficulties [24,29]. Rönnlund et al. (2016) 
[24] for instance studied parents of children aged 2 to 6 years and measured children's sleep by 
actigraphy to identify to what degree parent reports were explained by children's actual sleep. Parents, 
who themselves suffered from poor sleep, more often reported sleep problems in their children, 
including disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep, disorders of sleep-wake transitions, and 
excessive daytime somnolence [24]. These associations could not be explained by objective (i.e. 
actigraphy) measures of children’s sleep [24]. A possible explanation for this pattern of results is that 
parents who sleep poorly themselves show a negativity bias, such that they show increased attention 
towards and more often remember negative stimuli related to their child's sleep [24,30,31]. 
As a first aim of the present study, we tested whether maternal and paternal insomnia 
symptoms were related to children’s sleep measured objectively with in-home sleep-EEG. Compared 
to laboratory-based polysomnography, in-home sleep-EEG assessment has the advantage that sleep is 
assessed in the ecological context where it normally occurs. We hypothesized that children show 
worse sleep patterns including shorter sleep duration and decreased sleep continuity when their 
mothers and fathers had increased insomnia symptoms. As a second aim of the present study we 
examined the association of parents’ insomnia symptoms and their perception of their children’s sleep. 
In order to account for the degree to which this relationship is explained by the children’s actual sleep, 
we controlled children’s objectively measured sleep (i.e., the EEG sleep-indices) in an additional step. 
We hypothesized that parents with more insomnia symptoms also perceive more sleep-related 
behavior problems in their children. Because the present study aims to extend our understanding of 
parental perception of children’s sleep, the interdependence of maternal and paternal reports of 
children’s sleep was examined using the Actor–Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) [32]. Maternal 
and paternal perception of their children’s sleep could be influenced by their own as well as by their 
partners’ sleep problems. The APIM approach allows to shed light into the mutual interdependence of 
  
3 
maternal and paternal perception of their children’s sleep by disentangling so-called actor and partner 
effects; in the present context, actor effects denote associations between one parent’s insomnia 
symptoms and his/her perception of the child’s sleep-related behavior problems (Figure 1, paths a), 
whereas partner effects reflect the associations between one parent’s insomnia symptoms and the other 
parent’s perception of the child’s sleep-related behavior problems (Figure 1, paths b).

2. Material and methods 
2.1. Study population and procedure 
The data for the present study derives from the second wave (May 2013 – September 2014) of 
the Basel Study of Preterm Children (BSPC). Recruitment procedures have been described elsewhere 
in detail (see e.g. Lemola et al., 2015 [33] and Perkinson-Gloor et al., 2015 [34] for reports on the first 
study wave and Maurer et al., 2016 [35] for a report on the second study wave). In total, the second 
wave of the study included 191 healthy school-aged children (age: M = 9.58 years, SD = 1.47; range: 
7.17 to 12.92 years; 109 (57.1%) were boys; see Table 1). Children underwent one night of in-home 
sleep-EEG, and parents completed the German version of the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire 
(CSHQ-DE; Schwerdtle & Hautzinger, 2010 [36]) to rate children’s sleep-related behavior and the 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; Morin, 1993 [37,38]) to rate their own insomnia symptoms. The total 
sample included 96 (50.3%) children born very preterm (<32 weeks of gestation) and 95 (49.7%) age 
and sex matched children born at term. Since children born very preterm and full-term differ in 
various sleep indices [34,35] the statistical analyses were controlled for preterm birth status. All 
children attended compulsory primary or secondary school in Switzerland. The study was approved by 
the Ethics Committee of Basel, assent was obtained from the children and written informed consent 
was obtained from the parents for each participant. 
Post hoc power analysis using G*Power was conducted to evaluate the statistical power given 
the sample size of the study [39]. Post hoc calculations regarding correlations revealed a power of .80 
to detect small to medium effect sizes (i.e., r = 0.20) at a 0.05 alpha level (two-sided; based on the 
total sample size). Therefore, the present study was deemed sufficiently powered to detect effect sizes 
of r = 0.20 [40].  
 
2.2. Sleep assessment 
Sleep was assessed using the Somté PSG (Compumedics, Singen, Germany), a portable sleep-
monitoring device during a single night on a regular school day at the children’s home. Sleep-EEG 
signals C3/A2 and C4/A1, right and left electrooculogram and bipolar submental electromyogram 
were obtained. The sleep-EEG reports were analyzed by two experienced raters according to standard 
procedures [41]. The following sleep indices were evaluated: Total sleep time (TST; time in bed 
minus time spent awake in hours). Sleep continuity: Sleep efficiency (SE; TST/time in bed × 100), 
sleep onset latency (SOL; min), and wake after sleep onset (WASO; the amount of time awake from 
the initial sleep onset to the last awakening; min). Sleep architecture (%): Stage 1 sleep, stage 2 sleep, 
slow wave sleep (SWS), rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, and REM latency (min). In addition sleep 
onset time and awakening time are reported. Sleep-EEG data were available for 146 children. 
To evaluate if there was a first night effect due to sleep-EEG assessment, children also 
reported whether they had a quiet night of sleep for the sleep-EEG night as well as for the following 
six nights. While for the sleep-EEG night 89.0% reported that they had a quiet night, this figure was 
on average 94.2% for the following six nights. 
 
2.3. Parent reports of children’s sleep-related behavior 
Parents completed the CSHQ-DE [36], a retrospective questionnaire to examine sleep-related 
behavior in children regarding a “typical” recent week. In most cases parents completed the 
questionnaire during the afternoon or early evening before sleep-EEG assessment was conducted. 
Items were answered on a three-point scale with the response options usually (5-7/week), sometimes 
(2-4/week), or rarely (0-1/week). Eight scales including one to eight items and reflecting the following 
sleep domains were calculated: Bedtime Resistance, Sleep Onset Delay, Sleep Duration problems, 
Sleep Anxiety, Night Wakings, Parasomnias, Sleep-Disordered Breathing, and Daytime Sleepiness. In 
addition an overall Sleep Disturbance Score was calculated. Higher scores indicate greater sleep-
  
4 
related behavior problems. Table 2 shows Cronbach's alpha for maternal and paternal reports of the 
CSHQ-DE scales, intraclass correlations (ICC) for maternal and paternal reports as an index of 
interrater agreement, and t-values for mean comparisons between maternal and paternal reports. 
Cronbach's alpha ranged from α = .41 to α = .72. Interrater agreements were fair to excellent for all 
scales and ranged from ICC = .54 to ICC = .88. On average, maternal reports of children’s Sleep 
Duration problems and Daytime Sleepiness were higher than paternal reports. For 185 children 
maternal reports and for 154 children paternal reports of sleep-related behavior were available. 
 
2.4. Assessment of parental insomnia symptoms 
Parents reported their current (i.e. last 2 weeks) insomnia symptoms on the German version of 
the ISI [37,38], a questionnaire consisting of 7 items, rated on a five-point Likert scale. A higher ISI 
score indicates greater insomnia severity. Table 2 also shows Cronbach's alpha, intraclass correlation 
(ICC), and t-value for the ISI scale. For 184 children the mothers’ reports and for 153 children the 
fathers’ reports of their own insomnia symptoms were available. For 142 children both maternal 
reports of insomnia symptoms and children’s sleep-EEG indices were available. For 123 children both 
paternal reports of insomnia symptoms and children’s sleep-EEG indices were available. 
 
2.5. Statistical analysis 
Multiple regression analyses were conducted with parental insomnia symptoms as 
independent variable and children sleep-EEG as dependent variable, to examine whether maternal and 
paternal insomnia symptoms are related to children’s sleep measured objectively with in-home sleep-
EEG (hypothesis 1). All analyses were controlled for children’s age, sex, and prematurity status if not 
stated otherwise. Multiple regression analyses were performed with IBM® SPSS® Statistics 22 (IBM 
Corporation, Armonk NY, USA) for Apple Mac® and standardized betas, adjusted t values, and 
adjusted p values (two-tailed) are reported. To test hypothesis 2, that is whether parents with more 
insomnia symptoms reported more sleep-related behavior problems in their children than parents with 
less insomnia symptoms, we computed APIMs with the lavaan package in R for each CSHQ-DE scale. 
APIMs were controlled for children’s age, sex, and prematurity status. Further, we calculated APIMs 
that were additionally controlled for sleep-EEG patterns (TST and SE) to examine the degree to which 
effects of parental insomnia can be explained by children’s actual sleep. For APIM analyses, 
unstandardized regression coefficients and adjusted p values are reported. By z-standardization of the 
scales before the analyses, interpretation of the unstandardized regression coefficients is facilitated. 
The APIM analyses were conducted with the full sample of 191 parental couples. Full-information 
maximum likelihood estimation was used to deal with missing values, which is considered a more 
reliable procedure compared to other more conventional methods [42].  
 
3. Results 
3.1. Descriptive statistics and preliminary analyses 
Table 1 shows descriptive statistics of background variables and children’s sleep-EEG indices, 
while Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for parent-reported children’s sleep-related behavior 
(CSHQ-DE scales), and parental insomnia symptoms (ISI scale).  
Child age was negatively related to EEG-derived TST (r = -.48, p < .001) and positively 
related to sleep onset time (r = .40, p < .001). Regarding maternal-reported sleep-related behavior, 
child age was negatively related to Bedtime Resistance (r = -.17, p = .019), Sleep Anxiety (r = -.21, p 
= .005), Night Wakings (r = -.17, p = .024), and Sleep Disturbance Score (r = -.16, p = .030). 
Regarding paternal-reported sleep-related behavior, child age was negatively related to Sleep Anxiety 
(r = -.18, p = .025) and positively related to Sleep Duration problems (r = .19, p = .021). Girls showed 
shorter EEG-derived REM latency (t(144) = 2.35, p = .020), earlier awakening time (t(144) = 3.06, p = 
.003), and more maternal and paternal reported Sleep Onset Delay than boys (t(183) = -2.14, p = .034; 
t (150) = -2.49, p = .014). Very preterm children showed earlier sleep onset times compared to term-
born children, while there were no further significant group differences regarding sleep-EEG indices 
(for a detailed report see Maurer et al., 2016 [35]). Mothers of very preterm born children reported less 
Sleep Duration problems (t(183) = 2.72, p = .007) and more Sleep Anxiety (t(183) = -2.95, p = .011) 
than mothers of full-term children. The remaining maternal-reported CSHQ-scales and paternal-
reported sleep-related behaviors did not differ between children born very preterm and full-term.

3.2. Associations of parental insomnia symptoms with children’s in-home sleep-EEG 
Table 3 shows the association between parental insomnia symptoms and children’s sleep-EEG 
indices. Increased maternal insomnia symptoms were associated with less children’s sleep-EEG TST 
(β = -.17, t = -2.20, p = .029), which is in line with our first hypothesis. There was no significant 
association between maternal insomnia and children’s sleep-EEG continuity (SE, SOL, WASO). 
Moreover, increased maternal insomnia symptoms were associated with more stage 2 sleep (β = .21, t 
= 2.50, p = .014), less SWS (β = -.17, t = -2.05, p = .043), later sleep onset time (β = .25, t = 3.34, p = 
.001), and later awakening time (β = .20, t = 2.44, p = .016) in children. No significant association 
between paternal insomnia symptoms and children’s sleep-EEG was found. 
 
(Insert Table 3 about here) 
 
3.3. Associations of parental insomnia symptoms with parental perception of children’s sleep-
related behavior (APIM-Analyses) 
Table 4 shows the association between parental insomnia symptoms and children’s sleep-
related behavior as reported by the parents. Significant actor and partner effects emerged. For mothers, 
their own insomnia levels predicted their perception of children’s Bedtime Resistance (b  = .28, p < 
.001), Sleep Anxiety (b  = .23, p = .001), Night Wakings (b  = .18, p = .015), and overall Sleep 
Disturbance Score (b  = .23, p = .001) (actor effects). Moreover, maternal insomnia symptoms were 
positively linked to paternal perception of children’s Bedtime Resistance (b  = .33, p < .001), Sleep 
Anxiety (b  = .21, p = .009), Sleep Disordered Breathing (b  = .19, p = .004), and overall Sleep 
Disturbance Score (b  = .19, p = .006) (partner effects). All these associations remained significant 
when controlling children’s sleep-EEG indices and were thus not explained by objective sleep 
measures. 
For fathers, insomnia symptoms were positively associated with their perception of children’s 
Sleep Duration problems (b  = .29, p < .001), Daytime Sleepiness (b  = .18, p = .021), and the overall 
Sleep Disturbance Score (b  = .17, p = .021) (actor effects). These associations also remained 
significant when controlling children’s sleep-EEG indices. However, paternal insomnia symptoms 
were unrelated to maternal perception of children’s sleep-related behavior (partner effects) in the first 
step of the analyses (i.e. not controlling children’s sleep-EEG indices). A significant association 
between paternal insomnia symptoms and mothers’ perception of children’s Daytime Sleepiness 
emerged only in the model that additionally controlled the children’s sleep-EEG indices (b = .17, p = 
.046).

4. Discussion 
This is the first study that reports associations between parental insomnia symptoms and 
children’s sleep with in-home sleep-EEG. Further, it analyzes for the first time actor and partner 
effects regarding the association between mothers’ and fathers’ insomnia symptoms and their 
perception of children’s sleep. The key findings were that maternal but not paternal insomnia was 
related to children’s EEG-derived sleep. Moreover, maternal insomnia symptoms were associated with 
both maternal and paternal reports of children’s bedtime resistance and sleep anxiety. Paternal 
insomnia was related to the father’s own reports of children’s sleep duration problems and daytime 
sleepiness. These associations were not explained by the children’s sleep-EEG indices. 
 
4.1. Associations of parental insomnia symptoms with children’s in-home sleep-EEG 
In accordance to our first hypothesis, maternal insomnia was related to children’s sleep 
duration measured by EEG. In addition, maternal insomnia was associated with children’s sleep-EEG 
architecture including more stage 2 sleep and less SWS and sleep timing including later sleep onset 
and awakening time. However, maternal insomnia was unrelated with children’s sleep continuity 
measured by sleep-EEG. Paternal insomnia and children’s sleep-EEG indices were unrelated. These 
findings are in line with prior studies reporting associations between maternal and children’s sleep 
patterns as measured both by sleep-EEG [8] or by actigraphy [9] but not between paternal and 
  
6 
children’s sleep patterns [9]. A possible explanation for a stronger association between maternal 
insomnia symptoms and children’s objective sleep patterns might be that mothers in Switzerland tend 
to spend more time with their children than fathers [43,44]. Maternal and children’s sleep may 
therefore also influence each other more strongly. 
 
4.2. Associations of parental insomnia symptoms with parental perception of children’s sleep-
related behavior 
Consistent with our second hypothesis and the results from Rönnlund et al. (2016) [24] we 
found that parents with more insomnia symptoms also reported more sleep-related behavior problems 
for their children. Mothers with higher levels of insomnia symptoms perceived more bedtime 
resistance, sleep anxiety, and night wakings in their children (maternal actor effects for CSHQ-DE 
scales). In addition to these actor effects, maternal insomnia problems were also associated with 
paternal perception of bedtime resistance, sleep anxiety, and sleep disordered breathing (partner 
effects). In turn, fathers with higher levels of insomnia symptoms perceived more sleep duration 
problems and daytime sleepiness (actor effects). However, paternal insomnia symptoms were not 
associated with maternal perception of children’s sleep duration problems and daytime sleepiness 
(partner effects). The only partner effect, which was between paternal insomnia symptoms and 
maternal perception of child’s daytime sleepiness, emerged after controlling children’s sleep-EEG. 
Possible explanations for the association of maternal insomnia with children’s bedtime 
resistance and sleep anxiety include interactions between children’s and parental sleep related 
behavior. Children’s sleep difficulties and subsequent behavior could prevent parents from a good 
night’s sleep or vice versa [10,11]. Further, it is possible that some of the families’ homes provided 
generally unfavorable sleep environments, e.g. due to environmental noise [20]. Moreover, shared 
genetic risk could account for vulnerabilities to sleep difficulties in parents and children [21]. A 
possible explanation for a greater number of partner effects related to maternal insomnia symptoms 
might again be that mothers spend more time with their children than fathers and that there might be 
more mutual influences [43,44]. On the other hand it is also possible that mothers report their 
perception of children’s sleep difficulties to their partners more often than vice versa. These reports, 
however, can already be influenced by maternal sleep problems.  
Interestingly, none of the above-mentioned associations between parental insomnia symptoms 
and children’s sleep-related behavior problems, as reported by the parents, could be explained by 
objective measures of children’s sleep. Therefore, one alternative explanation of the association 
between parental sleep difficulties and their reports of children’s sleep is over-reporting of children’s 
sleep problems – parents with insomnia symptoms may exhibit an attention bias towards negative 
sleep-related stimuli including their children’s sleep problems [30,31]. This interpretation is generally 
in line with a prior study reporting an association between poor parental sleep and parent ratings of 
their 2-6 year old children’s sleep controlling children’s objective sleep measured by actigraphs [24]. 
In opposition to this interpretation, however, it can be argued that one night of in-home sleep-EEG 
may not accurately represent children’s common sleep behavior. Nevertheless, a prior study using in-
home sleep-EEG in children showed relatively high stability across 18 months particularly regarding 
EEG-derived sleep duration and sleep architecture [45]. In sum, it is possible that parental insomnia 
leads to over-reporting regarding their children’s sleep problems. Moreover, it is possible that parental 
selective attention and monitoring of children’s sleep difficulties may in some cases even trigger 
children’s sleep disturbances in a similar fashion as described by Harvey’s cognitive model of 
insomnia [27]. From a clinical perspective it therefore appears important to carefully diagnose 
children’s sleep difficulties taking the family context into account. 
 
4.3. Strengths and Limitations 
The major strength of our study is that children’s sleep was measured by in-home sleep-EEG, 
which increases the ecological validity of sleep assessment compared to laboratory based PSG. In 
addition, information from both parents was available and actor and partner effects regarding the 
association between parental insomnia and parental perception of children’s sleep could be examined. 
However, the current study is not without limitations. First, in-home sleep-EEG was only 
conducted during one single night, which may decrease reliability compared to assessment across 
multiple nights. Relatedly, there was no EEG-adaptation night and therefore it is not possible to rule 
out first-night effects. By contrast, parents referred to a longer period of time when rating their 
  
7 
children’s sleep (i.e., 1 week) and their own insomnia symptoms (i.e., 2 weeks). Second, the study 
sample included very preterm children and age and sex matched controls, therefore, the findings may 
not necessarily apply to the general population. Third, parental insomnia symptoms were assessed 
with self-report questionnaires, which do not necessarily reflect clinically relevant insomnia. 
 
5. Conclusions 
The present study implies that it is important to consider children’s sleep in the family context. 
In particular, maternal insomnia appears to be associated to children’s objectively measured sleep 
duration, sleep architecture (stage 2 sleep and SWS), and sleep onset and awakening time. These 
associations may reflect a mutual interdependence between maternal and children’s sleep. Parental 
insomnia symptoms were also associated with parental perception of children’s sleep related behavior 
problems, in particular regarding bedtime resistance, sleep duration problems, sleep anxiety, night 
wakings, and daytime sleepiness. On the one hand, these associations may also be seen in the light of 
the mutual interdependence of parental and children’s sleep. On the other hand, these associations may 
at least partly reflect parental overrating of children’s sleep-related behavior problems due to a 
negativity bias in parents, who suffer from insomnia symptoms themselves, as the associations were 
not explained by objective measures of children’s sleep. Eventually, it is possible that selective 
attention and increased monitoring of children’s sleep alongside unindicated treatment attempts may 
even pose a risk for children’s sleep.

Note: Effects are unstandardized estimates. Due to the z-standardization of scales prior to analyses they 
may be interpreted similar to standardized β-regression coefficients. Estimates before the dash (/) are 
controlled for child’s age, sex, and prematurity status. Estimates after the dash (/) are additionally 
controlled for sleep-EEG patterns (total sleep time and sleep efficiency). Partner effects regarding 
maternal reports are the effects of paternal insomnia on the mothers’ perception of children’s sleep-
related behavior. Partner effects regarding paternal reports are the effects of maternal insomnia reports 
on fathers’ perception of children’s sleep-related behavior.
