ABSTRACT. Little is known about the fate of the crew of the Franklin expedition after they sailed from England in 1845. 
Scant physical evidence and limited Inuit testimony have fueled speculation that the crew had scurvy, had been poisoned 
by lead, or had botulism or tuberculosis. The Schwatka expedition (1878 – 80) documented that several Inuit families had 
observed sailors of the Franklin expedition dragging ship’s boats in Washington Bay on the southwest coast of King William 
Island, Nunavut, Canada. The Inuit reported that the men appeared thin and the mouths of some of them were hard, dry, and 
black. Many Franklin scholars believe from this description that the surviving crews were suffering from scurvy and possibly 
lead poisoning. Using a systematic review of the medical literature to assess the Inuit testimony, we reviewed 1718 citations. 
With this approach, we identified a new and plausible explanation for the wasting and oral conditions ascribed to some of the 
survivors. We believe that miliary tuberculosis resulting in adrenal insufficiency (or Addison’s disease) may have resulted in 
the oral and physical symptoms witnessed by the Inuit. Scurvy and lead exposure may have contributed to the pathogenesis 
of Addison’s disease, but the hypothesis is not wholly dependent on these conditions. The tuberculosis-Addison’s hypothesis 
results in a deeper understanding of one of the greatest mysteries of Arctic exploration.

RÉSUMÉ. Nous savons peu de choses sur le destin des membres d’équipage de l’expédition Franklin, partie de l’Angleterre en 
1845. Les preuves physiques insuffisantes et les témoignages restreints des Inuits ont alimenté des hypothèses selon lesquelles 
les membres de l’équipage auraient eu le scorbut, auraient été empoisonnés au plomb, ou encore, auraient été atteints de 
botulisme ou de tuberculose. Selon des documents de l’expédition Schwatka (1878-1880), plusieurs familles inuites auraient 
vu des marins de l’expédition Franklin en train de tirer des embarcations dans la baie de Washington, sur la côte sud-ouest de 
l’île King William, au Nunavut, Canada. Les Inuits auraient dit que les hommes étaient d’apparence maigre et que la bouche de 
certains était dure, sèche et noire. D’après cette description, de nombreux érudits spécialisés dans l’expédition Franklin en ont 
déduit que les membres d’équipage ayant survécu souffraient de scorbut, voire d’empoisonnement au plomb. Le dépouillement 
systématique de la documentation médicale visant à évaluer les témoignages des Inuits nous a permis de prendre connaissance 
de 1 718 citations. Grâce à cette démarche, nous avons découvert une nouvelle explication plausible au dépérissement et à 
l’état de la bouche attribués à certains survivants. Nous croyons que la tuberculose miliaire donnant lieu à une insuffisance 
surrénale (ou maladie d’Addison) pourrait avoir causé les symptômes buccaux et physiques décrits par les Inuits. Le scorbut et 
l’exposition au plomb pourraient avoir contribué à la pathogenèse de la maladie d’Addison, bien que l’hypothèse ne dépende 
pas entièrement de ces conditions. L’hypothèse de la tuberculose (maladie d’Addison) permet de mieux comprendre l’un des 
plus grands mystères de l’exploration de l’Arctique.

INTRODUCTION
In 1845 the British Admiralty sponsored what was hoped 
to be the final expedition to the Arctic to complete the 
transit and mapping of the remote northern coast of North 
America, an area commonly referred to as the “Northwest 
Passage.” The expedition, commanded by Sir John Franklin 
RN, consisted of two Royal Navy vessels: HMS Erebus 
and HMS Terror. The vessels left England on 19 May 1845 
and were captained by Captain Francis Rawdon Moira 
Crozier (Terror) and Commander James Fitzjames (Erebus) 
(Cyriax, 1939). In July 1845, the ships were observed by 
the whaling ship Prince of Wales near Lancaster Sound 
(Cyriax, 1939). 
Three years passed without any further contact, and 
by 1848 concern for the safety of the expedition prompted 
 26 • R.S. TAICHMAN et al.
R.S. TAICHMAN et al.
the Admiralty to sponsor a series of search-and-rescue 
expeditions. Concern that the Admiralty expeditions 
were moving too slowly or searching in the wrong areas 
also prompted private individuals to mount their own 
expeditions. All told, nearly 40 ships searched the Canadian 
Arctic looking for the Franklin expedition. The enormous 
interest was fueled by a desire to recover survivors or the 
papers of the expedition. In 1850, it was learned that the 
expedition had overwintered in 1845 – 46 at Beechey Island, 
where three sailors had died (Beattie et al., 1992). In 1854, 
Dr. John Rae of the Hudson’s Bay Company learned from 
Inuit testimony that the majority of the men had died of 
starvation along the shores of King William Island (KWI) 
and west of the Back River (formerly the Great Fish River; 
Fig. 1) (Rae, 1889). Rae also reported that members of 
the expedition had likely resorted to cannibalism during 
their struggle for survival (M’Clure and Rae, 1854). The 
possibility of cannibalism resulted in widespread shock 
and anger in Britain and fueled further interest in what had 
happened.
It was not until Captain Francis Leopold McClintock 
and members of the Fox Expedition (1857 – 59) reached 
the shores of KWI that definitive news about the fate 
of Franklin and his crew was ascertained. From a note 
recovered at Victory Point, it was learned that the ships 
had become trapped in the ice of Victoria Strait northwest 
FIG. 1. Map of King William Island, Nunavut, showing the Franklin expedition’s known and probable routes (red dashed line). Evidence also suggests that at 
least some of the crew attempted a return to the ships after an initial abandonment in 1848 (green dashed line).

of KWI in September 1846 (Fig. 1). An addendum to the 
record made in 1848 stated that Franklin had died in June 
1847. Most critically, the Victory Point note reported that on 
22 April 1848, the remaining 105 men of the original crew 
of 129 had deserted their ships. At Crozier’s Landing, just 
south of Victory Point (Fig. 1), the crews came ashore and 
began to make final preparations for an overland march to 
reach the Back River (M’Clintock, 1860). No other written 
document has been found that shines additional light on the 
ultimate fate of the expedition. 
As a result of the physical evidence and Inuit testimony, 
significant speculation has arisen as to what happened to 
the crew after they initially deserted their ships in April 
1848. One of the most tantalizing firsthand reports was 
documented by Schwatka during his expedition of 1878 
to 1880. Backed by the American Geographical Society, 
Lieutenant Fredrick G. Schwatka led a summer expedition 
to KWI to recover written records believed to have been 
previously overlooked. Schwatka learned that several Inuit 
families had encountered Franklin survivors on the ice 
(Schwatka, 1899; Woodman, 1991, 1995). The survivors 
were seen dragging several sledges laden with ship’s boats 
on the southwest coast of KWI in Washington Bay (Fig. 1; 
online Appendix 1: Fig. S1). In fact, as summarized by 
Woodman (1991), three different narratives exist describing 
the encounter, each describing a different number of 
survivors (5, 10, and ~ 40), as well as different events and 
possible dates of the encounter (Nourse and Hall, 1879; 
Gilder, 1881; Schwatka, 1899). It was reported that many 
of the men were thin, and that “some of their mouths 
were hard and dry and black” (Gilder, 1881:91; Schwatka, 
1899:36). 
Many Franklin scholars believe from the description 
that the surviving crews were suffering from scurvy and 
possibly lead poisoning (Nourse and Hall, 1879; Beesly, 
1881; Cyriax, 1939; Lamb, 1956; Kowal et al., 1989, 1991; 
Battersby, 2008). While scurvy and lead poisoning were 
likely contributors to the demise of the Franklin crew, the 
terms “hard and dry and black” are not pathognomonic 
for scurvy or lead poisoning. Therefore, to gain a deeper 
appreciation of what may have happened, we performed 
a systematic review of the medical literature to assess the 
oral conditions observed by the Inuit. From this analysis, we 
propose that in addition to scurvy or lead poisoning, miliary 
tuberculosis resulting in adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s 
disease) may also have been the etiology for the conditions 
described. We hope this assessment will shed light on what 
has become one of the greatest mysteries of exploration.
METHODS
Our searches were run in two stages. The first stage 
aimed to identify the possible etiology of black, hard, and 
dry mouth and involved searches in several databases and 
resources. We searched clinical point-of-care electronic 
resources Dynamed and UpToDate, as well as Google, 
to identify possible causes of that oral condition. We 
supplemented those searches with targeted PubMed 
and Embase searches to retrieve citations published in 
health sciences journals that refer to black, hard, and dry 
mouth, as well as all citations that referred to the Franklin 
expedition in the citation title or abstract. In total, once 
duplicates were removed in Endnote X6, these searches 
retrieved 490 unique citations. Screening these citations 
confirmed that lead, scurvy, dental caries, coffee or tea, 
and tobacco were possible causes and also showed four 
additional possibilities: starvation, botulism, tuberculosis, 
and Addison’s disease. 
The second phase involved two components. First, we 
used broad searches to create large pools of citations for 
each of the nine possible causes (lead, scurvy, dental caries, 
coffee/tea, tobacco, starvation, botulism, tuberculosis, and 
Addison’s disease) and then ran those against a set of all 
citations that refer to a black, hard, bleeding and dry oral 
condition. These searches were run in Ovid MEDLINE and 
Embase and resulted in an additional 1228 citations, which, 
when combined with the previous set of 490 citations, 
resulted in a total of 1718 unique citations. Preliminary 
searches were run during summer 2015. The formal, 
comprehensive searches were run during a three-month 
period (December 2015 to February 2016) and were limited 
to publications in English. All searches, with the exception 
of those targeting Franklin expedition studies, used both 
controlled terms and keywords (MeSH and EMTREE). 
See Table 1 and online Appendix 1: Table S1 for a complete 
breakdown of the result numbers for each search. The 
complete search strategies are available in online Appendix 
1: Table S2.
RESULTS
Inuit encounters with Franklin crews can be classified 
into three main types: (1) face-to-face encounters with the 
Franklin crews or survivors, (2) encounters with solitary 
bodies or encampments with bodies, or (3) the discovery of 
relics or evidence of European activities (e.g., encampments, 
footprints) (Woodman, 1991, 1995). Direct encounters resulted 
in several references in the literature to the oral condition of 
the retreating Franklin crews. Schwatka related testimony 
of an Inuit woman named Ahlandnyuck who described the 
physical state of the survivors as “some of the men were very 
thin and worn out and their mouths were very dry, bleeding 
and black” (Schwatka and Stackpole, 1965:69 – 70). Others 
describe the condition as “dry and hard and black” (Gilder, 
1881:91; Schwatka, 1899:36). While these descriptions do 
not allow for an accurate diagnosis, the fact that they refer 
to multiple crew members rather than a single individual 
suggests that a similar ailment was afflicting several 
members of the crew. On the basis of systematic searches, we 
considered the following nine ailments to be the most likely 
causes of the dry, hard, black oral condition: (1) botulism, (2) 
dental caries, (3) lead (4) scurvy, (5) starvation (6) tobacco, 
 28 • R.S. TAICHMAN et al.

(7) tea staining, (8) tuberculosis, and (9) Addison’s disease 
(Table 2).
 
Botulism
Botulism, a potentially fatal illness caused by botulinum 
toxin, has been hypothesized as a cause of illness for 
members of the Franklin expedition resulting from 
poorly preserved canned foods provided to the expedition 
(Horowitz, 2003). Using our search criteria, we identified 14 
papers on botulism. The primary oral descriptors were dry 
mouth with or without difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), 
while intra- or extra-oral discolorations (e.g., “black”) or 
“hard” were not specifically mentioned.
 
Dental Caries
The dental caries experience in many Native 
populations, including the Inuit, prior to Western contact 
has been reported to be rare (Costa, 1980; Keenleyside, 
1998). Therefore, rampant and large, dark carious lesions 
would likely have been particularly noted by Inuit observers 
(Fig. 2B). We identified 685 papers on dental caries, of 
which three were relevant to our topic (Table 2). The first 
paper was a meta-analysis of a case-controlled population of 
individuals with severe mental illness in which significantly 
higher rates of decayed, missing, and filled teeth due to 
poor oral hygiene were identified (Kisely et al., 2015). 
The second paper reported that dementia is frequently 
associated with oral disease, including caries due to lack of 
oral hygiene, xerostomia, and periodontal disease, which 
can lead to pain and decreased oral intake (Foltyn, 2015). 
A third report focused on service personnel stationed in 
New Guinea during World War II experiencing a condition 
commonly known as “Jungle rot” (Bereston, 1942). 
Approximately 30% of the cases developed generalized 
violet maculopapular and nodular lesions. Nearly 5% of 
these cases demonstrated widespread extension of the 
pigmented areas. Together, these papers suggest that altered 
mental status or exposure to extreme environments may 
be associated with caries and “dry, hard, black” symptoms 
manifested in, or around, the oral cavity. 
Lead
The direct effects of lead on the oral cavity are well 
established. They include the discoloration of the gingiva, 
reductions in immune function and, progression of 
periodontal disease (Saraiva et al., 2007). Twenty-six 
reports were identified by the search strategy. The most 
pertinent report described chronic lead poisoning in 23 
children intermittently exposed to lead fumes. A lead 
line in the gums and black deposits in the necks of teeth 
were found in 13 children. No extraoral symptoms were 
described (Joshua et al., 1974).

Scurvy
Scurvy, caused by a lack of dietary vitamin C, results 
in poor healing of wounds, including wounds to bone, 
cartilage, blood vessels, and the skin. Frequently, oral 
symptoms precede the general manifestations of the disease 
and include gingival hemorrhage, swelling, soreness, 
and extensive gingivitis often with purple appearance, 
loosening of the teeth, and halitosis (Holland, 1936; Hodges 
et al., 1969; Fig. 2C, D). Given sufficient time untreated, the 
condition may progress to tooth exfoliation. Eight reports 
were identified in the search strategy (Table 2), but none 
were relevant to the condition of the Franklin crew. 
Starvation
Eating disorders (particularly regurgitation) and 
inadequate hygiene often affect the oral tissues. The 
systematic search focused on the terms “hard, dry, black” 
and “starvation” identified 19 new references (Table 2). 
None of these papers shed additional light on the oral 
symptoms observed for the Franklin crews. 
Tobacco
Tobacco, chewing tobacco, alcohol consumption, and 
poor oral hygiene are often linked to oral staining. Tobacco 
was among the items supplied to the discovery ships, and 
significant supplies were in the ship’s boat discovered 
by McClintock in Erebus Bay (M’Clintock, 1860). We 
identified 191 reports that met the search criteria for 
“dry, hard, black” and “tobacco” (Table 2). None of these 
reports specifically can be linked to the “dry, hard, black” 
descriptors even when dental calculus or tobacco staining 
was considered. Most germane to our investigation were 
two reports that described methods for assessing oral 
melanosis in different populations and a case study that 
described the condition known as black hairy tongue 
(Khasawneh et al., 2013). 
 
Tea 
Tea represented a major supply taken aboard the 
discovery vessels. Seventy-three references were identified 
by crossing the terms “tea” and “dry, hard, black.” The 
majority of these papers focused on physiologic processes 
activated by components of tea, or the staining of teeth or 
restorations (Table 2). Three papers focused on the erosive 
effects of tea on tooth structure or tea components as a 
cancer preventive, or were not relevant. 
Tuberculosis 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infections represent a 
serious communicable disease that is widespread and often 
presents with life-threatening consequences resulting from 
pulmonary failure. In the beginning of the 21st century, 
 30 • R.S. TAICHMAN et al.
R.S. TAICHMAN et al.
were not relevant since TB was evaluated but ruled out as 
a candidate for a reported condition (Table 2). Among the 
case reports, 20% mention oral or perioral discolorations 
as prominent features of the subjects. While dry mouth 
(xerostomia) was a prominent feature of all of the cases, 
17% describe swollen parotid glands associated with dry 
mouth. In the epidemiologic studies, extraoral lesions 
with dark discoloration features were reported, as well as 
mucosal lesions of the mouth and pharynx described as 
stippled or uniform dark red or bluish lesions, particularly 
of the gums (Kakisi et al., 2010). 
Addison’s Disease
Adrenal insufficiency or Addison’s disease occurs 
when the adrenal glands fail to produce sufficient levels 
of cortisol. Currently in the United States, autoimmune 
disorders affecting the endocrine system are the primary 
cause of Addison’s disease. Worldwide, tuberculosis 
remains the predominant cause of Addison’s disease and 
accounts for 10% to 15% of Addison’s disease cases in 
developed countries (Arlt and Allolio, 2003; Nieman, 2013). 
Surprisingly, in those case reports that described patients 
with oral or perioral discolorations, 38% report Addison’s 
disease as a feature (Fig. 2E, F). Further searches of “dry, 
hard, black” and “Addison’s disease” identified 19 papers, of 
which 17 were either review papers or excluded Addison’s 
disease as a diagnosis (Table 2). The two remaining 
references both described weakening, hyperpigmentation, 
and dry mouth associated with adrenal insufficiency.
DISCUSSION
The fate of the Franklin expedition has been shrouded 
in mystery. To gain further insight into what may have 
contributed to the demise of the surviving Franklin crews, 
we performed a systematic review of the medical literature 
focused on symptoms reported by Inuit observers. The 
Inuit testimony regarding the physical state of the crewmen 
comes from the narrative reports by Hall (Nourse and 
Hall, 1879) and Schwatka (1899) and from Gilder’s (1881) 
summary of the latter’s expedition. Each of these three 
narratives describes a different number of survivors (5, 
10, and ~ 40, respectively, as summarized by Woodman, 
1991). While it is likely that the exact number of individuals 
afflicted by the condition will never be known, the term 
“some of the men” suggests that a sufficient number of 
individuals were involved to attract notice. 
Many scholars of the Franklin Search believe that 
the poor physical and oral conditions of the surviving 
crew were due to scurvy. Indeed, Arctic mariners were 
susceptible to scurvy for lack of the Vitamin C provided 
by fresh fruit, vegetables, and fresh meat. Humans 
depend on the dietary intake of Vitamin C: we are unable 
to convert L-glucongamalactone to L-ascorbic acid, 
as other animals can do, because we lack the enzyme 
L-gulono-(gamma)-lactone oxidase (Kim et al., 2012). The 
most notable manifestation of scurvy results from poor 
healing of wounds, including wounds in bone, cartilage, 
blood vessels, and skin. Typical oral findings include 
loosening teeth and inflamed, pus-filled, and puffy gingiva 
that make eating painful. In addition, a foul odor (halitosis) 
is often used to describe the oral cavity of those suffering 
from scurvy. 
It is likely that some of the surviving members of the 
Franklin expedition were suffering from scurvy at the 
time of their encounter with Inuit in Washington Bay. The 
clinical signs of scurvy do loosely match the description 
of men whose “mouths were hard and dry and black.” 
However, a recent examination of 105 bones of the Franklin 
crew, representing at least four sites where the crew 
perished, noted few pathologic changes attributable to 
scurvy (Mays et al., 2015). Given the limited sample size, 
these findings might not be representative of the main body 
of the crew (Mays et al., 2015). Indeed, an earlier study of 
some of the crew’s remains did identify signs of scurvy 
(Beattie and Savelle, 1983), as did a recent evaluation 
of Royal Naval Arctic crews involved in the search for 
Franklin (Millar et al., 2016). These observations, while 
suggestive that scurvy may have had a role in the poor oral 
condition of the Franklin crews, do not rule out other causes 
worth investigating. 
Lead poisoning has also been proposed as a major 
factor in the demise of the Franklin expedition (Kowal 
et al., 1989, 1991; Keenleyside et al., 1996). Lead is a 
neurotoxin, resulting in cognitive and behavioral defects; 
confusion, muscle weakness, stumbling, aggressive 
behavior, irritability, fatigue, and memory loss are all signs 
of lead exposure. Two potential sources of lead may have 
contributed to the crew’s exposure; lead solder used to 
seal the canned food, or lead in the piping used to distill 
water to make it potable (Keenleyside et al., 1996; Brown 
and Margolis, 2012; Millar et al., 2015). Speculation that 
the men suffered from cognitive impairment has come 
from the fact that the Victory Point note, recovered by 
M’Clintock, suggests that Fitzjames recorded the wrong 
year that the expedition overwintered at Beechey Island. 
The gravestones at Beechey Island indicated that the 
expedition overwintered there in 1845 – 46, but Fitzjames 
recorded the overwintering dates as 1846 – 47. A second 
line of “evidence” suggesting that the crews were suffering 
from an altered mental state was M’Clintock’s observation 
of substantial stores of heavy and conceivably useless 
items at Crozier’s Landing and at the Boat Place in Erebus 
Bay (M’Clintock, 1860). Together, date confusion and 
heavy materials taken on the overland march have fueled 
conjecture that the crews were making poor decisions, 
although this point has been disputed (Woodman, 1991; 
Millar et al., 2016). More recently, attention was drawn 
to lead poisoning after autopsy and forensic analyses 
identified high lead levels in the tissues of the Franklin 
men (Kowal et al., 1989, 1991; Keenleyside et al., 1996; 
Battersby, 2008); however, since contemporary European 
 ORAL CONDITION OF FRANKLIN CREW • 31
control samples were not included in the analysis, it remains 
unclear whether the lead levels were unusual for the era. 
In addition to cognitive and behavioral effects, lead 
poisoning has significant effects on the oral cavity, bone, 
mucosal tissue metabolism, and the immune system. 
Using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (1988 – 94), Saraiva et al. (2007) 
analyzed 2500 men and 2399 women, ages 20 – 56, who 
had received complete periodontal examinations and 
found blood lead levels were associated with periodontitis 
for both men and women. Similarly, a study of workers 
chronically exposed to lead fumes and dust in a storage 
battery plant in Alexandria, Egypt (El-Said et al., 2008), 
demonstrated that exposed workers had increases in 
the prevalence of gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries. 
Experimentally, primates exposed to lead lost weight and 
developed profound anemia and thin, grey-blue lead lines 
visible along the gingival margins (Zook et al., 1976). 
Chronic lead exposure also resulted in the formation of 
chapping of the angles of the mouth (cheilitis), fissures, 
ulcers, and epithelial desquamation of the tongue, palate, 
and other parts of the oral mucous membranes (Zook et al., 
1976). Yet despite the clear linkages between lead and oral 
symptoms, our systematic review failed to identify lead 
exposure as a likely sole source of the symptoms recorded 
during the encounter of Inuit with Franklin crew members 
in Washington Bay.
Rampant dental caries was also investigated as a source 
of the Inuit testimony pertaining to “black” in the mouths. 
Cariogenic materials such as sugar, rum, and chocolate 
were among the expedition’s supplies, and McClintock 
found 40 pounds of chocolate in a ship’s boat discovered 
in Erebus Bay (M’Clintock, 1860). While black stains 
are frequently attributed to individuals with rampant 
caries and are characterized as dark lines or dark spots on 
the teeth (Fig. 2B), our literature review found that non-
developmental tooth discoloration, in particular black stains, 
are frequently associated with a lower caries experience, 
at least in children (Garan et al., 2012). Importantly, dental 
caries was an unusual feature in the indigenous populations 
prior to the introduction of processed foods, suggesting 
that Inuit observers would certainly have noted obvious 
black markings of dental decay (Costa, 1980; Keenleyside, 
1998). It is important to note, however, that carious 
lesions are not a prominent feature of the limited skeletal 
remains of the Franklin crews recovered in Erebus Bay (A. 
Keenleyside, pers. comm. 2015). Likewise, our search also 
did not identify dental caries or black stains as significant 
features worthy of further investigation. Similarly, botulism, 
starvation, tea, and tobacco use were also terms that arose 
as possible etiologies to describe thin sailors with mouths 
that are dry, hard, and black. Nevertheless, the possibility 
remains that these conditions may have contributed to what 
was observed. 
From our literature review, tuberculosis (TB) was 
identified as a possible etiology for the symptoms described 
by the Inuit. For multiple individuals to be suffering from a 
similar condition suggests an infectious disease as a prime 
etiologic candidate, although toxins and dietary deficiencies 
are also possibilities. At the time of the expedition, TB 
was a major cause of death in Europe, accounting for as 
many as one in seven deaths (Koch, 1882; Wilson, 2005). 
Indeed, shipborne outbreaks of respiratory diseases, 
including TB, were common in the 1840s and continue 
well into the present day (Bayliss, 2002; Davies and Yew, 
2003; Ono et al., 2003; Hansen et al., 2006; Ongre and 
Sommerfelt-Pettersen, 2008). The primary manifestations 
of a TB infection in the oral cavity have been reported as 
single, rather than multiple, ulcers (55%), with “indurated, 
ill-defined margins and a hard necrotic base (58%) or 
covered with greyish or yellow slough (42%)” (Kakisi et al., 
2010:105). In addition, pain while eating is a most common 
symptom. Difficulty speaking, burning sensations, reflux, 
halitosis, and intra-oral bleeding were also noted (Kakisi et 
al., 2010). While the Inuit reported that they had difficulty 
understanding the Franklin survivors, it is unclear whether 
they could have distinguished between a strong language 
barrier and a crew member’s pain-induced speech pattern. 
It is of significant interest that many of the reports identified 
by our search suggest that oral or perioral discolorations are 
prominent features of TB. Importantly, xerostomia or “dry 
mouth” was a feature of all of the cases, and 17% of the 
reports describe swollen parotid glands. Extraoral lesions 
with dark discoloration features were reported in the 
epidemiologic studies. Surprisingly, 38% of the cases report 
adrenal insufficiency, or Addison’s disease, as sequelae or 
as features of TB when oral or perioral discolorations were 
present. 
So what happened to the Franklin survivors? Infectious 
diseases, toxins, and dietary deficiencies are all possible 
ailments that could have affected multiple crew members. 
We believe that the most compelling evidence as to what 
happened can be gleaned first in the autopsies performed 
on the bodies buried at Beechey Island. Each of these men 
showed evidence of pulmonary TB, and in some cases 
miliary TB, the form of the disease that spreads to distant 
organs (Notman et al., 1987; Notman and Beattie, 1996). 
The adrenal glands are a major target of TB (Nieman, 2013). 
Thomas Addison first described this condition as bilateral 
adrenal destruction in 1855. In the 1800s, TB was the most 
common cause of Addison’s disease (Nieman, 2013). TB 
under conditions of vitamin C deficiency and elevated lead 
levels becomes more virulent and theoretically is more 
likely to spread from the pulmonary system (Troesken, 
2006; Taneja et al., 2010; Vilchèze et al., 2013). In addition 
to weakness and fatigue, hyperpigmentation and diffuse 
tanning of exposed surfaces are reported for Addison’s 
disease (Nieman, 2013). Black freckles of the face, 
forehead, and neck and bluish-black discolorations of the 
lips and mouth are noted at later stages of the disease and 
may reflect the Inuit observation of “black” (Mariette, 1975; 
Lamey et al., 1985; Kim, 1988; Erickson et al., 2000; Sarkar 
et al., 2012). Anorexia, nausea, and diarrhea also often 
occur, along with diminished cold tolerance (Nieman, 2013), 
 32 • R.S. TAICHMAN et al.
R.S. TAICHMAN et al.
as does dizziness and syncope, weight loss, dehydration 
due to alterations in sodium reabsorption and potassium 
excretion, and hypotension—all are characteristic of the 
terminal stages of Addison disease (Nieman, 2013). This 
combination of symptoms may have been described by the 
term “thin men” or the observation “dry.” Thus, some of 
these features are consistent with the symptoms ascribed to 
some of the Franklin crew and represent a plausible clinical 
course during a forced survival march (Fig. 3). 
Is there any evidence for the tuberculosis-Addison’s 
hypothesis? We know that three members of the Franklin 
crew buried in 1846 at Beechey Island had evidence of TB 
exposure (Notman et al., 1987; Notman and Beattie, 1996). 
The expedition then sailed towards KWI and at some later 
point became icebound. Hall (cited in Woodman, 1991:205) 
recorded a story related to him by the Inuit, which is often 
referred to as the “Black Men” story. These “Black Men” 
are suspected to have been coal stokers on board the ships 
and may have frightened the Inuit who visited the ships. 
During the “Black Men” visit, the Inuit met a high-ranking 
officer who pointed to a spot on the land where a large tent 
was pitched. The officer asked the Inuit if they saw the 
tent, whereupon the “Captain” told the Inuit that “Black” 
men lived there and no one must ever go there (Woodman, 
1991). Later, Captain Peter Bayne, an employee hired by 
Charles Hall during his search for the Franklin expedition, 
also reported Inuit testimony that the large tent was filled 
with many sick men (Burwash, 1931). We believe it is very 
possible that this tent represented a shore-based hospital 
intended to isolate and treat the TB consumptive crews 
in keeping with the fresh-air TB treatments of the time 
(Dormandy, 2000). There are, of course, other explanations 
for the tent story. Woodman (1991) suggested that the tent 
might have been the cache for the ships’ gunpowder supplies 
(these were routinely stored at a distance from Royal 
Naval ships for safety reasons) or that the tent could have 
been occupied by men who were practicing cannibalism. 
Whether the tent represented a cache of gunpowder, a 
collapse of discipline resulting in cannibalism, or a hospital 
for the TB-afflicted crew members cannot be known unless 
the tent site is identified and subjected to archaeological 
investigation or was recorded in an expedition record that 
has yet to be located. 
Other evidence for the tuberculosis-Addison’s hypothesis 
may come from the Victory Point note, which indicated 
that nine officers and 15 men had died by 1848 and that 
the surviving 105 of the original 129 men had abandoned 
their ships (M’Clintock, 1860). It has been surmised that a 
disproportionate number of officers versus crew had died. 
A correlation between age and rates of mortality due to TB 
has been observed in many settings, which suggests that the 
older officers would have been disproportionately affected 
(Frost, 1995; Woods and Shelton, 1997; Pérez-Guzmán 
et al., 1999), although the idea that the death rates of the 
officers and the non-officer ranks on Franklin’s ships had 
an unusual relationship has also been disputed (Millar et 
al., 2016).
Recently, Christensen et al. (2016) reported that John 
Hartnell, one of three Franklin expedition members 
buried on Beechey Island, was chronically zinc-
deficient. Zinc deficiency is well established as a cause 
of immunosuppression, which in combination with 
tuberculosis may have resulted in Addison’s disease 
(McMurray et al., 1990).  
Why did the crew abandon their ships, and why were the 
deaths of the officers disproportionate to those of the crew? 
Inuit testimony suggests that at least one of the ships was 
reboarded and sailed farther from where the ships were 
first abandoned, which indicates that at least one of the 
ships was structurally sound (Woodman, 1991). A plausible 
explanation for why a mariner would abandon a sound 
ship could be the presence of a contagious disease. While 
there are many compelling reasons why the Franklin crews 
may have abandoned their ships, we believe that a severe 
outbreak of TB may have led to the abandonment of the 
ships in April of 1848 and may explain why the death rate 
among the officers was higher than expected. 
Is there further evidence that a contagious disease was 
at least in part the reason why the crews abandoned their 
ships? At the time of the ships’ abandonment, the most 
direct place for the crew to come ashore while traveling in 
a southerly direction would have been Franklin Point. Yet 
the mariners detoured east to what has come to be known 
as Crozier’s Landing near Victory Point, bringing with 
them four heavy cast-iron ship’s stoves and kettles. They 
also abandoned a pile of clothing reported to be four feet 
high (M’Clintock, 1860). Additionally, part of an oar sawed 
longitudinally with a blanket nailed to its flat side was 
found, as well as a hollow brass curtain rod three quarters 
of an inch in diameter (M’Clintock, 1860). We hypothesize 
that the crews purposely came ashore near a large 
freshwater lake (Cooper’s Lake east of Crozier’s Landing) at 
Victory Point to bathe and abandon their infected clothing 
prior to beginning their trek towards Back’s Fish River. The 
oar, the blanket, and the iron curtain rod may have been 
used to construct a bath house, and the large kettles, to heat 
bathing water. 
The tuberculosis-Addison’s theory is not without its 
difficulties. Scurvy, a condition frequently associated with 
oral bleeding, was a common condition experienced by 
Arctic exploration crews during the 19th century (Millar 
et al., 2016). Perioral bleeding is frequently described as 
FIG. 3. Hypothesis model for the oral condition of the Franklin crew. Our 
model suggests that tuberculosis in conjunction with scurvy and lead 
poisoning resulted in miliary tuberculosis, leading to adrenal insufficiency 
or Addison’s disease. Addison’s disease symptoms include “dry and hard and 
black” mouths, stupor, dehydration, wasting, and fatigue. 
 ORAL CONDITION OF FRANKLIN CREW • 33
having “black” coloration, particularly when dried, and 
may also present as “hard.” Both Hall during his second 
expedition (1864 – 69; Nourse and Hall, 1879) and members 
of the Schwatka expedition (Gilder, 1881; Klutschak, 1881; 
Schwatka, 1899) reported interviews with Natives who 
had encountered Franklin expedition survivors (Table 3). 
Unfortunately, the authors have been unable to locate 
the original notes taken by either Schwatka or Gilder on 
their 1864 – 69 expedition. In 1965, however, Stackpole 
published what appears to have been an early draft of 
the Schwatka book, but in this case the oral conditions 
were stated to be “dry and bloody and black” (Schwatka 
and Stackpole, 1965:69 – 70; online Appendix 1: Fig. S2). 
The inclusion of the term “bloody” along with “black” in 
Schwatka’s description may represent the oral symptoms 
of scurvy. In fact, Nourse, Hall’s biographer, believed 
that the Franklin crews were suffering from scurvy, but 
makes no specific mention of the oral condition of the 
survivors except to describe a gold foil restoration in one 
of the skeletons recovered by Hall from KWI (similar to 
the gold restorations presented in Fig. 2A) (Nourse and 
Hall, 1879). Hall’s KWI traveling journal No. 38 (online 
Appendix 1: Fig. S3) and Nourse’s book describe gingival 
conditions consistent with scurvy among the bodies found 
at Starvation Cove (Nourse and Hall, 1879). 
Finally, another possibility that could result in a dry oral 
cavity but was not identified by our search is dehydration. 
Water supplies were notoriously limited on ships of this era 
and were likely contaminated with bacteria or by seawater. 
Further, while on land, or while dragging ship’s boats on 
the ice, potable water may also have been limited in supply, 
particularly if fresh water had to be made by melting ice 
when fuel was limited. If this were the case, one would 
wonder why only “some of the men” would have had the 
oral condition described, and why the Inuit would have 
specifically noted this condition, as surely they too had 
experienced dehydration. 
A limitation of our approach is the use of current 
medical databases to investigate diseases that occurred in 
the 1840s, when the pattern and severity of diseases were 
likely different from those seen today. For example, rates 
of TB, scurvy, and other conditions are known to have 
changed over time (Cook, 2004; Daniel, 2006). Similarly, 
tobacco use and oral hygiene methods have changed since 
the 1840s. Therefore, the relative absence of a condition 
in the current medical literature does not necessarily rule 
out an etiology for a condition described by the Inuit at that 
time. 
Sometime after leaving Crozier’s Landing, the retreating 
crews were observed by Inuit in Washington Bay. From 
that juncture, it is highly likely that significant mortality 
ensued. In an inlet on the mainland not far from King 
William Island, called “Starvation Cove,” the last of the 
party died (Woodman, 1991). The Inuit reported seeing 
significant stores of canned food that were “sweet and 
good,” yet the white men were very thin (Nourse and Hall, 
1879:606). Here, too, we believe that miliary TB targeting 
the adrenal gland may have been partially culpable. As 
described previously, the adrenal gland regulates sodium 
uptake in such a way that one can become dehydrated 
during adrenal insufficiency. And perhaps most critically, 
during the ensuing metabolic dysregulation, victims are 
unable to maintain weight in the face of plentiful food 
sources (Nieman, 2013). 
In conclusion, using a systematic review to critically 
assess the oral conditions of members of the crew of 
the Franklin expedition, we have identified a new and 
plausible explanation for the wasting and oral conditions 
of some of the crew members. Our hypothesis implicating 
a tuberculosis-Addison’s disease axis explains well the 
limited physical evidence and Inuit testimony as to what 
happened to the crew after they abandoned their ships in 
April 1848. The hypothesis accommodates the possibility 
that scurvy, an ascorbic acid deficiency, as well as lead 
poisoning, could have contributed to the pathogenesis 
of the disease, but it is not wholly dependent on these 
conditions, which have been in dispute (Kowal et al., 1991; 
Bayliss, 2002; Mays et al., 2015). Our work builds on prior 
investigations of the Franklin expedition, but also reveals 
a new and perhaps deeper understanding of the fate of 
Franklin and his crew.
