Abstract
No vaccine exists against group A Streptococcus (GAS), a leading cause of worldwide morbidity 
and mortality. A severe hurdle is the hypervariability of its major antigen, the M protein, with 
>200 different M types known. Neutralizing antibodies typically recognize M protein 
hypervariable regions (HVRs) and confer narrow protection. In stark contrast, human C4b-binding 
protein (C4BP), which is recruited to the GAS surface to block phagocytic killing, interacts with a 
remarkably large number of M protein HVRs (apparently ~90%). Such broad recognition is rare, 
and we discovered a unique mechanism for this through structure determination of four sequence-
diverse M proteins in complex with C4BP. The structures revealed a uniform and tolerant ‘reading 
head’ in C4BP, which detected conserved sequence patterns hidden within hypervariability. Our 
results open up possibilities for rational therapies targeting the M-C4BP interaction, and also 
inform a path towards vaccine design.

 acute invasive diseases (e.g., necrotizing fasciitis) and autoimmune sequelae (e.g., rheumatic 
heart disease)2. Currently, no vaccine against GAS exists3,4. A major impediment to 
immunization is the hypervariability of the antigenic M protein, a surface-anchored 
virulence factor5,6 that is also the target of neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies 
typically recognize the hypervariable region7,8,9 (HVR, N-terminal ~50 amino acids) of M 
proteins, which are dimeric α-helical coiled coils, and thus confer M type-specific 
immunity. One approach to overcoming hypervariability is to include multiple M protein 
HVRs in a vaccine, and indeed a vaccine candidate that includes 30 HVRs10 has advanced 
into early clinical testing. However, with >200 distinct M protein HVRs11 and the 
complexity of global GAS epidemiology1, even the most extensive multivalent vaccine is 
unlikely to offer universal protection. Here, we offer structural details that have implications 
for overcoming M protein hypervariability for vaccine design. This approach is based on the 
finding that human C4b-binding protein (C4BP) recognizes M protein HVRs with broad 
specificity12, in stark contrast to the narrow type-specificity displayed by antibodies. In one 
study, a remarkable ~90% of GAS strains of differing M types bound C4BP12. While this 
study examined binding to whole bacteria, no protein other than M protein (or an M-like 
protein, such as Protein H) has been described to bind C4BP, and no region other than the M 
protein HVR has been described to bind C4BP. C4BP13 is a negative regulator of the 
complement system that binds the complement protein C4b, and thereby disables the C3 
convertase of the classical and lectin pathways. GAS recruits C4BP to its surface, like a 
number of others pathogens14,15, to evade opsonophagocytic killing16,17.
Broad specificity in recognition is rare, having been observed only in a few cases. A 
prominent example is the interaction between major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
glycoproteins and peptides18,19. The breadth of this particular interaction is explained by 
MHC glycoproteins primarily making contact to the peptide main chain. To understand the 
basis for broad specificity in the case of M protein and C4BP, co-crystal structures of four M 
protein HVRs (M2, M22, M28, and M49) bound to the first two domains of the C4BP α 
chain were determined (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. S1, and Supplementary Table S1). 
C4BP consists of 7 α chains disulfide-bonded to a single β chain, with each of these chains 
being composed of multiple ~60-residue complement control protein (CCP) domains20. The 
first two CCP domains of the α chain (C4BPα1-2) are sufficient to bind M protein HVRs21 
and C4b21,22 (Fig. 1a). Overlapping but non-identical sites on C4BP are engaged by M 
protein HVRs and C4b22.
Results
Structural similarity
The structures of the four M protein HVR-C4BPα1-2 complexes (determined between 2.54–
3.02 Å resolution limits) were astonishingly similar, given the lack of sequence relationship 
among the M proteins (Supplementary Fig. S1). The M protein-C4BP interface was in well 
defined electron density and unambiguously modeled (Supplementary Fig. S2), whereas 
portions of C4BPα1-2 distal to the interface were ill defined, consistent with the inherent 
flexibility of these domains20. The M protein HVRs form parallel, dimeric α-helical coiled 
coils, with two C4BPα1-2 molecules bound to each M protein dimer, as prior reports

 suggested20,23 (Figs. 1b–c; detailed view of M2 shown later, and detailed views of M22, 
M28, and M49 are in Supplementary Figs. S3–S5). The portions of the M proteins that 
contact C4BPα1-2 are in canonical coiled-coil conformation, except for M2, which is 
underwound (Supplementary Fig. S6). C4BPα1 is proximal to the C-terminal portion of the 
M protein HVR and C4BPα2 to the N-terminal portion, in agreement with the approach of 
intact C4BP to the streptococcal surface (Fig 1a). The C4BPα1 and α2 domains are 
relatively unchanged from their unbound NMR structures20 (average RMSD ~1.5 and ~1.0 
Å for domains 1 and 2, respectively), except that domain 1 is rotated 180° with respect to 
domain 2 (Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8). This rotation is consistent with evidence from 
mutagenic22 and structural20 studies, and is discussed further below. The M-C4BP interface 
is extensive, with a total of ~1450–1690 Å2 of surface area being buried (in the 2:2 
complex). Most of this surface area is polar, and the fit is far from hand-in-glove (surface 
complementarities 0.56–0.66)24, except for M22 which has a better fit (0.72). These 
observations suggest a modest binding affinity, consistent with the 0.5 μM Kd20 for the 
interaction between C4BPα1-2 and the M4 HVR. A much tighter association of picomolar 
Kd25 results from avidity between C4BP, which has multiple, bundled arms26, and surface-
localized M protein.
Uniform ‘reading head’
Most significantly, the four structures revealed a uniform set of amino acids in C4BP that act 
as a ‘reading head’ for recognizing M protein HVRs. Most of this ‘reading head’ resides in 
C4BPα2 (Fig. 2a) and takes the form of a quadrilateral that is composed of: (1) a 
hydrophobic pocket that contains C4BP H67, I78, and L82; (2) a hydrogen bonding group in 
the form of the main chain nitrogen of C4BP H67; and two positively charged residues, 
C4BP (3) R64 and (4) R66. The segment that holds this quadrilateral is structurally 
invariant, being stabilized by a disulfide bond at C65 and limited in conformation by P68 
(not depicted). The M proteins supply amino acid side chains that interact with these C4BP 
residues to form complementary quadrilaterals (Fig. 2b). In all four M-C4BP structures, a 
hydrophobic M protein residue (usually an aromatic) fits into the (1) hydrophobic pocket, 
and a polar M protein residue immediately following in sequence hydrogen bonds to the (2) 
main chain nitrogen of H67. The contacts to C4BP (3) R64 and (4) R66 are predominantly 
electrostatic (usually salt bridges), but in the case of M49, a polar residue is absent and R64 
instead makes hydrophobic contacts, extending its alkyl chains across several M49 residues. 
These data are compatible with a report that substitution of C4BP residues R64, R66, or H67 
with Gln affects binding to M4 and M2222. Decreased affinity results in the case of R64Q 
and H67Q, but increased affinity occurs for R66Q (likely through a gain-of-function).
Uniform ‘reading head’ contacts from C4BPα1 were far fewer. The key C4BPα1 residue 
was R39, which formed electrostatic contacts through its guanidinium group as well as 
hydrophobic contacts through its alkyl chain, creating a ‘hydrophobic nook’ in conjunction 
with main chain atoms of C4BPα1 (Fig 2c). Thus, out of the six C4BP residues that form 
uniform contacts, three are arginines. This high proportion is likely significant, as the 
combination of polar and apolar atoms in Arg along with its chain length increase the 
possibilities for interactions with variable residues. Substitution of C4BP R39 with Gln 
results in decreased binding to M4 but increased binding to M2222 (again, likely a gain-of-

 function). All four M proteins have hydrophobic residues that insert into the C4BPα1 
‘hydrophobic nook’. M2 and M49 also have negatively charged residues that interact with 
C4BP R39, whereas neither M22 nor M28 do. The importance of C4BP R39 provided an 
explanation for the aforementioned 180° rotation of C4BPα1 (around a hinge at K63, 
Supplementary Fig. S7). In free C4BP, the C4BPα1 R39 nook and the C4BPα2 quadrilateral 
are on opposite sides, and require a 180° reorientation to interact simultaneously with M 
protein. This 180° rotation was seen in all four structures. However, in one of the two 
C4BPα1-2 molecules bound to M22, the 180° rotation was prevented due to a crystal 
contact (Supplementary Figs. S7c, d and S8). A similar 180° rotation appears necessary for 
the interaction of C4BP with C4b, as it has been demonstrated that R39 and the set of 
residues in C4BPα2 that interact with M protein HVRs also interact with C4b22. The 
purpose of requiring a 180° rotation in C4BPα1 to transition between free and bound forms 
is unclear.
Sequence conservation hidden within hypervariability
The evidence gathered from these structures proved powerful in bringing to light weak 
sequence conservation in M protein HVRs. Comparison of the heptad position of M protein 
residues that interacted with C4BP made it clear that there were two binding patterns 
observed in these structures, with chemically similar residues contacting C4BP (Fig. 3a): 
One for M2 and M49, and a separate one for M22 and M28. These two patterns were also 
evident in the way the coiled coils interacted with C4BP. In the case of M2 and M49, the 
coiled coils ran roughly parallel to C4BPα1-2, such that each C4BPα1-2 molecule contacted 
a single α-helix (Figs. 1b and 2b). But in the case of M22 and M28, the coiled coils lay 
crosswise across C4BPα1-2 such that each C4BPα1-2 molecule contacted both α-helices. 
Remarkably, these same two patterns were evident in a larger number of M proteins (Fig. 3b, 
and Supplementary Figs. S9, and S10), which had chemically similar amino acids to the 
ones in M2/M49 or M22/M28 that had been visualized to contact C4BP. We were able to 
assign 13 M proteins to the M2/M49 pattern and 32 (including the M-like Protein H) to the 
M22/M28 pattern. Thus, these two patterns may explain the interaction of nearly half of the 
M strains that were studied for C4BP binding12. A further 46 M proteins from this study12 
could not be assigned to either pattern (Supplementary Fig. S11). In these cases, it is 
possible that there are proteins besides M that recruit C4BP to the GAS surface or other 
regions of the M proteins that do. However since, for GAS, only M proteins and M protein 
HVRs have been documented to bind C4BP, we think it more likely that there are still other 
arrangements by which M protein HVRs interact with C4BP.
Tolerance to hypervariability
We next sought to understand tolerance in C4BP to sequence variation in M protein, as 
single amino acid changes have been shown to alter recognition by antibodies but not 
C4BP12. Alanine substitutions were created in the M2 residues mentioned above that make 
contact with the uniform ‘reading head’. In addition, substitutions were made in two M2 
residues, K65 and E83 (numbering of M proteins such that initiator Met is residue 1), which 
make contacts observed only in M2 (Fig. 4). The M2-C4BP interaction was evaluated by a 
Ni2+-NTA agarose coprecipitation assay using His-tagged C4BPα1-2 (Fig. 4a and 
Supplementary Fig. S12). Of the single-site substitutions, only F75A, which binds in the

 C4BPα1 nook, showed substantially decreased binding. Molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations of this mutation highlighted the importance of M2 F75, with contacts between 
the R39 ‘hydrophobic nook’ and M2 diminishing and waters infiltrating into this site upon 
alanine-substitution of F75 (Supplementary Fig. S13 and Supplementary Videos S1 and S2). 
Strikingly, all other residues could be mutated to Ala without substantial losses in binding 
(Supplementary Fig. S12), and indeed in two cases, increased binding was observed (see 
below). Providing verification for the structural observations, two double substitutions 
resulted in substantial loss of binding: D62A/E68A, which removed two of the polar 
contacts to the C4BPα2 quadrilateral, and E76A/D79A, which removed the two salt bridges 
to C4BPα1 R39.
Surprisingly, two of the single-site mutations, M2 K65A and N66A, increased binding, as 
did the K65A/N66A double mutant (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. S12). The structure of 
M2 (K65A/N66A) in complex with C4BPα1-2 was determined to 2.29 Å resolution limit, 
and no re-ordering of the binding site was evident (RMSD 0.15 Å) (Supplementary Fig. 
S14). This result suggested that M2 K65 and N66 were tolerated in the binding site but not 
optimal. While M2 K65 formed a hydrogen bond to the main chain oxygen of C4BP R64, it 
was sandwiched between two positively charged side chains (i.e., C4BP R64 and R66), 
providing an explanation for why Ala substitution of K65 led to enhanced binding. MD 
simulations reinforced this interpretation, as Ala substitution of K65 led to better contacts 
between M2 and C4BP, especially evident in the increased frequency of hydrogen bonding 
between C4BP R66 and M2 N66 (Supplementary Table S2). The simulations suggested that 
the hydrogen bond between these two residues was otherwise infrequent (Supplementary 
Videos S3 and S4, Supplementary Table S2), and indeed these two residues had the highest 
B-factors in the binding site (Supplementary Fig. S15). In other M proteins belonging to the 
M2/M49 pattern, the equivalent of N66 is almost always Asp or Glu (Supplementary Fig. 
S9). Consistent with this trend, substitution of M2 N66 with Asp resulted in increased 
binding (Fig. 4a), and MD simulations provided evidence of the favorable interactions 
between C4BP R66 and negatively charged M protein amino acids (Supplementary Video S5 
and Supplementary Table S3). Puzzlingly, substitution of M2 N66 with Ala (and thus loss of 
hydrogen bonding to C4BP R66) also resulted in better binding. It is worth noting that C4BP 
R66 had an even higher relative B-factor when contacting M2 (K65A/N66A) as compared to 
wild-type M2 (Supplementary Fig. S15). Thus, it appears that C4BP R66 prefers a salt 
bridge (e.g., N66D) or no interaction (e.g., N66A) to a hydrogen bond, because the salt 
bridge provides sufficient binding energy to relieve the entropic cost of ordering the Arg, 
whereas the hydrogen bond does not. In short, the mutagenesis experiments reinforced the 
notion that the ‘reading head’ in C4BP is highly tolerant to variation in the M protein.
Discussion
We have shown that broad recognition between M proteins and C4BP is not due to contacts 
to the main chain, as it is for MHC-peptide complexes. Instead, the breadth of recognition in 
M-C4BP complexes is explained by three unique attributes. First, the C4BP binding site is 
tolerant, due notably to the prevalence of arginines. The combination of a charged head and 
a long alkyl body enables arginine to engage in both electrostatic and hydrophobic 
interactions. As a result, only loose restrictions apply to M protein side chains that interact

 with C4BP arginines. For example, whereas negatively charged M protein side chains were 
preferred for the C4BPα2 quadrilateral arginines, a set of hydrophobic residues were 
accommodated in M49; and for C4BPα1 R39, hydrophobic M protein side chains were the 
commonality. Second, there appears to be no ‘hot spot’ for interaction and instead the 
binding energy appears to be dispersed broadly over the interaction site. No single amino 
acid substitution in M2, except for one, reduced binding to C4BP substantially. A similar 
observation has been made for M2212. Alanine substitution of M22 E65 (E24 in Persson et 
al.), which we found interacts with C4BP R64, did not change binding to C4BP but did alter 
recognition by antibodies12. Third, the M protein coiled coil can align with C4BP in 
multiple ways. This enables M protein side chains that interact with C4BP to reside at 
different positions of the heptad repeat. Two different arrangements were seen here, but there 
are likely more to be discovered.
C4BP is recruited by a large number of pathogens (including viruses and fungi), in order to 
prevent phagocytic uptake, formation of the membrane attack complex, and generation of 
immunostimulatory anaphylatoxins (e.g., C3a and C5a)13. The importance of C4BP 
recruitment to GAS infection was demonstrated in an M22 strain. Specific loss of C4BP 
binding in this strain was effected through a seven residue deletion in M22, which our results 
indicate eliminated interaction with C4BP R64 and R66. This C4BP binding-deficient M22 
strain was ~3- to 13-fold more susceptible to elimination by human blood as compared to 
the wild-type M22 strain16,27. Further evidence for the importance of C4BP recruitment was 
recently garnered using transgenic mice expressing human C4BP17 (murine C4BP does not 
bind M protein21). In particular, human C4BP transgenic mice showed a much earlier time 
to death as compared to nontransgenic mice when infected by a C4BP-binding GAS strain. 
This and other effects, including bacterial burden and levels of proinflammatory cytokines, 
were exacerbated when these mice also expressed human factor H, another soluble negative 
regulator of the complement system. Interestingly, factor H, which is composed of CCP 
domains like C4BP, also binds M protein HVRs28. While M protein HVRs generally bind 
either C4BP or factor H28, the GAS strain used in this study produced Protein H17, which 
binds both29. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first atomic-level understanding of 
the interaction between a negative regulator of the complement system and a microbial 
virulence factor, and open up possibilities for rational disruption of the M-C4BP interaction 
for therapeutic ends.
Lastly, our work has implications for vaccine design. Broadly neutralizing antibodies 
(bNAbs) have been identified for several highly antigenically variable microbial pathogens, 
including HIV and influenza virus30,31,32,33. These antibodies target invariant structural 
regions that are often hidden due to various factors, including glycosylation, as in the case of 
HIV, or steric occlusion, as in the case of both influenza and HIV. The hypervariability of M 
proteins has hindered the development of a GAS vaccine. Our work shows that hidden 
within M protein hypervariability are sequence patterns that are conserved and utilized for 
interaction with C4BP. This finding suggests it may be possible, using appropriate antigens, 
to elicit bNAbs against GAS, which would mimic the broad specificity of binding to M 
protein HVRs observed in C4BP. In this regard, it is notable that the 30-valent M protein 
vaccine displays some measure of crossreactivity to M types not included in the vaccine10. 
Indeed, 14 of the 30 M proteins in the vaccine belong to pattern 1 or 2, and crossreactivity

 was seen to 16 M proteins not in the vaccine belonging to pattern 1 or 2. Further work will 
be necessary to determine if and which other conserved patterns exist in the set of M 
proteins that are not readily assignable to either pattern 1 or 2 but still bind C4BP. An 
alternative notion is transplantation of the C4BP loops that form the uniform and tolerant 
‘reading head’ of C4BP to the antigen-combining site of an antibody. Such an antibody 
would be predicted to have broad specificity against M proteins, and would provide 
neutralization due to targeting of the M protein HVR. This passive form of immunity could 
be made active by screening for antigens that bind tightly to the antibody displaying the 
C4BP ‘reading head’.
A potential challenge in these approaches based on the mode of C4BP binding is that the 
antibodies obtained through such methods may also recognize C4b. However, differences in 
C4BP binding modes between M protein HVRs and C4b suggest that selectivity would be 
possible22. A second challenge may be escape from such antibodies through further M 
protein variation. However, M protein HVRs vary from strain to strain but are stable within 
the type34, suggesting that their overall sequence variation is limited by negative selection. 
Binding to C4BP appears to be a major evolutionary selective pressure for GAS17; thus, 
escape from such broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting M protein HVRs through further 
sequence variation may be limited by pressure to maintain C4BP interaction.
Materials and Methods
DNA manipulation
The coding sequences of mature M2 (amino acids 42–367), M22 (42–335), M28 (42–363), 
and M49 (42–359) proteins were cloned from GAS strains M2 (AP2), M22 (Sir22), M28 
(strain 4039-05), and M49 (NZ131), respectively, into a modified version of the pET28a 
vector (Novagen) modified such that it encoded an N-terminal His6-tag followed by a 
PreScission™ protease (GE Healthcare) cleavage site. Constructs that encoded truncated 
versions of these proteins, which consisted of only the N-terminal 79, 86 or 100 amino 
acids, were generated through the insertion of an amber stop codon at an appropriate site by 
site-directed mutagenesis. Site-specific mutations were also introduced into the M2 coding 
sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. All site-directed mutagenesis was performed 
according to the Agilent QuikChange™ manual, except that 50 μL reactions were set up for 
polymerase chain reactions (PCR) instead of 12.5 μL reactions.
The coding sequence of the CCP1-2 domains of human C4BPα chain (C4BPα1-2)20 (a kind 
gift from G. Lindahl) was cloned into the modified pET28a vector described above, and also 
into a pET28b vector that encoded a non-cleavable C-terminal His6-tag. The cleavable N-
terminal His6-tag version of C4BPα1-2 was used for crystallographic studies, and the non-
cleavable C-terminal His6-tagged version for co-precipitation binding studies. To obtain 
selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted protein to be used in phase determination, 
methionines were introduced in the coding sequence of C4BPα1-2 at amino acid positions 
29, 46, and/or 71 by site-directed mutagenesis.

 Protein Expression and Purification
M proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified as described5 with 
minor modifications to the procedure. Specifically, bacteria were lysed with a C-5 
Emulsiflex (Avestin Inc., Ottawa, Canada) and ion exchange chromatography was omitted, 
and in the case of purification of M2 (wild-type and variants), imidazole was not included in 
the lysis and wash buffers.
C4BPα1-2 was expressed in E. coli Rosetta 2 (Novagen) cells. The protein was purified and 
refolded as described23, except for the use of a C-5 Emulsiflex for lysis. Where needed, the 
N-terminal His6-tags of M proteins and C4BPα1-2 were removed by PreScission™ protease 
cleavage according to manufacturer’s instructions, and the cleaved protein was purified by 
reverse Ni2+-NTA chromatography. M proteins and C4BPα1-2 were lastly purified by size-
exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200) in a buffer composed of 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM 
Tris, pH 8.5. Proteins were then concentrated to ~20 mg/mL by ultrafiltration; protein 
concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using calculated molar extinction 
coefficients. Aliquots of concentrated protein were flash-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at 
−80 °C.
SeMet was incorporated into C4BPα1-2 (L29M/L46M), C4BPα1-2 (L29M/L71M), and 
C4BPα1-2 (L46M/L71M) using methionine pathway inhibition as described35. SeMet-
labeled C4BPα1-2 was purified as described above.
Crystallization and Data Collection
For preparation of complexes, M2 (amino acids 42–141), M2 (K65A/N66A) (42–141), M22 
(42–120), M28 (42–141), or M49 (42–127) protein was mixed with C4BPα1-2 (wild-type or 
SeMet-substituted mutant) at a 1:1 molar ratio (final concentration of complex ~5 mg/mL), 
and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 10 mM Tris, pH 8. The samples were then concentrated by 
ultrafiltration to ~20 mg/mL. Crystallization was performed by the hanging drop vapor-
diffusion method.
The M2-C4BPα1-2, M2 (K65A/N66A)-C4BPα1-2, and M28-C4BPα1-2 complexes and the 
SeMet-labeled M2-C4BPα1-2 (L29M/L46M) and M2-C4BPα1-2 (L46M/L71M) complexes 
were co-crystallized at 20°C by mixing 1 μL of complex with 1 μL of the reservoir solution, 
which was 1.5 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M Bis-Tris Propane, pH 7.0. These crystals were 
transferred to the reservoir solution supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol for 
cryopreservation, mounted in fiber loops, and flash-cooled in liquid N2. Crystals containing 
SeMet-labeled protein were treated similarly, except the reservoir solution was 
supplemented with freshly prepared 1 mM TCEP.
The M22-C4BPα1-2 complex was co-crystallized similarly, except the reservoir solution 
was 2 M (NH4)2SO4, 2% PEG 400, and HEPES pH 7.5. The SeMet-labeled M49-
C4BPα1-2 L29M/L46M complex was also co-crystallized similarly, except the reservoir 
solution was 1.6 M Na/K PO4, pH 6.9. These two co-crystals were transferred to their 
respective reservoir solutions supplemented with 20% glycerol before being flash-cooled in 
liquid N2.

24-ID-C, and for M2 (K65A/N66A)-C4BPα1-2 and M28-C4BPα1-2 at the Advanced 
Lightsource (ALS) beamline 8.2.1. Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) data 
were collected from SeMet-labeled M2-C4BPα1-2 (L29M/L46M) and M2-C4BPα1-2 
(L46M/L71M) at the APS beamline 19-ID, and from SeMet-labeled M49-C4BPα1-2 
(L29M/L46M) at the APS beamline 24-ID-E.
Diffraction data from crystals of M22-C4BPα1-2 and M49-C4BPα1-2 (L29M/L46M) were 
indexed, integrated, and scaled using XDS36, while HKL200037 was used for data from all 
other crystals.
Structure Determination and Refinement: M2-C4BPα1-2
For structure determination of M2-C4BPα1-2, Se sites were located from SAD data of 
SeMet-labeled M2-C4BPα1-2 (L29M/L46M) and M2-C4BPα1-2 (L46M/L71M), and 
phases calculated for each data set using Autosol (within Phenix38). The two sets of phases 
were combined using the Reflection File Editor program (within Phenix). From the 
combined phase set, four Se sites, three at substituted methionines and one at the native Met 
14, were identified per asymmetric unit, which contained one M2 α-helix and one 
C4BPα1-2 molecule.
Here and in all cases below, model building was carried out with Coot39 as guided by 
inspection of SAD-phased maps or σA-weighted 2mFo – DFc and mFo – DFc maps, and 
refinement was carried out with Refine (within Phenix) using default parameters. Between 
15 and 75 iterative cycles of building and refinement, with each refinement step consisting 
of 1–10 rounds, were performed in each case. In later stages of refinement, TLS 
parameterization was used in Refine. Individual B-factors were refined isotropically. Water 
molecules were added in the final stages of refinement using Phenix with default parameters 
(3σ peak height in σA-weighted mFo – DFc maps).
In order to model M2-C4BPα1-2 (L29M/L46M/L71M), the NMR structure of C4BPα1-2 
was manually fit into SAD-phased density, with the two domains of C4BPα1-2 being treated 
as individual rigid bodies. The M2 molecule was then built into density, with the register of 
the coiled coil being assigned from well defined density corresponding to large side chains 
(i.e., His 20, Phe 75, and His 85). The SeMet residues in the model were changed to 
leucines, and the model was then refined against the higher resolution (2.56 Å resolution 
limit) data collected from crystals of M2-C4BPα1-2. TLS parameterization involved the 
following groups: For M2, 53–57 and 58–86; for C4BPα1-2, 0–59 and 60–124. Continuous 
electron density was evident for the entire main chain of C4BPα1-2 and for residues 53–86 
of the M2 protein. Here and in all cases below, electron density was visible for side chains of 
M protein residues, except for some solvent-exposed, flexible residues (i.e. Lys, Arg, or Glu) 
distant from the interface with C4BPα1-2. Electron density was also visible for side chains 
of C4BPα1-2, except for some residues in long loops that were also distant from the 
interface with M protein. An exception to this was C4BP R66, for which electron density for 
the side chain was broken. Long loops of C4BPα1-2 also contained some residues whose φ,

 ψ angles were in the outlier region of the Ramachandran plot. For the M2 protein, the only 
residue in the Ramachandran outlier region was A58, which is the N-terminal residue of the 
M2 model.
The structure of M2 (K65A/N66A)-C4BPα1-2 was determined by difference Fourier 
synthesis using the refined structure of M2-C4BPα1-2. The set of reflections used for Rfree 
calculations for the refinement of M2-C4BPα1-2 were maintained. TLS parameterization 
was equivalent to that for M2-C4BPα1-2.
Structure Determination and Refinement: M28-C4BPα1-2
The structure of M28-C4BPα1-2 was determined by molecular replacement using the 
program Phaser (within Phenix38). The C4BPα1-2 molecule from the structure of the M2-
C4BPα1-2 complex served as the search model. The molecular replacement solution had a 
log-likelihood gain score of 379. The asymmetric unit contained one C4BPα1-2 molecule 
and one M28 α-helix, whose register was determined by well defined density corresponding 
to large side chains (i.e. Tyr 62, Tyr 76, Tyr 77). The model was first subjected to cycles of 
rigid body refinement, followed by the refinement protocol described above. TLS 
parameterization involved the following groups: For M28, 55–83; for C4BPα1-2, 0–59, 60–
86, and 87–124. Continuous electron density was evident for the entire main chain of 
C4BPα1-2, except for breaks in some of its longer loops, and for amino acids 53–83 of 
M28.
Structure Determination and Refinement: M22-C4BPα1-2
The structure of the M22-C4BPα1-2 complex was determined by molecular replacement 
using the program Phaser. The search model consisted of an M28 α-helical, dimeric coiled-
coil in complex with a single C4BPα1-2 molecule. The solution, which had a log-likelihood 
gain score of 166, resulted in two copies of the search model in the asymmetric unit, while 
the solvent content suggested that the asymmetric unit was composed of two M22 α-helical, 
dimeric coiled-coils and four C4BPα1-2 molecules; this latter composition was found to be 
accurate. After refinement of the initial molecular replacement model, two additional 
C4BPα1-2 molecules became evident in electron density maps, and were placed stepwise 
into density, with the two domains of C4BPα1-2 being treated as individual rigid bodies, 
between rounds of iterative refinement. Both these additional copies had similar 
conformations to one another, and had a tilted orientation of the C4BPα1 and C4BPα2 
domains relative to these domains in unbound C4BPα1-2. This tilted orientation differs from 
the 180° rotation observed in the two other copies of C4BPα1-2 bound to M22, as well as in 
copies of C4BPα1-2 bound to M2, M28, and M49. Side chains for M22 were subsequently 
built into density, with the register being assigned based on well defined density 
corresponding to large side chains (i.e., Tyr 66 and Tyr 67). The model was then subjected to 
cycles of rigid body refinement followed by the refinement procedures described above. TLS 
parameterization involved the following groups: For M22 chain A, 52–80; for M22 chain C, 
52–79; for M22 chain E, 52–79; for M22 chain G, 52–80; for C4BPα1-2 chain B, 1–13, 14–
27, 28–59, 60–73, 74–86, 87–102, 103–109, 110–115, and 116–124; for C4BPα1-2 chain D, 
0–59 and 60–124; for C4BPα1-2 chain F, 1–59 and 60–124; for C4BPα1-2 chain H, 0–13, 
14–33, 34–47, 48–59, 60–74, 75–86, 87–109, and 110–124. Continuous electron density

 was evident for the entire main chain of C4BPα1-2, except for breaks in some of the longer 
loops, and for residues 52–79 (or 80, depending on the chain) of M22.
Structure Determination and Refinement: M49-C4BPα1-2
For structure determination of M49-C4BPα1-2, Se sites were located from SAD data 
collected for SeMet-labeled M49-C4BPα1-2 (L29M/L46M), and phases calculated using 
the program Autosol. Six Se sites were identified per asymmetric unit, which was found to 
contain an M49 α-helical, coiled-coil dimer and two C4BPα1-2 molecules. This is 
consistent with the total of two SeMet substitutions introduced into C4BPα1-2. The crystal 
structure of C4BPα1-2 from the M2-C4BPα1-2 co-crystal structure was manually fit into 
SAD-phased density, with the two domains of C4BPα1-2 being treated as individual rigid 
bodies. A model of the M49 protein was then built into density, with the amino acid register 
for the coiled coil being assigned based on well defined density corresponding to large side 
chains (i.e., His 20, Phe 75, and His 85). TLS parameterization involved the following 
groups: For M49 chain A, 56–60 and 61–126; for M49 chain C, 56–126; for C4BPα1-2 
chain B, 0–10, 11–62 and 63–124; for C4BPα1-2 chain D, 0–13, 14–27, 28–33, 34–44, 45–
53, 54–62, 63–73, 74–86, 87–102, and 103–124. Continuous electron density was evident 
for most of the main chain of C4BPα1-2, except for some of the longer loops of the 
C4BPα1 domain, and for amino acids 56–124 (or 126, depending on the chain) of M49. The 
M49 residue A106 of chain A had φ, ψ angles that were in the outlier region of the 
Ramachandran plot; this residue was distant from the interface with C4BPα1-2.
Validation of Structures
Structural models were validated with MolProbity40 (Supplementary Table S1). Molecular 
figures were made with PyMol (http://pymol.sourceforge.net).
Co-Precipitation Assays
Forty μg of C4BPα1-2-His6 protein was mixed with 120 μg of intact M2 protein (wild-type 
or mutant) in 50 μL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 30 min. Fifty μL of 
Ni2+-NTA agarose beads were equilibrated in PBS, then added to the protein mix in a 1:1 
beads:PBS (100 μL) slurry and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under agitation. The beads 
were washed three times with 0.5 mL of PBS supplemented with 15 mM imidazole, and 
eluted with 40 μL PBS supplemented with 500 mM imidazole. Proteins in the input and 
eluted fractions were resolved by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie-
staining. Gels were scanned and ImageJ41 was used to quantify band intensities. A total of 
four independent coprecipitation experiments were quantified, and band intensities were 
verified to be within the linear range of measurement. The intensity of the band from the 
lane containing no C4BPα1-2 was subtracted as background from other measurements. 
Values were normalized to the value of wild-type M2.
Molecular Dynamics: System Preparation
Heavy atom coordinates were taken from the co-crystal structures of M protein-C4BPα1-2 
complexes. Structures of complexes containing M2 substitution mutants were created by 
computational point mutations at the desired amino acid(s). Due to the varying resolutions of

 crystal structures, crystallographic waters were removed prior to solvating the system. Each 
structure was prepared for simulation using the Amber14SB force field42,43,44. The 
ionization states of titratable residues at pH 7 were predicted using PROPKA 3.145,46 and 
visually inspected to ensure the accuracy of assigned states. Free cysteine residues were 
converted to disulfide-bonded pairs manually and built using tLeap, a system preparation 
program from the Amber Tools 2015 package44. The C-termini of proteins were capped to 
remove charges. The solvent was modeled explicitly using the TIP4P water model47 and a 
0.15 M NaCl concentration was applied after neutralizing the overall charge of the protein 
complexes. The Particle Mesh Ewald electrostatic summation method48,49 was employed to 
evaluate electrostatics during simulation. In total, eight different M proteins in complex with 
C4BPα1-2 were simulated: 1) M2 (amino acids 53–86), 2) M2 K65A (53–86), 3) M2 N66D 
(53–86), 4) M2 N66A (53–86), 5) M2 K65A/N66A (53–86), 6) M2 F75A (53–86), M22 
(52–79), 8) M28 (55–80), and 9) M49 (56–126). All systems contained residues 1 to 124 of 
C4BPα.
Molecular Dynamics: Minimization, Equilibration, and Production Molecular Dynamics
The NAMD simulation package50,51 was used to minimize, heat, equilibrate, and simulate 
each system using a 2 fs time-step. Every system underwent a series of separate 
minimization, heating, and equilibration stages in preparation for production runs. The 
minimization spanned five stages in 10 ps intervals using the NVT ensemble: 1) 5,000 steps 
of hydrogen-only minimization, 2) 5,000 steps of solvent minimization, 3) 5,000 steps of 
side-chain minimization, 4) 5,000 steps of protein-backbone minimization, and 5) 5,000 
steps of full-system minimization. Following minimization, the Langevin thermostat52,53 
was used to slowly heat the system to 310 K using the NVT ensemble over 250,000 steps 
(500 ps). The system was then subjected to three sequential equilibration stages using the 
NPT ensemble for 125,000 steps/stage (250 ps/stage). The pressure was set to 1 atm and 
maintained using the Beredensen barrostat54. In the first MD production run, atoms were 
assigned a random starting velocity, and sequential steps carried over the velocities from the 
previous step. Five replicates of each system were performed to enhance sampling of the 
conformational landscape55 and the total simulation time for each system was 25 ns/
replicate (40 ns/replicate for M2 F75A). Therefore, the total aggregate simulation time for 
each system was 125 ns (200 ns for M2 F75A).
Molecular Dynamics: Percent Occupancy (Footprinting) Analysis
The five replicates comprising each system (125 ns total for all systems except 200 ns total 
for M2 F75A) were combined using cpptraj56, a simulation processing software in the 
AmberTools package44. Trajectories were aligned against the first frame and an average 
structure was calculated using all atoms in the appropriate protein complex. The average 
conformation was used to realign the trajectories with respect to Cα atoms. The average 
conformation was then used to calculate the root mean squared fluctuation (Å) (RMSF) of 
individual residues in the protein complex. A single concatenated 125 ns (200 ns for M2 
F75A) trajectory consisting of the five replicates was written by cpptraj and used for the 
following analysis.

 Using VMD57, the radial distribution function (RDF) of pairwise interactions for a number 
of protein-protein contacts was calculated over the duration of the concatenated trajectory58. 
Distances in the RDF analysis were explicitly calculated for the following heavy atoms of 
residues: backbone nitrogen of histidine; Cβ of alanine and valine; Cγ of aspartate, leucine, 
and isoleucine; Cδ of glutamate; and Cζ of arginine. A 5 Å cutoff was applied to all 
pairwise interactions to include salt bridges and hydrogen bonds between hydrogen atoms 
and heavy atoms that were not explicitly analyzed. This was done to capture interactions 
between equivalent atoms, e.g. Oδ and Oδ’ of aspartate interacting with Hω and Hω’ of 
arginine.

 Figure 1. Structures of M-C4BP complexes
a. Schematic of C4BP (blue) bound to surface-associated M protein (black), highlighting the 
M HVR-C4BPα1-2 interaction.
b. C4BPα1-2 (cyan) in complex with the HVR of M2 (red), M49 (yellow), M22 (blue), and 
M28 (magenta). Terminal residues are numbered.
c. Superposition of M-C4BP complexes, based on the bound C4BPα1-2 molecule shown at 
right in cyan. M2 is red and its second bound C4BPα1-2 molecule green; M49 is yellow and 
its second bound C4BPα1-2 orange; M22 is blue and its second bound C4BPα1-2 is omitted 
(because a crystal contact restricts its orientation into an artifactual conformation); and M28 
is magenta and its second bound C4BPα1-2 pink.

 Figure 3. C4BP-binding modes of M proteins
a. Heptad registers of M2, M49, M22, and M28 HVRs (a and d residues in grey). M protein 
residues interacting with C4BPα1-2 residues are highlighted according to their 
corresponding C4BPα1-2 interaction.
b. Sequence alignment of M protein HVRs that belong to the M2/M49 group (top) or the 
M22/M28 group (bottom). Residues that contact or are predicted to contact C4BPα1-2 are 
in red. Residues observed or predicted to be at core d positions of the heptad register are 
highlighted in blue for visual reference. Protein H (PrtH) is an M-like protein expressed by 
certain M1 strains.

 Figure 4. M2-C4BP interaction
a. Association of His-tagged C4BPα1-2 with wild-type and mutant M2 HVR at 37 °C, as 
assessed by a Ni2+-NTA agarose coprecipitation assay and visualized by non-reducing, 
Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Only bound fractions are shown here. Input samples shown 
in Fig. S12. This gel is representative of four experimental replicates. Molecular mass 
markers were not run on these particular gels; their positions are based on measurements 
from equivalent gels.

 b. Quantification of the interaction between C4BPα1-2 and wild-type M2 or M2 mutants 
proteins. The values shown are averages of four experimental replicates, corrected for the 
level of background binding (i.e., no C4BPα1-2) and normalized to wild-type M2. Standard 
deviations are depicted.
c. Structure of M2 (gray ribbon representation with key side chains in bonds representation, 
in which carbons are yellow, oxygens red, and nitrogens blue) bound to C4BPα1-2 (cyan 
ribbon representation, with key side chains in bonds representation, in which carbons are 
cyan and nitrogens blue). Hydrogen bonds and salt bridges depicted by dashed magenta 
lines.
