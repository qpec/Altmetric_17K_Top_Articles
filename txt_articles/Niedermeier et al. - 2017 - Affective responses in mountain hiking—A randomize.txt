Abstract
Introduction
Affective responses during physical activity (PA) are important for engagement in PA pro-
grams and for adherence to a physically active lifestyle. Little is known about the affective
responses to PA bouts lasting longer than 45 minutes. Therefore, the aims of the present
study were to analyse acute effects on affective responses of a three-hour outdoor PA inter-
vention (mountain hiking) compared to a sedentary control situation and to an indoor tread-
mill condition.
Methods
Using a randomized crossover design, 42 healthy participants were randomly exposed to
three different conditions: outdoor mountain hiking, indoor treadmill walking, and sedentary
control situation (approximately three hours each). Measures included the Feeling Scale,
Felt Arousal Scale and a Mood Survey Scale. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to
analyse differences between the conditions.
Results
Compared to the control situation, the participants showed a significant increase in affective
valence (d = 1.21, p < .001), activation (d = 0.81, p = .004), elation (d = 1.07, p < .001), and
calmness (d = 0.84, p = .004), and a significant decrease in fatigue (d = -1.19, p < .001) and
anxiety (d = -.79, p < .001) after mountain hiking. Outdoor mountain hiking showed signifi-
cantly greater positive effects on affective valence, activation, and fatigue compared to
indoor treadmill walking.
Discussion
The results indicate that a three-hour PA intervention (mountain hiking) elicits higher positive
and lower negative affective responses compared to a sedentary control situation and to an

Introduction
Physical activity (PA) is believed to serve as a panacea for different diseases and may also pre-
vent premature mortality [1, 2]. Nevertheless, more than 70% of the European population
show insufficient health-enhancing physical activity rates [3]. Therefore, a large body of litera-
ture focused on the mechanisms behind increasing the rate of physically active people [4].
Among other strategies, there are efforts to increase inactive people’s motivation to start a PA
program [5–8] and already active people to maintain their PA behaviour [9, 10]. At both stages
of starting and maintaining a PA program, affective responses to PA seem to play an important
role. In accordance to Ekkekakis & Petruzzello [11], affective responses to PA are considered
as the products of the continuous interplay between “interoceptive cues about the physiologi-
cal condition of the body” and cognitions, “such as considerations related to self-efficacy, self-
presentational concerns, goals, or attributions” [11]. Basic dimensions of affect are used to
operationalize affective responses, e.g. affective valence and perceived activation. Affective
valence can be considered as the degree of pleasure (or displeasure) in a specific situation,
while perceived activation is used for the feeling of arousal (high or low) [12]. Several studies
have shown a positive relationship between positive affective responses during PA and future
PA [9, 13, 14]. This relationship may also exist when only a single bout of PA is investigated
[9]. Based on this knowledge, the relationship between affective responses and PA needs to be
addressed in a comprehensive and health-related dimension.
Many studies reported positive effects of PA on affective responses in people with various
health statuses [12, 15–18]. However, different effects on affective responses have been shown
depending on the intensity of PA [19, 20]. Ekkekakis [21] addressed this phenomenon in his
dual-mode theory. Although intensity is no doubt an important characteristic of PA, there are
further parameters to consider, e.g. PA duration. Studies on the effects of a single bout of PA
typically were undertaken with durations of 15 to 30 minutes [19]. Although some studies
compared different PA bouts up to 45 minutes and proposed a U-relationship between PA
duration and affective responses [22], little is known about the effects of PA with a longer
duration.
Mountain hiking, considered as walking in mountainous areas with altitude differences,
seems to be a form of PA with a longer duration. Despite the PA duration varies a lot among
mountain hikers, tours with a mean duration of two to three hours were reported previously
[23, 24]. Therefore, mountain hiking can be considered as an appropriate example to study
effects of longer-lasting physical activity interventions.
Studying the effects of mountain hiking on affective responses may also offer new insights
in environmental aspects of PA. The importance of environmental effects on PA behaviour
has been recognized. Sallis & Cerin [25] emphasized the importance of the city design aiming
on the enhancement of physical activity. However, changing the environment for increasing
PA is a long-term project and it seems important to follow multidimensional approaches to

 change adherence to PA. Affective responses, and consequently adherence to PA, can also be
influenced by the surrounding environment. Indeed, PA in a natural environment (green
exercise) has been shown to create larger positive effects on affective responses compared to
indoor PA [26–30]. In their meta-analysis, Barton & Pretty [28] provided evidence for a dose-
response relationship between the duration of green exercise and the impact on affective
responses. According to the authors, the largest effect on affective responses (i.e., mood mea-
sured by the Profile of Mood State) was shown after 5 minutes of green exercise and the small-
est effect after half a day of green exercise. A limiting aspect is that those studies used a pre-
post measurement without control condition or control group. Furthermore, most of the
green exercise studies investigated a short bout of PA and we could not detect studies contain-
ing a longer duration of green exercise with a control group or control situation.
Therefore, the aims of the present study were (1) to analyse affective responses of a single
bout of long-duration PA (mountain hiking, approximately three hours) and (2) to detect pos-
sible green exercise effects in a randomized crossover trial using an outdoor PA-condition, an
indoor-PA-condition as well as a physically inactive condition of the same duration.
We hypothesized positive changes in affective responses due to a single bout of mountain
hiking. Concordant with the literature on green exercise, we further hypothesized that outdoor
mountain hiking will result in larger positive effects in affective responses compared to an
indoor PA intervention.
Materials and methods
Design
The project was designed as a randomized crossover study, in which all participants were
exposed to three experimental conditions in a randomized order: outdoor mountain hiking
(M), indoor treadmill walking (T) and sedentary control condition (C). Comparing M and C
enabled us to examine the intervention effect, while comparisons between M and T conditions
could illustrate potential green exercise effects. A crossover design was used to reduce error
variance associated with inter-individual differences and to increase statistical power. To con-
trol for psychosocial group effects, all assessments were done in groups (mean group size: five
participants). The mean washout phase between the conditions was 1 week; however, due to
conflicting schedules, the washout phase varied from one to 14 days.
Three independent study waves were conducted to be able to organise all measurements
and participants. Wave one took place in May 2015, wave two in August 2015 and wave three
in September/October 2015. Recruitment started two weeks before each wave. The daytime of
the three study waves differed by one hour because to the sunset. Within one wave, all inter-
ventions were started at the same time of the day (2, 3, 4 p.m. respectively). All waves were con-
ducted at the same places in Innsbruck, Austria.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Department of Sport Sci-
ence of the University of Innsbruck (22.04.2015) and all participants signed a consent form
after obtaining written and spoken information about the study procedures. The study was
registered retrospectively, since a healthy, non-clinical population was included and since trial
registration was not considered as necessary for the interventions (walking) and measure-
ments (mainly questionnaires). The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this
intervention are registered.
Participants
The required sample size was based on an a priori power analysis with the following assump-
tions. The effect size was set to d = .54 based on previous studies [28, 30, 31]. Using G�Power

 3.1 [32], we calculated a total sample size of 38 participants to detect effects with a power of .80
in the conditions by time interaction in a three × two repeated measures ANOVA. Assuming a
dropout rate of 20%, the sample size was adjusted to 46 subjects.
The participants were recruited in two waves by public announcement on the web page of
the Austrian Alpine Association and by e-mail announcements at the University of Innsbruck.
A detailed flowchart of the participants is presented in Fig 1. From 156 interested participants,
14 did not meet the eligibility criteria. The exclusion criteria were: (1) pregnancy, (2) breast-
feeding, (3) chronic or acute diseases (already existing or diagnosed during the study), (4) age

 Readiness Questionnaire [33]. No incentive was provided for the participation in the study. In
total, 47 participants were randomized and 42 participants completed the study.
Procedure
All participants were randomly exposed to three experimental conditions using simple rando-
misation method by MN. 10 study blocks were needed to test all the participants. In each
block, there were three to eight participants (mean group size: five).
In the first condition, the participants were informed about the procedure of the conditions
and were asked to read and sign the consent form. To control for influences due to weather
and daily constitution, we included a baseline measurement of affective states. After the base-
line measurements (t1, compare measurements section) the first part of the intervention fol-
lowed and lasted for approximately 100 minutes (see interventions section). After 10 minutes
of rest (t3), the second part of the intervention lasted for approximately 70 minutes. At the end
of the intervention (t5), the same measurements of t1 were repeated; the participants were
instructed for the next condition and departed individually. The timeline remained the same
in each condition, compare Fig 2.

 Because affective responses can change within the PA condition [12], affective valence and
activation were assessed five times: at t1, t2, t3, t4, and t5, respectively. Categorical affective
responses were collected before (t1) and after the intervention (t5).
Measurements
All measurements were performed in the group in a sedentary position with paper and pencil
and supervised by MN. Four different sets of self-report questionnaires based on the Circum-
plex model [34] were used to assess affective responses, which can be operationalized by both a
dimensional and categorical approach [35]. A dimensional approach covers basic dimensions
of affect. Within the Circumplex model, two basic dimensions are used to operationalize affec-
tive responses, affective valence and perceived activation. Affective valence can be considered
as the degree of pleasure (or displeasure) in a specific situation, while perceived activation is
used for the feeling of arousal (high or low) [12].
Two single-item dimensional based scales to cover the two dimensions affective valence
and arousal and two multi-item scales to cover nine selected distinctive states.
The Feeling Scale (FS) was used to operationalize affective valence (pleasure) [36]. The
bipolar, single item scale consists of 11 answer possibilities ranging from “very good” (+5)
to “very bad” (-5) with a neutral answer possibility. The FS was exclusively designed for mea-
surements of affective responses during PA. Discriminant validity was reported for perceived
exertion including other development information [36]. Convergent validity was assessed pre-
viously and is ranging from r = .41 to .88 [37].
Felt Arousal Scale (FAS) was used to assess perceived activation (high or low), which is usu-
ally described as orthogonal to affective valence [38]. Also designed as a bipolar, single-item
scale, the FAS provides six response options ranging from “low arousal” (1) to “high arousal”
(6). No neutral answer possibility is allowed. Van Landuyt & Ekkekakis [37] reported conver-
gent validity with the arousal domain of the Self Assessment Manikin [39] or the Arousal Scale
of the Affect Grid [40] (r = .45 to .70). In PA psychology, the combination of FS and FAS was
used previously (e.g. [12]).
Because we were not only interested in dimensional changes, we also assessed distinct
affective states in a categorical approach with a Mood Survey Scale (MSS) [41] and the German
version of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [42], [43]. In the categorical approach, dis-
tinct affective states, e.g. anxiety, calmness, fatigue, or anger are distinguished. This approach
was necessary to be able to gather differentiated information about possible changes in specific
dimensions. The MSS is an adjective list of 40 items (“At this moment, I feel. . .”) with a five-
point Likert response mode (“not at all” to “very”). Eight subscales (activation, elation, con-
templation, calmness, fatigue, depression, anger, excitement) are calculated from five items
each. Each subscale is ranging from five (lowest value) to 25 (highest value). Psychometric
properties to convergent and divergent validity can be found in Abele-Brehm & Brehm [41].
Internal consistency ranges between Cronbach’s Alpha .70 and .88 [41]. The MSS can be com-
pared with the Profile of Mood State [44], but has the advantage of providing four positive sub-
scales instead of only one in the Profile of Mood State. The state subscale of the STAI was used
for the measurement of state anxiety. The minimum value was 20 (low anxiety), the maximum
value 80 (high anxiety). The German version of the STAI (state subscale) shows Cronbach’s
Alpha for internal consistency between .90 and .94 [43]. Convergent validity and other psycho-
metric values can be found in Laux & Glanzmann [43].
Finally, participants responded to the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) to assess the per-
ceived effort [45]. RPE was assessed on t1 with respect to the moment of assessment and on t3
and t5 retrospectively with respect to the corresponding intervention time. The RPE is ranging

 between six (“no exertion”) to 20 (“maximum exertion”). Validity information can be found at
Borg [45] and Noble & Robertson [46].
All intervention time, heart rate (HR) was recorded using a wireless heart rate transmitter
placed on a belt around the chest and a wristwatch (RS800CX, Polar Electro Oy, Finland).
Additionally, heart rate was determined for five minutes in a sedentary position at t1 and t5.
Average values of heart rate (t1, intervention time, t5) were used for the analysis.
Primary outcome parameters of the study were the affective states of FS and FAS, and the
subscales of MSS and STAI. Secondary outcomes were the RPE and the heart rate.
Interventions
Outdoor mountain hiking (M). The outdoor mountain hiking condition was situated in
a famous hiking area and started at the northern edge of Innsbruck with direct access to natural
environment. The baseline measurements (t1) were conducted outdoors sitting on a bench (900
m). Directly after the measurements, the first part of the intervention started: an uphill hiking
phase on single trails and forest roads in a sparse forest with view on the mountainous region
around Innsbruck for six km in around 1.5 hours together with the test leader. Regarding the
hiking intensity, the participants were instructed to choose a “brisk without overspending” pace
(average speed: four km/h). The goal after uphill hiking was a mountain hut at 1500 m, where
the participants responded to the RPE and rested for 10 minutes in a sedentary position (t3). In
the second part of the intervention, the participants were hiking downhill on the same track for
around 70 minutes back to the starting point to respond to the post-test (t5) with an average
speed of 5.2 km/h. The participants were mainly hiking in subgroups of two to three people.
Indoor treadmill walking (T). The indoor treadmill walking condition was situated in a
fitness centre in Innsbruck. After recording the baseline measurements (t1), all participants
were walking uphill on treadmills for the first part of the intervention. To ensure that all physi-
cal parameters were simultaneous to the outdoor mountain hiking condition, the distance, the
difference in height, the average inclination of the track, and the time needed for the outdoor
mountain hiking situation were measured in a pilot study. Consistent to that, the following set-
tings were adjusted on the treadmill in the uphill situation: inclination: 10%, time: 1.5 hours,
and speed: four km/h (resulting in 600 m difference in height). In accordance to possible dif-
ferences in outdoor speed, the participants were allowed to change the treadmill’s speed in a
small range (3.8 to 4.2 km/h) to adapt to the wording “brisk without overspending”. After
responding to RPE and resting for 10 minutes (t3), the second part of the intervention con-
tained 70 minutes of level walking on the same treadmills (5.2 km/h, six km). Unfortunately,
downhill walking was not possible on the treadmills used. To simulate the group situation of
the outdoor situation as good as possible, the treadmills were located side by side. After the
second part of the intervention, participants responded to the post-test (t5).
Sedentary control condition (C). The sedentary control situation was located in a quiet
room at the university with access to computers. The participants were allowed to use the com-
puters, to read, and to talk, but had to remain in a sedentary position. To control for possible
differences in affective response due to the daytime, the sedentary control condition contained
identical timing of the measurements as M and C. Sociodemographic data were collected for
five to 10 minutes in this condition using a web-based questionnaire.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v. 23 (IBM, New York, United States). Possi-
ble systematic differences at t1 were tested by separate analyses of variances (AVONAs) with
condition as within-factor (M—T—C).

 Categorical affective responses (activation, elation, contemplation, calmness, fatigue,
depression, anger, excitement) were analysed using three × two repeated measures ANOVAs
with condition (M—T—C) and time (t1—t5) as within-factors. We used simple contrasts with
outdoor mountain hiking as the reference condition to show significant interactions between
M vs. C and M vs. T, respectively. Dependant variables were the subscale values of the MSS
and STAI. We calculated Cohens d as an effect size [47]. Following the approach of Ensari &
Greenlee [48], we calculated the mean change from before (t1) to after M (t5) and subtracted
the mean change of C and T, respectively. The resulting difference was divided by the pooled
standard deviation at t1. Cohens d can be classified in small (.3), middle (.5) and large (.8). Pos-
itive d-values mark a larger increase after M compared to T/C, negative values mark a larger
decrease after M compared to T/C.
Concerning dimensional affective responses (affective valence and perceived activation),
we used three × five repeated measures ANOVAs with condition (M—T—C) and time (t1—
t2—t3—t4—t5) as within-factors. For the condition factor, we used simple contrasts as de-
scribed above. For the time factor, we contrasted t1 as the reference time point. Dependant
variables were the raw scores of FS and FAS. Since the level of physical activity might differ-
ently influence affective responses, all analyses were controlled for the covariate level of physi-
cal activity in an ANCOVA.
The level of significance was set at p < .05 (two-tailed). Bonferroni correction for multivari-
ate analyses resulted in critical p values of p < .006 for the categorical approach and p < .025
for the dimensional approach.
Only M and T were analysed for differences in the secondary parameters, since it was
expected that there will be differences between the physically active conditions and the seden-
tary condition. Possible differences between the conditions in perceived exertion were tested
by using two × three repeated measures ANOVAs with condition (M—T) and time (t1—
t3/intervention time—t5) as within-factors and with RPE and heart rate as the dependant
variable.
Whenever the assumption of sphericity was not met in the ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser
correction was applied. Unless otherwise stated, data was shown as mean (95% confidence
interval).
Results
Preliminary analysis
The demographic data of the 42 participants (48% female) can be found in Table 1. There were
no systematic differences between the conditions in any parameter at t1 (all p > .05). In all
conditions, no harmful event for the participants happened.

 Affective responses (dimensional)
Fig 3 shows the basic dimensions affective valence and perceived activation over all time points
in all three conditions. Affective valence showed a significant interaction, F(5,147) = 6.30, p <
.001, d = 1.21. In M vs. C, simple contrast calculation revealed significant interactions between
t1 and all other time points (t2, t3, t4, t5), which indicated a different increase of affective
valence between M and C from t1 to all other time points. In M vs. T, there were significant
interactions between t1and t2, t4, t5. No significant interaction was observed between t1 and
t3. Affective valence was rated with the highest values at t4 in condition M with the largest pos-
itive incline between t1 and t2. The largest decline in condition T was between t1 and t2.
There was no significant interaction in perceived activation, p > .025, d = .65, indicating a
similar change in perceived activation between the conditions.
The covariate level of physical activity was not significant in the ANCOVA, all p > .05, indi-
cating no significant influence of level of physical activity in our study.
Affective responses (categorical)
Table 2 shows the distinct states of the MSS subscale values and state anxiety (STAI) before
and after each condition with the significance value for the interaction and the effect size for
the contrasts. A significant interaction in activation, elation, calmness, fatigue, and anxiety was
present, F(2,82) > 5.84, p < .005, |d| > .79. After M, positive affective states were increased
and negative affective states were decreased. After C, the opposite effects of M were present in
the according states.
When M and T were contrasted, there was a significant interaction in activation and
fatigue. Activation increased after M and decreased after T, while fatigue decreased after M

 and increased after T. Besides activation and fatigue, other subscales showed the same changes
after T and M to a smaller extend.
The covariate level of physical activity was not significant in the ANCOVA, all p > .05, indi-
cating no significant influence of level of physical activity in our study.
Perceived exertion and heart rate
Mean RPE did not significantly differ between M and T across time points, p > .05, d = .17,
indicating a similar change of perceived exertion between the physically active conditions.
There was a significant condition by time interaction in heart rate, F(2,80) = 7.6, p = .001,
d = .59. Mean heart rate was differently changing between the conditions M and T. Repeated
contrasts revealed significant differences between t1 vs. intervention time and intervention
time vs. t5. During intervention time, mean HR was significantly higher in M compared to T,
see Table 3. When expressed in percentage of the age predicted maximum heart rate after the
formula of [49], mean HR in intervention time was 59 (57–63) % during condition M and 57
(54–59) % during condition T, respectively.

 hiking) using a randomized crossover trial. The major findings of this study were that (1) a sin-
gle bout of approximately three hours of outdoor PA (mountain hiking) can elicit significant
positive changes in affective valence (pleasure) during and immediately after the intervention
compared to a sedentary control situation. Immediately after PA, the positive affective states
activation, elation, and calmness were increased, while the negative affective states fatigue and
anxiety were decreased compared to the sedentary control situation. When comparing the
conditions outdoor mountain hiking and indoor treadmill walking, our data showed that (2)
green exercise resulted in a significantly larger increase of affective valence during and imme-
diately after the intervention. Immediately after PA, outdoor mountain hiking showed signifi-
cantly higher activation and significantly lower fatigue values compared to indoor treadmill
walking. No significant interactions were observed in depression, anger, and excitement.
Outdoor mountain hiking vs. sedentary control situation
Since this is the first study that seems to have observed the acute effects of a three-hour moun-
tain hiking intervention, the possibility of comparing the current results with those of other
studies is restricted. However, since mountain hiking is also a form of physical activity, the
study can be compared to other forms of physical activity. The positive effects of a three-hour
PA intervention in comparison to the sedentary control situation are similar to the reported
effects of physical activity on affective responses with shorter duration previously reported.
When compared to studies conducted in environments without altitude difference, not only
findings from randomized controlled trials [29, 31, 50], but also findings from meta-analyses
support the positive influence of physical activity on affective responses [28, 30, 51, 52]. When
effect sizes were compared, the results of the present study (|d| = .79 to 1.21) showed even
larger effect sizes than recently reported medium-sized effects by Barton & Pretty [28]: d =
.56 or by Mackay & Neill [31]: d = .47. This discrepancy can partly be explained by different
calculation methods. While Barton & Pretty [28] used the difference between pre- and post-
intervention values, the calculation of the effects size was based on the interaction between
intervention and control condition in the present study. Since the values for positive affect
decreased and the values for negative affect increased in the control condition, this calculation
method resulted in higher effect sizes in the present study. Furthermore, there were differences
in the form of activity: Different activities (e.g. walking, cycling, gardening) were summarized
in both the meta-analysis Barton & Pretty [28] and in the study of Mackay & Neill [31]. Finally,
the measurement methods were different. Barton & Pretty [28] used the Profile of Mood State
and Mackay & Neill [31] the State Trait Anxiety Inventory.

 When the results are compared to studies using identical scale for affective valence (FS) and
only walking as PA intervention, the effect sizes previously reported were lower (Ekkekakis &
Backhouse [12]: d = .50 and .79) compared to the present values (d = 1.21). This was surpris-
ing, since Barton & Pretty [28] and Woo & Kim [22] stated a U-shaped curve of for the rela-
tionship between affective responses and PA duration showing the largest effect for five-to-
10-minutes-bouts and the smallest for half-a-day bouts. Since PA intensity was comparable in
both studies (age-predicted maximum heart rate: 67% vs. 64%), it might be speculated that a
longer PA duration show larger effects on affective responses. However, the duration effect
might be compensated by two other factors: While the mean age in the present study was 32
years, the mean age in the study of Ekkekakis & Backhouse [12] was 68 and 56 years, respec-
tively. Barton & Pretty [28] reported a smaller effect size for older people, which could partly
explain the difference between the two studies. Additionally, since it is known that walking in
a pleasant surrounding can create larger effects on affective state [29], another reason for larger
effects of mountain hiking compared to walking might come from the greenness of the envi-
ronment and the view on the mountainous scenery, where the mountain hiking was located.
This hypothesis is supported by the findings of Mackay & Neill [31], who stated an inverse
relationship between the subjective greenness and the anxiety post PA.
We observed a discrepancy between perceived activation (dimensional approach), where
no significant interaction was found, and activation (categorical approach), where we found a
larger increase after mountain hiking compared to treadmill walking and sedentary control sit-
uation. An explanation might be found in differences in the meaning. Dimensional perceived
activation is not related to the dimension of affective valence [39], i.e. perceived activation is
measured with the absence of pleasure. In contrast to that, the items contributing to the cate-
gorical activation are positively connoted [41], i.e. with the presence of pleasure.
Outdoor mountain hiking vs. indoor treadmill walking
We were postulating changes in affective responses due to (1) the PA and due to (2) being out-
doors. Through the inclusion of the indoor treadmill walking situation we were able to show
different effects of outdoor mountain hiking and indoor treadmill walking. After outdoor
mountain hiking, the distinctive state activation was increased and fatigue was decreased with
a medium sized effect compared to indoor treadmill walking. These results correspond to the
findings of Pretty & Peacock [29] and of the meta-analysis of Thompson Coon & Boddy [30],
who stated “greater feelings of revitalization and positive engagement” after physical activity
outdoors. The authors concluded that a “natural environments may have beneficial effects on
well-being” [30], which was supported by the results of the present study. As mentioned above,
activation and fatigue of the MSS are tapping the energetic arousal dimension, which corre-
sponds to greater feelings of revitalization and positive engagement. These results can be
explained (1) by the mere exposure to nature, (2) by the effects of PA already mentioned, and
(3) by the interaction of these variables. For the former, the psychophysiological stress recovery
theory [53] states that the visual stimulus of nature itself elicits positive affective responses
[54]. However, besides the differences in activation and fatigue, there were no significant dif-
ferences between indoor treadmill walking and outdoor mountain hiking. Therefore, we con-
clude that the positive effects of PA on affective responses might be more important compared
to the effects of the environment.
Practical recommendations
From a public-health oriented perspective with increasing obesity rates [55], it is essential for
health professionals to recommend efficient and pleasant forms of physical activity. According
Affective responses in mountain hiking
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0177719
May 16, 2017
12 / 17
 to the hedonic theory [56], people choose and maintain forms of physical activity they enjoy.
Indeed, in a prospective study design, Williams & Dunsiger [14] reported that an increase of 1
point in the FS during physical activity would result in an increase of physical activity after six
months of 40 minutes per week. Since outdoor mountain hiking increased mean affective
valence from 2.6 to 4.0, mountain hiking can be recommended as a pleasant form of physical
activity. When the results of Williams & Dunsiger [14] are applied to the present results, the
amount of physical activity per week of the participants might be increased by around one
hour in the future.
Strengths and limitations
The following limitations have to be considered when interpreting the findings: Firstly, it was
not feasible to apply downhill walking in the indoor situation, which resulted in a slightly dif-
ferent form of physical activity during the second part of the intervention. It remains therefore
unknown if the differences between indoors and outdoors are only driven by the environment
or also by the way of walking.
Secondly, affective responses might be influenced by at least two confounding variables: the
level of social interaction and the intensity of PA. Although we provided a group setting in all
conditions, we did not control for social interaction between the participants what might have
affected the results. The heart rate during the intervention time in outdoor hiking was signifi-
cantly higher than during indoor walking. Since mean inclination during uphill walking, dura-
tion, and speed were controlled, this discrepancy may have occurred by different changes in
inclination in outdoor hiking, unequal surface and therefore a higher muscular activity in out-
door hiking or temperature differences between indoors and outdoors. According to the dual
mode theory [21], this could have resulted in different affective responses. However, the rating
of physical exertion was not significantly different.
Thirdly, we did not include a follow-up measurement. It is known that affective responses
can change also up to 15 minutes after the walking intervention [12]. Future studies should
consider a follow-up measurement.
Fourthly, we are aware about a possible selection bias in the present study. The participants
were recruited on a voluntary basis without any compensation despite the amount of around
12 hours of workload. Therefore, an affinity to (mountain) sports cannot be ruled out in the
participants of the present study, which could also explain the high amount of PA per week
and the high amount of mountain tours per year. As we consider the provision of compensa-
tion also as a risk for a selection bias, we decided to select on a voluntary basis.
Fifthly, the length of the washout phase was not the same in all subjects due to conflicting
schedules, which might have influenced the results. However, since there were no significant dif-
ferences in baseline measurements before the conditions, we consider this as a minor limitation.
However, there are several strengths in the study to be mentioned: Firstly, the outdoor
mountain hiking condition may be assumed to show high external validity because the applied
hiking destination is a very popular and frequently visited one in the local area. Further, the
applied outdoor hiking condition represents a typical duration, altitude difference and group
size for recreational PA. Secondly, with the usage of a randomized crossover design, we were
able to control for inter-individual variability by using the participants as their own controls.
Thirdly, we were able to control for daily fluctuations by applying pre- and post- measurements.
Conclusions
The findings of the present study indicate that an approximately three-hour PA intervention
(mountain hiking) elicits higher positive and lower negative affective responses compared to a

 sedentary control situation. Therefore, also PA interventions with a longer duration (approxi-
mately three hours) can be recommended to improve affective responses. Additionally, the
data suggest a synergetic effect of physical activity and being outdoors. These results provide
support both for the psychophysiological stress recovery theory and for the affective benefits of
green exercise. Thereby, similar previous findings of outdoor PA on state anxiety [31] and
mood [29] were confirmed. Future research may include follow-up measurements and physio-
logical assessments to verify the self-reported data.
