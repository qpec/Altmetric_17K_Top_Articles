Abstract: Contemporary information on the fraction of cancers that potentially
could be prevented is useful for priority setting in cancer prevention and control.
Herein, the authors estimate the proportion and number of invasive cancer cases
and deaths, overall (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) and for 26 cancer
types, in adults aged 30 years and older in the United States in 2014, that were
attributable to major, potentially modifiable exposures (cigarette smoking; sec-
ondhand smoke; excess body weight; alcohol intake; consumption of red and
processed meat; low consumption of fruits/vegetables, dietary fiber, and dietary
calcium; physical inactivity; ultraviolet radiation; and 6 cancer-associated infec-
tions). The numbers of cancer cases were obtained from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Cancer Institute; the numbers of
deaths were obtained from the CDC; risk factor prevalence estimates were
obtained from nationally representative surveys; and associated relative risks of
cancer were obtained from published, large-scale pooled analyses or meta-
analyses. In the United States in 2014, an estimated 42.0% of all incident cancers
(659,640 of 1570,975 cancers, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) and 45.1%
of cancer deaths (265,150 of 587,521 deaths) were attributable to evaluated risk
factors. Cigarette smoking accounted for the highest proportion of cancer cases
(19.0%; 298,970 cases) and deaths (28.8%; 169,180 deaths), followed by excess
body weight (7.8% and 6.5%, respectively) and alcohol intake (5.6% and 4.0%,
respectively). Lung cancer had the highest number of cancers (184,970 cases)
and deaths (132,960 deaths) attributable to evaluated risk factors, followed by
colorectal cancer (76,910 cases and 28,290 deaths). These results, however, may
underestimate the overall proportion of cancers attributable to modifiable factors,
because the impact of all established risk factors could not be quantified, and
many likely modifiable risk factors are not yet firmly established as causal. Never-
theless, these findings underscore the vast potential for reducing cancer morbid-
ity and mortality through broad and equitable implementation of known
preventive measures. CA Cancer J Clin 2018;68:31-54. V

Introduction
Much progress against cancer has been made in the United States over the past sev-
eral decades, as evidenced by the 25% decline in the cancer mortality rate since
1991.1 However, the cancer burden remains substantial, with more than 1.6 million
newly diagnosed cases and 600,000 deaths estimated to occur in 2017.1 The costs
associated with cancer morbidity and premature mortality are staggering, with
approximately $88 to $124 billion per year for direct medical costs alone.2,3
Many cancers are causally related to potentially modifiable risk factors,4,5 and
contemporary estimates of this proportion in a population (ie, the population-
attributable fraction [PAF]) are a valuable tool for setting priorities for cancer

 prevention and control. Several previous studies provided
estimates of PAFs in the United States, but they included a
limited number of risk factors or cancer types, used data
sources that may not be nationally representative, or are out-
dated.4-11 Herein, we estimate the PAF of cases and deaths
overall (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) and for 26
cancer types, in adults aged 30 years and older in 2014,
attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors using
nationally representative data on exposure prevalence and
cancer occurrence. These risk factors include cigarette
smoking; secondhand smoke (SHS); excess body weight;
alcohol intake; consumption of red and processed meat; low
consumption of fruits and vegetables, dietary fiber, and die-
tary calcium; physical inactivity; ultraviolet (UV) radiation
exposure; and infection with Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B
virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human herpes virus
type 8 (HHV8), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or
human papillomavirus (HPV).
Materials and Methods
Data Sources
Risk factors and cancer types
We used reports published by the International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC) and the World Cancer Research
Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/
AICR) to identify potentially modifiable risk factors with
sufficient12-17 or strong (either convincing or probable)18-29
evidence for causing cancer in humans and for which risk fac-
tor exposure and cancer outcome data were available (Table
1). When a risk factor was evaluated more than once, we pri-
oritized the more recent evaluation. A list of potentially mod-
ifiable risk factors that were not considered in this analysis is
provided in Supporting Information Table 1.
Cancer occurrence
Numbers of new invasive cancer cases in 2014 in the United
States by sex and age group (ages 30-79 years in 5-year
increments and 80 years and older) were obtained from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s)
National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the
National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) Surveillance, Epidemi-
ology, and End Results (SEER) program, which collectively
provided complete coverage of the US population in 2014.30
The corresponding numbers of cancer deaths were obtained
from the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics.31
Cancer cases from the NPCR/SEER were adjusted
for delays in reporting to central cancer registries, which
have been shown to occur in the most recent data years,
using composite, age-specific, delay adjustment factors
derived from the North American Association of Central
Cancer Registries (NAACCR) 2016 December submis-
sion (personal communication, Andy Lake [Information
Management Services Inc. on behalf of NAACCR] and
Eric Feuer [NCI]). The methodology for delay adjustment
is described elsewhere.32,33 Both cases and deaths were
accessed via the NCI’s SEER*Stat software program
(version 8.3.4; NCI, Bethesda, MD) and were classified
according to the International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology, third edition34 and the International Classification
of Diseases, 10th revision, respectively. Because of high levels
of misclassification and/or missing information on histo-
logic and anatomic subtypes for mortality data, we used the
corresponding proportions from incidence data to estimate
the number of deaths from esophageal squamous cell carci-
noma and adenocarcinoma, gastric cardia and noncardia
cancers, and colon cancer (excluding rectal cancer).
Prevalence of exposures
Exposure data used in this analysis were based on sex-
specific and age-specific (ages 30-79 years in 5-year incre-
ments and 80 years and older) prevalence estimates from
nationally representative surveys and were weighted to
account for the appropriate complex sample design using
SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina)
and SAS-callable SUDAAN (release 11.0.1; RTI Interna-
tional, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina). Exposure
definitions and data sources are summarized in Supporting
Information Table 2.
Data on cigarette smoking status (current, former, and
never) and alcohol intake (number of drinks per day) were
obtained from averaging results from the 2013 and 2014
National Health Interview Surveys to ensure more stable
subgroup estimates.35 The number of alcoholic drinks per
day was calculated for current drinkers only; former drinkers
and lifetime abstainers were combined for this analysis and
were considered to have consumed 0 drinks per day in the
year before the survey. Because alcohol intake is generally
highly underreported in surveys, we adjusted National
Health Interview Survey alcohol intake using per-capita
alcohol sales according to a method previously suggested by
Rey et al (see Supporting Information).36
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) data were used to calculate estimates for other
exposures. NHANES does not collect data on the same items
every survey cycle; therefore, we included data from the most
recent years available. Survey years were also combined to
provide stable subgroup estimates for SHS exposure (based
on serum cotinine levels; survey years 2007-2010); body mass
index (BMI), in kg/m2 (as an indicator of excess body weight;
survey years 2011-2014); red meat, processed meat, fruit, veg-
etable, and dietary fiber and calcium consumption (all in
grams per day, except calcium, which was in milligrams per
day; survey years 2007-2010); and physical activity (recrea-
tional activity in metabolic equivalent of task minutes per
week; survey years 2011-2014).37 We considered only

 recreational activity for the association between physical inac-
tivity and cancer, because guidelines generally pertain to rec-
reational activity, and most studies have investigated this type
of activity.38,39 SHS exposure was defined as having a serum
cotinine level of 0.05 ng/mL or greater among never-smokers
and former-smokers, according to definitions used for the
2014 US Surgeon General’s report.40,41 Anthropomorphic
measurements for BMI estimates were collected in person by
trained personnel. The NCI method42,43 was implemented to
estimate usual daily consumption of dietary factors using data
from the two 24-hour recalls of NHANES (see Supporting
Information).
Laboratory data from NHANES were used to calculate
prevalence estimates for infections with HBV and HIV
(survey years 2011-2014), HCV (survey years 2009-2012),
H. pylori (survey years 1999-2000), oral HPV (survey years

 2011-2014), and genital HPV (survey years 2013-2014).
Because HIV tests were done and swab samples for HPV
were only collected from younger age groups (younger than
60 years for HIV and vaginal and penile swabs; younger
than 70 years for oral swabs), combined HIV or HPV prev-
alence from the 2 oldest 5-year age groups with available
data were applied as the prevalence for older age groups
without data. Equivocal tests for infections were considered
as missing values, unless additional tests were performed
(eg, HCV-RNA after an anti-HCV test).
Relative risks
We used relative risks (RRs) from large-scale pooled analyses
or meta-analyses of studies in the United States when avail-
able. Otherwise, we used RRs from pooled or meta-analyses
of studies conducted in North America and/or Europe or,
tertiarily, from studies worldwide (see Supporting Informa-
tion Table 3). For nonsex-specific cancers (except breast), we
used the overall RRs for men and women. When multiple
risk estimates were available, we selected the RR adjusted for
the greatest number of confounders.
Statistical Analysis
We applied a simulation method44 in which numbers from
repeated draws were generated for all RRs, exposure levels,
and numbers of cancer cases and deaths, allowing for uncer-
tainty in the data. The simulation process was replicated
1000 times for each sex and age-group stratum. We used
numbers from repeated draws to calculate the proportion
and number of attributable cancer cases and deaths and their
95% confidence intervals. By using exposure prevalence (Pi)
at the exposure category i and the corresponding RR (RRi),
PAFs for categorical exposure variables for each stratum of
sex and age group were calculated using the following
approximate formula:
PAF5
X
PiðRRi21Þ
X
PiðRRi21Þ11
The number of cancer cases and deaths attributable to each
risk factor by sex was calculated by multiplying the number of
cancer cases or deaths in each sex and age group by the PAF
in that sex and age group, and summing the results over age.45
The above approximate formula was used for all associa-
tions, with a few exceptions. Similar to previous studies, we
attributed all cervical cancers to HPV infection and all Kaposi
sarcomas to HHV8 infection.10 Because of the lack of data
on anal HPV infection, we attributed 88% of anal cancers to
HPV10 before applying the simulation method. We esti-
mated PAFs for excess UV radiation-associated melanomas
using the difference between observed melanoma incidence
rates by sex and age group in the general population and the
rates in blacks during 2010 through 2014, as applied in
previous studies.46 Melanoma occurrence in blacks can be
considered a proxy for rates in people with minimal UV
exposure, because UV radiation (through sun exposure and
indoor tanning) is a much less important risk factor for mela-
noma among blacks compared with whites in the United
States.47
To calculate the overall attributable proportion and number
of cancer cases or deaths for a given cancer type when there
were several risk factors, we assumed that the risk factors had
no interactions. We also calculated proportions and numbers
of cancer cases and deaths attributable to 4 risk factor groups:
1) tobacco smoking (cigarette and secondhand); 2) excess
body weight, alcohol intake, poor diet (consumption of red
and processed meat and low consumption of fruits/vegetables,
dietary fiber, and dietary calcium), and physical inactivity;
3) UV radiation; and 4) 6 cancer-associated infections. It is
believed that HIV only increases the risk of cancers associated
with other carcinogenic viruses (several of which were consid-
ered in this analysis) indirectly and through immunosuppres-
sion.10,13 Thus, for estimates of all infections and all evaluated
risk factors combined, we excluded HIV-related cancers from
the calculations, except for HIV-related Hodgkin and non-
Hodgkin lymphomas, because the infection causally associated
with these 2 cancer types (Epstein-Barr virus)13 was not con-
sidered in our analysis.
Numbers of attributable cancer cases and deaths overall
and by sex and individual cancer type were obtained from
separate simulation models and rounded to the nearest 10.
Thus, numbers of cancer cases or deaths by sex or for indi-
vidual cancer types may not sum to the totals. All statistical
analyses to calculate proportions and numbers of cancers
attributable to evaluated risk factors were conducted using
Stata statistical software (version 13; Stata Corporation LP,
College Station, Texas). Detailed information on statistical
analysis is provided in the Supporting Information.
Results
Incidence
In 2014, an estimated 42.0% of all incident cancers in
adults aged 30 years and older (659,640 of 1570,975
incident cancers) were attributable to the potentially
modifiable risk factors evaluated (Fig. 1). Cigarette
smoking had by far the highest PAF (19.0% of all
cases), accounting for 55.5% of all potentially prevent-
able cancers in men (184,400 of 332,320 cancers) and
35.0% in women (114,520 of 327,240 cancers). Excess body
weight had the second highest PAF (7.8%), followed by
alcohol intake (5.6%), UV radiation (4.7%), and physical
inactivity (2.9%). Excess body weight caused twice as many
cancers in women as in men in terms of both the PAF
(10.9% vs 4.8%) and case numbers (85,680 vs 37,670 cases).

 Similarly, physical inactivity accounted for 4.4% of cancers
in women compared with 1.5% in men.
The proportion of cases caused by potentially modifiable
risk factors ranged from 100% for cervical cancer and Kaposi
sarcoma to 4.3% for ovarian cancer and was greater than 50%
for 15 of the 26 cancer types (Fig. 2). In addition to cervical
cancer and Kaposi sarcoma, more than three-quarters of all
melanomas of the skin (95.1%) and cancers of the anus
(88.2%), lung (85.8%), larynx (83.2%), and oral cavity/phar-
ynx/nasal cavity/paranasal sinus (77.9%) were attributable to
evaluated risk factors. Lung cancer had the highest number of
cases attributable to evaluated risk factors in both men (99,860
cases) and women (85,050 cases), followed by skin melanoma
(45,120 cases), colorectal cancer (43,080 cases), and urinary
bladder cancer (28,050 cases) among men and cancers of the
breast (68,390 cases), corpus uteri (37,640 cases), and colorec-
tum (33,980 cases) among women (Table 2).
Cigarette and secondhand smoking
Cigarette smoking accounted for the highest proportion
and number of cancer cases of all risk factors evaluated
(23.6% of all cases in men and 14.5% in women), about
three-fourths of which occurred in current smokers. Lung
cancer had the highest proportion of smoking-attributable
cases (81.7%), followed by cancers of the upper aerodigestive
tract (larynx, 73.8%; esophagus, 50.0%; and oral and nasal
cavity, pharynx, and paranasal sinuses, 49.2%), and the
urinary bladder (46.9%) (Table 3). Lung cancer also had the
highest burden of smoking-related cancer (176,190 cases),
followed by urinary bladder cancer (35,050 cases), oral cav-
ity/pharynx/nasal cavity/paranasal sinus cancers (22,960
cases), and colorectal cancer (16,510 cases). SHS exposure
contributed an additional 5840 cases of lung cancer (2.7%).
Excess body weight
Excess body weight was associated with 4.8% of all cancers
(37,670 cases) in men and 10.9% of all cancers (85,680
cases) in women (Fig. 1). However, it accounted for more
than one-half of all cancers of the corpus uteri (60.3%) and
one-third of gallbladder (35.5%), liver (33.9%), and kidney/
renal pelvis (33.2%) cancers (Table 3). The case burden
because of excess body weight was largest for cancers of the
kidney/renal pelvis (12,250 cases), liver (6680 cases), and
esophagus (4640 cases) among men and for cancers of the
corpus uteri (31,950 cases), breast (26,780 cases), and kid-
ney/renal pelvis (7740 cases) among women. Excess body
weight accounted for a higher percentage of esophageal and
gastric cancers in men than in women.
Alcohol intake
Alcohol intake was the third largest contributor to all cancer
cases among women (6.4%; 50,110 cases) and the fourth
largest contributor among men (4.8%; 37,410 cases).
Almost one-half of oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers in

 men (46.3%; 14,670 cases) and one-fourth of esophageal
(28.4%; 1010 cases) and oral cavity and pharyngeal (27.4%,
3450 cases) cancers in women were associated with alcohol;
however, the largest burden by far was for female breast can-
cer (39,060 cases). In general, the proportions of cases
attributable to alcohol intake by cancer type were higher in
men than in women, except for esophageal cancer.
Poor diet
The proportion of all cancers attributed to poor diet ranged
from 0.4% for low dietary calcium consumption to 1.9% for
low fruit and vegetable consumption. However, for colorec-
tal cancer specifically, the PAFs ranged from 4.9% (6900
cases) for low dietary calcium to 10.3% (14,460 cases) for
low dietary fiber. Red and processed meat consumption
accounted for 5.4% and 8.2% of colorectal cancers, respec-
tively, with higher PAFs in men than in women. Low fruit
and vegetable consumption was associated with 17.6% of
oral cavity/pharyngeal cancers, 17.4% of laryngeal cancers,
and 8.9% of lung cancers, and the highest number of attrib-
utable cases was from lung cancer (19,150 cases). There
were no substantial differences between men and women in
the PAFs for low fruit and vegetable or dietary fiber, while
the PAF for low dietary calcium consumption was slightly
higher in women.
Physical inactivity
Physical inactivity accounted for 2.9% of all cancers, with
the highest proportion for cancer of the corpus uteri (26.7%;
14,140 cases), but the largest number of cases were for colon
cancer (22,930; 16.3% of all colorectal cancer cases); 3.9% of
female breast cancers (9290 cases) were attributable to phys-
ical inactivity.
The combination of excess body weight, alcohol intake,
poor diet, and physical inactivity accounted for 13.9% of
cancer cases in men (second to tobacco smoking, 24.0%),
but it accounted for the highest proportion of cancer cases

 in women (22.4%), followed by tobacco smoking (14.8%)
(Fig. 3).
UV radiation
Despite an association with only one cancer, UV radiation
was the second largest contributor to total cancer cases in
men (5.8%; 45,120 cases) and the fifth largest contributor to
total cancer cases in women (3.7%; 29,320 cases). Approxi-
mately 95% of skin melanoma cases were attributable to UV
radiation exposure, with comparable PAFs in men and
women.
Infections
Overall, 3.3% of all cancer cases were attributable to
evaluated infections (Fig. 3). By infection type, the
attributable fraction for all cases combined ranged from
0.1% to 1.2% in men and from less than 0.1% to 2.5% in
women (Fig. 1). Although the number of gastric cancer
cases attributable to H. pylori infection was similar in
men (3360 cases) and women (4070 cases), the PAF in
women (45.5%) was twice that in men (22.6%). While
liver cancer in women was equally attributable to HBV
infection (10.5%) and HCV infection (11.6%), in men,
the PAF for HCV infection (28.4%) was 5 times that for
HBV (5.4%). All cases of Kaposi sarcoma were attrib-
uted to HHV8. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma had the high-
est number of cancers (5440 cases) attributable to HIV
infection.
All cervical cancers (11,970 cases) and 88.2% of anal
cancers (6460 cases) were attributed to HPV infection.
HPV infection also accounted for large fractions of can-
cers of the vagina (64.6%; 860 cases) and penis (56.9%;
860 cases). The proportion of HPV-attributable cases was
higher in men than in women for cancers of the orophar-
ynx (37.9% vs 11.2%) and oral cavity (7.4% vs 1.6%).

Groups in Adults Aged 30 Years and Older in the United States in 2014, by Sex.
Population-attributable fractions (PAFs) are the percentages of all incident cancer cases or cancer deaths (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers). The bars in
the figure and numbers in parentheses represent 95% confidence intervals. Numbers of attributable cancer cases and deaths are rounded to the nearest 10.
Risk factor groups include tobacco smoking (cigarette and secondhand); excess body weight (Ex.w.), alcohol intake (Alc.), poor diet (Diet [consumption of red
and processed meat; and low consumption of fruits/vegetables, dietary fiber, and dietary calcium]), and physical inactivity (Ph.in.); ultraviolet (UV) radiation
(from any source); and infections (Helicobacter pylori; hepatitis B virus; hepatitis C virus; human herpes virus type 8; human immunodeficiency virus [only asso-
ciated Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma], and human papillomavirus). The proportion of cancer cases attributable to poor diet only was 4.8%
(37,810 cases) in men, 3.7% (28,880 cases) in women, and 4.2% (66,640 cases) in both sexes combined; the corresponding proportion for cancer deaths was
5.4% (16,630 deaths) in men, 4.7% (13,230 deaths) in women, and 5.1% (29,850 deaths) in both sexes combined.

 Mortality
The PAF patterns for mortality were similar to those for
incidence (Fig. 4). The proportion of all cancer deaths
attributable to evaluated risk factors in 2014 was 47.9%
(147,960 of 308,915 deaths) in men, 42.1% (117,250 of
278,606 deaths) in women, and 45.1% in both sexes com-
bined (265,150 of 587,521 deaths). The risk factors con-
sidered in this analysis contributed to more than one-half
of cancer deaths in 14 of the 26 cancer types (Fig. 5). By
cancer type, lung cancer had the largest number of deaths
attributable to evaluated risk factors in both men (74,990
deaths) and women (57,980 deaths), followed by colorec-
tal cancer in both men (15,740 deaths) and women
(12,570 deaths), liver cancer in men (9860 deaths), and
breast cancer in women (11,370 deaths) (Table 4).
Cigarette smoking accounted for the greatest number
(169,180 deaths) and proportion (28.8%) of overall cancer
deaths, including 33.1% of deaths in men and 24.0% of
deaths in women. In contrast to incidence, the fractions and
numbers of cancer deaths because of excess body weight were
similar in men (5.7%; 17,560 deaths) and women (7.4%;
20,690 deaths) (Fig. 4). Alcohol intake was the third largest
contributor to overall cancer deaths in both men (13,350;
4.3% of all cancer deaths) and women (10,110; 3.6% of all
cancer deaths). The combination of excess body weight,
alcohol intake, poor diet, and physical inactivity accounted
for 14.9% of cancer deaths in men and 16.9% in women (Fig.
3). The proportion of cancer deaths attributable to infections
was 2.6% in men and 2.8% in women, which was slightly
higher than that for UV radiation (1.9% and 1.0%, respec-
tively). The proportions and numbers of cancer deaths attrib-
utable to evaluated risk factors by cancer type are shown in
Table 5.
Discussion
We found that 42% of all incident cancer cases and almost
one-half of all cancer deaths, representing 659,640 cancer
cases and 265,150 deaths, were attributable to evaluated risk
factors in the United States in 2014. Cigarette smoking was
associated with far more cancer cases and deaths than any
other single risk factor, accounting for nearly 20% of all can-
cer cases and 30% of all cancer deaths, followed by excess
body weight. Lung cancer had the highest number of cancer
cases or deaths attributable to potentially modifiable risk
factors, followed by colorectal cancer.
The proportions of all cancer cases and deaths attributable
to smoking, red and processed meat consumption, HCV
infection, UV radiation, and HIV infection were higher in
men compared with women, reflecting historically higher
prevalence of these risk factors in men.48-53 In contrast, the

 proportions were higher in women for excess body weight,
alcohol intake, physical inactivity, and HPV infection, largely
driven by the high burden of breast, endometrial, and cervical
cancers attributable to these risk factors.
Our overall PAFs are generally comparable to those
from recent studies that used similar methods.5-11 How-
ever, there are some notable differences, mainly in the
proportion of specific cancer types attributable to a given risk
factor. For example, previous studies reported larger propor-
tions of HCV-associated liver cancer in women (26%-28%)
than in men (18%-19%),8,54 whereas we found the reverse
(28% in men vs 12% in women), consistent with higher
HCV infection prevalence in men.51 A previous estimate of
the PAF for cancer mortality specifically because of excess
weight reported a slightly lower PAF for men (4% vs 6% in
our study) and a higher PAF for women (14% vs 7%).55
However, these estimates were based on exposure data for a
relatively narrow age group and used risk estimates for all
cancers combined without taking into account the distribu-
tion of deaths and RRs by cancer type.
Several previous studies reported on the proportion of can-
cers attributable to various risk factors in the United States
using cohort data,56,57 and the findings from some of those
studies differ slightly from ours. For example, compared with
our study, the PAFs for cancer incidence within cohort studies
of health professionals reported by Song and Giovannucci56

 were lower than those in our study for both men (33% vs 43%
in our study) and women (25% vs 42%), whereas the PAF for
mortality was slightly lower in men (44% vs 48%) and higher
in women (48% vs 42%). The lower PAFs in that study may be
related in part to the lower numbers of risk factors considered
and the inclusion of moderate alcohol drinkers and some for-
mer smokers in the low-risk group. In general, however, PAFs
within cohort studies may not be directly generalizable to the
entire US population, mainly because of potential differences
in exposure prevalence between the general population and
cohort study participants.58,59
Smoking
Despite substantial declines in overall smoking prevalence
over the past 5 decades,41,48,60 cigarette smoking remains the
leading contributor to cancer cases and deaths in both men
and women, accounting for 19% of all cancer cases and 29%
of all cancer deaths. These estimates are comparable to find-
ings from previous studies.5,9 Our results reemphasize that
expanding comprehensive tobacco-control programs could
have the greatest impact on reducing the overall cancer burden
in the United States. It is noteworthy that we did not include
the use of tobacco products other than cigarettes14,61 and only
considered smoking for cancer types with an established causal
association according to IARC reports, although there is accu-
mulating evidence for causal associations between smoking
and additional cancers (eg, breast cancer).62 In an earlier study
that also considered these cancer types, the proportion of can-
cer deaths attributable to cigarette smoking was about 32%.63
Furthermore, a considerable proportion of cancer deaths cate-
gorized as unknown site actually may be caused by smoking-
attributable cancers.62 Thus, the burden of cancer attributable
to smoking is likely higher than we have estimated.
Proven measures to reduce smoking include taxation,
smoke-free laws, assistance with smoking cessation, warning
labels and media campaigns, and marketing bans.48 In the
United States, taxation appears to have the strongest effect,
followed by smoke-free laws, which can also substantially
reduce exposure to SHS and related health issues.48,64,65
Tobacco taxation has a higher impact on lower income peo-
ple, who also have a higher smoking prevalence, and on
youth, because taxation may prevent them from initiating
smoking.48,65,66 However, there is wide variation across states
in the number and intensity of implemented measures.9,64,66
For example, the state-level tax per cigarette pack as of
April 2017 ranged from $0.17 in Missouri to $4.35 in
New York (with an additional $1.50 in New York City).67
In addition, as of July 2017, only 25 states and the District of
Columbia had implemented comprehensive smoke-free laws
in all 3 recommended locations (worksite, restaurants, and
bars).68 Currently, no state has fully implemented the CDC’s
recommended comprehensive tobacco-control measures.69
It is also important to integrate tobacco initiation preven-
tion and support for cessation into the health care system,70
but these services are generally underused, especially in low-
income and uninsured individuals.71 Moreover, only less
than 4% of eligible current or former smokers received
the recommended lung cancer screening in the United
States in 2015.72 Overall, broad implementation of effec-
tive cancer prevention and control interventions, includ-
ing tobacco-control policies, has been challenging in the
United States.73 There is a need for increasing awareness
about the health hazards of smoking to discourage initia-
tion and promote cessation; for equitable access to cessa-
tion services; and, more important, for further political
commitment
to
tobacco
control
(including
securing
financial resources) at the local, state, and federal levels to
substantially
reduce
the
burden
of
smoking-related
diseases.69,74
Excess Body Weight, Alcohol Intake, Poor Diet,
and Physical Inactivity
We estimated that nearly 7% to 8% of all cancer cases and
deaths in the United States were attributable to excess body
weight and 4% to 6% of cases and deaths were due to alco-
hol intake, respectively, similar to other recent esti-
mates.6,7,11,75 Previous PAFs for poor diet included variable
dietary factors and criteria,76 but more recent PAFs are
comparable to our estimates (4% to 5% of all cancer cases
and deaths).77 Our estimated PAF for physical inactivity
(2% to 3% of all cancer cases and deaths) is slightly higher
than earlier PAFs.4
The combination of excess body weight, alcohol intake,
poor diet, and physical inactivity accounted for the highest
proportion of all cancer cases in women and was second only
to tobacco smoking in men. These 4 combined risk factors
also accounted for the second highest proportion of cancer
deaths in both men and women. These findings underscore
the importance of adherence to comprehensive guidelines on
weight control, alcohol, diet, and physical activity. Indeed,
large, prospective epidemiologic studies have demonstrated
that adherence to a lifestyle consistent with the American
Cancer Society’s cancer prevention guidelines for maintain-
ing a healthy body weight, limiting alcohol intake (for those
who drink), consuming a healthy diet, and being physically
active38 is associated with a reduced risk of developing and
dying from cancer.78,79 Currently, nearly three-fourth of
adults and one-third of children and adolescents aged 2 to
19 years are overweight or obese.80,81 Furthermore, many
Americans regularly drink alcohol and do not meet other
dietary recommendations.49,60,82 Despite a modest decrease
in physical inactivity prevalence over the past few decades, it
remains substantially high in the United States (see Support-
ing Information Table 2).83
Potentially Preventable Cancers in US

CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians
 For many children, excess body weight extends into
adulthood and increases the risk of adverse health condi-
tions and death,84,85 so weight control in childhood should
be a major focus of any strategy to control the obesity epi-
demic.86,87 School-based interventions can provide an
opportunity for promoting healthy diet, physical activity,
and weight control, as well as family-based interven-
tions.88-90 Several studies have demonstrated that intensive
lifestyle interventions to promote healthy eating and physi-
cal activity are effective among adults,91,92 although long-
term effects of such interventions at the population level
have generally been modest at best.83,88,89 Studies of behav-
ioral interventions for reducing alcohol intake have focused
primarily on alcohol use disorders and have produced mixed
results,93 whereas information on more commonly con-
sumed levels is much more limited.
Effective implementation of preventive measures (consul-
tation, screening, and treatment) in the health care system
and increasing awareness through education campaigns may
help to reduce excess body weight and alcohol intake and
promote healthier diet and physical activity.84,92,94-98 Some
regulations may be highly beneficial, such as taxation and
reducing marketing of nonessential high-calorie foods, sug-
ary beverages, and alcohol; regulating alcohol outlet density
and the days and hours of alcohol sale; and improving civil
structure (eg, increasing public transportation and safe side-
walks).99-103 For example, similar to the effect of taxation
on tobacco smoking, higher excise taxes on alcohol have
been associated with a substantial reduction in alcohol
intake.104 However, more research is still needed to identify
tailored, more efficient interventions, particularly those that
could be successfully applied at the community level.
UV Radiation
We estimated that nearly 95% of all skin melanoma cases
and deaths in the United States are attributable to UV radi-
ation, comparable to earlier studies.46 Moreover, UV radia-
tion from sun exposure and indoor tanning can increase the
risk of nonmelanoma skin cancers (4.3 million individuals
are treated annually in the United States), which are less
fatal but associated with substantial financial burden.105
Both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers are increas-
ing in the United States, making skin cancer prevention
increasingly important.105-107
Sun-protection measures, including limiting excessive sun
exposure; wearing protective clothing, hat, and sunglasses;
and using broad-spectrum sunscreens, have been recom-
mended to reduce skin cancer risk.108 Although more research
on the effectiveness of sunscreen use at the population level is
needed,109 several studies have either shown a direct decrease
in melanoma risk after regular application of approved prod-
ucts110,111 or have suggested a reduction in melanoma
incidence rates in areas where sunscreens are freely avail-
able.112 However, the uptake of sun-protection measures in
the United States is far from optimal, but it may improve
through multicomponent interventions at the community
level.108,113
Reducing indoor tanning is particularly important among
adolescents, because exposure at younger ages is associated
with a higher risk of skin cancer up to at least age 50
years.114,115 Federal- and state-level interventions to restrict
access to indoor tanning or educate youth about the harms
are likely to have contributed to a decrease in the overall
indoor tanning prevalence among youth in the United States
in recent years.116-118 However, because of wide variations in
regulation strictness (including the defined age limit) or
compliance across states, high numbers of adolescents in the
United States still engage in indoor tanning (eg, 1.2 million
[7% of] high school students in 2015).118
Infections
Approximately 3% of all cancer cases in our study were
attributable to infections, similar to 4% in an earlier study
that also included less common infections (for which expo-
sure prevalence could only be estimated).10 H. pylori infec-
tion prevalence in the United States has decreased in the
past century, probably because of improvements in sanitation
and living conditions and more widespread antibiotic use.119
This trend was followed by a decrease in gastric noncardia
cancer incidence rates in the country.120 Currently, screening
for H. pylori and subsequent treatment is only recommended
for people with certain conditions, and there is no evidence
to support routine screening in other individuals.121,122
In contrast to H. pylori infection, chronic HCV infection
prevalence in the United States increased in the last one-half
of the 20th century (mainly among Baby Boomers),51 which
contributed in part to rising liver cancer rates.123 Interven-
tions to reduce HCV and HBV burden include increasing
awareness; HBV vaccination; screening; treatment to cure
HCV infection; and comprehensive programs to reduce
transmission through high-risk behaviors (eg, using shared
syringes); however, the uptake of many of these interventions
is suboptimal in the United States.123-127 For example, one-
time HCV testing is recommended for Baby Boomers, but
only 14% report HCV testing.128 HBV vaccination coverage
is only 65% among health care personnel and is even lower in
other high-risk adults for whom HBV vaccination is recom-
mended
(eg,
27%
among
those
with
chronic
liver
conditions).127
Among people with HIV infection, highly active antire-
troviral therapy reduces the risk of cancers that define the
onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), ie,
Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cervical can-
cer.129,130 At the same time, however, increasing rates of

 successful highly active antiretroviral therapy have also
increased the number of HIV-infected individuals who are
aging, leading to increased number of non–AIDS-defining
cancers in this population.129,130 As most carcinogenic
infections (because of shared transmission routes with HIV)
and smoking are more common in people with HIV infec-
tion,131 receiving recommended vaccines (including HPV
vaccine through age 26 years and HBV vaccine at any
age),132 screenings (eg, for HCV infection), and smoking-
cessation services is even more important in this group.
Some cancer types that are highly associated with HPV
infection have shown contradictory incidence rate trends
in the United States in recent decades. Cervical cancer
incidence and death rates have been decreasing since the
mid-20th century, mainly because of the widespread use of
cervical cancer screening.133 Conversely, incidence rates for
cancers of the tongue base and tonsil among younger men
and anal cancer in both sexes have been increasing, in part
because of changes in sexual behavior.134-136 Although
HPV vaccination can prevent anogenital cancer and is rec-
ommended at ages 11 and 12 years (but can be given up to
age 26 years),137 only 50% of females and 38% of males ages
13 to 17 years in the United States were up to date with
HPV vaccination as of 2016.138 Furthermore, the cervical
cancer screening rate for uninsured women, among whom
HPV infection is more common, is much lower than that
for insured women (61% vs 84%, respectively).60
Strengths and Limitations
We have provided contemporary estimates of the PAFs of
cancer cases and deaths for several potentially modifiable risk
factors (including some risk factors that were not included in
previous studies) in the United States using contemporary,
nationally
representative
data
on
exposure,
occurrence
(accounting for delayed reporting), and RRs. Furthermore,
we used a systematic approach, as well as exposure and out-
come data largely from the same period, to compute PAFs;
thus, our estimates are comparable across risk factors and
cancer types.
However, there are several inherent limitations in studies
that estimate the PAF of cancer caused by specific expo-
sures. The selected RRs may not be homogenous across
sexes and age groups. In addition, we used the same RRs in
calculations for both cancer deaths and cases, because RRs
were generally available only for cases, with some excep-
tions. However, some risk factors may affect the survival of
patients with cancer and, thus, have an impact on cancer
mortality beyond that for incidence. Similarly, survival for
some cancer subtypes for which we estimated death counts
using case-based proportions is known to be different from
survival for other subtypes within the overall cancer type
(eg, for colon cancer, 5-year relative survival is slightly lower
than that for rectal cancer). Furthermore, in general, we
used the most recent exposure data rather than historical
data; because, for most risk factors, the latency from expo-
sure to cancer occurrence is not well defined.139,140 There-
fore, our PAF estimates for exposures with declining or
increasing prevalence in recent years could be underesti-
mated or overestimated, respectively.
Finally, when calculating PAFs, we assumed that the risk
factors were independent, and no robust, comprehensive
information was available on the nature or magnitude of the
amount of overlap among risk factors at the population level.
Therefore, some PAFs may be slightly overestimated. Con-
versely, we did not include several other potentially modifi-
able risk factors, such as breastfeeding, because of a lack of
representative exposure data (see Supporting Information
Table 1), and we did not consider some other likely associa-
tions that had less than sufficient or strong evidence for a
causal association with cancer according to the IARC or the
WCRF/AICR, notably for smoking,62 despite accumulating
evidence for a causal association. Thus, we likely underesti-
mated the actual proportions of cancers attributable to some
individual risk factors and all potentially modifiable factors
combined. Furthermore, some risk factors may be more
important when exposure occurs in adolescence or earlier,141
such as excess body weight and colorectal cancer,142 which
are likely unaccounted for by RRs from studies of mostly
older adults. More research is needed on earlier life expo-
sures that can increase the risk of cancer in adulthood.
Conclusions
An estimated 42% of all cancer cases and nearly one-half of
all cancer deaths in the United States in 2014 were attribut-
able to evaluated risk factors, many of which could have been
mitigated by effective preventive strategies, such as excise
taxes on cigarettes to reduce smoking and vaccinations
against HPV and HBV infections. Our findings emphasize
the continued need for widespread implementation of
known preventive measures in the country to reduce the
morbidity and premature mortality from cancers associated
with potentially modifiable risk factors. Increasing access to
preventive health care and awareness about preventive mea-
sures should be part of any comprehensive strategy for broad
and equitable implementation of interventions to accelerate
progress against cancer. However, for some of the risk factors
considered in the current analysis, such as unhealthy diet,
further implementation research is needed for widespread
application of known interventions, particularly for popula-
tions at a higher risk. Further research is also needed on the
etiology of cancer, particularly cancers for which avoidable
risk factors with substantial PAFs are not well known (eg,
prostate and pancreas cancers) or where the evidence is con-
sidered insufficient for causality in humans. �
