Abstract
Background: Social isolation is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), but it is unclear which elements play a
crucial role in this association. Therefore, we assessed the associations of a broad range of structural and functional
social network characteristics with normal glucose metabolism, pre-diabetes, newly diagnosed T2DM and previously
diagnosed T2DM.
Methods: Participants originated from The Maastricht Study, a population-based cohort study (n = 2861, mean age 60.0 ±
8.2 years, 49% female, 28.8% T2DM (oversampled)). Social network characteristics were assessed through a name generator
questionnaire. Diabetes status was determined by an oral glucose tolerance test. We used multinomial regression analyses
to investigate the associations between social network characteristics and diabetes status, stratified by sex.
Results: More socially isolated individuals (smaller social network size) more frequently had newly diagnosed and
previously diagnosed T2DM, while this association was not observed with pre-diabetes. In women, proximity and the
type of relationship was associated with newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed T2DM. A lack of social participation
was associated with pre-diabetes as well as with previously diagnosed T2DM in women, and with previously diagnosed
T2DM in men. Living alone was associated with higher odds of previously diagnosed T2DM in men, but not in women.
Less emotional support related to important decisions, less practical support related to jobs, and less practical
support for sickness were associated with newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed T2DM in men and
women, but not in pre-diabetes.
Conclusion: This study shows that several aspects of structural and functional characteristics of the social
network were associated with newly and previously diagnosed T2DM, partially different for men and women.
These results may provide useful targets for T2DM prevention efforts.

 Background
The growing number of people with chronic conditions,
such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is a rising
problem in health care. An estimated 171 million indi-
viduals worldwide had T2DM in 2000, and this number
is expected to increase to 366 million individuals in
2030, with a higher prevalence in men [1]. Because
T2DM leads to severe complications and significantly
reduces life expectancy [2], and multiborbidity is com-
mon [3], these figures underline the need for interven-
tions that can prevent the development of T2DM.
Several environmental and lifestyle factors, as well as
psychosocial factors such as depression and stress, have
been identified as relevant for the development of
T2DM [4–7]. Recently, there is raising interest for the
role of social network characteristics in the development
of T2DM [7–14]. Prevention strategies that promote
social integration and participation may prove promising
[15–18]. Among individuals with T2DM, beneficial ef-
fects of social support have been reported on diabetes
care [19], activation for self-management [20], and
health/health-related behaviors [21].
Given the results of previous research, a more detailed
and conjoint investigation of a broad range of social
network characteristics is essential. Previous studies on
social network characteristics have typically focused on
either structural or functional characteristics, while both
have been found to associate with T2DM risk [7–14].
For example, the single indicator low emotional support
is associated with a doubled risk of T2DM in women
[7], while prevalent T2DM is also related to lower
emotional support [8]. Negative friend support increases
the odds of T2DM by 30% in both men and women
[14]. In addition, poor structural support has been
shown to increase the risk of T2DM in men by 50%, par-
ticularly evident among those with a low education level
[9]. Furthermore, several studies have found that living
alone was an independent predictor of T2DM in men,
but not in women [7, 11, 12]. In contrast, one study re-
ported that high social integration increased the odds of
T2DM in men [12]. However, the associations of social
network characteristics with pre-diabetes or newly diag-
nosed T2DM were less clear, studies accounting for pre-
diabetes and newly diagnosed T2DM are rare [12, 13].
In light of these considerations, the aim of the present
study was to assess the associations of a broad range of
social
network
characteristics
with
diabetes
status.
Specifically, we assessed whether structural characteris-
tics such as social network size, contact frequency, type
of relationship, living alone and social participation are
associated with pre-diabetes and newly diagnosed and
previously diagnosed T2DM. Next, we addressed the
question of whether functional characteristics of the
social network (social support) are associated with pre-
diabetes, newly diagnosed T2DM and previously diag-
nosed T2DM. To investigate the differences between
men and women, all analyses were stratified by sex.
Methods
Study population
We used data from The Maastricht Study, an observa-
tional prospective population-based cohort study. The
rationale and methodology have been described previ-
ously [22]. In brief, the study focuses on the etiology,
pathophysiology, complications and comorbidities of
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is characterized by
an extensive phenotyping approach. The study uses
state-of-the-art imaging techniques and extensive bio-
banking to determine both determinants and clinical
outcomes of health status.
Eligible for participation were all individuals aged
between 40 and 75 years and living in the southern part
of the Netherlands. Participants with and without dia-
betes were recruited through mass media campaigns and
from the municipal registries and the regional Diabetes
Patient Registry via mailings. Recruitment was stratified
according to known T2DM status, with an oversampling
of individuals with T2DM, for reasons of efficiency.
Enrollment started in November 2010 and is still on-
going, aiming to include 10.000 participants. The present
report includes cross-sectional data from the first 3451
participants, who completed the baseline survey between
November 2010 and September 2013. The examinations
of each participant were performed within a time
window of 3 months. Further information on The
Maastricht study can be found elsewhere [22].
After excluding participants who did not provide data
on their social network (n = 447 (12.9%), the main
reason for missing data was incomplete questionnaires),
participants with type 1 diabetes (n = 33), and other
types of diabetes (n = 4), and participants with missing
information on covariates (n = 106), a total of 2861
participants were included in the present analyses. The
participants without social network data did not differ
from those with these data with respect to diabetes
status, sex, educational level, or body mass index (BMI).
However, the participants who did not provide social
network data were slightly younger than those who did
(mean age 59 versus 60 years, (p < 0.001)).
Measurements
Glucose metabolism status
To determine glucose metabolism status, all participants
(except those who used insulin) underwent a standard-
ized 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after an
overnight fast [22]. Glucose metabolism was defined
according to the World Health Organization 2006 cri-
teria as normal glucose metabolism (NGM), impaired

 fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT),
or T2DM [23]. Individuals on diabetes medication were
classified as having T2DM. We defined pre-diabetes as
having either IFG or IGT and newly diagnosed (un-
aware) T2DM as negative self-reported T2DM with a
positive OGTT.
Social network questionnaire
Data
on
individual
social
networks
were
collected
through a questionnaire using a name generator method
[24, 25]. A detailed description of this questionnaire can
be found in the additional file (see Additional file 1).
The name generator first requires a respondent to identify
actual persons, and then several additional questions about
these individuals are asked (sex, age, type of relationship,
geographic distance, and the number of members who pro-
vided informational, practical or emotional support).
Structural characteristics of the social network
The structural network characteristics were computed
from the questionnaire. In brief, network size was
defined as the total number of unique network members
(alters) mentioned in the questionnaire. Total contacts
per half year was defined as the sum of all contacts per
half year. In addition, the percentage of network mem-
bers that the participant (ego) had daily/weekly contact
with, that were household members, that lived within
walking distance, and the percentage of network mem-
bers that were family members or friends was computed.
Those social network constructs of percentages within
the network were defined in steps of 10%. Based on an
average network size of 10 network members, a change
in one network member corresponds to 10%.
Living alone was defined as a person who lived alone in
his household. Social participation was defined as mem-
bership in, for instance, a sports club, religious group,
volunteer organization, discussion group, self-support
group, internet club, or other organization. Additional
information on structural social network characteristics
used in the present study can be found in Table 1.
Functional characteristics of the social network (social
support)
Participants were asked to indicate the number of mem-
bers who provided informational support, emotional
support related to discomfort, emotional support related
to important decisions, practical support related to jobs,
and practical support related to sickness. For every type
of support, participants could name a maximum of 5
network members. This results in a possible range of 0
to 5 for the functional characteristics of the social net-
work. Additional information on functional social net-
work characteristics used in the present study can be
found in Table 1.
General measurements
Self-administered questionnaires were used to assess
educational level, employment status, smoking status,
alcohol consumption, history of cardiovascular disease
(CVD), diabetes medication use and diabetes duration.
Body mass index (BMI) and hypertension were mea-
sured at the study centre [22]. General health was
assessed with the SF-36 Health Survey and transformed
scale scores were calculated according to Ware et al.
(1994) [26].
Statistical analysis
Descriptive analyses were performed to examine the
characteristics of the study population, and the results
were presented as the mean and standard deviation (SD)
or percentages and numbers. To assess the differences
between participants with NGM, pre-diabetes, newly
diagnosed T2DM and previously diagnosed T2DM, we
performed chi-square, analysis of variance (ANOVA)
and Kruskal-Wallis tests, as appropriate. We conducted
multinomial logistic regression analyses to examine the
association of the social network variables with diabetes
status, using NGM as reference. For every network vari-
able, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
(95%CIs) were reported. For descriptive purposes, social
network variables were reversed, i.e., multiplied by −1
(lower values on social network variables indicated risk
factor). Every network variable was assessed separately,
risk estimates were adjusted for age, BMI, educational
level, employment status, alcohol consumption, smoking
status, hypertension, prior CVD and general health
status (SF36). As previous research has shown different
associations between social network and diabetes status
between men and women [7, 9, 11, 12], we tested for
statistical
interactions
(effect
modification)
of
the
network variables with sex. Because the majority of the
social network variables showed an interaction with sex
(p < 0.1), all analyses were stratified by sex. All analyses
were conducted using IBM SPSS software version 21.0
(IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). Associations with p ≤
0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
The overall study population consisted of 2861 partici-
pants with a mean age of 60.0 ± 8.2 years, of whom
slightly less than half were women (49%). Table 2
presents descriptive characteristics according to diabetes
status. A total of 1623 (56.7%) participants had a normal
glucose metabolism status (NGM), 430 (15.0%) had
pre-diabetes, 111 (3.9%) were newly diagnosed as T2DM
at study entry, and 697 (24.4%) had previously diagnosed
T2DM. Participants with T2DM were older, more often
men, had a higher BMI, were lower educated, were more
often retired, were more often current smokers, were

 less often high alcohol consumers, and had prior CVD
and hypertension more often than participants with
NGM or pre-diabetes. In participants with previously
diagnosed T2DM, the median self-reported diabetes
duration was 7 years (IQR 3.0–12.0). Participants with
newly diagnosed T2DM were more often higher edu-
cated, less often obese, less often current smokers, more
often high alcohol consumers and had prior CVD and
hypertension less often than participants with previously
diagnosed T2DM.
Description of structural characteristics of the social
network
Figure 1 shows a simplified representation of the social
network size, contact frequency, geographic distance,
and proportions of family members and friends accord-
ing to diabetes status for both men and women. In sum-
mary, the network size was 12, 11, 9, and 8 in women
with NGM, pre-diabetes, newly diagnosed T2DM and
previously diagnosed T2DM, respectively. In men, the
network size was 10 in NGM and pre-diabetes and 7 in

Total contacts per half year
A contact was defined as an interaction between persons. Total contacts (interactions
between persons) per half year were computed as follows. We used the highest
contact frequency (e.g., daily contact) for every network member as an indicator of the
actual contact frequency. Second, we recoded the answer categories of the
questionnaire to an estimated number of contacts per half year. For example, “half-
yearly” was assumed to comprise one contact, “quarterly” two contacts, “monthly” 6
contacts and “daily or weekly” 48 contacts. Third, we computed the sum of all contacts
per half year as the total contact frequency.

 newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed T2DM. The
total number of contacts per half year was 268, 252, 224,
212 in women with NGM, pre-diabetes, newly diagnosed
T2DM and previously diagnosed T2DM, respectively,
and 224, 216, 175, 189 for men, respectively. The per-
centage of daily/weekly contacts was 46.3% in NGM and
54.2% in previously diagnosed T2DM. The percentage of
family members was 55.9% in the NGM group and
64.7% in the previously diagnosed T2DM group. The
percentage of friends was 30.0% in NGM and 21.4% in
previously diagnosed T2DM (Table 2).
The prevalence of living alone was 14.7%, 17.4%,
17.1% and 20.2% and the prevalence of social participa-
tion was 71.6%, 64.2%, 61.1%, and 56.4% in NGM, pre-
diabetes, newly diagnosed T2DM and previously diag-
nosed T2DM, respectively (Table 2).
Description of functional characteristics of the social
network
Participants with newly diagnosed and previously diag-
nosed T2DM reported lower levels of informational sup-
port related to advice on problems, emotional support
related to discomfort and related to important decisions
and practical support related to jobs around the house
and related to sickness than participants with NGM or
pre-diabetes (Table 2).
Association of structural characteristics of the social
network with diabetes status
Table 3 shows that each fewer network member reported
(smaller network size) was associated with 12% higher
odds of newly diagnosed T2DM and a 8% higher odds of
previously diagnosed T2DM in women and an 10% and
5% higher odds of newly diagnosed T2DM and previ-
ously diagnosed T2DM in men, respectively, compared
to NGM. Each 10% drop in network members living
within walking distance was associated with an 21%
higher odds of newly diagnosed T2DM and with an 9%
higher odds of previously diagnosed T2DM in women.
Every additional 10% of the network that was a house-
hold member was associated with a 25% higher odds of
newly diagnosed T2DM and an 15% higher odds of pre-
viously diagnosed T2DM in women and a 29% higher
odds of newly diagnosed T2DM in men. Each 10% drop
in network members who were friends was associated
with a 14% higher odds of previously diagnosed T2DM
in women.
In women, no significant associations between living
alone and diabetes were observed. In men, living alone
was associated with a 59% higher odds of pre-diabetes
(borderline significant), a 84% higher odds of newly diag-
nosed T2DM (borderline significant), and a 94% higher
odds of previously diagnosed T2DM compared to NGM
(Table 3). A lack of social participation was associated
with a 60% higher odds of pre-diabetes and a 112%
higher odds of previously diagnosed T2DM in women,
compared to NGM (Table 3). In men, lack of social
participation was associated with a 42% higher odds of
having previously diagnosed T2DM. In Fig. 2, ORs for
social participation and living alone were depicted.

network with diabetes status
One unit less emotional support on important decisions
was associated with a 34% higher odds of newly diag-
nosed T2DM in women. One unit less practical support

Discussion
This study is the first to assess the associations be-
tween T2DM and a broad range of functional and
structural network characteristics in adults. The study
shows that more socially isolated individuals (smaller
social network size) more frequently had newly diag-
nosed and previously diagnosed T2DM, while this
association was not observed with pre-diabetes. In
women, proximity and the type of relationship was
associated with newly diagnosed and previously diag-
nosed T2DM. A lack of social participation was asso-
ciated with pre-diabetes as well as with previously
diagnosed
T2DM
in
women,
and
with
previously
diagnosed T2DM in men. Living alone was associated
with higher odds of previously diagnosed T2DM in
men, but not in women. Less emotional support
related to important decisions was associated with
newly diagnosed T2DM in women, and both newly
and previously diagnosed T2DM in men. Less prac-
tical support related to jobs was associated with pre-
viously
diagnosed
T2DM
in
women
and
newly
diagnosed T2DM in men. Less practical support for
sickness was associated with newly diagnosed and
previously
diagnosed
T2DM
in
men
and
women.
These associations were not observed in pre-diabetes.
All associations between social network characteristics
and diabetes status were independent of BMI, educa-
tional level, employment status, alcohol consumption,
smoking status, general health status and chronic condi-
tions as prior CVD and hypertension.

 Structural social network characteristics
The present study showed that social isolation, indicated
by a smaller social network size, was associated with
higher odds of newly diagnosed and previously diag-
nosed T2DM in men and women. This finding is in line
with longitudinal analyses conducted by Altevers et al.
(2015), and Lukaschek et al. (2017) who found that poor
structural support (measured by Social Network index
[SNI], including a measure of social network size)
increased the risk of T2DM [9, 27]. In addition, our data
show that a smaller social network size was only associ-
ated with T2DM, not with pre-diabetes. This is also
consistent with longitudinal data, which did not find
significant associations of social integration, including
structural characteristics, with pre-diabetes [12]. Fur-
thermore, we as well as Gallo et al. (2015) observed
associations between structural network characteristics
and T2DM among both sexes [13], while Altevers et al.
(2015) found this association among men, but not
among women [9]. A possible explanation for this dis-
crepancy is that Altevers et al. (2015) limited the vari-
ability in their sample by dichotomizing the Social
Network Index (SNI), while we and Gallo et al. (2015)
used a continuous scale. Therefore, their non-significant
findings in women may be attributable to low power [9].
In women, higher percentages of network members
living within walking distance and higher percentages
household members were associated with newly and pre-
viously diagnosed T2DM. Similarly, a network composed
of fewer friends was associated with higher odds of pre-
viously diagnosed T2DM in women, suggesting that the
smaller network size in T2DM is largely attributable to
having less friends than those with NGM. The associa-
tions of proximity and the type of relationship with
T2DM in women indicate that a network that is central-
ized to those with the closest relationships, with less
network members at a social and geographical distance,
is associated with T2DM. In men, we observed that
higher percentages of household members were associ-
ated with newly diagnosed T2DM. Furthermore, these
associations were again not observed in pre-diabetes.
As we are the first to address the composition of the
social network in terms of proximity and type of rela-
tionship in relation to T2DM, and as significant associa-
tions have mostly been observed for women, further
research is needed to corroborate our findings.
Living alone was associated with higher odds of newly
diagnosed and previously diagnosed T2DM in men, but
not in women. This finding is consistent with previous
longitudinal studies that identified living alone as a risk
factor for T2DM [11, 27], while having a partner
decreases the risk for T2DM [12] in men but not in
women. Moreover, similar to Hilding et al. (2015), we
only found borderline significant associations between
living alone and pre-diabetes [12]. However, these non-
significant risk estimates may be attributable to a low
power, as we had a relatively small sample to address
this association (less than 40 men with pre-diabetes were
living alone).
The lack of social participation was associated with
pre-diabetes in women and with previously diagnosed
T2DM
in
both
men
and
women.
In
longitudinal
research, participation in social activities has been shown
to decrease the risk of pre-diabetes and T2DM in
women and the risk of pre-diabetes in men [12]. How-
ever, in this cross-sectional study, we cannot exclude the
possibility that early changes in glucose metabolism may
cause non-specific complaints such as tiredness and feel-
ing unwell, which may explain why individuals chose to
limit their social participation. In either scenario, social
participation may serve as a target for intervention or an
indicator suitable for diabetes prevention strategies.
Functional social network characteristics
In the present study, we observed that less emotional
support with important decisions was associated with
newly diagnosed T2DM in women, and both newly and
previously diagnosed T2DM in men. Less practical
support with small jobs was associated with previously
diagnosed
T2DM
in
women
and
newly
diagnosed
T2DM in men. Less practical support for sickness was
associated with newly diagnosed and previously diag-
nosed T2DM in men and women. Both Norberg et al.
(2007) and Jones et al. (2015) showed that low emotional
support was associated with T2DM in women [7] and
older adults [8], although their methods used to assess
functional support were less detailed. The longitudinal
results from Norberg et al. (2007) suggest that low func-
tional support increases the risk of T2DM [7].
To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the
association of a broad range of functional support
measures with pre-diabetes, newly diagnosed T2DM and
previously diagnosed T2DM. Our results indicate that
emotional support in important decisions, and practical
support with small jobs and in sickness were important
characteristics that should be addressed in T2DM pre-
vention strategies. However, in this cross-sectional study,
we cannot assess whether participants received an abso-
lutely lower level of functional support, or whether they
perceive it as less adequate to their needs (that means
relatively lower), and therefore, their satisfaction with
functional support is lower. Recently, it has been shown
that low social network satisfaction is associated with
increased risk of T2DM [27].
Strengths & Limitations
A major strength of the current study was the measure-
ment of structural and functional characteristics with
Brinkhues et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:955 
Page 9 of 12
 the use of a name generator, one of the best known,
most detailed and most widely used instruments to
examine ego-centered network data [28]. This resulted
in a much broader range of structural and functional
social network characteristics than assessed in previous
studies. Next, we were able to examine the associations
of structural and functional network characteristics in
individuals with pre-diabetes, newly diagnosed and pre-
viously diagnosed T2DM compared to those with NGM.
The associations of pre-diabetes and newly diagnosed
T2DM have rarely been studied before. Moreover, we
adjusted the analyses for several different variables, i.e.
age, body mass index, educational level, employment
status, smoking status, alcohol consumption, general
health and chronic medical conditions, showing robust
results, which makes residual confounding unlikely.
Finally, the population-based design of The Maastricht
Study and its size were key assets [22].
A few limitations should also be mentioned. The study
is cross-sectional in nature, and therefore, the possibility
of reverse causality cannot be excluded. Furthermore, as
we performed multiple statistical tests, our analyses may
include false positive results. However, the majority of
significant associations had a p-value ≤0.01 or even
≤0.001, limiting the chance of false positive findings.
Additionally, the present study population consisted of
relatively
healthy
participants,
as
is
common
in
population-based cohort studies, and it is possible that
we did not include those in the population who were the
most socially isolated. Therefore, we may have underes-
timated the effect sizes.
Implications
Targeting social network characteristics may prove a
promising prevention strategy for T2DM. More socially
isolated individuals (smaller network size) more often
had T2DM. Broadening their network should be encour-
aged, as we have shown that a smaller social network
size was associated with T2DM in both men and women.
Moreover, social participation was associated with pre-
diabetes and previously diagnosed T2DM, stimulating
participants to became members of a club may also be
considered
in
future
intervention
development.
In
addition, social participation may be used as an indicator
in diabetes prevention strategies. Moreover, interven-
tions aiming to generate behavioral change (e.g., physical
activity) may also tailor to the social network of the par-
ticipant, as it has been shown that network targeting can
be used to increase the adoption of specific public health
interventions [17]. In addition, as men living alone seem
to be at a higher risk for the development of T2DM,
they should be indicated as high-risk group.
Moreover, targeting social network characteristics may
also have benefits for other chronic conditions, as it has
been shown that most of those with a long-term
disorder are multimorbid [3], and social network charac-
teristics have been found to associate with cardiovascu-
lar, endocrine, and immune function [29]. In addition,
social isolation and living alone have been found to
increase the likelihood of mortality [30].
Conclusions
To conclude, this study was the first to assess a broad
range of structural and functional social network charac-
teristics and their associations with normal glucose
metabolism, pre-diabetes, newly diagnosed T2DM and
previously diagnosed T2DM in a large sample of 40- to
75-year-old adults. These results were independent of
BMI, educational level, employment status, alcohol con-
sumption, smoking status, general health status and
chronic conditions as prior CVD and hypertension. Men
and women who were more socially isolated, and who
received less emotional and practical support, more
frequently had newly and previously diagnosed T2DM,
while this was not observed in individuals with pre-
diabetes. In women, proximity and the type of relation-
ship was associated with newly and previously diagnosed
T2DM. A lack of social participation was associated with
pre-diabetes in women, as well as with previously diag-
nosed T2DM in both sexes. Living alone was associated
with higher odds of previously diagnosed T2DM in men,
but not in women. This study shows that several aspects
of structural and functional characteristics of the social
network were associated with newly and previously diag-
nosed T2DM, partially different for men and women.
These results may provide useful targets for T2DM pre-
vention efforts.
