Abstract
BACKGROUND—We recently reported an increased risk of herpes zoster (shingles or zoster) in 
children with asthma, but little is known about whether it is true for adults with asthma. We 
determined whether asthma is associated with an increased risk of zoster in adults.
METHODS—This study was designed as a population-based case-control study. Zoster cases 
during the study period were identified among adults (aged ≥ 50 years) who resided in Olmsted 
County, Minnesota. We compared the frequency of asthma between zoster cases and birthday- and 
gender-matched controls (1:2 matching) without a history of zoster. Asthma status was ascertained 
by predetermined criteria. Conditional logistic regression model was used to assess the association 
of asthma with risk of zoster.
RESULTS—A total of 371 zoster cases and their 742 matched controls were enrolled. Of the 371 
cases, 246 (66%) were females, 348 cases (94%) were Caucasians, and the mean (± standard 
deviation) age was 66.8±10.7 years. Twenty-three percent (N=87) of zoster cases had a history of 
asthma, compared to 15% (N=114) in controls. Controlling for pertinent covariates and 
confounders, there was a significant association between a history of asthma and risk of zoster

 (adjusted odds ratio: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.20–2.42, p=0.003). Population-attributable risk percent for 
asthma was about 10%.
CONCLUSIONS—Asthma is an unrecognized risk factor for zoster in adults. Consideration for 
immunizing adults with asthma aged over 50 years as a target group should be given.

Introduction
Herpes zoster (zoster or shingles) is estimated to occur in up to 30% of all adults by age 80 
with nearly 1 million cases a year in the United States. 1,2 The decade of life with the largest 
number of cases is 50 to 59 years, causing significant loss of work and productivity.1 Yawn 
et al reported a rising trend of the incidence of zoster in Olmsted County, Minnesota, over 
time (3.2 to 4.1 per 1,000 person-years between 1996 and 2001).1,3 A prior study completed 
in Olmsted County using comparable data sources and definitions reported the incidence rate 
of 1.3 cases per 1,000 person-years between 1945 and 1959, suggesting an increase greater 
than threefold over the 56 years studied.4 While the reasons for this increase in zoster rates 
are unknown, the introduction of the childhood varicella vaccination (1995) is unlikely to 
account for the rising trends of zoster in our study setting.
Despite the presumed immunosenescence with aging,1,5,6 it is still unclear why some people 
develop zoster while others do not. Almost all (99.2–99.6%) of the United States population 
aged ≥ 40 years have serologic evidence for previous varicella infection and therefore are at 
risk for zoster,5,7 but two-thirds of people will never develop zoster.1 Only 8 to 10% of 
zoster cases have known significant immune suppression potentially suggesting 
unrecognized risk factors.1 In this respect, little is known about the impact of conditions 
with immune dysfunction such as asthma on the risk of developing zoster.
Asthma represents one of the five most burdensome chronic diseases in the US 8 affecting 
7–17% of the US population.8–12 It increases the risk of serious and common microbial 
infections13–19, which might be, in part, accounted for by suboptimal innate and adaptive 
immune functions.20–24 Thus, we recently examined the relationship between asthma and 
the risk of zoster and found a significantly increased risk of zoster among children with 
asthma (adjusted odds ratio: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.24–3.52).25
This population-based study expands our exploration further to assess whether asthma status 
is associated with the risk of zoster in adults. This study provides an important insight into 
the nature of the impact of asthma on the risk of infections because zoster is a unique non-
airway-related latent viral activation in dorsal root ganglia, which is primarily controlled by 
cell-mediated immunity.13,14,16,17

 METHODS
Study setting
Olmsted County, Minnesota, provides unique advantages for population-based 
epidemiologic studies because medical care is virtually self-contained within the 
community. In addition, when patients register with any health care providers in the 
community, they or their parents/legal guardian are asked to grant or refuse authorization of 
use of their medical records for research. Authorization is granted by over 95% of all 
individuals.26 Medical records research using the geographically defined population of 
Olmsted County was possible through the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) which has 
been continuously funded by NIH and maintained since 1960.27–30 Within the REP, 31 each 
patient seen at any health care facility within the county has all diagnosis codes collected 
with health care services and site of service. This study protocol was approved by the IRBs 
at both Mayo Clinic and Olmsted County Medical Center.
Study design
The study was designed as a population-based case-control study, which compared the 
frequency of asthma prior to index date among incident cases of zoster with that among birth 
date (±1 year)-, gender-, initial clinic or hospital registration date, and index-date (±1 year)-
matched corresponding controls (1:2 individual matching) without a history of zoster. Index 
(incident) date for cases was the date of the first zoster diagnosis and for controls was the 
closest clinic visit date (within 1 year) to the index date of corresponding cases.
Case ascertainment
All potential zoster cases (≥ 50 years of age) occurring between January 1, 2010, and 
October 31, 2011were identified from medical records using case ascertainment algorithm 
used for our previous study.32,33 All potential zoster incident cases were identified from a 
broad search of diagnostic codes (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision 
(ICD-9) codes 053.xx) for zoster and zoster complications. Medical records regarding each 
potential incident case were reviewed to verify that the case was indeed a new case of zoster 
based on criteria for zoster. Confirmation required either 1) positive laboratory data 
supported with a Tzanck smear, viral culture, or a positive polymerase chain reaction test for 
zoster virus or 2) clinical criteria used in our previous study: a) a statement of characteristic 
rash (vesicular rash on dermatome) in medical records, b) signs or a statement of pain or 
itching at rash site during interview, and c) a physician diagnosis of zoster in medical record. 
Exclusion criteria included: 1) individuals without research authorization, 2) non-Olmsted 
County, Minnesota, residents, 3) another diagnosis explaining the rash, such as culture 
positive for herpes simplex, and 4) clinical conditions making ascertainment of asthma 
difficult listed in Table 1.
Selection of controls
Two matched controls were randomly selected from the Rochester Epidemiology Project 
(i.e., population-based sampling frame for Olmsted County, MN, residents). The literature 
showed that 99.2–99.6% of the US population aged ≥40 years had serologic evidence for

 previous varicella infection which were quite steady over time (1988–2004)5,7. We did not 
assess serologic evidence for a history of varicella infection in the past for controls.
Determination of exposure status (asthma status)
We applied predetermined criteria for asthma delineated in Table 1, which have been 
extensively used in research for asthma epidemiology and have shown excellent construct 
validity and reliability (0.72–92).13,14,17,18,34,35 As most subjects with probable asthma 
(85%) became definite asthma over time, we combined both probable and definite asthma.36
Other variables
We collected pertinent variables for this study: asthma medication and control status, 
comorbid conditions at the time of index date, other atopic conditions prior to the index date, 
zoster vaccination prior to index date, and proxy measures for health care access (influenza 
vaccination in a preceding year and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination). The 
comorbid conditions examined in this study are listed in Table 2. Other atopic conditions 
were ascertained by a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy 
documented in medical records prior to the index date of zoster. We collected data on 
corticosteroid therapies and asthma control status within six months of index date of zoster. 
We defined poorly controlled asthma as any asthma symptoms documented in medical 
records, systemic corticosteroid therapy for asthma symptoms, unscheduled visits for 
asthma, visit to the emergency department for asthma, or hospitalization for asthma within 
six months prior to index date.37,38
Data analysis
Matched analysis via conditional logistic regression was used, with zoster case status as the 
target of endpoint in the model and asthma status as the primary explanatory variable. In 
each model the matching variables (age, gender, and years since registration) were included, 
as adjusting covariates to control for any residual confounding not prevented by the 
matching. Asthma was carried forward into a multivariable model along with other factors 
screened from univariable modeling using an alpha level of 0.2.39 Atopic dermatitis, allergic 
rhinitis, and food allergy which share similar immunologic characteristics as asthma were 
left out of this model to avoid collinearity, though each was included in separate 
multivariable models (removing asthma) to test the association with zoster. We calculated 
the population attributable risk percent (PAR%) of asthma for zoster.40 We examined a 
differential effect of asthma on the risk of zoster among different age groups by assessing 
statistical significance of interaction term between asthma and age groups. Incidence of 
zoster was estimated among adults in the county during the two-year study time frame, with 
rates adjusted for age and gender by direct standardization against the 2010 US population. 
All analyses were performed with SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
RESULTS
Study subjects
Of the total 475 potential zoster cases identified during the study period, 93 subjects were 
excluded from incidence analyses due to the following reasons: non-Olmsted County

 residents (n=62), no research authorization (n=19), and no physician diagnosis of zoster in 
medical records during the study period (n=12). For analyses pertaining to the relationship 
between asthma and zoster, an additional 10 subjects were excluded due to clinical 
conditions making asthma ascertainment difficult (2 for pulmonary fibrosis, 2 for 
bronchiectasis, 5 for significant decreased pulmonary function defined by FEV1<50% or 
diminished diffusion capacity, and 1 for significant scoliosis) and 1 due to insufficient 
medical record to determine asthma status.
Based on a total of 382 incident cases, the overall age- and gender-adjusted incidence rate of 
zoster during our study period was 4.3 (95% CI, 3.9–4.7) per 1000 person-years. The age-
adjusted sex-specific incidence rates (per 1000 person-years) were 5.3 (95% CI: 4.7–6.0) in 
females and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7–3.8) in males. The sex-adjusted age-specific incidence rates 
were 3.1 (95% CI: 2.6–3.7) in subjects aged 50–59 years, 4.5 (95% CI: 3.7–5.4) in those 
aged 60–69 years, and 5.8 (95% CI: 4.9–6.8) in those aged 70 years or older. The 
characteristics of the zoster cases and their matched controls are summarized in Table 2.
Association between asthma and risk of zoster
We found a significant association between asthma and risk of zoster in our study 
population. The results are summarized in Table 3. Of the 371 zoster cases, 87 (23%) were 
asthmatics, compared to 114 of 744 controls (15%) who had asthma (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 
1.26–2.39; p<0.001). The mean (±SD) age at the onset of asthma was 49.1 (±17.5) years; 
50.4 (± 16.8) in zoster cases and 48.2 (±18.0) in controls. Adjusted for potential confounders 
identified from univariate models (Table 3), the association between asthma and zoster 
remained significant (adjusted OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.20–2.42; p=0.003; PAR% = 9.7%). 
Based on a test of interaction between asthma and age categories of <60 years (n=356), 60–
69 years (n=332), and ≥70 years (n=425), there was no evidence of a differential asthma 
effect across age strata (p=0.978).
Associations of asthma control and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with risk of zoster
Use of ICS was not shown to be a risk factor for zoster in our study population. Among all 
asthmatics of cases and controls (n=201), only 11 (6%) were considered to be poorly 
controlled at the time of zoster assessment, and 62 (31%) had been treated with ICS and/or 
systemic corticosteroids (the dose of ICS was defined by the National Asthma Education 
and Practice Program guidelines): 49 on low-dose ICS (79%), 7 on medium-dose ICS 
(11%), 2 on high-dose ICS (3%), and 4 on high-dose ICS and oral corticosteroid therapy 
(6%). Twenty-five of 87 zoster cases (29%) were treated with ICS, compared to 37 of 114 
controls (32%) (OR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.45–1.54, p=0.547). For active (current) vs. inactive 
asthma status, both inactive asthma (OR: 1.90, 95%CI: 1.21–3.00) and active (current) 
asthma (OR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.07–2.41) were associated with increased risks of zoster 
compared to those without asthma (p=0.003), but there was no difference in the risk of 
zoster between inactive and active asthma (p=0.61). For asthma control status, 6 of 75 zoster 
cases (7%) and 5 of 114 controls (4%) had poorly controlled asthma (OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 
0.44–5.25, p=0.501).

 Association of other factors with risk of zoster
From univariable analyses, the association of zoster was statistically significant for atopic 
dermatitis (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.12–2.61, p=0.013). In separate models that controlled for 
the same adjusting covariates in Table 3, the odds of zoster were significantly higher in 
subjects with atopic dermatitis (adjusted OR, 1.72; 95% CI: 1.09–2.71; p=0.020) than those 
without. With asthma and other atopic conditions (allergic rhinitis and food allergy) 
additionally entered into the model, both asthma (adjusted OR: 1.54, 95%CI: 1.06–2.25; 
p=0.024) and atopic dermatitis (adjusted OR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.03–2.59; p=0.038) were 
independently associated with risk of zoster. We also examined a potential interaction 
between asthma and atopic dermatitis in relation to the impact of asthma on the risk of 
zoster by stratifying the effect of asthma on the risk of zoster by atopic dermatitis status. 
While there was no significant interaction (p=0.287), the impact of asthma on the risk of 
zoster appeared to be greater among patients with atopic dermatitis (OR: 2.73, 95%CI: 1.02–
7.29) than those without atopic dermatitis (OR: 1.55, 95%CI: 1.07–2.26). However, the 
associations of food allergy (p=0.145) and allergic rhinitis (p=0.070) with the risk of zoster 
only approached statistical significance in the multivariate analysis. A history of trauma and 
hematologic malignancy had increased risks of zoster compared to those without such 
conditions. As expected, neither influenza vaccine nor pneumococcal vaccine was associated 
with the risk of zoster, while zoster vaccine was associated with a lower risk of zoster.
DISCUSSION
This population-based study in adults upholds our previous finding on asthma as an 
independent risk factor for zoster in children with asthma. This may also be true for other 
atopic conditions such as atopic dermatitis. The impact of asthma on risk of infection may 
go beyond airways.
The overall age-and gender-adjusted incidence rate of zoster in our study (4.3, 95% CI, 3.9–
4.7, per 1000 person-years) was similar to that in the United States (2.8–4.4 depending on 
study years).41 Our study results corroborated previously reported factors associated with 
the risk of zoster such as female gender, immunocompromised conditions, mechanical 
trauma, and zoster vaccination. 25,42–44
Our study results on the association between asthma and risk of zoster (adjusted OR, 1.70; 
95% CI, 1.20–2.42; p=0.003) are unlikely to be due to a detection bias because all cases 
were population-based incident zoster cases and no significant differences in influenza and 
pneumococcal vaccinations before the index date of zoster between cases and controls as a 
surrogate measure for access to health care were found. Regardless, the estimated effect of 
asthma was adjusted for these variables. No significant differences in access to health care 
services (e.g., general medical examination or evaluation for acute illnesses) between 
individuals with and without a physician diagnosis of asthma were found in our study 
setting.17,45 Susceptibility bias might be an important concern given the relatively older 
population in our study subjects and higher comorbid conditions. To address this concern, 
we adjusted significant comorbid conditions individually, which were associated with the 
risk of zoster as shown in Table 3. Controlling comorbid conditions did not significantly 
change the effect size (1.73 to 1.70). Our study results suggest that there is no evidence of a

 differential impact of asthma across age strata. While both active and inactive asthma were 
associated with the increased risk of zoster, asthma medications and control status did not 
influence the association, and this is consistent with the literature.46 Finally, other atopic 
condition such as atopic dermatitis (adjusted OR, 1.72; 95% CI: 1.09–2.71; p=0.020) was 
associated with risk of zoster, while both allergic rhinitis (adjusted OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.98–
1.74; p=0.070) and food allergy (adjusted OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 0.78–5.38; p=0.145) 
approached statistical significance. When adjusted for atopic dermatitis, asthma was still 
significantly associated with the risk of zoster and there was no significant interaction 
between asthma and atopic dermatitis in relation to the effect of asthma on the risk of zoster. 
These results suggest the impact of asthma on the risk of zoster is independent of atopic 
dermatitis. These results potentially suggest biological coherence with our main study 
findings on the association between asthma and risk of zoster.
The results of this present work are consistent with our previous study results on the 
increased risk of zoster among children with asthma (adjusted OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.24–3.52, 
p=0.006). 25 Recent studies conducted in Spain and England characterized adult patients 
with zoster without a priori hypothesis and showed that asthma was one of the conditions 
associated with an increased risk of zoster.47,48 In addition, previous studies showed 
increased risks of herpes simplex ocular infections 49,50 and eczema herpeticum51 among 
patients with atopic conditions.
The mechanisms underlying the association between asthma and risk of zoster are unknown. 
Waning cell-mediated immunity has been suggested to increase the risk of zoster1,5,6 and 
asthma might play a role in waning of adaptive immunity.19,52 Asthma as a Th2-
predominent condition, which results in reciprocal suppression of Th1 immunity (cell-
mediated immunity), could potentially in part explain the association observed in our 
study.53,54 As viral gene products are needed to establish and maintain latency and host 
responses (T-cell immunity) determine latency vs. reactivation,55 it is important to determine 
how asthma as a host factor influences the interaction between viral gene expression (e.g, 
ORF61 gene for varicella zoster virus) and host-immune response (e.g., interferon α, β, and 
γ).56,57 Impairment in innate immune functions in skin and airways is well documented in 
patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis.15,18,19 Although there is limited information on 
adaptive immune functions in asthmatics, there is some evidence that patients with asthma 
or other atopic conditions may have impairment or incompetence in cell-mediated 
immunity.19,21,58
Clinicians and patients need to be aware that a history of asthma and atopic dermatitis might 
be unrecognized risk factors for zoster in both adults and children, although the underlying 
mechanisms are unknown. Neither asthma-related medications such as corticosteroids nor 
asthma control status affected the risk of zoster, although statistical power might be limited 
to address these associations. Given the large proportion of adults affected by asthma and 
availability of effective vaccine preventing zoster, consideration for immunizing adults with 
asthma or atopic dermatitis over 50 years or older as a target group for zoster vaccine should 
be given.

 The main strength of the study is a population-based study design, which is based on 
incident zoster cases, minimizing misclassification as reflected in the similar incidence rate 
of zoster at the national level. Another important strength is epidemiologic advantages of our 
study setting with self-contained health care environment and the availability of all medical 
records for study subjects under the REP. Also, we used predetermined criteria for asthma 
(instead of self-report or ICD-9 codes), which were extensively used for previous 
epidemiologic investigations for the association between asthma and risk of various 
microbial infections relating our current results to our previous research work ensuring 
consistency and coherence.
Our study has limitations. Even if our study setting is self-contained and case identification 
was based on incident cases, we might have missed some zoster cases, thereby the incidence 
of zoster could be underestimated. However, the incidence estimate in our study was similar 
to that at the national level. Secondly, the study subjects were predominantly a Caucasian 
population, which might limit generalizability of our results to other ethnic groups or study 
settings. In addition to the comparable incidence rates of zoster in our study setting to that at 
the national level, our study results corroborated previously reported risk factors for zoster, 
suggesting suitability of our study subjects and setting in addressing the study question. 
Thirdly, asthma control status (i.e., poorly controlled asthma) was ascertained based on 
medical chart review resulting in the possibility of missing some asthma symptoms and/or 
administration of asthma medications unless they visited the clinic, ER, or were hospitalized 
for asthma and the use of asthma medications was documented in the medical record. 
Finally, our study subjects were a relatively older population (mostly born in 1940s when 
asthma incidence was low59,60) and thus, comorbid conditions might be a significant 
confounder and the relationship between asthma and risk of zoster might vary across age 
strata. The association between asthma and risk of zoster was adjusted for significant 
comorbid conditions, and there was not a differential impact of asthma across different age 
strata. Apart from this concern, a potential misclassification of COPD as asthma, we limited 
our analysis to subjects without a history of smoking. Asthma status was still significantly 
associated with the risk of zoster (adjusted OR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.00–2.57, p=0.048).
In conclusion, asthma might be an unrecognized risk factor for zoster in adults and the 
impact of asthma on risk of microbial infections or immune dysfunction may go beyond 
airways. This may be true for atopic dermatitis. Consideration for immunizing adults with 
asthma or atopic dermatitis over 50 years or older as a target group for zoster vaccine should 
be given.

Table 1
Definition of asthma
Patients were considered to have definite asthma if a physician had made a diagnosis of asthma and/or if each of the following three conditions 
were present, and they were considered to have probable asthma if only the first two conditions were present:
1
History of cough with wheezing, and/or dyspnea, OR history of cough and/or dyspnea plus wheezing on examination,
2
Substantial variability in symptoms from time to time or periods of weeks or more when symptoms were absent, and
3
Two or more of the following:
•
Sleep disturbance by nocturnal cough and wheeze
•
Nonsmoker
•
Nasal polyps
•
Blood eosinophilia higher than 300/uL
•
Positive wheal and flare skin tests OR elevated serum IgE
•
History of hay fever or infantile eczema OR cough, dyspnea, and wheezing regularly on exposure to an antigen
•
Pulmonary function tests showing one FEV1 or FVC less than 70% predicted and another with at least 20% improvement 
to an FEV1 of higher 70% predicted OR methacholine challenge test showing 20% or greater decrease in FEV1
•
Favorable clinical response to bronchodilator
Patients were excluded from the study if any of these conditions were present:
•
Pulmonary function tests that showed FEV1 to be consistently below 50% predicted or diminished diffusion capacity
•
Tracheobronchial foreign body at or about the incidence date
•
Hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG less than 2.0 mg/mL) or other immunodeficiency disorder
•
Wheezing occurring only in response to anesthesia or medications
•
Bullous emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis on chest radiograph
•
PiZZ alpha1-antitrypsin
•
Cystic fibrosis
•
Other major chest disease such as juvenile kyphoscoliosis or bronchiectasis FVC forced vital capacity; FEV1, forced expiratory 
volume in 1 sec.
