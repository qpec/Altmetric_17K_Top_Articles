Stress plays a critical role in the neurobiology of mood and anxiety disorders. Sleep and circadian rhythms are affected in many of these
conditions. Here we examined the effects of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), an ethological form of stress, on sleep and circadian
rhythms. We exposed male mice implanted with wireless telemetry transmitters to a 10 day CSDS regimen known to produce anhedonia
(a depressive-like effect) and social avoidance (an anxiety-like effect). EEG, EMG, body temperature, and locomotor activity data were
collected continuously during the CSDS regimen and a 5 day recovery period. CSDS affected numerous endpoints, including paradoxical
sleep(PS)andslow-wavesleep(SWS),aswellasthecircadianrhythmicityofbodytemperatureandlocomotoractivity.Themagnitudeof

effects on both sleep and circadian rhythms, or hastened their recovery, and attenuated changes in mPer2. Our findings show that CSDS
produces persistent disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythmicity, mimicking attributes of stress-related conditions as they appear in
humans. The ability of KOR antagonists to mitigate these disruptions is consistent with previously reported antistress effects. Studying
homologous endpoints across species may facilitate the development of improved treatments for psychiatric illness.

Introduction
Stress plays a prominent role in the etiology and pathophysiology
of psychiatric illness. One domain that is consistently dysregu-
lated in many of these illnesses is circadian function, including
regulation of sleep (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). In
individuals with mood and anxiety disorders (e.g., major depres-
sive disorder [MDD], generalized anxiety, post-traumatic stress
disorder), this can manifest as increased or decreased sleep, frag-
mented sleep patterns that reflect more frequent bouts of sleep
and wakefulness, and/or arrhythmic activity or physiology. There
is considerable evidence in the literature that stress disrupts sleep

Significance Statement
Stress plays a critical role in the neurobiology of mood and anxiety disorders. We show that chronic social defeat stress in mice
produces progressive alterations in sleep and circadian rhythms that resemble features of depression as it appears in humans.
Whereas some of these alterations recover quickly upon cessation of stress, others persist. Administration of a kappa-opioid
receptor(KOR)antagonistreducedstresseffectsorhastenedrecovery,consistentwiththepreviouslyreportedantistresseffectsof

 in people (Ross et al., 1989) and laboratory animals (Pawlyk et al.,
2008), although the neural mechanisms of these effects are not
thoroughly understood. A better understanding of these mecha-
nisms may facilitate the development of approaches to treat or
prevent the effects of stress on sleep, which patients find particu-
larly debilitating.
One method to study the effects of acute and chronic stress in
mice is the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm. This
technique involves an ethological form of stress related to terri-
torial aggression in mice (Golden et al., 2011) and has numerous
advantages for understanding the ways in which behavioral and
molecular adaptations develop over time in response to stressful
experiences. One advantage is that key behavioral endpoints that
are altered by CSDS (e.g., social interaction) are sensitive to
chronic but not acute treatment with standard antidepressants
(Berton et al., 2006) and acute treatment with ketamine (Dona-
hue et al., 2014), both of which resemble the time courses of
therapeutic drug actions in humans (Zarate et al., 2006). In ad-
dition, CSDS can reveal separate “susceptible” and “resilient”
populations, potentially modeling individual differences in stress
susceptibility in humans (Krishnan et al., 2007). Importantly,
CSDS effects can endure beyond termination of the stressor
(Donahue et al., 2014), making it a particularly appealing method
with which to study some of the persistent characteristics of stress-
related psychiatric illnesses as they occur in clinical settings.
Seminal studies of CSDS-induced adaptations have examined
endpoints after a CSDS regimen. For example, a 10 day CSDS
regimen produces avoidance behaviors in social interaction tests
conducted the day after the final defeat session (Berton et al.,
2006). We have used the intracranial self-stimulation test to track
the development of day-by-day adaptations in behavior over 10 d
of CSDS (Donahue et al., 2014, 2015). These studies demonstrate
that CSDS produces gradual, rather than all-or-none, increases in
the emergence of anhedonia (reduced sensitivity to reward), a core
feature of depressive disorders, and that these effects are persistent
(Donahueetal.,2014).Theabilitytopreciselyfollowthetimecourse
over which anhedonia and other signs develop and recover may
provide deeper insight into susceptibility and resilience to stress, as
wellasfundamentalrelationshipsbetweenbehavioralandmolecular
adaptations triggered by stress exposure.
The primary purpose of the present work is to develop a de-
tailed understanding of the time course over which CSDS
produces alterations in sleep and circadian rhythm, and the per-
sistence of these effects. We used a wireless telemetry system in-
volving an implantable subcutaneous transmitter that enables
free, untethered movement in mice and analysis of endpoints,
including EEG, EMG, body temperature, and locomotor activity.
The transmitters provide continuous telemetry, enabling real-
time measurement of sleep and circadian rhythms during base-
line, stress exposure, and recovery periods. We also quantified
expression of a gene (mPer2) often used as a readout of circadian
rhythmicity (Welsh et al., 2010) and implicated in anxiety (Spen-
cer et al., 2013) to confirm that molecular adaptations occur in
parallel to behavioral adaptations. Finally, because there is
accumulating evidence from our laboratory and others that
�-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonists can attenuate and/or
prevent the effects of stress (Pliakas et al., 2001; Beardsley et
al., 2005; Knoll et al., 2007; Carlezon and Krystal, 2016), we
examined in a subset of mice whether pretreatment with a
long-lasting KOR antagonist (JDTic) would also mitigate
CSDS effects on these endpoints.
Materials and Methods
Animals. Male C57BL/6J mice (6–8 weeks old; The Jackson Laboratory)
were pair-housed upon arrival and then individually housed following
surgery �1 week later. Mice were maintained in a temperature- and
humidity-controlled vivarium under a 12 h light/dark (9:00 A.M./9:00
P.M.) cycle. CD1 male mice (retired breeders; Charles River Laborato-
ries) served as aggressors during CSDS and were individually housed in
the same vivarium for the duration of the experiment. Food and water
were available ad libitum. The housing and treatment of experimental
animals were approved by the McLean Hospital Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee and followed guidelines set by the National
Institutes of Health.
Surgery. The C57BL/6J (“target”) mice were anesthetized with intra-
peritoneal injections of ketamine/xylazine (80/10 mg/kg) and implanted
with wireless PhysioTel F20-EET (Data Sciences International) biote-
lemetry transmitters. Surgical procedures followed specifications pro-
vided by the manufacturer. Briefly, mice were placed into a stereotaxic
instrument. The transmitter was inserted into a subcutaneous pocket on
the back, just lateral to the spine and approximately midway between the
neck and hind legs. Next, two surface EEG electrodes (biopotential leads
tethered to miniature stainless-steel screws) were implanted over the left
frontal lobe (Site 1: anteroposterior 1.0 mm, mediolateral 1.00 mm, rel-
ative to bregma) and the contralateral parietal lobe (Site 2: anteroposte-
rior �3.0 mm, mediolateral �3.00 mm, relative to bregma) and lowered
until they made contact with dura. These coordinates have been shown to
permit long-term, stable EEG recordings in mice (Tang and Sanford,
2002). Electrodes were secured in place with dental cement. Then, two
biopotential leads (EMG electrodes) were inserted through small inci-
sions made using a 21 G needle in the cervical trapezius muscle and
secured with nondissolvable silk sutures. The incision site was closed
with silk sutures and treated with a local anesthetic (2% lidocaine) and a
topical antibiotic (triple antibiotic ointment). Mice were given 14 d of
postoperative recovery before measurement of baseline physiological
metrics began.
Physiological recordings (EEG, EMG, body temperature, motor activity).
Target mice were individually housed following surgery in standard
Plexiglas home cages placed on RPC-1 PhysioTel receivers (DSI), which
detect signals from the transmitters. Receivers are connected to a data
exchange matrix (DSI), which relays continuous and simultaneous EEG,
EMG, motor activity, and body temperature signals to a computer
equipped with Dataquest ART Platinum (DSI). EEG data were analyzed
in Neuroscore (DSI). Vigilance states, including active wakefulness
(AW), slow-wave sleep (SWS), and paradoxical sleep (PS), were assigned
to each 10 s epoch using an automated scoring algorithm in Neuroscore
that uses established relationships between power and activity to classify
waveforms into particular vigilance states (Table 1).
Vigilance state durations (time in minutes) and bouts (number of
discrete episodes) were calculated for 1 h, 1 d, or 10 d blocks. Addition-
ally, for each vigilance state, spectral power was quantified from the raw
EEG signal using a multitaper method. Analysis was run using a custom
MATLAB script (Pfizer) using the Chronux toolbox. The frequency
bands used were defined as follows: delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–12 Hz),
low gamma (30–58 Hz), and high gamma (62–100 Hz). Power analyses
were performed for baseline day 5 (i.e., the day preceding the onset of
CSDS), defeat day 1, and defeat day 10. The amplitude of body temper-
ature and motor activity rhythms was calculated using CLOCKLAB. All
data are expressed as a percentage of baseline.
Drugs. JDTic (Research Triangle Institute) was dissolved in 0.9% sa-
line for a final concentration of 30 mg/kg. This dose of JDTic has previ-
ously been shown to block corticotropin-releasing factor-enhanced

 startle (an anxiogenic-like reflexive behavior) in mice (Van’t Veer et al.,
2013b). JDTic or vehicle (0.9% saline) was administered intraperitone-
ally on baseline day 4 to accommodate the delayed increase in KOR
selectivity following JDTic administration (�24 h post-injection; Carroll
et al., 2004).
CSDS. Following postoperative recovery, baseline physiological re-
cordings were obtained for 5 consecutive days. Thereafter, mice were
randomly assigned to receive either CSDS or control conditions; in Ex-
periment 2, cohorts of mice received vehicle or JDTic before the stress
regimen began. Our CSDS procedure has been described in detail
(Golden et al., 2011; Donahue et al., 2014). Briefly, for 10 consecutive
days, at zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 (9:00 A.M.), C57BL/6J mice were placed for
10 min into the homecage of novel resident CD1 mice that had been
previously screened for aggressive behavior. This reliably elicits high lev-
els of territorial aggression in the CD1 mouse that is directed at the
C57BL/6J mouse. Following this physical interaction period, a perforated
Plexiglas partition was inserted in the cage to separate the mice while still
allowing for continuous, protected sensory exposure. The procedure was
repeated for 10 d, using a new CD1 resident mouse each day to maintain
high levels of aggression. Control mice were handled and pair-housed
opposite a new conspecific C57BL/6J mouse on each day but in the
absence of direct physical interaction.
Social interaction (SI) test and division of mice into susceptible and resil-
ient subpopulations. Social avoidance is a key symptom of depressive
disorders, and previous work has shown that CSDS produces this behav-
ior in defeated mice (Golden et al., 2011; Donahue et al., 2014). Impor-
tantly, this behavioral endpoint can reveal subgroups of mice that are
stress-susceptible or resilient (Berton et al., 2006; Krishnan et al., 2007).
We performed an initial set of studies (Experiment 1) to confirm that the
transmitters and EEG/EMG assemblies were sufficiently durable to sur-
vive the 10 day CSDS procedure, and to determine whether the basic
characteristics of social interaction behavior were normal in mice im-
planted with the subcutaneous transmitters. Mice were habituated to a
social interaction arena (42 � 42 � 42 cm) for 20 min immediately after
the social defeat session on defeat days 9 and 10; this minor modification
of a more widely used procedure (Golden et al., 2011) produces more
reliable social avoidance behavior under our testing conditions (Dona-
hue et al., 2014, 2015). SI was assessed on the day following the last CSDS
session, as described previously (Donahue et al., 2014). SI scores were
calculated as the amount of time spent near a social target compared with
time spent near an empty enclosure. In previous studies, an SI score of 1
has been used as an index to quantify stress susceptibility (SI � 1, stress-
susceptible; SI � 1, stress-resilient) after CSDS (Krishnan et al., 2007).
These same studies indicated that CSDS reduces the amplitude of circa-
dian rhythm of body temperature in susceptible but not resilient mice,
offering a secondary biomarker with which to differentiate these pheno-
types. Because we found that SI scores were similar in both groups, rais-
ing the possibility that the presence of the subcutaneous transmitter
changes the fundamental microstructure of social interaction behavior,
we instead focused on temperature amplitude, and performed a median
split of the temperature amplitude during CSDS, expressed as a percent-
age of the baseline value to classify mice as susceptible (� median) or
resilient (� median). Data from Experiment 1 confirmed that the exis-
tence of two nonoverlapping subpopulations of defeated mice: those
with blunted temperature amplitude (susceptible) and those with negli-
gible changes (resilient). As such, we also used this median-split ap-
proach to segregate the mice for subsequent studies (Experiment 2),
which did not include SI tests.
qRT-PCR. To confirm that CSDS causes alterations in cellular path-
ways known to regulate circadian rhythms, a subset of mice (N � 6 or 7
per group) were killed on postdefeat day 5 at ZT1 via cervical dislocation,
and brains were rapidly removed, flash frozen in ice-cold isopentane, and
stored at �80°C. Brains were sectioned on a cryostat, and 19 Ga tissue
punches were taken from the VTA, amygdala (AMG; basolateral nuclei),
NAc (comprising the shell and core subregions), and medial PFC (com-
prising the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices); 30 �m sections from each
region were then mounted on slides to document the location and quality
of the dissection. RNA was extracted using GeneJET RNA Purification
Kit (Thermo Scientific), and quantity and quality were evaluated using a
NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). cDNA was
generated from 100 ng of RNA with the SuperScript III First-Strand
Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). The forward (GAGTGTGTGCAGCGGCT-
TAG) and reverse (GTAGGGTGTCATGCGGAAGG) primers for mPer2
were chosen based on previous work (Spencer et al., 2013).
In a mixture with 2� SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad), qRT-PCR was run on the CFX Connect Real-Time System
(Bio-Rad) in a volume of 20 �l, with 0.2 �l of forward and reverse
primers (100 ng/�l each) and 1.0 �l cDNA sample. PCR cycling condi-
tions were as follows: 95°C for 30 s, 60 cycles at 95°C for 15 s each, 55°C
for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. Data were collected at a read temperature of
72°C, based on a melt curve of 65°–95°C, increased in increments of
0.5°C for 5 s each.
Statistical analyses. Analyses were performed using SPSS. SI scores
(time near social target/time spent near an empty enclosure) in defeated
mice and in controls were directly compared using Student’s t tests. Total
time in interaction zone, center time, corner time, number of entries into
and latency to enter the interaction zone, and distance traveled were
analyzed using two-way ANOVAs with repeated measures, where trial
(empty enclosure or social target present) was the within-subjects factor
and group (Control or Defeat) was the between-subjects factor. Data
quantifying sleep, qEEG, and circadian rhythmicity analyzed using two-
way ANOVAs with repeated measures where appropriate. Effects on
mRNA levels across brain regions were analyzed using a three-way
ANOVA with repeated measures. Significant effects were further exam-
ined with Bonferroni’s post hoc tests. The effects of JDTic on the rate of
change in PS bouts during CSDS and recovery were evaluated using
separate linear regression analyses for vehicle- and JDTic-treated mice on
defeat days 1–5, defeat days 6–10, and postdefeat days 1–5, and the
standardized �-coefficient for the slope of each line was compared with 0
(indicative of no change).
Results
Feasibility of CSDS in mice with subcutaneous transmitters
In Experiment 1, we assessed the feasibility of conducting CSDS
in mice implanted with subcutaneous transmitters using three
endpoints: SI, circadian rhythm of body temperature, and motor
activity. EEG/EMG signals were not analyzed in detail because the
SI procedure (two habituation sessions plus the test) interrupted
the light/inactive phase, producing potentially confounding ef-
fects. Under our experimental conditions, CSDS did not produce
social avoidance in defeated mice. Time spent in the interaction
zone in the presence versus absence of a social target depended on
a main effect of trial only (F(1,13) � 11.87, p � 0.004). Both groups
spent more time in the interaction zone when the enclosure con-
tained a social target than when it was empty (Fig. 1A). Both
groups also had similar SI scores (Fig. 1C), and the distribution
was unimodal rather than bimodal (Krishnan et al., 2007) (Fig.
1D). There were no group differences in distance traveled, corner
time, or the number of entries into or latency to enter the inter-
action zone (data not shown). However, time spent in the center
of the interaction arena depended on a trial � group interaction
(F(1,13) � 4.81, p � 0.047) (Fig. 1C), with defeated mice spending
less time in the center of the arena when the social target was
present (Bonferroni, p � 0.01). While the differences in center
time confirm the efficacy of the CSDS, the absence of social
avoidance precludes the use of this typical endpoint to subclassify
mice as stress-susceptible and stress-resilient (Krishnan et al.,
2007), and suggests that the presence of the subcutaneous trans-
mitters can affect this method of quantifying social interaction
behavior. Instead, we examined the amplitude of body tempera-
ture rhythms as an alternate index of stress susceptibility (see
below).
CSDS disrupted circadian rhythm of motor activity. While
bouts of activity were highly entrained to light/dark cues in both
groups during baseline, CSDS caused a rapid disorganization of

 these patterns in defeated mice (Fig. 1E). Disruption of activity
was also seen in control mice near the end of the 10 day CSDS
regimen, a time at which all mice were being habituated to the
social interaction chambers. Comparison of mean hourly activity
counts on baseline day 5 and defeat day 10 revealed that ampli-
tude was impaired in defeated mice, but not in controls (Fig. 1F).
In controls, activity depended on a main effect of time (hour)
(F(23,230) � 8.30, p � 0.001), consistent with circadian oscillations
in activity, whereas it depended on an hour � day interaction
(F(23,368) � 3.78, p � 0.001) in defeated mice. On day 10, the
amplitude of motor activity rhythm was reduced in defeated mice
at ZT12-ZT14, ZT16-ZT17, and ZT20 (p values �0.05–0.01),
indicating a general blunting of the rhythm. Collapsed across all
days of the CSDS regimen, activity amplitude tended to be lower
in defeated mice (t(13) � 1.87, p � 0.08) but did not reach statis-
tical significance (data not shown). CSDS had qualitatively sim-
ilar effects on circadian rhythm of body temperature. In controls,
body temperature depended on an hour � day interaction
(F(23,230) � 2.20, p � 0.002) (Fig. 1G) but differed between base-
line day 5 and defeat day 10 only during ZT7 (p � 0.05). In
defeated mice, body temperature depended on an hour � day
interaction (F(23,368) � 4.20, p � 0.001), with an increase at ZT2
and ZT3 and reductions at ZT7, ZT11-ZT14, ZT16-ZT17, and
ZT20 on day 10 (p values �0.05–0.01), indicating a general
blunting of the daily rhythm. Collapsed across the CSDS regimen,
temperature amplitude was significantly lower in defeated mice
(t(13) � 1.85, p � 0.04) (data not shown). Given these group
differences, we used temperature amplitude to classify defeated
mice into susceptible and resilient groups in Experiment 2.
Effects of CSDS on circadian amplitude
In Experiment 2, we used new cohorts of mice to examine the
persistence of CSDS effects during a 5 day postdefeat (recovery)
period without the potentially confounding effects of the SI test.
As in Experiment 1, CSDS disrupted the circadian rhythmicity of
both body temperature and motor activity. Temperature ampli-
tude depended on a phase � group interaction (F(2,38) � 5.52,
p � 0.008) (Fig. 2A); amplitude was reduced relative to baseline
during the CSDS regimen in both controls and defeated mice
(p values �0.01), likely reflecting the change from single housing

 to cohousing, repeated sleep deprivation related to the testing
procedures, or a combination of both. This reduction normalized
in controls but persisted in defeated mice during the recovery
period (p � 0.05) upon removal of the stressor. Temperature
amplitude was lower in defeated mice than in controls during the
CSDS (p � 0.01) and recovery (p � 0.05) periods. Circadian
amplitude of motor activity also depended on a phase � group
interaction (F(2,38) � 12.66, p � 0.001) (Fig. 2B): amplitude was
reduced relative to baseline during the CSDS regimen in both
controls and defeated mice (p values �0.01). Unlike core body
temperature amplitude, the mean reductions in motor activity
amplitude persisted in both controls and defeated mice during
the recovery period (p values �0.01). Importantly, however, mo-
tor activity amplitude was lower in defeated mice during the
CSDS and recovery periods (p values �0.01).
Effects of CSDS on sleep and wakefulness
CSDS produced dramatic alterations in sleep architecture, some
of which endured throughout the recovery period. The effects of
CSDS on time spent in PS, akin to rapid eye movement (REM)
sleep but lacking electrooculographic measurements, depended
on a phase � group interaction (F(2,38) � 6.67, p � 0.003) (Fig.
3A). The mean PS time never differed from baseline in controls,
whereas it was significantly elevated in defeated mice during the
CSDS regimen (p � 0.01), before normalizing during the recov-
ery period. PS times were higher in defeated mice than in controls
during the CSDS regimen (p � 0.01) but not the recovery period.
The time course of mean PS times across the 20 d of the experi-
ment depended on a day � group interaction (F(19,361) � 3.48,
p � 0.001) (Fig. 3B). PS times were higher in defeated mice on
CSDS days 4–7 and day 9, compared with controls (p values
�0.05–0.01). The effects of CSDS on the mean number of PS
bouts also depended on a phase � group interaction (F(2,38) �
7.657, p � 0.002) (Fig. 3C). The mean number of PS bouts never
differed from baseline in controls, whereas it was higher in de-
feated mice during CSDS (p � 0.01) and remained elevated
through the recovery period (p � 0.05). The mean number of PS
bouts was higher in defeated mice than in controls during the
CSDS regimen (p � 0.01) but not the recovery period. The time
course of the mean daily number of PS bouts depended on a
day � group interaction (F(19,361) � 4.706, p � 0.001) (Fig. 3D).
The number of bouts was higher in defeated mice on all days of
the CSDS regimen and recovery days 4–5 (p values �0.05–0.01).
Similarly, the effects of CSDS on time spent in SWS, a type of
non-REM sleep characterized by a predominance of low-
frequency delta waves, depended on a phase � group interaction
(F(2,38) � 5.06, p � 0.011) (Fig. 4A). Mean time SWS times never
differed from baseline in controls, whereas they were significantly
higher in defeated mice during the CSDS regimen (p � 0.01) and
the recovery period (p � 0.05). SWS times were higher in de-
feated mice than in controls during the CSDS regimen (p � 0.01)
but not the recovery period. The time course of mean SWS times
depended on a day � group interaction (F(19,361) � 2.437, p �
0.001) (Fig. 4B). SWS times were higher in defeated mice on
CSDS days 1–4, 6, and 8, but not during recovery, compared with
controls (p values �0.05–0.01). Interestingly, CSDS failed to
cause corresponding changes in the number of SWS bouts, which
depended on a main effect of phase only (F(2,38) � 35.349, p �
0.001) (Fig. 4C). Both control and defeated mice showed in-
creases in SWS bouts during the CSDS regimen (p � 0.01),
suggestive of a general effect related to the initial transition from
single to group housing and/or sleep deprivation related to the
testing procedures, with no differences during recovery. The time
course of mean daily number of SWS bouts depended on a main
effect of day only (F(19,361) � 14.19, p � 0.001) (Fig. 4D), with no
group differences at any point.
Accompanying CSDS-induced increases in sleep were corre-
sponding decreases in wakefulness. CSDS did not affect quiet
wakefulness time or bouts (data not shown), whereas effects on
time spent in AW depended on a phase � group interaction
(F(2,38) � 5.80, p � 0.006) (Fig. 5A). Mean AW times never
changed in controls, whereas they were significantly reduced in
defeated mice during CSDS (p � 0.01), with no deviation from
baseline in either group during the recovery period. AW times
were lower in defeated mice than in controls during the CSDS
regimen (p � 0.01) but not the recovery period. The time course
of mean AW times depended on a day � group interaction
(F(19,361) � 3.715, p � 0.001) (Fig. 5B). AW times were lower on
baseline day 3, CSDS days 1–2, 4–7, and 9, compared with con-
trols (p values �0.05–0.01). Despite changes in AW time, CSDS
did not affect the number of AW bouts (Fig. 5C,D).
To determine whether CSDS altered latencies to enter PS,
SWS, or AW, we identified time to the first bout of each vigilance
state on baseline day 5, CSDS days 1, 5, and 10, and postdefeat day
5 (i.e., recovery). Change from baseline latency was calculated as
latency � baseline day 5 latency (seconds). Because the daily
CSDS sessions occurred during the light phase, latencies were
calculated for the dark phase only (Table 2). In general, latencies
to PS were decreased throughout CSDS and into the recovery
period in both defeated mice and controls, suggestive of a general
effect related to the transition from single to group housing
and/or sleep deprivation related to the testing procedures. How-
ever, latency to PS also depended on a day � group interaction
(F(3,36) � 2.990, p � 0.044). Latencies to PS were significantly
shorter in defeated mice than in controls on day 10 (p � 0.05) but
normalized during recovery. In contrast, latencies to SWS never
differed between defeated and control mice at any time point.
Similar to PS, latency to AW depended on a day � group inter-
action (F(3,36) � 4.794, p � 0.017). Latencies to the first bout of
AW were higher in defeated mice than in controls on day 10 (p �
0.05) but normalized during recovery.

Wells et al. • Social Defeat Stress Effect on Sleep
 Effects of acute and chronic SDS on qEEG power spectra
Using a multitaper analysis, we derived the relative power of the
following frequency bands: delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–12 Hz),
low gamma (30–58 Hz), and high gamma (62–100 Hz) separately
for each vigilance state. These bands are reportedly dysregulated
in human depression (Steiger and Kimura, 2010) and in labora-
tory animals exposed to stress (Nedelcovych et al., 2015). Analy-
ses focused on baseline day 5, defeat day 1, and defeat day 10.
CSDS effects on delta power during PS depended on a day �
group interaction (F(2,34) � 3.67, p � 0.036) (Fig. 6A). Delta
power did not change from baseline in controls, whereas it was
higher on day 1 of CSDS in defeated mice, compared with base-
line (p � 0.01) and controls (p � 0.05). There were no differ-
ences by defeat day 10. Effects on theta power depended on a
main effect of group only (F(1,16) � 8.73, p � 0.009), indicating
that theta power during PS was higher in defeated mice than in
controls, regardless of day (p � 0.01).
Thus, whereas the increase in delta power
was rapid but transient, the increase in
theta was both rapid and stable through-
out the CSDS regimen. CSDS did not af-
fect low or high gamma power during PS.
The CSDS procedure produced qualita-
tively different effects on qEEG power
during SWS (Fig. 6B). Effects on delta
power depended on a significant main ef-
fect of day only (F(2,38) � 4.34, p � 0.02),
indicating that both groups exhibited in-
creases in delta power on defeat day 1
(p � 0.01) but not defeat day 10, sugges-
tive of a general effect related to the initial
transition from single to group housing or
sleep deprivation related to the testing
procedures. Effects on theta power de-
pended on a day � group interaction
(F(2,38) � 4.32, p � 0.02). Theta power
never deviated from baseline in controls
but was significantly increased in defeated
mice on defeat day 1 (p � 0.05). Although
neither group differed from baseline on
defeat day 10, theta power was signifi-
cantly lower in defeated mice than in con-
trols (p � 0.05), opposite to the pattern
observed during PS. CSDS did not affect
low gamma, but effects on high gamma
depended on a main effect of day (F(2,38) �
7.82, p � 0.001), with power increased in
both groups on both day 1 (p � 0.05) and
day 10 (p � 0.01), likely reflecting the
transition to group housing and/or
sleep deprivation related to testing. The
CSDS procedure affected all power
bands during AW (Fig. 6C). Effects on
delta power depended on a main effect
of day only (F(2,38) � 6.54, p � 0.004),
with increases in both groups relative to
baseline on day 1 (p � 0.01), which nor-
malized by day 10. Likewise, effects on
theta power depended on a main effect
of day only (F(2,38) � 12.39, p � 0.001),
with increases in both groups relative to
baseline on day 1 (p � 0.01), and sub-
sequent normalization by day 10. Effects
on low gamma power depended on a day � group interaction
(F(2,38) � 4.76, p � 0.014). Low gamma power was higher than
baseline in controls on day 1 (p � 0.01) but not day 10,
whereas it was lower than baseline in defeated mice on day 10
(p � 0.05). Relative to controls, low gamma power was re-
duced in defeated mice on day 1 (p � 0.01) and day 10 (p �
0.05). Effects on high gamma power depended on a day �
group interaction (F(2,38) � 5.07, p � 0.011). High gamma
power was higher than baseline in controls on day 1 (p �
0.01), but not by day 10 and was unchanged in defeated mice.
High gamma power was higher in controls than in defeated
mice on day 1 (p � 0.01) but not day 10. Overall, CSDS
produced visible alterations in qEEG spectrograms (Fig. 6D),
which in defeated mice are indicated by a flattening of the
normal circadian rhythmicity of spectral power during both
sleep and wakefulness.

 Circadian and sleep effects of CSDS in
susceptible and resilient mice
We used a median split of deviation of
body temperature amplitude from base-
line during the recovery period to divide
mice from Experiment 2 susceptible and
resilient subpopulations (i.e., � me-
dian � susceptible; � median � resilient)
(Fig. 7A) and reanalyzed sleep and circa-
dian endpoints using these new group
classifications. We report here only analy-
ses exposing differential effects in resilient
and susceptible mice. Time spent in PS
depended on a phase � group interaction
(F(4,36) � 4.10, p � 0.008) (Fig. 7B). Rela-
tive to baseline, PS times increased during
CSDS in both resilient mice and suscepti-
ble mice (p values �0.01), but this effect
persisted through recovery only in suscep-
tible mice (p � 0.05). Additionally, only
susceptible mice differed from controls
during CSDS (p values �0.05), with no
differences during recovery. PS bouts de-
pended a phase � group interaction
(F(4,36) � 4.19, p � 0.007) (Fig. 7C). The
number of PS bouts never differed from
baseline in controls but was increased
in both resilient and susceptible mice dur-
ing CSDS, relative to baseline (p values
�0.01) and controls (p values �0.01). PS
bouts remained significantly elevated only
in susceptible mice, relative to baseline
(p � 0.05). Circadian rhythms of body
temperature and motor activity were also
differentially altered in susceptible and
resilient mice. The effects of CSDS on
temperature amplitude depended on a
phase
�
subpopulation
interaction
(F(4,36) � 5.623, p � 0.001) (Fig. 7D); rel-
ative to baseline, temperature amplitude
was reduced during CSDS in all groups
(p values �0.01), likely reflecting the
transition from single to group housing
sleep deprivation related to the testing
procedures. This effect persisted through
the recovery period only in susceptible
mice (p � 0.01). Similarly, relative to con-
trols, temperature amplitude was lower in both defeated sub-
populations (p values �0.05) but persisted through recovery
only in susceptible mice (p �0.01). Circadian amplitude of mo-
tor activity also depended on a phase � subpopulation interac-
tion (F(4,36) � 6.302, p � 0.001) (Fig. 7E): relative to baseline,
activity amplitude was reduced during CSDS and during recovery
in all groups (p values �0.01) and persisted through recovery
only in susceptible mice (p �0.01). Similarly, relative to controls,
activity amplitude was lower during CSDS in both resilient and
susceptible mice (p values �0.01) but persisted through recovery
only in susceptible mice (p � 0.01).
Effects of JDTic pretreatment on the effects of CSDS
Because pretreatment with KOR antagonists can prevent stress
effects (Van’t Veer and Carlezon, 2013; Carlezon and Krystal,
2016), we examined whether treatment with the long-lasting
KOR antagonist JDTic before the onset of the CSDS paradigm
would mitigate disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythm. Anal-
yses focused on baseline day 5, defeat day 5, defeat day 10, and
postdefeat day 5. Of the metrics examined, two were sensitive to
JDTic pretreatment: PS bouts and circadian rhythmicity of body
temperature. Effects of CDSD on PS bouts depended on a day �
treatment interaction (F(3,54) � 3.60, p � 0.019) (Fig. 8A). Rela-
tive to baseline, the number of PS bouts were significantly ele-
vated in vehicle-treated defeated mice on days 5 and 10 (p values
�0.01), with nominal increases on postdefeat day 5 that did not
reach statistical significance. In contrast, PS bouts never deviated
from baseline in JDTic-treated defeated mice. Relative to vehicle-
treated controls, the number of PS sleep bouts was lower in
JDTic-treated mice on defeat day 5 (p � 0.01) and postdefeat day
5 (p � 0.05), suggesting that JDTic pretreatment attenuated the
development of changes in this metric and hastened recovery. To

 examine whether JDTic affected the rate
at which this change in PS bouts devel-
oped or recovered, we performed linear
regression analyses on the periods of de-
feat days 1–5, defeat days 6–10, and post-
defeat days 1–5, and used the standardized
�-coefficient of each regression to deter-
mine whether it was significantly different
from 0 (horizontal slope). On defeat days
1–5, the slope of the regression line in
vehicle-treated defeated mice was signifi-
cantly �0 (� � 0.38, p � 0.004), indicat-
ing a quasi-linear increase in PS bouts
over time in this group, whereas the line of
best fit in JDTic-treated mice did not dif-
fer from 0 (� � 0.23, p � 0.12), suggesting
a reduction in the rate at which changes in
in PS bouts developed (Fig. 8B). On defeat
days 6–10, neither regression line differed
from 0, suggesting a plateau with no fur-
ther changes in either group (Fig. 8C). Fi-
nally, during the postdefeat period, the
slope of the regression line for vehicle-
treated defeated mice did not deviate from
0, indicating absence of recovery to base-
line, whereas the line of best fit for JDTic-
treated mice was significantly �0 (� �
�0.37, p � 0.012), indicating an en-
hanced rate of recovery (Fig. 8D). There
was no effect of JDTic on latencies to enter
PS, SWS, or AW (data not shown). JDTic
also mitigated CSDS effects on circadian
rhythmicity of core body temperature,
which depended on an hour � day inter-
action in vehicle-treated mice (F(46,690) �
2.03, p � 0.001). In this group, core body
temperature was lower at ZT6 and at
ZT16-ZT18 on day 10 relative to baseline
(p values �0.05) (Fig. 8E), indicating a
flattening of the circadian rhythmicity. In
JDTic-treated defeated mice, the ANOVA
revealed a main effect of hour only
(F(23,552) � 16.16, p � 0.001) (Fig. 8F),
indicating no differences from baseline at
any point. Interestingly, JDTic failed to af-
fect CSDS effects on circadian rhythm of motor activity: effects
depended on hour � day interactions in defeated mice treated
with vehicle (F(23,460) � 4.079, p � 0.001) or JDTic (F(23,460) �
3.327, p � 0.001), with numerous differences from baseline in
both vehicle- and JDTic-treated defeated mice (p values �0.05–
0.01) (Fig. 8G,H). These data indicate a flattening of circadian
rhythmicity in both groups and suggest that body temperature
and motor activity can vary independently. JDTic did not affect
CSDS effects on SWS, AW, or qEEG (data not shown).
Effects of CSDS on mPER2 in the mesocorticolimbic pathway
We used qRT-PCR was used to assess alterations in mRNA levels
of the circadian rhythm gene mPer2 in mice from Experiment 2,
focusing on the mesocorticolimbic system (i.e., the VTA and its
major outputs: AMG, NAc, PFC), considering its role in mood
and anxiety disorders (Nestler and Carlezon, 2006). Levels of
mPer2 mRNA depended on a region � pretreatment � treatment
interaction (F(3,69) � 55.97, p � 0.001) (Fig. 9). CSDS increased

 mPer2 expression in the VTA and AMG and reduced it in the NAc
and PFC (p values �0.05–0.01). In defeated mice treated with
JDTic before CSDS, mPer2 expression did not differ from con-
trols in the VTA or AMG, indicating blockade of CSDS effects. In
the NAc, mPer2 levels were significantly higher in defeated mice
that received JDTic than in controls (p � 0.01), suggesting that
the combination of CSDS and KOR antagonism may engage
cellular pathways that are different from those engaged by
either alone. In the PFC, CSDS, JDTic, and the combination
produced qualitatively similar reductions in mPer2 (p values
�0.01).
Discussion
CSDS dysregulates circadian rhythms and sleep in mice
CSDS profoundly altered circadian rhythms and sleep. Effects
included disruption of the circadian rhythmicity of motor activ-
ity and body temperature, such that the normal daily amplitude
(rhythm strength) of these endpoints was reduced. CSDS also
altered sleep, causing increases in time spent in PS and the num-
ber of PS bouts, increases in time spent in SWS, and correspond-
ing decreases in time spent in AW. Effects were progressive,
strengthening over the course of CSDS and reaching asymptotes
by days 5–6 of the 10 day regimen. Whereas some effects normal-
ized following cessation of CSDS, others persisted through the 5
day recovery period, including reductions in circadian amplitude
of body temperature and motor activity, increases in PS bouts,
and time in SWS. Persistent increases in the number of PS bouts
without corresponding increases in PS time indicate sleep frag-
mentation during this phase. The persistence of these changes is
intriguing in the context of modeling stress-induced psychiatric
illnesses, such as mood and anxiety disorders, which are, by def-
inition, persistent and disruptive (American Psychiatric Associa-
tion, 2013).
Similarities with human psychiatric conditions
CSDS produces behavioral signs in mice that resemble core fea-
tures of MDD, including social withdrawal and anhedonia (Ber-
ton et al., 2006; Donahue et al., 2014). Interestingly, the
reductions in motivation, reflected by increases in threshold lev-
els of brain stimulation needed to sustain intracranial self-
stimulation, follow approximately the same time course of
alterations in sleep seen in the present studies, reaching asymp-

 tote midway through the CSDS regimen and remaining elevated
during recovery (Donahue et al., 2014). The fact that antidepres-
sants mitigate CSDS-induced behavioral alterations with time
courses resembling those seen in humans (Berton et al., 2006;
Zarate et al., 2006; Donahue et al., 2014) supports the validity of
this procedure to study depressive disorders. Our current find-
ings further support the notion that CSDS produces effects in
mice that resemble core features of clinical depression. For ex-
ample, flattening of the amplitude of circadian rhythm of body
temperature, with increases during inactive phases and de-
creases in active phases, has been described in clinical settings
(Soue
ˆtre et al., 1988; Duncan, 1996; Kronfeld-Schor and Einat,
2012). Similarly, reduced motor activity
during active phases is often seen in de-
pressive disorders (Burton et al., 2013).
CSDS also produces alterations in sleep
that resemble those common in MDD, in-
cluding increases in PS (which shares fea-
tures of REM sleep) (Armitage, 2007; Nutt
et al., 2008; Steiger and Kimura 2010;
Palagini et al., 2013; Medina et al., 2014).
While a recent report demonstrated that
defeat stress suppresses PS (Page et al.,
2016), the experimental design (intermit-
tent defeat in rats) and time course differ
from those used here. Consistent with our
findings, previous reports indicate that
acute or short-term stress increase SWS
time, and that this may represent an adap-
tive response (Meerlo et al., 1997; Meerlo
and Turek, 2001), the absence of which
contributes to depression (Medina et al.,
2014). Humans with MDD also have
lower latencies to the first REM bout, sug-
gesting more rapid cycling through sleep
stages (Palagini et al., 2013). Our finding
that CSDS decreased latencies to PS is
broadly consistent with clinical data, al-
though the latencies quickly normalized
upon cessation of the defeat regimen.
We also found that CSDS produced
large effects on qEEG, including robust
increases in theta and delta power during
PS. Unlike delta power, however, theta
power remained elevated throughout the
10 day CSDS regimen. Evidence suggests
that theta oscillations during PS play a key
role in the consolidation of negative/aver-
sive memories (Hutchison and Rathore,
2015). In rats, theta is increased during PS
following training in an aversive avoid-
ance task (Fogel et al., 2009), and the
degree of theta coherence between the
AMG and hippocampus after fear condi-
tioning is correlated with fear behavior
(Popa et al., 2010). In humans, theta
power is potentiated in the PFC during PS
after exposure to emotionally negative
stimuli (Nishida et al., 2009). Comple-
menting the sleep state-dependent altera-
tions in these specific frequency bands,
comparisons of qEEG spectrograms de-
picting total power across the CSDS regi-
men revealed a visible flattening of circadian fluctuations,
consistent with reductions in total EEG power and a flattening of
EEG rhythmicity following maternal separation and chronic mild
stress (Mrdalj et al., 2013).
Stress susceptibility and resilience
In light of previous work (Krishnan et al., 2007), we examined
whether defeated mice could be segregated into susceptible and
resilient subpopulations. Although this is often done via a me-
dian split of SI data, CSDS failed to produce avoidance behaviors
in the present studies, and the distribution was atypically homo-
geneous (Krishnan et al., 2007; Donahue et al., 2014). Although

 this effect may have resolved by increasing group sizes, group
sizes in our previous reports (Donahue et al., 2014, 2015) are
comparable with those used here. One potential explanation for
the present outcome is that the presence of the subcutaneous
transmitter (the size of a small acorn situated on the back/flank)
altered the microstructure of social behavior, reducing the valid-
ity of this endpoint under these conditions. We instead used
circadian rhythm of body temperature amplitude, which was
shown previously to serve as a secondary biomarker in mice seg-
regated on the basis of SI (Krishnan et al., 2007). We used mean
temperature amplitude data from the recovery period to segre-
gate defeated mice into susceptible (below median) and resilient
(above median) subpopulations and found that effects on PS and
circadian rhythms were larger and/or more persistent in suscep-
tible mice. These findings raise the possibility that amplitude of
body temperature rhythmicity may be a viable biomarker of
stress susceptibility.
Role for KORs in CSDS effects
Blockade of KORs prevented some of the physiological and mo-
lecular effects of CSDS. Accumulating evidence indicates that
KORs play an important role in regulating stress responsiveness,
motivation, and emotion (Bruchas et al., 2010; Knoll and Carle-
zon, 2010; Van’t Veer and Carlezon, 2013). KOR agonists
produce dysphoria in humans (Pfeiffer et al., 1986) and
depressive-like effects in rodents (Carlezon et al., 2006; Bruchas
et al., 2010; Muschamp et al., 2011), whereas KOR antagonists
reduce stress effects (Pliakas et al., 2001; Mague et al., 2003;
McLaughlin et al., 2003; Beardsley et al., 2005) and produce
anxiolytic-like effects (Knoll et al., 2007). KOR antagonists tend
to be more effective when given before a stressor (Van’t Veer and
Carlezon, 2013), as opposed to after behavioral adaptations have
developed (Chartoff et al., 2012; Chartoff and Carlezon, 2014).
Administration of JDTic, which produces long-lasting KOR
blockade (Carroll et al., 2004; Van’t Veer et al., 2012), before the
start of the CSDS regimen reduced defeat-related increases in the
number of PS bouts and hastened recovery. However, JDTic
failed to affect CSDS effects on other sleep metrics, suggesting
that stress effects on individual endpoints may depend upon dis-
tinct (but parallel) mechanisms. JDTic also mitigated CSDS ef-
fects on the circadian rhythmicity of body temperature without
affecting that of motor activity, consistent with the notion that

Wells et al. • Social Defeat Stress Effect on Sleep
 circuits that maintain these rhythms are at least partly nonover-
lapping (Saper et al., 2005). The question of whether KOR antag-
onists block the effects of stress on these endpoints directly (i.e.,
by acutely reducing its impact) or indirectly (i.e., by producing
sleep/circadian alterations that boost stress resilience) may be
resolved by the development of short-acting KOR antagonists
that do not require extended (24 h) pretreatment (Carroll and
Carlezon, 2013). Finally, JDTic blocked the effects of CSDS on
expression of mPer2 in the VTA, AMG, and NAc, suggesting a
critical role of KORs in transducing the molecular effects of stress
in pathways that regulate motivation and emotion. Effects in the
NAc suggest a paradoxical synergy between CSDS and KOR an-
tagonism, whereas these manipulations appeared to produce the
same effects in the PFC. Future studies involving highly selective
molecular manipulations (Van’t Veer et al., 2013a; Tejeda et al.,
2017) may characterize specific contributions of KORs in each of
these regions to altered sleep and circadian rhythmicity. Al-
though the VTA and its outputs are not typically implicated in
sleep or circadian rhythm, it is possible that stress effects on cir-
cadian genes in these regions (Spencer et al., 2013) may disrupt
other circuits. Indeed, regulation of sleep/wakefulness involves
complex and overlapping circuits with inhibitory, excitatory, and
disinhibitory components, and changes in the function of one
element can impact others (Saper et al., 2005). Although we gen-
erally focus on the role of the mesocorticolimbic system in mood
and anxiety disorders (Nestler and Carlezon, 2006), other brain
areas have been implicated in both sleep/wakefulness and KOR-
regulated stress responses, including the dorsal raphe nucleus
and locus ceruleus (Saper et al., 2005; Bruchas et al., 2011, Al-
Hasani et al., 2013). The finding that KOR antagonism blocked
some, but not all, CSDS effects is broadly consistent with previ-
ous work showing that JDTic can block corticotropin-releasing
factor-induced enhancements of the acoustic startle response
(Van’t Veer et al., 2013b) but not CSDS-induced elevations in
intracranial self-stimulation thresholds (Donahue et al., 2015),
and fits with recent conceptualizations of psychiatric illnesses as
conditions composed of neurobiologically distinguishable do-
mains rather than a rigid set of symptoms with a single patho-
physiology (Cuthbert and Insel, 2013).
In conclusion, use of endpoints, including sleep and circadian
rhythmicity of body temperature and motor activity, has advan-
tages for studies of stress-related disorders in laboratory animals.
Foremost, these same endpoints can be studied in humans, as
opposed to the endpoints from other commonly used tests (e.g.,
tail suspension test, elevated plus maze) that were designed as
drug screening assays but have evolved into proxies for
depressive- and anxiety-like effects. Considering that persistence
is a defining characteristic of psychiatric illness, the CSDS effects
that persist beyond the termination of the stress, circadian rhyth-
micity of body temperature and motor activity, PS bouts, and
time spent in SWS, represent compelling starting points for more
translationally oriented studies that examine the mechanisms by
which stress can trigger long-lasting changes in health. Addi-
tional work is needed to determine whether these effects repre-
sent homeostatic processes that enhance recovery or feedforward
processes that trigger subsequent maladaptive responses, or are
more or less prevalent in stress-resilient strains (Vialou et al.,
2010; Donahue et al., 2014). Refinement of endpoints that are
homologous across species will facilitate the implementation of
translational studies that better predict clinical outcomes in hu-
mans, enhance the success of clinical trials, and hasten the devel-
opment of improved therapeutics.
