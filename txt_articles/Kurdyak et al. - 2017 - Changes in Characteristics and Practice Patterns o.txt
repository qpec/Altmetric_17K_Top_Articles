Abstract
Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in demographic, geographic, and practice characteristics of
all Ontario psychiatrists between 2003 and 2013 and their implication for access to psychiatrists.
Methods: We included all psychiatrists who were clinically active in Ontario in any year from 2003 to 2013. For each
psychiatrist, we reported age, sex, years since medical school graduation, geographic practice region, and practice charac-
teristics such as total number of inpatients, outpatients, and outpatient visit frequencies.
Results: In 2013, there were 2070 psychiatrists, with nearly half (47%) more than 30 years since medical school graduation.
Female psychiatrists comprised 41% of all psychiatrists in 2013 but 56% of all psychiatrists within 15 years of medical school
graduation. Between 2003 and 2013, there was a 17% increase in the total number of psychiatrists, with the largest growth in
psychiatrists occurring in the group more than 30 years from medical school graduation. Over these 11 years, the mean (SD)
number of unique outpatients seen by a psychiatrist annually increased from 208 (228) to 249 (275) (19.5%; P ¼ 0.001), with
male psychiatrists, on average, seeing more outpatients annually than female psychiatrists.
Conclusion: The number of outpatients seen by psychiatrists is slowly increasing. However, the large proportion of aging
psychiatrists, the high concentration of psychiatrists in urban settings, and the increase in the number of female psychiatrists
with smaller practices suggest that without radical changes to the way psychiatrists practice, access to psychiatrists will remain
a challenge in Ontario.

Access to psychiatrists is a challenge in Canada and inter-
nationally. In Canada, primary care physicians rated psy-
chiatrists as the most challenging specialist to access.1 A
study conducted in Vancouver, British Columbia, found that
only 6 of 230 psychiatrists doing active clinical work were
able to provide a consultation to a family health team in a
timely manner.2 Patients also describe access to psychiatrists
as challenging3: A study in the United States found that
psychiatrists were more likely to accept private patients and
less likely to provide services to patients covered by Medi-
caid or other insurance plans than were nonpsychiatrist spe-
cialists; the authors commented that this low acceptance rate
poses a barrier to access.4 Psychiatrists are only one aspect of
a responsive mental health system, which typically includes
primary care physicians, psychologists, social workers, and
other allied mental health professionals; psychiatrists typi-
cally adopt the role of providing and/or overseeing the deliv-
ery of specialist mental health or addictions care. Indeed, the
United Kingdom5,6 and Australia7 have both responded to
poor access to psychiatrists by integrating the services of
psychologists and social workers into the publicly funded
system to provide evidence-based therapy and by having
psychiatrists adopt the role of consultants, and a similar
initiative has been proposed for Canada.8
Previously, we reported that the supply of Ontario full-
time psychiatrists is not equally distributed across the prov-
ince, with many more psychiatrists practicing in Toronto and
Ottawa than in suburban or rural regions.9 We also showed
that as the supply of psychiatrists increased, the proportion
of psychiatrists adopting low-volume practices increased.
For example, approximately 10% of full-time psychiatrists
in Toronto see fewer than 40 patients annually, compared
with 4% in low-supply regions, and approximately 40% of
full-time psychiatrists in Toronto see fewer than 100 patients
annually, compared with 10% in low-supply regions. The
patients seen by these psychiatrists were more likely to
reside in the highest income neighbourhoods and less likely
to have had a prior psychiatric hospitalization, compared
with patients seen less frequently.
These findings led to the publication of a Globe and Mail
op-ed10 and a Medical Post article11 questioning what roles a
psychiatrist should assume in a publicly funded health care
system. This study also raised questions among Ontario psy-
chiatrists. For example, some psychiatrists wondered
whether psychiatrists with low-volume practices were more
likely to be older and close to retirement. This would mean
that an increasing number of younger psychiatrists who see a
large number of patients would solve the problem of access
to psychiatrists, making the need to address these low-
volume practices a less relevant issue. Academic psychia-
trists responsible for training psychiatry residents were also
interested in the impact of gender since more women than
men are now accepted into psychiatry residency programs.
Beyond these specific issues, there was a need to understand
better the relationship between characteristics of Ontario
psychiatrists and their practice.
While studies have described the profiles of US psychia-
trists,12-15 these studies were based on self-reports and they
reflect US psychiatry practices from the late 1990s. In the
absence of similar studies of the Canadian psychiatrist
workforce, we used population-based health administrative
data to evaluate the characteristics (age, sex, practice
region, and years since medical school graduation) and
practice patterns of all psychiatrists in Ontario between
2003 and 2013. While the data are well-suited to provide
information on regional psychiatrist supply, psychiatrist
characteristics, and practice patterns, we are unable to pro-
vide direct information about quality of care or patient out-
comes. Additionally, we focus specifically on psychiatrist
demographics and practice pattern trends and therefore
cannot comment on access to care beyond care provided
by psychiatrists. Based on feedback from psychiatrists
following our first study,9 we evaluated the adoption of
low-volume patient practices by age category over time
to determine whether there is a cohort effect. We also eval-
uated the proportion of female psychiatrists and their prac-
tice patterns over time to investigate the impact of the
increased proportion of female psychiatrists.

 Methods
Data Sources
Psychiatrist characteristics were obtained from the Institute
for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) Physician Database
(IPDB). Patient records were linked using unique, anon-
ymized, encoded identifiers across multiple Ontario health
administrative databases containing information on all pub-
licly insured, medically necessary hospital and physician
services. Psychiatrist practice patterns were obtained from
the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) database. This
study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of Sunny-
brook Health Sciences Centre.
Study Sample
We included all psychiatrists who submitted at least 1 billing
claim to OHIP in each of the 11 years included in our study
(2003 to 2013).
Psychiatrist Characteristics
We assessed the following characteristics for each psychia-
trist on a yearly basis: age, sex, years since medical school
graduation, region of practice (based on the 14 Ontario Local
Health Integration Network [LHIN] boundaries). We deter-
mined whether psychiatrists worked full-time using the
Health Canada definition of a full-time equivalent physician:
having annual billings above the 30th percentile for all
Ontario psychiatrists.16 For each psychiatrist and in each
year of our study, we measured the number of unique
outpatients (defined as any patient with at least 1 visit
per year), number of new outpatients (defined as no visits
in the 12 months prior to the first visit in the year of
interest), and number of patient encounters, overall and
by location (inpatient vs. outpatient). New patients were
defined as those with no visits to the same psychiatrist in
the preceding 12 months.
Statistical Analysis
We used chi-square for categorical comparisons and also
used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test for trends over
time. We used SAS Version 9 for all statistical analyses.17
Results
In 2013, there were 2070 psychiatrists in Ontario who met
our minimal clinical activity threshold of at least 1 submitted
OHIP billing, with 1 in 5 (20.5%) psychiatrists within 15
years from their medical school graduation, 1 in 3 (32.8%)
between 16 and 30 years, and nearly half (46.7%) over 30
years (Table 1). The average age of Ontario psychiatrists in
these 3 categories was 38 (�15 years from graduation), 50
(16-30 years from graduation), and 66 (>30 years from gra-
duation). Female psychiatrists comprised 41% of all Ontario
psychiatrists. While females made up 56% of all psychia-
trists within 15 years of graduation from medical school, the
proportion of female psychiatrists decreased as years from
graduation increased. Overall, 3 of 5 (61.4%) of all Ontario

 psychiatrists graduated from Canadian medical schools:
80.0% of psychiatrists were within 15 years of graduation
but only half (49.3%) of psychiatrists were more than 30
years. Finally, the number of psychiatrists in LHINs was
highly variable, with 36% of all Ontario psychiatrists, and
41% of psychiatrists within 15 years of graduation, practi-
cing in the Toronto Central LHIN.
Assessing changes in the supply of Ontario psychiatrists
over time, the total number of psychiatrists increased from
1775 to 2017 (an increase of 16.6%) between 2003 and 2013
(Table 2). In the same period, the number of psychiatrists
more than 30 years since graduation increased from 641 to
966 (an increase of 50.7%). The number of psychiatrists
within 15 years of graduation increased from 312 to
425 (36.2%), and the number of psychiatrists between 16
and 30 years since graduation decreased from 822 to 679
(–17.4%). The mean (SD) number of unique outpatients seen
by a psychiatrist annually increased from 208 (228) to 249
(275) (19.5%; P ¼ 0.001), whereas the mean (SD) number of
unique inpatients seen annually increased from 54 (112) to
60 (110) (11.6%; P ¼ 0.003). The proportion of all psychia-
trists who saw fewer than 40 outpatients annually decreased
from 310 (17.5% of all psychiatrists in 2003) to 299 (14.5%
of all psychiatrists in 2013) (P ¼ 0.12), and the proportion of
psychiatrists who saw fewer than 100 outpatients annually
decreased from 729 (41.1%) to 730 (35.3%) (P ¼ 0.25). The
proportion of psychiatrists within each cohort based on the
period of time since graduation from medical school (�15,
16-30, and >30) who saw fewer than 40 and 100 outpatients
annually is shown in Figure 1.
The per capita distribution of Ontario psychiatrists in
2013, including the years since graduation, by LHIN is
shown in Table 3 and Figure 2. The Toronto Central LHIN
had the highest number of psychiatrists per capita (61.0 psy-
chiatrists per 100,000) whereas the Central West LHIN had
the lowest (4.2 psychiatrists per capita), a 15-fold difference
in psychiatrist supply. The LHINs with large urban centres
(Toronto Central, Champlain [Ottawa], and Hamilton Nia-
gara [Toronto Western suburbs and Hamilton]) had the larg-
est proportion of recent graduates; the rural LHINs tended to
have the highest proportion of psychiatrists 30 years or more
from medical school graduation.
Practice characteristics in 2013 by psychiatrist sex and
cohort since medical school graduation are shown in Table
4. Male psychiatrists saw a higher number of unique out-
patients, unique inpatients, unique total patients, and new
patients in each cohort since medical school. Female psy-
chiatrists had a higher mean number of visits per patient than
male psychiatrists. In each cohort, both male and female
psychiatrists 16 to 30 years since graduation saw more
unique outpatients than their older and younger counterparts,
whereas the number of unique inpatients seen annually
decreased as time since graduation increased. Similarly, the
number of new outpatients seen per year decreased and the
mean number of visits per patient increased as the years
since graduation increased.

 Discussion
Our study describes Ontario psychiatrists and their cur-
rent pattern of practice as well as changes over the pre-
vious decade. Currently, there are a large number of
psychiatrists more than 30 years since graduation from med-
icalschoolorwithin15yearsof graduation, with relatively few
mid-career psychiatrists. Ontario psychiatrists practice
predominantlyinurbanareas,with40% ofOntariopsychiatrists
working in the Toronto Central LHIN where only 10% of the
Ontario population reside. Overall, there has been a statistically
significant but modest increase in the average number of out-
patients seen annually and no statistically significant change in
the proportion of psychiatrists seeing fewer than 40 or 100 out-
patients annually.

 The practice patterns of psychiatrists vary by age and sex of
the psychiatrists, with recent graduates seeing fewer outpati-
ents than older psychiatrists and female psychiatrists seeing
fewer patients (both inpatients and outpatients) than their male
counterparts regardless of their cohort. Over the past decade,
the proportion of psychiatrists who are female has increased,
and the proportion of female psychiatrists is expected to con-
tinue to increase over time based on recent and current Cana-
dian residency training programs with a larger proportion of
female trainees. Thus, the lower practice volume of female
psychiatrists is expected to affect accessto care even more than
the differential pattern of practice we observed in age cohorts.
It may be that the lower outpatient volumes and higher visit
frequency observed in female psychiatrist practices are associ-
ated with higher quality of care, as has been observed in female
primary care physicians.18 However, the differential practice
patterns of younger and female psychiatrists who are increas-
ingly practicing in urban areas should worsen the access to
psychiatrists in already underserved regions. Our data do not
explain the reasons why younger and female psychiatrists see
fewer patients, but these reasons are likely complex and multi-
factorial. Further quantitative and qualitative studies examin-
ing psychiatrist demographic factors with respect to quality of
care provided and patient outcomes are necessary.
Another significant finding of our study is that despite the
need for greater access to psychiatrists, the practice patterns of
psychiatristshaveremainedlargelyunchangedoverthe11-year
study period. Our results suggest that the addition of younger
psychiatrists to the current supply of Ontario psychiatrists will
not solve the demand for increased access to their services. The
role of psychiatrists, and, more specifically, how they practice
and engage in the broader health care system, will need to
change radically to accommodate the psychiatrist demographic
shifts highlighted by our data: many older male psychiatrists
nearing retirement being replaced by an increasing proportion
of younger female psychiatrists who see fewer patients.
There are a number of possible explanations for our find-
ings. The Ontario fee schedule does not impose any limits on
the duration or frequency with which a patient is seen. This
may provide an incentive to see a small number of familiar
patients repeatedly and a disincentive to see more patients or
new patients. In Australia, changes in the psychiatry fee
schedule have created disincentives for high-frequency
repeat patient visits. The resulting reduced frequency of
patient visits and larger number of patients being seen sug-
gest that financial incentives are effective at changing psy-
chiatrist practice patterns.19 However, the fee schedule is the
same for all Ontario psychiatrists, so the varied practice
patterns observed across regions with high versus low psy-
chiatrist supply and across age and gender groups are clearly
influenced by factors other than the fee schedule. The data
we used are ideal for describing what is happening, but other
studies are needed to explain why we observed these varia-
tions in practice by region, age, and gender.
In response to rising health care costs in the United States,
health management organizations and behavioural health
‘‘carve-outs’’ were developed, and the organization of psy-
chiatric care for those with health insurance coverage chan-
ged.20 Along with these reforms, the role of a psychiatrist in
the United States within these new managed care systems
also changed, and the changes were met with significant
criticism early on,21 which continues to this day.22 Thus,
while the behavioural health carve-outs are associated with
efficiency,23 the gains in efficiency appear to be at the cost of
psychiatrist job satisfaction, related to the perception that
psychiatrists are less autonomous in the way they can pro-
vide care to patients. In contrast, our study suggests that
Ontario psychiatrists have not been ‘‘managed,’’ with little
change in practice patterns over the past decade despite an
increasing awareness of a substantial amount of unmet need
for psychiatric services24 and, according to Canada’s Wait
Time Alliance, no current way to systematically assess
access to psychiatric care.25 There is an opportunity for
Ontario psychiatrists, as self-regulating professionals, to be
better integrated within the broader array of health services
to align psychiatrists as a finite human resource with the
existing need. In the absence of better integration, Ontario
psychiatrists may lose their autonomy and face practice
restrictions similar to restrictions faced by Quebec psychia-
trists (e.g., restrictions on where they can practice) or by US
psychiatrists (e.g., restrictions on the treatment they can pro-
vide to their patients), with the risk of erosion of job satis-
faction. Looking towards the future, Canadian psychiatry
residency programs are preparing for the introduction of
competency-based education in psychiatry residency, a
mode of training that incorporates (1) identifying outcomes
that need to be achieved through training; (2) defining per-
formance levels or standards for each competency; (3) devel-
oping an evaluation framework for competencies; and
(4) continuously evaluating competency-based medical edu-
cation to see whether it is indeed producing the desired out-
come of competent psychiatrists.26,27 The development of
core competencies provides a unique opportunity to redefine
and modify the role of future psychiatrists in Ontario.
In summary, this study provides a quantitative evaluation
of the current Ontario psychiatrist work force, their pattern
of practice, and changes over time. Our results suggest that,
absent some radical changes in the way Ontario psychiatrists
practice, 2 impactful demographic trends will worsen the
access to psychiatrists in Ontario: a large number of older
male psychiatrists (with large outpatient practices) nearing
retirement and a large number of younger and female psy-
chiatrists (with relatively smaller outpatient practices) enter-
ing the work force. Access to psychiatrists outside of urban
settings will become even more challenging given the
regional distribution of psychiatrists, with the majority of
psychiatrists already practicing in large urban settings and
an even larger proportion of newer psychiatrists establishing
their practice in the Greater Toronto Area. Increasing access
to psychiatrists while preserving, or enhancing, quality of
care will be a challenge for an evolving mental health sys-
tem. We hope that the information from this study will be
