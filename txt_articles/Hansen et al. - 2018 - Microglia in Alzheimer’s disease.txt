Introduction
With its aging populations, the world is facing a crisis of Alz-
heimer’s disease (AD). A progressive neurodegenerative disor-
der afflicting mainly the elderly, AD is the most common cause 
of dementia and a leading cause of death in the United States 
(James et al., 2014; Weuve et al., 2014). Alois Alzheimer first 
described the histopathology of AD (Alzheimer, 1907), which 
is characterized by brain atrophy, amyloid plaques (extracellu-
lar deposits of Aβ peptide aggregates), neurofibrillary tangles 
(composed largely of tau protein), loss of neurons and synapses, 
and dystrophic neurites. In addition, Alzheimer noted, “The glia 
have developed numerous fibers” (Alzheimer et al., 1995).
The reactive gliosis of AD histopathology reflects the ab-
normal morphology and proliferation of astrocytes and microg-
lia. Microgliosis and astrogliosis are common features of many 
neurodegenerative diseases with distinct etiologies (Maragakis 
and Rothstein, 2006; Ransohoff and Perry, 2009; Glass et al., 
2010), but it was uncertain whether these histopathological 
changes reflect a beneficial, detrimental, or inconsequential ac-
tivity of glial cells in the neurodegenerative process. In recent 
years, however, biological advances stemming from human 
genetics data have removed any doubt that microglia play an 
important role in the pathogenesis of AD.
Microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous 
system (CNS), originate from erythromyeloid progenitor cells 
in the embryonic yolk sac and migrate into the brain around em-
bryonic day 10.5 in mouse, after which they propagate, spread, 
and ramify throughout the brain parenchyma (Ginhoux et al., 
2013). Their homeostasis and self-renewal is maintained by 
several factors, including TGF-β and CSF1R signaling (Gin-
houx et al., 2010; Butovsky et al., 2014; Elmore et al., 2014). 
In the CNS, microglia serve as resident phagocytes that dynam-
ically survey the environment, playing crucial roles in CNS 
tissue maintenance, injury response, and pathogen defense 
(Nayak et al., 2014; Colonna and Butovsky, 2017). Microglia 
also participate in the developmental sculpting of neural cir-
cuits by engulfment and removal of unwanted neurons and syn-
apses (Schafer et al., 2012; Frost and Schafer, 2016). Parabiosis 
experiments in AD mouse models indicated that microglia ac-
count for the increased myeloid cell number observed in brains 
with plaque pathology, with minimal contribution of infiltrating 
macrophages (Wang et al., 2016).
In this review, we consider the genetic and cell biologi-
cal data indicating that microglia have protective functions that 
restrain the toxic accumulation of β-amyloid and prevent the 
development of AD. We also review the evidence that, once ac-
tivated, microglia can have harmful actions in AD, such as being 
the source of inflammatory factors and mediating the engulf-
ment of neuronal synapses. Finally, we discuss recent advances 
in profiling the microglial transcriptome that help us better un-
derstand the role of microglia in mechanisms of AD pathology.
Human genetic evidence for microglia 
involvement in late-onset AD
The accumulation of Aβ peptides, and their aggregation and 
deposition in amyloid plaques, is believed to be a key patho-
genic mechanism in AD. Occurring during the decade or two 
preceding dementia symptoms (Bateman et al., 2012; Fleisher 
et al., 2012; Villemagne et al., 2013), β-amyloidosis results 
from an imbalance in the production versus clearance of Aβ. 
The human genetics of familial AD highlighted excessive pro-
duction of amyloidogenic Aβ as a cause of early onset AD; mu-
tations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) or in its processing 
enzyme (γ-secretase, presenilin subunits PS1 or PS2) result 
in increased β-site cleavage of APP or favored production of 
longer, aggregation-prone variants of Aβ peptide (Selkoe and 
Hardy, 2016; Szaruga et al., 2017).
Proliferation and activation of microglia in the brain, con-
centrated around amyloid plaques, is a prominent feature 
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Human genetics data point 
to a key role for microglia in the pathogenesis of AD. The 
majority of risk genes for AD are highly expressed (and 
many are selectively expressed) by microglia in the brain. 
There is mounting evidence that microglia protect against 
the incidence of AD, as impaired microglial activities and 
altered microglial responses to β-amyloid are associated 
with increased AD risk. On the other hand, there is also 
abundant evidence that activated microglia can be harm-
ful to neurons. Microglia can mediate synapse loss by en-
gulfment of synapses, likely via a complement-dependent 
mechanism; they can also exacerbate tau pathology and 
secrete inflammatory factors that can injure neurons di-
rectly or via activation of neurotoxic astrocytes. Gene ex-
pression profiles indicate multiple states of microglial 
activation in neurodegenerative disease settings, which 
might explain the disparate roles of microglia in the devel-
opment and progression of AD pathology.

Familial AD is extremely rare, however; the vast majority 
of AD cases are “sporadic” and occur late in life. Late-onset AD 
appears to result mainly from a mixture of genetic and environ-
mental factors, including aging, that impair the brain’s ability to 
clear Aβ (Mawuenyega et al., 2010; Wildsmith et al., 2013). In 
the last decade, human genetic studies, especially genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs) using single-nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs), have identified over 20 genetic loci that 
robustly associate with AD risk (Lambert et al., 2013; Karch 
et al., 2014; Table 1).
A significant fraction of the heritable risk for sporadic AD 
can be accounted for by the APOE gene, of which there are 
three common alleles encoding the apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 
variants of apolipoprotein E (Holtzman et al., 2012). Relative to 
the most common apoE3 variant, a single apoE4 or apoE2 allele 
confers an approximately threefold increased or approximately 
twofold reduced risk of developing AD, respectively (Corder 
et al., 1993, 1994; Strittmatter et al., 1993; Farrer et al., 1997). 
ApoE, the major protein component of high density lipoprotein 
(HDL)–like lipoprotein particles that transport lipids, choles-
terol, and other hydrophobic molecules in the brain, is present 
in Aβ plaques (Namba et al., 1991; Wisniewski and Frangione, 
1992; Zhan et al., 1995) and contributes to both the clearance 
and the amyloid deposition of Aβ peptide (Bales et al., 1997a; 
DeMattos et al., 2004; Bien-Ly et al., 2012; Holtzman et al., 
2012). Relative to apoE3, apoE4 appears to reduce the clear-
ance of Aβ and increase its deposition in plaques (Rebeck et al., 
1993; Kok et al., 2009; Reiman et al., 2009; Castellano et al., 
2011; Fleisher et al., 2013). The precise mechanisms by which 
apoE4 confers increased AD risk are not well understood.
Other than APOE, the common genetic variants associ-
ated with AD confer only minor effects (∼10–20%) on AD risk 
(Lambert et al., 2013). Although the molecular-genetic mech-
anisms for most AD-associated loci remain to be elucidated, a 
striking feature of the identified risk genes is that the majority 
of them are expressed selectively or preferentially in microglia 
relative to other cell types in the brain (Fig. 1 A; Srinivasan et 
al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016). For example, a common variant in 
SPI1 is associated with reduced AD risk and reduced SPI1 ex-
pression (Huang et al., 2017); SPI1 encodes the PU.1 transcrip-
tion factor that is essential for microglial development (Schulz 
et al., 2012; Kierdorf et al., 2013). This broad trend implicates 
microglial dysfunction as a contributing factor, rather than an 
attendant feature, of AD pathogenesis.
In addition to the common variants identified by GWASs, 
rare genetic variants associated with AD (found by gene se-
quencing or exome array) have also implicated microglia in 
determining the risk of AD (Guerreiro et al., 2013; Jonsson et 
al., 2013; Sims et al., 2017). Particularly momentous was the 
discovery of AD-associated variants in TREM2 (triggering 
receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2), a cell surface protein 
selectively and highly expressed by microglia in the brain, as 
well as by certain myeloid cells in the periphery. The TREM2 
mutation most clearly associated with AD (R47H, carried by 
<0.5% of most populations) increases the risk of AD approxi-
mately threefold (Guerreiro et al., 2013; Jonsson et al., 2013). 
Because R47H appears to be a loss-of-function mutation that 
impairs TREM2-mediated microglial activation (see the fol-
lowing sections), the study of TREM2 has been instrumental 
in establishing the view that microglia normally operate in a 
protective capacity against AD (Jay et al., 2017b; Ulrich et al., 
2017; Yeh et al., 2017).
Protective role of TREM2 and 
microglia in AD
TREM2 functions as a cell surface receptor on microglia; via 
its interaction with the activating adaptor protein DAP12 (en-
coded by the TYR 
OBP gene), TREM2 stimulation initiates 
signal transduction pathways that promote microglial chemo-
taxis, phagocytosis, survival, and proliferation (Takahashi et al., 
2005; Hsieh et al., 2009; Kleinberger et al., 2014; Poliani et al., 
2015; Wang et al., 2015, 2016; Mazaheri et al., 2017; Zheng et 
al., 2017; Fig. 1 B). Extracellular ligands of TREM2 include a 
variety of phospholipids and glycolipids, lipoproteins (e.g., low 
density lipoprotein [LDL] and HDL), and apoptotic cells (Atagi 
et al., 2015; Bailey et al., 2015; Poliani et al., 2015; Wang et al., 
2015; Yeh et al., 2016). Notably, TREM2 binds to apolipopro-
teins apoE and clusterin (CLU; also known as apoJ), which are 
themselves encoded by AD risk genes (Atagi et al., 2015; Bai-
ley et al., 2015; Yeh et al., 2016). TREM2–ligand interactions 
are impaired by TREM2 variants that increase AD risk (Wang et 
al., 2015; Kober et al., 2016; Yeh et al., 2016; Song et al., 2017), 
implying that these AD variants are at least partial loss-of- 
function mutants. Homozygous null mutations in TREM2 cause 
Nasu–Hakola disease, characterized by early onset neurodegen-
eration (including white matter lesions) and bone abnormalities 
(Paloneva et al., 2002; Klünemann et al., 2005).
Phagocytosis and clearance of Aβ and cellular 
debris. 
 An important aspect of tissue homeostasis by microg-
lia is the engulfment and clearance of debris. TREM2 is re-
quired for microglial phagocytosis of a variety of substrates, 
including apoptotic neurons, bacteria, LDL and other lipopro-
teins, and Aβ (Takahashi et al., 2005; N’Diaye et al., 2009; 
Kleinberger et al., 2014; Atagi et al., 2015; Yeh et al., 2016). Aβ 
aggregates are much more efficiently taken up by microglia 
when Aβ is complexed with lipoproteins such as LDL, apoE, 
and CLU/apoJ (Terwel et al., 2011; Yeh et al., 2016). Impor-
tantly, TREM2-deficient microglia showed reduced uptake of 
Aβ-lipoprotein complexes in vitro (Yeh et al., 2016) and less 
evidence of Aβ internalization in vivo (Wang et al., 2016; Yuan 
et al., 2016). The interaction of TREM2 with its lipoprotein li-
gands (LDL, APOE, and CLU) was impaired by the AD-linked 
mutations of TREM2 (R47H, R62H, and D87N) and com-
pletely abolished by Nasu–Hakola disease–linked mutations 
(Y38C and T66M; Atagi et al., 2015; Bailey et al., 2015; Yeh et 
al., 2016). Blood monocyte–derived macrophages from human 
carriers of the TREM2 AD-linked R62H variant showed re-
duced uptake of Aβ–lipoprotein complexes (Yeh et al., 2016). 
Thus, impaired uptake and clearance of Aβ (perhaps as Aβ– 
lipoprotein complexes) could explain, at least in part, how 
TREM2 loss-of-function mutations increase the risk of devel-
oping AD (Fig. 2). Consistent with this notion, plaque accumu-
lation in mouse models of β-amyloidosis (which typically 
overexpress mutant APP together with mutant PS1 or PS2) is 
exacerbated at later ages (8+ months) in Trem2 knockout mice 
(Wang et al., 2015; Jay et al., 2017a).
Beyond clearance of Aβ, another important TREM2-de-
pendent function of microglia is to clean up debris from dam-
aged or dying cells to promote a healthy brain environment, as 
observed in models of demyelination or ischemic stroke (Can-
toni et al., 2015; Kawabori et al., 2015; Poliani et al., 2015). 
The interaction of TREM2 with apoE may facilitate microglial 
phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons (Atagi et al., 2015). We sug-
gest that the TREM2–apoE axis plays a key role in the microg-
lial clearance of a variety of extracellular and cellular detritus

and thus may be generally important for minimizing bystander 
damage to neurons in neurodegenerative settings.
Congregation around amyloid plaques and bar-
rier formation. 
 In the normal brain, microglia dynamically 
extend and retract processes to probe the environment (Nimmer-
jahn et al., 2005). With β-amyloid deposition, however, some 
microglial processes become static, showing stable association 
with plaques over days or weeks, with TREM2, DAP12, and 
phosphotyrosine concentrated in those processes adjacent to 
plaques (Condello et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2016). TREM2-defi-
cient microglia fail to congregate or proliferate around plaques, 
lack the typical morphological changes of microglial activation, 
and show increased apoptosis (Jay et al., 2015; Wang et al., 
2015, 2016; Mazaheri et al., 2017). The microglial gene

expression profile induced by amyloid pathology (see later 
 
section on transcription) was broadly dampened in TREM2- 
deficient mice, indicating a key role of TREM2 in the microglial 
reaction to Aβ pathology (Wang et al., 2015; Keren-Shaul et al., 
2017). A recent study suggested that the multifaceted microglial 
dysfunction observed in TREM2-deficient mice with β-amyloid 
pathology could stem from impaired mTOR signaling and a 
metabolic deficit (Ulland et al., 2017).
What is the role of reactive microglia around plaques? 
Recent evidence suggests that microglia form a protective 
barrier around amyloid deposits, compacting amyloid fibrils 
into a tightly packed and potentially less toxic form, pre-
venting the accretion of new Aβ onto existing plaques, and 
reducing axonal dystrophy in the nearby neuropil (Condello et 
al., 2015). These protective “corralling” functions were more 
readily observed for small, early stage plaques and appeared 
Figure 1. Expression and function of AD risk genes in microglia. (A) These heat maps depict relative expression levels of GWAS-identified AD risk genes 
among CNS cell types purified from human (Zhang et al., 2016) or mouse (Srinivasan et al., 2016) brain tissues and analyzed by RNA sequencing. 
Each column within a cell type represents one sample of those cells purified from a different brain. From human dataset GSE73721, samples derived from 
“normal” cortex are plotted, ranging in age from 8 to 63 yr. From mouse dataset GSE75431, samples from cortex of 13-mo PS2APP β-amyloid model or 
age-matched nontransgenic littermates are plotted. Z-score represents the number of standard deviations by which a sample’s expression level for a gene 
differs from the mean expression level for that gene across all samples. For human genes lacking clear mouse orthologues, suitable mouse homologues 
were selected. (B) This simplified schematic depicts how selected proteins encoded by AD risk genes (red, bold font) participate in pathways for microglial 
uptake and cellular activation. Lipoproteins containing apoE or apoJ may convey Aβ to microglia for uptake and degradation or may bind to TREM2 and 
stimulate ITAM-mediated cellular activation leading to chemotaxis, phagocytosis, survival, and transcription.

compromised in mice lacking one or both copies of Trem2, 
as well as in human AD tissues from TREM2 R47H carriers 
(Condello et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2016). 
A halo of soluble, oligomeric Aβ (the form currently thought 
to exert the most toxic effects on neurons) likely exists around 
amyloid plaques. Thus, the compaction of protofibrillary Aβ 
into a dense core plaque, which requires apoE and is promoted 
by TREM2 (Bales et al., 1997b, 1999; Bien-Ly et al., 2012; 
Wang et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2016), could be a protective 
mechanism that limits neurotoxicity of amyloid deposits 
once they start to build up in the aging brain. Collectively, 
the TREM2 studies suggest several mechanisms by which 
microglia can protect from accumulation of toxic Aβ species 
and development of AD: uptake and clearance of soluble Aβ 
species, phagocytosis of insoluble fibrillar Aβ deposits, induc-
tion of the activated state and chemotaxis, and compaction and 
corralling of amyloid plaques (Fig. 2).
Potential involvement of other AD risk 
genes in microglial function
Many AD risk genes besides TREM2 are preferentially or selec-
tively expressed in microglia (e.g., CD33, INPP5D, MS4A6A, 
and PLCG2) and therefore could impinge on the same microg-
lial activities and pathways regulated by TREM2. Furthermore, 
several AD risk genes that have been studied in neurons in the 
context of APP trafficking, Aβ production, or tau pathology 
should also be considered for potential roles in microglia, given 
their pattern of microglial expression (i.e., SORL1, PIC 
ALM, 
CD2AP, BIN1, PTK2B, and ABCA7; Fig. 1 A and Table 1).
TREM2 signaling involves recruitment of tyrosine ki-
nase SYK to the phosphorylated ITAM (immunoreceptor 
tyrosine-based activation motif) of DAP12 and thereby acti-
vates downstream effectors such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase 
(PI3K) and Ca2+ signaling (Fig. 1 B). INPP5D, which encodes 
the lipid phosphatase SHIP1, is another AD risk gene prefer-
entially expressed in microglia. SHIP1 dephosphorylates phos-
phatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 
(3,4)-bisphosphate at the plasma membrane, altering the out-
comes of PI3K activation. SHIP1 is involved in a clathrin- 
independent mode of receptor endocytosis (Boucrot et al., 
2015) and inhibits phagocytosis in macrophages (Cox et al., 
2001; Kamen et al., 2007). SHIP1 can interact with the phos-
phorylated ITAM of DAP12, so it may also moderate TREM2 
signaling by competing with SYK and PI3K for ITAM occu-
pancy (Peng et al., 2010). The AD-associated INPP5D SNP 
(rs35349669) increases INPP5D gene expression in whole 
blood (Jansen et al., 2017). If this relationship between geno-
type and expression level holds true in microglia, then it might 
explain the elevated AD risk, because higher SHIP1 level would 
dampen microglial activation and phagocytosis.
Figure 2. Depiction of microglial cellular activities related to β-amyloid pathology. The left side illustrates protective microglial activities that limit disease 
progression. Microglia may clear Aβ peptides via macropinocytosis of soluble Aβ (1; Mandrekar et al., 2009), uptake of lipoprotein-associated Aβ (2), or 
phagocytosis of fibrillar Aβ aggregates (3). Microglia also help corral larger deposits of Aβ in plaques (4), minimizing damage to the adjacent neuropil. 
The right side illustrates disease states when microglial containment mechanisms are defective or outstripped. Aβ fibrils on the outskirts of plaque act as 
substrate for additional Aβ fibrillization and a reservoir of toxic Aβ species that induce neuritic dystrophy (5). Microglia can secrete factors that activate 
astrocytes (6) and participate in amyloid-dependent synapse loss (7). See also Fig. 3.

Opposing the activity of ITAM receptors and SYK are 
the inhibitory receptors, which contain ITIM (immunoreceptor 
tyrosine-based inhibitory motif) domains that recruit tyrosine 
phosphatases. One such ITIM-containing receptor is encoded 
by the AD risk gene CD33, a member of the SIG 
LEC (sialic 
acid–binding immunoglobulin-type lectins) family of receptors. 
The protective SNP alters CD33 mRNA splicing such that the 
extracellular sialic acid–binding domain is lost from the final 
protein (Malik et al., 2013, 2015; Raj et al., 2014). The CD33 
genotype–phenotype relationship nicely aligns with that of 
TREM2: the TREM2 R47H mutation (which increases AD risk) 
reduces TREM2–ligand binding and ITAM signaling and im-
pairs phagocytosis, whereas the CD33 variant (which reduces 
AD risk) prevents the CD33–ligand interaction and presumably 
ITIM signaling and promotes phagocytosis (Bradshaw et al., 
2013; Griciuc et al., 2013).
Given the genetic evidence that microglia help reduce 
the incidence of AD, a critical question is whether microglia 
also restrain AD progression and at which stages of disease. A 
combined analysis of neuroimaging and genetic data found an 
association between a polymorphism in the IL1RAP gene and 
increased rate of Aβ accumulation in human brains of both AD 
and non-AD subjects (measured by Aβ-binding positron emis-
sion tomography tracer; Ramanan et al., 2015). Carriers of the 
IL1RAP polymorphism also showed reduced signal for microg-
lial activation using a TSPO (translocator protein)-binding pos-
itron emission tomography tracer, as well as an increased rate of 
temporal lobe atrophy and higher likelihood of progression from 
mild cognitive impairment to AD. Another study that divided 
AD subjects into fast decliners and slow decliners measured a 
higher TSPO signal in the brains of slow decliners, consistent 
with a protective role for microglial activation even in stages of 
AD when dementia is evident (Hamelin et al., 2016). Human 
microglia in aged brains or in the vicinity of tau pathology may 
exhibit dystrophic, fragmented morphology, further suggesting 
that AD develops in the context of reduced neuroprotective mi-
croglial function (Streit et al., 2004, 2009).
Detrimental activities of microglia in AD
Although human genetic data argue that proper microglial 
function protects against AD, there is plentiful evidence that 
unbridled microglia activity can be harmful to neurons in neu-
rodegenerative disease. Amyloid plaques appear a decade or 
two before clinical symptoms of AD, but it is tau pathology 
and synapse loss that correlate best with cognitive impairment 
during disease progression (Jack et al., 2010). In this section, we 
discuss how microglia can directly mediate synapse loss (Wu et 
al., 2015; Spangenberg and Green, 2017) and exacerbate tau pa-
thology (Leyns and Holtzman, 2017). Moreover, activated mi-
croglia can secrete toxic factors to directly or indirectly injure 
neurons (Colonna and Butovsky, 2017; Liddelow et al., 2017).
Microglia, complement, and synapse engulf-
ment. 
 During normal brain development, mounting evidence 
indicates that microglia engulf synapses and sculpt synaptic 
connections via a novel role for complement, a component of 
the innate immune system that enhances the clearance of mi-
crobes or damaged cells by phagocytes (Boulanger, 2009; 
Stephan et al., 2012; Chung et al., 2015). Synapse pruning by 
microglia involves the classical pathway of complement, which 
normally functions to clear pathogens and apoptotic cells after 
binding of complement protein C1q (Fig. 3 A). Studies of C1q, 
C4, C3, and CR3 knockout mice suggest that the mechanism of 
developmental synapse pruning in the retinogeniculate system 
involves C1q tagging of synapses, opsonization of synapses by 
C3b, and subsequent phagocytosis of synapses by microglia 
(Stevens et al., 2007; Schafer et al., 2012; Sekar et al., 2016; 
Fig. 3 A). Synaptic material is observed within microglia by 
light microscopy, and this synapse engulfment is reduced in C3 
or CR3 knockout mice (Schafer et al., 2012). Microglial engulf-
ment of synapses likely varies with different developmental 
stages, brain regions, and disease states. For example, electron 
microscopy studies have detected engulfed synaptic material in 
the developing hippocampus (Paolicelli et al., 2011), but not in 
the hippocampus of adult mice undergoing synapse loss caused 
by prion disease (Sisková et al., 2009; Caleo et al., 2012).
Given the emerging role of complement proteins in devel-
opmental synapse pruning, it is interesting that AD-associated 
genes include CR1 (complement receptor 1), which plays roles 
in phagocytosis, clearing of immune complexes, and inhibition 
of complement (Khera and Das, 2009; Fonseca et al., 2016), 
and CLU/apoJ, which reportedly can function as an inhibitor 
of the terminal complement complex (Murphy et al., 1989; 
Tschopp et al., 1993; McDonald and Nelsestuen, 1997). Inter-
estingly, in knock-in mice expressing human apoE variants, the 
apoE4 risk allele increases C1q accumulation relative to apoE2 
(Chung et al., 2016). The complement system is also impli-
cated by human genetics as a cause of other nervous system 
disorders that feature neurodegeneration. A heightened risk of 
schizophrenia is associated with increased copy number and 
expression of complement factor C4A (Sekar et al., 2016), and 
genetic variants in complement proteins and regulators (most 
notably CFH) that lead to increased complement activity are 
highly associated with age-related macular degeneration (Klein 
et al., 2005; Boyer et al., 2017). Thus, human genetics point to 
excessive activation of the complement system as a cause of 
degeneration of neural tissue.
In human AD brain tissue, there is considerable immuno-
histochemical evidence for activation of complement, especially 
associated with plaques (C1q, C3, and C4) and to a lesser extent 
with neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neurites (C5b-C9; 
Zanjani et al., 2005). C1q is expressed in the adult brain, and 
protein levels rise steeply with aging, especially in the hippo-
campus (Stephan et al., 2013). Mouse models of β-amyloidosis 
exhibit elevated C1q levels, with increased synaptic localization 
of C1q even before plaques have formed (Hong et al., 2016). 
Although the binding partner for C1q at synapses that leads to 
activation of the C1 complex during synapse pruning remains 
unknown, it is noteworthy that C1q binding to Aβ can trigger 
activation of the classical complement cascade (Jiang et al., 
1994; Rosen and Stevens, 2010). Genetic knockout of C1q or 
neutralizing antibodies against C1q protect against synapse loss 
observed in amyloid-bearing mice or induced by injected Aβ 
(Fonseca et al., 2004; Hong et al., 2016). Notably, C1q knock-
out, which affects the classical pathway of complement initi-
ation, does not impact amyloid burden, so C1q appears to act 
downstream of Aβ (Fonseca et al., 2004, 2017). Knockout or 
inhibition of C3, which should block all pathways of comple-
ment activation, is also reported to provide neuroprotection (Shi 
et al., 2015, 2017a; Hong et al., 2016; for different results, see 
Wyss-Coray et al., 2002; Maier et al., 2008), though it appears 
to increase amyloid burden (Wyss-Coray et al., 2002; Maier et 
al., 2008; Shi et al., 2017a). Thus, in addition to mediating neu-
ronal damage, C3 activation may be involved in clearance of 
plaque via classical pathway-independent mechanisms.
 Alzheimer’s disease: A microglial conundrum • Hansen et al.

Microglia are likely key players in complement-mediated 
synapse loss in AD: they are the main source of C1q in the brain 
(Fonseca et al., 2017), they phagocytose synapses via CR3 
during development (Schafer et al., 2012), and they express the 
C3a and C5a receptors that trigger inflammation in response 
to complement activation. Treatment with CSF1R inhibitors to 
deplete microglia or disable their proliferation protects against 
synapse loss and rescues behavioral deficits in amyloidosis 
mouse models (Olmos-Alonso et al., 2016; Spangenberg et 
al., 2016). Unlike with synapse loss, the formation and main-
tenance of β-amyloid plaques in amyloidosis models does not 
seem to be affected by CSF1R inhibition or other methods of 
microglia depletion (Grathwohl et al., 2009; Olmos-Alonso et 
al., 2016; Spangenberg et al., 2016). However, longer periods 
of depletion may be necessary to observe such an effect, and a 
study that used time-lapse imaging to track individual plaques 
in vivo reported that plaque size increased ∼13% over 1 wk 
in microglia-depleted brains (Zhao et al., 2017). Overall, the 
findings imply that synapse loss around plaques is dynami-
cally regulated by microglia and can be potentially rescued 
by microglia depletion despite no change or possible increase 
in amyloid plaque size.
Thus, although there are conflicting results, most pub-
lished studies in amyloidosis mouse models suggest that de-
pleting microglia and blocking complement pathway activation 
may have beneficial effects in AD, at least in terms of synapse 
and neuron loss (Fig. 3 B). A harmful role for activated mi-
croglia may be a broad feature of neurodegenerative disease, 
as microglia and the complement pathway can also mediate 
synapse loss in other mouse models of neurodegeneration, in-
cluding progranulin-deficient frontotemporal dementia (Lui 
et al., 2016), virus-induced cognitive impairment (Vasek et 
Figure 3. Summary of studies manipulating the complement system or depleting microglia in mouse models of AD. (A) Simplified schematic of the comple-
ment pathway illustrating selected proteins. The complement system can be initiated by the classical, lectin, or alternative pathways. Central to complement 
activation is the cleavage of C3. Effects downstream of C3 cleavage include (1) phagocytosis after recognition of C3b opsonized material by complement 
receptors, including CR3 (inset); (2) inflammatory signaling by C3a and C5a fragment activation of C3aR and C5aR; and (3) lysis via formation of the 
C5b-C9 membrane attack complex. In the brain, microglia (yellow) mediate phagocytosis and respond to inflammatory signaling, and are also the cell 
type that produces C1q. Complement proteins demonstrated to play a role in synapse removal during developmental refinement of retinal ganglion cell

ation (Ding et al., 2014), and CNS systemic lupus erythemato-
sus (Bialas et al., 2017).
Microglia and tau pathology. 
 Complement activa-
tion appears to exacerbate tau pathology in AD mouse models, 
though the mechanisms are unclear (Fig. 3 C). C3 inhibition by 
transgenic expression of a soluble form of the mouse comple-
ment inhibitory protein Crry (Britschgi et al., 2012) or C5aR 
antagonism (Fonseca et al., 2009) reduced the extent of tau pa-
thology. Knockout of CD59, a protein that inhibits C5b-9 mem-
brane attack complex formation, worsened pathology in a tau 
mouse model (Britschgi et al., 2012).
Studies in a mouse model of tauopathy initiated via viral 
expression of mutant tau have implicated microglia in the cell-
to-cell spread of tau pathology across the brain, possibly me-
diated by microglial uptake and exosomal release of tau (Asai 
et al., 2015). Deleting the microglial protein Cx3cr1 in trans-
genic tau models showed that genetically enhanced microglial 
activation accelerated the onset and progression of tau pathol-
ogy (Bhaskar et al., 2010; Maphis et al., 2015). Interestingly, 
whereas a reduction in plaque load was observed with Cx3cr1 
knockout in amyloid models (Lee et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010), 
this was reportedly accompanied by increased proinflammatory 
cytokines, tau pathology, and functional deficits (Cho et al., 
2011; Lee et al., 2014). Finally, a recent study in PS19 mice ex-
pressing the human tau P301S mutant transgene (Yoshiyama et 
al., 2007) and lacking murine Apoe showed that human apoE4 
expression exacerbated tau pathology and heightened the mi-
croglial response compared with PS19 mice expressing apoE2, 
apoE3, or no apoE (Shi et al., 2017b). This suggested that be-
sides the well-known effects of apoE4 on amyloid accumula-
tion, apoE4 may contribute to AD pathogenesis by exacerbating 
neuroinflammation and tau pathology.
Recent studies of TREM2 function in mouse models of 
tau pathology reported seemingly conflicting roles, with Trem2 
deletion appearing neuroprotective in the PS19 model (Leyns 
et al., 2017) but neurotoxic in the hTau model (Bemiller et al., 
2017), which expresses the entire human MAPT gene from a 
P1-derived artificial chromosome in a Mapt-deficient back-
ground (Andorfer et al., 2003). However, the studies did not 
analyze similar stages of disease. The study in the hTau model 
looked at 6 mo (long before neuronal loss) and observed greater 
tau phosphorylation and aggregation in TREM2-deficient mice, 
arguing for an early protective role of TREM2 in restraining 
propagation of tauopathy (Bemiller et al., 2017). The PS19 
study looked at 9 mo, when neurodegeneration is extensive, and 
observed preservation of piriform and entorhinal cortex volume 
in mice lacking TREM2, whereas tau phosphorylation and ag-
gregation were unchanged (Leyns et al., 2017). The latter study 
suggested that TREM2 may enable the phagocytosis by microg-
lia of stressed but viable neurons, a process termed phagoptosis 
(Brown and Neher, 2014).
Microglia and neurotoxic inflammatory signal-
ing. 
 In addition to damaging neurons through phagocytosis of 
synapses and worsening tau pathology, microglia can also react 
to protein aggregates and dying neurons in a proinflammatory 
fashion, thereby causing harm to neurons via release of inflam-
matory mediators. β-Amyloid aggregates/fibrils can act as dis-
ease-associated molecular patterns and stimulate Toll-like 
receptors (TLRs) and the NRLP3 inflammasome (Heneka et al., 
2013, 2015), resulting in microglial production of TNFα, IL-1β, 
and other inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with a pathogenic 
role for cytokine release, the exacerbation of tau pathology in 
Cx3cr1 knockout mice was blocked with IL-1 antagonists 
(Bhaskar et al., 2010; Maphis et al., 2015), and harmful effects 
of apoE4 in the context of tau pathology were associated with 
increased TNFα production by microglia in vitro (Shi et al., 
2017b). Genetic deletion of NLRP3, caspase-1 and TLRs have 
been reported to ameliorate Aβ deposition and cognitive deficits 
in amyloidosis mouse models, supporting the idea that “classi-
cal” inflammation exacerbates AD pathogenesis (Heneka et al., 
2015). In this context, it is consistent that TREM2 signaling, 
which is protective against AD based on human genetics, curbs 
TLR signaling in macrophages (Hamerman et al., 2006; Turn-
bull et al., 2006). In contrast, the induction of Tnf and Il1b in the 
brains of amyloidosis mice is dampened in TREM2-deficient 
mice (Wang et al., 2015; Jay et al., 2017a), which is more in 
keeping with the idea that TREM2 is required for a full inflam-
matory response by microglia to β-amyloid.
Consistent with a deleterious role for microglia and in-
flammation, a recent study using transgenic mice showed that 
microglial proliferation and activation induced by a BRAF 
mutation restricted to erythromyeloid progenitors could drive 
late-onset neurodegeneration (Mass et al., 2017). Importantly, 
microglia proliferation preceded neuron loss, and microglia 
from the mutant mice as well as from brain tissue of patients with 
BRAF mutation–associated neurodegenerative disease showed 
increased inflammatory cytokine expression (Mass et al., 2017).
Microglia can also act in concert with astrocytes to cause 
neuronal injury. A triad of factors released by activated microg-
lia (IL-1α, TNFα, and C1q) is necessary and sufficient to induce 
astrocytes into a neurotoxic state termed “A1” that causes neu-
ronal death (Liddelow et al., 2017). A1 astrocytes are found in 
tau transgenic mice expressing human apoE4 (Shi et al., 2017b) 
and are reportedly found in CNS tissue from patients with vari-
ous neurodegenerative diseases, including AD (Liddelow et al., 
2017). Notably, A1 astrocytes show strongly induced expres-
sion of complement proteins C1r, C1s, C3, and C4 (Zamanian 
et al., 2012). Thus, astrocytes could cooperate with microglia to 
mediate complement-dependent neurotoxicity.
Microglial activation states defined by 
transcriptional profiling
Elucidating the different functional states of microglia, which 
may exist at different stages of AD or coexist in the same stage, 
is crucial to understanding the role of microglia in neurodegen-
eration. mRNA profiles of microglia sorted by flow cytome-
try from the brains of β-amyloid mouse models show marked 
changes in expression of hundreds of genes (Orre et al., 2014; 
Wang et al., 2015; Srinivasan et al., 2016; Keren-Shaul et al., 
2017). These studies point to a disease-associated microglial 
(DAM) state in which expression of a “homeostatic” gene set 
is reduced (e.g., Cx3cr1, P2ry12, and Tmem119) and another 
set of “neurodegeneration” genes is highly induced (e.g., Apoe, 
Axl, Csf1, Clec7a, Cst7, Igf1, Itgax/CD11c, Lilrb4, Lpl, and 
some major histocompatibility complex class II genes). Ana-
lyzing activated microglia as a separate population or by sin-
gle-cell RNA-sequencing also reveals subtle (two- to threefold) 
increases in Trem2 and Tyrobp mRNAs (Kamphuis et al., 2016; 
Keren-Shaul et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2017). Notably, DAM cells 
increase in number with progression of amyloidosis, lie spatially 
close to amyloid plaque, and show evidence of Aβ uptake. In-
formatics analysis of DAM genes highlights lysosomal, phago-
cytosis, lipid metabolism, and immune response pathways.
 Alzheimer’s disease: A microglial conundrum • Hansen et al.
467
The DAM gene expression signature overlaps significantly 
with changes in microglial mRNA profiles observed in other neu-
rodegeneration-related models including PS19 tau transgenic, 
SOD1-G93A transgenic, and aged mice (Chiu et al., 2013; Holt-
man et al., 2015; Friedman et al., 2017; Keren-Shaul et al., 2017). 
In β-amyloid models, the induction of DAM genes depends in 
large part on TREM2, arguing that the DAM profile reflects a 
protective state of microglia (Wang et al., 2015; Keren-Shaul et 
al., 2017); however, this is debatable, because TREM2 facilitates 
neurodegeneration in the PS19 model (Leyns et al., 2017) and is 
presumably required for the up-regulation of DAM genes in that 
model (Friedman et al., 2017). In fact, a recent transcriptomic 
study of the apoE–TREM2 microglial signaling axis posited that 
this neurodegeneration-related transcriptional response is detri-
mental (Krasemann et al., 2017). Further studies are needed to 
clarify whether the TREM2-dependent transcriptional response 
is helpful, damaging, or incidental in different disease contexts.
Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis provides a power-
ful method to uncover the heterogeneity of functional states 
within a cell population. This method showed that that TREM2- 
deficient microglial cells in plaque-ridden brains displayed an 
intermediate state of activation between “homeostatic” microg-
lia and fully activated DAM cells (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017). 
In a meta-analysis of microglial transcriptomic profiles from 
various models of CNS diseases (neurodegenerative, demye-
linating, ischemic, infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic), 
we identified several modules of coordinately regulated genes, 
including a neurodegeneration-associated module highly simi-
lar to the DAM genes mentioned previously (Friedman et al., 
2017). Using these modules to probe the single-cell expression 
data of Keren-Shaul et al. (2017), we revealed a unique subset 
of microglia, distinct from the DAM cells, that expressed an 
interferon-related gene module and increased numerically in 
brains with β-amyloid pathology (Friedman et al., 2017). The 
functional role of this microglial subclass is unclear.
Because of practical challenges with postmortem human 
tissue, studies of microglial gene expression in purified mi-
croglia or at the single-cell level from AD brains have lagged 
behind. Nonetheless, the induction of neurodegeneration- 
associated genes found in AD mouse models has been observed 
in bulk human AD brain tissue, albeit more subtle in nature 
(Friedman et al., 2017). More interestingly, an LPS-specific 
gene cluster, which was not induced in mouse models of neu-
rodegeneration, showed higher expression in AD brains than in 
control brains (Friedman et al., 2017), suggesting that microglia 
in human AD could have more severe inflammatory activation 
than in AD mouse models.
Expression profiles of microglia purified from human 
brains will be needed to understand the state of microglia in 
human AD, ideally at different stages of disease (including 
presymptomatic) and from different genotypes (e.g., APOE). 
RNA-sequencing studies of human microglia isolated from 
non-AD brain tissue (Galatro et al., 2017; Gosselin et al., 2017) 
showed broad similarity with mouse microglial gene expression 
profiles, although there were many differences such as higher 
expression of the C2 and C3 complement genes in human mi-
croglia. There was surprisingly limited overlap, however, in 
microglial genes regulated by aging in human versus mouse 
(Grabert et al., 2016; Galatro et al., 2017), which underscores 
the importance of studying human microglia to understand 
the pathomechanisms of AD.
Conclusion
Microglia have recently emerged as crucial players in the patho-
genesis of late onset AD, but exactly how they are involved in the 
disease mechanism is not settled. The preponderance of human 
genetics evidence, exemplified by the large effect of loss-of-
function TREM2 mutations on AD risk and on microglial func-
tion, argues that microglia have a protective function that lowers 
the incidence of AD. Conversely, there is also considerable ev-
idence that microglia are responsible for neuronal damage in 
AD (albeit mostly in mouse models). In particular, microglia 
may engulf and remove synapses via a complement-dependent 
mechanism, and the induction of a microglial proinflammatory 
state may correlate with severity of neurodegeneration. Tran-
scriptional profiling of microglial gene expression suggests that 
different states of microglial activation may occur during the 
course of AD, but more precise characterization—temporal, an-
atomical, and functional—is needed.
To synthesize the findings from disparate approaches, 
we propose the following hypothesis: Microglial function 
is normally protective in the brain, with microglia acting as 
housekeeping phagocytes to maintain tissue homeostasis and 
keep the extracellular space clean of Aβ, thereby preventing 
AD. When Aβ levels accumulate, microglia phagocytose and 
clear Aβ aggregates, and when outstripped in this activity, 
microglia compact Aβ aggregates in dense core plaques and 
shield them off from neurons. These latter protective activi-
ties involve activation of microglia to a DAM state, depend on 
TREM2, and are aided by apoE. Sometimes, because of aging 
or genetic susceptibility, microglial function becomes inad-
equate to prevent the onset and progression of AD. As toxic 
amyloid species accumulate, tau pathology accrues in stressed 
or damaged neurons, inducing microglia into a nonconstruc-
tive and inflammatory state in which they eat synapses, secrete 
neurotoxic cytokines that injure neurons and abet in the spread 
of tau pathology. In such a model of disease pathogenesis, mi-
croglia have two faces, one beneficial and one harmful, with 
the detrimental microglia population appearing later in the 
disease course and coinciding with synapse loss and symp-
tomatic decline. If true, the double-edged sword of microglial 
function in AD will complicate therapeutic approaches that 
target microglia, because stimulation of microglial activity 
may be helpful at an early stage, to prevent AD before it is es-
tablished, but become detrimental later, when the disease has 
reached a highly inflamed, neurodegenerative stage.
