The capacity to store and return energy in legs and feet that behave like springs
is crucial to human running economy. Recent comparisons of shod and
barefoot running have led to suggestions that modern running shoes may actu-
ally impede leg and foot-spring function by reducing the contributions from
the leg and foot musculature. Here we examined the effect of running shoes
on foot longitudinal arch (LA) motion and activation of the intrinsic foot
muscles. Participants ran on a force-instrumented treadmill with and without
running shoes. We recorded foot kinematics and muscle activation of the
intrinsic foot muscles using intramuscular electromyography. In contrast to
previous assertions, we observed an increase in both the peak (flexor digi-
torum brevis þ60%) and total stance muscle activation (flexor digitorum
brevis þ70% and abductor hallucis þ53%) of the intrinsic foot muscles
when running with shoes. Increased intrinsic muscle activation corresponded
with a reduction in LA compression (225%). We confirm that running shoes
do indeed influence the mechanical function of the foot. However, our findings
suggest that these mechanical adjustments are likely to have occurred as a
result of increased neuromuscular output, rather than impaired control as pre-
viously speculated. We propose a theoretical model for foot–shoe interaction
to explain these novel findings.
1. Introduction
It has been suggested that humans may have evolved to run and have done so
for millions of years [1,2]. Hard surfaces have been encountered by humans
when running throughout evolution; however, the modern running environ-
ment, characterized by stiff, invariant substrates such as roads and footpaths,
has transformed at a far greater rate than evolution can progress [1–3]. The
apparent lack of natural variability in surface terrain and compliance that is
endemic in our modern running world is believed to have altered the bio-
mechanical demands of running [4,5], possibly contributing to the high
injury rate in those who habitually partake in this activity [6].
The human foot is the interface between the body and the ground. The unique
structure of the foot allows force produced by muscles of the lower limb to be
transmitted to the ground, to support body weight (BW) and also generate for-
ward propulsion [7,8]. A pronounced structural feature of the human foot is the
longitudinal arch (LA), which allows the foot to function in a spring-like
manner [1,2,9,10] in series with the entire lower limb [11,12]. The LA compresses
during early stance, absorbing mechanical energy as the ground reaction force
(GRF) increases. Presumably, the energy absorbed is stored within elastic struc-
tures supporting the arch [9,13,14]. In late stance, when GRF decreases, the
LA recoils, returning elastic energy to deliver power for propulsion [9]. Stiffness
of the LA is provided by passive ligamentous structures [9,14,15] acting in
parallel with the intrinsic foot muscles whose relative contribution is continually
adjusted by the central nervous system (CNS) in response to mechanosensory
stimuli [10,16]. This elegant arrangement allows the mechanical characteristics
of the foot to be rapidly adapted to loading or task demands [10] and is thought
to improve the efficiencyof human running, returning between 8% and 17% of the
mechanical energy required for one stride, via passive mechanisms alone [9,13].

 Footwear has provided mechanical and thermal protection
for human feet when running, for thousands of years [17].
The contemporary running shoe, however, was not invented
until the 1970s [18] and has evolved in parallel with the surge
in popularity of running as a recreational pursuit. A defining
characteristic of the modern running shoe is the thick visco-
elastic midsole that is designed to compress and rebound
when cyclically loaded and unloaded during running [19,20].
This design feature, generally referred to as cushioning,
allows the shoe to function in a similar ‘spring-like’ manner
to the lower limb and foot, absorbing the potentially harmful
impact transients that are encountered when the foot impacts
with the ground [21–24], while also returning some of this
energy to aid power generation for propulsion [25]. Another
key feature of the modern running shoe is the contoured mid-
sole, designed to provide external support and reduce
excessive strain on the muscles and ligaments of the LA [21].
However, despite the huge financial investment in the
development of running shoes, running injury rates remain
relatively unchanged over the last 40 years [6,26,27], leading
some to question the efficacy of modern running shoes in pre-
venting injury [3,28–31]. Some scholars have gone as far to
suggest that cushioned midsoles may actually hinder our run-
ning performance [3,28–30,32]. These scholars have speculated
that a thick cushioned interface between the runner and the
ground impairs mechanosensory feedback and therefore, the
inherent capacity of the CNS to contend with large impact
force transients via adjustments in leg- and foot-spring stiffness
[3,29,33]. Furthermore, it has been speculated that an apparent
reliance on the shoe to attenuate impact and provide mechan-
ical support for the LA may reduce the required contributions
from the foot and ankle musculature, precipitating foot and
ankle muscle weakness and predisposing a runner to injury
[28,31,34]. While there is some evidence that runners tend to
land differently when they run without shoes [28,35–38],
there is no evidence that shoes have a detrimental influence
on the spring-like function of the foot, or the contributions to
this function from foot and ankle musculature.
Despite the ongoing speculation as to the potential benefits
and detrimental effects that modern running shoes may have
on running mechanics, it is apparent that there is a dearth of
information pertaining to how the CNS regulates the spring-
like function of the foot during shod running. Therefore, the
aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that running
shoes impair the spring-like function of the foot, thereby alter-
ing the required force contribution from the intrinsic foot
muscles to actively support the LA during running. In order
to test this hypothesis, we had participants run on a force-
instrumented treadmill barefoot and wearing running shoes.
In addition to the GRF, electromyograms (EMG) were recorded
from the intrinsic foot muscles and ankle plantar flexors,
whereas motion capture data were recorded to assess foot
and ankle kinematics during multiple consecutive strides.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Sixteen healthy participants (seven females mean+standard
deviation (s.d.) for age 19+1 years; height: 165+4 cm; mass:
59+7 kg, nine males age 24+5 years; height: 172+4 cm; mass:
73+10 kg) with no history of lower limb injury in the previous
six months or known neurological impairment volunteered to
participate in the study. All participants were habitually shod rec-
reational runners. Foot-strike technique (i.e. rear-foot or forefoot)
was not applied as an inclusion or exclusion criteria; however,
none of the participants recruited for this study displayed a fore-
foot running technique when either shod or barefoot. Written
informed consent was obtained from each subject.
3. Experimental protocol
Following a 3 min warm up period and familiarization pro-
cedure, participants ran on a force-instrumented treadmill
(AMTI, force-sensing tandem treadmill, Watertown, MA) at
14 km h21 while barefoot and shod. The running shoe
chosen for this study is described by the manufacturer as a
‘cushioned stability’ shoe, with a heel height of 30 mm and
forefoot
height
of
20 mm
(Asics
GT2000,
Asics
Corp.
Japan). The inner lining was made of soft, flexible foam. In
order to prevent rubbing against the intramuscular electro-
des, the raised edges of the inner lining were trimmed flat
and had no contact with the skin of the LA. Kinetic, kin-
ematic and EMG data were collected simultaneously with
approximately 15–20 strides (toe-off to ipsilateral toe-off)
being recorded for each condition (barefoot and shod).
4. Data acquisition
4.1. Kinematic and kinetic measurements
Three-dimensional motion of the foot and shank, and GRF data
were collected during each running trial. Retroreflective mar-
kers (9.0 mm diameter) were secured on the skin of the right
foot, overlying the medial and lateral malleoli, posterior calca-
neus, navicular tuberosity and head of the first and fifth
metatarsals, in order to quantify motions of the foot segments
and the LA (figure 1). Additional markers were applied to the
medial and lateral femoral condyles, and a rigid cluster of four

ematic data. White markers are removed following a static calibration trial, with
the cluster of four markers on a rigid plastic shell used to track the motion of
the shank. The posterior calcaneus marker cannot be viewed in this image.

 markers was placed on the anterolateral aspect of the shank.
During a standing calibration trial, markers located on the seg-
ment endpoints were used to generate a two-segment model of
the shank and foot. Following the calibration trial, the medial
and lateral knee markers were removed, and the motion of
the shank was tracked with the rigid marker cluster. In order
to allow foot marker positions to be captured during the
shod condition, circular holes of 25 mm diameter were cut in
the shoe upper in positions corresponding to the foot marker
locations. This allowed visualization of the markers, while
still allowing markers to be adhered to the skin. Markers
were adhered with double-sided adhesive and further secured
with cohesive bandage, allowing secure positioning for both
the shod and barefoot conditions.
Kinematic data were captured at 200 Hz using an eight
camera
three-dimensional
optoelectronic
motion
capture
system (Qualisys, Gothenburg, Sweden), whereas GRF and
EMG data were synchronously captured at 4000 Hz via a
14-bit analogue-to-digital converter (Qualisys). Kinematic,
force and EMG data were collected simultaneously and syn-
chronized using the Qualisys TRACK MANAGEMENT software
from the same company.
4.2. Electromyography
Identification of the abductor hallucis (AH) and flexor digi-
torum brevis (FDB) muscles was conducted using real-time
B-mode ultrasound imaging (10 MHz linear array, Ultrasonix
RP, USA) in the right foot of each subject. Subsequently,
bipolar fine-wire electrodes (0.051 mm stainless steel, Teflon-
coated, Chalgren, USA) with a detection length of 2 mm and
interelectrode distance of 2 mm were inserted using delivery
needles (0.5 � 50 mm) into the muscle tissue of AH and FDB
under ultrasound guidance, in accordance with previously
described methods [39]. Sterile techniques were used for the
insertion of all wires. Surface EMG data were collected from
the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and soleus (SOL) from the
right leg of all participants using Ag–AgCl electrodes with a
diameter of 10 mm and an interelectrode distance of 20 mm
(Tyco Healthcare Group, Neustadt, Germany). A surface refer-
ence electrode (10 mm diameter, Ag/AgCl, Tyco Healthcare
Group) was placed over the right fibula head. Prior to electrode
placement, the areas of the leg corresponding to the electrode
placement sites were shaved, lightly abraded and cleaned
with isopropyl alcohol.
All EMG signals were amplified 1000 times and recorded
with a bandwidth of 30–1000 Hz (MA300, Motion Labs, LA).
In order to minimize movement artefacts, the fine-wire electro-
des, surface electrodes, connectors, cabling and pre-amplifiers
were secured with cohesive bandage around the foot and shank.
Prior to data collection, each participant was asked to per-
form foot manoeuvres known to activate each foot muscle
separately [16,40]. When predicted EMG patterns could be
detected, it was concluded that the fine-wire electrodes were in
the correct location. If not, the electrodes were withdrawn by
approximately 1 mm until appropriate activation patterns
could be detected and possible crosstalk excluded. In order to
ensure quality of the intramuscular EMG signal throughout the
experiment, signal quality was assessed following each exper-
imental condition using the same technique described above.
A Velcro strap was secured around the participant’s waist,
whichenabledtheEMGamplifierboxtobesecuredtothesubject
without interfering with their gait. A lightweight optical cable
connected the amplifier box to the analogue-to-digital converter.
5. Data analysis
Kinetic and kinematic data files were exported to VISUAL3D (C-
motion Inc., Germantown, MD) for analysis. Force plate data
recorded during each experimental trial was digitally filtered
with a recursive 35 Hz low-pass, fourth-order Butterworth
filter. A vertical GRF threshold was set to define each toe-off
as occurring when vertical GRF fell below 50 N, whereas foot
contact was defined as occurring when vertical force rose
above 50 N. Swing phase was defined as the period from
right toe-off to right foot contact, whereas stance phase
was defined as occurring between right foot contact and
right toe-off. One stride cycle was defined as occurring from
right toe-off to the subsequent right foot toe-off.
Subsequently, the magnitude of the vertical and antero-
posterior (A–P) components of the GRF was calculated and
normalized to body weight for each participant. Peak loading
rate was defined as the maximum value obtained from the
first derivative of the vertical GRF in the first 50 ms following
foot contact, whereas peak propulsive force was defined as
the peak positive value of the A–P component of the GRF.
Marker trajectories were digitally filtered with a recursive
20 Hz low pass, fourth-order Butterworth filter. Assumed
rigid segments were created for the shank and foot. Joint
rotations were calculated in accordance with International
Society of Biomechanics recommendations
(þy,
up;
þz,
medial; þx, anterior) with rotation about the z-axis—sagittal
plane motion, rotation about the x-axis—frontal plane motion
and rotation about the y-axis—transverse plane motion [41].
Ankle angle was defined as the angle of the foot segment rela-
tive to the shank, with plantar flexion reported as a positive
angular rotation. Ankle angle at contact was calculated as the
sagittal plane ankle angle at foot contact and ankle excursion
was calculated by subtracting the minimum ankle angle
during stance phase from the ankle contact angle. The LA
angle was defined as a sagittal planar angle created by
the bisection of a vector projecting from the medial malleolus
marker to the navicular marker and another vector projecting
from the head of the first metatarsal to the navicular marker
(figure 2). Thus, a decrease in LA angle is indicative of a
reduction in LA height. In order to describe the spring-like
behaviour of the LA during stance phase, measures of com-
pression and recoil were calculated. Compression of the LA
was defined as the reduction in LA angle (height) that occurs
owing to the application of load and was calculated by subtract-
ing the minimum LA angle during stance phase from the LA
angle at foot contact. LA recoil was defined as the increase in
LA angle (height) that occurs during unloading and was calcu-
lated by subtracting the minimal LA angle during stance phase
from the LA angle at toe-off.
Owing to technical difficulties associated with collecting
intramuscular EMG data from the foot muscles within a run-
ning shoe, complete sets of muscle activation data from AH
and FDB was only obtainable from 10 of the 16 participants,
whereas surface EMG data from MG and SOL were collected
from all participants. The EMG data were exported to SPIKE2
software (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK)
prior to analysis. All signals were high-pass filtered using a
recursive fourth-order Butterworth filter at 35 Hz to remove

 any unwanted low-frequency movement artefact. The EMG sig-
nals were then visually inspected in order to identify any
remaining artefact, which was defined as an abnormal spike
in the signal, typically associated with foot contact. Any such
remaining artefacts resulted in the EMG data for that particular
stride being excluded from further analysis. Following DC-
offset removal, root mean square (RMS) signal amplitude was
calculated using a moving window of 50 ms to generate an
EMG envelope. Subsequently, the EMG envelope for each
muscle was normalized to its peak amplitude found across all
conditions. Normalized peak EMG amplitude and total stance
activity (based on the EMG envelope) were calculated during
the stance phase for each stride cycle, allowing comparisons in
magnitude of stance phase muscle activation between shod
and unshod conditions. In order to provide insights into the
magnitude of activation relative to the time that a muscle is gen-
eratingforce, totalstancephase activity (%max s)wascalculated
by multiplying the mean normalized RMS signal amplitude
during stance (%max) by the mean stance phase duration (s)
for each muscle and condition [42,43].
For each individual, the kinematic, kinetic and EMG data
were averaged across a minimum of 10 stride cycles to form
individual variable means for each condition.
5.1. Statistics
Paired t-tests were used to describe the influence of running
shoes on stride temporal characteristics, peak vertical GRF,
peak loading rate, peak propulsive force, ankle contact angle,
ankle excursion, LA compression and recoil and peak muscle
activation. Statistical differences were established at p � 0.05.
Results are presented as mean+s.d., unless otherwise stated.
6. Results
6.1. Running mechanics
Shod running was typified by a longer stride duration (shod
0.68+0.03 s versus barefoot 0.65+0.03 s, p � 0.05) and
ground contact times (shod 0.21+0.01 s versus barefoot
0.18+0.01 s, p � 0.05). When running shod and barefoot,
participants produced comparable magnitudes of vertical
GRFs (shod 2.75+0.24 BWs versus barefoot 2.75+0.22 BW,
p ¼ 0.6); however, mean peak loading rate (shod 74.5+
10.0 BW s21 versus barefoot 86.4+14.2 BW s21) and mean
peak propulsive force (shod 0.41+0.05 BW versus barefoot
0.44+0.05 BW) were both reduced when running with
shoes (both p � 0.05, figure 3). Participants adjusted the
angular orientation of the ankle at foot contact depending on
the running condition ( p � 0.05), adopting a position of
slight dorsiflexion when running in shoes (2.0+2.88, range
27.18 to 1.98, figure 4), while they landed in a position of
slight plantar flexion when running barefoot (1.8+2.38,
range 25.38 to 4.78).
For shod and barefoot conditions, ankle dorsiflexion
occurred following forefoot contact in early stance, until
late stance when the ankle underwent rapid plantar flexion.
Ankle dorsiflexion excursion was significantly less when run-
ning with shoes (shod 14.8+4.68 versus barefoot 20.3 +6.88,
p � 0.05), owing to a more plantar flexed position of the ankle
at initial foot contact and similar peak dorsiflexion angles
during mid- to late-stance (figure 4).

cates arch compression, while an increase in arch angle indicates arch recoil.

 The LA compressed during early to mid-stance as the ver-
tical GRF was rising and recoiled during late stance as the
vertical GRF subsided (figure 4). The LA angle at foot contact
was similar for both conditions (shod 150.4+9.98 versus bare-
foot 151.0+9.68, p ¼ 0.4). However, when running with shoes,
participants displayed reduced magnitudes of both LA
compression (shod 8.6+4.68 versus barefoot 11.5+4.08 p �
0.05) and recoil (shod 15.4+5.78 versus barefoot 21.5+5.58,
p � 0.05) primarily owing to a combination of a lower
minimum LA angle at mid-stance and a higher LA angle at
propulsion (figure 4). When considered together, the reduction
in LA compression and similar peak GRFs, intimate that the LA
is stiffer in the shod condition.
6.2. Muscle activation
The FDB and AH muscles recorded intramuscularly, displayed
similar patterns of activation within each condition. Both
showed the periods of relative inactivity during swing
and large bursts of activity during stance (figure 4). Peak acti-
vation generally occurred during mid-stance for both muscles.
Total stance activity was higher when running with shoes, for
both FDB (shod 7.1+2.7%max s versus barefoot 4.2+
3.4%max s, p � 0.05) and AH (shod 6.3+2.0%max s versus
barefoot 4.1+1.8%max s, p � 0.05). Peak FDB activation was
greater when running with shoes, compared with barefoot
(shod 64.8+25.9% versus barefoot 40.7+19.0%, p � 0.05,
figure 4), whereas no consistent differences were observed
between the shod and unshod conditions for AH (shod
56.2+19.3% versus barefoot 45.4+19.3%, p ¼ 0.17, figure 4).
Soleus and MG muscles were both relatively quiescent
during early swing phase, with a large burst of activity that
commenced during terminal swing and peaked prior to
mid-stance (figure 4). Total stance activity was higher when
running with shoes, for both MG (shod 7.1+ 2.4%max s
versus barefoot 5.9+3.3%max s, p � 0.05) and SOL (shod
6.1+1.2%max s versus barefoot 5.0+0.7%max s, p � 0.05).
Peak MG activity was greater when running with shoes
(shod 65.6+ 15.4% versus barefoot 57.6+ 16.2%, p � 0.05,
figure 4), whereas no significant differences were observed
in SOL activity between the shod and unshod conditions
(shod 64.8+ 15.4% versus barefoot 59.0 +14.6%, p ¼ 0.09).
7. Discussion
This study provides us novel evidence of adjustments in the
mechanical function of the foot when comparing running in
shoes to barefoot. In line with our first hypothesis, running
with shoes led to a reduction in the magnitude of LA

 compression and recoil, suggesting that running shoes influ-
ence foot-spring function. Of particular interest was the
underlying mechanism for the observed alterations in LA
motion when running in shoes, which we believe is at least
partially driven by an increase in neuromuscular output,
rather than a decrease, as we originally hypothesized.
7.1. Stance phase
During stance, the lower limbs of human runners behave in
a spring-like manner, ‘compressing and recoiling’ via a
sequence of hip, knee and ankle joint flexion then extension
in phase with the increasing and decreasing magnitude of
the vertical GRF [12,44,45]. This highly efficient mechanism
allows recycling of elastic and kinetic energy during each
foot contact [11,46], while also allowing a relatively stable
centre of mass trajectory [45]. The CNS has the capacity to
adjust the stiffness of the lower limb in order to minimize
centre of mass vertical motion when running across terrains
with varying undulations [47] and compliance [45,48,49].
The foot is considered a key contributor to leg-spring func-
tion [9,10,12,13]; however, to date, we believe, the influence
of running shoes on the spring-like function of the foot has
not been reported.
Runners in our experiment displayed substantially less
arch compression and recoil when running with shoes, when
compared with barefoot. This finding is in line with the key
design features of running shoes that aim to provide support
for the LA and reduce strain on plantar soft-tissue structures
[50,51]. However, this finding also highlights that running
shoes may actually limit the capacity for the foot to store and
return energy via elastic mechanisms, owing to a reduction
in the magnitude of arch compression and recoil [13]. Recent
critiques of modern running footwear have argued that cush-
ioning and support characteristics of the shoe potentially
impair foot-spring function, with a likely consequence of
reduced activation from muscles that support the arch, leading
to their weakness and disuse atrophy [3,29,34]. Our findings
partially support this notion. However, the observed concomi-
tant increase in intrinsic foot muscle activation in shod running
appears to indicate that the reduced arch compression
observed when running with shoes may be driven by an
increase in muscle activation, rather than via the cushioning
and external support features of the running shoes.
In a recent series of experiments, we provided novel evi-
dence that the intrinsic foot muscles function in parallel with
the plantar aponeurosis, actively tuning the stiffness of the
LA in response to load during stance and locomotion
[10,16,39]. Employing intramuscular electrical stimulation to
activate individual intrinsic foot muscles, it was observed
that contraction of these muscles could produce a 5% increase
in arch height, reversing the compression of the LA that
occurred when the foot was loaded with forces equivalent
to body weight [16]. Given that the intrinsic foot muscles
are known to act in unison as a functional group [10,52], it
is likely that their combined action and the action of the
extrinsic muscles [53,54] may have a profound effect on LA
function. Therefore, when considering the findings of this
study with those of our earlier studies, it becomes apparent
that the observed increase in intrinsic foot muscle activation
when running with shoes, compared with barefoot, is likely
to be partially responsible for the concomitant reduction in
LA compression during stance.
Given that the LA acts asa spring with an activelyadjustable
stiffness [9] and running shoes with viscoelastic midsoles also
behave in a spring-like manner [23,25], the foot and shoe can
be modelled to behave as two springs acting either in parallel,
or in series, during the stance phase (figure 4). Modelling the
interaction between running shoes and the LA, potentially
allows us to reveal the underlying mechanism for the observed
increase in muscle activity when running in shoes. Within this
model, the LA behaves as a single spring of given stiffness
(kfoot) that is continually adjusted via activation of the muscles
that span the arch of the foot [16], in order to optimize forces
acting between the body and the ground. For example, intrinsic
foot muscle activation increases when running at faster vel-
ocities, stiffening the LA and thereby allowing greater forces
to be transmitted between the body and ground during shorter
ground contact periods [10]. When a runner wears shoes with a
viscoelastic midsole, the shoe will behave as an additional
spring, also with a given stiffness (kshoe, figure 5) and the
two form a foot–shoe system that has a stiffness (kFS) that is
dependent on the configuration of the two springs.
If the arch and shoe springs are modelled to be in parallel,
the net stiffness of the foot–shoe system (kFS) is the summed
stiffness of the LA (kfoot) and shoe (kshoe) springs acting together.
kFS ¼ kfoot þ kshoe:
Alternatively, if we model the foot and shoe as springs
acting in series, the net compliance (inverse of stiffness) of
the foot–shoe system (1/kFS) will be the common compliance
of the LA (1/kfoot) and shoe (1/kshoe) springs acting together.

To interpret both of these models with our data, we will
assume that the neuromuscular system seeks to maintain a

KFS. This assumption is based on a wealth of prior studies
showing that humans adjust muscle activations to maintain

Figure 5. Depiction of a parallel (a) and in-series (b) spring arrangement
between the longitudinal arch (LA) and running shoe. Both the LA and run-
ning shoe will behave in a spring-like manner during running, compressing
and recoiling as force is increased and decreased. If the LA and running shoe
act in-parallel, wearing a running shoe will increase the overall stiffness of
the foot–shoe system. If the LA and running shoe act in-series, wearing
a running shoe will increase the overall compliance of the foot–shoe
system. Based on the assumption that constant foot–shoe system stiffness
is favoured during steady-state running, the response of the intrinsic foot
muscles in regulating the stiffness of the arch will vary depending on
whether the longitudinal arch and running shoe behave in-parallel or
in-series. (Online version in colour.)

 constant system stiffness on surfaces of varied compliance
[45,48,55,56] and also when wearable devices are added to
the limb that influence system stiffness [57–59].
For our model of springs in parallel (kFS ¼ kfoot þ kshoe) if
a runner wears running shoes of a given stiffness, the
addition of the shoe spring will lead to an overall increase
in kFS. Thus, under the assumption that constant system stiff-
ness is beneficial during constant velocity running [45,48,60],
a reduction in LA stiffness is required in order to offset the
additional stiffness added by the shoe. Reduced LA stiffness
would be achieved by allowing greater arch compression,
presumably through a reduction in force output from the
arch musculature; neither of which were observed here.
If the model of springs in series is considered (1/kFS ¼ 1/
kfoot þ 1/kshoe) running in shoes with a viscoelastic midsole
will decrease kFS owing to the presence of an additional
spring. Therefore, an increase in LA stiffness is necessary to
increase overall system stiffness, maintaining constant kFS. An
increase in LA stiffness would require a reduction in LA com-
pression, which is achievable via an increase in force output
from the intrinsic foot muscles (increased activation) [10].
This is in line with our observations that intrinsic foot muscle
activation increased and LA compression decreased, when
running in shoes.
According to the above-mentioned scenarios that describe
the potential interactions between human feet and running
shoes, it seems that running shoes act as an additional
spring in-series with the foot. While we cannot discount
that deformation of the shoes may act to provide supporting
forces to LA, an in-series spring model provided a sound
mechanical rationale for our finding that running in shoes
induced an increase in muscle activation from two of the pri-
mary muscles within the LA. The incorporation of intrinsic
foot muscle activation data has therefore provided a unique
insight into the underlying mechanism for the observed
changes in LA function when running in shoes. Most impor-
tantly, these findings highlight that the alterations in lower
limb biomechanics observed when running in shoes are not
a result of reduced or impaired neuromuscular function.
The increase in ankle plantar flexor activation and
reduction in ankle dorsiflexion observed when our runners
were shod indicates that our runners may have also exhibited
an increase in ankle stiffness in response to the increased com-
pliance provided by the running shoe. Increased knee and
ankle stiffness has previously been observed when running
in shoes with viscoelastic midsoles [20,23] indicating that the
cushioning properties of shoes may induce similar mechanical
adaptations across the entire lower limb. This finding provides
further support for our model that describes running shoes as
springs acting in-series with the foot and leg. Furthermore,
these findings are in line with previous research describing
the in-series interaction between the lower limb and running
support surface [48], and the apparent increase in leg stiffness
that is observed when running on compliant surfaces [45,61].
7.2. Impact phase
The initial impact phase can be described to occur over the
first 50 ms of ground contact and involves the rapid decelera-
tion of the lower limb that occurs when the foot and ground
collide [62] with forces up to twice body weight being trans-
mitted at rates of up to 200 body weights per second [28,63].
Impact loading rates are considerably higher on stiff surfaces
such as concrete, which are endemic in our modern running
environment [64] and possibly contribute to the high preva-
lence of repetitive stress injury in runners [65]. The modern
running shoe been designed to reduce the rate of force
increase during the impact phase, thereby reducing the risk
of injury to the runner. However, a counter argument has
been raised that suggests that the presence of a cushioned
midsole lends to the adoption of a marked heel-first landing
pattern and a reliance on the shoe to attenuate impact, rather
than via the body’s natural shock absorbers: muscle and
tendon [28,29]. Within the current experiments, our runners
adopted a heel-strike pattern when running in shoes, while
they contacted the ground with their mid-foot when barefoot.
This finding is consistent with a number of previous compari-
sons of shod and un-shod running in runners who habitually
wear shoes, further confirming that runners generally impact
the ground differently when running in shoes when compared
with barefoot [4,5,28,63,66]. It has been reported that barefoot
runners tend to strike the ground with a forefoot first contact,
allowing the body to effectively damp the large impact transi-
ents [37,67,68] via controlled dorsiflexion of the ankle and the
associated stretch of the Achilles tendon [37]. Interestingly,
despite our runners adopting a more plantar flexed ankle pos-
ition when running without shoes, peak loading rates still
remained considerably higher. Thus, despite the modification
in landing mechanics, the magnitude of adaptation in our
habitually shod runners was insufficient to damp impacts in
a manner comparable to the cushioned running shoe. Further
research may elucidate if these observations persist across
habitually barefoot running populations.
7.3. Methodological considerations
There are some methodological considerations that should be
taken into account when considering these data. Within this
study, we have attributed the observed increase in LA stiff-
ness when running with shoes to an increase in intrinsic
foot muscle activation. It is likely that other muscles such
as the tibialis posterior and the long digital flexors may
have also contributed to the observed alteration in LA mech-
anics, as these muscles are also known to provide active
support for this structure [53,54,69,70].
Our measure of ‘total stance activation’ was calculated by
multiplying the average of the RMS signal envelope during
stance, by the stance phase duration for each condition.
This calculation was adopted to provide an indication of
the cost of muscle activation per step, taking into account
the differences in stance phase duration between conditions
[42,43]. Participants ran with a reduced cadence (longer
stride duration) when shod, and thus, it may be suggested
that the observed increase in total stance phase activation
when shod may be offset by fewer strides in a minute. How-
ever, within this study, this is not the case, as the difference in
cadence between the two conditions is considerably smaller
in magnitude than the difference in total stance activation.
Based on the data presented in the manuscript, the average
strides per minute for the barefoot condition is 92.3, whereas
for the shod condition, it is 88.2. If the total strides in a
minute are multiplied by the total stance activity for the
muscle with the smallest difference (AH), the shod condition
has approximately 46% more activation per minute than the
barefoot condition (shod 555.1 total stance activity min21 v
barefoot 378.4 total stance activity min21).

 In our discussion of the foot and shoe interaction, we have
made the assumption that constant leg stiffness is ideal
during steady-state running. This assumption is based on a
growing body of evidence that indicates the CNS will
adjust knee and ankle stiffness in order to maintain constant
COM
trajectory
[45,48,55,56].
Further
research
is
now
required to determine whether the foot behaves in series
with the ankle and knee to govern overall limb stiffness
during running, while also examining whether the observed
changes in LA stiffness during running are primarily owing
to an alteration in surface compliance.
8. Conclusion
In summary, we have described a novel mechanism for how
human feet interact with modern running shoes. An in-series,
spring-like arrangement of the foot and shoe dictates that the
reductionin systemstiffnessthat occurs when wearing arunning
shoewillneedtobeoffset byanincreaseinthestiffnessoftheLA,
in order to maintain constant foot–shoe system stiffness. The
observed increase in LA stiffness in response to mechanosensory
stimuli, is likely achieved via the observed increase in activation
from the intrinsic muscles of the arch. These findings further
highlight the highly adaptable nature of the human foot and
its importance in upright bipedal locomotion.
