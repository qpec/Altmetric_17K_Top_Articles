BACKGROUND
Trials of patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure to prevent recurrent stroke have been inconclusive. 
We investigated whether patients with cryptogenic stroke and echocardiographic features 
representing risk of stroke would benefit from PFO closure or anticoagulation, as compared 
with antiplatelet therapy.
METHODS
In a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, we assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, patients 16 to 
60 years of age who had had a recent stroke attributed to PFO, with an associated atrial septal 
aneurysm or large interatrial shunt, to transcatheter PFO closure plus long-term antiplatelet 
therapy (PFO closure group), antiplatelet therapy alone (antiplatelet-only group), or oral antico-
agulation (anticoagulation group) (randomization group 1). Patients with contraindications to 
anticoagulants or to PFO closure were randomly assigned to the alternative noncontraindi-
cated treatment or to antiplatelet therapy (randomization groups 2 and 3). The primary out-
come was occurrence of stroke. The comparison of PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy with 
antiplatelet therapy alone was performed with combined data from randomization groups 
1 and 2, and the comparison of oral anticoagulation with antiplatelet therapy alone was per-
formed with combined data from randomization groups 1 and 3.
RESULTS
A total of 663 patients underwent randomization and were followed for a mean (±SD) of 5.3±2.0 
years. In the analysis of randomization groups 1 and 2, no stroke occurred among the 238 
patients in the PFO closure group, whereas stroke occurred in 14 of the 235 patients in the an-
tiplatelet-only group (hazard ratio, 0.03; 95% confidence interval, 0 to 0.26; P<0.001). Proce-
dural complications from PFO closure occurred in 14 patients (5.9%). The rate of atrial fibrilla-
tion was higher in the PFO closure group than in the antiplatelet-only group (4.6% vs. 0.9%, 
P 
= 
0.02). The number of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the treatment 
groups (P 
= 
0.56). In the analysis of randomization groups 1 and 3, stroke occurred in 3 of 187 pa-
tients assigned to oral anticoagulants and in 7 of 174 patients assigned to antiplatelet therapy alone.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients who had had a recent cryptogenic stroke attributed to PFO with an associated 
atrial septal aneurysm or large interatrial shunt, the rate of stroke recurrence was lower among 
those assigned to PFO closure combined with antiplatelet therapy than among those assigned to 
antiplatelet therapy alone. PFO closure was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.

ase–control studies have shown an 
association between patent foramen ovale 
(PFO) and cryptogenic stroke, particularly 
among patients younger than 55 years of age and 
among patients with an associated atrial septal 
aneurysm or a substantial right-to-left interatrial 
shunt.1-6 The role of closure of PFO in preventing 
stroke recurrence in these patients remains un-
certain.7 Although it is plausible that closure of 
the defect could reduce the risk of recurrent 
stroke, several randomized trials have not shown 
the superiority of PFO closure over antithrom-
botic therapy.8-10
We performed the Patent Foramen Ovale Clo-
sure or Anticoagulants versus Antiplatelet Ther-
apy to Prevent Stroke Recurrence (CLOSE) trial 
to compare transcatheter closure of PFO plus 
long-term antiplatelet therapy with antiplatelet 
therapy alone and to compare oral anticoagulant 
therapy with antiplatelet therapy for the preven-
tion of stroke recurrence in patients, 16 to 60 years 
of age, who had had a recent cryptogenic stroke 
attributed to PFO with an atrial septal aneurysm 
or large right-to-left shunt.11
Methods
Study Design
This was an investigator-initiated, multicenter, 
randomized, open-label, superiority trial with 
three randomization groups. The trial was con-
ducted at 32 sites in France and at 2 sites in 
Germany from December 2007 through Decem-
ber 2016. The trial was approved by the Paris Ile de 
France IV ethics committee. All patients pro-
vided written informed consent. The Assistance 
Publique–Hôpitaux de Paris was responsible for 
the management and monitoring of the data. An 
independent data and safety monitoring board 
met periodically to assess safety and trial integ-
rity. The authors vouch for the completeness and 
accuracy of the data and analyses and for the 
fidelity of the trial to the protocol. The protocol 
and statistical analysis plan are available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
Patient Eligibility
Patients 16 to 60 years of age were eligible for 
the trial if they had had an ischemic stroke 
within the previous 6 months with no identifi-
able cause other than a PFO with an associated 
atrial septal aneurysm or large interatrial shunt. 
The investigations that were used to rule out 
alternative causes of strokes are shown in Table 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org. Long-term (≥30 days) electrocardio-
graphic monitoring was not performed. Findings 
from transthoracic and transesophageal echo-
cardiography were reviewed at a central location 
by two echocardiographers before patients were 
included in the trial. Atrial septal aneurysm was 
diagnosed on the basis of a septum primum 
excursion greater than 10 mm, as identified on 
transesophageal echocardiography.3 Large shunt 
was defined by the appearance of more than 30 
microbubbles in the left atrium within three 
cardiac cycles after opacification of the right 
atrium. Ischemic stroke was defined as acute 
focal neurologic symptoms with a recent cere-
bral infarct, as identified on brain imaging, re-
gardless of the duration of the symptoms.
Randomization
Eligible patients were randomly assigned, in a 
1:1:1 ratio, to undergo PFO closure followed by 
long-term antiplatelet therapy (PFO closure group), 
to receive antiplatelet therapy alone (antiplatelet-
only group), or to receive oral anticoagulation 
(anticoagulation group) (randomization group 1); 
randomization was performed with the use of 
dedicated Web-based software. Patients who had 
a contraindication to oral anticoagulation were 
randomly assigned to PFO closure plus antiplate-
let therapy (PFO closure group) or to antiplatelet 
therapy alone (antiplatelet-only group) (random-
ization group 2). Patients who had a contraindi-
cation to PFO closure were randomly assigned to 
anticoagulant therapy (anticoagulation group) 
or to antiplatelet therapy (antiplatelet-only group) 
(randomization group 3) (Fig. 1).12,13 Random-
ization was stratified according to participating 
center, randomization group, and type of septal 
anomaly (atrial septal aneurysm vs. large shunt) 
and was performed with the use of permuted 
blocks with varying block sizes.
Trial Treatments
Treatments were administered in an open-label 
fashion and were started as soon as possible, but 
in all cases within 3 weeks after randomization. 
PFO closure was performed by experienced inter-
ventional cardiologists who used implantable 
medical devices approved by the Interventional 
Cardiology Committee (see the Supplementary 
Appendix). All the patients who underwent PFO 
closure received dual antiplatelet therapy (75 mg

of aspirin plus 75 mg of clopidogrel per day) for 
3 months, followed by single antiplatelet therapy 
throughout the remainder of the trial. Patients 
assigned to oral anticoagulants could be treated 
with vitamin K antagonists (with a target inter-
national normalized ratio [INR] of 2 to 3) or 
with direct oral anticoagulants. Patients assigned 
to antiplatelet therapy alone or to PFO closure 
plus antiplatelet therapy could receive aspirin, 
clopidogrel, or aspirin combined with extended-
release dipyridamole (except for the 3 months 
after PFO closure during which time dual-anti-
platelet therapy was used).
Assessments
Study neurologists, who were aware of the 
treatment assignments, evaluated all patients at 
2 months, 6 months, and every 6 months there-
after until the end of the trial. At each visit, 
clinical outcomes, cardiac rhythm, adherence to 
trial treatment, blood pressure, smoking status, 
and INR values were recorded; cardiac rhythm 
was assessed by cardiac auscultation, which was 
followed by electrocardiography in the case of an 
abnormal auscultation result. The results of PFO 
closure were assessed with the use of contrast 
echocardiography 6 to 12 months after the pro-
cedure. Because the trial was prolonged beyond 
the planned duration of 5 years, patients who 
reached 5 years of follow-up were then followed 
by means of regular telephone interviews and 
were requested to continue their assigned treat-
ment until the end of the study. At each tele-
phone interview, the Questionnaire for Verifying 
Stroke-Free Status14 was administered to identify 
potential cerebrovascular events.
Outcomes
The primary efficacy outcome was the occur-
rence of fatal or nonfatal stroke. Secondary ef-
ficacy outcomes were the composite of ischemic 
stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic em-
bolism; disabling stroke; ischemic stroke; cere-
bral hemorrhage; transient ischemic attack; sys-
temic embolism; all-cause mortality; death from 
vascular-related causes; success of device implan-
tation; and success of PFO closure. Safety out-
comes were major or fatal procedural or hemor-
rhagic complications. A clinical events committee, 
whose members were unaware of the treatment 
assignments, independently adjudicated outcome 
events and assessed their severity (definitions of 
outcomes are provided in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Statistical Analyses
We calculated the sample size so that the study 
would have 80% power to detect a 50% lower 
annual rate of the primary outcome with PFO 
closure plus antiplatelet therapy or with oral 
anticoagulation than with antiplatelet therapy 
alone during a 2-year inclusion period and 3-year 
Figure 1. Randomization of Patients.
Of the 664 patients initially enrolled, 1 patient withdrew consent soon after randomization. According to French law, data concerning 
this patient cannot be used. Therefore, data from only 663 patients are presented. The patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure group com-
prised patients assigned to transcatheter PFO closure plus long-term antiplatelet therapy; the antiplatelet-only group, patients assigned 
to antiplatelet therapy alone; and the anticoagulation group, patients assigned to oral anticoagulation.

follow-up period, at an overall type 1 error rate 
of 5%. We used two one-sided superiority hypoth-
eses and Bonferroni adjustment, with an assumed 
correlation of 0.5 between the two test statistics. 
We estimated the total sample for this three-
randomization-group trial by calculating a theo-
retical sample for a fictitious two-randomization 
group trial, at a type 1 error rate of 0.035, and 
then multiplying the result by 1.5.15,16 An inflation 
factor of 1.05 was used to account for one 
planned interim analysis. Assuming an annual 
stroke risk of 3.5% with antiplatelet therapy 
alone, we projected that we would need to enroll 
900 patients.
Because of a lower-than-expected rate of pa-
tient recruitment, the sponsor determined that 
the study budget would not be sufficient to reach 
the target of 900 patients. Therefore, the steering 
committee decided to stop enrollment on De-
cember 18, 2014, and to pursue follow-up of all 
patients until December 18, 2016. Because the 
rate of the primary end point was also lower than 
expected, the data and safety monitoring board 
did not perform a planned interim analysis.
The test for superiority of PFO closure plus 
antiplatelet therapy over antiplatelet therapy alone 
was performed with combined patient data from 
randomization groups 1 and 2, after verification 
of the absence of interaction between treatment 
effect and treatment group.12,13 The comparison 
of oral anticoagulants with antiplatelet therapy 
was performed with combined patient data from 
randomization groups 1 and 3. The primary ef-
ficacy analysis was performed in the intention-
to-treat cohort, which included all patients who 
were randomly assigned to a treatment. An addi-
tional analysis was performed in the per-protocol 
cohort, which included patients who received 
the randomly assigned treatment, adhered to the 
protocol-mandated medical treatment until the 
end of the trial, and did not have a major proto-
col violation. Survival curves were estimated by 
means of the Kaplan–Meier method. Hazard 
ratios with 95% confidence intervals and corre-
sponding P values were calculated with the use 
of a stratified Cox model with Firth’s penalized 
likelihood method.17,18 Data from the patients 
who did not reach the primary outcome or who 
were lost to follow-up were censored at the end 
of the follow-up period, at the time of death, or 
at the last known follow-up visit. Planned sub-
group analyses were performed in subgroups 
defined according to age (above vs. below the 
median), sex, presence of an atrial septal aneu-
rysm versus a large interatrial shunt, history of 
a cerebrovascular event (before the qualifying 
event) versus no previous cerebrovascular event, 
and Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score19 
(<7 vs. ≥7; scores range from 0 to 10, with 
higher scores representing a higher probability 
that a PFO is related to the cryptogenic stroke); 
these analyses were not corrected for multiple 
comparisons. All P values were two-sided.
Results
Patients
From December 2008 through December 2016, 
a total of 664 patients were enrolled. Treatment 
assignments for the patients in the three ran-
domization groups are shown in Figure 1. One 
patient withdrew consent. Of the 663 remaining 
patients, 524 (randomization group 1) were ran-
domly assigned to the PFO closure group (173 
patients), the anticoagulant group (180 patients), 
or the antiplatelet-only group (171 patients). The 
129 patients who had contraindications to oral 
anticoagulants (randomization group 2) were 
randomly assigned to the PFO closure group 
(65 patients) or the antiplatelet-only group (64 
patients), and the 10 patients who had contra-
indications to PFO closure (randomization 
group 3) were randomly assigned to the antico-
agulant group (7 patients) or the antiplatelet 
group (3 patients). Contraindications to oral anti-
coagulants or to PFO closure are shown in Table 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. The main 
contraindications to oral anticoagulation were 
work-related and athletic activities that posed a 
risk of bleeding.
Characteristics of Patients in the PFO Closure 
Group and the Antiplatelet-Only Group
In an analysis that included randomization groups 
1 and 2, baseline characteristics did not differ 
significantly between the patients in the PFO 
closure group and those in the antiplatelet-only 
group, either when the randomization groups 
were analyzed separately (Table S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix) or when they were analyzed 
together (Table 1). Because the treatment effect 
of PFO closure versus antiplatelet therapy did

The modified Rankin scale is a measure of disability. Scores range from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death). A score of 3 or 
higher indicates at least moderate disability, with the need for some help in daily affairs.
**  
Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) is a score index used to indicate whether a PFO in cryptogenic stroke is stroke-
related or incidental. Scores range from 0 to 10, with larger values representing a higher probability that a PFO is re-
lated to cryptogenic stroke.

not differ between randomization groups 1 and 2 
(P 
= 
0.99 for interaction), the outcome data from 
the patients assigned to PFO closure in each ran-
domization group were combined, as were the 
outcome data from the patients assigned to anti-
platelet therapy alone. Among the 238 patients 
in the combined PFO closure group, 2 declined the 
intervention, 1 had no PFO at the time of inter-
vention, 1 had an atrial septal defect alone rather 
than a PFO, and 17 discontinued antiplatelet ther-
apy. Among the 235 patients in the combined 
antiplatelet-only group, 2 were lost to follow-up 
and 10 discontinued antiplatelet treatment (of 
whom 3 underwent PFO closure) (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Eleven different devices were used for PFO 
closure; the number of patients treated with 
each device and the anesthesia procedures used 
during the closure are shown in Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. In the antiplatelet-only 
group and the PFO closure group, 410 patients 
(86.7%) received aspirin, 51 (10.8%) received 
clopidogrel, 6 (1.3%) received aspirin with ex-
tended-release dipyridamole, and 6 (1.3%) re-
ceived aspirin with clopidogrel. Antiplatelet 
treatments did not differ significantly between 
the PFO closure group and the antiplatelet-only 
group, with the exception that, as stipulated in 
the protocol, dual antiplatelet therapy was ad-
ministered for 3 months after PFO closure.
The mean (±SD) duration of follow-up was 
5.4±1.9 years in the PFO closure group and 
5.2±2.1 years in the antiplatelet-only group 
(P 
= 
0.28). The treatment groups remained bal-
anced with respect to blood pressure, percentage 
of smokers, and low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol concentrations, as determined at follow-
up visits over the course of the trial (Figs. S2 
through S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Outcomes in the PFO Closure Group versus 
the Antiplatelet-Only Group
In the intention-to-treat cohort, no patient in the 
PFO closure group had a stroke, whereas stroke 
occurred in 14 patients in the antiplatelet-only 
group (hazard ratio, 0.03; 95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 0 to 0.26; P<0.001) (Fig. 2 and Table 2). 
The Kaplan–Meier 5-year cumulative estimate of 
the probability of stroke was 4.9% in the anti-
platelet-only group. Among these patients, no 
explanation for recurrent stroke other than PFO 
was found on repeated investigations. Of the 14 
recurrent strokes that occurred in the antiplate-
let-only group, 9 occurred among the 74 patients 
(12.2%) who had both PFO and atrial septal 
aneurysm, and 5 occurred among the 161 pa-
tients (3.1%) who had large PFO without atrial 
septal aneurysm.
The secondary composite outcome of stroke, 
transient ischemic attack, or systemic embo-
lism occurred in significantly fewer patients in 
the PFO closure group than in the antiplatelet-
only group (3.4% vs. 8.9%; hazard ratio, 0.39; 
95% CI, 0.16 to 0.82; P 
= 
0.01). The rates of 
transient ischemic attack, disabling stroke, ma-
jor hemorrhagic complications, and serious ad-
verse events did not differ significantly between 
the treatment groups, and there were no events 
of cerebral hemorrhage, systemic emboli, or 
death in either treatment group (Tables 2 and 
3). Follow-up echocardiography was performed 
in 228 patients at a mean of 10.8 months after 
closure. Among these patients, 212 (93.0%) had 
no or minimal (<10 microbubbles) residual shunt.
A total of 440 patients were available for the 
per-protocol analysis. Baseline characteristics and 
mean duration of follow-up did not differ sig-
nificantly between the PFO closure group and 
the antiplatelet-only group (Fig. S1 and Table S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix). None of the 
217 patients in the PFO closure group had a 
stroke, whereas stroke occurred in 14 of the 223 
patients in the antiplatelet-only group (hazard 
ratio, 0.04; 95% CI, 0 to 0.27; P<0.001) (Table 2). 
There was no evidence of heterogeneity of treat-
ment effect in the subgroup analyses (Fig. S5 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Procedural Complications and Serious 
Adverse Events
Major procedural complications occurred in 14 
patients (5.9%) in the PFO closure group. The 
rate of new-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter was 
higher in the PFO closure group than in the 
antiplatelet-only group: 11 patients in the PFO 
closure group (4.6%; 10 with atrial fibrillation 
and 1 with atrial flutter, with atrial fibrillation 
or flutter occurring within 1 month after the 
procedure in 10 of the 11 patients), as compared 
with 2 patients (0.9%) in the antiplatelet-only 
group (P 
= 
0.02) (Table 3). In the PFO closure group, 
atrial fibrillation did not recur during a median 
follow-up of 4.4 years (range, 1.4 to 5.0). Of the 
11 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter in

the group, 10 were treated with oral anticoagu-
lants, which were discontinued in 7 patients after 
a median of 0.5 years (range, 0.2 to 2.1). Three 
patients were still receiving an anticoagulant at 
the last follow-up visit (Table S6 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). None of the procedural com-
plications resulted in death or permanent dis-
ability. Serious adverse events occurred in 35.7% 
of the patients in the PFO closure group and in 
33.2% of the patients in the antiplatelet-only 
group (P 
= 
0.56) (Table S7 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Outcomes in the Anticoagulation Group 
versus the Antiplatelet-Only Group
Baseline characteristics did not differ signifi-
cantly between the anticoagulation group and 
the antiplatelet-only group (including data from 
randomization groups 1 and 3, which were com-
bined for the purposes of this analysis) (Table 1, 
and Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Among the 187 patients in the anticoagulant 
group, 5 were lost to follow-up, 1 did not receive 
anticoagulation, and 38 discontinued anticoagu-
lation (of whom 3 underwent PFO closure). Among 
the 174 patients in the antiplatelet-only group, 
1 was lost to follow-up and 9 discontinued treat-
ment (of whom 3 underwent PFO closure) (Fig. 
S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). The mean 
duration of follow-up was 5.4±2.0 years in the 
anticoagulant group and 5.3±2.0 years in the anti-
platelet-only group. Among the patients in the 
anticoagulant group, 174 (93.0%) received vita-
min K antagonists and 13 (7.0%) received direct 
oral anticoagulants (6 received dabigatran, 6 re-
ceived rivaroxaban, and 1 received apixaban). Pa-
tients receiving vitamin K agonists had an INR in 
the range of 2 to 3 at 74.3% of visits.
In the intention-to-treat cohort, stroke oc-
curred in 3 patients in the anticoagulation group 
and in 7 patients in the antiplatelet-only group 
(Table 2, and Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The Kaplan–Meier 5-year cumulative 
estimate of the probability of stroke was 1.5% in 
the anticoagulant group and 3.8% in the anti-
platelet-only group. Statistical significance was 
not analyzed because the study was not ade-
quately powered to compare outcomes in these 
groups. The rates of secondary efficacy and safety 
outcomes are shown in Table 2 and Table 3.
A total of 307 patients were available for the 
per-protocol analysis (Fig. S6 and Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Strokes occurred in 
2 patients in the anticoagulant group and in 
Figure 2. Kaplan–Meier Cumulative Estimates of Probability of Stroke in the PFO Closure Group versus the Antiplatelet-
Only Group.

PFO Closure, Anticoagulation, or Antiplatelets
7 patients in antiplatelet-only group. Outcomes 
of subgroup analyses are shown in Figure S8 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Discussion
In this trial of PFO closure in a selected group 
of patients who had had a recent cryptogenic 
ischemic stroke attributed to PFO with an asso-
ciated atrial septal aneurysm or large right-to-
left interatrial shunt, the rate of recurrent stroke 
was significantly lower with closure of the PFO 
plus long-term antiplatelet therapy than with anti-
platelet therapy alone. The 5-year risk of stroke, 
according to the Kaplan–Meier probability esti-
mate, was 4.9 percentage points lower with PFO 
closure plus antiplatelet therapy than with anti-
platelet therapy alone, which would result in one 
stroke avoided at 5 years for every 20 treated 
patients (95% CI, 17 to 25).20 Among patients in 
the antiplatelet-only group, most strokes occurred 
in patients with both PFO and atrial septal aneu-
rysm, a finding that is consistent with the re-
sults from our previous observational study.4
Three previous randomized trials have not 
shown the superiority of PFO closure over medi-
cal therapy alone in the prevention of stroke re-
currence in patients with PFO.8-10 There were 
signals in two of these trials that suggested a 
potential benefit with PFO closure — although 
the results were nonsignificant — with hazard 
ratios in favor of PFO closure of 0.20 (95% CI, 
0.02 to 1.72)9 and 0.49 (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.11).10 
Furthermore, in a pooled analysis of individual 
participant data from the three trials, rates of 
recurrent stroke were significantly lower with 
PFO closure than with medical therapy alone.21
The rate of effective PFO closure (defined as 
no or minimal residual shunt at follow-up echo-
cardiography) in our trial (93.0%) was similar to 
that in previous trials, as was the rate of proce-
dural complications (5.9%).8-10 The rate of new-
onset atrial fibrillation was significantly higher 
in the PFO closure group than in antiplatelet-
only group in our trial, with most cases de-
tected within 1 month after the procedure — a 
finding that suggests that the procedure itself 
induces atrial fibrillation. The risk of stroke 
from atrial fibrillation induced by PFO closure 
has not been determined. In our trial, atrial fi-
brillation did not recur during a median follow-
up of 4.4 years.
The comparison of oral anticoagulants with 
antiplatelet agents in the current trial was under-
powered, and the wide confidence interval for 
the hazard ratio prevents any conclusions. A pre-
vious systematic review suggested that antico-
agulant therapy may be superior to antiplatelet 
therapy for the prevention of stroke recurrence 
in patients with PFO.22
The restricted patient characteristics in our 
trial may explain the difference in results from

previous trials. First, we included only patients 
who had PFO with features that have been associ-
ated with cryptogenic stroke. Second, we used 
a standardized evaluation to define a previous 
cryptogenic stroke, which resulted in a low like-
lihood of alternative causes of recurrent stroke 
besides PFO.23,24 Third, patients enrolled in the 
current trial had a lower burden of vascular risk 
factors than did the patients in previous trials; 
thus, the strokes were less likely to have been 
caused by the usual vascular factors.19 Finally, we 
used a reference treatment group that included 
patients who received antiplatelet therapy alone; 
in contrast, the reference treatment group used in 
previous trials included patients who received either 
antiplatelet drugs or oral anticoagulants (or some-
times both) according to physician preference.
The limitations of this trial were a lower-than-
expected rate of patient recruitment and the ab-
sence of prolonged electrocardiographic monitor-
ing to detect occult atrial fibrillation25; the latter 
was not included in the evaluation of crypto-
genic stroke at the time our trial protocol was 
devised.26,27 However, the yield of prolonged elec-
trocardiographic monitoring in young patients 
with cryptogenic stroke has not been determined, 
and the potential lack of detection of atrial fi-
brillation does not explain why the rate of stroke 
recurrence was lower in the PFO closure group.
In conclusion, among patients 16 to 60 years 
of age who had had a recent cryptogenic stroke 
attributed to PFO with an associated atrial septal 
aneurysm or large interatrial shunt, the rate of 
stroke was lower with PFO closure plus long-term 
antiplatelet therapy than with antiplatelet therapy 
alone. The effects of oral anticoagulant therapy as 
compared with antiplatelet therapy on the risk of 
stroke recurrence could not be determined.
