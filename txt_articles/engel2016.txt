Athletic Cardiac Remodeling
in US Professional Basketball Players
David J. Engel, MD; Allan Schwartz, MD; Shunichi Homma, MD
IMPORTANCE The incidence of sudden cardiac death is higher in US basketball players
compared with other athlete groups. However, the recognition of the risk for sudden cardiac
death among basketball players is challenging because little is known regarding athletic
cardiac remodeling in these athletes or athletes of similarly increased size.
OBJECTIVE To perform a comprehensive cardiac structural analysis of National Basketball
Association (NBA) professional athletes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Echocardiographic observational study of NBA players
on the active rosters for the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 seasons was performed from
December 16, 2013, to December 12, 2014. The policy of the NBA mandates annual preseason
stress echocardiograms for each player. The NBA has sanctioned Columbia University Medical
Center to conduct annual health and safety reviews of these echocardiograms. Data were
analyzed from January to May 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cardiac variables assessed included left ventricular (LV)
size, mass, wall thickness, and hypertrophy patterns and function; left atrial volume; and
aortic root diameter. All dimensions were biometrically scaled.
RESULTS Of the 526 athletes included in the study, 406 (77.2%) were African American and
107 (20.3%) were white, with a mean (SD) age of 25.7 (4.3) years. Mean (SD) athlete height
was 200.2 (8.8) cm; mean body surface area, 2.38 (0.19) m2. Left ventricular size and mass in
NBA athletes were proportional to body size, extending to the uppermost biometrics of the
cohort. Left ventricular hypertrophy was present in 144 athletes (27.4%). African American
athletes had increased LV wall thickness (unadjusted mean, 11.2 mm; 95% CI, 11.1-11.3 mm)
and LV mass (unadjusted mean, 106.3 g/m2; 95% CI, 104.6-108.0 g/m2) compared with LV
wall thickness (unadjusted mean, 10.5 mm; 95% CI, 10.3-10.7 mm; P < .001) and LV mass
(unadjusted mean, 102.2 g/m2; 95% CI, 99.0-105.4 g/m2; P = .029) in white athletes. The
maximal aortic root diameter in the cohort was 42 mm. Aortic root diameters reached a
plateau at the uppermost biometric variables. Five athletes (1.0%) had an LV ejection fraction
of less than 50%, and all ventricles augmented normally with exercise.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides normative cardiac data for a group of
athletes with greater anthropometry than any previously studied athlete group and for a
group known to have elevated rates of sudden cardiac death. These data can be incorporated
into clinical assessments for the primary prevention of cardiac emergencies in basketball
players and the athletic community at large.

T
he characterization of the athlete’
s heart, defined by the
development of increased left ventricular (LV) end-
diastolic diameter (LVEDD), LV wall thickness (LVWT),
and LV mass (LVM),1-3 is based on data collected from a pooled
analysis of athletes engaged in multiple sports. Athletes from
the United States are vastly underrepresented in published
studies. The most popular sports within the United States and
the demographics of US athletes are different from those of the
European centers where most of the data on the athlete’
s heart
have been collected. Basketball is a leading sport within the
United States, with numerous athletes competing from the
youth to the professional levels. A detailed understanding of
normal and expected cardiac remodeling in US basketball play-
ers has significant clinical importance given that the inci-
dence of sports-related sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the
United States is highest among basketball players and that the
most common cause of SCD in this population is hypertro-
phic cardiomyopathy (HCM).4-7
A recent study suggested that the incidence of SCD in Na-
tional Collegiate Athletic Association Division 1 male basket-
ball players is as high as 1:5200 per year.8 The “gray zone” that
differentiates the upper limit of LV hypertrophy (LVH) re-
lated to athletic remodeling and pathologic hypertrophy due
to HCM varies depending on the reference sport and is incom-
pletely defined in basketball players in particular.9-12 Sudden
cardiac death in athletes is not limited to HCM; for basketball
players, for whom tall stature is advantageous, Marfan syn-
drome is another systemic disorder linked with SCD in ath-
letes for whom the differentiation between normal athletic re-
modelingandpathologicchangeisofcrucialimportance.Aortic
root sizes have been shown to be modestly dilated in athletes
across several sports; in addition, aortic root size has a corre-
lation with height, creating another gray zone in the cardiac
evaluation of basketball players.13-16 The level of uncertainty
regarding reference values for all cardiac dimensions is high
for elite US basketball players because, to our knowledge, no
large-scale studies have provided comparative data for ath-
letes of this size.
We completed a comprehensive echocardiographic analy-
sis of 526 current professional athletes from the National Bas-
ketball Association (NBA). A detailed and systematic review
of cardiac structure and function in this large group of ath-
letes will provide an invaluable frame of reference to en-
hance player safety for the large group of US basketball play-
ers in training at all skill levels and in the athletic community
at large.
Methods
Study Population
The policy of the NBA mandates that each athlete undergo an
annual preseason stress echocardiogram as part of a pre-
season medical evaluation, in addition to the screening stress
echocardiogram performed at entrance into the league. The
NBAhassanctionedtheDivisionofCardiologyatColumbiaUni-
versity Medical Center to conduct a player health and safety
review of these echocardiograms on an annual basis. The 2013
and2014preseasonechocardiogramsperformedbyNBAteam–
affiliatedphysiciansandtheechocardiogramsperformedatthe
2014 NBA predraft evaluation (Combine) were sent to Colum-
bia University Medical Center for core laboratory analysis in
digitalformatviaaleague-wideelectronicmedicalrecordssys-
tem. The 526 athletes included in this study represent the total
number of athletes with echocardiograms available for re-
view. Subgroup analysis by race/ethnicity was performed and
confined to African American and white athletes for the pur-
pose of complementing the existing and well-established data
characterizing electrocardiographic differences in African
American and white athletes17-19 with echocardiographic data.
Hispanic and Asian athletes were not included in the sub-
group analyses given the small number of representative ath-
letes (13 [2.5%]). The race/ethnicity of the athletes was deter-
mined by the investigators. The review and analysis of these
echocardiograms for this study was approved by the NBA, the
NBA Players Association, and the institutional review board
of Columbia University Medical Center. Pursuant to approval
from the institutional review board of Columbia University
Medical Center, informed consent was not required for this
study.
Echocardiograms
Data were collected from December 16, 2013, to December 12,
2014. Transthoracic echocardiograms were performed using
commercially available systems. Interventricular septum and
posterior wall thickness, LVEDD, left atrial (LA) anteroposte-
rior diameter, and aortic root diameter at the sinus of Vals-
alva were measured from a parasternal long-axis view as per
American Society of Echocardiography recommendations.20
Left atrial volumes were calculated using the biplane area-
length method and indexed for body surface area (BSA) (cal-
culated as the square root of [height in centimeters × weight
in kilograms]/3600). The LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was cal-
culated using the biplane modified Simpson rule,21 replaced
by visual estimation for technically suboptimal images. The
LV diastolic function was assessed using pulsed-wave Dop-
pler sampling at the tips of the mitral leaflets in diastole (peak
early velocity E) and tissue Doppler imaging of the lateral mi-
tral anulus (peak early velocity E′). We calculated LVM with a
validated method20 and indexed LVM by BSA. We calculated
LV relative wall thickness as (2 × posterior wall thickness)/
LVEDD. Hypertrophy patterns were calculated and defined
using established echocardiographic methods to measure LV
volumes and concentricity.22,23
Reproducibility
A single reader (D.J.E.) analyzed all echocardiograms in this
study. Reproducibility was assessed using 20 studies in which
core dimensions were remeasured, and intraclass correlation
coefficients were calculated for each measure.

assessed using the 2-tailed t test. For differences in LVH, the
2-tailed t test was used for the comparison of unadjusted
means, and a linear regression model was used to calculate the
adjusted means and their SEs after adjustment for age, BSA,
andbloodpressure.TheFisherexacttestwasusedintheanaly-
sis of hypertrophy patterns between African American and
white athletes. The association between cardiac dimensions,
height, and BSA was assessed by grouping means and gener-
alized additive models using the gam function with 6 df and
cubic splines (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gam
/gam.pdf).Wegeneratedfittedcurveswith95%point-wiseCIs.
For all statistical analysis, a 2-tailed P value of less than 0.05
was considered significant. The analysis was performed in SAS
(version 9.3; SAS Institute, Inc) and R (version 3.0.1; https:
//cran.r-project.org) software.
Results
Characterization of Study Population
Baseline characteristics of the study population are shown in
Table 1. The 526 athletes ranged in age from 18 to 39 years
(mean age, 25.7 [4.3] years); 406 (77.2%) were African Ameri-
can, 107 (20.3%) were white, 12 (2.3%) were Hispanic, and 1
(0.2%)wasAsian.Themeanheightofthegroupwas200.2(8.8)
cm; mean weight, 101.1 (12.3) kg; and mean BSA, 2.38 (0.19)
m2. Blood pressures were normal in the athlete group. White
athletes had increased BSA compared with African American
athletes. We found no differences in age, heart rate, or blood
pressure between African American and white athletes.
Cardiac Dimensions
LV Size and LVM
The distribution for LVEDD is shown in Figure 1A. The LVEDD
ranged from 44 to 71 (mean, 56.8; 95% CI, 56.4-57.2) mm. Left
ventricular cavity dilation (LVEDD, ≥59 mm)20 was present in
192 athletes (36.5%), whereas 23 (4.4%) had substantial LV di-
lation (LVEDD, ≥65 mm). Although a significant proportion of
NBA athletes had LV dilation, when LVEDD was indexed to
height and BSA, LV cavity sizes were normal compared with
reference male adults, even among the largest athletes,20 with
a mean LVEDD per unit of BSA of 2.40 (95% CI, 2.23-2.57)
cm/m2 vs reference adults (range, 2.3-3.0 cm/m2) and a mean
LVEDD per unit of height of 2.84 (95% CI, 2.66-3.02) cm/m vs
reference adults (range, 2.4-3.3 cm/m). We observed an ap-
proximately linear association between LVEDD and height and
BSA that extended to the uppermost biometrics of the athlete
group, demonstrated by the curves with 95% CIs in Figure 1B
and C. Raw data for the distribution of LVEDD in the NBA co-
hort and mean LVEDDs associated with the span of height and
BSA in the group is provided in eFigure 1 in the Supplement.
The distribution for maximal LVWT is shown in Figure 2A.
The LVWT ranged from 8 to 15 (mean, 11.04; 95% CI, 10.94-
11.14) mm, with 64 athletes (12.2%) having an LVWT of 13 mm

or greater and 13 (2.5%) having an LVWT of 14 mm or greater.
As we observed with LV cavity size, LVM was associated with
height and BSA in an approximately linear fashion extending
to the uppermost biometrics of the group, as demonstrated by
the curves with 95% CIs in Figure 2B and C. Raw data show-
ing the mean LVMs associated with the span of height and BSA
in the group are provided in eFigure 2 in the Supplement. The
mean LVM index (LVMI) was 105.4 (95% CI, 103.9-106.9) g/m2,
and the mean relative wall thickness was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.37-
0.39). Using the American Society of Echocardiography stan-
dards for LVH,20 144 athletes (27.4%) had LVH (LVMI, >115
g/m2), whereas 29 (5.5%) had moderate LVH (LVMI, >132 g/m2)
and 9 (1.7%) had severe LVH (LVMI, ≥149 g/m2). We further
characterizedthepatternofhypertrophyintheseathletesusing
a 4-group classification22,23 that incorporates LV volume and
concentricity. Of the 134 African American and white athletes
with LVH, the most predominant pattern of hypertrophy was
concentric nondilated (64 [47.8%]), followed by eccentric di-
lated (37 [27.6%]), concentric dilated (26 [19.4%]), and eccen-
tric nondilated (7 [5.2%]). We found significant increases in
LVWT, LVMI, and relative wall thickness in African American
compared with white athletes independently of age, BSA, and
blood pressure. In addition, we observed a variation in the pat-
tern of LVH between African American and white athletes. In
those athletes with LVH, the proportion of concentric nondi-
lated hypertrophy was substantially higher in African Ameri-
can athletes, whereas the eccentric dilated form of hypertro-
phy was more predominant in white athletes. These findings
are demonstrated in Table 2.
LA Size
Left atrial diameter ranged from 26 to 49 (mean, 38.1; 95% CI,
37.8-38.4) mm. The mean LA volume index (LAVI) was 30.9
(95% CI, 30.4-31.4) mL/m2. Left atrial enlargement in this ath-
lete cohort was mild in 85 athletes (16.2%; LAVI, 35-41 mL/
m2), moderate in 23 (4.4%; LAVI, 42-48 mL/m2), and severe
in 7 (1.3%; LAVI, >48 mL/m2).20 In those athletes with in-
creased LA volume, a corresponding increase in LVM com-
paredwiththeathleteswhohadnormalLAvolumeswasnoted
(LVMI, 110.4 [95% CI, 106.9-113.9] g/m2 and 102.4 [95% CI,
100.5-104.3] g/m2, respectively; P < .001). Left atrial vol-
umes were similar in athletes with concentric and eccentric
forms of LVH (LAVI, 33.7 [95% CI, 32.5-35.9] mL/m2 and 35.3
[95% CI, 32.9-37.7] mL/m2, respectively; P = .27).

Aortic Root Dimension
The distribution for aortic root diameter is shown in Figure 3A.
Aortic root diameter ranged from 25 to 42 (mean, 33.7; 95% CI,
33.4-34.0) mm, with 24 athletes (4.6%) having an aortic root
diameter of 40 mm or greater and 7 (1.3%) having the maxi-
mum measured aortic root diameter of 42 mm. Figure 3B and
C show the curves with 95% CIs of aortic root diameters in the
NBA athletes associated with height and BSA. Raw data for the
distribution of aortic root diameter in the NBA cohort and
means of aortic root diameter in relation to the span of height
and BSA in the group is provided in eFigure 3 in the Supple-
ment. We observed that at the uppermost ranges in body size,
aortic root diameters reached a plateau. This finding is in con-
trast to our observations of LVM and cavity size, where these
cardiac dimensions continued to rise proportionally as the ath-
letes’biometrics increased.
We found no difference in age or blood pressure between
athletes with the largest aortic root diameters (≥40 mm) and
athletes with smaller aortic roots. Aortic root diameter in-
dexed to the height and BSA in athletes with aortic roots of 40
mm or greater remained significantly higher in comparison
with those of the other athletes (aortic root per unit of height,
0.197 [95% CI, 0.195-0.200] mm/cm and 0.167 [95% CI, 0.165-
0.168] mm/cm, respectively; P < .001). Aortic root per unit of
BSA was 16.1 (95% CI, 15.6-16.6) mm/m2 for athletes with aor-
tic roots of 40 mm or greater vs 14.1 (95% CI, 14.0-14.2) mm/m2
for those of other athletes (P < .001), suggesting that body size
was not the determining factor to explain the increased aor-
tic root diameter in these athletes with the largest aortic roots.
We also observed a higher proportion of mitral valve prolapse
in the athletes with aortic root diameters of 40 mm or more
(4 of 24 [17%]) compared with the athletes with smaller aortic
roots (20 of 502 [4.0%]).
Left Ventricular Function
The mean LVEF (measured by the biplane modified Simpson
rule,81%;byvisualestimation,19%)was59.6%(95%CI,59.3%-
59.9%) for this athlete group (range, 45%-72%). We found that
5 of the 526 athletes (1.0%) had an LVEF of less than 50%. All
ventricles were observed by stress echocardiography to aug-
ment normally with exercise. Stroke volume was calculated
in 247 of 526 athletes (47.0%), and the mean stroke volume
was 111.3 (95% CI, 108.3-114.3) mL, which was increased in the
NBA cohort compared with the mean in normal male individu-
als (73 [17] mL).20 We observed that athletes with the lowest
LVEFs (<50%) did not differ compared with the other athletes
with respect to height, BSA, age, blood pressure, or heart rate.
We observed that athletes with an LVEF of less than 50% had
larger LVEDDs at 62.4 (95% CI, 59.8-65.0) mm vs 56.8 (95%
CI, 56.4-57.2) mm (P = .005) and increased LVMI at 121.0 (95%
CI,98.7-143.3)g/m2vs105.2(95%CI,103.8-106.7)g/m2(P = .04)
than athletes with LVEF of greater than 50%.
Left ventricular diastolic function using pulsed-wave and
tissue Doppler analysis was measured in 213 of 526 athletes
(40.5%) and was normal in all participants (E/E′, 4.8; 95% CI,
4.6-5.0). No difference in diastolic function was observed be-
tween those athletes with increased LVM or increased LA vol-
ume vs those athletes with normal indices.
Reproducibility
For intraobserver variability, the intraclass correlation coeffi-
cients were 0.99 for LVEDD and 0.98 for aortic root diameter.
The mean intraobserver difference was 0.6 mm for LVEDD and
0.7 mm for aortic root diameter.
Discussion
The distinction in an individual athlete between expected ath-
leticcardiacremodelingandcardiacpathologicchangethatpre-
disposes to SCD can be challenging, given the wide range of
hemodynamic demands involved in training and competi-
tion in different sports and the varied baseline characteristics
of athletes engaged in these sports. Because much of the lit-
erature on the structural features of the athlete’
s heart is de-
rived from European centers where comprehensive cardiac
screening of all elite athletes is performed, far less has been

for whom these mandatory screening policies do not exist. In
2006, the NBA adopted a policy of annual screening of ath-
letes with stress echocardiography to supplement the require-
ment that players undergo a screening stress echocardio-
gram before entrance into the league. The NBA is the only US
professional sports league to develop and operate such a car-
diac program. The large contingent of NBA athletes forming
our study represent an athletic group with more ethnic diver-
sity and significantly greater height and BSA than any ath-
letic group that has been studied on this scale. We have in-
cluded an eTable in the Supplement for reference that contains
all measured raw and indexed cardiac variables for the NBA
cohort.
We found that LV cavity sizes in NBA players were larger
thaninnormaladults,butthatLVsizewasproportionaltobody
size. This finding is comparable to those of series of other ath-
lete groups, including Olympic athletes followed up at the In-
stitute of Sports Science in Rome, Italy,24-26 smaller series of
elite athletes in mixed sports,2,27-29 and 1 cohort of National
FootballLeagueathletes.30TheLVcavitysizeswerenotaslarge
as those reported in professional cyclists31 in which LV dila-
tion was more pronounced than in any other published ath-
lete group. The results of our study reinforce the concept that
scaling LV size to body size is vitally important in the cardiac
evaluation of basketball players, whose heights extend to 218
cm and BSAs to 2.8 m2.
Our data show just a modest degree of LVH in NBA ath-
letes, with 27.4% of athletes having an increased LVMI. The
upper limit of absolute LVWT was 15 mm (in 1 athlete), and
12.2% of the athletes had a maximal LVWT of 13 to 14 mm. Afri-
can American athletes were found to have increased indices
of LVH compared with white athletes, as reported in smaller
seriesofathletesinmixedsports,32-34butspecificallywefound
that African American athletes had a substantially higher pro-
portion of nondilated concentric hypertrophy, whereas the
most predominant form of hypertrophy in white athletes was
eccentric dilated hypertrophy. These data from the NBA co-
hort help to extend the understanding and characterization of
athletic hypertrophy in US basketball athletes and provide fur-
ther reference to assist in the recognition of HCM in basket-
ball players, an important task given the guidance from the
most recent American Heart Association–American College of
Cardiology Task Force recommendations35 to restrict indi-
viduals diagnosed with HCM from all but low-intensity com-
petitive sports.
With respect to LV systolic function, we found that most
NBAathleteshadanormalLVEF,whereasonly5athletes(1.0%)
had an LVEF of less than 50%. No athlete had an LVEF of less
than 45%. All athletes had normal augmentation of LV sys-
tolic function with exercise and no athlete was found to have
diastolic dysfunction. With serial echocardiographic evalua-
tions of the athletes with lower LVEF, in keeping with NBA pro-
tocol, we have found that LVEF has remained stable or in-
creased over time. Reports of individuals with low normal to
mildly reduced LVEF are present in other elite athlete groups,
such as professional football players and cyclists,30,31 but no
similarly corroborating evidence has suggested that these in-
dividuals have an underlying cardiomyopathy.
Aortic root diameter was a cardiac dimension of particu-
lar importance in the evaluation of NBA athletes, given the ex-
treme height of the average NBA player and the potential for
overlap with individuals who have Marfan syndrome. The
maximum aortic root diameter measured in the NBA cohort
was 42 mm, and just 4.6% of athletes had an aortic root of 40
mm or greater. In fact, aortic root sizes were similar to those
reportedacrossseveraleliteathletegroups,14,15,36,37despitethe
different anthropometry between NBA players and these other
athletes. We observed that in relation to body size, aortic root
diameters tapered in their increase and reached a plateau at
the uppermost heights and BSAs. Because to date no large-
scale comparative data have assessed aortic root dimensions
for athletes of the size of the average NBA player (mean height,
200.2 cm; mean BSA, 2.38 m2), these data have important im-
plications in the evaluation of exceptionally large athletes and
question the applicability in individuals with significantly in-
creased biometrics of the traditional formula to estimate aor-
ticrootdiameterthatassumesalinearassociationbetweenaor-
tic diameter and BSA.13,20,38 These data support recent
American Heart Association–American College of Cardiology
Task Force recommendations39 to surveil with serial imaging
tall athletes with aortic root diameters of greater than 41 mm.
The results of this study are the first to date to provide
large-scale normative data for US basketball players, an ath-
letic group with greater anthropometry than any previously
studied athlete group and shown to have elevated rates of
SCD. As highlighted by the American College of Cardiology
Sports and Exercise Cardiology Think Tank,40 gaining an
understanding of the actual cardiac structural data without
having to extrapolate from data in other athlete groups is
essential for reference for the health care professionals who
treat the large number of US basketball players from the
youth to professional levels. We hope that the results of this
study will assist recognition of cardiac pathologic change
and provide a framework to help avoid unnecessary exclu-
sions of athletes from competition. We believe that these
data have additional applicability to other sports that prese-
lect for athletes with height, such as volleyball, rowing, and
track and field.
In our study, we did not undertake a formal evaluation of
right ventricular structure and function. Inherent difficulties
in the evaluation of right ventricular function at the present
time include a lack of uniformity in image acquisition of the
right ventricle across multiple centers and evolving stan-
dards for objectively assessing right ventricular size and func-
tion. However, in a subset of 128 athletes among whom tissue
Doppler velocity of the lateral tricuspid anulus was mea-
sured (S′), all athletes were found to have normal right ven-
tricularfunctionbythismethod(rightventricularS′ = 13.9cm/s;
95% CI, 13.5-14.3 cm/s), and no players were found to have pul-
monary hypertension. Other limitations of our study include
the lack of a comparison group of nonathletes with biomet-
rics similar to the NBA cohort and the lack of follow-up data
for those athletes with cardiac variables on the outer edges of
the distributions. Follow-up data collection is ongoing to as-
sess the temporal changes of the cardiac variables in the ath-
letes we included for analysis.

Conclusions
Conclusions about an athlete’
s heart should not be based on
echocardiographic measurements in isolation. Instead, such
conclusions require placement in full medical context, includ-
ing a complete medical evaluation with incorporation of
all other pertinent clinical information. We hope that the
present data will help to focus decision making and improve
clinical acumen for the purpose of primary prevention of
cardiac emergencies in US basketball players and in the
athletic community at large.
