OBJECTIVES: Firearms are a leading cause of injury and death for children and adolescents 
in the United States. We examined how hospitalization rates for firearm injuries differ for 
rural and urban populations.
METHODS: The Kids’ Inpatient Database was used to identify hospitalizations for firearm 
injuries in patients <20 years of age by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision external-cause-of-injury codes. Data from 2006, 2009, and 2012 were analyzed to 
compare demographics and intent (assault, self-inflicted, unintentional, and undetermined). 
Urban-rural classification was based on patients' county of residence. Rates were calculated 
by using weighted cases and US Census data.
RESULTS: There were 21 581 hospitalizations for firearm injuries. The overall hospitalization 
rate was higher in urban versus rural areas (risk ratio [RR] = 1.95; 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 1.81–2.10). Rates were highest for assaults in urban 15- to 19-year-olds (RR = 7.82; 
95% CI: 6.48–9.44). Unintentional injuries were the leading cause of hospitalizations in 
younger age groups in all urban and rural locations. Rates for unintentional injuries were 
lower among urban versus rural 5- to 9-year-olds (RR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.36–0.63) and 10- to 
14-year-olds (RR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.37–0.52).
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations for firearm assaults among urban 15- to 19-year-olds 
represent the highest injury rate. Notably, hospitalizations are lower for urban versus 
rural 5- to 9-year-olds and 10- to 14-year-olds, and unintentional firearm injuries are most 
common among these groups. Preventative public health approaches should address these 
differences in injury epidemiology.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Male sex, 
nonwhite race, and late adolescent age are risk 
factors for pediatric and adolescent firearm injuries, 
but there are no studies in which researchers 
examine the differences in rates of firearm 
injury hospitalizations between rural and urban 
populations.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Hospitalization rates for 
firearm injuries are higher in rural areas among 
5- to 9-year-olds and 10- to 14-year-olds versus urban 
populations. Unintentional firearm injuries are the 
most common cause of firearm injury hospitalizations 
except among urban 15- to 19-year-olds.

 In 2015, there were 13 723 nonfatal 
and 2762 fatal firearm injuries in 
children and adolescents <20 years 
of age in the United States.1 Deaths 
from firearms now rank among the 
top 3 causes of death in the pediatric 
population.1 
– 
3 In previous research,  
it has been identified that male  
sex, nonwhite race, low median 
income, and older adolescent  
age are risk factors for sustaining 
both fatal and nonfatal firearm  
injuries2, 
 
4 
– 
10; these data, however, 
are largely driven by firearm assaults 
in urban settings. In 2 previous 
studies, it has been demonstrated 
that fatality rates due to firearms 
for urban and rural counties are 
essentially equivalent both in the 
overall population and specifically in 
children and adolescents.11, 
 
12 Rural 
and urban differences have been 
noted regarding the cause of injury or 
death, with suicide and unintentional 
firearm deaths occurring at a higher 
rate in rural counties and deaths 
from firearm homicide occurring at a 
higher rate in urban counties.11, 
 
12
Because of limited availability of 
detailed national statistics on firearm 
deaths in children and adolescents, 
data from hospitalizations due 
to firearm injuries represent an 
opportunity to examine and better 
understand the epidemiology and 
contributing factors that might 
help explain rural and urban 
differences and ensure that public 
health approaches to the prevention 
of firearm injuries appropriately 
address variations across different 
populations. Therefore, our 
objectives in this study were to 
determine how hospitalization 
rates due to firearm injuries differ 
between rural and urban settings 
and to compare rates by intent and 
demographic variables.
METHODS
Study Design and Data Source
We conducted a cross-sectional study 
of US hospitalizations due to firearm 
injuries in children and adolescents 
<20 years of age using the Kids’ 
Inpatient Database (KID), the largest 
publicly available all-payer pediatric 
inpatient care database, which was 
developed for the Healthcare Cost 
and Utilization Project and created by 
the Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality.13 The KID, released 
every 3 years since 1997, provides 
a nationally representative sample 
of hospital discharge data. The most 
recent data set, released in 2012, 
includes data on more than 4100 
hospitals across 44 states.13 For our 
study, we aggregated the data for the 
years 2006, 2009, and 2012.
The KID includes systematic 
randomly sampled data from 10% 
of uncomplicated births and 80% of 
complicated births and other acute 
care hospitalizations.13 Discharge 
data are weighted to yield national 
estimates by stratifying hospitals by 
using the following 6 characteristics: 
bed size, hospital type, ownership 
and/or control, rural or urban 
location, teaching status, and US 
region. The KID does not include 
data on cases that do not result 
in an inpatient hospitalization 
admission and thus does not include 
patient deaths that occurred in the 
emergency department. Unweighted 
data include over 3 million pediatric 
discharges for each year of the KID; 
weighted data are used to provide 
estimates for over 7 million pediatric 
discharges each year of the KID.13
This study was deemed exempt 
from approval by the Yale School 
of Medicine’s Institutional Review 
Board.
Identification of the Sample
We identified eligible hospitalizations 
as those occurring for fatal and 
nonfatal injuries due to firearms for 
children and adolescents <20 years 
of age at the time of admission. We 
used external-cause-of-injury codes 
(E codes) from the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision, Clinical Modification 
14 
to include all hospitalizations due 
to firearm injuries, specifying the 
intent of the injury as one of the 
following: assault (E965.0–E965.4), 
self-inflicted (E955.0–E955.4, 
E955.6, E955.9), unintentional 
(E922.0–E922.4, E922.8–E922.9), 
and undetermined as to whether 
the injury was unintentional or 
purposefully inflicted (E985.0–
E985.4, E985.6). We included 
hospitalizations for firearm injuries 
due to BB or air guns and excluded 
those due to paintballs. We also 
excluded those hospitalizations 
that were only coded for late effects 
of injury, removing from the data 
set those with either a late effects 
International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or E 
code (ICD-9: 905–909 and E codes: 
929, 959, 969, 989). In addition, 
we did not include ICD-9 codes or 
categories that were used to specify 
legal intervention as a separate 
category of intent (notably, the 2012 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
policy statement on firearm-related 
injury states that ∼1% of pediatric 
injuries were classified under this 
mechanism of intent).2
We abstracted the following 
demographic information: age at the 
time of hospitalization (0–4, 5–9, 
10–14, and 15–19 years of age), sex, 
race and/or ethnicity (white, African 
American, Hispanic, or other), type of 
health insurance (private, Medicaid, 
self-pay, or other), and the patient’s 
county of residence (including 
rural or urban classification). The 
age groupings were chosen to be 
consistent with the age categories 
used by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention Web-based 
Injury Statistics Query and Reporting 
System.1
Rural and urban classification 
data in the KID are based on the 
patient’s county of residence13 
and defined by the National Center 
for Health Statistics.15 For this 
study, we matched rural and urban 
classifications from the KID to

Downloaded from 
 publicly available rural and urban 
classification data from the US 
Census Bureau in the following  
3 categories: metropolitan counties 
of >50 000 population (referred to 
as urban-metropolitan in the KID 
and defined in this study as urban), 
micropolitan counties of 10 000 
to 49 999 population (defined as 
micropolitan), and nonmetropolitan 
nonmicropolitan counties of <10 000 
population (defined as rural).16
Statistical Analysis
We calculated the weighted estimates 
of the number of hospitalizations 
due to firearm injuries during the 
time period, stratified by intent, age, 
race, and urban or rural location. 
Differences in demographic and 
clinical characteristics were assessed 
by using χ2 tests. We calculated the 
incidence of hospitalizations due 
to firearm injuries by dividing the 
aggregated number of weighted 
hospitalizations by the aggregated 
number of children and adolescents 
for each urban and rural location on 
the basis of 2006, 2009, and 2012 
intercensal data.16 We compared 
rates of hospitalization for different 
groups by calculating relative risk 
ratios (RRs) (using rural counties as 
the reference group). All analyses 
were performed by using SAS version 
9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Demographic and Clinical 
Characteristics
We identified 21 843 hospitalizations 
due to firearm injuries in children 
and adolescents <20 years of 
age during the aggregate study 
period, including 2006, 2009, and 
2012; 262 hospitalizations were 
excluded because there was no 
documentation of urban or rural 
classification per the National Center 
for Health Statistics categories, 
resulting in a final sample of 21 581. 
The demographic characteristics 
of the hospitalized children and 
adolescents are shown in Table 1. 
Most hospitalizations occurred in 
older adolescents and males, but 
there were statistically significant 
differences in the age distribution 
between urban and rural locations. 
Across all age groups and urban and 
rural locations, 15- to 19-year-olds 
accounted for the majority of the 
hospitalizations. There were also 
statistically significant differences 
across urban and rural categories 
for racial background and insurance 
status or payer, as shown in  
Table 1. Overall, 6% of all children 
hospitalized died during their 
hospitalization, and there were no 
differences between urban and rural 
location (P = .08).
Incidence of Hospitalizations for All 
Types of Firearm Injuries
Rates of hospitalization and RRs 
for all firearm injuries and for each 
category of intent and age group are 
shown in Tables 2 and 3. In Table 2,  
we show the rates and RRs for  
urban versus rural areas. In Table 3,  
we show the rates and RRs for 
micropolitan versus rural areas. 
The highest rate of hospitalization 
due to all categories of intent was 
30.68 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
27.63–33.73) per 100 000 persons, 
occurring in 15- to 19-year-olds in 
urban areas (Table 2), whereas the 
lowest rate was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.42–
1.00) per 100 000 persons, occurring 
in 0- to 4-year-olds in micropolitan 
areas (Table 3).
As shown in Table 2, compared with 
rural areas, hospitalization rates 
were higher in urban areas for 15- to 
19-year-olds (RR = 2.76; 95% CI: 
2.51–3.03) but lower among 5- to 
9-year-olds (RR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.51–
0.88) and 10- to 14-year-olds (RR = 
0.79; 95% CI: 0.68–0.93). There was 
no significant difference between  
0- and 4-year-olds (RR = 0.91; 95% 
CI: 0.63–1.32).
As shown in Table 3, micropolitan 
and rural areas had more similar 
rates of hospitalization for all 
categories of intent of firearm 
injuries, with no statistically 
significant difference in rates 
between 0- to 4-year-olds, 5- to 
9-year-olds, or 15- to 19-year-olds. 
Micropolitan 10- to 14-year-olds 
were less likely to be hospitalized 
than their rural age counterparts  
(RR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.54–0.81).

 Incidence of Hospitalizations for 
Firearm Injuries by Intent
The leading cause of hospitalization 
for 15- to 19-year-olds in urban areas 
was firearm assaults, occurring at a 
rate of 21.44 (95% CI: 19.00–23.87) 
per 100 000 persons (Table 2). This 
rate was 7.8-fold higher (RR = 7.82; 
95% CI: 6.48–9.44) than that of 
15- to 19-year-olds in rural areas 
(Table 2). Firearm assaults leading 
to hospitalization also occurred at 
a higher rate in micropolitan areas 
compared with rural areas (RR = 
1.58; 95% CI: 1.27–1.96) (Table 3).
Although the majority of firearm 
injuries occurred among urban 15- to 
19-year-olds, unintentional firearm 
injuries were the leading cause of 
hospitalizations across all younger 
age groups in all 3 urban and rural 
locations. Rates of hospitalization 
due to unintentional injuries 
among 5- to 9-year-olds and 10- to 
14-year-olds were lower in urban 
areas when compared with rural 
areas (RR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.36–0.63 
and RR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.37–0.52, 
respectively) (Table 2). Rates of 
hospitalization due to unintentional 
injuries were also lower in 
micropolitan areas compared with 
rural areas for 5- to 9-year-olds,  
10- to 14-year-olds, and 15- to 
19-year-olds (Table 3).
Hospitalization rates for self-inflicted 
injuries were highest in rural areas 
among 15- to 19-year-olds. Rates 
of hospitalization for self-inflicted 
injuries in both urban areas  
(RR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.42–0.70) 
and micropolitan areas (RR = 0.69; 
95% CI: 0.50–0.96) were lower in 
comparison with rural areas.
As shown in Tables 2 and 3, when 
stratifying by intent, the calculation 
of hospitalization rates in some of 
the younger age groups did not meet 
criteria for statistical reliability and 
thus were not used for analysis to 
compare between urban and rural 
locations.
DISCUSSION
In this study, in which we examined 
US hospitalizations in children and 
adolescents due to firearm injuries, 
there were 3 key findings: (1) the 
majority of pediatric firearm injuries 
resulting in hospitalization across all 
urban and rural locations occurred 
among 15- to 19-year-olds, and 
the hospitalization rate in this age 
group was highest among those 
living in urban areas; (2) in contrast, 
hospitalizations due to firearm 
injuries among 5- to 9-year-olds and 
10- to 14-year-olds were lower in 
urban areas compared with rural 
areas; and (3) unintentional firearm 
injuries were the most common 
cause of hospitalization for the 
younger age groups (<15 years of 
age) across all urban and rural areas.
There are limited studies in which 
researchers compare the rates 
of firearm injuries between rural 
and urban settings. Although in 
pediatric-specific studies researchers

 have evaluated firearm deaths and 
mortality rates between urban 
and rural locations, they have not 
examined hospitalization rates 
nor have they evaluated different 
pediatric age groups. In 1 study, 
it was demonstrated that urban 
and rural counties have overall 
similar firearm mortality rates 
but that urban counties have 
higher firearm homicide rates, 
whereas rural counties have higher 
firearm suicide rates.11 The same 
group later demonstrated similar 
findings specifically in children 
and adolescents (0–19-year-olds), 
showing that pediatric firearm 
homicide rates were nearly 3.7 times 
higher in urban counties but again 
that overall mortality rates were 
similar between urban and rural 
counties.12
In our study, we showed that the 
overall rate of hospitalization due 
to firearm injuries in children and 
adolescents is highest among 15- to 
19-year-olds living in urban areas, 
occurring at a rate nearly threefold 
higher than that of 15- to 19-year-
olds living in rural areas. Urban 
15- to 19-year-olds account for 
>75% of all pediatric firearm-related 
hospitalizations, and they average 
over 5500 hospitalizations each year 
or ∼15 hospitalizations per day. 
Specifically, more than two-thirds of 
these hospitalizations are related to 
firearm injuries due to assault, and 
15- to 19-year-olds in urban areas 
are hospitalized for firearm assaults 
at a rate 8 times higher than 15- to 
19-year-olds in rural areas. These 
findings are consistent with previous 
studies in which it was demonstrated 
that older adolescent age in urban 
locations is a primary risk factor for 
firearm death and injury.4, 
 
5, 
 
8 
–10 These 
same studies have also revealed 
that African American and Hispanic 
individuals are at an increased 
risk of sustaining firearm injuries, 
particularly injuries due to firearm 
assault. Our study is consistent with 
these previous findings, revealing 
that hospitalizations due to firearm 
injuries occur at a disproportionately 
elevated rate in both African 
American and Hispanic youth, 
especially in urban areas.
Our finding that pediatric 
hospitalization rates for firearm 
injuries in 5- to 9-year-olds and 
10- to 14-year-olds were lower in 
urban areas when compared with 
rural areas has not been reported 
previously. In previous studies in 
which researchers compared urban 
and rural firearm injuries, authors 
did not distinguish between older 
adolescents and younger children 
and adolescents.11, 
 
12 Importantly, the 
rate of unintentional firearm injuries 
is higher in rural areas among these 
younger children compared with 
urban areas. With these findings, 
we suggest that approaches to 
reducing firearm injuries in rural 
areas should take into account the 
increased rate of unintentional 
injuries versus urban areas, and 
further study is needed to determine 
the best means of preventing injuries 
in these different populations. In 
terms of further possible solutions, 
the American Academy of Pediatrics 
has made multiple statements on 
the need for the promotion of safe 
firearm storage, and researchers 
have demonstrated the importance 
of reducing access to firearms in 
youth suicide prevention.2, 
 
17 In 
recent studies, there have also 
been promising results around 
community-based interventions to 
promote safe gun storage practices.18
The majority of firearm injury 
hospitalizations in children 
<15 years of age were due to 
unintentional injuries. In these 
children, unintentional injuries 
were the leading cause of firearm 
injury hospitalization in urban and 
micropolitan areas, and those in 
rural areas had an even higher rate. 
In previous studies, it has been 
documented that unintentional 
firearm injuries are more common 
than assault and/or homicide  
firearm injuries in children and 
adolescents 0 to 14 years of age.4, 
 
7  
However, at least 1 other study 
in which researchers specifically 
evaluated both fatal and nonfatal 
firearm injury rates in this age group 
revealed that firearm homicide 
and assault rates were higher than 
unintentional death and injury 
rates.5 Of note, different authors 
have used different data sources, 
which may at least partially account 
for this discrepancy. In our findings, 
which are based on the largest 
publicly available all-payer pediatric 
inpatient database, it is indicated 
that unintentional firearm injuries 
are the most common category of 
intent leading to hospitalization 
for all age groups except for 15- to 
19-year-olds in urban areas (as noted 
above). Specifically, with regards 
to rural versus urban settings, 
studies in which authors evaluate 
mortality have revealed higher rates 
of unintentional and suicide firearm 
deaths in rural areas.11, 
12, 
 
19, 
 
20 In 
previous studies, researchers have 
also speculated that this rural-urban 
disparity with regards to intent and 
firearm injury may be related to 
overall gun ownership rates, types 
of firearms involved, firearm storage 
practices, or lack of access to trauma 
care.19, 
 
21 
– 
25 Further research is 
needed to better understand how 
these geographic differences affect 
firearm-related injuries.
In addition to higher rates of 
hospitalization for unintentional 
firearm injuries in rural areas, our 
study also showed that rural areas 
have higher rates of hospitalization 
for self-inflicted injuries (ie, suicide 
or suicide attempts) among older 
adolescents (15–19-year-olds). As 
noted above, this finding is well 
supported by previous studies, 
11, 
 
12, 
 
20  
and although not a new finding, it 
is important given the increasing 
overall rate of suicide in the United 
States and its disproportionately 
higher rate of increase among rural 
communities.26 The combination of

 increased accessibility to firearms 
and decreased access to appropriate 
mental health services has been 
suggested as a partial explanation 
for this urban-rural discrepancy, 
27 
– 
30 
and higher adolescent suicide rates 
in rural areas are likely mirroring 
similar trends for adult suicide 
rates.31 Further research in this 
area is needed to help better design 
effective suicide prevention efforts.
This study has at least 2 limitations. 
First, the KID depends on 
International Classifications of 
Disease coding, which is subject to 
miscoding and misclassification 
errors; the ability to discern the 
mechanism of intent in firearm 
injury data can be a source of coding 
error. Likewise, an appropriate law 
enforcement investigation may not 
have been fully completed at the time 
of hospitalization, and determining 
unintentional versus intentional 
injuries or assault intent may be 
unclear.
Second, KID data sets report the 
number of hospitalizations and not 
individual children or adolescents. 
Thus, to calculate population 
hospitalization rates, we made 
the assumption that a patient 
was hospitalized once during 
the database year and excluded 
hospitalizations that only listed 
injury codes for a late effect.
With our study’s results, we add 
further evidence to previous 
research and demonstrate new 
findings with regards to rural and 
urban differences in the rate of 
hospitalization due to firearm injury 
among children and adolescents. As 
with many other public health issues, 
separating and understanding the 
different components of this complex 
problem are essential to designing 
and monitoring public health 
efforts to reduce firearm-related 
injuries. With our findings, we build 
on previous research and further 
suggest that the cause and underlying 
factors leading to firearm injuries in 
rural communities are likely different 
from those in urban communities. 
Thus, to effectively approach these 
related but different problems, 
different prevention strategies will 
likely be required. These might 
include a combination of individual 
and community-focused awareness 
and education campaigns, safety 
and injury prevention anticipatory 
guidance and counseling, increased 
mental health access and screening, 
and violence prevention programs.
CONCLUSIONS
There are important differences 
in the rates of hospitalization due 
to firearm injuries based on intent 
and age in urban versus rural areas. 
With these findings, we suggest that 
a varied public health approach is 
needed to reduce firearm-related 
injuries in these different areas of the 
country.
