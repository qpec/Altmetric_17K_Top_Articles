maximum contaminant level on arsenic exposure in the USA 
from 2003 to 2014: an analysis of the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination  Survey (NHANES)

Summary
Background In 2006, the current US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maximum contaminant level for arsenic 
in public water systems (10 µg/L) took effect. We aimed to assess national trends in water arsenic exposure in the 
USA, hypothesising that urinary arsenic concentrations would decrease over time in individuals using public water 
systems but not in those using well water (which is not federally regulated). We further estimated the expected 
number of avoided skin or lung and bladder cancer cases.
Methods In this analysis of the 2003–14 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 
we used data for dimethylarsinate (DMA), the main metabolite of inorganic arsenic in human beings, and total urine 
arsenic to reflect water arsenic exposure in survey participants. To isolate exposure to water arsenic, we expanded a 
residual-based method to remove tobacco and dietary sources of urinary DMA and total arsenic. We also applied EPA 
risk-assessment approaches to estimate the expected annual number of avoided skin or lung and bladder cancer cases 
comparing arsenic exposure in 2013–14 with 2003–04.
Findings We obtained data from 14 127 individuals who participated in the NHANES between 2003 and 2014. Among 
public water users, fully adjusted geometric means of DMA decreased from 3·01 µg/L in 2003–04 to 2·49 µg/L in 
2013–14 (17% reduction; 95% CI 10–24; p-trend<0·001); no change was observed in well water users (p-trend=0·35). 
Assuming these estimated exposure reductions will remain similar across a lifetime, we estimated a reduction of 
200–900 lung and bladder cancer cases or 50 cases of skin cancer per year depending on the approach used.
Interpretation The decrease in urinary arsenic observed in public water but not private well users in NHANES 
2003–14 suggests that the implementation of the current maximum contaminant level regulation is associated with 
reduced arsenic exposure in the US population. Our study suggests that well water users are inadequately protected 
against drinking water arsenic, and supports the crucial role of federal drinking water regulations in reducing toxic 
exposures and protecting human health.

Introduction
Arsenic is an established carcinogen naturally occurring 
in drinking water across the USA.1 Inorganic arsenic is 
associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, 
including lung, skin, and bladder cancers, skin lesions 
and cardiovascular disease. Drinking water and diet are 
the main sources of chronic low-level arsenic exposure in 
the US population.2 For decades, the US Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) set the maximum contaminant 
level for arsenic in public water systems at 50 µg/L. In 
January 2006, the current arsenic maximum contaminant 
level (10 µg/L) took effect. The compliance determination 
process allowed additional time to test and address non-
compliance for public water systems with mean annual 
arsenic concentrations exceeding 10 µg/L based on 
quarterly samples. However, private wells, the main 
source of drinking water for roughly 45·5 million 
Americans, are not enforced under the arsenic maximum 
contaminant level.3 In 2000, EPA estimated that the 
excess population risk of lung and bladder cancer at 
water arsenic concentrations of 50 µg/L were between 
1 in 100 and 1 in 300.4 The effect of the 2006 maximum 
contaminant level change on individual arsenic exposure 
in the USA is unknown.
Using data from a national population survey (National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES]), 
we aimed to assess national trends in water arsenic 
exposure from 2003 through 2014. We hypothesised that 
urinary arsenic concentrations would decrease over time 
in participants who relied on public water systems but 
not in those who used well water. The public NHANES 
database does not allow public access to geographical 
information of the participants; however, Mexican-
Americans in the USA are more likely to live in the

southwest.5 In the southwest, many cities’ public water 
supplies come from water sources with naturally 
occurring arsenic above the maximum contaminant level 
(eg, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, Scottsdale, and Tucson) 
and the enactment of the current maximum contaminant 
level regulation has resulted in infrastructure invest-
ments to ensure water arsenic is lower than 10 µg/L.6 We 
therefore hypothesised that the decrease in urinary 
arsenic concentrations would be more pronounced in 
Mexican-American NHANES participants. 
Methods 
Data source and population
In this survey analysis, we analysed data from the 
2003–14 cycles of NHANES, a nationally-representative 
sample 
of 
the 
general 
non-institutionalised 
US 
population.7 NHANES is conducted by the National 
Center for Health Statistics which is part of the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. NHANES employs a 
multi-stage, cluster-sampling design in 2-year cycles to 
ensure nationally-representative samples and the 
evaluation of trends over time. Participants complete an 
in-person 
interview, 
dietary 
recall, 
and 
physical 
examination. All NHANES protocols were approved by 
the NCHS institutional review board, and all participants 
gave written informed consent. Our study was exempt 
from institutional review board approval because we 
used de-identified, publicly available data.
Although the change in the maximum contaminant 
level regulation from 50 to 10 µg/L was initiated in 2006, 
the compliance determination process under the 
drinking water arsenic rule allowed time to test and 
address a level exceedance. Therefore, we studied the 
effect of the maximum contaminant level on drinking 
water arsenic concentrations and subsequent exposures 
by comparing urinary arsenic measurements from 
NHANES participants in the 2003–04 cycle (ie, before 
the implementation of the maximum contaminant level 
change) with those from the 2013–14 cycle, assuming full 
compliance with the new maximum contaminant level at 
that point in time.
Additionally, we estimated the expected number of 
avoidable skin or lung and bladder cancer cases assuming 
exposure reductions persisted across the lifetime.
Urine arsenic measurements
In the survey, arsenic was measured in spot urine 
samples in a one-third random subsample of participants 
aged 6 years and older (n=16 332). Total urinary arsenic 
concentrations were measured via inductively coupled 
plasma-mass spectrometry with dynamic reaction cell 
(ICP-DRC-MS), and speciated arsenic concentrations 
were established via high-performance liquid chromato-
graphy (HPLC) coupled to ICP-MS; these analyses have 
been described elsewhere in detail.8 
We used dimethylarsinate (DMA), the main metabolite 
of inorganic arsenic in human beings, and total urine 
arsenic to reflect water arsenic exposure. Inter-assay 
coefficients of variation varied from 2·2% to 6·0% for 
DMA and from 1·0 to 19·4% for total arsenic. The limit 
of detection varied from 1·70 to 1·91 μg/L for DMA and 
from 0·26 to 0·74 μg/L for total arsenic. The percentage 
of samples below the limit of detection was 17·2% for 
DMA and 0% for total arsenic. Undetectable DMA was 
replaced by the limit of detection divided by the square 
root of two.9 Arsenite, arsenate, and monomethylarsonate 
were not studied as their limits of detection were too 
high and the concentrations for these substances were 
mostly undetectable. Participants missing DMA, arseno-
betaine, total arsenic, BMI, education, urinary creatinine, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched for articles published in English in Pubmed, 
MEDLINE, and Embase up to July 27, 2017, using the following 
search terms: “arsenic” AND “EPA” or “Environmental Protection 
Agency” AND “MCL” or “Maximum Contaminant Level”. We 
found no studies that assessed the effect of the implementation 
of the 2006 maximum contaminant level regulation on reducing 
arsenic exposure at the individual level or by using biomarker 
data. One study identified through hand search did not assess 
individual exposure, but found that arsenic maximum 
contaminant level violations decreased in California after 2010, 
suggesting that arsenic concentrations in drinking water 
decreased in California several years after implementation of the 
current regulation in 2006.
Added value of this study
These novel nationally representative estimates derived from 
urinary arsenic support that the implementation of the 
current maximum contaminant level Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) regulation has decreased drinking 
water arsenic exposure in residents reliant on public water but 
not in private well users. Well water users remain inadequately 
protected against drinking water arsenic, especially residents 
of lower socioeconomic status who are less likely to test for 
arsenic and maintain treatment systems. Our risk analysis 
estimates the expected number of avoided skin or lung and 
bladder cancer cases based on arsenic exposure reductions 
measured in NHANES.
Implications of all the available evidence
Subsequent research should assess changes in arsenic 
exposure geographically, by population subgroups, and 
evaluate the economic and health impact of arsenic exposure 
reduction.

. 
Exposure assessment analysis
Urinary arsenic integrates multiple exposure sources, 
including 
water, 
diet, 
and 
tobacco, 
which 
are 
contaminated with arsenic of anthropogenic or natural 
origins. Seafood contributes high concentrations of 
arsenobetaine and other largely non-toxic organic 
arsenicals to urine arsenic.10 To isolate exposure to water 
arsenic, we expanded a residual-based method previously 
validated to remove the contribution of seafood, to also 
remove tobacco and other dietary sources of urinary 
DMA and total arsenic.11 Estimated urinary DMA and 
total arsenic concentrations reflecting water arsenic were 
obtained by first regressing their original log- 
transformed concentrations (μg/L) on log-transformed 
arsenobetaine (μg/L), smoking status (never, former, or 
current), and past 24-h intake of rice, cereals, juice, wine, 
chicken, and turkey (log-transformed g/kg bodyweight). 
The conditional means of urinary DMA and total arsenic 
among non-smoking participants with undetectable 
arsenobetaine and no arsenic dietary sources were then 
added back to model residuals to estimate the amount of 
urinary DMA and total arsenic that probably represents 
water arsenic exposure in the US population.
Food intake was derived from past 24-h dietary recalls 
using recipe codes from the Food Commodity Index 
Database, averaging commodity weights across all recipe 
modification codes.12 Cereal intake was derived using 
United States Department of Agriculture food codes only 
because no Food Commodity Index Database codes exist 
for cereal. Urinary cotinine is not yet available in the 
NHANES public database for the 2013–14 cycle, 
preventing us from using cotinine in addition to self-
reported smoking in our correction. The appendix (p 1) 
shows the distributions of estimated urinary total arsenic 
and DMA likely due to drinking water.
Geometric means and geometric mean ratios of urinary 
DMA and total arsenic comparing each subsequent 2-year 
cycle to NHANES 2003–04 were estimated separately for 
participants reporting a primary tap water source of “well 
or rain cistern” (categorised as well water users as rain 
cisterns are rare) and “community supply” (categorised as 
public water users) during the interview. Participants who 
reported not drinking tap water were excluded from this 
analysis. Geometric means and geometric mean ratios 
were adjusted for sex, age, race and ethnic origin, BMI, 
and education. We conducted sensitivity analyses further 
adjusting for urinary creatinine with similar results (data 
not shown). All analyses were done with R (version 3.1.2) 
using the survey package to account for NHANES 
complex sampling design and weights.13, 14
Risk analyses
Although the change in the maximum contaminant level 
regulation from 50 to 10 μg/L was initiated in 2006, the 
compliance determination process under the drinking 
water arsenic rule allowed time to test and address a level 
exceedance. Therefore, we studied the effect of the 
maximum contaminant level on drinking water arsenic 
concentrations and subsequent exposures by comparing 
urinary arsenic measurements from NHANES participants 
in the 2003–04 cycle (ie, before the implementation of the 
maximum contaminant level change) with those from the 
2013–14 cycle, assuming full compliance with the new 
maximum contaminant level at that point in time.
Water arsenic exposure was estimated from both urinary 
DMA and total arsenic measurements. For total arsenic, 
we assumed that water arsenic was present solely in the 
inorganic form and that the ratio of urinary arsenic to 
ingested water arsenic was 1:1 μg/L, based on earlier work 
in Taiwan and the USA.15,16 In the study population, the 
mean proportion of DMA in urinary total arsenic was 74%. 
We thus estimated water inorganic arsenic concentrations 
by multiplying urinary DMA concentrations by 1·36, 
assuming that water arsenic exposure is entirely inorganic 
arsenic.1
Bodyweight-adjusted lifetime average daily inorganic 
arsenic dose was estimated by multiplying the drinking 
water arsenic concentration by the mean drinking water 
consumption rate for individuals aged 21 years and older 
(only in those who reported consuming tap water) and 
dividing by the mean adult bodyweight (80 kg).17 We 
estimated cancer risks by multiplying the resulting 
lifetime average daily inorganic arsenic dose by the EPA 
Integrated Risk Information System inorganic arsenic 
cancer slope factor.18 Risks were calculated separately 
using the current slope factor of 1·5 per mg (kg 
bodyweight-day)–1, corresponding to skin cancer,19 and the 
2010 proposed slope factor of 25·7 per mg (kg bodyweight-
day)–1 for combined lung and bladder cancers.20
Expected 70-year cancer burdens were calculated by 
multiplying the estimated risks by the size of the 
population at risk. Burdens were calculated for the portion 
of the US population served by public water systems and 
separately for Mexican-Americans served by public water 
systems. The size of the US population served by public 
water systems was calculated by multiplying the 2014 US 
Census Bureau population estimate (318 563 456 people) 
by the fraction of the overall NHANES sample served by 
public water systems (70·3%). The size of the Mexican-
American population was calculated by multiplying the 
2014 US Census Bureau population estimate by the 
Mexican-American fraction (9·4%), and then by the 
fraction of Mexican-Americans served by public water 
systems (61·5%). 70-year cancer burdens were divided by 
70 to give an annual number of expected cancer cases due 
to the consumption of arsenic in drinking water. The 
number of cancer cases avoided as a result of the 
maximum contaminant level was calculated by subtracting 
the expected post-maximum contaminant level change 
2013–2014 cancer burden from the pre-maximum 
contaminant level change cancer burden.

For purposes of comparison, risks and burdens were 
also estimated using the dose-response method and 
metrics employed in the benefit-cost analysis supporting 
the establishment of the 10 μg/L maximum contaminant 
level.19 Adhering to the methods used by EPA, we 
calculated sex-specific unit cancer risk factors (Runit) for 
bladder and lung cancers by dividing 0·01 by the excess 
doses associated with 1% risk of bladder and lung 
cancers (ED01) and the lower bounds on those doses 
(LED01) from Model 1 as presented by Morales and 
colleagues.3 This model employs an exponential linear 
dose effect with a quadratic age effect and does not use a 
reference population. Using this approach, risk was 
estimated by multiplying gender-weighted, lung-specific 
and bladder-specific Runits (in cases per person per μg/L) 
by drinking water arsenic concentrations (estimated as 
described above). Lung and bladder cancer burdens and 
cases avoided were calculated from risk and population 
at risk estimates as described above. The appendix (p 3) 
provides an example derivation for estimating the 
number of avoided lung and bladder cancer cases using 
total arsenic estimations.

Results
We analysed data from 14 127 participants from the 
2003–14 NHANES. Over the 10-year study period, the 
population in each of the 2-year NHANES cycles became 
older, more racially and ethnically diverse, and the 
prevalence of never-smoking and wine intake increased 
(table 1). The percentage of the population served by 
public water and private well systems remained similar.

Median DMA concentrations for the entire study 
population were higher before versus after removing 
dietary and tobacco sources of arsenic (3·46 μg/L [IQR 
2·00–5·82] vs 2·63 μg/L [1·56–4·22]); a similar change 
was observed for total arsenic (7·15 μg/L [3·68–14·99] vs 
4·07 μg/L [2·69– 6·12]; table 1).
Figure 1 shows the distribution of urinary DMA and 
total arsenic for both public water and private well users 
stratified by NHANES survey cycle. After adjustment, the 
estimated geometric mean of urinary DMA for public 
water users likely related to drinking water remained 
similar between NHANES 2003–04 and 2009–10 
(3·01 µg/L vs 2·93 µg/L, respectively) but decreased in 
NHANES 2011–12 (2·64 µg/L) and NHANES 2013–14 
(2·49 µg/L) on both the absolute and relative scales 
(p-trend <0·001; figure 2). For private well users, the 
estimated geometric mean of urinary DMA increased 
from NHANES 2003–04 to 2013–2014 (2·38 µg/L to 
2·59 µg/L), but the overall trend was not significant 
(p-trend 0·35). The estimated geometric mean of total 
arsenic was more heterogeneous in both public water 
and well water users, slightly increasing from 2003–04 
(4·60 µg/L) to 2009–10 (5·18 µg/L), but decreasing in 
2011–12 (3·32 µg/L; p-trend<0.001) for public water users 
(figure 2). Among private well users, total arsenic was 
lower in 2011–12 than in 2003–04 (2·82 µg/L vs 
4·24 µg/L), but it was higher again in 2013–14 (3·23 µg/L; 
figure 2).
Among Mexican-Americans using public water, 
between 2003 and 2014, geometric means of DMA 
decreased (4·06 µg/L to 2·58 µg/L; 36% reduction; 
95% CI 25–46; p-trend <0·001) as did total arsenic 
(6·05 µg/L to 3·18 µg/L; 47% reduction; 95% CI 40–54; 
p-trend <0·001; table 2). 
Based on our estimates of arsenic exposure reduction 
in the US population served by public water systems, we 
estimated the actual number of cancer cases avoided by 
lowering the arsenic maximum contaminant level to 
10 µg/L using exposure measurements from NHANES 
combined with the current19 and proposed20 cancer slope 
factors from the Integrated Risk Information System 
programme, as well as with drinking water unit cancer

exposure, the annual reduction in lung and bladder 
cancer was 200 cases avoided based on the 2000 EPA 
benefit-cost analysis approach21 versus 900 cases avoided 
using the 2010 EPA proposed slope factor.20 Using the 
current EPA slope factor,19 the estimated annual reduction 
in cases of skin cancer was 50 (table 3). Table 3 provides 
estimates derived using changes in urinary total arsenic.
Discussion
The decrease in urinary arsenic in public water users in 
NHANES 2003–14 supports the hypothesis that the 
implementation of the current arsenic maximum 
contaminant level regulation has reduced arsenic 
exposure in the general US population. The decrease was 
only observed after the 2009–10 cycle, consistent with the 
reported violations in the state of California and the 
compliance determination process of the drinking water 
arsenic rule, which required time for testing and time to 
address a maximum contaminant level exceedance 
(eg, change source or install water treatment).20,21
Exceedance of the maximum contaminant level for the 
drinking water arsenic rule is based on a running annual 
average of quarterly samples. Public water systems were 
allowed up to 1 year of additional sampling time since 
the required initial sample (which had to be collected by

in public water versus well water users stratified by NHANES cycle
Squares and lines represent geometric mean ratio estimates and 95% CIs. Recalibrated urine DMA and total arsenic were obtained from residuals regressing each 
log-transformed arsenic variable (DMA and total arsenic) on smoking status (never, ever, current), natural log-transformed arsenobetaine, and natural 
log-transformed intake of rice, cereals, juices, wine, chicken, and turkey in g/kg bodyweight per day. Geometric means were further adjusted for age, race or ethnic

December, 2006, for surface water systems and by 
December, 2007, for groundwater systems) before a 
compliance determination was made. This time lag can 
be observed in California’s public water supply arsenic 
violation data, which suggest that it took several years for 
the California public water supply systems to first 
identify and then comply with the arsenic rule, with 
violations gradually decreasing after 2008.23 In view of 
the built-in time delay of full enforcement of the 10 µg/L 
maximum contaminant level, the similarity in geometric 
means for urinary DMA and total arsenic concentrations 
between 2003–04 and 2007–08 among public water users 
provides an indication of the amount of natural variability 
in water arsenic exposure over time, enhancing our 
confidence in the changes recorded in the later years.
For public water users, we estimated a reduction in 
water arsenic exposure of 17% from 2003 to 2014, which 
represents a substantial exposure reduction when 
applied at the population level. It is unknown whether 
these positive changes in arsenic prevention have 
occurred across all US geographic and geological regions 
because this spatial analysis is not possible with the 
NHANES public database. However, the decrease was 
markedly stronger in Mexican-Americans than in 
the overall population. These findings support that the 
recent infrastructure investments in many cities in the 
southwest that focused on ensuring water arsenic was 
lower than 10 µg/L is associated with reduced arsenic 
exposure in the population.5
The 
National 
Cancer 
Institute’s 
Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) programme 
estimated 301 530 new combined lung and bladder 
cancer cases for 2017
.24 In its benefit-cost analysis in 
support of revising the arsenic in drinking water rule, 
EPA estimated an annual reduction of 37·4–55·7 
combined lung and bladder cancer cases at a maximum 
contaminant level of 10 µg/L.19 The EPA did not quantify 
the reduction in number of skin cancer cases at the time. 
Using the same unit cancer risk factor employed in the 
2000 EPA benefit-cost analysis for the arsenic maximum 
contaminant level, we estimated an avoidance of 200 lung 
and bladder cancer cases using our measured exposure 
reductions from NHANES, as compared with EPA’s 
original estimate of 37·4–55·7 avoided cases per year. 
One explanation for this difference might lie in EPA’s 
assumptions regarding exposure reduction; in its benefit-
cost analysis, EPA assumed that for water systems with 
arsenic concentrations in excess of 10 µg/L before the 
implementation of the new maximum contaminant 
level, post-implementation concentrations would be 
8 µg/L.19 In reality, investments made across US public 
water systems might have been more effective than EPA 
originally assumed, possibly resulting in reductions in 
arsenic in water much lower than 8 µg/L.
In view of the lack of consensus (and associated 
uncertainty) regarding the appropriate cancer dose-
response metric, it is probably better to interpret

The original 2000 EPA analysis had estimated 37·4–55·7 annual cases of lung and bladder cancer avoided in the overall 
US population.21 The number of annual skin cancer cases avoided was not estimated in the original 2000 EPA analysis. 
*The EPA 2000 benefit-cost analysis used the unit cancer risk factor (also called drinking water unit risk) to estimate 
the number of cases avoided per year instead of a cancer slope factor.21 †The current EPA cancer slope factor was 
established in 1995 for skin cancer only, and it is the only cancer slope factor that has been finalised in the Integrated 
Risk Information System.19 ‡The EPA proposed cancer slope factor was proposed by the EPA for combined lung and 
bladder cancer in 2010 but it has never been finalised.20 NHANES=National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

Table 3: Estimated annual number of cancer cases avoided by lowering the arsenic maximum contaminant 
level from 50 to 10 µg/L based on estimated arsenic exposure reduction (using DMA or total arsenic) in the 
US population served by public water systems comparing NHANES 2013–14 with NHANES 2003–04
estimations with just one significant figure; the difference 
between these estimations depends largely on the 
dose-response metric used. Although the 2010 EPA 
proposed slope factor has been controversial, it assumes 
a linear-dose response, which is consistent with the 
approach used by EPA for most carcinogens, and is 
supported by the findings of recent studies of arsenic and 
lung and bladder cancer at low-to-moderate arsenic 
exposure concentrations in US populations.25,26 Although 
arsenic is toxic for multiple organs and systems, we did 
not consider additional non-cancer endpoints, which 
EPA considered qualitatively. Additionally, EPA’s risk 
assessment approach does not address the synergistic 
effects of tobacco smoking status and inorganic arsenic 
exposure on cancer risk. Given that the proportion of 
never smokers increased in the US population throughout 
the study period, it is possible that the current approach 
overestimates the effect of arsenic reduction on cancer 
risk. A more sophisticated risk assessment approach 
could assess slope factors separately for smokers and 
non-smokers and could consider changes in the 
population smoking status over time.
Additional analyses are needed to fully assess the 
potential economic benefits associated with the 
implementation of the current maximum contaminant 
level. In 2007, SEER estimated that lung and bladder 
cancer together result in 2 523 000 years of life lost and a 
loss of productivity cost of US$40 billion for the US 
population.27 It is likely that the indirect economic benefit 
of avoiding 200–900 excess cancer cases per year over 
several generations experiencing reduced exposure could 
outweigh the initial capital costs and continuing 
operation and maintenance costs of implementing 
arsenic-reduction initiatives for public water systems.

We noted no consistent changes in urinary arsenic 
concentrations in private well users between 2003 and 
2014. However, the results for well-water users should be 
interpreted cautiously in view of the small sample size 
within each survey cycle and the possibility that well-water 
users sampled in NHANES are not geographically 
representative of the underlying population of well users 
in the USA because NHANES did not intentionally 
oversample for this population subgroup, which is 
markedly smaller in size as compared with the 
public-water users. While estimated concentrations of 
urinary total arsenic for well users decreased in the 
2011–12 cycle compared with the 2003–04 cycle, these 
results were not consistent for urinary DMA, the primary 
metabolite of inorganic arsenic. Although the EPA 
maximum contaminant level does not apply to private 
wells, testing and treatment for arsenic in drinking water 
among US residents relying on private well water differs 
widely by state and by socioeconomic status.28 In 
NHANES, urinary DMA and total arsenic concen 
trations 
were lower in well-water users compared with public-water 
users. No previous study has compared arsenic exposure 
concentrations in populations served by public water 
systems or private wells in the USA. The geographic 
clustering of high-arsenic wells throughout the USA and 
the challenges to adequately sample the vast US rural 
areas in NHANES could explain higher inter-survey 
variability and wider confidence intervals in urine arsenic 
concentrations in the population served by private wells 
compared with the population served by community 
water systems. It has been estimated that 1·7 million 
Americans are at risk of exposure to arsenic concentrations 
higher than 10 µg/L and 3·8 million to arsenic 
concentrations higher than 5 µg/L in household well 
water.29 Efforts are needed to protect affected private well 
water users from arsenic exposure. In New Jersey, for 
instance, all wells need to be tested for water contaminants 
(including arsenic in northern counties) as part of any 
real estate transaction via the Private Well Testing Act,30 
but only about one quarter of private wells in the northern 
parts of New Jersey have been tested for arsenic through 
this act. For affected wells, families can receive a no-
interest loan to pay for the purchase and installation of a 
water treatment system. Although the Private Well 
Testing Act has resulted in the installation of more arsenic 
treatment systems in northern New Jersey, no state 
government requires homeowners to install treatment 
systems to reduce arsenic if test results for arsenic exceed 
the maximum contaminant level. Moreover, many private 
well owners who test for arsenic continue to experience 
drinking water arsenic concentrations greater than the 
maximum contaminant level due to incorrect or 
improperly maintained treatment systems.31 Additional 
state and federal initiatives are needed to help families 
sample, test, and address arsenic exposure from 
unregulated private wells.31 Nationally representative 
studies of private well water users are needed to assess 
whether testing and treatment behaviours have changed 
over time for the US population.
Additional limitations of this study include the lack of 
directly measured water arsenic in the study participants 
and the possibility that our water arsenic estimation 
method might have incompletely removed other sources 
of arsenic (eg, airborne arsenic, which is likely minimal).32 
In estimating water arsenic via our residual-based method, 
we accounted for the contribution of past 24 h intake of 
arsenic-containing foods (eg, rice, poultry, juices, wine, 
and cereals) to both DMA and total arsenic. Urinary 
arsenic concentrations reflect exposure from the previous 
1–3 days. In addition to dietary recall bias, it is possible 
that the 24-h dietary recall method did not fully remove the 
contribution of arsenic from these dietary sources. Also, 
because NHANES does not provide public information on 
the counties selected for sampling in each cycle, we cannot 
assess whether counties with lower overall arsenic 
exposure in public water systems were more likely to be 
recruited in later compared with earlier years.
In conclusion, following the implementation of the 
2006 EPA maximum contaminant level regulation, 
arsenic exposure decreased in public-water users but not 
in private-well users. Our study supports that residents 
who rely on public water systems have experienced 
reductions in drinking water arsenic exposure and 
confirms the crucial role of federal drinking water 
regulations in reducing toxic exposures and protecting 
human health.33–35
