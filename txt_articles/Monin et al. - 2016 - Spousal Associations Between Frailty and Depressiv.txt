OBJECTIVES: To determine whether older adult spouses’
frailty states and depressive symptoms are interrelated over
time.
DESIGN: Longitudinal, dyadic path analysis using the
Actor–Partner Interdependence Model.
SETTING: Data were from baseline (1989–90), Wave 3
(1992–93), and Wave 7 (1996–97), all waves in which
frailty and depressive symptoms were measured, of the
Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a multisite, longitudi-
nal, observational study of risk factors for cardiovascular
disease in adults aged 65 and older.
PARTICIPANTS: Spouses in 1,260 community-dwelling
married couples.
MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was measured using the CHS
criteria, categorized as nonfrail, prefrail, or frail. Depres-
sive symptoms were measured using the 10-item Center
for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.
RESULTS: Within
individuals
(actor
effects),
greater
frailty predicted greater subsequent depressive symptoms,
and greater depressive symptoms predicted greater subse-
quent frailty. Between spouses (partner effects), an individ-
ual’s greater frailty predicted the spouse’s greater frailty,
and an individual’s greater depressive symptoms predicted
the spouse’s greater depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Frailty
and
depressive
symptoms
are
interrelated in older adult spouses. For older couples, inter-
ventions to prevent or treat frailty and depression that
focus on couples may be more effective than those that
focus on individuals. J Am Geriatr Soc 64:824–830, 2016.
Key words: frailty; depression; dyadic analysis
F
railty is a syndrome that predicts vulnerability to dis-
ability, and it affects one in 10 older adults.1,2 A per-
son is considered frail if he or she has three or more of
unintentional weight loss (10 pounds in past year), self-
reported exhaustion, weakness (grip strength), slow walk-
ing speed, and low physical activity. One or two of these
characteristics indicates that a person is prefrail. Frailty
has been associated with greater risk of disability, falls,
hospitalization, and shorter lifespan.2,3 Research has also
shown that frailty and depression are highly related,2,4 but
when examining frailty and depression, information about
social environmental influences is missing. For older mar-
ried adults, spouses tend to have similar characteristics,
engage in shared activities, and live in the same environ-
ment, making their health interdependent.5 There is evi-
dence
of
effective
interventions
to
prevent
and
treat
frailty6 and depression7 separately in individuals, but if
spouses’ frailty and depressive symptoms are intertwined,
there may be synergistic effects on health when interven-
tions address frailty and depressive symptoms and are
designed for couples.
Although no research to the authors’ knowledge has
examined spousal associations in frailty and depressive
symptoms, studies have documented spousal associations
in instrumental activities of daily living8, physical activity,9
and depressive symptoms. It is proposed that one spouse’s
frailty influences the other spouse’s depressive symptoms
through multiple mechanisms. First, spouses of frail indi-
viduals frequently act as caregivers, and caregiving can
lead
to
depression.10
Second,
frail
spouses
are
often
depressed, which can be contagious.11 Depressive symp-
toms may lead to greater frailty through different mecha-
nisms.
Depression
can
reduce
the
couple’s
social
activity.12,13 Also, depressed spouses may lack the energy
to provide support to their partners, exacerbating the part-
ner’s health problems.14 Multiple relationship theories also
suggest that one person’s frailty can affect their partner’s
depressive symptoms directly. For example, Inclusion of
the Other in the Self theory states that individuals incorpo-
rate the characteristics of their partners (e.g., frailty) into
their own sense of well-being.15

 In this study, it was first hypothesized that, within
each individual, greater frailty would predict greater subse-
quent frailty and that greater depressive symptoms would
predict increases in subsequent depressive symptoms (hy-
pothesis (H)1a and b; actor effects). Second, it was
hypothesized that an individual’s greater frailty would pre-
dict greater frailty in their spouse; the same was expected
for depressive symptoms (H2a and b; partner effects).
Third, it was hypothesized that, within individuals, there
would be a bidirectional association between frailty and
depressive symptoms (H3; actor effects). Fourth, it was
hypothesized that there would be a bidirectional associa-
tion between an individual’s frailty and the spouse’s
depressive symptoms (H4; partner effects). These hypothe-
ses were tested using the Actor Partner Interdependence
Model (APIM16), which takes into account how couple
members’ data are related.
METHODS
Data and Sample Characteristics
Data were from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a
population-based longitudinal study designed to determine
risk factors for cardiovascular disease in adults aged 65
and older. The CHS recruited participants from four U.S.
communities: Forsyth County, North Carolina; Sacra-
mento County, California; Washington County, Maryland;
and
Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.
Participants
underwent
annual clinical examinations and structured interviews.
The present study includes data from three waves: baseline
(1989–90), Wave 3 (1992–93), and Wave 7 (1996–97).
The CHS sample included 5,201 individuals enrolled in
1989–90, with an additional cohort of 687 African Ameri-
cans enrolled in 1992–93. More information about the
design and sample is available.17
Measures
Frailty
Frailty was defined using CHS criteria, which include defi-
cits in five areas: low weight, physical inactivity, exhaustion,
weakness, and slowness.2 Low weight was defined as a self-
reported or calculated loss of 10% or more in body mass
index (BMI) since the previous wave or a current BMI of less
than 18.5 kg/m2. Physical activity was calculated as the
average frequency of three activity intensities weighted
according to average metabolic equivalency of task (MET)
scores (mild, 1–3 MET; moderate, 3–6 MET; vigorous,
6–10 MET). Physical inactivity was defined as being in the
lowest 20% on the physical activity score stratified accord-
ing to sex. Exhaustion was defined according to endorse-
ment of one of two items from the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).18 Weakness was defined
as having dominant hand grip strength below sex- and BMI-
specific cut-points as established in the CHS. Slowness was
defined as a speed of less than 0.762 m/s for women taller
than 159 cm or men taller than 173 cm and less than 0.653
m/s for women 159 cm tall or less or men 173 cm tall or
less, measured on a 2.5-m course.2,19 Individuals were char-
acterized as nonfrail, prefrail, or nonfrail at each wave.
Depressive symptoms
A modified version of the CES-D assessed self-reported
depressive symptoms experienced during the 7 days preced-
ing the clinic visit.18 The scale consists of 10 symptoms,
each scored from 0 to 3, for a maximum of 30 points.
Higher scores indicate greater frequency of symptoms.
Covariates
Age, sex, race, and education were examined as potential
covariates. Perceived social support was also examined as
a covariate because of its theoretical relevance to frailty,
depression, and disability.20 The Interpersonal Support
Evaluation List21 was used to assess the perceived avail-
ability of belonging (emotional), appraisal (informational),
and tangible (instrumental) support. Example items assess-
ing belonging (2 items) and appraisal (2 items) support
respectively are: “When I feel lonely, there are several peo-
ple I can talk to,” and “When I need suggestions on how
to deal with a personal problem, I know someone I can
turn to.” Tangible support was measured with: “If I were
sick, I could easily find someone to help me with my daily
chores” (only one item used for tangible support because
of low reliability with the two items). All items were rated
on a 4-point scale from 1 (definitely false) to 4 (definitely
true). Scores were averaged.
Analysis
First, correlations between baseline depressive symptoms
and potential covariates and differences in covariates were
examined according to baseline frailty status using analy-
ses of variance (ANOVAs). Covariates were included in
the main models at a P < .10 threshold. Next, how each
spouse’s frailty and depressive symptoms changed and the
extent to which frailty statuses matched at each wave were
described.
To test the main hypotheses, path analyses were con-
ducted using Mplus 7.3, which uses full information maxi-
mum likelihood estimation to use all available data.22 The
analysis of dyadic data is often problematic because of
nonindependence among responses (e.g., spouses’ depres-
sive symptoms are often highly related). Analyzing mem-
bers of the dyad separately is one way to avoid statistical
problems due to nonindependence, but this approach fails
to incorporate the interdependence of dyad members. The
Actor–Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) incorpo-
rates this interdependence by combining data from both
partners into one analysis and providing information about
whether wives influence husbands and vice versa.9,16,23
Because past research suggests that the association
between frailty and depressive symptoms is bidirectional,4
two models were run. In Model 1, frailty states of both
spouses were set to predict changes in both partner’s
depressive symptoms at Waves 3 and 7 (controlling for
covariates). The focus was on the influence of one’s frailty
state on changes in subsequent depression. It was not
hypothesized that these relationships would be different at
each wave. Thus, all like effects (baseline to Wave 3, Wave
3 to Wave 7) were set to be equal. Figure 1 illustrates the
proposed model with actor and partner effects for frailty

 predicting depressive symptoms. Model 2 examined actor
and partner effects for depressive symptoms predicting
frailty states. More information is available about includ-
ing ordinal, or ordered categorical, outcomes (e.g., frailty)
in path analysis.24,25
Coefficients of determination were calculated to deter-
mine the amount of variance that the predictors accounted
for in the outcomes. Three model fit indices are reported:
the confirmatory fit index (CFI), the Tucker Lewis Index
(TLI), and the root mean squared error of approximation
(RMSEA).26 CFI values greater than 0.95, TLI values
greater than 0.90,27 and RMSEA values less than 0.08,27
reflect good fit of a specified model to the data.
RESULTS
Description of the Sample
Of the original CHS sample, 2,524 reported being mar-
ried, and data were available for 1,260 couples. One hun-
dred sixteen husbands and 39 wives were deceased at
Wave 3, and 351 husbands and 132 wives were deceased
at Wave 7. Two husbands and two wives indicated they
were caregivers. Couples were evenly distributed among
the CHS sites (Forsyth County, NC: n = 306; Sacramento
County, CA: n = 334; Washington County, MD: n = 348;
Pittsburgh,
PA:
n = 272).
Five
hundred
ninety-nine
(49.6%) couples reported an annual income of less than
$25,000, 397 (33.2%) reported between $25,000 and
$49,999, and 206 (17.2%) reported greater than $50,000.
The mean age of husbands was 73.6 � 5.3 and of
wives was 71.2 � 4.7. One thousand one hundred twenty-
five husbands (97%) were white, 30 (2.4%) were black,
three (0.2%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, and
two (0.2%) were other; 13 (1%) were Hispanic. One
thousand two hundred twenty-nine wives (97.5%) were
white, 27 (2.1%) were black, two (0.2%) were Asian or
Pacific Islander, one was American Indian or Alaska
native, and one (0.1%) was other; nine (0.7%) were His-
panic. Husbands had a mean of 14.2 � 5.0 years of edu-
cation, and wives had 13.9 � 4.2.
Description of Missing Data
ANOVAs examining differences in baseline characteristics
between participants who had data from all three, two, or
one wave showed that participants who had more missing
data were older (husbands: F = 54.77, P < .001; wives:
F = 46.08, P < .001), less educated (husbands: F = 22.57,
P < .001; wives: F = 17.42, P < .001), and more depressed
(husbands:
F = 10.87,
P < .001;
wives:
F = 5.79,
P = .003). More missing data were associated with more
support for husbands (F = 3.17, P = .04). The more data
that were missing, the more husbands were likely to be
frail (no missing: not frail n = 334, prefrail n = 243, frail
n = 15; one wave missing: not frail n = 155, prefrail
n = 195, frail n = 18; two waves missing: not frail n = 75,
prefrail
n = 156,
frail
n = 37;
chi-square = 91.83,
P < .001). For wives, the more data that were missing, the
more likely they were to be prefrail (no missing: not frail
n = 295, prefrail n = 268, frail n = 30; one wave missing:
not frail n = 156, prefrail n = 174, frail n = 37; two waves
missing: not frail n = 86, prefrail n = 154, frail n = frail;
chi-square = 30.75, P < .001).

FRAILTY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS
827
 Covariates
Older husbands were more depressed (correlation coeffi-
cient (r) = 0.07, P = .01 and frailer (F = 25.84, P < .001)
than younger husbands. Older wives were not more
depressed (r = 0.02, P = .45) but were frailer (F = 39.84,
P < .001)
than
younger
wives.
Nonfrail
husbands
(F = 16.62, P < .001) and wives (F = 11.51, P < .001) had
the highest education. Support was associated with greater
depressive symptom in husbands (r = 0.29, P < .001) and
wives (r = 0.32, P < .001). Wives who were frailer reported
greater support (F = 4.18, P = .02); there was a similar trend

All like effects (e.g., baseline to Wave 3; Wave 3 to Wave 7) were set to be equal, giving an overall test of whether previous scores influenced subsequent
scores. The fit indexes were confirmatory fit index (CFI) (0.913), Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) (0.859), and root mean squared error of approximation
(RMSEA) (0.057) for Model 1 and CFI (0.914), TLI (0.860), and RMSEA (0.057) for Model 2. Model 1 accounted for 37% of the variance in wives’
Wave 3 and 44% of Wave 7 depressive symptoms, 22% of Wave 3 and 49% of Wave 7 frailty; 38% of the variance in husbands’ Wave 3 and 38% of
Wave 7 depressive symptoms, 20% of Wave 3 and 45% in Wave 7 frailty. Model 2 accounted for 40% of the variance in wives’ Wave 3 and 45% of
Wave 7 depressive symptoms, 21% of Wave 3 and 44% of Wave 7 frailty; 41% of the variance in husbands’ Wave 3 and 38% of Wave 7 depressive
symptoms, 18% of Wave 3 and 41% of Wave 7 frailty. In both models, frailty was entered as an ordinal variable with possible values of 0 (nonfrail), 1
(prefrail), and 2 (frail). Covariates in each model included both partners’ ages, social support, and education.

 for husbands (F = 2.72, P = .07). In the final models, both
spouses’ ages, education, and support were included as covari-
ates.
Description of Husbands’ and Wives’ Frailty and
Depressive Symptoms over Time
Table 1 shows how frailty changed over time for husbands
and wives and the extent to which frailty status matched.
As previously reported, depressive symptoms increased for
husbands
(F(1.008) = 912.84,
P < .001)
and
wives
(F
(1.008) = 520.67, P < .001).9 Mean CES-D scores were
3.4 � 3.7 (n = 1,260) at baseline, 4.3 � 4.1 (n = 1,042)
at Wave 3, and 5.1 � 4.7 (n = 735) at Wave 7 for hus-
bands and 4.6 � 4.6 (n = 1,259) at baseline, 5.5 � 4.9
(n = 1,095) at Wave 3, and 6.1 � 4.9 (n = 917) at Wave
7 for wives.
Main Hypothesis Testing
Model estimates are presented in Table 2 for each hypothe-
sis. Supporting Hypothesis 1, Models 1 and 2 indicated
that, an individual’s greater frailty predicted greater subse-
quent frailty (actor effects). The same was true for depres-
sive symptoms. Supporting Hypothesis 2, Models 1 and 2
indicated that greater frailty in one spouse predicted greater
frailty in the other spouse (partner effects). The same was
true for depressive symptoms, with one exception. In
Model 1, wives’ depressive symptoms did not significantly
predict husbands’ depressive symptoms. Consistent with
Hypothesis 3, in both models, each individual’s greater
frailty was associated with greater depressive symptoms,
and greater depressive symptoms were associated with
greater frailty (actor effects). Finally, Hypothesis 4 was not
supported. The direct associations between one partner’s
frailty and the other partner’s depressive symptoms were
not statistically significant in either model.
DISCUSSION
This study examined associations between older spouses’
frailty and depressive symptoms over time. As hypothe-
sized, spouses’ frailty was associated, such that greater
frailty in one spouse was related to greater subsequent
frailty in the other spouse. This supports past findings that
older spouses’ physical health is interdependent8,28 and
extends this to frailty specifically. Because clinicians use
frailty criteria to classify individuals as vulnerable to dis-
ability and as a basis for designing interventions, it is
important to take into account that spouses’ frailty is
linked.
It was also found that an individual’s own greater
frailty was associated with his or her own greater subse-
quent depressive symptoms. It was also the case that an
individual’s own depressive symptoms were associated
with his or her own greater subsequent frailty. These find-
ings provide further evidence of bidirectional pathways
and potentially the diagnostic overlap4 of frailty and
depressive symptoms.4
Results for the direct associations between an individ-
ual’s frailty and the spouse’s depressive symptoms were
not statistically significant. This finding does not support
relational identity theories15 and findings from previous
research on disability and depressive symptoms,8 although
in general, spouses’ depressive symptoms were linked, sup-
porting affect contagion theory.11,29 Thus, it seems that
frailty is associated with depressive symptoms within an
individual and that the resulting depressive symptoms have
influences on spouses. It was also found that effects did
not differ for husbands and wives. This contrasts with pre-
vious work on physical activity9 and the theory that
women have more-interdependent identities than men.30
Strengths of this study include, first, that a large sam-
ple of older couples was used over a span of approxi-
mately 8 years. Second, the APIM,16 the state-of-the-art
approach for analyzing couples data, was used. Third, the
frailty measure included subjective and objective health
indicators. Limitations include that the CHS does not have
variables related to relationship functioning and caregiving
burden that would have shed light on mechanisms through
which frailty was related to depressive symptoms. Addi-
tional limitations include potential comorbidity, because it
was not possible to control for all possible medical condi-
tions in the model. Future research may benefit from using
other frailty measures and examining associations in more
ethnically diverse populations.
CONCLUSION
Spouses’ frailty and depressive symptoms are intertwined,
highlighting the need for clinicians to take into account
older adults’ close social environment when diagnosing
them and designing interventions to treat and prevent
frailty. Accounting for close partners’ shared activities
and environment may have additive or synergistic effects
on physical and psychological health. This work also
suggests that senior living communities may benefit from
increasing incentives and opportunities for couples to
engage
in
physical
activity,
socialization,
and
mutual
support together.
