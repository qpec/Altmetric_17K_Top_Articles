Lubricating the swordfish head

ABSTRACT
The swordfish is reputedly the fastest swimmer on Earth. The
concave head and iconic sword are unique characteristics, but how
they contribute to its speed is still unknown. Recent computed
tomography scans revealed a poorly mineralised area near the base
of the rostrum. Here we report, using magnetic resonance imaging
and electron microscopy scanning, the discovery of a complex organ
consisting of an oil-producing gland connected to capillaries that
communicate with oil-excreting pores in the skin of the head. The
capillary vessels transport oil to abundant tiny circular pores that are
surrounded by denticles. The oil is distributed from the pores over the
front part of the head. The oil inside the gland is identical to that found
on the skin and is a mixture of methyl esters. We hypothesize that the
oil layer, in combination with the denticles, creates a super-
hydrophobic layer that reduces streamwise friction drag and
increases swimming efficiency.

INTRODUCTION
Large
predatory
oceanic
fishes
show
unique
and
extreme
adaptations to hunt in the largest, yet least explored, habitat on the
planet. These include omnidirectional camouflage (Brady et al.,
2015), whole-body endothermy (Wegner et al., 2015) and extended
rostrums (bills and swords) (Domenici et al., 2014). The swordfish
(Xiphias gladius Linnaeus 1758; Xiphiidae) is probably the fastest
swimmer on Earth. This species is intensively exploited but its
behaviour remains virtually unknown because of the logistical
difficulties associated with studying it in the pelagic realm. They are
voracious but toothless predators feeding primarily on agile, fast-
swimming pelagic squid (Hernandez-Garcia, 1995; Markaida and
Hochberg, 2005). Swimming speeds of swordfish are estimated to
reach values of well over 100 km h−1 (Barsukov, 1960). The
swordfish is built for speed: the streamlined body (not including the
sword) has a close to optimal thickness-to-length ratio of
approximately 0.24, which offers the smallest pressure drag for
the largest volume (Hertel, 1966). In addition, the caudal peduncle
is dorsoventrally flattened with deep notches on the dorsal and
ventral side, and is fitted with lateral keels reducing the drag of
lateral movements. The crescent-shaped tail fin has a high aspect
ratio (height squared divided by the surface area) of 4.3, a hallmark
of an extremely fast swimmer (Videler, 1996; www.fao.org/fishery/
species/2503/en).
In adults, the sword can reach 40–45% of the body length. Its
surface structure is rough and porous. The roughness has been
interpreted as a micro turbulence generator suppressing flow
separation and reducing drag (Videler, 1995). A recent study
using computed tomography scans and biomechanical analysis
confirmed the suitability of the sword as a tool to slash prey, but also
revealed a weak, poorly mineralised area near the base of the
rostrum just in front of the eyes (Habegger et al., 2015). The results
of this study made us aware of the significance of anatomical
features in the same area we found between 1996 and 2007. We
reanalysed these to study that weak area and to detect possible drag-
reducing adaptations of the swordfish head. We found an oil-
producing gland in this poorly mineralised area, and discovered that
it connects to a system of capillary vessels that transport the oil to
tiny pores, surrounded by denticles, in the skin of the swordfish
head. We discuss these anatomical structures in the context of drag
reduction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
For our studies, we used two adult swordfish (approximately 1.6 m
total length) that were acquired from commercial fishers and caught
in the Mediterranean off the Corsican coast near Calvi in 1996. The
fish were kept on ice on board the fishing vessel and were deep
frozen directly after landing. Both specimens were kept frozen until
examination. These specimens and two additional heads obtained
from commercial fishers were used for dissections; one of the
Corsican specimens was used for the magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) studies. The MRI examinations and the dissections were
carried out in 1996 and 1997, when no national or international
legislation regarding such studies on commercially available dead
fish was in force.
The MRI apparatus used was a Siemens Magnetom Vision 1.5T
System (field of view 25.6 mm, acquisition matrix 512×512, pixel
size 0.5 mm; T1 weighted sequence, with a repetition time of
540 ms and an echo time of 12 ms, and a number of averages of 2).
The MRI studies comprised 657 pictures of sagittal and
transverse sections of the entire body from the tip of the sword to
the end of the tail. For our analysis, we used 25 sagittal sections
(slice thickness 4 mm) of a 174-mm-long section of the head,
starting at a position 48 cm from the tip of the sword. We also used
23 cross-sections (slice thickness 3 mm), covering the most anterior
66 mm of the 174 mm section (Figs S1–S3).
Standard dissection techniques and stereo microscopes were used
to verify the attributes of anatomical details seen in the MRI
pictures.
Skin surface topography was studied using stereo microscopes
with magnifications of up to 50×, a transmission microscope with
500× magnification and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The
capillary vessel system in the skin was studied by observations of
dissected slices of skin using back illumination. The distribution of

 pores in the skin was determined by counting the number of pores
per cm2 surface area at 10 positions on the left side of the head,
approximately evenly distributed from the base of the rostrum to the
edge of the operculum. Connections between the pores and the
capillaries were established by injecting Indian ink (diluted 1:1 with
water or immersion oil) into the capillaries. Sizes and shapes of the
pores were studied using SEM (JEOL JSM-6301 F, accelerating
voltage 2 kV, lens aperture 30 µm). Skin samples were dehydrated
in a graded ethanol series, air-dried and gold sputter-coated.
The oil properties were analysed using a gas chromatography
flame ionisation detector (GC-FID, Shimadzu GC 17 with FID
detector) and optimised by mass spectrometry (GC-MS, Agilent
GC with MS detector). The HP5 column dimensions were
30 m×25 mm×0.25 µm in each experiment. Samples were taken
from the oil inside the gland and from oil squeezed out of the skin of
the head using a syringe.
To study the oil flow from the gland to the skin pores, the
temperature of the oil gland was increased using a hair dryer. The
warm airflow directed at the position of the gland induced oil
excretion from the pores.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The MRI scans reveal the presence of a large gland in the anterior
part of the upper jaw immediately posterior to the origin of the
rostrum. Its dorsal margin is ventral to the orbit (Fig. 1, Figs S1, S2).
In a swordfish with a total length (TL) of 1.6 m, the total volume of
the gland is approximately 46 cm3, which is approximately 56% of
the volume of the relevant section of the upper jaw. The cross-
sectional area of the gland relative to that of the upper jaw reaches
maximum values approaching 50% in cross-sections 8 and 9
(Fig. S2). The gland consists of three compartments: an anterior
central part that widens into two lateral lobes posteriorly. The
posterior side of the interconnected lateral lobes is dorsoventrally
curved and covers the anterior margins of the orbit. Folded bony
ingrowths from the ventral and lateral regions enlarge the surface
area of the gland and are covered with an epithelium. Near the orbit,
the gland is divided into a right and a left part. Dissection showed
that all compartments were saturated with oil.
A network of capillary vessels in the skin is distributed over a
large part of the head, from the origin of the sword up to the edges of
the opercula (Fig. 2). The outermost sagittal MRI scan (Fig. 2A)
shows one branch of that network in the skin posterior to the eye.
This network is connected to the oil gland and is present in the
concave anterior and lateral parts of the head (Fig. 2B). The
diameter of the vessels varies between 0.05 and 0.1 mm. Wider
main vessels run from the three main parts of the gland towards the
areas dorsal and ventral to the eyes and to the skin covering the
gland. Side vessels branch repeatedly and cross-connections
between different branches occur (Fig. 2C). The vessels narrow
down towards blind ends. Along the vessels, numerous round pores
open to the exterior of the skin, varying in abundance between 4 and
25 pores cm−2 (Fig. 2D). The diameter of the pores varies between
10 cm
5 cm

 0.05 and 0.28 mm. The highest pore densities occur near the edges
of the opercula and in the region covering the oil gland. The pores
are circular and surrounded by denticles (Fig. 3A). Single denticles
that were not associated with pores (∼15 per mm2) (Fig. 3B) were
also observed on the skin.
During dissection of the head, the oil was observed to flow out of
the pores as soon as the oil gland was heated. The oil congealed at
temperatures below 8°C. The chemical composition of oil sampled
inside the gland and oil taken from the skin surface was
identical. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed a mixture of methyl
esters – fattyacidscommonlyfound in plants and animals – consisting
mainly of: palmitic acid (C17H34O2, hexadecanoic acid m.e.;
25 µg mg−1, 97.5 µmol g−1), oleic acid (C19H36O2, 9-octadecenoic
acid m.e.; 24 µg mg−1, 85 µmol g−1), myristic acid (C15H30O2,
tetradecanoic acid m.e.; 5 µg mg−1, 21.9 µmol g−1) and stearic acid
(C19H38O2, octadecanoic acid m.e.; 4 µg mg−1, 14.1 µmol g−1).
The mechanism causing the oil to flow through the network of
capillaries and to exude through the pores in the skin is not obvious
from the anatomy. A possible explanation could be offered by the
results of dynamic pressure measurements over the surface of a
65 cm TL wood model of a swordfish in a flow tank at 6 m s−1 flow
speed (Aleyev, 1977). The dynamic pressure coefficient [defined
as: 2( p–p0)/ρV2, where p is the pressure at the point of investigation,
p0 is the static pressure in the free stream, ρ is the water density and V
is the velocity of the free stream of 6 m s−1] along the dorsal side of
the head drops from a maximum value (+0.13) near the base of the
sword to a minimum (−0.39) at the dorsal fin (Fig. S3). The sub-
ambient dynamic pressure over the front part of the head might suck
oil out of the pores. It would also provide a functional explanation
for the unique shape of the swordfish head.
This newly discovered lubricating organ thus consists of an oil-
producing gland and a network of capillary vessels with pores to the
outside. We propose glandula oleofera and rete lubricans,
respectively, as scientific names for these structures.
Swordfish possess a heat-producing organ that uses a modified
ventral part of the dorsal rectus eye muscle (Carey, 1982).
Thermogenic
cells
inside
the
muscle
enhance
the
local
temperature (Block, 1986; De Metrio et al., 1997), and arterial
blood is in countercurrent heat exchange with blood in the veins
(Fig. 1). Heat transfer to the brain and eyes is mainly conductive (De
Metrio et al., 1997). The eyes are heated and well insulated from the
rest of the head. The rear part of the oil gland closely abuts the eye
and increased temperatures can be expected to reach the oil gland.
This may allow the oil to remain fluid and flow from the gland to the
pores in the skin. The oil solidifies below approximately 8°C,
making it persistent on the skin in cold seawater. In the Western
North Atlantic, tagged swordfish were shown to hunt in deep water
with temperatures down to 8°C during the day and characteristically
occupy surface waters of less than 100 m during the night (Carey
and Robison, 1981; Lerner et al., 2013).
The excreted oil on the skin of the head makes the skin surface
hydrophobic, causing hydrodynamic slip by changing the boundary
layer conditions. Slippery hydrophobic surfaces at the solid–water
interface have a viscous drag-reducing effect in the streamwise
direction in turbulent high-Reynolds-number flow (Choi et al.,
2003; Min and Kim, 2004). Super-hydrophobic layers with rough
microstructures have recently been shown to decrease frictional drag
by more than 20% (Luo et al., 2015). The swordfish head surface
meets the super-hydrophobic requirements: the oil provides a
hydrophobic layer and the skin denticles provide the required
roughness.
Swordfish cannot be kept in captivity, and their extreme
swimming
habits
and
mesopelagic
way
of
life
make
measurements of the function of the lubricated skin in the field
virtually impossible. However, modeling the swordfish features in
fast water tunnels could test our hypothesis and offer new
perspectives for biomimetics studies aimed at drag reduction.

 The swordfish oil-gland system, with its capillary vessels, pores
in the skin and the purported drag reduction, is the latest addition to
the repertoire of unique adaptations that may enable swordfish to
catch fast-swimming, very agile prey, and is an illustration of the
evolutionary arms race in the open ocean between the fastest
swimming predators and the fastest swimming prey.
