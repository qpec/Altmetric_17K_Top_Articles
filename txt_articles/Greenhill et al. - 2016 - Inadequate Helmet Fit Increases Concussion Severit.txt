O
ver the past 2 decades, the rate of concussion in 
American high school football demonstrated an 
alarming upward trend. In 1 study, rates of concussion 
doubled per 1000 high school athlete-exposures between 2005 
and 2012.20 Data from a national high school registry in 2012 
revealed that concussions comprised 13.2% of all reported high 
school sport injuries.16 This statistic increased from 5.5% in 1999 
to 8.9% in 2007.16 Concussions have been referred to as a “silent 
epidemic.”7 While associated problems are often not visible, 
they may lead to profound consequences, including long-term 
mental, physical, or occupational sequelae. Accordingly, 
reported frequencies are likely underestimated because of 
unrecognized or unreported injuries.17 Numerous risk factors for 
concussion have been proposed, including helmet technology,

Background: There is limited information on the relationship between football helmet fit and concussion severity.
Hypothesis: Poor helmet fit may predispose football players to a more severe concussion.
Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study.
Level of Evidence: Level 3.
Methods: Data from concussion injury reports were obtained from the National High School Sports-Related Injury 
Surveillance System over a 9-year period. Symptoms, duration, and helmet parameters (fit, interior padding) were analyzed 
for all first-time concussions.
Results: Data from 4580 concussions were analyzed. Patients who suffered concussions with a helmet that did not fit 
properly (3.22%), as determined by an athletic trainer, had higher rates of drowsiness (RR, 1.46; P = 0.005), hyperexcitability 
(RR, 2.38; P = 0.047), and sensitivity to noise (RR, 1.88; P < 0.001); had more symptoms (5.34 vs 4.54, P = 0.004); and had 
longer symptom duration (P = 0.04). Athletes with helmets lined with an air bladder had greater rates of sensitivity to light 
(RR, 1.13; P = 0.02), sensitivity to noise (RR, 1.25; P = 0.009), and longer symptom duration (P = 0.004) compared with foam 
or gel liners.
Conclusion: An improperly fitted football helmet is a risk factor for a concussion with more symptoms and of longer 
duration. Concussions of longer duration are also more common in players with an air bladder–lined helmet. Current high 
school football rules should mandate supervision and maintenance of helmet fit throughout the season, prior to impact.
Clinical Relevance: Team physicians, athletic trainers, coaches, and high school officials should ensure proper oversight of 
helmet fit in high school athletes to decrease concussion severity and duration.

Since the advent of football in 1869, helmets with various 
engineering standards have evolved in an attempt to protect 
the head. When the rate of brain-related fatalities associated 
with football peaked in the late 1950s, Gadd9 developed a 
severity index (GSI) that determined the likelihood of skull 
fracture during impact. The National Operating Committee on 
Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) utilized the GSI in 
efforts to establish new helmet standards. While the number of 
skull fractures in football has dramatically declined with 
modern helmet design,2 concussions have persisted at 
concerning rates.
The effect of proper helmet fit or type of helmet lining on 
concussion characteristics has not been fully investigated. 
Several recent studies have assessed whether modern helmet 
technology is protective against concussion, but none of them 
specifically investigated helmet fit.6,8,21,24 Therefore, the purpose 
of this study was to assess the potential relationship between 
helmet fit and concussion severity or symptom duration in high 
school football.
Starting with the 2012-2013 high school football season, the 
National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) 
instituted a new rule whereby players with a completely 
dislodged helmet are required to sit out 1 play to adjust their 
helmet for a more proper fit. The goal of this rule was to 
protect at-risk players and encourage the wearing of properly 
fitted helmets. Therefore, this study additionally analyzed 
changes in concussion severity and duration after the NFHS 
instituted this new helmet rule.
Methods
The National High School Sports–Related Injury Surveillance 
system (HS RIO) has had institutional review board approval 
from Nationwide Children’s Hospital since its inception in 2005. 
Data regarding first-time concussions sustained during 
participation in high school football during 9 seasons from 
2005-2006 through 2013-2014 were retrospectively obtained 
from HS RIO, a prospective surveillance study that collected 
computerized reporting information online from a large national 
population of high schools. Briefly, eligible high schools with 1 
or more National Athletic Trainers’ Association (NATA)–affiliated 
certified athletic trainer (AT) with a valid email address were 
sent annual invitations to participate in the HS RIO. High 
schools that responded were categorized into 8 strata based on 
school population (enrollment ≤1000 or >1000) and United 
States census geographic region. Twelve or 13 schools were 
randomly selected from each strata to compose the nationally 
representative 100-school sample. If a school dropped out of 
the study during the academic year, a replacement from the 
same stratum was randomly chosen to maintain the 100-school 
study population. ATs from participating high schools logged 
onto the study Web site weekly during the academic year to 
report injury incidence and athlete exposure information. An 
athlete exposure was defined as 1 high school athlete 
participating in 1 school-sanctioned practice or competition. 
Reportable injuries (1) occurred as a result of participation in an 
organized high school practice or competition, (2) required 
medical attention by an AT or physician, and (3) restricted the 
athlete’s participation in the sport for >1 day or resulted in any 
fracture, concussion, or dental injury even if it did not result in 
restriction of participation. This study is restricted to football 
concussion data. Each concussion report documented 
concussion symptoms and helmet characteristics, including 
whether the AT believed the helmet fit correctly at the time of 
injury and type of inner helmet liner. Assessment of equipment 
fit is a required educational competency for all ATs certified by 
the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education. 
Data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 software. Duration of 
symptoms were categorized into 4 groups: ≤15 minutes, 
between 15 minutes and 24 hours, between 24 hours and 1 
week, and >1 week. Student t tests and analyses of variance 
were utilized to compare means of continuous variables. Chi-
square tests were performed for all categorical analyses.  
P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. In this study, 
a concussion was defined as more severe if it was associated 
with more symptoms.
Results
Data from 4580 concussions sustained over 9 seasons were 
analyzed. Anthropometric data showed: mean age, 15.6 ± 1.25 
years (range, 13-19 years); mean height, 69.3 ± 3.41 inches 
(range, 50-81 inches); and mean weight, 174 ± 37.0 pounds 
(range, 85-372 pounds). Concussion injury reports showed a 
mean 4.43 ± 2.33 symptoms (range, 0-14) (Table 1). Durations 
of symptoms (Table 2) were reported in 4311 reports (94.1%). 
Concussions with more symptoms were associated with 
statistically longer durations to resolution (Figure 1). When 
separated into groups above or below mean values, there was 
no difference in number of symptoms according to age (P = 
0.603) or weight (P = 0.0913). Players taller than 70 inches had 
more severe concussions than shorter players (4.49 ± 2.35 vs 
1.33 ± 2.26 symptoms, P = 0.0369).
Helmet Fit
Data regarding helmet fit were included in 3172 reports. Athletic 
trainers reported that 102 helmets did not fit properly and 3070 
helmets did. Athletes with helmets that did not fit properly had 
greater rates of drowsiness (RR, 1.5; P = 0.0037), 
hyperexcitability (RR, 2.4; P = 0.0329), and sensitivity to noise 
(RR, 1.9; P < 0.001) (Table 1). Athletes with poorly fitted 
helmets also averaged more symptoms (5.34 vs 4.54, P = 0.004). 
Symptom duration was recorded in 3003 (94.7%) reports for 
players with data on helmet fit. Athletes with poorly fitted 
helmets experienced symptoms for longer than 1 week more 
often than athletes with properly fitted helmets (37.0% vs 30.8%, 
P = 0.04).

Helmet Liner
Data regarding helmet liners were included in 3352 reports. 
There were 2690 helmets with an interior air bladder lining and 
662 helmets lined with either a foam (n = 534) or gel (n = 128) 
liner. Athletes who sustained a concussion while wearing 
helmets with an air bladder had significantly greater rates of 
sensitivity to light (RR, 1.1; P = 0.0223) and sensitivity to noise 
(RR, 1.2; P = 0.00870) (Table 1). Athletes with a gel or foam 
helmet liner had significantly greater rates of loss of 
consciousness (RR, 1.6; P = 0.0396) and drowsiness (RR, 1.1;  
P = 0.0285) (Table 1). Liner type was not associated with 
number of symptoms (P = 0.378). Symptom duration was 
recorded in 3164 (94.4%) reports for players with data on 
helmet liner. Air bladders were associated with fewer 
concussions lasting less than 15 minutes (2.17% vs 4.47%) and 
more concussions lasting between 24 hours to 1 week (50.3% vs 
45.5%) (Table 2). However, there was no significant change in 
the remaining 2 duration categories (Table 2). There was no

comparing air bladders versus alternate liners (P = 0.944).
2012 NFHS Helmet Rule
After the 2012 helmet rule was instituted, there was no change 
in the proportion of helmets that fit improperly at the time of 
injury (3.79% vs 2.79%, P = 0.158). However, concussions were 
associated with more symptoms after the rule change (4.65 ± 
2.27) compared with before the rule change (4.29 ± 2.37, P = 
0.04), and the percentage of concussions that lasted longer than 
1 week increased (P < 0.0001, Table 2).
discussion
This study suggests that there is an increased risk of 
concussion severity and duration if the high school football 
player’s helmet fits improperly. Recent studies have implied 
that football helmet fit may have an important role in 
concussion prevention. A minimum of 7% of helmets worn by 
athletes who sustained catastrophic intracranial injuries are 
incorrectly fit or defective.1 A prospective study that utilized 
neurocognitive test results as endpoints concluded that 
modern helmet technology decreases the risk of concussion in 
high school football.5 These modern helmets have additional 
thick padding over the zygoma and mandible regions that 
improves helmet fit. A more recent study collected head 
impact exposure data using helmet-mounted accelerometers in 
1833 college football players and revealed that helmet design 
is a risk factor for concussion. The newer helmet model 
associated with fewer concussions in that study had interior 
padding that was 40% thicker than a standard helmet worn by 
the comparison group.21
One possible explanation for the more severe concussions in 
the group with a poorly fitted helmet is that the cervical 
muscles play an important role in absorbing impact forces as 
the helmet and head function as a single unit.22 If the helmet is 
not secured properly to the head and acts as a separate unit, the 
cervical muscles may not be able to dampen the forces, 
especially rotational forces, which are then transmitted from the 
helmet to the brain. A loose helmet also may delay the cervical 
muscle contraction response to an impact since the direction of 
the force to resist may not be detected until it reaches the head. 
The lack of correlation between biomechanical data on impact 
forces and a clinical concussion threshold may be partially due 
to the fit of the helmet.8
Maintaining a properly fitted helmet throughout the season is 
challenging because of mismatches between helmet size and 
the athlete’s head. Helmet fit can also vary when athletes sweat 
or play in rainy conditions. Additionally, high school athletes 
may dramatically alter their hair styles (eg, shaving their heads) 
or what they wear under a helmet (eg, adding internal layers of 
clothing for warmth) over the course of a season. Last, air 
bladder systems may leak, resulting in insufficient inflation.
According to rules published by the NFHS, no supervising 
individual is specifically responsible for ensuring proper helmet 
fit prior to athlete participation.4 Prior to each game, coaches 
are required to verify that all athletes are wearing a helmet that 
meets NOCSAE standards and that all helmets have an exterior 
warning label. This warning label mentions avoidable causes 
and risks of head and neck injuries but does not mention 
helmet fit. Football helmet manufacturers make 
recommendations on how to achieve and maintain a proper fit. 
However, data on enforcement of these recommendations are 
lacking. It is often the responsibility of the athlete to recheck

helmet fit, inflate a loose air bladder during the season, or bring 
problems with helmet fit to the attention of team officials.10
This study found no difference in the proportion of properly 
fitting helmets at the time of injury before or after the 2012 
NFHS rule change. That rule mandated that any player with a 
helmet completely dislodged must leave the game for 1 play 
and adjust their helmet. Unfortunately, concussions were of 
greater severity after the 2012 rule change, and the frequency 
with which symptoms lasted more than 1 week increased. 
Although this study does not establish causality between this 
rule change and reported outcomes, these findings are 
concerning. The NFHS helmet rule does not force athletes to 
adjust their helmets until after they have sustained a potentially 
major impact. Thus, supervisors of high school football teams 
should mandate that coaches, ATs, or equipment managers 
verify adequate helmet fit among all players prior to and 
throughout the football season.
These findings suggest that helmets lined with air-bladders are 
at increased risk for concussions with sensitivity to light, 
sensitivity to noise, and concussions of longer duration. 
However, there was no association between helmet liner type 
and concussion prevalence or severity. In addition, helmets lined 
with gel or foam liners had higher risks of loss of consciousness 
and drowsiness. Loss of consciousness is an infrequent finding 
but is also more concerning than sensitivity to light or noise.12,14 
Different helmet liners may offer varying protection against 
specific symptoms, but the preliminary findings that concussions 
of longer duration are associated with helmets with air bladder 
liners requires further biomechanical and clinical research.
There are several important limitations regarding the 
interpretation of our data. First, the number of symptoms was 
used as a measure of concussion severity. Although several 
methods have been utilized to measure concussion severity, 
there is no single accepted method.11,12,14 The number of initial 
symptoms and concussion duration may be related, but not 
always congruent. A greater number of symptoms within the 
first week after a concussion may be a risk factor for more 
severe postconcussion symptoms.19 Additionally, individuals 
with a high early symptom load may be at risk for developing 
persistent complaints.15 However, we reported symptom 
duration separate from total number of symptoms because 
certain studies have refuted the belief that a greater number of 
concussion symptoms at initial presentation is associated with 
overall increased symptom duration.3,11
Second, a relatively small proportion (5.3%) of all concussion 
reports with data on helmet fit did not contain answers 
regarding symptom duration. Given the large remaining sample 
size, it is unlikely that this deficit affected the results. Third, ATs 
reported that helmets did fit in the majority of athletes. 
Nonetheless, sample sizes among the group of athletes with 
poorly fitting helmets were still large enough to draw 
conclusions with statistical power.
Most important, this study lacked a uniform method with 
which to measure helmet fit, and there is no comparison group. 
The retrospective nature of this study exposes this analysis to 
inherent confounders. With regard to helmet technology and 
data collection, several studies involving football helmets are 
subject to equipment bias and underreporting.18 However, 
because this study identified a relationship between an AT’s 
assessment of helmet fit with concussion severity, this suggests 
an easily modifiable risk factor that can be addressed on the 
field. In reality, simply ensuring time for repeat helmet fit 
assessments throughout the season is a reasonable method in 
which helmet fit can be enhanced and implemented. This study 
also analyzed helmet fit as an isolated risk factor for concussion, 
although there are many other risk factors and causes for severe 
concussion, including style of play, playing position, time to 
recovery, prior concussion, and genetic factors. Despite these 
limitations, this study identifies an important new potential 
intervention that may reduce concussion severity and possibly 
even concussion incidence.
conclusion
This study suggests that concussions in high school football 
players wearing an improperly fitted helmet may be of greater 
severity and longer duration than concussions in athletes with a 
properly fitted helmet. The 2012 NFHS helmet rules encourage 
properly fitting helmets but may not adequately address this 
problem. These data also suggest that helmets lined with air 
bladders are associated with concussions of longer duration, 
which may be related to air leakage. Team physicians, athletic 
directors, coaches, athletes, and ATs should be aware of the 
potentially deleterious effect of an improperly fitted helmet. 
Governing bodies as well as high schools should ensure proper 
adult oversight of football helmet fit throughout each season.
