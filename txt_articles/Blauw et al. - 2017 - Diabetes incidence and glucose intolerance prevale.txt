ABSTRACT
Objective: Rising global temperatures might
contribute to the current worldwide diabetes epidemic,
as higher ambient temperature can negatively impact
glucose metabolism via a reduction in brown adipose
tissue activity. Therefore, we examined the association
between outdoor temperature and diabetes incidence in
the USA as well as the prevalence of glucose
intolerance worldwide.
Research design and methods: Using meta-
regression, we determined the association between
mean annual temperature and diabetes incidence
during 1996–2009 for each US state separately.
Subsequently, results were pooled in a meta-analysis.
On a global scale, we performed a meta-regression
analysis to assess the association between mean
annual temperature and the prevalence of glucose
intolerance.
Results: We demonstrated that, on average, per 1°C
increase in temperature, age-adjusted diabetes
incidence increased with 0.314 (95% CI 0.194 to
0.434) per 1000. Similarly, the worldwide prevalence
of glucose intolerance increased by 0.170% (95% CI
0.107% to 0.234%) per 1°C rise in temperature. These
associations persisted after adjustment for obesity.
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the diabetes
incidence rate in the USA and prevalence of glucose
intolerance worldwide increase with higher outdoor
temperature.
INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increas-
ing rapidly worldwide. In 2015, 415 million
adults globally were suffering from diabetes,
and expectations are that the prevalence will
rise by almost 55%, up to 642 million cases
by 2040.1 In high-income countries, 91% of
adults affected by diabetes have type 2 dia-
betes.1 The type 2 diabetes epidemic accom-
panies the increasing prevalence of obesity.2
With increasing body mass index (BMI),
glucose and lipids are initially stored in
expanding
(subcutaneous)
adipose
tissue
compartments. However, according to the
lipid overflow hypothesis, when the storage
capacity of adipose tissue is exceeded, lipids
can accumulate in organs (steatosis) includ-
ing the pancreas, liver, heart and skeletal
muscle, resulting in insulin resistance of
Significance of this study
What is already known about this subject?
▪ The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing
rapidly worldwide. Interestingly, it was recently
shown that acclimatization of patients with type 2
diabetes to moderate cold for only 10 days already
improves insulin sensitivity. Physiologically, cold
exposure activates brown adipose tissue (BAT) that
has been identified to combust large amounts of
lipids to generate heat. Previously, it has been
shown that BAT activity is negatively associated with
outdoor temperature. It is thus conceivable that an
increased flux of fatty acids toward BAT may result
in a compensatory increased flux of glucose to
other
metabolically
active
tissues,
explaining
improved insulin sensitivity at lower temperature.
What are the new findings?
▪ On the basis of the putative role of BAT in the
control of insulin action and the effect of
ambient
temperature
on
BAT
activity,
we
hypothesized that the global increase in tempera-
ture contributes to the current type 2 diabetes
epidemic. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to
assess the association of outdoor temperature
with
diabetes
incidence
and
prevalence
of
glucose intolerance, on a countrywide as well as
a global scale. Here we show that the diabetes
incidence rate in the USA and the prevalence of
glucose
intolerance worldwide
increase with
higher outdoor temperature.
How might these results change the focus of
research or clinical practice?
▪ On the basis of our results, a 1°C rise in environ-
mental
temperature
would
account
for
over
100 000 new diabetes cases per year in the USA
alone, given a population of nearly 322 million
people in 2015. This emphasizes the importance
of future research into the effects of environmen-
tal temperature on glucose metabolism and the
onset of diabetes, especially in view of the global
rise in temperatures with a new record set for the
warmest winter in the USA last year.

 those organs.3 The variability in the degree of steatosis
and the heterogeneity of body fat distribution over sub-
cutaneous and visceral fat depots probably explains the
only modest association between measures of overall body
fat and insulin resistance.3–5 For example, South Asians
are prone to develop type 2 diabetes at a relatively low
BMI, presumably because of the limited lipid storage cap-
acity of their adipose tissue depots.6 Interestingly, a very
low-calorie diet can rapidly diminish steatosis and insulin
resistance independent of weight loss7 indicating dissoci-
ation between insulin resistance and obesity perse.
Recently, brown adipose tissue (BAT) has emerged as
an organ that is capable of combusting large amounts of
lipids to generate heat.8 Physiologically, BAT is activated
by cold exposure.9 10 Indeed, prolonged cold acclima-
tization recruits BAT activity10 and is able to induce
modest weight loss.11 A recent landmark paper showed
that acclimatization of patients with type 2 diabetes to
moderate cold for only 10 days already improved insulin
sensitivity as determined by a markedly higher glucose
infusion
rate
during
a
hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic
clamp, while body weight was unaltered.12 It is conceiv-
able that an increased flux of fatty acids toward BAT will
result in a compensatory increased flux of glucose to
other metabolically active tissues, thereby improving sys-
temic insulin sensitivity.13
It has previously been shown that BAT activity is nega-
tively associated with outdoor temperature and is highest
in winter.14–16 Considering the putative role of BAT in
the control of insulin action, combined with the effect
of ambient temperature on BAT activity, we hypothesized
that the global increase in temperature contributes to
the current type 2 diabetes epidemic. Recently, a positive
association was found between outdoor temperature and
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c),17 indicating that systemic
glucose homeostasis is influenced by environmental tem-
perature. However, the importance of this association,
especially in relation to the increasing diabetes burden,
has
never
been
studied
on
the
population
level.
Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to assess the
association between outdoor temperature and glucose
metabolism on a countrywide as well as a global scale.
We specifically hypothesized that diabetes incidence and
prevalence of glucose intolerance increase with rising
outdoor temperatures.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Diabetes incidence rate in the USA
Data on diabetes incidence in 50 states of the USA and
3 territories (ie, Guam, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands)
were available for the years 1996–2013. Via the National
Diabetes Surveillance System of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), age-adjusted diabetes
incidence rates per 1000, along with the corresponding
95% CI, were available for all states and territories per
year.18 The diabetes incidence rate was self-reported via
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
and defined as the rate of adults (18–76 years) who
reported to be told by a health professional in the last
year they had diabetes (type 1 or 2). Data were
age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population using
age strata of 18–44, 45–64 and 65–76.7 Detailed informa-
tion on survey methods can be found elsewhere.19 We
restricted our analysis to the 1996–2009 period as major
changes in the survey methods were implemented
between 2010 and 2011. Data on the mean annual tem-
perature per state were collected through the National
Centers for Environmental Information.20 Obesity preva-
lence (ie, BMI≥30) per state or territory per year,
expressed as a percentage with a corresponding 95% CI,
was also obtained via the BRFSS of the CDC.19 21
Prevalence of raised fasting blood glucose worldwide
Data on country-wise prevalence rates of raised fasting
blood glucose and obesity (ie, BMI≥30) were available
and
obtained
through
the
WHO’s
Global
Health
Observatory online data repository system, which pro-
vides various health-related statistics for its member
states.22 In this database, the prevalence of raised fasting
blood glucose is defined as the percentage of the popu-
lation with fasting blood glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L or on
medication for raised blood glucose.23 We used the most
recent age-adjusted and sex-adjusted estimates available
which were based on data from 2014. Country-wise
mean annual temperature data for 2014 were obtained
via the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia,
using the 3.23 release of its data set.24 25
Statistical analyses
First, for each state or territory of the USA separately,
we performed a weighted meta-regression analysis to
estimate the association between mean annual tempera-
tures (°C) and age-adjusted diabetes incidence rates,
both measured yearly during the period 1996–2009.
Age-adjusted diabetes incidence rate was included as the
dependent variable and mean annual temperature was
included as the independent variable. Moreover, in
order to adjust for the underlying secular trends in tem-
perature and diabetes incidence, all meta-regression
models were adjusted for the effect of time passage by
including the variable year as an additional independent
variable in the models. For Guam, Illinois and the
Virgin Islands, there were insufficient data to perform a
meta-regression
analysis,
and
therefore
these
were
excluded from further analyses.
Second, a meta-analysis was performed to integrate the
results of the meta-regression analyses into an overall
effect estimate, representing the mean strength of the
association
between
mean
annual
temperature
and
diabetes incidence rate in the USA during the period
1996–2009. For the worldwide data, we performed a
meta-regression
analysis
with
age-adjusted
and
sex-
adjusted country-wise prevalence of raised fasting blood
glucose as the dependent variable and mean annual tem-
perature as well as the World Bank income group (ie, low,

 lower middle, upper middle and high income)22 as the
independent variables. For meta-regression analysis and
meta-analysis, the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects
model
was
used.26
27
Weights
were
calculated
as
1= s2
i þ t2 with s2
i being the SE of the age-adjusted inci-
dence rate in year i and t2 the estimated between-study
variance.28 SEs of the age-adjusted incidence rates were
unknown and therefore estimated as 0:5(UL � LL)=1:96
with UL the upper limit and LL the lower limit of the
95% CI of the age-adjusted incidence rate.
To establish whether the association between mean
annual temperature and diabetes incidence rate was
mediated through effects on body weight, we first calcu-
lated an overall effect estimate for the association
between mean annual temperature and obesity preva-
lence in the USA using a similar approach as described
above. Since this overall effect size significantly differed
from zero, we added obesity prevalence as an independ-
ent variable in the meta-regression models relating
mean annual temperature and diabetes incidence rate.
Subsequently, we again performed a meta-analysis to
integrate the estimates of the obesity prevalence cor-
rected meta-regression analyses into an overall effect esti-
mate
for
the
association
between
mean
annual
temperature and diabetes incidence rate adjusted for
obesity prevalence in the USA during the period 1996–
2009. For the global data, we performed a similar ana-
lysis by considering obesity prevalence as a mediator
variable in the meta-regression models.
We also composed a map of the USA showing the
mean annual temperature over the period 1996–2009
and β coefficients from the obesity-adjusted meta-regres-
sion analyses per state. This map provides insight into
potential geographically determined confounding factors
(eg, sea influences, biomes or altitudes), which could be
apparent from a non-random distribution of β coeffi-
cients overlapping with geographical patterns.
Programming was performed in STATA Statistical
Software V.12.0 (Statacorp, College Station, Texas, USA)
and R V.3.1.0 using the ‘metafor’ package.29 Maps were
computed using MATLAB V.R2015a (The MathWorks,
Natick, Massachusetts, USA).
RESULTS
National level: USA
Table 1 shows data on annual temperature, diabetes inci-
dence rate and obesity prevalence in the period 1996–
2009 for each included US state or territory. During
these 14 years, the age-adjusted diabetes incidence rate
was highest in Puerto Rico, West Virginia and South
Carolina and lowest in Minnesota, Massachusetts and
Colorado. The mean change (Δ) in annual temperature
between two consecutive years ranged from −0.11°C
(Minnesota) to +0.09°C (Hawaii).
Both diabetes incidence rate (figure 1) and obesity
prevalence
(see
online
supplementary
figure
S1)
increased with higher mean annual temperature. The
overall effect estimate for the association between mean
annual temperature and diabetes incidence rate was
0.314 (95% CI 0.194 to 0.434), indicating a 0.314
increase in the diabetes incidence rate per 1000 for
each degree Celsius increase in mean annual tempera-
ture. Similarly, obesity prevalence increased by 0.173%
(95% CI 0.050% to 0.296%) for each degree Celsius
increase in mean annual temperature.
After adjustment for obesity prevalence, the positive
association between mean annual temperature and dia-
betes incidence rate attenuated only slightly (see online
supplementary figure S2). Per degree Celsius increase in
mean annual temperature, the obesity-adjusted diabetes
incidence rate increased by 0.290 (95% CI 0.164 to
0.416) per 1000.
Figure 2 shows a map of the USA, illustrating the rela-
tion between the mean annual temperature per state
over the period 1996–2009 and the magnitude of the
corresponding change in obesity-adjusted diabetes inci-
dence rate. As can be appreciated from this figure, the
diabetes incidence rate increases in most states with
higher mean annual temperature, while there is no
apparent geographical pattern which could explain this
association.
Global level
Prevalence data on raised fasting blood glucose and
obesity were available for 190 countries. The worldwide
aggregated age-adjusted and sex-adjusted prevalences of
raised fasting blood glucose levels and obesity were
9.65% (95% CI 9.11% to 10.13%) and 19.51% (95% CI
17.94% to 21.07%), respectively. There was a positive
association
between
mean
annual
temperature
and
country-wise
age-adjusted,
sex-adjusted
and
income-
adjusted prevalence of raised fasting blood glucose. The
prevalence increased by 0.170% for each degree Celsius
rise in temperature (95% CI 0.107% to 0.234%).
There was also a positive association between mean
annual temperature and country-wise age-adjusted, sex-
adjusted and income-adjusted obesity prevalence. For
each degree Celsius rise in temperature, the obesity
prevalence increased by 0.295% (95% CI 0.137% to
0.454%). Interestingly, the increase in obesity prevalence
for each degree Celsius rise in average temperature was
larger in women (0.503%) as compared with men
(0.111%; mean difference 0.391%, 95% CI 0.160% to
0.622%). After additional adjustment for obesity preva-
lence, the association between mean annual temperature
and country-wise age-adjusted, sex-adjusted and income-
adjusted prevalence of raised fasting glucose slightly
attenuated (0.106% increase for each degree Celsius rise
in temperature, 95% CI 0.057% to 0.155%; figure 3).
Given the extremely high prevalence of raised fasting
glucose in some relatively small countries (figure 3), we
performed a sensitivity analysis excluding all countries
(n=29) with a prevalence of raised fasting blood glucose
higher than 15%. Under this restrictive scenario, the
association
between
mean
annual
temperature

 CONCLUSIONS
The
association
between
outdoor
temperature
and
fasting blood glucose concentration has rarely been
examined in the past, and studies showed discordant
results.30 31 These studies were performed in selected
study populations from specific cities and the conflicting
results indicate that the results are not generalizable to
other places. To the best of our knowledge, this study is
the first to assess the association of outdoor temperature
with diabetes incidence and the prevalence of raised
fasting blood glucose on a national and global level.
Using 14-year longitudinal state-level data from the USA,
we show that the overall diabetes incidence rate is
higher in warmer years. Per 1°C increase in temperature,

 we found an overall increase in age-adjusted diabetes inci-
dence of 0.314 per 1000.
Importantly, we expect confounding in this association
to be minimal, as temperature itself is hardly influenced
by any extraneous factors, apart from the passage of
time and geographical location. Hence, we adjusted the
models for the underlying secular trends in temperature
and diabetes incidence by adjusting for time passage.
Also, by first determining the association for each state
separately before pooling for obtaining the overall effect
estimate, we minimized the effect of potential geograph-
ically determined confounding factors, and in this way
we also precluded all other differences between states
that could influence or bias the association between
temperature and diabetes incidence. Furthermore, the
distribution of the magnitudes and directions of the β
coefficients over the USA (figure 2) appeared to be
random as we could not distinguish a pattern overlap-
ping with geographic (eg, sea influences, biomes or alti-
tudes) or demographic characteristics, indicating that
these factors do not explain the association. Our results
are therefore unlikely to be merely due to interstate
demographic, socioeconomic or other differences.
On the global scale, detailed longitudinal international
data on diabetes incidence rates were unfortunately
unavailable for a large number of countries. Therefore,
we used country-wise estimates of the prevalence of
raised fasting blood glucose instead. In accordance with
the results of the USA, we found that on a global level
the prevalence of glucose intolerance is higher in
warmer countries. This association between temperature
and raised fasting blood glucose cannot be merely due to
international differences in age, sex, income or obesity
prevalence, as our analyses were adjusted for these vari-
ables. Although we cannot exclude residual confounding
by population stratification, the fact that this association
closely parallels our findings in the USA supports the
notion that the ambient temperature affects the occur-
rence of glucose intolerance worldwide.
The associative design of our study does not allow us to
draw conclusions on causality. However, it is tempting to

 speculate that the mechanism underlying our present
findings is related to an interplay between BAT activity
and glucose clearance from the circulation by metabolic-
ally active tissues. Recently, peripheral insulin sensitivity
in patients with type 2 diabetes was shown to increase
markedly after 10 days of mild cold exposure.12 These
patients had an increased glucose uptake by skeletal
muscle, probably explained by an increased overall flux
of fatty acids toward BAT, reducing the fatty acid flux to
other tissues.13 Interestingly, in this short-term cold accli-
mation study, body weight was unaffected,12 indicating
that the effects of temperature on glucose metabolism
can occur independently of body weight. This is further
supported by another study showing that higher BAT
activity after cold exposure was associated with lower
blood glucose and HbA1c levels independent of body
fat.32 In line with these findings, we found that adjust-
ment for obesity prevalence only slightly attenuated the
association of outdoor temperature with both diabetes
incidence in the USA and prevalence of glucose intoler-
ance worldwide. Therefore, our data are consistent with
the hypothesis that a decrease in BATactivity with increas-
ing environmental temperature may deteriorate glucose
metabolism and increase the incidence of diabetes. The
role of BATactivity as an underlying pathway in the associ-
ation between outdoor temperature and diabetes inci-
dence may even be genetic in origin. According to the
cold climate genes hypotheses, DNA areas involved in
thermogenesis may have encountered selection pressure
during evolution in areas with cold climates.33 The bio-
logical effects of the gene products may also decrease sus-
ceptibility to diabetes. Interestingly, DNA areas that
regulate
uncoupling
proteins,
including
uncoupling
protein 1 that drives heat production in BAT, have been
proposed as candidates for these cold climate genes.33
Besides BAT activity, physical activity could be a poten-
tial mediator in the association between temperature and
diabetes incidence, as physical activity varies with environ-
mental temperature.34 Although a decrease in physical
activity with increasing mean annual temperature may
theoretically explain our findings, physical activity has
been shown to be highest between daily temperatures of
15°C and 20°C and decreases with higher but also lower
temperatures.35 36 Therefore, we do not expect that phys-
ical activity completely explains the positive association
between outdoor temperature and diabetes incidence.
Unfortunately, data on physical activity for the USA were
not available for the period 1996–2009, and therefore we
were not able to further elucidate the mediating effects.
This topic evidently requires further investigation.
There are several potential limitations to our study.
First, we used state-level and country-level aggregated
data
on
incidence
and
prevalence
rates.
Although
individual-level data would have yielded more accurate
results, acquiring individual-level data on such a large
scale was not feasible. Moreover, we used statistical tech-
niques, that is, meta-regression and meta-analysis, which
can appropriately account for the uncertainty in the
aggregated effect estimates. Second, available data on
BMI were categorically organized (ie, obesity preva-
lence) and BMI could therefore not be applied as a con-
tinuous variable in the models. Although continuous
data would have been more accurate, the prevalence of
obesity is by definition closely related to the average
BMI and its distribution in the general population,
implying that obesity prevalence can be used as a valid
surrogate measure for average BMI in a given popula-
tion. It should be emphasized that we were not able to
evaluate the linearity of the association between BMI
and diabetes incidence or prevalence in our models, as
continuous data on BMI were not available. Although
adjustment for obesity prevalence only slightly attenu-
ated the association between outdoor temperature and
diabetes, mediation via BMI should be further evaluated
in future studies to assess whether a non-linear associ-
ation between BMI and diabetes might account for our
results. Third, owing to the observational nature of our
analyses, we cannot exclude residual confounding. For
the USA, however, we largely circumvented this issue by
analyzing longitudinal state-level data for each state sep-
arately before pooling the results. Furthermore, adjust-
ment for important intercountry differences, that is, age,
sex, income and obesity, did not materially change the
results on the global level. Importantly, adjusting for
income also takes along other intercountry differences,
as many surrogate measures which are often applied for
adjusting for global inequalities in the degree of social
development are based on the gross national income
(GNI) per capita. In fact, the WHO uses a four-group
classification scheme, based on the Work Bank Atlas
methodology to estimate GNI per capita,37 according to
which each country is categorized as low, lower middle,
upper middle or high income.22
In conclusion, diabetes incidence rate in the USA and
prevalence of glucose intolerance worldwide increase
with higher outdoor temperature. On the basis of our
results, a 1°C rise in environmental temperature would
account for over 100 000 new diabetes cases per year in
the USA alone, given a population of nearly 322 million
people in 2015.38 These findings emphasize the import-
ance of future research into the effects of environmental
temperature on glucose metabolism and the onset of
diabetes, especially in view of the global rise in tempera-
tures with a new record set for the warmest winter in the
USA last year.39
