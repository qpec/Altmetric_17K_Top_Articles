ore than 7.5 million US high school athletes 
participated in sports during the 2012-2013 school 
year.18 Despite acknowledged advantages to 
participation in sports, injuries are an important concern for 
high school athletes because of immediate and long-term 
physical effects, missed school days, practice and competition 
time, and psychological and financial burdens.14 Using various 
methods, research has attempted to evaluate the role that 
fatigue plays in sports injuries. One common method to assess 
this possible link between fatigue and injury has been the 
intentional creation of fatigue through exercise followed by 
observation of joint biomechanics on completing plyometric

Background: Laboratory-based experiments demonstrate that fatigue may contribute to lower extremity injury (LEI). 
Few studies have examined the timing of LEIs during competition and practice, specifically in high school athletes across 
multiple sports, to consider the possible relationship between fatigue and LEIs during sport events.
Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to describe the timing of LEIs in high school athletes within games and 
practices across multiple sports, with a hypothesis that more and severe injuries occur later in games and practices.
Study Design: Descriptive epidemiologic study.
Level of Evidence: Level 4.
Methods: Using the National High School RIO (Reporting Information Online) sport injury surveillance system, LEI severity 
and time of occurrence data during practice and competition were extracted for 9 high school sports.
Results: During the school years 2005-2006 through 2013-2014, 16,967,702 athlete exposures and 19,676 total LEIs 
were examined. In all sports surveyed, there was a higher LEI rate, relative risk for LEI, and LEI requiring surgery during 
competition than practice. During practice, the majority of LEIs occurred over an hour into practice in all sports. In quarter-
based competition, more LEIs occurred in the second (31% to 32%) and third quarters (30% to 35%) than in the first (11% to 
15%) and fourth quarters (22% to 26%). In games with halves, the majority (53% to 66%) of LEIs occurred in the second half. 
The greater severity LEIs tended to occur earlier in games.
Conclusion: Fatigue may play a role in the predominance of injuries in the second half of games, though various factors 
may be involved. Greater severity of injuries earlier in games may be because of higher energy injuries when athletes are 
not fatigued.
Clinical Relevance: These findings can help prepare sports medicine personnel and guide further related research to 
prevent LEIs.

movements such as landing from drop jumps. Throughout these 
studies, the changes in joint biomechanics with fatigue have 
been used to estimate risk of injury.10,13,16,17,25,27 Utilizing these 
suboptimal research methods, most of these studies indicate that 
fatigue increases injury risk.16,25,26 Studies have assessed the risk 
of injury in relation to time of play during competition and 
practice in a single sport.22,30
The purpose of this study was to describe the timing of lower 
extremity injuries (LEIs) in high school athletes across multiple 
sports. The hypotheses were that (1) injuries would be more 
common later in practice and competition when athletes were 
likely more fatigued and (2) injuries sustained later in practice 
or competition would be more severe than injuries sustained 
earlier in practice or competition.
Methods
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at 
Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, and at the 
Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board, Aurora, Colorado.
Data Collection
Data were collected using the National High School Sports-
Related Injury Surveillance System, High School RIO (Reporting 
Information Online), an internet-based sports injury surveillance 
system described previously.2,19 In brief, high schools with 1 or 
more National Athletic Trainers’ Association–affiliated certified 
athletic trainer (AT) with valid email address were invited to 
participate. Interested high schools were categorized into 8 strata 
based on school population (enrollment ≤1000 or >1000) and US 
Census geographic region.28 For the 9 sports originally included 
in the High School RIO study (football, boys’ and girls’ soccer, 
girls’ volleyball, boys’ and girls’ basketball, wrestling, baseball, 
and softball), 100 high schools were randomly selected to 
participate (12 or 13 from each of the 8 strata). If a school 
dropped out of the study, a replacement from the same stratum 
was randomly selected to maintain the 100-school study 
population. For the additional 11 sports added to the High School 
RIO study since 2008 (girls’ field hockey, girls’ gymnastics, boys’ 
ice hockey, boys’ and girls’ lacrosse, boys’ and girls’ track and 
field, boys’ and girls’ swimming and diving, boys’ volleyball, and 
cheerleading), not enough schools from each of the 8 strata 
offered all sports. Thus, exposure and injury data for these sports 
were collected from a convenience sample of US high schools 
with ATs. If an AT from a convenience sample school also 
reported information for athletes in 1 of original 9 sports, these 
data were included in the overall convenience sample dataset but 
were not included in weighted national estimates.
Study Definitions
High School RIO defined athlete exposure (AE) as 1 athlete 
participating in 1 practice or competition. A reportable injury 
(1) occurred from participation in organized practice, 
competition, or performance (cheerleading only); (2) required 
medical attention by an AT or physician; and (3) resulted in 
restriction of the athlete’s participation for 1 or more days. ATs 
reported weekly AEs by sport throughout the academic year. In 
this study, injuries that resulted in >3 weeks of time loss before 
return to play or resulted in medical disqualification were 
considered severe. Throughout the study, reporters could view 
previously submitted information and update reports as needed.
This study evaluated only LEIs and only included 9 sports: 
boys’ and girls’ basketball, boys’ and girls’ lacrosse, boys’ and 
girls’ soccer, football, boys’ ice hockey, and girls’ field hockey. 
These sports were selected based on movement patterns, field 
of play, and division of playing time into discrete periods.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and 
injury rates were calculated as the number of injuries per 10,000 
AEs. Injury rate ratios (RRs) were calculated with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). CIs not including 1.00 were 
considered statistically significant. The following is an example 
of the RR calculation:
RR =
No. of LEIs sustained by girls/
No. of total AEs for girls
No. of LEIs sustained by boys/
No. of total AEs for boys
Results
Injury Rates
From 2005-2006 through 2013-2014, there were 19,676 total LEIs 
sustained during 16,967,702 AEs in the sports included in the study, 
resulting in a rate of 11.6 LEIs per 10,000 AEs. Of these LEIs, 1843 
resulted in surgical repair. The overall LEI rate was highest in 
football (15.2 per 10,000 AEs), followed by girls’ soccer (13.9) and 
girls’ basketball (10.3), and lowest in boys’ ice hockey (4.8) (Table 
1). While football also had the highest rate of competition-related 
LEIs (47.6 per 10,000 competition AEs), followed by girls’ soccer 
(28.8), and girls’ basketball (18.2), girls’ field hockey had the lowest 
rate (8.9). In each sport, the rate of LEI was significantly higher in 
competition compared with practice.
The rate of LEIs resulting in surgery followed the same 
pattern, with the highest overall rate in football (1.5) followed 
by girls’ soccer (1.4) and girls’ basketball (1.2), and the highest 
competition rate in football (5.8), followed by girls’ soccer (3.7) 
and girls’ basketball (2.6) (Table 1). Again, in each sport the rate 
of LEIs resulting in surgery was significantly higher in 
competition compared with practice.
In sex-comparable sports, LEI rates were significantly higher 
among girls compared with boys in basketball (RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 
1.2-1.3) and soccer (RR, 1.5; 95% CI,1.4-1.6). There was no 
difference between LEI rates in girls’ and boys’ lacrosse (RR, 1.0; 
95% CI, 0.9-1.1), although this is not generally considered a 
sex-comparable sport given the vast differences in rules and 
protective equipment.

Body Part, Type, and Specific 
Diagnoses of Injuries
The ankle, knee, and thigh/upper leg were the top 3 most 
frequently injured body sites for most sports (Table 2). For all 
sports, sprains/strains and contusions were the most frequent 
diagnoses of injury. Ankle sprains/strains were the most common 
specific injury for all sports except boys’ ice hockey (knee sprain/
strain) and girls’ field hockey (thigh/upper leg sprain/strain).

Timing of Injuries During Practice 
and Competition
The majority of injuries in practice occurred >1 hour into 
practice for all sports (Table 3). During competition for sports 
divided into halves (boys’ and girls’ soccer, girls’ lacrosse and 
girls’ field hockey), more than half (53% to 66%) of all injuries 
occurred in the second half. In sports played in quarters, more 
injuries occurred in the second (31% to 32%) and third quarters 
(30% to 35%) than in the first (11% to 15%) and fourth quarters 
(22% to 26%). In these quarter-based sports, when the injuries 
in quarters were combined into halves, 42% to 47% of LEIs 
occurred in the first half and 53% to 58% occurred during the 
second half of competitions. In boy’s ice hockey, the only sport 
with games divided into 3 periods, 44% of injuries occurred in 
the second period and 28% of the injuries occurred in both the 
first and third periods.
Severity of Injuries by Time in 
Competition and Practice
The severity of injury based on time to return to play tended to 
be lower later in games (Table 4). A greater percentage of 
injuries occurring in the earliest portion of games (ie, the first 
quarter, half, or period) resulted in >3 weeks of time loss before 
return to play or resulted in medical disqualification. However, 
this association was statistically significant only in boys’ soccer 
(odds ratio [OR], 1.6; 95% CI, 1.03-2.38) and football (OR, 1.6; 
95% CI, 1.27-2.09). There were no identifiable patterns between 
the severity of injuries and the time during practice that they 
occurred. A greater percentage of injuries occurring later in 
games resulted in <1 week of time out of play in all sports 
except girls’ lacrosse.
discussion
In recent years, neuromuscular fatigue has been discussed as a 
contributing factor to LEIs in competitive athletes, specifically the 
anterior cruciate ligament of the knee.11,15,26 Various studies have 
examined the relationship between injury rates and fatigue in 
both competition and practice,1,3,6,8,9,20,21,23,30 concluding that the 
lower leg is the most frequent site of overuse injury.6,8,9,12,21,23
Overall, the highest LEI rates were in football, followed by 
girls’ soccer, girls’ basketball, and boys’ basketball. This is 
consistent with High School RIO reports comparing overall 
injury rates across sports, which annually identify the highest 
injury rates in football with a rate of 3.87 injuries per 1000 AEs.4 
Also consistent with past studies reporting overall injury

patterns, LEI rates in the current study were significantly higher 
in competition compared with practice.3,6,8,9,20,29 Previous studies 
found that 52% of injuries among British football academy 
athletes occurred during practice,3 and nearly twice as many 
injuries occurred in competition versus practice among British 
youth football players.9 Injuries observed by High School RIO 
found a rate of 4.31 injuries per 1000 AEs in competition versus 
1.34 injuries per 1000 AEs for practice.4 Potential explanations 
could include intense play, physical contact with other players, 
unanticipated events, and less player risk aversion during 
competitions. Additionally, practice sessions include noncontact 
or partial-contact activities, limiting AEs to full-contact 
activities.30 Across all sports, a higher proportion of LEIs 
occurred >1 hour into practice. This finding may be due to 
scrimmages and other game-simulation activities most often 
occurring during the second half of practice, while warm-up 
and drills dominate the earlier portion of practices. The low 
proportion of injuries occurring >2 hours into practice may be 
attributable to few practices at the high school level exceeding  
2 hours.
The highest proportion of LEIs occurred in the middle 2 
quarters (girls’ and boys’ basketball, boys’ lacrosse, and 
football), the second period (boys’ ice hockey), and the second 
half (girls’ lacrosse, girls’ field hockey, boys’ and girls’ soccer) of 
games. In quarter-based games, when data were collapsed from 
quarters into halves, it was also found that a greater proportion 
of LEIs happened in the second half of games. In previous 
studies, there was an apparent decrease in lower leg kinematics 
and an increase in injury rates in the second halves of games or 
simulated practices.5,21,24,25 Other studies that included specific 
data on timing within halves of soccer games showed increased 
incidence of injury in the middle third and last portions of each 
half.3,8,9,21 The High School RIO dataset did not allow more 
precise analysis (ie, the dataset does not include minute of 
injury) during halves. The evaluation of quarter-based sports in 
this study did not support this timing of injury pattern. Instead, 
the highest proportion of LEIs occurred in the middle of games 
played in quarters. A previous study on American football found 
a similar pattern of a higher injury incidence in the second and 
third quarters.29
Similar to other studies, the rates of LEIs requiring surgery 
were higher during competition than practice.6,7,9,30 Injuries in 
competition were more severe, requiring surgery more often 
and resulting in greater return to play times. The breakdown of 
severity of injuries incurred within competition was unexpected. 
Despite the low proportion of all LEIs in the first quarter, a 
higher proportion of LEIs requiring surgery occurred in this 
quarter compared with others. LEIs incurred in the first half of 
half-based sports resulted in longer return to play times than 
LEIs sustained at other times in games.
As with all studies, this study has limitations. The High School 
RIO sample is limited to high schools with ATs, which limits 
generalizability. It is possible that athletes did not report some 
injuries to their AT because of self-treatment or unwillingness to 
report, which would result in slight underestimates of these LEI 
rates. Additionally, because AEs were unit- rather than time-
based, neither could participation/exposure rates be reported 
by minute or hour of practice and competition nor could 
occurrence of injury be evaluated by minute in competition. 
Failing to assess the real playing time of each player restricts the 
power to draw firm conclusions regarding the associations 
found between fatigue and LEI rates and severity.
The epidemiologic data obtained from this study should 
advance the understanding of LEIs among high school athletes 
and also provide insight into the timing of these injuries as an 
initial step into population-based evaluations of the role fatigue 
plays. Given the relative frequency of LEIs in athletic 
populations, the goal should be to prevent these injuries when 
possible and reduce the severity of LEIs that cannot be 
prevented.
