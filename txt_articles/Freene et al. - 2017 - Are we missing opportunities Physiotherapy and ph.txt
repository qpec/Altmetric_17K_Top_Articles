Abstract
Background: Physical activity (PA) promotion in healthcare is an important strategy for increasing PA levels.
Physiotherapists are well-positioned to promote PA, however no studies have investigated PA promotion by
physiotherapists Australia-wide.
Methods: An online survey of practicing Australian physiotherapists was conducted to investigate knowledge of
the Australian Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour (PASB) guidelines and factors associated with increased
promotion frequency. Participants were asked to state the PASB guidelines and a 4-component scoring system was
used to measure knowledge. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess factors associated
with frequency of promotion.
Results: 257 Australian physiotherapists completed the survey. Only 10% were able to accurately state the PASB
guidelines and 54% reported promoting PA to 10 or more patients per month. Males were nearly three times more
likely than females to promote PA to 10 or more patients per month (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.25–5.74). Those who lacked
counselling skills and felt PA promotion wouldn’t change their patients’ behaviour were much less likely to
promote PA.
Conclusion: Australian physiotherapists have poor knowledge of the Australian PASB guidelines and infrequently
promote PA. Education and training in PA counselling and behaviour change strategies is indicated to enhance PA
promotion by Australian physiotherapists.

Background
The World Confederation of Physical Therapists states
that physiotherapists are ideally positioned to deliver
physical activity (PA) promotion for both primary and sec-
ondary prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
[1]. They have training and experience in educating clients
and in prescribing PA programs for a range of NCDs, such
as cardiovascular conditions and diabetes [1–5]. Physio-
therapists often work with individuals over a period of
weeks and months, providing them with the opportunity
to follow-up on behaviour change strategies [1]. Despite
this, there is little evidence of PA promotion by physio-
therapists globally [6].
Physiotherapists around the world perceive that PA pro-
motion is part of their role, with 50–99% of physiothera-
pists from Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Ireland and Nigeria
agreeing this is part of their normal clinical work [5, 7–
11]. A high proportion of physiotherapists report they are
confident delivering general PA advice (90–97%) [5, 7, 10].
However, there is some evidence that physiotherapists
may feel less confident promoting PA to individuals with
specific health conditions, such as individuals with respira-
tory and cardiovascular conditions [11]. Lack of consult-
ation time is the most commonly perceived barrier for PA
promotion [5, 9, 10, 12]. In contrast to this, physiothera-
pists worldwide agree that brief education and advice is
the most feasible option for PA promotion [5, 7, 9, 10, 12].
Reported frequency of PA promotion amongst physio-
therapists is fair, with 36–54% of physiotherapists in

 Australia and Nigeria promoting PA beyond therapeutic
exercise to 10 or more patients per month [5, 10].
Additionally, knowledge of the PA guidelines appears to
be poor. Shirley et al. (2010) found that only one third
of
physiotherapists
in
New
South
Wales
(NSW),
Australia were aware of the Australian PA guidelines.
Physiotherapists in Ireland and Belgium were found to
have slightly better knowledge of their countries’ PA
guidelines (51–53%) [7, 8]. Studies have found that PA
promotion by physiotherapists can increase PA levels
and reduce sedentary behaviour in the short (12 weeks)
and long-term (2 years) [13, 14]. Yet, physiotherapists
internationally do not seem to be taking advantage of
opportunities and promoting PA to their patients [6].
One strategy to increase the population’s PA levels is
for health practitioners to incorporate PA promotion
into routine healthcare [15]. To enable integration of PA
promotion into routine physiotherapy care, it is essential
to understand the current state of physiotherapists’ PA
promotion and knowledge across a number of settings,
including private practices, hospitals and community set-
tings. The aim of this study is to describe Australian
physiotherapists’ knowledge of the Australian physical
activity and sedentary behaviour (PASB) guidelines, and
factors that are associated with greater frequency of PA
promotion.
Methods
Study design
A cross-sectional online survey was undertaken between
January and March 2016. Using voluntary sampling,
physiotherapists working in Australia were recruited
through advertisements placed in physiotherapy-specific
electronic publications and communications and via pro-
fessional networks. Participants were included in the study
if they self-reported they were currently practicing within
Australia as a physiotherapist in any setting, including pri-
vate practice, community health, public hospital or private
hospital. To increase response rates, participants who
completed the online questionnaire had an opportunity to
win one of four AUS$100 sports vouchers.
Survey
The online questionnaire was based on a previous ques-
tionnaire that had been used in physiotherapy and General
Practice populations [5, 16]. Minor adaptations were made
to make it applicable to all settings, with the questionnaire
taking approximately 10 min to complete. Participants were
asked about their PA promotion practices, perceived role in
PA promotion, barriers to promotion, feasibility of different
promotion strategies, their knowledge of the PA public
health messages and their personal PA levels. Most items
were scored using a five-point Likert scale. The question-
naire also included general demographic questions, such as
age, gender and details of the participant’s work (average
number of patients seen each week, number of years in
practice, usual number of hours worked each week, work-
place postal code and the type of practice). To facilitate
analysis and reporting, each of the multiple response option
variables were later transformed into a binary variable. For
example, agree (combining the 2 ‘agree’ options) versus
disagree (combining ‘neutral’ with the 2 ‘disagree’ options).
Finally, participants were asked if they were aware of
Australia’s PASB Guidelines for Adults (18–64 years) [17]
and, if so, to describe these. Each description was assessed
for accuracy using a four-component scoring system. The
four components of the guidelines assessed were duration,
intensity, resistance exercise and minimising sedentary be-
haviour. To achieve a complete correct answer participants
must have mentioned all four components according to the
Australian PASB guidelines for Adults (18–64 years), that
is, accumulate 150 to 300 min of moderate intensity phys-
ical activity or 75 to 150 min of vigorous intensity physical
activity or a combination of both each week; muscle
strengthening exercise at least 2 days per week; and minim-
ise time spent in prolonged sitting [17].
Sample size
Sample size was based on the total number of registered
physiotherapists in Australia in March 2015 (n = 27,370)
[18]. Using an online survey sample size calculator, with
a confidence interval of 95% and a 5% margin of error,
the sample size required was 379.
Data analysis
Descriptive analyses were completed. Responses of phys-
iotherapists who more frequently counselled patients to
increase their PA levels (beyond therapeutic exercise)
were compared to those who less frequently counselled
patients to determine factors that are associated with
greater frequency of PA promotion. This was achieved
by dividing the total sample into two groups, ‘counselled
<10 patients per month (less often)’ versus ‘counselled
≥10 patients per month (more often)’ [5, 10]. Associa-
tions between all variables were assessed using Spear-
man’s rho. Logistic regression analysis with manual
backward stepwise elimination was utilized, commencing
with all potential predictor variables to identify the most
parsimonious model for predicting counselling patients
more often compared to counselling patients less often
to have a more PA lifestyle. The criterion of p < 0.05 was
used to determine which variables were retained. The
model was assessed for goodness of fit using the
Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square test and an area under
the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. All
quantitative analyses were conducted using the Statis-
tical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. Sig-
nificance level was set at p < 0.05.

 Results
A total of 257 Australian physiotherapists completed the
survey (Table 1). The majority of participants were fe-
male and one third were less than 35 years of age. Nearly
half of participants worked in private practice and al-
most one quarter worked in public hospitals. Of the 29
participants who reported ‘other’ kinds of practice, most
reported working in a mix of practices, aged care or re-
habilitation settings. Complete data sets were found in
98% of cases.
Only one half of participants reported promoting PA
beyond therapeutic exercise to 10 or more patients per
month (Table 1). Ten percent of those who reported
being aware of the Australian PASB guidelines for
Adults (18–64 years) were able to accurately state all
four components of the guidelines (Fig. 1). The majority
of participants were able to accurately state the duration
and intensity components but only one quarter of partic-
ipants included the resistance or sedentary behaviour
components in their responses.
Participants’ knowledge of the Australian public health
messages varied (Table 2). The majority of participants
agreed that several short walks of 10 min on most days
is better than one round of golf per week for good
health. Approximately half of participants agreed that
generally being more active each day is enough PA to

 improve health. Less than half of participants agreed that
half an hour of walking on most days is all the exercise
needed for good health; and that exercise must make
you puff and pant to be good for health.
The majority of participants agreed that PA promo-
tion is part of the physiotherapist’s role and felt
confident giving both general and specific PA advice to
patients (Table 2). Overall, participants perceived few
barriers to promotion (Table 2). ‘Other’ barriers were
the most frequently reported, followed by lack of time.
The most common ‘other’ barrier was PA promotion
being inappropriate with some patients (e.g. low level
of cognition, bed bound, acute unstable medical condi-
tions), followed by feeling patients were not receptive.
When considering feasibility of PA promotion strat-
egies, brief counselling integrated into regular consulta-
tions was considered the most feasible strategy for
promotion (Table 2).
Male participants were almost 3 times more likely to
promote PA beyond therapeutic exercise to 10 or more
patients per month than females. If participants agreed
that separate one-on-one consultations were a feasible
option for promotion they were 3 times more likely to
promote PA to 10 or more patients per month. Table 3
details the results of the logistic regression modelling for
factors associated with frequency of PA promotion by
Australian physiotherapists. Participants who reported
lack of counselling skills as a barrier to promotion were
83% less likely to promote PA to 10 or more patients per
month. Those who reported feeling it wouldn’t change
the patient’s behaviour were 73% less likely to promote
PA to 10 or more patients per month. Treating a higher
average number of patients per week was also a signifi-
cant predictor of increased promotion frequency but
number of hours worked per week was not retained in
the model. The model demonstrated a good fit to the
data and explained 33.2% of the variability.
Discussion
Australian physiotherapists have poor knowledge of the
Australian PASB guidelines. Yet, the majority of partici-
pants felt confident promoting PA and agreed that PA
promotion is part of their role, with half the participants
promoting PA beyond therapeutic exercise to 10 or
more patients per month. To our knowledge, this study
is the first to find an association between gender and fre-
quency of PA promotion, with male physiotherapists
nearly three times more likely than females to promote
PA to 10 or more patients per month, regardless of the
number of hours worked per week. This finding may
have important practical implications, with nearly 70%
of Australian physiotherapists being female [18]. It is
possible that this finding reflects a genuine disparity be-
tween male and female physiotherapists’ PA promotion
behaviours, or alternatively may reflect a gender discrep-
ancy in the self-reporting of behaviour. A recent survey
of physiotherapists in Nigeria, found that female physio-
therapists were assessing the PA levels of their patients
more frequently than males [9]. This is the only other
study to identify a link between gender and PA promo-
tion by physiotherapists and, as it explored PA assess-
ment rather than promotion, it is difficult to compare
these results with those of our study. Future studies in
this area should specifically explore gender factors to as-
certain whether this relationship between PA promotion
and gender is consistent across different samples.
Few studies have explored physiotherapists’ knowledge
of the current PA guidelines. In 2010, Shirley et al. found
that only one third of physiotherapists in NSW Australia
were aware of the Australian PA guidelines. However, it
was unclear if, and how, this study assessed the accuracy
of participants’ responses when they were asked to de-
scribe the PA guidelines. In Ireland, 51% of physiothera-
pists were able to accurately recall the Irish PA guidelines
[7]. A recent study of Belgian physiotherapists, assessing

 knowledge of the Belgian PA guidelines using a scoring
system similar to that used here, reported that 53% of
Belgian participants correctly mentioned 3 out of 4 com-
ponents of the Belgian PA guidelines, with no report of
the percentage of participants who could accurately state
each individual component [8]. Whilst we found that the
knowledge of the PA guidelines was much lower (10%)
relative to previous studies, others did not require partici-
pants to include the recommendations for resistance exer-
cise and/or sedentary behaviour in their responses. This is
likely due to the sedentary behaviour component of the
guidelines recently being added in Australia [19] and not
yet being included in the Irish or Belgian guidelines [20,
21]. Nonetheless, Australian physiotherapists’ knowledge
of the guidelines appears to be poor overall.
In addition to poor knowledge of the PA guidelines,
participants’ knowledge of Australian public health mes-
sages relating to PA was limited. Only half of the partici-
pants agreed that generally being more active each day is
enough PA to improve health. This may be due to phys-
iotherapists believing that a larger amount of PA is
needed for good health. This may also indicate that
physiotherapists lack knowledge of the significant health
benefits that can occur with small amounts of PA, such
as half an hour of brisk walking on most days of the
week [19]. Furthermore, it is possible that if physiothera-
pists don’t agree with these public health messages they
may not promote them to patients, or they may advise
patients that a larger amount of PA is necessary to
achieve good health, making increasing PA levels seem
less achievable for patients. One third of participants
agreed that exercise that is good for health must make
you puff and pant. This may also indicate a limited
understanding that at least moderate intensity PA is
recommended to achieve health benefits, or it may indi-
cate a poor understanding of the definition of moderate
intensity [17, 22, 23].
Regardless of the reasons why their knowledge was
limited, our findings indicate that Australian physiothera-
pists require further education on all components of the
Australian PASB guidelines, with a particular focus on
resistance activities and sedentary behaviour. A systematic
review of factors influencing health professionals PA
promotion found that decreased PA awareness and know-
ledge results in decreased PA promotion [24]. Thus, PA
awareness and knowledge appears to be essential for PA
promotion, and this lack of PA knowledge is potentially
rectifiable through education [25].
In our study, physiotherapists who lacked counselling
skills, or felt that PA promotion wouldn’t change the pa-
tient’s behaviour and didn’t see one-on-one consultations
as feasible options for PA promotion, were significantly
less likely to promote PA. Previous studies have shown
similar results [5, 24]. To reduce these barriers to PA
promotion, physiotherapists may require further educa-
tion and training in PA counselling and behaviour change
strategies. However, it is important to consider that only
6% of all participants reported lack of counselling skills as
a barrier to promotion. While this is an important area to
address, it is not a common barrier reported by Australian
physiotherapists.
The findings for PA promotion role perception, barriers,
feasibility and confidence are similar to other studies con-
ducted with physiotherapists around the world [5, 7–11].
Australian physiotherapists strongly agreed that PA pro-
motion was part of their role and felt very confident that
they could provide both general and specific PA advice to
patients. This is in contrast to Mohan et al. (2012) that
found Irish senior physiotherapists were less confident
giving specific advice to individuals with respiratory and
cardiovascular conditions. Importantly, here we found
confidence was not significantly associated with frequency
of promotion. Thus, confidence may not translate into PA
promotion practice.
Barriers to PA promotion were few. ‘Other’ barriers,
such as feeling it wouldn’t be appropriate with some pa-
tients, alongside lack of time, were the most frequently
cited. While PA promotion may be inappropriate with
some patients, such as those who are bed-bound or those
with acute medical conditions, PA promotion can be
adapted to be safe and appropriate for those with cogni-
tive disorders and comorbidities [26–31]. Brief counselling
integrated into regular consultations was found to be the
most feasible option for PA promotion, which has also
been found in previous studies [5, 10]. There is evidence
that brief PA advice in primary care settings is effective
[32]. Considering this, incorporating brief PA advice into
routine physiotherapy consultations may be an achievable
and successful PA promotion strategy.
Limitations to this study include a limited sample size
and only offering the survey online, which may have lim-
ited responses from those that did not have access to an
electronic device. Selection bias may have also occurred
due to voluntary sampling, with the survey being pro-
moted more widely in the area where the research team
was located, and physiotherapists more interested in PA
potentially more likely to complete the survey. There is
also the potential for recall and social desirability bias.
Physiotherapists may have over or under-estimated the
number of patients they promoted PA to during the past
month, and they may have inaccurately estimated their
personal level of PA.
Conclusion
Australian physiotherapists perceive PA promotion to be
part of their role and feel confident promoting PA to their
patients. Despite this, PA knowledge amongst Australian
physiotherapists is poor. Training in brief PA counselling

 and behaviour change for practicing physiotherapists is in-
dicated, particularly targeting female physiotherapists. If
physiotherapists increase their PA knowledge, improve
their PA counselling skills and take advantage of oppor-
tunities within routine physiotherapy consultations, they
have the potential to increase PA levels of the Australian
population.
