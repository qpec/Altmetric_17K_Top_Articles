ABSTRACT
Experimental manipulation of the gut microbiome was found to modify emotional and cognitive
behavior, neurotransmitter expression and brain function in rodents, but corresponding human
data remain scarce. The present double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised study aimed at
investigating the effects of 4 weeks’ probiotic administration on behavior, brain function and gut
microbial composition in healthy volunteers. Forty-five healthy participants divided equally into
three groups (probiotic, placebo and no intervention) underwent functional MRI (emotional
decision-making and emotional recognition memory tasks). In addition, stool samples were
collected to investigate the gut microbial composition. Probiotic administration for 4 weeks was
associated with changes in brain activation patterns in response to emotional memory and
emotional decision-making tasks, which were also accompanied by subtle shifts in gut microbiome
profile. Microbiome composition mirrored self-reported behavioral measures and memory
performance. This is the first study reporting a distinct influence of probiotic administration at
behavioral, neural, and microbiome levels at the same time in healthy volunteers. The findings
provide a basis for future investigations into the role of the gut microbiota and potential
therapeutic application of probiotics.

Introduction
The gut microbiota plays an important role not only in
gastrointestinal function but also in the regulation of
mood, anxiety, and pain via communication with the
brain, as evidenced by numerous preclinical studies.1,2
The ‘gut-brain axis‘ had already been studied before
this field of research gained new momentum a decade
ago with the characterization of the gut microbiome.3
Although
the
underlying
molecular
mechanisms
remain elusive, the gut microbiota has been shown to
modulate behavior and brain processes, including pain
perception,2 stress responsiveness,4 prefrontal myelina-
tion,5 and brain biochemistry.1 Experimental manipula-
tion of the gut microbial community composition was
shown to be able to modify the host’s neural function.
For example, chronic ingestion of a probiotic Lactoba-
cillus strain by BALB/c mice altered gamma amino
butyric acid (GABA) expression in brain regions
associated with emotional processing, and this was
accompanied by reduced anxiety and depression-like
behavior.1 The gut microbiota was found to influence
the process of myelination in frontal brain regions, sug-
gesting a role of gut microbiota in higher-order cogni-
tive functions, in addition to emotional processing.5
Most of the evidence for an influence of gut micro-
biota on behavior is based on animal findings, with only
a small number of studies6-8 to support a similar rela-
tionship in humans. However, as the psychological
assessment was based solely on self-reported measures,
firm conclusions regarding the effects of probiotics on
human behavior cannot be drawn from these findings.
Another study showed that probiotic intake for 4–
6 weeks altered neural activity in brain regions that con-
trol central processing of emotion and sensation in
healthy women but no change in gut microbial compo-
sition was detected.6

 Recent neuroscientific research has underlined a
close connection between emotion and cognition.
Emotions determine how an individual perceives the
world, organizes the memories and take pertinent
decisions.9 Furthermore, structural studies show that
the brain areas associated with emotional processing
are closely connected to the brain regions responsible
for memory formation and decision-making.10 Con-
sidering the evidence for an influence of gut micro-
biota on emotional processing and the connection
between emotion, memory and decision-making, we
hypothesized that manipulation of gut microbiota by
probiotic ingestion can influence the brain mecha-
nisms underlying memory processing and decision-
making in an emotional context. Accordingly, we
designed a double-blind study investigating the influ-
ence of a multi-strain oral probiotic supplement on
objective readouts of brain function and self-reported
mood and behavior in healthy volunteers (Fig. 1).
This was done by functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activation in
response
to
decision-making
and
memory-based
tasks, respectively. To evaluate the implications of gut
microbiota in the mechanisms triggered by probiotics,
we compared gut microbiome composition before and
after probiotic administration.
Results
The present study used a double-blind, random-
ized, pre- and post- intervention (4 weeks) assess-
ment design and included three study groups:
Probiotic – PRP group (which took the probiotic
for 4 weeks), Placebo – PLP group (which took
placebo for 4 weeks) and no intervention – NI
group (no intervention) with 15 participants each.
The participants were similar with respect to mean
age and body mass index (Supplementary Table 1,
Supplementary file 1). No gastrointestinal symp-
toms
were
reported
during
the
study
period.
Results (except for microbiome analyses) are pre-
sented as differences between the pre- (baseline)
and post- intervention (after 4 weeks), symbolized
by D. There was no exclusion of fMRI data and all
participants
completed
both
the
fMRI
sessions
(baseline and after 4 weeks). However, stools sam-
ples were collected only from PLP and PRP group
and not from NI group, due to financial con-
straints. As some of the participants did not pro-
vide stool samples at both the time points, stool
sample analysis was performed on 10 participants
from PRP group and 13 from PLP group (Supple-
mentary Table 1, Supplementary file 1).
a) Probiotics improved self-reported behavioural
measures of positive affect and cognitive
reactivity
Probiotic administration influenced the behavioral
scores for depression and anxiety questionnaires,
significantly increasing positive affect and blunting
vulnerability to depression in terms of hopelessness
(HOP) and risk aversion (RAV) (for reference,

in
Supplementary
Table 2, Supplementary file 1). There was a statisti-
cally
significant
difference
for
PANAS
positive
scores between the three groups (DNI, DPLP, and
DPRP) as determined by one-way ANOVA (F D
7.45,
p D 0.002).
Post-hoc
comparisons
using
Tukey HSD test indicated that PANAS scores were
significantly higher after the 4 weeks probiotic
administration as compared to placebo (p D 0.004)
and no intervention (p D 0.004). Furthermore, a
statistically significant difference was also observed
for HOP (F D 6.33, p D 0.004) and RAV (F D
3.57, p D 0.038)) subscales of the LEIDS question-
naire between the groups (DNI, DPLP, and DPRP)
after 4 weeks probiotic intervention as determined
by one-way ANOVA. Tukey post hoc test revealed
that
HOP
and
RAV
scores
were
significantly
decreased after 4 weeks probiotic administration as
compared to placebo (HOP: p D 0.004, RAV: p D
0.04) and no intervention (HOP: p D 0.004, RAV:
p D 0.04). See Fig. 2a, b for details. However, we
did not observe any intervention associated differ-
ences between the groups in ADS scores (F D
0.044, p D 0.95) and SCL-90 scores (F D 0.390,
p D 0.68).
b) Probiotics improved memory performance
and altered brain activation patterns
i) Behavioral performance – fMRI tasks
In the emotional decision-making task, probiotic
intervention
associated
changes
were
observed
between the groups (DNI, DPLP, and DPRP) for
the decision change for unpleasant stimuli (Fig. 2c)
as demonstrated by one-way ANOVA (F D 7.79, p
D 0.001). Tukey post-hoc test revealed that probi-
otic administration was associated with less deci-
sion change for unpleasant stimuli as compared to
placebo (p D 0.002) and no intervention (p D
0.014). In the emotional recognition memory task,
there was a statistically significant difference for
response accuracy for unpleasant stimuli (RAU)

strated that probiotic administration significantly
increased RAU as compared to placebo (p < 0.001)
and no intervention (p < 0.001).
ii) Emotional decision-making task
For
the
emotional
decision-making
task,
we
observed intervention associated significant differ-
ences in the brain activation pattern between the
three groups (DPRP, DPLP, DNI) in response to the
neutral>baseline
contrast
(N>B)
and
unpleas-
ant>baseline contrast (U>B). Between group com-
parisons (DPLP>DNI, DNI>DPLP, DNI>DPRP,
DPRP>DNI, DPLP>DPRP, DPRP>DPLP) revealed
the following:
N>B contrast: The contrast N>B identified the
brain regions which showed enhanced activation in
the DNI group relative to the DPRP group. This con-
trast revealed significant differences in the precu-
neus, the mid cingulum, the middle temporal gyrus,
the inferior parietal lobule, and the paracentral lob-
ule. In addition, there was a significant increase in
brain activity in the left anterior cingulum in the
DPRP group as compared to the DNI group. How-
ever, there were no significant BOLD differences
between the DPLP and DNI group and also DPLP
and DPRP group.
U>B contrast: The contrast U>B identified the
brain regions which showed enhanced activation in
the DPLP group relative to the DPRP group. This
contrast revealed significant differences in the precu-
neus, the mid cingulum, and the parahippocampal
gyrus. However, there were no significant BOLD dif-
ferences between the DPLP and DNI group and also
DPRP and DNI group (Supp. Table 3, Supplemen-
tary file 1; Fig. 3).
iii) Emotional recognition memory task
Between
group
comparisons
(DPLP>DNI,
DNI>
DPLP,
DNI>DPRP,
DPRP>DNI,
DPLP>DPRP,
DPRP>DPLP) revealed fMRI signal change differences
in response to the neutral>baseline contrast (N>B) and
unpleasant>baseline contrast (U>B) for the emotional
recognition memory task:
N>B contrast: The contrast N>B identified the
brain regions which showed enhanced activation in
the DNI group relative to the DPRP group. This
contrast revealed significant differences in the lingual
gyrus, the calcarine gyrus, and the cerebellum (ver-
mis). In addition, there was a significant increase in
BOLD activity in the DPLP group relative to the
DPRP group in the anterior cingulum. However, there
were no significant BOLD differences between the
DPLP and DNI group (Supp. Table 4, Supplementary
file 1, Fig. 4a).
U>B contrast: The contrast U>B identified the
brain regions which showed enhanced activation in
the DNI group relative to the DPRP group. This con-
trast revealed significant differences in the lingual
gyrus, the calcarine gyrus, and the anterior cingulum.
In addition, there was a significant increase in BOLD
activity in the DPLP group relative to the DPRP
group) in the posterior cingulum. However, there
were no significant BOLD differences between the
DPLP and DNI group (Supp. Table 4, Supplementary
file 1, Fig. 4b).

 participant related to probiotic intervention were
correlated significantly with their PANAS positive
scores (r D -0.534, p D 0.04). No significant corre-
lations between behavioral parameters and signal
change in fMRI tasks were observed in the NI and
PLP groups.
d) Probiotics administration was associated with
subtle, but significant changes in gut microbial
community composition
Gut microbial community composition was analyzed
from baseline and 4-week stool samples collected
from the probiotic and placebo groups. Supplemen-
tary details on results, including retrieved p-values
and corresponding methods, are given in Supplemen-
tary file 1.
Compared to the baseline, alpha diversity analyses
did not reveal any differences in stool samples from
PLP and PRP group (after intervention) with respect
to microbial diversity and evenness (Supplementary
Fig. 1, Supplementary file 1). Neither probiotic nor
placebo significantly altered the gut microbial commu-
nity composition at operational taxonomic unit
(OTU) or genus level, with samples grouping mostly
according to subject rather than by study group (Sup-
plementary Fig. 2, Supplementary file 1; Fig. 5a). How-
ever, LEfSe analyses identified two OTUs specifically
associated ( D increased) with the probiotic group,
namely Bacteroides sp. (OTU135) and Alistipes sp.
(HQ763196_1_1438).
Multivariate analyses revealed a trend towards a
difference between the placebo (n D 13) and probiotic
(n D 10) group with regard to microbial community
composition after
4 weeks
of probiotics intake
(Fig. 5b). LEfSe analyses identified 10 specific features
for the probiotic group (Supplementary Table 5, Sup-
plementary file 2). Although probiotic administration
did not lead to a significant overall shift in micro-
biome composition (Fig. 5a), LEfSe analyses identified
specific features for the group before probiotic admin-
istration and afterwards (full details are given in Sup-
plementary Table 5, Supplementary file 2). Based on
functional analyses (estimation based on PICRUSt
and subsequent LEfSe analyses; all pathways included)
the only metabolic pathway found to be associated
with probiotic intake was nicotinate and nicotinamide
metabolism,
which
was
significantly
lower
after
administration of probiotics.

 Significant correlation with microbiome data was
observed for RAN (response accuracy neutral stimuli;
p D 0.042), ADS (general depression scale; p D 0.039),
and HOP (hopelessness; p D 0.019), with highly sig-
nificant correlation for RAU (response accuracy
unpleasant stimuli; p D 0.004; Supplementary Table 7,
Supplementary file 4). The parameters RAU and HOP
were also found significantly different for the probiot-
ics group as compared to no intervention and placebo
groups.
Regression analysis (Pearson correlation index;
TOP 100 taxa) identified mostly certain OTUs affili-
ated with the genus Bacteroides to be significantly cor-
related with RAN and RAU (full details are provided
in Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary file 4), indi-
cating a potential link between specific Bacteroides
species and brain memory and recognition. Functional
capacities of the microbiomes were estimated using
PICRUSt. Significant associations of microbial func-
tions were found for RAU (p D 0.024, RDA), and
near-significant associations for ADS (p D 0.061; Sup-
plementary Table 8, Supplementary file 5). The stron-
gest positive correlation of individual KEGG pathways
with ADS scores was for metabolism of starch and
sucrose (p D 0.000034).
Discussion
In the present study, we sought to answer the follow-
ing questions: (i) Can probiotic-induced changes in
self-reported measures of emotional behavior be
substantiated by measurement of neural correlates in
an emotional context?; (ii) Does probiotic adminis-
tration influence the neural correlates of emotional
decision-making and emotional memory processes?;
(iii) Does it change the overall composition of gut
microbiome?; (iv) Is there any relationship between
gut microbial composition, behavioral scores and
imaging measures?
Emotional behaviour and neural correlates in an
emotional context: The marked beneficial effects
observed in the HOP and RAV subscales of LEIDS in
PRP group suggest an influence of probiotic intake on
cognitive mechanisms associated with vulnerability to
mood disorders. On a similar note, increase in PANAS
positive affect indicates improvement in general well-
being. Our findings are in line with previous studies
showing that manipulation of gut microbiota influen-
ces mood and cognition as assessed by psychological
questionnaires.7,8
Neural correlates of emotional decision-mak-
ing and memory processes: Given that emotion
and
cognition
are
inseparable
and
probiotic
administration can influence activity in brain areas
associated with emotional processing,6 we specifi-
cally analysed the effect of the probiotic on cogni-
tive abilities associated with emotional processing,
namely, decision-making and recognition memory.
Probiotic recipients changed their decision about
the selection of the most unpleasant stimuli less
frequently than the control subjects (placebo and
NI groups) during the ED task, reflecting an

 improvement in emotional attention. In addition
to activations in primary motor and visual areas,
we found that the 4 week’s probiotic administra-
tion was associated with a significant difference in
brain activity in cingulum, precuneus, inferior
parietal lobule, thalamus, and parahippocampal
gyrus. The cingulum receives fibers from the thal-
amus and is structurally connected to the parahip-
pocampal
gyrus,
reflecting
its
influence
on
emotions and memory processes. The cingulum
fibers connect the sites implicated in cognitive
control, including reasoning, decision-making and
problem- solving.11 The anterior cingulum primar-
ily mediates emotional processes while the middle
and posterior divisions specialize in higher order
cognitive processes and memory formations.12 The
role of the precuneus in decision-making processes
is well documented.13 The changes in neural activ-
ity in the cingulum and precuneus in ED task
indicate an influence of the probiotics on deci-
sion-making processes. This influence was stronger
for unpleasant, than for neutral stimuli, possibly
indicating that unpleasant stimuli elicit a stronger
emotional response than do neutral stimuli, lead-
ing to greater impact on decisions. Additionally,
significant difference in cerebellar activity was
observed in ER task in the probiotic group. The
cerebellum not only plays a role in motor func-
tions but also influences thoughts and emotions
and is important for cognitive processes, especially
procedural and episodic memory retrieval.14 In
addition, the probiotic group showed significant
improvement in response accuracy for unpleasant
stimuli. This indicates an improvement of memory
performance, especially in the context of emotions.
The
significant
correlations
between
the
self-
reported behavioral measures and changes in brain
activation in the cingulum and cerebellum provide
further evidence for a probiotic influence on deci-
sion-making and memory processes.
Probiotic-associated
changes
in
gut
micro-
biota composition: Administration of probiotics
did not change the diversity or evenness of the
complex microbial communities associated with
the healthy subjects. However, a number of OTUs
were identified that were indicative for probiotics
administration, including several that were affili-
ated with Bacteroides, which produce succinate,
acetate and propionate15 and thus serve as an
excellent
source
of
short-chain
fatty
acids
(SCFAs).15
Major
local
changes
in
microbiota
composition in specific areas of the gastrointesti-
nal tract might not be reflected in faecal sam-
ples.16
The
probiotics
may
have
changed
the
microbiota via indirect effects, e.g. provision of
important trace nutrients (e.g. vitamin B3) or
induction of beneficial strains (i.e. acetate-produc-
ing microorganisms) already present. As stool data
were not available for NI group, the comparison
of gut microbiota profile between no intervention
and probiotic/placebo intervention still remains a
question for future investigation and is thus, a
limitation for the current study.
Relationship between gut microbial composi-
tion, behavioral scores and imaging measures:
Significant
correlations
between
BOLD
signal
change (cingulum and cerebellum), RA and behav-
ioral measures were observed. Given the roles of
cingulum and cerebellum in decision-making and
emotional processing, respectively, the present find-
ings further support our hypothesis of probiotic-
associated effects on behavior which are reflected
in neuroimaging measures. Overall, the microbial
community composition mirrored behavioral scores
and RA. In particular, RAU, ADS scores, and HOP
scores were found to correlate with microbiome
composition and abundance data. In addition, high
scores in ADS were found to be associated with an
inferred higher abundance of metabolic pathways
involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, consis-
tent with previous reports of a relationship between
sugar consumption and major depression.17
Conclusions
This study provides multidimensional evidence that
administration of a multi-strain probiotic and the
associated change in gut microbiota composition
has a significant interrelated impact on behavioral
scores and functional MRI measures in distinct
brain areas involved in emotional decision-making
and emotional memory processes. The influence of
probiotics on human brain metabolism remains an
important question for future investigations. A
deeper understanding of the underlying mecha-
nisms will help to refine the clinical use of probi-
otic supplements in the future. The results of the
current study are relevant in guiding future clinical

 studies to determine whether probiotic administra-
tion might have potential as an alternative or
adjunctive strategy to treat depression and mood
disorders. However, as this study is performed on
healthy volunteers which possibly react, to the
intervention, in a different way than patients, the
conclusions from this study cannot be generalized
and require future investigations.
Materials and methods
f) Subjects and study design
Forty-five healthy volunteers (20-40yrs) participated in
this double-blind, parallel, randomised control study
(for details regarding age, body mass index, number
of males and females per group, please refer to supple-
mentary Table 1, Supplementary file 1) and were
divided equally into three groups: one active interven-
tion group (Probiotic; PRP) and two control groups:
Placebo (PLP) and no intervention (NI). The number
of male and female participants in each group were
not statistically different (X2
(2) D 0.71, p D 70). Exclu-
sion criteria were MR incompatibility, substance
abuse, use of antibiotics or probiotics, and CNS
trauma/disorders. The study was approved by the
local ethics committee of the University of Graz, Aus-
tria. This study was conducted in accordance with the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and written
informed consent was obtained from all participants
All participants underwent fMRI scanning at base-
line (time point 1) and after 4 weeks (time point 2).
Stool samples were collected for the probiotics and
placebo group at both time points (and stored imme-
diately after collection at -80�C until analysis).
g) Study product and administration
The probiotic formulation used for this study was
Ecologic�825 (manufactured by Winclove Probiotics,
The
Netherlands,
and
available
commercially
as
OmniBiotic� Stress Repair, Institut Allergosan, Aus-
tria) and was supplied in sachets (one for each day),
each containing 3g freeze-dried powder. The probiotic
product
(7.5�109CFU/g)
contained
nine
bacterial
strains, namely, Lactobacillus casei W56, Lactobacillus
acidophilus W22, Lactobacillus paracasei W20, Bifido-
bacterium lactis W51, Lactobacillus salivarius W24,
Lactococcus lactis W19, Bifidobacterium lactis W52,
Lactobacillus
plantarum
W62
and
Bifidobacterium
bifidum W23. The placebo formulation, also supplied
in 3 g sachets, consisted of the carrier used in the pro-
biotic product (maize starch and maltodextrins) and
was matched for color, texture, and odor to the probi-
otic product but contained no bacteria. Both the pla-
cebo
and
probiotic
product
sachets
were
indistinguishable for the study participants and the
research personnel. No information about the study
product was provided to the participants except that
they were being administered a multi strain probiotic
product. All participants were instructed to fill in a
daily diary about their gastrointestinal symptoms and
details about the probiotic/placebo intake. Additionally,
participants were contacted via phone every week to
check the study compliance.
h) Behavioral assessment
All participants were administered a set of four self-
reported questionnaires, namely, PANAS (Positive
and negative affect schedule), SCL-90 (Symptoms
checklist-90),
ADS
(Allgemeine
Depressionsskala),
LEIDS (Leiden index of depression severity) in Ger-
man to assess their mood and state of well-being
before, after, and throughout the course of the study.
These questionnaires were incorporated into a daily
diary provided to the participants at the beginning of
the study (time point 1) for four weeks. For details
please refer to Supplementary file 1.

For this study, two fMRI tasks, emotional decision-
making (ED) and emotional recognition memory (ER)
were performed by all the participants (Fig. 6a, b). These
tasks have been previously validated18,19 and established

 recognition memory assessment. Please refer to Supple-
mentary file 1 for details on task design and data
acquisition.
i) Emotional decision-making (ED) task
The ED task employed a block paradigm design with
eight alternating activation (A) and baseline (B) blocks
(BABABABA….). Five stimuli (7s each) were pre-
sented in each activation block preceded by a cue
word (1s; N for neutral block, U for unpleasant block).
Stimuli were triplets of neutral or unpleasant pictures
(either N or U) and the participants were instructed to
select the most neutral or most unpleasant picture in
the triplet, basing their decision on their personal expe-
riences. 60 neutral and 60 unpleasant pictures were
presented in the activation block. The baseline block
was a matching task in which the stimuli (7s each)
were triplets of geometric pictures and participants
were instructed to select a picture with a fixation cross
on it. Two stimuli were presented for each baseline
block preceded by a cue word (1s; B for baseline
block). The total time for the task was 7min 3s.
ii) Emotional recognition memory (ER) task
One hour after the ED task, an ER task was performed to
assess the recognition memory for the emotional stimuli
presented in the emotional decision-making task. 120
additional pictures (60 neutral and 60 unpleasant) were
selected to serve as foils in the memory task. This task
also employed a block design with 12 alternating active
and baseline blocks. Subjects were instructed to press ‘yes’
or ‘no’ according to whether or not they recalled seeing
the picture during the ED task. 10 stimuli (3s each) were
presented for each activation block preceded by a cue
word (3s; N for neutral block, U for unpleasant block).
During the baseline block, participants were presented
with geometric pictures with or without fixation cross and
were required to press ‘yes’ if they saw a fixation cross
and vice versa A total of 5 stimuli were presented for each
baseline block preceded by a cue word (3s; B for baseline
block). The total time for the task was 10min 30s.
For both the fMRI tasks, the choice of appropriate
baseline was based on the factor that it should require
similar processing in terms of motor response execu-
tion, visual processing, attention, and observation but
without the need for decision-making. Furthermore, as
both the tasks were performed in an emotional context,
it was important that the baseline should not have any
emotional content and thereby we chose the geometric
figures for the baseline task. In addition, to match the
baseline task with active tasks, we introduced the obser-
vation and response task (select the picture with fixa-
tion) however without any decision-making involved.
j) Data analysis
i) Self-reported questionnaires analysis
The statistical package for the social sciences version
23 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois) was used for the analysis
of self-reported questionnaire data. As we were par-
ticularly interested in the intervention related effects
on individual level, we calculated difference scores
(pre- and post- intervention) for each participant for
all the questionnaires and compared the three groups
(DPLP, DNI, and DPRP) using one-way ANOVA in
SPSS. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant.
ii) fMRI analysis
Behavioral performance for the fMRI tasks was evaluated
in all participants using three indices: response accuracy

ory task.

 (RA: RAU for unpleasant stimuli, RAN for neutral stim-
uli), response time (RT) and decision change (see Sup-
plementary file 1 for details). The data (difference scores:
pre- and post- intervention) for these parameters was
also analysed using one way ANOVA in SPSS software.
fMRI data were pre-processed using SPM12. Pre-
processing included slice time correction, fieldmap
distortion correction, coregistration of mean fMRI
and MPRAGE images, spatial normalization using
the DARTEL algorithm and spatial smoothing with
an isotropic Gaussian kernel with full-width half-
maximum of 6mm. A statistical parametric differ-
ence map was generated for each participant between
pre- and post- intervention, for both fMRI tasks
under each condition (neutral, baseline and unpleas-
ant) by fitting the stimulation paradigm to the func-
tional data, convolved with a hemodynamic response
function. Individual first level contrast images (time
point 2 – time point 1, symbolized as D) were gener-
ated for the neutral vs. baseline (N>B) and unpleas-
ant vs. baseline (U>B) contrasts (FWE corrected, p
< 0.05). One-sample t-tests in all groups were per-
formed for within-group analysis. For the between-
group analysis, one-way ANOVA was performed,
followed by 2-sample t-tests for group comparisons
(DPRP vs DPLP, DPRP vs DNI, DNI vs DPLP). The
results were explored at a significance threshold of p
< 0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons. A
Monte-Carlo simulation (http://www.sciencedirect.
com/topics/neuroscience/monte-carlo-method)
of
the brain volume was employed to establish an appro-
priate voxel contiguity threshold.20 This correction
has the advantage of higher sensitivity, while still cor-
recting for multiple comparisons across the whole
brain volume. Assuming an individual voxel type I
error of p < 0.001, a cluster extent of 17 contiguous
resampled voxels was indicated as necessary to correct
for multiple voxel comparisons across the whole brain
at p D 0.05 (based on 10,000 simulations). Further,
BOLD contrast estimates were also extracted from
8mm ROIs defined on the regions showing significant
between-group differences in both fMRI tasks using
the MarsBaR toolbox (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/
). These contrast estimates were used later for the cor-
relation analysis with the behavioral data. All the sta-
tistical analysis was performed using the statistical
package for the social sciences version 23 (SPSS, Chi-
cago, Illinois). A p value<0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant for all the analysis.
iii) Microbiome analyses
Details on DNA extraction, amplicon generation,
sequencing and negative controls are given in Supple-
mentary file 1. Raw sequences were submitted to ENA
(PRJEB21748) and are publicly available. Almost
13 million raw reads were processed via QIIME fol-
lowing standard operating procedures21 (details in
Supplementary file 1). OTU table was processed in
Calypso.22 OTUs with <0.01% relative abundance
across all samples were removed for analyses.
