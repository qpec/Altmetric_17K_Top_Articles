Background What constitutes respectful maternity care (RMC)
operationally in research and programme implementation is often
variable.
Objectives To develop a conceptualisation of RMC.
Search strategy Key databases, including PubMed, CINAHL,
EMBASE, Global Health Library, grey literature, and reference lists
of relevant studies.
Selection criteria Primary qualitative studies focusing on care
occurring during labour, childbirth, and/or immediately
postpartum in health facilities, without any restrictions on
locations or publication date.
Data collection and analysis A combined inductive and deductive
approach was used to synthesise the data; the GRADE CERQual
approach was used to assess the level of confidence in review findings.
Main results Sixty-seven studies from 32 countries met our
inclusion criteria. Twelve domains of RMC were synthesised: being
free from harm and mistreatment; maintaining privacy and
confidentiality; preserving women’s dignity; prospective provision
of information and seeking of informed consent; ensuring
continuous access to family and community support; enhancing
quality of physical environment and resources; providing equitable
maternity care; engaging with effective communication; respecting
women’s choices that strengthen their capabilities to give birth;
availability of competent and motivated human resources; provision
of efficient and effective care; and continuity of care. Globally,
women’s perspectives of what constitutes RMC are quite consistent.
Conclusions This review presents an evidence-based typology of
RMC in health facilities globally, and demonstrates that the
concept is broader than a reduction of disrespectful care or
mistreatment of women during childbirth. Innovative approaches
should be developed and tested to integrate RMC as a routine
component of quality maternal and newborn care programmes.

Introduction
Every day about 830 women die from pregnancy- or child-
birth-related complications globally. In 2015, the UN
launched the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and
Adolescents’ Health, 2016–2030,1 with an aim to reduce
the global maternal mortality ratio to fewer than 70 per
100 000 births.2

Systematic review
 A central component of global efforts to reduce maternal
mortality is to ensure that all women have access to skilled
care before, during, and after childbirth.3 Access to quality
services is not guaranteed for many women, however, espe-
cially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Even
when services are available, care may be compromised by
mistreatment during childbirth, including abusive, neglect-
ful, or disrespectful care.4,5 Several studies have identified
that even if the provider is skilled in managing complica-
tions, women may refuse to seek care when they have pre-
viously
experienced
disrespectful
care,
and
may
also
discourage others from seeking care.4–7
Promoting respectful maternal care (RMC) is being
increasingly recognised as a critical element of strategies to
improve the utilisation and quality of maternity care,8 and
that all women need and deserve respectful care.9 RMC can
be defined as an approach to care that emphasises the fun-
damental rights of women, newborns, and families, and
that promotes equitable access to evidence-based care while
recognising the unique needs and preferences of both
women and newborns.10 The White Ribbon Alliance has
defined seven domains of RMC using a rights-based
approach;11 however, what constitutes RMC operationally
(in terms of specific behaviours, practices, or standards) in
research and programme implementation is often variable.
To our knowledge, no efforts have yet been made to use an
evidence-based approach to determine what constitutes
RMC during childbirth in health facilities.
The aim of this qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) is to
develop a conceptualisation of RMC from the perspectives
of key stakeholders. The findings will support the evidence
base for the related recommendations in the WHO global
guideline on intrapartum care for a positive childbirth
experience.
Methods
For this QES, we followed the methodology described in
the Cochrane handbook.12 We conducted this review in
accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for System-
atic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and
followed a protocol.
Search strategy
Search strategies for PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE
(Appendices S1, S2 and S3) were developed through the
identification of all relevant terms related to childbirth, qual-
ity of care, respect, and qualitative research. Searches were
conducted on 8 July 2015 and updated on 6 February 2017.
We included primary qualitative studies focusing on child-
birth occurring in health facilities, without any restrictions
on the country’s level of development, geographical loca-
tions, or publication date. We also searched the WHO Global
Health Library, Cochrane Library, Database of Abstracts of
Reviews of Effects (DARE), Google Scholar, Centre for
Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) Database, OpenGrey,
EThOS, and unpublished reports for grey literature. We con-
tacted experts in relevant fields, and reviewed the reference
lists of relevant studies to identify additional studies.
Study selection
Two reviewers (ESh and MN) independently reviewed the
titles of identified articles, and those clearly irrelevant to the
topic were excluded. Abstracts of the remaining articles were
reviewed for inclusion independently by two reviewers per
citation (ESh, MN, JV, MB, and SL) using a screening check-
list designed for this review. The full texts of all potentially
eligible papers were retrieved and reviewed by two reviewers
per citation (ESh, JV, MN, SL, VP, JP, and SM) based on the
use of a pre-tested eligibility checklist, including: whether
the study was published in English, French, Italian, Persian,
Portuguese, Spanish, or Turkish (based on the languages of
the review team); whether it was a primary study; whether it
used a qualitative method of data collection and analysis;
whether it focused on care occurring during labour, child-
birth, and/or immediately postpartum (up to 48 hours after
birth); whether it primarily focused on respectful care of
women; and whether it referred to births occurring at a
health facility. The review included studies that evaluated the
perspectives of key stakeholders within the health system,
including users (women and their families), providers,
administrators, and policymakers. Disagreements between
reviewers during screenings were resolved by discussion with
a third reviewer.
Quality assessment
A critical appraisal form was developed using the adaptation
of the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) quality
assessment tool for qualitative studies (www.casp-uk.net).
Two reviewers conducted the assessment independently
(ESh, MN, VP, SM), with discussion until consensus was
reached in the case of discrepancies. The findings of the criti-
cal appraisal were used for GRADE CERQual (Confidence in
the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research) assess-
ments,13,14 and interpretation of the findings.15
Data extraction
Data were extracted using a standardised form developed
for this review. Study characteristics, themes, authors’
interpretation, and participant quotations were extracted
from the included studies.
Data synthesis
We used a combined inductive and deductive approach to
analysis. Thematic analysis methods were used to conduct
initial open coding on each relevant text unit to elicit key
933

Respectful care during childbirth in health facilities
 themes emerging from the data. We also reviewed and
considered existing resources to inform the organisation of
a preliminary thematic framework,16 which included: the
WHO quality of care framework for pregnant women and
newborns;17
mistreatment
of
women
typology;5
health
system responsiveness domains;18 and the White Ribbon
Alliance’s11 seven rights of childbearing women. The pre-
liminary coding framework was discussed iteratively, and
checked against primary studies. All studies were reviewed
until no new themes emerged, and agreement was reached
on the definition, boundaries, and proper use of each code.
During synthesis, some codes were revised and some sub-
themes were combined. Based on the initial coding, 12
broad themes were developed, and all text units were itera-
tively classified into one of the broad themes. We devel-
oped the axial coding scheme and broke up the core
themes into first-, second-, and third-order themes.5,19,20
To assess how much confidence can be placed in each
qualitative review finding, we used the GRADE CERQual
approach,13,14 applying it to the second-order themes as
‘high’, ‘moderate’, or ‘low’, based on the judgments made
for each of the four components.
This QES is reported according to the Enhancing Trans-
parency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research
(ENTREQ) statement.21
Results
Results of the search
The initial and updated searches yielded 4758 citations. Full
texts were retrieved for 314 potentially eligible studies.
After exclusions, 67 studies were included in the review
(Figure 1). This analysis synthesised findings from primary
research conducted across 32 countries: six countries in
sub-Saharan Africa, seven in Asia, one in Oceania, eight
in Europe, five in the Middle East and North Africa, two
in North America, and three in Latin America (Figure 2).

 typology of RMC during childbirth developed from a syn-
thesis of the qualitative evidence. The summary of findings
and the CERQual assessments are presented in Table S3.
Most studies explored the experiences of women; however,
many studies also included family members, midwives,
obstetricians, paediatricians, nurses, facility managers, phys-
iotherapists, midwifery students, and hospital advisory
committee members as respondents.
Qualitative synthesis
Twelve themes emerged from the qualitative synthesis that
were relevant to providing a typology of RMC during
childbirth in health facilities. Many themes were homoge-
nous across country income levels and type of participants;
we have indicated where any substantive heterogeneity
existed. Key findings across themes are presented below.
Being free from harm and mistreatment
Both women and healthcare providers across countries
referred to not using a loud voice when speaking to
women, and having a warm and measured manner, as
representing respectful care.22,23,25–27
Support
from
midwives
enabled
women
to
feel
safe.25,26,28–41 Women believed that their sense of security
was facilitated by professional treatment,42 and by the
availability of equipment and technologies.32 Health profes-
sionals believed that providing a safe and secure environ-
ment for women was part of humanised care.41
Maintaining privacy and confidentiality
Both women and healthcare providers across the world
reported maintaining privacy and confidentiality as human-
ised care. Women expressed a need for privacy during
physical examinations and procedures,26,43,45,54 by shielding
them
from
visitors
or
other
women,43,55
and
male
staff,24,44,48,51,52,56
and
by
limiting
the
number
of
staff,24,51,55 and attendants,36,48 who are present. Healthcare
providers reported that they care about women’s pri-
vacy.49,50,53
Women in Malawi, Tanzania, and Nepal believed that
maintaining confidentiality and ‘secrets’ about their health
was a component of good-quality care.25,26,57

Respectful care during childbirth in health facilities
 Preserving women’s dignity
Women from diverse settings emphasised the importance
of a positive atmosphere in the labour ward by feeling wel-
comed into the labour environment.22,26,28,35,39,45,48,55,59,60
Women preferred healthcare providers that had kind
attitudes, spent time with women, and were calm, tactful,
warm,
smiling,
and
caring.28–31,39,41,44,58,63–65
Women
described their expectation to be treated as a person and
not as ‘processed things’.36,60,61 To be seen as an individual
– with differences and peculiarities – was expressed by
women
and
healthcare
providers
as
being
met
with
respect.31,41,51,53,56
Respecting the cultures, values, and beliefs of women
was highlighted by women and healthcare workers.34,41,49,51
Women, mostly Muslims, in different countries expressed
their strong preference for having a female birth attendant
during labour or birth.44,48,51,52
Prospective provision of information and seeking informed
consent
Women reported the need to receive information about
the practice of labour, including breathing techniques,
pushing, and relaxation techniques, as well as how to
be
prepared
physically
and
psychologically
to
give
birth.26,29,33,36,37,40,56,58,61
Healthcare
providers
reported
that explaining the interventions that women were about to
undergo was part of RMC.41,67
Women believed that midwives should ask permission
from women prior to undertaking potentially embarrassing
procedures like vaginal examinations.24,44,54,56 Similarly,
several multi-country studies highlighted the importance of
informed consent as a component of RMC.49,53
Ensuring continuous access to family and community
support
Most women and some healthcare providers emphasised
the importance of family attendance and presence of labour
companions of choice,32,33,38,44,48,50,51,56,66,70,72,74 and valued
it as every woman’s right.36,39,40,64,65 Healthcare providers
valued family interaction with the women and active
involvement
in
their
care.36,39,40,64–67,71
In
Japan,
the
healthcare providers and women categorised some rules
and regulations as barriers to humanising birth, such as the
policies restricting labour companions.49
The physical
structure of the space was important for accommodating
companions on the labour ward.59,75
Enhancing the quality of the physical environment and
resources
Both
women
and
healthcare
providers
believed
that
providing comfortable, clean, and calming birth environ-
ments with restricted visiting hours were conducive to pro-
moting
RMC.22,27,36,49,51,53,55,62,64,65,67,68,73,77
Healthcare
providers in India and Brazil believed that to humanise
birth they had to have better physical environments,
including a waiting area, cleanliness, adequate bedding, and
the regular supply of water and electricity, and medi-
cines.55,56,78
Women from several countries expressed the need for
adequate access to medical and non-medical technologies,
which they perceived as mechanisms to help them feel safe
and reassured.26,51,76,79
Providing equitable maternity care
The availability of services for all, regardless of age, ethnic-
ity, sexuality, religion, or other subgroups, was high-
lighted,36,51,53,80
and
treating
all
women
equally
was
considered respectful.81 For example, several Somali-born
immigrant women in Finland were pleased with the doc-
tors’ and nurses’ attitudes and behaviours towards them.76
In contrast, Somali immigrant women in Canada desired
non-judgmental care, but reported experiences of cultural
discrimination.43
Engaging with effective communication
Both women and healthcare providers across the world
emphasised the importance of effective communication as
a key component of RMC. Women appreciated receiving
verbal praise and encouragement during labour, and valued
the emotional support that they received from mid-
wives.24,26,34,35,41,45,51,57,58,61,66,76,82,83,86 Healthcare providers
agreed that talking and listening to the women was a criti-
cal component of humanised care,65,67 and valued provid-
ing empathy to women.39,41,53,56,71,74
Practicing and encouraging effective non-verbal commu-
nication was appreciated by women and midwives.29,31,48,58
Immigrant women living in developed countries high-
lighted the importance of the availability of interpreters
because of language difficulties, and appreciated having
interpreters to translate and explain.53,76,84
Respecting women’s choices that strengthen their capabilities
to give birth
Respecting women’s choices and empowering them was
discussed across multiple settings by women,29,45,55,66,72 and
by health professionals.31,49,64,65,67 Providing an opportu-
nity for women to make decisions regarding their child-
birth
process
was
influenced
by
cultural
contexts.
Healthcare providers in Japan and women in South Africa
reported that women were likely to obey the decisions
made by others,49,61 whereas in the USA, Canada, Sweden,
Norway, China, Australia, Taiwan, Tanzania, and Iran
women expressed strong desires to be involved in decision
making.26,28,29,33,41,45,46,49,73,81,87
Midwives
believed
that
being a good advocate was based on ensuring that women
are involved in decision making,51,53,70 and considering the
936

Shakibazadeh et al.
 women’s right to choose and participate in the decision-
making process.36,41,65
Encouraging free mobilisation and allowing a preferred
position for birth was stated as part of humanised care by
women,45,52,62,66 and by healthcare providers.64
Availability of competent and motivated human resources
Both the proficiency and the adequacy of staff were
reported as being important in providing RMC.28,69 Mid-
wives’ professional knowledge and competence were con-
sidered essential by women for developing a trusting
relationship.31,35,43,80
The use of guidelines and protocols was discussed as
potentially diminishing women’s dignity in the UK by mid-
wives, as they felt under pressure to demonstrate their
compliance with guidelines.53 The need to gain knowledge
on RMC was discussed in several studies, predominantly by
healthcare
providers.49,57,64,69,75
Supportive
supervision
from managers was needed to provide RMC.65
Provision of efficient and effective care
Many women believed that a natural birth with minimal
interventions was healthiest for themselves and for their
baby,66 and they often wanted fewer interventions than
they had received.36,43,53,87 Healthcare providers in Benin
believed that they should support and respect decisions
made by women, and considered birth as a physiological
process that does not necessarily require intervention.67
Women expected healthcare providers to prevent unneces-
sary painful interventions (e.g. minimising the use of a uri-
nary
catheter,
vaginal
examinations,
and
episiotomy).
Healthcare providers believed that providing pain relief was
a component of respectful care.25,26,36,37,41,45,58,62,68,72–74,86,88
Women in the UK, Sweden, Italy, and Tanzania also high-
lighted that maternity care should be available with mini-
mal delay.26,30,37,51
Continuity of care
Being cared for by a familiar midwife was valued by
women across the world.28,36,38,46,47,49,62,66,88 The continu-
ous presence of staff during and after childbirth was reas-
suring
for
most
women
and
was
requested
by
them.25,33,34,36,69,70,73,85 Some nurses in Canada described
humanised birth as ‘being with the woman and being avail-
able on demand’.41
Being with their babies in the facility was a stated desire
for women across the globe.40,73,78,79
Discussion
Main findings
The findings of 67 qualitative studies on the views of
women, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders on
what constitutes RMC were largely consistent globally. The
emerging themes were used to develop a typology of RMC
during childbirth in health facilities to inform further work
in this important area.
Our review showed that women living in high-income
countries (HICs) tended to emphasise their rights to deci-
sion making and to active participation in their childbirth.
Comparatively, women in lower-income countries were less
likely to expect personal choice and decision making over
their childbirth experience. This may be attributable to dif-
ferences in cultural norms around childbirth, or it could be
that women in lower-income countries were not empow-
ered to make their own decisions. Globally, healthcare pro-
viders
consistently
identified
the
necessity
of
raising
awareness about RMC; however, it was often described as a
hard-to-reach target, in the face of legal and cultural pres-
sures, particularly within cultures of blame for poor out-
comes, defensive medical practices, and an over-emphasis
on documentation rather than quality of care.53 Healthcare
providers also expressed the view that academic curricula
mostly focus on biomedical care, to the exclusion of
humanistic aspects of care.
Strengths and limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use an evi-
dence-based approach to develop a typology for RMC. This
study used rigorous methods for synthesising and assessing
the confidence of review findings.14 The typology can
inform further work on developing evidence-based defini-
tions of how women experience RMC in facilities during
childbirth, and how this can be measured.
These findings cannot necessarily be generalised to home
birth by trained birth attendants. Moreover, new quantita-
tive studies may add additional information related to fac-
tors affecting RMC. Two studies were excluded because of
language limitation; we consider it unlikely that this has
affected the overall findings.
Interpretation (findings in light of other evidence)
Respectful maternity care (RMC) is a topic of growing
attention around the world. Several recent studies have
aimed to develop tools, and/or promote RMC, through
applying various forms of interventions.89–91 A strong theo-
retical base is needed to inform the further development
and validation of measurement tools.
This QES contributed to the framing and development
of recommendations in the forthcoming WHO guideline
‘WHO recommendations on intrapartum care for a posi-
tive childbirth experience’. The domains of WHO’s quality
of maternal and newborn care are supported by this
review.17,92 This review further highlighted the importance
of more specific themes under the domains in the WHO
framework, however, including: being free from harm and
937

Respectful care during childbirth in health facilities
 mistreatment; prospective provision of information; pro-
viding equitable maternity care; and continuity of care.
These themes show women’s further expectations of receiv-
ing respectful care.
In Bohren’s et al.5 systematic review on the mistreatment
of women during childbirth, women reported experiences
of mistreatment attributable to broader health-system con-
straints or failures. Our findings also reflect this, where
health-system components (such as physical environments)
mediated women’s positive birth experiences. Thus improv-
ing the quality of care through promoting RMC needs to
not only address interactions between the woman and the
provider, but also through improvements at the health-sys-
tem level. Health-system changes require the engagement of
all health-system actors/stakeholders, including non-clinical
staff and policymakers, to ensure that women receive the
right level of care at the right time.93 This highlights that
RMC is a broader concept than merely the absence of
mistreatment, although the two are intertwined. This is
important to consider when developing and evaluating
interventions to promote RMC, which may not necessarily
be the same as those that aim to prevent or reduce
mistreatment.8
Interventions to promote and sustain RMC are needed
at all three levels of health care (individual, health facility,
and health system levels). At the individual level, several
interventions are recognised as essential, rights-based com-
ponents of maternal care at birth, and need to be available
to all women (such as the need for privacy and confiden-
tiality). Others are evidence-based interventions known to
improve women’s satisfaction and/or to improve the health
of women or newborns, yet implementation remains lim-
ited in many settings. For example, the WHO currently
recommends that all women have access to a labour com-
panion of choice.94
At the health-facility level, there is a need for measures
to ensure that skilled birth attendants can provide efficient,
effective, and continuous maternity care. This includes:
supportive supervision, incentives, training, adequate physi-
cal infrastructure, and adequate human resources. Health-
care providers may also benefit from the more explicit
inclusion of RMC themes in pre-service and postgraduate
training, although the effectiveness of training to improve
RMC has not been specifically established.95
At the health-system level, the creation and integration
of standards and benchmarks relating to RMC should be
considered. This will require the development and valida-
tion of RMC-related indicators that along with the policy,
cultural, and financial implications are adequately respon-
sive to RMC-related improvements.
There is evidence that improving the quality of care,
including RMC, provides a return on the investment, by
saving mothers and newborns.96,97 Addressing some aspects
of RMC, such as improving the physical environment, is
likely to be resource intensive, and therefore the feasibility
of these aspects may be limited in poorly resourced set-
tings. Nevertheless, where RMC is a prioritised agenda
within health systems, it is feasible to organise healthcare
services to enable RMC across different levels.
This QES showed that the perceptions of women living
in both HICs and LMICs were largely consistent, although
the relative importance of the themes may vary between
settings. Designing culturally appropriate interventions to
promote RMC will clearly require changes in cultural
norms, particularly in settings where the mistreatment of
women arises from existing social norms and is regarded as
acceptable. Studies show that the participatory process and
sustained engagement around promoting RMC can con-
tribute to changes in health-facility culture.98
Policymakers should ensure the development and inte-
gration of written, up-to-date standards and benchmarks
for RMC that clearly define goals, operational plans, and
monitoring
mechanisms.
Policymakers
should
also
be
aware
that
shifts
in
health-system
infrastructure
(e.g.
increasing
workloads)
could
disrupt
implementation;
therefore, any infrastructural changes need close monitor-
ing to ensure the feasibility and sustainability of RMC
practices.
Respectful maternity care (RMC) should not be consid-
ered as an isolated intervention but rather as a critical
component for providing good-quality care for mothers
and newborns within health systems. Innovative approaches
need to be developed and tested to integrate RMC into
quality improvement efforts for maternal and newborn care
programmes.
The
evaluation
of
RMC
programmes
is
needed to better understand whether and how RMC can be
improved in obstetric care settings, and how this can be
achieved most efficiently. Such studies can provide critical
components
for
implementation,
which
can
then
be
adapted and applied in other settings. Future work should
also focus on: identifying RMC indicators, in terms of
validity and responsiveness in clinical settings; the effective
implementation of RMC policies in different LMIC and
HIC settings; and successful components/sets of compo-
nents applicable in different contexts.
Conclusion
This review presents an evidence-based typology of the
RMC during childbirth in health facilities, and demon-
strates that RMC is a broader concept than merely prevent-
ing the mistreatment of women at birth. RMC can be
supported and promoted at all three levels of health care
(individual, health facility, and health system). Globally,
women’s and provider’s perspectives on what constitutes
RMC are fairly consistent. Further research is needed to

 assess the validity and responsiveness of RMC indicators
before routine use in clinical settings.
