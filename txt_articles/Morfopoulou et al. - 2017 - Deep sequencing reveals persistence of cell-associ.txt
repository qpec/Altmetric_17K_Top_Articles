Introduction
Chronic encephalitis with progressive loss of motor and 
cognitive function and high levels of intrathecal antibod-
ies has been associated with persistent measles and rubella 
infections of the brain, most commonly in the context of 
Abstract Routine childhood vaccination against measles, 
mumps and rubella has virtually abolished virus-related 
morbidity and mortality. Notwithstanding this, we describe 
here devastating neurological complications associated 
with the detection of live-attenuated mumps virus Jeryl 
Lynn (MuVJL5) in the brain of a child who had undergone 
successful allogeneic transplantation for severe combined 
immunodeficiency (SCID). This is the first confirmed 
report of MuVJL5 associated with chronic encephalitis and 
highlights the need to exclude immunodeficient individu-
als from immunisation with live-attenuated vaccines. The

subacute sclerosing pan-encephalitis (SSPE). We describe 
here a case of chronic panencephalitis in a child who had 
undergone successful allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (allo-SCT) for severe combined immu-
nodeficiency (SCID) in whom neither measles nor other 
pathogens could be detected. Using deep sequencing of 
fresh brain biopsy material, we identified the Jeryl Lynn 
5 mumps virus (MuVJL5), a component of the measles, 
mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine that had been administered 
to the child before the diagnosis of SCID. Similar to find-
ings in measles viruses recovered from cases of SSPE, the 
mumps virus genome from the brain showed evidence of 
biased hypermutation, particularly in the matrix (M) gene. 
Comparison with sequence data from the original vaccine 
batch used to immunise this child identified the expansion 
of variants present at low frequency in the vaccine as well 
as de novo fixed missense substitutions. This case repre-
sents the first conclusive demonstration of chronic panen-
cephalitis due to mumps virus.
Case report
An 18-month-old male infant of consanguineous parents 
was diagnosed with SCID due to recombinase activat-
ing gene 1 (RAG1) deficiency (Fig. 1a) 4 months after 
MMR vaccination. The infant received a CD34-selected 
haploidentical allo-SCT. Full donor chimerism was rap-
idly achieved, with recovery of a diverse T cell repertoire 
(Fig. 1a) and excellent thymopoiesis. Post-transplant auto-
immune cytopenias necessitated rituximab therapy, fol-
lowing which immunoglobulin replacement therapy was 
administered. Six months post-allo-SCT the child devel-
oped a febrile illness with rash, diarrhoea, lethargy and 
seizures, with evidence of encephalitis on magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) with raised CSF protein (1.35 g/L) 
and 11 lymphocytes. Despite extensive screening for neu-
rotropic viruses and bacteria (Table S1), no pathogen was 
detected. He was treated with antimicrobials, antivirals and 
steroids, making a good recovery, and was discharged on 
anticonvulsant therapy. Over the next few months, the child 
was noted to have behavioural problems, hearing impair-
ment and speech and language delay. One year after dis-
charge, the seizures recurred with only partial response to 
antiepileptic treatment, but he remained stable for another 
9 months. Repeat MRI scan 2 years after initial encepha-
litic illness showed no new lesions. Over the next few 
months, the child’s neurological condition deteriorated, 
with increasing seizures together with episodes of lethargy, 
disorientation, agitation, ataxic gait, visual loss and even-
tual hospitalisation.
Repeat MRI of the brain at 40 months post-allo-SCT 
revealed abnormalities of grey and white matter, involving 
both cerebral hemispheres with multiple foci of contrast 
enhancement, including the basal ganglia, temporal and 
parieto-occipital cortices (Fig. 1b). In the absence of a firm 
diagnosis, a brain biopsy was taken.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics, aciclovir, ganciclovir and 
antifungal therapy were administered, as well as intrave-
nous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and high-dose methyl pred-
nisolone. Increasing seizures, left-sided weakness, cortical 
blindness and progressive global neurological deterioration 
over several weeks ended with the patient’s death 7 weeks 
following his last hospital admission.
Materials and methods
PCR assays
The viruses listed in Table S1 were tested for using real-
time PCR and found to be negative using specific primers 
and TaqMan probes on an ABI 7500 thermocycler.
All PCR assays were performed in-house at GOSH 
(Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London) as 
part of the routine diagnostic service, unless indicated oth-
erwise, in which case they were sent to a different labora-
tory for testing.
The CSF and urine samples collected during the patient’s 
last hospitalisation, as well as RNA re-extracted from the 
brain biopsy, were sent to the Public Health England Virus 
Reference Laboratory (Colindale) for mumps and mumps 
vaccine-specific RT-PCR (targeting the SH and HN gene) 
as well as measles and rubella-specific RT-PCR.
Sequencing
Library preparation—brain biopsy
Total RNA was purified from the frozen brain biopsy and 
polyA RNA-separated for sequencing library preparation.

instrument (Illumina, San Diego, US) using an 81 bp 
paired-end run. Libraries to be multiplexed in the same run 
were pooled in equimolar quantities, calculated from qPCR 
and/or Bioanalyser fragment analysis.
Samples were processed using Illumina’s TruSeq 
Stranded mRNA LT sample preparation kit (p/n RS-122-
2101) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Devia-
tions from the protocol were as follows: (1) 250 ng total 
RNA was used as starting material. (2) Fragmentation was 
carried out for 10 min instead of 8 min. (3) 14 Cycles of 
PCR were used.
Briefly, mRNA was isolated from total RNA using 
oligo dT beads to pull down poly-adenylated transcripts. 
The purified mRNA was fragmented using chemical frag-
mentation (heat and divalent metal cation) and primed 
with random hexamers. Strand-specific first-strand cDNA 
was generated using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase 
(Life Technologies) and actinomycin D. This allows RNA-
dependent synthesis while preventing spurious DNA-
dependent synthesis. The second cDNA strand was marked 
by performing synthesis incorporating dUTP.
The cDNA is then “A-tailed” at the 3′ end to pre-
vent self-ligation during the addition of the full-length 
TruSeq Adaptors (adaptors have a complementary “T” 
overhang). The adaptors contain sequences that allow the 
libraries to be amplified by PCR, bind to the flow cell and 
be uniquely identified by way of a 6 bp index sequence. 
Finally, a PCR is carried out to amplify only those cDNA 
fragments that have adaptors bound to both ends.
Library preparation—vaccine
An archived vial from the batch of MMR vaccine used to 
immunise the child was deep sequenced in a 2 × 251 paired-
end sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq as part of a 16-sam-
ple pool, generating 1,570,733 read pairs, at the National 
Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC).
Lyophilised vaccine was resuspended in 500 µl ster-
ile water for injection and viral RNA extracted using the 
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Spin Kit (Qiagen) according to 
the method of the manufacturer, with the omission of car-
rier RNA. DNA libraries were prepared by random reverse-
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction as described pre-
viously [18], followed by fragmentation, adaptor addition 
and indexing using the Nextera XT library preparation kit 
(Illumina).
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of brain biopsy 
were examined by conventional histology. Immunohisto-
chemistry was undertaken using two different antibodies in 
two independent laboratories.
Immunohistochemistry was undertaken using mumps 
nucleoprotein (N) antibody (7B10: sc-57921 Santa Cruz) at 
1 in 25 using a Leica Bond Max automated staining sys-
tem with pretreatment HIER (30) ER2. Additional immu-
nohistochemistry was independently undertaken using a 
different antibody. The monoclonal mumps antibody used 
[16] recognises the N protein of MuV (N93-51/01) and 
was used on an automated Leica BondMax immunostainer 
at a dilution of 1/4000 following HIER2 pre-treatment for 
20 min. Detection sites were detected with a polymer-based 
detection system (Bond, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, Cat. 
No. DS9800). Detection of mumps N in the CNS by immu-
nohistochemistry is shown in Figure S2.
Bioinformatics analysis
For the analysis of the brain biopsy sequencing data, we 
implemented the following steps. We first removed dupli-
cate sequences that can arise from PCR amplification with 
an in-house script that collapses pairs of reads based on 
sequence identity using 90 % of the sequence as signature 
(20 % removed as duplicates). Half of the reads overlapped 
with their “mates” within pairs and we therefore merged 
the overlapping reads using PEAR [32], taking into account 
both sequence match and quality scores. We performed 
quality control using PrinSeq [25], trimming low-quality 
ends and removing reads that had average quality less than 
15. We subsequently removed human sequences, using a 
quick aligner (Novoalign version V2.07.13—human refer-
ence genome GRCh37) as well as BLASTn [2]. We per-
formed de novo assembly of high-quality contigs using 
Velvet [31] (kmer = 81). Finally, we annotated the contigs 
and the unassembled reads against a custom protein refer-
ence database using BLASTx. Our custom protein refer-
ence database consists of viral, bacterial, human and mouse 
RefSeq proteins. More specifically, all known viruses in 
the RefSeq collection are used ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
refseq/release/viral/viral.1.protein.faa.gz, as well as all the 
bacteria of the human microbiome, according to ftp://ftp.
ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/HUMAN_MICROBIOM/Bacteria/
all.faa.tar.gz. The BLASTx results were the input of meta-
Mix [21].
For the analysis of the vaccine sequencing, we first 
removed 15 % of the reads as duplicates and merged over-
lapping reads. We trimmed the reads based on base quality 
(q = 20) using Trim Galore! (http://www.bioinformatics.
babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/). We then selected 
for Jeryl Lynn vaccine strain reads using BLASTn [2] and a 
Jeryl Lynn nucleotide reference database.
We performed de novo assembly with SPADeS [4] fol-
lowed by QUAST [12] for both the vaccine and the brain 
sequencing data. In the latter case, we used the MuV reads 
as identified by metaMix [21]. Novoalign, Samtools [17]

and VarScan2 [15] were used for consensus sequence gen-
eration and variant calling. We filtered variants based on 
quality, depth, frequency and strand bias (quality ≥30, at 
least 5 reads for the variant site, frequency ≥5 %, p value 
<0.01). The variants were annotated with SnpEff [7].
We compared the number of non-synonymous changes 
observed in each of the MuV genes to the number we 
would expect if the observed missense mutations were ran-
domly distributed across the genome, correcting for the 
gene length. Significant deviation from the expected num-
ber of mutations was tested with the goodness-of-fit two-
tailed exact binomial test. Analysis was conducted with the 
statistical language R (http://www.r-project.org).
We estimated a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree 
using RAxML [27] and 64 full MuV genomes from Gen-
Bank (accessed on 20 June 2015).
Results
CSF on last admission was acellular, but with oligoclonal 
bands, although total protein was low 0.12 g/L (normal 
0.15–0.45 g/L. The oligoclonal bands were negative for 
HSV and VZV antibodies. Polyoma JC virus was detected 
by PCR in blood and urine on one occasion each (Table 
S2). CSF PCR was negative for 16S (bacterial) and 18S 
(fungal) rRNA and for a wide number of viral pathogens 
(Table S2), including JC virus, mumps, measles and rubella 
viruses. No pathogens were detected in stool, urine or 
blood (Table S2). CSF was negative for rubella and mea-
sles antibodies. In the absence of a firm diagnosis, a brain 
biopsy showed neuronal loss, astrocytic gliosis, reactive 
astrocytes, microglia and chronic inflammatory cells, but 
no viral inclusions or granulomata (Fig. 2a–e legend for 
detailed description). Infiltrating T lymphocytes were iden-
tified by CD3 staining (Fig. 2f).
RNA-Seq of the brain biopsy [5, 20] resulted in 110 mil-
lion 81 base pair (bp) paired-end reads. Approximately, 
one million reads were identified as non-human and were 
subsequently used for potential pathogen identification 
by the metaMix method [21]. Mumps virus was the only 
potential pathogen detected, with 77,624 assigned reads. 
The remaining reads were either unclassified or mapped to 
human and bacteria that are either environmental, part of 
human flora, kit contaminants [23] or of unknown signifi-
cance (Table S3).
No reads mapped to measles, rubella or polyoma JC 
viruses. Using de novo assembly, the full-length viral 
sequence was recovered (99.94 % genome coverage, 
median coverage depth: 290) (Figure S1). Maximum like-
lihood phylogenetic analysis showed that the consensus 
viral sequence clustered closely with the MuVJL5 vaccine 
strains (Figure S2) and shared 99.6 % identity with the 
publicly available sequence (GenBank: FJ211585) of the 
mumps component of the MMR preparation administered 
to the child. The sequence identified in this study is named 
MuVJL5-London (GenBank: KX223397). PCR of RNA 
extracted from the brain biopsy confirmed the presence of 
MuVJL5 vaccine strain (Table S2), but was negative for all 
other viruses, including polyoma JC (Table S2). Immuno-
histochemistry showed the presence of MuV nucleocapsid 
(N) protein with a neuronal pattern of staining (Fig. 2g, 
h). Control cortex and white matter were negative. We 
observed no specific staining for other pathogens (Fig. 2g,h 
for details) and no evidence of viral intracytoplasmic or 
intranuclear inclusion bodies. Retrospective testing showed 
weakly positive mumps antibody in the CSF.
To investigate this finding further, three million 251 bp 
paired-end reads were generated from the MMR vaccine 
batch that was used to immunise the child, of which 82,000 
reads mapped to the MuVJL5 vaccine strain (median cov-
erage: 706, Figure S1). There were no fixed differences 
identified compared with the reference FJ211585. Fifteen 
positions in the vaccine sequence were found to be poly-
morphic (variant allele frequency (VAF) 5 % or greater, 
Table S4).
Of 55 fixed nucleotide differences between MuVJL5-
London and the vaccine, 12 had been present as a minor-
ity variant (10–24 %) in the vaccine (Figure S3, Table S4, 
VAF 75 % or greater). Of the remaining 43 new mutations, 
28 coded for missense amino acid substitutions (Fig. 3, 
Table S5), with nine (32 %) located in the M protein, more 
than expected by chance (two-tailed exact binomial test 
p = 2.8e−04, Table S6). Other than position 140 in the M 
protein, the missense mutations were unique to MuVJL5-
London (Figure S6). The Tyr140His substitution in 
MuVJL5-London is found in all wild-type strains as well as 
the more neurovirulent MuVUr Urabe and the MuVJL2 Jeryl 
Lynn 2 vaccine strain, which is a minor component of some 
vaccines [1] (Figure S6).
Discussion
Prior to the introduction of routine MMR vaccination, 
mumps virus was the commonest cause of meningoen-
cephalitis in children and was associated with serious 
sequelae including deafness and orchitis [11, 22]. No 
meningoencephalitis has been confirmed following the 
Jeryl lynn mumps vaccine, which this child received, and 
other adverse effects are rare [19] and usually self-limiting 
[14]. Mumps and rubella vaccine virus transcripts were 
detected in the brain of a child with IFNAR2 deficiency 
who developed fatal encephalitis following MMR vaccina-
tion [9], but brain immunohistochemistry was negative in 
this case (JB personal communication).

The presentation of this case, shares features with two 
previously published cases of MuV-related progressive 
encephalitis [13, 28]. Moreover, like measles SSPE and 
measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) [29], which 
occurs in immunocompromised children within months of 
measles infection or vaccination, and unlike acute MuV 
encephalitis, no virus was detected in the CSF. How-
ever, other hallmarks of SSPE and MIBE such as high 
virus-specific antibody levels in CSF [29], were absent, 
although the child had deficient B cell function.
Importantly, however, in comparison with MuVJL5 from 
the vaccine batch used to immunise the child, MuVJL5-
London showed evidence of T to C biased hypermutation, 
particularly in the M (matrix) gene suggestive of adenosine 
deaminase (ADAR)-driven mutation [10] (Table S4). The 
same finding in MV recovered from SSPE and MIBE [6, 
Fig. 2  Much of the cortex 
showed significant tissue dam-
age with neuronal loss. There 
was prominent reactive gliosis 
composed of plump astrocyto-
sis with abundant eosinophilic 
cytoplasm and immunoreactiv-
ity for glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP) (a, e) with 
relative sparing of the superfi-
cial layers of the cortex. Some 
areas showed perivascular 
lymphocytosis and collections 
of macrophages (a, c). In others, 
with better neuronal preserva-
tion, there were foci of micro-
glial nodules, neuronophagia, 
generalised microgliosis (dem-
onstrated on CD68 staining b, 
d)) and patchy parenchymal and 
perivascular lymphocytes, the 
majority of which were positive 
for the T cell markers (f). Occa-
sional foci of mineralisation 
were observed, but there was 
no vasculitis and no viral inclu-
sions. The pathological changes 
extended into the underlying 
white matter (data not shown), 
which showed patchy loss of 
myelin staining on luxol fast 
blue. There was focal chronic 
inflammation in the leptomenin-
ges. Mumps immunohistochem-
istry was positive in a neuronal 
pattern (g, h). We observed 
no specific staining for other 
pathogens HSV1 or 2, CMV, 
EBV, toxoplasma, JC virus, bac-
teria (Gram and Gram Twort),

Neelson) or fungi (Grocott),

29, 30] has been shown to reduce M protein expression [29] 
and is mooted to promote cell to cell spread and reduced 
viral assembly and shedding into the CSF. Biased hyper-
mutation and lack of protein expression may also reflect the 
dispensability of M protein for neurovirulence [3].
MuVJL5-London was characterised by the expansion of 
variants present at low frequency in the original vaccine, 
two of which have previously been described [8], as well 
as fixed de novo mutations in the M, N, P, L and F genes, 
a finding which again references those described for MV 
in SSPE. While most amino acid substitutions occurred in 
the M gene, in vitro data using the rat model implicates the 
F protein [3, 16] as key for mumps virus neurovirulence in 
acute encephalitis [16, 24] as well as for measles neurovir-
ulence in SSPE [3]. The absence of within-host sequence 
diversity in the M and F ORFs (Figure S5, Table S7) fur-
ther suggests functional constraints on these genes and 
supports directional selection acting on one or more of the 
amino acid changes in these proteins favouring spread and 
replication of MuVJL5 in the brain.
In this child, clinical deterioration occurred following 
good T cell reconstitution in the context of normal T cell 
receptor repertoire and good levels of thymopoiesis. One 
possibility is that the presence of mumps tolerised and dys-
regulated T cell responses, thus permitting long-term viral 
persistence and the accumulation of pathogenic mutations. 
We made use of data on the donor’s HLA genotype to pre-
dict specific CTL cell epitopes (IEDB epitope prediction 
tool, percentile rank cutoff ≤1 %) in the MuVJL5 mumps 
vaccine virus. Five missense mutations were located in the 
predicted CTL epitopes for the donor’s HLA (Fig. 3, Table 
S8). Of these, four had predicted T cell binding affinities 
at a level likely to correlate with T cell recognition [26] 
and reduced binding affinity in the mutated peptide (Table 
S8). This raises the possibility that partial escape of virus 
from immune surveillance through specific mutational 
changes may have occurred, especially as the same was 
not observed for peptides recognised by randomly selected 
HLA alleles (Supplementary Appendix, Table S8).
In summary, we report a case of progressive chronic 
encephalitis in a patient with SCID, in which the MuVJL5 
vaccine strain was detected in brain biopsy by deep 
sequencing. This case emphasises the generally poor rates 
of pathogen detection in encephalitides, making a strong 
case for deep sequencing of brain tissue where other meth-
ods have failed. The similar pattern of viral mutations in 
this case and those of measles SSPE suggest a common 
pathogenic process and further work is currently under-
way to determine the contribution of fixed mutations to the 
chronic encephalitic phenotype observed in the patient. It is 
important to note that MMR continues to be a highly effec-
tive and safe vaccine in the vast majority of individuals. 
However, this case highlights the importance of developing 
strategies such as newborn screening to exclude the very 
small proportion of infants at extremely high risk of com-
plications from live-attenuated vaccines.
