Abstract
Background: Drinking in youth is linked to other risky behaviours, educational failure and premature death. Prior
research has examined drinking in mid and late teenagers, but little is known about the factors that influence drinking at
the beginning of adolescence. Objectives were: 1. to assess associations of parental and friends’ drinking with reported
drinking among 11 year olds; 2. to investigate the roles of perceptions of harm, expectancies towards alcohol, parental
supervision and family relationships on reported drinking among 11 year olds.
Methods: Analysis of data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study on 10498 11-year-olds. The outcome measure was
having drank an alcoholic drink, self-reported by cohort members.
Results: 13.6 % of 11 year olds reported having drank. Estimates reported are odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals.
Cohort members whose mothers drank were more likely to drink (light/moderate = 1.6, 1.3 to 2.0, heavy/binge = 1.8, 1.4
to 2.3). Cohort members whose fathers drank were also more likely to drink but these estimates lost statistical significance
when covariates were adjusted for (light/moderate = 1.3, 0.9 to 1.9, heavy/binge = 1.3, 0.9 to 1.9). Having friends who
drank was strongly associated with cohort member drinking (4.8, 3.9 to 5.9). Associated with reduced odds of cohort
member drinking were: heightened perception of harm from 1–2 drinks daily (some = 0.9, 0.7 to 1.1, great = 0.6, 0.5 to
0.7); and negative expectancies towards alcohol (0.5, 0.4 to 0.7). Associated with increased odds of cohort member
drinking were: positive expectancies towards alcohol (1.9, 1.4 to 2.5); not being supervised on weekends and weekdays
(often = 1.2, 1.0 to 1.4); frequent battles of will (1.3, 1.1 to 1.5); and not being happy with family (1.2, 1.0 to 1.5).
Conclusions: Examining drinking at this point in the lifecourse has potentially important public health implications as
around one in seven 11 year olds have drank, although the vast majority are yet to explore alcohol. Findings support
interventions working at multiple levels that incorporate family and peer factors to help shape choices around risky
behaviours including drinking.

Background
Regular heavy and binge drinking are recognised as major
public health problems in terms of mortality, morbidity and
wider social and economic consequences [1, 2], and regular
and heavy drinking in youth are related to risky behaviours,
educational failure and to the leading causes of death in
adolescence [3–5]. Among the vast majority of people who
consume alcohol, initiation of drinking takes place during
adolescence [6]. The question remains open as to whether
early initiation of drinking causes problematic alcohol use
later in life with recent review articles reaching opposing
conclusions [7, 8]. However, the importance of adoles-
cent drinking is likely shaped by the timing and pat-
tern of drinking as well as the broader social context.
Research from Italy and Finland suggests the signifi-
cance of context specific alcohol socialisation pro-
cesses in relation to adolescent drinking [9]. Over the
last decade there has been a decline in the prevalence
of drinking among adolescents in the UK [10], how-
ever consumption levels among UK youth remain
higher than the European average [11]. Among UK
adolescent drinkers there is no evidence of a reduc-
tion in the quantity of alcohol consumed [10], and
hospital admissions due to alcohol among the under
18 s remain a concern [12].

 Adolescence is a time of dramatic change that influ-
ences young people’s sense of autonomy and their ex-
ploration of risky behaviours. Factors shown to influence
young people’s drinking include parent and peer drink-
ing behaviours, perceptions of risk, expectancies towards
alcohol and supportive family relationships [13–17].
Most prior studies have focused on drinking behaviours
in mid and late teenage years [13, 17–19] and as
highlighted in recent reviews [4, 20] less is known about
influences on drinking among pre-teens. Improving our
understanding of factors that influence drinking initi-
ation at the beginning of adolescence could help develop
policies and effective alcohol harm reduction strategies.
Given the paucity of work on the initiation of drinking
in very early adolescence, in this paper we address two re-
search objectives 1. to assess associations of parental and
friends’ drinking with reported drinking among 11 year
olds; and 2. to investigate the roles of perceptions of harm,
expectancies towards alcohol, parental supervision and
family relationships on drinking among 11 year olds. To
do this we analysed data from the large contemporary
population based Millennium Cohort Study.
Methods
The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a UK nationally
representative prospective cohort study of children born
into 19244 families between September 2000 and January
2002 [21]. Participating families were selected from a ran-
dom sample of electoral wards with a stratified sampling
design to ensure adequate representation of all four UK
countries, disadvantaged and ethnically diverse areas. The
first sweep of data was collected when cohort members
were around 9 months and the subsequent four sweeps of
data were collected at ages 3, 5, 7, and 11 years. At the
11 year sweep, interviews were conducted during home
visits with cohort members and their carers, and questions
asked about alcohol consumption, socioeconomic circum-
stances and family relationships. Cohort members filled out
a self-completion booklet in a private place within the
home. Interview data were available for 69 % of families
when cohort members were aged 11.
Drinking at age 11
In a question developed for the MCS survey, cohort
members were asked “Have you ever had an alcoholic
drink? That is more than a few sips?” (yes/no).
Parent and friends’ drinking
Parents were asked about the frequency and amount of
alcohol they drank. “How often do you have a drink that
contains alcohol?” (4 or more times a week, 2–3 times a
week, 2–4 times per month, Monthly or less, Never).
“How many standard alcoholic drinks do you have on a
typical occasion?” Response options on frequency and
quantity of alcohol consumed meant it was only possible
to approximate drinking categories as set out in guidelines
by the UK Department of Health. The same categories
were used for mothers and fathers as follows: None;
Light/moderate - those who drank but were not heavy/
binge drinkers; Heavy/binge - 4 or more times a week and
drinks a minimum of 3–4 drinks per drinking occasion, or
a minimum of 5–6 drinks per occasion. Separate categor-
ies were created for cohort members where information
on parents’ drinking behaviour was missing and when the
father was absent from the household.
Friends’ drinking was assessed by asking cohort mem-
bers “How many of your friends drink alcohol?” Response
categories were recoded: None of them as No; Some/
Most/All of them as Yes; don’t know was retained as a
separate category.
Covariates
Cohort member and family characteristics
Gender; puberty, assessed from responses by the mother
to questions (for girls - hair on body, breast growth,
menstruation, boys - hair on body, voice change, facial
hair); birth order (first vs subsequent); current socioe-
motional difficulties (normal vs high score) [22]; anti-
social behaviours (“Have you ever … been noisy or rude
in a public place so that people complained or got you
into trouble? … taken something from a shop without
paying for it? … written things or sprayed paint on a
building, fence or train or anywhere else where you
shouldn’t have? … on purpose damaged anything in a
public place that didn’t belong to you, for example by
burning, smashing or breaking things like cars, bus shel-
ters and rubbish bins?” categorised 0, 1, 2 or more); tru-
ancy (yes/no); cigarette smoking (yes/no); quintiles of
equivalised family income; religious affiliation (none vs
any of Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, other).
Potential moderating variables
Perception of risk due to alcohol was assessed by the
question “How much do you think people risk harming
themselves if they drink one or two alcoholic drinks nearly
every day?” (no/slight risk, some risk, great risk). Positive
expectancies towards alcohol were assessed by the follow-
ing questions: “Drinking beer, wine, or spirits is a way to
make friends with other people”; “It is easier to open up
and talk about one's feelings after a few drinks of alcohol”;
“Drinking alcohol makes people …worry less; …happier
with themselves”. Negative expectancies were assessed
using questions: “Drinking alcohol … gets in the way of
school work; … makes it hard to get along with friends”;
“If I drank alcohol without my parents’ permission I
would be caught and punished”. Items were summed
and used as two separate scales [23].

 Parental supervision was assessed by questions about
the weekday and weekend frequency of cohort member
spending unsupervised time with friends (playing in the
park, going to the shops or just ‘hanging out’). Items
were combined into a three category variable: rarely/
never (at most occasionally at weekends/on weekdays),
sometimes, often (unsupervised most weekends and at
least one day per week).
Markers of family relationships were: frequent battles of
will with cohort member (yes/no); mother-cohort member
closeness (extremely/very close vs fairly/not very close);
cohort member happiness with their family (“On a scale
of 1 to 7 where ‘1’ means completely happy and ‘7’ means
not at all happy, how do you feel about your family?” Re-
sponses corresponding to the top decile of the distribution
were taken to indicate happy with family) [24].
Study sample
Data on cohort member drinking were available for 12644
participants. Missing data reduced the sample to 10498
(83.0 %), as follows: friends drinking = 56; puberty = 1010;
socioemotional difficulties = 475; religious affiliation = 34;
antisocial behaviours = 27; perception of harm = 337; posi-
tive expectancies = 189; negative expectancies = 315; paren-
tal supervision = 87; frequent battles = 1106; relationship
between mother and child = 762; happy with family = 91.
Statistical analysis
To estimate the association between our exposures of pri-
mary interest – mother’s, father’s or friends’ drinking with
cohort member drinking, we ran three sets of logistic re-
gression models adding covariates in stages. Boys were
more likely to report drinking compared with girls (15.7
vs. 11.3 %), but as there were no gender differences in ob-
served associations between parent and friends’ drinking
with cohort member drinking, we present analyses for
boys and girls combined, and all models adjust for gender.
Model 0 is the baseline model which includes the pri-
mary independent variable (mother’s, father’s or friends’
drinking) and gender.
Model 1 additionally adjusts for control variables: pu-
berty, birth order, socioemotional difficulties, antisocial
behaviours, truancy, smoking, income, religion and for
other alcohol exposure variables e.g. when mother’s
drinking is the primary exposure, we add father’s and
friends’ drinking to this step of the analysis.
Model 2 is fully adjusted adding in potential moder-
ator and mediator variables, perception of harm due to
alcohol, positive and negative expectancies, parental
supervision and family relationships (battles, closeness,
happiness with family).
All analysis was carried out using Stata version 13.1
(Stata Corp).
Results
Who drinks by age 11?
Overall 13.6 % of cohort members reported having drunk
more than a few sips of an alcoholic drink. Cohort mem-
bers who reported drinking were more likely to be boys
(15.7 % vs 11.3 %, p < 0.001), to have started puberty
(14.3 % vs 13.2 %), to be a second or later born child
(14.0 % vs 12.9 %), to have socioemotional difficulties
(18.7 % vs 12.8 %, p < 0.001), to report antisocial behaviours
(none = 10.1 %, 1 = 20.7 %, 2 or more = 42.0 %, p < 0.001),
report truancy (24.8 % vs 13.2 %, p < 0.001), smoke ciga-
rettes (50.9 % vs 12.4 %, p < 0.001), to be from poorer fam-
ilies (15.4 % in the poorest quintile vs 11.5 % in richest
quintile, p < 0.01) and not have any religious affiliation
(15.7 % vs 11.6 %, p < 0.001). Table 1 shows the distribution
of covariates by cohort member drinking.
Does parental or friends’ drinking matter?
Cohort members whose mothers drank were more likely
to drink and these estimates changed little on adjustment
for covariates (fully adjusted OR – light/moderate = 1.6,
1.3 to 2.0, heavy/binge = 1.8, 1.4 to 2.3 compared to those
with non-drinking mothers). Cohort members for whom
data on mother’s drinking was missing were also more
likely to drink (fully adjusted OR = 2.0, 1.2 to 3.4). Cohort
members whose fathers drank were also more likely to
drink but these estimates lost statistical significance when
covariates were taken into account (fully adjusted OR –
light/moderate = 1.3, 0.9 to 1.9, heavy/binge = 1.3, 0.9 to
1.9). Having friends who drank was associated with more
7 times the odds of cohort member drinking, and twice
the odds when cohort members reported not knowing
whether their friends drank. These estimates changed on
adjustment for covariates but remained highly statistically
significant (fully adjusted ORs 4.8, 3.9 to 5.9 and 1.8, 1.4
to 2.2 respectively) (Table 2).
What is the role of perceptions of harm, expectancies
towards alcohol, parental supervision, and family
relationships?
Perceptions of harm, expectancies towards alcohol, paren-
tal supervision, and family relationships were associated
with the likelihood of cohort member drinking in the ex-
pected direction (Appendix Table 3). Associated with the
reduced likelihood of cohort member drinking were:
heightened perception of harm from drinking 1–2 drinks
daily (OR - some risk = 0.9, 0.7 to 1.1, great risk = 0.6, 0.5
to 0.7); and negative expectancies towards alcohol (OR =
0.5, 0.4 to 0.7). Associated with an increased risk of cohort
member drinking were: positive expectancies towards
alcohol (OR = 1.9, 1.4 to 2.5); not being supervised by par-
ents on weekends and weekdays (for often OR = 1.2, 1.0 to
1.4); frequent battles of will (OR = 1.3, 1.1 to 1.5); and not
being happy with family (OR = 1.2, 1.0 to 1.5).

 Discussion
Our results suggest that nearly 14 % of 11 year olds in
the UK have had an alcoholic drink. The odds of drink-
ing were greater when their friends drank compared to
when their parents drank: boys and girls who reported
having friends who drank were five times more likely to
report drinking themselves compared to those who re-
ported having friends who did not drink. Having a
mother who drank heavily was associated with an 80 %
increased odds of drinking, however, fathers’ drinking
was not independently associated with children’s drink-
ing. Our results suggest that 11 year olds’ perceptions of
risk, their expectancies towards alcohol and relationships
with their families were independently related to the
likelihood of drinking.
Distinct strengths of this work are that we used data from
a large sample representative of 11 year olds in the UK; we

 simultaneously examined relationships with parents and
friends drinking; and we were able to take into account rich
contextual information about young people’s understanding
of the risk of drinking alcohol, their expectancies, positive
and negative, towards alcohol and family relationships. On
the other hand, there are several limitations to ac-
knowledge, including that the analyses were cross sec-
tional as information on cohort member and friends'
drinking,
perceptions
of
harm
and
expectancies
around drinking are only available from one wave of
data collection thus causal inference cannot be drawn;
the data on cohort member and friends’ drinking
were developed for the MCS survey making it diffi-
cult to compare prevalence rates with other studies,
although closed questions as used in this study have
been shown to be valid markers of alcohol consump-
tion in adolescents [25]; the data on cohort member
and friends’ drinking were reported by the cohort
member and thus may be prone to under or over es-
timation with one prior contemporary study suggest-
ing a lower prevalence of drinking among British
11 year olds [10], although this may be due to differ-
ent survey questions; we were not able to distinguish
those who had just tried one or two drinks ever from
cohort
members
who
are
regularly
drinking;
also
there were no data available on the context of cohort
member drinking and so it was not possible to assess
the circumstances in which, or with whom, 11 year
olds drank.
Prior work has charted the prevalence of drinking among
11 year olds in the UK [10] and elsewhere [26, 27]. To our
knowledge this is the first UK study in this young age group
to attempt a detailed exploration of family and peer influ-
ences, along with the young person’s views about alcohol
on the likelihood of drinking. Moreover, most prior work
has been set in the US [28] and it may be that associations
vary across contexts [9]. We examined associations be-
tween parent and friends’ drinking and family relationships
at the very start of the adolescent period, whereas prior
studies have looked at these associations among older ado-
lescents. For instance, Cable and Sacker’s examination of
16 year olds from the 1970 Birth cohort suggests that nega-
tive expectancies are not protective [13]. However, we
might expect to see the same pattern of association as ado-
lescence proceeds with peer influences and associated social
norms having a more profound effect on alcohol use in
later than early adolescence [13, 15–17].
A recent Cochrane review [29] concluded there was
limited evidence that school/education based interven-
tion programmes were effective, and where they did
work the focus was more holistic, not solely on alcohol.
In keeping with this we found markers of other risky be-
haviours, including smoking and antisocial behaviours to
be strongly independently related to drinking at age 11.
Clearly, there are opportunities to intervene and help
shape choices around risky behaviours including drink-
ing. Our findings support policies working at multiple
levels that incorporate family and peer factors. For ex-
ample: compared with mother’s drinking, father’s drink-
ing was not as strongly related to drinking in their
11 year olds but this may be because fathers are more
likely to drink in settings other than the home. Our ob-
servations that greater awareness of the harms from al-
cohol and negative expectancies are associated with
reduced odds of 11 year olds drinking support strategies
to empower young people to say no to alcohol. This is
particularly important, as undoubtedly, peer influences
become stronger in shaping young people’s behaviours
as adolescence proceeds.
Our study was not able to examine contexts around
drinking occasions among 11 year olds – who do they
drink with? Where, when and what do they drink?
How
do
they
acquire
alcohol
and
what
are
the
broader social norms around drinking? One study
that compared young people’s drinking in Italy and
Finland showed that Italian youth were more likely to
drink with meals under family supervision, whereas
Finnish youth were more likely to drink in settings
that led to drunkenness [9]. Being able to investigate
context in more detail would help inform alcohol
harm prevention strategies. Longitudinal studies look-
ing at changes in expectancies towards alcohol and
how these relate to changes in young people’s behav-
iours including potential clustering with other risky
behaviours are important areas for future study.
Conclusions
Examining drinking at this point in the lifecourse has
potentially
important
public
health
implications
as
around one in seven 11 year olds have drank, although
the vast majority are yet to explore alcohol. Even though
the links between early drinking and later life drinking
problems remain unclear, we need to further improve
our understanding of the relative importance and mean-
ing of drinking in early adolescence as regular and heavy
drinking among young people is linked to harmful be-
haviours and premature death. However, apparent cul-
turally specific differences in the meaning of drinking
underscores the importance of identifying factors that
shape early drinking experiences across settings. Improv-
ing our understanding of context specific drivers of early
drinking presents golden opportunities to develop effect-
ive policy and prevention strategies.
