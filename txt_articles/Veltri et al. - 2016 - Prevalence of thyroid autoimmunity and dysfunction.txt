Clinical Study
Abstract
Objective: Thyroid disorders and iron deficiency (ID) are associated with obstetrical and fetal complications. Iron is 
essential for the normal functioning of thyroid peroxidase (TPO-abs) and ID is frequent during pregnancy. The aim of 
this study was to compare the prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity (TAI) and dysfunction during the first trimester of 
pregnancy in women with and without ID.
Design: Cross-sectional data analysis of 1900 pregnant women nested within an ongoing prospective collection of 
pregnant women’s data.
Method: The study was performed in a single, tertiary referral center. During the first antenatal visit, ferritin, TPO-abs, 
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 (FT4) were measured and age and BMI were recorded. ID was defined 
as ferritin <15 µg/L, TAI when TPO-abs was >60 kIU/L, and subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) when TSH was >2.5 mIU/L.
Results: ID was present in 35% of women. Age and BMI were comparable between both groups. In the ID group, 
the prevalence of TAI and SCH was significantly higher, compared with that in the non-ID group (10% vs 6% and 
20% vs 16%; P = 0.011 and 0.049 respectively). Ferritin was inversely correlated with serum TSH (ρ = −0.076; P = 0.001) 
and positive with FT4 levels (ρ = 0.112; P < 0.001). In the logistic regression model, ID remained associated with 
TAI after correction for confounding factors (P = 0.017). The association with SCH was absent after correction for 
the confounders in the logistic regression model (P = 0.082), but remained present in the linear regression model 
(P = 0.035).
Conclusions: ID was frequent during the first trimester of pregnancy and was associated with a higher prevalence of 
TAI, higher serum TSH, and lower FT4 levels.
Introduction
The importance of trace elements and minerals (copper, 
zinc, selenium and iron) for the normal functioning 
of the thyroid has extensively been studied and is well 
recognized. Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroid 
hormones and selenium is necessary for the deiodinase 
enzymes and to protect the thyroid against oxidative 
stress (1, 2). Iron also plays an important role in the 
normal functioning of thyroid peroxidase (TPO), a heme-
dependent protein and it also facilitates the actions of 
iodine in the thyroid (3, 4). Iron deficiency (ID) remains 
a worldwide problem, affecting about 20% of the world’s 
population. ID arises when physiological requirements 
cannot be met by iron absorption from the diet such 
as it is the case during pregnancy, when iron needs are

Clinical Study
F Veltri, S Decaillet and others
Iron deficiency and thyroid 
disorders during pregnancy
tripled because of expansion of maternal red cell mass 
and growth of the fetus and placenta. In industrialized 
countries, the prevalence of ID during pregnancy ranges 
from 24 to 44% (5, 6). ID can be diagnosed by low serum 
ferritin levels, in the absence of inflammation, and it 
is the first parameter that changes when iron stores 
decrease, independently of recent iron intake. In women 
of reproductive age, a level <15 
μg/L has a specificity of 
98% and a sensitivity of 75% for ID (7).
The use of ferritin as a marker of peripheral thyroid 
hormone (in)sensitivity is well known and is used as a 
diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis between 
thyrotropinoma and the thyroid hormone resistance 
syndrome (8). Data on the association between ferritin 
and thyroid disorders as outcome are limited to a few 
well-designed studies, of which one showed that ID was 
doubling the risk of developing hypothyroidism (9, 10). 
None of these studies investigated the impact of ID on 
thyroid autoimmunity (TAI). The association of ID and 
thyroid disorders during pregnancy is limited to one 
study measuring ID during the second and third trimester 
of pregnancy and a recent publication, linking ID with 
isolated hypothyroxinemia (11, 12). In the first study, 
TAI was not taken into account and in the second, the 
presence of TAI was an exclusion criterion.
The 
association 
between 
TAI/subclinical 
hypothyroidism (SCH) and increased fetal/obstetrical 
complications, the absence of studies investigating the 
prevalence of TAI in pregnant women with ID and finally 
the important role of iron for TPO functioning, were the 
main reasons to perform this study.
The aims of this study were to investigate the 
prevalence of ID during the first trimester of pregnancy 
and to investigate whether ID was an associated 
variable for the development of TAI and/or thyroid 
dysfunction. These observations were furthermore 
corrected for other confounders such as women’s BMI 
and age in two regression models.
Patients and methods
Overall study design
The obstetrical clinic of the CHU St-Pierre is a downtown 
university 
(tertiary 
referral) 
maternity 
in 
Brussels 
(Belgium), with about 3200 deliveries per year. In this 
study, we report on the data of a cross-sectional analysis 
of 1900 pregnant women (period 2013–2014), which 
was nested within the ongoing prospective collection of 
women’s obstetrical parameters and biological data. This 
study was approved by the institutional review board 
(AK/15-11-114/4568). In our center, a complete biological 
analysis is systematically prescribed at the first prenatal 
consultation (before 12th week of amenorrhea), including 
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T4 (FT4), TPO-
abs and iron status by the means of serum ferritin.
The diagnosis of an underlying thyroid disease was 
further evaluated based on the personal history of goiter, 
thyroid diseases, and/or prior use of thyroid medication 
and hereby 86 women were excluded from the study due 
to LT4 treatment. Women treated with iron supplements 
at the first antenatal visit were also excluded from the 
study (n 
= 
4). Files of pregnant women working in our 
institution were not included in the study for privacy 
reasons (n 
= 
114). Finally, 1900 files of pregnant women 
over the period 2013–2014 were included in the study 
(flowchart in Fig. 1). All over, there were less than 1% of 
the women smoking before pregnancy, and therefore, this 
variable was not taken into account.
The iron status was expressed in two groups of women 
(ID and non-ID); all other parameters were expressed 
as continuous values and categorical data (besides FT4).

Clinical Study
F Veltri, S Decaillet and others
Iron deficiency and thyroid 
disorders during pregnancy
ID was defined as a ferritin level <15 
µg/L, TAI was present 
when TPO-abs were >60 
IU/L, SCH when serum TSH levels 
were >2.5 
mIU/L, obesity when BMI was ≥30 
kg/m2 and 
older women were defined when their age was ≥30 
years. 
(Subclinical) hyperthyroidism was defined as a TSH level 
<0.10 
mIU/L. The impact of the other variables, age, and 
BMI on TAI and SCH/TSH as outcomes was tested in a 
linear and logistic regression model.
Serum assay
All provisions were implemented by the laboratory 
of hormonology of our institution. Serum TSH, 
FT4, 
TPO-abs 
and 
ferritin 
levels 
were 
measured 
using the Chemiluminescence Centaur XP Siemens 
immunoanalyzer. The reference values were 0.3–4.0 
mIU/L, 
0.8–2.0 
ng/dL, <60 
kIU/L and 15–300 
µg/L for TSH, FT4, 
TPO-abs and ferritin respectively. The total imprecision 
coefficient of variations (CVs) were 6.9, 4.2, 7.6 and 3.7% 
for TSH, FT4, TPO-abs and ferritin respectively.
For conversion of FT4, 1 
ng/dL 
= 
12.9 
pmol/L.
Statistical analysis
Data were stored in a Microsoft Excel database and 
statistical analyses were performed using Stata 11.2 software 
(Lakeway Drive, TX, USA). Continuous data were all given 
as median (min–max) values, since they were not normally 
distributed. Categorical data were presented as number 
of cases (percentages). Differences between groups (ID, 
non-ID) were analyzed by Fisher’s exact tests for categorical 
data and by the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous data. 
Correlations between continuous variables were quantified 
using Spearman’s 
ρ 
correlation coefficient.
The impact of independent variables (ID, age, and 
BMI) on the dependent outcome measures (SCH and 
TAI) were explored by fitting logistic regression models. 
Similarly, potential confounding effects of age and BMI 
were explored by fitting multivariable regression models 
on log-transformed TSH values. All statistical tests were 
considered to be significant at P 
< 
0.05.
Results
Serum TSH levels and ferritin were inversely correlated 
(Spearman’s ρ 
= 
−0.076; P 
= 
0.001) and a positive correlation 
was obtained between FT4 and ferritin (Spearman’s 
ρ 
= 
0.112; P 
< 
0.001).
Figure 2 shows the graphical result of the univariable 
analysis, between log TSH as dependent and ferritin as 
independent variable.
Figure 3 shows the graphical result of the univariable 
analysis, between log FT4 as dependent and ferritin as 
independent variable.
In the whole study group, suppressed TSH levels were 
present in 58 women (3.1%) and the number of cases were 
comparable between the ID group (n 
= 
21, 3.1%) and the 
non-ID group (n 
= 
37, 3.0%).
Table 1 shows ferritin levels, thyroid parameters, and 
demographic characteristics in all patients and stratified 
according to their iron status.
Serum ferritin levels (median (min–max)) were, by 
definition, significantly lower in the ID group as compared

disorders during pregnancy
with the non-ID group (10 (1–14) vs 31 (15–335) µg/L; 
P 
< 
0.001). Serum TSH levels were significantly higher in 
the ID group as compared with the non-ID group (1.5 (0.0–
9.6) vs 1.3 (0.0–30.5) mIU/L; P 
= 
0.015) and FT4 levels were 
lower in the ID group as compared with the non-ID group 
(1.0 (0.7–2.2) vs 1.1 (0.6–3.1) ng/dL; P 
< 
0.001). Serum 
TPO-abs levels were comparable between both groups and 
this was also the case for the ages and BMI levels.
Table 2 shows the prevalence of SCH, TAI, women 
≥30 
years, and obesity in all patients and according to 
their iron status.
The prevalence of TAI and SCH was significantly 
higher in the group with ID as compared with that in the 
non-ID group (10% vs 6% and 20% vs 16%, P 
= 
0.011 and 
P 
= 
0.049 respectively). The prevalence of women ≥30 
years 
and obese women (BMI ≥30 kg/m²) was comparable 
between both study groups.

Iron deficiency and thyroid 
disorders during pregnancy
Thyroid autoimmunity as categorical outcome
Univariable analysis
ID was associated with an increased risk for the TAI (odds 
ratio (OR) 1.57 (95% CI: 1.11–2.21); P 
= 
0.009).
SCH was also significantly associated (OR 2.31 
(95% CI: 1.59–3.37); P < 0.001). No association with 
age ≥30 years (OR 1.39 (95% CI: 0.98–1.96); P = 0.060) 
or BMI (OR 0.77 (95% CI: 0.48–1.25); P = 0.305) was 
obtained.
Multivariable logistic regression analysis
After adjustment for confounding parameters in the final 
step forward logistic regression, ID remained associated 
with TAI (OR 1.52 (95% CI: 1.07–2.15); P 
= 
0.017). SCH 
(OR 2.32 (95% CI: 1.58–3.39); P 
< 
0.001) was also the 
independent variable associated with TAI.
When in the logistic multivariable analysis, age was 
added as a continuous variable, then it was associated 
with TAI (OR 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02–1.08); P 
< 
0.001). The 
associations with ID and SCH remained significant 
(data not shown).
Thyroid function (log TSH) as continuous outcome 
and subclinical thyroid dysfunction as categorical 
outcome
As continuous outcome (log TSH): univariable analysis
Ferritin (inverse relationship) was associated with serum 
TSH levels (P 
= 
0.027). Age (inverse relationship) and 
TAI were also independent variables associated with 
higher TSH values (P 
= 
0.026 and P 
= 
0.008 respectively). 
No association with BMI was obtained (P 
= 
0.841). For 
correlation coefficients, see Table 3.
Multivariable linear analysis
After adjustment for confounding parameters in the final 
step forward linear regression model, ferritin (inverse 
relationship) remained associated with serum TSH levels 
(P 
= 
0.035). Age (inverse relationship) and TAI were also 
independent variables associated with higher TSH values 
(P 
= 
0.029 and P 
= 
0.008 respectively). For correlation 
coefficients, see Table 3.
It should be mentioned that the R2 (0.0087) 
indicates that the model explains <1% of the variability 
in log TSH.
As categorical outcome (SCH): univariable analysis
ID was associated with a higher risk for SCH (OR 1.28 
(95% CI: 1.00–1.64); P 
= 
0.042). Also age ≥30 
years (OR 
0.75 (95% CI: 0.59–0.96; P 
= 
0.023) and TAI (OR 2.31 (95% 
CI: 1.59–3.37); P 
< 
0.001) were independently associated 
with a higher risk for SCH. No association with BMI was 
obtained (OR 0.91 (95% CI: 0.66–1.25; P 
= 
0.595).
Multivariable logistic regression analysis
After adjustment for confounding variables in the 
final step forward logistic regression, ID was no longer 
associated with a higher risk for SCH (OR 1.24 (95% CI: 
0.97–1.59); P 
= 
0.082). Age ≥30 
years was associated with a 
lower risk for the presence of SCH (OR 0.73 (95% CI: 0.58–
0.94; P 
= 
0.014) and especially the presence of TAI (OR 
2.32 (95% CI: 1.59–3.40); P 
< 
0.001) was an independent 
variable associated with a higher risk for SCH.
When in the logistic multivariable analysis, age was 
added as a continuous variable, the results did not change 
the significant associations as compared with that in 
case age was used as a categorical independent variable 
(>30 
years; data not shown).
Discussion
The prevalence of ID in our cohort of pregnant women 
was high, indicating that even in 2016 in a metropolitan 
area, it remains an important problem. The prevalence 
we observed was in line with that in most other studies, 
although in a recent Chinese study, a lower prevalence 
of ID (<10%) was noticed. This discrepancy may be 
explained by different socioeconomical states (most 
of our patients are non-employed), by the fact that we 
excluded patients taking iron supplements at the time of 
ferritin measurement and finally because we measured 
ferritin levels later in pregnancy as compared with the 
Chinese study, in which it was measured before the 12th 
week of pregnancy (12).
Most studies did not take women’s BMI into account; 
a variable known to be inversely related with ferritin 
levels and thus increasing the prevalence of ID (13). In 
our study, however, no correlation between BMI and 
ferritin levels was obtained and the prevalence of obesity 
was comparable between women with and without ID. 
Our observations were furthermore comparable to those 
of a recent study in pregnant women in the UK (14).

Clinical Study
F Veltri, S Decaillet and others
Iron deficiency and thyroid 
disorders during pregnancy
We are not aware of another study, showing an 
increased prevalence of TAI in women with ID, an 
association that remained significant after correction 
for confounding factors. Previous studies did not take 
TAI into account, or used it as an exclusion criterion to 
investigate the relationship between ferritin and thyroid 
function (11, 12). The importance of our results lays in 
the fact that the presence of TAI has been associated 
in both spontaneous and assisted pregnancies with 
impaired outcomes, including (recurrent) miscarriage, 
preterm delivery, low birth weight and postpartum 
thyroiditis (15, 16).
The 
pathophysiological 
mechanisms 
for 
our 
observations remain largely speculative. One seemingly 
obvious explanation could be the association between 
(low) iron levels and (lower) TPO activity, as it has been 
described earlier in an animal model (3). It then could 
be speculated that the lower TPO activity causes the 
increased prevalence of TAI in order to try to preserve its 
function, but that cannot be proven with the current study 
design. TPO is a heme-dependent protein and when its 
activity is lower due to ID, the iodine incorporation into 
thyroglobulin (Tg) and the coupling of iodotyrosines to 
form thyroid hormones is impaired, leading to lower FT4 
production and higher serum TSH levels (17, 18, 19). In 
our analysis, we also showed that SCH is an independent 
and significant risk factor for the development of TAI. 
These higher levels of TSH might increase the presentation 
of follicular antigens and therefore also the increased 
TPO-ab levels. Whether these antigens are then only TPO, 
Tg, or both is also a question, we cannot answer because 
Tg and Tg-abs were not measured. Indeed, in a study by 
Unuane et al., it has been shown that in the case of TAI 
(when using sensitive assays), the prevalence of Tg-abs is 
even higher in women of reproductive ages as compared 
with that of TPO-abs (20).
In women older than 30 
years, there was a trend to 
observe an increased risk for the development of TAI, 
in line with the known higher prevalence of TAI with 
increasing age (21). In our study, the median ages between 
women with and without ID were comparable and the 
oldest pregnant woman was 47 
year old.
An important observation was that after correction 
for TSH and age, ID remained associated with an increased 
prevalence of TAI and therefore, other mechanisms must 
have been involved explaining this association. ID also 
lowers the activity of other heme-containing enzymes, 
such as cytochrome oxidase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) 
(3), and therefore one might speculate that women with 
ID develop antibodies against MPO more easily, leading 
to a cross-reaction with TPO-abs and subsequently 
explaining the higher prevalence of TAI (22). In a more 
recent paper, the cross-reactivity hypothesis could 
however not be confirmed (23). Data on the prevalence 
of TAI in pregnant women after iodine fortification (like 
the fortification program in Denmark) taught us that the 
prevalence of TAI increased 10 
years later (24). In Belgium, 
however, attempts to increase the daily iodine intake are 
not opposed by the authorities and are still voluntary. 
Therefore, that hypothesis cannot be taken into account 
to explain the association of ID-TAI (25).
Finally, the presence of TAI goes far beyond the 
association with iron levels and that it has a complex 
immunopathogenesis, in which familial (genetic) and 
environmental factors play an important role (26).
The ID could also have been a consequence of the 
autoimmune thyroiditis. In a study a few years ago and 
recently confirmed by another group, concomitant 
autoimmune gastritis with TAI was present in 33% of 
patients (27, 28). Furthermore, it was shown in another 
study of patients with TAI that microcytic anemia was 
present in almost 20% of them, due to concomitant 
autoimmune gastritis and low ferritin levels (29). We did 
not measure other antibodies or included hemoglobin 
levels in our cohort of patients and can thus not draw 
conclusions on this issue. However, it is noteworthy that 
in the study by Zimmerman et al., anemia secondary 
to hypothyroidism was present in only 6% of their 
patients (11).
The other main observations in our cohort of 
women with ID were the increased serum TSH levels/
SCH prevalence and lower FT4 levels. This association 
remained significant after correction for confounders such 
as age and BMI and even for TPO-abs. Our findings were 
concordant with those in literature (9, 10, 11). Potential 
mechanisms have already been discussed above in relation 
to a lower TPO activity. Furthermore, it has been shown 
that in case of ID, the control of the CNS can be altered, 
the binding of T3 to hepatic nuclear receptors changed, 
oxygen transport altered, and finally the conversion from 
T4 to T3 can be impaired (3, 17, 18, 19).
In contrast with our findings, in a recent Chinese 
study no negative correlation between ID and serum TSH 
(12) was observed. According to the authors, this was 
due to the iodine sufficiency in the investigated region 
as compared with a mild iodine deficiency in the study 
by Zimmerman et al. (11). Also in our study, women had 
probably a mild iodine deficiency, as it was recorded in 
a survey performed in different obstetrical centers in the 
Brussels metropolitan area (including our center) (30).

Iron deficiency and thyroid 
disorders during pregnancy
Furthermore, the samples in the Chinese study were 
collected very early during pregnancy, when human 
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels were the highest 
and it was possible to dampen the serum TSH levels (31).
A recent study showed that women with both ID and 
anemia were at higher risk to develop increased serum 
TSH levels as compared with ID alone (10). In the study 
by Zimmerman et al., the prevalence of anemia in case 
of ID was low and it did not influence the prevalence of 
SCH (11). We did not include hemoglobin levels in our 
cohort of pregnant women.
Another hormone that plays an important role in 
the iron metabolism is hepcidin. This has recently been 
studied in relation to thyroid function (although outside 
pregnancy) and the authors found a positive correlation 
between both parameters (32). This might imply that SCH 
leads to higher levels of hepcidin, the latter then blocking 
iron absorption. Low iron, in case of pregnancy, probably 
also leads to changes in hepcidin levels, a hormone and 
thus by definition acting on different target cells in the 
body; but to our best knowledge, an impact of hepcidin 
on the thyroid has not yet been described. In clinical 
practice, studies investigating the relationship between 
hepcidin and thyroid function are progressing slowly, in 
part due to the imperfect and often expensive assays for 
its measurement.
The significant association between ID and SCH 
we obtained in the univariable analysis could not be 
confirmed in the logistic regression model, due to the 
important impact of TAI on thyroid function. This was 
an expected finding, since TAI is causing SCH in 90% of 
patients in iodine sufficient areas (33). Age was also an 
independent variable, negatively associated with the 
presence of SCH. The reason for this rather unexpected 
finding is probably due to the inclusion of patients with 
a suppressed serum TSH in the group of pregnant women 
without SCH. In a recent paper, specifically investigating 
the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in relation to 
women older than 30 
years, no effect was noticed (34). 
Another reason why the results of the univariable analysis 
could not be confirmed might have been due to the 
2.5 
mIU/L cut-off level we used to define SCH in the 
categorical model. We did not dispose of institutional 
trimester specific cut-off levels for TSH during pregnancy 
and according to recommendations of the Endocrine 
Society on thyroid screening during pregnancy; we 
decided to use the 2.5 
mIU/L TSH cut-off level (35).
Since TPO is a heme-dependent enzyme, the fact 
that iron supplements lead to an enhanced thyroid 
function and finally knowing that iodine supplements 
are more efficient when combined with iron, we believe 
that the relationship between iron and thyroid function 
exceeds that of an simple association and might be causal 
(4, 36). In daily practice, pregnant women often receive 
multivitamins of which some contain iron (18 
mg) and 
iodine (150 
µg). In this regard, it also deserves attention 
that preparations containing iron should be separated 
from LT4 intake by at least 4 
h in order to avoid LT4 
malabsorption (37). To date, no studies in pregnant 
women have been published providing evidence that 
multivitamin complexes ameliorate thyroid function. 
ID as such is a known risk factor to develop obstetrical 
complication and, according to our current findings, this 
harmful impact might thus in part have been mediated 
through the thyroid pathway (38). It has indeed been 
shown that even a slight increased serum TSH within 
the normal range is associated with an increased first 
trimester miscarriage rate (39). In order to answer the 
question whether ID, TAI, SCH or a combination hampers 
a normal pregnancy evolution, prospective randomized 
trials are largely needed.
Concerning the screening for thyroid disorders in 
pregnant women, it has recently been shown that in case 
of target screening, 33% of women with positive TPO-
abs would have been missed (40). In the ongoing debate 
between systematically versus targeted high-risk case 
screening, and when opting for the latter, based on our 
study findings, we believe that ID should be added as an 
additional risk factor in order to detect more women with 
TAI and thyroid dysfunction.
Our study is hampered by several limitations: we did not 
measure hemoglobin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), 
the iron saturation index, Tg-abs, antiparietal antibodies, 
the familial occurrence of TAI was not recorded and finally, 
thyroid function tests were not corrected for hCG levels at 
the time of the blood samples. Our work does not provide 
clinical variables like parity or previous miscarriages, which 
would have helped to understand the high prevalence of 
ID. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that our linear 
regression model only explains <1% of the variability in log 
TSH, relativizing our findings. However, does the impact of 
ID on the prevalence of TAI seem to be more important and 
since TAI increases the risk to develop thyroid dysfunction 
during pregnancy and the rate of pregnancy complications, 
the observations remain important.
It is obvious that further prospective studies are 
needed in order to investigate whether our data can be 
confirmed and to try to explain the association between 
ID, TAI, and thyroid dysfunction in more detail and 
especially in relation to the pregnancy outcome.

Iron deficiency and thyroid 
disorders during pregnancy
Conclusion
ID is frequent during the first trimester of pregnancy and 
is associated with a higher prevalence of TAI, increased 
TSH, and lower FT4 levels, independent of confounding 
factors. ID should be added to the risk factors associated 
with the development of TAI and dysfunction during 
pregnancy.
