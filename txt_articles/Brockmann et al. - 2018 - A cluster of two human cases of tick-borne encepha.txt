In May 2016, two cases of tick-borne encephalitis 
(TBE) were confirmed by serology (positive IgM and 
IgG antibodies against TBE virus (TBEV) in serum), 
with a possible link to raw milk and cheese from a 
goat farm in a region in Baden-Württemberg, Germany 
not previously known as TBE-endemic. The outbreak 
investigation identified 32 consumers of goat dairy 
products (29 consumers, one farm employee, two 
owners) of whom none had IgM antibodies against 
TBEV 3–8 weeks after consumption. Of the 27 notified 
TBE cases in the State, none reported consumption of 
raw goat milk or cheese from the suspected farm. Five 
of 22 cheese samples from 18 different batches were 
RT-qPCR-positive for TBEV -genome, and two of the 
five samples were confirmed by virus isolation, indi-
cating viability of TBEV in the cheese. Nine of the 45 
goats had neutralising TBEV antibodies, two of them 
with a high titre indicating recent infection. One of 
412 Ixodes ricinus was RT-qPCR-positive, and sequenc-
ing of the E gene from nucleic acid extracted from the 
tick confirmed TBEV. Phylogenetic analyses of tick and 
cheese isolates showed 100% amino acid homology in 
the E gene and a close relation to TBEV strains from 
Switzerland and Austria.
Introduction
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is caused by an RNA virus 
of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae [1]. There 
are at least three known subtypes and so far, only 
the European subtype has been detected in various 
central European countries (Austria, Czech Republic, 
France, Germany, Slovak Republic, Switzerland) in 
ticks, rodents and patients since the 1950s [2]. TBE 
virus (TBEV) circulates between ticks and natural hosts 
(small mammals) in geographically strictly limited nat-
ural foci. TBE in animals is not well understood yet and 
the knowledge on the pathogenesis of TBEV in domes-
tic animals is limited [3]. However, symptomatic infec-
tion has been reported in dogs, monkeys and horses, 
and seroconversion without specific neurological signs 
of TBE has been described in ruminants such as cattle, 
goats and sheep [4,5].
TBE in humans is the most important tick-borne viral 
disease in Europe and Asia, and up to 10,000 human 
cases are reported annually, although it is assumed 
that many mild and subclinical infections remain undi-
agnosed and both the infection and the disease are 
highly under-reported [6]. The main infection route of 
TBEV is by tick bite. However, food-borne transmission 
via untreated dairy products is a known way of trans-
mission of TBEV. Milk-borne transmission for instance 
was common in the Czech Republic in the 1950s, and 
the related disease was called ‘biphasic milk fever’ 
[7]. Since then, milk-borne TBE outbreaks have been 
reported in a number of central and eastern European 
countries [8-13]. One TBE outbreak caused by goat 
cheese happened in 2008 in a mountainous region in 
Austria [14].
In Germany, TBE has been a reportable disease since 
2001, with some 200 to 400 human cases reported 
 2
www.eurosurveillance.org
annually [15]. Most human cases in Germany appear 
in southern Germany, where the main known endemic 
areas are located. Only about half of the patients in 
Germany remember tick bites as the probable cause of 
the TBEV infection. However, so far, there has not been 
any evidence of milk-borne TBEV infection in Germany.
We investigated a cluster of two human TBE cases that 
occurred in the spring/summer of 2016 in southern 
Germany in consumers of raw goat milk and cheese 
from a goat farm. After the clinical diagnosis of menin-
goencephalitis and serological confirmation as TBE in 
both cases, the local public health office was informed 
and an outbreak investigation was initiated on 14 
June in order to identify the source of infection and 
the extent of the outbreak. The following points were 
addressed: identification of additional human cases, 
identification of the natural focus of TBEV on the goat 
farm, seroprevalence of anti-TBEV antibodies in goat 
sera on the farm and isolation and characterisation of 
TBEV from goat cheese and goat milk as well as ticks 
sampled around the farm.
Methods
Human infections
For active case finding among the consumers, informa-
tion and an alert were released on 20 June 2016 by the 
local government through the regional local print media 
and by the manufacturer for their clients. The local 
public health office offered serological testing against 
TBEV by the German TBE consultant laboratory to all 
consumers who could be retrospectively identified. A 
human case was defined as exhibiting positive results 
in IgM and IgG against TBEV in association with the 
consumption of goat milk or cheese from the affected 
goat 4 four weeks before to 4 weeks after the first case 
was diagnosed and having no vaccination against TBE 
within the 6 months before. To exclude false positive 
results caused by cross-reactivity to other flavivi-
ruses, all sera were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies 
against different flaviviruses (TBEV, West Nile virus, 
dengue virus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephali-
tis virus) using an indirect immunofluorescence assay 
(Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany), according to standard 
procedures. The consumers were asked for the date of 
the farm visit or cheese purchase, consumption date 
and total consumed amount, if available.
The regional physicians’ council was informed about 
suspected food-borne TBEV infections in the region. 
The Baden-Wuerttemberg State Health Office con-
tacted all local health offices in the State to re-inves-
tigate already notified TBE cases with date of onset 
of clinical symptoms in May and June 2016 (calendar 
week 17–25), with special regard to consumption of 
raw goat milk products in the outbreak region within 21 
days before disease onset.
Goat cheese
The responsible food safety authority sampled unpas-
teurised goat cheese from the manufacturing and 
storage facilities of the dairy farm (16 June), and con-
sumers provided available residual samples of cheese 
and milk produced between 5 May to 15 June by the 
goat farm. A 10% suspension in cell culture medium 
(Minimal Essential Medium, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, 
Germany) was prepared and centrifuged and the ‘milk 
serum’, the watery phase, was used for nucleic acid 
extraction and further analyses. PCR-positive cheese 
samples were suspended in cell culture medium and 
incubated on 80% confluent Vero cells and A549 cells 
according to standard procedures of the Bundeswehr 
Institute of Microbiology. The cell culture supernatants 
were harvested on day 7 after inoculation and nucleic 
acid was extracted using the viral RNA extraction kit 
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The extracted nucleic acids 
were tested by RT-qPCR according to a published pro-
tocol [16]. The E genes of TBEV were sequenced by 
Sanger sequencing as described in Kupca et al. [17].
Goat flock
All goats in the flock were born on the farm. According 
to the owner’s information, no external animals from

other farms had been added to the flock during the 
2 years before the incident. For analysis of the goats’ 
serostatus and to find infected goats, we took a blood 
sample from each animal in the goat flock and tested 
it by virus neutralisation test at the German Federal 
Institute of Animal Health (Friedrich Loeffler-Institute, 
Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany), using the low-path-
ogenic TBE group virus Langat virus according to stand-
ard procedures [18]. All sera were also tested for TBEV 
RNA by RT-qPCR [16] to demonstrate a potential acute 
viraemia in the animals.
Ticks and natural foci
Because the meadows the goats used for grazing dur-
ing the time before the outbreak (between April and 
May 2016) were documented by the farm owner, ticks 
were sampled around all suspected meadows between 
July and September 2016 by flagging along the veg-
etation. Ticks were identified and pooled according 
to stage and sex (three to 10 nymphs and two to five 
adult females or males per pool, all larvae in one 
pool). Pools were crushed using a MM400 mixer mill 
(Retsch, Germany) and three steel beads per pool, and 
nucleic acid was extracted using the EasyMag system 
(Biomerieux, Germany). Extracted nucleic acid was 
tested for TBEV RNA by a RT-qPCR [16].
Results
Human infections
The two cases who developed TBE after the consump-
tion of raw milk and cheese from the goat farm in May 
2016 were not vaccinated (Figure 1). The first case was 
a man who presented to hospital in May 2016 with 
fever, headache and difficulty to walk, 3 days after 
returning from a hiking holiday in south-west Germany 
with three other participants (one man, two women). 
They had visited a dairy farm where the first case and

one other member of the group consumed unpasteur-
ised goat milk and unpasteurised goat cheese. The 
second case was the other man from the same group 
who presented to hospital 4 days later with neurologi-
cal symptoms.
 
During the course of illness, both cases developed var-
ious neurological symptoms and suffered from severe 
fatigue and weight loss. Both were admitted to hospi-
tal and treated for meningoencephalitis with empiri-
cal antibiotic and anti-viral therapy. Other potential 
causes were excluded by a number of different blood 
tests, cerebrospinal fluid tests and magnetic reso-
nance imaging. TBEV serology was positive for IgM and 
IgG in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for both 
cases (day 14, day 24) (Figure 1). The clinical symptoms 
improved, but both continued to experience asthenia, 
neurological and psychiatric symptoms after 1 year. 
The final outcome is unfortunately unknown.
The two other hiking group members did not consume 
any milk and only one woman tried small amounts of 
the goat cheese but disgorged it immediately. None 
of the two women developed any neurological symp-
toms, nor IgM or IgG antibodies against TBEV. The farm 
owner reported more than 20 visitors/consumers on 
the assumed day of infection. Farm visitors consumed 
ca 20–30 glasses of raw milk and a much larger amount 
of cheese products. However, no further cases were 
reported from this potential exposure. After the second 
reported TBE case from the same family the district 
public health office started an investigation on day 
40 resulting in a stop of the farm’s dairy product sale 
and all dairy products still available were recalled on 
day 42 (Figure 1). On day 46, the goat cheese samples 
tested positive and after two tick sampling activities on 
days 75 and 85, a positive tick pool was detected by 
PCR in the samples from day 85 (Figure 1).
None of 29 other consumers in June who responded 
to the press release of the manufacturer and the local 
government on day 46 after start of symptoms of the 
first human case (Figure 1) nor the dairy worker showed 
IgM antibodies against TBEV 3–8 weeks after con-
sumption. Four consumers had low anti-TBEV IgG titres 
(without cross-reactions to other tested flaviviruses), 
which indicate either TBE vaccination or past infection.
The dairy worker had a high IgG titre but reported no 
TBE vaccination and no TBE-specific symptoms in the 
months before the event. The person remembered 
only a few tick bites in their life. As the dairy worker 
reported daily consumption of self-produced cheese 
but did not drink any goat milk, their serological 
result may be interpreted as a potential recent infec-
tion through cheese, although we cannot exclude an 
infection through ticks in the TBE focus area. The farm 
owner had been vaccinated against TBE early in the 
season 2016 and was therefore not tested. None of 
the 27 TBE cases notified until June 2016 in the State 
reported consumption of raw goat milk or cheese or 
a visit to the suspected farm; they were therefore not 
considered to be related to the outbreak.
Dairy products
We tested 22 cheese samples and one milk sample 
from 18 different batches (production days) in May and 
June 2016 for the presence of TBEV RNA. Five samples 
from five different batches of cheese (cream cheese, 
soft cheese and ripened cheese) produced between 8 
June and 12 June tested positive by repeated RT-qPCR. 
Two of the five samples could be confirmed by cell 
culture, indicating the viability of TBEV in the cheese 
(Table).
We retested by TBEV RT-qPCR the five PCR-positive 
cheese samples each divided into 10 portions of ca 1 g. 
Three and two portions from the two culture-confirmed 
samples were weakly positive, while the remaining 45 
samples were negative, indicating inhomogeneous dis-
tribution of virus in the cheese samples.
The five positive samples were inoculated in cell cul-
tures. Two of the samples yielded a virus isolate in Vero

and A549 cells. Sub-passages were performed and 
the E genes of the isolated virus strains were ampli-
fied and sequenced. Both isolates had 100% identi-
cal nucleotide sequences for the E genes. Using the 
maximum likelihood method, the closest phylogenetic 
relation was found to the E genes of a TBEV strain we 
isolated from a tick pool in 2015 in Pitztal, Austria, 
and to published sequences from different locations 
in Switzerland (Zofingen, Dagmarsellen, Brittnau, 
Lommis, Schattdorf) (Figure 2) [19].
Goat flock
Blood was taken from all 45 goats at the beginning of 
June 2016 and tested for TBE antibodies. The animals 
were 1–11 years-old. Nine goats had neutralising anti-
body titres > 15 against TBEV, which proved that these 
animals had been infected with TBEV in the past. Two 
of the tested goats had high neutralising antibody 
titres ≥ 120. None of the animals were viraemic at the 
time of testing as all RT-qPCR were conducted accord-
ing to the standard diagnostic procedures and results 
from all sera gave negative results.
Ticks and natural foci
A total of 424 ticks were collected in three sampling 
activities in July, August and September 2016 along 
the meadows and in a forest from the vegetation along 
the daily pathway of the goats from the meadows to 
the stables. All ticks were morphologically identified 
as Ixodes ricinus. The single larval pool (17 larvae), the 
33 nymphal pools (total 237 nymphs) and all 24 adult 
male pools (total 81 males) gave negative results in 
the TBEV RT-qPCR. One of 23 adult female pools (total 
89 female ticks), which was sampled on 22 July 2016 
and contained two adult females, was PCR-positive 
for TBEV. Testing the ticks from this pool individually, 
showed one adult female to be positive for TBE viral 
genome. An overall infection rate of 0.24% (1/424) was 
determined in the local tick population. A phylogenetic 
comparison of the E genes from the cheese isolates 
with the E gene sequence of the positive tick showed 
almost identical sequences. Only 2 of 1,433 nt were dif-
ferent and did not entail amino acid changes (Figure 2).
Discussion
Milk-borne TBE outbreaks have been reported since the 
1950s in Europe. Transmission of TBEV by milk of goats, 
sheep and cows is known and was observed in recent 
decades mainly in central and eastern European coun-
tries [7-14]. In Germany, food-borne transmission of 
TBEV has so far not been reported and is not regarded 
as epidemiologically important [20]. We report here the 
simultaneous occurrence of two cases of TBE transmit-
ted by raw goat milk or cheese in Germany. A specific 
goat farm in south-west Germany could be identified 
as the location of infection. Although tick bites as 
source of infection could not be excluded, none of the 
two cases reported any ticks or tick bites on the sus-
pected day of infection Furthermore, the probability 
of two concurrent TBE cases occurring during one stay 
in a TBE focus, assuming an average TBEV prevalence 
rate in ticks of 0.5%, is minimal.
This cluster of milk-borne TBEV outbreak in Germany 
had some unusual characteristics. None of more than 
20 other guests of the goat farm who were exposed 
on the same day to the same batches of cheese and 
milk presented any neurological symptoms resembling 
TBE. In all milk-borne outbreaks described so far, the 
manifestation index among exposed and infected per-
sons was high [8-14]. The infectious dose for infec-
tion of humans via the oral route by dairy products is 
unknown. One possible explanation could be that only 
small portions of the milk or cheese on the goat farm 
contained enough TBEV to cause human infection. Our 
RT-qPCR and isolation results led us to conclude that 
TBEV was inhomogeneously distributed in the goat 
cheese, which implies that the overall amount of virus 
in the investigated cheese was small, maybe at the 
lower range of the oral infectious dose for humans. As 
we have some indication of infectious raw milk and raw 
milk cheese from May (human cases) and June (cell-
culture positive cheese), it is noteworthy that no other 
human TBE cases could be linked to the consumption 
of the products.
It is known that low-pathogenic and non-pathogenic 
TBEV strains circulate in ticks in nature [21]. Therefore, 
the TBEV isolates from milk and ticks will offer a unique 
opportunity to study phenotypical and pathogenetic 
characteristics so as to find first evidence on whether 
passage through the goat and shedding by goat milk 
could change the genotype and pathogenicity of TBEV. 
Data on the pathogenesis of TBE in the gastrointesti-
nal tract are not yet available. It remains unclear where 
exactly the oral TBEV infection will take place, in the 
upper or lower gastrointestinal tract. In the latter case, 
it needs to be studied how TBEV survive the gastric 
passage with its acid environment.
Our interpretation of the serological results is that one 
or both goats with the high levels of neutralising TBEV 
antibodies may have been the source of the infections 
and might have shed TBEV with milk at the time of 
infection of the two cases. We do not have any data on 
the shedding of TBEV in different goat breeds. It is also 
unknown whether different TBEV strains exhibit dif-
ferent shedding rates in goats. One explanation of the 
low virus content in the milk products might be that the 
goat breed in question did not shed large amounts of 
TBEV in the milk or that the local TBEV strain might not 
replicate well in goats. We cannot exclude that one or 
more goats that were shedding virus were re-infected 
and therefore shedding only small amounts of TBEV in 
milk. So far, information is scarce on the duration of 
immunity in goats after TBEV infection, re-infection of 
previously infected animals and shedding under such 
circumstances, although one study has suggested 
immunity in goats after natural infection and vaccina-
tion [18]. Recent data demonstrated a decrease in anti-
bodies against TBE in experimentally infected goats 
 6
www.eurosurveillance.org
within 1 year [22]. Only systematic experimental infec-
tion of different goat breeds can test this hypothesis.
The detection of TBEV in a tick from the meadows of 
the farm demonstrates that TBEV circulated in ticks in 
the region in 2016. The serological data from the goats 
imply that some goats had been infected a longer time 
ago, while two goats with high anti-TBE antibody titres 
may have had a recent infection. The data suggest that 
TBEV infection in goats may occur and confirm earlier 
results from southern Germany [4].
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time 
that TBEV could be isolated from cheese of a naturally 
infected goat after a cluster of TBE with transmission 
through goat milk. It is so far unclear whether the pas-
sage through the goat and the shedding via milk may 
select for virus strains with changed pathogenicity by 
the oral route. Our isolates from cheese and from a 
tick will allow addressing this question by sequencing 
and analysis of the complete genome of the isolates in 
ongoing and future studies.
Phylogenetic analysis of the E gene of one of TBEV iso-
lates from goat cheese showed that the virus formed a 
genetic cluster with TBEV strains from different loca-
tions in Switzerland and Austria. This result may sup-
port the working hypothesis of discontinuous recent 
spread of TBEV over long distances, maybe by birds 
or by human activities (e.g. passive transport by pet 
animals).
During the 5 years before our cluster (2011–15), 608 
human TBE cases were notified in the State of Baden-
Württemberg. Only 11 cases were reported from the 
district where the goat milk transmission occurred 
(incidence < 1:100,000 population) and no cases were 
reported from the community to which the goat farm 
belongs. Ca 30–50% of all notified human TBE cases 
in Germany do not remember a tick bite before the dis-
ease. It has to be studied in more detail whether some 
of these cases may have been caused by food-borne 
transmission. We therefore recommend that public 
health officials and physicians consider this route of 
infection in the future.
Recent laboratory findings showed that TBEV may 
survive in processed milk within the food chain [23]. 
Therefore, the risk of contamination of raw milk prod-
ucts ready for consumption should be reassessed. 
Until then, consumer protection authorities should pro-
vide tailored messages to communicate the risk. This 
milk-borne TBE cluster in Germany shows the potential 
of TBEV spread and emergence also in a small local 
manufacturers even in countries with highly indus-
trialised food production and again illustrates our 
deficits in the knowledge of TBEV pathogenicity and 
eco-epidemiology.
