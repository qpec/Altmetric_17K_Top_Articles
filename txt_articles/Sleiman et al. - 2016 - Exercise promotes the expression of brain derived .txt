Abstract Exercise induces beneficial responses in the brain, which is accompanied by an
increase in BDNF, a trophic factor associated with cognitive improvement and the alleviation of
depression and anxiety. However, the exact mechanisms whereby physical exercise produces an
induction in brain Bdnf gene expression are not well understood. While pharmacological doses of
HDAC inhibitors exert positive effects on Bdnf gene transcription, the inhibitors represent small
molecules that do not occur in vivo. Here, we report that an endogenous molecule released after
exercise is capable of inducing key promoters of the Mus musculus Bdnf gene. The metabolite b-
hydroxybutyrate, which increases after prolonged exercise, induces the activities of Bdnf
promoters, particularly promoter I, which is activity-dependent. We have discovered that the action
of b-hydroxybutyrate is specifically upon HDAC2 and HDAC3, which act upon selective Bdnf
promoters. Moreover, the effects upon hippocampal Bdnf expression were observed after direct
ventricular application of b-hydroxybutyrate. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that b-
hydroxybutyrate causes an increase in neurotransmitter release, which is dependent upon the TrkB
receptor. These results reveal an endogenous mechanism to explain how physical exercise leads to
the induction of BDNF.

Introduction
It has been traditionally thought that physical activity and the processes of learning and memory for-
mation are independent and carried out by different organ systems. However, from an evolutionary
perspective, these processes needed to be tightly intertwined to ensure the survival of animal

 species. Indeed, physical effort usually occurred in response to an imminent danger. Responding to
that danger not only required running, but also necessitated better functioning of the brain through
increased plasticity in order to adapt to new sources of stress, to learn to avoid dangers or better
respond to them, and to map surroundings and learn the locations of hazards (Noakes and Sped-
ding, 2012) All of these responses require improved memory.
Physical exercise produces many benefits in the brain that enhance cognitive function, blood flow
and resistance to injury. One mechanism to account for the changes in brain plasticity is through the
action of growth factors (Cotman et al 2007). A major contributor to the processes of learning and
memory formation involves brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathways. It has been
known for over two decades that physical activity or neuronal activity markedly enhances Bdnf gene
expression in the brain (Isackson et al., 1991; Neeper et al., 1995) and that this increase in BDNF
protein leads to activation of signaling pathways that result in exercise-dependent enhanced learn-
ing and memory formation (Vaynman et al., 2004). Though these results are widely recognized, it is
important to note that very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that link exercise and
Bdnf expression. Regulation of Bdnf expression occurs by many means, but how exercise influences
the expression of trophic factors is not understood. In this paper, we are interested in understanding
how physical exercise induces Bdnf gene expression. This is a significant question, since cognitive
ability and synaptic plasticity are influenced by the levels of BDNF (Lu et al., 2013; Park and Poo,
2013; Vaynman et al., 2004) and BDNF signaling is reduced in many neurodegenerative and psychi-
atric diseases (Autry and Monteggia, 2012; Zuccato and Cattaneo, 2009).
During development, BDNF is required for the survival of specific neuronal populations and it par-
ticipates in axonal and dendritic growth and synaptogenesis (Alsina et al., 2001; Bibel and Barde,
2000). A number of studies have indicated that decreased levels of BDNF are associated with
depression and become enhanced following antidepressant treatment (Duman and Monteggia,
2006; Martinowich et al., 2007). Moreover, exercise frequently leads to an increase in BDNF in the
central nervous system to promote improvement in cognitive ability and depressive-like behavior
(Marais et al., 2009; Russo-Neustadt et al., 2000). Indeed, physical activity has been shown to
have anti-depressant effects and to improve outcomes in animal models and for patients with
eLife digest Exercise is not only good for our physical health but it benefits our mental health
and abilities too. Physical exercise can affect how much of certain proteins are made in the brain. In
particular, the levels of a protein called brain derived neurotrophic factor (or BDNF for short)
increase after exercise. BDNF has already been shown to enhance mental abilities at the same time
as acting against anxiety and depression in mice, and might act in similar way in humans.
Nevertheless, it is currently not clear how exercise increases the production of BDNF by cells in the
brain.
Sleiman et al. have now investigated this question by comparing mice that were allowed to use a
running wheel for 30 days with control mice that did not exercise. The comparison showed that the
exercising mice had higher levels of BDNF in their brains than the control mice, which confirms the
results of previous studies. Next, biochemical experiments showed that this change occurred when
enzymes known as histone deacetylases stopped inhibiting the production of BDNF. Therefore
Sleiman et al. hypothesised that exercise might produce a chemical that itself inhibits the histone
deacetylases.
Indeed, the exercising mice produced more of a molecule called b-hydroxybutyrate in their livers,
which travels through the blood into the brain where it could inhibit histone deacetylases. Further
experiments showed that injecting b-hydroxybutyrate directly into the brains of mice led to increase
in BDNF.
These new findings reveal with molecular detail one way in which exercise can affect the
expression of proteins in the brain. This new understanding may provide ideas for new therapies to
treat psychiatric diseases, such as depression, and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s
disease.

 neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease (Frazzitta et al., 2014) or Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (Smith et al., 2014). As a result, by understanding the molecular mechanisms by which exercise
induces Bdnf expression, we aim to harness the therapeutic potential of physical exercise and even-
tually identify novel therapeutic targets for both psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.

in

brain
regions
(Cotman et al., 2007), most prominently in the hippocampus. BDNF production provides trophic
support and increases in synaptogenesis and dendritic and axonal branching and spine turnover.
Blocking BDNF signaling attenuates the exercise-induced improvement of spatial learning tasks
(Vaynman
et al., 2004), as
well as the exercise-induced
expression of
synaptic proteins
(Vaynman et al., 2006). However, how BDNF is selectively increased after physical activity-depen-
dent changes in the nervous system is not well understood.
One mechanism that has been proposed is that exercise induces Bdnf expression through the
induction of expression of Fndc5 (Wrann et al., 2013), a PGC-1a-dependent myokine. This hypothe-
sis proposes that the FNDC5 protein is cleaved into a small circulating protein called irisin, which has
been associated with the browning of fat (Bostrom et al., 2012). However, there are contradictory
reports about whether Fndc5 is translated and expressed at high levels after exercise and whether
irisin is produced and found in blood (Albrecht et al., 2015; Jedrychowski et al., 2015). This raises
questions about how and whether a myokine can be responsible for the induction of Bdnf gene
regulation.
A second hypothesis is that exercise may induce BDNF levels by altering the epigenetic land-
marks of the Bdnf promoters (Guan et al., 2009; Koppel and Timmusk, 2013). Because exercise
induces metabolic changes and because epigenetics lies at the interfaces between the environment
and changes in gene expression, it is conceivable that an endogenous molecule is produced after
exercise, which can serve as a metabolite as well as a regulator of Bdnf transcription. In this paper,
we provide a mechanism demonstrating that exercise induces the accumulation of a ketone body
(D-b-hydroxybutyrate or DBHB) in the hippocampus, where it serves both as an energy source and
an inhibitor of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) to specifically induce BDNF expression.
Results
Exercise induces Bdnf expression in the hippocampus
To assess how exercise enhances Bdnf gene expression, we established a voluntary running protocol
for mice (4 weeks of age), which has been previously shown to mediate increases in BDNF
(Marlatt et al., 2012). Mice were individually housed in cages and divided into two groups: control
and exercise. Each mouse in the exercise group was provided with a running wheel, whereas the
control group mice were not. Mice were not forced to run on the wheels, but rather were allowed to
run voluntarily. Long term running for up to 30 days was monitored (Figure 1A) for distance and
time. We chose this exercise model because of its voluntary aspect. Stress has been reported to
decrease BDNF levels (Murakami et al., 2005). For that reason, we avoided any handling or stress
induction in the mice. Animals were sacrificed and tissues were collected for analysis. To determine
the effects of voluntary running in the hippocampus, we initially focused our study on selective pro-
moters from the Bdnf gene, which has a complex structure containing multiple promoters that gen-
erate many transcripts with a common coding exon (Pruunsild et al., 2011). Promoter I (pI), a
neuronal activity dependent promoter (Tabuchi et al., 2002) and other nearby promoters (pIIA, pIIB,
pIV) (Pruunsild et al., 2011), were also assessed for mRNA expression. Our results showed that vol-
untary exercise for 4 weeks significantly induced BDNF promoter I and II expression in the

after voluntary running showed a significant increase of mature BDNF protein levels, as compared to
control mice (Figure 1C and D).
Exercise induces changes in class I HDAC expression and binding to the
hippocampal Bdnf promoter
One epigenetic mechanism that has been proposed for inducing Bdnf gene expression is histone
acetylation (Koppel and Timmusk, 2013). A number of studies have reported that blocking HDACs
enhances memory formation and the expression of synaptic plasticity genes, such as Creb, Bdnf and
CamkII (Guan et al., 2009; Koppel and Timmusk, 2013). HDACs catalyze the deacetylation of histo-
nes and are divided into four classes. Class I (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC8), II and IV are
zinc dependent enzymes and are represented by at least 11 different proteins, whereas class III
includes the sirtuins (Haberland et al., 2009).
We have found that the general class I/IIb HDAC inhibitor, SAHA (vorinostat), a clinically
approved anticancer agent and memory enhancer (Guan et al., 2009) and TSA (trichostatin A), a
broad-spectrum inhibitor, were effective in inducing Bdnf mRNA in primary cortical neuron cultures
(Figure 2A). More specific HDAC inhibitors, such as CI-994 and MS-275, that target class I HDAC
members were also capable of elevating Bdnf transcripts (Figure 2B), whereas a non-active analog
of CI-994, BRD4097 (manuscript submitted), did not give a response. While these results implicate
class I HDAC inhibition in the regulation of synaptic plasticity genes, such as Bdnf, it is not clear how
exercise is translated into increases in BDNF. Interestingly, we found that exercise reduces Hdac2
and Hdac3 mRNA levels, but not Hdac1 levels in the hippocampus (Figure 3A). This is consistent
with the observation that HDAC2, but not HDAC1, is more important in binding to promoters of
activity-related genes (Guan et al., 2009). These results suggest that exercise may modulate Bdnf
gene expression in the hippocampus by inducing changes to the epigenetic landscape of its pro-
moter. To test this possibility, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and
showed that the binding of both HDAC2 and HDAC3 to the Bdnf promoter in hippocampi of exer-
cise animals was decreased, in comparison to sedentary animals (Figure 3B and data not shown).
Even though some variation was detected in the basal binding of HDAC3 to the Bdnf pI promoter,
the overall data is consistent with exercise inducing a significant decrease in HDAC3 binding to the
Bdnf promoter. As a result, these results focused our search for endogenous metabolites that are
produced in response to physical activity and that may also act as an epigenetic modulator.
Exercise induces DBHB levels in the hippocampus
Exercise is accompanied with increases in energy requirements leading to mitochondrial biogenesis,
as well as higher metabolism and oxygen consumption. For example, exercise is often associated
with increases in ketone body production. The ketone body D-b-hydroxybutyrate (DBHB) is a major
energy metabolite that is increased in the liver after prolonged exercise. DBHB levels are frequently
increased after caloric restriction, fasting and ketogenic diets and DBHB is believed to serve as a sig-
naling molecule in response to metabolic changes (Newman and Verdin, 2014). DBHB is synthe-
sized from acetyl-CoA generated from the b-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver. As DBHB
production is sensitive to environmental factors, nutritional states and energy levels, it has been
hypothesized that ketone bodies may serve as an intermediary to regulate gene expression and
chromatin structure. Interestingly, DBHB is transported in the blood stream to the brain where it can
serve as an energy source. In addition, DBHB also has been shown to act as a class I HDAC inhibitor
in non-neuronal tissues (Shimazu et al., 2013). To assess the effects of voluntary running, we mea-
sured DBHB levels in the hippocampus following exercise. We found that an increase in DBHB levels
occurred in mice after exercise, compared to mice not subjected to voluntary running (Figure 4A).

 DBHB induces BDNF expression
To evaluate if DBHB had an effect upon Bdnf expression, we treated cortical neurons, which repre-
sent an abundant source of activity-dependent BDNF. Overnight treatment with DBHB significantly
induced the coding and pI-driven Bdnf transcripts (Figure 4B), consistent with the effects of exer-
cise. Treatment of hippocampal slices with DBHB also gave similar results (Figure 4C). To test the
ability of DBHB to induce Bdnf in an in vivo setting, we administered exogenous DBHB intraventricu-
larly in mice. Gene expression analysis indicated an increase specifically in Bdnf promoter I activity in
the hippocampi of mice receiving the intraventricular injection of DBHB as compared to saline injec-
tions (Figure 4D).
DBHB induces BDNF expression through HDAC2/HDAC3 inhibition and
Histone H3 acetylation
One possible explanation for the effects of exercise is that it induces DBHB accumulation in the hip-
pocampus, which in turn inhibits class I HDACs such as HDAC2 and HDAC3 and leads to induction
of Bdnf expression. To determine whether DBHB induction of Bdnf represents an HDAC-dependent
mechanism, we tested whether DBHB treatment affected HDAC2 and HDAC3 occupancy at the
Bdnf promoters. We find that treatment of primary neurons with DBHB led to decreased HDAC2
and HDAC3 binding to the Bdnf promoters (Figure 5A). This was consistent with an increase in lev-
els of acetylated histone H3 after DBHB treatment (Figure 5B). Because DBHB is a potent inhibitor
of HDAC3 (Shimazu et al., 2013) and HDAC2 has been previously shown to repress BDNF gene
expression (Guan et al., 2009), we focused our attention on HDAC3. Inactivation of HDAC3 either
by treating cortical neurons with a HDAC3 selective HDAC inhibitor BRD3308 (Barton et al., 2014)
Wagner et al., 2016 (Figure 5C) or through knockdown using shRNA targeting HDAC3 (Figure 5D,
E,& F,E) both led to increases in Bdnf expression. Taken together, these results suggest that inhibi-
tion of HDAC2 and HDAC3 in the hippocampus induces Bdnf expression.
DBHB links exercise induced metabolic changes in the liver to changes
in gene expression in the hippocampus
While brain cells catabolize glucose for energy under normal physiological conditions, ketone bodies
are utilized when blood glucose levels decrease, as observed during exercise, fasting or caloric
restriction. In order to mimic the increases in DBHB in the brain observed after exercise, we injected
mice with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a structural analog of glucose that inhibits glycolysis and
increases the brain’s capacity to utilize ketone bodies as fuel. 2-DG is transported by glucose trans-
porters into the cell where it binds to, but cannot be phosphorylated by hexokinase, resulting in the
inhibition of the first step of glycolysis (Ralser et al., 2008). This inhibition leads to the activation of
a compensatory mechanism resulting in the production of ketone bodies by the liver. By activating
this alternative energy pathway, 2-DG treatment induces DBHB levels in the brain. Interestingly, we
found that 2-DG injection, like exercise, also induces both DBHB levels and Bdnf expression in the
hippocampus to a similar extent (Figure 6A and B). Interestingly, co treatments of a DBHB trans-
porter inhibitor (AR-C155858) with 2-DG attenuated the 2-DG-induced DBHB levels and Bdnf
expression. Hence, these findings are consistent with a model in which exercise induces DBHB

 accumulation in the hippocampus (Figure 6A and B). DBHB stimulates histone acetylation at the
Bdnf promoters through reduced HDAC2 and HDAC3 occupancy. This results in an increase in Bdnf
gene transcription which reflects an epigenetic mechanism after exercise.
DBHB induces neurotransmitter release in the hippocampus
To investigate the consequences of an increase of DBHB in the hippocampus, we conducted electro-
physiological measurements in hippocampal slices to evaluate DBHB’s effects on synaptic transmis-
sion. We incubated hippocampal slices with DBHB (0.8 mM) and then carried out field recording of
post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in CA1 evoked by stimulating the Schaffer collateral fibers
(Yano et al., 2006). Paired pulsed facilitation (PPF) was measured as the ratio of fEPSP slopes in
response to two stimuli delivered to the Schaffer collateral inputs. PPF was followed after interstimu-
lus intervals of 20–40 milliseconds. Incubation of hippocampal slices with DBHB (0.8 mM, 3 hrs)
increased the fEPSP slope which was blocked by K252a (200 nM). Consistent with these results,
DBHB decreased paired pulse ratio in a K252a-dependent manner suggesting a pre-synaptic modu-
lation mediated by TrKB signaling (Figure 7A and B). The actions of BDNF upon synaptic transmis-
sion are known to result in an increase in the frequency of synaptic currents, indicating a presynaptic
role of BDNF (Park and Poo, 2013). In fact, BDNF rapidly increases spontaneous neurotransmitter
release in hippocampal neurons (Jovanovic et al., 2000; Li et al., 1998b), which require TrkB recep-
tors localized at pre-synaptic sites (Li et al., 1998). These measurements indicated that DBHB treat-
ment enhanced glutamatergic transmission at CA3-CA1 synapses (Figure 7) and that this DBHB-
induced effect was blocked by K252a, a frequently used inhibitor of TrkB receptors in synaptic trans-
mission experiments (Chen et al., 2015; Li et al., 1998b; Takei et al., 1998). K-252a at 200 mM
concentration specifically inhibits Trk receptors and not other tyrosine kinase receptors (Berg et al.,
1992). Hence the presynaptic enhancement by DBHB is dependent upon the BDNF TrkB receptors.
These findings are consistent with an increase of BDNF by DBHB in the hippocampus and further-
more indicate there are additional physiological outcomes mediated by DBHB that involve an
increase in neurotransmitter release.
Discussion
These results provide a link between running exercise, the ketone body DBHB and Bdnf gene
expression. Previous work with DBHB showed it was an effective neuroprotective agent in Hunting-
ton’s disease (Lim et al., 2011) and Parkinson’s disease (Kashiwaya et al., 2000; Tieu et al., 2003),
affecting striatal and dopaminergic neurons, respectively. It is highly conceivable that DBHB might
act to increase the levels of BDNF, which can rescue neurons that are vulnerable in Huntington’s and
Parkinson’s disorders (Autry and Monteggia, 2012). Indeed, treatment of Alzheimer’s disease
3xTgAD mice with 2-DG to induce ketone bodies delayed the progression of bioenergetic deficits in
the brain and the associated b-amyloid burden. Similar to our experiments, 2-DG was capable of
inducing BDNF in 3xTgAD mice (Yao et al., 2011). Brain is a major source of the secretion of BDNF
after exercise (Rasmussen et al., 2009). Moreover, changes in the levels of BNDF have been sug-
gested in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, addiction and eating disorders (Autry and Monteg-
gia, 2012). A number of studies have shown that exercise can also improve depressive-like behavior
through increased levels of hippocampal BDNF, which can enhance plasticity and synaptogenesis
and reduce neurodegeneration (Aguiar et al., 2011; Cotman et al., 2007; Duman and Monteggia,
2006; Lu et al., 2013; Marais et al., 2009; Martinowich et al., 2007; Russo-Neustadt et al.,

 learning and memory, the ketone body DBHB serves as a metabolic signal to link environment
changes to epigenetic effects on the transcription of neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF.
Ketone bodies are widely distributed from the liver to the heart, muscle and the brain after fast-
ing, dieting and intense exercise. When glucose levels are reduced, ketone bodies, produced in the
liver from fatty acids in the form of DBHB and acetoacetate, serve as an energy source. In the brain,
the levels of ketone bodies can reach very high levels (1–5 mM) (Mitchell et al., 1995;
Robinson and Williamson, 1980). A number of studies have demonstrated neuroprotective effects
of ketone bodies in neurodegenerative and neuronal activity, such as under epileptic conditions
(Maalouf et al., 2009).
It is probable there are multiple mechanisms that are involved in the effects of exercise in increas-
ing trophic factor expression. For example, it has been reported that exercise induces Bdnf expres-
sion through the induction of hippocampal expression of Fndc5 (Wrann et al., 2013), a PGC-1a and
ERRa -dependent myokine. Once BDNF protein levels increase, TrkB signaling in turn inhibits Fndc5
expression in a negative feedback mechanism. We found prolonged exercise decreased Fndc5
expression levels consistent with elevated BDNF protein in the hippocampus (Wrann et al., 2013).
However, DBHB did not induce Pgc-1a, Fndc5, or Erra mRNA in primary neurons (data not shown),
suggesting that there are alternative ways of affecting BDNF levels. The complexity of the BDNF
gene and its alternative promoters and splicing events (Haberland et al., 2009) indicates that sev-
eral regulatory mechanisms must exist to explain its many functions in synaptic transmission and neu-
ronal survival (Park and Poo, 2013). Interestingly, exercise induces Bdnf expression in the
hippocampus and not in all the other regions of the brain. How this specificity is achieved is not
clear. One possible explanation suggests that exercise may regulate the levels or functions of ketone
body transporters in different regions of the brain. Indeed, acute exercise induces Mct2 transporter
expression in the hippocampus immediately after and up to 10 hr post-exercise. This exercise-
induced upregulation of Mct2 was associated with increases in BDNF and TrkB levels (Takimoto and
Hamada, 2014).
Our finding of an endogenous metabolite, DBHB, which upregulates Bdnf transcription in the hip-
pocampus, provides one explanation linking the effects of exercise and peripheral metabolism to
changes in epigenetic control and gene expression in the brain. There are multiple links between
metabolic changes resulting from exercise and epigenetic modulation. For example, it has been
reported that the blood levels of some Kreb’s cycle intermediates such as a-ketoglutarate are
increased after exercise (Leibowitz et al., 2012). Interestingly, a-ketoglutarate is an essential co-
substrate for jumanji histone demethylases as well as for the tet proteins (DNA demethylases).
Another molecule that may play a critical role in linking metabolic changes induced by exercise to
epigenetic modulation is acetyl CoA which serves as the source of the acetyl group for all acetylation
reactions catalyzed in the body including those catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases. Finally, coen-
zymes such as NAD+, or FAD produced during metabolic reactions are also required by sirtuins and
the histone demethylase LSD1, respectively.
In this paper, we provide evidence that an endogenous molecule, DBHB, that crosses the blood
brain barrier, is increased by physical exercise to enhance the expression of a fundamental trophic
factor in the brain and in turn affect synaptic transmission (Figure 8). Further studies aiming at iden-
tifying molecules that can also serve the dual purpose of an energy fuel and epigenetic modulator
will help us accumulate additional members of the “exercise pill”. The identification of these mole-
cules is of great interest as many people afflicted with depression or with neurodegenerative dis-
eases are likely to benefit from the ability of exercise to stimulate BDNF through small metabolites,
such as DBHB. The involvement of ketone bodies in many other syndromes, such as glucose utiliza-
tion, diabetes and epilepsy, suggests they represent vital molecules with broad metabolic effects
upon chromatin and gene expression.

 Figure 8. A proposed model by which exercise induces Bdnf expression in the hippocampus. Exercise induces
DBHB synthesis in the liver. DBHB is transported through the circulation to peripheral organ including the brain. In
the hippocampus, DBHB induces Bdnf expression through a mechanism involving HDAC inhibition. This induction
in turn mediates exercise’s positive effects on memory, cognition and synaptic transmission.

 Materials and methods
Exercise paradigm
Male mice were individually housed with food and water ad libitum, lights on: 6 AM and lights off 6
PM. They were divided into 2 groups (Control and Running, n = 10 each); Control mice and running
animals were housed with free access to a running wheel. Running distance and time were moni-
tored (Coulborn Instruments). Animals were sacrificed after 30 days and hippocampus and cortex
were collected and immediately frozen on dry ice. Animal care and use was in accordance with the
guidelines set by the National Institutes of Health and the New York State Department of Health
Cell culture
Immature primary cortical neurons were obtained from C57BL/6 mice [embryonic day 17 (E17)] as
previously described (Ratan et al., 1994). Mature cortical neurons were maintained in Neurobasal
media (Invitrogen) supplemented with MACS NeuroBrew- 21 (Miltenyi Biotec), and Glutamax
(Invitrogen).
Cell treatment
Primary neurons wereisolated as described above and 0.5 million cells were plated in six well plates.
On Day 6, cells were treated with different concentrations of DBHB overnight or HDAC inhibitors for
5 hr. DBHB was prepared as 1 M stock in PBS and used at a final concentration of 5 mM. suberoyla-
nilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), Acetyldinaline (CI-994), Entinostat (MS-275), BRD3308 and BRD4097
were prepared as 10 mM stocks in DMSO and used at a final concentration of 10 mM. Trichostatin A
(TSA) was prepared as a 670 mM stock and used at a final concentration of 0.67 mM.
RNA extraction and Real Time PCR
Total RNA was prepared from primary cortical neurons or hippocampi usingthe NucleoSpin RNA II
Kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time PCRs wereperformed using stan-
dard PCR protocol. Details of the Primers used are provided below:

DBHB measurement
DBHB levels were measured using a DBHB Assay kit (MAK041, Sigma) according to manufacturer’s
protocol.
Immunoblot analysis
To determine HDAC3, acetyl HISTONE H3, and HISTONE H3 protein levels, total cell proteins were
prepared by lysing cells in RIPA-B (1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl
and 1 mM EDTA) in the presence of protease inhibitors (Sigma), the proteasome inhibitor MG-132
(Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) followed by benzonase nuclease (Sigma) digestion for 15
min. Samples were boiled in Laemmlibuffer and electrophoresed under reducing conditions on
NuPAGE Novex 4–12% for Bis-Tris Gel polyacrylamidegels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to
a nitrocellulose membrane(Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. Nonspecific binding was inhibitedby incuba-
tion in Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences). Antibodies against HISTONE H3 (Cell signal-
ing) and acetylated HISTONE H3 (Millipore), HDAC3 (ab16047, Abcam) and b-ACTIN (AC-74;
Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted 1:1000, 1:1000, 1:1000; and 1:10,000, respectively, in odyssey blocking
buffer and the membranes were incubated overnight at 4˚C. Fluorophore-conjugated Odyssey

 IRDye-680 or IRDye-800 secondary antibody (LI-COR Biosciences) was used at 1:10,000 dilution fol-
lowed by incubation for 1 hr at room temperature. Finally, proteins were detected using an Odyssey
infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). To determine BDNF protein levels, total hippocampal
proteins were prepared by homogenizing tissues in RIPA-B in the presence of protease inhibitors,
the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and phosphatase inhibitors followed by benzonase nuclease
digestion for 15 min. Samples (100mg) were boiled in Laemmlibuffer and electrophoresed under
reducing conditions on NuPAGE� Novex 12% Bis-Tris Gel polyacrylamidegels. Proteins were trans-
ferred to a nitrocellulose membrane(Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. The membranes were washed twice
with 1X PBS followed by 30 min incubation with 2.5% glutaraldehyde/PBS. The membranes were
washed twice again with PBS and then with TBS-T. Nonspecific binding was inhibitedby incubation
in 5% milk/TBS-T followed by incubation with the BDNF antibody (N-20, Santa Cruz) for 2 hr at room
temperature. A peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti mouse was used for BDNF or actin
detection, respectively. The membranes were detected by chemiluminescence.
Hippocampal slices
Animal care and use was in accordance with the guidelines set by the National Institutes of Health
and the New York State Department of Health. 5-week old male mice were anesthetized and decapi-
tated. The brain was dissected and placed in 4˚C cutting buffer (126 mM sucrose, 5mM KCl, 2
CaCl2, 2 mM MgSO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, and 10 mM D-glucose, pH 7.4). The hip-
pocampus was dissected and submerged in ice-cold cutting buffer and cut horizontally into 300-mm
sections, which were immediately placed in recovery solution {50% cutting solution/ 50% artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF)} and oxygenated (95% CO2-5% O2) for 20 min. The slices were then trans-
ferred in to ACSF oxygenated chambers and treated with DBHB (0.8 mM concentration) for 3 hr
after which RNA was extracted for Real-Time RT PCR analysis.
Intraventricular delivery of DBHB
All surgeries were performed in accordance to IACUC rules. Mice were anesthetized under isoflur-
ane and placed on a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf instruments, CA). The body temperature of the
animals was maintained at 37˚C using a homeothermic blanket. DBHB (2 mM and 5 mM; 5 ml) was
delivered by a Hamilton syringe at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a nanomite syringe pump (Harvard
apparatus, MA). The stereotaxic coordinates relative to bregma were as follows: AP, -0.46 mm; L, -
1.20 mm; DV, 2.20 mm. (Paxinos and Watson, 1998). In sham control animals, 5 ml of saline (vehicle)
were infused. Proper post-operative care was taken until the animals recovered completely. Mice
were sacrificed after 6 hr following the injection and the different brain regions were dissected.
Hdac3 short hairpin RNA knockdown
Hdac3 (NM_010411)
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) clone (TRCN0000039391, 5’ CCGGGTGTTGAATATGTCAAGAGTTC
TCGAGAACTCTTGACATATTCAACACTTTTTG 30; Sigma) and Non-Target shRNA Control Vector
(Sigma) were introduced into immature primary cortical neurons (E17) using the Amaxa mouse Neu-
ron Nucleofector kit as directed by the manufacturer (Lonza). On Day 6, HDAC3 knockdown was
confirmed by Real-time RTPCR and whole-cell lysate Western blots.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
The Ez-Magna ChIP assay kit was used as directed by the manufacturer (Millipore). Briefly, primary
cortical cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde at 37˚C for 7 min. Cells were then sonicated
using the Bioruptor (Diagenode) and immunoprecipitated with primary antibodies (10 mg). The cross-
linking was reversed, and the DNA was isolated on the columns provided by the kit. Shearing size
was determined to be between 150 and 1000 bp. Real-time PCR was conducted with primers tar-
geted to the BDNF pI promoter (TGATCATCACTCACGACCACG and CAGCCTCTCTGAGCCAG
TTACG) and SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems). Each experiment was conducted at
least three times by crosslinking cells from different primary cortical neuron preparations.

 2- deoxy-d-glucose injections
mice received intraperitoneal injections of 10mg/Kg of 2-DG or saline. They were left to recover for
6 hrs after which the animals were sacrificed and the tissue was harvested.
Electrophysiology
2–4 months old C57BL6 male mice were anesthetized by pentobarbital anesthesia. After decapita-
tion, hippocampi were isolated in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the follow-
ing (in mM), NaCl (118), KCl (4.5), glucose (10), NaH2PO4 (1), CaCl2 (2) and MgCl2 (2) (aerated by
95%O2/5% CO2, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaHCO3). Hippocampal slices (300 mm) were prepared on
a vibratome (Campden Instruments) and maintained at room temperature for 1 hr in a brain slice
keeper. Brain slices were incubated in vehicle (0.00007% DMSO), K252a (200 nM), DBHB (0.8 mM)
or combination of K252a and DBHB for 3 hrs at room temperature before recording CA1 field excit-
atory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in a recording chamber perfused with ACSF at 32˚C. fEPSPs
were evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral fibers using a concentric bipolar electrode
(FHC). Input-output data were generated by plotting fEPSP slope in response to 100, 200, 300, 400
and 500 mA stimulation. Paired pulse ratio was measured as ratio of second fEPSP slope to first
EPSP slope at 20, 40, 80, 120 and 160 ms inter-stimulus interval. A response approximately 35% of
the maximum evoked response was used for studying paired pulse ratio. Data were acquired using
pCLAMP 10 program and MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Data analysis was carried
out using Clampfit program.
Statistical analysis
unpaired t-test, 1way or 2way ANOVA followed by the Dunnett or Bonferroni post tests respectively
were used to measure statistical significance. p<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
