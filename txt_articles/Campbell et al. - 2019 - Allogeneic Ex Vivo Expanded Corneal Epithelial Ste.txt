Allogeneic corneal epithelial stem cell transplantation • Limbal stem cell deficiency •
Ocular surface disorders
ABSTRACT
Limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) is a disease resulting from the loss or dysfunction of epithelial
stem cells, which seriously impairs sight. Autologous limbal stem cell transplantation is effective
in unilateral or partial bilateral disease but not applicable in total bilateral disease. An allogeneic
source of transplantable cells for use in total bilateral disease can be obtained from culture of
donated cadaveric corneal tissue. We performed a controlled multicenter study to examine the
feasibility, safety, and efficacy of allogeneic corneal epithelial stem cells in the treatment of bilat-
eral LSCD. Patients were randomized to receive corneal epithelial stem cells cultured on amniotic
membrane (AM): investigational medicinal product (IMP) or control AM only. Patients received
systemic immunosuppression. Primary endpoints were safety and visual acuity, secondary end-
point was change in composite ocular surface score (OSS). Sixteen patients were treated and
13 patients completed all assessments. Safety was demonstrated and 9/13 patients had improved
visual acuity scores at the end of the trial, with no significant differences between IMP and control
groups. Patients in the IMP arm demonstrated significant, sustained improvement in OSS,
whereas those in the control arm did not. Serum cytokine levels were measured during and after
the period of immune suppression and we identified strongly elevated levels of CXCL8 in the
serum of patients with aniridia, which persisted throughout the trial. This first randomized control
trial of allogeneic corneal epithelial stem cells in severe bilateral LSCD demonstrates the feasibility
and safety of this approach. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2019;8:323–331
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
This first randomized control trial of allogeneic corneal epithelial stem cells on amniotic membrane
in severe bilateral limbal stem cell deficiency demonstrates the feasibility and safety of this
approach. The fully controlled trial, including a control product and use of immune suppression in
both arms, allowed definitive measurement of the effects of the stem cell-containing-product.
There was evidence of sustained improvement in ocular surface score in the stem cell arm and
some evidence of improved visual acuity in both arms. Studies examining specific etiologies of LSCD
will further define the role of this technique in treating severe bilateral disease.
INTRODUCTION
The surface of the cornea is maintained by cor-
neal epithelial stem cells located in the transition
zone between the cornea and conjunctiva—the
limbus [1, 2]. Limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD)
is an irreversible disease resulting from the loss
or dysfunction of these epithelial stem cells. The
corneal epithelium becomes deficient and is
replaced by the surrounding conjunctival epithe-
lium, resulting in a thickened, irregular, unstable
epithelium, often with secondary neovasculariza-
tion, and inflammation [3]. LSCD causes severe
ocular surface disease (OSD) characterized by
reduced vision or blindness, chronic ocular irrita-
tion, and glare [3]. LSCD can be differentiated
into two etiological subcategories [4]. Category

 from chemical and thermal burns. Category 2—loss of limbal stem
cell function due to insufficient stromal support and includes aniri-
dia, multiple endocrine deficiency syndrome.
Standard corneal transplantation is not an effective treat-
ment for LSCD. Several case series have provided evidence
that grafting viable whole limbal tissue, either from the fellow
healthy eye [5] or donor eye [6], may replenish the host cor-
neal epithelium. Large autologous limbal grafts, however, may
compromise the healthy donor eye, whereas large allogeneic
donor grafts often fail despite immune suppression. Smaller
limbal tissue quantities can potentially reduce these limitations
and advances in tissue engineering techniques can provide
ex vivo expanded autologous or allogeneic corneal epithelium
[7–9] with a success rate of approximately 76% in LSCD [9].
Many studies have been published but these form discrete
data sets [10–20]. A recent review of the field indicates 9 pub-
lished uses of allogeneic donated material for treating LSCD in
approximately 80 patients [20]. However, this is not a coherent
body of data, with cadaveric and living related donors; differ-
ing culture methods; variable follow-up times, some of less
than 1 year; and great variability in success criteria. Critically
none of the allogeneic studies have contained a control arm
against which results can be compared. Frequently the studies
are single-center due to logistics of transporting clinical grade
ex vivo expanded corneal epithelial stem cells. Critically, it is
not clear whether the clinical outcome of LSC replacement is
independent of biological effect(s) of concomitant surgical
pannus excision, amniotic membrane (AM) resurfacing, and
immunosuppression. Therefore, our study aimed to address
the following. (a) Manufacture of allogeneic ex vivo expanded
corneal epithelial stem cells on AM at Good Manufacturing
Practice (GMP) standard. (b) A randomized controlled study to
investigate safety and efficacy of this investigational medicinal
product (IMP). The clinical trial was designed as a randomized,
controlled, and partially blinded phase I/II trial and hypothe-
sized that the use of AM, topical autologous serum eye drops
and systemic immunosuppression, may have therapeutic bene-
fit. By this highly controlled design it was anticipated that true
effects of stem cells in the IMP would be quantified.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial Ethics and Review Board Approval
The protocol was approved by SNBTS, and was reviewed and
approved by the Lothian Research Ethics Committee June
22, 2011 REC 14/ES/1008. The study was conducted in accor-
dance with the requirements of the International Conference
on Harmonization for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Tripartite
Guideline. The study was performed under a Medicines and
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency’s Clinical Trials Autho-
rization, Eudract Number 2010-024409-01.
The trial results are now in the public domain: https://www.
clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2010-024409-11/results
GMP Manufacturing of Corneal Epithelial Stem Cell
Product
All study materials were prepared in strict compliance with EU
GMP as defined in Directive 2003/94/EC under the SNBTS Manu-
facturer’s Authorization for Investigational Medicinal Products
(MIA [IMP], 3473).
Eye Tissue
Eyes were procured from deceased donors under appropriate
organ and tissue donation consent within 24 hours of death and
sent to either the Manchester or Bristol Eye Banks. All donors
were virology tested at the NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT)
National Transfusion Microbiology Reference Laboratory accord-
ing to the requirements of the Human Tissue (Quality and Safety
for Human Application) Regulations 2007.
Manufacture of the IMP and Control Product
Culture medium was High Glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium: Hams F12 at a 3:1 ratio (PAA, Pasching, Austria or Life Tech-
nologies, Paisley, UK), supplemented to a final concentration of 10%
human AB serum (SNBTS), 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Efcortesol, Sov-
ereign Medical, Basildon, UK), 0.13 IU/ml insulin (Humulin S: Lilly,
Basingstoke, UK), 1.4 ng/ml triiodo-L-thyronine (Goldshield Pharma-
ceuticals, Croydon, UK)—all clinical grade, plus 33 μg/ml adenine
(Sigma, Gillingham, UK) and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor
(Sigma).
The clinical grade AM was supplied frozen by NHSBT, thawed
and washed three times with saline and positioned onto an auto-
claved glass coverslip, following the method of Kolli et al. [11].
On receipt, the orientation of the cornea was not marked and as
such it was not possible to identify superior and inferior regions
of the limbus. Explants for culture were taken from adjacent
regions on the limbus. Corneal tissues were dissected into
explants, so that the dimensions of each explant was �1 mm by
�2–3 mm (with the longer dimension across the corneal/sclera
junction) such that clear corneal and white sclera could be
observed macroscopically on each explant and to ensure there
was an intact limbal zone centrally. A sample of corneal tissue
was also collected for DNA fingerprinting. Up to 5 pieces of dis-
sected limbal tissue, epithelial side up, were evenly distributed
over the prepared AM and 1.5 ml of prewarmed culture medium
was added to the composite graft. The culture was then incu-
bated at 37�C, 5% CO2 with media changes every 2–3 days for
12–19 days until the culture showed outgrowth from the limbal
explants measuring ≥200 mm2. Multiple cultures were generated
from each donated tissue.
Control and Distribution of IMP and Control Product
During process validation, test cultures were assessed for shelf
life as follows: at the end of the culture period when out-
growth had reached ≥200 mm2, the culture was fed with fresh
media (2.5 ml), then sealed with sanitized parafilm and the
shelf-life assessed by incubating the cultures at 18�C–24�C in a
Medibox Lite Portable transport container (Abacus Instruments
Ltd.) for 8 or 24 hours. Two of the cultures used for the
24 hours shelf-life assessment also included a period with
transport simulation (the culture was placed on a see-saw
rocker (Stuart) within a controlled temperature incubator
(RS Biotech 170R) for up to 9–10 hours). At the end of the
shelf-life period under assessment, outgrowth regions of each
culture (�3 mm × 4 mm) were dissected and fixed in 4%
formaldehyde
in
phosphate-buffered
saline
(PBS)
then
assessed for morphological integrity by H&E stain, expression
of the epithelial stem cell marker p63 (clone 4A4 recognizes all
isoforms of p63—TN and deltaN) and the corneal epithelial
marker cytokeratin 3 (CK3) by immunohistochemical analysis
as detailed below.

Allogeneic Limbal Stem Cell Therapy
 During the clinical trial, replicate (normally duplicate) com-
posite cultures were prepared. On the planned release day,
the culture to be transplanted was fed with 2.5 ml fresh
medium and dishes sealed for transport using sanitized paraf-
ilm. Unused replicate culture(s) were retained for QC analysis.
The released product was transferred to the operating theater
at 18�C–24�C in a Medibox Lite Portable transport container
(Abacus Instruments Ltd.) and retained until use. The culture
media was removed then the composite graft and was rinsed
with sterile balanced salt solution (Alcon) before transplan-
tation. Surgery was performed in Edinburgh, Glasgow, or
Liverpool at the institutions listed in the author addresses. Con-
trol product for transplantation was prepared as above, without
addition of limbal tissue and cultured for 10–14 days.
Quality Control of Product—Immunohistochemistry
The immunohistochemistry testing was performed as part of the
routine service provided by the Department of Pathology, Uni-
versity of Edinburgh. Briefly, QC samples were placed in 4%
formaldehyde in PBS. The samples were stained for the epithe-
lial stem cell marker p63 (clone 4A4 recognizes all isoforms of
p63—TN and deltaN—Abcam cat no. P3737) and the corneal
epithelial marker cytokeratin 3 (CK3) following the methods of
Kolli et al. [11] using an HRP polymer-based detection on Leica
Bond Max staining robots. Visualization was with DAB and
Hematoxylin counterstain. Staining levels were reported by an
independent pathologist.
Patient Cohort
Patient characteristics are detailed in Table 1.
Autologous Serum Eye Drops
Trial patients donated a unit of whole blood under SNBTS
Blood Establishment Authorization before commencement of
the study. Serum was collected by SNBTS Component Manufactur-
ing and preservative-free serum eye drops were manufactured
under NHSBT MHRA Specials license. Patients administered drops
to the affected eye daily as required throughout the trial and
compliance with the regimen was checked at each clinical visit.
Clinical Study Design
The study was a single-blind, randomized control clinical study
designed to treat 20 patients in 2 groups. Randomization method
is described in supplementary information. Patients were ran-
domized to receive either allogeneic corneal epithelial stem cells
on AM or AM only. Both groups were given autologous serum
eye drops and immunosuppressive medication. Inclusion and
exclusion criteria are detailed in Supporting Information S1. The
primary endpoint was feasibility and safety and the primary effi-
cacy variable was Best Corrected Visual Acuity. The secondary
efficacy variables were: Ocular Surface Score (OSS—see below)
and Quality of Life (QoL) as assessed by questionnaires VF14,
SF36 [21, 22]. Engraftment of donor cells was assessed by impres-
sion cytology and cytogenetics.
Patients were clinically assessed preoperatively and then
at days 1, 2–3, 7, and 14, and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and
18 months postoperatively with the following investigations
taken: full blood count, liver function tests, urea and electro-
lytes, serum for cytokine analysis, evaluation of corneal vascu-
larization, visual acuity (all time points). DNA fingerprinting of
corneal epithelium (duplicate cultures from manufacturing and
corneal impression samples), using the DNA fingerprinting method
described in references 12, 13, and QoL (VF14 and SF36) assess-
ments were carried out at 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively.
Treatment Administration and Surgical Technique
The surgical technique was discussed by the ophthalmic sur-
geons from the 3 research centers, to develop a consensus
describing the standard operating procedure between investi-
gators. All surgeons were experienced consultant corneal spe-
cialists and 4 consultant surgeons from the 3 centers were
involved in this study. Following a 360� conjunctival peritomy
approximately 2–3 mm behind the limbus, a superficial kera-
tectomy was undertaken to remove abnormal superficial tissue
over the cornea from the underlying corneal stroma. The com-
posite graft (or control product) was placed upon the exposed
corneal stroma with the epithelium facing upward. The graft
was sutured to the limbus, and any remnant material retained
for immunohistochemical analysis (IMP only). A second AM
was placed on top of the first graft and sutured peripherally to
the recessed conjunctival edges. A bandage contact lens was
then placed upon the ocular surface to help protect the trans-
planted tissue. All patients received perioperative subconjuncti-
val antimicrobial and steroid injections according to standard
of care.
Postoperative Treatment
All patients received postoperative topical dexamethasone (pf )
0.1% 2 hourly initially for 2 weeks, and then gradually tapered
(QDS for 1 month, TID for 1 month, BD for 1 month and then OD
thereafter. The steroids were used for a minimum of 6 months.

 In addition, patients utilized autologous serum eye drops for
12 weeks postoperatively. Systemic oral immunosuppression
was used as per the protocol for I year postsurgical treatment:
Prednisolone: initial dose of 60 mg daily tapering at 5 mg weekly
until 10 mg maintenance dosage plus Cyclosporine: initial dose
of 100 mg twice a day then tapered to 50 mg twice a day or
Mycophenolate mofetil at a dose between 750 mg and 1 g
twice a day.
Impression Sampling of Corneal Surface
Impression cytology to collect samples for DNA analysis was per-
formed using a Millipore filter paper applicator mounted on a
Goldmann tonometer holder (without prism) held against the
corneal surface for 2–3 seconds. Samples were collected at
6, 12, and 18 months postsurgery.
Safety Assessment
All adverse events (AE) were reported and recorded in accor-
dance with GCP requirements. Patients were monitored for
any AE during throughout the study. No AE were attributed to
the IMP/control products and no Serious Adverse Reactions
were noted throughout the trial.
Visual Acuity
Visual acuity was measured in the index eye using a Snellen
chart and a LogMAR score allocated as per Supporting Infor-
mation Table S1.
OSS
The validated scale described by Shigeru Kinosita’s group [23]
was adopted for the ocular surface scoring system. The ocular
surface was evaluated using a slit lamp giving consideration to a
number of parameters: corneal epithelium, conjunctivalization,
corneal neovascularization, corneal opacification and conjuncti-
val hyperemia each of which was scored on a scale of 0 (“nor-
mal”) to 3 (severe damage). A composite score out of 15 was
calculated. The key to the scoring system is given in Supporting
Information Table S2.
Measurement of Serum Cytokines
Serum cytokine levels were measured throughout the trial in
order to monitor the overall immune status of the patients
before, during and after the immune suppression treatment asso-
ciated with this investigation. Patient serum samples were col-
lected at regular intervals and stored at −80�C. Samples were
assayed for TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8), IL-12 and IFN-
γ using an eBioscience flow cytometry cytokine bead array kit
(ProcartaPlex Human) and a MACSQuant 10 instrument (Miltenyi
Biotec). Results were generated against recombinant kit standards
and compared against reported normal ranges for these
cytokines detailed in reference 24.
Statistical Analysis
Patients were grouped according to whether they had received
the IMP or control product. Mean changes in vision and combined
OSS were compared between the groups at baseline, 6, 12, and
18 months post-treatment. Statistical analysis was carried out
using unpaired t tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparison test, as appropriate, using
Prism 7 software (details in each section).
RESULTS
Product Manufacture and Quality Control
Definitive proof that implanted grafts all contained LSC is not
achievable, as any testing would be destructive. Analysis of
remnant material from the 9 transplanted IMPs, showed 5 had
cells positive for p63 and 7 had cells positive for CK3 (repre-
sentative staining Supporting Information Fig. S1). As this is
remnant material from the edge of the implanted graft, this is
not a definitive proof of LSC content, or lack thereof. Where
p63 positive cells were not detected in remnant material from
the transplanted product, p63+ cells could always be detected
in the duplicate culture, therefore adding weight to the con-
clusion that it is highly likely that all IMP grafts contained LSC.
Patient Recruitment
The study was closed at 32 months, due to slow recruitment. A
total of 30 patients were screened, with 6 deemed not suitable,
7 declined and the remaining 17 enrolled. A total of 16 out of
17 patients, all with total LSCD, were treated in this study. One
patient died of unrelated disease during the trial, and 3 patients
withdrew during the study, therefore 13 patients completed all
assessments as described in the protocol. Mean age of patients
in the IMP (44.3 � 13) and control (52.1 � 1.6) groups was not
significantly different (p = .246, unpaired t test).
Safety and Adverse Events
A total of 34 AE were recorded in total throughout the dura-
tion of the trial. Raised intraocular pressure was seen in
3 patients (2 from IMP arm and 1 from control). However,
these events could have been related to topical steroid use
postoperatively. Details of all AEs (serious and nonserious) are
described in Supporting Information.
Visual Acuity
The mean visual acuities in the IMP and control arms were not
significantly different at the start of the study (Fig. 1) but 5/8
Figure 1.
Mean � SD visual acuity scores in the investigational
medicinal product (IMP; black bars) and control (gray) groups pre-
treatment and at the 6, 12, and 18 month time points. There is a
trend toward reduction (improvement) in scores throughout the
study, but this does not reach significance, and there is no differ-
ence between the IMP or control groups. Two-way analysis of var-
iance, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. No error bar in “pre”
group for control product as all scores were 3 at start of study.

Allogeneic Limbal Stem Cell Therapy
 IMP patients finished the trial with improved visual acuity
scores—a mean improvement in LogMAR score of −0.957
compared with the start of the trial. Two patients received
cataract
operations
during
the
trial,
which
could
have
improved their score. The improvement in score from start of
trial to end did not reach statistical significance (p = .07) due
to the standard deviation and the small data set (Fig. 1).
Scores at 6 and 12 months compared with day 0 were also
improved but not significantly different (p = .42 and p = .16,
respectively).
In the control arm, 4/5 patients ended the trial with
improved visual acuity scores, mean improvement in LogMAR
score was −0.888. One patient in this group also underwent cata-
ract surgery. The improvement in score from start of trial to end
did not reach statistical significance (p = .22) due to the due to
standard deviation and the small data set (Fig. 1). The mean
improvement in visual acuity at 18 months between treatment
and control arms did not show a significant difference (p = .46
unpaired t test).
OSS
The starting mean combined ocular scores in the IMP (10.38)
and control groups (11) were not significantly different (p = .65
unpaired t test). In the IMP group, the OSS was significantly
improved by the 6 month point and remained significantly
improved when compared with the starting score at 12 and
18 months (p = .0043, p = .0018, p = .0002 at 6, 12, and
18 months, respectively (one-way ANOVA Tukey’s Multiple Com-
parisons test; Fig. 2A).
In the control group there was also an initial, significant
improvement in scores (p = .014) at 6 months, but the effect
was not sustained, and the improvement in scores returned to
non-significance by 12 and 18 months (p = .185 and p = .39,
respectively; all one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s Multiple Compari-
sons test; Fig. 2B).
All patients showed improved OSSs at conclusion of the
trial. Patients who received the IMP showed a significantly
higher mean improvement in combined OSSs than those who
received the control (p = .004 unpaired t test) at 18 months
Figure 2.

 post-transplant (Fig. 2C). Example images of eyes before treat-
ment and at the end of the study, having received control or
IMP are illustrated in Figure 2D.
DNA Analysis
Analysis of donors, and patient corneas prior to administration
of the IMP showed donor and patient DNA in all cases, respec-
tively, as expected. Analysis of cornea lifts from 6/7 evaluable
patients in the IMP arm at 6, 12, and 18 months showed
patient DNA but no evidence of donor DNA. One patient
showed evidence of mixed patient and donor DNA at the
6- and 12-month time points only.
White Blood Count and Cytokine Levels
White Blood Count (WBC) and cytokine levels were measured
throughout the trial in order to track the effects of immune
suppression, and its withdrawal, as well as measuring underly-
ing indicators of inflammatory disease in the patients.
Normal WBC levels were seen in 12/13 enrolled patients
throughout the study. The immunosuppression regimen therefore
had no gross effect on patient WBC throughout the study
(Supporting Information Fig. S2). One patient with chemical injury
had elevated WBC at presentation and throughout the clinical
study—this patient had ongoing ocular inflammation and had to
be withdrawn from the study for subsequent corneal transplant.
Serum Cytokines—At Enrolment
All patients gave samples for initial cytokine evaluation. An unex-
pected finding was that while 7 patients presented with serum
cytokines largely in the reported normal ranges, 8 patients pre-
sented with highly elevated serum levels of multiple cytokines.
[24]. Strikingly, all patients with largely normal cytokine levels
(designated “low cytokine group”) consisted of patients with
chemical burns and the one patient with autoimmune disease
(no patients with aniridia; Fig. 3A). Conversely, 8 patients pre-
sented with at least 3/4 cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-8/
CXCL8) higher than the reference ranges and this “high cytokine
group” contained all evaluable patients with aniridia, as well as
1 with chemical burn, and 1 with an autoimmune disease (pem-
phigus; Fig. 3B).
Serum Cytokines—During Clinical Trial
A complete set of serum samples were available to measure
cytokines from 7 patients at completion of the trial—3 from
the low group, and 4 from the high group.
All patients demonstrated normal levels of TNF-α during the
period of immune suppression. In the high cytokine group, ele-
vated levels of TNF-α were detected on withdrawal of immune
suppression at months 15 and 18 (Fig. 3B). This was not associ-
ated with a poor outcome, as all patients with elevated TNF-α
levels had improved visual acuity and OSSs at the end of the trial
(irrespective of receipt of IMP or control product).
In evaluable patients from the high cytokine group, the pre-
operative high levels of IL-8 remained consistently high through-
out the trial with no pattern of suppression toward the normal
range during the period of immune suppression, and after with-
drawal (Fig. 3B). Patients in the low cytokine group did exhibit a
transient increase in serum IL-8 levels at 12 months, but this

 quickly returned to the baseline levels thereafter. Again, high
IL-8 levels were not associated with poor outcomes, as all
patients had improved visual acuity and OSSs at the end of the
trial (irrespective of receipt of IMP or control product).
DISCUSSION
This is the first randomized controlled study to investigate
safety and efficacy of administering allogeneic deceased-donor
ex vivo expanded corneal epithelial stem cells in severe bilat-
eral OSD arising from LSCD. Our robust study design allowed
us to explore the specific benefits arising from the use of IMP.
In addition, we examined serum cytokine profiles in LSCD
patients which have not been previously reported.
IMP
The use of allogeneic deceased-donor limbal tissue introduces
variance due to donor age, time to procurement, transport
conditions, tissue processing and innate biological variability.
We were able to achieve adequate ex vivo outgrowth contain-
ing corneal epithelial stem cells from all but one of the dona-
tions we received. We chose to use AM as a matrix on which
to grow and transfer the cells, rendering this a composite tis-
sue engineered product. QC of such products is not achievable
without sacrificing some product. Therefore, we tested rem-
nant material from the transplanted composite product by
immunohistochemistry. The stem-like p63+ phenotype was
detected in the remnant material from 5 out of the 9 compos-
ite transplanted products. The absence of p63+ cells in 4 may
be because of the limited tissue availability and/or peripheral
nature of the area sampled. Where p63 positive cells were not
detected in remnant material from the transplanted product,
p63+ cells were detected in the duplicate culture, so we may
have a degree of confidence that the transplanted product did
contain LSCD. Kolli et al. [11] describe a gradation in the stem
cell marker p63 in these cultures, with colony formation high-
est proximate to the limbal explants and declining in the more
distal zones of the culture. Expression of CK3 (a marker of dif-
ferentiated corneal epithelium) showed the opposite grada-
tion. In the cultures used for the shelf-life validation, around
half of the products expressed The CK3 marker, whereas in
the transplanted products CK3+ cells were detected in 7 out
of 9 products (and in the duplicate cultures from the 2 clinical
cultures where CK3 was not detected). This indicates our prod-
uct was similar to that manufactured by Kolli et al. Variability
from product to product is likely a function of the original
donated cadaveric material, or the outgrowth region sampled
for immunohistochemistry analysis, as the GMP-compliant
manufacturing process is highly standardized. The IMP shelf-
life of 24 hours at 18�C–24�C allowed transportation of the
product to clinical centers such as Glasgow and Liverpool
from the manufacturing center (Edinburgh) within the vali-
dated timeframe.
Clinical Trial Outcomes
The IMP was demonstrated to be safe within the limits of the
study, with no serious adverse reactions or events attributed to
the IMP itself. The primary endpoint was improvement in visual
acuity, and there were indicators of transient improvement
throughout the study in both groups. These were not statistically
significant, but the majority of patients in both groups ended up
with an improved score at 18 months. The IMP group demon-
strated statistically significant and sustained improvement in OSS
over the period of the study. The control group also demon-
strated an initial improvement in OSS, but the effect was not sus-
tained, and the scores returned to near start levels by 18 months.
One patient with aniridia was particularly informative. They
entered the control arm and the OSS improved from 10 to 8 over
18 months. The patient was then readmitted to the study in
respect of his/her other eye and allocated to the IMP arm where
OSS improved from 9 to 3. This patient’s visual acuity also
improved from LogMAR 3 to 2 with control product and from
LogMAR 3 to 1.08 with IMP. It therefore may be asserted with a
degree of confidence that patients receiving the IMP did benefit
overall in terms of OSS improvement, meeting the principal sec-
ondary endpoint of the trial.
The clinical trial was designed as a randomized, controlled
and partially blinded phase I/II trial and hypothesized that the
use of AM, topical autologous serum eye drops and systemic
immunosuppression, may have therapeutic benefit. This clearly
is the case, as both IMP and control groups show initial
improvements in OSS—indeed this is statistically significantly
improved in both groups at 6 months. This is not sustained in
the control group, returning to be nonsignificantly different
from the starting scores, but is clearly sustained in the IMP group.
We may conclude that this study demonstrates a pro-regenerative
role for transplanted LSC in maintaining improved OSS for a signif-
icantly longer time post-transplant than control product. The
mechanism for this role is not associated with long-term donor
cell engraftment, as there is no sign of donor DNA in eyes of the
majority of patients at 6 months. This finding agrees with 2 ear-
lier studies, one which found no evidence of donor DNA in
7 patients 28 weeks postallografting [13], and one on small
patient numbers (albeit after longer follow-up) who found sus-
tained benefit in eyes receiving LSC, but with no evidence of
engrafted donor DNA [25]. There may be scope to reduce the
period of immune suppression in future trials if this is not
required to support long-term engrafted allogeneic cells.
In this study we were able to compare improvements in
VA between the IMP treatment and control groups, which is a
novel approach in this field. In other uncontrolled studies that
included allogeneic donor products (although some were from
related donors) successful improvement of any kind in VA at
the assessment point was seen in, for example, 5/7 patients
[26], 2/7 patients [27], 4/7 patients [28]. We saw overall VA
improvement in 5/8 IMP patients and 4/5 Control patients at
the end of our study. Although generalizations must be drawn
carefully between differing studies and protocols, the results
of our study has at least comparable outcomes in VA changes
to other studies, whether LSC are present or not. The magni-
tude of change is higher with the IMP but not significantly so,
this may well be a factor of the small patient numbers and will
require a larger trial to be investigated further.
It should also be noted that randomization led to a skew in
the number of patients with different etiologies completing the
IMP and control groups. Specifically, 4/8 patients in the IMP group
had aniridia compared with 1/5 in the control group. It is possible
that patients with aniridia respond better to the treatments.
Larger studies with aniridia patients using our IMP are warranted.
The majority of IMP group patients did not display sustained
engraftment of donor DNA suggesting that engraftment is

 transient, as described previously [13]. The benefits in OSS for the
IMP group were due to early effects of the stem cells. How these
observations relate to the mode of action is unclear. The IMP
could induce repair of the limbal niche or stimulate small numbers
of dormant residual host stem cells to multiply potentially through
a paracrine or chemotactic mechanism, however this remains
speculative and we believe that more research is required.
Inflammation and Underlying Condition
WBC levels were normal in all the evaluable patients except one
throughout the study, with no evidence of suppression-induced
leukopenia and no cytokine bounce-back at withdrawal. Normal
pretransplant TNF-α levels correlated with the WBC levels indicat-
ing no chronic inflammation. TNF-α was essentially absent during
immune suppression but did show elevation in a few patients on
tapering of immune suppression which may indicate responses to
cryptic infection, as been reported in other clinical situations
where immune competence is restored after a period of suppres-
sion [29]. IL-8 levels were consistently elevated in aniridia patients
at pretransplant, but not associated with abnormal WBC levels or
adverse performance after transplantation. IL-8 is associated with
inflammation and neovascularization and can be expressed by var-
ious stromal cell types. The nonhematopoetic origin of IL-8 is indi-
cated via continued high levels in some patients despite immune
suppression. IL-8 levels have been reported as elevated in tears in
aniridia and other eye disorders [30]. However, it is a normal com-
ponent of tears, and levels in eye disorder patients are approxi-
mately 2 times reported values in healthy donors, whereas the
levels detected here were 50–500 times normal blood values.
This is the first report to the best of our knowledge of chronic,
highly elevated serum IL-8/CXCL8 levels in aniridia.
There was no association with a negative treatment out-
come in patients with high IL-8 levels—all “high cytokine”
patients showed improved VA and OSS at the end of the trial.
However, there may be clinical implications of this finding sug-
gesting caution in using autologous serum eye drops in aniridia
as the highly elevated levels of proinflammatory/proangiogeneic
cytokines may exacerbate aniridia-related OSD. Although the
IMP can improve the ocular surface in aniridia, other ocular
comorbidities associated may limit longer-term benefit.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
This RCT demonstrates that sustained benefit is achieved by
the IMP in OSD compared with controls and this intervention
warrants further study in larger sample sizes in a phase III
study. New studies would also benefit from concentrating on a
single disease group in order to eliminate some of the vari-
ables in this study. Our findings in the subgroup with aniridia
suggests that elevated systemic cytokine levels may have clini-
cal relevance and dissecting both ocular and systemic inflam-
matory mechanisms in aniridia might shed new light on OSD
pathogenesis associated with this condition.
