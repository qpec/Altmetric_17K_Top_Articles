Active commuting and obesity in mid-life: cross-sectional, 
observational evidence from UK Biobank
Ellen Flint, Steven Cummins
Summary
Background Physical inactivity is a leading cause of obesity and premature mortality. We aimed to examine the relation 
between active commuting and obesity in mid-life using objectively measured anthropometric data from UK Biobank.
Methods Cross-sectional, observational data from UK Biobank were used. These were collected from individuals 
aged 40-69 years who visited 22 assessment centres across the UK between 2006 and 2010. Self-reported commuting 
method was operationalised into seven categories, ordered to refl
 ect typical levels of physical exertion. The outcomes 
assessed were BMI (based on objectively measured weight and height) and percentage body fat. Hypothesised 
confounders were income, area deprivation, urban or rural residence, education, alcohol intake, smoking, leisure 
physical activity, recreational walking, occupational physical activity, general health, and limiting illness or disability. 
We used sex-stratifi
 ed multivariate linear-regression models.
Findings Final complete case sample sizes were 72 999 men and 83 667 women for the BMI outcome and 
72 139 men and 82 788 women for the percentage body fat outcome. Active commuting was signifi
 cantly and 
independently associated with reduced BMI and percentage body fat for both sexes, with a graded pattern apparent 
across the seven commuting categories. In fully adjusted models, compared with their car-only counterparts, 
mixed public and active transport commuters had signifi
 cantly lower BMI (men: β coeffi
  cient –1·00 kg/m² [95% CI 
–1·14 to –0·87], p<0·0001; women: –0·67 kg/m² [–0·86 to –0·47], p<0·0001), as did cycling or cycling and walking 
commuters (men: –1·71 kg/m² [95% CI –1·86 to –1·56], p<0·0001; women: –1·65 kg/m² [–1·92 to –1·38], 
p<0·0001). Similarly, compared with car-only commuters, mixed public transport and active commuters had 
signifi
 cantly lower percentage body fat (men: –1·32% [95% CI –1·53 to –1·12], p<0·0001; women: –1·10% 
[–1·40 to –0·81], p<0·0001), as did cycling or cycling and walking commuters (men: –2·75% [95% CI 
–3·03 to –2·48], p<0·0001; women: –3·26% [–3·80 to –2·71], p<0·0001).
Interpretation This study is the fi
 rst to use UK Biobank data to address the topic of active commuting and obesity and 
shows robust, independent associations between active commuting and healthier bodyweight and composition. 
These fi
 ndings support the case for interventions to promote active travel as a population-level policy response for 
prevention of obesity in mid-life.

Introduction
Physical inactivity is one of the leading causes of 
morbidity and premature mortality.1,2 In England, two-
thirds of adults do not meet recommended levels of 
physical activity.3 The mass adoption of private motorised 
transport has contributed to declines in active travel 
worldwide. In England and Wales, 23·7 million 
individuals regularly commute to a workplace, 67% by 
car.4 Individuals who commute to work actively achieve 
higher levels of total physical activity than do car users, 
independent of leisure physical activity.5–8 Active 
commuting has been identifi
 ed by the UK National 
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (now National 
Institute of Health and Care Excellence) as a feasible way 
to increase population physical activity without requiring 
unacceptable fi
 nancial or time expenditure.9
Middle age is an important life-stage for the 
development of obesity. In the 2012 Health Survey for 
England, BMI was found to increase steadily into middle 
age, before declining beyond age 75 years.10 In the same 
survey, 44% of adults aged 55–64 years did not meet 
recommended physical activity levels.11 Using survey data 
from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, Laverty and 
colleagues12 
reported 
that 
after 
adjustment 
for 
socioeconomic and demographic factors, compared with 
16–29 year olds, adults aged 50–65 years were 55% less 
likely to commute by public transport, 45% less likely to 
commute on foot, and 30% less likely to commute by 
bicycle.
Previous research has shown that, compared with car 
commuters, walkers and cyclists have lower BMI,12–15 
lower percentage body fat,13 and lower waist circum-
ference.15 Walkers and cyclists are less likely to report 
diagnoses of diabetes and hypertension,13–15 and report 
higher levels of physical wellbeing than do car com-
muters.16 Compared with continued car use, switching 
from sedentary to active commuting w 
as found to predict 
a decrease in self-reported BMI.17 However, many 
individuals live too far from their workplace for walking 
or cycling to be feasible. Cross-sectional studies have

shown that individuals who commute by public transport 
have signifi
 cantly lower BMI, percentage body fat, and 
self-reported diagnoses with diabetes and hypertension, 
and that associations are similar in size to those seen for 
walking and cycling.12,13 This fi
 nding suggests that 
incidental physical activity involved in public transport 
journeys has an important role. Increasing evidence 
consistently suggests that mass transit contributes to 
overall physical activity18,19 and is negatively associated 
with obesity. 20,21
However, important gaps in the scientifi
 c literature 
remain. First, it is unclear whether active commuting has 
a graded relationship with obesity. Operationalising the 
exposure using multiple mixed-mode categories provides 
better observational evidence of causality, but existing 
studies 
are 
hampered 
by 
inadequately 
detailed 
measurement. Second, the use of objectively measured 
obesity is important to reduce the bias associated with self-
reporting. A third common limitation of the use of 
secondary datasets to investigate active commuting and 
bodyweight is the failure to rule out confounding by 
energy intake. The extent to which associations between 
active commuting and obesity are moderated by demo-
graphic and socioeconomic factors is also underexplored 
in the existing scientifi
 c literature.
This study is the fi
 rst to use data from UK Biobank22,23 
to investigate the relation between active commuting and 
obesity. A large and comprehensive dataset, UK Biobank 
off
 ers the opportunity to address key limitations in the 
existing literature. The aim of this study is to investigate 
the relation between active commuting and objectively 
measured indicators of obesity in a middle-aged UK 
population sample. Our hypotheses are that an 
independent association exists between commuting 
mode and two measures of obesity (BMI and percentage 
body fat); adjustment for socioeconomic, demographic, 
health, and occupational and leisure factors will not fully 
attenuate the central association; dietary energy intake 
will have a small but signifi
 cant confounding eff
 ect; 
among walkers and cyclists, distance of commute will be 
independently, inversely associated with BMI and 
percentage body fat.
Methods
Study design and data collection
We used baseline data from UK Biobank (project 5935) to 
do a cross-sectional, observational study to assess the 
relation between commuting method and mid-life 
obesity. Data were collected from 502 656 individuals 
aged 40–69 years who visited 22 assessment centres 
across the UK between 2006 and 2010. Respondents were 
selected through National Health Service (NHS) patient 
registers based on distance from their nearest UK 
Biobank assessment centre. The scientifi
 c rationale, 
study design, ethical approval, survey methods, and 
limitations are reported elsewhere.22,23 UK Biobank has 
ethical approval from the North West Multi-centre 
Research Ethics Committee (MREC), the Patient 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Previous studies have found evidence of an association 
between active commuting and a range of obesity-related and 
cardiovascular disease-related health outcomes in the UK. 
Walking, cycling, and taking public transport to work have been 
shown to predict self-reported and objectively measured BMI, 
objectively measured percentage body fat, self-reported 
doctor-diagnosed diabetes, and self-reported hypertension. 
However, previous studies have been hampered by 
insuffi
  ciently detailed information about method of 
commuting exposures (making it largely impossible to capture 
mixed-mode journeys, for example), self-reported outcome 
measures, limited scope to control for confounding by health 
behaviours especially diet, and small sample sizes for 
meaningful subgroup analyses.
Added value of this study
This study is the fi
 rst to use UK Biobank data to investigate the 
relation between commuting behaviour and BMI, based on 
objectively measured bodyweight and height; and body fat. UK 
Biobank is a large, observational study of middle-aged 
individuals in the UK. This dataset off
 ers the opportunity to do a 
defi
 nitive cross-sectional, observational investigation into the 
relation between active commuting and obesity in terms of 
sample size, gradation of exposure, robust biological measures, 
and use of a wide range of covariates. The age span of the 
participants covers a key life-stage for the development of 
physical inactivity, obesity, and related cardiovascular risk. UK 
Biobank allows a substantially more detailed and fi
 ne-grained 
categorisation of method of commute exposure by allowing 
the derivation of mixed-mode categories. This study also uses 
objectively measured height, bodyweight, and percentage body 
fat, so is not subject to bias introduced when respondents are 
asked to report their own measurements. The comprehensive 
range of socioeconomic, demographic, behavioural, 
occupational, and health data available in UK Biobank allowed 
us to do comprehensive adjustment for confounding. 
Additionally, we were able to further isolate independent 
associations between active commuting and obesity in 
sensitivity analyses controlling for dietary energy intake. To our 
knowledge, this is the fi
 rst study of active commuting and 
obesity to incorporate this dimension.
Implications of all the available evidence
The results of this study add to the growing evidence 
suggesting that the promotion and facilitation of active 
commuting should form part of the policy response for 
population-level obesity prevention.

Information Advisory Group (PIAG), and the Community 
Health Index Advisory Group (CHIAG).
Participants who did not report commuting behaviour 
(largely because of retirement) were excluded, yielding an 
initial sample size of 264 341. This number was further 
restricted to participants who had complete data on all 
analytical covariates (n=156 994). Of these, 439 had 
missing data for BMI and 2067 had missing data for 
percentage body fat. We therefore derived two main 
analytical samples: 156 555 participants for BMI 
(72 888 men and 83 667 women); and 154 927 participants 
for percentage body fat (72 139 men and 82 788 women). 
We also did two sets of sensitivity analyses. In the fi
 rst, to 
investigate confounding by dietary energy intake, we 
used a subsample with complete data for energy intake 
and all analytical variables, with 75 229 participants in the 
BMI diet subsample and 74 430 participants in the 
percentage body fat diet subsample. In the second 
sensitivity analysis, to investigate the role of commute 
distance, we selected only the walking commuters 
(7746 participants for BMI and 7660 participants for 
percentage 
body 
fat) 
and 
cycling 
commuters 
(4195 participants for BMI and 4146 participants for 
percentage body fat) with complete data on all analytic 
variables.
Procedures
Participants were asked “what types of transport do you 
use to get to and from work?” and were able to select one 
or more of the following: car or motor vehicle, walk, 
public transport, or cycle. To capitalise on this rich data, a 
15-category commute mode variable was derived, 
encapsulating all mode combinations. This was then 
collapsed to create a seven-category primary exposure 
variable, ordered to approximate typical levels of physical 
exertion: car only, car and public transport, public 
transport only, car and other mixed methods (a 
heterogeneous category consisting of combinations of 
car, public transport, walking, and cycling), public 
transport and active transport (walking, cycling, or both), 
walking only, and cycling only or cycling and walking. In 
sensitivity analyses of participants who commuted by 
walking or cycling, self-reported one-way commute 
distance (miles) was conceptualised as an exposure 
variable. For the walking subsample, distance was 
divided as an ordered categorical variable (<1 mile, 1 mile, 
2 miles, 3 miles, or ≥4 miles). For the cycling subsample, 
it was categorised as 0–1 miles, 2–4 miles, 5–7 miles, 
8–10 miles, or ≥11 miles.
Outcomes
Anthropometric measurements were made by trained 
staff
  using standard procedures detailed elsewhere.22 For 
the purposes of this study, measurements of interest 
were height and weight (for BMI calculation), and per-
centage body fat (measured by bioimpedance). Standing 
height was measured with the Seca 202 stadiometer 
(Seca, Birmingham, UK). Percentage body fat and weight 
were measured with the Tanita BC418MA body 
composition 
analyser 
(Tanita, 
Amsterdam, 
the 
Netherlands).24 Both were normally distributed and 
divided as continuous variables.
Covariates
Various factors were hypothesised to confound the 
association between active commuting and obesity. 
These were mostly self-reported, with the exception of 
residential area classifi
 cation, Townsend deprivation 
score (census data), and energy intake (24-h dietary recall 
questionnaire).25,26 Demographic covariates were age 
(years), sex, ethnic origin (white British, Irish or other 
white background, South Asian, Black Caribbean, Black 
African, Chinese, mixed, or other), and residential area 
classifi
 cation (urban, urban–rural fringe, or rural). 
Socioeconomic covariates were gross annual household 
income (<£18 000, £18 000–£30 999, £31 000–£51 000, 
£52 000–£100 000, or >£100 000); Townsend deprivation 
index at the residential output area level (quintiles); 
highest educational qualifi
 cation (university or college 
degree; A levels or equivalent (academic advanced-levels, 
post compulsory education); GCSEs or equivalent 
(academic General Certifi
 cate of Secondary Education, 
formerly Ordinary Levels, taken at age 15–16 years and 
the end of compulsory education); CSEs or equivalent 
(vocational Certifi
 cate of Secondary Education, formerly 
taken at age 15–16 years); NVQ, HND, HNC, or 
equivalent (National Vocational Qualifi
 cations, Higher 
National 
Diploma, 
Higher 
National 
Certifi
 cate: 
intermediate semi-vocational qualifi
 cations); professional 
quali 
fi
 cations; or none. Health behaviour covariates were 
alcohol intake (daily or almost daily, 3–4 times per week, 
1–2 per week, 1–3 per month, special occasions only, or 
never); and smoking (never, previous, or current). 
Physical activity covariates were days per week ≥10 min 
moderate physical activity (0–7); walking for pleasure in 
the past 4 weeks (once, 2–3 times, once per week, 2–3 per 
week, 4–5 per week, or daily); typical transport mode for 
non-commuting travel (walking, cycling, or both: yes or 
no); job involves standing or walking (never or rarely, 
sometimes, usually, or always); manual work (never or 
rarely, sometimes, usually, or always); and shift work 
(never or rarely, sometimes, usually, or always). Health 
covariates were poor self-rated health (yes or no); long-
standing limiting illness or disability (yes or no). Total 
energy intake (kcal) in previous 24 h was used in 
sensitivity analyses. The diet recall questionnaire module 
was added to the assessment centre towards the end of 
the baseline data collection phase. Subsequently, 
participants were contacted via email and completed up 
to fi
 ve questionnaires online at diff
 erent times.25,26 Energy 
intake was treated as a continuous variable, truncated at 
6000 kcal/day. For respondents who participated in more 
than one 24-h diet recall questionnaire, the median value 
was used.

Statistical analysis
To investigate the relation between method of commuting 
and BMI and percentage body fat, we did nested, sex-
stratifi
 ed, multivariate linear-regression analysis using 
Stata (version 14).27 For each outcome, the following model 
series was fi
 tted for men and women separately. In 
Model 0, we tested the bivariate association between the 
method of commuting and the outcome. In Model 1, we 
introduced demographic, socio 
economic, and other factors 
(urban or rural residence, age, ethnic origin, income, 
Townsend deprivation quintiles, and highest educational 
quali 
fi
 cation). Model 1 was then nested within Model 2, in 
which we introduced the other hypothesised con 
founders: 
alcohol intake, smoking status, leisure physical activity, 
non-work active travel, walking for pleasure, occupational 
physical activity, shift work, manual work, self-rated health, 
and longstanding limiting illness or disability. Models 
were adjusted for clustering by assessment centre. 
Interactions by sex, ethnic origin, and household income 
category were investigated with Wald tests. Sensitivity 
analysis was done with dietary recall data to test the third 
study hypothesis, that energy intake may confound the 
association between commuting mode and BMI and 
percentage body fat. The sex-stratifi
 ed multivariate linear-
regression modelling strategy above was replicated with 
the subsample of participants with valid energy intake 
data, adding 24-h energy intake (kcal) as a covariate. To 
investigate the fourth hypothesis, that distance of commute 
is independently, inversely associated with BMI and 
percentage body fat among walkers and cyclists, sensitivity 
analyses were done with separate subsamples of walking 
commuters and cycling commuters with complete data. 
For each subsample, a bivariate (Model 0) and multivariate 
linear (Model 2) regression model was fi
 tted for each 
outcome (BMI and percentage body fat), using commute 
distance as the exposure of interest.
Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design,

the data in the study and had fi

decision to submit for publication.
Results
The most prevalent method of commuting was car travel 
(64% of men and 61% of women; table 1). 4% of men and 
7% of women reported walking as their only method of 
commute, and a further 4% of men and 2% of women 
reported cycling only or a mix of cycling and walking. 
Overall, 23% of men and 24% of women used active 
transport either solely or as a component within a mix of 
methods. The percentage body fat analytical sample was 
representative of the BMI analytical sample on key 
variables. A signifi
 cant interaction was found for sex, so all 
analyses were stratifi
 ed by sex. No signifi
 cant interactions 
were found for ethnic origin or household income category.
Across all models, a signifi
 cant association between 
method of commuting and obesity was observed, with a 
graded relation apparent across the seven ordered 
commuting categories (tables 2–5, fi
 gures 1 and 2). With 
the exception of mixed car and public transport, all 
categories independently predicted signi 
fi
 cantly lower 
BMI and percentage body fat when compared with car 
use only. In analyses of both BMI and percentage body 
fat, adjustment for hypothesised confounding factors 
attenuated the bivariate associations to some extent, but 
a signifi
 cant association remained evident in the fully 
adjusted models for both men and women. These 
fi
 ndings supported the study hypotheses.
For men and women, across BMI and percentage body 
fat analyses, the largest and most signifi
 cant results were 
seen for cyclists. In fully adjusted models, compared 
with male car-only commuters, male cyclists had a BMI 
1·71 kg/m² lower (95% CI –1·86 to –1·56), after 
adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, health, and 
behavioural factors, and non-commute physical activity. 
In fully adjusted models, female cyclists had a BMI 
1·65 kg/m² lower on average than their car-only 
counterparts (95% CI –1·92 to –1·38), and had 3·26% 
lower percentage body fat (95% CI –3·80 to –2·71).
In fully adjusted models, men who used only public 
transport had a BMI 0·70 kg/m² lower than car-only 
commuters (95% CI –0·83 to –0·57), whereas men who 
combined car use with active methods had a BMI 
0·56 kg/m² lower (95% CI –0·68 to –0·45). Greater 
associations were seen for men who combined public 
transport with active methods: compared with car-only 
commuters, these individuals had a BMI 1·00 kg/m² 
lower (95% CI –1·14 to –0·87) in the fully adjusted model. 
The results from the percentage body fat models 
corroborated these results.
For women who used various combinations of car, 
public, and active transport methods, associations were 
typically smaller than those seen for men, although still 
statistically signifi
 cant. Women who combined public 
transport with active methods had a BMI on average 
0·67 kg/m² lower than car-only users (95% CI 
–0·86 to –0·47) and had 1·10% lower percentage body fat 
(95% CI –1·40 to –0·81), in fully adjusted models.
Men who reported walking as their only commuting 
method had a BMI 0·98 kg/m² (95% CI –1·20 to –0·76) 
lower than car-only commuters in fully adjusted analyses, 
and had 1·19% lower percentage body fat (95% CI 
–1·49 to –0·88). In adjusted analyses, women who used 
walking as only commuting method had a BMI 
0·80 kg/m² (95% CI –0·94 to –0·66) lower than car-only 
commuters, and had 1·12% lower percentage body fat 
(–1·31 to –0·94).
Results from subsample sensitivity analyses to 
investigate the eff
 ects of energy intake on the 
association between commuting method and obesity 
showed that for men, energy intake was a non-
signifi
 cant covariate in fully adjusted BMI models

association between commuting mode and BMI or 
percentage body fat, was therefore equivocal (appendix).
Results from sensitivity analyses to investigate the 
relation between commute distance and BMI and 
between commute distance and percentage body fat 
among walkers and cyclists broadly supported the 
fourth hypothesis: that walking or cycling greater 
distances was independently associated with lower BMI 
and percentage body fat. In fully adjusted models, 
compared with walking only commuters who walked 
less than 1 mile, individuals who walked 2 miles had a 
BMI 0·43 kg/m² lower (95% CI –0·76 to –0·09) and

–0·79% 
lower 
percentage 
body 
fat 
(95% 
CI 
–1·28 to –0·31). For both outcomes, a graded association 
was apparent across the walking distance categories 
(with the exception of the ≥4 miles category, which did 
not signifi
 cantly diff
 er from the reference category 
[<1 mile] for either outcome). Results for the cycling 
subgroup supported those for the walking subgroup. 
For example, in fully adjusted models, compared with 
cyclists who travelled 0–2 miles, those who cycled 
5–7 miles had a BMI 0·36 kg/m² lower (95% CI 
–0·67 to –0·05) and 1·14% lower percentage body fat 
(95% CI –1·64 to –0·64). Those who cycled 8–10 miles 
had a BMI 0·56 kg/m² lower (95% CI –1·05 to –0·08). 
For percentage body fat, a signifi
 cant, graded, 
independent association was seen across all cycling 
distance categories. However for BMI, only the 5–6 mile 
and 8–10 mile categories signifi
 cantly diff
 ered from the 
0–2 mile reference category (appendix).

Discussion
Our results show a signifi
 cant, independent association 
between method of commuting and both BMI and 
percentage body fat for men and women. Comprehensive 
adjustment for confounders only slightly attenuated the 
observed central associations. The largest associations were 
seen for cyclists versus car users. For example, male cyclists 
had a BMI on average 1·71 kg/m² lower than their car-
using counterparts after adjustment for socioeconomic, 
demographic, health, and behavioural factors, and other 
physical activity. For the average man in the sample (age 
53 years, height 176·7 cm, weight 85·9 kg) this fi
 nding 
equates to a substantial weight diff
 erence of 5 kg. Female 
cyclists had a BMI on average 1·65 kg/m² lower than car

commuters after full adjustment, which translates to a 
weight diff
 erence of 4·4 kg for the average woman in the 
sample (age 52 years, height 163·6 cm, weight 70·6 kg). 
Previous studies with smaller sample sizes typically 
included cycling and walking in one active-commuting 
category.13 Our results suggest that this approach might 
mask larger associations between cycling and reduced 
obesity. The second largest associations for both sexes were 
seen for walking. For both active categories, travelling 
greater distances was independently associated with lower 
BMI and percentage body fat. However, even individuals 
who reported a mix of public and active methods were also 
found to have signifi
 cantly lower percentage body fat and 
BMI than those who exclusively commuted by car, with a 
similar size of association seen for the walking only and the 
mixed public and active transport categories. This fi
 nding 
substantiates and adds detail to previous studies reporting 
similar sizes of association between active and public 
transport, and reduced obesity.13 No interactions by income 
were identifi
 ed, suggesting that associations between 
method of commute and obesity are equally distributed 
across socioeconomic groups. However, socioeconomic 
status is a predictor of method of commute, generating 
inequalities in access to and use of active methods of 
transport.12 Across most method categories, the size of 
associations with BMI and percentage body fat were larger 
for men than for women. This diff
 erence was especially 
apparent for public transport users, possibly because bus 
travel might be more prevalent among women, whereas 
men might be more likely to use rail transit and hence walk 
or cycle further to reach stations, which are typically more 
spatially dispersed. The only instance in which greater 
coeffi
  cients were seen for women than men was for the 
association between cycling and percentage body fat, 
suggesting that the 1643 (2%) middle-aged women in this 
sample who cycled to work were substantially fi
 tter than 
the norm, perhaps refl
 ecting residual confounding by 
unobserved domains of physical activity or health. 
Adjustment for energy intake in sensitivity analyses 
showed that lower energy intake predicted signifi
 cantly 
lower BMI (for women only) and percentage body fat 
(for men only), but the point estimates were negligible and 
did not attenuate the central relationship.
The strengths of this study lie in the quality of the data. 
UK Biobank is a large study with good geographical 
coverage. The age range is particularly useful to study 
determinants of obesity, because mid-life is a key period 
for risk development and as such a crucial juncture for 
interventions to promote positive behaviour change. Our 
data 
capture 
multi-method 
commutes, 
allowing 
diff
 erentiation between mixed methods and a more 
nuanced quantifi
 cation of exposure than has been 
possible in previous work.12,13,17 The use of two objectively 
measured obesity outcomes removes the possibility of 
misreporting of height and weight and addresses 
concerns about the use of BMI as an appropriate measure 
of adiposity in particularly lean people. The wide range of 
socioeconomic, demographic, health, behavioural, and 
occupational data also allows comprehensive adjustment 
for confounding. To our knowledge, our sensitivity 
analysis in which we used dietary data from UK Biobank 
represents the fi
 rst attempt to adjust for energy intake in 
this research area. However, the risk of residual 
confounding cannot be entirely eliminated in an 
observational, cross-sectional study design. For example, 
menopausal status is a key determinant of body 
composition among women in mid-life.
This study has several additional limitations. First and 
foremost is the risk of reverse causality, because direction 
of eff
 ect cannot be inferred from cross-sectional data.

an independent, signifi
 cant, graded association between 
distance and BMI and percentage body fat among walkers 
and cyclists lends support to a causal interpretation for 
these categories. We will undertake further research using 
the repeat-assessment subsample of UK Biobank to 
attempt to isolate causal processes. Second, UK Biobank is 
subject to missing data. The analytical sample was 
representative of the total commuting sample on key 
variables (although not representative of the entire 
baseline sample, since many participants were retired). 
The 75 229 individuals in the energy intake analytical 
subsample represented only 48% of the full analytical 
sample. They had a signifi
 cantly higher mean BMI and a 
higher proportion were female in this subsample than in 
the full analytical sample. However, when compared with 
the full analytical sample, very similar size and signifi
 cance 
of central associations were seen when models were run 
on the subsample without adjustment for energy intake 
(appendix). Third, although a seven-category commute 
mode exposure variable incorporating mixed-mode 
journeys has greater resolution than previous studies, it 
remains impossible to know precisely how much physical 
activity is typically involved for each category, and the 
relative contributions the diff
 erent methods within mixed 
categories make to overall journey distance. Further 
research based on the accelerometry subsample from UK 
Biobank would allow physical activity levels for each mode 
category to be more precisely quantifi
 ed.
The use of self-reported method of commute introduces 
further limitations including the possibility of bias and 
unknown validity or reliability. Relatedly, the extent to 
which multivariate modelling minimises residual 
confounding is dependent on the quality of the covariates, 
which were largely self-reported and non-validated. The 
sensitivity analysis in which we adjusted for energy 
intake also has limitations. Although useful for 
estimation of population-level energy intake, 24-h dietary 
recall questionnaires are less reliable as assessments of 
typical individual intakes, because of high intraperson 
variation in daily diet. Much of the dietary data collection 
was via online questionnaires and not at the same time 
as the assessment centre visits. Self-reported food 
consumption is also subject to recall and courtesy bias, 
typically resulting in underestimation of energy intake.26 
Finally, although uniquely large and comprehensive, UK 
Biobank is not representative of the UK population and 
might therefore be subject to selection bias. However, the 
sample is suffi
  ciently large and heterogeneous for the 
results to be considered generalisable.28
There is a clear consensus that obesity leads to poor 
health outcomes and increased risk of premature mortality. 
Strategies to address obesity must target both sides of the 
energy balance equation and create environments that 
support a healthy lifestyle. Populations are increasingly 
sedentary and there are fewer opportunities for routine 
physical activity than in the past. Our fi
 ndings suggest that 
in mid-life, a key period for the development of obesity, 
policies that enable and encourage active commuting 
could have a benefi
 cial eff
 ect on the population prevalence 
of obesity. The fi
 ndings support NHS guidelines,29 which 
recommend breaking up sedentary time with light physical 
activity, in addition to undertaking frequent moderate 
physical activity. Further research based on longitudinal 
data and quasi-experimental study designs will be 
necessary to help improve understanding of causal 
pathways and processes.
