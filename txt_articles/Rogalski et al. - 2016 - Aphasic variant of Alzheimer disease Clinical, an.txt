Aphasic variant of Alzheimer disease
Clinical, anatomic, and genetic features
ABSTRACT
Objective: To identify features of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) associated with Alzheimer
disease (AD) neuropathology. A related objective was to determine whether logopenic PPA is
a clinical marker for AD.
Methods: A total of 139 prospectively enrolled participants with a root diagnosis of PPA consti-
tuted the reference set. Those with autopsy or biomarker evidence of AD, and who had been eval-
uated at mild disease stages (Aphasia Quotient $85), were included (n 5 19). All had quantitative
language testing and APOE genotyping. Fifteen had MRI morphometry.
Results: Impaired word-finding was the universal presenting complaint in the aphasic AD group.
PPA clinical subtype was logopenic (n 5 13) and agrammatic (n 5 6). Fluency, repetition, naming,
and grammaticality ranged from preserved to severely impaired. All had relative preservation of
word comprehension. Eight of the 15 aphasic participants with AD showed no appreciable cor-
tical atrophy at the individual level on MRI. As a group, atrophy was asymmetrically concentrated
in the left perisylvian cortex. APOE e4 frequency was not elevated.
Conclusions: There is a close, but not obligatory, association between logopenic PPA and AD. No
language measure, with the possible exception of word comprehension, can confirm or exclude
AD in PPA. Biomarkers are therefore essential for diagnosis. Asymmetry of cortical atrophy
and normal APOE e4 prevalence constitute deviations from typical AD. These and additional
neuropathologic features suggest that AD has biological subtypes, one of which causes PPA.
Better appreciation of this fact should promote the inclusion of individuals with PPA and positive
AD biomarkers into relevant clinical trials. Neurology® 2016;87:1337–1343

Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is diagnosed when language impairment arises in relative isolation
and progresses to become the primary obstacle to daily functioning. Frontotemporal lobar degener-
ation (FTLD) and Alzheimer disease (AD) are its most common neuropathologic correlates. The
primary pathology is frequently FTLD-tau in agrammatic subtypes (PPA-G), FTLD-TDP in
semantic subtypes (PPA-S), and AD in logopenic subtypes (PPA-L).1
The goal of this report is to characterize the features of PPA associated with AD. Previous in-
vestigations were based on samples of convenience with aphasias of variable severity and language
testing of limited coverage, especially in the domain of grammar. The current report is based on 19
individuals with a clinical diagnosis of PPA and with postmortem verification or amyloid-PET
scans consistent with AD pathology. All participants were enrolled into a prospective project where
language measures are quantitatively and uniformly assessed and where cortical morphometry is
used to identify regions of peak atrophy. Only participants initially studied at mild stages of aphasia

 were included to emphasize the characteristic
features of the early language disturbance and
their anatomical correlates as close to disease
onset as possible.
Several specific questions were addressed. First,
is there justification for equating PPA-L with
AD pathology? Second, are there measures of lan-
guage function characteristic/pathognomonic of
PPA associated with AD? Third, is there a consis-
tent pattern of atrophy distribution in PPA asso-
ciated with AD? Fourth, is the APOE genotype
frequency in this group different from that seen
in more typical amnestic forms of AD?
METHODS The reference set for this investigation consisted of
139 participants with PPA prospectively enrolled into a longitudinal
project, with clinical subtype distribution of 32% PPA-G, 18%
PPA-L, 23% PPA-S, and 27% unclassifiable by current diagnostic
criteria.2 Twenty-seven have come to autopsy and an additional 61
have amyloid-PET determinations. Data from these 88 participants
were reviewed to identify individuals who had postmortem or
biomarker findings consistent with AD and mild aphasia (e.g., initial
Western Aphasia Battery–Revised [WAB-R3] aphasia quotient [AQ]
$85). The AQ threshold eliminated individuals where all language
functions become compromised and the pattern of the aphasia loses its
specificity. Data from the 19 participants who fulfilled these 2 criteria
were included in the analyses (figure 1). The PPA diagnosis was based
on 3 core criteria: (1) progressive language disorder of recent onset not
attributable to elementary motor or perceptual deficits; (2) absence of
consequential impairments in episodic memory, visuospatial skills, or
comportment for approximately 2 years as ascertained by medical
records, structured interviews with family members, and results of
nonlanguage tests (table e-1 at Neurology.org); and (3) diagnostic
investigations consistent with a neurodegenerative etiology.1,4,5
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. Northwestern University’s Institutional Review Board
approved this study. Informed consent was obtained from each
participant.
Speech and language assessment. Apraxia of speech was qual-
itatively rated during clinical assessment (M.-M.M.) by labored
output, voice distortions, errors of syllabic stress or duration, mis-
pronunciation of multisyllabic words, and errors of articulatory
sequencing that could not be attributed to upper or lower motor
neuron dysfunction.6 The WAB-R AQ served as a global measure
of language impairment.3 Individual language domains were assessed
quantitatively with tests previously used to characterize mild PPA.5
Fluency (i.e., words per minute [WPM]) was quantified from
a recorded story narrative.7,8 Sentence production scores on 2
subsets of 15 noncanonical sentences, one from the Northwestern
Anagram Test (NAT; flintbox.com/public/project/19927)9
and another from the Sentence Production Priming Test of
the Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and Sentences (NAVS-
SPPT),10 were averaged to derive a composite score of grammaticality
of sentence production.5 The NAT does not require oral responses
and was specifically designed to dissociate agrammatism from lack of
fluency. The ability to understand the syntactic structure of sentences
was assessed with the Sentence Comprehension Test of the NAVS,
based on a subset of 15 noncanonical sentences of the same type as
tested with the NAVS-SPPT and NAT. Repetition was quantitated
with the 6 most difficult items from the repetition subtest of the
WAB-R (items 10–15, which consist of phrases and sentences).3
Object naming was tested with the Boston Naming Test.11 Single
word comprehension was tested with a subset of 36 moderately
difficult items (157–192) of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary test.12
To control for differently scaled variables, quantitative performance
scores were transformed into percentages. The WPM counts were
transformed into percentages based on the control mean (132 6
20).5 In all other tests, performance of neurologically intact
participants of a similar age (n 5 37) was $94%.5
Aphasia classification. The 2011 classification guidelines for
PPA-S, PPA-G, and PPA-L were followed with a few
modifications.2,13 None of the 19 fit the PPA-S criteria. The
differentiation of PPA-L from PPA-G is arguably the most
challenging aspect of PPA classification.13,14 In this study,
the diagnosis of PPA-G was made when 2 criteria were met:
(1) noncanonical sentence production scores of #80% on the
NAT-NAVS; and (2) presence of agrammatic sentences in recorded
narrative or writing samples. The cutoff at 80% performance on the
NAT-NAVS test was empirically chosen based on a prior investigation
of PPA subtyping at mild impairment stages.5 Participants with word-
finding deficits and hesitations in speech, whose single word
comprehension was intact, who did not fulfill the 2 criteria for
agrammatism described above, and whose repetition score was
under 90% were classified as PPA-L. This left 2 unclassifiable
patients who had all the other features of PPA-L (including
logopenic speech with prominent word-finding failures) but whose
repetition scores were 91 and 94. We included these patients in the
PPA-L group based on our experience that such patients have
clinicoanatomic features similar to those with repetition impairments
and that they may represent an early stage of PPA-L.5,13
Quantitative MRI morphometry. Structural MRI scans from
the initial visit were acquired at Northwestern University’s Center for
Translational Imaging with a 3.0T Siemens (Munich, Germany)
TIM Trio scanner and were reconstructed with the FreeSurfer image

 analysis suite (version 5.1.0) as previously described.15 FreeSurfer
provides estimates of cortical thickness by measuring the distance
between representations of the white-gray and pial-CSF boundaries
across each point of the cortical surface.16 Geometric inaccuracies and
topologic defects were corrected using manual and automatic
methods based on FreeSurfer’s validated guidelines.
Cortical thickness of the PPA group was statistically contrasted
against 35 previously described right-handed, age- and education-
matched healthy volunteers using spherical surface maps.17 Differ-
ences in cortical thickness between groups were calculated by
conducting a general linear model on every vertex along the cor-
tical surface. A stringent false discovery rate (FDR)18 threshold of
0.001 was used to detect areas of peak cortical thinning (i.e.,
atrophy) for the PPA group contrast compared to controls.
Neuropathologic and biomarker evidence of AD. The 19
individuals with PPA in this study were selected to have postmor-
tem or in vivo biomarker evidence consistent with Alzheimer
pathology. Four of the participants had a primary postmortem
diagnosis of AD by National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer’s
Association criteria.19 The remaining 15 had amyloid-PET with
18F-florbetapir, which showed elevated amyloid, defined as the
mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio $1.10 (cerebral-to-
cerebellar), using previously described methods for processing.20
This threshold was recommended for detecting neuritic plaques
indicative of underlying AD.21,22
RESULTS All participants were right-handed and
Caucasian. There were 11 men and 8 women.
Symptom onset was under age 65 years in 14
(74%), with 8 reporting onset in the 50s. Daily
living activities that did not depend on language
were mostly preserved. The mean AQ was 90 6 4
and the mean Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes
(SOB) was 0.8 (range 0–3), with 16 PPA participants
having SOB scores of #1, indicating essentially
preserved activities of daily living beyond those that
had become difficult due to aphasia.
Individual language measures and subtypes. Impaired
word-finding was the presenting complaint and
a prominent finding at the initial clinical assessment
of all of the PPA participants (table 1). Word-finding
hesitation lowered word output fluency in some
participants, but not in those who reacted to word-
finding failures with lengthy circumlocutions. In fact,
2 individuals had WPM (fluency) scores higher
than control values. In the other language measures,
performance ranged from severely impaired to nearly
intact (table 1). The one exception was single word
comprehension, which was universally preserved, with
a group mean performance of 96% 6 5%. Symptoms
of apraxia of speech were present in 6/19 individuals (4
PPA-L, 2 PPA-G) but at a level of prominence that was
overshadowed by the aphasia.
Thirteen of the participants (68%) were classified
as PPA-L. This proportion would drop to 58% if the
2 patients with relatively preserved repetition but log-
openic speech were considered unclassifiable. Six
(32%) were classified as PPA-G. Table 2 provides exam-
ples of agrammatic statements from each of the 6 PPA-G
participants and their performance scores on the non-
canonical sentence production tasks (NAT-NAVS).
Independent t tests showed that the PPA-G group was
more impaired than the PPA-L group in sentence repe-
tition and their AQ (ps # 0.01, uncorrected) but these
differences were not significant with Bonferroni correc-
tion. The other measures did not reveal significant group
differences (table 1).
MRI morphometry. Quantitative MRI morphometry
was available for 15 participants (11 PPA-L, 4 PPA-
G). The group atrophy map of the entire sample
(n 5 15) is shown in figure 2. Peak atrophy sites

 for the group as a whole were concentrated within the
lateral temporal cortex, especially the superior temporal
gyrus and the adjacent temporoparietal junction of the
left hemisphere. Additional patchy atrophy was detected
in dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus,
and inferior temporal cortex. Atrophy patterns for the
clinical PPA-L and PPA-G subgroups yielded no
significant differences in a direct group comparison
(FDR 5 0.05).
Scans were also qualitatively assessed (M.-M.M.) at
the individual level. Eight out of 15 individual scans
had no appreciable cortical atrophy. Each of the remain-
ing 7 showed distinctly asymmetric atrophy mostly en-
compassing temporoparietal components of the left
hemisphere language network.
APOE. Five cases (1 PPA-G and 4 PPA-L) had the e4
allele of APOE. Only one of these was homozygous.
The remaining 14 (73%) had an e3,3 genotype. At the
Northwestern Alzheimer’s Disease Brain Bank, 26% of
the control population (n 5 190) has at least one e4
allele, whereas this frequency increases to 59% in those
with an amnestic dementia during life and AD at
autopsy (n 5 75).1 The 27% frequency of e4 allele
carriers in the 19 PPA participants with biomarker
evidence or autopsy-confirmed AD reported in the
current investigation is similar to control values.
These data are consistent with previous reports23,24
suggesting the e4 allele of APOE is not a risk factor
for clinical PPA or AD pathology in PPA.
DISCUSSION This report is based on 19 participants
with PPA with autopsy or biomarker evidence of Alz-
heimer pathology, examined in the mild stages of the dis-
ease at initial assessment. Results are therefore relevant to
clinical decision-making at the time of initial evaluation.
The majority of the participants (68%) had been clin-
ically classified as PPA-L, including 2 cases with logopenic
speech but preserved repetition. The remaining partici-
pants were classified as PPA-G. These proportions are
in line with those of an autopsy series of 58 PPA cases
examined at various severity stages, in which 69% of all
cases with AD pathology as the primary diagnosis had
logopenic aphasia.1 These results seem at odds with
another study, also of PPA participants with autopsy or
biomarker evidence of AD, where a complete overlap
with PPA-L was reported.25 However, in that study,
grammatical ability was not reported and 5/14 partici-
pants presented with additional nonverbal memory im-
pairments. Some of the participants in that study may,
therefore, have qualified for a PPA-G diagnosis and others
may have failed to fulfill the root diagnostic PPA criteria,
which require a relative sparing of episodic memory.
The converse question of whether all PPA-L is asso-
ciated with AD reveals equally complex relationships.
In the series of 58 autopsies, for example, only 56%
of PPA-L cases were associated with a primary neuro-
pathologic diagnosis of AD.1 Investigations addressing
this question with amyloid-PET scans have also yielded
variable results. One study reported that 92% of PPA-
L participants had positive amyloid scans.26 Two other
studies reported lower rates of 66% and 69%, more in
line with the autopsy results.27,28

 While there is evidence that PPA associated with AD
is more likely to present as logopenic aphasia and that
logopenic PPA is more likely to be associated with
AD, there is no one-to-one correspondence. Neither
individual measures of language impairment nor clinical
subtyping into logopenic vs agrammatic variants can
resolve the differential diagnosis. Fluency, repetition,
naming, and grammatical ability in individuals with
PPA and AD neuropathology, at least in the early stages,
may range from preserved to severely impaired and
MRI morphometry may initially show no obvious atro-
phy. Even the presence of speech apraxia, albeit of lesser
salience than the aphasia, does not rule out the presence
of AD. At the individual patient level, therefore, the
nature of neuropathology in a logopenic patient would
be difficult to resolve without biomarker evidence.
In the 7 cases with appreciable cortical atrophy on
quantitative MRI, the common denominators were pro-
found asymmetry favoring the left hemisphere and
greater atrophy of lateral temporal cortex compared to
medial temporal areas or the precuneus. The peak atro-
phy pattern for the group (figure 2) showed a distribution
similar to previous reports of atrophy and hypoperfusion
in PPA participants with autopsy or biomarker evidence
of AD.25,27 The concentration of atrophy in the tempor-
oparietal junction and adjacent superior temporal gyrus
mirrors atrophy patterns of PPA-L13 and is in keeping
with the greater representation of logopenic participants
in the group atrophy map shown in figure 2. The asym-
metrical atrophy distribution in our PPA cohort differs
from typical amnestic forms of AD,29 which tends to be
symmetric. However, the small patches of atrophy in
dorsal frontal cortex, precuneus, and inferior temporal
cortex overlapped with areas considered part of the cor-
tical atrophy signature of amnestic dementia with AD.29
The absence of detectable atrophy in the clinical scans of
7 patients reflects the early disease stages represented in
this study. Conceivably, more powerful imaging meth-
ods could have revealed abnormalities in these cases as
well. Practically, however, these results indicate that
a clinically unremarkable MRI in an individual with
PPA does not rule out underlying AD.
The inclusion of 2 individuals with logopenic speech
and relatively preserved repetition deficits under the
PPA-L variant could be viewed as a limitation since this
designation does not strictly follow the 2011 consensus
criteria.2 The alternative would have been to categorize
these 2 individuals as unclassifiable, which would
decrease the percentage of PPA-L associated with AD
and increase the number of PPA phenotypes associated
with AD pathology. All in all, the same conclusion could
be made; there is no unique correspondence between
a single PPA phenotype and AD neuropathology.
Another potential limitation of this study is the reli-
ance on amyloid-PET with florbetapir as the AD bio-
marker in 15 of the 19 participants. In individuals who
had been imaged within 1 year of death, however, the
same ligand was shown to offer better than 95% sensitiv-
ity and specificity for the postmortem detection of neu-
ritic plaques characteristic of AD.30 It is also conceivable
that some of the PPA participants with positive amyloid
scans could have an additional FTLD pathology. In 58
consecutive PPA autopsies, such a double diagnosis was
encountered in only 1 patient whose postmortem exam-
ination met criteria for both AD and FTLD-TDP.1 The
probability that the biomarker-positive PPA participants
in the current study were misclassified pathologically is
therefore quite low. Furthermore, the 4 autopsy-verified
participants were evenly split between the PPA-L and
PPA-G phenotypes and would, by themselves, support
the conclusion that there is no exclusive relationship
between AD and logopenic PPA.
Typical late-onset amnestic AD is commonly asso-
ciated with language impairments, mostly in the form
of anomia. However, such language impairments tend
to arise later than the amnesia and play a much less
conspicuous role in disrupting customary activities.
The current study addresses the entirely different phe-
notype of PPA where the aphasia is the first and most
salient feature. The Alzheimer pathology associated
with this phenotype has prominent features that set it
apart from the typical amnestic form of this disease.
(1) Onset is most commonly before age 65, perhaps ex-
plaining why the female predominance of typical AD is
not present. (2) Peak atrophy shows an asymmetric
predilection for the language-dominant left hemisphere
and displays only partial overlap with the atrophy sig-
nature of typical AD.29 (3) As previously reported in
Table 3
Variants of Alzheimer disease (AD)
1. Autosomal dominant, early-onset AD: Caused by amyloidopathy, not related to age or APOE.
2. Late-onset AD: Age and APOE4 related, amnestic phenotype, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) emerge and reach highest densities in
hippocampo-entorhinal complex according to Braak & Braak staging patterns.35
3. Primarily aphasic AD: Not age or APOE4 related. NFT can violate Braak & Braak staging patterns by being more frequent in
language than memory areas.23
4. Primarily visuospatial AD (posterior cortical atrophy): NFT can be more frequent in visual areas (Brodmann area [BA] 17, BA 18,
and superior colliculus) than the hippocampo-entorhinal complex.37 Age and APOE dependency remain to be determined.
5. Primarily behavioral/executive (frontal-type) AD: NFT densities in frontal cortex can be greater than in the hippocampo-entorhinal
complex.38 Age and APOE dependency remain to be determined.

 an autopsy series,1 the APOE e4 allele is not a risk
factor for the AD that causes PPA. (4) Learning dis-
abilities, including dyslexia, are risk factors for PPA but
not amnestic dementias.31,32 (5) Neurofibrillary tangles
(NFT) can display atypical asymmetric distributions
that violate the Braak and Braak pattern by favoring
language cortex over mediotemporal limbic areas.23 (6)
Neuritic amyloid plaques may be asymmetrically dis-
tributed, favoring the left hemisphere.20 (7) TDP-43
abnormalities, seen in at least 30% of typical AD cases,
are not present in the AD pathology associated with
PPA.33 These features indicate that the AD associated
with PPA has temporal, anatomic, neuropathologic,
and genetic factors that diverge from those of the far
more common late-onset and amnestic forms of AD.
As shown in table 3, AD can have several variants,
some of which, like PPA, are nonamnestic.34–38 Indi-
viduals with these atypical nonamnestic manifestations
tend to be excluded from AD clinical trials, where out-
come measures are chosen to emphasize memory func-
tion. The advent of molecular biomarkers now makes it
possible to identify a sizable contingent of such indi-
viduals with underlying AD pathology. Their inclusion
in clinical trials will offer them equal access to novel
agents and will require the introduction of new out-
come measures designed to assess the relevant nonam-
nestic domain of the primary cognitive impairment.
