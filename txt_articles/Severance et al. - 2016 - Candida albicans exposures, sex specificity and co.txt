Immune aberrations in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have led to the hypotheses that infectious agents or corresponding
immune responses might contribute to psychiatric etiopathogeneses. We investigated case–control differences in exposure to the
opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, and examined associations with cognition, medication, lifestyle, and somatic
conditions. We quantified C. albicans IgG antibodies in two cohorts totaling 947 individuals and evaluated odds ratios (OR) of
exposure with psychiatric disorder using multivariate regressions. The case–control cohort included 261 with schizophrenia, 270
with bipolar disorder, and 277 non-psychiatric controls; the second included 139 with first-episode schizophrenia, 78 of whom were
antipsychotic naive. No differences in C. albicans exposures were found until diagnostic groups were stratified by sex. In males,
C. albicans seropositivity conferred increased odds for a schizophrenia diagnosis (OR 2.04–9.53, P ⩽ 0.0001). In females, C. albicans
seropositivity conferred increased odds for lower cognitive scores on Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological
Status (RBANS) in schizophrenia (OR 1.12, P ⩽ 0.004), with significant decreases on memory modules for both disorders (P ⩽ 0.0007–
0.03). C. albicans IgG levels were not impacted by antipsychotic medications. Gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances were associated with
elevated C. albicans in males with schizophrenia and females with bipolar disorder (P ⩽ 0.009–0.02). C. albicans exposure was
associated with homelessness in bipolar males (P ⩽ 0.0015). In conclusion, sex-specific C. albicans immune responses were evident
in psychiatric disorder subsets. Inquiry regarding C. albicans infection or symptoms may expedite amelioration of this treatable
comorbid condition. Yeast exposure as a risk factor for schizophrenia and its associated cognitive and GI effects require further
investigation including the possible contribution of gut–brain mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION
Psychiatric disorders may arise from a combination of genetic and
environmental factors, and increasingly, immune-related hypoth-
eses are proposed to reconcile both aspects of this interface.1–3
One theme of psychiatric immune research has been the search
for infectious, possibly neurotropic, pathogens as etiological
agents.4,5 It is believed that exposure to infectious organisms
such as viruses or parasites during critical stages of neurodevelop-
ment may confer damage to the central nervous system, thus
resulting in the onset of behavioral anomalies and psychiatric
disorders during adulthood.6,7
Fungal pathogens have not been extensively evaluated in
studies of psychiatric disorders. We have previously shown that
people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have elevated
antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae,8,9 a yeast species com-
monly used by bakers and brewers and not typically considered to
be virulent in humans. Studies of the human mycobiome regularly
report the presence of S. cerevisiae, but Candida albicans and other
Candidal species are the clearly dominant commensal fungus in
humans.10,11 C. albicans is a diploid, polymorphic yeast residing in
mucosal surfaces of the human respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI)
and genitourinary tracts. Under a set of predisposing conditions,
C. albicans can become pathogenic ranging in seriousness from
local infections of the mouth, throat, and reproductive tract to a
systemic invasive candidiasis that impacts the circulatory system,
bones and brain.12 Although bacterial dysbioses can contribute to
C. albicans overgrowth by failing to provide the competition
needed to keep the fungus in check, it is likely that the
complexities of the fungal–bacterial, fungal–fungal, and fungal–
host relationships are currently underappreciated.13
Here we investigated C. albicans as a new candidate infectious
disease target for studies of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
Blood levels of IgG class antibodies directed against a specific
pathogen generally reflect the lifetime exposure of an individual
to that antigen.14 Thus, we measured and compared IgG anti-
bodies directed against this fungus in two psychiatric cohorts: one
composed of 261 people with schizophrenia, 270 with bipolar
disorder and 277 individuals without a history of psychiatric
disorder; the other cohort was composed of 139 people with first-
episode schizophrenia, 78 of whom were antipsychotic naive. We
then determined whether exposure to C. albicans was associated
with cognitive symptoms, as evident by scores on the Repeatable
Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS)
Form A.15 Finally, to provide a preliminary indication of whether or
not C. albicans exposure could be considered a candidate risk
factor for these psychiatric disorders, we investigated significant
disease

 influences. Toward this end, we evaluated our antibody measures
in conjunction with a variety of extrinsic factors including
antipsychotic medication, homelessness, and somatic comorbid-
ities. Among the somatic conditions tested were cardiovascular,
endocrine, GI, genitourinary, hepatic, neoplastic and respiratory
disturbances.
RESULTS
First, we examined C. albicans IgG levels in cases compared with
controls
and
found
no
significant
differences
among
the
diagnostic
groups
(analysis
of
variance
(ANOVA)
F = 0.93,
P ⩽ 0.39). However, when we categorized groups according to
sex, we found significant elevations of C. albicans IgG in males
with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder compared with male
controls (ANOVA F = 5.55, P ⩽ 0.0043; data distributions, means,
and medians are shown in Figure 1). In multinomial logistic
regression models that included the independent variables of age,
homelessness, race, and socioeconomic status, we found that
irrespective of the positivity cutoff designation used as the
dependent variable, elevated C. albicans measures conferred
increased odds ratios (OR) to males with schizophrenia compared
with control males (Table 1). The elevated C. albicans IgG levels
that we identified in bipolar disorder males were found to be a
function of a positive homelessness history (positive, n = 12,
mean ± s.d., 0.98 ± 0.55; negative, n = 65, mean ± s.d., 0.53 ± 0.40;
t-tests, t = 3.30, two-tailed P ⩽ 0.0015). C. albicans antibody levels in
females were not distinguishable between groups, but notably
were of the same magnitude as the male schizophrenia and male
bipolar disorder groups (Figure 1).
We measured C. albicans antibody levels in a second cohort of
139 individuals with first-episode schizophrenia, 78 of whom
were antipsychotic naive. We detected no differences in antibody
levels between those who were antipsychotic naive compared
with those who were receiving antipsychotic medications (AP+,
mean ± s.d.
0.60 ± 0.39;
AP − ,
mean ± s.d.
0.56 ± 0.33;
t-tests,
t = 0.72, two-tail P ⩽ 0.47). There were also no differences between
males in these two medication groups or between females in
these two groups (AP+ male, n = 30, mean ± s.d. 0.52 ± 0.29; AP −
male, n = 44, mean ± s.d. 0.51 ± 0.34; t-tests t = 0.07, two-tail
P ⩽ 0.94; AP+ female, n = 31, mean ± s.d. 0.68 ± 0.46; AP − female,
n = 34, mean ± s.d. 0.61 ± 0.31; t-tests, t = 0.70, two-tail P ⩽ 0.49).
There were trends towards increased antibody levels in females
compared to males in both medication groups (t-tests, t = 1.36–
1.62, P ⩽ 0.06–0.08).
We then tested whether C. albicans positivity was associated
with cognitive impairment. We found that females with schizo-
phrenia who were C. albicans IgG-seropositive performed more
poorly on these tests than did females with schizophrenia who
were C. albicans IgG-seronegative or than female controls (Total
RBANS score: multinomial logistic regression, OR 1.12, 95th% CI
1.03–1.23, P ⩽ 0.004). Furthermore, performance on the Immediate
and
Delayed
Memory
modules
of
the
RBANS
test
were
significantly reduced in both C. albicans IgG-seropositive women
with schizophrenia and those with bipolar disorder compared
with respective seronegative groups, with some variation depend-
ing on the positivity model (Table 2). Male schizophrenia, male
bipolar disorder, male control, and female control groups did not
show significant differences in scores on the RBANS test that could
be attributable to C. albicans IgG levels.
To determine whether a particular somatic or clinical condition
affected the observed patterns of C. albicans antibodies, we
compared
IgG
levels
between
individuals
with
psychiatric
disorders who were positive and negative for current or chronic
conditions
in
seven
categories:
cardiovascular,
endocrine,
genitourinary,
GI,
hepatological,
neoplastic,
and
respiratory
disturbances. Of the categories evaluated, GI, genitourinary and
neoplastic conditions were associated with C. albicans levels, again
in a sex-specific manner (Table 3). Reported GI symptoms included
constipation, Crohn’s disease, diarrhea, gastroesophageal reflux
disease, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, Norwalk
virus, pancreatitis, ulcers, any abdominal surgery, and any
abdominal pain. Genitourinary disturbances included urinary tract
infections, kidney infections, cysts, urinary incontinence, and

pituitary
adenoma,
melanoma,
lung
cancer,
breast
cancer,
testicular cancer, endometrial cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer
and ovarian cancer. Significant C. albicans-associated GI sympto-
matology and genitourinary disturbances affected males with
schizophrenia and females with bipolar disorder, although the
genitourinary disturbances did not survive Bonferroni multiple
comparison corrections. We also observed a trend toward
association of C. albicans IgG with neoplastic conditions in males
with schizophrenia (Table 3). To determine whether GI distur-
bances were significantly associated with antibody levels inde-
pendently of a cancer history or genitourinary source, we
reanalyzed the GI association with neoplasm- and genitourinary-
positive individuals removed. The positive association of GI
symptoms and elevated C. albicans IgG in both groups persisted,
although these analyses did not survive Bonferroni multiple
comparison corrections (males with schizophrenia, GI negative,

0.64 ± 0.46; t-test, t = − 1.83, one-tail P ⩽ 0.03; females with bipolar
disorder, GI negative, n = 45, mean ± s.d. 0.46 ± 0.35; GI positive,
n = 42, mean ± s.d. 0.64 ± 0.52, t-test, t = − 1.74, one-tail P ⩽ 0.03).
DISCUSSION
Our results document that antibodies directed against the
opportunistic fungal pathogen, C. albicans, were elevated in
distinct subsets of individuals with psychiatric disorders. For some
of these individuals, females in particular, C. albicans antibodies

C. albicans exposure in schizophrenia

 were associated with reduced cognitive functioning. Elevated
C. albicans could be attributable to extraneous lifestyle or somatic
variables for some subgroups, but for others, such as males with
schizophrenia, no confounders were evident suggesting the
possibility that exposure to this pathogen could be a risk factor
for
this
psychiatric
disorder.
Sex-specific
patterns
reflected
expectations that yeast overgrowth is found in the female
reproductive tract, during immunosuppression and in association
with homelessness. C. albicans antibody patterns in both sexes
preliminarily implicated the GI tract as a source of microbial
dysbioses in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Follow-up
studies are required to determine how unregulated C. albicans
growth might impact the gut–brain axis in psychiatric disorders.
Many of our observations mirrored epidemiological and sex-
specific expectations of heightened exposure to C. albicans in
women, in those who were immunocompromised and in people
who had a history of homelessness. In this regard, these antibody
associations with lifestyle and somatic conditions represented
conceptual controls. The portion of our analyses with males
showed the most direct and strongest linkage of C. albicans
antibodies with schizophrenia, and this association was indepen-
dent of potential confounders such as age, race, antipsychotic
medication, homelessness, socioeconomic status, and a history of
cancer. The similarly significant antibody elevation in males with
bipolar disorder was found to be purely a function of increased
exposures to this pathogen due to a past period of homelessness.
In women, we were not able to detect significant differences in
strict comparisons of antibody levels among the diagnostic
groups. This
finding seems logical
given that the
female
reproductive anatomy is prone to yeast infections. Thus, women
are likely exposed more often to C. albicans overgrowth regardless
of psychiatric status and so any disease-related association might
be obscured. Intriguingly, however, it was women who exhibited
C. albicans associations with decreased cognition, suggesting that
elimination of the overgrowth might help to improve cognition-
associated symptoms. We can speculate that this significant
association of yeast antibodies with cognition, which is not
observed in control women in spite of an equivalent rate of
exposure, is consistent with a gene by environmental etiology of
psychiatric disorders.16,17 In this scenario, the exposure to an
immunopathogenic substance or agent in an individual with a
genetically encoded immune system or endothelial barrier defect
could be prone to CNS compromise by potentially neurotrophic
pathogens or by peripherally generated immune factors.18,19 A
role for peripherally acting systems in a CNS disorder was also
supported by our findings that antibody levels were higher in
people who reported GI conditions compared with those who did
not. This GI connection was independent of those variables
identified as confounders and preliminarily points toward a GI
route of C. albicans immune response generation, perhaps
signaling the presence of gut dysbiosis. Our findings, therefore,
may be consistent with the hypothesis that disturbance to the gut
microbiome in psychiatric disorders can lead to translocation of
gut-related products, including those that are derived from fungi,
into systemic circulation.18–20
These data also serve in part as biological validation of our
recently published next-generation sequencing of the orophar-
yngeal microbiome, where among several dysregulated bacterial
species, we detected elevated abundances of the fungal Candida
spp., C. dubliensis, in people with schizophrenia compared with
controls.21 Fungal material has been found in the cerebrospinal
fluid and brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.22–24 Although these recent reports
support the possibility that the C. albicans organism is directly
pathogenic to the brain, yeast alternatively may provide a source
of toxic breakdown products or digested bioactive peptides that
could elicit an antifungal immune response and have the
propensity to cross the blood–gut and blood–brain barriers.
Yeasts also synthesize cyclic dipeptides and based on research in
other disciplines, it is further possible that these peptides activate
apoptotic pathways associated with neuronal function.25 Certain
metabolic products of yeast including propionic acid have been
implicated in autism.26 Yeasts are also known producers of
neurotransmitters including noradrenaline by Saccharomyces spp
and serotonin by Candida spp.27
The hypothesis that infectious agents contribute to the
etiopathophysiology of psychiatric disorders is most often applied
in a context of pathogen exposure or immune activation during
critical prenatal neurodevelopmental time windows.6,28–35 It is
more difficult to ascertain whether infection or activation of the
infectious disease process during one’s lifetime contributes to an
increased risk for the development of mental illness. Nevertheless,
there is an expansive literature base that aims to understand how
pathogen-specific and generalized immune dysregulation extrin-
sic to the prenatal setting might contribute to future psychiatric
disorders.35–42 In many of these studies, as well as in our own
assays, an IgG antibody-based measure was used and this index
does not differentiate current infections from past exposures. In
the data not shown, we tested a random sample of 88 individuals
for acute C. albicans infection using an IgM antibody, a measure
that generally reflects a more recent infection. We found that ~ 9%
of these samples were positive for IgM, whereas 32% were
positive for IgG, suggesting that for most individuals, C. albicans
overgrowth occurred sometime in the more distant past. Long-
itudinal investigations are required to more directly address the
issue of postnatal exposures and psychiatric disorder develop-
ment. Interestingly, studies of military cohorts have documented
IgG elevations against a number of antigens, including pathogens,
as early as 2 years prior to the diagnosis of disease.43–45
Several methodological, analytical, and conceptual factors limit
the extent to which our results can be interpreted. From a
technical standpoint, given that there are over 150 species of
Candida, it is possible that the commercial immunoassay kit that
we used also detected exposures to other similarly immunogenic
Candidal species, including the many that are benign and
importantly the few that are pathogenic. In our data analyses, it
was not possible for us to correct for all of the multiple variables
including lifestyle characteristics that might contribute to our
findings. For example, information regarding immunosuppression
from sources other than cancer treatment was not available for
our study analyses. We addressed potentially confounding basic
demographic factors by including these variables in our multiple
regressions models. In this manner and as described earlier, we
were able to find that a history of homelessness significantly
accounted for the elevated C. albicans exposures in males with
bipolar disorder. Of note, none of the other demographic factors
(age, race, and socioeconomic status) were independently or
interactively associated with C. albicans IgG levels. We applied
multiple comparison testing for the basic interdiagnostic group
analyses; however, applying this correction to the smaller sample
size sub-category comparisons would have eliminated detection
of informative associations. Therefore, such sub-analyses including
the GI associations remain preliminary and support the explora-
tory nature of this paper. Although our results demonstrate an
absence of effect of antipsychotic medications on C. albicans IgG
levels, we did not have information regarding over-the-counter or
prescription treatments of the somatic conditions evaluated in
this study.
In conclusion, our initial results suggested the absence of
differential C. albicans IgG levels between psychiatric cases and
controls.
However,
when
sexes
were
evaluated
separately,
numerous significant disease-specific associations of this fungus
with lifestyle, somatic conditions, and cognitive measures were
evident. It may be premature to list this pathogen as a risk factor
for disease causation, but its status as a comorbidity requires
clinical attention. During health care evaluation, inquiry regarding

 the presence of symptoms of C. albicans infections would help to
identify individuals in need of treatment. Furthermore, the early
identification of active infection might be an indicator of those at
risk for cognitive decline; however, future research is necessary to
investigate this connection. In people who have or who are prone
to C. albicans overgrowth, dietary management geared toward
correcting microbial imbalances may be considered. In the long
term, more research is required to understand the mechanisms
that trigger pathogenicity of fungal commensals and how this
might impact brain function in psychiatric disorders.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study participants
Cohort 1—Sheppard Pratt Health System, Baltimore, MD, USA.
This study
cohort was composed of 808 individuals: 277 were control individuals with
no history of psychiatric disorder; 261 individuals were diagnosed with
schizophrenia; and 270 were diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Diagnoses
were made according to criteria defined by DSM-IV-TR46 and have been
previously described.47,48 For inclusion in the schizophrenia group,
individuals received a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreni-
form disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. Individuals with bipolar disorder
had a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 bipolar disorder or bipolar
disorder not otherwise specified. For both groups, inclusion criteria
required an age between 18 and 65 years. Individuals without a history of
psychiatric disorder were recruited from posted announcements and were
screened to rule out current or past psychiatric disorders with the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders Non-Patient
Edition.49 Control participants were between the ages of 20 and 60 years,
inclusive. Exclusion criteria for all groups included: mental retardation;
clinically significant medical disorder that would affect cognitive perfor-
mance; any history of intravenous substance abuse or a primary diagnosis
of substance abuse or substance dependence. For controls, any active
substance misuse was considered an exclusion criterion.
At the time of interview, cognitive functioning was assessed with the
RBANS Form A.15 Clinical information was gathered, and individuals were
asked to report current or chronic conditions related to their health. These
conditions could include those that occurred within the last month, were
treated with medication, or were chronic. Medical records and self-reports
were reviewed for the following categories: cardiovascular, endocrine,
genitourinary, GI, hepatological, neoplastic, and respiratory disturbances.
Specific conditions falling within each category are reported in the Results
section for those categories that exhibited significant case–control
differences. Information for these categories was not available for all
individuals, but relevant sample sizes are reported in the Results section.
Basic demographic data for this study population are shown in Table 4.
Maternal education was used as a surrogate for socioeconomic status.
Diagnostic groups differed significantly in age, homelessness, race, sex
and maternal education. Thus, these variables were all included in the
multivariate analyses described below.
These studies were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the
Sheppard Pratt Health System and the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution
following
established
guidelines.
All
participants
provided
written
informed consent after study procedures were explained. This research
was performed in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical
Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans.
Cohort 2—University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.
The methods for
identifying and characterizing the individuals with a first episode of
schizophrenia according to criteria defined by DSM-IV have also been
previously described.50 Seventy-eight of these patients were antipsychotic
naive and 61 patients were currently receiving antipsychotic medication.
Individuals were excluded from the study if they had a relevant
comorbidity such as heart disease, liver cirrhosis, known immune-
mediated disease (such as multiple sclerosis), or a history of substance
dependence. Demographic data regarding age and sex are listed in
Table 4. The region from which patients were recruited was generally
homogenous regarding socioeconomic characteristics. Informed consent
was obtained from all study participants. Protocols for sample collection
and analyses were approved by the ethics committee at the University of
Cologne, Heidelberg University and Johns Hopkins University, in accor-
dance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Laboratory procedures
Blood samples were obtained by venipuncture, and plasma and serum
separated and assessed for antibodies. Anti-C. albicans IgG levels were
measured according to the manufacturer’s protocol using a commercially
available kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Each 96-well plate tested
contains kit standards as well as study sample replicates for use as internal
controls of reproducibility.
Statistical analyses
Following test procedures, investigators were unblinded for the data
analyses.
Differences
in
quantitative
levels
of
antibodies
between
diagnostic groups were compared using ANOVAs with Sidak post hoc
tests. C. albicans IgG seropositivity was designated using three different
cutoff values to best capture a range of positivities: (1) absorbance value
below which 90% of female control IgG values fall; (2) absorbance value

 below which 90% of male control IgG values fall; and (3) absorbance value
designations assigned by standards of the commercial ELISA kit included
for each plate. Higher absorbance values utilized for a cutoff are more
conservative than the lower absorbance values that are less rigorous
estimates of seropositivity (Figure 1). Odds ratios for disease association of
IgG quantitative levels and the three differently calculated IgG seropositiv-
ities were assigned using multivariate logistic regressions corrected for
age, homelessness, sex, race, and maternal education. Paired comparisons
between groups of other continuous variables including age and RBANS
scores were also evaluated with t-tests. Multiple comparison testing was
evaluated and applied to each analysis depending on the number of
comparisons. Results that were significant but fell short of Bonferroni
P-value limits are so indicated. Differences in categorical demographic data
were evaluated with chi square tests. All the data analyses were performed
with groups subdivided according to sex so that sex-specific differences
could be identified. For multivariate regressions, sex was dropped as a
correction variable when all members of the same sex were evaluated.
Statistical analyses were performed with STATA version 12 (STATA Corp LP,
College Station, TX, USA).
