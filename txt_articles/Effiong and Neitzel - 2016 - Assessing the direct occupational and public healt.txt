Assessing the direct occupational and
public health impacts of solar radiation
management with stratospheric aerosols
Utibe Effiong and Richard L. Neitzel*
Abstract
Geoengineering is the deliberate large-scale manipulation of environmental processes that affects the Earth’s
climate, in an attempt to counteract the effects of climate change. Injecting sulfate aerosol precursors and
designed nanoparticles into the stratosphere to (i.e., solar radiation management [SRM]), has been suggested
as one approach to geoengineering. Although much is being done to unravel the scientific and technical
challenges around geoengineering, there have been few efforts to characterize the potential human health
impacts of geoengineering, particularly with regards to SRM approaches involving stratospheric aerosols. This
paper explores this information gap. Using available evidence, we describe the potential direct occupational
and public health impacts of exposures to aerosols likely to be used for SRM, including environmental
sulfates, black carbon, metallic aluminum, and aluminum oxide aerosols. We speculate on possible health impacts
of exposure to one promising SRM material, barium titanate, using knowledge of similar nanomaterials. We also
explore current regulatory efforts to minimize exposure to these toxicants. Our analysis suggests that adverse public
health impacts may reasonably be expected from SRM via deployment of stratospheric aerosols. Little is known about
the toxicity of some likely candidate aerosols, and there is no consensus regarding acceptable levels for public
exposure to these materials. There is also little infrastructure in place to evaluate potential public health impacts in the
event that stratospheric aerosols are deployed for solar radiation management. We offer several recommendations
intended to help characterize the potential occupation and public health impacts of SRM, and suggest that a
comprehensive risk assessment effort is needed before this approach to geoengineering receives further consideration.

Background
Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since
the 1950s, human influence on the climate system has
become clear [1, 2]. Because human activities have be-
come significant geological forces, the term “anthropo-
cene” has been applied to the current geological epoch,
which began in the eighteenth century [3]. The United
Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) has forecast that if human activity and world de-
velopment continue unimpeded, average surface temper-
atures could rise as much as 4.8 °C by 2100 [1, 2, 4].
The lack of success to date in efforts to reduce green-
house gas emissions sufficiently has prompted attention
to the possibility of counteracting the effects of emis-
sions through the intentional manipulation of global-
scale Earth system processes – a process referred to as
“geoengineering” [5]
The concept of geoengineering is not new, and dates
back to at least 1965 [6]. However, the term geoengi-
neering as applied in its current context was introduced
in 1977 [7]. Geoengineering approaches include solar ra-
diation management, or SRM, and carbon dioxide re-
moval (CDR) [5]. SRM techniques attempt to offset
effects of increased greenhouse gas concentrations by re-
ducing the proportion of incoming short wavelength
solar radiation that is absorbed or reflected by the earth’s
atmosphere (Fig. 1) [8]. Proposed SRM techniques in-
clude stratospheric aerosols, reflective satellites, whiten-
ing of the clouds, whitening of built structures and

 increasing plant reflectivity (Fig. 2) [5]. All SRM deploy-
ment techniques require a global approach since local-
ized deployment will not produce sufficient effects.
Importantly,
SRM
approaches
to
managing
climate
change require initial and ongoing addition of aerosols
to the atmosphere, with increasingly greater additions as
emissions of GHGs rise, given the risk of sudden and
potentially catastrophic warming if aerosol levels are not
maintained. Proposed CDR approaches include afforest-
ation/reforestation, direct air carbon dioxide (CO2) cap-
ture/storage, manufacturing carbonate minerals using
silicate rocks and CO2 from the air, accelerated weather-
ing

rocks,

addition
and

fertilization (Fig. 2) [5].
This paper will focus on SRM via stratospheric aerosol
injection, and will describe potential direct human
health impacts. We explore three knowledge gaps: 1) hu-
man exposures, 2) human health impacts, and 3) expos-
ure limits. SRM may be expected to result in ecosystem
damage and resulting human health effects through in-
direct mechanisms such as damage to, or contamination
of, agricultural products and wildlife. While these effects
are important, they are beyond the scope of our paper.
Stratospheric aerosols for use in SRM
The stratosphere is the second major layer of Earth’s
atmosphere, lying immediately above the lowest layer
(the troposphere) at an altitude of 10–50 km [9].
Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with
increasing elevation. The potential for SRM from
stratospheric injection of aerosols has been demon-
strated
by
global
cooling
following
large
volcanic
eruptions [10].
A wide range of particles could be released into the
stratosphere to achieve the SRM objective of scattering
sunlight back to space. Sulfates and nanoparticles cur-
rently favored for SRM include sulfur dioxide, hydrogen
sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, black carbon, and specially
engineered
discs
composed
of
metallic
aluminum,
aluminum oxide and barium titanate [11]. In particular,
engineered nanoparticles are considered very promising.
The particles would utilize photophoretic and electro-
magnetic forces to self-levitate above the stratosphere
[11]. These nanoparticles would remain suspended lon-
ger than sulfate particles, would not interfere with
stratospheric chemistry, and would not produce acid
rain [12]. However, while promising, the self-levitating
nanodisc has not been tested to verify efficacy, may in-
crease ocean acidification due to atmospheric CO2 en-
trapment,
has
uncharacterized
human
health
and
environmental impacts, and may be prohibitively expen-
sive [12].
Knowledge gap 1: human exposures
Human exposures to materials used for SRM could
occur during the manufacture, transportation, deploy-
ment and post-deployment of these materials [13]. In
this paper, unless otherwise stated, inhalation is the pri-
mary route of exposure considered.

 Occupational exposures
Airborne sulfate exposures have been shown to range
up to 23 mg/m3 in sulfuric acid plants [14]. Addition-
ally, high exposures to sulfuric acid fumes have also
been noted in the petrochemical industry, and high
exposures to hydrogen sulfide and carbonyl sulfide
have also been noted in natural gas extraction opera-
tions [15, 16]. Exposures to black carbon during its
manufacture can be quite high [17]. Elevated airborne
exposures
to
aluminum
and
its
oxide
have
been
shown to occur during aluminum refining, smelting
and at aluminum powder plants [18]. There appears
to be no available documentation of occupational ex-
posure to barium titanate. In addition to manufactur-
ing settings, exposures to SRM materials could occur
during deployment, e.g., during cloud seeding opera-
tions, as well as from accidents during transportation
[19, 20].
Occupational exposures to SRM materials are likely to
occur over brief periods (e.g., days to weeks), with the
potential for repeated or cyclic exposures. The health ef-
fects of such exposures will therefore likely be acute in
nature, though repeated exposures create an opportunity
for chronic health effects. Occupational exposures may
be attenuated through the use of engineering controls
such as ventilation, as well as the use of personal pro-
tective equipment (PPE) such as respirators and protect-
ive suits.
Population exposures
Due
to
atmospheric
circulation
and
gravitational
deposition,
large-scale
population
exposures
to
atmospherically-injected SRM materials will almost cer-
tainly occur after their deployment. Population expo-
sures could also occur through ingestion of food and
water contaminated with deposited particles, as well as
transdermally [11, 21]. Unlike occupational exposures,
there has been virtually no research done to estimate
ground-level
personal
exposures to
SRM
materials,
though the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
does provide guidance on methods for evaluating envir-
onmental exposures to several possible SRM materials
[22].
Stratospheric injection of sulfur dioxide and black
carbon has already been modeled to analyze potential
deposition of sulfate and soot [21, 23]. One model es-
timated that with 1 Tg of black carbon infused into
the stratosphere annually, after ten years of geoengi-
neering, the globally averaged mass burden would be
approximately 8 × 10−6 kg m−2 [23]. The intentional
addition of black carbon to the atmosphere will ex-
acerbate adverse health effects already resulting from
unintentional release at ground level [24]. In the year
2000, the global emission of black carbon was esti-
mated at 7.6 Tg, and the globally averaged mass bur-
den of black carbon was roughly 1.5 × 10−5 kg m−2
[25].
No

 potential global burden of environmental aluminum,
alumina or barium titanate that might result from
SRM.
In contrast to occupational exposures, population ex-
posures to SRM materials will be continuous and pro-
longed over months to years, but will likely be orders of
magnitude lower than those experienced occupationally.
Thus the health effects will be primarily chronic in na-
ture. The use of PPE to reduce personal exposures to de-
posited SRM materials is not feasible on a population
scale.
Knowledge gap 2: potential human health impacts
Table 1 summarizes, by bodily system, the potential
human health effects of the aerosols that may be used
for SRM.
Inhalational studies with sulfuric acid aerosol suggest
that it has a local irritant effect and no systemic effects
[26]. Squamous cell metaplasia in the laryngeal epithe-
lium has been observed in animal studies at exposures
as low as 0.3 mg/m3, with more severe metaplasia fol-
lowing exposures of 1.38 mg/m3. Epidemiological studies
suggest a relationship between exposure to mists con-
taining sulfuric acid and an increased incidence of laryn-
geal cancer, and the International Agency for Research
on Cancer has concluded that “occupational exposure to
strong inorganic mists containing sulfuric acid is car-
cinogenic for humans” [27, 28].
In humans, and in particular asthmatics, increases in
specific airway resistance or decreases in forced expiratory
volume or forced expiratory flow are the primary response
following acute exposure to sulfur dioxide [29]. Cough, ir-
ritation, increased salivation, and erythema of the trachea
and main bronchi occurred following controlled expo-
sures to ≤8 ppm for 20 min [30]. Exposures to higher
levels (e.g., 40 ppm) can produce a burning sensation in
the nose and throat, dyspnea, and severe airway obstruc-
tion that may only partially reverse over time [31]. Expo-
sures to even higher levels (e.g., ≤100 ppm) can result in
reactive airway dysfunction syndrome, which involves
bronchial epithelial damage and increased sensitization
and nonspecific hypersensitivity to other irritant stimuli
[32, 33]. Deaths can occur following exposures >100 ppm
[31].
Single exposures to hydrogen sulfide can cause health
effects in many systems [34]. Hydrogen sulfide has an
odor threshold of 0.01 mg/m3, and humans become in-
sensitive to its odor at concentrations of ≥140 mg/m3 [35,
36]. Respiratory symptoms in asthmatic individuals appear
at about 2.8 mg/m3, but respiratory distress does not seem
to occur <560 mg/m3 [37]. Eye irritation can occur at 5–
29 mg/m3, and metabolic abnormalities may occur at
7 mg/m3 [38]. Neurological symptoms such as fatigue, loss

 of appetite, headache, irritability, poor memory and dizzi-
ness may result following exposures >28 mg/m3 [39], with
death occuring. > 700 mg/m3 [40].
Limited information is available on the pharmacokin-
etics of carbonyl sulfide, which likely metabolizes to car-
bon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide [41]. Acute exposures
result in symptoms similar to those of hydrogen sulfide,
but with less local irritation or olfactory warning [42].
Sublethal exposure can result in profuse salivation, head-
ache, vertigo, amnesia, confusion, nausea, vomiting, diar-
rhea, cardiac arrhythmia, weakness, muscle cramps, and
unconsciousness [43]. Concentrations >1000 ppm can
cause sudden collapse, convulsions, and death from re-
spiratory paralysis.
Respiratory effects in black carbon workers include
cough, sputum production, bronchitis, pneumoconi-
osis, and decrements in lung function, as well as
tiredness, chest pain, headache, and respiratory irrita-
tion [24, 44, 45]. Black carbon may cause discolor-
ation of eyelids and conjunctivae [46], and is possibly
carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B); there is inad-
equate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans, but
sufficient evidence in experimental animals [24].
Aluminum is never found free in nature, and instead
forms metal compounds, complexes, or chelates includ-
ing aluminum oxide [47]. Aluminum and aluminum
oxide do not appear to differ in toxicity [47]. Wheezing,
dyspnea, and impaired lung function, as well as pulmon-
ary fibrosis, have been noted in workers exposed to fine
aluminum dust [48–50]. Dilation and hypertrophy of the
right side of the heart have been seen in workers ex-
posed to aluminum powder, as have decreased red blood
cell hemoglobin and finger clubbing [50]. Helper T-
lymphocyte alveolitis and blastic transformation of per-
ipheral blood lymphocytes in the presence of soluble
aluminum compounds in vitro were found in an individ-
ual exposed to aluminum dust [51]. There is limited evi-
dence
of
carcinogenicity
among
workers;
the
few
existing studies have been confounded by concurrent ex-
posures to known carcinogens, (e.g., tobacco smoke or
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) [52].
Barium titanate is a complex salt containing two
metals, which complicates modeling of its toxicological
properties. In general, exposures to barium salts are as-
sociated with respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal,
musculoskeletal, metabolic and neurologic effects [53].
Barium salts also have a local effect on skin surfaces and
would not likely be absorbed systematically to any great
extent, though this might not be true of barium salt
nanoparticles [53, 54]. Barium titanate could also behave
like a titanium salt in interactions with the human body,
in which case the resulting health effects are essentially
unknown. Only two titanium-containing compounds are
indexed by the U.S Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry (ATSDR) or covered by U.S exposure
limits [55]. It is possible that barium titanate might act
both as a salt of barium and titanium, or as neither; the
toxicological properties of a nanoparticle are influenced
by factors such as particle size, surface area, chemistry
or reactivity, solubility, and shape [54].
Knowledge gap 3: exposure standards and guidelines
Several US agencies and organizations have established
occupational exposure limits (OELs) for sulfate, carbon,
and some metallic substances. While OELs almost uni-
formly assume an 8-h daily exposure period, organiza-
tions use different assumptions and acceptable excess
risk levels when establishing limits. As a result there are
a range of OELs for potential SRM materials, which
complicates the establishment of “safe” global levels.
Additionally, some potential SRM compounds (for ex-
ample, barium titanate) are currently unregulated and/or
have no recognized occupational exposure assessment
procedures. All of these issues apply equally to commu-
nity exposure limits.
The American Conference of Governmental Industrial
Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) for
the potential SRM materials shown in Table 2 are con-
sistently lower than those required by the U.S Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or
recommended by the U.S National Institute for Occupa-
tional Safety and Health (NIOSH) [56, 57] The TLVs and
NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) are
intended to protect the typical worker from any adverse
health effects without consideration of economic or pol-
itical feasibility, while the OSHA limits consider tech-
nical and economic feasibility and are subsequently less
protective [56, 58].
For public exposures – which would likely be wide-
spread following SRM efforts – the EPA, European
Environmental
Agency
(EEA),
and
World
Health
Organization specify regulatory standards for ambient
air quality (Table 3) [57–59]. Importantly, Table 3 shows
a very small sampling of air quality standards in use
around the world that relate to potential SRM materials,
of which the WHO standards may be considered most
generalizable globally. Exposure limits differ substantially
between these agencies, but, more importantly, there are
currently no limits set by any of these agencies for most
of the substances that may be used for SRM [60, 61].
The inconsistencies in established exposure limits for
both occupational and community settings, combined
with the absence of any exposure limits for a number of
potential SRM materials, highlight the issues involved in
protecting workers and the public from unintended
health consequences resulting from SRM deployment.
Since employers have legal control over exposures to
their workers, OELs can be met through implementation
Effiong and Neitzel Environmental Health  (2016) 15:7 
Page 5 of 9
 of engineering controls and use of PPE, whereas use of
PPE is not feasible at a population level, and reductions
in public exposures would have to rely on engineering
controls (e.g., use of air cleaning devices) or administra-
tive controls (e.g., behavior changes). The substantial po-
tential
exposures
and
subsequent
health
impacts
associated with SRM efforts based on stratospheric aero-
sols must be considered further before any attempts are
made at SRM .
Recommendations
In order to be effective, SRM efforts involving strato-
spheric aerosols will require a global effort. Such an action
would represent the first truly global and intentionally-
produced human exposures, and because the benefits and
potential consequences of this action would impact the
entire population of the planet to some degree, we make
the following initial recommendations:
i. Geoengineering cost-benefit analyses should consider
health impacts of SRM.
At present, most assessments of geoengineering
are done within specific and well-defined frame-
works of economics, risk, politics, and environ-
mental ethics [62]. Literature on the potential
human health impacts of SRM is scant, and such
impacts have not been adequately factored into
previous cost-benefit analyses [63]. We recom-
mend that subsequent cost-benefit analyses for
geoengineering explicitly consider health impacts
of SRM [64]. Assessments should further com-
pare the expected health benefits that may result
from SRM efforts to potential adverse health

 outcomes, including (but not limited to) those
described here.
ii. Further research is needed on methods of assessment
of exposures to, and evaluation of toxicological
properties of, potential SRM materials.
We have noted gaps in current scientific knowledge
related to occupational and community exposures
that would result from SRM, as well to the
toxicological properties of potential SRM materials.
Additional laboratory- and field-based research is
needed in these areas, particularly with regard to
exposure characterization and the spatial and tem-
poral movement of SRM materials from the strato-
sphere to ground level. While it is difficult to
develop exposure and toxicological models which
are representative of a decades- or centuries-long
SRM deployment, these efforts are critical to ensure
that reasonable, validated models of exposures and
human health impacts are available prior to any
SRM deployment.
iii. Strict
and
harmonized
global
occupational
and
community exposure limits are needed for SRM
materials.
Tables 2 and 3 illustrate the divergence and
incompleteness of current occupational and
community exposure limits regarding potential SRM
materials. Since exposures will inherently be global in
nature, exposure limits must be harmonized to ensure
that individuals around the world are given equal
protection from adverse health effects. Global
harmonization of standards related to SRM represents
an immense but necessary bureaucratic and scientific
challenge, and an important step towards establishing
a formal governance framework for geoengineering. A
global discussion of standards harmonization relating
to SRM may result in other tangible benefits to
society, including the potential evolution of a common
language and framework for risk assessment and a
debate on the strengths and weaknesses of different
approaches to risk management.
iv. Reversal mechanisms should be identified prior to
any SRM deployment
In the event that substantial health impacts are noted
following deployment of stratospheric aerosol
approaches to SRM, mechanisms for capturing the
aerosols to halt further ground-level exposures through
gravitational deposition will be needed. Therefore, if
stratospheric aerosols are pursued as a viable SRM
strategy, such mechanisms will need to be identified
and evaluated prior to large-scale deployment.
Conclusion
Although there is very little agreement in the scientific
community on the approach to SRM-related technologies,
SRM has been identified as a potentially technically feas-
ible and possibly cost-effective method of geoengineering
to reduce or reverse anthropogenically-driven climate
change [1, 62]. But even as much is being done to unravel
the scientific and technical challenges around geoengi-
neering, and there is substantial evidence that a host of
adverse human health effects will directly result from cli-
mate change, very little has been done to describe the po-
tential human health impacts of this emerging disruptive
technology. We have described the potential occupational
and public health impacts of inadvertent exposure to po-
tential SRM materials, and have also speculated on the
possible health impacts of exposure to barium titanate
using knowledge of similar nanomaterials.
Based on our analyses, we submit that the current
knowledge gaps do not justify deployment of SRM in the
short term. We therefore recommend further research, a
more inclusive analysis of costs and benefits, as well as
the globalization and harmonization of regulatory stan-
dards that will limit the negative human health impact
of SRM. Only following a comprehensive risk assess-
ment that addresses each of these issues can the poten-
tial benefits of this geoengineering approach be weighed
against the potential public health burdens created by
this technology.
