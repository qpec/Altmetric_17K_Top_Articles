Abstract
Purpose: A variety of retinal topographical changes occur after internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling for macular holes
including a movement of the fovea toward the optic nerve. This study was carried out to assess the effect of the extent of ILM-
peeled area on these changes and postoperative visual acuity. Methods: Prospective single-center study of a consecutive series of
patients undergoing macular hole surgery. Preoperative and postoperative optical coherence tomography images were used to
assess a variety of measures of retinal morphology. Transmission electron microscopy of the peeled ILM was used to assess
residual retinal and vitreous side debris. The area of the ILM peeled was calculated from intraoperative images. Results: Fifty-six
eyes of 56 patients were included. The mean area of ILM peeled was 9.5 mm2 (2.4-28.3 mm2). The mean disc-to-fovea distance
(DFD) preoperatively was 3703 mm with a mean reduction of 52 mm postoperatively, representing a change of �1.29% with a
wide range of �7.04% to 1.36%. Using stepwise linear regression, ILM-peeled area was significantly associated with a change in
DFD (P < .001), extent of a dissociated optic nerve fiber layer appearance (P < .001), and postoperative visual acuity (P ¼ .025).
Nasotemporal retinal thickness asymmetry was associated with the minimum linear diameter (P < .001). Conclusion: The
ILM-peeled area has a significant effect on changes in retinal topography and postoperative visual acuity separate from macular
hole size. Further study is needed to assess the effect of ILM peeled size on visual function and to guide clinical practice.

Introduction
Peeling of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) has been
proven to improve the closure rate of macular holes when
combined with vitrectomy and gas tamponade.1 There is no
consensus regarding the extent of the area of ILM that should
optimally be peeled, and peel radii of 0.5 to 3 disc diameters
(DDs) have been described.2 A variety of retinal changes after
ILM peeling occur, including a movement of the fovea toward
the optic nerve head, which has been associated with thicken-
ing of the nasal retina and thinning of the temporal retina.3,4
The retinal movement is centripetal but with greater movement
in the horizontal meridian than vertical, and greater movement
of the temporal retina toward the disc than nasal.4,5 The
observed retinal displacement has been related to the extent
of postoperative metamorphopsia and also the postoperative
appearance of a dissociated optic nerve fiber layer (DONFL).5,6
The factors that control the extent of these changes are incom-
pletely understood. The extent of the retinal movement has
been correlated with the size of the macular hole.4 We have
also recently related the extent of DONFL to the extent of
Muller cell fragments on the retinal side of the ILM.7 We
postulated that the size of the ILM-peeled area (ILM PA) could
also have an effect on these changes and other postoperative
outcomes and explored this possibility further in a consecutive
cohort of patients undergoing surgery.
Methods
Consecutive patients undergoing surgery by 1 surgeon for idio-
pathic macular holes were included in the study. The study
followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, with
approval from the local institutional review board. Informed
consent was obtained from the participants after explanation of
the nature of the study. Patients with traumatic macular holes,

 an axial length of greater than 26 mm, previous retinal surgery,
second eyes, less than 3-month follow-up, inadequate imaging,
or those in whom the hole failed to close were excluded. Holes
were considered closed, indicating anatomical success, if there
was a complete circumferential hole rim reattachment without
a full-thickness foveal neurosensory retinal defect demon-
strated on optical coherence tomography (OCT). All patients
underwent transconjunctival 25- or 27-gauge vitrectomy using
wide-field noncontact viewing with combined phacoemulsifi-
cation and intraocular lens implantation if phakic. Brilliant
Blue G (ILM Blue; DORC International, the Netherlands) was
used to stain the ILM and peeled using a pinch technique and
25-gauge end-gripping forceps (Grieshaber revolution DSP
ILM forceps; Alcon Grieshaber AG, Schaffhausen, Switzer-
land). A peel radius of approximately 0.5 to 1.5 DDs was
aimed for. The peeled ILM was removed from the eye and
placed in glutaraldehyde for analysis by transmission electron
microscopy.
Either 25% SF6 or 20% C2F6 gas was used as a tamponade,
and the patients instructed to position facedown for 3 days. All
surgeries were recorded via a beam splitter from the micro-
scope (OPMI Lumera T; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena,
Germany) and a digital recorder (Medlife Mind Stream; Carl
Zeiss Meditec AG). At the end of each peeling procedure, care
was taken to obtain a well-centered clear sequence of the
peeled area. Patients were reviewed at 4 months postopera-
tively. Preoperative and postoperative best corrected visual
acuity at 3 months was measured using a standard Snellen
acuity chart and converted to logarithm of minimum angle of
resolution (logMAR) scores for the purposes of statistical
analysis.
Patients underwent spectral domain OCT on the Heidelberg
Spectralis immediately preoperatively and at 3 months post-
operatively. A high-density central horizontal scanning proto-
col with 30 mm line spacing was used in the central 15�, as well
as a broader 20� � 30� horizontal line scan pattern with a line
spacing of 240 mm. All scans used a 25 automatic real-time
setting enabling multisampling and noise reduction over
25 images and were matched to a corresponding high-quality
768 � 768 pixel, 30� infrared image. The follow-up images
were registered to the baseline image using the Spectralis Auto-
Rescan function.
Image Measurements
On the preoperative OCT, the position of the center of the hole
was marked and the minimum linear diameter (MLD) and base
diameter (BD) of the hole measured. An identifiable landmark
on the temporal disc margin where it was crossed by a vessel
was chosen and the distance from the foveal center to this point
measured using the Spectralis measuring tools (disc-to-fovea
distance [DFD]). Three vessel bifurcations were then chosen
approximately 1.5 DDs superior, inferior, and temporal to the
fovea. The distance between the inferior and superior points
(vertical gap [VG]) and between the temporal bifurcation and
the optic disc landmark (horizontal gap [HG]) were then
measured. The mean of the VG and HG was then used to
calculate the area of this virtual circle, which we termed the
‘‘macular area’’ (MA). These measurements were then
repeated using the same landmarks on the postoperative OCT.
In this case, the foveal center was taken as the point of minimal
retinal thickness and sometimes also accompanied by a small
outer retinal defect.
The difference between the preoperative and postoperative
MA was calculated and expressed as a percentage change com-
pared to baseline. The same calculation was performed for
DFD change (Figure 1).
The thickness of the retina was measured from the inner
retinal surface to the retinal pigment epithelium at points 1.5
mm nasal and 1.5 mm temporal to the fovea using the Spec-
tralis measuring tools preoperatively and postoperatively. A
value which we called the nasal–temporal difference (NTD)
was calculated as the change in nasal retinal thickness minus
the change in temporal retinal thickness (Figure 1).
The fellow eyes of 10 randomly selected patients in the
study without macular pathology and with less than 1 diopter
of anisometropia were used as controls for the retinal measure-
ment technique and any variability with repeat scanning. The
recording of the intraoperative video was imported into a video
editing program, a snapshot image of a well-centered postpeel
view saved, and this then imported into the image viewing
software GIMP (version 2.8; www.gimp.org). The ILM PA
was calculated using the actual vertical DD taken from OCT
to calibrate the measurements.
Quantifying DONFL
The number of focal depressions characteristic of DONFL in
the retinal surface was counted in each slice of the 3-month
postoperative 20� � 30� OCT and summed to produce a total
DONFL score as previously described.8 The technique is
shown in Figure 2, and the relationship between red-free and
en face images was shown for illustrative purposes. We also
calculated the number of dimples per mm2 using the peeled
area in each case.
One observer, masked to their previous count, counted the
depressions on 2 occasions. There was high concordance
between the 2 counts, with a correlation coefficient of 0.92.
The measurements showed no systematic relationship with the
extent of DONFL, and the repeatability coefficient was 2.2,
which we considered clinically acceptable.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
The ILM samples were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M
sodium cacodylate buffer. The ILM was enrobed in agarose
[4%] at low melting point to form a small block to make the
ILM easier to handle. After secondary fixation in 2% osmium
tetroxide, the samples were dehydrated in graded acetone,
embedded in epoxy resin, and polymerized at 60�C. Ultrathin
sections of 70 nm were taken at 2 levels through the block,
stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed on a

 Philips CM100 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Phi-
lips/FEI Corp, Holland, the Netherlands). Detailed examination
of the tissue was then performed to determine the occurrence of
any cellular debris on the retinal and vitreous sides of the ILM.
For estimation of the amount of cellular debris, images were
taken at �7900 from 14 randomly sampled areas of the ILM.
An unbiased method was used to quantify the amount of debris
on the retinal side of the ILM as previously described.9 The
same technique was used for estimation of the extent of vitr-
eous side material present on the ILM.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive and statistical analysis was performed using Mini-
tab 16 statistical package (Minitab Ltd, Coventry, United King-
dom). Pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables are presented in
terms of mean, standard deviation, and range when normally
distributed; median, interquartile range, and range when not
normally distributed; and percentage as appropriate.
Paired t tests and w2 tests were used to compare the contin-
uous and categorical variables, respectively, between the pre-
operative and postoperative measurements. Statistical
significance was considered with a P value of .05 or less.
Association between continuous data was assessed using
correlations and association between categorical data using
2-sample t tests or analysis of variance. Stepwise linear mod-
eling was then used on the percentage change in DFD, percent-
age change in macular area, NTD, postoperative visual acuity,
postoperative minimal foveal thickness, and the extent of
DONFL represented by the total DONFL score, to pick out the
most important preoperative and intraoperative variables.
Results
During the study period, 69 patients (72 eyes) underwent sur-
gery. Sixteen were excluded for incomplete follow-up (2),
inadequate imaging (10), nonclosure (1), and second eye status
(3) leaving 56 eyes for analysis. Of these, 41 eyes had the ILM
examined by TEM. The baseline features are show in Table 1.
There was a significant correlation between BD and MLD
(R ¼ 0.76; P < .001) and between both variables and preopera-
tive visual acuity (R ¼ 0.45 and 0.53; P < .001 for both). No
other preoperative variables were significantly associated with
each other, and specifically, the size of the ILM PA was not
correlated with the size of the macular hole.
The mean area of ILM peeled was *10 mm2 equating to a
peel radius of 1.8 mm, that is, approximately 1 DDs. However,
there was a wide range of ILM PAs ranging from *2.4 mm2
(*1/2 DD peel radius) to *28 mm2 (*2 DDs in radius).
The visual acuity improved from a mean of 0.93 logMAR
preoperatively to 0.36 postoperatively (Table 2). The mean
nasal retinal thickness increased by 16 mm and the mean tem-
poral thickness reduced by 21 mm, resulting in a mean NTD of
þ37 mm, but with a wide range of �13 mm (representing a
thinning of the nasal retina and thickening of the temporal
retina) to þ96 mm.
The mean DFD preoperatively was 3703 mm with a mean
reduction of 52 mm postoperatively, representing a change of
�1.29% with a wide range of �7.04% to 1.36%. The MA
similarly reduced by a mean of 0.38% with a range of
�5.14% to 2.8%.
The fellow eyes used as controls showed a low level of varia-
bility preoperatively and postoperatively, representing a high
level of test–retest reliability (Table 3). Using stepwise linear
regression, the association between the preoperative and intrao-
perative variables and the postoperative outcomes was analyzed.
For percentage change in DFD, the only significant vari-
able associated was peel area (P < .001; R2 ¼ 25.8%; Figure

 3). The greater the peel area, the greater the reduction in DFD
observed.
For percentage change in MA, peel area was strongly asso-
ciated (P < .001) as well as age (P ¼ .019) and the amount of
vitreous side debris on the ILM (P ¼ .045; R2 ¼46.7%). The
greater the peel area, age, and the vitreous side debris, the
greater the reduction in macular area (Figure 4).
For NTD, MLD (P < .001) and male sex (P ¼ .001) were
associated (R2 ¼ 47.1%). The extent of DONFL was associated
with peel area (P < .001), BD (P ¼ .014), and retinal debris
(P ¼ .012; R2 ¼ 67.2%; Figure 5). Peel area was not significant
when the same analysis was performed for DONFL per mm2.
For postoperative visual acuity, the significantly associated
variables were the duration of the hole (P ¼ .002), BD
(P ¼ .038), and peel area (P ¼ .025; R2 ¼ 46.7%).
Discussion
The extent of the area of ILM removed was strongly associated
with a number of postoperative changes including a shortening
of the DFD, a reduction in the virtual measure of ‘‘macular
area,’’ the extent of DONFL observed, and importantly the
postoperative visual acuity.
Ohta et al observed in 2010 that after ILM peeling and
macular hole closure, there was a change in the relative thick-
nesses of the parafoveal retina, with a thickening of the nasal
retina and thinning of the temporal retina.3 Subsequently, oth-
ers have reported a variety of changes including a reduction in
DFD and a centripetal movement of the parafoveal retina
toward the disc and fovea.4,10
The ILM forms the inner boundary of the retina and is con-
sidered the basement membrane of the Muller cells but is formed
from proteins shed into the vitreous cavity during embryogenesis
from the lens and ciliary body.11 Its thickness varies across the
fovea reaching a maximum at 1000 mm from the foveal center of
around 4 mm.12 Although thin, its mechanical strength is in the
megapascal range similar to articular cartilage and about a 1000-
fold stronger than cell layers, forming at least 50% of retinal
rigidity.13,14 Its removal reduces retinal compliance, and as
Ishida et al showed, being anchored at the optic disc, after peel-
ing there is a movement of the temporal retina toward the disc.4

 Previous studies have found a large range of induced retinal
movement. For example, Nakagomi et al found a reduction in
DFD of �4.7% but with a range of �9.24% to 0.38%.6 How-
ever, these studies did not investigate the association between
these induced changes and ILM PA. Indeed, it is perhaps intui-
tive that peeling ILM over a larger area will result in increased
retinal movement, and we found a mean reduction in DFD of
�1.29% with a range of �7.04% to 1.36%, which was strongly
associated with ILM PA. Interestingly, Nakagomi et al aimed
for an ILM peel diameter of 3 to 4 DDs equating to a large peel
area, which would account for the difference in mean value.6
The same discussion likely relates to MA. Rodrigues et al
found a reduction in macular area with a mean of �7.6% after
macular hole surgery compared to our mean change of
�0.38%.5 Again, differences in the size of ILM PA may
explain this but also differences in methodology for the mea-
surement of MA. Indeed, the location of the points chosen for
measuring the perimeter of the macular area is likely to have an
effect on changes in its area. Ishida et al showed that the
temporal retina undergoes greater movement postoperatively
than the nasal retina.4 Also, points chosen within the ILM PA
may move differently to those chosen outside the perimeter of
the peel, with residual peripheral ILM and any adherent vitr-
eous, acting to ‘‘pull’’ tissue toward it centrifugally while
tissue more centrally moves centripetally. Interestingly, we
found a weak association between the amount of vitreous
debris on the peeled ILM and the change in MA, which adds
weight to this hypothesis.
We found that change in DFD and MA was related to each
other and also to the extent of DONFL, which in turn were all
related to ILM PA. Nakagomi et al related change in DFD to
DONFL with a greater reduction in DFD being associated with
a more frequent observation of DONFL and hypothesized that
the appearance of DONFL was related to the retinal slippage
occurring after surgery.6 We found that a greater peel area was
associated with a greater number of dimples on OCT charac-
teristic of DONFL. However, when the number of dimples per
unit area of ILM PA was analyzed, the associations disap-
peared, suggesting that the association is only related to the
absolute number of dimples not their density. We have previ-
ously showed an association between the extent and size of
retina side debris on the ILM and the extent of DONFL, and
we corroborated this finding in this study with retinal debris
again being associated with the extent of DONFL.7
We didn’t find a relationship between the change in retinal
asymmetry, which we quantified by NTD, and ILM PA. We did
find, however, that NTD postoperatively was associated with
MLD and male sex. Ishida et al also found an association of
retinal thickness asymmetry with macular hole size albeit basal
diameter.4 It is interesting that we didn’t find an association
between DFD and NTD and no association between DFD and
macular hole size. Similarly, neither Ishida et al nor Nakagomi
et al found an association between the DFD and macular hole
size, and our findings suggest that macular hole size is more
important in determining retinal thickness asymmetry, while
ILM PA governs DFD and MA changes to a greater extent.4,6
The association between NTD and male sex is also noteworthy.
Population studies have shown that men have greater macular
thickness and greater choroidal thickness than women in the
central foveal areas with steeper foveal pits, which may have
etiological significance for our findings.15,16 Furthermore,
women have been previously shown to have larger holes on
average than men, which we also found (343 mm in MLD for
women vs 268 mm for men, P ¼ .03).17
There are currently no prescribed parameters for the opti-
mum extent of ILM to be peeled during surgery for macular
holes. It has been observed that enlarging ILM PA can result in
hole closure in failed cases undergoing revision surgery, and
some authors have argued for large ILM PAs in all cases.18 It is
striking however that the 7 holes in this series between 450 and
550 mm in MLD had ILM PAs of 5 to 7 mm2 (ie, less than 1 DD
in radius) and all closed. There have been 2 recent trials com-
paring different sizes of ILM peel radii. Modi et al carried out a
prospective study of 50 patients undergoing surgery with ILM
peel radii of 1 and 1.5 DDs.19 They found no significant dif-
ference in hole closure rates but better visual results in the
smaller peel radii group with less retinal nerve fiber layer thin-
ning particularly temporally. Although we found that hole
duration has the strongest association with postoperative visual
acuity, we also found a significant association between peel
area and visual acuity. Pilli et al found an association between
inner retinal volume in the macular and postoperative visual
outcome,20 and other authors have reported reduced retinal
sensitivity in the peeled area and paracentral scotomata.21,22
Conversely, Bae et al carried out a randomized controlled study
of 65 eyes with ILM peeling radii of 0.75 and 1.5 DDs.23 They
found no difference in visual outcomes but did find a benefit of
larger peels with regard to an improvement in metamorphopsia.
Currently, it is thus unclear as to the extent of ILM that should
be optimally peeled during surgery for macular holes. We
found a high rate of closure with widely differing peel areas,
but hypothetically, there may be a minimum ILM PA for a set
size of macular hole to allow enough reduced retinal compli-
ance to permit closure. This area may vary with hole chronicity
and other factors. Larger ILM peels would ensure that this
threshold was passed but at the expense of greater inner retinal
changes and potentially reduced visual function.
We acknowledge that this study has several weaknesses. It
was a retrospective observational study and the size of the ILM
peel was not predetermined. A peel radius of approximately
0.5 to 1.5 DDs was aimed for, but wide variability in peel
radius was achieved based on the ease of peel, field of view,
and size of eye. The range of ILM PAs we observed was there-
fore not evenly distributed across a range of sizes. We did not
quantify metamorphopsia in our cohort so are unable to com-
ment on the effect of ILM PA on relief of distortion. The
strengths of the study include the fact that a single surgeon
performed all the surgery with a single technique minimizing
confounding variables. Baseline scans were matched to post-
operative scans allowing more accurate measurements. Histol-
ogy was performed to assess the effect of ILM-related variables
on outcome. The fellow eyes used as controls showed a low
32

 level of variability preoperatively and postoperatively, verify-
ing that the changes we observed were surgically induced.
In conclusion, ILM PA has a significant effect on retinal
topography postoperatively. Further study is needed to assess
the effect of these differences on visual function and to guide
clinical practice as to an optimum ILM PA for surgeons to aim
for in any particular case.
