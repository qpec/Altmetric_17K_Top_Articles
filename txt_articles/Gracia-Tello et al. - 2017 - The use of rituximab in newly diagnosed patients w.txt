ABSTRACT
Background: Previous reports indicate that treating
patients with lupus (SLE) at or close to the time of
diagnosis successfully without using any, or minimal,
corticosteroids by using B-cell depletion (BCD) is
possible in the short-term. It is not however known
whether using BCD is as effective or reduces
corticosteroid use in the long-term. We report the
long-term (up to 7 years) use of BCD with respect to
its steroid-saving capacity and clinical effectiveness in
newly diagnosed SLE.
Methods: Sixteen female patients with SLE were
treated at, or shortly after diagnosis, with BCD therapy
(BCDT) minimising the routine use of oral steroids.
Post-treatment, most patients were given
hydroxychloroquine (n=14) and azathioprine (n=10).
The British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)
disease activity index was used for clinical
assessment. Serum antidouble-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
antibodies, complement (C3), erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR), circulating B lymphocytes
(CD19+) and total inmmunoglobulins were tested every
2–6 months (average of 4.5 years) (SD 2) post-
treatment. Disease activity and steroid requirement
were compared with three patients with SLE treated
conventionally, each matched for ethnicity, sex, age,
clinical features, disease duration at diagnosis and
follow-up period.
Results: All patients given rituximab achieved BCD.
The mean number of flares during follow-up (new
BILAG A or B) was 2.63 (SD 3) in the BCDT group and
4 (SD 3.6) in the controls (NS, p=0.14). Post-BCDT,
mean anti-dsDNA antibody level fell from 1114 U/mL
(SD 1699.3) to 194 (SD 346.7) at 18 months
(p=0.043), mean serum ESR fell by >70% at 6 months
maintained during follow-up and serum C3 level
normalised in 8 patients. The mean cumulative
prednisolone dose at 60 months for the patients who
underwent BCDT (n=11) was 4745.67 mg (SD
6090 mg) vs 12 553.92 mg (SD 12 672 mg) for the
controls (p=0.01).
Conclusions: Early treatment of patients with SLE
with BCDT is safe, effective and enables a reduction in
steroid use.
INTRODUCTION
SLE is an autoimmune rheumatic disorder
associated with a wide spectrum of clinical
features.1 2 Randomised controlled trials in
SLE are limited, and its treatment usually
includes
glucocorticosteroids
(GC)
and
hydroxychloroquine for mild to moderate
disease and immunosuppressives if severe.3 4
Long-term use of GC and immunosuppres-
sives often leads to side effects that increase
morbidity and mortality.5 6 Several longitu-
dinal studies, notably those reported by the
Systemic Lupus International Collaborating
Clinics (SLICC) group have indicated that
corticosteroids
are
the
main
cause
of
damage. Thus, the mean SLICC/American
College of Rheumatology (ACR) Damage
Index (DI) rose from 0.33 at baseline to 1.9
after 15 years of follow-up in an inception
cohort. Damage was considered as definitely
GC-related in 16% and 49% of cases at base-
line
and
last
follow-up,
respectively.7
In
another study, the accrual of organ damage
correlated with the mean daily prednisone
dose, the risk increasing for doses >6 mg/
day.8 Every 1-point increase in DI was asso-
ciated with a 1.32 times more risk to die
during follow-up.9
To limit GC toxicity, lower oral doses have
been successfully used in lupus nephritis
(LN)
trials,10
Other
immunosuppressives,
such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF) or cyclophosphamide, are often pre-
scribed in part as steroid-sparing agents.11
The availability of biologic agents, notably
rituximab (RTX) offers the prospect of an
alternative steroid-sparing regime.12
B cells play a pivotal role in the pathogen-
esis of SLE.13 Apart from being responsible
for autoantibody production, they produce
cytokines and chemokines and may act as

 antigen-presenting cells. Anti-B-cell therapy has been
widely used to treat SLE. B-cell depletion (BCD) has
usually been achieved using RTX, a chimeric anti-CD20
monoclonal antibody often combined with GC and
cyclophosphamide.14
The efficacy and relative safety of BCD in SLE was sug-
gested by open-label and retrospective studies with good
clinical response seen in many patients.
These studies were performed in patients with diverse
manifestations notably those for whom conventional
treatment
had
been
of
limited
benefit
or
caused
unacceptable side effects. Following our small study of
eight patients followed from diagnosis for 6 months,
Condon et al15 evaluated the effectiveness of treating LN
with RTX and MMF at diagnosis. They suggested that
oral steroids can be avoided in LN without apparent
reduction in efficacy or increase in relapse rates, for up
to 3 years.
We now report the long-term (up to 7 years) conse-
quences of BCD therapy (BCDT) in 16 newly diagnosed,
mostly non-renal patients with SLE as first-line treat-
ment. We have assessed the long-term GC saving and
clinical effectiveness of this approach.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study design and patients
From October 2008 to October 2014, 16 patients with
SLE were treated at, or within 3 months of diagnosis,
with BCDT aiming to minimise the routine use of oral
steroids. Three patients had been given the option to
have BCDT or to be treated with conventional treat-
ment
including
steroids,
hydroxychloroquine
and
immunosuppressives.
We have compared two groups of patients with SLE
from University College Hospital. Those patients treated
with a defined protocol using BCDT and with at least
1 year follow-up were compared with those from the ‘his-
toric cohort’ (HC) treated conventionally (usually with
steroids). Each of the 16 patients who underwent BCDT
was closely matched for ethnicity, sex, age, clinical fea-
tures, disease duration at diagnosis and length of
follow-up with three patients from the HC. Virtually all
of the disease controls were treated with conventional
therapy during the follow-up period of the BCDT-
treated parties.
The groups were followed for an average of 4.56 years
(range 1–7 years).
Patients were excluded if they had previously received
previous prolonged treatment notably GC, hydroxychlor-
oquine or immunosuppressive therapy. Two of the
patients treated with RTX (patients 6 and 12) had
received an intramuscular depomedrone 120 mg injec-
tion 2 months before BCDT. Another presented initially
elsewhere with active SLE, having been under our care
with
an
undifferentiated
autoimmune
rheumatic
disease. There she was given high-dose oral steroids for
2 weeks before being transferred to our department for
BCD. A third patient had a delayed admission for BCD.
Unfortunately, she was admitted as an emergency with
active SLE and a concurrent lower respiratory tract infec-
tion. She was treated with antibiotics and intravenous
methylprednisolone (MP) 750 mg ×3, and was dis-
charged prematurely before she could receive BCD. In
total, five patients were treated with oral corticosteroids
prior to the infusion of RTX, for a mean of 5.8 weeks
(range 1–16 weeks) and a maximum of 730 mg cumulative
dose pre-BCDT (patient 2). The treatment was initiated by
their general practitioner or the rheumatologist prior to
the patient being admitted for BCDT
. Eight patients
received no GC until they were admitted for BCD.
All patients fulfilled at least four of the revised ACR
criteria for the classification of SLE and gave informed
consent to treatment before being included in our
database.16
BCDT protocol
The standard BCDT treatment protocol used was a com-
bination of 1 g of RTX on days 1 and 14 and 750 mg of
cyclophosphamide (CYC) on day 2. Three patients did
not receive CYC with their RTX treatment, and one
patient received 500 mg of CYC with the second dose of
RTX rather than the first, as she was neutropenic before
treatment. One patient received a further 750 mg of
CYC with the second RTX dose. MP 100 mg intravenous
was administered before each RTX dose.
All patients were followed regularly every 2–6 months.
Maintenance therapy was given with the lowest possible
prednisone
dose,
hydroxychloroquine
(n=14)
and
azathioprine (n=11) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
(n=3).
When possible, oral steroids were avoided altogether.
During follow-up, four patients had to repeat with RTX
due to B-cell repopulation, accompanied by a flare, with
an average of 21.8 months after the initial dose.
There were no major infections or serious adverse
events in patients given BCDT.
HC treatment
In 41 of the 48 patients in the HC, prednisolone was
prescribed. Hydroxychloroquine was used in 42 as first-
line treatment. During follow-up, hydroxychloroquine
was stopped in one patient due to gastrointestinal side
effects. Azathioprine was used in 21 patients (43.8%)
and MMF in 9 (18.8%). Six patients were given metho-
trexate and nine (18.8%) treated with cyclophospha-
mide to manage flares.
Variables studied
BCD was considered to have been achieved once the
absolute CD19 count decreased to <0.005×109/L after
treatment.

 erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), circulating B lym-
phocytes
(CD19+) and total
immunoglobulins were
tested every 2–6 months for an average of 4.5 years (SD
2) post-treatment.
The classic British Isles Lupus Assessment Group
(BILAG) disease activity index was used for clinical
assessment.17 The BILAG index was used for both indi-
vidual organ system assessment and also as a global
index A score in any of the eight organ systems=12
points, B=5, C=1 and D/E=0. Four of the controls were
lost after moving abroad (2.5 years in the control
number 3 of patient 1, 1.5 years in the control 3 of
patient 6, 1.5 years in control 3 of patient 7 and 1 year in
control 3 of patient 12). The SLICC/ACR DI in SLE was
calculated in both groups at the end of the follow-up.
The cumulated prednisolone dose was calculated at 1,
3 and 6 months and subsequently every 6 months during
follow-up in both groups.
Clinical and laboratory data were collected prospect-
ively. Treatment efficacy was evaluated on the basis of
improvement in both clinical and laboratory features.
Data at 12 months were available for all patients. At
24 months data were available for 14 treated with RTX
and 42 of the HC. Data at 3 years were available for 13
patients who underwent BCDT and for 39 controls. Data
at 5 years were available for 11 and 33 patients, respect-
ively. The maximum follow-up was of 84 months for two
patients treated with RTX and six controls.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive data were generated. Univariate comparisons
between both cohorts were performed using χ2 test or
the Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate, for qualitative vari-
ables, unpaired Student’s t-test for quantitative variables
with normal distribution and Mann-Whitney U test for
quantitative variables with non-normal distribution.
The outcome of both cohorts was compared by several
means. Statistical significance was calculated between
serological markers of disease activity, immunoglobulins,
change in the global BILAG score and cumulative
steroid dose at follow-up.
RESULTS
Patient population
Sixteen patients were treated with the RTX protocol as
the ‘first-line’ therapy. Follow-up data for a median
follow-up of 4.5 years (SD 2; range 1–7 years) were avail-
able. The total patient population (BCDT and conven-
tionally treated patients) consisted of 36 Caucasians
(56%),
16
African-Caribbeans
(25%)
and
12
South-Asian and/or Chinese (19%).
The baseline characteristics of all patients who under-
went BCDT are shown in table 1. The median age of the
patients was 34.38 years (range 21–50 years) in the RTX
group and 34.67 years (SD 9.2) in the HC (p=0.626).
Median symptom duration before SLE diagnosis was
6 weeks (range 2–384 weeks). One patient (patient 2)
had been managed by the dermatologists for 5 years
with discoid lupus, Raynaud’s phenomenon and arthral-
gia. During this period, there were no supporting labora-
tory investigations or other clinical features to make a
diagnosis of SLE. However, after referral to rheumatol-
ogy with worsening symptoms including joint inflamma-
tion, a diagnosis of SLE was confirmed.
At diagnosis, all patients who underwent BCDT (B-cell
depletion-treated patients (BCDTp)) had joint involve-
ment, 11 had skin manifestations and 3 had serositis. No
patients treated with RTX had any gastrointestinal or
central nervous system manifestations. Two had renal
lupus confirmed on biopsy. In the HC, a similar distribu-
tion is evident with 92% had joint involvement (p=0.23)
almost 60% (p=0.46) had skin manifestations, with sero-
sitis in 15 (p=0.34). Renal lupus was present in nine
patients (p=0.57). Two of the HC had autoimmune
hepatitis (p=0.41). A detailed comparison of the BCDT
and conventionally treated patients is shown in table 2.
Comparing both groups, no significant differences in
initial clinical manifestations distribution were observed.
Serological markers of disease activity
Circulating B lymphocytes (CD19+)
After 6 months of treatment with RTX, 15 patients
maintained circulating B lymphocyte depletion mea-
sured by CD19+ with a mean of 0.03±0.023×109/L. The
patient who repopulated at 6 months (CD19+ count:
0.121×109/L)
showed
no
sign
of
activity.
At
the
12 months follow-up (n=13), all the patients analysed
remained B-cell depleted (mean of 0.036±0.07×109/L),
although two patients (patient 11 and 14) had required
further RTX at 8 months because of a flare, both with
successful CD19+ B cell depletion.
At 2 years, five of the nine patients remained B-cell
depleted with a partial recovery in the CD19+ B-cell
number. Only one had needed retreatment with RTX.
In one case (patient 3), the depletion persisted until
72 months of follow-up (CD19+ 0.009×109/L) with no
further cycle of RTX needed.
During follow-up, four patients required a new cycle
of RTX due to the repopulation of the CD19+ B cells
and a clinical recurrence. It was successful in three for
an average of 15 months. One patient (patient 10),
despite maintaining BCD, needed a new cycle of RTX
given the persistence of clinical manifestations 5 months
after the first treatment.
Inflammatory markers
At diagnosis, the mean ESR in the BCDTp was 62.13
±41.5 mm/hour and 32.89±29.8 mm/hour in the HC
(p=0.005). At 6 months, the mean ESR fell to 25.94
±14.8 mm/hour in the BCDTp and 21.06±18.5 mm/
hour in the HC. These values were maintained with a
steady decline with no significant differences throughout
follow-up (table 3).
Thirteen out of 16 BCDTp had elevated of anti-dsDNA
antibody levels at baseline mean=1113.87±1699.4 IU/mL.

 In the HC, the mean was 129±233 IU/mL (p=0.001). Six
months later, the means were 551.38±983.9 IU/mL in
BCDTp
and
91.37±206.5 IU/mL
in
the
HC.
This
decrease in both groups was maintained throughout the
follow-up (table 3), with an average of 53.64±58.5 IU/mL
in the BCDTp and 76.44±80.9 IU/mL in the HC at
5 years of follow-up.
Only one of the patients in the BCDTp showed
increased anti-dsDNA levels during follow-up (patient 6)
associated with persistent SLE manifestations despite
treatment.
Twelve BCDTp had low complement levels (C3) at
baseline. At diagnosis, the mean C3 levels were 0.68
±0.3 g/L in BCDTp and 1.22±1.76 g/L in HC. These
values showed a significant increase in the BCDTp
reaching
0.869±0.3 g/L
at
6 months.
During
the
follow-up (table 3), the BDCTp had a continuous
increase of C3 levels until a maximum of 1.21±0.42 g/L
at 60 months. In the HC, complement levels were stable
throughout the follow-up (table 3).
During follow-up, eight patients from BCDTp experi-
enced a progressive increase of C3 levels until normalis-
ing for at least 12 consecutive months. The mean time
to complement normalisation was 12.75 months.
Finally, the IgG levels showed no significant differ-
ences at diagnosis or during the follow-up in both

 groups. At diagnosis, the BCDTp mean was 17.8±6.09
and 17.8±4.3 g/L in the HC (p=0.98). These values were
decreasing progressively to a final average of 10.34
±5.4 g/L in the BCDTp and 12.14±3 g/L in the HC at
2 years of follow-up and 5.2±9.35 and 10.2±2.2 g/L,
respectively at 5. Overall, IgG levels remained within the
normal range throughout the RTX courses. Only one
BCDTp (patient 9) showed lower levels of IgG prior to
treatment and subsequently during the follow-up. No
statistical differences were observed between the two
groups.
Activity disease measured by BILAG score
At diagnosis, mean BILAG global score was 26.68 points
(range 12–45) for the BCDTp and 11.08 for the HC. In
both groups, the items causing a higher score at diagno-
sis were related to musculoskeletal manifestations (mean
7.25 in the BCDTp and 2.8 in the HC) followed by
mucocutaneous manifestations (mean 2.8 and 1.69,
respectively). The mean decrease in global BILAG at
6 months for the BCDTp was –10.8 (range 0–34).
Flares during the follow-up were defined as new
BILAG A or B in any of the organs/systems. The global
average flares were 2.63 (SD 3.01) in the BCDTp and
4.00 (SD 3.61) in the HC (p=0.14). The BCDT group
had an average of 0.58 flares/year and 0.85 flares/year
were noted in the control group. This is not statistically
significantly different but reveals an encouraging trend.
When single organ/system assessment was analysed, no
significant differences were found in any of the items.
Sustained improvement following BCDT during the
first 6 months of at least two BILAG grades, that is,
A→D, A→C, B→D and B→C, in each of the eight organ
systems is shown in (table 4).
Manifestations such as rash, arthritis, fatigue, mouth
ulcers and pleuritis responded well. At 6 months of
initial treatment with RTX, two patients (patient 10 and
13) showed a BILAG worsening; patient 10 had a C→B
change in a mucocutaneous item and C→A in musculo-
skeletal feature. Patient 13 went from C→B in haemato-
logic involvement. Furthermore, in patients 1, 6 and 9,
category B remained unchanged.
At the end of the follow-up, the SLICC/ACR DI scale
was calculated for both groups. BCDT group had a
mean of 1.06 (SD 1.4) and the HC a mean of 1.35 (SD
1.5) (p=0.9). In both groups, the item found most
frequently was scarring chronic alopecia (3 patients in
BCDTp and 11 patients in HC), followed by, in the
BCDT group, premature gonadal failure (n=2) and
minor tissue loss (n=2). In HC, deforming or erosive
arthritis was found in 11 patients, and muscle atrophy or
weakness in 4. In the BCDTp group, eight patients had
a final score of 0, four had a single point, three patients
had 3 points and one patient scored 4 points. In HC, 16
patients had a final score of 0, 15 patients had 1 point, 9
had 2 points, 3 patients had 3 points, 3 more patients
had 4 points, 1 patient had 5 and 1 had 6 points. No dif-
ferences between groups were found.
Prednisolone treatment
At first treatment, the mean dose of daily prednisolone
was
11.5 mg
(range
0–40 mg)
in
the
BCDTp
and
29.12 mg (SD 35.2 mg) in the HC.
At 6 months post-BCDT, the mean cumulative prednis-
olone
dose
for
the
BCDTp
was
842.64 mg
(SD
854.3 mg)
and
4247.93 mg
(SD
613.1 mg)
for
the
matched controls, with statistical differences between
both groups (p=0.02). Subsequently, throughout the
follow-up the HC had higher doses of prednisolone with
statistically
significant
differences
compared
with
BCDTp. These values are shown in figure 1. At 5 years
of
follow-up,
BCDTp
had
accumulated
about
1/3
(37.8%) of the prednisolone total dose compared with
the HC (p=0.01).
When each patient was assessed, four of the BCDTp
did not require maintenance treatment with prednisol-
one at any time (patients 3, 4, 11 and 12) and one of
them
only
needed
oral
treatment
after
18 months
(patient 7).
Initial prednisolone oral dose was 5 mg in two of the
patients (8 and 16), 7.5 mg in four (1, 2, 10 and 13),
20 mg in one (patient 15), 25 mg in two (patients 5 and
6) and 40 mg in patient 9.
Patient 14, although initially requiring 30 mg of pred-
nisolone had a lower cumulative dose due to a new treat-
ment
with
RTX,
as
discussed
previously,
allowing
subsequent lower doses of steroids. All patients in the
BCDTp group had lower cumulated doses than the
average of the matched controls except the patient 8,
who remained on 5 mg of prednisolone during the
60 months of follow-up. The cumulative prednisolone
dose was 1.5 times higher than the mean of the controls.

over the past 50 years primarily through the use of GCs,
immunosuppressive
drugs
and

 dialysis and renal transplant.13 Unfortunately, many of
the causes of morbidity in SLE reflect the accumulation
of damage occurring as a direct result of the GC
therapy.19 High-dose GC for long periods has invariably
been used to treat severe manifestations of SLE whatever
the accompanying immunosuppressive regime.20
Although the LUNAR and EXPLORER trials failed to
show superiority of RTX-treated patients with SLE over
those treated more conventionally, many smaller open-
labelled studies have reported a good response to
RTX.21–24 Ours was the first group to report the use of
BCDT early in the treatment of mainly non-renal SLE to
help reduce the overall steroid burden.24 Initially, we
described efficacy at 6-month follow-up in eight patients
compared with three carefully matched patients treated
with standard therapy.
Neither our report,24 the more impressive one of
Lightstone et al15 or the RITUXILUP clinical trial (com-
paring RTX and MMF with GC and MMF in newly diag-
nosed LN) can inform the clinician about the long-term
efficacy and steroid-saving capacity of BCD used at/close
to the time of lupus diagnosis. This ‘missing piece in the
jigsaw’ can only be provided by ‘real-life’ experience.
The data we now provide are very helpful in this regard
providing long-term (up to 7 years) follow-up in 16
newly diagnosed patients.
The selection of the controls in this study was dictated
by a desire to match them as closely as possible for ethni-
city, sex, type of lupus, age at onset, duration of disease
at diagnosis and period of follow-up. We did not select
them on the basis of matched dsDNA antibody and C3
levels. We were interested to note that the BCDTp had
significantly higher dsDNA and lower C3 levels. It is, we
suggest, even more impressive therefore that the patients
treated
with
RTX
did
as
well,
clinically,
over
the
follow-up period (of several years) compared with the
conventionally
treated
patients
and
at
5 years
of
follow-up had accumulated 37.8% of the prednisolone
total dose compared with the controls.
We doubled the number of patients compared with
our original study24 and extended the follow-up from
6 months to an average of 4.5 years. With a total of 64
patients, 16 early treated with RTX and 48 controls, a
cumulative
steroid
dose
reduction
was observed
at
6 months in the BCDTp, which became even more
obvious during the follow-up.
The study shows that the BCDTp had no significant
differences in the number of subsequent disease flares.
In fact, there was a trend to a reduced number of flares.
Treatment
with
RTX
produced
a
positive
clinical
response in the patients, measured by the BILAG score,
and
a
progressive
decrease
in
their
inflammatory
markers including anti-dsDNA antibodies. Finally, the
accumulated damage
in both groups measured by
SLICC/ACR DI showed a trend to a lower score in the
BCDTp
group,
although
not
statistically significant.
These results support the idea that the use of RTX as a
first-line treatment has similar efficacy to long-term
conventional treatment, but with significantly lower
prednisolone dose requirement.
The BCDTp showed no reduction in IgG below the
normal range. However, we continue to monitor the IgG
levels of all of our patients treated with BCD. These find-
ings were consistent with those of Vital et al,25 who
demonstrated that the clinical responses of patients with
lupus
following
RTX
are
correlated
to
the
B-cell
population.
This study has limitations. First, the observational
design, with a relatively small number of patients.
Second, the heterogeneity in the maintenance treatment
and the need to retreat with RTX in four patients during
the follow-up. Finally, the use of the classic BILAG under-
estimates the disease activity of some patients with oph-
thalmic and gastrointestinal disease as these systems were
not included in the classic BILAG scoring.
On balance, we believe that our data support the idea
that BCDT may be an effective long-term therapy when
used early in the disease. It offers a useful method of
reducing the cumulative steroid burden in patients with
predominantly non-renal lupus and is at least as effective
clinically as the use of more conventional immunosup-
pressive and corticosteroid drugs.
