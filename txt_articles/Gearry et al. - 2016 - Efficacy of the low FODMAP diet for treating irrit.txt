Abstract: This review summarizes the published clinical studies concerning the management of 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) using restriction of Fermentable Oligosaccharide,  
Disaccharide, 
Monosaccharide, and Polyols in the diet (low FODMAP diet). In recent years, the data support-
ing low FODMAP diet for the management of IBS symptoms have emerged, including several 
randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, and other observational studies. Unlike most 
dietary manipulations tried in the past to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms of IBS, all studies 
on low FODMAP diet have consistently shown symptomatic benefits in the majority of patients 
with IBS. However, dietary adherence by the patients and clear dietary intervention led by 
 
specialized dietitians appear to be vital for the success of the diet. Up to 86% of patients with IBS 
find improvement in overall gastrointestinal symptoms as well as individual symptoms such as 
abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal distention, and flatulence following 
the diet. FODMAP restriction reduces the osmotic load and gas production in the distal small 
bowel and the proximal colon, providing symptomatic relief in patients with IBS. Long-term 
health effects of a low FODMAP diet are not known; however, stringent FODMAP restriction 
is not recommended owing to risks of inadequate nutrient intake and potential adverse effects 
from altered gut microbiota. In conclusion, the evidence to date strongly supports the efficacy 
of a low FODMAP diet in the treatment of IBS. Further studies are required to understand any 
potential adverse effects of long-term restriction of FODMAPs.

What is irritable bowel syndrome?
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder charac-
terized by symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habit such as 
constipation, diarrhea, or both.1 It is the most common GI condition seen by general 
practitioners2 and accounts for up to 50% of patients seen in gastroenterology clinics.3 
IBS is a  
clinical diagnosis and is made using symptom-based criteria such as Rome III 
criteria4 (the current gold standard for IBS diagnosis [Table 1]) in addition to the 
exclusion of any organic disease.5 Although the exact cause of IBS is unknown, there 
are increasing insights concerning the possible etiology and pathophysiology of IBS. 
These include heightened pain sensitivity or visceral hypersensitivity,6,7 abnormal gut 
motility,8 small intestinal bacterial overgrowth,9 low-grade intestinal inflammation,10 
psychosocial factors,11 and dysregulated gut–brain axis.12,13 Thus, IBS appears to be a 
multifactorial, albeit incompletely understood, disorder.
The global IBS prevalence is 10%–20% depending on the diagnostic criteria used 
and the geographic region.14 The varying prevalence of IBS among countries may be

 due to variable application of the diagnostic criteria, demo-
graphic differences, and other factors such as health care 
utilization, health beliefs, or diet.14,15 IBS is also more com-
mon in women than in men and in individuals below the age 
of 50 years.14 IBS can be subclassified into IBS with diarrhea 
(IBS-D), IBS with constipation (IBS-C), mixed IBS (IBS-M), 
or unsubtyped (IBS-U) based on their predominant bowel pat-
tern.4 IBS is associated with high health care costs16,17 as well 
as impaired quality of life (QoL), compared to the general 
population.18–20 The QoL also compares poorly with other 
chronic conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, 
diabetes mellitus, and end-stage renal disease.18
The main treatment goal for clinicians treating patients 
with IBS is to alleviate global GI symptoms; however, 
because of the multiple symptoms described by patients 
with IBS, this is often challenging. While an effective 
physician–patient relationship is considered the cornerstone 
for effective treatment,21 a combination of pharmaceutical 
and nonpharmaceutical approaches are now considered. 
However, the traditional pharmacological treatments such 
as bulking agents, anticholinergics, antispasmodics, and 
antidiarrheals often do not provide adequate symptomatic 
relief in patients with IBS if used alone.22,23 A more holistic 
approach using nonpharmacological therapies such as dietary 
manipulation, exercise, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and 
hypnotherapy seems to provide further benefits in these 
patients.24 The “Diet as a therapy for IBS” section discusses 
some of the dietary manipulations aimed at improving the 
global symptoms of IBS.
Diet as a therapy for IBS
Nearly two-thirds of patients with IBS perceive their GI 
symptoms to be food-related.25 Incompletely absorbed car-
bohydrates (found in foods such as lactose found in dairy 
products, beans, onion, cabbage, apples, and wheat) as well 
as fatty foods, coffee, alcohol, and spicy foods have all been 
found to trigger or aggravate GI symptoms.25,26
Many early studies focused on strict exclusion or elimi-
nation diets followed by food rechallenge to investigate the 
role of food intolerance in patients with IBS. For example, 
25 consecutive patients diagnosed with IBS-D were asked to 
limit their diets to a single meat, a single fruit, and distilled 
or spring water for 1 week.27 Fourteen (67%) of those who 
completed the diet were symptom free.27 Six out of 14 patients 
then underwent a randomized double-blind food challenge in 
which participants were fed a liquidized preparation of either 
a test food (believed to provoke symptoms) or a control food 
via a nasogastric tube, and food intolerance was confirmed.27 
McKee et al28 repeated the dietary limitation component of 
this study including other subtypes of IBS and found that only 
6/40 (15%) patients with IBS had symptomatic improvement 
(mostly in IBS-D). In another study, nearly half (91/189) of a 
cohort of female patients with IBS experienced symptomatic 
improvement after 3 weeks of a strict exclusion diet without 
dairy products, cereals, citrus fruits, potatoes, tea, coffee, 
alcohol, additives, and preservatives, while the remainder 
(98/189) found no improvement.29 Parker et al30 described a 
similar but nutritionally adequate exclusion diet where alterna-
tive foods to those that were being excluded were suggested 
to participants. However, only 39 of 96 (41%) patients with 
IBS who completed the 2-week exclusion diet improved.30 
The variability in responses to these exclusion diets is likely 
due to differences in study protocols including duration of 
exclusion diet, the types of foods excluded, as well as the 
subtypes of IBS participants recruited in the study. Well-
designed randomized control trials have been lacking when 
it comes to the investigation of many such exclusion diets. 
However, designing controlled dietary intervention studies 
is difficult, particularly with regard to blinding study partici-
pants. Given that placebo response rates in IBS trials may be 
as high as 40%,31 difficulties in blinding can be a significant 
source of bias.
Lactose malabsorption resulting from lactase deficiency is 
known to cause abdominal pain, flatulence, and loose bowel 
motions. Hypolactasia or lactase deficiency is generally due 
to primary or secondary deficiency since congenital lactase 
deficiency at birth is extremely rare.32 Approximately 70% of 
the world population have primary lactose deficiency result-
ing from loss of lactase activity, which begins between the 
ages of 2 and 6 years,33 whereas secondary lactase deficiency 
often occurs as a result of GI illness such as viral gastroen-
teritis or celiac disease.32 Some studies have investigated the 
role of low lactose diet in the management of IBS with mixed 
results. In one study, 27% of 122 patients with IBS were found 
to have lactose malabsorption with positive lactose hydrogen

 breath test; however, only nine (39%) had improvement in 
their symptoms following the low lactose diet.34 In contrast, 
Böhmer et al35 found a marked reduction in  
symptoms with 
a lactose-restricted diet in patients with IBS with lactose 
 
malabsorption (24%) diagnosed with a hydrogen breath test, 
but no improvement in patients with IBS who tested negative 
for lactose malabsorption. Therefore, although conflicting, 
the results concerning lactose malabsorption and restriction 
suggest that lactose restriction should be tried in patients 
with IBS in whom lactose malabsorption is proven but that 
other dietary restrictions may also be required.
Probiotics, a food supplement of a single live microbe 
or mix of microbes with beneficial properties, is another 
dietary treatment that has been studied extensively in both 
IBS and also many other conditions. A systematic review and 
meta-analysis of 14 randomized control trials of probiotics 
in patients with IBS found a modest improvement in overall 
symptoms with probiotic use for several weeks (odds ratio, 
1.6;95% confidence interval, 1.2–2.2).36 However, given that 
each probiotic may have different characteristics, including 
variable effects on cytokines, host microbiota, and other 
potential targets, it is likely that the effects will be specific 
to each probiotic rather than the entire class.
In fiber supplementation studies, soluble fiber (psyllium)37 
but not insoluble fiber (bran)37,38 was found to be effective in 
the management of patients with IBS. In fact, bran supple-
mentation led to worsened symptoms in 55% of the patients.38 
A small study of 13 overweight or obese participants with 
IBS-D who completed the study found significant improve-
ment in their stool consistency, pain, and QoL with a very 
low-carbohydrate diet (20 g carbohydrates/d);39 however, 
larger studies including patients with normal body mass 
index are needed to confirm these results.
A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
rechallenge trial of gluten in patients with IBS resulted 
in significantly worse overall symptoms of pain, bloating, 
and stool consistency in the gluten group (who received 
gluten-containing foods) compared to the placebo group.40 
Interestingly, a subsequent double-blinded crossover trial 
in subjects with nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and 
IBS without celiac disease performed by the same group 
found no evidence of specific or dose-dependent effects of 
gluten, while improvements in symptoms were seen with 
a diet low in fermentable carbohydrates (Fermentable Oli-
gosaccharide, Disaccharide, Monosaccharide, and Polyols 
[FODMAPs]).41 This study41 suggests that the carbohydrate 
component (fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides) of the 
wheat as opposed to the gluten may be responsible for the 
IBS symptoms experienced by patients with NCGS and 
IBS. Thus, it may be that a combination of incompletely 
absorbed carbohydrates may be responsible for eliciting 
many symptoms of IBS rather than one specific food or 
food component.
The low FODMAP diet
FODMAPs are a group of carbohydrates that are poorly 
absorbed in the small intestine and subsequently fermented 
in the small or large intestine.42 These poorly absorbed 
short-chain carbohydrates include fructose and lactose (in 
patients who malabsorb these with impaired enzyme activity 
or transport mechanisms), fructans, galacto-oligosaccharides, 
and polyols or sugar alcohols. Table 2 lists representative 
examples of common foods that are known to be high in 
FODMAPs and examples of suitable low FODMAP alterna-
tives. The implementation of low FODMAP diet is beyond the 
scope of this paper, but it is covered in detail elsewhere.43,44
How does a low FODMAP diet work 
in IBS?
Not all FODMAPs exacerbate abdominal symptoms in patients 
with IBS. The presence and degree of abdominal symptoms 
in a given individual depends on the degree of malabsorption 
experienced by the individual. There are two main mechanisms 
responsible for the induction of symptoms in patients with 
IBS by FODMAPs. First, FODMAPs are poorly absorbed by 
the small intestine and are osmotically active, leading to net 
secretion of fluid into the small intestine. This may distend 
the small intestine, leading to abdominal symptoms, in addi-
tion to increasing water delivered to the colon. In a study of 
ileostomates,45 intestinal output was increased by 22% with 
high consumption of FODMAPs within meals secondary 
to an increased osmotic load. In addition, a recent magnetic 
resonance imaging study has shown an abnormal accumulation 
of fluid in the small intestine of patients with IBS following 
ingestion of an unabsorbed carbohydrate, lactulose, as well as 
provoking significantly more symptoms compared to healthy 
controls.46 These results support the underlying mechanism 
leading to diarrhea experienced by some patients with IBS. 
Second, FODMAPs are rapidly fermented by the colonic 
microbiota, leading to colonic distention from gas production, 
with associated pain and bloating. A reduction in breath hydro-
gen production, which measures the degree of gas produced 
by the microbiota, in both healthy and IBS subjects with a low 
FODMAP diet has been shown in a recent study, suggesting 
reduced fermentation and gas production with restriction of 
poorly absorbed carbohydrates.47 Subsequently, there was an

 improvement of GI symptoms in the patients with IBS on a 
low FODMAP diet.47 Thus, the study supports the hypothesis 
that rapid fermentation of undigested, unabsorbed FODMAPs 
in the colon results in distention of the large bowel, bloating, 
and abdominal pain from excess gas production.
Clinical studies of low FODMAP 
diet and IBS
Studies on the effect of dietary restriction of FODMAPs in 
patients with IBS have shown consistent results supporting 
the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet in improving overall 
GI symptoms of adult patients with IBS (Tables 3 and 4). 
However, as noted earlier, designing and implementing a 
prospective placebo-controlled dietary intervention study 
are extremely difficult. In the field of a low FODMAP diet in 
the treatment of IBS symptoms, many studies are retrospec-
tive48,49 or prospective and uncontrolled,47–53 making the studies 
potentially subject to bias and confounding. To date, there have 
been two controlled trials49,54 and six randomized controlled 
trials47,55–59 evaluating low FODMAP diet in patients with 
IBS. These studies, and others described in Tables 3 and 4 
were conducted in Australia (four), Norway (two), Denmark 
(two), New Zealand (one), Switzerland (one), Sweden (one), 
and the UK (two).
The majority of studies comprised a small number 
of participants (fewer than 100),47,48,50,52,54,56–58,60 and two 
of the studies50,51 had poor study completion or response 
rates (50%). The average age of IBS participants ranged 
from 35 to 50 years and, as one might expect with an IBS 
cohort, a large proportion of the participants were female 
(66%–87%) in all studies.47–54,56–60 The common primary 
outcome measure was changes in GI symptoms (overall and/
or individual symptoms); however, the use of scoring scales 
varied considerably with a few studies using validated ques-
tionnaires.49,50,54,56 While not all studies assessed for dietary 
intake, the dietary assessment methodologies included food 
frequency questionnaire,49,50 food diaries,47,55,56,58 and other 
unspecified methods.53 Dietary advice on a low FODMAP 
diet was mostly delivered by a specialized or trained dieti-
tian, with the exception of two studies where a registered 
nurse had provided the dietary guidance.49,50 Not all studies 
provided the list of foods allowed in the low FODMAP diet; 
however, two studies49,50 allowed peeled apples, pears, and 
milk as part of the low FODMAP diet, which is not consistent

 with a low FODMAP diet as it has been described. Since the 
first low FODMAP diets were described,48 there have been 
modifications to the food lists that have been prompted by 
new scientific data on food composition. However, robust 
data now exist describing the FODMAP content of commonly 
consumed foods (Table 2).
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are 
considered the “gold standard” for an intervention study;61 
however, this is almost impossible to apply in dietary inter-
ventions. The more recent study conducted by Halmos et al55 
was a randomized controlled, single-blind crossover study in 
which 30 IBS and 9 healthy subjects consumed 21 days of 
low FODMAP diet or the typical Australian diet. The authors 
were able to address confounding variables by providing all 
intervention diets that were matched for all nutrients except for 
the FODMAP content. They found that 70% of IBS subjects 
(across all four subtypes of IBS) felt better on the low FOD-
MAP diet, whereby the greatest symptom control was achieved 
and maintained after 7 days on the low FODMAP diet.
Additional evidence supporting FODMAPs as “food 
triggers” was provided in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 
rechallenge trial in 25 patients with IBS with fructose mal-
absorption.57 In this study, a dose-dependent induction of 
GI symptoms was seen in the majority of patients with IBS 
following introduction of fructose (70%), fructans (77%), 
and fructose and fructans mix (79%) compared to glucose 
(14%) in liquid forms following a low FODMAP diet. This 
study also supports cumulative and dose-dependent effects of 
FODMAPs on inducing GI symptoms in patients with IBS.
Most patients with IBS find the diet easy to adhere to,51,54 
with better symptomatic improvement seen in those with the 
best adherence.48,51 A randomized controlled trial conducted 
by Pedersen et al59 found that the low FODMAP diet as well 
as the probiotics had significantly improved the IBS symptom 
score compared to the normal diet. However, this study was 
unblinded, and all three groups had a significantly improved 
symptom score after 6 weeks of intervention and web-based 
self-monitoring of symptoms compared to the baseline.59
Furthermore, the low FODMAP diet has provided 
symptomatic relief in more patients with IBS compared to 
a standard dietary advice consisting of healthy eating prin-
ciples, alteration of insoluble and soluble fibers, and limiting 
sugar-free foods and foods containing sorbitol (86% and 
49%, respectively).54 A recent single-blinded randomized 
controlled trial58 comparing the low FODMAP diet and the 
traditional dietary advice of regular meal pattern, avoiding 
or limiting certain foods such as fat, insoluble fiber, caffeine, 
and “windy vegetables” found reduced severity of symptoms 
in both groups, but no significant difference between the 
intervention groups. It was noted, however, the excess fruc-
tose intake was significantly lower in the traditional IBS diet 
group at the end of their study compared to baseline.
Limitations of low FODMAP diet include lack of clear 
cutoff levels for FODMAP content in foods and nonavailabil-
ity of information on FODMAP content on food packages. 
However, research is being carried out to compile a com-
prehensive nutrient composition database for FODMAPs. 
Because the diet is fairly complex, advice should be given 
by a specialized dietitian trained in the area with appropriate 
resources, and food intake should be monitored for nutritional 
adequacy. Compliance may be a factor; nonetheless, the low 
FODMAP diet does not appear to alleviate GI symptoms 
of every IBS subject. Furthermore, the health effects of 
long-term low FODMAP diet are unknown. Human intes-
tinal microbiota plays a critical role in health and disease. 
Although inulin-type fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides 
are FODMAPs, the ingestion of which may be associated with 
abdominal symptoms, they are also prebiotics, stimulating the 
growth of beneficial bacteria.62 Studies have shown reduced 
total bacterial abundance60 and reduced concentration of 
bifidobacteria56 following a low FODMAP diet, suggesting 
potential adverse health effects of the diet. Generally, the 
strict low FODMAP diet is not recommended to be followed 
long term. Reintroduction or rechallenge of FODMAP foods 
is recommended based on individual tolerance.63
There are few low FODMAP dietary intervention studies 
conducted in children (not included in Tables 3 and 4). Until 
recently, these studies have focused on lactose malabsorp-
tion only.64,65 More recently, a pilot study66 and a randomized 
study67 have shown reduction in abdominal pain frequency in 
children between 7 and 17 years of age with the low FOD-
MAP diet. The results from these studies have also suggested 
that a difference in the microbiome composition at baseline 
may determine responders and nonresponders to the low 
FODMAP diet. Specifically, the responders had bacteria with 
greater saccharolytic capacity (such as genera Sporobacter 
and Subdoligranulum66 and Bacteroids, Ruminococcaceae, 
and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii)67 at baseline to break down 
sugars than those who did not respond to the diet. Hence, 
reduction in GI symptoms in children with IBS was seen with 
the low FODMAP diet likely due to decrease in osmotic load 
and gas production from fermentation.
In general, nearly all of the studies have used the Rome 
diagnostic criteria to select patients with IBS, which have 
resulted in a predominance of female subjects mostly between 
the ages of 30 and 50 years. The design of the studies varied

 largely in terms of duration and the delivery of dietary inter-
vention as well as symptom scoring tools or scales used. In all 
studies, however, improvements in overall GI symptoms were 
evident with those following a low FODMAP diet. Although 
the results are not consistent, significant improvements in 
 
diarrhea and constipation were seen in most studies. However, 
standardized dietary interventions and outcome measures 
were not used and are required to allow robust comparison 
in future studies. Finally, the first meta-analysis published in 
201568 supports the efficacy of the diet in the treatment of 
functional GI symptoms including IBS.
Low FODMAP diet in other diseases
There are some studies in which low FODMAP diet has been 
applied to improve other lower GI disorders. For example, 
functional gut symptoms or IBS-type symptoms are common in 
patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with a greater 
prevalence seen in Crohn’
s disease than in patients with ulcer-
ative colitis.69 Gearry et al70 have demonstrated that restriction 
in FODMAPs improved overall abdominal symptoms as well 
as abdominal pain, bloating, wind, and diarrhea in patients with 
IBD in a retrospective study. Similarly, reduction in dietary 
FODMAPs intake improved stool output and consistency in 
patients with ulcerative colitis following ileorectal anastomosis 
or ileal pouch formation and colectomy.71 Both of these studies 
have shown improvement with good adherence to the diet. As 
mentioned earlier in this review, significant improvements in GI 
symptoms were also seen in NCGS subjects with IBS41 and in 
all other types of patients with functional GI disorder.69
Future directions
Standardized dietary intervention in low FODMAP diet 
intervention studies and the use of validated symptom scales 
as predefined primary outcomes are essential to ensure that 
the results may be generalizable across larger and more 
diverse populations. Furthermore, modifications of the low 
FODMAP diet to individual tolerance should be considered 
in order to test the true efficacy of low FODMAP diet in 
long-term management of IBS. Finally, the long-term effect 
of a low FODMAP diet on the colonic health, particularly 
the microbiome, requires further investigation.
Conclusion
In summary, the evidence to date indicates that restriction of 
FODMAPs is an effective dietary intervention for reducing 
IBS symptoms. There are now well-designed clinical trials to 
support the efficacy of low FODMAP diet with alleviation of 
GI symptoms in majority of patients with IBS. More studies 
are required to assess long-term efficacy of low FODMAP 
diet following food rechallenge and to ascertain any adverse 
outcomes from effects on the gut microbiota.
