 The migraine generator revisited: continuous
scanning of the migraine cycle over 30 days and
three spontaneous attacks
Laura H. Schulte and Arne May
Functional imaging using positron emission tomography and later functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed a particular
brainstem area that is believed to be specifically activated in migraine during, but not outside of the attack, and consequently has
been coined the ‘migraine generator’. However, the pathophysiological concept behind this term is not undisputed and typical
migraine premonitory symptoms such as fatigue and yawning, but also a typical association of attacks to circadian and men-
strual cycles, all make the hypothalamus a possible regulating region of migraine attacks. Neuroimaging studies investigating
native human migraine attacks however are scarce and for methodological but also clinical reasons there are currently no studies
investigating the last 24 h before headache onset. Here we report a migraine patient who had magnetic resonance imaging every
day for 30 days, always in the morning, to cover, using functional imaging, a whole month and three complete, untreated
migraine attacks. We found that hypothalamic activity as a response to trigeminal nociceptive stimulation is altered during the
24 h prior to pain onset, i.e. increases towards the next migraine attack. More importantly, the hypothalamus shows altered
functional coupling with the spinal trigeminal nuclei and the region of the migraine generator, i.e. the dorsal rostral pons during
the preictal day and the pain phase of native human migraine attacks. These data suggest that although the brainstem is highly
linked to the migraine biology, the real driver of attacks might be the functional changes in hypothalamo–brainstem
connectivity.

Introduction
Among the more than 200 headache types, migraine is the
second most common headache syndrome that affects be-
tween 12 and 14% of the population. Migraine is predom-
inantly a cycling episodic disorder that manifests in attacks
of headache, photophobia, phonophobia and nausea with a
certain circadian rhythmicity. Extensive research over the
past 20 years has broadened our understanding of the
underlying mechanisms and pathogenesis. Due to techno-
logical
improvements,
brain
imaging
techniques
have
gained importance in the quest to understand cycling

 headache syndromes and specific emphasis has been placed
to understand neuronal activation in headache syndromes
using functional MRI. Several independent functional stu-
dies have established the crucial role of the brainstem in
acute
and
chronic
migraine
(Weiller
et
al.,
1995;
Stankewitz et al., 2011) and the hypothalamic area in tri-
gemino-autonomic headaches (May, 2005). A recent study
reinforced the specific brainstem findings in migraine by
comparing brain responses during trigeminal pain process-
ing in migraine patients with those of healthy control sub-
jects (Stankewitz et al., 2011). The main finding was that
the activity of the spinal trigeminal nuclei in response to
nociceptive stimulation showed a cycling behaviour over
the migraine interval where the trigeminal activation level
increased significantly towards the next migraine attack.
However, this finding came from a cohort study, where
the time towards the next attack was determined retro-
spectively, i.e. per telephone contact after the experiment
until the next attack occurred. These data cannot answer
the question of whether the trigeminal pain system is dys-
functional in itself or if other structures modulate its activ-
ity. From a clinical perspective, the hypothalamus would be
the most likely ‘modulator’ of the trigeminal pain system as
the many facets of a migraine attack, such as yawning,
fatigue and craving but also circadian rhythmicity of at-
tacks (Fox and Davis, 1998; Fox, 2005; Alstadhaug
et al., 2007; Nascimento et al., 2014) could be best ex-
plained when considering the biological role of the limbic
system. Using PET, one study reported increased cerebral
blood flow bilaterally in the hypothalamus during an acute
attack in migraine patients (Denuelle et al., 2007) and even
more recently some hypothalamic activity was reported
very
early
in
nitroglycerin-triggered
attacks
(Maniyar
et al., 2014). Based on resting state data Moulton et al.
(2014) suggested that hypothalamic connectivity with auto-
nomic circuits and the locus coeruleus in migraine may be
altered. A problem of all the above-mentioned studies is the
variance of cohort studies involving the interpretation of
averaged imaging data and the fact that most studies inves-
tigate only a small space of time of the migraine cycle, i.e.
the attack compared to a random day between attacks.
However, just as the migraine cycle spans several days
and contains up to five phases (prodromes, aura, headache,
resolution, and recovery) (Blau, 1992), the trigeminal activ-
ity in migraine patients is not constant but strongly variable
(Stankewitz and May, 2007; Stankewitz et al., 2011). Thus
the ultimate answer as to which areas of the brain and
brainstem might in fact generate migraine attacks comes
probably from individual data which may give us a more
differentiated view as data differ from subject to subject
depending on the time to the next migraine attack.
Focusing on this aspect we report an otherwise healthy
migraine patient without any medication who was scanned
every day for 30 days, always in the morning, with the aim
to cover, using functional imaging, a whole month with
three complete, untreated migraine attacks.
Materials and methods
Patient
One patient with the diagnosis of migraine without aura ac-
cording to IHS criteria [Headache Classification Committee of
the International Headache Society (IHS), 2013] with very
regular attacks (two to three per month, lasting typically 1–2
days) underwent daily event-related functional MRI of stan-
dardized trigeminal nociceptive stimulation over a period of 31
days. Headache status (headache/no headache), headache char-
acteristics and the presence of typical migraine premonitory
and accompanying symptoms were assessed daily as well as
possible use of analgesic medication or triptans, other pain
symptoms and state of the menstrual cycle. The patient was
otherwise completely healthy and took no regular medication.
She was allowed to treat acute migraine attacks at any time
but was asked to kindly refrain from taking any acute medi-
cation at least 12 h before each scan, if possible. The patient
herself, however, decided to not take any medication at all
although we repeatedly and explicitly offered it at least after
the scan on headache days. Image acquisition took place over
a continuous period of 31 days. During this period, the patient
experienced three migraine attacks with typical migraine ac-
companying symptoms. Each attack lasted 1–2 days with a
peak pain intensity of 5–7 on a visual analogue scale anchored
at 0 and 10. The location was right sided except for attack
number 2 with changes in pain location from left to right
during the course of the attack. The functional scans from
Day 22 (second day post-ictal) had to be excluded post hoc,
due to imaging artefacts caused by a small metal clip on the
participants’ clothing. Behavioural data from this day however
were usable and included in the analysis.
The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the
chamber
of
physicians
of
Hamburg,
Germany
(number
PV4522). The patient gave informed consent to participation
in our study based on elaborate personal information and on a
special information session before the actual study during
which she was able to experience the experimental paradigm
first hand and to make an informed decision on whether she
felt able to undergo this daily. A few days later we asked her
whether she was willing to participate.
Experimental paradigm
The protocol for standardized trigeminal nociceptive stimula-
tion has been described in detail in previous publications
(Stankewitz et al., 2010; Kro
¨ger and May, 2015; Schulte
et al., 2015). In short, the paradigm consisted of three gaseous
stimuli presented via a Teflon tube to the left nostril of the
patient and one visual stimulus: gaseous ammonia served as
standardized nociceptive stimulus, rose odour as olfactory
stimulus, air as control condition and a rotating checkerboard
as visual stimulus. Gaseous stimuli were presented via an ol-
factometer whereas visual stimuli, reaction tasks and rating
procedures
were
presented
via
a
mirror
system
using
Presentation�
software
(version
16.4,
Neurobehavioural
Systems, Berkeley, California, USA). Stimuli were presented
15 times during the experiment. Stimulus-sequences were in
a pseudorandomized order thus preventing direct succession
of two similar stimuli. Prior to each stimulus a reaction task

 was performed: the patient was asked to press a button when
a white cross turned red. Following each stimulus presentation
the patient rated the intensity of the stimulus on a visual nu-
meric rating scale (0 to 100), as well as the unpleasantness of
each stimulus (�50 to + 50, with higher values indicating a
more unpleasant experience).
Behavioural data
Intensity and unpleasantness of all stimuli were rated on a
visual numeric rating scale. Behavioural data were extracted
from logfiles, plotted and analysed within Matlab (R2013b,
The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusets, USA) using
custom scripts and basis functions. Statistical comparison of
the ictal days versus the interictal days was performed by
applying the function ‘ttest2’ of Matlab to the single data
points of the respective days. For plotting behavioural data
were normalized by subtracting the overall mean of the
rating of each quality from each individual rating of the re-
spective quality on every single day.
Image acquisition
Images were acquired on a 3 T MRI scanner (TIM TRIO,
Siemens) using a 32-channel head coil. During the experimen-
tal paradigm �900 to 1100 functional images were acquired
using the following protocol for echoplanar imaging: voxel
size: 2 � 2 � 2 mm3, 40 axial slices, repetition time = 2.62 s,
echo time = 30 ms, flip angle 90�, parallel accelerated with
GRAPPA.
Structural
images
were
acquired
using
an
MPRAGE sequence (voxel size: 1 � 1 � 1 mm3, repetition
time 2.3 s, echo time 2.98 ms, slice orientation: sagittal, flip
angle 9�).
Preprocessing
Preprocessing of functional images consisted of the following
steps: realignment, coregistration to a structural scan, and
smoothing. As we expected normalization in a single subject
analysis to introduce additional error, we omitted normaliza-
tion of functional data into MNI space during preprocessing.
Instead, functional images were transferred into the same
stereotactic space by an image realignment–coregistration se-
quence. Functional images were smoothed using a 6 mm full-
width at half maximum Gaussian kernel.
Region of interest definition and
transference into single subject space
Regions of interest for small volume correction were generated
via MarsBar Toolbox using the coordinates of previously re-
ported activations within the respective brain areas as centre of
spheres. Sphere diameters varied according to the anatomical
properties of the brain region that the respective region of
interest was located in. In general we used smaller diameters
for regions of interest located within the brainstem (6–9 mm)
and larger diameters for regions of interest located within
supratentorial brain areas. Centre coordinates for regions of
interest were obtained from the following publications: spinal
trigeminal nuclei (Stankewitz et al., 2011; Kro
¨ger and May,
2015; Youssef et al., 2016), rostral pons (Denuelle et al.,
2007), hypothalamus (Denuelle et al., 2007). Regions of inter-
est of the primary and secondary visual cortex (Brodmann
areas 17, 18 and 19) were defined by using the Wake Forest
University Pickatlas (WFU-Pickatlas, version 3.0) (Maldjian
et al., 2003).
To enable small volume correction with previously reported
coordinates from the literature and anatomical masks obtained
from the WFU-atlas, we transferred regions of interest into
subject space by a normalization procedure: first, we normal-
ized the single subject T1 template included in SPM12 to the
already coregistered structural scan of our subject using the
function
‘old
normalize’
as
implemented
in
SPM12.
Normalization parameters were then used to transfer regions
of interest to subject space.
Statistical analysis
The experimental paradigm was analysed using a general
linear model (GLM) as implemented in first level models of
SPM12. Herein, each day of scanning (except for Day 22 due
to imaging artefacts) was included as a single session in the
first level GLM. Per session, 12 regressors were included in the
analysis: six experimental regressors (ammonia, rose odour,
air, checkerboard, button presses, anticipation phase), and
six movement regressors created during image realignment.
For the three gaseous stimuli, button presses and movement
parameters, a delta function at event onset was convolved with
the canonical haemodynamic response function (HRF). The
checkerboard stimulus and the anticipation phase were mod-
elled by convolving box car functions of stimulus duration
with the HRF. To identify changes in pain processing during
different days of the migraine cycle differential contrasts were
defined by attributing contrast weights of the respective size to
the ammonia regressor of the days of interest. The different
phases of the migraine cycle were defined as follows: interictal:
at least 60 h distance from the past and to the next attack;
preictal: headache onset within the next 24 h; ictal: all days
with headache; postictal: headache offset within the past 24 h.
As we were not only interested in categorical comparisons
between the phases of the migraine cycle but also in detecting
brain areas showing a linear increase of activity towards the
next attack, we modelled a correlation contrast with contrast
weights showing a linear increase from the fourth preictal day
(in case of attack number 1 and 2) or the third preictal day (in
case of attack number 3, were the fourth preictal day was also
the second postictal day of the attack before and could there-
fore not be modelled unambiguously) on and being highest in
the ictal phase. All differential contrasts were centred by sub-
tracting the mean of all non-zero contrast weights from each
individual non-zero contrast weight of a given contrast, so that
the sum of contrast weights added up to (approximately) zero.
Functional connectivity
Based on a strong a priori hypothesis on clinical (Blau, 1992)
and
functional
imaging
grounds
(Denuelle
et
al.,
2007;
Maniyar et al., 2014), we hypothesized the hypothalamus to
play a crucial role in migraine attack generation. We thus
conducted a psychophysiological interaction analysis (Friston
et al., 1997) using pain (ammonia) as the psychological con-
dition and a sphere of 2-mm radius around the peak voxel of
the hypothalamic activation from the correlation contrast

 adjusted for effects of interest as a seed region. Three regres-
sors were included per session and day: (i) the extracted time
course from the seed region; (ii) the psychological variable
(pain); and (iii) the PPI (psychophysiological interactions)
interaction term. Contrast vectors for the interaction term
were created and centred as described above.
Multiple comparisons correction
Although this is a single subject study, activations are assumed
significant at P 5 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons
using the family wise error rate (FWE). As we had strong a
priori hypotheses about certain areas of the brain and brain-
stem regarding their involvement in migraine pathophysiology
and attack generation, we defined several a priori regions of
interest (spinal trigeminal nuclei, dorsal and middle pons,
hypothalamus, visual cortex) in which small volume correction
was performed. Regions of interest for small volume correction
were created and transferred into subject space as described
above. Outside a priori regions of interest activations are only
reported at a threshold of P 5 0.05, FWE corrected for all
voxels.
Results
Behavioural data
A plot of behavioural data is shown in Fig. 1. When stat-
istically comparing the ictal and the interictal state, we de-
tected significant differences regarding intensity ratings of
the pain-stimulus (ammonia, ictal mean: 63.5, interictal
mean: 59.3, P = 0.024) and the visual stimulus (checker-
board, ictal mean: 44.7, interictal mean: 37.7, P 5 0.001).
Regarding unpleasantness ratings, significant differences
were found for all of the three stimuli (ammonia: ictal
mean: 26.5, interictal mean: 20.3, P 5 0.001, rose odour:
ictal
mean:
�2.6,

mean:

P 5 0.001,
checkerboard:
ictal
mean:
10.5,
interictal
mean:
1.4,
P 5 0.001).
Imaging data
When comparing the mean of the scans taken within the
last 24 h before headache onset with the interictal scans, we
found significant activation within the ipsilateral hypothal-
amus
as
well
as
bilaterally
within
the
visual
cortex
(Brodmann areas 17–19). Ictally, the middle pons was sig-
nificantly stronger activated than interictally, whereas the
visual cortex showed significant deactivations as compared
to the interictal phase. In the correlation contrast, we found
the right spinal trigeminal nucleus, the middle pons, the
hypothalamus and the visual cortex (Brodmann areas 18
and 19) to increase activity towards the next migraine
attack. See Table 1 for further details. In the postictal
phase, the visual cortex (Brodmann areas 17 and 18) was
significantly stronger activated as a response to painful
stimulation than in the ictal phase. No significant deactiva-
tions in any of the predefined areas of interest could be seen
for the preictal or the postictal phase as compared to the
interictal phase. As the hypothalamus is of interest, espe-
cially before the occurrence of migraine pain, we conducted
a psychophysiological interaction analysis to determine
changes in pain-related functional connectivity of the hypo-
thalamus during the migraine cycle. During preictal days,
when comparing to the interictal days, the hypothalamus
showed enhanced functional coupling with the spinal tri-
geminal nuclei, while during the ictal days there was a sig-
nificantly
enhanced
functional
coupling
between
the
hypothalamus and the dorsal rostral pons. When compar-
ing the postictal with the interictal phase, functional cou-
pling between the hypothalamus and the lower parts of the
spinal trigeminal nucleus were increased at P 5 0.001, un-
corrected. This last finding however did not reach statistical
significance after small volume correction. See Table 2 for
further details. Figure 1 shows activations and the PPI ana-
lysis during different stages of the migraine cycle.
Discussion
The main finding of this study is that the hypothalamus, de-
pending on the state of the migraine cycle, exhibits an altered
functional coupling with the spinal trigeminal nuclei and the
region of the dorsal rostral pons. More specifically, the hypo-
thalamus is significantly more active within the last 24h pre-
ceding the onset of migraine pain and shows the greatest
functional coupling with the spinal trigeminal nuclei, whereas
during the ictal state, the hypothalamus is functionally
coupled with the dorsal rostral pons, an area that was previ-
ously coined ‘the migraine generator’ (Bahra et al., 2001;
Denuelle et al., 2007).
In recent years migraine has primarily been understood
and discussed as a cyclic disorder with physiological func-
tioning and changing activity of certain areas of the brain
and brainstem during different stages of the migraine cycle
(Weiller et al., 1995; Judit et al., 2000; Stankewitz and
May, 2007; Stankewitz et al., 2011; Maniyar et al.,
2014). Increased hypothalamic activity in the hours preced-
ing migraine pain onset has only been shown once imme-
diately
before
NO-triggered
migraine-like
headache
(Maniyar et al., 2014). The authors speculated that an ac-
tivation in this area in the preictal phase might represent a
dysfunction that could potentially modulate the top–down
inhibitory effect on the trigeminocervical complex (Maniyar
et al., 2014). It has to be said that activation in the hypo-
thalamic region in this PET study was not seen, when all
preictal
scans
were
compared
against
baseline
scans.
Nevertheless, our data representing spontaneous untreated
attacks suggest nitroglycerin-induced and spontaneous at-
tacks to be very similar, including imaging data.
Scanning the same person 30 days in a row significantly
reduces variance and allows monitoring common and head-
ache-specific brain activations as a response to nociceptive
stimuli throughout the migraine cycle. One way to analyse
these data is to contrast different states (e.g. interictal,

 preictal, ictal, and postictal) with each other. Another op-
portunity offered by this method is to use the migraine
states as a regressor and, over all 30 days, compute the
activity in the brain which significantly follows this regres-
sor. When we contrasted the ictal with the interictal state
we found a strong and specific activation in the rostral
pons, the region which in earlier studies has been tightly
linked to attack generation (Weiller et al., 1995; Bahra
et al., 2001; Stankewitz et al., 2011). This region was not
prominently activated when contrasting the preictal with
the interictal state, where the hypothalamus was specifically
activated. In the postictal phase, only the visual cortex
showed stronger activity as a response to pain compared
to the ictal phase. That the visual cortex activates as a
response to pain in interictal migraineurs is well known
(Boulloche et al., 2010). Taken together with the findings
from the preictal and ictal phase as well as the correlation
contrast, this could point towards increasing multisensory
integration of visual and nociceptive stimulation towards
the next migraine attack with a subsequent deactivation
during the pain phase of a migraine attack. This phenom-
enon however could also represent a baseline problem: in a
situation of already increased trigeminal nociceptive input
the pain-related visual cortex activity might constitutively
be higher leading to lesser responses to additional painful
stimulation. It appears that each region is functionally
highly linked to a specific phase in the migraine cycle, a
suggestion that is emphasized when weighing all states over
all cycles and all days (Fig. 1).
From a biological level it is probably more important to
understand whether such phase-specific activations have
any functional consequences and to explore possible rela-
tionships between these areas. It is therefore highly inter-
esting that the hypothalamic activity is not only phase-
locked to the preictal phase but, in this phase, has a
strong functional coupling with the trigeminal nuclei,
which was not seen in the other phases. We also found
that the spinal trigeminal nuclei increase activity towards

 the next migraine attack and were thus able to replicate
findings from a previous study from our own group
(Stankewitz et al., 2011). The functional coupling between
the hypothalamus and the trigeminal nuclei is significantly
weaker in the ictal phase, when the hypothalamus is
strongly coupled to the dorsal rostral pons. This suggests
that the activation in this area in the preictal phase does
not represent a mere dysfunction but that the change in
functional connectivity of the hypothalamus with the tri-
geminal nuclei and the rostral pons drives the different
phases, probably by activating the top–down inhibitory
effect on the trigeminocervical complex in the preictal
phase and activating the dorsal pons in the ictal phase,
eventually leading to the attack. The current findings thus
corroborate the theory that the hypothalamus might be the
true generator of migraine attacks.
In conclusion, our data suggest the hypothalamus to be
the primary generator of migraine attacks which, due to
specific interactions with specific areas in the higher and
lower brainstem, could alter the activity levels of the key
regions of migraine pathophysiology. As, however, the cur-
rent study only investigated a single patient repeatedly over
different stages of the migraine cycle, future investigations
in a cohort of patients are needed to verify the results.
