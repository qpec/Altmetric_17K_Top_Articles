Abstract
Background—Little is known on how perceived availability of marijuana is associated with 
medical marijuana laws. We examined the relationship between medical marijuana laws (MML) 
and the prevalence of past-month marijuana use, with perceived availability of marijuana.
Methods—Data were from respondents included in the National Survey of Drug Use and Health 
restricted use data portal 2004–2013. Multilevel logistic regression of individual- level data was 
used to test differences between MML and non-MML states and changes in prevalence of past-
month marijuana use and perceived availability from before to after passage of MML among 
adolescents, young adults and older adults controlling for demographics.
Results—Among adults 26+, past-month prevalence of marijuana use increased from 5.87% to 
7.15% after MML passage (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 1.24 [1.16–1.31]), but no change in 
prevalence of use was found for 12–17 or 18–25 year-olds. Perceived availability of marijuana 
increased after MML were enacted among those 26+ but not in younger groups. Among all age 
groups, prevalence of marijuana use and perception of it being easily available was higher in states 
that would eventually pass MML by 2013 compared to those that had not. Perceived availability 
was significantly associated with increased risk of past-month marijuana use in all age groups.

 Conclusion—Evidence suggests perceived availability as a driver of change in use of marijuana 
due to MML. To date, this has only occurred in adults 26+ and different scenarios that could 
explain this change need to be further explored.

1. INTRODUCTION
A major concern with the enactment of medical marijuana laws (MML) is that this type of 
legislation could potentially increase marijuana use in adolescents and adult populations 
(Cerdá et al., 2012). A potential pathway in which this may occur involves the recognition 
that MML have been passed and could be increasing the availability of marijuana in the U.S. 
Increases in availability of marijuana on its own may normalize both medical and non-
medical marijuana use and reduce harm-related risk perceptions of marijuana use, which 
could result in changes in marijuana use (Bestrashniy and Winters, 2015; Palamar et al., 
2014; Piontek et al., 2013). Some studies suggest that individuals’ perception of availability 
of an illegal drug can also influence drug use patterns (Ennett et al., 1997; Hanson et al., 
2003). Increased availability of marijuana may generate changes in the supply market 
resulting in drops in price of marijuana, which in turn may influence the overall use of it in 
the population (Pacula et al., 2015). However, although it is believed to have increased over 
the last decade, estimates of yearly availability of marijuana in the U.S. either produced 
domestically or internationally are unknown (NDIC, 2010).
Recent evidence suggests that, while not all MML states have enforced patient registration, 
the number of patients registered in medical marijuana programs across states have 
increased over time in MML states, particularly after 2009 when there were substantial 
changes in federal prosecution laws regarding marijuana cultivation, distribution and 
possession (Fairman, 2016). In addition, registration fees vary widely across MML states 
(Williams, 2016) Also, research has reported that home cultivation and the presence of 
dispensaries in MML states have resulted in diversion of marijuana to individuals 
(Nussbaum et al., 2015; RMHIDTA, 2014; Wirfs-Brock et al., 2010), including youth 
(Salomonsen-Sautel et al., 2012; Thurstone et al., 2011), who then use it for non-medical 
purposes. Non-MML states may also be affected by the diversion of marijuana illegally 
moving from MML states to non-MML states (RMHIDTA, 2014). All these factors could 
have potentially increased the overall availability of marijuana across states; however, it is 
also possible that other factors, such as reductions in illegal marijuana coming from out of 
the U.S. (UNODC, 2015; i.e., there has been a decrease in seizures of illegal marijuana 
entering in the U.S. since 2009), could have balanced out the MML effects. As such, 
measuring the availability of marijuana across states in a specific year is challenging given 
the limitations to quantify the amount of available of marijuana in illegal street-markets and 
sold through the Internet, and the surplus of medical marijuana from home cultivation 
productions and legal dispensaries that is diverted to the public (Pacula et al., 2015; Smart, 
2015). Smart (2015) has reported that growth in the legal medical marijuana market is 
associated with increases in recreational use among adolescent and adults. In this regard,

 measures of overall perception of availability could be an intermediate step between changes 
in actual availability and marijuana use, and could provide some insight on how availability 
is associated with marijuana use in states enacting MML.
To date, some studies have examined if perceived availability is associated with the 
prevalence of marijuana use (Bonn-Miller et al., 2014; Friese and Grube, 2013; Khatapoush 
and Hallfors, 2004; Miech et al., 2015; Salomonsen-Sautel et al., 2012; Schuermeyer et al., 
2014; Smart, 2015). However, these studies are restricted populations of only medical users 
(Bonn-Miller et al., 2014), had limited to analyses in a single state (Bonn-Miller et al., 2014; 
Friese and Grube, 2013; Khatapoush and Hallfors, 2004), only explored perceived 
availability as an outcome of marijuana policies in the mid to late 1990’s (Khatapoush and 
Hallfors, 2004), or mostly have focused on youth populations (Friese and Grube, 2013; 
Kokkevi et al., 2000; Miech et al., 2015; Piontek et al., 2013; Steppan et al., 2013; ter Bogt 
et al., 2006, 2014). Data from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study has shown that 
perceived availability among 12th graders has been stable since 1975 (80–90% report it is 
fairly easy to obtain marijuana), has always been higher in 12th graders as compared to 8th 
and 10th graders (37% of the 8th graders and 66% of the 10th graders reported it was fairly 
easy to obtain in 2014) and is currently at a historic low among this population (Miech et al., 
2015). In addition, another study with MTF data (Shi, 2016) shows that 8th grade students 
from schools located close to medical marijuana dispensaries (short traveling distance, <5 
miles) were more likely to have recently use marijuana compared to those from schools 
located farther apart from dispensaries (>25 miles). To date, there is little information on 
how perceived availability is associated with marijuana use among adults, those comprising 
the majority of licensed medical marijuana users (Anderson et al., 2015a), as well as the 
total overall users of marijuana. To our knowledge, no study has investigated whether 
perceived availability of marijuana is associated with the relationship between state medical 
marijuana laws and the state-level differences in prevalence of marijuana use in the U.S. 
general population. Also, although evidence suggests that MML are associated with 
increases in marijuana use among those ages 21 and older (Wen et al., 2015), is not clear if 
all adults (age sub-groups) have been influenced in the same way and whether perceived 
availability could be linked to increase use across all age sub-groups. Our study aims to 
address these gaps.
In addition, because MML are intended to target mostly the population of older patients with 
illnesses that can be potentially be treated with medical marijuana (e.g., chronic pain or 
cancer; Fairman, 2016), it is likely that MML laws affect different age groups differently, 
and through different modes of access (Hasin et al., 2015). Understanding the potential 
externalities of MML in different age groups, such as potential increases in recreational 
marijuana use among adolescents, young adults and older adults, would improve our 
understanding of the effects of marijuana policies and provide information about the types of 
public health responses that should accompany major policy changes related to marijuana.
Therefore, the aims of this paper are: 1) To examine the relationship between state-level 
MML and past-month marijuana use among adolescents, young adults and older adults in 
the US household population from 2004–2013; 2) To examine whether state-level MML is 
associated with perceptions of marijuana availability; and 3) To assess whether perceptions

 of marijuana availability are associated with past-month marijuana use among adolescents, 
young adults and older adults.
2. METHODS
2.1. Data
Observations came from ten years of annual cross-sectional survey data from the National 
Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) restricted use data portal 2004–2013 (CBHSQ, 
2015). Since 2004 (first year in which restricted-access NSDUH data are made available), 
data on more than 17,500 youth (12–17 years-old), 17,500 young adults (18–25 years-old) 
and 18,800 adults older than 26 years old have been collected yearly in the NSDUH. The 
NSDUH was designed to produce estimates of drug and alcohol use prevalence, as well as 
drug use patterns and their consequences, in the general U.S. civilian population aged 12 and 
older. Multi-stage probability sampling designs are used to collect the annual cross sectional 
surveys. The survey employs a 50 state design with an independent multistage area 
probability sample for each state and the District of Columbia. Importantly, the survey 
design allows for computation of estimates that are representative of each state in all 50 
States plus the District of Columbia. Younger age groups (youths aged 12–17 and young 
adults aged 18–25) are oversampled. Each state's sample was therefore approximately 
equally distributed among three major age groups: 12 to 17 years, 18 to 25 years, and 26 
years or older. Design-based weights adjust for nonresponse and post-stratify to the known 
total US population aged 12 and older. Professional field interviewers collect information 
using computer-assisted interviewing methods, including audio computer-assisted self-
interviewing that had built-in skip, logic, and consistency checks. This use of audio 
computer-assisted self-interviewing provides respondents with a highly private and 
confidential means of responding to sensitive questions, increasing the level of honest 
reporting of illegal drug use and other sensitive behaviors (SAMHSA, 2006, 2007, 2012). 
Survey screening response rates vary from 84%–91% and interview response rates vary from 
72%–77% during these years. The reliability and validity of the NSDUH measures has been 
documented (Harrison et al., 2007; Hunter et al., 2005; Piper et al., 2006; SAMHSA, 2010).
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Primary Exposure variables: State-level Medical Marijuana Laws—Our 
primary exposure was state-level MML, parameterized as a time-varying 3-level variable 
indicating whether the state had a MML in a particular year or not, as determined through 
review of state policies by legal scholars, economists, and policy analysts at RAND 
Corporation (Pacula et al., 2014) (Supplementary Table 11). States without MML by 2013 
were coded as “never” states for all years in our data (2004–2013). States enacting MML 
were coded as “before” for the years in which they had not yet enacted a MML, and as 
“after” for the year in which they enacted a MML and also all years after. The 11 states that 
passed MML prior to or during 2004 were coded as “after” on this variable for all years 
from 2004–2013. This strategy enabled us to examine before versus after change in risk of

 marijuana use and availability within the 10 states that passed MML during 2005–2013, 
while controlling for contemporaneous trends in states that never enacted MML.
2.2.2. Outcomes
2.2.2.1. Individual -level past-month marijuana use: NSDUH participants answered 
whether they had used marijuana during the past month. This variable was dichotomous 
indicating any use or not in the past month.
2.2.2.2. Individual-level perceived Availability of Marijuana: In the NSDUH, all 
respondents answered one question regarding current perceived availability of marijuana. 
Respondents were asked “The next questions ask how difficult you think it would be for you 
to get each of the following types of drugs, if you wanted some. How difficult or easy would 
it be for you to get some marijuana, if you wanted some?”, with these possible answers 
being offered: probably impossible, very difficult, fairly difficult, fairly easy or very easy. 
We dichotomized this variable into those reporting that marijuana was fairly or very easy to 
obtain vs. all others, similar to the approach used in Schuermeyer et al. 2014.
2.2.3. Individual-Level Covariates—Individual-level control variables included sex, 
race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Non-Hispanic Mixed 
Race, Asian/Native American/Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander), insurance status (yes/no) 
and annual household family income (4 levels). Also included was a contextual covariate 
indicating population density of the location of the household (Core-Based Statistical Area 
(CBSA): CBSA with more than 1 million persons, CBSA with less than 1 million persons, 
not in a CBSA).
2.2.4. State-Level Covariates—State-level control variables included proportion of each 
state’s population male, white, aged 10–24, and at least high school education in population 
aged >25 years, state unemployment rate and median household income. Census values from 
2000 and 2010 were used for 2004–2005 and 2006–2013, respectively.
2.3. Statistical analyses
For descriptive purpose, the prevalence of marijuana use in the past-month and the 
prevalence of endorsing that marijuana was “fairly” or “very easy” to obtain were calculated 
for each year, 2004–2013, by averaging NSDUH weighted state level prevalence estimates 
across three MML groups (according to whether MML states had pre/post-MML NSDUH 
data): 1) states without MML by 2013; 2) states having pre/post-MML data during the study 
period, i.e., those enacting laws from 2005 to 2013 (RI, NM, MI, AZ, NJ, DE, CT, MA, IL, 
NH, because states enacting laws in 2004 do not have pre-MML data they are not included 
in this group); 3) states with only post-MML data, i.e., states enacting MML before or 
during 2004 (CA, OR, WA, AK, ME, CO, NV, HI, MD, MT, VT). (Figure 1 - A and B). 
Summaries were stratified by three age groups: 12–17, 18–26, and 26 and older consistent 
with NSDUH sampling design. The District of Columbia was not included in the analyses.
Multilevel logistic regression was used to test the association between MML and individual-
level past-month marijuana use and perceived availability. Separate models were fit for each

 outcome with a primary state-level predictor indicating MML status by year: never passed 
(non-MML), before MML passage, or after MML passage and controlling for historical 
trends in marijuana use across the 2004–2013 years using a piecewise cubic spline function 
(de Boor, 1978) of year with a knot at 2008, other individual- and state- level covariates 
described above, and a random intercept for state to account for clustering of individuals 
within states (see supplementary material 12 for the model and SAS Proc GLIMMIX code). 
The estimated variance of the random state intercept was statistically significant in all 
models indicating its need to be included to control for clustering of responses at the state 
level. Models were stratified by age in three categories (12–17, 18–25, 26+). In post-hoc 
analyses, the 26+ age group was subdivided into three additional age groups (26–39, 40–64, 
65+) to examine whether associations between MML and marijuana use and perceived 
availability differed across the adult sub-group.
From the fitted multilevel logistic regression, adjusted prevalence of use was estimated by 
age group for states that never passed a MML, states before they passed a MML and states 
after they passed a MML using least squares means. Further, adjusted odds ratios (AORs) 
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the “Before vs. Never” and “After vs. Before” 
contrasts were also computed for each of the three age groups. Sampling weights were not 
included, as the model directly incorporated all individual-level variables related to the 
sampling design (Little, 2004).
To assess whether perceived availability of marijuana is associated with past-month 
marijuana use, an additional model was fit. The model was the same as the model described 
above with past month marijuana use as the outcome, but with the addition of individual 
level perceived availability as a predictor.
As a sensitivity analysis, all three of the models discussed above were also fit using logistic 
regression treating state as a fixed effect, rather than as random effect, yielding similar 
results (not shown, available upon request). All analyses were carried out in SAS (SAS 
version 9.3, Cary, NC, USA) available in the SAMHSA data portal.
3. RESULTS
Past-month prevalence of marijuana use and perceived availability (marijuana is fairly or 
very easy to obtain) during the 2004–2013 period was higher among individuals aged 18–25 
compared with those ages 12–17 and those 26 or older regardless of MML state status. 
(Figure 1A–1B).
States that ever passed MML had higher prevalence of past-month marijuana use in each age 
group before passing MML compared to states that never passed these laws (Table 1A and 
Figure 1A). However, among 12–17 and 18–25 year-olds, there was no evidence that MML 
were related to changes in the prevalence of past-month marijuana use during the study 
period (Table 1B) (After vs. Before MML: 12–17 yrs old AOR = 1.03, 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.97, 1.09; 18–25 yrs old AOR = 0.97, CI: 0.93, 1.02). Among individuals ages 
26 and older, there was an increase in prevalence of past-month marijuana use after MML 
(7.15%) compared to before (5.87%) (AOR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.31) during the study

 period (2004–2013). Further, when the age 26+ was subdivided into three subgroups (26–39, 
40–64, 65+), prevalence of past-month marijuana use increased after MML passage in all of 
the older age groups. In those 26–39, prevalence increased from 8.9% to 10.2% (AOR=1.2 
[1.1, 1.3], p<0.0001); among those 40–64, from 4.5% to 6.0% (AOR: 1.4 [1.2, 1.5], 
p<0.0001); and among those 65+ from 0.3% to 0.8% (AOR: 2.6 [1.5, 4.6], p=0.0006) 
(Supplementary Table 23).
Similar to the findings between MML enactment and marijuana use, states that eventually 
passed MML had higher perception of easy availability of marijuana even before passage 
(Table 2A and Figure 1B). Also similar to marijuana use, there was no effect of MML on a 
change in perception of availability of marijuana among adolescents (12–17) or young adults 
(18–25) (Table 2B), but there was a significant increase in perceiving marijuana as easily 
available, from 59.4% to 61.8%, among those 26+ (AOR=1.11, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.15). This 
significant increase in perceiving marijuana as easily available was found in all three 
subgroups of those aged 26+ (see Supplementary Table 34).
Across age groups individuals that perceived marijuana as easily available (vs. difficult) had 
a much higher likelihood of past-month marijuana use (Table 3). This was consistent across 
all age groups, including those 26–39, 40–64, 65+ (Supplementary table 45). Of note, among 
those 26 and older, the magnitude of the association between MML and the prevalence of 
marijuana use decreased by 19% when perceived availability was added to model. The 
magnitude of the association between MML and marijuana use also decreased by 14.7%, 
14.5%, and 13.0%, in those 26–39, 40–64, 65+, respectively after including perceived 
availability in the model.
4. DISCUSSION
This study shows an increase in the prevalence of past-month marijuana use from the before 
to the after MML period in adults 26–39, 40–64, and 65+ between 2004–2013. There was no 
increase in the prevalence of past-month in adolescent or young adult comparing the before 
and after MML periods in states that implemented MML. These findings are consistent with 
findings from prior studies (Anderson et al., 2015b; Choo et al., 2014; Harper et al., 2012; 
Hasin et al., 2015; Lynne-Landsman et al., 2013; Wall et al., 2011). Moreover, there was also 
no increase in perceived availability of marijuana among adolescents or young adults, which 
suggest that, consistent with other studies (Wall et al., 2011; Hasin et al., 2015), externalities 
of MML among adolescents and young adults may have not occurred to date. Finally, 
perceived availability was associated with both MML and marijuana use in adults 26–39, 
40–64 and 65+, revealing a potential mechanism that may explain the increase in use among 
adults. However, the fact that the prevalence of past-month adult marijuana was already 
higher before MML passage when compared to states that have not yet passed MML, 
suggest that this could be a more complex relationship, with other factors besides perceived 
availability potentially being associated with marijuana use patterns in the population.
While we only assessed cross-sectional relationships across time, it is possible that the 
association between perceived availability and marijuana use is bi-directional (i.e., not only 
having a perception of marijuana being available would lead to marijuana use, but already

 marijuana users could be more likely to endorse that marijuana is easily available). There are 
different scenarios that could explain the increase in perceived availability of marijuana 
among those 26+ living in MML states during the post-legislation period: 1) MML it is in 
fact associated with increases in the availability of marijuana both for medical and non-
medical purposes as argued by Smart (2015); 2) those 26 and older who started using 
marijuana after MML were enacted could have a different perception of the availability of 
marijuana because they are now actively accessing the medical marijuana market as 
marijuana users, even when the overall availability of marijuana remained relatively stable; 
3) media reports about MML enactment could influence individuals’ perception of 
marijuana availability, even when such availability has not increased; 4) other factors, 
different from MML, such as the decriminalization of marijuana possession (Pacula and 
Sevigny, 2014), which occurred simultaneously or together with the enactment of MML, 
could be associated with greater availability of marijuana and in turn with individuals’ 
perception of marijuana availability.
The observed increase in the prevalence of past-month marijuana use among adults 26–39, 
40–64, and 65+ could be in part due to increased availability of medical marijuana to treat 
medical conditions in individuals registered in medical marijuana programs, mostly adults 
30 and older (Fairman, 2016). However, this increase could be also due to the increases in 
the diversion of medical marijuana to individuals using it for recreational purposes 
(Nussbaum et al., 2015; RMHIDTA, 2014; Wirfs-Brock et al., 2010). The exact nature of the 
role of marijuana availability on marijuana use patterns (e.g., relaxing norms and changing 
attitudes towards marijuana use) is not clear, but our findings suggest that availability could 
be a factor contributing to increases in marijuana use among adults after MML are enacted 
in a similar way as it has been suggested for other substances such as alcohol (Campbell et 
al., 2009).
Limitations are noted. Current perceived availability was only measured in the NSDUH by a 
single question and we are not aware of studies evaluating the reliability of this item in sub-
groups of adolescents and young adults; SAMHSA staff (personal communication) believes 
there is no reason that adolescents should interpret this question differently from adults. It is 
possible however, that if this question provides an unreliable measure of the construct 
among adolescents, MML enactment would not have an effect on this variable among 
adolescents. It should be noted that the question used in NSDUH is very similar to the 
perceived availability of marijuana question used in the Monitoring the Future survey, a 
measure believed to have a rather high level of face validity (Miech et al., 2015). In addition, 
given that we used cross-sectional data we are unable to identify if perceived availability 
preceded marijuana use or not, thus we could not identify the temporality of the association. 
Additionally, NSDUH only has data for years 2004–2013, and therefore we were unable to 
examine the effects of MML in states enacting these laws before 2004, and it is possible that 
different effects could have occurred in these states. Nonetheless, a major strength of the 
present study is its use of a large nationally representative sample, allowing for 
generalization of findings to the U.S. non-institutionalized population. Finally, there is 
evidence (Pacula et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2015) showing that MML are in fact 
heterogeneous, and that some aspects, such as allowances on home cultivation or 
dispensaries, might have a role in changes in several health outcome indicators. Future

 research should examine what elements of MML and also other local aspects contribute to 
changes in marijuana use outcomes and perceptions of availability of marijuana in the 
general population.
In conclusion, this study shows that, from 2004 to 2013, in the U.S. general population of 
the 23 states with MML by 2015, there was evidence for an increase in the prevalence of 
past-month marijuana use from the before to the after MML period in adults 26 and older. 
Perceived availability was associated with both MML and marijuana use among adults 26 
and older. Other unexplored factors need to be examined to better understand why the 
prevalence of past-month marijuana use increased in adults 26 and older following MML but 
remained stable among younger cohorts.
