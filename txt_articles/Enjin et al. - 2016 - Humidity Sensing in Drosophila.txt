In Brief
Enjin et al. describe genes and neurons
necessary for humidity responses in
Drosophila. Humidity responses require
the ionotropic receptors IR25a, IR93a,
and IR40a, expressed in specialized
neurons of the antennal sacculus.
Humidity preference is innate and species
specific: ‘‘desert’’ flies prefer a drier
environment, while ‘‘rainforest’’ flies
prefer a humid one.

SUMMARY
Environmental humidity influences the fitness and
geographic distribution of all animals [1]. Insects in
particular use humidity cues to navigate the environ-
ment, and previous work suggests the existence of
specific sensory mechanisms to detect favorable hu-
midity ranges [2–5]. Yet, the molecular and cellular
basis of humidity sensing (hygrosensation) remains
poorly understood. Here we describe genes and neu-
rons necessary for hygrosensation in the vinegar fly
Drosophila melanogaster. We find that members of
the Drosophila genus display species-specific hu-
midity preferences related to conditions in their
native habitats. Using a simple behavioral assay,
we find that the ionotropic receptors IR40a, IR93a,
and IR25a are all required for humidity preference
in D. melanogaster. Yet, whereas IR40a is selectively
required for hygrosensory responses, IR93a and
IR25a
mediate
both
humidity
and
temperature
preference. Consistent with this, the expression of
IR93a and IR25a includes thermosensory neurons
of the arista. In contrast, IR40a is excluded from the
arista but is expressed (and required) in specialized
neurons innervating pore-less sensilla of the sa-
cculus, a unique invagination of the third antennal
segment. Indeed, calcium imaging showed that
IR40a neurons directly respond to changes in humid-
ity, and IR40a knockdown or IR93a mutation reduced
their responses to stimuli. Taken together, our re-
sults suggest that the preference for a specific
humidity range depends on specialized sacculus
neurons, and that the processing of environmental
humidity can happen largely in parallel to that of tem-
perature.
RESULTS
Humidity Preference Is Innate and Species Specific
To test the humidity preference of Drosophila, we devised a
behavioral assay where flies are given a choice between different
levels of relative humidity (RH). We took advantage of the hygro-
scopic features of super-saturated salt solutions [6] and created
niches with different RH levels in a multi-well plate (Figure 1A;
see legend for details). Super-saturated solutions of LiCl, NaCl,
or KH2PO4 yielded stable levels of �20%, �70%, and �85%
RH, respectively, while headspace above the wells remained at
constant temperature (Figures 1B and 1C) and did not contain
detectable volatiles (not shown), providing a simple test for hu-
midity preference. When confronted with the choice between
20% and 70% RH, wild-type D. melanogaster consistently chose
the moist side, so that after 4 hr almost all flies were at 70% RH
(Figure 1D). In contrast, when given a choice between 70% and
85%, flies preferred the drier side (Figure 1E). This is broadly
consistent with previous reports [7], and suggests that flies
have an innate preference for �70% RH over 20% and 85%.
If this represents an innate preference, different species of
Drosophila should display predictable humidity preference in
accordance with the climate of their native habitat. Thus, we
next tested the afrotropical species Drosophila teissieri—native
to humid rainforests in west equatorial Africa—and Drosophila
mojavensis—native to the dry Sonoran desert of the South-
western United States and Mexico (Figure 1F). Strikingly,
D. mojavensis preferred 20% over 70% RH, whereas D. teissieri
showed a preference for 85% RH over 70% RH (Figures 1G
and 1H). Taken together, these results suggest that drosophilids
have innate and species-specific humidity preferences.
IR25a, IR93a, and IR40a Are Necessary for Humidity
Preference
The transient receptor potential channels water witch (wtrw) and
nanchung (nan) have previously been implicated in the response
to extreme humidity conditions (0% versus 100% RH) [8]. Yet,
when given a choice between 20% and 70% RH, wtrw1 and
nan36a mutants showed a preference for the humid side (Fig-
ure 1I). Compared to controls, this preference was quantitatively
reduced; nevertheless, the mutants retained the ability to detect
humidity differences. We conclude that these genes are unlikely
the main mediators of hygrosensory responses in Drosophila
(see also [9]).
Previous work has pointed to the fly antenna as a key organ for
the detection of humidity in insects [4, 5]. Most sensory neurons
of the antenna express receptor proteins of the odorant receptor
(OR) [10, 11] or ionotropic receptor (IR) families [12], and broadly
expressed co-receptors are typically required for function: Orco
for ORs [13] and IR8a or IR25a for IRs [14]. Thus, we reasoned
that testing mutants for these co-receptors in our assay could
narrow down the number of candidate humidity receptors.
Both Orco2 and IR8a1 mutants showed normal preference. In

Figure 1. Innate Humidity Preference in Drosophilids
(A) Schematic drawing of our humidity-preference assay. The arena uses the hygroscopic features of super-saturated salt solutions to create niches with different
humidity levels. Forty-eight-well plates, filled with salt solutions, are covered by a fine nylon mesh for the flies to walk on without being able to reach the liquid in
the wells. Flies are placed in the arena and provided with the choice between two different RH ranges, while a camera images their position for 4 hr.

 contrast, humidity preference was essentially abolished in
IR25a2 mutants (Figure 1J).
IR25a is associated with seven specific receptors. Four of
these (IR41a, IR75d, IR76a, and IR92a) have well-described
high-affinity volatile ligands [15]. Three IR25a-dependent recep-
tors, IR21a, IR93a, and IR40a, instead remain orphan. Thus, we
next tested whether mutations in these genes affect humidity
preference. An IR21a mutant (IR21aEP526) showed normal
humidity preference (Figure S1A). In contrast, IR93a mutants
(IR93aMI05555
and
IR93aMI05555/Df(IR93a))
displayed
strong
humidity-preference defects (Figure 1K). IR40a mutants are
not available, yet RNAi-mediated knockdown of IR40a through-
out the nervous system (i.e., in n-synaptobrevin-Gal4>UAS-
IR40aRNAi flies) also strongly affected humidity preference
(Figure 1K). Thus, we conclude that IR25a, IR93a, and IR40a
are all required for humidity-preference behavior.
Hygrosensation has previously been proposed to comprise a
thermosensory component [5, 16]. Hence, we next set out to
determine whether IR21a, IR25a, IR93a, and IR40a also mediate
temperature responses. We used a two-choice test for temper-
ature preference, assaying a wide range of test temperatures
(10�C–40�C, in 5�C steps) over the preferred 25�C (Figure 1L)
[17, 18]. In this assay, IR21aEP526, IR25a2, and IR93aMI05555
mutant flies displayed significant temperature-preference de-
fects in both hot and cold ranges (Figure 1M; Figure S1B). In
contrast, despite a strong humidity-preference phenotype,
nSyb>IR40aRNAi flies reported a normal temperature preference
(Figure 1M; Figure S1B). We conclude that IR25a and IR93a are
required for both humidity and temperature preference, whereas
IR40a is selectively required for hygrosensory responses.
Humidity Responses Are Mediated by No-Pore Sensilla
of the Sacculus
Ournextgoal wasto discoverthecellularsubstratesfor hygrosen-
sation. Based on the mutant phenotypes described above, we
hypothesized that the sensory neurons mediating humidity re-
sponses co-express IR25a, IR93a, and IR40a. Consistent with a
role as co-receptor, IR25a expression is broad, and includes ol-
factory neurons in the third antennal segment, thermosensory
neurons of the arista, and neurons innervating the sacculus [12].
Previous work has shown that IR40a and IR93a are indeed co-
expressed in a small group of cells surrounding the sacculus
(a unique invagination of the third antennal segment), and this
structure has been suggested to contain hygroreceptors [19].
Hence, we set out to determine the organization of the IR-ex-
pressing sacculusneurons.Gal4 drivers areavailablethat recapit-
ulate the expression of IR25a and IR40a, whereas previous at-
tempts to produce IR93a-Gal4 have been unsuccessful [14, 15].
Here we used two different IR93a drivers representing extremes
of the range of expression we observed in search of a faithful
driver for IR93a-expressing cells. IR93a-LexA labels neurons tar-
geting the sacculus andall thermoreceptors of the arista, whereas
VT044927-Gal4 (derived from a single IR93a enhancer) is ex-
pressed in a handful of sacculus neurons and in a variable number
of cells in the arista (see Figure S2 for further validation of the
expression of these genes in the antenna). The sacculus is
composed of three chambers (Figures 2A and 2C), each housing
sensilla with distinct morphology. Those housed in chambers I
and II are of the so-called no-pore type (Figures 2B and 2D), are
innervated by two or three neurons, and show similarity to hygro-
sensillaofotherinsects[19].Toexaminewhich sensillaandcham-
bers are innervated by neurons expressing IR25a, IR93a, and
IR40a, we expressed CD8:GFP under the control of each driver
and analyzed intact antennae by confocal microscopy. IR25a-
Gal4 labeled most neurons innervating chambers I–III of the
sacculus, as well as all thermosensors of the arista (Figures 2E
and 2G; [18]). In contrast, IR40a-Gal4 exclusively labeled cells
targeting the no-pore sensilla located in chambers I and II (Fig-
ure 2F). Specifically, IR40a-Gal4 labeled one cell per sensillum
in chamber I, and two cells per sensillum in chamber II (Figure 2G).
The IR93a-LexA driver labeled two or three cells per sensillum
in both chambers I and II (data not shown), whereas the more
selective VT044927-Gal4 driver was active in a subset of
chamber I neurons and only one cell/sensillum in chamber II
(Figure 2G). Cell counts in animals expressing GFP under the
control of both IR40a- and VT044927-Gal4 revealed similar
numbers, suggesting that VT044927-Gal4 is expressed in a sub-
population of IR40a-Gal4 cells (Figure 2G). We conclude that
IR25a, IR93a, and IR40a are likely co-expressed in neurons tar-
geting chambers I and II.
These IR drivers also gave us the opportunity to directly test
in which cell type the activity of IR40a may be required to
mediate humidity preference, i.e., by targeted knockdown using
IR40aRNAi. Driving IR40aRNAi in IR25a- or IR40a-Gal4 cells pro-
duced flies in which humidity preference was abolished (Fig-
ure 2H), and a similar effect was observed when UAS-IR40aRNAi
was expressed under the control of the narrowly expressed
VT044927 driver. Moreover, expression of a UAS-IR93a trans-
gene under the control of this driver was sufficient to rescue
the humidity-preference phenotype of IR93aMI05555/Df(IR93a)
mutants (Figure 2H), indicating that IR40a and IR93a are required
in a relatively small number of chamber I/II sacculus neurons to
mediate humidity preference.
Sacculus Neurons Project to Distinct Glomeruli in the
Posterior Antennal Lobe
In which region of the fly brain are humidity stimuli represented?
To address this question, we used IR25a- and IR40a-Gal4 to ex-
press CD8:GFP, and followed labeled axons from the antenna to
the brain. IR25a>GFP projections innervated a subset of olfac-
tory glomeruli of the antennal lobe (not shown), as well as the
‘‘hot’’ and ‘‘cold’’ glomeruli of the posterior antennal lobe (PAL)
(Figure 3A) [18]. In addition, IR25a-Gal4 also labeled two
glomeruli of unusual shape, previously described as ‘‘Arm’’ (or
VP4) and ‘‘Column’’ (or VP1) (Figures 3A and 3B) [15, 20].
IR40a>GFP termini were prominent in both the Arm and Column,
but did not target the hot or cold glomeruli of the PAL (Figures
3C–3E). Both IR93a-LexA and VT044927-Gal4 also labeled
projections innervating the Arm and Column, as well as thermo-
sensory glomeruli (data not shown). Hence, given the selective
requirement for IR40a in humidity preference, the Arm and Col-
umn are candidate glomeruli for the representation of humidity.
The Arm Glomerulus Responds to Dry Air
To determine which structures in the brain are activated by hu-
midity changes, we first used the fluorescent calcium sensor
CaMPARI [21]. When bound to calcium, the CaMPARI protein
can be converted from green to red by 400-nm light illumination,
1354
Current Biology 26, 1352–1358, May 23, 2016
 persistentlylabelingneuronsthatareactive (i.e.,neuronswithhigh
intracellular calcium) during the temporal window of illumination.
We expressed CaMPARI under the control of IR25a-Gal4, and
exposed flies to fast changes in humidity at constant temperature
(Figure S3A) while simultaneously illuminating the fly head. When
IR25a>CaMPARI(V398D) flies were exposed to a dry stimulus, we
observed consistent photoconversion of the Arm glomerulus but
no conversion of the Column (Figures 3F–3H). Humid stimuli, on
the other hand, failed to consistently photoconvert any structures
labeled by our IR25a-Gal4 line (data not shown).
Next, we used two-photon calcium imaging to determine the
dynamic response of the Arm glomerulus to changes in humidity,
by expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP6m under the control
of IR40a-Gal4 (Figures 3I and 3J). In accordance with the
CaMPARI results, the Arm responded with a rapid, reversible
calcium increase to dry-air stimuli (Figure 3K). Interestingly, the
same glomerulus also responded to humid air, but this time
with a corresponding decrease in [Ca2+]i (Figure 3K). As in
CaMPARI, the Column did not show specific responses to
changes in humidity (Figure 3L). Calcium imaging experiments
from flies expressing GCaMP6m under the control of the
IR25a-Gal4 and VT044927-Gal4 drivers produced similar results
(i.e., we observed responses to dry air limited to the Arm and no
Ca2+ increases in response to humid air stimuli; Figures S3B–
S3D and data not shown). Next, we asked whether IR40a and
IR93a are required for the dynamic responses of the Arm glomer-
ulus to dry air. Indeed, responses recorded in the Arm glomer-
ulus were reduced (albeit not abolished) in IR93aMI05555 and
IR40aRNAi flies (Figure 3M). The fact that calcium responses
were not entirely abolished (vis-a
` -vis the behavioral phenotypes
of both IR93aMI05555 and IR40aRNAi knockdown) may indicate
that behavior requires a rather finely tuned hygrosensory input,
or perhaps reflects the different timescales of functional imaging
and behavioral testing.
In a previous study, IR40a was suggested as the receptor for
the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET)
([22], but see [23]). Although such a function is difficult to recon-
cile with the fact that IR40a-expressing neurons are found in
sensilla lacking pores [19], this is potentially interesting, as it
may suggest a hygrosensory component to the repellent effect
of DEET. Yet, we observed no responses to DEET in our
IR40a>GCaMP6m line (Figure 3N). Thus, it seems unlikely that
IR40a (or its orthologs in, e.g., mosquitoes) is the main mediator
of DEET avoidance.
Thermosensory and Hygrosensory Responses in the
PAL Are Anatomically and Functionally Separable
Localized evaporative cooling has been suggested as a potential
mechanism for dry-air responses [5, 24, 25]. Hence, we next
tested whether the Arm may also be activated by temperature

 changes. We again turned to calcium imaging and recorded
responses of the Arm and Column of IR25a>GCaMP6m flies
to thermal stimulation (Figures 4A–4C). The Arm glomerulus
showed little response to temperature changes (Figure 4B).
Slight, cooling-induced [Ca2+] transients could only be observed
for cooling steps larger than �5�C (Figure 4B). This is quite
different from the sensitive responses of the hot and cold
glomeruli to temperature changes (Figures 4D and 4E; see also
[18]). The Column was, however, activated by cooling stimuli of
small magnitude (Figure 4C), albeit these responses were still
somewhat smaller than those of the cold glomerulus (compare
to Figure 4D). Interestingly, whereas targeted IR40aRNAi reduced
the Arm responses to dry air, the same intervention did not
reduce the responses of the Arm and Column to cooling (Fig-
ure S4). This suggests that cooling responses in the Arm and
Column do not require IR40a, and are therefore unlikely to
mediate humidity preference in our assay.
We next wondered whether the cold-induced activity of the
Arm or Column contributes to temperature-preference behavior.
We silenced IR40a-expressing Arm and Column neurons by
expression of the Kir2.1 potassium channel (i.e., by hyperpolar-
ization) under the control of the IR40a-Gal4 driver, and tested the
resulting flies for temperature preference. IR40a>Kir2.1 flies
displayed normal thermal preference (Figure 4F), despite the ex-
pected strong defects in humidity preference (Figure 4G). This
result indicates that although the Arm and Column respond to
cooling stimuli, this activity is not essential for rapid temperature
preference. As a control, expression of Kir2.1 under IR25a-Gal4
(expressed in both the arista and sacculus) resulted in strong
defects in both humidity and temperature preference (data not
shown and Figure 4F). Together, our data suggest that thermo-
sensory and hygrosensory responses can be genetically and
functionally separated in the fly antenna, and that the preference
for a suitable relative humidity range involves specialized
sacculus neurons that co-express IR40a, IR93a, and IR25a
and directly respond to changes in external humidity.
DISCUSSION
Due to their small size and low heat capacity, insects are at con-
stant risk of desiccation. As a result, they have evolved uniquely
sensitive receptor systems to sense and respond to changes in
the amount of water vapor in the air. Here we describe genes and
neurons necessary for hygrosensory responses in the vinegar fly

 D. melanogaster. Our work identifies sacculus neurons inner-
vating chambers I and II as essential players in the behavioral
responses to environmental humidity. These neurons appear to
co-express IR25a, IR93a, and IR40a but, whereas IR25a and
IR93a are also required for thermal preference, IR40a is uniquely
important for hygrosensory responses. Genetic labeling of
IR40a-expressing neurons also allowed us to track their projec-
tions to the brain and to identify a unique glomerular structure
(the Arm) that responds to specific changes in external humidity,
i.e., ‘‘dry-air’’ stimuli.
Work in other insects suggests that the neural response to
dry air could be mediated by evaporative cooling (as in man-
made evaporation detectors, or psychrometers) [5, 24, 25].
Yet, the poor thermal sensitivity of IR40a neurons targeting
the
Arm
(and
their
unchanged
responses
to
cooling
in
IR40aRNAi) seems to disfavor this model. Furthermore, sensilla
responding to changes in humidity have been electrophy-
siologically characterized in a number of insects [24, 26, 27],
and typically consist of a ‘‘dry cell’’ and a ‘‘moist cell’’ (i.e.,
activated by humid air) housed in the same sensillum together
with a ‘‘cold cell.’’ We identify here a dry-cell type associated
with a cold-responding one in the sacculus. This indicates
that hygrosensilla may share a common organization across
insect groups.
The results we present here reveal some of the cellular sub-
strates and molecular transducers that allow flies to detect
changes in humidity. Interestingly, some of the key molecules
we describe seem to be shared between thermosensory and
hygrosensory neurons, and yet thermal preference and humidity
preference are mediated by independent cellular substrates.
Hence, the two sensory systems can function largely in parallel
in Drosophila, perhaps providing a mechanism to independently
modulate the behavioral responses to each of these two key
environmental parameters.
