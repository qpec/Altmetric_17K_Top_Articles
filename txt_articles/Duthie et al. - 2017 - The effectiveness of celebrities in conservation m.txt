Abstract
Celebrities are frequently used in conservation marketing as a tool to raise awareness, gen-
erate funding and effect behaviour change. The importance of evaluating effectiveness is
widely recognised in both marketing and conservation but, to date, little research into the
effectiveness of celebrity endorsement as a tool for conservation marketing has been pub-
lished. Using a combination of interviews and an online choice survey instrument, we inves-
tigated the extent to which a sample of UK-based conservation organisations, and other
charities, evaluate their own usage of celebrity endorsement, and then carried out an experi-
mental evaluation of a hypothetical marketing campaign. This experiment compared partici-
pants’ willingness-to-engage (WTE) with, and recall of, a conservation message presented
in versions of an advert featuring one of three prominent UK celebrities (David Beckham,
Chris Packham or HRH Prince William) or a non-celebrity control treatment (featuring Craw-
ford Allan, a director of TRAFFIC USA). We find that the organisations we interviewed did
not routinely evaluate their marketing campaigns featuring celebrities. Furthermore, our
experiment provides evidence that celebrity endorsement can produce both positive and
negative effects. Participants were more willing to engage when presented with an advert
featuring one of the three celebrities than the non-celebrity control, and WTE varied accord-
ing to the characteristics of the celebrity and the respondent. However, celebrities were less
effective at generating campaign message recall than non-celebrities. These findings sug-
gest that celebrity endorsement should be used carefully. Further work is required to fully
understand the role celebrity endorsers can play in conservation but, drawing on best prac-
tice from the field of marketing, this study introduces an approach to evaluation which could
be applied more widely to improve the effectiveness of conservation marketing.
Introduction
It is increasingly acknowledged that effective conservation is ultimately dependent on influ-
encing human attitudes and behavior [1,2]. As with most businesses, conservation non-

 governmental organizations (NGOs) are dependent on marketing their products and services
to the broader populous to effectively and efficiently realize their goals. The field of con-
servation marketing is increasingly being recognised as an important component in the con-
servation communities’ toolkit, demonstrated recently by the formation of the Society for
Conservation Biology’s Conservation Marketing and Engagement Working Group (Cons-
Mark) [3]. A key strategy in marketing conservation has been the use of celebrities to promote
environmental and conservation NGOs and their work [4–7]. For example, His Royal High-
ness The Duke of Cambridge was instrumental in the creation of the United For Wildlife part-
nership [8], whilst American actors Harrison Ford and Leonardo DiCaprio are, respectively,
the Vice-Chair for Conservation Internationals’ Board of Directors [9] and donor, campaigner
and board member of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF-US) [10]. Leonardo Dicaprio’s accep-
tance speech at the 2016 Academy Awards focused on climate change, resulting in a substan-
tially higher volume of news articles, social media posts and information searches than either
the 2015 Conference of the Parties or Earth Day [11].
The marketing industry has developed a range of theories and selection techniques over the
last six decades to identify the most effective celebrity attributes for specific types of campaigns
[12]. These include the source credibility model, which posits that celebrities considered
knowledgeable and trustworthy positively impact on the effectiveness of a marketing campaign
[13,14], and the product match-up hypothesis, which posits the effectiveness of an advertising
campaign increases when there is a clear and identifiable link between the celebrity and a
product or service [15,16]. However, despite the wide use of celebrities for marketing products,
the empirical literature is equivocal on the effectiveness of celebrity endorsement. Pringle [17]
argues that celebrities act as indicators of quality, providing a brand with increased publicity
and exposure as well as access to a celebrity’s audience. In addition, a brand is linked by associ-
ation to desirable qualities that consumers believe a celebrity to possess. Consequently celeb-
rity endorsement may generate and retain attention, increase product recall rates in overly
cluttered markets [18,19], and can be a powerful predictor of an intention-to-purchase prod-
ucts or services [20]. However, some studies have found no significant positive effect of celeb-
rity endorsement (e.g., [21,22]) and that celebrity endorsement does not guarantee mass
media coverage [23]. If not carefully managed, celebrities, as with flagship species used to pro-
mote conservation campaigns [24], may become over-exposed by being associated with too
many campaigns, thus diluting their effectiveness [25]. It may even more fundamentally be
that celebrity endorsement targeting the broader public is misplaced, as most donations arise
from personal relationships, as opposed to celebrity influence [7].
Given the rapid pace of environmental destruction, the limit of available funding [26] and
media coverage potentially available to support conservation [27], and donors’ desire to see a
high return-on-investment, it is essential that conservation organizations understand the effec-
tiveness of their marketing. This requires evaluation of their marketing initiatives to under-
stand how consumers perceive their product or service, where it sits within the market place,
and consequently, what refinements can positively alter consumers’ choices [28]. The market-
ing industry undertakes extensive testing to ensure that products and services are recognized
and viewed positively by consumers, but the effectiveness of marketing conducted by conser-
vation organizations (NGOs) is rarely assessed (although see [28]; [7]). This absence of evalua-
tion is surprising for three reasons. Firstly, the conservation sector relies heavily on celebrity
endorsement to increase brand credibility, provide access to new audiences, provide opportu-
nities to effect behavior change in target markets, provide opportunities to raise awareness
(either for an organization, or for a specific issue) and provide opportunities to raise funds,
either for organizations’ or for specific programmes [7]. Secondly, marketing campaigns
are expensive and funding for them limited, meaning ineffective campaigns waste limited

 resources. Finally, the conservation sector is increasingly promoting evidence-based practice
[29] of which evaluation is an essential component.
This study examines how celebrity endorsement is applied by NGOs in the United King-
dom and tests whether celebrity endorsement influences the public’s willingness-to-engage
(WTE) with, and subsequent recall of, conservation organizations’ marketing campaigns.
Respondent’s perceptions of, and responses to, conservation campaigns featuring different
celebrities were also explored. This research demonstrates the limitations of poorly-designed
marketing campaigns driven by celebrity endorsement, and the importance of evaluating the
marketing initiatives of conservation organizations.
Materials and methods
The marketing industry’s standard process for evaluating campaigns prior to release is referred
to as pre-testing and can be subdivided into concept testing (an exploratory technique used for
preliminary ideas) and copy testing (presenting different versions of the same advertisement
and evaluating which variant of the attribute being tested is most effective) [30]. For this study,
we used a combination of semi-structured interviews (SSIs) and an online copy-testing experi-
ment consisting of two choice tasks and an accompanying questionnaire survey.
Semi-structured interviews
We conducted SSIs to examine how conservation practitioners perceive and use celebrities in
their campaigns. Interview guides were developed based on prior discussions with NGO staff
and the literature on celebrity endorsement best practice and covered perceptions of benefits,
methods of evaluating effectiveness and celebrity relationship management. The SSIs were
arranged through snowball sampling with marketing personnel from 10 conservation-focused
NGOs within the United Kingdom [31]. Additionally personnel from two large child protec-
tion charities with dedicated celebrity management teams were interviewed, thereby providing
an alternative perspective and operational strategy. Where possible, face-to-face meetings were
arranged, if this was unfeasible, the interview was held via telephone or email. All SSIs were
conducted between May and June 2014.
Online copy-testing experiment
Two key measures of effective marketing are an audience’s intention to engage with an adver-
tisement’s message (e.g. the intention to adopt a given behavior such as signing a petition,
making a donation or purchasing a product or service) and their subsequent ability to recall
the information the advertisement was intended to convey. For the purposes of this study, we
defined a respondent’s willingness-to-engage (WTE) as the probability they would click on a
link contained in an online advertisement. Recall was defined as the probability that a respon-
dent could correctly describe the message of an advertisement. Our copy-testing experiment
was designed to investigate how these measures of effectiveness were affected by celebrity
endorsement in a conservation setting.
Based on focus-group discussions (see Supporting Information), four advertisements (treat-
ments) were developed in accordance with advertising pre-testing procedure [32,33], each fea-
turing a different male celebrity (three celebrities who have previously endorsed conservation
or environmental causes–David Beckham, Chris Packham and Prince William, Duke of Cam-
bridge–and one non-celebrity–Crawford Allan, Senior Director of TRAFFIC). David Beckham
is an English footballer who captained the England team for six years and is married to the
fashion designer Victoria Beckham. Chris Packham is an English naturalist, author and televi-
sion presenter, known in the United Kingdom for his frank views on conservation and wildlife,

 e.g. stating that he believed pandas should be allowed to become extinct [34] and his recent
work on bird hunting in Malta [35]. The advertisements were made as similar as possible
(within the constraints of the study), with consistent layout, format and presentation (see Sup-
porting Information). Publically available images of the selected individuals were used, cou-
pled with statements each had previously made. Since the consumer behavior and cognitive
psychology literatures show a “picture-superiority effect” (that pictures or images are more
effective than words in conveying messages) for both memory and judgment, it was consid-
ered acceptable for each celebrity to have their own quote [36–38].
The four alternative advertisements formed the basis for our online copy-testing experi-
ment, which comprised two choice tasks and an accompanying questionnaire survey (see Sup-
porting Information). Prior to dissemination, the survey was pilot tested on 17 individuals,
aged from 18 to 63, of both genders and with varying degrees of interest in conservation. The
feedback was positive, with only minor issues concerning clarification of wording and display
issues such as font sizing. Corrections and improvements were made as required. The first
choice task examined how respondent WTE and recall was affected by celebrity endorsement
(compared with the non-celebrity control) and how these effects differed according to respon-
dent characteristics. Each respondent was shown one of the four advertisements randomly
selected by Qualtrics, an online data collection and analysis software package [39] and asked to
state whether they would click on the associated link to find out more (i.e. whether or not they
were willing-to-engage). Subsequently, a set of questions was posed to respondents to gather
data on their: 1) attitude towards the person; 2) awareness of the involvement of that person
with a specified campaign; and 3) belief in the person’s reasons for appearing in the advertise-
ment. At the end of this section respondents were asked whether they could remember what
the campaign was about to measure their recall.
The second choice task sought to understand which of the four advertisements most
appealed to respondents. The four advertisements were presented side-by-side for comparison
and respondents were asked to state whether or not they agreed with a series of statements
about the advertisements (e.g. “His photo caught my eye”). Next, respondents were instructed
to state which of the advertisements would make them most likely to click on the accompa-
nying link, and then asked to select one of several statements describing why they preferred
the celebrity (e.g. “I like him more than the others”). Finally respondents were presented with
a series of questions about their personal characteristics (e.g. gender, age, donation practices).
The survey was disseminated through conservation organization volunteer mailing lists,
social networks (Twitter and Facebook) and social mailing lists such as book groups. Respon-
dents were asked to forward the survey on to three of their friends upon completion in order
capture a larger sample. In total 535 people were approached to participate between 17th July
and 9th August 2014 and 379 responded (71%). Of these, 16 did not provide a preference in
the second choice task reducing the final sample to 363 respondents for that section.
Ethics
The project was designed in full accordance with the Marketing Research Association’s (MRA)
Code of Marketing Research Standards [40] and was approved under the ethics review process
of the MSc in Conservation Science at Imperial College London. Free, voluntary, prior inform-
ed verbal consent was obtained for all focus group, survey and SSI participants. Verbal consent
was deemed sufficient, and authorised by the aforementioned ethics review process, given the
nature and subject matter of the focus groups and surveys. SSI participants were contacted
individually and their decision to participate was considered verbal consent, similarly autho-
rised by the ethics review process. No minors were involved in this study. Survey respondent

 anonymity was ensured by not collecting any personally identifiable information (PII), such as
location or email address. Focus group and SSI responses were coded to ensure anonymity.
Due care was taken to ensure both the source materials and questions were presented impar-
tially, the personalities were not misrepresented, the statement was a direct quote and the
images used were publically available and credited appropriately. All participants were thanked
upon completion, and provided with contact details for securing further information if req-
uired. Feedback on key findings was provided to those who participated in the SSIs and to any
other participants who requested it. SSI responses have been kept anonymous at the request of
the interviewees.
Analysis
Data from the copy-testing experiment were analyzed using R version 3.2.1 [41]. Across the
sample, 72 individuals failed to answer one or more of the survey questions used to generate
predictor variables (see Supporting Information). Rather than remove the responses associated
with these individuals–which can bias results if patterns of non-response are non-random–we
used the multiple imputation procedure implemented in the mi package [42] to replace the
missing data with values sampled from their predictive distribution based on the remainder of
the observed data. In keeping with best practice, we performed 10 such imputation draws and
averaged the results of analyses conducted separately on each draw [42].
We modeled the effects of celebrity endorsement on respondents’ WTE and recall using
Bayesian cumulative logit models to accommodate the ordinal nature of these variables. Pre-
dictor variables were included in the model to represent the respondents’ knowledge of the
celebrity, their explanation for their choice, beliefs about the celebrity’s motivation for appear-
ing in the advertisement and their individual characteristics (see Supporting Information). We
used weakly informative Normal priors (mean = 0, standard deviation = 5) on the parameters
representing cut-off points and weakly informative Cauchy priors (location = 0, scale = 2.5) on
the beta parameters [43].
We modeled respondents’ choices when presented with all four versions of the advertisements
using a Bayesian multinomial logit model with both alternative specific and individual specific
predictor variables (see Supporting Information). Alternative specific predictor variables (respon-
dents’ attitudes towards each of the advertisements) were modeled using common parameters
while individual specific variables (respondents’ explanations for their choice and their individual
characteristics) were modeled with alternative specific parameters. We used weakly informative
Cauchy priors (location = 0, scale = 2.5) on both types of predictor variable [43].
The models were fitted using Stan version 2.7.0 [44]. Four Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) chains were run in parallel for each model for 2,500 iterations, with the first 500 iter-
ations discarded as burn-in. Convergence was assessed using trace plots and Gelman-Rubin
statistics, with values < = 1.01 taken to indicate adequate convergence had been obtained [45].
We also checked the effective sample size and Monte Carlo Standard Error (MCSE) of each
parameter as indicators of the adequacy of MCMC chain length [45]. We present results from
the fitted models as odds ratios (OR) accompanied by 95% credible intervals (95% CI), where
an OR < 1 indicates a negative effect and an OR > 1 indicates a positive effect.
Results
Use and evaluation of celebrities by organizations
Of the U.K. conservation organizations, all used celebrities to a greater or lesser extent in their
marketing and/or fund-raising work and all considered celebrities valuable. Celebrity use dif-
fered across organizations, some seeking ‘credibility’ by association, whilst others sought

 increased social media and press engagement. Accessing new market sectors often involved
celebrities appearing at fund-raising events (e.g., as after dinner speakers) to attract high net-
worth individuals in influential careers (‘elites’) with whom the organization planned to build
a relationship.
All organizations monitored their celebrity-based marketing using web analytics, column
inches or social media engagement. Only one of the 10 conservation organizations, and both
humanitarian organizations, applied formal evaluation procedures. No evaluation of the effec-
tiveness of specific celebrity attributes was conducted by any organization.
All conservation organizations lacked a strategy for developing and maintaining celebrity
partnerships. Most had no formal celebrity engagement strategy, and interactions with celebri-
ties were usually opportunistic and often conducted in an ad hoc manner.
Every organization stated they had not paid a celebrity to appear or act as a spokesperson,
particularly if the celebrity was a patron or trustee. Some organizations would cover celebrities’
costs incurred by involvement (e.g., travel costs).
The effectiveness of celebrity endorsement
Do celebrities ensure higher WTE?.
Respondents displayed higher WTE with a celebrity
compared to the control (Fig 1). The effect of celebrity was linked to the respondents’ beliefs
about the celebrities featured in the advertisements. Respondents who believed that other peo-
ple would be influenced by the support of the celebrity displayed substantially higher WTE
than those who did not (Odds ratio, OR: 5.00; 95% CI: 1.75, 13.81; Fig 2). Respondents report-
ing a celebrity’s statement caught their attention (OR: 6.56; 95% CI: 3.69, 12.02) or that they
often engage with promotional images (OR: 4.68; 95% CI: 2.46, 9.12) displayed higher WTE.
Smaller positive effects occurred where respondents displayed interest in why a celebrity sup-
ported a campaign (OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.17, 3.98) or if they believed the celebrity was knowl-
edgeable about it (OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 0.97, 3.35).
Respondents’ beliefs about why a celebrity was appearing in an advertisement influenced
willingness-to-engage (Fig 2). Those who believed a celebrity appeared because a friend had
asked (OR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.00, 6.01) or because they were being paid (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.01,
3.98) were more likely to engage. Conversely, those believing a celebrity appeared to improve
their own profile were less likely to (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.02).
Older respondents, those who supported one or more conservation NGOs and those who
donated to charities focused on international issues, were also more willing-to-engage (Fig 2).
In combination, scenario-based predictions from our fitted models suggest an individual’s
characteristics can substantially affect their WTE. For example, the fitted model predicts that
43.6% (CI: 22.5%–64.4%) of females, aged 55–64, with a university degree and living in the
countryside would engage with Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, compared with only
15.3% (CI: 4.9%–27.0%) of males, aged 16–24, with no university degree and living in a major
city (in both cases considering scenarios where the individuals are employed, do not support
any conservation NGOs and do not donate to any charities).
Do celebrities increase message recall?.
Respondents were less likely to recall an adver-
tisement message if it featured a celebrity than if it featured the control (Fig 3). Aside from the
specific celebrity featured in the advertisements, few other variables predicted recall well.
Recall was somewhat lower amongst older (OR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.84) and female (OR: 0.6;
95% CI: 0.34, 1.08) respondents but higher amongst those who reported donating to religious
charities (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 0.98, 6.65) but no other predictors produced clear effects (Fig 4).
Why do respondents choose one celebrity over another?.
When presented with all four
advertisements and asked to choose which they preferred, the advertisement featuring Chris

 Packham was the most popular (chosen by 36.9% of respondents), followed by Prince William,
Duke of Cambridge (34.2%), David Beckham (16.8%) and Crawford Allan (12.1%).
Respondents’ choice was predicted by advertisement characteristics, stated preference for a
specific celebrity, and demographic characteristics. The most important advertisement charac-
teristics were the photograph, then the statement. Respondents were more likely to choose a
celebrity when they reported that "His photograph caught my eye" (OR: 17.88; 95% CI: 8.52,
39.34) or "His statement made me want to find out more" (OR: 14.55; 95% CI: 7.19, 30.73; Fig
4A).
Respondents were also more likely to choose a celebrity if they believed he cared about
(OR: 3.75; 95% CI: 1.68, 8.14), was knowledgeable about (OR: 2.68; 95% CI: 1.41, 5.36), or was
known to support (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.82) a specified issue. Celebrities thought to be
using an issue to improve or raise his own profile (OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.78) or might be
being paid for their involvement (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.25, 1.16) were less likely to be preferred.
Respondents who explained their choice by stating “I like him more than the others” were
much more likely to prefer Prince William, Duke of Cambridge (OR: 75.26; 95% CI: 2.88,
2762.31), followed by David Beckham (OR: 49.08; 95% CI: 1.67, 2120.99), Chris Packham (OR:
39.83; 95% CI: 2.08, 1335.76) and Crawford Allan (Fig 4B). Respondents who explained their
choice by stating “His photo caught my eye” were more likely to choose David Beckham (OR:

most often chose Prince William, Duke of Cambridge (OR: 25.41; 95% CI: 3.42, 211.03) or
Chris Packham (OR: 8.80; 95% CI: 1.24, 55.58). Conversely, those who selected “I believe he is
the most knowledgeable about this issue” were most likely to choose Crawford Allan, followed
by Chris Packham (OR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.54) and were very unlikely to choose Prince Wil-
liam, Duke of Cambridge (OR: 0.00; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.02) or David Beckham (OR: 0.00; 95% CI:
0.00, 0.01).
Discussion
Marketing, having existed in some form since humans started trading, has a well-established
body of theory, [46,47], and is a key activity in business practice [48]. It has evolved from
concentrating on the product to the current focus on relationship marketing; the constant con-
nection and interplay between the consumer, product and brand [49]. Consequently many
NGOs are increasingly using new marketing thinking and practice to guide their strategies
and communications [50]. Marketing strategies provide the reference point for all decisions an
organization makes about its marketing concepts and outputs and are critically important for
ensuring resources are used effectively and brand reputation is maintained and developed
[51]. The conservation NGOs in this study, and possibly those more generally, lack a dedicated

 celebrity endorsement strategy. This is problematic, given the on-going and extensive reliance
upon celebrity endorsement and its perceived effectiveness. Furthermore, a lack of formal
celebrity endorsement strategy results in a failure to evaluate celebrity campaigns and therefore
understand the ways in which to maximize the return-on-investment (ROI). This study found
that whilst celebrities can be beneficial in eliciting positive WTE behavior, they can have a neg-
ative effect on message recall, and the choice of celebrity can play a critical role in the effective-
ness of a campaign.
The role of evaluation and evidence-based analysis is considered a priority within the mar-
keting industry [52,53], just as it is within the conservation community [29,54]. However,
while conservation organizations commonly use celebrities to market their campaigns, our
results suggest that they rarely pre-test or evaluate (i.e., employ evidence for) their effective-
ness. Our findings suggest that celebrity endorsement is indeed able to generate higher levels
of WTE amongst the public, corroborating the results of previous studies [55,56]. However,
they also challenge the idea that celebrity endorsement is always beneficial, regardless of appli-
cation–a view that was commonly expressed in our interviews with representatives of conser-
vation organizations–by showing that the public’s WTE with celebrities in conservation
campaigns is nuanced, and driven by multiple factors, with no one approach or technique
being universally effective [6].
Celebrities therefore may not always be the most effective choice for a marketing campaign
and appropriate evaluation is essential. For example, in accordance with the principles of the
Source Credibility Model [57,13], we found that celebrities who were considered to be knowl-
edgeable about an issue generated significantly higher levels of WTE. As Till & Busler [22]
argue, this suggests that celebrity endorsers should ideally be seen to possess expertise about
the product or topic they are promoting. Interestingly, whilst Chris Packham was viewed as
being highly knowledgeable about the illegal wildlife trade, he had never officially spoken
about the issue prior to the data collection period. Thus, his perceived expertise most likely
derives from his role as a nature documentary presenter and campaigner on various wildlife
and conservation related issues (cf. [57,58]). By contrast, Crawford Allan was viewed as the
most knowledgeable (understandably, given his role as Senior Director for Wildlife Crime at
Traffic), but this expertise alone was not enough to generate higher levels of engagement.
It is also important that evaluations of the effectiveness of celebrity endorsement take great
care when selecting their measures of success. Crucially, while we found that celebrity endorse-
ment generates higher WTE, it also led to lower recall of the issues being communicated [59].
There are several factors that may have contributed to this finding. One possibility is that if a
celebrity’s support for a broader issue is well established, that existing association might com-
plicate attempts to communicate a more specific message, resulting in an ineffective campaign.
For example, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge has become well known for his involvement
in wildlife conservation (despite the British Royal Family’s ongoing interest and participation
in blood sports [60]) and particularly his role in forming United for Wildlife, a collection of

estimates are presented on the scale of the linear predictor. Positive values indicate that the variable increases the probability that the
celebrity is chosen relative to the baseline category (Crawford Allan), while negative values indicate that it decreases the probability that
he is chosen. Mean estimates (points) are accompanied by 95% credible intervals, calculated as highest posterior density intervals
(lines). Grey shading is used to highlight groups of conceptually-related predictor variables. Within these groups, the sets of parameters
associated with each predictor variable are ordered by the set mean from most positive to most negative effect to facilitate visual
comparisons.

 elicit higher levels of recall from respondents in the survey. In fact, while levels of full recall
were low, he generated reasonable levels of incomplete recall, suggesting that respondents may
only have been able to recall that Prince William was associated with wildlife conservation in
general. They were not able to remember the exact nature of the issue he was endorsing. A sec-
ond possibility relates to the directed nature of the survey, in which respondents were asked to
look at the advertisement and answer questions accordingly. This is not reflective of the con-
textual nature of marketing, with respondents instructed to examine an advertisement they
might otherwise ignore. Additionally, given the unfamiliarity of Crawford Allan for the major-
ity of respondents, additional cognitive processing would have been necessary, thus resulting
in higher levels of recall [59].
While promoting more widespread evaluation of celebrity endorsement–and conservation
marketing more generally–we recognize that conservation organizations face multiple barriers
that might hinder its adoption. In addition to pressure on resources (financial, staff time and
arguably staff capacity) within conservation NGOs, it is understandable that organizations
do not want to risk wasting a celebrity endorsement opportunity. The majority of celebrity
endorsement in conservation marketing is reliant on goodwill and personal connections. With
little formal guidance available for selecting an endorser, let alone a specific marketing tech-
nique for use, conservation organizations are left grasping at any celebrity endorsement oppor-
tunity available. As shown by this study, this does not necessarily translate into effective
marketing, and in some cases could potentially be detrimental to an issue or organization. Fur-
thermore, conservation organizations are rarely approached by celebrities seeking partnership
opportunities. Instead, organizations draw-up a ‘wish list’ of celebrities they hope to engage
with, and successively work down the list until they find ones who are willing and available.
Whilst it is understandable that for many organizations this is the only process available to
them to secure celebrity endorsement, it runs a substantial risk of identifying a celebrity who
exerts little, or worse, negative influence, particularly given the body of literature reinforcing
the importance of celebrity endorser and brand congruence.
It is vital to ensure campaigns are as effective as possible, which is determined by factors
including the public perception of the brand and the celebrity endorsement itself. Greater
research is required to ensure celebrity endorsement is used in the most effective way, for
example to avoid the perception that their involvement is undermining or belittling the issue
[61]. Future work should aim to understand the celebrity attributes that are most effective, and
the demographic groups they are most effective on. Understanding the role celebrities play in
communicating conservation ideas and issues at both global and local levels is critical for
ensuring celebrity endorsers are used strategically and appropriately. Understanding the effect
celebrity endorsement has on decision- and policy-makers will allow the conservation com-
munity to maximize the return-on-investment of their marketing campaigns. It is also impor-
tant to understand if, and in what contexts, charismatic species of fauna and flora, or other
elements of nature, are more effective than human celebrities in communicating conservation
messages to the public, positively changing behavior and raising funds.
Conclusion
Celebrity endorsement is used to market conservation projects and programmes, however the
reasons conservation NGOs adopt this technique is rarely explored. Furthermore their effec-
tiveness is rarely investigated.
Celebrity endorsement is not unequivocally effective [12], and there is increasing philan-
thropic fatigue from the public [62]. Therefore a key recommendation, based on the marketing
literature, and the findings from this study, are for conservation organizations to focus on

 building brand awareness and equity. Not only will increased brand presence in the market
increase public engagement, but increased brand equity (the assets such as name recognition
and perceived quality that are connected to a brand and give a product or service its value
[63]) will serve as a useful tool in securing celebrity endorsement. Given the lack of marketing
research currently conducted by conservation organizations, this is an area where the research
community could make a substantial and useful contribution to conservation organizations.
Researchers can bypass the risk to reputation and celebrity endorser relationships that conser-
vation organizations may carry if they undertake the research themselves. Whilst celebrities
can prove more effective in generating positive WTE behaviour, they might not be as effective
at generating full campaign message recall and factors such as credibility, likeability and a con-
nection between the campaign and endorser are critical. This study shows the role testing and
evaluation can play in ensuring the maximum impact of celebrity endorsers and how they can
be harnessed to not only raise funds for conservation, but also to raise awareness and effect
behaviour change.
