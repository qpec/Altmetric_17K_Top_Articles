 The case for the promotion of positive mental health or mental
well-being has been made convincingly on both health1 and
economic grounds2 and, as a consequence, mental well-being
now assumes an important place in mental health and public
health policy.3–5 Key features of mental well-being are that it
creates resilience to both mental and physical illness, increases
longevity in general populations,6 increases educational achievement
and enhances performance in the workplace.1 The World Health
Organization (WHO) describes mental well-being as a state in
which the individual realises his or her own abilities, copes with
the normal stresses of life, works productively and makes a
contribution to his or her community.7 Mental well-being is
widely recognised as extending beyond the absence of mental
illness and comprising both affective components (emotions/
feelings) and psychological functioning.1 Arguments have been
advanced that mental well-being and mental illness may represent
two different but correlated continua. In this case mental well-
being can be positive or negative and low mental well-being is
not synonymous with mental illness. For clarity we have referred
in this paper to low and high mental well-being and to mental
illness and positive mental health, which we regard as synonymous
with high mental well-being. Effective public health practice
demands a sound understanding of the determinants not only
of illness but also of positive states of health. Whereas mental
illness is distributed according to familiar social gradients8,9 with
a high prevalence among deprived groups and those living in
poverty, less is known about the social determinants of positive
mental health. There is some indication that the distribution is
different from that for mental illness.
1 The Health Survey for
England (HSE)10 collected data on mental well-being in 2010
and 2011, making it possible to assess socioeconomic gradients
of high and low mental well-being in a large representative sample
of the English population and to test the hypothesis that these
gradients are different from those observed for mental illness.
Method
Study population
The HSE is an annual survey of a nationally representative
population that samples adults and children in households at
private residential addresses.10 In both 2010 and 2011, 66% of
households agreed to participate providing samples of 14 112
(8420 age 16+ years) and 10 617 (8610 age16+ years), respectively.
Detailed information was collected on mental and physical health
in relation to demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of
adults and children. Regarding, ethical approval as the study
design was of secondary data analysis using data collected in the
HSE; permission to use the data was granted by the UK Data
Service.
Mental well-being
The Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS)11
was administered in English only to respondents over 16 years of
age, a total of 17030 people across both years. The WEMWBS is
a well validated, popular measure currently used to monitor mental
well-being in the English public health outcomes framework12 and
the Scottish Government’s Mental Health Indicators data-set.13 It
has been validated in a number of different cultural and linguistic
settings including English-speaking minority ethnic groups in the
UK.14,15 Valid responses were available for 13 983 (82.1%) of adult
(16+ years) respondents for the combined 2010 and 2011 data-
sets. (See online Table DS1 for comparison of respondents and
non-respondents). These were used to define three population

Background
Research on mental well-being is relatively new and studies
of its determinants are rare.
Aims
To investigate whether the socioeconomic correlates of
mental well-being mirror those for mental illness.
Method
Using logistic regression analyses, the independent odds
ratios of high and low mental well-being, compared with
middle-range mental well-being, were estimated for a
number of sociodemographic variables known to be
associated with mental illness from 13 983 participants in the
2010 and 2011 Health Surveys for England.
Results
Independent odds ratios for low mental well-being were as
expected from studies of mental illness with increased odds
for the unemployed (OR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.01–2.10) and those
aged 35–54 years (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.35–1.84) and reduced
odds for the married (OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.62–0.97). A linear
trend was observed with education and equivalised income.
Odds ratios for high mental well-being differed from those
for low mental well-being with regard to age (55+ years:
OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.23–1.79); employment status where there
was an association only with retirement (OR = 1.35, 95% CI
1.09–1.69); education where there was no association; and
equivalised income for which the association was non-linear.
Conclusions
Odds ratios for low mental well-being mirrored those for
mental illness, but not those for high mental well-being,
suggesting that the socioeconomic factors associated with
positive mental health are different from those associated
with mental illness.

 groups: more than one standard deviation from the mean in
either direction (top 15th centile: WEMWBS score 60–70; and
bottom 15th centile: WEMWBS score 14–42) and the remainder
(16–84th percentile: WEMWBS score 43–59). Valid responses
were those in which all items in the scale had been completed.
In the first series of models, odds ratios (ORs) were generated
for the low well-being group compared with the middle-range
group and in the second series for the high well-being group
compared with the middle-range group.
Sociodemographic correlates
Sociodemographic variables known to be relevant to inequalities
in mental illness and available in the HSE data-sets were included.
These were: age (16–34, 35–54, 55+); gender; ethnicity (White,
Indian and Pakistani (including mixed race), African–Caribbean
and African (including mix race), Chinese and other Asian, and
other); religion (none, Christian, Muslim, other); economic status
(employed, unemployed seeking work, retired, economically
inactive);
marital
status
(single,
married/civil
partnership/
cohabitee, divorced/separated/widowed); educational attainment
(NVQ4/NVQ5/degree or equivalent, secondary education to,
NVQ3/GCE A-level equivalent, NVQ2/GCE O-level equivalent,
NVQ1/CSE
other
grade
equivalent,
no
qualification)
and
equivalised household income in quintiles.16 In order to maximise
sample size and avoid bias, missing values were included for all
covariates.
Statistical analysis
We used w2-tests to determine the statistical significance of any
difference in the distributions of the selected sociodemographic
variables across categories of WEMWBS scores (low, middle, high)
(online Table DS2). Data were analysed in logistic regression
models in order to identify differences in the pattern of
association of sociodemographic variables with high and low
mental well-being. Unadjusted (Model 1), partially adjusted (age
and gender) (Model 2) and fully adjusted (all variables) (Model
3) models were generated to calculate odds ratios of low mental
well-being compared with middle-range (see Table 1 for the fully
adjusted model and online Table DS3 for details of all three
models), and high mental well-being compared with middle-range
(see Table 2 for the fully adjusted model and online Table DS4 for
details of all three models), using SPSS 21 for Windows for
different levels of socioeconomic variables. The significance of
linear trends and gender differences in the associations of low
and high mental well-being were assessed for each of the
correlates, the latter using tests for interaction (see online Tables
DS5 and DS6, respectively).
Results
Significant differences were found for all characteristics of study
participants with and without complete data except for gender
(online Table DS1). Respondents were more likely to be young,
married/cohabiting, employed, White, with higher levels of
education, higher incomes and either no religion or Christian.
In descriptive analyses, significant associations were evident by
age, marital status, education, household income, religion,
employment and ethnicity across the three categories of mental
well-being (online Table DS2).
In the fully adjusted models for low mental well-being
compared with middle-range (Table 1), middle age (35–54 years)
was associated with an increased odds ratio (OR = 1.58, 95% CI
1.35–1.84), whereas marriage/cohabitee status was associated with
a reduced odds (OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.62–0.97). Education showed
the expected dose–response relationships (P-value for linear
trend 50.001) with significantly increased odds of low mental
well-being among those with GCE O levels (OR = 1.35, 95% CI
1.03–1.77) and those with no qualifications (OR = 2.00, 95% CI
1.50–2.68) compared with those with a degree. Low mental
well-being was linearly associated with equivalised
income
(P50.001) with increased odds for those in the second lowest
income bracket (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.05–1.87) compared with
the
highest.

(OR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.01–2.10) and those inactive for other
reasons (OR = 2.89, 95% CI 2.21–3.78), increased the odds of
low mental well-being. The African and African–Caribbean group
was protected from low mental well-being (OR = 0.36, 95% CI
0.19–0.66). There were no associations with religion or gender.

which was more strongly associated with low mental well-being
among women than men, and unemployment, which was not
associated with low mental well-being in women (online Table
DS5). For high mental well-being, results were consistent between
men and women with the exception of retired men and ‘other
economically inactive’ women who had increased odds. Increased
odds of high mental well-being among African/African–Caribbean,
Indian and Pakistani populations were attributable to increased
odds among men (online Table DS6).
Discussion
Main findings
These analyses have enabled the comparison of the social and
economic correlates of low and high mental well-being in a large,
representative sample of the adult English population and show
that they do not mirror one another. The results show that the
correlates of high mental well-being are different from those of
low mental well-being but that the latter closely mirror the
correlates of mental illness. Assumptions about socioeconomic
determinants made in planning public mental health programmes
focusing on the prevention of mental illness may therefore not be
applicable to programmes aiming to increase mental well-being.
Measuring mental well-being
The WEMWBS is used in clinical populations17 but is not
clinically validated as a measure of mental illness. We have referred
to low mental well-being throughout because of this and also in
recognition of the debate regarding the relationship between
mental well-being and mental illness. Studies based on diagnostic
categories of mental illness have shown only moderate correlation
(around 0.5) between mental illness and measures of mental well-
being18 consistent with the philosophical position of the ‘dual
continuum model’.19 Studies based on continuous, clinically
validated measures of mental illness however, show a much
stronger correlation. For example there is a high inverse
correlation between WEMWBS scores and scores on the Center
for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), a clinically
valid measure of depression, widely used in population-based
studies.20 The latter study examined cut points on the WEMWBS
that corresponded to cut points on the CES-D. A WEMWBS score
of 42, which defined the cut point for the low mental well-being
group in this study, is below (clinically worse) than a CES-D score
of 16 and just above (clinically better) than that consistent with a
CES-D score of 26,21 both cut points which have been used to
define clinical populations of varying levels of severity. The
bottom 15% of the WEMWBS distribution – the low mental
well-being population in the current study – thus comprised
people who were very likely to have scored in the clinical range
on self-report measures of common mental disorders and is
consistent with estimates of clinically relevant levels of mental
illness in the UK population.8,22 The odds of low mental well-
being associated with the socioeconomic factors described in this
study also correspond closely to those measured in studies using
clinically valid measures of mental illness,9 further supporting
the view that we have compared the odds for a population very
likely to have mental illness with the odds for a population with
high mental well-being or positive mental health.
Significance of our findings
and comparison with previous studies
Our findings suggest that socioeconomic factors relate to mental
well-being in a way that is not consistent with the way they relate
to mental illness. The differences are most striking with regard to

education and employment where, although we found the
correlation with low mental well-being that we expected from
studies of mental illness, there was no discernible correlation with
high mental well-being, at least for those who were pre-retirement
in the employment analyses. If education and employment are key
drivers of mental health in general, we would expect to see them
correlating as a mirror image with both ends of the mental health
spectrum. In a recent analysis of the correlates of well-being,
undertaken by the Office of National Statistics and based on their
four proxy measures of mental well-being,23 people with the
highest levels of educational attainment were found to have higher
ratings of anxiety than people with lower educational attainment.
People in higher managerial and professional occupations also
showed higher scores for anxiety than those in lower supervisory
and technical occupations. Another recent analysis24 of cross-
sectional studies looking at predictors of mental well-being as
measured by the WEMWBS and the short version (SWEMWBS25)
found
both
employment
and
education
to
be
significant
correlates, but the association with education was non-linear.
The latter study was based on linear regression analyses and the
findings will therefore have been weighted by the relationship
between low mental well-being and education and employment.
Our findings relating to income and high mental well-being
are also strikingly different from the linear trend expected from
analyses relating to mental illness. The highest quintile income
group had better odds of high mental well-being than the other
four income groups, but there was nothing to distinguish the
latter four groups from one another. It is important to note that
the starting point for the highest quintile income bracket was
£47 794, which does not denote great wealth. Other investigators26
using linear regression analyses have in general found an
association between income and happiness and life satisfaction,
both used as proxy measure of mental well-being in economic
analyses, that was more evident in the least wealthy groups. In
the recent Office of National Statistics analysis based on their four
proxy measures23 increased earnings were associated with higher
levels of life satisfaction, but not with a sense that life was
worthwhile, or with happiness. Another analysis of predictors of
well-being found that being unsatisfied with personal income
was predictive of low mental well-being but less so than being
unsatisfied with leisure time.24 Mental well-being is more than life
satisfaction or happiness. It may be that the latter affective and
more transitory components of well-being are influenced by
income, whereas the more stable developmental components of
mental well-being relating to functioning are not.
Perhaps the most surprising finding, given the well-recognised
association between ethnicity and detention under the Mental
Health Act27 and the more general association between mental
illness and ethnicity,23 is the substantially increased odds of high
mental well-being among minority ethnic groups, particularly
African and African–Caribbean, Indian and Pakistani, and the
reduced odds of low mental well-being among African and
African–Caribbean groups. The findings relating to African and
African–Caribbean populations and mental well-being were also
evident in another recent analysis where it was shown, as it was
in this study, to be primarily because of high levels in Black
men.24 These findings are not incompatible with the existing
literature.
It
is
possible
that
minority
ethnic
populations
experience both more severe mental illness of the sort that
warrants detention under the Mental Health Act and at the same
time more positive mental health than White populations. The
WEMWBS has been validated in English-speaking Chinese and
Pakistani groups14 and shown to be reliable and acceptable, but
has not yet been specifically validated in African/African–
Caribbean populations. This study included only English-speaking
populations and findings among those who do not speak English
could have been different. The possibility of reporting biases in
this self-report measure of mental well-being also needs to be
addressed. However, if our findings relating to minority ethnic
groups prove robust they are of great interest. Strong arguments
are often made on the grounds of social deprivation that health-
promoting
interventions
should
specifically
target
ethnic
minorities. When it comes to improving mental well-being, we
may end up needing to learn from these population groups, spread-
ing their knowledge and attitudes to the majority population.
Cross-sectional surveys from which these results derive can
point towards possible causal inference but cannot demonstrate
it. Our study population was also biased in that respondents
differed from the eligible population in that they were more likely
to be middle-aged, White, well-educated and relatively wealthy.
We would therefore anticipate slightly lower levels of mental
illness in the study population and thus arguably lower levels of,
and a weaker correlation with, low mental well-being. The fact
that correlations with low mental well-being were strong suggests
that these biases have not greatly influenced our findings.
Although
explanations
for
our
findings
must
remain
speculative, they are compatible with a model in which low mental
well-being relates closely to mental illness and both are linearly
associated with socioeconomic position through a bidirectional
causal
relationship
–
that
is
poor
social
and
economic
circumstances increase the risk of mental illness by increasing
personal stressors, but at the same time mental illness increases
the risk of poor social circumstances by interfering with social
relationships, educational attainment and productivity as it is
known to do.1 Positive mental health might not be associated so
closely with socioeconomic circumstances if causality operated
in only one direction, that is positive mental health improves socio-
economic circumstances by supporting educational attainment,
productivity and social relationships, but reverse causality does
not apply – better social and economic circumstances do not
improve positive mental health.
In conclusion, the correlates of positive mental health may be
significantly different from the correlates of mental illness.
Programmes addressing the social determinants of health are
valuable from the point of view of preventing illness, but
programmes to improve mental well-being may need to adopt
new paradigms that do not rely on prevailing beliefs relating to
social inequalities.

Afflicting spectacle of insanity
An afflicting spectacle of insanity, followed by a melancholy result, was witnessed a few days ago at the Lunatic Hospital at
Saumur. A lady and gentleman went to visit the establishment, accompanied by their child, a little girl of five or six years old.
As they passed one of the cells, the wretched inmate, an interesting young woman of about 25, who had irrecoverably lost
her reason, through the desertions of a seducer, and the death of their illegitimate offspring, suddenly made a spring at the little
girl, who had approached within her reach. In the height of her delirium, the poor creature fancied the stranger’s child her own
long-lost darling, and, devouring it with kisses, bore it in triumph to the further end of the cell. Entreaties and menaces having
proved equally ineffectual to induce her to restore the child to its terrified mother, the director of the establishment was sent for,
and, at his suggestion, the maniac was allowed for a few moments to retain peaceable possession of her prize, under the
impression that, exhausted with her own frantic violence, she would shortly fall asleep, when the child might be liberated from
her grasp without difficulty or the employment of harsh measures. This calculation was not erroneous: in a few minutes, the poor
sufferer’s eyes closed in slumber, and one of the keepers watching the opportunity, snatched the child from her arms, and
restored it to its mother. The shriek of delight uttered by the latter on recovering her treasure awakened the poor maniac,
who, on perceiving the child gone, actually howled with despair, and, in a paroxysm of ungovernable frenzy, fell to the ground
– to rise no more. Death had released her from her sufferings.
