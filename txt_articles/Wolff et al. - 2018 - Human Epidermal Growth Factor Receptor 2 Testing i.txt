� Purpose.—To update key recommendations of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College
of American Pathologists (CAP) human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing in breast cancer
guideline.
Methods.—Based on the signals approach, an Expert
Panel reviewed published literature and research survey
results on the observed frequency of less common in situ
hybridization (ISH) patterns to update the recommendations.
Recommendations.—Two recommendations addressed
via correspondence in 2015 are included. First, immuno-
histochemistry (IHC) 2þ is defined as invasive breast
cancer with weak to moderate complete membrane
staining observed in .10% of tumor cells. Second, if the
initial HER2 test result in a core needle biopsy specimen of
a primary breast cancer is negative, a new HER2 test may
(not ‘‘must’’) be ordered on the excision specimen based on
specific clinical criteria. The HER2 testing algorithm for
breast cancer is updated to address the recommended
workup for less common clinical scenarios (approximately
5% of cases) observed when using a dual-probe ISH assay.
These scenarios are described as ISH group 2 (HER2/
chromosome enumeration probe 17 [CEP17] ratio �2.0;
average HER2 copy number ,4.0 signals per cell), ISH
group 3 (HER2/CEP17 ratio ,2.0; average HER2 copy
number �6.0 signals per cell), and ISH group 4 (HER2/
CEP17 ratio ,2.0; average HER2 copy number �4.0 and
,6.0 signals per cell). The diagnostic approach includes
more rigorous interpretation criteria for ISH and requires
concomitant IHC review for dual-probe ISH groups 2 to 4
to arrive at the most accurate HER2 status designation
(positive or negative) based on combined interpretation of
the ISH and IHC assays. The Expert Panel recommends that
laboratories using single-probe ISH assays include con-
comitant IHC review as part of the interpretation of all
single-probe ISH assay results.

 THE BOTTOM LINE
Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Testing in Breast Cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American
Pathologists Clinical Practice Guideline Focused Update
Guideline Questions
What is the most appropriate definition for immunohistochemistry (IHC) 2þ (IHC equivocal)? Must human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2) testing be repeated on a surgical specimen if there was an initially negative test result on core biopsy? What is the
optimal algorithm for less common patterns observed when performing dual-probe in situ hybridization (ISH) testing in breast cancer?
Target Population
Patients with breast cancer.
Target Audience
Medical oncologists, pathologists, surgeons, and radiation oncologists.
Methods
An Expert Panel was convened to develop updated clinical practice guideline recommendations based on a systematic review of the
medical literature.
Focused Update Recommendations
1. In the revised Figure 1, the revised definition of IHC 2þ (equivocal) is invasive breast cancer with ‘‘weak to moderate complete mem-
brane staining observed in . 10% of tumor cells.’’
2. In the revised Table 2, it is now stated that, on the basis of some criteria (including a tumor grade 3), ‘‘If the initial HER2 test result in a
core needle biopsy specimen of a primary breast cancer is negative, a new HER2 test may be ordered on the excision specimen . . .’’
3. If a case has an HER2/chromosome enumeration probe 17 (CEP17) ratio of � 2.0 but the average HER2 signals per cell is ,4.0, a defin-
itive diagnosis will be rendered based on additional workup. If not already assessed by the institution or laboratory performing the ISH
test, IHC testing for HER2 should be performed using sections from the same tissue sample used for ISH, and the slides from both ISH
and IHC should be reviewed together to guide the selection of areas to score by ISH (local practice considerations will dictate the best
procedure to accomplish this concomitant review):
a. If the IHC result is 3þ, diagnosis is HER2 positive.
b. If the IHC result is 2þ, recount ISH by having an additional observer, blinded to previous ISH results, count at least 20 cells that
include the area of invasive cancer with IHC 2þ staining:
� If reviewing the count by the additional observer changes the result into another ISH category, the result should be adjudicated
per internal procedures to define the final category.
� If the count remains an average of ,4.0 HER2 signals per cell and the HER2/CEP17 ratio is �2.0, diagnosis is HER2 negative
with a comment. (Please note: Refer to text for specific comments about recommendations listed as 3b, 3c, 4c, and 5b).
c. If the IHC result is 0 or 1þ, diagnosis is HER2 negative with a comment. (Please note: Refer to text for specific comments about
recommendations listed as 3b, 3c, 4c, and 5b).
4. If a case has an average of �6.0 HER2 signals per cell with an HER2/CEP17 ratio of ,2.0, formerly diagnosed as ISH positive for
HER2, a definitive diagnosis will be rendered based on additional workup. If not already assessed by the institution or laboratory per-
forming the ISH test, IHC testing for HER2 should be performed using sections from the same tissue sample used for ISH, and the slides
from both ISH and IHC should be reviewed together to guide the selection of areas to score by ISH (local practice considerations will
dictate the best procedure to accomplish this concomitant review):
a. If the IHC result is 3þ, diagnosis is HER2 positive.
b. If the IHC result is 2þ, recount ISH by having an additional observer, blinded to previous ISH results, count at least 20 cells that
include the area of invasion with IHC 2þ staining:
� If reviewing the count by the additional observer changes the result into another ISH category, the result should be adjudicated
per internal procedures to define the final category.
� If the HER2/CEP17 ratio remains ,2.0 with �6.0 HER2 signals per cell, diagnosis is HER2 positive.
c. If the IHC result is 0 or 1þ, diagnosis is HER2 negative with a comment. (Please note: Refer to text for specific comments about
recommendations listed as 3b, 3c, 4c, 5b, and 5c).
5. If the case has an average HER2 signals per tumor cell of �4.0 and ,6.0 and the HER2/CEP17 ratio is ,2.0, formerly diagnosed as ISH
equivocal for HER2, a definitive diagnosis will be rendered based on additional workup. If not already assessed by the institution or lab-
oratory performing the ISH test, IHC testing for HER2 should be performed using sections from the same tissue sample used for ISH,
and the slides from both ISH and IHC should be reviewed together to guide the selection of areas to score by ISH (local practice con-
siderations will dictate the best procedure to accomplish this concomitant review):
a. If the IHC result is 3þ, diagnosis is HER2 positive.
b. If the IHC result is 2þ, recount ISH by having an additional observer, blinded to previous ISH results, count at least 20 cells that
include the area of invasion with IHC 2þ staining:
� If reviewing the count by the additional observer changes the result into another ISH category, the result should be adjudicated
per internal procedures to define the final category.
� If the count remains an average of �4.0 and ,6.0 HER2 signals per cell with an HER2/CEP17 ratio of ,2.0, diagnosis is HER2
negative with a comment. (Please note: Refer to text for specific comments about recommendations listed as 3b, 3c, 4c, 5b, and
5c).
c. If the IHC result is 0 or 1þ, diagnosis is HER2 negative with a comment. (Please note: Refer to text for specific comments about
recommendations listed as 3b, 3c, 4c, 5b, and 5c).
Note: In Figure 2, a new footnote states that the Expert Panel recommends that concomitant IHC review become part of the interpretation of single-
probe ISH results and that the Expert Panel preferentially recommends the use of dual-probe instead of single-probe ISH assays.

ISH rejection
criteria
Test is rejected and repeated if:
Controls are not as expected
Observer cannot find and count at least two areas of invasive
tumor
.25% of signals are unscorable due to weak signals
.10% of signals occur over cytoplasm
Nuclear resolution is poor
Autofluorescence is strong
Report HER2 test result as Indeterminate as per parameters
described
No change
ISH
interpretation
The pathologist should scan the entire ISH slide before counting at
least 20 cells or use IHC to define the areas of potential HER2
amplification.
If there is a second population of cells with increased HER2
signals/cell and this cell population consists of .10% of tumor
cells on the slide (defined by image analysis or visual
estimation of the ISH or IHC slide), a separate counting of at
least 20 nonoverlapping cells must also be performed within
this cell population and reported.
For brightfield ISH, counting requires comparison between
patterns in normal breast and tumor cells because artifactual
patterns may be seen that are difficult to interpret. If tumor cell
pattern is neither normal nor clearly amplified, test should be
submitted for expert opinion.
The pathologist should scan the entire ISH slide before counting at least 20 cells or use IHC to
define the areas of potential HER2 amplification.
If there is a second population of contiguous cells with increased HER2 signals/cell and this cell
population consists of .10% of tumor cells on the slide (defined by image analysis or visual
estimation of the ISH or IHC slide), a separate counting of at least 20 nonoverlapping cells
must also be performed within this cell population and reported.

 testing and the clinical utility of HER2 as a predictive
biomarker for potential responsiveness to therapies targeting
the HER2 protein.1–4 Activating mutations of the tyrosine
kinase and extracellular domains of HER2 in the absence of
amplification or overexpression offer an alternative and much
less common mechanism for HER2-targeted therapy that is
being explored in clinical trials of small molecule kinase
inhibitors.5 Data from NRG trial B-47 (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT01275677) confirmed the lack of benefit from
adjuvant trastuzumab for patients whose tumors lack gene
amplification and are immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1þ or 2þ.6
Consequently, HER2 gene amplification assessed by in situ
hybridization (ISH) or protein overexpression assessed by IHC
remains the primary predictor of responsiveness to HER2-
targeted therapies in breast cancer.
Greater communication among health care providers
(especially pathologists and oncologists) and appropriate
infrastructure support for specimen handling and laboratory
facilities led to observed improvements in the analytic
performance and accuracy of HER2 testing.7 Greater clinical
experience with the efficacy and safety of HER2-targeted
therapies, and a meaningful reduction in the high frequency
of false-positive HER2 test results previously observed,8 led
the 2013 Expert Panel to provide additional guidance
regarding less common clinical scenarios to allow greater
discrimination between positive and negative results.1,4
Since 2013, several laboratory and clinical investigators
have reported on the practical implications of the 2013
Guideline Update and the observed frequency of equivocal
cases.9–13 These reports have allowed the Expert Panel (see
Appendix) to evaluate the observed frequency of less
common HER2 testing patterns, their apparent prognostic
and predictive value when retrospectively analyzed within
clinical trial data sets, and the critical need to understand the
underlying distribution of HER2 IHC test results in cases
that are submitted for additional testing (eg, by ISH) by a
reference laboratory. The Expert Panel wished to clarify one
of its 2013 recommendations that led some laboratories to
adopt the use of multiple alternative chromosome 17 probe
testing as the sole strategy to resolve equivocal HER2 test
results by ISH, despite limited evidence on analytic and
clinical validity. The full set of recommendations from 2013
and 2018, highlighting changes, is available in Table 1.
The HER2 testing Guideline Expert Panel has identified
five clinical questions that form the core of this 2018
Focused Update. Two of them (Clinical Questions 1 and 2)
were addressed in a previous correspondence by the panel
that was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO)
in 2015,14 and they are included here in the forms of Figure 1
(algorithm for IHC testing) and Table 2 (histopathologic
features suggestive of possible test discordance), both
revised from the 2013 guideline. Figure 2 is an algorithm
for single-probe ISH testing and includes a new footnote
with a recommendation that concomitant IHC review
become part of the interpretation of single-probe ISH
results. Clinical Questions 3, 4, and 5 address less common
patterns observed when performing dual-probe ISH test-
ing10,12 and are graphically summarized in Figures 3 to 6
(algorithm for dual-probe ISH testing), also revised.
A new Table 3 describes the patterns of HER2 ISH testing
using a dual-probe assay and lists the clear effect of the
underlying distribution of HER2 IHC test results on the
frequency of less common patterns of ISH (hereafter called
groups 2, 3, and 4).10,12 In the population at large,
approximately 95% of tumors tested for HER2 by dual-

 probe ISH will consist of group 1 (HER2 positive) and group
5 (HER2 negative). It is expected that approximately 5% of
cases tested by ISH will fall into groups 2, 3, or 4, and
available clinical outcome data from related clinical trials,
albeit of limited statistical power, have allowed the Expert
Panel to more carefully define the expected prognostic and
predictive behavior of these cases.
Most importantly, after careful consideration of the
available evidence and expert opinions, the Expert Panel
revised the diagnostic approach to groups 2 to 4 to include
more rigorous interpretation criteria for dual-probe ISH
testing and to require concomitant IHC review, to arrive at
the most accurate HER2 status designation (positive or
negative) based on the combined interpretation of the ISH
and IHC assays. The Expert Panel recommends that such
concomitant review be performed in the same institution to
ensure parallel interpretation and quality of the two assays.
Although the main focus was to clarify the less common test
results
observed
with
the
two-probe
ISH
assays,
the
recommendations affect the users of single-probe ISH assays.
Therefore, the Expert Panel now recommends that concom-
itant IHC review become part of the interpretation of single-
probe ISH results to allow the most accurate HER2 designation
(Figure 2). The Expert Panel also preferentially recommends
the use of dual-probe instead of single-probe ISH assays,
although it recognizes that several single-probe ISH assays
have regulatory approval in many parts of the world.
GUIDELINE QUESTIONS
This 2018 Focused Update addresses five clinical questions
raised after the publication of the 2013 Guideline Update:
Clinical Question 1
What is the most appropriate definition for IHC 2þ (IHC
equivocal)?
Clinical Question 2
Must HER2 testing be repeated on a surgical specimen if
initially negative test on core biopsy?
Clinical Question 3
Should invasive cancers with an HER2/chromosome
enumeration probe 17 (CEP17) ratio of �2.0 but an average
HER2 copy number of ,4.0 signals per cell be considered
ISH positive?
Clinical Question 4
Should invasive cancers with an average HER2 copy
number of �6.0 signals per cell but a HER2/CEP17 ratio of
,2.0 be considered ISH positive?
Clinical Question 5
What is the appropriate diagnostic workup for invasive
cancers with an average HER2 copy number of �4.0 but
,6.0 signals per cell and an HER2/CEP17 ratio of ,2.0, and
initially deemed to have an equivocal HER2 ISH test result?

Algorithm for evaluation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay
of the invasive component of a breast cancer specimen. Note: The final reported results assume that there is no apparent histopathologic discordance
observed by the pathologist. Unusual staining patterns of HER2 by IHC can be encountered that are not covered by these definitions. In practice,
these patterns are rare and if encountered should be considered IHC 2þ equivocal. As one example, some specific subtypes of breast cancers can
show IHC staining that is moderate to intense but incomplete (basolateral or lateral) and can be found to be HER2 amplified. Another example is
circumferential membrane IHC staining that is intense but in �10% of tumor cells (heterogeneous, but limited in extent). Such cases can be
considered 2þ equivocal, but additional samples may reveal different percentages of HER2-positive staining. ISH, in situ hybridization. *Readily

ASCO/CAP HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer Update—Wolff et al
 Clinical Questions 1 and 2 were formally addressed in
correspondence from the ASCO/CAP HER2 testing Guide-
line Expert Panel published in JCO14 in 2015 in response to
correspondence by Rakha et al,17 and this Focused Update
contains a revised Figure 1 (Clinical Question 1) and a
revised Table 2 (Clinical Question 2).
Clinical Questions 3, 4, and 5 regarding dual-probe (dual-
signal) ISH testing (Figures 3 to 6) were addressed by the
Expert Panel in a meeting at ASCO headquarters on
November 28 and 29, 2016, and in subsequent conference
calls and electronic communications. Figure 2 (single-probe
ISH) from the 2013 Guideline Update includes a new footnote
with a recommendation that concomitant IHC review become
part of the interpretation of single-probe ISH results. Table 1
contains a summary of the recommendations of the 2013
Guideline Update and the 2018 Focused Update. Figure 7,
describing the number of laboratories participating in predic-
tive marker proficiency testing for HER2, has been updated.
METHODS
Guideline Update Process
This systematic review-based guideline product was developed
by a multidisciplinary Expert Panel, which included a patient
representative and ASCO guidelines staff with health research
methodology expertise. PubMed and the Cochrane Library were
searched for randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews,
meta-analyses, and clinical practice guidelines for the period from
January 1, 2013, through May 11, 2017. The disease and
intervention search terms were those that were used for the
2013 Guideline Update. The updated search was guided by the
signals18 approach that is designed to identify only new,
potentially practice-changing data (signals) that might translate
into revised practice recommendations. The approach relies on
targeted routine literature searching and the expertise of ASCO
Expert Panel members to help identify potential signals.
Additional information about the literature search strategy string
and results, as well as a discussion of the ASCO signals approach
to guideline updating, are available in the 2018 Data Supplement
and 2018 Methodology Supplement, respectively (see supple-
mental digital content at www.archivesofpathology.org in the
November 2018 table of contents). A QUOROM diagram of the
updated search and the clinical questions are provided (Data
Supplement). In addition to the literature search, a research
survey was distributed to gather additional real-world data from
laboratories from before and after implementation of the ASCO/
CAP HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer 2013 Update. Additional
information regarding this survey process is available in the Data
Supplement.
The Expert Panel met during a 2-day in-person meeting in
November 2016 to consider the evidence for each of the
recommendations contained in this 2018 Focused Update. Labora-
tories that shared with the Expert Panel their clinical experience with
HER2 testing since the publication of the 2013 Guideline Update
participated in the open session of the meeting. The guideline was
circulated in draft form to the Expert Panel. Draft recommendations
were released to the public for an open comment period between
May 22 and June 19, 2017. ASCO’s Clinical Practice Guidelines
Committee reviewed and approved the final document. For CAP, an
independent review panel was assembled to review and approve the
guideline. The independent review panel was masked to the Expert
Panel and was vetted through the conflict of interest process.
Only recommendations relating to the updated clinical questions
have changed. The Data Supplement provides clinical questions
corresponding to all recommendations from the 2013 Guideline
Update.
This ASCO/CAP Clinical Practice Guideline Focused Update
provides select recommendations with a comprehensive discussion
of the relevant literature from January 1, 2013, to May 11, 2017, for
these specific recommendations. The full guideline, which this
revision applies to, and additional information are available at
www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guidelines. The complete list of rec-
ommendations, including the updated recommendations, is in
Table 1. All funding for the administration of the project was
provided by ASCO and CAP.

Histopathologic Features Suggestive of
Possible Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2
(HER2) Test Discordance*
Criteria to Consider†
A new HER2 test should not be ordered if the following
histopathologic findings occur and the initial HER2 test was
negative:
Histologic grade 1 carcinoma of the following types:
Infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinoma, ER and PgR positive
Tubular (at least 90% pure)
Mucinous (at least 90% pure)
Cribriform (at least 90% pure)
Adenoid cystic carcinoma (90% pure) and often triple
negative
Similarly, a new HER2 test should be ordered if the following
histopathologic findings occur and the initial HER2 test was
positive:
Histologic grade 1 carcinoma of the following types:
Infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinoma, ER and PgR positive
Tubular (at least 90% pure)
Mucinous (at least 90% pure)
Cribriform (at least 90% pure)
Adenoid cystic carcinoma (90% pure) and often triple
negative
If the initial HER2 test result in a core needle biopsy specimen
of a primary breast cancer is negative, a new HER2 test
may be ordered on the excision specimen if one of the
following is observed:
Tumor is grade 3
Amount of invasive tumor in the core biopsy specimen is
small
Resection specimen contains high-grade carcinoma that is
morphologically distinct from that in the core
Core biopsy result is equivocal for HER2 after testing by both
ISH and IHC
There is doubt about the handling of the core biopsy
specimen (long ischemic time, short time in fixative,
different fixative), or the test is suspected by the pathologist
to be negative on the basis of testing error

already performed) and/or dual-probe ISH. If IHC results are 2þ equivocal, it is recommended to also perform dual-probe ISH. ‡If initial assessment
of dual-probe ISH is suggestive of groups 2, 3, or 4, follow the algorithm described in Figure 3.

Clinical Question 3, group 2.
*Evidence is limited on the efficacy of human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–
targeted therapy in the small subset of cases
with an HER2/chromosome enumeration
probe 17 (CEP17) ratio �2.0 and an average
HER2 copy number of ,4.0 per cell. In the
first generation of adjuvant trastuzumab trials,
patients in this subgroup who were randomly
assigned to the trastuzumab arm did not seem
to derive an improvement in disease-free or
overall survival, but there were too few such
cases to draw definitive conclusions. Immu-
nohistochemistry (IHC) expression for HER2
should be used to complement in situ
hybridization (ISH) and define HER2 status.
If the IHC result is not 3þ positive, it is
recommended that the specimen be consid-
ered HER2 negative because of the low HER2
copy number by ISH and the lack of protein
overexpression.

Clinical Question 4, group 3.
*There are insufficient data on the efficacy
of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2)–targeted therapy in cases with a
HER2 ratio of ,2.0 in the absence of protein
overexpression because such patients were
not eligible for the first generation of adjuvant
trastuzumab clinical trials. When concurrent
immunohistochemistry (IHC) results are neg-
ative (0 or 1þ), it is recommended that the
specimen be considered HER2 negative.

Clinical Question 5, group 4. *It is
uncertain whether patients with an average of
�4.0 and ,6.0 human epidermal growth

HER2/chromosome enumeration probe 17
(CEP17) ratio of ,2.0 benefit from HER2-
targeted therapy in the absence of protein
overexpression (immunohistochemistry [IHC]
3þ). If the specimen test result is close to the
in situ hybridization (ISH) ratio threshold for
positive, there is a higher likelihood that
repeat testing will result in different results
by chance alone. Therefore, when IHC results
are not 3þ positive, it is recommended that
the sample be considered HER2 negative
without additional testing on the same spec-
imen.

RECOMMENDATIONS
All recommendations regarding each of the five clinical
questions are predicated on the assumption that the cases
have been properly fixed, processed, and tested in a
laboratory that follows ASCO/CAP HER2 testing guideline
recommendations, especially those related to IHC and ISH
interpretation and reporting.
In the 2013 Guideline Update, the workup of cases in the
less common dual-probe ISH categories (groups 2 to 4)
addressed in Clinical Questions 3, 4, and 5 (Figure 3)
included only ISH. In this 2018 Focused Update, we
recommend that these cases be worked up by considering
both the IHC and the dual-probe ISH results together. Many
publications since the 2013 Guideline Update have refer-
enced the value of adjudicating ISH results in these
uncommon categories using IHC.12,16,19–21 These tests should
be performed on the same tissue sample using sections from
the same block. Ideally, adjacent tissue levels from the same
block should be tested and then reviewed together. If IHC
has already been performed, it should be used to guide the
selection of the areas to be counted during ISH such that
areas with the strongest protein expression can be included in
ISH scoring. This is common practice among laboratories
performing both testing procedures. If the ISH laboratory
only performs ISH, it is recommended that an adjacent
section in the same block be assessed at a companion IHC
laboratory, and then the slides from both ISH and IHC be
reviewed together to guide the selection of areas to score by
ISH. Local practice considerations will dictate the best
procedure to accomplish this concomitant review.
Clinical Question 1
What is the most appropriate definition for IHC 2þ (IHC
equivocal)?
2013 Recommendation.—IHC 2þ (equivocal) was de-
fined in Figure 1 of the 2013 HER2 Testing Update as
invasive breast cancer showing ‘‘circumferential membrane
staining that is incomplete and/or weak/moderate and
within . 10% of tumor cells or complete and circumferen-
tial membrane staining that is intense and within � 10% of
tumor cells.’’
Revised 2018 Recommendation.—In the revised Figure 1,
the revised definition of IHC 2þ (equivocal) is invasive breast
cancer with ‘‘weak to moderate complete membrane staining
observed in . 10% of tumor cells’’ (type: evidence based;
evidence quality: high; strength of recommendation: strong).
Literature Review and Analysis.—IHC 2þ (equivocal)
had been defined in the 2013 Guideline Update (2013 figure 1:
Algorithm for evaluation of HER2 protein expression by IHC
assay of the invasive component of a breast cancer specimen)
as invasive breast cancer showing ‘‘circumferential membrane
staining that is incomplete and/or weak/moderate and within
. 10% of tumor cells or complete and circumferential
membrane staining that is intense and within � 10% of
tumor cells.’’ However, many pathologists expressed concern
that the terms ‘‘circumferential’’ and ‘‘incomplete’’ were
confusing, could not be reconciled when used together in
the IHC interpretation of HER2 expression, and could lead to
many IHC 1þ (HER2-negative) tumors being called IHC 2þ
(HER2 equivocal) and submitted for reflex testing.
In the same figure 1 of the 2013 Guideline Update, the
statement ‘‘complete and circumferential membrane stain-
ing that is intense and within �10% of tumor cells’’ referred
to an unusual pattern that did not need to be specified in the
main portion of the figure. This information has now been
moved to the footnote of Figure 1, which will now read as
follows:
Unusual staining patterns of HER2 by IHC can be
encountered that are not covered by these definitions.
In practice, these patterns are rare and if encountered
should be considered IHC 2þ equivocal. As one
example, some specific subtypes of breast cancers can
show IHC staining that is moderate to intense but
incomplete (basolateral or lateral) and can be found to
be HER2 amplified.22 Another example is circumferen-
tial membrane IHC staining that is intense but within �
10% of tumor cells (heterogeneous but very limited in
extent).
Consequently, the revised definition of IHC 2þ (HER2
equivocal) in this 2018 Focused Update (Figure 1) reflects a
commonly accepted definition of invasive breast cancer that
now reads ‘‘weak to moderate complete membrane staining
observed in . 10% of tumor cells.’’23 During the open
comment period, pathologists requested guidance about the
uncommon scenario of cases in which ‘‘intense circumfer-
ential membrane staining is observed in � 10% of tumor
cells.’’ As described in the footnote in Figure 1, such cases

 may be considered IHC 2þ equivocal, although additional
samples may reveal different percentages of HER2-positive
staining. These revisions were previously communicated in
a 2015 correspondence from the ASCO/CAP HER2 testing
Expert Panel published in JCO.14
Clinical Question 2
Must HER2 testing be repeated on a surgical specimen if
initially negative test on core biopsy?
2013 Recommendation.—In Table 2 in the 2013 HER2
Testing Update, it was stated that, on the basis of some
criteria (including a tumor grade 3), ‘‘If the initial HER2 test
result in a core needle biopsy specimen of a primary breast
cancer is negative, a new HER2 test must be ordered on the
excision specimen . . ..’’
Revised 2018 Recommendation.—In the revised Table
2, it is now stated that, on the basis of some criteria
(including a tumor grade 3), ‘‘If the initial HER2 test result in
a core needle biopsy specimen of a primary breast cancer is
negative, a new HER2 test may be ordered on the excision
specimen . . .’’ (type: evidence based; evidence quality: high;
strength of recommendation: strong).
Literature Review and Analysis.—The auxiliary verb
‘‘must’’ was used in the 2013 Guideline Update (Table 2)1 to
indicate that, on the basis of some criteria (including a tumor
grade 3), ‘‘If the initial HER2 test result in a core needle
biopsy specimen of a primary breast cancer is negative, a new
HER2 test must be ordered on the excision specimen . . ..’’
The panel had previously indicated in the Data Supple-
ment of the 2013 Guideline Update that:
‘‘smaller datasets from several investigators seemed to
suggest that it might be possible to identify subsets
where the level of suspicion of false negativity is
markedly raised. However, many of these criteria are
consistent with true triple-negative disease, and the
(2013) Update Committee was unsure whether re-
testing was indicated for all such cancers (and) . . . was
unable to identify a specific subgroup that would benefit
from mandatory reflex testing if IHC is less than 2þ.’’
Several data sets originally referenced in 2013 showed
excellent concordance for HER2 testing in paired samples
(core biopsy specimen and excision) using IHC as the initial
test, such as a 98.8% concordance observed among 336
patients in the Royal Marsden experience.24
Rakha et al,17 in their 2015 correspondence to JCO,
described their own institutional experience and that of other
groups, including many previously described in the 2013
Guideline Update. In its 2015 response14 to the correspon-
dence by Rakha et al,17 the panel agreed that, in view of the
greater clinical experience that confirmed the high concor-
dance in HER2 testing between core and excisional biopsies,
it was appropriate to allow the pathologist and oncologist to
exercise clinical judgment and that grade 3 alone did not
suffice as a criterion for mandatory retesting.
Therefore, in the revised Table 2, the auxiliary verb ‘‘must’’
has been replaced by ‘‘may’’ to indicate that, ‘‘If the initial
HER2 test result in a core needle biopsy specimen of a
primary breast cancer is negative, a new HER2 test may be
ordered on the excision specimen . . ..’’ These changes are
the same as those previously communicated in a 2015
correspondence by the authors of the 2013 Guideline
Update and published in JCO.14
Clinical Question 3
Should invasive cancers with an HER2/CEP17 ratio of
�2.0 but an average HER2 copy number of ,4.0 signals per
cell be considered ISH positive?
2013 Recommendation.—Cases in which the HER2/
CEP17 ratio is �2.0 with an average HER2 signals per cell
of ,4.0 were considered ISH positive.
Revised 2018 Recommendation.—If a case has an
HER2/CEP17 ratio of �2.0 but the average HER2 signals
per cell is ,4.0, a definitive diagnosis will be rendered based
on additional workup.
If not already assessed by the institution or laboratory
performing the ISH test, IHC testing for HER2 should be
performed using sections from the same tissue sample used
for ISH, and the slides from both ISH and IHC should be
reviewed together to guide the selection of areas to score by
ISH (local practice considerations will dictate the best
procedure to accomplish this concomitant review):
� If the IHC result is 3þ, diagnosis is HER2 positive.
� If the IHC result is 2þ, recount ISH by having an
additional observer, blinded to previous ISH results,
count at least 20 cells that include the area of invasive
cancer with IHC 2þ staining:
o If reviewing the count by the additional observer
changes the result into another ISH category, the result
should be adjudicated per internal procedures to define
the final category.
o If the count remains an average of ,4.0 HER2 signals
per cell and the HER2/CEP17 ratio is �2.0, diagnosis is
HER2 negative with a comment.
� If the IHC result is 0 or 1þ, diagnosis is HER2 negative
with a comment.
The Expert Panel recommends the following comment:
evidence is limited on the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapy
in the small subset of cases with an HER2/CEP17 ratio of
�2.0 and an average HER2 copy number of ,4.0 per cell. In
the first generation of adjuvant trastuzumab trials, patients
in this subgroup who were randomly assigned to the
trastuzumab arm did not seem to derive an improvement in
disease-free or overall survival, but there were too few such
cases to draw definitive conclusions. IHC expression for
HER2 should be used to complement ISH and define HER2
status. If the IHC result is not 3þpositive, it is recommended
that the specimen be considered HER2 negative because of
the low HER2 copy number by ISH and the lack of protein
overexpression (Type: evidence based; evidence quality:
intermediate; strength of recommendation: strong). An
algorithm for Clinical Question 3 is presented in Figures 3
and 4.
Literature Review and Analysis.—Members of the
HER2 testing Expert Panel in 2013 had expressed concern
about describing an invasive breast cancer as HER2 positive
on the basis of a single HER2 ISH test that showed an
HER2/CEP17 ratio of �2.0 but an average HER2 copy
number of ,4.0 signals per cell (Figure 3, group 2) and
recommended additional testing of such cases. Members of
the 2013 Guideline Update Panel also expressed their view
that using the HER2/CEP17 ratio alone could be misleading
in cases with CEP17 gains or losses and could lead to an
underestimation or overestimation of HER2 amplification.
However, the eligibility criteria for the first adjuvant trials of
trastuzumab generally followed US Food and Drug Admin-
istration criteria (IHC 3þ or ISH ratio �2.0 regardless of
1376
Arch Pathol Lab Med—Vol 142, November 2018
ASCO/CAP HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer Update—Wolff et al
 average HER2 copy number based on HER2 signals per cell),
and the panel in 2013 ultimately opted to consider these rare
group 2 patients as having HER2-positive disease.
Since then, investigators have further reported on the
outcome of patients with a group 2 dual-probe ISH test
result. Greater experience and a more refined collection of
test results in the past few years confirmed that such cases
are infrequent (Table 3) and represented a small number of
patients enrolled in the initial adjuvant trastuzumab trials.
Among 4340 patients (41.5% of 10 468) screened by dual-
probe fluorescent ISH (FISH) for trials Breast Cancer
International Research Group (BCIRG) 005 (HER2-negative
trial) and BCIRG-006 (HER2-positive trial) and found to
have a dual-probe ISH ratio of �2.0, only 71 (0.7% of
10 468) had an average number of HER2 signals per cell of
,4.0.10 Furthermore, in 35 of these 71 patients who were
also tested later by IHC, only 3 were IHC 2þ and none were
IHC 3þ. A retrospective assessment of potential benefit from
trastuzumab in group 2 patients produced an observed
hazard ratio estimate of slightly .1.0 (favoring no trastu-
zumab benefit), but the sample size was insufficient to
statistically rule out a benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab in
this group; nor could it be established statistically whether
group 2 patients not treated with trastuzumab had
outcomes different from patients with HER2-negative
disease treated with just chemotherapy.10 In the HERA trial,
group 2 patients were also uncommon (0.8%) among all
patients centrally screened for eligibility (Table 3), whereas
group 1 patients (ISH ratio �2.0 and average HER2 signals
per cell of �4.0) represented 55% of all tested cases (48.7%
�6.0 and 6.3% �4.0 and ,6.0).15 In summary, the panel
concluded that these group 2 cases should no longer be
considered HER2 positive unless IHC 3þ overexpressed.
Repeat testing of other tissue samples from the patient
may also be appropriate in this setting, and in particularly
challenging cases or if the results are in question, expert
consultation may be appropriate.
Clinical Question 4
Should invasive cancers with an average HER2 copy
number of �6.0 signals per cell but an HER2/CEP17 ratio of
,2.0 be considered ISH positive?
2013 Recommendation.—Cases in which the HER2/
CEP17 ratio is ,2.0 with an average of �6.0 HER2 signals
per cell were considered ISH positive.
Revised 2018 Recommendation.—If a case has an
average of �6.0 HER2 signals per cell with an HER2/
CEP17 ratio of ,2.0, formerly diagnosed as ISH positive for
HER2, a definitive diagnosis will be rendered based on
additional workup.
If not already assessed by the institution or laboratory
performing the ISH test, IHC testing for HER2 should be
performed using sections from the same tissue sample used
for ISH, and the slides from both ISH and IHC should be
reviewed together to guide the selection of areas to score by
ISH (local practice considerations will dictate the best
procedure to accomplish this concomitant review):
� If the IHC result is 3þ, diagnosis is HER2 positive.
� If the IHC result is 2þ, recount ISH by having an
additional observer, blinded to previous ISH results,
count at least 20 cells that include the area of invasion
with IHC 2þ staining:
o If reviewing the count by the additional observer
changes the result into another ISH category, the result
should be adjudicated per internal procedures to define
the final category.
o If the HER2/CEP17 ratio remains ,2.0 with �6.0 HER2
signals per cell, diagnosis is HER2 positive.
� If the IHC result is 0 or 1þ, diagnosis is HER2 negative
with a comment.
The Expert Panel recommends the following comment:
there are insufficient data on the efficacy of HER2-targeted
therapy in cases with an HER2 ratio of ,2.0 in the absence
of protein overexpression because such patients were not
eligible for the first generation of adjuvant trastuzumab
clinical trials. When concurrent IHC results are negative (0
or 1þ), it is recommended that the specimen be considered
HER2 negative (type: evidence based; evidence quality:
intermediate; strength of recommendation: strong). An
algorithm for Clinical Question 4 is presented in Figures 3
and 5.
Literature Review and Analysis.—Based on available
data, samples with ISH results in this category (ratio ,2.0
and mean HER2 signals per cell �6.0) are uncommon, only
representing between 0.4% and 3.0% of cases sent for dual-
probe FISH testing (Table 3). These ISH cases have increases
in both HER2 and control centromere signals, resulting in
ratio results of ,2.0. At the time of the pivotal HER2 trials,
cases with these results were considered to have duplication
of CEP17 (polysomy) and were most often excluded because
they were considered negative for HER2 gene amplification,
although the BCIRG-006 (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier:
NCT00021255) allowed patients to be enrolled if the HER2
copy number was �10 and central IHC testing was 3þ.
Subsequent studies examining multiple regions of chromo-
some 17 supported that the majority of cases with these
results have HER2 amplifications that include regions
encompassing the centromere rather than true polysomy
for the entire chromosome 17 (coamplification of control
and HER2 signals).25–31 Based on these data, the 2013
Guideline Update clarified that cases with an average HER2
copy number of �6.0 HER2 signals per cell ISH results (by
either single- or dual-probe assays) should be reported as
HER2 positive by gene amplification. However, it was
acknowledged that data on the clinical response of this
group to HER2-targeted therapies were limited.
Since the 2013 update, additional data have been
published including concurrent IHC results for this ISH
category, and they show that this group can be heteroge-
neous. Data from a reanalysis of the HERA trial identified a
small number of cases (21 total) originally considered
negative due to ratios of ,2.0 but with an average of �6.0
HER2 signals per cell.15 All of these cases had .3 mean
CEP17 signals per cell, and 75% of them (15 of 20) had
HER2 overexpression by IHC.
In a combined study of three major academic medical
centers performing HER2 FISH and IHC, similar results
were seen with 63 cases in this ISH category; 31.7% were
IHC 3þ for HER2 by IHC, 55% were IHC 2þ, and 13.7%
were IHC 0 or 1þ.16 This study also reported a higher
frequency of Nottingham grade 3 cancers with these ISH
results than with other ISH result categories. Published data
from a reference laboratory at the University of Southern
California described 48 cases with the same ISH character-
istics and found that only 8.3% were IHC 3þ, while 14.6%
were IHC 2þ and 77% were IHC 0 or 1þ.12 Additional
analysis of these cases identified a highly amplified
subgroup (eight total cases) with an average of 12.3 HER2
Arch Pathol Lab Med—Vol 142, November 2018
ASCO/CAP HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer Update—Wolff et al
1377
 signals per cell that correlated well with HER2 IHC 2þ or 3þ
(75%). This subgroup differed significantly from the other
subgroup (40 total cases) that had a lower average of 6.8
HER2 signals per cell and 87.5% IHC negative (0 or 1þ)
results. Similarly, in the BCIRG central testing clinical trial
data, of the limited cases (nine total) with IHC data and ISH
results in this category, one was IHC 3þ positive, one was
IHC 2 þ, and seven were IHC negative.10 Taken together,
these results suggest that cases in this ISH category form a
heterogeneous group that is best discriminated by the
combination of IHC and ISH.
Due to the rarity of cases with these ISH results, there is
still limited clinical evidence regarding benefit from HER2-
targeted therapy. The BCIRG-005 data (no HER2-targeted
treatment) indicated a worse disease-free and overall
survival for this ISH category than for cases with both an
HER2/CEP17 ratio of ,2.0 and ,4.0 signals per cell (ISH
nonamplified).10 However, the few cases enrolled in the
BCIRG-006 adjuvant trastuzumab trial with these ISH
results were insufficient to assess whether there was benefit
from HER2-targeted therapy, and statistical analysis was not
attempted.
Overall, the absence of robust clinical data to guide
decisions, and the variability in IHC data, support the
concept that protein expression results should be used
concurrently in this setting to aid in determining the
significance of ISH results. In summary, group 3 cases are
uncommon and heterogeneous. Based on available data,
the ratio may not be a reliable indicator of the true gene
amplification status.25–31 Given the evidence that some
group 3 cases have true HER2 amplification rather than
polysomy for chromosome 17, particularly when the
HER2 copy number is high, the Expert Panel ultimately
favored continuing to classify these cases as HER2
positive unless the concurrent IHC result is clearly
negative (0 or 1þ).25–31
Repeat testing of other tissue samples from the patient
may also be appropriate in this setting, and, in particularly
challenging cases or if the results are in question, expert
consultation may be appropriate and include alternative
probes or other genetic methods.11 However, alternative
probes should not be used as standard practice in view of
the absence of outcome data.
Clinical Question 5
What is the appropriate diagnostic workup for invasive
cancers with an average HER2 copy number of �4.0 but
,6.0 signals per cell and an HER2/CEP17 ratio of ,2.0, and
initially deemed to have an equivocal HER2 ISH test result?
2013 Recommendation.—Cases in which the HER2/
CEP17 ratio is ,2.0 with an average HER2 copy number
of �4.0 and ,6.0 signals per cell were considered ISH
equivocal, and additional workup was required (‘‘Must order
a reflex test [same specimen using IHC], test with alternative
ISH chromosome 17 probe, or order a new test [new
specimen if available, ISH or IHC]’’).
Revised 2018 Recommendation.—If the case has an
average HER2 signals per tumor cell of �4.0 and ,6.0 and
the HER2/CEP17 ratio is ,2.0, formerly diagnosed as ISH
equivocal for HER2, a definitive diagnosis will be rendered
based on additional workup.
If not already assessed by the institution or laboratory
performing the ISH test, IHC testing for HER2 should be
performed using sections from the same tissue sample used
for ISH, and the slides from both ISH and IHC should be
reviewed together to guide the selection of areas to score by
ISH (local practice considerations will dictate the best
procedure to accomplish this concomitant review):
� If the IHC result is 3þ, diagnosis is HER2 positive.
� If the IHC result is 2þ, recount ISH by having an
additional observer, blinded to previous ISH results,
count at least 20 cells that include the area of invasion
with IHC 2þ staining:
o If reviewing the count by the additional observer
changes the result into another ISH category, the result
should be adjudicated per internal procedures to define
the final category.
o If the count remains an average of �4.0 and ,6.0
HER2 signals per cell with an HER2/CEP17 ratio of
,2.0, diagnosis is HER2 negative with a comment.
� If the IHC result is 0 or 1þ, diagnosis is HER2 negative
with a comment.
The Expert Panel recommends the following comment: It
is uncertain whether patients with an average of �4.0 and
,6.0 HER2 signals per cell and an HER2/CEP17 ratio of
,2.0 benefit from HER2-targeted therapy in the absence of
protein overexpression (IHC 3þ). If the specimen test result
is close to the ISH ratio threshold for positive, there is a high
likelihood that repeat testing will result in different results
by chance alone. Therefore, when IHC results are not 3þ
positive, it is recommended that the sample be considered
HER2 negative without additional testing on the same
specimen (Type: evidence based; evidence quality: interme-
diate; strength of recommendation: strong). An algorithm
for Clinical Question 5 is presented in Figures 3 and 6.
Literature Review and Discussion.—Cases with an
average of �4.0 and ,6.0 HER2 signals per cell and an
HER2/CEP17 ratio of ,2.0 were considered equivocal in the
2013 Guideline Update. This category (group 4 cases) has
been reconsidered by the Expert Panel based on published
literature since then, and was discussed by the representa-
tives of expert laboratories and Expert Panel members
during the open portion of the November 2016 in-person
meeting. In many published studies, the incidence of
equivocal cases has changed since the 2013 update, when
more stringent requirements for ISH interpretation were
described.1,4 The number of such cases within a laboratory
varies based on the patient population referred for ISH
testing, but it seems to be approximately 5% of cases (range,
1% to 16%).15,19–21,32–42 The use of alternative probes to
adjudicate these cases has also increased since 2013.
Data from a central reference laboratory at Mayo Clinic
included FISH data in a population of patients that is
enriched from those with HER2 IHC 2þ results based on the
original IHC testing performed locally by the referring
laboratories (1922 patients; 85% IHC 2þ). Among these
cases tested by FISH at Mayo, 14% of patients had ISH
equivocal results and one half became HER2 positive by
ratio when a locally developed and analytically validated 17p
arm probe (D17S122; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) was
combined with the HER2 probe (Abbott Molecular, Abbott
Park, IL) for additional FISH testing. However, clinical
information about benefit from HER2-targeted therapy in
such patients is not available and may not exist because
these patients would not have been eligible for the original
pivotal trials.11 The reference laboratory experience reported
by Press et al12 involving a different patient population
found 4.6% of patients among 7,526 cases with equivocal
1378
Arch Pathol Lab Med—Vol 142, November 2018
ASCO/CAP HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer Update—Wolff et al
 results when using the 2013 criteria, while 89% of these
cases were IHC HER2 0 or 1þ, 10% were IHC HER2 2þ, and
only 0.9% were IHC HER2 3þ positive. Another academic
laboratory experience that combined results from three
laboratories had a similar frequency of numbers of
specimens with equivocal results (5.2%) among 8068
patients. Similar clinical characteristics were observed in
patients with an average of �4.0 and ,6.0 HER2 signals per
cell, regardless of whether the ratio was above or below 2.0,
and most of these cases were HER2 negative by IHC and
more likely to be estrogen receptor positive.16
Group 4 cases reported as HER2 equivocal since the 2013
Guideline Update have posed a challenge to oncologists and
patients due to a perceived ambivalence about whether to
recommend HER2-targeted therapy. In the absence of an
unequivocally positive or negative test result, multiple
testing of the same tissue sample has been performed
frequently, and many laboratories have relied exclusively on
alternative probe testing to resolve cases that are more
difficult. This has often included ISH testing using multiple
chromosome 17 probes at once, many not analytically or
clinically validated. Such indiscriminate testing often results
in four or more ISH ratios being described in a single test
report and a final designation of HER2 gene amplified if just
a single ratio is �2.0. After careful consideration of this
practice and available data, the 2018 Expert Panel strongly
recommends against this as a routine testing strategy. When
the HER2 ratio score is near a decision threshold (positive or
negative), based on random variation in scoring, a
subsequent test may result in a positive or negative score
barely crossing the threshold (on either side). In such cases,
repeated ISH testing may therefore not result in higher
confidence in the final result.
Clinical correlation with other factors in a particular case
(such as grade and special histologic subtypes) or repeat
testing of other tissue samples from the patient may also be
appropriate in this setting. In particularly challenging cases
or if the results are in question, expert consultation may be
appropriate and may include alternative probes or other
genetic methods.11 However, alternative probes should not
be used as standard practice due to limited data on
outcomes for this subset of patients.33
