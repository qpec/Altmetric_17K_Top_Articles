Abstract 
Dietary protein may help prevent age-related declines in strength and functional 
capacity. This study examines the independent relation between dietary protein and 
longitudinal changes in physical functioning among Framingham Offspring Study 
adults from Exams 5 (1991-1995) to 8 (2005-2008). Protein intakes were derived from 
three-day diet records during exams 3 and 5; functional status was determined over 12 
years using seven items selected from standardized questionnaires. Multivariable 
models were used to adjust for age, sex, education, physical activity, smoking, height, 
and energy intake. Functional tasks that benefitted most from a higher-protein diet (≥1.2 
vs. <0.8 g/kg/day) were doing heavy work at home, walking ½ mile, going up and 
down stairs, stooping/kneeling/crouching, and lifting heavy items. Those with higher 
protein intakes were 41% less likely (95% CI: 0.43, 0.82) to become dependent in one or 
more of the functional tasks over follow-up. Higher physical activity and lower body 
mass index were both independently associated with less functional decline. The 
greatest risk reductions were found among those with higher protein intakes combined 
with either higher physical activity, more skeletal muscle mass, or lower BMI. This 
study demonstrates that dietary protein intakes above the current RDA may slow 
functional decline in older adults.

Aging is associated with progressive decline in muscle mass, strength, and physical 
functioning (1-3). Lean muscle mass declines from 50% of total body weight in young 
adults to 25% in 75-80 year-old adults (4). Age-related muscle loss adversely potentially 
limits physical functioning, particularly in the lower extremities (5), leading to 
increased risk of falling, restricted mobility, functional decline, and reduced life 
expectancy (6). At all ages, maintenance of lean mass requires a balance of muscle 
protein synthesis and breakdown.  
Dietary protein stimulates muscle protein synthesis by activating the mammalian target 
of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade (7).  The current Recommended Dietary 
Allowance for protein intake in the United States is 0.8 g/kg/day for adults (8). Recent 
studies suggest that for older people to maintain muscle mass and optimal physical 
functioning, greater amounts of dietary protein may be required (9, 10) to overcome 
age-related anabolic resistance (11, 12). One international panel of experts 
recommended protein intakes of 1.0 - 1.2 g/kg/d for adults ages 65 years and older, with 
even higher intakes recommended for older adults who are more physically active (13).  
Some evidence provides support for beneficial effects of higher intakes of dietary 
protein during aging. For example, adults in the highest (vs. lowest) quintile of protein 
intake in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study had 40% less 
decline in lean mass and appendicular lean mass over three years (14). In a prospective

study, elderly subjects with higher intakes of protein (1.20-1.76 g/kg/d vs. <0.8 g/kg/day) 
had fewer health problems over 10 years of follow-up (15), and 65-79 year-old women 
with higher protein intakes in the Women’s Health Initiative had lower risks of frailty 
over 3 years of follow-up (16).  
Several studies suggest that the greatest anabolic stimulus results from the combination 
of high intakes of dietary protein and resistance exercise (17, 18). Questions remain 
about whether higher protein intake alone is sufficient to maintain muscle mass and 
functional performance among older adults.  
The objective of this study was to examine the independent association of dietary 
protein intakes on long-term changes in physical functioning over more than a decade 
among initially middle-aged and older adults in the Framingham Offspring Study 
(FOS) and to determine whether any such protein-related association on functional 
status were modified by physical activity, level of skeletal muscle mass (SMM), or body 
mass index (BMI).

The FOS began in 1971 with the recruitment of 5,124 offspring (and their spouses) of 
participants in the original Framingham Study. After a second examination visit in 
1980, eight years after enrollment, FOS subjects were examined every four years.  
For the current analyses, we excluded subjects who: (1) failed to attend exam visits 3, 4, 
or 5 and provide dietary record data (n=1,840); (2) reported extreme intakes (for men, < 
1200 or > 4000 calories per day; for women, < 1000 or > 3500 calories per day) or extreme 
intakes of protein-source foods (n = 322); (3) were less than 50 years old at exams 3-5 (n 
= 868);  (4) failed to attend or provide functional status data at exam 5, 6, 7 and 8 (n = 
129); (5) failed to have more than one functional status measurement (n=115); or (6) had 
prevalent cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer) at time of baseline functional 
assessment (n =71). This left a total of 1,779 subjects for these analyses.  However, we 
further excluded subjects from task-specific analyses who were dependent in those 
tasks at baseline. For example, subjects who were unable to walk ½ mile at baseline 
were excluded from analyses related to becoming dependent in that task at the end of 
follow up. In addition, for later analyses designed to examine, for example, the risk of 
developing one or more dependencies, we included only those subjects who were 
independent in all tasks at baseline. The current analyses were conducted under the 
approval of the Boston University Institutional Review Board.

Dietary data were collected using 3-day diet records following standardized procedures 
and supervised by a trained nutritionist during exam cycles 3 (1983-1988) and 5 (1991-
1995). Subjects used two-dimensional food models to aid in estimating portion sizes. 
The dietary records were analyzed for nutrient content using the Nutrition Data System  
of the University of Minnesota (19).  
Each subject’s dietary protein intake was expressed in two ways: (1) as grams per 
kilogram (g/kg) of total body weight per day to allow for direct comparison with USDA 
recommended dietary intakes and (2) as sex-specific weight-adjusted protein intakes 
(g/day) estimated using residuals from the linear regression models. The latter was 
used to account for intake differences attributable to body weight. The protein residual 
from the regression model, which is uncorrelated with body weight, was added to the 
sex-specific group mean weight to express intake on a more readily interpretable scale. 
Each subject’s usual protein intake was estimated as the mean intake level from all six 
dietary records (two sets of 3-day records). Earlier studies have shown that dietary 
protein intake may be accurately estimated with 5-8 days of dietary records (20, 21).   
Functional status outcome assessment  
Data on the functional status of FOS subjects were collected at each exam starting with 
exam 5 (1991-1995) and ending with exam 8 (2005-2008). Two well-validated scales were

employed for this purpose: the Nagi scale (22) (a self-reported functional status scale of 
11 items) and the Rosow-Breslau scale (23) (a self-reported 6-item scale measuring 
functional status on gross-mobility tasks).  
For this study, we selected seven tasks from the Rosow-Breslau and Nagi that were 
most related to the need for strength or endurance. The three Rosow-Breslau tasks 
included heavy work at home (e.g., shoveling, washing windows, walls or floors), 
walking 1/2 mile (about 4-6 blocks), and going up and down a flight of stairs. Subjects 
were asked to report their ability to do these tasks independently; those using a cane or 
other assistive device were considered independent as long as they did not require 
assistance from another person. The four tasks selected from Nagi Scale included 
pushing/pulling heavy objects (e.g., heavy living room chair); stooping, kneeling, or 
crouching; lifting>10 lbs. (e.g., very heavy bag of groceries), and lifting <10 pounds (e.g., 
bag of potatoes). Response categories included no difficulty, a little difficulty, some 
difficulty, a lot of difficulty, and unable to do. These responses were then dichotomized 
by collapsing the first three response categories (able) and the last two (unable). 
Assessment of potential confounding and effect modification 
Each subject’s education level was categorized as having at least some college education 
or less. Weight and height were measured to the nearest 0.25 pound and 0.25 inch,

respectively, using a standard counterbalance scale with a measuring bar. BMI at each 
exam was calculated as the subject’s exam-specific weight (in kg) divided by mean 
adult height (ages 18-60 for women and ages 21-60 for men) in meters squared. The use 
of mean height helps to reduce random measurement error and the effect of height loss 
after the age of 60.  
Cigarette smoking was collected routinely at every examination visit. Subjects who 
smoked at least one cigarette per day were considered current smokers and amount 
smoked was estimated as the mean of cigarettes smoked per day during the exposure 
period (exams 3-5). Alcohol intake was similarly estimated as mean intake per day 
(grams of alcohol) from exams 3-5. Physical activity was assessed at exams 2 and 4 by 
asking each subject to report number of hours/day spent in sleep, sedentary, light, 
moderate, and vigorous activities in a 24 hour period. A physical activity index was 
derived by summing the product of the hours spent in moderate and vigorous activities 
multiplied times a weight based on the estimated energy expenditure (oxygen 
consumption) required for that activity as previously described (24).  
Each subjects’ skeletal muscle mass (SMM) was determined using data from 
bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and an equation derived by Janssen et al (25):

SMM (kg) = [(Height2 / BIA-resistance*0.401) + (Sex*3.825) + (Age*-0.071)] + 5.102, where 
height was measured in centimeters; BIA-resistance in ohms; sex is coded as men=1 and 
women=0; and age is in years. Estimated skeletal muscle mass (kg) was then converted 
to percentage skeletal muscle mass as follows: 
%SMM = skeletal muscle mass (kg) / body mass (kg) * 100  
Based on sensitivity analyses and statistical power considerations, %SMM was 
classified as low (<36% for men and <26% for women) or high (≥36% for men and ≥26% 
for women). These sex-specific cutoff values resulted in about 40% of subjects (both 
men and women) being classified as having low %SMM (referent group).  
 
Statistical analysis 
There are two analytical aims for this study: (1) to estimate the independent association 
of dietary protein intake on functional outcomes in adults, ages 50 and above and (2) to 
determine whether physical activity, skeletal muscle mass (SMM), or BMI modifies the 
association of dietary protein on functional status over time. For these analyses, dietary 
protein was categorized in two ways, as g/kg/day (classified as <0.8, 0.8-1.1, and ≥1.2 
g/kg/day) and as weight-adjusted protein derived from the residuals of a linear

regression model, classified as sex-specific quintiles (Q) of intake as follows: Q1 (mean 
intake for men and women were 56.4 and 50.2 g/d, respectively); Q2-4 (mean intakes for 
men and women were 83.3 and 71.4 g/d, respectively); Q5 (mean intakes for  men and 
women were 115.6, and 97.8 g/d, respectively).  
At each of exam visits 5 through 8, subjects were classified according to their ability to 
carry out each of the seven selected functional tasks. In each category of protein intake, 
subjects who were independent in a given task at exam 5 (1991-1995) were followed 
prospectively through exam 8 (2005-2008) (approximately 12 years) for the development 
of task-specific functional dependence by the end of the follow-up period. Additional 
analyses calculated the risk of becoming dependent in one or more functional 
disabilities and two or more functional disabilities. Person-years of follow-up was 
estimated as time from end of the protein exposure period (at exam 5) to the first of the 
following events: (1) date of development of disability in any of the specific tasks of 
interest; (2) loss to follow-up; (3) death; or (4) end of the data collection period for this 
study (exam 8). The median follow-up time for all subjects was 13 years. The lowest 
protein intake group served as the referent category for all analyses. Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to estimate the risk of becoming dependent in each of the 
functional task outcomes over 12 years of follow-up.

To explore effect modification of protein intake on functional outcomes by physical 
activity level, activity was dichotomized as lower or higher (i.e., lowest two sex-specific 
quintiles of activity vs. upper three quintiles of activity) using a sensitivity analysis. 
Possible effect modification by %SMM (<36% SMM vs. ≥36% for men and <26% SMM 
vs. ≥26% for women) and BMI (<28 kg/m2 versus ≥ 28 kg/m2) were also evaluated. Our 
evaluation of effect modification involved examining the stratum-specific hazard ratio 
estimates to determine whether the sum of the estimates from individual strata was 
consistent with an additive effect. 
To assess overall functional decline, a weighted composite score using the seven 
selected tasks from the Rosow-Breslau and Nagi scales was created with input from 
experts in the field of disability assessment. Each tasks was given a weight based on the 
level of strength and/or endurance needed to complete the task. The Rosow-Breslau 
tasks were scored as follows: (a) heavy work around the house (washing windows 
walls or floors, shoveling), 0=unable, 4=able; (b) walking up and down stairs to second 
floor, 0=unable, 3=able; and (c) walking one-half mile (about 4-6 blocks), 0=unable, 
4=able. The Nagi Scale tasks were scored as follows: (a) pulling or pushing large objects 
(e.g. living room chair), 0=unable, 1=a lot of difficulty, 2=some difficulty, 3=a little 
difficulty, 4=no difficulty; (b) stooping, crouching, or kneeling, 0=unable, 1=a lot of 
difficulty, 2=some difficulty, 3=a little difficulty, 4=no difficulty; (c) lifting or carrying

weights over 10 pounds (e.g., very heavy bag of groceries), 0=unable, 1=a lot of 
difficulty, 2=some difficulty, 3=a little difficulty, 4=no difficulty; (d) lifting or carrying 
weights under 10 pounds (e.g., bag of potatoes), 0=unable, 0.5=a lot of difficulty, 1=some 
difficulty, 1.5=a little difficulty, 2=no difficulty. Each subject’s functional score was the 
sum of all points for the 7 specified tasks (total score ranged from 0 to 25 points), 
calculated separately for each year from exams 5 through 8. To explore the change in 
the functional status score over time according to usual protein intake group, 
longitudinal mixed models for repeated measures data were used. Subject-specific 
random intercepts were used to account for the correlation between the functional 
status scores measured over time. An unstructured covariance matrix assumption was 
used. All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.3 program (SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).  
RESULTS 
Table 1 shows the subject characteristics according to daily protein intake. Adults 
consuming 1.2 g/kg/day or more of protein were leaner, more physically active, drank 
more alcohol, and consumed fewer carbohydrates per day.  
Table 2 shows the unadjusted cumulative incidence of functional disability in each of 
the seven observed tasks. It is apparent that there is a tendency for subjects with the

lowest protein intakes (whether expressed as g/kg/day or g/day of weight-adjusted 
protein intake) to have a higher prevalence of disabilities at the end of 12 years of 
follow-up. For example, 18.0% of those in the lowest category of weight-adjusted 
protein residuals were unable to walk ½ mile by exam 8 compared with only 10.1% of 
those in the highest quintile of intake. The tasks for which there were the highest levels 
of disability were heavy work at home and walking ½ mile. 
To adjust for potential confounding, we used Cox proportional hazards models in Table 
3 to estimate hazard ratios for becoming dependent in each of the seven functional tasks 
over 12 years. The confounding factors retained in the final models included age, sex, 
education, physical activity, cigarettes smoked per day, height, and total energy intake. 
For nearly all tasks, there was an inverse linear association between protein intake and 
risk of disability. Those with the highest protein intakes had the lowest risk of becoming 
dependent over 12 years. The strongest and most consistent findings were the beneficial 
associations of protein intake with walking ½ mile, climbing stairs, stooping, kneeling 
or crouching down, and lifting heavy objects. 
Table 4 examines the association of protein intake on the risk of becoming dependent in 
≥1 and ≥2 of the seven selected functional tasks over 12 years. For all subjects combined, 
those with the highest protein intakes were approximately 40% less likely to become 
dependent in one or more functional tasks and 50% less likely to become dependent in

two or more functional tasks over 12 years. The hazard ratios were slightly stronger for 
women than for men.  
In Table 5, %SMM was added to the multivariable model as a potential causal 
intermediate. Nearly all of the effect estimates were attenuated, leading us to conclude 
that %SMM is likely to be a causal intermediate in the association between dietary 
protein and functional outcomes. 
Finally, Table 6 examines the independent and combined associations of dietary protein 
and physical activity, SMM, and BMI. Subjects who were more active and consumed 
more protein were 61% less likely (95% CI: 0.24, 0.64) to become dependent in one or 
more functional tasks over 12 years. Higher physical activity alone led to a 43% 
reduction in risk while being in the highest protein category alone was associated with 
a 51% reduction in risk of dependence in one or more tasks. In these stratified analyses, 
the association of dietary protein appeared to be modified by the amount of skeletal 
muscle mass in particular on functional task. These combined associations of a higher 
%SMM and higher protein intakes were stronger among women than men (66% and 
33% reduced risks, respectively). Finally, both men and women with a BMI <28 were 
less likely to experience functional decline although women in particular who 
consumed more protein had an even greater reduction in risk of functional decline. In

general, the association of dietary protein with % SMM and BMI were approximately 
additive.  
The associations between dietary protein intake and functional status scores at exams 5 
through 8 are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 examines protein intake as g/kg/day 
while Figure 2 shows results associated with weight-adjusted protein residuals. The 
results are similar. All groups of subjects experienced declining functional scores over 
time, particularly starting at exam 7. Those in the higher two categories of protein 
intake had less functional decline throughout the follow-up period than those in the 
lowest category of intake.  
DISCUSSION 
In this study, higher dietary protein intake led to a lower risk of becoming dependent in 
functional tasks requiring strength and endurance. The types of tasks most affected by 
protein consumption included doing heavy work at home, walking ½ mile, going up 
and down a flight of stairs, stooping, kneeling, or crouching down, and lifting heavy 
items like bags of groceries. In these analyses, the estimated hazard ratios for higher 
dietary protein intakes were somewhat stronger for women than for men. It is possible 
that the weaker estimates in men could be due to some degree of bias in the reporting of 
disability. Over 12 years of follow-up, subjects consuming more dietary protein were

also less likely to become dependent in multiple functional tasks. In addition, higher 
levels of moderate and vigorous activity, in particular, as well as higher baseline levels 
of SMM and lower BMI were independently associated with greater preservation of 
functional performance over time and strengthened the beneficial association between 
dietary protein and functional performance. 
This study adds to the evidence that dietary protein plays an important role in the 
maintenance of functional independence during the later stages of life. It also supports 
previous findings that suggest that older adults may benefit from protein intakes that 
are above the current Recommended Dietary Allowance. Previous studies of protein 
requirements have been based on nitrogen balance studies, which have been largely 
conducted among young adults (26). It is increasingly recognized that such short-term 
nitrogen balance studies provide only limited information on protein requirements for 
older adults. The current analysis supports previous suggestions that a more 
meaningful approach would be to more directly evaluate the association between 
dietary protein and health and functional outcomes (27-29).  
During the middle and older-adult years, there are changes in body composition and 
lifestyle that promote the loss of lean body mass and the acquisition of greater fat mass. 
This transition is likely to be associated with a higher risk of functional decline and 
increased morbidity and mortality (30, 31). Reviews of the evidence in recent years have

shown that dietary protein and/or amino acid intake combined with resistance exercise 
can stimulate muscle protein synthesis and slow breakdown (resulting in positive net 
protein balance) despite advancing age (32). A review by Volpi et al concluded that to 
retain muscle mass, strength and optimal physical functioning among the older adults, 
the current recommendation for dietary protein intakes for older adults of 0.8 g/kg/day 
should be raised (10). 
Loss of muscle strength, often a surrogate marker for physical functioning, is associated 
with reduced functional capacity, decreased skeletal muscle mass, impaired muscle 
quality, neurological dysfunction, and other comorbid conditions (33). In the 
longitudinal InCHIANTI Study among community-dwelling adults aged ≥65 years, 
obese subjects with less muscle strength were more likely to experience declines in 
walking speed and development of new mobility disabilities compared with normal-
weight individuals without such strength loss (34). Some prior studies have shown that 
adequate protein intake combined with strength training can result in substantial 
improvements in muscle mass, strength, and physical performance in older adults (35, 
36). These results are consistent with our findings that those with a higher physical 
activity, higher %Skeletal Muscle Mass (%SMM) and lower Body Mass Index (BMI) at 
baseline were less likely to develop functional decline with age.

A clinical trial of frail elderly demonstrated that 30 g of supplemental protein (vs 
placebo) led to greater improvements in leg extension strength and physical 
performance on the Short Physical Performance Battery (35). When combined with 
resistance exercise training, protein supplementation among frail elderly subjects led to 
increased muscle mass, strength, and physical performance (37). This study is consistent 
with the current findings that higher physical activity and higher protein intake at 
baseline reduced functional decline over time.   
There are several important strengths of this study, starting with the long follow-up 
period from baseline protein intake to final measurement of functional status. Physical 
functioning outcomes were measured by well-validated Rosow-Breslau and Nagi Scales 
at four sequential exams. In addition, baseline protein intake was derived from detailed 
3-day dietary records. Another important strength of this study was the use of two 
different approaches for expressing protein intake. This approach allowed for the direct 
comparison of protein intake with the current dietary recommendations and to account 
for possible confounding by the subject’s body size that may be a concern when 
expressing protein intake as grams per kilogram per day (g/kg/d). The similarity in the 
results of these two different approaches provides greater confidence in the overall 
findings.

There are several limitations of this study and one is the lack of performance-based 
measures of functional status. Limited power for sex-specific analyses is another such 
limitation. In this study, subjects’ skeletal muscle mass (SMM) were measured by 
bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and while this is not a gold standard approach 
for measuring skeletal muscle mass, a previous cross-validation study found that 
bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) more accurately and precisely measured skeletal 
muscle mass (SMM) than did magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (25). Dietary intakes 
as well as physical activity levels, alcohol intake, and cigarettes smoking were all self-
reported, which is a limitation of the analyses. In addition, these analyses do not 
provide data on the type or source of dietary protein. Further, it is possible that 
functional impairments may be under-reported in this study although it seems unlikely 
that such under-reporting would be biased with respect to the exposure. Nonetheless, 
residual confounding is possible. Finally, incomplete information on comorbidities that 
may impact functional status change is a limitation of this study. However, most of 
these comorbidities are unlikely to be associated with dietary protein and are therefore 
unlikely to confound the results.  
In summary, this study supports the premise that raising the protein guidelines to 
above the current Recommended Dietary Allowance in older adults may help to maintain 
functional performance into later adult years. It also supports the importance of
