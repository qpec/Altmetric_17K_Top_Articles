ABSTRACT 
BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus (S.) aureus is increasingly implicated as a possible causal factor in the 
pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). However, reported prevalences of skin- and nasal 
colonisation in the literature vary widely.   
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the prevalence and odds of skin and nasal colonisation with S. 
aureus in patients with AD. 
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted. Odds ratios for colonisation in patients 
versus controls as well as the prevalence of colonisation in patients were pooled using the random 
effects model.   
RESULTS: Ninety-five observational studies of which 30 had a control group were included. The 
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess study quality, with the majority of studies being of fair to 
poor quality. Patients with AD were more likely to be colonised with S. aureus than healthy controls 
(odds ratio (OR) 19.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 10.88-35.81). In non-lesional, skin differences 
were smaller (OR 7.77, 95% CI 3.82-15.82) as well as in the nose (OR 4.50, 95% CI 3.00-6.75). The 
pooled prevalence of S. aureus colonisation among patients was 70% for lesional skin, 39% for non-
lesional skin and 62% for the nose. In lesional skin, meta-regression showed that the prevalence of 
colonisation increased with disease severity. Study heterogeneity should be taken into consideration 
when interpreting the results. 
CONCLUSION: The results indicate the importance of colonisation with S. aureus in AD. This 
encourages evaluation of the mechanisms by which S. aureus influences inflammation and 
development of targeted strategies to decrease skin- and nasal S. aureus load.   
INTRODUCTION 
Increased colonisation with S. aureus in atopic dermatitis skin was first described in the 1970s. 
Multiple studies confirmed this, reporting prevalences of skin colonisation with S. aureus from 
around 30% to nearly 100%.1-4 The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of S. aureus in relation to AD

are still not fully elucidated. However, recent studies direct towards a causal role in the complex 
pathogenesis of AD by showing that S. aureus colonisation precedes (flares of) the disease.5-9 S. 
aureus can facilitate skin barrier defects and inflammation in AD using different mechanisms.4,10 
Examples are stimulation of mast cell degranulation by staphylococcal delta toxin, induction of 
keratinocyte apoptosis by alpha toxin, stimulation of T-cells by enterotoxins that act as 
superantigens and modulation of inflammation by staphylococcal surface proteins, protein A and 
lipoteichoic acid.10-14 
 
As S. aureus contributes to both skin barrier defects and to inflammation, a more proactive control 
of S. aureus in certain patients may help reduce disease severity. However, use of antibiotics can 
result in resistance of S. aureus and perturbation of healthy microbiota which has been shown to 
have potentially deleterious health effects.15-18 Currently new targeted anti-microbial therapies are 
being developed, such as lysins directed against single bacteria (e.g. Staphefekt SA.100 against 
Staphylococcus aureus).19-22 Therefore it is important to identify patients with AD who can 
potentially benefit from anti-staphylococcal treatment.  
 
Defining the prevalence of S. aureus skin and mucosal colonisation in (subgroups of) AD patients 
might give more insight in the importance of S. aureus as a contributor to the disease and its 
severity. Current prevalence rates of S. aureus colonisation reported in AD vary widely, mainly 
depending on the type of patients included, the sample size and the methods used to collect and 
detect S. aureus or its products. Frequently used methods to collect microorganisms from the skin 
are the swab and the scrub method.23 Swabs collect bacteria from the superficial layer of the skin 
whereas a scrub technique allows collection of superficial skin cells and associated microbes.24 
Detection of S. aureus was predominantly based on culture based methods. Since a few years DNA 
sequencing methods allow determination of the complete microbial composition at species level and 
recently upcoming metagenomics techniques can be used for identification at strain level.25

With this systematic review we aimed to provide an overview and a pooled estimate of the 
prevalence and odds of colonisation with S. aureus in patients with AD.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Type of study 
Both experimental and observational (original, human) studies were included, however, case-reports 
were excluded. No restrictions were made as to publication date and language.   
 
Type of participants 
Patients of all ages with physician-confirmed AD were included.  
 
Type of outcome measures 
The primary outcome was proportion of patients with presence of S. aureus on the skin (lesional and 
non-lesional) or in the nose. Secondary outcomes were (1) the presence of S. aureus virulence 
factors on the skin and (2) the relation between AD severity and colonisation with S. aureus. 
In case of intervention studies, only the baseline measurement was included in this review. When 
studies reported multiple measurements over time taken from the same skin site (without 
treatment regimen) or when multiple locations were sampled at the same time point, the mean was 
included in the meta-analysis. Studies that reported solely on methicillin resistant S. aureus were 
excluded.  
Search strategy 
The search was conducted in Embase (from 1947), Medline (from 1946), Ovid-SP (from 1946), 
Pubmed (from 1947), Web of Science (from 1945) and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials (CENTRAL)  up to September 16th 2014. (Supplementary table 1). A cross reference check was 
performed to identify further relevant studies.

Study selection and data extraction 
The titles and abstracts were screened for relevance. Articles or abstracts were selected based on 
predefined in- and exclusion criteria (supplementary file: criteria for study selection). Non-English 
articles were translated by an official translation service when considered relevant. The 
methodological quality of the articles was rated using an adapted version of the Newcastle Ottawa 
Scale (NOS).26,27 Uncontrolled studies could reach a maximum score of 7 points and studies including 
a control group could reach a maximum score of 8. Using a scoring algorithm (supplementary 
material), the controlled studies were classified as being of poor, fair or good methodological 
quality, based on their scores on the NOS for patient selection, comparability and outcome.28 Study 
selection and quality assessment was conducted independently by two researchers (JT and WF, JT 
and MH or WF and MH). Disagreements were resolved and consensus was reached. If identical 
populations were described in different publications within an overlapping time period, the study 
with the most extensive reporting of results was included. 
 
Statistical analysis 
A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. A weighted prevalence of 
colonisation with S. aureus on the skin and in the nose was calculated. In controlled studies the 
prevalence of colonisation was compared between patients and controls, expressed as an odds ratio 
(OR) with a 95% confidence interval. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. In case of substantial 
heterogeneity between studies (I2>50%) the reasons for heterogeneity were explored using meta-
regression (only in case of > 10 available studies and using a the unrestricted ML method) for the 
variables NOS score, age and AD severity. For the meta-regression on severity, studies that used the 
Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) score or the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score were 
selected. Cut-off values for mild, moderate and severe AD were used as previous described.29,30 
Subgroup analysis was performed for variables that were significant in the meta-regression. 
Additional subgroup analysis was carried out for studies in which patients were not on antibiotic

treatment. All statistical analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2.2 
(Biostat, Englewood, NJ). Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots, Egger’s regression and 
the Trim and Fill method.31 The present systematic review was conducted and reported in 
accordance with the PRISMA guidelines.32  
 
RESULTS 
Study characteristics 
The search yielded a total of 4909 articles of which after deduplications, 2990 articles remained. 
Based on title and abstract we identified 350 studies (Fig. 1). After reading the full texts, 95 
references met our inclusion criteria. All studies had an observational design and 30 studies 
compared AD patients with healthy controls. In 77% of the studies AD was diagnosed by clinical 
assessment (dermatologist or another specialised physician). The other studies did not describe 
clearly who diagnosed the patients. The overall percentage of males was 52% and the mean age was 
14.0 years (range 0.8-68.9), both reported in 58 studies. Eleven studies measured disease severity 
using the EASI, with 9 studies reporting a mean EASI (17.7 (range 4.5-51.6)). Twenty-two of the 40 
studies that measured a SCORAD reported a mean (48.2 (range 13.5-73,5)). The remaining studies 
did not measure the severity, used other measuring methods, or did not report mean EASI or 
SCORAD values. Fifty-four percent of the studies was conducted in Europe, 27% in Asia and 13% in 
the United States. Study characteristics including the used methods to collect and identify S. aureus 
are described in Supplementary table 2. 
 
Quality of the studies 
We rated the quality of the 30 included articles with a control group as good (n=4), fair (n=4) and 
poor (n=22). The quality of the 65 uncontrolled studies varied from 1 to 6 points out of 7 on the NOS.

incomparability of the patient and control groups. Limited description of the methods used for

collection and identification of S. aureus was a reason for downgrading the uncontrolled studies. The 
low NOS scores were also partly due to inclusion of abstracts in this review, describing limited 
information on methods.  
 
Prevalence of nasal- and skin colonisation with S. aureus  
Eighty-one studies (5231 patients) reported on colonisation of the lesional skin and 30 studies, 
including 1496 patients, reported on colonisation of the non-lesional skin. Pooled analysis showed 
that 70% of the patients with AD carried S. aureus on the lesional skin (95% CI 66-74; I2= 88.31) and 
39% on the non-lesional skin (95% CI 31-47; I2 = 87.39). Pooled results of the forty-three studies 
(2476 patients) that address nasal colonisation, estimated that 62% of the patients with AD carry S. 
aureus in the nose (95% CI 57-68; I2 = 85.20) (Table 1). The prevalence varied substantially among 
studies, from 28% to 99% in lesional skin, from 3% to 79% in non-lesional skin and from 4% to 95% in 
the nose. This variation probably resulted in the considerable heterogeneity among studies and 
might be partly explained by the variation in disease severity and age between patients included in 
those studies.  
Odds of colonisation with S. aureus 
Twenty-six studies compared colonisation of the lesional skin in AD patients with healthy controls. 
From 10 studies the OR could not be obtained as the reported percentage of colonised patients or 
controls was 100% or 0%. A pooled OR based on the remaining 16 studies (including 823 patients 
and 688 controls) showed that patients were significantly more likely than controls to be colonised 
with S. aureus on the lesional skin (OR 19.74; 95% CI 10.88-35.81; p<0.001; I2 =  66.04). 12 out of 20 
studies could be included in the pooled analysis for the non-lesional skin (550 patients and 446 
controls) showing an OR of 7.77 (95% CI 3.82-15.82; p<0.001; I2 =  63.08). Pooled analysis of the 19 
out of 21 studies that evaluated nasal colonisation (1051 patients and 1263 controls) showed that 
57% of the patients was positive for S. aureus in the nose versus 23% of the controls (OR 4.50; 95% 
CI 3.00-6.75; p<0.001; I2 = 70.31) (Table 2).

Meta-regression and subgroup analysis.  
Heterogeneity between the studies was considerable, mainly in the pooled analysis of prevalence 
(>85%).  A meta-regression for the variables AD severity, NOS score and age was performed to 
identify possible sources of heterogeneity. The prevalence of lesional skin colonisation was 
independent of the NOS score but increased with AD severity (1.02; 95% CI 0.21-1.82) and age (0.64; 
95% CI 0.15-1.14). A subgroup analysis of the studies that included patients with mild AD showed 
colonisation of the skin in 43% of the patients (95% CI 31-57; I2 =79.15) whereas the pooled 
prevalence for severe AD was 83% (95% CI 74-89; I2 = 65.78). For the non- lesional skin, colonisation 
decreased with a higher NOS score (-0.27; 95% CI -0.50-(-0.04)). Subgroup analysis of the studies 
with a higher quality (NOS > 4) showed a pooled prevalence of 31% (95% 23-40; I2 = 64.62) which is 
lower than the overall prevalence of 39%. Colonisation of the nose was independent of the three 
variables (Table 1).  
The ORs for colonisation in AD patients versus controls were independent of the NOS. Severity was 
not tested as less than 10 studies were available (Table2). Additional subgroup analysis, performed 
with studies that excluded patients who used antibiotics and corticosteroids at the time of inclusion, 
showed pooled ORs that were higher than the original pooled estimate of all studies (Table 1 and 2).   
 
Enterotoxins prevalence  
The prevalence in patients of at least one toxin producing S. aureus strain on the lesional skin, varied 
between 31.5% and 80%. SEB was the toxin most often found, with a prevalence of up to 70%. One 
study reported a prevalence of toxin producing S. aureus of 11.5% on non-lesional skin. Three 
studies reported the presence of at least one toxin producing S. aureus in the nose, with prevalences 
varying between 32% and 80%. Other studies reported combined results of skin and nose samples, 
and were not taken into consideration in this study (Supplementary table 3).

Publication bias 
The funnel plots for the prevalence of skin- and nasal S. aureus in AD patients showed asymmetry 
(Supplementary Figs 2a-f). The Eggers test confirmed the presence of publication bias with 
intercepts of 3.68 (95% CI 2.71-4.65, p<0.001) for lesional skin, 0.76 (95% CI -3.06-4.85, p=0.69) for 
the non-lesional skin and 2.63 (95% CI 0.84-4.42, p=0.005) for the nose). Also the pooled analysis of 
the odds for colonisation showed publication bias with an Eggers regression intercept of 2.47 (95% 
CI 1.66-3.28, p<0.001) for lesional skin, 1.71 (95% CI 0.45-2.97, p=0.010) for non-lesional skin and 
2.08 (95% CI 0.64-3.52, p=0.023) for the nose. Adjusted prevalences and ORs according to the Trim 
and Fill method were all lower than the original estimates (Table 1 and 2).  
DISCUSSION 
With this systematic review we demonstrated that patients with AD are significantly more likely to 
be colonised with S. aureus than healthy controls on both the lesional and non-lesional skin as well 
as in the nose. Pooled prevalence of S. aureus carriage among patients is 70% for lesional skin, 39% 
for non-lesional skin and 62% for the nose. For lesional skin the prevalence appeared to be 
dependent of disease severity and age, however, this could not be confirmed for non-lesional skin or 
nasal colonisation. Substantial to considerable heterogeneity, incomparability of patient and control 
groups, variation in methods used for sampling and poor description of exposures such as 
treatment, downgraded the quality of the included articles which should be taken into consideration 
when interpreting the results33.  
The typical features of AD skin, such as a comprised barrier integrity, altered sphingolipid 
metabolism and anti-microbial peptide expression, probably facilitate colonisation with S. 
aureus.34,35 The meta-regression analysis finds a higher prevalence of colonisation among patients 
with more severe AD.  However, the causal relationship between colonisation with S. aureus and AD 
still has to be further clarified. Recent studies are more often directing towards colonisation with S. 
aureus as a primary cause rather than only a secondary effect of skin damage or an insufficient anti-
staphylococcal immune status. According to Kong et al. flares in AD go along with temporal microbial

dysbiosis, dominated by S. aureus.5 Microbiome analysis of lesions in mice with an eczematous 
phenotype revealed that dysbiosis was a driving factor for dermatitis formation and bacterial 
inoculation experiments showed that S. aureus could accelerate eczematous inflammation.36 Despite 
these studies suggesting a causal relation, a systematic review of Bath-Hextall did not demonstrate a 
beneficial clinical effect of untargeted anti-S. aureus therapy combined with steroids over steroids 
alone.37,38 However, other studies including treatment with mupirocin and bleach baths did show a 
reduction of clinical severity together with a reduction of S. aureus skin load.39,40 In our review we 
did not investigate the relation between anti-staphylococcal interventions and AD severity.  We did 
conduct a subgroup analysis however of studies that included patients who were neither receiving 
any antibiotic nor corticosteroid treatment. This showed a lower prevalence of S. aureus on the skin 
and nose, which is not in line with the antibacterial effect of both antibiotics and corticosteroids.41,42 
An explanation might be that the inclusion of patients not requiring treatment resulted in a selection 
of patients with mild AD, who are less likely to be colonised with S. aureus. 
Several factors, natural and technical, that are known to cause variation in microbiome outcomes, 
might have influenced our results. Sensitivity between methods to collect and detect S. aureus and 
its virulence factors on the human skin varies.43,44 Thereby, S. aureus might be present not only on 
the surface of the skin but also in deeper layers.45 These differences underline that the results should 
be interpreted carefully, also considering the methods used. Subgroup analysis for culture- versus 
DNA-based detection methods were not performed due to a small number of studies using DNA-
based methods. Although DNA-based methods also include non-viable bacteria, they might give 
more accurate results for quantifying S. aureus in the microbiome.    
Furthermore, the impact of exposures such as treatment-regimen and duration of the disease at the 
moment of collection were often poorly reported, which might have resulted in performance  bias. A 
subgroup analysis excluding patients using antibiotics or steroids was performed to take in 
consideration the influence of treatment on the results. However use of other (aseptic) products 
might have also influenced the microbial composition. Duration of the disease might influence the

activity of the host’s immune response, which in turn could influence the presence of S. aureus via 
an antimicrobial effect.46 The presence and quantity of micro-organisms on the skin is influenced by 
many factors that naturally give rise to changes in diversity of the microbiota over time and skin 
site.24,47-50 Examples are ethnicity and climate.51,52 It should be noted that our review reports on the 
proportion of S. aureus on the skin and mucosa determined at one specific time point. 
Due to underlying factors such as the (genetical) barrier defect and immune pathways enhancing a 
defective skin barrier, dysbiosis dominated by S. aureus is a chronic and recurring factor in AD. 8,53-55 
It is important to further evaluate the pathways by which S. aureus leads to inflammation and how 
current therapies already influence these pathways. Antibiotics and antiseptics are used in infected 
or severe AD.56,57,58 Functional textiles that are used as complementary treatment in AD might also 
decrease S. aureus colonisation.59 Glucocorticosteroids might also have an antibacterial effect 
besides their anti-inflammatory effect, probably via an effect on antimicrobial peptides, and even 
emollient mono therapy was shown to reduce bacterial colonisation.9,60 The current use of anti-
staphylococcal therapies together with literature directing towards S. aureus as a driver in AD 
pathogenesis, underlines the importance of anti-staphylococcal treatment in AD. However, long-
term (preventive) use of antibiotics and glucocorticosteroids is undesirable as they can cause side 
effects and antibiotic resistance.16  
Strengths and limitations 
To date this is the most comprehensive review that systematically summarises data S. aureus 
colonisation in patients with AD. A large number of studies was included. These studies were mainly 
observational and often consisted of small numbers of patients. By not restricting the language of 
the search, selection bias was kept to a minimum. However, selection might have occurred due to 
exclusion of studies that did not report whether samples were taken from lesional or non-lesional 
skin. The covariate ‘severity’ in the meta-analysis was based on the level of the study, which may 
have led to an aggregation bias. Indirectness of the evidence with regard to the population might 
have occurred, as determining the prevalence of S. aureus colonisation was not the primary

objective in a substantial part of the studies. Publication bias changed the outcomes considerably 
according to the Trim and Fill method. The quality of a large part of the individual studies had to be 
considered as low. Future studies into the prevalence of S. aureus in patients versus controls should 
take these quality criteria into consideration to raise the confidence in pooled estimates.  
Conclusion 
Despite the low quality of the included studies and the presence of publication bias this systematic 
review and meta-analysis demonstrates that patients with AD are more frequently colonised with S. 
aureus than healthy controls and that colonisation is increased in more severe AD. These results give 
an indication of the importance of colonisation as a factor in the pathogenesis of AD and encourage 
evaluation of targeted anti-staphylococcal therapy for the skin (and nose), for example based on the 
use of anti-S. aureus lysins. Prospective or experimental studies should further investigate causality 
and the mechanisms by which S. aureus colonisation leads to inflammation. Host factors, such as age 
and ethnicity, as well as host-pathogen interaction should be taken into consideration when 
investigating these mechanisms. Using metagenomics approaches, the possible relevance of other 
microbes in the pathogenesis of AD should also be explored. Additional examination of colonisation 
within patients with different phenotypes (sensitised and non-sensitised, early onset vs late onset) 
might give insight in the type of patients that are likely to benefit the most from targeted therapy 
against S. aureus.
