SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of
devastating neurodevelopmental syndromes that
affect up to 1 in 68 children. Despite advances in
the identification of ASD risk genes, the mecha-
nisms underlying ASDs remain unknown. Homozy-
gous loss-of-function mutations in Contactin Asso-
ciated Protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) are strongly linked
to ASDs. Here we investigate the function of
Cntnap2 and undertake pharmacological screens
to identify phenotypic suppressors. We find that
zebrafish cntnap2 mutants display GABAergic def-
icits, particularly in the forebrain, and sensitivity to
drug-induced
seizures.
High-throughput
behav-
ioral profiling identifies nighttime hyperactivity in
cntnap2 mutants, while pharmacological testing
reveals dysregulation of GABAergic and glutama-
tergic systems. Finally, we find that estrogen re-
ceptor
agonists
elicit
a
behavioral
fingerprint
anti-correlative to that of cntnap2 mutants and
show that the phytoestrogen biochanin A specif-
ically reverses the mutant behavioral phenotype.
These
results
identify
estrogenic
compounds
as phenotypic suppressors and illuminate novel
pharmacological
pathways
with
relevance
to
autism.
INTRODUCTION
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelop-
mental syndromes characterized by deficits in social interaction
and communication as well as repetitive behaviors and restricted
interests (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Gene discov-
ery in ASDs has accelerated dramatically (De Rubeis et al., 2014;
Iossifov et al., 2014; Sanders et al., 2015), providing a launching
point for the illumination of relevant biological pathways (Parik-
shak et al., 2013; Willsey et al., 2013). Contactin Associated Pro-
tein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) is one of the first genes strongly linked to
autism and epilepsy in consanguineous families (Strauss et al.,
2006). This gene encodes a cell adhesion molecule of the neu-
rexin family that localizes voltage-gated potassium channels at
the juxtaparanodal region of myelinated axons (Poliak et al.,
2003). Loss of CNTNAP2 function in mice leads to abnormal
neuronal migration, reduced GABAergic neurons, spontaneous
seizures, hyperactivity, social deficits, and increased repetitive
behaviors (Pen
˜ agarikano et al., 2011). However, the function of
CNTNAP2 in the CNS and the consequences of its loss for
ASD pathology are less well understood.
At present, our ability to advance rapidly from the identification
of risk genes to the discovery of biological mechanisms
and pharmacological suppressors remains limited. The zebra-
fish is a model vertebrate system well suited for conducting
small molecule screens to uncover modulators of signaling path-
ways (Ablain and Zon, 2013; Kokel and Peterson, 2011; Rihel
et al., 2010). Quantitative behavioral profiling provides a high-
throughput approach to characterize psychoactive molecules

 on the basis of the behavioral readout of their effects in zebrafish
larvae (Rihel et al., 2010). Here we investigate the consequences
of the loss of Cntnap2 in zebrafish and use quantitative behav-
ioral profiling as a platform to conduct rational pharmacological
screens to identify phenotypic suppressors and novel pathways
with relevance to autism.
RESULTS
cntnap2 Mutants Display GABAergic Deficits
Zebrafish have two cntnap2 paralogs that are expressed broadly
in the developing CNS, with higher expression in the telenceph-
alon (Figures S1A–S1C). Cntnap2a and Cntnap2b proteins show
71% and 65% identity to the human protein, respectively, and
contain the same functional domains (Figure 1A). To characterize
their function, we generated two loss-of-function mutations in
each paralog using zinc finger nucleases and crossed fish car-
rying these alleles to generate double-mutant fish (cntna-
p2aD121/D121cntnap2b31i/31i and cntnap2aD25/D25cntnap2bD7/D7)
(Figures S1D–S1F), referred to hereafter as cntnap2ab mutants.
Each mutation causes a premature stop codon within the discoi-
din domain and results in loss of protein expression (Figures 1A
and 1B), such that double mutants represent a loss of Cntnap2
function.
It has been proposed that an imbalance in excitatory and
inhibitory signaling in the CNS is a mechanism underlying ASD
and epilepsy (Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003). To test if this
is occurring in cntnap2ab mutants, we analyzed inhibitory and
excitatory neuronal populations in wild-type and cntnap2ab mu-
tants during early brain development, using transgenic lines that
label GABAergic neurons and precursors (Tg[dlx6a-1.4kbdlx5a/
dlx6a:GFP]) and glutamatergic neurons (Tg[vglut:DsRed]) (Gha-
nem et al., 2003; Kinkhabwala et al., 2011; Zerucha et al.,
2000). We observed a significant decrease in GABAergic cells

 in cntnap2ab mutants at 4 days post fertilization (dpf) (Figures
1C–1F, 1C0–1F0, S2A–S2H, and S2A0–S2H0) in the forebrain and
cerebellum (Figures S2I and S2J). In particular, there was an
average of 34% fewer GABAergic neurons in the forebrain of
cntnap2ab mutants compared with wild-type fish at 4 dpf (Fig-
ure 1G; p = 3.08 3 10�7, one-way ANOVA). The decreased num-
ber of GABAergic cells in the dorsal telencephalon (pallium) at
this stage is consistent with a failure in the migration of these
cells from the ventral telencephalon (subpallium), similar to find-
ings reported in Cntnap2 mutant mice (Pen
˜ agarikano et al.,
2011). In contrast, there were no significant regional deficits in
glutamatergic neurons (Figures S2A–S2H, S2A0–S2H0, and S2K).
Although there were no gross morphological abnormalities in
the structure of the axon scaffold in cntnap2ab mutants be-
tween 48 hr post fertilization (hpf) and 5 dpf (Figures S1H, S2I,
S1H0, and S2I0), mutant head size is significantly smaller (Table
S1; Figures S1N–S1R and S1N0–S1Q0). In addition, we did not
observe gross differences in markers of apoptosis (TUNEL
staining) at 28 hpf or proliferation (phospho-histone H3) at 48
hpf (Figures S2R, S2S, S2R0, and S2S0). However, deficits in
GABAergic neurons and transient delays in commissure forma-
tion are evident in the forebrain of mutants at 28 hpf (Figures
S1J–S1M, S1J0, and S1K0), indicating additional early roles for
Cntnap2 in brain development. Together, these data indicate
loss of Cntnap2 results in a deficit of inhibitory neurons, partic-
ularly in the forebrain.
Increased Seizure Susceptibility in cntnap2 Mutants
Loss of inhibitory neurons can increase susceptibility to seizures
(Cobos et al., 2005). To determine the effect of loss of Cntnap2
on seizure susceptibility in zebrafish, we treated wild-type and
mutant larvae with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a GABA-A receptor
antagonist that induces seizures in rodents and zebrafish (Bara-
ban et al., 2005; Watanabe et al., 2010). cntnap2ab mutants
display increased sensitivity to PTZ-induced seizures (Figures
1H and S3A–S3F). Drug-induced seizures appear as robust in-
creases in activity and rapid, burst-like and circling movements,
followed by periods of inactivity (Baraban et al., 2005). Homozy-
gous double mutants display significantly more activity in
response to PTZ (Figure S4B; p = 0.0013, two-way ANOVA, ge-
notype 3 dose interaction, n = 268). These results are consistent
with increased seizures associated with CNTNAP2 mutations in
humans and mice (Pen
˜ agarikano et al., 2011; Strauss et al.,
2006). Consequently, increased sensitivity to PTZ provides
further evidence for GABAergic deficits in cntnap2ab mutants.
cntnap2 Mutants Show Nighttime Hyperactivity
We next adapted a blinded, high-throughput assay to quantify
a series of rest-wake cycle behavioral parameters over multi-
ple days (Figure 2A) (Prober et al., 2006; Rihel et al., 2010).
Quantitative profiling revealed that cntnap2ab mutants display
significantly greater nighttime activity compared with wild-type
siblings between 4 and 7 dpf (Figures 2B, 2C, and S3G; p =
0.00012, one-way ANOVA, n = 838). This phenotype was inde-
pendently observed in cntnap2ab mutants harboring different
alleles (Figure S3H; p = 0.0198, n = 187). In contrast, other
rest-wake parameters (Table S2), as well as acoustic startle,
habituation, and optokinetic response (Table S3), were not
significantly affected, further highlighting the specificity of the
nighttime hyperactivity phenotype. Combined, these results
indicate that loss of Cntnap2 selectively causes nighttime hyper-
activity, consistent with GABAergic deficits leading to an imbal-
ance of excitatory and inhibitory signaling in mutant fish.
Differential Responses to Psychoactive Agents in
cntnap2 Mutants
Collectively, the day-night, rest-wake cycle parameters of
cntnap2ab mutants represent a behavioral fingerprint with a
specific nighttime hyperactivity signature. To identify molecular
pathways that are dysregulated in the absence of Cntnap2 func-
tion, we searched for drugs that phenocopy the mutant behav-
ioral profile. To this end, we compared the cntnap2ab mutant
behavioral fingerprint with a data set of the behavioral profiles
of wild-type larvae exposed to 550 psychoactive compounds
(Rihel et al., 2010). This allowed an unbiased comparison of
the different genetic and pharmacological conditions by cluster
analysis (Rihel et al., 2010) (Figure 2D) and resulted in the iden-
tification of small molecules that strongly correlate with the
mutant behavioral profile (Figure 2E). Next, we identified the
top 14 drugs that anti-correlate, or generate the opposite
phenotype of the mutant behavioral profile (Figure S4H). We
reasoned that drugs that induce differential effects in wild-
type and mutant larvae might indicate pathways that are dysre-
gulated because of loss of Cntnap2. To test this, we exposed
wild-type and cntnap2aD121/D121cntnap2b31i/31i larvae to a group
of compounds from 4–7 dpf (Figure 3A) that were selected on
the basis of the following criteria: (1) correlating; (2) anti-corre-
lating; (3) GABA-A receptor agonists, based on the structural
GABAergic deficits; and (4) risperidone, because it is the first
U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for irri-
tability and aggressive behavior in ASDs (McCracken et al.,
2002).
Three lines of evidence indicate that both glutamatergic and
GABAergic pathways are dysregulated in cntnap2ab mutants.
First, we found that both GABA- and NMDA-receptor antago-
nists are significantly enriched among drugs that strongly corre-
late with the mutant phenotype (Figures 3D and 3E; p = 0.031
and p = 0.034, respectively, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). These
findings are consistent with the behavioral profile of cntnap2ab
mutants, given that NMDA receptor antagonists induce night-
time hyperactivity in wild-type larvae, and the increased sensi-
tivity of mutants to the GABA-A receptor antagonist, PTZ. Sec-
ond, cntnap2ab mutants are more sensitive to arousal by
NMDA receptor antagonists across a range of doses (Figure 3B),
suggesting attenuation of glutamatergic signaling.
Third, we found that GABA receptor agonists, such as zolpi-
dem, induce differential behavioral effects in cntnap2ab mu-
tants compared to wild-type larvae (Figures 3C and 3F–3H).
For this analysis, we performed hierarchical clustering and prin-
cipal-component analysis (PCA) to quantify differential mutant
responses compared with wild-type across 18 rest-wake activ-
ity parameters (Rihel et al., 2010). Specifically, we calculated the
Euclidean distance between the mutant + drug and wild-type +
drug behavioral profiles, representing the difference between
the mutant and wild-type responses to each drug (Figures 3H
and S4A–S4F; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).

 Using this approach, we found that the GABA receptor agonists
zolpidem and (±)-baclofen produce the strongest differential
responses of the drugs tested (Figure 3H), suggesting pertur-
bation of GABAergic signaling pathways in mutants. Taken
together, our quantitative behavioral profiling reveals dysfunc-
tion in glutamatergic as well as GABAergic pathways due to
loss of Cntnap2.
Estrogens Reverse the Behavioral Phenotype of
cntnap2ab Mutants
Next, we searched for small molecules that suppress the mutant
phenotype of nighttime hyperactivity. We reasoned that such
compounds might elicit a behavioral fingerprint in wild-type
opposite to that of mutant larvae. We found that estrogenic com-
pounds are significantly enriched in the top ranks of small mole-
cules that anti-correlate with the cntnap2ab mutant behavioral
fingerprint (Figure 4A; p = 0.0003 by random permutation). Spe-
cifically, four of the top ten anti-correlating drugs have known es-
trogenic activity. On the basis of these results, we hypothesized
that such drugs might be able to rescue the mutant phenotype.
To test this, we analyzed the effects of estrogenic compounds
and other selected molecules in wild-type and mutant larvae us-
ing quantitative behavioral profiling and PCA (Figure 3A; see
Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Behavioral rescue
was defined as the shortest Euclidean distance between the
mutant + drug and wild-type + no drug behavioral profiles
(Figure 4D).
We found that biochanin A, a plant-derived estrogen, and
b-estradiol 17-cypionate most strongly reverse the mutant
behavioral phenotype (Figures 4B–4D and S4G). Indeed, the
behavioral response of cntnap2ab larvae treated with biochanin
A (0.1 mM) from 4–7 dpf most strongly correlates with the wild-
type phenotype, decreasing nighttime activity with little effect
on other measures of rest and activity (Figures 4B and 4C). In
contrast, risperidone (0.001 mM) reverses nighttime hyperactivity
but alters other rest-wake cycle parameters, indicating that it
elicits a less specific phenotypic rescue than biochanin A (Fig-
ures 4C, 4E, and 4F). In addition, we found that early exposure
to biochanin A does not reverse the GABAergic deficits (Fig-
ure S4M) or drug-induced seizures (Figure S4K) and that chronic
exposure followed by washout does not rescue nighttime hyper-
activity (Figure S4L), providing evidence for an acute mechanism
of action. Consistent with estrogenic activity, we found that bio-
chanin A (10 mM) significantly activates the expression of estro-
gen response genes in zebrafish larvae (Figure S4N). However,
the rescue dose (1 mM) shows only a weak effect on target genes,
suggesting that the behavioral rescue might occur indepen-
dently of the robust transcriptional activation of estrogen target
genes. Moreover, we found that biochanin A (0.1–1 mM) leads
to selective suppression of nighttime activity at 5 dpf and no
change in daytime activity in background-matched larvae (Fig-
ures 4G and 4H), indicating its effects are not due to background
effects or generalized sedation. Furthermore, b-estradiol (1 mM)
is also able to rescue nighttime hyperactivity in cntnap2ab mu-
tants (Figure S4J). Together, these results provide evidence
that biochanin A and b-estradiol acutely suppress a specific
behavioral phenotype in a genetic loss-of-function model of an
ASD risk gene.
DISCUSSION
This study represents the first characterization of zebrafish
mutants of an ASD risk gene using quantitative behavioral
profiling to identify biological pathways with relevance to
ASDs. We demonstrate that zebrafish cntnap2ab mutants
display reductions in GABAergic neurons, increased sensitivity
to drug-induced seizures, and nighttime hyperactivity. Further,
our pharmacological data support dysregulation of GABAergic
and glutamatergic signaling in mutants. Altered NMDA signaling
has been shown to cause GABAergic deficits, particularly in par-
valbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, and has been proposed as
a mechanism underlying neuropsychiatric disorders (Keilhoff
et al., 2004; Saunders et al., 2013). Moreover, mouse Cntnap2
knockouts display GABAergic deficits, most prominently in
PV+ interneurons (Pen
˜ agarikano et al., 2011). Further studies
are required to determine if PV+ subpopulations are altered in
cntnap2ab mutants, but our study highlights that GABAergic def-
icits are likely to occur in concert with alterations in NMDA cir-
cuits, not previously associated with Cntnap2.
Next, our results uncover the ability of estrogens to rescue the
cntnap2 mutant behavioral phenotype, suggesting that these
compounds serve as modifiers of neural circuits disrupted in
mutants. Indeed, estrogens can signal to multiple downstream
pathways, including transcriptional activation of estrogen res-
ponse genes, regulation of other transcription factors, and rapid
activation of intracellular signaling pathways (Marino et al.,
2006). The extent to which estrogens alter one or more down-
stream intracellular signaling pathways remains to be deter-
mined, but our findings suggest that the rescue activity likely
involves an acute mechanism other than robust activation of es-
trogen target genes. Moreover, estrogens have been shown to
affect glutamatergic signaling. Estradiol increases dendritic
spine density and long-term potentiation via an NR2B-depen-
dent mechanism that can be blocked by exposure to NMDA
antagonists, such as MK-801 (Smith et al., 2009). Therefore, es-
trogens may be acting upstream of the identified NMDA and
GABA deficits. Although there is growing interest in the effects
of sex hormones on brain development and ASD risk, given the
4:1 male/female ratio of classical autism (Baron-Cohen et al.,
2011; Schaafsma and Pfaff, 2014), further investigations are
required to determine whether such a mechanism might
contribute to the observed female protective effect suggested
by recent human genetics studies of ASDs (Jacquemont et al.,
2014).
As the list of reliable ASD risk genes continues to expand,
there is a growing need for biologically relevant systems to
advance from gene discovery to pharmacological screens. We
demonstrate that quantitative behavioral profiling of zebrafish
cntnap2ab mutants can be used as a novel platform for the pre-
diction and in vivo screening of compounds to identify suppres-
sors of a behavioral phenotype resulting from loss of an ASD risk
gene. Future testing in a mammalian system is a critical next
step. Moreover, the study of zebrafish mutants of the ASD
risk gene, CNTNAP2, and its differential responses to psychoac-
tive agents reveals the strength of this approach to identify mo-
lecular mechanisms and potential pharmacological candidates
for further evaluation.

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Zebrafish
Mutations in cntnap2a and cntnap2b were generated using zinc finger nucle-
ases. The cntnap2aD121/D121cntnap2b31i/31i and cntnap2aD25/D25cntnap2bD7/D7
lines were generated by incrossing double homozygotes, which are viable
and fertile. Tg(dlx6a-1.4kbdlx5a/dlx6a:GFP) and Tg(vglut:DsRed) were ob-
tained from the laboratories of M. Ekker and J. Fetcho, respectively. cntna-
p2aD121/D121cntnap2b31i/31i mutants were crossed to these transgenic lines.
Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee regulatory standards (Yale University) and the UK
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
Pharmacological Screen
Larval activity was monitored from 4–7 dpf using a custom-modified Zebrabox
and automated video tracking system (Viewpoint; LifeSciences) (Rihel
et al., 2010). Correlation analysis was done in MATLAB (R2014a; The
MathWorks) to identify compounds that correlate or anti-correlate with the
cntnap2aD25/D25cntnap2bD7/D7 phenotype. Three doses of each compound
(Figure 3A; Table S4) were tested in 10–12 cntnap2aD121/D121cntnap2b31i/31i
or wild-type replicate larvae with 10–12 control larvae per 96-well plate (Rihel
et al., 2010). Hierarchical clustering was conducted in MATLAB with the statis-
tics and bioinformatics toolboxes.
