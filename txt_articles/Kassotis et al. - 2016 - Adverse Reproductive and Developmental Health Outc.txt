Unconventional oil and gas operations using hydraulic fracturing can contaminate surface and
groundwater with endocrine-disrupting chemicals. We have previously shown that 23 of 24 com-
monly used hydraulic fracturing chemicals can activate or inhibit the estrogen, androgen, gluco-
corticoid,progesterone,and/orthyroidreceptorsinahumanendometrialcancercellreportergene
assay and that mixtures can behave synergistically, additively, or antagonistically on these recep-

through birth. This prenatal exposure to oil and gas operation chemicals suppressed pituitary
hormone concentrations across experimental groups (prolactin, LH, FSH, and others), increased
body weights, altered uterine and ovary weights, increased heart weights and collagen deposition,
disrupted folliculogenesis, and other adverse health effects. This work suggests potential adverse
developmental and reproductive health outcomes in humans and animals exposed to these oil and
gas operation chemicals, with adverse outcomes observed even in the lowest dose group tested,
equivalent to concentrations reported in drinking water sources. These endpoints suggest poten-
tial impacts on fertility, as previously observed in the male siblings, which require careful assess-
ment in future studies. (Endocrinology 157: 3469–3481, 2016)
W
e have recently reported that chemicals used in
and/or produced by unconventional oil and natural
gas (UOG) operations can act as endocrine-disrupting
chemicals(EDCs)bothinvitroandinvivo(1,2).EDCsare
exogenous chemicals or mixtures of chemicals that are
able to interfere with any aspect of hormone action (3)
through direct interaction with hormone receptors (4, 5)
or indirect interactions such as enhancement or suppres-
sion of response to endogenous hormones (6–8), modu-
lation of endogenous hormone levels (9, 10), or other
mechanisms (11, 12). As many as 1000 synthetic and nat-
urally occurring EDCs have been identified (13), and are
often able to act at environmentally relevant concentra-
tions (realistic exposure levels below those traditionally
examined in toxicological risk assessments), exhibit non-
monotonic dose-response curves (quantitatively and/or

 qualitatively different outcomes across a wide dose-re-
sponse range), and often exert greater effects during crit-
ical periods of development when exposure can disrupt
normal development and lead to later disease (14–17).
Hydraulic fracturing involves the high-pressure under-
ground injection of up to several million gallons of water
mixed with chemicals and suspended solids to increase
production from both unconventional (nonporous shale
or coal bed layers) and conventional fossil fuel deposits
(18, 19). As such, wastewater from the process can be
heavily laden with naturally occurring radioactive com-
pounds, heavy metals from the target geologic layer, and
chemicals used in extraction operations or liberated dur-
ing the process such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
alkenes, alkanes, and other volatile and semivolatile or-
ganics (19–26). Oil and natural gas operations can con-
taminate drinking water, with recent studies suggesting
well casing failures (27) and surface spills (28) may be the
main causative mechanisms. More than 1000 different
chemicals are used in UOG operations throughout the
United States (18–20, 29, 30), at least 130 of which are
known or suspected EDCs (1, 18, 31). Work in our lab-
oratory has further described increased antagonist recep-
tor activities in surface and ground water near fracturing
fluid spill sites (1) and a wastewater injection disposal well
(32). These data suggest that oil and natural gas opera-
tions may increase EDC activity in nearby surface and
ground water, although insufficient baseline water quality
data often exists to make a causative link (29, 33).
Health outcomes after exposure to UOG operation
chemicals are poorly understood (2, 34, 35), although ad-
verse human and animal health outcomes are more fre-
quently self-reported in UOG regions (36–38) and inpa-
tient hospital utilization rates can be higher (39).
Furthermore, Bamberger and Oswald have reported many
adverse health effects linked to UOG activity specifically;
in cases where residents/animals moved away from activ-
ities or local production decreased, certain of these health
concerns were alleviated (40). Limited epidemiological
studies have assessed adverse health outcomes in poten-
tially exposed populations, reporting that increased risks
of congenital heart defects (41), low birth weight/small for
gestational age children (42), preterm birth, and high risk
pregnancies (43) are associated with increased density
and/or proximity to UOG development, outcomes also
associated with gestational EDC exposure (44–47). Nu-
merous studies have reported elevated concentrations of
specific contaminants in water and/or animals near these
operations, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and
xylenes (48–51), 2-butoxyethanol (52), diesel range or-
ganics (28), heavy metals (24, 53), and other compounds
(25, 54–56). These and other individual chemicals used
throughout the UOG process have been associated with
increased rates of adverse reproductive outcomes such as
miscarriage, preterm birth, and decreased fertility, re-
viewed previously (2, 35).
Based on mechanistic in vitro work performed in our
laboratory (57), a range of endpoints previously demon-
strated to be susceptible to estrogen, androgen, proges-
terone, glucocorticoid, and/or thyroid receptor inhibition
were selected for evaluation after gestational exposure,
including
anogenital
distance,
body
weight,
organ
weights, pubertal development, serum hormone levels,
and folliculogenesis. Specifically, exposure to antiandro-
gens such as flutamide can alter anogenital distance (58,
59), FSH, LH, and other hormones (60, 61) and disrupt
folliculogenesis (62–66) in females of several species. In-
hibition of other receptor pathways examined here can
decrease uterine and ovary weights (67–71), alter LH,
FSH, and other pituitary hormone levels (57, 72), disrupt
folliculogenesis (73–75), increase body weights (76, 77),
and contribute to cardiac abnormalities (44, 45, 78) and
increased collagen content (79). As such, we hypothesized
that prenatal exposure to this mixture of UOG EDCs at
likely environmentally relevant concentrations would im-
pact hormone-sensitive endpoints in prepubertal and
adult female mice.
As of yet, no controlled in vivo experiments have been
performed to assess female health outcomes after devel-
opmental exposure to environmentally relevant concen-
trations of UOG chemicals. Recent work has highlighted
this deficit, finding that for 1021 UOG chemicals, repro-
ductive or developmental toxicity data existed for only
126 and 192 chemicals, respectively (80). We recently re-
ported adverse reproductive and developmental health
outcomes in C57Bl/6 male mice (siblings to the females
reported here) after prenatal exposure to likely environ-
mentally relevant concentrations of a mixture of 23 hy-
draulic fracturing chemicals (57). The goals of this study
were to continue to address this major data gap by assess-
ing the effects of developmental exposure to this labora-
tory-created mixture of oil and gas chemicals on repro-
ductive and developmental health in female C57Bl/6 mice.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Twenty-three oil and natural gas operation chemicals (all
�97% purity) were selected (Supplemental Table 1) based on
previous work in our lab demonstrating endocrine activity for 5
receptors (57). All hydraulic fracturing chemicals were pur-
chased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Stock solutions were prepared in
absolute 200 proof ethanol and stored at �20°C between uses.

 Animal experiment study design
Reported here are data on female offspring from a pairing of
virgin C57Bl/6J mice (sires and dams of mated mice were pur-
chased from Jackson labs); data on male sibling offspring was
reported previously (57). Briefly, mice were housed in polysul-
fone microisolator cages under temperature and light-controlled
(12-h light, 12-h dark cycle) conditions in a barrier facility. Mice
werefedsterilizedLabDiet5053andreceivedsterilized,acidified
water ad libitum from glass bottles that was found to contain no
activity for the estrogen, androgen, progesterone, thyroid, or
glucocorticoid receptors (data not shown). All procedures were
performed according to approved University of Missouri Animal
Care and Use Committee protocol and were in accordance with
the National Research Council’s Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals.
Ten-week-old mice were time-mated and gestation day 0 was
denoted as the day of vaginal plug visualization. Dams were
randomized into treatment groups (n � 11, 10, 10, 11, 10, and
10), respectively and, beginning on gestation day 11 and ending
at birth, had their drinking water supplemented with experimen-
tal treatments (Supplemental Figure 1) as described previously
(57). Treatments included a 0.2% ethanol vehicle, 166.67-
�g/mL flutamide antiandrogen control (50-mg/kg�d estimated
dam exposure based on body weights), and 4 concentrations of
a mixture of 23 UOG chemicals shown previously to inhibit the
estrogen, androgen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, and/or thy-
roid receptor (Supplemental Table 1), with each of the 23 chem-
icals at 0.01, 0.10, 1.0, and 10 �g/mL (3-, 30-, 300-, and 3000-
�g/kg�d estimated dam exposure; Mix3, 30, 300, and 3000,
respectively). Chemical concentrations were selected to mimic
environmentally relevant concentrations as available; concen-
trations for most chemicals in the 2 lowest doses were equivalent
to those reported in drinking water in drilling regions and in the
highest dose were equivalent to those reported in industry waste-
water samples (35, 57), although analytical measurements on
several of the 23 constituent chemicals have not yet been assessed
in wastewater and/or drinking water. Litters with less than 2
males and 2 females were completely removed due to concerns of
skewed gestational hormone exposure (81, 82); litters with at
least 2 males and 2 females were left unaltered, as culling indi-
vidual pups within litters can alter feeding status, behavior, and
physiology (83). Water intake was monitored by weighing the
drinking bottle each day of the treatment window, and no sig-
nificant differences were noted between groups relative to the
vehicle control (data not shown). Food intake was not
monitored.
As described previously (57), anogenital distance was as-
sessed on postnatal day (PND)7 and body weights were mea-
sured through PND21 for all pups (Supplemental Figure 1). One
randomly selected female pup from each litter was necropsied on
PND21. Each animal was euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyx-
iation and cardiac puncture, and tissues were excised. Tissues
were weighed and then either formalin fixed for 24 hours for
histological evaluation or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. All re-
maining females were assessed for age of vaginal opening daily
beginning on PND25, after which vaginal cytologies were per-
formed for a minimum of 3 weeks to assess age of first vaginal
estrus. A second randomly selected female from each litter was
collected on approximately PND85 at estrus, based on vaginal
cytologies performed daily and for 1 week leading up to collec-
tion, as described previously (84, 85). Remaining pups were used
in pilot studies to assess other endpoints of interest.
Ovarian follicle assessment
Ovariesusedtoassessfollicledistributionwerecollectedfrom
pups at PND21 and PND85. After fixation, ovaries were em-
bedded in paraffin and every fourth 5-�m section was mounted
and stained with hematoxylin & eosin (IDEXX). Slides were
randomly coded according to treatment groups and follicle
counting was performed using the fractionator approach (86).
Briefly, only follicles with a visible oocyte nucleus were counted
to ensure no duplication of follicle counts. Follicles were classi-
fied as 1) primordial: single layer of squamous granulosa cells; 2)
primary: single layer of cuboidal granulosa cells; 3) secondary:
more than 1 layer of cuboidal granulosa cells and no antrum; 4)
antral: multiple layers of cuboidal granulosa cells and a visible
antrum; or 5) atretic: follicles with collapsed basement mem-
brane, zona pellucida remnants, and a majority of picnotic nuclei
in any remaining granulosa cells. Because representative follicles
of the whole ovary were counted, data are expressed as total
follicle numbers at each follicular stage and compared with ve-
hicle control animals.
Serum hormone measurements
Blood was collected from mice via cardiac puncture at time of
necropsy and stored on ice. Serum was separated by centrifuga-
tion and stored at �80°C until shipment to Dr Wolfe’s labora-
tory at Johns Hopkins University on dry ice, where serum hor-
mone assays were performed as described previously (87).
Briefly, pituitary hormone concentrations were simultaneously
measured in serum samples using a Milliplex Mouse Pituitary
Magnetic Bead Panel (catalog number RPTMAG-49K; Milli-
pore) and measured on a Luminex 200 system (Life Technolo-
gies). Serum estradiol (E2) was measured in duplicate using a
mouse/rat E2 ELISA kit (catalog number ES180S-100; Calbio-
tech). Interassay coefficient of variation (CV) for the Luminex
pituitary panel was between 3% and 12%, and intraassay CV %
was between 1.75% and 6.23%. Limits of sensitivity were as
follows: brain-derived neurotrophic factor, 1.6 pg/mL; LH, 1.9
pg/mL; FSH, 9.5 pg/mL; TSH, 1.9 pg/mL; ACTH, 1.7 pg/mL;
GH,1.7pg/mL;andprolactin(PRL),46.2pg/mL.Theintraassay
CV for the E2 ELISA was 0.87%–8.3%, and the limit of sensi-
tivity was 3 pg/mL.
Heart assessments
Whole hearts from PND21 and PND85 animals were excised
from 1 female mouse per litter and were fixed as described above.
Complete details on heart staining and analysis are provided in
the Supplemental Materials and Methods. Briefly, hearts were
paraffin-embeddedand25-�mmidsagittalsectionswerecutand
placed on slides. For collagen assessments, slides were stained
with Picrosirius red, and collagen was visualized using bright-
field microscopy. MetaMorph was used to create a tiled image of
the whole heart, and areas of heart and collagen were assessed
using ImageJ. The collagen deposition was then calculated by
taking the percentage of collagen area divided by the heart area.
For cardiac myocyte immunostaining, 1 slide per heart was se-
quentially heated in sodium citrate buffer for antigen retrieval,
incubated with a blocking solution, and then incubated over-
night with 2 primary mouse antibodies. The next day, the sec-

then
assessed with an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope for
troponin I (green), wheat germ agglutinin (red), and cell nuclei
(blue). Thirty longitudinal cardiac myocytes were randomly se-
lected, and diameters across the middle of the myofiber nuclei
were measured and averaged using ImageJ. One-way ANOVA
using SPSS was used to assess significance.
Statistical analysis
Linear models were used to analyze the results from single-
point-per-litter data (follicle development stages, sex ratio, litter
size, organ weights, body weights postweaning, liver gene ex-
pression, cardiac myocyte diameter). Linear mixed models were
used to analyze the results from multiple-point-per-litter data
(anogenital distance, body weights preweaning, pubertal devel-
opment, follicle numbers per developmental stage), and incor-
porated random effects to account for dependence among re-
peated measurements from litters. Fixed effects included
treatment, sex ratio, litter size, body weight, birth weight
(PND7), and/or date of measurement or collection when appro-
priate. Variables were transformed for normal distributions
when necessary and adjusted means back transformed for pre-
sentation. Least-squares means were used to determine 95%
confidence intervals for differences to ve-
hicle control and for planned contrasts.
Diagnostic plots were used to assess the
fit and check distributional assumptions.
Proc GLM and GLIMMIX in SAS 9.4
(SAS, Inc) were used for all analysis, un-
less specified elsewhere.

 Folliculogenesis in developmentally exposed
female mice
BecauseEDCshavebeenshowntoalterfolliculogenesis
in rodents (63), we assessed ovaries at both PND21 and
PND85. Each treatment had an effect on at least 1 follicle
stage. At PND21 (Figure 2, A–E), primordial and primary
follicleswerereducedinmiceexposedtoMix30compared
with vehicle controls (25% and 49% respectively) (Figure
2, A and B). At PND21, secondary follicles were reduced
in Mix300- and flutamide-exposed animals (35% in both
treatments) (Figure 2C). Conversely, both Mix300 and flu-
tamide exposure increased antral follicles at PND21 (70%
and 71%, respectively) (Figure 2D). No effect of treatment
was observed on atretic follicle number at PND21 (Figure
2E). At PND85, primordial follicle number was increased in
animals exposed to Mix3 and Mix30 compared with vehicle
controls(37%and46%,respectively)(Figure2F).Similarly,
primary follicle number was increased in animals exposed to
Mix3, Mix30, and Mix3000 (46%,
44%, and 37%, respectively) (Figure
2G). Secondary follicle number was
increased in PND85 animals exposed
to Mix30 by 43% (Figure 2H). The
number of atretic follicles was in-
creased in PND85 animals exposed to
Mix3, Mix30, and flutamide com-
pared with vehicle animals (52%,
59%, and 75%, respectively) (Figure
2J).
Follicle numbers in each stage
changed with age in vehicle control
animals (Figure 2, K–O). However,
Mix30 did not display this normal
reduction in primordial follicle num-
bers over time (Figure 2K). Primary
follicles were reduced in vehicle con-
trols over time, whereas numbers of
primary follicles actually increased
in animals from the Mix30 treat-
ment group (Figure 2L). In addition,
no increase in antral follicle numbers
was observed in animals exposed to
Mix300, Mix3000, or flutamide as
compared with the normal increase
over time observed in vehicle mice
(Figure 2N). Importantly, there was
anincreaseinatreticfolliclenumbers
over time in animals exposed to
Mix3,

and

whereas no increase was observed in

Statistical
analysis
revealed
a
treatment by age interaction (P �

teraction and an age by treatment by
follicle stage interaction (P � .001)
were also observed, indicating a sig-
nificant impact of these hydraulic

esis, dependent on both dose and age
of the animal.

 Body and organ weights and puberty in
developmentally exposed female mice
Body weights were elevated in the Mix3 and Mix300
groups at PND7, PND13, and PND21 (Figure 3). Weights
were approximately 4% greater at PND7 (Figure 3A), 5%
at PND13 (Figure 3B), and 9%–10% at PND21 (Figure
3C and Supplemental Table 2), although were not signif-
icantly different at PND85 (Supplemental Table 3). De-
velopmental exposure appeared to alter reproductive or-
gan development; Mix3 and flutamide significantly
reduced blotted uterine weight at PND85, with a trend for
increase observed in Mix3000 animals (P � .10) (Figure
4A). Further, exposure to Mix3 tended to increase ovary
weight at PND85 (P � .10), whereas exposure to Mix300
tended to decrease it (P � .10) (Figure 4B). Spleen weights
also tended to be greater in the Mix300 and flutamide
groups (P � .10) at PND21 only (Supplemental Tables 2
and 3).
No significant differences in litter size, sex ratio, and
cannibalization rate were observed for any treatments
(Supplemental Table 4). However, cannibalization of en-
tire litters before PND7 occurred with 1, 2, and 3 cases in
the Mix3, Mix30, and Mix3000 groups, respectively, as
reported previously (57). Age of vaginal opening, age of
first vaginal estrus, and the length of the interval between
these ages were also assessed, although no significant dif-
ferences were noted between experimental groups (Sup-
plemental Table 4).
Heart assessment in developmentally exposed
female mice
Heart weights tended to be elevated at PND21 in Mix3
andMix300groups(P�.10)(Figure5A),atrendthatwas
still evident but less pronounced at PND85 (Figure 5B),
similar to what was observed in males (57). Hearts were
assessed for cardiac myocyte size and collagen content. At
PND85, Mix3, Mix30, and flut-
amide hearts exhibited 78% (P �
.15), 152% (P � .05), and 165%
(P � .05) increased collagen deposi-
tion, respectively, than controls (Fig-
ure 5D). At PND21, collagen depo-
sition tended to be elevated in the
Mix30 group (Figure 5C). Cardiac
myocyte size was not found to differ
between treatment groups at either
PND21 (Figure 5E) or PND85 (Fig-

serum testosterone, body weights,
heart weights, cardiomyocyte size,
and decreased sperm counts (57).
Based on assessment of disruption
for 5 nuclear receptors by these
chemicals in vitro (1, 57), likely caus-
ative mechanisms for adverse male
health outcomes included antago-
nism of the estrogen, androgen, glu-
cocorticoid, and thyroid receptors
(57). This study expanded this work
to developmentally exposed females.
Reproductive or developmental ef-
fects have been previously reported
for several of the UOG chemicals
used here, although only at high
doses typical of occupational expo-
sure (2).
Pituitary
hormone
production
was strongly altered in animals from
all treatment groups (Figure 1). No-
tably, these mechanisms were hy-
pothesized as a potential causative
mechanism for the greatly enhanced
serum testosterone observed in the
male siblings (57). Serum PRL was
suppressed in all mixture groups and
in the antiandrogen flutamide con-
trol relative to the vehicle. Serum
FSH and LH were suppressed in the
flutamide group and all mixture
groups except for Mix300. Serum
GH and TSH both exhibited the op-
posite
trend,
with
significantly
greater concentrations than vehicle
in
the
Mix300
treatment.
Sup-
pressed PRL concentrations (�70%
decrease in experimental groups)
may result in profound reproductive
effects in these animals; PRL is crit-
ical for lactation, female receptivity, and parenting behav-
ior, as well as immune function, angiogenesis, metabo-
lism, and more (88). Suppressed FSH (�55%, all but
Mix300) may result in impaired fertility; FSH receptors
are localized to ovarian granulosa cells and activation is
considered essential for folliculogenesis (89). Suppressed
LH (�49%, all but Mix300) may also impact fertility; LH
is critical for folliculogenesis, ovulation, and for mainte-
nance of luteal function (90). Suppressed FSH, LH, and
other hormones after flutamide exposure have been re-

 ported previously in several species (60, 61), and this may
thus reflect an antiandrogenic effect of the mixture treat-
ment on these animals. Elevated GH and TSH in Mix300
animals (157% and 83% increases, respectively) may re-
sult in disruption of normal growth and development; GH
drives increased muscle mass, growth of internal organs,
etc (91), whereas TSH stimulates the release of T4, which
after conversion to T3, regulates metabolism, growth and
development, and other functions (92). The elevated body
weights observed in animals from the Mix300 treatment
are consistent with the increases in GH and TSH in this
group (Figures 1 and 3), although body weights were not
significantly different by PND85 when hormone concen-
trations were measured. This may be due to compensatory
mechanisms for controlling metabolic outcomes in these
animalsthatshouldbeevaluatedmorecomprehensivelyin
future studies.
Decreased uterine and ovary weights were observed in
our mice and have also been observed after developmental
inhibition of several receptor pathways examined here
(67–71). Interestingly, FSH receptor knockout mice also
exhibit increased testosterone levels and body weights
(68), both observed in male siblings (57). However, these
various receptor inhibition models also result in elevated
LH, FSH, and/or E2 levels, none of which were observed
in our study animals. Maternal hypothyroidism has also
been shown to reduce uterine weights, LH, and FSH levels
in offspring (72), although also reduces testosterone in
males, contrary to what we observed previously (57). Be-
cause hypothalamic releasing hormones were not mea-
suredinthecurrentstudy,wecouldnotdeterminewhether
the programming target was hypothalamic, pituitary, or a
combination. Determining the causative mechanism for
the observed effects should be targeted in future research.
Gestational exposure to the UOG mixture appeared to
alter folliculogenesis in these animals. The hypothalamic-
pituitary-gonadal axis and normal steroid hormone syn-
thesis is integral to normal postpubertal follicular devel-
opment from the primordial follicle until ovulation (75).
As described above, it appears that gonadotropin secre-
tionisdisruptedinexposedanimals,howeveritisnotclear
whether this disruption is the cause or effect of altered
ovarian morphology. Interestingly, peripubertal (PND21)
ovarian morphology is only mildly altered in exposed an-
imals, before the cyclic secretion of the gonadotropins
FSH and LH. Examination of neonatal ovaries after ges-
tational exposure may help shed light on the true extent of
chemical exposure on the resultant ovarian pool of
oocytes. However, the total number of primordial and
primary follicles was reduced in Mix30-exposed animals
at PND21, suggesting depletion of the ovarian reserve at
this dose. At PND85, the number of primordial follicles
remained unchanged, whereas primary follicle number in-
creased 2.3-fold accompanied by a 2.9-fold increase in
follicle atresia. This altered transition is suggestive of in-
appropriate follicle activation (or accumulation) and ul-
timate follicle death. The ovarian follicle is responsible for
housing the finite population of oocytes required for prop-
agation of future generations. In addition, the somatic
cells of the follicle (theca and granulosa cells) and corpus
luteum(lutealcells)arekeytothepostpubertalproduction
of the sex steroids progesterone, testosterone, and E2 that
are required for normal estrous (or menstrual) cyclicity via
feedback control of the hypothalamus. The process of fol-
liculogenesis during fetal development sets the number of
total follicles that will be available for activation and po-
tential ovulation during the entire reproductive lifespan of
an animal (reviewed in Ref. 93). Thus, although we have
not tested the fertility of these offspring, it is likely that
they would be fertile, but this fertility may be shorter lived
in some animals (based on this altered temporal transition
of follicles through the developmental stages).
We reported increased body weights for female off-
spring at PND7 through PND21 in the Mix3 and Mix300
groups, although limited direct evidence exists regarding
the adipogenic potential of the chemicals tested here (76).
Nonylphenol and octylphenol (metabolites of the alkyl-
phenol ethoxylates included here) can promote adipogen-
esis in vitro and in vivo (94, 95), and naphthalene has been
associated with increased child obesity rates (96). 2-Eth-
ylhexanol (97) and several oil dispersants and constituent
chemicals tested here (98, 99) can activate peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor �, often considered a mas-
ter regulator of adipogenesis. To the best of our knowl-
edge, none of these 23 chemicals have directly been tested
for adipogenic potential in the 3T3-L1 or similar preadi-
pocyte cell lines. Given that 20 and 6 of the chemicals
included here antagonized the androgen and thyroid re-
ceptors (57), respectively, this may be the underlying
mechanism that drives the increased weight in these ani-
mals (100–102). Epidemiological studies have reported
disparate findings on birth weight and maternal proximity
to unconventional natural gas development during preg-
nancy; similar study designs reported increased birth
weights in Colorado children (41) and decreased birth
weights in the Marcellus Shale region (42). Further work
should elucidate the adipogenic potential of these chem-
icals more directly. It should be noted that Mix300 ani-
mals exhibited elevated serum GH and TSH, whereas
Mix3didnot,suggestingthatthemechanismforincreased
weight in Mix3 and Mix300 animals may be driven via
different mechanisms.

 the male siblings (57) and hypothesized a possible hyper-
trophic phenotype. In the current analysis of female off-
spring, we found increased cardiac fibrosis (2.4-fold in-
crease in collagen deposition in Mix30 and flutamide
groups) as well as trends for increased heart weights and
enlarged cardiomyocytes (P � .12), endpoints that can be
indicative of cardiac hypertrophy (103–105). Excess fi-
brosis can cause stiffness, resulting in a reduction in the
diastolic and systolic function (106). Cardiac remodeling,
commonlyachievedthroughhypertrophy,isanattemptto
ensure appropriate output to meet increased demands.
Persistent cardiac remodeling is associated with various
cardiomyopathies including myocardial infarction, ar-
rhythmia, and sudden death (107). Importantly, an in-
creased rate of congenital heart defects in human babies
has been reported in association with maternal proximity
to natural gas development during pregnancy in Colorado
(41), and also has been associated with gestational expo-
sure to EDCs and bioactive polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons (44, 45, 78). Recent work reported increased colla-
gen deposition in female mouse hearts after prenatal and
postnatal exposure to bisphenol A (79). Prenatal expo-
sures to glucocorticoids (108), androgens (109), estro-
gens, and progestins (110) have been associated with in-
creased ventricular hypertrophy. In total, the increased
collagen deposition, heart weights, and cardiomyocyte
sizes in females and/or males after prenatal exposure to
UOG chemicals is suggestive of a programmed change in
the dynamic nature of the ventricle that may result in in-
creased risk of cardiac dysfunction. Future work should
assess functional effects on heart integrity in a more com-
prehensive manner.
A trend for increased splenic weights was noted in the
Mix300andflutamidegroupsatPND21,anendpointthat
has been previously shown with androgen deprivation in
C57Bl/6 mice (111, 112). This was also observed in the
male siblings, and given the antiandrogenic mechanism of
action for the mixture in vitro (57), the similar mechanism
for many in vivo outcomes and for the flutamide control
here, this suggests an antiandrogenic mechanism for this
endpoint.
This was the first study to describe the consequences of
developmental programming by a mixture of UOG chem-
icals in female mice; this work has identified many adverse
endpoints for future, more comprehensive research. In ad-
dition, future research is needed to test the many addi-
tional chemicals used in and produced by this process,
better characterize environmental presence and concen-
trations of these and other contaminants, and assess re-
productive and developmental outcomes via other expo-
sure routes and developmental windows. Exposure may
occur from UOG operations in combination with other
personal and/or industrial sources (as described in Sup-
plemental Table 1). Inhalation and dermal absorption are
also potential routes of exposure to these chemicals and
were not examined in this study. Analytical limitations
havepreventedcompletecharacterizationofall23invivo-
tested chemicals in industry wastewater and community
drinking water, limiting knowledge on realistic environ-
mental concentrations for several constituents of the UOG
chemical mixture used here and for most of the not yet
assessed 1021 other chemicals used throughout this pro-
cess. Given the vast complexity of environmental samples,
in vivo work assessing dilutions of UOG wastewater sam-
ples side-by-side with this laboratory mixture to assess the
relative contribution of various contaminants in adverse
health outcomes should be pursued. Given the pulsatile
nature of several pituitary hormones examined, more
comprehensive hormone assessments over time should be
performed in future studies to better characterize this ap-
parent disruption.
In conclusion, we report for the first time that prenatal
exposure to graded doses of a laboratory mixture of UOG
chemicals at environmentally relevant concentrations can
cause adverse reproductive and developmental health out-
comes in female C57Bl/6 mice. Coupled with previous in
vitro mechanistic data on these chemicals, we further re-
port tentative mechanistic information for the observed
adverse health effects. Our results suggest numerous po-
tential threats to fertility and reproductive success in these
animals, including altered pituitary hormone levels, re-
productive organ weights, and disrupted ovarian follicle
development. Notably, increased body weights, disrupted
heart development, altered hormone levels, and impacted
fertility endpoints were also observed in the male siblings
(57), suggesting similar mechanisms of action. Future
studies should examine fertility and the other adverse end-
points discussed here in a more comprehensive manner,
using both laboratory experiments and epidemiological
studies to better characterize the complex mixtures of
EDCs used in and produced by oil and natural gas oper-
ations and their potential threats to human and animal
health.
