The federal plan for health science and
technology’s response to the opioid crisis:
understanding sex and gender differences
as part of the solution is overlooked

Abstract
The Fast-Track Action Committee on (the) Health Science and Technology Response to the Opioid Crisis recently
released their draft report for public comment. This report provides the “roadmap” for a coordinated federal
research and development response to the opioid crisis. Other than noting the important concerns regarding
maternal and neonatal exposure to opioids, the report overlooks the laboratory, clinical, and epidemiological
data that inform the need for further research on sex and gender differences in opioid addiction that have
critical gender-based treatment and prevention implications. As we embark on research and development,
investigations into the neurobiology of pain, opioid use, and addiction must include both females and males
in model systems and, similarly, psychological and sociocultural investigations must study women and men.
All data should be reported by sex and gender so that gender-specific treatment and prevention strategies
derived from this research are provided to practitioners and the public. We encourage biomedical researchers
and clinical care providers, as well as the public, to insist that a successful response to the opioid crisis should
highlight the importance of understanding sex and gender differences in the current opioid epidemic.

Background
In October 2018, the Fast-Track Action Committee (FTAC)
on (the) Health Science and Technology Response to the
Opioid Crisis released their draft report for public com-
ment. The FTAC committee consisted of staff from United
States governmental units including the National Institutes
of Health, National Science Foundation, Center for Disease
Control, Food and Drug Administration, Office of Science
and Technology Policy, Department of Defense, United
States Department of Agriculture, and other federal agen-
cies impacted by the opioid crisis. According to the report
(https://www.nih.gov/draft-ftac), “The White House Na-
tional Science and Technology Council chartered the Opi-
oid FTAC to support the President’s response to the opioid
crisis by identifying (1) Research & Development (R&D)
critical to addressing key gaps in knowledge and tools, and
(2) opportunities to improve coordination of Federal R&D
essential to combating the opioid crisis.”
This is a critically important report because it provides
the guidance for the federal response to the opioid crisis.
However, essential laboratory, clinical, and epidemiological
data on sex and gender differences in opioid addiction are
overlooked [1]. We assert that the national response
should endorse and encourage sex and gender difference
research and generate coordinated gender-based interven-
tions that can more fully address the opioid epidemic.
As the report documents, the number of prescription
overdose deaths dramatically increased between 1999 and
2016. What the report fails to mention is that women are
more likely than men to be prescribed and use opioid an-
algesics [2]. And, as importantly, there are gender-specific
risk factors for addiction and death from opioid overdoses
[3, 4]. Moreover, over the past 50 years, the number of

 men who are addicted to heroin has been steadily decreas-
ing, while the number of women who are addicted has
been increasing such that the rates for women and men
are now similar [2, 5].
Main text
The biology of pain and opioid addiction is different for
females and males. In research studies with rodents,
most studies on pain have been conducted in males.
When research includes female subjects, sex differences
in the neural systems mediating the responses to pain-
and opioid-related pain reduction are found [6]. There
also are sex differences in the pathways conducting pain
information, the mechanisms through which pain acti-
vates these pathways, the influence of gonadal hormones
on opioid receptor expression, and opioid metabolism—
all of which contribute to opioid-mediated pain reduc-
tion [6]. In summary, these findings show that females
have an attenuated reduction of pain in response to opi-
oids relative to males. This result is mirrored in clinical
research where women have decreased pain reduction
with opioids relative to men [6].
Clinical studies show that for drugs of abuse, the pro-
gression from casual use to addiction occurs more rapidly
for women than men [7, 8]. Women also experience more
negative adverse effects during withdrawal and are more
likely than men to relapse [9]. In preclinical laboratory ex-
periments, female rodents start self-administering opioids
more rapidly than do males, and females find opioids
more rewarding than males [7, 9]. As reviewed in [9], sex
differences in the initial acquisition and intake of opioids
are not due to metabolic differences, but appear to be re-
lated to sex differences in opioid signaling in the brain.
Thus, there are sex differences in the neurological mecha-
nisms mediating the response to opioids that underlie sex
differences in addiction and increase addiction liability in
females relative to males.
The report also advocates the study of “non-biological”
contributions to opioid addiction (quotes added; pg. 5).
In fact, women with opioid use disorder (OUD) are more
likely than men with OUD to have experienced early
trauma, been diagnosed with co-morbid depressive and
anxiety disorders, and reported using opioids to manage
stress as well as pain [10, 11]. Women with OUD also
have greater functional impairment, which affects the cap-
acity to obtain and retain employment and maintain stable
housing (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2017.10.012; [10,
12]). Because most family caregivers are women, such
impairment has a greater adverse effect on children and
families. In addition, neonatal abstinence syndrome is
on the rise as opioid use and addiction increases in
women. Treatment for substance use has historically
engendered greater stigma for women than men; thus,
women have had greater reluctance to seek treatment.
Women also report concern regarding losing custody of
their children if they are identified as abusing substances.
As a consequence, programs that include women-oriented
services such as child care and domestic counseling tend
to show better attendance and outcomes for women [13].
Furthermore, it should be pointed out that any adverse
event resulting in a change in behavior, such as abusing
opioids, induces changes in the brain. Consequently,
while the original etiology of the contribution may be
“non-biological,” adverse events have very real and sub-
stantial biological consequences. For example, childhood
trauma, sexual abuse, or witnessing violence all cause
changes in the brain that contribute to an increased risk
for opioid addiction.
Conclusions
Women suffer chronic pain and disability at greater
rates than men [14, 15], are more likely to be prescribed
opioids, and can become addicted more rapidly than
men. The consequences of addiction are also different
for women and men, with women showing a greater
withdrawal response, more sporadic relapse than men,
and different psychosocial outcomes. We conclude that
sex and gender differences result from the interaction of
biological, psychological, and sociocultural influences,
and consideration of these differences in treatment and
prevention strategies is fundamental to understanding
the causes of and finding solutions to the opioid crisis.
Yet, there is considerable work to be done to understand
how women and men differ in the biology, chemistry, and
experience of pain and distress that precipitates misuse of
and addiction to opioids. Our experimental models will
not begin to yield the desired information until they em-
ploy appropriate models that include both females and
males, and our clinical and epidemiological investigations
will not uncover needed data until both women and men
are studied. A successful response to the opioid crisis will
only be found when scientists, practitioners, and the pub-
lic incorporate the essential importance of understanding
sex and gender differences into the solution for OUD.
