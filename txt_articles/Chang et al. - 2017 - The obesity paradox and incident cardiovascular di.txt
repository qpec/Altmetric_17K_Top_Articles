Abstract
Background
Prior work suggests that obesity may confer a survival advantage among persons with car-
diovascular disease (CVD). This obesity “paradox” is frequently studied in the context of
prevalent disease, a stage in the disease process when confounding from illness-related
weight loss and selective survival are especially problematic. Our objective was to examine
the association of obesity with mortality among persons with incident CVD, where biases
are potentially reduced, and to compare these findings with those based on prevalent
disease.
Methods
We used data from the Health and Retirement Study, an ongoing, nationally representative
longitudinal survey of U.S. adults age 50 years and older initiated in 1992 and linked to Medi-
care claims. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the association
between weight status and mortality among persons with specific CVD diagnoses. CVD
diagnoses were established by self-reported survey data as well as Medicare claims. Preva-
lent disease models used concurrent weight status, and incident disease models used pre-
diagnosis weight status.
Results
We examined myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, and ischemic heart dis-
ease. A strong and significant obesity paradox was consistently observed in prevalent dis-
ease models (hazard of death 18–36% lower for obese class I relative to normal weight),
replicating prior findings. However, in incident disease models of the same conditions in the
same dataset, there was no evidence of this survival benefit. Findings from models using
survey- vs. claims-based diagnoses were largely consistent.

 Conclusion
We observed an obesity paradox in prevalent CVD, replicating prior findings in a population-
based sample with longer-term follow-up. In incident CVD, however, we did not find evi-
dence of a survival advantage for obesity. Our findings do not offer support for reevaluating
clinical and public health guidelines in pursuit of a potential obesity paradox.
Introduction
Though obesity is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) [1], a more recent
and debated literature suggests that obesity may be associated with improved survival once
CVD is established [2–6], a finding that is termed an “obesity paradox”. For example, among
persons with chronic heart failure, a meta-analysis estimates that obesity is associated with
a 33% lower risk of mortality relative to the normal weight category [6]. Risk reductions of
30–40% have also been reported among persons with various types of ischemic heart disease
[3–5].
There are various physiologic pathways by which obesity could confer a protective effect.
Obese patients have more catabolic reserve, and catabolic stress occurs in states such as heart
failure and acute myocardial infarction (MI) [6, 7]. Other potential pathways relate to neuro-
hormonal, inflammatory, and hemodynamic processes. These include obesity-related differ-
ences in tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-10 (IL-10), leptin, sympathetic nervous
system responses, renin-angiotensin responses, the detoxification of lipopolysaccharides, and
circulating atrial natriuretic peptides [6–8]. For example, higher levels of IL-10 among obese
patients may attenuate deleterious inflammatory processes, and receptors that bind TNF-α in
fat tissue could help to decrease the adverse effects of TNF-α.
Despite plausible physiologic explanations for an obesity paradox, prior findings may be
confounded by disease-related weight loss. Disease can lead to both death and weight loss, and
both are a sign of more severe disease. If the normal weight category contains people who have
lost weight because of more severe disease, then the adverse effects of obesity on mortality are
systematically underestimated [9, 10]. Weight loss can be unintentional, due to the disease pro-
cess itself, or intentional, as people with more severe disease may be more motivated to lose
weight. There is also a related, but distinct issue of survivor bias. This would occur if those
who are both obese and have severe disease are more likely to die early, leaving behind a more
robust obese population at the time of study entry. Both of these problems are reduced by
examining persons at the time of an incident, as opposed to prevalent, diagnosis of CVD and
using their pre-diagnosis weight. Most prior work examines prevalent CVD [4–6, 11–23], a
stage in the disease process where these biases are accentuated and especially problematic.
Among studies included in meta-analyses, 95% examine prevalent disease [3–6].
Our objective was to use nationally representative longitudinal data to examine the associa-
tion between obesity and mortality among persons with incident CVD, where biases are
potentially reduced, and to compare findings with those based on prevalent CVD. While prev-
alent disease models rely on concurrent weight status, we can use pre-diagnosis weight status
in incident disease models. This is the first study to compare the use of prevalent to incident
case modeling in the same dataset, which attenuates differences due to variation in data source.
We examined specific types of types CVD (e.g., myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure,
and stroke), and we cross-validated results by comparing diagnoses based on survey self-report
to those based on Medicare claims. Like other recent studies [21, 23] we contribute to prior

 work by examining a population-based sample. Much prior work is based on post-hoc analyses
of clinical trial data [11–15] or single-center studies of patients referred to a subspecialty clinic
(e.g., transplant, cardiac rehabilitation) [16–19] or for cardiac testing and intervention [4, 20].
Clinical trials enroll highly selected samples, and those in a subspecialty clinic differ from the
general population in disease severity and access to care. For example, patients presenting for
transplant evaluation or cardiac rehabilitation are at a more advanced state of disease than
most cases of heart failure in the community. The nature of care delivered in these settings is
similarly selective. Less is known about how findings from such clinical data relate to the
broader U.S. population and longer-term follow-up.
A potential obesity paradox among persons with CVD has important clinical and public
health implications. If obesity actually improves survival in this population, CVD guidelines
recommending weight loss for those who are obese may be having unintended, adverse conse-
quences [24]. Furthermore, national guidelines for the general population have endorsed
weight loss for those who are obese without distinguishing between those with and without
conditions where obesity may in fact be protective [25]. In view of accepting the existence of
an obesity paradox, some have recently proposed replacing the language of “paradox” with
“cardiovascular obesity paradigm” to highlight its standing as an oft-repeated finding [26].
Methods
Data
We used the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which is conducted by the University of Mich-
igan and designed as a nationally representative panel survey of U.S. adults age 50 and over, with
various cohorts entering at specific time points since 1992 [27]. Over 30,000 individuals have
contributed over 175,000 interviews thus far. Interviews are conducted every two years on an
array of health topics and include the use of proxies if respondents are cognitively impaired. We
used ten waves of survey data from 1992–2010 with mortality follow-up through December 31st,
2012. The HRS determines death by family member report and linkage with the National Death
Index. In addition to the survey component, the HRS is linked to Medicare claims, providing
information on both inpatient and outpatient claims-based diagnoses. Many persons are not yet
age 65 (i.e., Medicare-eligible) when they enter the HRS, but become age-eligible over time.
Prevalent and incident diagnoses
We examined the association of weight status with mortality among persons with specific
types of CVD. First, we targeted persons with a prevalent diagnosis and examined whether
findings from prior work suggesting a paradox are replicated. Second, we targeted incident
diagnoses and used pre-diagnosis weight status to reduce bias from illness-related weight loss
and selective survival.
Self-reported diagnoses.
Prevalent disease was based on responses at study entry to indi-
vidual questions about whether a doctor has ever told them that they have specific conditions.
The HRS asks about congestive heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction (“heart attack or
myocardial infarction”), and stroke. The HRS also has a more general heart disease question
on “heart attack, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, or other heart problems”.
Though not as specific, we included analyses based on this category and labeled it “heart dis-
ease”. In all subsequent waves, participants are asked whether a condition has developed since
the previous interview if not previously reported. We defined incident disease at a given wave
using cases that were newly occurring.
Diagnoses based on Medicare claims. We used Medicare claims as an alternate method
for identifying diagnoses and repeated analyses to cross-validate between methods. Analyses

 using claims were limited to persons age 65 and older enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare. As
above, we identified CHF, MI, and stroke. In addition, we identified ischemic heart disease
(IHD) to broaden the analysis beyond MI alone. Having an MI or CHF can be consequences
of IHD, but many with IHD have not had an MI and do not have CHF. Prevalent diagnoses
were identified by searching for claims within the first available two-year claims window using
previously validated and conventional algorithms [28–33]. For persons without claims in this
conventionally used “washout” period, incident diagnoses were identified by searching for
subsequent claims. Incident diagnoses were timed by the date of the first qualifying claim. We
used Medicare data from the denominator, Medicare Provider Analysis and Review, outpa-
tient, carrier, and home healthcare files.
Weight status and covariates
Body mass index (BMI: weight [kg]/height [m2]) from respondent-reported height and weight
was categorized using standard guidelines to allow comparison with prior work: underweight
(BMI <18.5), normal (BMI = 18.5–24.9), overweight (BMI = 25.0–29.9), class I obese (30.0–34.9),
and class II/III obese (BMI � 35.0) [34]. Covariates included sex, race/ethnicity, marital status,
education, household income, household wealth, smoking status, self-rated health, and cohort.
Age was the time scale in survival models. Household income and wealth were modeled as contin-
uous variables adjusted for skew and inflation. Income was log transformed, and wealth was trans-
formed with an inverse hyperbolic sine function. Wealth measured total household assets
accounting for debts and included the value of real estate savings, retirement accounts, and invest-
ments. Other covariates were modeled with indicators for the categories shown in Table 1. The
proportion dropped for missing data in any given model was less than 3%.
Statistical analyses
We used Cox proportional hazard models to examine the association between weight status
and mortality with age in months as the time scale. Respondents who were alive at the end of
the study period were censored, and proportionality assumptions were checked with Schoen-
feld residuals. BMI categories were modeled with indicator variables, and all models adjusted
for the covariates noted above. In order to focus our adjustment on confounding of the BMI
variable, time-varying covariates such as marital status, measures of socioeconomic status,
smoking, and self-rated health were assessed at the same wave as BMI in all of our models. As
the HRS includes spouses, all models adjusted for household clustering with a robust variance
estimator.
We ran separate models for the sample of persons with each of condition of interest. First,
we modeled survival among persons with prevalent disease, replicating the structure of much
prior work in our sample. In models using a survey-based diagnosis, BMI was assessed at the
first HRS interview, which was the same wave used to establish preexisting disease and a preva-
lent diagnosis. When using a claims-based prevalent diagnosis, BMI was assessed at the first
interview following the initial two-year claims window. Second, we modeled survival among
those with an incident diagnosis and used pre-diagnosis weight status. We compared these
models to those based on prevalent diagnoses to assess potential confounding from disease-
related weight loss and survivor bias in the context of prevalent disease. In models using a sur-
vey-based incident diagnosis, BMI was assessed at the wave preceding the wave of diagnosis.
When using a claims-based incident diagnosis, BMI was taken from the most recent interview
that precedes the diagnosis date by at least one year. All analyses were conducted using
STATA version 13.1 statistical software. The New York University Committee on Activities
Involving Human Subjects determined that analysis of the public-use HRS data for this project

 is not considered research with human subjects. Analysis of the HRS-Medicare linked data
used for this project was approved by the University of Michigan Medical School Institutional
Review Board. HRS respondents provided oral informed consent at enrollment and for Medi-
care linkage.
Results
Table 1 shows descriptive characteristics at the initial interview for the overall HRS sample
and persons with a self-reported diagnosis for any of the CVD outcomes. Relative to the overall
sample, persons with prevalent CVD had a higher frequency of underweight and obese class
II/III. They were also older and more likely to be male, not married/partnered, have lower
socioeconomic status, report fair/poor health, and die during the study period.

 Table 2 presents relative hazards of mortality for various BMI categories among those with
CVD diagnoses based on self-reported data. Normal weight is the reference category. Looking
first at the prevalent cases (top panel of table), obese class I had a significantly lower hazard of
mortality relative to normal weight. The estimated hazard reductions were 29% [95% confi-
dence interval: 14%-42%] for MI, 36% [15%-51%] for CHF, 20% [3%-34%] for stroke, and 18%
[8%-27%] for the more general category of heart disease. These findings suggest evidence of an
obesity paradox, and the magnitude of the estimates is in the range of those previously reported
for CVD. Overweight also showed lower mortality in some conditions. In the models for MI,
CHF, and stroke, adjusting for the presence of the other two conditions resulted in minimal
change to the estimates. For example, the hazard ratios (HRs) for obese class I in these models
were 0.72 [0.59–0.87] for MI, 0.66 [0.50–0.87] for CHF, and 0.80 [0.66–0.97] for stroke.
The bottom panel in Table 2 shows models using incident cases and pre-diagnosis weight
for the same conditions. In each of the four conditions, the HR for obese class I was greatly
attenuated (toward the null) compared to its estimate in the corresponding prevalent model,
and in all cases it was no longer statistically significant despite larger sample sizes. Hence,
there was no longer evidence of an obesity paradox when switching from prevalent to incident
models in the same dataset. Overweight remained associated with lower mortality in MI and
heart disease, and obese class II/III was significantly associated with higher mortality in heart
disease.
Table 3 presents cases based on Medicare claims, where diagnoses are based on health pro-
vider coding rather than respondent self-report. The number of cases identified via the two
methods is not directly comparable because claims analyses were limited to persons age 65 and
older. In addition to MI, CHF, and stroke, we were able to capture IHD, which is a diagnosis

 that most persons would not be able to self-report in a survey. Persons with IHD have coro-
nary vessels at risk for an event, but they have not necessarily had such an event.
The top panel of Table 3 shows claims-based prevalent cases. The number of cases for MI
and stroke were low relative to CHF and IHD because they are events that occur at distinct
points in time, whereas the latter two persist. Events are less likely to occur than enduring
states in any two-year window, which is the window conventionally used to establish prevalent
disease in the claims. Here, the prevalent models again suggested a paradox for obese class I.
The estimated hazard reductions were 31% [95% CI: -5%-55%] for MI, 35% [21%-47%] for
CHF, 34% [8%-52%] for stroke, and 18% [7%-28%] for IHD. The finding of a paradox for
obese class I with estimates of similar magnitude in both survey- and claims-based models
lends confidence to each method of disease ascertainment. Though the estimate for obese class
I in MI was only 10% significant in the claims model, the HR (0.69) was similar to the HR in
the survey-based model (0.71), and the sample size was much smaller.
The bottom panel of Table 3 shows the results for claims-based incident cases and pre-diag-
nosis weight status. The HRs for obese class I were greatly attenuated (toward the null) relative
to the prevalent case models and lost significance despite larger sample sizes. In keeping with
the pattern observed for survey-based cases (in Table 2), there was no evidence of an obesity
paradox when switching to models based on incident diagnoses and pre-diagnosis weight.
Reduced hazards for obese class II/III in prevalent MI and prevalent CHF were also attenuated
toward the null and not significant. Overweight remained associated with lower mortality.
In Table 4, we further assessed potential weight loss confounding by excluding deaths
within the first three years of diagnosis in the incident models, as early or more precipitous
deaths can reflect greater disease severity. Here, there was no longer a significant protective
effect for overweight, and all estimates for overweight and both categories of obesity were

 higher, with several showing significantly higher mortality relative to normal weight. Hence,
the protective effect observed for overweight in some of our incident models may have been
due to residual confounding by disease severity. Though dropping early deaths also increased
HRs in prevalent models, many estimates continued to suggest an obesity paradox in the set-
ting of prevalent disease.
Allowing for interactions with sex did not significantly change our results. We also con-
ducted sensitivity analyses where incident cases from the survey were re-examined at a subse-
quent wave as surviving prevalent cases (S1 Table). In our main models, incident and
prevalent cases were, by definition, not the same people. Here, those who survived and inter-
viewed at least two waves after an incident diagnosis wave were re-analyzed using this later
wave–and the BMI at that wave–as the baseline. In this approximation of a prevalent case anal-
ysis, we again observed a lower risk of mortality for obese class I vs. normal weight for each
diagnosis, confirming that timing in the disease process is an important factor.
Discussion
Prior work suggests that among persons with CVD, obese persons, and particularly those with
mild obesity, may have a lower risk of mortality relative to those at normal weight. We exam-
ined prevalent diagnoses as well as incident diagnoses and pre-diagnosis weight for specific
types of CVD. In all conditions we found a consistent pattern: a strong and significant obesity
paradox in prevalent models with substantive attenuation and absence of support in incident
models, despite larger sample sizes. Furthermore, the findings between the self-reported vs
claims-based models were largely consistent, lending confidence to each approach for ascer-
taining diagnoses of CVD.

Obesity paradox in cardiovascular disease

 Prevalent disease is inescapably plagued by disease-related weight loss and selective sur-
vival, both of which can bias findings towards a paradox. The absence of support for a paradox
when switching from prevalent to incident cases and pre-diagnosis weight suggests that preva-
lent models are likely biased by such factors. These findings are in keeping with work on prev-
alent CVD in cross-sectional data finding no evidence for an obesity paradox when the
reference category is restricted to those who have always been normal weight based on recalled
data [21]. Given the widespread use of prevalent case analyses in this literature, the extent of
bias from disease-related confounding in prevalent disease may be underappreciated.
Restricting to incident disease is by no means a complete solution to disease-related weight
loss, as there can be preclinical disease and weight loss prior to receiving a diagnosis. However,
we expect such confounding to be meaningfully reduced relative to sampling on prevalent
cases where the disease has had more time to progress and we only see survivors at a given
time point. Even with potential residual confounding, we found no evidence to suggest an obe-
sity paradox when examining incident CVD and pre-diagnosis weight. This simple and
straightforward adjustment was enough to lose support for an obesity paradox, despite larger
sample sizes. Our conclusions are in keeping with some [35, 36], but not all [37, 38], prior
work on incident MI. Prior work suggesting a protective effect, however, is limited by the
inclusion of underweight in the referent group and a lack of pre-diagnosis weight [37, 38].
Another approach to limit weight loss confounding is excluding early deaths. This and
other exclusions, however, typically result in dropping a very large proportion of deaths and
selects on other unobserved characteristics [39]. Some have argued these deletions may
increase rather than reduce bias [39]. Bearing potential limitations in mind, when we dropped
early deaths, all estimates further moved in the positive direction, suggesting that both classes
of obesity (and overweight in CHF) may be associated with increased mortality in CVD. Fur-
ther restricting the sample to never smokers did not meaningfully change results. While obe-
sity may, in fact, reduce survival in CVD, our primary objective was to examine whether it
might be protective, and, without dropping a large proportion of deaths, we found that this
claim was not supported.
Another explanation for the obesity paradox relates to a form of selection known as collider
bias, though there are inconsistent findings with respect to plausibility [23, 40]. Because obesity
increases the risk of CVD, non-obese persons with CVD are more likely to have other risk factors.
If one or more of these other factors has a stronger effect on mortality than obesity itself, it can
induce a spurious, inverse association between obesity and mortality when conditioning on CVD.
As collider bias would be an issue regardless of whether one is conditioning on incident or preva-
lent CVD, it does not seem to be an obvious explanation for the pattern of changes that we
observe. Importantly, collider bias does not preclude the existence, or co-existence, of other forms
of bias such as weight loss confounding and reverse causality [23], which also merit investigation
and are the focus of this study. As collider bias relates to a potential myriad of unobserved factors
that cannot be accounted for, we cannot rule out its potential influence, and it is possible that the
true estimates for obesity are higher. Accepting this potential underlying influence, however, we
did not have evidence for a protective effect of obesity in incident case models.
This study has limitations. First, BMI was based on self-reported height and weight. Prior
work on the HRS finds that misclassification from the use of these self-reported values does
not significantly bias estimates for the association between obesity and mortality in these data
[41]. Other datasets with measured BMI are either cross-sectional or not nationally representa-
tive. Importantly, the changes we observed in comparing prevalent to incident disease are
unlikely a product of using self-reported BMI.
Second, BMI is an imperfect measure of adiposity. The use of BMI, however, allows for a
comparison of our findings to prior work showing a BMI-defined obesity paradox. Moreover,

 the examination of weight status—as defined by BMI—is of practical relevance. For persons
with CVD, national guidelines have advocated weight loss for those who are obese, as defined
by BMI. As such, it is important to know whether BMI-defined obesity is actually associated
with improved survival. In this sense, one primary goal is not to study body fat per se, but
rather the central measure used in clinical guidelines. BMI is also the only measure routinely
obtained in the clinical setting. Finally, this limitation of BMI is typically raised as a factor can
bias findings toward an obesity paradox, rather than away from a paradox, because lower
weight may be picking up lower muscle mass, which can be associated with lower survival. As
we conclude that there was not evidence of a paradox, this would lend a conservative bias to
our conclusions.
Third, there are limitations to our ascertainment of CVD. The self-reported data risk a poor
understanding of formal diagnoses, recall error, and missed incident cases from death between
surveys. While the claims data are subject to coding error, they offer assessments by clinicians,
and fewer incident cases are missed due to continuous data capture. An advantage of the self-
report data is that it includes persons under age 65. We view these approaches as complemen-
tary, and the consistency of results between them lends strength to our conclusions.
We found that the study of persons with prevalent CVD shows an obesity paradox, replicat-
ing findings from selected, clinical samples in a population-based sample with longer-term
follow-up. However, prevalent disease-related weight loss at the baseline survey is likely a sig-
nificant confounder in this setting. When switching to incident diagnoses of the same condi-
tions and pre-diagnosis weight in the same dataset, we did not find evidence of a survival
advantage for obesity. Our findings do not offer support for reevaluating current clinical and
public health guidelines in pursuit of a potential obesity paradox.
