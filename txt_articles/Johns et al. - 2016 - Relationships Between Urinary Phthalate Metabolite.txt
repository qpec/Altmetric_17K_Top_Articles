Context: Recent research suggests that environmental exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals
may alter circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in humans. To date, no studies have
assessed the associations between phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) and total 25(OH)D in the U.S.
general population.
Objective: To explore relationships between urinary concentrations of 11 phthalate metabolites
and BPA and serum total 25(OH)D in a representative sample of U.S. adults.
Design: A cross-sectional study.
Setting: U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2005–2010.
Patients or Other Participants: U.S. general adult population (aged �20 years).
Interventions: None
Main Outcome Measures: Serum total 25(OH)D measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry.
Results: Metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were consistently inversely associated
with total 25(OH)D in the overall study population and in gender-stratified models. In the overall
population, we detected a significant inverse relationship for the molar sum of DEHP metabolites
(�DEHP), where an interquartile range increase in �DEHP was associated with a 1.90% decrease
(95% confidence interval [CI], �3.64, �0.17) in total 25(OH)D. A positive association was detected
for monoethyl phthalate. For BPA, we found a statistically significant inverse relationship in
women, but not in men. In women, an interquartile range increase in urinary BPA was associated
with a 3.71% decrease (95% CI, �6.41, �1.02) in total 25(OH)D.
Conclusions: Overall, our results provide suggestive evidence that environmental exposure to
phthalates and BPA may alter circulating levels of total 25(OH)D in adults. Future human and
animal studies are required to resolve the direction, temporality, and impact of these relationships.

 I
t is well-established that vitamin D, a fat-soluble pro-
hormone, is essential in maintaining calcium homeo-
stasis and bone health (1). Beyond its skeletal effects, vi-
tamin D has a broad role in human health (2). Vitamin D
receptors have since been found in many organs and tis-
sues, including those of the cardiovascular, digestive, im-
mune,andreproductivesystems(1).InadequatevitaminD
has been implicated in cardiovascular disease, autoim-
mune disorders, cancer, diabetes, and adverse reproduc-
tive outcomes (3, 4).
Numerous factors influence vitamin D status in hu-
mans, including those related to sun exposure (eg, sun-
screen use, latitude, season, etc) as well as race, age,
obesity, and several chronic diseases (5). Recent epidemi-
ological research suggests that environmental exposure to
endocrine-disrupting chemicals may also play a role by
altering levels of the circulating vitamin D metabolite, 25-
hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Data from available hu-
man health studies have shown inverse associations be-
tween levels of 25(OH)D, the biomarker of vitamin D
status in humans, and exposure to certain persistent
organic pollutants such as organochlorine pesticides (6)
and polychlorinated biphenyls (7). Studies assessing the
extent to which other widely used industrial chemicals,
such as phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), influence levels
of 25(OH)D are scarce.
Phthalates and BPA are high-production chemicals
found in numerous industrial and consumer products and
have been detected extensively in the U.S. general popu-
lation (8–10). Both agents are known endocrine disrup-
tors, and they have been shown to alter sex steroid and
thyroid hormone levels at multiple points along these hor-
monal axes, including at the nuclear receptors (11–14).
Because the molecular structure of the active vitamin D
metabolite (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]) is
similar to that of classic steroid hormones (1) and its nu-
clear receptor is within the same superfamily of proteins as
steroid and thyroid hormone receptors (15), it is plausible
that these environmental chemicals may also exert a broad
range of actions on the vitamin D endocrine system (16).
For example, whereas the specific biological mechanisms
remain unknown, phthalates and BPA may influence
25(OH)D levels by acting directly on the vitamin D nu-
clear receptor or on the metabolic activity of enzymes in-
volved in converting vitamin D to its active metabolite.
Similar pathways have been suggested for the actions of
these chemicals on other hormonal systems involved in the
regulation of steroid and thyroid hormones (16–18). In
the only study assessing these associations to date, an in-
verse correlation was observed between serum BPA and
25(OH)D in participants of a study designed to assess
certain risk factors of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
(19). However, this investigation was limited by sample
size, exposure assessment methods, and lack of statistical
consideration for confounding variables in the association
of interest. Similar studies on phthalates have not been
conducted.
Currently, there are no published data on the relation-
ships between phthalate and BPA exposure and circulat-
ing total 25(OH)D in the U.S. general population. Herein,
we investigated these associations in a representative sam-
ple of U.S. adults participating in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2010.
Subjects and Methods
We obtained publicly available data from three cycles of
NHANES (2005–2006, 2007–2008, and 2009–2010), a cross-
sectional study designed to collect health and nutritional data
from a nationally representative sample of the resident civilian
noninstitutionalized U.S. general population (20). All partici-
pants provided informed consent at the time of recruitment. In-
formation regarding methods for survey planning and design are
described in detail elsewhere (21). Of the 17 132 adult partici-
pants aged 20 years and older in cycles 2005–2010, we limited
our study to 4724 men and women who had complete data on all
of the following: urinary phthalate metabolites, urinary BPA,
urinary creatinine, and serum 25(OH)D.
Urinary phthalate metabolites and BPA
Total urinary BPA (free plus conjugated species) and 15 uri-
nary phthalate metabolites were measured in spot urine samples
provided by a random subsample of participants. Samples were
collected at mobile examination centers and were stored at
�20°C until they were shipped to the National Center for En-
vironmental Health, Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), for analysis (22, 23). Urinary BPA concentrations were
measured using solid phase extraction coupled to HPLC (22).
Phthalate metabolites were analyzed using HPLC-electrospray
ionization-tandem mass spectrometry as described in detail else-
where (23). Concentrations below the limit of detection (LOD)
were replaced with the LOD divided by the square root of 2 (24).
In addition to BPA, we included in our analyses 11 phthalate
metabolites for which at least 50% of the study subjects had
concentrations above the LOD: mono-(2-ethyl)-hexyl phthalate
(MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP),
mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-2-
ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP); mono-n-butyl
phthalate (MBP); mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP); mono-ethyl
phthalate (MEP); mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP); mono-(3-car-
boxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP); mono(carboxynonyl) phthalate
(MCNP); and mono(carboxyoctyl) phthalate (MCOP). In addi-
tion to analyzing individual metabolites in statistical analyses,
we created a summary measure of the four metabolites that share
DEHP as their parent compound (MEHP, MEHHP, MEOHP,
MECPP) and thus have common sources of exposure. Specifi-
cally, we calculated the molar sum (nanomoles per milliliter) of
these DEHP metabolites (�DEHP) by dividing each metabolite
concentration by its molecular weight and then summing the
individual concentrations.

 Urinary creatinine was measured using a Jaffe rate reaction
and a CX3 analyzer (Beckman Instruments) (25). In descriptive
analyses, we corrected for urinary dilution by dividing urinary
biomarker concentrations by urinary creatinine (�g/g creati-
nine). We used uncorrected biomarker concentrations in regres-
sion analyses and added urinary creatinine as a covariate because
modeling corrected metabolite levels may introduce bias (26).
Serum vitamin D measurements
Serum samples were collected from all participants at mo-
bile examination centers and stored at �30°C until they were
shipped to the CDC for analysis. In the 2005–2006 survey cycle,
an RIA (DiaSorin) method was used to measure total 25(OH)D
(sumof25-hydroxyvitaminD2and25-hydroxyvitaminD3).The
CDC changed its vitamin D laboratory method in cycles 2007–
2010 to a more analytically accurate assay involving an ultra-
high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectro-
metric (LC-MS/MS) method (27). To facilitate comparisons of
25(OH)D across cycles, the CDC standardized concentrations
of 25(OH)D measured from RIA in previous cycles (including
2005–2006) to predicted LC-MS/MS equivalents using regres-
sion equations described in detail elsewhere (27). Concentra-
tions below the LOD were replaced with the LOD divided by the
square root of 2 (24). No predicted total 25(OH)D LC-MS/MS
equivalents were below the LOD in 2005–2006. For cycles
2007–2010, the CDC used imputed values in the calculation of
total 25(OH)D when 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 concentrations
were below the LOD. No 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 results were
below the LOD.
Covariates
From in-home demographic questionnaire data, we exam-
ined the following as potential confounding variables: age, gen-
der, race/ethnicity, education level, family income to poverty
ratio, and 6-month sampling period (a proxy variable for sea-
son). From examination and laboratory data, we assessed body
mass index (BMI) and serum cotinine, a marker of tobacco
smoke exposure. We also examined past 30-day vitamin D sup-
plement use based on participant responses to dietary supple-
ment questionnaires. We used bivariate analyses to assess the
individual relationships between these variables and total
25(OH)D and urinary biomarkers. Variables were included in
final models based on �10% change in the main effect estimates
when added in a forward stepwise approach.
Statistical methods
From the 4724 participants with exposure and vitamin D
measurements, we excluded participants from multivariable re-
gression analysis who were missing covariates (43 missing BMI,
12 missing serum cotinine, and three missing 30-day dietary sup-
plement use; one participant was missing both BMI and dietary
supplement information). A total of 4667 participants were in-
cluded in final regression analyses.
WeanalyzedalldatausingSASversion9.3(SASInstitute,Inc)
and R version 3.1.1 (The R Foundation for Statistical Comput-
ing). We used the R survey package to appropriately weight
analyses for the complex, multistage sampling design of
NHANES. We applied 6-year weights for the individual prob-
ability of selection into the urinary phenol and phthalate sub-
samples (28). We also included in our weighted analyses cluster
and strata variables from demographic datasets to account for
survey design (29). We considered associations statistically sig-
nificant at the 5% level.
Before the analyses, we used the natural logarithm (ln) to
transform all urinary biomarkers because the individual distri-
butions were right-skewed. The distribution of total 25(OH)D
approximated normality and remained untransformed in statis-
ticalanalyses.Indescriptiveanalyses,weexamineddifferencesin
serum 25(OH)D levels by category of population characteristics
using two-samples t tests and ANOVA. We calculated the geo-
metric means and selected percentiles of weighted, creatinine-
corrected urinary biomarkers to examine the distributions in the
study population.
We used multivariable linear regression models with total
25(OH)D concentrations regressed on each individual urinary
biomarker. Final models were adjusted for ln-transformed uri-
nary creatinine (continuous), age (continuous), gender (male,
female), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Mexican American, other Hispanic, other/mixed race),
BMI (continuous), ln-transformed serum cotinine (continuous),
season (winter months: participants sampled November 1 to
April 30; summer months: participants sampled May 1 to
October 31), 30-day vitamin D supplement use (yes: participant
reportedtakingsupplement(s)thatcontainedvitaminD;no:par-
ticipant reported no dietary supplement use or reported taking
dietary supplement(s) that did not contain vitamin D), and sur-
vey cycle (2005–2006, 2007–2008, 2009–2010).
In addition to investigating associations in the overall popu-
lation, we stratified multivariable regression models by gender
because total 25(OH)D levels were significantly different be-
tween men and women, likely reflecting differences in reproduc-
tive function and/or lifestyle factors that influence sun exposure
(4, 30). To enhance the interpretability, we expressed all regres-
sion coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the per-
centage change (%�) in 25(OH)D associated with an interquar-
tile range (IQR) increase in urinary biomarker concentrations. In
a separate analysis, we examined potential nonlinear associa-
tions between BPA and DEHP metabolites and total 25(OH)D
using quintiles of creatinine-corrected urinary exposure bio-
markers. We performed tests for trend by treating the quintiles
as ordinal variables.
Results
Serum total 25(OH)D concentration significantly differed
by population characteristics (Table 1). Mean total
25(OH)D concentrations were significantly higher in fe-
males than in males, in participants sampled in summer
months compared to winter months, and in those who
reported taking dietary supplements in the past month
that contained vitamin D. All racial/ethnic subgroups had
significantly lower total 25(OH)D compared to non-
Hispanic whites (mean � 71.8 nmol/L), with the lowest
mean concentration reported among non-Hispanic blacks
(mean � 43.4 nmol/L). Mean concentrations of total
25(OH)D were also significantly lower in all BMI cate-
gories compared to those with a normal weight (BMI �
18.5–24.9 kg/m2). The distributions of weighted, creati-
nine-adjusted urinary phthalate metabolites and BPA in

the exception of MEHP (69% � LOD).
DEHP metabolites were consistently inversely associ-
ated with total 25(OH)D in the overall study population
and in gender-stratified models, although the results from
the latter analyses were not statistically significant (Table
3). In the overall study population, we observed the stron-
gest associations for MEHP and MEHHP, where an IQR
increase in these metabolites was associated with a 2.07%
(95% CI, �3.62, �0.52) and 2.09% (95% CI, �3.87,
�0.32) decline in total 25(OH)D, respectively. We also
detected a significant inverse relationship for �DEHP
metabolites (%�, �1.90; 95% CI, �3.64, �0.17). These
inverse associations observed between DEHP metabolites
and 25(OH)D in the overall population persisted after
stratifying analyses by race (eg, non-Hispanic white vs
non-Hispanic black; data not shown). We also observed a
significant positive association between urinary MEP and
total 25(OH)D in both the overall population and in
women alone. For BPA, we found a statistically significant
inverse relationship in women, but not in men (Table 3).
In women, an IQR increase in urinary BPA was associated
with a 3.71% decrease (95% CI, �6.41, �1.02) in total
25(OH)D. We found no statistically significant associa-
tions for any analytes in male-stratified models.

 Discussion
In our analysis of data from NHANES 2005–2010, we
report findings of inverse relationships between DEHP
metabolites and total 25(OH)D. In stratified analyses,
these associations were strongest in women. Urinary BPA
was also inversely associated with 25(OH)D, albeit non-
significantly, in the overall study population. When we
limited the data to women alone, we detected a stronger
and statistically significant inverse relationship. We did
not find a similar association in men.
To date, no human health or animal studies have in-
vestigatedthepotentialassociationsbetweenenvironmen-
tal exposure to phthalates and total 25(OH)D. Currently,
just one study has investigated this relationship with BPA
in humans. Our findings are consistent with those re-
ported by Erden and colleagues (19), who found a sug-
gestive inverse unadjusted correlation between serum BPA
and 25(OH)D in 128 participants (37 females, 91 males)
of a study primarily aimed to investigate the associations
between BPA and 25(OH)D and obstructive sleep apnea
syndrome. However, these results are potentially limited
by the study’s small sample size, the lack of control for
confounding factors in the relationship between BPA and
25(OH)D, and the exposure assessment method used to
measure this polar, nonpersistent compound (ie, in blood
vs urine).
In humans, there are two forms of vitamin D: vitamin
D3 (cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) (31).
These prohormones are produced endogenously by the
skin from sunlight exposure (vitamin D3) and can also be

Phthalates, Bisphenol A, and Vitamin D Levels
J Clin Endocrinol Metab, November 2016, 101(11):4062–4069

 obtained from the diet or supplementation (vitamins D2
and D3) (1, 4, 31). Both forms of vitamin D are inactive
and are hydroxylated hepatically to 25(OH)D, the circu-
lating biomarker of vitamin D status (1, 3, 31). A second
hydroxylation occurs in the kidney, where 25(OH)D is
converted to its active metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D (33). Sim-
ilar in structure and function to other steroid hormones
(eg, estradiol, progesterone, and T), 1,25(OH)2D is trans-
ported to target organs where it binds to its nuclear re-
ceptor to initiate biological responses (1, 15, 31).
There are various potential mechanisms, acting either
directly or indirectly on the vitamin D endocrine system,
that may explain the inverse relationships reported in our
study between DEHP metabolites and BPA and total
25(OH)D. The first entails direct action on the metabolic
pathways involved in the conversion of vitamin D to its
active metabolite (7). The two hydroxylation steps in
vitamin D metabolism are performed by enzymes in the
cytochrome P450 family, including 1�-hydroxylase
(CYP27B1) and 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) (33). Both
DEHP metabolites and BPA have been shown to induce or
inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved
insteroidand/orthyroidhormonemetabolism(17,18,34,
35). BPA also increased the mRNA expression of
CYP27B1 in the kidneys of pregnant mice (36). Thus,
phthalates and BPA may modulate levels of circulating
25(OH)D through their action on this group of enzymes
involved in hormone metabolism. However, additional
animal and in vitro studies are required to establish the
specific actions of these compounds on the enzymes in-
volved in vitamin D metabolic processes and to determine
the extent to which phthalates and BPA alter the activity
of other biological factors directly involved in the vitamin
D endocrine system (eg, binding capacity of vitamin D
transport proteins or actions at the nuclear receptor).
It is also possible that DEHP me-
tabolites and BPA may influence cir-
culating 25(OH)D levels indirectly
through the disruption of calcium
homeostasis, which is largely regu-
lated by vitamin D and estrogen (37).
The main action of the vitamin D
steroid hormone, 1,25(OH)2D, is
to stimulate the absorption of cal-
cium from the gut (38). Levels of
1,25(OH)2D are down-regulated by
its own production as well as serum
concentrations of calcium, whereas
PTH stimulates the renal production
of this active metabolite (1, 38). Sev-
eral animal studies have shown that
BPAmayalterthemRNAexpression
of the calcium binding protein, cal-
bindin-D9k (36, 39), as well as serum calcium levels (36).
However, phthalates had no effect on the expression of
calbindin-D9k in the uterus of immature rats (40), and no
studies have investigated the effects of these compounds
on calcium reabsorption.
We observed positive associations for urinary MEP, the
primarymetaboliteofdiethylphthalate(DEP),intheover-
all study population and particularly in women, which
was somewhat unexpected given previous data showing
inverse associations between this phthalate metabolite
and sex steroid hormones (41, 42). DEP is found in a wide
range of personal care products, including perfumes, hair-
spray, deodorants, and lotions (43). It is possible that par-
ticipants with high use of DEP-containing personal care
products are also more likely to exhibit behaviors that
increase their 25(OH)D levels, which may not have been
captured in the variables of interest in the current study (ie,
leading to residual confounding). Alternatively, it is pos-
sible that MEP may have actions on the vitamin D endo-
crine system that differ from those of DEHP metabolites
and may subsequently result in elevated levels of
25(OH)D. Future research is required to determine the
specific mechanisms by which phthalates may influence
circulating levels of total 25(OH)D and how the actions of
specific phthalate metabolites may differ.
This was the first study to investigate the associations
between phthalates and BPA and total 25(OH)D in the
U.S. general population. Strengths of our study included
our large sample size and population-based data that al-
lowed for the detection of subtle effects between our ex-
posures and outcome of interest. Furthermore, total
25(OH)D concentrations were measured using a LC-
MS/MS method developed by the CDC that is considered
more analytically accurate than immunoassay methods

 (27). Despite these strengths, our investigation was po-
tentiallylimitedbyitscross-sectionaldesignthatprecludes
any conclusions regarding causation. Furthermore, un-
measured or residual confounding and reverse causation
cannot be ruled out as potential explanations of our find-
ings. Additionally, this study included single biomarker
measurements of both the exposures and outcome of in-
terest. NHANES vitamin D data are based on serum sam-
ples preferentially collected in northern states in the sum-
mer and southern states in the winter. Although we
accounted for this 6-month sampling period in our anal-
yses, seasonal variability in total 25(OH)D levels may not
be fully captured in the present study. Moreover, our anal-
yses are based on a single urinary measurement of each
phthalate metabolite and BPA, which have short biolog-
ical half-lives and are quickly excreted from the body;
thus, urinary concentrations fluctuate within the individ-
ual over time and can lead to measurement error (44, 45).
However, we expect this measurement error to be non-
differential with respect to total 25(OH)D concentrations,
thereby biasing our results to the null. Finally, we per-
formed a number of statistical comparisons, and there is
the potential that some of the observed associations may
have been due to chance.
Conclusions
Overall, our results provide suggestive evidence that
environmental exposure to phthalates and BPA may alter
circulating levels of total 25(OH)D in adults. Our strati-
fied analyses showed that some of these associations may
vary by gender. Future human health and animal studies
are required to resolve the direction and temporality of
these relationships, to elucidate the exact mechanisms
through which these compounds may act to disrupt the
vitamin D endocrine system, and to determine the impli-
cations of these findings to public health.
