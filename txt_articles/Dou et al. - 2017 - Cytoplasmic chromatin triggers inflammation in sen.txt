Abstract
Chromatin is traditionally viewed as a nuclear entity that regulates gene expression and 
silencing1–3. However, we recently discovered the presence of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments 
that pinch off from intact nuclei of primary cells during senescence4,5, a form of terminal cell 
cycle arrest associated with pro-inflammatory responses6. The functional significance of 
chromatin in the cytoplasm is unclear. Here we show that cytoplasmic chromatin activates the 
innate immunity cytosolic DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway, leading to both short-term 
inflammation to restrain activated oncogene and chronic inflammation that associates with tissue 
destruction and cancer. The cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway promotes the 
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in primary human cells and in mice. Mice 
deficient in STING show impaired immuno-surveillance of oncogenic RAS and reduced tissue 
inflammation upon ionizing radiation. Furthermore, this pathway is activated in cancer cells, and 
correlates with pro-inflammatory gene expression in human cancers. Overall, our findings indicate 
that genomic DNA serves as a reservoir to initiate a pro-inflammatory pathway in the cytoplasm in 
senescence and cancer. Targeting the cytoplasmic chromatin-mediated pathway may hold promise 
in treating inflammation-related disorders.
Chromatin undergoes global reorganization and degeneration during cellular 
senescence1,5,7–10, a stress response that associates with human diseases including cancer 
and aging6. A hallmark of senescence is loss of the nuclear lamina protein Lamin B17,11,12, 
leading to compromised integrity of the nuclear envelope4,5. Concomitantly, nuclear 
membrane blebs that contain chromatin fragments appear in senescent cells, which 
eventually partition into the cytoplasm to become cytoplasmic chromatin fragments 
(CCF)4,5. CCF contain genomic DNA, γH2AX, and heterochromatin markers H3K9me3 
and H3K27me3, but lack certain euchromatin markers, such as H3K9ac, indicating that CCF 
are derived from transcriptionally repressed heterochromatin regions and involve the DNA 
damage response (DDR)4,5. The transport of genomic DNA to the cytoplasm is unusual, as 
nuclear DNA is regarded as a stable entity that encodes organismal genetic information. 
Whether cytoplasmic chromatin is associated with any biological function is unclear.
Senescence of multiple primary cell types, induced by oncogenic HRasV12, DNA damage, 
or replication exhaustion, exhibits CCF that stain with DAPI, γH2AX, and H3K27me3 (Fig. 
1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). Cytoplasmic DNA, typically a consequence of pathogen 
infection, can be recognized by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS, which produces a second 
messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) that activates STING13,14. The cGAS-STING 
pathway plays essential roles in restraining microbial infection and in triggering 
inflammation15–17. cGAS in proliferating cells displays a diffuse pattern, but coalesces into

 sharp and bright puncta that colocalize with CCF in senescent cells (Fig. 1a and Extended 
Data Fig. 1c–f). cGAS activation, measured by the production of cGAMP, was detected in 
cells transfected with 90-mer double-strand DNA (dsDNA90), and, importantly, in senescent 
cells triggered by various means (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1g). Moreover, STING 
shows hallmarks of activation in senescent cells, including formation of homo-dimers (Fig. 
1c and Extended Data Fig. 1h) and redistribution into aggregates (Extended Data Fig. 1i–j). 
STING activation correlates with induction of CCF and expression of the pro-inflammatory 
gene IL1α (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1k). An alternative source of cytoplasmic 
chromatin in proliferating cells could be chromosome segregation errors, including 
micronuclei18,19. Together, these results indicate that cytoplasmic chromatin in senescence 
signals to the cGAS-STING pathway.
Activation of cGAS-STING leads to two downstream pathways: type I interferon through 
IRF3, and pro-inflammatory responses through NFκB16. Senescence associates with robust 
induction of CCF and pro-inflammatory genes, but not interferon genes (Extended Data Fig. 
2a–e). The failure to induce interferon could be caused by activated p38 MAPK in 
senescence20, as p38 inhibits STING-mediated interferon induction21. p38 inhibitor 
SB203580 potentiates interferon β expression in senescence (Extended Data Fig. 2f). 
Furthermore, the cultured media derived from senescence, particularly IL1α, suppress 
dsDNA90-induced interferon β (Extended Data Fig. 2g–i). The suppression of interferon in 
senescence is consistent with the observation that chronic interferon response can lead to 
activation of immune checkpoints22.
The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines is a key feature of senescence, referred to as 
the SASP6. SASP is able to recruit immune cells, modulate their activity, and alter the tissue 
microenvironment6. The mechanisms that activate SASP involve a series of poorly 
understood events that are connected to the DDR and NFκB23,24. We hypothesized that the 
CCF-cGAS-STING pathway promotes the SASP program.
First, we stably reduced cGAS or STING expression (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a), 
and then induced senescence (Fig. 2b). While disruption of cGAS or STING does not affect 
several markers of senescence (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3b), the activation of key 
SASP factors is greatly compromised (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3c–d). We 
subsequently performed RNA-sequencing in control and cGAS-deficient cells undergoing 
DNA-damage-induced senescence, using two independent biological replicates. Gene 
Ontology (GO) analysis of the top downregulated genes in cGAS-deficient cells revealed 
significant enrichment of the SASP program (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 1, and 
examples shown in Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3e). The global reduction of SASP is 
also presented by a heatmap (Extended Data Fig. 3f). The role of cGAS-STING in 
mediating the SASP was confirmed at the secreted protein level in the conditioned media 
(Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3g–h).
We then asked whether cGAS-STING regulates SASP in established senescence. Following 
senescence establishment, STING or cGAS was inactivated, which does not revert 
senescence, but significantly reduces the expression of SASP genes (Extended Data Fig. 3i). 
By contrast, disruption of IFI16, a disputed cytosolic DNA sensor25, does not suppress

 SASP (Extended Data Fig. 3j–k). Taken together, these results indicate that cGAS-STING is 
required for both induction and maintenance of the SASP program.
We examined the DDR and NFκB pathways that are involved in SASP23,24. Suppression of 
STING or cGAS has little effect on p-ATM S1981, p-p53 S15, γH2AX, senescence-
associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), or CCF in senescent cells (Fig. 2g and Extended 
Data Fig. 4a–b), but greatly compromises the activation of NFκB, as judged by 
phosphorylation of NFκB p65/RelA subunit on Serine 536 (Fig. 2g), nuclear translocation of 
the p65 subunit and its association with promoter regions of pro-inflammatory genes 
(Extended Data Fig. 4c–d). These data connect the cGAS-STING pathway with the NFκB-
mediated SASP program.
We manipulated CCF and investigated the consequences. The generation of CCF is a 
consequence of compromised nuclear lamina integrity, mediated by loss of Lamin B14,5. 
Downregulation of Lamin B1 leads to elevated CCF while overexpression of Lamin B1 
impairs the generation of CCF4,5. Overexpression of Lamin B1 has little effect on the 
induction of γH2AX, p-ATM S1981, and p-p53 S15, but significantly impairs the induction 
of CCF, STING dimer, p65 phosphorylation, and the SASP gene expression (Extended Data 
Fig. 4e–h). In contrast to reducing CCF, exogenous delivery of cytoplasmic DNA or 
chromatin fragments induces cGAS-dependent activation of SASP genes (Extended Data 
Fig. 4i–k). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the CCF-cGAS-STING pathway 
promotes the SASP program in primary human cells.
We subsequently employed wild-type and Sting-null mice15, and exposed these mice to sub-
lethal dose of ionizing irradiation (IR) that induces DNA damage, senescence, and the SASP 
program12,23. This procedure stimulates cGAMP and cytoplasmic chromatin in hepatocytes 
(Extended Data Fig. 5a–b). While IR promotes γH2AX accumulation in the liver of both 
wild-type and the null mice, the induction of IL1α is significantly attenuated in the null 
mice (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5c). Three months after IR, wild-type mice, but not the 
null mice, exhibit massive hair greying (Fig. 3b). Hence, STING mediates DNA damage-
induced SASP and tissue inflammation in vivo.
We also investigated Ras-induced senescence in vivo. A vector with a Sleeping Beauty 
transposon that co-expresses NRasV12 and luciferase, together with a transposase construct, 
was delivered through hydrodynamic injection (Fig. 3c–d), leading to specific and stable 
expression of NRasV12 in hepatocytes. This procedure induces hepatocyte senescence, 
SASP and inflammation, leading to immune-mediated clearance of pre-malignant 
hepatocytes10,26,27. NRasV12, but not the NRasV12/D38A mutant, induces inflammation 
(Fig. 3e top left and Extended Data Fig. 6a), and formation of cytoplasmic chromatin in 
hepatocytes (Extended Data Fig. 6b). While senescence is comparable between wild-type 
and the null liver (Extended Data Fig. 6c–e), the null liver shows attenuated inflammation 
(Fig. 3e top right). Furthermore, the null liver possesses deficient induction of SASP genes 
and accumulation of immune cell markers (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 6f). The 
clearance of NRas-hepatocytes was subsequently examined. While wild-type mice show 
significantly reduced numbers of NRasV12-expressing cells from day 6 to day 12, the null 
mice fail to do so (Fig. 3e). Using the luciferase reporter co-expressed with NRasV12 (Fig.

 3c), we found that wild-type mice show gradual reduction of luciferase luminescence in the 
liver, whereas the luciferase activity persists in the null mice (Fig. 3g). Impaired clearance of 
NRasV12-hepatocytes can lead to malignancies26. Eight months following the injection, 
intrahepatic tumors positive for NRas were observed in the null mice but not in the wild-type 
mice (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 6g). The role of STING in this model was confirmed 
by re-expression of STING in the null liver, which results in restoration of cytokine 
expression, inflammation, and immune-mediated clearance (Extended Data Fig. 7a–e). 
Taken together, these results demonstrate that STING in vivo is essential for Ras-induced 
SASP and immuno-surveillance.
While senescence and short-term inflammation is a potent barrier to tumorigenesis, 
persistent inflammation is associated with tissue damage, and in established cancers, is 
linked to tumor growth and metastasis6. Since cancers frequently contain extra-nuclear 
chromatin18,19 and depend on NFκB for inflammation24, we investigated the role of 
cytoplasmic chromatin in pro-inflammatory responses in cells that evade senescence (either 
bypassing initiation of senescence or by escape after induction of senescence) and in human 
cancers in general.
To study senescence evasion, we first induced senescence of IMR90 cells by HRasV12, 
which were then either left untreated (termed as OIS’ed), or were immortalized by stable 
expression of SV40 large T antigen and hTERT (termed as OIS-evaded) (Fig. 4a–b). 
Although the OIS-evaded cells show loss of SAHF, they retain an elevated DDR, 
cytoplasmic chromatin that strongly colocalize with cGAS (Fig. 4c–d, and Extended Data 
Fig. 8a), and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, mediated by the cGAS-STING 
pathway (Fig. 4e–f, and Extended Data Fig. 8b–c). These observations suggest that in 
transformed cells, the cytoplasmic chromatin-mediated pathway remains activated, and 
hence prompted us to investigate cytoplasmic chromatin in human cancers.
Although cancer cells may arise from various mechanisms, we found that cytoplasmic 
chromatin is present in multiple cancer cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 8d–e), consistent with 
studies showing nucleus-to-cytoplasm transport of nuclear DNA in cancer cells18,19. We 
discovered that cytoplasmic chromatin in the investigated cancer cells stains positive for 
DAPI and γH2AX, colocalizes with cGAS, and is negatively regulated by Lamin B1 
(Extended Data Fig. 8d–f). Moreover, the expression of pro-inflammatory genes is regulated 
by cGAS, STING, and Lamin B1 (Extended Data Fig. 8g and Supplementary Table 2), 
similar to that of senescent cells. Furthermore, analyses of ten breast cancer cell lines 
revealed that cytoplasmic chromatin associates with the expression of pro-inflammatory 
genes (Extended Data Fig. 8h and Supplementary Table 3).
To robustly examine the connection between cytoplasmic chromatin-mediated pathway and 
pro-inflammatory gene expression in cancers at a larger scale, we exploited the cancer cell 
line encyclopedia (CCLE) that contains RNA-sequencing datasets for over 1,000 cell lines28. 
Cancer cells with the lowest ¼ and highest ¼ of STING expression were grouped, and the 
expression of key pro-inflammatory genes were compared between the STING-low and 
STING-high subsets (Fig. 4g). This analysis revealed that higher STING expression is 
linked to significantly higher expression of pro-inflammatory genes, while interferon genes

 and the house-keeping gene GAPDH do not follow this pattern (Fig. 4g top and Extended 
Data Fig. 9a top). A similar trend is also observed with cGAS (Extended Data Fig. 9b). In 
contrast, Lamin B1, but not Lamin A/C, shows strong negative association with the pro-
inflammatory genes (Fig. 4g bottom and Extended Data Fig. 9a, c), consistent with the 
observations that Lamin B1, but not Lamin A/C, regulates cytoplasmic chromatin-mediated 
pathway4,5. The association of pro-inflammatory gene expression is specific to the cytosolic 
DNA sensing pathway, because MAVS, a protein involved in cytosolic RNA sensing 
pathway, does not show this association (Extended Data Fig. 9d).
Furthermore, we exploited the RNA-sequencing database of human cancers from the cancer 
genome atlas (TCGA), and again found that STING is significantly linked to the expression 
of pro-inflammatory genes in multiple cancers, including but not limited to pancreatic 
cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, and breast cancer, while MAVS does not follow this 
pattern (Extended Data Fig. 10a–d and Supplementary Table 4).
Collectively, these data suggest that the cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway is 
involved in expression of pro-inflammatory genes in cancer cells that evade senescence and 
in broad scenarios of human cancers in general.
In conclusion, this study establishes a functional role of cytoplasmic chromatin in mediating 
inflammation in senescence and cancer. This view suggests that genomic DNA not only 
carries central genetic information, but can also serve as a cytoplasmic “danger signal” to 
alarm the immune system in coping with aberrant cellular activities. While clearly a short-
term advantage in promoting immuno-surveillance of malignancies, this machinery may 
have a long-term destructive potential in creating genomic instability and in mediating tissue 
damage. While this manuscript was in revision, two related findings appeared and 
collectively support an essential role of the cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway 
in mediating the SASP29,30. We envision that the cytoplasmic chromatin phenomenon may 
be involved in many biological processes beyond the current investigation.
Methods
Cell culture and treatment
Primary IMR90 and BJ fibroblasts were described previously and were authenticated by 
genome-wide sequencing analyses5,7. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin 
(Invitrogen), and were intermittently tested for mycoplasma. The cells were cultured under 
physiological oxygen (3%), and were used within population doubling of 35, except for 
replicative senescence experiments. For etoposide-induced senescence, IMR90 cells at ~60–
70% confluency were treated with 100 uM etoposide for 48 h. The media were then replaced 
and cells were harvested at Day 7. For BJ cells, 40 uM etoposide were added to the culture 
media throughout the treatment. IMR90 stably expressing ER:HRas was described 
previously5. Senescence-associated β-galactosidase was performed as previously 
described5,31. dsDNA90 was described elsewhere32, and transfected using lipofectamine 
2000; transfected cells were harvested 1 day post transfection for analysis of interferon β 
and 4 days for pro-inflammatory cytokines.

 Mice experiments
STING+/+ and STING−/− mice in C57BL/6 background were described elsewhere15. Mice 
were fed ad libitum on a regular diet, and all procedures were approved and performed 
following institutional regulations and guidelines (University of Pennsylvania and University 
of Glasgow). Both sexes were included in the study. Hydrodynamic tail vein injection was 
performed as previously described33. Briefly, 20 ug of NRasV12/luciferase and 10 ug of 
transposase constructs were injected to mice that are 8 to 12-week-old in Ringer's solution 
that corresponds to 10% of the body weight (e.g., 2.0 ml for a 20 g mouse, but not over 2.5 
ml if the mouse is more than 25 g) within 6 s. Mouse Sting cDNA was purchased from 
Origene and was cloned into the NRas/IRES/luciferase vector. All constructs were verified 
by DNA sequencing. For in vivo luciferase imaging, luciferin was intraperitoneally injected 
to mice at 150 mg/kg body weight. The mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and imaged 
under an IVIS Spectrum imager every minute for a duration of 15 min. Images with peak 
signals were used for data analyses. Identical parameters were used for longitudinal study 
and for comparisons between the two cohorts of mice. For ionizing radiation, mice were 
subjected to a sub-lethal dose of 4 Gy irradiation, and were harvested 7 days post the 
procedure for IHC studies. Presented images of mice post IR are representative of no less 
than five mice per condition. Isolation of primary hepatocytes is described elsewhere33. 
Liver tumor studies were performed following institutional regulations and guidelines 
(University of Pennsylvania, animal protocol #805175). A maximal loss of 20% of body 
weight is considered as an endpoint. None of the experiments exceeded the limit. 
Immunohistochemistry was performed using standard procedure at the institutional 
histology core facilities and was scored in a double-blinded manner.

 was filtered through a 0.45-µm filter, supplemented with 8 µg/ml polybrene, and mixed with 
trypsinized recipient cells. The infected cells were then selected with puromycin or 
hygromycin.
pLKO-based shRNA was from Sigma. The following shRNA were used:
STING (TRCN0000163296: GCCCGGATTCGAACTTACAAT and 
TRCN0000161345: GTCCAGGACTTGACATCTTAA), cGAS (TRCN0000149984: 
CAACTACGACTAAAGCCATTT and TRCN0000128706: 
CGTGAAGATTTCTGCACCTAA), IFI16 (TRCN0000364688: 
GGAAACTCTGAAGATTGATAT and TRCN0000364735:

CCAGGGAAGAACTGATGGAAA and TRCN0000029271: 
GCATGAGAATTGAGAGCCTTT).
Immunoblotting
Western blotting was described previously5, with slight modifications. Cells were lysed in 
buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 1% SDS, 
supplemented with 1:100 Halt Protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo 
Scientific). The lysates were briefly sonicated, and supernatants were subjected to 
electrophoresis using NuPAGE Bis-Tris precast gels (Life Technologies). For p-ATM S1981 
blotting, cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM 
CaCl2, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, supplemented with 1:100 Halt protease and phosphatase 
inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific) and benzonase (Novagen) at 12.5 U/ml. The lysates 
were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and supernatants were loaded. For immunoblotting of STING 
dimer, reducing reagent was not added to the lysates before loading. After transferring to 
nitrocellulose membrane, 5% milk in TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) was 
used to block the membrane at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in 
5% BSA in TBST, and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was washed 3 times with 
TBST, each for 10 min, followed by incubation of HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies at 
room temperature for 1 h, in 5% milk/TBST. The membrane was washed again 3 times, and 
imaged by films or by a GE Amersham Imager 600.
Immunofluorescence and quantification
Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously5. Briefly, cells were fixed in 
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with 
PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After washing two 
times, cells were blocked in 10% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then 
incubated with primary antibodies in 5% BSA in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 
(PBST) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the cells were washed four times with PBST, each 
for 10 min, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (Life 
Technologies), in 5% BSA/PBST for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed 
four times in PBST, incubated with 1 µg/ml DAPI in PBS for 5 min, and washed twice with 
PBS. The slides were mounted with ProLong Gold (Life Technologies), and imaged with 
Leica TCS SP8 fluorescent confocal microscope. Quantification of % positive cells of 
SAHF, p-ATM, IL8, γH2AX, and p65 was done under identical microscopy settings

 between samples. Cells with over 5 visible spots at the expected location were considered 
positive. Over 200 cells from 4 randomly-selected fields were analyzed.
RT-qPCR
mRNA from cells or tissues were extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), with a DNase I 
(Qiagen) digestion step to minimize genomic DNA contamination. Reverse transcription 
(RT) was done using High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (ThermoFisher), and then 
quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the 7900HT Fast-Real-Time PCR platform 
(ABI). Results were normalized to GAPDH for human cells.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
ChIP was described previously5 with slight modification. Cells were crosslinked with 1% 
formaldehyde diluted in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. After glycin quenching, the cell 
pellets were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 0.1% 
SDS, supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific), and 
sonicated with a Covaris sonicator, resulting in chromatin fragments of 250 bp average size. 
The supernatant was diluted 10 times with the above buffer without SDS, and subjected to 
immunoprecipitations with 1 ug of p65 antibody or control IgG conjugated with Dynabeads 
Protein A (Invitrogen) at 4 °C for overnight. The beads were then washed 4 times with 
buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, and 1 time with final wash 
buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl), followed by elution with 
incubation of elution buffer (final wash buffer plus 1% SDS) at 65 °C for 30 min with 
agitation in a thermomixer. The ChIP and input were then purified and used for qPCR 
analysis. The following primers were used for qPCR of gene promoter regions:
IL8: CCACCGGAAGGAACCATCT, GGCCAGCTTGGAAGTCATGT;
IL6: CACCTGGAGACGCCTTGAAG, TGCCTGGCCATCCTCAAAT;
MMP3: TGGATTTGCTGGTTCTTGAGG, TTTGTTCTATTCTGCCCATGAGG;
β-actin: CTGGGTTTTATAGGGCGCC, AAGTTGCCTTTTATGGCTCGAG.
RNA-sequencing
RNA-seq was performed as previously described7,8 with modifications. Total RNA was 
isolated from IMR90 cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and 1 ug of RNA was used as input in 
the Scriptseq Complete kit (Epicentre). Briefly, total RNA was ribo-depleted using a 
Ribozero magnetic protocol (Epicentre). The ribo-depleted RNA was then ethanol-
precipitated, fragmented, and tagged at both ends for stranded library preparation, using the 
Scriptseq v2 library preparation protocol. The PCR amplification step was used to index the 
libraries and multiplexed libraries were quantified by Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and qPCR 
(Kapa Biosystems). The RNA-seq run was performed on the NextSeq 500 platform 
(Illumina).
Single-ended, 75 bp reads were mildly trimmed using Trimmomatic (version 0.32) to 
remove leading or trailing nucleotides whose sequencing quality was below 3. Reads whose 
length fell below 30 bp after trimming were also removed from downstream analysis. STAR 
(version 2.3.0e) was used for mapping reads to reference genome (hg19), requiring a 
minimum alignment score of 10. The expression level of RefSeq genes was quantified using 
featureCounts (version 1.5.0) and normalized using DESeq2.

 Gene expression of RNA-seq data were compared in log2-CPM (i.e. log2 read per million 
mapped reads) as reported by DESeq2. The average log2-CPM values were used for 
biological replicates. Genes with over three fold change in expression between etoposide-
treated sh-NTC and sh-cGAS were uploaded to DAVID for GO analysis. Genes contributed 
to the top four down-regulated GO terms were combined with known SASP genes34 for 
heatmap visualization, where expression of each gene was scaled to between 0 and 1 based 
on its minimum and maximum values in proliferating, etoposide-treated sh-NTC and sh-
cGAS. SASP genes that are induced less than three-fold (comparing etoposide-treated sh-
NTC and proliferating) and those that are not induced in IMR90 DNA damage conditions34 
are not included for the heatmap.
RNA-sequencing data were uploaded to GEO under accession number GSE99028.
Secreted cytokine analysis
For western and cytokine-array analysis of secreted cytokines, cells were cultured in serum-
free media for 24 h. The cultured media were then collected, and the cell numbers were 
counted for normalization. The media were filtered with a 0.45 µm PVDF filter (Millipore) 
to remove cells and debris. The resulting supernatant was further concentrated with a 3kDa 
Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL centrifugal filter (Millipore), and was subjected to immunoblotting of 
IL8 or cytokine-array assay (RayBiotech, Human Cytokine Array C1) following 
manufacturer’s guidelines. The intensities of array dots were quantified with Fiji and were 
normalized against the positive controls on the blots.
Chromatin fragment extraction and transfection
Extraction of chromatin fragments was described previously35 with modifications. Briefly, 
proliferating IMR90 cells were incubated with hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 30 
mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP40), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail, on ice 
for 10 min. The cells were then centrifuged at 300 g, 4 °C, for 3 min. The supernatant was 
carefully removed, and the resulting pellets were incubated with benzonase buffer (50 mM 
Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 2.5 mM MgCl2) with protease inhibitor cocktail, 
supplemented with 10 U of benzonase, on ice, for 30 min. The product was centrifuged 
again at 300 g, 4 °C, for 3 min, and benzonase was inactivated by addition of 15 mM EDTA. 
The resulting supernatant contains chromatin fragments and soluble nuclear proteins. The 
product was then diluted 5 times with PBS. As a control, buffer without benzonase was 
used, which yielded soluble nuclear proteins but no chromatin fragments. The chromatin 
fragments or the control were transfected to proliferating IMR90 cells using lipofectamine 
2000. Successful transfection was confirmed by immunofluorescence with an H3 antibody 
and DAPI. Transfected cells were harvested 4 days post transfection, and were analyzed by 
RT-qPCR for cytokine production.
2’3’-cGAMP detection by LC-MS/MS
cGAMP extraction was performed as reported by Chen et al36, with slight modifications. 
IMR90 cells were cultured in 10 cm dishes, and the culture media were removed and 
replaced with 2 ml 80:20 methanol:water. The dishes were incubated at −80 °C overnight, 
and cells were scraped, subjected to 2 vortex, freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, and

 sonicated in a Bioruptor sonicator in ice water bath. The product was clarified by 
centrifugation at 21,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was concentrated by a 
SpeedVac concentrator and subjected to sample clean-up and LC-MS analysis. For mouse 
hepatocytes and liver, tissues were homogenized in 80:18:2 methanol:water:acetic acid, and 
were processed similarly as afore-mentioned. The pellets from the centrifugation step were 
dissolved in 1% SDS followed by sonication, and the concentration of proteins were 
measured by Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit, allowing normalization to total proteins.
Dried supernatants were re-suspended in 50 µL 0.1% acetic acid and subjected to solid phase 
extraction. Briefly, the bottom of a P200 pipette tip was sealed with a small disk of C18 
material (Millipore). To the pipette tip, 200 µL of phenyl-hexyl resin (5 µm, 100 Å, 
Phenomenex) resuspended in acetonitrile was added. A centrifuge adaptor was used to hold 
stage-tips in place in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. The resin was flushed with 50 µL of 
acetonitrile by slow centrifugation. The resin was then equilibrated with 50 µL of 0.1% 
acetic acid and samples were loaded onto the equilibrated resin. Samples were washed once 
with 0.1% acetic acid and eluted into a clean microcentrifuge tube by flushing 50 µL of 
20 % acetonitrile with 0.1 % formic acid twice. Samples were collected, dried in a SpeedVac 
concentrator and resuspended in 0.1 % formic acid for LC-MS analysis.
LC-MS analysis was carried out using an EASY-nLC nano HPLC (Thermo Scientific) 
coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), equipped with a 
nano-electrospray source. Ionization source parameters were optimized using a 2’3’- 
cGAMP standard (InvivoGen) and set to: positive mode; capillary temperature, 275 °C; 
spray voltage, 2.3kV. Analytes were separated on an in-house analytical column (150 µm ID, 
370 mm length) packed with a phenyl-hexyl resin 5 µm, 100 Å (Phenomenex). The mobile 
phases were 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (B). 
Analytes were eluted using the following gradient: 0 – 20% B in 20 min, 20 – 98% B in 5 
min and maintained over 10 min at 600 nL/min. The mass spectrometer was set to perform a 
full MS scan (300 – 700 m/z) in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000 (at 200 m/z), 
followed by targeted MS/MS scans of the precursor ion of cGAMP (m/z = 675.10 [M + 
H]1+). Fragment ions were scanned from 185 – 700 m/z. All MS/MS scans were performed 
in the orbitrap mass analyzer (15,000 resolution) using HCD fragmentation (collision energy 
= 25), and an isolation window of 1.0 m/z. Maximum injection times of 50 and 100 ms were 
defined for MS and MS/MS scans, respectively. AGC values were set to 5 × 105 for MS and 
5 × 104 for MS/MS. MS data were collected in profile mode and MS/MS data were collected 
in centroid mode.
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) analyses
The results of TCGA were based upon data generated by the TCGA Research Network: 
http://cancergenome.nih.gov. For TCGA analyses, RNA sequencing datasets were obtained 
from cBioportal (www.cbioportal.org). For a given cancer type, tumor samples were ranked 
based on their targeted gene expression values, and were evenly divided into four groups 
accordingly. Statistical comparisons were then performed between the first group (samples 
with the lowest 25% expression) and the last group (samples with the highest 25% 
expression) for inflammatory genes or the house-keeping gene (GAPDH), as denoted.

 Similarly, for analyses of the CCLE samples, RNA sequencing datasets were obtained from 
the Broad Institute data portal (www.portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle/home). The samples 
were ranked as described above for TCGA samples, and likewise, comparisons were carried 
out between the first group and the last group for inflammatory genes or GAPDH. For box 
plots displayed in this study, the central rectangle spans a range from the first quartile to the 
third quartile (this range is also known as the interquartile range, IQR). A line inside the 
rectangle shows the median. Outliers were defined as data points that are either 1.5×IQR or 
more above the third quartile or 1.5×IQR or more below the first quartile. If either type of 
outlier is present, the whisker on the appropriate side is taken to 1.5×IQR from the quartile 
rather than the maximum or minimum. Outliers were not displayed in the box plots, but all 
data points were included in P-value calculations. One-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test were 
used to compute statistical significance. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
General statistical analyses
Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test was used for comparison between two groups. One-way 
ANOVA coupled with Tukey’s post hoc test was used for comparisons over two groups. All 
bar graphs show mean values with error bars (s.d. or s.e.m., as defined in figure legends), 
unless specified otherwise. 95% confidence intervals were used, and significance was 
considered when p value was less than 0.05.
