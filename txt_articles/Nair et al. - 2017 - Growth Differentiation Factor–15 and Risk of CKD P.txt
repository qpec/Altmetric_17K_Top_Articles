ABSTRACT
Growth differentiation factor–15 (GDF-15) is a member of the TGF-b cytokine superfamily that is widely
expressed and may be induced in response to tissue injury. Elevations in GDF-15 may identify a novel pathway
involved in loss of kidney function among patients with CKD. Among participants in the Clinical Phenotyping
and Resource Biobank (C-PROBE) study and the Seattle Kidney Study (SKS), we tested whether kidney tissue
expression of GDF15 mRNA correlates with circulating levels of GDF-15 and whether elevations in circulating
GDF-15 are associated with decline in kidney function. In matching samples of 24 patients with CKD from the
C-PROBE study, circulating GDF-15 levels significantly correlated with intrarenal GDF15 transcript levels
(r=0.54, P=0.01). Among the 224 C-PROBE and 297 SKS participants, 72 (32.1%) and 94 (32.0%) patients,
respectively, reached a composite end point of 30% decline in eGFR or progression to ESRD over a median of
1.8 and 2.0 years of follow up, respectively. In multivariable models, after adjusting for potential confounders,
every doubling of GDF-15 level associated with a 72% higher (95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 4.45; P=0.003)
and 65% higher (95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.50; P=0.02) risk of progression of kidney disease in
C-PROBE and SKS participants, respectively. These results show that circulating GDF-15 levels strongly cor-
related with intrarenal expression of GDF15 and significantly associated with increased risk of CKD progres-
sion in two independent cohorts. Circulating GDF-15 may be a marker for intrarenal GDF15-related signaling
pathways associated with CKD and CKD progression.

 Progression of kidney disease to ESRD is a major complication
of CKD. The pathogenesis of progression of CKD is complex,
and likely characterized by a constellation of pathologic fea-
tures, including tubular atrophy and fibrosis, that progress
independent of the primary cause of CKD. The discovery of
biomarkersthatidentifynewbiologicpathwayscontributingto
kidney disease progression is important.
Growth differentiation factor–15 (GDF-15) is a member of
the TGF-b cytokine superfamily whose expression is in-
creased in response to tissue ischemia, neurohormones,
and other proinflammatory cytokines.1–3 Several studies
have found a link between elevated levels of GDF-15 and car-
diovascular injury in humans.4–8 It is also plausible that
GDF-15 could signal intrarenal injury, either from a system
process (e.g., cardiovascular disease) or an intrarenal patho-
physiology. Few studies have examined the association of
GDF-15 with progression of kidney disease. One study
reported a significant association between elevations in
GDF-15 and development of incident CKD, rapid decline
of kidney function, and albuminuria among participants in
the Framingham study.9 This study was limited to partici-
pants without CKD at study entry and thus did not study the
CKD population, who are at the greatest risk of adverse kid-
ney consequences.
Between two well characterized longitudinal cohorts of
CKDpatients(theClinicalPhenotypingandResourceBiobank
[C-PROBE] study and the Seattle Kidney Study [SKS]), we
examined the association of circulating GDF-15 with intrarenal
gene expression of GDF15 and with longitudinal progression of
CKD. We hypothesized that elevation in serum GDF-15 would
correlate with intrarenal tissue GDF15 expression and also be
independently associated with loss of kidney function among
CKD patients.
RESULTS
Characteristics of Study Populations
Mean ages of the participants from C-PROBE and SKS were 58
and 62 years, respectively. There were more women and black
participants in C-PROBE compared with SKS: 60% versus
17%, and 41% versus 25%, whereas diabetes was more com-
mon in SKS (56% versus 39% in C-PROBE). Mean eGFR was
39.4 and 41.8 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and median urine ACR
was 135 and 287 mg/g, for SKS and C-PROBE respectively. In
C-PROBE and SKS, participants in the highest quartile of
GDF-15 were more likely to be older, have higher prevalence
of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, higher systolic BP,
lower eGFR, and higher urine ACR (Table 1).
Correlation of Plasma GDF-15 with Intrarenal
Expression of GDF15 in C-PROBE
In the C-PROBE cohort, 24 patients had matching plasma
samples and gene expression data derived from kidney
biopsy samples. We observed a significant inverse correlation
between tubulointerstitial GDF15 mRNA expression with
eGFR (r=20.47, P=0.02) (Figure 1A). The tubulointerstitial
GDF15 mRNAwas strongly and positively correlated with cir-
culating GDF-15 protein (r=0.54, P=0.01) (Figure 1B).
Association of Circulating GDF-15 with 30% Decline in
eGFR or Progression to ESRD in C-PROBE and SKS
In C-PROBE, the median follow-up time was 1.8 years with a
median of two follow-up eGFR measures. In SKS, the median
follow-up time was 2.7 years with a median of four follow-up
eGFR measures. In C-PROBE, 72 (32.1%) participants pro-
gressed to the composite end point (23 developed ESRD and 49
had a 30% decline in eGFR). In SKS, 94 (32.0%) participants
progressed to composite end point (27 developed ESRD and
67 had a 30% decline in eGFR). Incidence rates for adverse
kidney outcomes were higher among participants with greater
concentrations of GDF-15 (Table 2). After adjustment for de-
mographics, kidney function, and comorbidity, GDF-15
was significantly associated with greater risk of 30% de-
cline in eGFR or ESRD. Participants in the highest quartile
of GDF-15 (versus the lowest quartile) had greater than three-
fold in C-PROBE (hazard ratio, 3.25; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 1.26 to 8.36) or two-fold increased risk in SKS
(hazard ratio, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.15 to 5.72) of 30% decline in
eGFR or progression to ESRD. Every doubling of GDF-15 was
significantly associated with 72% (95% CI, 21% to 445%) or
65% (95% CI, 8% to 250%) greater risk of 30% decline in
eGFR or progression to ESRD in C-PROBE and SKS, respec-
tively (Table 2).
Association of Circulating GDF-15 with Annualized
Relative Change in eGFR in C-PROBE and SKS
In both C-PROBE and SKS, participants with higher GDF-15
had greater risk of longitudinal decline in eGFR (Table 3).
Across quartiles of baseline GDF-15, there was a graded in-
crease in annual decline in eGFR in univariate and multivar-
iable models. Participants in the highest quartile of GDF-15
had a decline of 11.82% (95% CI, 0.8 to 21.61) per year in
C-PROBE and a decline of 5.83% (95% CI, 0.13 to 11.53) per
year in SKS. Every doubling of GDF-15 was associated with a
5.84% (95% CI, 1.84 to 9.68) and 3.01% (95% CI, 0.74 to
5.29) decline in eGFR per year in C-PROBE and SKS, respec-
tively (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In this study of two independent, well characterized CKD
cohorts, we found intrarenal GDF15 expression in the
tubulointerstitial compartment of patients with CKD is re-
flected by circulating GDF-15 levels, which are significantly
associated with disease progression, as defined by continuous
decline of eGFR or reaching a composite end point of 30%
decline in eGFR or progression to ESRD, independent of
other risk factors for progression of kidney disease, including

 urine ACR. These findings suggest that GDF-15 is not only a
CKD risk factor and outcome marker but a direct participant
in the disease process in the kidney. Whereas previous studies
have reported an important link between elevated GDF-15
concentrations and cardiovascular disease,4–8 few have fo-
cused on kidney outcomes. In a study conducted among
Framingham participants, every log increase in GDF-15 was
associated with increased, almost two-fold greater odds of
incident CKD and rapid decline of kidney function.9 In a
study of type 1 diabetic patients with nephropathy, elevated
GDF-15 was associated with more rapid decline in eGFR but
not progression to ESRD.10 In two recent analyses of patients
undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery, preoperative
elevated GDF-15 was associated with postoperative AKI.11,12
Our study supports and extends the findings of these previous
studies by studying participants with CKD of various causes
in two independent CKD cohorts. GDF-15 may be a novel
biomarker to identify patients with CKD at the highest risk of
CKD progression. Furthermore, our study noted a significant
correlation between intrarenal GDF15 mRNA and plasma
GDF-15. These findings suggest, for the first time, that intra-
renal GDF15 mRNA, which is reflected by circulating levels of
GDF-15, may be related to CKD progression.
GDF-15 is a member of the TGF-b cytokine superfamily
that is widely expressed in cardiomyocytes, adipocytes,
macrophages, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle
cells and may reflect an early response protein induced after
tissue injury.3 In the heart, GDF-15 expression activates path-
ways responsible for cardioprotection.1–3 In a study of rat
ventricular cardiomyocytes, GDF-15 expression increased
3 hours after ischemia.13 In GDF-15 knock-out mice, cardiac
infarct area was larger compared with wild-type mice, sup-
porting the hypothesis that GDF-15 activates cardioprotec-
tive pathways.13
Preclinical studies show significant protective effects of
GDF-15 in the kidney as well. In mouse models of type 1 and
type 2 diabetes, GDF-15 knock-out mice displayed increased
tubular damage, with evidence of glucosuria and polyuria,
as well as increased interstitial damage,
as indicated by increased a-smooth muscle
actin staining and collagen type 1 expres-
sion. Increased expression of GDF15
mRNA in outer medullary collecting
duct cells has been reported during meta-
bolic acidosis14 and potassium depletion,15
and both are associated with reduced kid-
ney function. Data further suggest that
GDF-15 not only can modulate the renal
extracellular matrix production through
an indirect route other than the Smad sig-
naling pathway, but may also enhance cel-
lular proliferation of tubular epithelial cells
through noncanonic MAP kinase signal-
ing pathway.16 In fact, a study demon-
strated that the longitudinal prolifera-
tion of acid-secreting collecting duct cells was dependent
upon expression of GDF-15,17 suggesting that GDF-15 may
be crucial for maintaining tubular integrity by enhancing tu-
bular repair. Intrarenal GDF15 may also prevent organ dam-
age through controlling recruitment of inflammatory cells, as
previously reported in experimental myocardial infarction
and an early type 1 diabetic kidney disease model.13,16 Taking
these experimental discoveries together with our findings, a
plausible signaling pathway could be that kidney damage
stimulated intrarenal GDF15 expression, possibly by TNF-
and p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms,18 which
then triggered a series of protective responses including in-
hibiting extracellular matrix protein accumulation, activating
proliferation of the tubular epithelial cells, and preventing
inflammatory cell recruitment. Future studies are needed to
determine if administration of GDF-15 is able to ameliorate
pathologic changes in kidney disease using in vitro and in vivo
models.
Our findings have important implications. First, GDF-15
may be an opportunity to expand the current panel of kidney
biomarkers. There has been substantial interest in moving
beyond eGFR and albuminuria to molecular biomarkers
that may more specifically reflect pathophysiology involved
in CKD progression. Second, elevations in GDF-15 may help
identify CKD patients at highest risk for CKD progression.
Third, these data may lead to further studies to understand
the molecular mechanisms that underlie CKD progression
and elevations in GDF-15, which may lead the way for novel
therapeutics.
Our study had several strengths. We studied two indepen-
dent, well characterized CKD cohorts that represented a
broad range of CKD in the United States across multiple
geographic locations. A subset of the study population
had kidney biopsies that allowed study of intrarenal
GDF15 expression. Possible confounders such as comorbid-
ity were well defined in both studies. We had several years of
longitudinal data to assess our outcomes of interest. We
recognize a few limitations as well. The GDF-15 measures

 were performed in different laboratories and years, how-
ever, the same assay was used for both cohorts. Included
participants from both cohorts were older with lower base-
line eGFR (compared with excluded participants), which
may have influenced our findings. All eGFR measures to
determine the outcomes of interest (.30% loss of baseline
eGFR) were taken in the ambulatory setting and were on
the basis of a single follow-up eGFR measure. It is possible
that participants had fluctuations in eGFR or AKI. How-
ever, this would have likely biased our results toward the
null. Ascertainment of covariates differed in the two
cohorts—C-PROBE relied on clinical da-
tabases whereas SKS relied on study visit
information. We did not have longitudi-
nal cystatin C measures in C-PROBE so
eGFR was defined using serum creati-
nine. However, serum creatinine is the
kidney biomarker most widely used clin-
ically. Unfortunately, clinical or novel
inflammatory markers were not system-
atically available in both C-PROBE and
SKS and thus could not be assessed in this
analysis. Although we found strong asso-
ciations in our study, we cannot deter-
mine causality on the basis of our current
data.
In conclusion, elevated GDF-15 was
associated with greater than a two-fold
increased risk of decline of eGFR in two
independent CKD cohorts. Circulating
GDF-15 was strongly correlated with intra-
renal tubulointerstitial GDF15 expression.
GDF-15 may inform intrarenal abnormal-
ities that are associated with CKD and with
CKD progression. Further studies should confirm and extend
these findings.

 stage 1–4 are recruited from six sites in the United States, including:
John H. Stroger Hospital, Chicago; Renaissance Renal Research In-
stitute, Detroit; University of Michigan Nephrology Program, Ann
Arbor; Wayne State University Nephrology Program, Detroit; Temple
University Nephrology Program, Philadelphia; and Carolinas Medical
Center, Levine Children’s Hospital, Charlotte (http://kidneycenter.med.
umich.edu/cprobe).15,16 Patient demographics, socioeconomic vari-
ables, clinical information, and biosamples are collected at enrollment
and annually thereafter. Patients with polycystic kidney disease and
those who underwent dialysis or transplantation were excluded. At
time of this study, 741 CKD participants were enrolled in C-PROBE.
Inclusion criteria for this study were age.18 years and baseline
eGFR#90 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and patients have at least three eGFR
valuesduringtheobservationperiod(includingretrospectiveeGFRvalues
before study entry and/or prospective eGFR measures). The inclu-
sion of retrospective measures to select study participants was part
of a larger study to examine novel biomarkers and kidney function
decline.15 Participants also needed to have both plasma and urine
samples available at study entry to be included in our study (n=308).
We excluded participants who did not have follow-up beyond the
baseline study visit (n=84), leaving a final analytic sample of n=224. Par-
ticipants who were included in the analysis were more likely to be older,
and have lower eGFR and higher comorbidity (Supplemental Table 1).
A subgroup of n=24 of the 224 patients underwent kidney biopsies for
clinical indications, which were used for gene expression analysis.
The SKS
The SKS is an ongoing nephrology clinic–based cohort study of people
with CKD, which began recruitment in 2004 and study visits in
2005.17–20 Participants were recruited from outpatient nephrology
clinics at the University of Washington Medical Center, Harborview
Medical Center, and the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care
Center in Seattle, Washington. Inclusion criteria were age.18 years,
and eGFR# 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or a urinary protein-to-creatinine
ratio of .30 mg/g. Exclusion criteria for entry into the cohort in-
cluded: current dialysis, previous kidney transplant, inability to pro-
vide informed consent, or expectation of dialysis initiation within
3 months. The study was approved by the University of Washington
Institutional Review Board. The protocol includes annual in-person
study visits with blood collections which are separate from clinical
events and therefore reflective of ambulatory health status. A total of
530 participants met inclusion criteria and were enrolled in SKS.
For this study, we excluded participants who did not have follow-
up beyond the baseline study visit (n=111) or who did not have avail-
able serum for biomarker analysis (n=126), leaving a final analytic
sample of n=297. Participants who were included in the analysis were
more likely to be older, and have lower eGFR and higher comorbidity
(Supplemental Table 1).
Circulating GDF-15 Measurement in C-PROBE and SKS
GDF-15 concentrationwas measured in plasma (C-PROBE) or serum
(SKS) samples using Human GDF-15 Quantikine ELISA (R&D Sys-
tems, Minneapolis, MN) in both C-PROBE (2013) and SKS (2014).
Assay validation was performed following standard operation pro-
tocol for conduct of immunoassay validation including dynamic
concentration range, lower and upper limits of quantification, ma-
trix effect, precision, stability, selectivity and specificity, and dilution
parallelism. A dilution factor of 1:4 was applied for plasma samples.
The absorbances were measured by spectrophotometry (450 nm)
and unknown concentrations determined through a four-parameter
logistic curve fit. In C-PROBE, all samples were measured in dupli-
cate and means were used for further quantification. The intra- and
interplate coefficients of variation of the QCs were ,10% in C-PROBE
and in SKS.
Gene Expression Profiling in C-PROBE
To understand the underlying mechanism of circulating GDF-15 with
progression of CKD, we investigated the association of circulating
GDF-15 with intrarenal GDF15 expression as well as intrarenal
GDF15 expression with eGFR. On the basis of RNAseq data derived
from rat nephron segments,21 GDF15 RNA expression was detected
in several tubular segments, including short descending limb, inner
medulla long descending limb, cortical collecting duct, and inner
medullary collecting duct (Supplemental Figure 1).21 Therefore, we
specifically investigated tubulointerstitial expression of GDF15. Gene
expression was performed on microdissected tubulointerstitial com-
partment from the kidney biopsy tissue of 24 (out of 224) C-PROBE
patients. The details of tissue harvesting, microdissection, RNA iso-
lation, reverse-transcription, linear amplification, and target prepa-
ration followed published strategies;15 Affymetrix GeneChip Human
Genome–U133 Plus 2.0 Array were used for this study. The raw data
were preprocessed, normalized, and log2-transformed.15
Kidney Outcomes
Serum creatinine was measured by the modified rate Jaffe method
with an assay traceable to isotope dilution mass spectrometry. We
calculated eGFR annually using the CKD-EPI equation.22 The pri-
mary renal outcome was the time to the first occurrence of .30% loss
of baseline eGFR or initiation of renal replacement therapy (need for
chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation) over follow-up. A second-
ary outcome was annualized relative change in eGFR over the follow-
up period. End of follow-up was February 2013 for SKS and January
2014 for C-PROBE.
Covariates
Covariates were obtained from clinical records for participants in
C-PROBE and from research study visits in SKS. Prevalent conditions
were determined on the basis of physician diagnosis in the medical
record (C-PROBE) or byself-report(SKS). In C-PROBE, medications
were ascertained from the patients’ medical records. In SKS, medi-
cations were assessed by inventory assessment and missing medica-
tion data were completed by chart review.23 In SKS, diabetes by any of
the following: use of an oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin,
fasting blood sugar $126 mg/dl, nonfasting blood sugar $200 mg/dl,
or hemoglobin A1c$6.5%. In SKS, threeseated BP measurementswere
recorded using an automated sphygmomanometer; the average of the
last two readings was retained for analysis. Hypertension was defined by
the use ofany antihypertensive medication, systolic BP $140 mmHg, or
diastolic BP $90 mmHg. General chemistries were measured on a
Beckman-Coulter DxC autoanalyzer (Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA).

 Urine albumin and creatinine were measured in spot morning or over-
night urine collections, by a timed end point method and with the
modified rate Jaffe method.
Statistical Analyses
Characteristics of the study populations in C-PROBE and SKS were
described across study-specific quartiles of circulating GDF-15.
The correlations of intrarenal GDF15 transcript with circulating
GDF-15 levels and baseline kidney function in matching samples
were calculated using Pearson correlation.
We calculated unadjusted incidence rates as the number of events
divided by person-years at risk. The functional form of the association
of circulating GDF-15 with first occurrence of loss of .30% eGFR or
initiation of RRT was assessed using cubic splines. The association was
linear, so we conducted the analyses modeling GDF-15 in study-specific
quartiles as well as a continuous exposure (per doubling). Cox propor-
tional hazards were used to test the association of GDF-15 (in study-
specificquartiles as well as continuous perdoubling) measured at baseline
and time until the first occurrence of loss of .30% eGFR or initiation
of RRT. Covariates for adjustment were selected a priori on the basis of
previous literature on potential confounders for the association of
GDF-15 with study outcomes.9,11,12 Nested models were used in
order to progressively explore the confounding effects of demographic
characteristics, measures of kidney function, comorbidity, and medica-
tion use. The first model included baseline age, sex, race (white, black,
other), eGFR (log2-transformed), and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio
(log-transformed). The second model added prevalent cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, systolic BP, and antihypertensive medication use. Par-
ticipants were censored at death, loss to follow-up, or end of data col-
lection (February of 2013 for SKS and January of 2014 for C-PROBE).
We also tested the association of baseline GDF-15 with annualized
relative change in eGFR over the follow-up period using generalized
estimating equation models, accounting for within-participant clus-
tering across time. We adjusted for covariates as above. Among par-
ticipants who initiated dialysis, we imputed an eGFR of 10 ml/min per
1.73 m2. Patients were censored after progression to ESRD.
All P values were two-tailed (a=0.05). All analyses were per-
formed using Stata release 13.1 (College Station, TX) and R.
