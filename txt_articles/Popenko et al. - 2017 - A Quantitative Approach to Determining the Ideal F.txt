IMPORTANCE Aesthetic proportions of the lips and their effect on facial attractiveness are
poorly defined. Established guidelines would aid practitioners in achieving optimal aesthetic
outcomes during cosmetic augmentation.
OBJECTIVE To assess the most attractive lip dimensions of white women based on
attractiveness ranking of surface area, ratio of upper to lower lip, and dimensions of the lip
surface area relative to the lower third of the face.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In phase 1 of this study, synthetic morph frontal digital
images of the faces of 20 white women ages 18 to 25 years old were used to generate 5 varied
lip surface areas for each face. These 100 faces were cardinally ranked by attractiveness
through our developed conventional and internet-based focus groups by 150 participants.
A summed ranking score of each face was plotted to quantify the most attractive surface
area. In phase 2 of the study, 4 variants for each face were created with 15 of the most
attractive images manipulating upper to lower lip ratios while maintaining the most attractive
surface area from phase 1. A total of 60 faces were created, and each ratio was ranked by
attractiveness by 428 participants (internet-based focus groups). In phase 3, the surface area
from the most attractive faces was used to determine the total lip surface area relative to the
lower facial third. Data were collected from March 1 to November 31, 2010, and analyzed from
June 1 to October 31, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Most attractive lip surface area, ratio of upper to lower lip,
and dimension of the lips relative to the lower facial third.
RESULTS In phase 1, all 100 faces were cardinally ranked by 150 individuals (internet-based
focus groups [n = 130] and raters from conventional focus groups [conventional raters]
[n = 20]). In phase 2, all 60 faces were cardinally ranked by 428 participants (internet-based
focus groups [n = 408] and conventional raters [n = 20]). The surface area that
corresponded to the range of 2.0 to 2.5 × 104 pixels represented the highest summed rank,
generating a pool of 14 images. This surface area was determined to be the most attractive
and corresponded to a 53.5% increase in surface area from the original image. With the
highest mean and highest proportions of most attractive rankings, the 1:2 ratio was deemed
most attractive. Conversely, the ratio of 2:1 was deemed least attractive, having the lowest
mean at 1.61 and the highest proportion of ranks within 1 with 310 votes (72.3%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Using a robust sample size, this study found that the most
attractive lip surface area represents a 53.5% increase from baseline, an upper to lower lip
ratio of 1:2, and a surface area equal to 9.6% of the lower third of the face. Lip dimensions and
ratios derived in this study may provide guidelines in improving overall facial aesthetics and
have clinical relevance to the field of facial plastic surgery.

ell-defined and full lips convey youth and attrac-
tiveness, representing a key feature of the lower fa-
cial third.1-5 Whether the goal is to restore the se-
nile lip to its previous youthful glory or mimic the pouty
appearance of the social media starlet, lip augmentation has
become an increasing trend.6 Popular cosmetic procedures de-
signed for augmentation range from temporary injectable der-
malfillers(ie,hyaluronicacid)tostructuralfatgraftingandsoft
alloplastic implants.7-10 Although dermal fillers for lip en-
hancement are relatively low cost and generally safe, aes-
thetic guidelines to direct the clinician in lip augmentation re-
main elusive8,9,11 and are primarily based on patient preference
and surgeon eye.6
Quantitative tools used to evaluate fullness include quan-
tifying proportions in lip volume with 2-dimensional analy-
sis using anthropometric measurements from patient
photographs,11 digital morphs,12 and proportions of the ver-
million height to other measurements in the lower facial third.1
In addition, several validated tools for evaluating the appear-
ance of the lip have been proposed.13,14 Although these meth-
ods are promising, there is currently no accepted dimension
considered most attractive or ideal other than the subjective
conceptoffullerlips.8,15Aputativeidealheightratioofthemid-
line upper to lower lip in white individuals has been previ-
ously defined as 1:1.6 based on the golden ratio, with an upper
lip projection of 3.5 mm and a lower lip projection of 2.2 mm
on lateral view.16 Although symmetry, fullness, and well-
demarcatedvermillionbordersaretimelessfeaturesoftheaes-

based on current trends13 and has not been systematically
evaluated.6,17 The aim of this study is to use our previously
established focus group process to determine (1) the most
attractive lip surface area (SA) of white women, (2) the most at-
tractive upper to lower lip ratio, and (3) the total lip SA relative
to the lower third of the face.
Methods
The general study design is shown in Figure 1. Data were col-
lected from March 1 to November 31, 2010, and analyzed from
June 1 to October 31, 2016. Using a database of synthetic im-
ages previously rated by attractiveness,18,19 we determined the
most attractive SA of the lip. Keeping this SA constant, the up-
per to lower lip ratios of the most attractive faces from phase
1 were adjusted and an additional survey administered to de-
finethemostattractiveratio.ThemostattractiveSAswereused
to generate a ratio of the SA of the lips to the SA of the lower
facial third.
Development of the Synthetic Image Database
A database of parent images used to generate synthetic im-
ages,whicharesubsequentlyrankedbyattractiveness,wasde-
velopedanddescribedinourpreviousstudies.18,20Briefly,fron-
tal photographs were obtained from female volunteers 18 to
25 years of age. Each photograph was used as an original par-
entgenerationtobemorphedwithanotherfromthesamegen-
eration. In each photograph, reference points in the same area
were selected. By overlaying each image with corresponding
referencepoints,prominentfacialfeatureswereoutlined,from
which an algorithm created a blended 50:50 composite with
averaged characteristics. The images were cardinally ranked
by attractiveness on a 10-point Likert scale (with 1 indicating
the least attractive face and 10 indicating the most attractive
face) by our previously described internet-based focus
group,18,19 establishing an overall attractiveness score for each
face.Forthepresentstudy,20photographswereselectedfrom
the database. All facial images used were created and pre-
sented to raters with approval from the institutional review
board at the University of California, Irvine. As only synthetic
morphs were used in this research and original photographs
were never submitted for facial attractiveness rating, consent
Key Points
Question What lip dimensions are the most attractive in white
women?
Findings All 100 faces were cardinally ranked by 150 individuals
in phase 1, and all 60 faces were cardinally ranked by 428
participants in phase 2. In a survey of attractiveness, an increase of
53.5% in the total lip surface area with a linear dimension equal to
9.6% of the lower face and an upper to lower lip ratio of 1:2 was
found to be the most attractive.
Meanings These findings indicate a quantifiable approach to
determining the most attractive lip proportions used in
augmentation procedures.

view board at the University of California, Irvine.
Phase 1: Developing a Set of Lip SA Images
A set of 20 synthetic images that had variable lip SAs and pro-
portions were selected and normalized for size by using inter-
pupillary distance for accurate comparison of linear dis-
tances and SAs. Facefilter Studio 2 (Reallusion Inc), an image
editing and modification software, was used to manipulate lip
dimensions (eg, −50%, +200%, and so on). This augmenta-
tion or reduction equally altered the upper and lower lips;
therefore, the total SA was changed, but the upper to lower lip
ratio was left unchanged. Lip dimensions were reduced or aug-
mented to create a series of 5 modified images per face with
varying SAs. Manual adjustment performed with the soft-
ware involved scaling the lip from the labrale superius to the
labraleinferiorus.Adjustmentstothelabialfissure,orlipwidth,
were not performed because this is not routinely performed
in lip augmentation procedures.4 Reduction and augmenta-
tion of lip SA ranged from −200% to 250% from the original;
varying degrees of maximum augmentation and minimum re-
duction were used for each image because of the varying shape
of the lips and chosen based on our clinical experience of what
appeared naturally or possible with augmentation. To ensure
that raters were evaluating changes in lip size, the facial im-
agesselectedcontainedfeaturesthatdidnotdetractfocusfrom
the lips. This required selection of images that were the most
symmetric and therefore above average in terms of attractive-
ness from our parent database.
Using the FaceFilter Studio software, increasing or de-
creasing the SA of each lip by a given percentage did not gen-
erate a corresponding quantifiable area other than noting its
change from baseline (eg, 0% to 100%). Using a Java-based im-
age-processing program (ImageJ), the vermillion border of the
modified lips for the initial, minimum, and maximum modi-
fications were outlined, and the area within the border was
measured in pixels to determine the SA. By plotting these 3 SA
values (minimum, original, and maximum) as a function of
their corresponding percentage adjustment, a trend line was
produced and used to determine the intermediate percent-
ages to be used for SA modification. For example, in one im-
age, the initial percentage adjustment was calculated to be 0%
(24 341 pixels), the maximum as +200% (36 880 pixels), and
theminimumas−200%(16 551pixels).Theintermediateswere
then graphically measured to be +100% (30 000 pixels) and
−100% (20 000 pixels). This method generated a total of 5 im-
ages per face, producing 100 images (Figure 2). The vermil-
lion lip was outlined using a graphics tablet (Intuos3, Wacom
Co Ltd). Certain facial features, such as the vermillion lip, are
not readily recognized by facial recognition software; there-
fore, tracing required clinical experience and manual exper-
tise, a method we have used in our previous studies.18-21
Phase 2: Individual Upper to Lower Lip Ratio
After survey responders ranked images in phase 1 of the study,
15 faces from the original 20 with the most attractive SA were
selected for analysis of upper to lower lip ratio. The SAs of the
15 upper and lower lips were calculated using ImageJ and ad-
justed to fit the most attractive SA obtained in phase 1. With
this SA held constant, upper to lower lip ratios of 1:2, 1:3, 1:1,
and 2:1 were created, generating 4 images for each face for a
total of 60 images (Figure 3). These ratios are representative
of a variety of natural lip sizes and current trends in lip aug-
mentation in which the upper lip is often overfilled com-
pared with the lower lip. The adjusted digital composites were
cropped at the stomion to include only the upper lip and then
recombined with the corresponding lower lip, using the heal
and blur features in Adobe C2S Photoshop (Adobe Systems
Inc) to minimize artificial sharp demarcations from these
combined images. This method was used to make the final
lips appear more natural and was not used for reduction or
augmentation.

view Board at the University of California, Irvine, and effec-

 volved a traditional focus group and a virtual focus group cre-
ated from a social network site (Facebook).19 By this ap-
proach, this study used the initial focus group raters (n = 20)
to reach the social network recruits (n = >1000), ensuring a
large sample size.
Two online surveys were developed using Question-
Pro.com (Survey Analytics LLC) in 2010. In phase 1, partici-
pants were presented with the set of 5 images per face of
varying SAs and asked to cardinally rank each face for over-
all facial attractiveness on a 5-point Likert scale (with 1 indi-
cating the least attractive photograph and 5 indicating the
most attractive photograph). In phase 3, participants were
presented with the set of 4 images per face of varying upper
to lower lip ratios and asked to cardinally rank each face for
overall facial attractiveness on a 4-point Likert scale. Evalua-
tors were not informed that images were synthetic and were
masked to the process of image manipulation. The tradi-
tional focus group members participated in both phase 1 and
phase 2.
Derivation of Most Attractive SA and Ratio From Surveys
Each face had a mean cardinal rank produced by the facial
attractiveness scores evaluated in the survey. For phase 1,
a range of 1 × 104 to 4 × 104 pixels was derived for all images
from ImageJ tracings. Therefore, the images were initially
grouped by the number of pixels into groups by 2.5 × 103-
pixel increments. Next, for each image in the group, the
mean rank was assigned to each image and the total for that
group summed. The group with the highest rank sum was
categorized as the most attractive. With the use of ImageJ
software, these images were manually analyzed and per-
centage augmentation from the original calculated by trac-
ing the upper and lower lips. This generated a SA that was
used to develop ratios for phase 2.
In phase 2, facial attractiveness scores were used to de-
velop a histogram comparing rater vote frequency as a func-
tion of cardinal ranking to obtain the most attractive upper to
lower lip ratio (Figure 4). This histogram was further statisti-
cally analyzed as described below.

 Phase 3: SA Compared With Lower Facial Third
As previously noted, all faces were normalized by interpupil-
lary distance before adjustment and analysis. Phase 1 gener-
ated a mean attractiveness for each image. The images cardi-
nally ranked as most attractive based on SA were used to
calculate the ratio of SA of total vermillion lip to lower third
of the face. The lower third of the face, as defined by the neo-
classical canons, is measured from the subnasale to the gna-
thion (menton).22
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed using PASW Statistics (SPSS Inc).
For phase 2, mean ranks for each ratio were calculated, and
the rank-based nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was per-
formed to determine a difference between mean attractive-
ness by rank, using rank as a continuous variable given that
imageswerepaired(ie,4imagesaresimultaneouslyshownand
ranked). The 2-sided Kruskal-Wallis test was also performed
to determine whether there was a statistically significant dif-
ference between each ratio pair (1:1 compared with 1:2, 1:1
compared with 1:3, and so on) using the Tukey honestly sig-
nificant difference test to adjust for multiple comparisons
between pairs.
Results
Phase 1: Total Lip SA
All 100 faces were cardinally ranked by 150 individuals (inter-
net-based focus groups [n = 130] and raters from conven-
tional focus groups [conventional raters] [n = 20]), generat-
ing an optimal lip SA for every face in phase 1. The SA that
corresponded to the range of 2.0 to 2.5 × 104 pixels repre-
sented the highest summed rank, generating a pool of 14 im-
ages (eFigure in the Supplement). This SA was determined to
be the most attractive and corresponded to a 53.5% increase
in SA from the original image.
Phase 2: Upper to Lower Lip Ratios and Phase 3:
Lip SA to Lower Facial Third
All 60 faces were cardinally ranked by 428 participants
(internet-based focus groups [n = 408] and conventional
raters [n = 20]), generating a mean attractiveness ranking
for each image. The means for each ratio were statistically
not equal (Table), and the ratio of 1:2 had the highest mean
rank overall at 3.10. Pairwise testing revealed a statistically
significant difference among all ratio pairs except 1:1 to 1:3
(P < .001) (Table). A histogram was generated of the propor-
tion of attractiveness ranks within each ratio (Figure 4). The
ratio of 1:2 had the highest proportion of ranks within 4
(most attractive) with 180 votes (42.1%), followed by 1:1 (102
votes [23.83%]), 1:3 (86 votes [20.14%]), and 2:1 (59 votes
[13.8%]). With the highest mean and highest proportions of
most attractive rankings, the 1:2 ratio was deemed most
attractive. Conversely, the ratio of 2:1 was deemed least
attractive, having both the lowest mean at 1.61 and the high-
est proportion of ranks within 1 with 310 votes (72.43%).
The SA of this ideal lip generated in phase 1 corresponds to a
linear dimension equal to 9.6% of the distance of the lower
third of the face.
Discussion
We sought to quantitatively determine the most attractive SA
and upper to lower lip ratio in a stepwise fashion using a large
sample focus group. We initially quantified the most attrac-
tivelipbySA,thenusedtheidentifiedSAtodeterminethemost
attractive upper to lower lip ratio, and finally determined the
ratioofthelipstothelowerfacialthird.Wefoundthatthemost
attractive faces corresponded to those with an augmentation
of the total SA by a mean of 53.5% from baseline and corre-
sponding to 9.6% of the total SA of the lower facial third, with
an upper to lower lip ratio of 1:2. Faces that deviated from this
ideal SA or ratio were deemed less attractive. Overall, these
findings were consistent with the ratio of most natural lips be-
fore any augmentation procedure.
We previously developed a novel method for generating
synthetic images for analyzing facial attractiveness.20 Our ro-
bust virtual model for ranking facial attractiveness used a com-
bined traditional and internet-based focus group to perform
aesthetic analysis.19,23 This method has generated a robust set
of attractiveness data, allowing for a highly powered statisti-
cal analysis compared with all previous studies on focus group
evaluation of lip aesthetics.4,24-27
Several goals exist for lip augmentation, including
improving lip fullness, restoring volume in age-associated
atrophy, and providing a more distinct vermillion border and
philtrum.28 General guidelines offer the practitioner options
for creating an ideal aesthetic but are often based on subjec-
tive analysis. Although analysis of lip fullness through mor-
phometric analysis has previously been documented,12 ideal
proportions and dimensions have not been clearly estab-
lished. Our results indicate a more natural result is viewed
as more aesthetically appealing, which provides clinicians

 with an objective foundation when proceeding with aug-
mentation. We advocate preservation of the natural ratio or
achieving a 1:2 ratio in lip augmentation procedures while
avoiding the overfilled upper lip look frequently seen among
celebrities.
The present study sought to determine attractive ideals
for white women, and it is generally accepted that “harmony
and disharmony does not lie within angles, distances…or
volumes. They arise from proportion.
”29(p ix) Coleman et al24
found that, with respect to chin position, fuller lips were
preferred in computer-generated retrognathic and progna-
thia profiles, whereas more retrusive lips were preferred in
typical profiles among their focus group. Likewise, it has
been previously reported that orthodontia treatment that
protudes or retrudes lips is significantly unattractive.30 Simi-
larly, Penna et al26 evaluated the ideal lip position with
respect to the lower third of the face and found more attrac-
tive female lips had a higher ratio of lower vermillion height
to chin-mouth distance, increased vermillion height to sub-
nasale stomion, and vermillion height to subnasale menton.
This association was observed in both frontal and lateral
views. Taken together, fuller lips, when in harmony with the
craniofacial skeleton, are generally considered more ideal.
Although useful in overall facial analysis, these studies do
not provide a quantitative tool for guiding aesthetic aug-
mentation. In the current study, morphed images were over-
all more attractive in that they were significantly more pro-
pitiate than the corresponding parent images. Thus, this
method allowed us to determine the most attractive lips
given that overall facial proportions were in harmony. As
most procedures in facial plastic surgery, it is generally rec-
ommended that the ideal lip aesthetic during augmentation
should consider the entire face.8
As the use of biologic agents for augmentation continues
to increase, a validated metric for assessing fullness is neces-
sary to aid in establishing aesthetic goals and allowing for re-
producibility. The Medicus Lip Fullness Scale and Lip Full-
nessScaleare5-pointscalesvalidatedbyphotographicandlive
evaluation by trained physicians, with good intraobserver and
interobserver reliability13,14 that may be used to assess full-
ness. These scales provide a tool to reliably determine whether
a patient’
s lips should be augmented, providing patients the
ability to gauge their augmentation goals.14 Sawyer et al17 used
3-dimensional stereophotogrammetry to quantitatively ana-
lyze the linear distances, areas, and volumes of healthy un-
treatedvolunteersandfoundsignificantdifferencesinallmea-
sures, with a trend toward larger values in men. In our study,
we opted to use cardinal rankings to choose the most attrac-
tive face based on changes in lip SA or upper to lower lip ratio
because we were assessing overall attractiveness based on
changes in lip dimensions and not lip fullness. Future studies
should compare focus group attractiveness scores to clini-
cians’perceptions to determine whether there is concor-
dance between these groups.
Limitations
Several limitations exist within the scope of our analysis.
First, because there is no established reference range for
total lip SA modification in the general population, the SA
percentage reduction and augmentation extremes from our
morphs were generated based on clinical experience of
what appeared to be feasible. Second, the use of digital soft-
ware to generate a range of upper to lower lip ratios, blend
the upper and lower lips, and measure total areas lends
itself to a degree to subjectivity and bias. Although the ver-
milion border provides an excellent border for tracing, it is
not realistically traced automatically by facial recognition
software; therefore, this method introduces a degree of sub-
jectivity that is otherwise unavoidable. Third, we included
upper to lower lip ratios that we believe represent what is
most commonly seen in natural and filled lips; however,
several permutations likely exist in the population that were
not tested (ie, 1:1.5, 1:1.8, and so on). Fourth, we were not
able to assess interrater reliability with respect to consis-
tently choosing a particular ratio as attractive across all
faces.
An additional limitation exists with respect to our survey
methods. Although the traditional focus group of 20 indi-
viduals solicits more than 2000 participants to complete the
survey, dropouts resulted in a total of 578 participants.
Dropouts may occur in part because of survey fatigue based
on overuse of this population in previous works.18,19,23 Fur-
thermore, the method asked the traditional focus group of
undergraduate students to solicit their social network con-
tacts aged 18 to 25 years who were attending a 4-year univer-
sity for survey; however, demographics could not be con-
firmed, and experience with fillers or conflicts of interest
could not be ascertained, potentially resulting in confound-
ing. Therefore, lack of demographic information also does
not allow for screening of exclusion criteria or control of dif-
ferent aesthetic preferences that may exist between men
and women. Although this may diminish the scientific
rigor of the analysis, a previous study18 found that 3 tradi-
tional focus groups (otolaryngologists, beauticians, and
undergraduates) are strongly correlated in assessments of
facial attractiveness. The method for soliciting surveyors
through social media when compared with a traditional
undergraduate focus group also results in strong intergroup
correlation.19 Nevertheless, lack of exclusionary criteria rep-
resents a study limitation.
Conclusions
The arbiters of patient preferences in facial aesthetics repre-
sent a complex interplay of print, advertisements, and social
media. We aimed to provide plastic surgeons with a quantita-
tive means to guide aesthetic parameters in lip augmenta-
tion. Using a statistically rigorous process with more than 500
participantsinourfocusgroup,wefoundthatanoptimumaug-
mentation of 53.5%, an SA representing 9.6% of the lower third
of the face, and an upper to lower lip ratio of 1:2 are viewed as
most attractive and potentially ideal. Lip dimensions and
ratios derived in this study provide guidelines in improving
overall facial aesthetics and have clinical relevance to the field
of facial plastic surgery.
