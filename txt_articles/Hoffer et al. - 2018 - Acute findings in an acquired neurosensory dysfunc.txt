Background: In the Autumn of 2016, diplomatic personnel residing in Havana began to present with symptoms of dizzi-
ness, ear pain, and tinnitus that emerged after perception of high frequency noise and/or a pressure sensation. Understanding
the acute symptoms of this disorder is important for better defining the disorder and developing optimal diagnostic, preven-
tive, and treatment algorithms.
Objectives: To define the presenting symptoms in a cohort of patients in the acute time period after perceiving a noise/
pressure exposure in Havana.
Design/Settings/Participants: Review of 25 symptomatic individuals who reported a localized sensation of noise/pres-
sure and 10 asymptomatic individuals (roommates of those affected) who did not experience the sound/pressure.
Results: Immediately after the exposure, the majority of individuals reported intense ear pain in one or both ears and
experienced tinnitus. All of the individuals noticed unsteadiness and features of cognitive impairment. On presentation to our
center, dizziness (92%) and cognitive complaints (56%) were the most common symptoms. Formal testing revealed that 100%
of individuals had an otolithic abnormality and evidence of cognitive dysfunction.
Conclusion and Relevance: This study focuses on the acute presentation of a phenomenon in which symptoms emerge
after perception of a localized noise/pressure and in which the acute symptomology includes the universal nature of vestibular
injuries and select cognitive deficits. The findings presented in this acute group of patients begin to provide a better picture of
the initial injury pattern seen after this exposure and may allow for more accurate diagnosis of this disorder in future cases.
Key Words: Vestibular disorder, Cuba exposure, cognitive disorder, brain injury.

BACKGROUND
Beginning in late 2016 and continuing into 2017, a
number of diplomats and family members stationed in
Havana, Cuba began to report complaints of sudden onset
dizziness, ear pain, and tinnitus. Most of the affected
individuals reported hearing an unexplained noise before
the symptoms began. The affected individuals character-
ized the sound as being 1) loud, 2) high frequency, 3) very
localized, and 4) capable of following them throughout a
room. In addition, several individuals reported that if
they went outside their front door, the noise immediately
stopped. Others reported a sensation of pressure passing
through their head and abdomen in certain parts of the
room that could be relieved by moving a few feet away.
Swanson et al. reported preliminary findings from
21 exposed individuals who were evaluated an average of
201 days after the perceived exposure; 20 reported persis-
tent
symptoms
and
displayed
signs
that
resembled
aspects of mild traumatic brain injury. More precise char-
acterization of their symptom profiles as well as the iden-
tification of the sources of these signs and symptoms is
limited, though, by the absence of information regarding
the acute presentation of the exposed patients and the
early course of their treatment response.1 The purpose of
this study is to describe the acute presentation of individ-
uals who experienced neurosensory symptoms after expo-
sure to a unique sound/pressure phenomenon.
METHODS
Participants
This retrospective study has been approved by the IRB
at the University of Miami as well as the University’s
HIPPA compliance office. It has also been approved by the
IRB at the University of Pittsburgh. The University of
Miami conducted evaluations of all individuals who sus-
pected they were affected by an exposure, as well as a sam-
ple of individuals who worked and lived in the same
geographic area and denied any exposure. Our group was
referred 35 individuals from the same diplomatic mission as
the index case. These 35 individuals were selected because
they reported that they had either experienced the noise
and or a pressure wave and had symptoms similar to the
index case or because they were in the same house at the
same time as someone experiencing these phenomena. All of
these individuals were evaluated at an academic medical
center in the United States between 4 and 60 days after
exposure. There is some, but not total overlap with the
patients described by Swanson et al.1 In addition, this group
saw a larger group of 105 embassy workers who denied any
“exposure” to noise or a pressure sensation, neither person-
ally nor in anyone who shared their domicile. These individ-
uals were largely referred to us by self- request or request of
the embassy although the US Marines stationed at the
embassy who were not on the initial list, but were seen at
the request of the investigators. These individuals were all
evaluated in Cuba and underwent the same structured his-
tory and physical as those seen in Miami and none of them
displayed the symptoms seen in the symptomatic cases, with
the exception of some preexisting headache (see Fig. 1). This
paper is a review of the presenting symptoms in indiviudals
who experienced symptoms after an exposure. The study
uses descriptive methods to characterize common symptom
patterns that help to better characterize the injury pattern
seen after this exposure.
Intervention
All individuals seen at this academic center under-
went a comprehensive history and physical examination
that included a standard set of history questions, a physi-
cal exam targeted to the head and neck, and a neurologic
examination. Standard eye movement testing was per-
formed as part of the neurologic exam and this testing
was filmed for more precise computer analysis. These
tests included examining the eyes for nystagmus in all
fields of gaze, smooth pursuit tests, horizontal saccades,
predictive saccades, anti-saccades, optokinetic response,
and vergence measurements. In addition, they underwent
tests of visual and auditory reaction time as well as a
computerized test of subjective visual vertical (aligning a
line straight up and down as a test of the function of the
utricle and saccule). A subset of individuals was referred

 for more formal vestibular and auditory testing and for-
mal neuropsychological testing as allowed by their clini-
cal picture and their health plan.
Statistical Measures
The prevalence of symptoms in the unaffected and
affected groups were analyzed with two tailed Fisher
Exact tests. Binomial confidence intervals for the preva-
lence of individual and multiple symptoms were calcu-
lated by a the modified Wald method described by Agresti
and Coulli.2 Because the Subjective Visual Vertical per-
formance metric (absolute deviation of the subjective set-
ting from earth-vertical) has a non-Gaussian distribution,
the criterion for abnormal performance were set at 3.45
degrees (deg) from true vertical, the lower fifth percentile
in performance for a normal group of 300 subjects tested
with the same protocol (subjects described but SVV data
were not presented in previous publications3,4; the 1% cri-
terion score is 4.3 deg from vertical. The fifth percentile
criterion was also applied for the anti-saccade task error
rate (at least 43%); the control cumulative distribution
has been published.4 The standard clinical criteria for
abnormal findings for rotational testing (gain less than
0.8 for a 100 deg/sec impulse), cervical VEMPs (peak
amplitude <100 microvolts and/or 35% amplitude asym-
metry between sides) and ocular VEMPs (peak ampli-
tude <3 microvolts and/or 35% amplitude asymmetry
between sides) were used. The prevalence of abnormal
findings was calculated and 99% binomial confidence
intervals (modified Wald method,2 calculated directly in

give
expected ranges for prevalence in exposed individuals.
RESULTS
These 35 individuals were examined at the Univer-
sity of Miami, Miller School of Medicine approximately
4 to 60 days after the most recent exposure. There were
21 males and 14 females under the age of 64 years of age
(mean: 42.3 ± 11.3 years). The initial history and exam
identified 10 individuals (six male and four female) who
had no symptoms and simply lived in the same house as
a symptomatic individual and were present in the house
when the symptomatic induvial was exposed. None of
these individuals complained of any new complaints or
symptoms and their targeted Otolaryngology and neuro-
logic exams were entirely normal. Only two of these
asymptomatic individuals reported extremely brief direct
exposure; one reported an extremely brief sensation of
exposure to a force wave and a second heard a very brief,
high-pitched noise for a few seconds on a single occasion.
The remaining eight unaffected patients reported only
indirect exposure, defined as being present in the same
house at the time another individual experienced a direct
exposure. This group of 10 is designated as the “unaf-
fected group.” The lack of symptoms in the non-affected
“housemates” of affected individuals points to the fact
that the exposure showed was both fairly precise and
delimited in space and time.
The remaining 25 individuals reported direct expo-
sure and were symptomatic (Table I). This “affected
group” included 15 males and 10 females with the same
age range and with the same mean age as the larger
group (mean 43.2 ± 12.6 years of age). The affected indi-
viduals all reported direct exposure to either noise or
pressure. In many cases, their search for the origin of the
noise (with the noise following them) resulted in a more

 prolonged exposure exceeding a few minutes. A few indi-
viduals (four total) had briefer, exposures (approximately
1 to 2 minutes), but these occurred over several nights.
Immediately after the exposure the majority of individ-
uals felt intense ear pain in one or both ears and experi-
enced noticeable tinnitus. All of the individuals noticed
unsteadiness and cognitive symptoms (feelings of disori-
entation, lack of mental clarity, slower speed of proces-
sing, difficulty sustaining attention) within 18 hours of
the exposure that produced ear pain. On presentation at
this
academic
institution,
the
affected
individuals
reported a variety of symptoms that could largely be
qualified as neurosensory. All of the symptomatic individ-
uals reported some combination of: 1) dizziness/balance
difficulty, 2) hearing loss, 3) difficulty concentrating and
slowed processing speed, 4) tinnitus, 5) ear pain, and 6)
headaches (non-focal and localized to one side of the head
or the entire head ). The symptom distributions are
shown in Table I. Dizziness (23/25, 92%) and cognitive
complaints (14/25, 56%) were the most common individ-
ual symptoms in the affected group and all of the symp-
toms except headache were significantly more frequent in
the symptomatic patients as compared to the asymptom-
atic. All of the 25 affected individuals reported either diz-
ziness or cognitive complaints, with 12 of 25 (48%)
reporting both symptoms. In addition, the affected group
had a very high incidence of two or more symptoms. All
but one of the affected individuals (96%) had two or more
symptoms (that one individual only had dizziness). Six-
teen individuals (64%) in the affected group had three or
more symptoms. Even if headache is excluded, 14 patients
(56%) in the affected group presented with three or more
symptoms.
There
was
substantial
covariation
between
the
neuro-otologic
symptoms.
Fifteen
affected
individuals
reported either tinnitus or hearing loss (both symptoms
reported by only one person), while 14 affected individ-
uals reported either ear pain or tinnitus (one reported
both symptoms) and no one displayed all three. Because
dizziness was reported by 23 of 25 affected individuals, it
is not surprising that it is commonly associated with the
other prevalent symptoms. For example, dizziness was
also reported by all eight individuals who reported tinni-
tus, seven of eight individuals who reported hearing loss,
and five of seven individuals with ear pain. No patients
in the unaffected group had more than one symptom.
All individuals had a normal ear exam with the
exception of focal erythema in the symptomatic ears of
the seven individuals complaining of ear pain on presen-
tation to the academic medical center. All of the individ-
uals with dizziness/balance disorders had abnormalities
on the qualitative vestibular clinical examination either
on spontaneous gaze (spontaneous nystagmus) or on
rapid head thrust test (Halmagyi head thrust) for more
than one passive head motion frequency. Postural insta-
bility was not impacted in this group of individuals nor
were significant gait abnormalities identified.
Consistent with the standard approach at this facil-
ity for symptomatic patients with potential balance disor-
der or mild concussion, a more specific set of quantifiable
tests was administered to the patients with dizziness to
clarify the diagnosis. Individual patient results are show
in Table II and group data is shown in Table III. There
was a high rate of abnormality (22/25, 88%) in the subjec-
tive visual vertical test (greater than or equal to 3.2
degrees
of
deviation
from
earth-vertical
with
18
of
25 (72%) of these individuals having deviations of greater
than 4.3 degrees). This test is used to determine if there
is damage to the otolithic organs (utricle and saccule)
which are the inner ear organs that sense linear accelera-
tion and orientation of the head relative to gravity.

Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV) magnitude: an abnormal magnitude for
Table II is greater than or equal to 3.2 degrees, which defines the lower fifth
percentile from a group of 300 control subjects. A magnitude less than 3.2
degrees is within normal limits.
Antisaccade Error Rate. An abnormal error rate (incorrect saccade
direction) is considered to be a value greater than or equal to 43%, which
defines the lower fifth percentile from a group of 300 control subjects. Lower
error rates are within normal limits. A zero entry means no errors.
Chair Impulse Test (Horizontal VOR)—HVOR -gain less than 0.80 at
100 degrees/sec impulse was termed abnormal (A). Higher values (>0.80)
were defined as within normal limits (N).
Cervical Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential (cVEMP)—Abnormal
(A) if amplitude less than 100 microvolts and/or greater than 35% amplitude
asymmetry between sides. Patients not exceeding either threshold are within
normal limits (N).
Ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential (oVEMP)—Abnormal (A)
if amplitude less than 3 microvolts and/or greater than 35% amplitude asym-
metry between sides. Patients not exceeding either threshold are within nor-
mal limits (N).

(horizontal

and
vestibular-evoked
myogenic
potential
testing
(otolith-
related functional test). The combination of SVV abnor-
malities and the high prevalence of deficits in both cervi-
cal and ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential
(VEMP) metrics was suggestive of an asymmetric periph-
eral vestibular pathology affecting the otolithic organs.
Central vestibular function testing (including optokinetic
testing, saccadic test, and vestibular fixation tests) was
only abnormal in nine cases (36%). The rotational chair
testing demonstrated aspects of asymmetric peripheral
impairment of horizontal semicircular canal pathways.
All individuals underwent an audiometric evalua-
tion which included air conducted and bone conductive
(sensorineural) testing, word identification scores, a
pure tone average, speech reception testing, tympano-
metry, and acoustic reflex testing. Standard audiomet-
ric criteria were utilized to determine normal hearing
function including a PTA less than or equal to 20 deci-
bels (dB) and a word identification score of 85% or bet-
ter. Despite almost one third of individuals reporting
hearing loss, only two individuals had abnormal hear-
ing tests. Both cases had at least moderate preexisting
hearing loss and while both felt the hearing loss was
now worse. However, we did not have comparison
audiograms available.
The anti-saccade task is an eye movement test
related to executive function; it requires a subject to sup-
press and eye movement to a target and, instead, make
an eye movement of the same magnitude in the opposite
direction. A comparison of the SVV and anti-saccade
abnormalities demonstrated by this group of patients as
compared
to
historical
controls
collected
(but
not
reported) from an earlier series of patients4 is shown in
Figure 2. As can be seen, this group differs significantly
from the control population.
A subset of nine of the 14 individuals with specific
cognitive complaints were administered a battery of
neuropsychological measures. These results are shown
in Table IV in order of impairment with the most
impaired scores shown first. Most commonly reported
neurobehavioral complaints included decreased clarity
of thought or “cognitive fog,” inattention, problems
retrieving information on demand, especially under dis-
tracting conditions, and increased irritability and anxi-
ety as well as overall greater difficulty regulating
emotion. Formal neuropsychological testing using a

in these individuals on measures of verbal fluency,

and
sustained
attention/vigilance,
complex auditory processing requiring the ability to
discriminate select stimuli from background noise, grip
strength, and organizing sequential material during
increasingly high levels of cognitive load. Although all
individuals reported emotional distress, half formally
endorsed depression and anxiety symptoms on self-
report questionnaires.
DISCUSSION
In this report, the authors describe the acute symp-
toms and clinical findings in a cohort of individuals who
reported neurosensory symptoms after perceiving a loud,
high-pitched sound and/or feeling a pressure sensation in
a specific location within a room. The preliminary findings
indicate that this group of individuals has specific vestibu-
lar and cognitive symptoms. The source of this sound/pres-
sure sensation has not been determined but all of the
affected individuals appear to be connected to the diplo-
matic community in Havana. The disorder appears to be
fairly specific for those who actually experienced the
sound/pressure
sensation
because
no
symptoms
were
reported by others living in the household or by a group in
which no one in the household felt any of these phenom-
ena.
Despite
the
authors’
experience
screening
over
100 asymptomatic individuals in Havana, it is fair to say
that one cannot rule out a similar presentation of symp-
toms in other individuals who have not reported hearing a
sound
or
perceiving
the
same
pressure
sensation.

 However, the authors have not encountered a comparable
clinical presentation in individuals who did report either
sensation. Hence, the experience of sound and pressure
sensations in these locations appears to be a sufficient con-
dition for the appearance of symptoms and clinically
abnormal neurosensory findings. The chronic findings orig-
inally reported in JAMA by Swanson et al. are not incon-
sistent with either a partially compensated vestibulopathy
or mild brain trauma.1 The relatively high prevalence of
chronic symptoms is not atypical for peripheral vestibular
disorders.5 One must exercise considerable caution in the
interpretation of a patient’s causal attributions for symp-
toms associated with balance disorders and mild traumatic
brain injury (mTBI), including neuropsychological com-
plaints. Attribution is obvious for overt exposure scenarios
like a blast wave exposure or blunt impact to the head.
However, if dizziness is due to a covert cause, the attribu-
tion is not as likely to be accurate. The dizziness, ear pain,
and subjective cognitive symptoms are aversive; as in the
case of conditioned taste aversion in the presence of nau-
sea and the symptoms may be attributed to irrelevant but
novel conditions that merely coincide temporally with the
proximate cause. Attribution and misattribution issues for
balance
disorders
and
nausea
have
been
reviewed
elsewhere.6–8 More recently, clinical evidence suggests
that objective cognitive findings in patients with Otic cap-
sule dehiscence syndrome are resolved by surgical repair.9
As is well-known for public health concerns, media atten-
tion can increase the prevalence of medical consultation by
the “worried well.” Recent and continued coverage of this
phenomenon therefore makes distinguishing those affected
from the worried well even more important.
The
exposure
responsible
for
these
findings
is
unknown. It would be imprudent to exclude any potential
directed or non-directed energy sources at this time. For
example, perceptions of sound can occur in response to
energy exposures that include microwave pulses in the
audible ultrasonic range (10–15 kHz peak sensitivity) or
as synesthetic effects to light.10,11 Pulsed microwave stim-
ulation is known to produce ultrasonic cochlear micro-
phonics in guinea pigs, which are suggestive of local
propagation of energy in that frequency range.12 The
ultrasonic frequency range is represented at the base of
the cochlea (“hook portion”) in close proximity to the ves-
tibule. Because sound activation of saccule and utricle
produce cervical and ocular VEMPs, respectively, it is not
inconceivable that resonant energy in that range could
affect vestibular function. In fact, the occupational health
literature indicates that intense ultrasonic radiation can
produce “a syndrome involving manifestations of nausea,
headache, tinnitus, pain, dizziness, and fatigue.13,14
The potential mechanisms for injury by incident energy
include cavitation bubble formation in body fluids. Cavitation
bubbles can be produced in aqueous solutions by directed
energy sources.15–17 The energy released by the bubble col-
lapse produces local jet, shock wave, and acoustic emis-
sions.18,19 Cavitating gas bubble formation also has been
associated with local tissue nitrogen accumulation in decom-
pression illness, which may be mimicked by underwater
exposure to intense sound sources.20 Hence, internally gener-
ated, cavitation-related effects in blood and intracranial
fluids (CSF, perilymph, endolymph, and interstitial fluid)
must be considered as possible etiologic factors after
unknown energy exposures.
The pattern of findings in the symptomatic group of a
vestibulopathy combined with other neurosensory findings
could be interpreted as being similar to the presentation of
individuals with acute sequelae of mild traumatic brain
injury following blast exposure or blunt trauma.21,22 In
addition, it does not seem imprudent to speculate that a
highly specific unidentified energy exposure, perceived as
a sound or pressure, could be producing an inner ear dis-
turbance or demonstrate findings suggestive of an mTBI.
However, this injury pattern does have some differences
from the patterns reported in mTBI. The prevalence of
individuals presenting with two or more symptoms and
the SVV abnormalities seems higher than one would
expect after conventional mTBI.23,24 In addition, the low
incidence of headaches (around 25%) is unusual, as many
studies of mTBI show that headache is one of the most
common and persistent symptoms.25–27 Perhaps the most
important objective clinical feature is the nearly universal
evidence of otolithic impairment; such uniformity in symp-
toms is uncommon in mTBI cases from other sources.28,29
This frequency of specific vestibular findings is not seen in
any control populations. In this work the authors provide
the characteristics in a group of patients defined by vestib-
ular pathology in which the clinical presentation seems
most consistent with a primary localized neurotologic
(largely otolithic) injury with cognitive symptoms.
Because this injury pattern has now been reported
elsewhere, it is important for individuals who care for
patients to be aware of the presenting symptoms and
signs. Objective, tests of otolithic and vestibular function
including subjective visual vertical (SVV), vestibular
evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs), and head rotation
test (head impulse tests) proved particularly helpful in
this population. Given the unknown nature of the type
and source of the energy associated with this disorder,
careful assessment and documentation of the presenting
symptoms as they are seen in future will be critical, since
such assessments, at the acute time point after exposure,
will the most accurate characterization of the injury. This
precise characterization of the acute presentation pro-
vides a basis for identifying longer term progression and
determining therapeutic efficacy.
LIMITATIONS
This
study
has
several
limitations
which
were
imposed by the unusual, novel circumstances surround-
ing the referral of diplomatic personnel for examination
after suspected incidents at an overseas site. First, from
a design perspective, we are restricted to retrospective
data analysis. Second, the patient examinations were
restricted to obtaining clinically necessary diagnostic
data. Third, the sample size is limited Nevertheless, this
is likely the only opportunity to report the presenting
symptoms on even these many patients, seen acutely
(without the influence of outside attention or a “pre-
knowledge” of symptomatic complaints). Knowledge of
the unbiased presenting symptom patterns reported here

 is crucial since new cases have been reported all over the
globe affecting individuals from many countries.
CONCLUSION
This study focuses on the presenting symptoms of a
phenomenon in which symptoms emerge after perception
of a localized loud noise or pressure sensation. The
unique features of the acute symptomology include the in
universal nature of vestibular injuries and the pattern of
cognitive findings. The findings presented here are the
first report of the acute symptoms in this patient group
and begin to provide a better picture of some salient
aspects of the initial injury pattern seen after this per-
ceived exposure. This report is intended to facilitate an
objective diagnosis of this disorder as new actual or
potential cases continue to be reported.
