Abstract
Purpose—Survival following ovarian cancer diagnosis is generally low; understanding factors 
related to prognosis could be important to optimize treatment. The role of previously diagnosed 
comorbidities and use of medications for those conditions in relation to prognosis for ovarian 
cancer patients has not been studied extensively, particularly according to histological subtype.
Methods—Using pooled data from fifteen studies participating in the Ovarian Cancer 
Association Consortium, we examined the associations between history of hypertension, heart 
disease, diabetes, and medications taken for these conditions and overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS) among patients diagnosed with invasive epithelial ovarian 
carcinoma. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age and stage to 
estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) overall and within strata of 
histological subtypes.

 Results—History of diabetes was associated with increased risk of mortality (n = 7,674; HR = 
1.12; 95% CI = 1.01–1.25). No significant mortality associations were observed for hypertension 
(n = 6,482; HR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.88–1.02) or heart disease (n = 4,252; HR = 1.05; 95% CI = 
0.87–1.27). No association of these comorbidities was found with PFS in the overall study 
population. However, among patients with endometrioid tumors, hypertension was associated with 
lower risk of progression (n = 339, HR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.35–0.84). Comorbidity was not 
associated with OS or PFS for any of the other histological subtypes. Ever use of beta blockers, 
oral antidiabetic medications, and insulin was associated with increased mortality, HR = 1.20; 95% 
CI = 1.03–1.40, HR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.05–1.55, and HR = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.20–2.20, 
respectively. Ever use of diuretics was inversely associated with mortality, HR = 0.71; 95% CI = 
0.53–0.94.
Conclusions—Histories of hypertension, diabetes, and use of diuretics, beta blockers, insulin, 
and oral antidiabetic medications may influence the survival of ovarian cancer patients. 
Understanding mechanisms for these observations could provide insight regarding treatment.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths among females [1] and the 
most lethal among gynecological cancers [2]. Despite all the advances in treatment of 
patients with ovarian cancer, survival has not improved considerably over the past several 
decades [3]. Older age, higher stage of disease, poor differentiation of tumor, and the 
presence of residual disease after cytoreductive surgery are well-established clinical 
characteristics associated with poor prognosis [4, 5].
It is crucial to understand the role of additional factors related to ovarian cancer prognosis 
including factors that, unlike clinical characteristics, are potentially modifiable and might 
contribute to changing the course of ovarian cancer and improve survival. Among potential 
factors related to ovarian cancer survival, the role of previously existing comorbidities may 
be of importance. In particular, hypertension and diabetes are of interest in that these are 
among the most prevalent diseases [6]. Presence of these conditions could influence 
prognosis directly, perhaps by affecting cancer cell biology or by increasing production of 
growth factors influencing the evolution of cancer cells as a result of prolonged exposure to 
hyperglycemia among patients with pre-existing diabetes [7]. The presence of hypertension, 
diabetes, and their possible complications, such as diabetes-associated neuropathy, 
myocardial infarction, or heart failure, could affect prognosis indirectly by altering patients’ 
ability to tolerate chemotherapy or to receive less invasive surgery [7] or less aggressive 
treatment [8].
Use of medications commonly prescribed for hypertension and other cardiovascular 
conditions, such as beta adrenergic receptor blockers (beta blockers), may also have a direct 
impact on prognosis by limiting the growth of ovarian tumors. In preclinical studies, ovarian 
tumors tend to express adrenergic receptors; activation of these receptors may lead to the

 production of growth factors and result in faster growth and increased invasiveness of the 
tumors [9, 10]. Beta blockers can bind to adrenergic receptors and have been shown to 
decrease invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells in vitro [10].
Epidemiologic evidence regarding the relationship of concurrent morbidities and the 
associated use of medications with survival of ovarian cancer patients is limited and not 
consistent. Increased blood pressure and diabetes were found to be associated with increased 
mortality in some studies [7, 11–13] but not all [11, 14, 15]. Also, in studies that combined 
hypertension and diabetes or diabetes only in a comorbidity index, either no association was 
observed [16, 17] or increased mortality risk was associated with the presence of 
comorbidities [18, 19]. Finally, the use of beta blockers has been found to be related to 
improved prognosis of ovarian cancer patients in some studies [20, 21] but not all [22, 23].
There is evidence that the risk factors for ovarian cancer differ by histologic subtype [24]. 
However, existing studies on the presence of comorbidities and survival of ovarian cancer 
patients have not examined risk by histotype. Moreover, very few studies have examined the 
influence of medications prescribed for these comorbid conditions on ovarian cancer 
outcomes both as independent predictors and as potential effect modifiers of the associations 
between comorbidities and prognosis. Utilizing pooled data from thirteen case–control 
studies and two case-only studies, we investigated the association between history of 
hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes as well as medications commonly prescribed for 
these conditions with survival outcomes among patients diagnosed with invasive epithelial 
ovarian cancer.
Materials and methods
Data collection
Data were obtained from thirteen case–control and two case-only ovarian cancer studies 
participating in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC). In all of the studies 
except AOV, participants provided informed consent, and the study protocols of each study 
were approved by the institutional review boards (IRBs) at the corresponding institutions. 
For AOV, consent was waived by the IRB since, in this particular study, a retrospective chart 
review was utilized as a method of data collection.
Characteristics of these participating studies including study names, location, dates of 
enrollment, methods of data collection and of determination of the history of hypertension, 
heart disease, and diabetes, and prevalence of these conditions are provided in Table 1. Data 
collection methods varied among the study sites and included interviewer-administered 
interviews conducted either in-person or by telephone, self-completed questionnaires, and/or 
medical record reviews.
Collection of data regarding comorbidities also differed among the studies. Some sites had 
specific question phrasing for disease diagnosis by physician or other health care 
professional (CON, DOV, GER, and HAW for diabetes, HOP for hypertension and diabetes, 
MAL for heart disease and diabetes, NCO, NJO, and NTH). Other studies asked about ever 
having the disease (AUS- for diabetes, JPN, NEC, and WOC). In some studies, comorbidity

 data were collected by medical record abstraction (AOV for hypertension and diabetes, 
HAW for hypertension and heart disease, and LAX, HOP, and NTH for all diseases of 
interest). For AUS, history of hypertension and heart disease was determined based on the 
answer to an initial question on history of diseases requiring medical care. For MAL, history 
of hypertension was determined based on the answer to a question on ever usage of 
antihypertensive medications.
In addition to heterogeneity in data collection and disease status determination methods, 
studies also differed in their definitions of heart disease and diabetes. For instance, heart 
disease was defined as angina or myocardial infarction in JPN; cardiovascular disease, 
coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, history of heart attack or stroke, heart failure, or 
heart valve problems for LAX; myocardial infarction in MAL; unspecified heart disease in 
NJO; heart attack, angina, or coronary artery disease in NEC; myocardial infarction or 
congestive cardiac insufficiency in NTH; and coronary artery disease in WOC studies.
For diabetes, seven study centers obtained information about general history of the disease 
(AOV, DOV, GER, JPN, MAL, NJO, WOC), while eight studies elicited data regarding both 
insulin-dependent diabetes and non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NEC) or data regarding 
diabetes treated with insulin or with oral medications or diet (AUS, CON, HAW, HOP, NCO, 
NTH, and LAX).
In the following studies, ages at the time of diagnosis of conditions of interest were 
recorded: AUS, DOV, GER, HAW, HOP, LAX, NCO, NEC, NJO, and NTH for 
hypertension; AUS, HOP, JPN, LAX, MAL, NEC, NJO, NTH, and WOC for heart disease; 
AUS, CON, DOV, GER, HAW, HOP, LAX, MAL, NCO, NEC, NJO, and NTH for diabetes. 
Because of the nature of data collection, the data regarding these diseases included 
conditions developed both prior and after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer.
Detailed information on ever use of medications, specifically the names of ever used 
medications, was collected by AUS, NEC, and NJO. HOP and NTH provided information 
on categories of medication use, beta blockers for HOP, diuretics for NTH, and any 
antihypertensive medications use for both HOP and NTH. In the CON study, data were 
obtained regarding insulin use, and in CON and HAW regarding oral antidiabetic 
medications use.
Prior to statistical analysis, data were cleaned, harmonized, and checked for inconsistencies. 
For the purpose of harmonization, we defined history of heart disease as having any type of 
heart condition as determined by each of the study sites. History of diabetes was defined as 
either having a history of diabetes or ever use of oral antidiabetic medications or insulin.
For the studies that provided information on medication use, medications were divided into 
the following categories: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, 
calcium channel blockers, diuretics, oral antidiabetic medications, and insulin. Medications 
typically prescribed for hypertension were also combined to define a single variable of any 
use of antihypertensive medications.

 From the participants (N = 12,511 patients), we excluded women diagnosed with non-
epithelial (N = 140) or non-invasive (N = 2,520) tumors and those who were not followed 
for survival outcomes (N = 332). The final study population included 9,519 patients 
diagnosed with either ovarian (N = 8,904), fallopian (N = 171), or peritoneal (N = 444) 
cancer. After additional exclusion of patients with missing information on hypertension, 
heart disease, or diabetes, and, for diabetes, exclusion of patients who reported history of 
either gestational or borderline diabetes, our analytic dataset included 6,482 patients with 
available information on hypertension status (yes/no), 4,252 patients with available 
information on heart disease (yes/no), and 7,674 patients with available information on 
history of diabetes (yes/no).
After categorizing medication intake, we found the number of patients with data on the use 
of antihypertensive or antidiabetic medications (yes/no) as follows: 1,500 patients for ACE 
inhibitors, 2,294 patients for beta blockers, 1,594 patients for calcium channel blockers, 
1,728 patients for diuretics, 2,670 patients for any antihypertensive medications, 1,685 
patients for oral antidiabetic medications intake, and 2,001 patients for insulin.
Statistical analysis
We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and the 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations for each comorbidity and for 
the use of each type of medication with ovarian cancer survival outcomes in the pooled 
sample. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the earlier of date 
of death or end of follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time period 
from the date of diagnosis to the date when progression status (persistence, recurrence, or 
death) was determined, or to the end of follow-up for patients without any progression. 
Progression was ascertained according to the OCAC guidelines that instructed OCAC 
studies’ principal investigators to determine progression based on clinical, biochemical 
(CA-125), or radiological assessment. While information on OS was provided by all of the 
study sites included in the present analysis, information on time to progression was provided 
only by the AUS, HAW, JPN, HOP, LAX, MAL, NCO, and NEC studies. Using data from 
only these studies reduced the study population to 2,868 patients with information on 
hypertension status (yes/no), 2,493 patients with information on heart disease status (yes/
no), and to 3,129 patients with information on diabetes status (yes/no).
All statistical models were adjusted for age at ovarian cancer diagnosis (continuous) and 
cancer stage (localized, regional, or distant). These two variables were selected a priori 
because of their known strong influence on the survival of ovarian cancer patients [49–51]. 
Models were additionally evaluated for confounding by each of the following variables: race 
(white/non-white), body mass index (BMI: 18.5 to <25 kg/m2/25 to <30 kg/m2/≥30 kg/m2), 
education (high school or less/higher than high school), family history of breast or ovarian 
cancer (no/yes/unknown), menopausal status (premenopausal/postmenopausal), parity and 
breastfeeding status (never pregnant/pregnant but not breastfed/breastfed), any regular use of 
genital powder (no/yes), history of hysterectomy (no/yes), ever use of oral contraceptives 
(no/yes), history of tubal ligation (no/yes), tumor grade (well differentiated/moderately 
differentiated/poorly differentiated/undifferentiated/unknown), tumor histology (high grade

 serous/low grade serous/mucinous/endometrioid/clear cell/other), and the presence of gross 
disease after cytoreductive surgery (none/any residual disease). Inclusion of any of these 
potential confounders did not change the observed age- and stage-adjusted measures of 
association by more than 10%. Therefore, none of these covariates were included in the final 
models.
We first calculated study-specific HRs and 95% CIs. We examined statistical heterogeneity 
among study-specific HRs using I2 statistics and Cochran’s Q-statistic [52]. No appreciable 
heterogeneity among study-specific HRs was observed (data not shown). Therefore, we 
estimated pooled age- and stage-adjusted HRs and 95% CIs and reported these results 
herein.
To better understand the potential role of prediagnostically developed conditions, we 
additionally examined the duration of history of hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes 
prior to ovarian cancer diagnosis in relation to risk of death. The durations of the 
comorbidity variables were calculated by subtracting age at the time of the condition 
diagnosis from the age at the time of diagnosis with ovarian cancer. The duration variables 
were then dichotomized using various cut-points: 5 years, 10 years, and the median values of 
disease duration, 9.5 years for hypertension, 7 years for heart disease, and 8 years for 
diabetes.
Patients with no history of the comorbidity under consideration were selected as the referent 
category in analyses conducted to assess the association between comorbidities and survival 
outcomes, and patients with no reported use of the specific medication of interest were 
selected as the referent category when examining the associations between medications use 
and OS and PFS. To account for the possibility of variation in confounders among the sites, 
we additionally adjusted each of the models for study site. In the models for the associations 
between medications intake and survival outcomes, we additionally adjusted for the use of 
each of the groups of antihypertensive or antidiabetic medications.
In an attempt to assess the independent role of each comorbidity or combination of 
comorbidities on patients’ survival, we created a composite variable that was categorized 
based on the number of comorbidities that the patient had. This variable had the following 
categories: having no hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes (referent); hypertension only; 
heart disease only; diabetes only; hypertension and diabetes; hypertension and heart disease; 
diabetes and heart disease; and hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease.
To explore the role of diabetes severity on the survival of ovarian cancer patients, we also 
created an additional composite variable with the following categories: no diabetes 
(referent); diabetes with no reported antidiabetic medication use; and diabetes with reported 
use of antidiabetic medications. We used these newly created composite variables in the Cox 
proportional hazards models to explore their association with OS.
Further, we examined whether associations for the presence of comorbidity or medication 
use with survival endpoints differed in strata of main histotypes, high-grade serous, low-
grade serous, mucinous, endometrioid, and clear cell carcinomas. Associations were also 
examined according to strata of BMI (18.5 kg/m2< BMI < 25.0 kg/m2 vs. BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/

 m2), age at ovarian cancer diagnosis (<65 vs. ≥65 years), and stage of disease (local/regional 
vs. distant). Presence of multiplicative interaction was determined by including product 
terms between the exposures of interest and potential effect modifiers (weight status, age at 
diagnosis, stage of disease, and study site) and utilizing likelihood ratio statistics to assess 
the significance of these terms.
As a part of an additional stratified analysis, we separately explored the associations 
between hypertension and OS by history of diabetes and ever use of medications prescribed 
for hypertension including beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and 
diuretics. For diabetes, we also examined the associations with OS stratified by history of 
hypertension. For hypertension, we conducted a separate analysis for subjects with interview 
year prior to the year of 2003 versus from 2003 onward to reflect changes in the guidelines 
for prevention and management of hypertension over time [53]. For beta blockers, we 
examined the associations separately among users of non-selective and selective beta 
blockers.
To further examine the role of antihypertensive medications on mortality, we repeated 
analyses with referent group being never use of any antihypertensive medication. Also, for 
each group of antihypertensive medications, we restricted analyses to individuals with 
hypertension. In addition, we incorporated left truncation in all of the models to account for 
time between the date of ovarian cancer diagnosis and date of the interview and the inability 
to enroll women who had died prior to the recruitment date.
Additional analyses were performed to address the possibility of misclassification of the 
tumor histotypes, specifically high-grade endometrioid tumors. Since pathological review of 
tumors obtained from all patients was performed only in a subset of included studies (AOV, 
CON, HAW, HOP, NCO, NEC, NJO, LAX, and WOC), we attempted to address the 
possibility of misclassification of high-grade endometrioid tumors [54] by reclassifying 
them as high-grade serous tumors if endometrioid tumors’ grade was ≥ G3 [55] and 
repeating analyses with updated classification of endometrioid and high-grade serous 
tumors. All statistical tests were two-sided; p values < 0.05 were considered significant.
Results
In this sample of ovarian cancer patients, the prevalence of hypertension, heart disease, and 
diabetes were 25.9, 3.9, and 8.3%, respectively. Across the studies, the prevalence of 
hypertension ranged from 7.8 to 40.7%, heart disease from 0.7 to 10.1%, and diabetes from 
1.6 to 16.6% (Table 1). Median survival times were 67.9 and 73.7 months for patients with 
and without hypertension, 61.7 and 72.6 months for patients with and without diabetes, and 
54 and 68.4 months for patients with and without heart disease, respectively.
Distributions of the descriptive characteristics among those with and without the diseases of 
interest are shown in Table 2. Patients with a history of hypertension, heart disease, or 
diabetes were significantly more likely to be older, less educated, and postmenopausal, and 
to have a higher BMI and a history of hysterectomy compared to patients without the 
condition.

 History of hypertension was not associated with risk of death among these women with 
ovarian cancer, HR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.88–1.02 (Table 3). However, we observed an inverse 
association between hypertension and OS among those with duration of hypertension more 
than 5 years, HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.79–0.98, whereas in women with hypertension 
duration of five or fewer years there was no association, HR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.80–1.07. 
Similar associations were observed when 10 years and 9.5 years were used as cut-points for 
the hypertension duration variable. No significant associations were found between history 
of hypertension and risk of death for each histotype, most likely due to lack of power (Table 
3). The associations were not appreciably different in strata of stage, age, overweight status, 
presence of diabetes, reported use of antihypertensive medications, or year of interview 
(results not shown).
Among the studies that provided information on progression, no association was observed 
between history of hypertension and PFS, HR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.88–1.10 (Table 4). 
However, when the analysis was stratified by the main histotypes, decreased risk of 
progression was associated with hypertension among patients diagnosed with endometrioid 
tumors, HR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.35–0.84. No association was found between hypertension 
and PFS for the other histological subtypes.
We did not observe any association between history of heart disease and any of the survival 
outcomes. Also, no association was found in the analyses stratified by the same study 
subgroups reported above for hypertension.
History of diabetes was associated with increased risk of death among these patients with 
ovarian cancer, HR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.01–1.25 (Table 3). No association was observed 
between history of diabetes and PFS in the overall sample. The estimated associations did 
not change appreciably in analyses stratified by histotype, overweight status, age, stage, or 
history of hypertension.
When examining the association between a composite variable representing different 
combinations of comorbidities reported by the patients, we observed that being diagnosed 
with hypertension only was inversely associated with mortality, HR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.75–
0.93 (results not shown). Having any other combinations of these comorbidities was not 
associated with death. When exploring the role of diabetes severity in relation to OS, we also 
observed an increased risk of mortality among those who reported use of any antidiabetic 
medications, HR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.07–1.56 (results not shown). At the same time, history 
of diabetes with no reported antidiabetic medications use was positively but non-
significantly associated with mortality, HR = 1.13; 95% CI = 0.78–1.64.
When we examined the use of medications for hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes in 
relation to OS and PFS, we observed that the use of beta blockers, oral antidiabetic 
medications, and insulin was associated with increased risk of mortality, HR = 1.20; 95% CI 
= 1.03–1.40, HR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.05–1.55, and HR = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.20–2.20, 
respectively (Table 5). The associations were similar between those who reported the use of 
selective and non-selective beta blockers, although the individual HRs did not reach 
statistical significance (results not shown). Use of ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers,

 and diuretics was associated with decreased risks of mortality for which only diuretics 
reached statistical significance, HR = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.53–0.94 (Table 5). Additional 
adjustment for other medications of interest did not appreciably change the observed HRs, 
nor did stratification by any of the potential effect modifiers. Additional adjustment for study 
site did not change the observed HRs nor did reclassification of high-grade endometrioid 
carcinomas into high-grade serous ovarian cancer. For antihypertensive medications, 
changing the referent group into never use of any medication or limiting the analysis to 
individuals with hypertension also did not produce a substantial change in the observed HRs. 
None of the product terms between the exposures of interest and potential effect modifiers 
that were included in the models were significant.
Discussion
Ovarian cancer is an important public health problem partly because of its high rate of 
mortality. However, because it is a relatively infrequent disease, large studies are difficult to 
accomplish. Pooling of samples, such as that in this OCAC consortium, is critical to 
understanding factors related to survival. In this large sample of patients with invasive 
ovarian cancer, we observed higher risk of death among women with history of diabetes 
compared to women with no history of this disease. We also observed an inverse association 
between history of hypertension and PFS among women diagnosed with endometrioid 
ovarian carcinoma. Finally, reduced mortality was seen among those with longer duration of 
hypertension prior to diagnosis with ovarian cancer.
Various biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the influence of concurrent 
health conditions on the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. For example, chronic exposure 
to hyperinsulinemia, which is common among older patients diagnosed with diabetes, may 
lead to the activation of the Ras–MAPK and PI 3-K–mTOR pathways which can play roles 
in tumor cell proliferation and cancer progression [56, 57]. Hyperglycemia, which is also 
common among patients with diabetes, can promote the growth of tumor cells which use 
glucose as a source of energy necessary for their increased metabolism [58]. Several studies 
that have evaluated the role of diabetes in relation to survival among ovarian cancer patients 
have shown a significantly increased risk of death among women with this concurrent 
condition [7, 11–13]. Our results provide additional evidence for the role of diabetes as an 
independent factor affecting prognosis. It is important to note, however, that the strength of 
association observed in our study was lower than that observed by others. Such 
heterogeneity may have resulted in a higher probability of underreported diabetes among the 
studies that were based on self-report, while most of the previously conducted studies were 
based on data from medical records abstraction.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the association between history of 
hypertension and survival outcomes among ovarian cancer patients specifically within strata 
of histological subtypes. In one prospective study, an inverse association was observed 
between increased blood pressure and OS among women diagnosed with ovarian cancer 
[15]. Conversely, one retrospective study failed to find an association between history of 
hypertension and survival [11]. Our observation of an inverse association between history of 
hypertension and risk of ovarian cancer progression among patients diagnosed with

 endometrioid tumors could potentially be explained by the underlying biology of this 
particular subtype. It has been speculated that endometrioid ovarian tumors originate from 
endometrial cells that reach the ovaries through retrograde flow of menstrual tissue [59]. For 
endometrial cancer, there is evidence of reduced mortality associated with a history of 
hypertension [60, 61]. The published literature that notes this association is lacking in tested 
biological mechanisms. The authors of both of these studies of endometrial cancer 
hypothesized that antihypertensive treatment might be responsible for the reduced risk of 
mortality. In our study, we only observed the association with PFS and not with OS. We also 
did not find that the association was stronger among those using any of the antihypertensive 
medications. Unfortunately, due to limited power, we were not able to examine the 
association between hypertension and survival in strata of antihypertensive medications 
intake additionally stratified by histological subtype. It is plausible that antihypertensive 
medications could have a differential effect on a hormonal admixture in the patient’s body 
and may influence the tumor microenvironment differently depending on the histotype. This 
finding could have important clinical implications and should be further examined in future 
studies.
Contrary to what was observed in two preclinical studies [9, 10], in our study, there was no 
inverse association between the use of beta blockers and survival. Results similar to ours 
have been observed in some [22, 23] but not in other studies [20, 21, 62]. Studies that found 
no benefit of beta blockers use in relation to survival assessed the exposure including usage 
during the prediagnostic period. Studies that observed a beneficial role of beta blockers 
relied on the assessment of use during the post-diagnostic period which could have been 
affected by immortal person-time bias [63]. In our study, the use of beta blockers was 
primarily prediagnostic which would have avoided this bias. We also did not observe any 
substantial difference between mortality HRs according to selectivity of the beta blockers.
In contrast to our results for beta blockers, the findings for diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and 
calcium channel blockers suggest a beneficial role of these medications in relation to ovarian 
cancer survival. Our finding of an inverse relationship between history of hypertension and 
OS among those with hypertension only and among those with longer duration of 
hypertension prior to ovarian cancer diagnosis also suggests a potentially beneficial role of 
longer exposure to these antihypertensive medications. While this study is not able to 
disentangle the mechanisms for these associations, perhaps the use of diuretics, ACE 
inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers differentially alters the milieu within 
the tumor microenvironment, although the mechanisms of the latter are unclear.
It is also important to note that our findings are not consistent with the results of a recently 
published study by Huang et al. [64] that reported an increased risk of ovarian cancer among 
users of diuretics and no association for use of beta blocker. The appearance of the 
discrepancy in findings for ovarian cancer risk and survival could be because diuretics may 
have different influence on the processes of ovarian cancer initiation and progression. It 
could also be because of differences in populations that realize the protective benefit of 
diuretics and those that develop ovarian cancer in spite of the protective benefits of diuretics.

 Finally, while an earlier study demonstrated that antidiabetic medications, metformin in 
particular, were associated with improved ovarian cancer survival [58], we found that intake 
of oral antidiabetic medications was associated with increased risk of death, HR = 1.28; 95% 
CI = 1.05–1.55. In our study, we were not able to examine the metformin association 
separately from that of the other oral antidiabetic drugs because of the relatively small 
number of patients who reported taking metformin. The increased risk of death among those 
who reported taking oral antidiabetic medications observed in our study could be explained 
by the fact that the use of these medications may be associated with more severe disease 
compared to those who did not report taking these medications. Our observation of increased 
mortality among diabetic patients using antidiabetic medications further supports this 
speculation.
In the analysis of our results, the strengths and weaknesses of the study need to be 
considered. The main advantage of the current study is its large sample size that allowed the 
examination of associations by histological subtypes of ovarian cancer as well as of the roles 
of potential effect modifiers, including the use of antihypertensive medications. We were 
also able to determine an impact of hypertension and diabetes on survival rather than only an 
association between a combined index of comorbidity and ovarian cancer survival as has 
been done in earlier studies.
There are also limitations of this study that are important to consider. Although almost all of 
our contributing data came from case–control studies, differences in methods existed 
between them. In particular, exposure assessments differed between the studies, including 
the year of the assessment. Practice patterns and treatment strategies for hypertension have 
changed over time [65]. We tried to address this situation by stratifying patients according to 
year of interview, prior to 2003 compared to 2003 and thereafter, when the guidelines for 
prevention and management of hypertension had changed [53]. There was no appreciable 
change in the results in the two time periods. Another limitation is that we were not able to 
restrict our analyses to cases who died of ovarian cancer since, in our study population, the 
information on cause of death was available for a limited number of patients. However, 
among cases with a known cause of death, 94.5% of patients died from ovarian cancer, 
which is very similar to the percentage of cases who died of this disease reported in other 
OCAC survival studies [66, 67]. Therefore, we could assume that, for OS, our results 
approximate ovarian cancer survival fairly well.
A further limitation is that, while we had information regarding the presence of 
comorbidities, we did not have data regarding disease severity. For instance, diabetes, 
particularly type II diabetes, is a heterogeneous disease comprising various degrees of 
hyperglycemia and resistance to insulin [68]. Our necessarily simplified dichotomization of 
exposures could have attenuated the estimates of underlying associations. Although we 
attempted to address this limitation by creating a composite variable representing diabetes 
severity, we were still not able to capture the complexity of this particular disease. 
Additionally, we utilized self-report of disease status or information obtained from medical 
records rather than direct physiologic measures of blood pressure or of fasting glucose. Self-
report of co-occurring diseases could have resulted in some exposure misclassification, 
though likely of non-differential nature. Moreover, some residual confounding may be

 possible because of our inability to assess the influence of post-diagnostic treatment of 
ovarian cancer patients. Even though the recommended initial chemotherapy regimen is 
standard [69], therapy may be individualized based on clinical characteristics of the patients 
and response to treatment. We were also not able to account for the possible use of 
additional medications as prophylactic measures to prevent complications of chemotherapy, 
particularly thromboembolic events. There could also be residual confounding because 
unmeasured factors could have a different impact among various histologic subtypes [70]. 
This confounding could have been explained in these subtype-specific results [70]. Finally, 
our findings could be the result of multiple testing.
In summary, we found that history of diabetes was associated with increased risk of death 
among ovarian cancer patients. This finding contributes to the current knowledge of the role 
of diabetes in influencing the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients [7, 11, 13]. This 
observation may be particularly important in the context of a growing number of individuals 
with diabetes, a disease that may affect the treatment of ovarian cancer. Moreover, our 
observation of an inverse association between history of hypertension and risk of 
progression among patients with endometrioid ovarian carcinomas suggests the importance 
of further studies to examine the mechanisms underlying this finding and investigate the 
difference of tumor microenvironment among various histologic subtypes. Understanding of 
the mechanisms for these observations could provide insight regarding treatment. More 
importantly, integration of the full clinical profile for ovarian cancer patients may be 
essential in understanding the factors related to their overall morbidity and mortality.
