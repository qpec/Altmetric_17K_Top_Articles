IMPORTANCE In recent decades, the global rates of cesarean delivery have rapidly increased.
Nonetheless, the influence of cesarean deliveries on surgical complications later in life has
been understudied.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether previous cesarean delivery increases the risk of
reoperation, perioperative and postoperative complications, and blood transfusion when
undergoing a hysterectomy later in life.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This registry-based cohort study used data from Danish
nationwide registers on all women who gave birth for the first time between January 1, 1993,
and December 31, 2012, and underwent a benign, nongravid hysterectomy between January
1, 1996, and December 31, 2012. The dates of this analysis were February 1 to June 30, 2016.
EXPOSURE Cesarean delivery.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Reoperation, perioperative and postoperative
complications, and blood transfusion within 30 days of a hysterectomy.
RESULTS Of the 7685 women (mean [SD] age, 40.0 [5.3] years) who met the inclusion
criteria, 5267 (68.5%) had no previous cesarean delivery, 1694 (22.0%) had 1 cesarean
delivery, and 724 (9.4%) had 2 or more cesarean deliveries. Among the 7685 included
women, 3714 (48.3%) had an abdominal hysterectomy, 2513 (32.7%) had a vaginal
hysterectomy, and 1458 (19.0%) had a laparoscopic hysterectomy. In total, 388 women
(5.0%) had a reoperation within 30 days after a hysterectomy. Compared with women having
vaginal deliveries, fully adjusted multivariable analysis showed that the adjusted odds ratio of
reoperation for women having 1 previous cesarean delivery was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.03-1.68), and
the adjusted odds ratio was 1.35 (95% CI, 0.96-1.91) for women having 2 or more cesarean
deliveries. Perioperative and postoperative complications were reported in 934 women
(12.2%) and were more frequent in women with previous cesarean deliveries, with adjusted
odds ratios of 1.16 (95% CI, 0.98-1.37) for 1 cesarean delivery and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.02-1.65) for 2
or more cesarean deliveries. Blood transfusion was administered to 195 women (2.5%).
Women having 2 or more cesarean deliveries had an adjusted odds ratio for receiving blood
transfusion of 1.93 (95% CI, 1.21-3.07) compared with women having no previous cesarean
delivery.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Women with at least 1 previous cesarean delivery face an
increased risk of complications when undergoing a hysterectomy later in life. The results
support policies and clinical efforts to prevent cesarean deliveries that are not medically
indicated.

Thehighprevalenceofhysterectomylaterinlifemakesthis
procedure a useful proxy for investigating long-term surgical
complications associated with previous cesarean delivery. In
2015, the prevalence of benign hysterectomy in Denmark was
about 10%.11 Approximately 6000 hysterectomies are per-
formed per year in Denmark, and 80% of these have a benign
indication.11 The results of previous studies12,13 on the effect
of cesarean deliveries on subsequent hysterectomies suggest
that a prior cesarean delivery may be related to lower urinary
tractinjuries,increasedintraoperativeandpostoperativeblood
transfusion, and readmission within 30 days of a hysterec-
tomy. However, these studies are limited to single-institution
investigations. To our knowledge, the population influence of
long-term surgical complications from cesarean deliveries has
not been evaluated using a nationwide cohort.
The aim of this study was to investigate the association of
previous cesarean delivery with the risk of reoperation, surgi-
cal complications, and blood transfusion within 30 days after
a hysterectomy later in life. We hypothesized that women with
previous cesarean delivery may have an increased risk of re-
operation and perioperative and postoperative complications
when undergoing a benign hysterectomy. The Danish National

Methods
In this registry-based study, we established a cohort that in-
cluded all Danish women who gave birth for the first time
between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2012, and under-
went a benign, nongravid hysterectomy between January 1,
1996, and December 31, 2012. The dates of this analysis were
February 1 to June 30, 2016. Since 1968, all Danish residents
have been assigned a personal identification number and
registered in the Danish Civil Registration System.14 The per-
sonal identification number links all information about an in-
dividual across numerous nationwide registers. We aggre-
gated data from the Danish National Patient Register,15 the
RegisterofMedicinalProductsStatistics,16andtheIncomeSta-
tistics Register.17 Diagnoses are coded according to the World
Health Organization’
s International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision from 1994
onward and the International Statistical Classification of Dis-
eases, Eighth Revision before 1994. Surgical procedures are
coded in the Danish National Patient Register using the Nor-
dic Classification of Surgical Procedures from 1996 onward. In-
formation about all medical prescriptions dispensed at Dan-
ish pharmacies is coded using the World Health Organization’
s
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System.
The cohort was identified from the Danish National Pa-
tient Register using diagnosis codes for vaginal birth and sur-
gerycodesforcesareandeliveryandtotalhysterectomy(eTable
1 in the Supplement). We included all women who had a hys-
terectomy after 1995, when the registries implemented the use
of the Nordic Classification of Surgical Procedures codes, and
had given birth after 1992, when the registries first specified
mode of delivery. Because we cannot determine if women had
a vaginal delivery or a cesarean delivery before 1992, we ex-
cluded all women with a delivery before this date. Further-
more, we excluded women who had a hysterectomy during
the postpartum period, defined as 42 days or less after giving
birth, and women who had a hysterectomy due to cancer in
the female genital tract.
Ethics

Retrospective studies using the Danish registries do not re-
quire individual informed consent. The study was carried out
in the research environment in Statistics Denmark, a state
organization that enables administrative registries to be
combined for research, while keeping personally identifiable
information encrypted.18,19

Key Points
Question Does previous cesarean delivery increase the risk of
reoperation, perioperative and postoperative complications, and
blood transfusion when undergoing a benign hysterectomy later in
life?
Findings This registry-based cohort study of 7685 women
indicates that women having a previous cesarean delivery are
more likely to require reoperation and experience surgical
complications after undergoing a benign hysterectomy compared
with women having a previous vaginal birth.
Meaning The increased risk of reoperation and complications
related to hysterectomy later in life supports policies and clinical
efforts to prevent cesarean deliveries that are not medically
indicated.

 the following: age at the time of hysterectomy, parity, comor-
bidities (type 1 and type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease,
previous breast cancer or colon cancer, pelvic inflammatory
disease, and endometriosis), previous abdominal surgery
(intra-abdominal gynecological, abdominal, and urological
surgical procedures), time between last delivery and hyster-
ectomy, route of hysterectomy, and indication for hyster-
ectomy. We divided parity into 1, 2, and more than 2 live
births.
The route of hysterectomy was divided into the follow-
ing 3 groups: abdominal, vaginal, and laparoscopic (includ-
ing robotic) (eTable 1 in the Supplement). We calculated
individual income during the year the woman had a hyster-
ectomy as a proxy for her socioeconomic status. Individual
income was calculated from the household income included
in the Income Statistics Registry and was divided by 1.5 if
the woman shared her household with another person to
account for shared fixed expenditures.20 The income was
indexed to 2009 to adjust for inflation, and women were
stratified into quartiles according to their adjusted indi-
vidual income.
We identified the hospitalization associated with the hys-
terectomy by admission and discharge dates on either side of
the surgery date and obtained the indications for the hyster-
ectomy from diagnosis codes from that hospitalization. More
than one benign indication was possible.
Outcomes
The preselected primary outcome was reoperation within
30 days of a hysterectomy. All registered surgical codes rel-
evant for reoperation within 30 days of the hysterectomy
were detected and sorted (eTable 1 in the Supplement). The
secondary outcomes were operative complications and
blood transfusion within 30 days of the hysterectomy. We
defined complications as bleeding or hematomas, infection,
perioperative lesions, wound rupture and adhesions, acute
cystitis, disorders of the genitourinary system, and deep
vein thrombosis.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline comparison of categorical data was performed with
χ2 tests and continuous data with analyses of variance. Cor-
relations between patient characteristics and outcomes were
examined with linear logistic regression models. The crude
models contain the outcome and number of cesarean deliv-
eries. The adjusted models controlled for age at the time of
hysterectomy, individual income, diabetes, hypertension, car-
diovascular disease, breast cancer and colon cancer, previ-
ous abdominal surgery, time between last delivery and
hysterectomy, and route of hysterectomy. The following in-
teractions with cesarean delivery were selected before analy-
sis: age at the time of hysterectomy, individual income, dia-
betes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular
disease, previous cancer, previous abdominal surgery, and
route of hysterectomy. No interactions were significant. A sen-
sitivity analysis was performed that excluded all women with
previous abdominal surgery.
We used statistical software (SAS, version 9.4; SAS Insti-
tute Inc) for data management and another software package
(R, version 3.2.2; R Core Team21) for analyses. Statistical sig-
nificance was determined by 2-sided P < .005.
Results
A flowchart of patient selection is shown in Figure 1. We in-
cluded 7685 women who had a hysterectomy, of whom 5267
had no previous cesarean delivery, 1694 had 1 cesarean deliv-
ery, and 724 had 2 or more cesarean deliveries.
Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. The mean (SD)
age at the time of hysterectomy was 40.0 (5.3) years. Women
with 2 or more cesarean deliveries were younger at the time of
hysterectomy, with mean (SD) ages of 38.2 (5.1) years com-
pared with 40.2 (5.3) years for women with no previous cesar-
eandeliveryand40.0(5.3)yearsforwomenwith1cesareande-
livery(P < .001).Comorbiditiesweremorefrequentinthegroup
of women with previous cesarean delivery compared with the
group of women without cesarean delivery. Women with pre-
vious cesarean delivery were more likely to have a history of
previous laparotomy for any indication at the time of hyster-
ectomy. The group of women with 2 or more cesarean deliver-
ies was also more likely to have a history of both laparoscopic
surgeryandlaparotomybeforethehysterectomycomparedwith
the other 2 groups. A sensitivity analysis that excluded women
who had previous abdominal surgery was performed, and only
minor insignificant changes in odds ratios were noted.
Among all women in the cohort, the route of hysterec-
tomy was laparotomy in 3714 (48.3%), vaginal in 2513 (32.7%),
and laparoscopic in 1458 (19.0%). The risk of laparotomy was
higher for women with 1 cesarean delivery and highest for
women with 2 or more cesarean deliveries. Vaginal hysterec-
tomies were more common in the group with no previous ce-
sarean delivery (2110 [40.1%]) compared with the group with
1 cesarean delivery (330 [19.5%]) and the group with 2 or more
cesarean deliveries (73 [10.1%]) (P < .001). Laparoscopic hys-
terectomy was more evenly distributed across the 3 groups,
accounting for approximately 20% of the hysterectomies in
each group (Table 1).
The indications for hysterectomy (10 456 in total) included
fibroids (2711 [25.9%]), menstrual disorder (eg, menorrhea,

 metrorrhagia, or polyps) (4219 [40.4%]), prolapse or inconti-
nence (594 [5.7%]), endometriosis (913 [8.7%]), precancerous
lesions (845 [8.1%]), and pain (eg, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia,
or abdominal or pelvic pain) (1174 [11.2%]). Menstrual disorder
was a more common indication in the groups with 1 and 2 or
more cesarean deliveries, while prolapse or incontinence was
a more common indication for women with no previous cesar-
ean delivery.
Reoperation
Overall, 5.0% (n = 388) of women had a reoperation within 30
days after a hysterectomy. The risk of reoperation increased
with the number of previous cesarean deliveries, with a fre-
quency of 4.4% (n = 234) for women with no previous cesar-
ean delivery compared with 6.2% (n = 105) for women with 1
cesarean delivery and 6.8% (n = 49) for women with 2 or more
cesarean deliveries (Table 2). Figure 2 shows the unadjusted
and adjusted odds ratios for reoperation dependent on the
number of cesarean deliveries. Fully adjusted multivariable
analysis showed that women with 1 cesarean delivery had an
unadjusted odds ratio of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.12-1.80) and an ad-
justed odds ratio of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.03-1.68) for reoperation,
while women with 2 or more cesarean deliveries had an un-
adjusted odds ratio of 1.56 (95% CI, 1.14-2.15) and an adjusted
odds ratio of 1.35 (95% CI, 0.96-1.91) for reoperation.
Compared with abdominal surgery, vaginal and laparo-
scopic routes of hysterectomy were associated with a de-
creased risk of reoperation, with adjusted odds ratios of 0.75
(95% CI, 0.58-0.96) for vaginal hysterectomy and 0.81 (95%
CI, 0.61-1.08) for laparoscopic hysterectomy (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). Statistical tests for interaction detected no in-
teraction between the number of cesarean deliveries and the
route of hysterectomy. Figure 3 shows the observed reopera-
tion rates in the 3 groups according to the route of hysterec-
tomy. Women with at least 1 cesarean delivery had an in-
creased frequency of reoperation independent of the route of
hysterectomy later in life.
Among 447 total reoperations, gynecological procedures
(265 [59.3%]) were the most common, followed by gastroin-
testinal procedures (97 [21.7%]), urological procedures (51
[11.4%]), and other procedures (34 [7.6%]) (Table 2). Gyneco-
logical procedures were more common for women with 2 or
more cesarean deliveries (158 [57.7%] for no previous cesar-
ean delivery, 72 [60.5%] for 1 cesarean delivery, and 35 [64.8%]
for ≥2 cesarean deliveries) (P = .005), but there were no sig-
nificant differences between the 3 groups for gastrointestinal
procedures or urological procedures.
Perioperative and Postoperative Complications
Overall,934women(12.2%)experiencedatleast1surgicalcom-
plication within 30 days of the hysterectomy. Bleeding was the
most common complication, followed by infection and peri-
operative lesions (Table 2). Compared with women having no
previous cesarean deliveries, women having 1 cesarean deliv-
ery had an odds ratio of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.02-1.41) and an ad-
justed odds ratio of 1.16 (95% CI, 0.98-1.37) for complica-
tions, and women having 2 or more cesarean deliveries had an
odds ratio of 1.34 (95% CI, 1.07-1.67) and an adjusted odds

Surgical complications were more likely for laparoscopic hys-
terectomythanforabdominalhysterectomy(adjustedoddsra-
tio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59-0.83) and vaginal hysterectomy (ad-
justed odds ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57-0.84).
Blood Transfusion
Overall, 195 women (2.5%) received a blood transfusion
(Table 2). Women with 2 or more cesarean deliveries had an
increased risk of needing blood transfusion, with an odds ra-
tio of 1.48 (95% CI, 0.97-2.28) and an adjusted odds ratio of
1.93 (95% CI, 1.21-3.07) compared with women having no pre-
vious cesarean delivery (Figure 2). Previous laparoscopic sur-
geryandlaparoscopicrouteofhysterectomyalsoincreasedthe
riskforbloodtransfusion,withadjustedoddsratiosof1.33(95%
CI, 0.96-1.82) and 1.70 (95% CI, 1.19-2.43), respectively (eTable
2 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Our results show that previous cesarean delivery increases the
risk of reoperation and perioperative and postoperative com-
plications among women undergoing a benign hysterectomy
later in life. Compared with women having only vaginal de-
liveries, women with 1 cesarean delivery had a 31.1% in-
creased risk of reoperation after a hysterectomy, while women
with 2 or more cesarean deliveries had a 38% increased risk
of reoperation after a hysterectomy.

 adjust for numerous potential confounders. Data from these
registers have been found to hold detailed information of high
validity,15,19 and data were collected independent of this study,
thus reducing the risk of information bias. We were able to
measure several specific surgical complications, such as bleed-
ing, infection, and perioperative lesions. While previous in-
vestigations have examined hospital readmission rates, this
measure was not included in the present study because many
complications not requiring surgery are managed at outpa-
tient clinics in Denmark; therefore, hospital readmission rates
may underestimate the actual rates of complications after a
hysterectomy.
Ourstudyislimitedbyitsobservationaldesign,whichdoes
not allow for elimination of all potential confounding factors;
only known confounders can be adjusted for and only to the
extent that they can be accurately measured and are avail-
able in the national registers. Therefore, residual confound-
ing may persist. It should be noted that we did not have ac-
cess to data on body mass index: a low or high body mass index
increases the risk for surgical complications, such as bleed-
ing and infection.22 However, we were able to control for obe-
sity-associated factors, such as hypertension23 and diabetes.24
In addition, small-bowel obstruction, a common postopera-
tive complication, was absent from our data set. This absence
may have led to underreporting of the association of cesar-
ean delivery with surgical complications after a hysterec-
tomy later in life.
In our study, the registers limited our sample to women
who gave birth after 1992 and had a hysterectomy after 1995.
Therefore, we were only able to include women who had a hys-
terectomy within 19 years of their first birth. Our cohort is thus
younger than the median age for benign hysterectomy in Den-
mark (40.0 years vs 48 years for all benign hysterectomies in
Denmark in 2011).25 This limitation too may have led to un-
derreporting of the association of cesarean delivery with sur-
gical risks later in life. Furthermore, the Danish National Pa-
tient Register does not contain detailed information on the
deliveries or the surgical procedures (ie, gestational age, use
ofmedications,indicationforcesareandelivery,operatingtime,
hospital level, or complications that were treated by a general
practitioner).
Interpretation
Our results indicate that women with previous cesarean de-
livery more frequently needed unplanned reoperation within
30 days of a hysterectomy. This effect may be due to the risk
of intra-abdominal adhesions, which increases with the
number of cesarean deliveries.26 The adhesions may compli-
cate future surgery, leading to longer operating time and an in-
creased risk of adverse events, which could result in reopera-
tions. Besides the physical risks and emotional stress of having
to undergo another operation, reoperations often are fol-
lowed by treatment in intensive care units, which may in-
duce anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress among the
affected women.27
The set of complications identified in our data aligns well
with those reported by Lee et al13 as the indications for read-
mission after a benign hysterectomy in a tertiary care aca-
demic medical center in the United States. While our study
showed a 16% to 29.6% increased risk of experiencing at least
1 complication among women with at least 1 previous cesar-
ean delivery, Lee et al found that the risk for readmission was
more than doubled. In both studies, bleeding and infection
were the most common complications.
In our study population consisting of women with at
least 1 childbirth and a benign hysterectomy, the cesarean
delivery rate was 31.5% compared with 21% in the general
population. This finding may indicate that women with
cesarean delivery are at higher risk of having a hysterec-
tomy later in life. Due to the study design, our study does
not allow conclusions as to the cause of this observation;
however, we suggest that cesarean delivery and hysterec-
tomy may have promoters in common (eg, poorer gyneco-
logical health) or that factors caused by cesarean delivery
per se are involved (eg, chronic pain, bleeding disorders,
adenomyosis, and adhesions).
The risk for all complications was only slightly greater for
women having 2 or more cesarean deliveries compared with
women having only 1 cesarean delivery. This small relative in-
fluence may be explained by the fact that the women with 2
ormorecesareandeliverieswereyoungerthanthewomenwith
only 1 previous cesarean delivery.
We also found that having a previous cesarean delivery in-
creased a woman’
s risk of undergoing open surgery for a be-
nign hysterectomy. Earlier investigations have shown that
minimallyinvasivesurgerybenefitsthepatientcomparedwith
open surgery with regard to shorter recovery time, less pain,
and smaller incisions.28 Whether vaginal hysterectomy is an
appropriate route of surgery for women with previous cesar-
ean deliveries is a topic of debate due to concerns about the
increased risk of bladder injuries and decreased uterine mo-
bility in the setting of anterior wall adhesions.29-31 Vaginal hys-
terectomy may also be more challenging because of de-
creased mobility of the uterus from the adhesions after
cesarean deliveries.
This study adds to the existing knowledge on long-term
influences of cesarean delivery. Our results imply that infor-
mation on long-term associations should be made more read-
ily available to women, clinicians, and policymakers and sug-
gest that decisions on cesarean delivery should take into
account not only immediate maternal and neonatal influ-
ences but also women’
s health in the long term, including an
increasedriskofreoperationandcomplicationsassociatedwith
surgery later in life.
Conclusions
Having a previous cesarean delivery significantly increased
the risk of reoperation, perioperative and postoperative
complications, and blood transfusion among women under-
going a hysterectomy later in life. Furthermore, cesarean
delivery increased a woman’
s risk of open surgery for a sub-
sequent hysterectomy. The results support policies and
clinical efforts to prevent cesarean deliveries that are not
medically indicated.
