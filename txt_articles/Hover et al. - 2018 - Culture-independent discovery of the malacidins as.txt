Despite the wide availability of antibiotics, infectious diseases 
remain a leading cause of death worldwide1. In the absence of 
new therapies, mortality rates due to untreatable infections 
are predicted to rise more than tenfold by 2050. Natural 
products (NPs) made by cultured bacteria have been a major 
source of clinically useful antibiotics. In spite of decades of 
productivity, the use of bacteria in the search for new antibi-
otics was largely abandoned due to high rediscovery rates2,3. 
As only a fraction of bacterial diversity is regularly culti-
vated in the laboratory and just a fraction of the chemistries 
encoded by cultured bacteria are detected in fermentation 
experiments, most bacterial NPs remain hidden in the global 
microbiome. In an effort to access these hidden NPs, we have 
developed a culture-independent NP discovery platform that 
involves sequencing, bioinformatic analysis and heterologous 
expression of biosynthetic gene clusters captured on DNA 
extracted from environmental samples. Here, we describe 
the application of this platform to the discovery of the mala-
cidins, a distinctive class of antibiotics that are commonly 
encoded in soil microbiomes but have never been reported in 
culture-based NP discovery efforts. The malacidins are active 
against multidrug-resistant pathogens, sterilize methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin infections in an animal 
wound model and did not select for resistance under our 
 
laboratory conditions.
Calcium-dependent antibiotics are a small family of N-acylated 
cyclic peptides that require calcium for antibacterial activity. 
Known members of this family contain a conserved Asp-X-Asp-
Gly motif that is thought to facilitate calcium binding4–6. One 
example, daptomycin, has proved useful clinically in the treatment 
of multidrug-resistant bacteremia. Calcium-dependent antibiotics 
were of particular interest to us because individual family members 
have been shown to have discrete modes of action, targeting either 
cell wall biosynthesis or cell membrane integrity. Given these dif-
ferences in modes of action, we hypothesized that the conserved 
 
Asp-X-Asp-Gly calcium-binding motif might be indicative of a 
broader collection of uncharacterized, bacterially encoded antibi-
otics with diverse mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential.
To test this hypothesis, we undertook a sequence-guided 
screen of diverse soils for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that 
encode calcium-binding motifs. Due to the complexity of soil 
metagenomes, it remains challenging to shotgun sequence deep 
enough to generate data that are broadly useful for BGC discov-
ery7. We have developed sequencing strategies that rely on the 
barcoding of biosynthetic genes using degenerate polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) primers to parse mixtures of BGCs pres-
ent in environmental samples7,8. In this approach, primers target-
ing conserved NP biosynthetic genes are used to generate PCR 
amplicon pools containing homologous genes from BGCs present 
in an environmental DNA (eDNA) sample (Fig. 1a). Individual 
next-generation sequencing reads derived from these amplicons 
 
(NP sequence tags, NPSTs) are used to predict BGCs present in 
a sample by comparing them to a database of sequences from 
characterized BGCs. This analysis is carried out using the bioin-
formatics platform eSNaPD (environmental Surveyor of Natural 
Product Diversity: http://esnapd2.rockefeller.edu) that was devel-
oped to evaluate metagenome-derived NPSTs8,9.
Known calcium-dependent antibiotics are biosynthesized by 
non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). Accordingly, we used 
primers targeting NRPS adenylation domains (ADs) to track this 
family of NPs across diverse soil microbiomes. For this study, and as 
part of our ongoing soil metagenome-driven NP discovery efforts, 
we expanded our soil collection to more than 2,000 soils from eco-
logically and geographically diverse environments8. Even using 
a conservative estimate of 103 unique bacterial species per gram 
of soil2, we expect the diversity of bacteria present in this collec-
tion to rival that of the largest culture collections. Initially, prim-
ers targeting NRPS ADs were used to screen eDNA isolated from 
small aliquots of each soil to identify environments predicted to 
 
contain gene clusters that encode for unidentified calcium- 
dependent antibiotics.
Three-quarters of sequenced soils had NPSTs that mapped to 
at least one AD from a known calcium-dependent antibiotic BGC 
(Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Fig. 1). Only 13% of these identified 
NPSTs cluster at ≥ 
95% nucleotide identity to ADs found in charac-
terized calcium-dependent antibiotics and less than 30% of them 
are found in more than one soil metagenome. Taken together, this 
indicates that the majority of lipopeptides encoded by the global 
soil metagenome are probably uncharacterized and that even 
within our large soil collection, we have captured only a fraction of 
the biosynthetic diversity that exists within the calcium-dependent 
 
antibiotic family.

Phylogenetic analysis of AD sequences from characterized cal-
cium-dependent antibiotics indicated that the domain responsible 
for incorporating the first aspartic acid (Asp4) in the conserved Asp-
X-Asp-Gly motif most closely mapped to functional divergence of 
BGCs in this family (Supplementary Fig. 1b). We, therefore, focused 
on eSNaPD data for this domain to track calcium-dependent anti-
biotic BGCs. A phylogenetic tree derived from tags associated with 
this domain showed numerous clades not associated with known 
BGCs, indicating the existence of uncharacterized calcium-depen-
dent antibiotics in soil microbiomes. One distinct, eDNA-specific 
clade was found in 19% of metagenomes (Fig. 1b), suggesting that 
the BGCs associated with these tags belong to an abundant and 
yet uncharacterized family of antibiotics, which we have called the 
malacidins (metagenomic acidic lipopeptide antibiotic-cidins).
To recover a complete malacidin BGC for use in heterologous 
expression studies, we retrieved from our soil archive a desert soil 
(DFD0097) that was rich in NPSTs from the malacidin branch 
of the AD phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1c). Employing standard soil 
metagenome cloning methods, a saturating cosmid library was 
constructed using DNA extracted from DFD0097 soil10. This 
20-million-membered library was archived as purified cosmid 
DNA and Escherichia coli glycerol stocks arrayed in 96-well for-
mat, with each library well containing ~20,000 unique clones10,11. 
To expedite the recovery of BGCs, each well of the library was 
individually screened by PCR using the barcoded AD-targeting 
primers used to profile soils. Library-derived NPST data were 
analysed by eSNaPD to generate a map of BGC information across 
the arrayed library.
Using this BGC prediction map, overlapping cosmid clones pre-
dicted to contain the malacidin BGC were recovered from the library. 
Sequencing and in silico analysis of these clones suggested that the 
malacidin BGC spanned 72 kilobases across 3 cosmids (DFD0097-
644, DFD0097-735 and DFD0097-388) (Fig. 2a and Supplementary 
Table 1, GenBank Accession KY654519). For the purposes of 
heterologous expression, these three overlapping cosmids were 
assembled into a contiguous fragment of DNA using transformation- 
associated recombination in yeast and the E. coli:yeast:Streptomyces 
shuttle vector, pTARa (Fig. 2b)11. The resulting bacterial artificial 
chromosome (DFD0097-644:735:388) and the empty pTARa vector 
were separately conjugated into Streptomyces albus J1074. Extracts 
from cultures of S. albus harbouring DFD0097-644:735:388 were 
found to exhibit antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus 
and contain clone-specific metabolites (Fig. 2c,d). The major clone-
specific metabolites, malacidin A and B, were isolated from cul-
tures of S. albus DFD0097-644:735:388 and their structures were 
elucidated using a combination of mass spectrometry and NMR 
data. The malacidin structures were supported by a detailed bio-
informatic analysis of the BGC (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Figs. 2–25, 
Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 and Supplementary Discussion).
The malacidins are 10-membered cyclic lipopeptides that differ 
only by a methylene on the branch at the terminus of their lipid 
tails. Their peptide cores include four non-proteinogenic amino 
acids (Fig. 2e). Calcium-dependent antibiotics characterized 
from culture-based discovery programmes contain larger, 11- to 
13-amino-acid rings and completely distinct peptide sequences 
(Supplementary Fig. 24). The malacidins do not contain the canon-
ical Asp-X-Asp-Gly calcium-binding motif found in known cal-
cium-dependent antibiotics4. They lack the variable spacer residue 
found in this canonical motif and contain an ASP-OH, suggesting 
that they either no longer bind calcium or may represent a different 
calcium-binding motif4–6. To determine the requirement of calcium 
for the antibacterial activity of the malacidins, we tested for anti-
biosis against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
across a range of calcium concentrations. In these assays, we saw a 
clear dependence on calcium for antibiosis, indicating that although 
the malacidins do not contain a canonical Asp-X-Asp-Gly motif,

Fig. 1 | using a culture-independent strategy for the discovery of calcium-dependent antibiotics from the global microbiome. a, (i) Degenerate PCR 
primers targeting the conserved regions of adenylation domains found in non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes were used to generate amplicons from 
an arrayed collection of eDNA isolated from 2,000 unique soils. The reads from these next-generation sequenced amplicons (NPSTs) were analysed 
by eSNaPD. (ii) A desert soil rich in AD NPSTs from the previously unknown malacidin clade was used to build an arrayed cosmid library. Cosmids 
harbouring all fragments of a targeted BGC were assembled and integrated into a heterologous host for production, extraction and characterization. b, AD 
NPSTs identified by the eSNaPD analysis to be evolutionarily related to the conserved Asp4 ADs of known calcium-dependent antibiotics were used to 
phylogenetically map the unexplored clades of this larger family across all tested soil microbiomes. The subfamilies of calcium-dependent antibiotics and 
their relative abundance are illustrated on the phylogenetic tree by colour and percentage. Across all sampled soil metagenomes, the malacidin antibiotic-
clade represents 19% of the NPSTs, and 59% of calcium-dependent antibiotic tags originate from unexplored branches. c, Geospatial distribution of

their antibacterial activity remains calcium-dependent (Fig. 3a). 
 
Similar experiments using cations other than calcium showed no 
antibiosis (Supplementary Fig. 26). The malacidins are broadly 
active against Gram-positive bacteria including multidrug-resis-
tant pathogens and bacteria resistant to mechanistically diverse, 
clinically used antibiotics (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 4). 
As the most common form of Staphylococcus infection occurs on 
the skin, we elected to test the in vivo efficacy of the malacidins 
using an animal wound model. Topical administration of malaci-
din A was successful in sterilizing MRSA-infected wounds in a rat 
model (Fig. 3b). At 24 and 72 h post infection, malacidin A treat-
ment resulted in no observed bacterial burdens in the wounds. 
The vehicle-treated controls had an average of 5.5 log and 7.0 log 
of MRSA at 24 h and 72 h, respectively (Kruskal–Wallis P value < 
0.0001). Likewise, the malacidins showed no significant toxicity or 
haemolytic activity against mammalian cells at the highest concen-
trations tested (100–250 µ 
g ml−1, > 
100 minimal inhibitory concen-
tration, MIC) (Supplementary Fig. 27 and Supplementary Table 3). 
 
Unlike daptomycin, which is unable to treat severe community-
acquired pneumonia due to loss of activity in the presence of 
pulmonary surfactants12, malacidin A does not share this liability 
 
(Fig. 3c). Our experimental efforts to induce resistance to malacidin 
in the laboratory have so far been unsuccessful. Even after 20 days 
of exposure to sub-lethal levels of malacidin A, we did not detect 
any malacidin-resistant S. aureus (Fig. 3d). Whether resistance 
 
can arise through horizontal gene transfer from environmental 
bacteria remains to be seen.
Characterized calcium-dependent antibiotics function by one of 
two distinct modes of action (Fig. 4a). Daptomycin displays rapid 
bactericidal activity by binding cytoplasmic membrane phosopho-
lipids and oligomerizing in the membrane13,14. This affects phospho-
lipid synthesis and overall membrane fluidity, ultimately leading to 
decreased membrane integrity and cell death15. The potent anti-
bacterial activity of friulimicin and its structural relatives is due 
to inhibition of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis through binding of 
the lipid II precursor, undecaprenyl phosphate (C55-P)16,17. As the 
malacidins are structurally distinct from other calcium-dependent 
antibiotics, we sought to determine whether they function by one 
of these known mechanisms or a third distinct mode of action. We 
first assessed the effect of malacidin on membrane integrity (Fig. 4b 
and Supplementary Fig. 28). No membrane leakage was observed 
when S. aureus cells pretreated with SYTOX green or DiBAC4 were 
exposed to either daptomycin or malacidin in the absence of calcium 
supplementation. With the addition of calcium, daptomycin-treated 
 
S. aureus showed a rapid increase in fluorescence, which is indica-
tive of a loss of membrane integrity. Malacidin, however, did not 
demonstrate the same effect, indicating that malacidin and dapto-
mycin have distinct modes of action.
As seen with friulimicin and other cell-wall-intermediate bind-
ing antibiotics, S. aureus treated with malacidin accumulates the cell

Fig. 2 | Maladicin biosynthesis, heterologous expression and structure. a,b, The malacidin BGC was recovered on three overlapping cosmid clones (a) 
and assembled from these three overlapping clones in yeast using transformation-associated recombination (TAR) (b). The resulting BAC was integrated 
into the S. albus genome for heterologous expression studies. c, A representative HPLC analysis of crude extracts derived from cultures of  
S. albus transformed with the malacidin BGC shows the presence of BGC-specific small molecules. The two primary malacidin peaks are highlighted  
with an asterisk. d, Unlike crude extracts of the S. albus host strain alone, only extracts from the S. albus harbouring the malacidin BGC showed 
antibacterial activity when applied to a lawn of S. aureus USA300. Both the HPLC analysis (c) and antibacterial activity (d) are representative of four 
independent fermentations. e, Malacidin A and B are cyclic lipopeptides containing eight-amino-acid macrocycles and polyunsaturated lipids. The 
malacidins do not contain the conserved DXDG motif seen in all known calcium-dependent antibiotics—incorporating a rare 3-hydroxyl aspartic acid 
(HyAsp, highlighted in violet) and lacking the spacer residue. Biosynthetic enzymes predicted to be involved in the production of non-proteinogenic 
amino acid (3-methyl aspartic acid, 4-methyl proline and 2,3-diamino 3-methyl propanoic acid) and fatty acid substrates required for the biosynthesis of 
the maladicins are shown and colour-coded according to their activities. Stereocentres in malacidin that were predicted bioinformatically, as opposed to 
through chemical and spectroscopic analysis, are denoted with an asterisk.

wall precursor undecaprenyl-N-acetylmuramic acid-pentapeptide 
 
(UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide) (Fig. 4c)16,17. This signalled that 
the target of malacidin, like that of friulimicin, lies downstream 
of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide formation. Surprisingly, in a thin-
layer chromatography (TLC) mobility shift assay, malacidin did 
not sequester C55-P, the target of friulimicin (Fig. 4d)16,17. Lipid II 
is the key downstream intermediate of MurNAc-pentapeptide. 
We therefore tested malacidin for lipid-II-binding activity. In this 
TLC-based mobility shift assay, we observed lipid-II-dependent 
disappearance of the malacidin band (Fig. 4d,e). Unlike previously 
characterized calcium-dependent antibiotics, malacidin neither 
depolarizes the membrane nor binds C55-P but instead appears to 
interact with lipid II in a calcium-dependent manner. Fortuitously, 
despite the fact that vancomycin also binds lipid II, the malacidins 
are active against both vancomycin-intermediate- and vancomycin- 
resistant pathogens.
The malacidins exhibited potent antibacterial activity against 
Gram-positive pathogens resistant to clinically used antibiotics, 
including the antibiotic of last resort vancomycin, and did not 
select for resistance in the laboratory under the conditions of 
our experiments. The discovery of the malacidins supports our 
hypothesis that the calcium-dependent antibiotics are a larger than 
previously thought family of NPs with low susceptibility to resis-
tance and diverse modes of action. Environmental microbes are in 
a continuous antibiotic arms race that is likely to select for antibi-
otic variants capable of circumventing existing resistance mecha-
nisms. The sequence-guided metagenomic discovery pipeline 
 
outlined here provides a means to interrogate complex environ-
mental metagenomes for these uncharacterized antibiotics by 
tracking NPSTs that differ from those associated with known 
antibiotic BGCs. While metagenome-based antibiotic discovery 
methods are still in their infancy, the scaling and automation of 
the pipeline described here should permit the systematic discov-
ery of NP antibiotics that have until now remained hidden in the 
global metagenome, providing a potentially powerful approach for 
combating antibiotic resistance.
Methods
NPST generation and sequencing. To add to the diversity of the 185 previously 
collected soil samples8,18, an additional 1,800 soils were collected for this study 
from sites throughout the United States. Crude eDNA was extracted from each of 
these following established protocols10,18. Briefly, 25 g of soil was heated (70 °C) in 
lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM EDTA, 1.5 M NaCl, 1% (w/v) CTAB, 2% 
(w/v) SDS, pH 8.0) for 2 h. Soil particulates were removed from the crude lysate 
by centrifugation, and eDNA was precipitated from the resulting supernatant 
with the addition of 0.7 volumes of isopropanol. Crude eDNA was collected by 
centrifugation, washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in TE. Crude eDNA 
was then spin-column-purified (PowerMax soil DNA kit) and employed as a 
template in PCR experiments targeting ADs as follows: AD fragments (~795 bp) 
were amplified using primers: 5′ 
-GCSTACSYSATSTACACSTCSGG-3′ and  
5′ 
-SASGTCVCCSGTSCGGTA-3′ 
. These primers are designed to recognize the 
conserved regions in NRPS ADs8,18. The 5′ ends of the primers were augmented 
with MiSeq sequencing adapters followed by unique 8 bp barcode sequences 
identifying the soil metagenome from which they were amplified. PCR 
conditions: 12 μ 
l reaction, 1 × Buffer G (Epicentre), 50 pmol of each primer, 2.5 
units Omni Klentaq polymerase (DNA Polymerase Technology) and 100 ng 
eDNA. Cycle conditions for AD amplification: 95 °C 4 min, (95 °C 30 s, 63.5 °C 
30 s, 72 °C 45 s) x 34 cycles, 72 °C 5 min. First-round amplicons contained 
incomplete Illumina adaptors and therefore required a second round of PCR

of Taq and 3 μ 
l of cleaned amplicon (50 ng to 100 ng). Amplification proceeded 
as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, 6 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 
45 s, and, finally, 72 °C for 5 min. Prior to sequencing, all PCR amplicons were 
quantified by gel electrophoresis and mixed in an equal molar ratio. The resulting 
pool was fluorometrically quantified with an HS D1000 ScreenTape (Agilent 
2200 TapeStation; Agilent Technologies) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq 
instrument using Reagent Kit v3 (MS-102-3003, Illumina).
Biosynthetic profiling of NPSTs. Amplicon sequences were analysed and 
organized using the eSNaPD (environmental Surveyor of Natural Product 
Diversity) web-based tool as previously described8,9,18. The NRPS ADs from 
sequenced and known calcium-dependent antibiotic gene clusters (daptomycin, 
friulimicin, CDA, laspartomycin, A54145 and taromycin) were added to the 
eSNaPD reference database of domains from annotated and functionally 
characterized natural product gene clusters. NPSTs whose closest relatives among 
all reference ADs were one of these known lipopeptide domains were identified 
and mapped to soil locations and/or library wells. This analysis, in brief, was 
completed as previously described19 by debarcoding samples using a paired-end 
2 × 8 bp barcode strategy. Debarcoded reads were filtered for quality and 240 bp 
of the forward reads, a single `N' spacer and 175 bp of the reverse-complemented 
reverse read were concatenated to generate a synthetic amplicon of 416 bp. The 
reads from each sample were clustered using UCLUST20 to generate the 95% 
identity centroid sequences (that is, NPST). Location information was used to 
map NPSTs back to soil collection locations and/or library wells. The forward 
read component (the first 240 bp) of each NPST was then searched using BlastN21 
against a manually curated database of NRPS AD sequences. NPSTs that returned 
one of the known calcium-dependent antibiotics as a top match were considered 
hits. The resulting set of unique hits was used to generate geographic and 
phylogenetic distribution figures. A multiple sequence alignment of all sequences 
was generated using MUSCLE22, and the resulting alignment file was used to 
generate a maximum-likelihood tree with FastTree23.
Construction and arraying of metagenomic cosmid libraries. eDNA cosmid 
libraries were constructed from soil using established protocols10. Briefly, crude 
eDNA was isolated from ~0.5 kg of soil as outlined above, and further purified by 
preparative agarose gel electrophoresis to yield pure high-molecular-weight eDNA. 
High-molecular-weight eDNA was blunt-ended (Epicentre, End-It), ligated into 
pWEB-TNC (Epicentre), packaged into lambda phage and transfected into  
E. coli EC100 (Epicentre). Following recovery, transfected cells were inoculated into 
8 ml LB with selective antibiotic (12.5 μ 
g ml−1 chloramphenicol) in 24-well plates 
at a density of ~25,000 clones per well and grown overnight. Matching glycerol 
stocks and cosmid DNA minipreps were prepared from each well, and arrayed as 
768 pools of ~25,000 unique cosmid clones. NPST data were prepared from each 
library pool by amplifying and sequencing ADs as described above.
Recovery of biosynthetic gene clusters from eDNA libraries. Calcium-dependent 
antibiotic-like NPST sequences identified within metagenomic libraries were 
automatically assigned to library wells by the barcode parsing functionality of 
the eSNaPD software package as described above. Specific primers targeting 
each unique sequence of interest were designed by hand. To recover single clones 
from library wells, a serial dilution PCR strategy18 was used as follows: library 
wells containing targets as 1 of ∼ 
25,000 unique cosmids were grown overnight to 
confluence in LB (12.5 μ 
g ml−1 chloramphenicol, 100 μ 
g ml−1 carbenicillin) and 
diluted to a concentration of 3,000 colony-forming units (CFUs) ml−1 as judged 
by OD600 nm. Then, 384-well plates were inoculated with 100 μ 
l (300 CFU) of the 
resulting dilution per well, grown to confluence, and screened using real-time PCR, 
to identify wells containing target clones as 1 of ∼ 
300 clones. Target positive wells 
were then diluted to a concentration of ∼ 
50 CFU ml−1 and the process was repeated 
to identify wells containing targets as 1 of ∼ 
5 clones. Five clone pools were then 
plated on solid medium, and target clones were identified by colony PCR.
In silico analysis of recovered gene clusters. Recovered single cosmid clones 
were pooled and sequenced using ion PGM technology. Reads were assembled 
into contigs using an assembler program, such as Newbler24. Overlapping cosmids 
spanning a single pathway were initially sequenced separately and subsequently 
assembled into larger contigs. Assembled contigs were then annotated 
using an in-house pipeline consisting of open-reading-frame predictions 
with MetaGeneMark25, BLAST search21 and AntiSMASH predictions26. The 
AntiSMASH predictions employ three prediction algorithms to call the amino acid 
substrate specificity of an adenylation domain (NRPSPredictor2, Stachelhaus code 
and Minowa). These amino acid predictions were used in the initial bioinformatic 
characterization of clusters to predict chemical structures. Putative functions 
for new tailoring enzymes in eDNA pathways were assigned on the basis of the 
predicted function of the closest characterized relative identified by Blast in NCBI.
Assembly of DFD0097-735 pTARa BAC for heterologous expression. For 
assembly of the DFD0097-735 pTARa bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), 
transformation-associated recombination (TAR) in yeast was employed11,27. 
Initially, the three overlapping cosmids (DFD0097-644, DFD0097-735 and 
DFD0097-388) containing the full biosynthetic pathway were digested and 
linearized with DraI. A custom E. coli:yeast:Streptomyces shuttle capture vector, 
pTARa, containing two 500 bp homology arms to the terminal overlapping  
cosmid clones was constructed as previously described11,27. This vector was 
subsequently linearized with PmeI and gel-purified. The linearized cosmids 
and capture vector were then co-transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
(BY4727 Δ 
dnl4) using a standard LiAc/ss carrier DNA/PEG yeast transformation 
protocol28. Briefly, yeast were grown overnight in 50 ml of YPD medium containing 
G418 (200 μ 
g ml−1) at 30 °C. In the morning, 2 ml of the overnight culture was 
reinoculated into 50 ml of fresh YPD medium containing G418 (200 μ 
g ml−1)

and grown for ∼ 
4 h (OD600 nm = 2.0). This culture was harvested by centrifugation 
(10 min, 3,200g), washed twice with sterile 4 °C water and resuspended in 1 ml of 
sterile 4 °C water. For each transformation 100 μ 
l of washed cells was transferred 
to a Microfuge tube. The cells were collected by centrifugation (30 s, 18,000g) and 
resuspended in a transformation mix containing 36 μ 
l of 1 M LiAc solution, 50 μ 
l  
of 2 mg ml−1 carrier DNA (salmon sperm DNA) solution, 240 μ 
l of 50% (wt/vol) 
PEG 3350 solution, and 34 μ 
l of Tris-EDTA containing 2 μ 
g of each cosmid and  
1 μ 
g of vector. This transformation mix was incubated at 42 °C for 40 min. Cells 
were then collected by centrifugation (30 s, 18,000g), resuspended in 100 μ 
l of water 
and plated on appropriate synthetic composite dropout medium agar plates. Agar 
plates were incubated at 30 °C until colonies appeared. Colonies were checked by 
PCR. DNA was isolated from PCR-positive yeast clones, transferred into E. coli 
ET12567/pUZ8002 cells and then moved into Streptomyces spp. by intergeneric 
conjugation for heterologous expression.
Heterologous expression. The assembled BAC, DFD0097-735 pTARa and an 
empty pTARa vector control were separately integrated into the chromosome 
of Streptomyces albus J1074. Spore suspensions of these recombinant strains 
were used to seed starter cultures in 50 ml trypticase soy broth (Oxoid). These 
cultures were grown for 48 h (30 °C/200 rpm) and 0.4 ml of the resulting 
confluent culture was used to inoculate 50 ml flasks of production medium, 
R5a medium: 100 g l−1 sucrose, 0.25 g l−1 K2SO4, 10.12 g l−1 MgCl2, 10.0 g l−1  
d-glucose, 0.1 g l−1 casamino acids, 21 g l−1 MOPS, 2 g l−1 NaOH, 40 μ 
g l−1  
ZnCl2, 20 μ 
g l−1 FeCl3 6H2O, 10 μ 
g l−1 MnCl2, 10 μ 
g l−1 (NH4)6Mo7O24 4H2O.  
Fifty-millilitre liquid cultures were grown in 125 ml baffled flasks (22 °C, 220 rpm) 
for 14 days.
Isolation of malacidin A and B. After 14 days, 4 l of cultures were combined,  
and mycelia were removed by centrifugation at 4,000g for 20 min. The mycelium-
free medium supernatant was applied to 150 g of pre-equilibrated Diaion HP-20 
resin packed in a column (40 × 220 mm). The HP-20 column was subsequently 
washed with 2 l of H2O, and then eluted with 2 l of 100% methanol. The methanolic 
elution was concentrated by rotary evaporation, and then combined with 2 g 
octadecyl-functionalized silica resin (Sigma-Aldrich) per 10 ml concentrate.  
This resin/concentrate mixture was dried overnight on a Savant Speedvac 
Concentrator (Thermo-Fisher). The dried loaded resin was used to dry-load a 
100 g Gold HP C18 column for medium-pressure reversed-phase chromatography 
(Teledyne Isco Combiflash Rf150). This chromatography was performed  
using a linear gradient of 0.1% acetic acid–acetonitrile from 10% to 100% 
over 20 min at 60 ml min−1. To identify column fractions containing active 
compound, aliquots of 10 ml fractions were analysed by ultra-performance 
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS). Fractions containing 
the malacidins were pooled, re-dried on resin, and subjected to a second-round 
medium-pressure, narrow-range reversed-phase chromatography. Using a 100 g 
Gold HP C18 column, chromatography was performed with a linear gradient  
of 0.1% acetic acid–acetonitrile from 30% to 60% over 20 min at 60 ml min−1.  
This enabled the initial separation of malacidin-A-containing and malacidin- 
B-containing fractions. Combined fractions containing either malacidin A or B 
were subsequently cleaned up individually using preparative high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC; XBridge Prep C18, 10 × 150 mM, 5 μ 
M, Agilent 
HPLC System) using a linear gradient of 0.1% trifloroacetic acid–acetonitrile  
from 30% to 50% over 30 min at a flow rate of 4 ml min−1. Malacidin A and B  
had a retention time of 12 min and 16 min, respectively. For analysis of  
purity and detection of fractions by UPLC–MS throughout the isolation  
process, 5 μ 
l was injected onto a UPLC–MS system (Waters Corporation) and 
analysed by a linear gradient of 0.1% formic acid–acetonitrile from 30% to 50% 
over 3.4 min.
Structural determination by NMR and ESI–MS/MS. See the Supplementary 
Discussion for details on structural determination. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were 
obtained at 600 and 150 MHz, respectively, on a Bruker Avance DMX600 NMR. 
Spectra were taken at 298 K using either 11.21 mM malacidin A or 7.92 mM 
malacidin B in 3.59 mM triethylamine in D2O, unless otherwise noted. The 
chemical shifts were referenced to the methyl group of triethylamine in  
D2O (δC 8.189, δH 1.292). For electrospray ionization with tandem mass 
spectrometry (ESI–MS/MS), samples in methanol were diluted 1:50 with 50% 
methanol/0.1% formic acid and infused (5 μ 
l min−1) for analysis by high-resolution 
(60,000 at m/z 200)/high-mass-accuracy MS, MS2 and MS3 (Fusion Lumos, 
ThermoFischer Scientific). In addition, each sample was diluted 1:1 with 0.1 M 
ammonium bicarbonate for propionylation of primary amines followed by a 1:25 
dilution in methanol/0.1% formic acid and analysis by ESI–MS, MS2 and MS3. 
Positive-ion ESI conditions: 3.9 kV, heated capillary set at 300 °C and sheath gas 
setting of ‘1’
. Both ion-trap-based collision-induced dissociation (CID) and beam-
type fragmentation (HCD) were used. For fragmentation experiments, ions were 
isolated using a window of 2.0 m/z.
Determination of absolute configuration of amino acids of malacidins. 
Malacidin A and B (0.5 mg) were dissolved in 6 N HCl (500 µ 
l) separately and 
heated at 115 °C for 10 h. For each antibiotic, four separate reactions were set up. 
After hydrolysis, the reaction mixtures were cooled in ice water for 5 min.  
The reaction solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The dried reaction was resuspended 
in 500 µ 
l of water and the water was evaporated in vacuo. This process was repeated 
three times. The hydrolysates, containing free amino acids, were dissolved in 100 µ 
l  
of 1 N NaHCO3. Either 100 µ 
l of l-FDAA (1-fluro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alanine 
amide) or 100 µ 
l of d-FDAA in acetone (10 mg ml−1) was added to each of the four 
vials and they were incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. To neutralize the reaction, 100 µ 
l  
of 2 N HCl was added to each reaction mixture. Reactions were then diluted with 
300 µ 
l of 50% acetonitrile/water. Five microlitres of each reaction mixture was 
analysed by liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry with 
a gradient solvent system (20%–60% acetonitrile/water with 0.1% formic acid 
over 40 min; flow rate 0.2 ml min−1) on the RP column (Thermo Acclaim 120, C18 
2.1 × 150 mm).
Microbial susceptibility assays. The malacidins were screened against a panel 
of assay strains and pathogenic bacteria as indicated in Supplementary Table 3.  
MIC assays were performed in duplicate in 96-well microtiter plates on the 
basis of the protocol recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards 
Institute29. All presented data are the average of at least three independent 
assays. Stock solutions of malacidin or daptomycin (2 mg ml−1 in H2O) were 
added to the first well in a row and serially diluted (twofold per transfer) 
across the microtiter plate. CaCl2 was supplemented to media at a final 
concentration of 15 mM and fetal bovine serum (ATCC) was added to media 
(1:10) to test the effect of serum. Overnight cultures of bacteria were diluted 
5,000-fold, and 50 μ 
l was used as an inoculum in each well. MIC values were 
determined by visual inspection after 18 h incubation (30 °C, static growth). 
For the enhanced calcium titration experiments, standard MIC assays were 
performed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) PFGE 
strain type USA300 in media supplemented with CaCl2 at: 25.0, 18.8, 14.1, 
7.03, 3.52, 2.50, 1.76, 0.880, 0.440, 0.250 and 0 mM. To assess the effects of 
monovalent and divalent cations on malacidin activity, standard MIC assays 
were performed with MRSA USA300 in media supplemented with 15 mM 
CaCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, ZnCl2, SrCl2, NaCl and KCl. To evaluate the effects of 
pulmonary surfactants on activity against a community-acquired pneumonia-
causing pathogen, standard MIC assays were performed with Streptococcus 
pneumoniae TCH8431 in media supplemented with both 15 mM CaCl2 and 
Survanta (beractant, Abbvie) at a final concentration of 5, 1, 0.5, 0.25 or 0% 
(volume/volume (v/v) per cent).
Mammalian cytotoxicity assays. Cytotoxicity against human cell lines  
was tested using an ATP release assay, CellTiter-Glo (Promega), according to  
the manufacturer’s instructions. HEK293 cells (293FT, Thermo Fisher  
Scientific, no. R700-07) and MRC5 cells (ATCC CCL-171) were grown in  
complete DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, and were inspected  
visually for authentification and tested for mycoplasma contamination using a 
MycoAlert detection kit (Lonza). Cells were grown to confluence, trypsinized, 
counted and plated in 384-well cell culture plates at an appropriate density  
(2,500 cells per well for HEK293 and 1000 cells per well for MRC5). The test 
compound was added 24 h later in the presence of calcium, and viability was 
determined after 4.5 h of incubation. Experiments were performed with biological 
replicates. Haemolytic activity was evaluated by a red blood cell disc diffusion 
assay. Twenty-microlitre stocks of malacidin A and Triton X-100 were infused  
on filter discs, dried completely and then overlaid on 5% sheep blood agar  
plates (Hardy Diagnostics). The plates were incubated for 24 h at 20 °C, and then 
checked for lysis.
Rat cutaneous wound infection model. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus strain MW2 was grown in Mueller Hinton broth at 37°C with shaking 
overnight. The culture was centrifuged, supernatant aspirated and the bacteria 
were gently washed once in sterile saline. The optical density was determined 
at 600 nm. The bacterial suspension was diluted to provide a challenge 
inoculum of approximately 500 CFU per wound in a volume of 0.05 ml in 
sterile 0.9% NaCl. The inoculum count was verified by viable counts on 
Mannitol Salt Agar plates spread with proper dilutions of the inoculum and 
incubated at 37 °C for 24–48 h. For the wound infection model, 8-week-old 
male (~200 g) Sprague Dawley rats were given two wounds each. Two rats 
were used at each time point (day 1 and day 3) for each treatment group 
for a total of 4 rats (8 wounds) per drug. This sample size was statistically 
calculated on the basis of previous in-house wound burden studies comparing 
vehicle-treated groups with antibiotic controls30. Rats were randomly selected 
into the treatment groups. To generate wounds, the rats were anaesthetized 
by intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg kg−1 ketamine + 
 10 mg kg−1 xylazine 
and the dorsal side of the rats was shaved with electrical clippers and 
then depilated with Nair. The exposed skin was wiped with betadine. Two 
symmetrical wounds were made on the dorsum of each rat using a 0.8-cm-
diameter disposable biopsy punch. Sterile polyurethane rings serving as wound 
chambers were placed over the fresh wounds and attached by surgical adhesive. 
After the wound creation, rats from each group were infected with 0.05 ml 
of the bacterial suspension for a final infection dose of 500 CFU per wound.

Wounds were covered with Tegaderm visible adhesive dressing, and the rats 
were rehydrated with physiological saline administered via intraperitoneal 
injection. The analgesic buprenorphine (0.05 mg kg−1) was administered to 
minimize pain during surgical recovery. At 30 min post infection, rats were 
given single daily topical treatments of vehicle (25 mM CaCl2 in sterile water), 
or 0.5 mg malacidin A or daptomycin suspended in 25 mM CaCl2, and the 
wounds were covered in fresh Tegaderm dressing. At 1 day and 3 days post 
infection, the rats were humanely euthanized and wounds were excised and 
assessed for bacterial burdens by plating on MSA. Rats were observed twice 
daily for morbidity and possible signs of acute toxicity. Abnormal clinical  
signs were recorded if observed. Rats were housed in the Public Health 
Research Institute’s Animal Biosafety Level-2 Research Animal Facility  
(ICPH RAF), a centre of the New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University 
(NJMS-Rutgers). The animal facility follows the Public Health Service and 
National Institute of Health Policy of Humane Care and Use of Laboratory 
Animals. All experimental protocols were approved by the Rutgers Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Selection for malacidin-resistant mutants. To select for resistant mutants,  
a single MRSA USA300 colony from a freshly struck plate was inoculated into 
LB media and grown overnight at 37 °C. The saturated overnight culture was 
diluted 100-fold, supplemented with a sub-lethal dose (0.5× MIC) of malacidin 
A, vancomycin, daptomycin or rifamycin and 15 mM calcium. Two-hundred-
microlitre aliquots were then distributed into microtiter plate wells. The next day, 
3 μ 
l of culture from each well was used to inoculate 200 μ 
l of calcium-supplemented 
media (15 mM calcium) with fresh antibiotic at 0.5× and 4× MIC. This process 
was repeated for 20 days. In the cases where bacterial growth was observed in the 
4× MIC overnight cultures, the resistant culture was plated in successively higher 
concentrations of antibiotic the following day. This was repeated over the course of 
the experiment to assess fold change in MIC at day 0 to day 20.
Membrane leakage and depolarization assays. The effects of malacidin on 
membrane integrity was assessed using SYTOX green. In brief, single colonies of 
MRSA USA300 were grown in LB media with and without 15 mM CaCl2 to an 
OD600 nm of 0.35. Nine hundred microlitres of cells were mixed with 100 μ 
l  
of 17 μ 
M SYTOX green dye (Thermo Fisher). The resulting mixture was incubated 
for 5 min at 22 °C, and then distributed to a microtiter plate at 50 μ 
l per well.  
An initial reading of fluorescence pre-antibiotic addition was measured at 
excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 nm and 523 nm, respectively.  
Fifty microlitres of antibiotics was added to respective wells at a final concentration 
of 20 μ 
g ml−1. Measurements were immediately collected for 10 min. To assess  
the effects of malacidin on membrane depolarization, similar assays were set up 
using the membrane potential probe, DiBAC4 (bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)
trimethine oxonol). Single colonies of MRSA USA300 were grown in LB media 
with and without 15 mM CaCl2 to an OD600 nm of 0.35. Nine hundred microlitres  
of cells were mixed with 100 μ 
l of 20 μ 
g ml−1 DiBAC4 dye (Thermo Fisher).  
The resulting mixture was incubated for 5 min at 22 °C, and then distributed  
to a microtiter plate at 50 μ 
l per well. An initial reading of fluorescence  
pre-antibiotic addition was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths 
of 492 nm and 515 nm, respectively. Fifty microlitres of antibiotics was added 
to respective wells at a final concentration of 20 μ 
g ml−1. Measurements were 
immediately collected for 10 min. Representative examples from three technical 
replicates are shown.
UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide accumulation assay. The intracellular accumulation 
of the cell wall precursor UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide after treatment of MRSA 
USA300 with malacidin was assessed as previously described16. In brief, single 
colonies of MRSA USA300 were grown in LB media with and without 15 mM 
CaCl2 to an OD600 nm of 0.6. One microlitre of cells and medium were incubated 
with a final concentration of 130 μ 
g ml−1 chloramphenicol for 15 min at 37 °C. 
Antibiotics to be assayed were added at 10 μ 
g ml−1 and incubated for 60 min at 
37 °C. Vancomycin, known to form a complex with lipid II, was used as a positive 
control. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 30 μ 
l dH2O 
and incubated in boiling water for 15 min. The cell extract was then centrifuged at 
14,000g. Supernatant was analysed for UDP-linked cell wall precursors by a  
UPLC–MS system (Waters Corporation). Experiments were performed  
with biological replicates.
Complex formation with cell wall precursors. Binding of malacidin to C55-P 
and lipid II was evaluated by incubating 1 nmol of each purified precursor 
with 0.5 nmol of malacidin or daptomycin in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% 
Triton X-100, 13 mM MgCl2, and with or without 25 mM CaCl2, for 60 min at 37 °C. 
Subsequently, the mixture was extracted twice with n-BuOH/6 M pyridinium 
acetate buffer, pH 4.2 (3:1, v/v). The butanol fraction was evaporated and the 
residue was dissolved in CHCl3/methanol (1:1, v/v). The resuspension was analysed 
for the loss of unbound malacidin or daptomycin to a complex by TLC analysis 
using chloroform/methanol/water/ammonia (88:48:10:1, v/v/v/v) as the solvent 
and detection by 254/366 nm visualization. Experiments were performed with 
biological replicates.

Life Sciences Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life 
science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list 
items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity. 
For further information on the points included in this form, see Reporting Life Sciences Research. For further information on Nature Research 
policies, including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist. 
�    Experimental design
1.   Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
No sample-size calculation was determined.
2.   Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions.
No data was excluded from analyses reported in this manuscript.
3.   Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were 
reliably reproduced.
All in vitro experiments were independently repeated in triplicates -- when 
appropriate, biological triplicates. For animal studies, 4 wounds on two rats were 
monitored for each condition.
4.   Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were 
allocated into experimental groups.
For animal studies, 200 gram male outbred Sprague Dawley rats were assigned 
randomly to the experimental and control groups.
5.   Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to 
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
Investigators were not blinded
Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.
6.   Statistical parameters 
For all figures and tables that use statistical methods, confirm that the following items are present in relevant figure legends (or in the 
Methods section if additional space is needed). 
n/a Confirmed
The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement (animals, litters, cultures, etc.)
A description of how samples were collected, noting whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same 
sample was measured repeatedly
A statement indicating how many times each experiment was replicated
The statistical test(s) used and whether they are one- or two-sided (note: only common tests should be described solely by name; more 
complex techniques should be described in the Methods section)
A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as an adjustment for multiple comparisons
The test results (e.g. P values) given as exact values whenever possible and with confidence intervals noted
A clear description of statistics including central tendency (e.g. median, mean) and variation (e.g. standard deviation, interquartile range)
Clearly defined error bars
See the web collection on statistics for biologists for further resources and guidance.
