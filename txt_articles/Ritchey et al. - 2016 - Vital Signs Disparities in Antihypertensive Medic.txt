Abstract
Introduction: Nonadherence to taking prescribed antihypertensive medication (antihypertensive) regimens has been 
identified as a leading cause of poor blood pressure control among persons with hypertension and an important risk factor 
for adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes. CDC and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services analyzed geographic, 
racial-ethnic, and other disparities in nonadherence to antihypertensives among Medicare Part D beneficiaries in 2014.
Methods: Antihypertensive nonadherence, defined as a proportion of days a beneficiary was covered with antihypertensives 
of <80%, was assessed using prescription drug claims data among Medicare Advantage or Medicare fee-for-service 
beneficiaries aged ≥65 years with Medicare Part D coverage during 2014 (N = 18.5 million). Analyses were stratified 
by antihypertensive class, beneficiaries’ state and county of residence, type of prescription drug plan, and treatment and 
demographic characteristics.
Results: Overall, 26.3% (4.9 million) of Medicare Part D beneficiaries using antihypertensives were nonadherent to their 
regimen. Nonadherence differed by multiple factors, including medication class (range: 16.9% for angiotensin II receptor 
blockers to 28.9% for diuretics); race-ethnicity (24.3% for non-Hispanic whites, 26.3% for Asian/Pacific Islanders, 33.8% 
for Hispanics, 35.7% for blacks, and 38.8% for American Indians/Alaska Natives); and state of residence (range 18.7% for 
North Dakota to 33.7% for the District of Columbia). Considerable county-level variation in nonadherence was found; 
the highest nonadherence tended to occur in the southern United States (U.S. Census region nonadherence = 28.9% 
[South], 26.7% [West], 24.1% [Northeast], and 22.8% [Midwest]) 
Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: More than one in four Medicare Part D beneficiaries using 
antihypertensives were nonadherent to their regimen, and certain racial/ethnic groups, states, and geographic areas were 
at increased risk for nonadherence. These findings can help inform focused interventions among these groups, which 
might improve blood pressure control and cardiovascular disease outcomes.

Introduction
Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease 
(1). Use of prescribed antihypertensive medication (antihyper-
tensives), in conjunction with diet and lifestyle modifications 
to lower blood pressure among persons with hypertension 
substantially decreases their risk for adverse cardiovascular dis-
ease outcomes (1,2). Approximately 70% of U.S. adults aged 
≥65 years have hypertension, only about half of whom have their 
blood pressure controlled (i.e., <140/90 mm Hg) (3).
Medication nonadherence, or not following a health care profes-
sional’s instructions concerning taking prescribed antihyperten-
sives (e.g., take one tablet twice daily), is a leading reason for poor 
blood pressure control among persons treated for hypertension, a 
strong risk factor for adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes, and a 
cause of excessive health care costs (2,4). The reasons for nonadher-
ence to chronic disease medications, including antihypertensives, 
are numerous and complex. They include factors involving the 
patients, their health care professionals, and the policies and pro-
cedures of health systems and payers (5).
In 2006, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS) implemented the Medicare Part D prescription drug 
benefit program,* a United States federal government program 
to subsidize the costs of prescription drugs and prescription 
drug insurance premiums for Medicare beneficiaries, which 
has increased the affordability and accessibility of prescription 
medications among U.S. adults aged ≥65 years and the disabled. 
The program has decreased out-of-pocket prescription medi-
cation spending by about $150 per year per beneficiary and 
On September 13, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR Early Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
* The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit program was established by the 
Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. This entitlement went into effect in 
2006, and provides voluntary coverage to disabled and older adults (https://
www.medicare.gov/part-d/).

increased medication use by a mean of one to three more pre-
scriptions per year per beneficiary (6). In 2015, approximately 
39 million beneficiaries were enrolled in Medicare Part D, 
61% of whom were enrolled in stand-alone prescription drug 
plans (PDPs) that supplement Original Medicare† coverage 
and 39% of whom were enrolled in Medicare Advantage§ 
prescription drug (MA-PD) plans (7). The implementation of 
the Medicare Part D program has been associated with up to 
a 13.5% improvement in antihypertensive adherence among 
beneficiaries (8). However, antihypertensive nonadherence 
continues to pose a threat to this population’s health, especially 
among certain demographic groups (9).
This study used the most currently available data to describe 
antihypertensive nonadherence among Medicare Part D benefi-
ciaries, and assessed nonadherence stratified by multiple factors, 
including antihypertensive class and beneficiaries’ state and county 
of residence, type of prescription drug plan, and treatment and 
demographic characteristics, to help identify and inform targeted 
interventions among the groups and regions most at risk.
Methods
Administrative data and prescription drug event data for 
all Medicare Part D beneficiaries in 2014 were accessed via 
the CMS Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse.¶ Among 
30.0 million beneficiaries aged ≥65 years as of January 1, 
2014, 10.5 million were excluded from analysis, including 
1.1 million who were long-term institutionalized residents 
(e.g., resided in nursing home); 0.9 million who did not have 
continuous enrollment in full fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare 
(i.e., Part A and Part B coverage within Original Medicare) 
with additional PDP coverage or in a MA-PD plan during 
January 1–December 31, 2014 or until their death in 2014; 
and 8.5 million who did not have at least one antihypertensive 
prescription filled in 2014, leaving 19.5 million beneficiaries 
for analysis.
Analyses were limited to beneficiaries with two or more 
antihypertensive prescriptions filled (fills) within the same 
pharmacologic therapeutic class on different service dates 
within a measurement period of >90 days** (N = 18.5 million). 
Therapeutic classes were identified using the Uniform System 
of Classification†† schema and included the following: 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II 
receptor blockers, which were assessed individually and collec-
tively with direct renin inhibitors as renin-angiotensin system 
antagonists; beta blockers; calcium channel blockers; diuretics; 
and other antihypertensives.§§
Nonadherence was measured using the proportion of days 
covered (PDC) metric (10), which represents the percentage 
of days a beneficiary had access to the prescribed medication 
from the date of the first antihypertensive fill through the end 
of 2014 or the beneficiary’s death in 2014.¶¶ To align with cur-
rent standards, beneficiaries with a PDC <80% were considered 
nonadherent (10). Among beneficiaries taking multiple anti-
hypertensives, overall PDC was calculated as an average of the 
PDCs calculated for each therapeutic class.*** Nonadherence 
was calculated by plan type, and in the FFS-PDP population, 
among beneficiaries with and without a diagnosis of hyper-
tension (i.e., had or had not received an administrative billing 
code for hypertension†††). Factors assessed for relationship 
with nonadherence were age, sex, race/ethnicity, low-income 
subsidy status§§§ (which includes persons eligible for both 
† Original Medicare is administered directly through the federal government and 
includes the potential to enroll in both Part A and Part B. If a drug benefit is 
desired, the beneficiary must buy separate coverage through a Prescription Drug 
Plan from a private insurance company. Typically, beneficiaries pay a monthly 
premium covering 25.5% of the cost of the benefit and the Medicare Trust 
Funds subsidizes the remaining 74.5% (https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-
change-plans/decide-how-to-get-medicare/original-medicare/how-original-
medicare-works.html).
§ Medicare Advantage plans are sold by private insurance companies, but are 
subsidized by the Medicare Trust Funds. At a minimum, they must provide 
Part A and Part B coverage. Beneficiaries who also want a drug benefit, typically 
select a plan that provides both health and drug coverage, called a Medicare 
Advantage Prescription Drug Plan (https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-
plans/medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans/how-medicare-
advantage-plans-work.html).

Research Data Center (https://www.ccwdata.org/web/guest/home).

used by CMS to help ensure an adequate amount of time to effectively assess 
adherence among beneficiaries.
 †† IMS Uniform System of Classification is a standard for pharmaceutical 
product classification (https://www.imshealth.com/files/web/IMSH%20
Institute/USC_Classiification_Process_2011.pdf.
 §§ Other antihypertensives include selective aldosterone receptor inhibitors, 
peripheral vasodilators, alpha blockers, and centrally acting agents.
 ¶¶ The PDC measure is endorsed by the National Quality Forum and is the preferred 
method of measuring medication adherence by the Pharmacy Quality Alliance. 
A PDC was calculated for each class for which a beneficiary met the inclusion 
criteria. If multiple prescriptions for the same target medication (i.e., same generic 
ingredient) were dispensed on different days such that the prescriptions 
overlapped, the start date for the new prescription accounted for the remaining 
medication from the previous fill. Days’ supply that extended beyond the end 
of the measurement period was not included in the PDC calculation. All analyses 
were performed using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). 
See Supplemental Document 1 (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/40808) for the 
SAS coding used to perform the analyses in this study.
 *** Beneficiaries’ overall PDC is the average of their PDCs for renin-angiotensin 
system antagonists, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and 
other antihypertensives. If the average PDC is <80%, they are considered 
nonadherent for the combined use of all antihypertensives.

received an administrative billing code for hypertension while enrolled 
with FFS coverage can be found at https://www.ccwdata.org/web/guest/

MA-PD beneficiaries.

Medicare and Medicaid), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) clas-
sification, initial entitlement eligibility designation (i.e., age 
≥65 years or disability and/or ESRD), and whether any of the 
antihypertensives filled were for fixed-dose combinations (i.e., 
>1 antihypertensive within each pill). The maximum number 
of antihypertensive classes on hand at any one time was used as 
a proxy for blood pressure treatment intensity; the number of 
unique prescription medications used to treat any condition as 
a proxy for health status; the number of non-antihypertensive 
prescription medications filled as a proxy for overall medication 
burden; and the number of antihypertensive prescribers as a 
proxy for continuity of care for blood pressure management.¶¶¶
Descriptive analyses included calculating the mean annual 
total and out-of-pocket spending on antihypertensives per ben-
eficiary and the percentage of overall beneficiary prescription 
medication spending attributed to antihypertensives. For anti-
hypertensives, mean days’ supply per fill (i.e., the mean number 
of days a prescription fill would last based on the amount of 
medication supplied), percentage of fills with generic rather 
than brand-name medications, and the percentage of fills with 
fixed-dose combinations were calculated. Nonadherence was 
stratified by beneficiaries’ U.S. Census Region and state or ter-
ritory of residence and mapped by county of residence using 
a spatial empirical Bayesian smoothing technique to enhance 
estimate stability. The data used in these analyses represent 
100% of the beneficiaries who met the inclusion criteria; 
therefore, no statistical testing was needed to assess for differ-
ences among subgroups for the previously described variables.
Results
Among the 18.5 million Medicare Part D beneficiaries who 
were prescribed antihypertensives, 4.9 million (26.3%) were 
nonadherent (Table 1). Nonadherence varied by race (24.3% 
[whites], 26.3% [Asian/Pacific Islanders], 33.8% [Hispanics], 
35.7% [blacks], 38.8% [American Indians/Alaska Natives]); 
low-income subsidy status (32.1% [low-income subsidy], 
25.4% [no subsidy]); and reason for initial entitlement, 
which was highest (42.4%) among beneficiaries with dis-
ability and ESRD.
Nonadherence was slightly higher among older age groups 
and when a second class of antihypertensive was added (27.2%) 
compared with a single class (23.2%), and was slightly lower 
among beneficiaries with any fixed-dose combination medi-
cation use (Table 1). Nonadherence increased with decreases 
in health status and as the number of antihypertensive pre-
scribers increased. There was little relationship between the 
overall medication burden proxy or plan type (FFS-PDP 
versus MA-PD) and nonadherence. Nonadherence differed by 
medication class, ranging from 16.9% (angiotensin II receptor 
 
¶¶¶ The maximum number of antihypertensive classes on hand at any one time 
in 2014 variable was grouped in three categories (one antihypertensive class, 
two antihypertensive classes, and three or more antihypertensive classes). 
The health status proxy describes the number of unique prescriptions filled, 
by generic medication name, and was grouped into quartiles with the fourth 
quartile representing beneficiaries with potentially the worst health status 
(i.e., taking the most unique types of medication). The overall medication 
burden proxy describes the number of non-antihypertensive prescription 
medications filled for in 2014, and was grouped into quartiles with the fourth 
quartile representing beneficiaries with the greatest medication burden (i.e., 
most number of fills per year). The continuity of care for blood pressure 
management proxy describes the number of unique antihypertensive 
prescribers in 2014, and was grouped into three categories (one 
antihypertensive prescriber, two antihypertensive prescribers, and three or 
more antihypertensive prescribers). The larger the number of unique 
prescribers the potentially less the continuity of care.
Key Points
• Cardiovascular disease (heart disease and stroke) is the 
leading cause of death in the United States.
• Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a primary risk 
factor for heart disease and stroke, and approximately 
70% of adults aged ≥65 years have the condition. Only 
about half of persons with high blood pressure have it 
under control (i.e., blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg).
• Nonadherence, or not following a health care 
professional’s instructions concerning taking their 
prescribed blood pressure medicine, is a well-known 
reason for uncontrolled high blood pressure and an 
important risk factor for adverse cardiovascular disease 
outcomes and increased health care costs.
• In this study, 26.3% (4.9 million) Medicare Part D 
beneficiaries aged ≥65 years using blood pressure 
medicine were considered nonadherent.
• Different groups and geographic regions had a high 
proportion of beneficiaries classified as nonadherent. For 
example, 24.3% of whites, 26.3% of Asian/Pacific 
Islanders, 33.8% of Hispanics, 35.7% of blacks, and 
38.8% of American Indians or Alaska Natives were 
classified as being nonadherent. In addition, 
socioeconomic status classifications showed differences, 
with 32.1% of persons with a low-income subsidy being 
classified as nonadherent, compared with 25.4% of 
persons with no subsidy. The highest nonadherence 
prevalence tended to occur in the southern United States.
• Factors and opportunities were identified that could be 
addressed by prescribers, health systems, and payers to 
improve adherence, including, especially among older 
adults, simplifying their blood pressure medication regimen.

blockers) to 28.9% (diuretics); 20.4% of beneficiaries who were 
prescribed renin-angiotensin system antagonists, the medica-
tion category used in the CMS Part C and D Star Ratings 
Program,**** were nonadherent (Table 2).
At the state level, beneficiaries in North Dakota (18.7%), 
Wisconsin (18.8%), and Minnesota (18.9%) had the lowest 
nonadherence, and beneficiaries in Washington, D.C. (33.7%), 
Mississippi (32.8%), and Louisiana (31.5%) had the highest 
(Table 3; Supplemental Figure 1 [https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/
cdc/40807]). Nonadherence was higher in the U.S. territories 
of Puerto Rico (39.6%) and the Virgin Islands (46.9%) than 
within the states (range: 18.7%–33.7%). At the county level, 
considerable variation in nonadherence was found (range: 
15.9% to 56.2%). The greatest nonadherence tended to occur 
in the southern United States (nonadherence, by U.S. Census 
region, of 28.9% for the South, 26.7% for the West, 24.1% 
for the Northeast, and 22.8% for the Midwest) (Figure).
In 2014, the 215.9 million antihypertensive fills accounted 
for almost $5.9 billion in total spending, of which $2.1 billion 
(35.6%) was borne by beneficiaries (Table 1). On average, 
per-person out-of-pocket spending for antihypertensives was 
about $92 per year, reflecting 18.4% of beneficiaries’ overall 
annual prescription medication spending. Total annual spend-
ing on antihypertensives differed by beneficiary characteristics 
(Table 1), medication class (Table 2), and beneficiary state of 
residence (Table 3). The highest mean annual total spending 
occurred among beneficiaries using a maximum of four or 
more antihypertensive classes at one time ($693 per year), 
using angiotensin II receptor blockers ($476 spending per year 
on that class alone), and living in New Jersey ($472 per year). 
Overall, 95.5% of antihypertensive fills were for generic for-
mulations. Fixed-dose combination fills accounted for 8.9% 
of antihypertensive fills (Table 1), with thiazide diuretics, a 
specific type of diuretic, being the antihypertensive most often 
prescribed in combination (46.5% of fills) (Table 2). Mean 
days’ supply per fill was 53.9 days and varied by beneficiary 
characteristics (Table 1), including state of residence (Table 3).
Conclusions and Comments
More than one fourth of Medicare Part D beneficiaries aged 
≥65 years were nonadherent to their antihypertensive regimen. 
Uncontrolled blood pressure is a main risk factor for the first 
and third leading causes of death (heart disease and stroke, 
respectively) among adults aged ≥65 years (1).†††† Although 
multiple factors contribute to the high proportion of uncon-
trolled blood pressure among persons in this age group (11), 
persons who are adherent to their antihypertensives are 45% 
more likely to achieve blood pressure control and have up to a 
38% decreased risk for having a cardiovascular event compared 
with persons who are nonadherent (2,4).
Several groups had higher antihypertensive nonadherence, 
including blacks and American Indians/Alaska Natives, who 
are also at higher risk for poor blood pressure control and 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with other 
racial and ethnic groups (1). Moreover, beneficiaries living 
in the southern United States had the highest nonadherence. 
These differences in nonadherence could play a role in persis-
tent disparities in blood pressure control and cardiovascular 
disease outcomes in these groups and regions (1,12). Although 
still suboptimal, if the average nonadherence rate of 18.9% 
among Medicare Part D beneficiary populations in the three 
states with the lowest nonadherence rates (North Dakota, 
Wisconsin, and Minnesota) were to be achieved in all states, 
the national nonadherence rate would decrease by about one 
third, and 1.4 million more beneficiaries would be taking their 
antihypertensives as directed.

Factors and opportunities have been identified that pre-
scribers, health systems, and payers can address to improve 
medication adherence. For older adults, who are often taking 
multiple chronic disease medications (13), including 72% of 
beneficiaries in this study taking two or more antihypertensives, 
an important factor in improving adherence is simplification 
of the antihypertensive regimen. Some strategies include 
decreasing pill count through the use of fixed-dose combi-
nation medications (14,15), which were underused among 
most beneficiary groups in this study; limiting the number of 
pharmacy visits needed by increasing the days’ supply per fill 
(e.g., prescribing 90-day versus 30-day allotments), which had 
wide variability among beneficiary groups, and synchronizing 
fills for all medication (14); and using reminder devices and 
technology aids that encourage patients to follow their recom-
mended medication schedule (16). These strategies can be 
implemented by health care teams that are using standardized 
hypertension treatment approaches to manage patients’ blood 
pressure (15). These teams might include physicians and phy-
sician assistants, nurses and nurse practitioners, pharmacists, 
and community health workers, and their collective work 
can help ensure patients’ medication regimens and adherence 
are regularly assessed and their blood pressure controlled. 
Coordinated care might help overcome the finding of increased 
nonadherence when patients have more prescribers managing 
their antihypertensive regimens.
Additional interventions to improve adherence include 
engaging patients in medication regimen decision making using 
motivational counseling techniques and educating patients 
about the risks associated with uncontrolled blood pressure 
(17); encouraging the use of home blood pressure monitoring 
(18); maximizing use of generic medication (19); leveraging 
health information technologies that allow for e-prescribing, 
additional patient engagement, and clinical-decision support

that informs prescribing decisions (15,16); and implement-
ing payment reforms that decrease spending, such as limiting 
deductibles and copayments (20). Although annual out-of-
pocket antihypertensive spending for most beneficiaries was 
low (around $100 per year), it represented almost one fifth of 
their total prescription medication spending and might be a 
barrier to adherence among certain groups.
CMS has taken steps to decrease cost-sharing in the Medicare 
Part D coverage gap (i.e., ‘donut hole’, where beneficiaries who 
meet a specific spending threshold are responsible for a higher 
percentage of prescription medication spending) (21), which 
could reduce nonadherence. In addition, CMS has included 
medication adherence measures as part of the Part C and D Star 
Ratings Program to encourage health plans that participate in 
Medicare Part D to support improved adherence for specific 
medications, including antihypertensives. Plans achieve this 
through using interventions such as medication therapy man-
agement programs to review beneficiaries’ medication regimens 
and follow up with those who are nonadherent.
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limita-
tions. First, PDC assesses only the availability of medication 
and not the actual taking of medication. However, use of 
measures, like PDC, which rely on administrative data to assess 
nonadherence have typically correlated well with self-reported 
nonadherence, plasma medication levels, physiologic markers, 
and cardiovascular disease outcomes (2,22), and might better 
assess nonadherence among older adults than self-reported or 
other objective measures (22). Second, because the PDC cal-
culation excludes patients with only one antihypertensive fill 
and does not include persons who are prescribed medication

FIGURE. Antihypertensive medication nonadherence* among Medicare Part D beneficiaries aged ≥65 years, by county — United States, 
Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands, 2014†
* Nonadherence is defined as patients not following their health care professional’s instructions concerning taking their prescribed medication. Using the proportion 
of days covered methodology, beneficiaries were considered nonadherent if they had access to antihypertensive medication for <80% of the days from the date of 
filling their first antihypertensive medication prescription through the end of 2014 or until their death in 2014.
† Additional maps of nonadherence by beneficiaries’ race/ethnicity and for renin-angiotensin system antagonists and diuretics are available on the Interactive Atlas 
for Heart Disease and Stroke at https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/atlas/.

but never initiate treatment, it probably underestimates non-
adherence. Approximately 300,000 beneficiaries in this study 
had only one filled prescription within a class; in general, up 
to one fourth of prescriptions for newly prescribed antihy-
pertensives are never filled (23). Third, nonadherence might 
be overestimated among beneficiaries who switched antihy-
pertensive classes based on their clinician’s recommendation 
(e.g., because of side effects) or sometimes directly purchased 
low-priced generic antihypertensives without involvement of 
their prescription drug plan, but were considered nonadher-
ent. Fourth, periods when beneficiaries were hospitalized were 
not censored because hospitalization data were not available 
for beneficiaries with MA-PD plans; however, the effect of 
this on nonadherence rates is small based on earlier research 
and guidance (10). Fifth, proxy measures used here might not 
accurately reflect their intended purpose. For example, a higher 
number of antihypertensive prescribers per patient might 
indicate better team-based care rather than splintered care, 
and methodologies accounting for these increasingly popular 
models of care should be considered in future analyses. Finally, 
subpopulation comparisons were not adjusted for other factors 
and should be addressed in future studies.
More than one fourth of Medicare Part D beneficiaries 
assessed were nonadherent to their antihypertensive therapy. 
This was the first study to identify considerable geographic 
variation in antihypertensive nonadherence at the county level. 
Although recognized as challenging, improving adherence to 
antihypertensives is an effective way to improve blood pressure 
control and reduce cardiovascular events in this population, 
which is already at high risk for having cardiovascular disease. 
This study identified multiple groups at increased risk for non-
adherence and potentially modifiable risk factors. Strategies to 
improve adherence range from individual patient engagement 
and intervention to systematic health system changes, and 
coordinated approaches are important to improving adherence 
and the cardiovascular health of this population.
