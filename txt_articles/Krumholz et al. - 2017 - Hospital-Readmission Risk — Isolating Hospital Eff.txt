Abstract
Background—To isolate hospital effects on hospitals’ risk-standardized readmission rates, we 
examined readmission outcomes among patients with multiple admissions for a similar diagnosis 
at >1 hospital within a given year.
Methods—We divided the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services hospital-wide readmission 
measure cohort from July 2014–June 2015 into 2 random samples. We used the first sample to 
calculate each hospital’s risk-standardized readmission rate and classified hospitals into 
performance quartiles. In the second sample, we identified patients with 2 admissions for similar 
diagnoses at different hospitals that occurred more than a month and less than a year apart, and 
compared observed readmission rates for those admitted to hospitals in different performance 
quartiles.
Results—In the sample used to characterize hospital performance, the median risk-standardized 
readmission rate was 15.5% (IQR 15.3%–15.8%). The other sample included 37,508 patients with 
2 admissions for similar diagnoses at 4,272 different hospitals. The observed readmission rate was 
consistently higher when patients were admitted to hospitals in the worse performing quartile, but 
the only statistically significant difference was observed when the same patients were admitted to 
hospitals in the best and worst performing quartiles, in which the absolute readmission rate 
difference was 1.95 percentage points (95% CI, 0.39%–3.50%).

 Conclusions—When the same patients were admitted with similar diagnoses to hospitals in the 
best performing quartile compared with the worst performing quartile for hospital readmission 
performance, there is a significant difference in rates of readmission within 30 days. The findings 
suggest that hospital quality contributes in part to readmission rates independent of patient factors.
INTRODUCTION
The measurement and reporting of 30-day hospital readmission rates by the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has had a major impact on healthcare delivery. These 
measures, first publicly reported in 2009, were subsequently incorporated into the Hospital 
Readmission Reduction Program, a quality incentive program mandated by the Affordable 
Care Act.1 Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, readmission rates have declined 
significantly.2–5
Risk-standardized readmission rates, which are the basis of hospital assessment in the 
Hospital Readmission Reduction Program, are intended to account for hospital case-mix 
differences and to measure hospital quality of care.6–10 However, researchers and hospital 
administrators have expressed concerns about the adequacy of risk adjustment, questioning 
whether the readmission rates are valid estimates of quality and suggesting that they may 
reflect differences in social and clinical risk.11–17 A recent Department of Health and 
Human Services report to the US Congress entitled, “Social Risk Factors and Performance 
under Medicare’s Value-Based Purchasing Programs,” concluded that social factors and 
provider performance likely account for differences in hospital performance variation, but 
that evidence is limited and there is “clearly a need for more research in this area.”17
Our objective was to determine if a hospital effect contributes to CMS risk-standardized 
readmission risk, independent of patient factors. To isolate the effect of hospitals from 
unmeasured patient factors, we exploited the fact that many patients have multiple 
admissions for a similar diagnosis at more than 1 hospital within a given year. Accordingly, 
we identified patients admitted with the same diagnoses to hospitals in different quartiles of 
30-day readmission performance within the same year and determined the difference in 
readmission rates for these patients across hospital quartiles with different risk-standardized 
readmission rates as measured by the CMS hospital-wide readmission measure.
METHODS
Data and Cohort
The hospital-wide readmission measure as reported by CMS Hospital Compare incorporates 
most of the hospital admissions. Qualifying hospitalizations included admissions for a broad 
range of medical, neurological, and surgical conditions, in contrast with the narrow cohorts 
for disease-specific readmission measures (e.g., heart failure or pneumonia).
To construct the overall study cohort, we applied the cohort definition of the CMS publicly 
reported, hospital-wide, 30-day readmission measure.6,10 Briefly, we included all discharges 
from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015 from short-term acute care or critical access 
hospitals in the US of patients who had Medicare Fee-for-Service insurance, were aged ≥65

 years, and who were discharged alive and not against medical advice. We excluded patients 
admitted for medical treatment of cancer or primary psychiatric disease. In addition, we 
excluded patients without 1 year of pre-hospitalization enrollment in Medicare Fee-for-
Service since previous claims are needed to identify comorbidities used in risk adjustment or 
without 1 month of post-discharge enrollment to capture all 30-day readmissions. We also 
excluded patients discharged from cancer hospitals exempt from Fee-for-Service. Multiple 
index admissions by the same patient could be included if each met eligibility criteria.
We obtained post-discharge mortality status from the Medicare Denominator File. We 
additionally used the 2015 American Hospital Association annual survey database to 
identify descriptive hospital characteristics.
Hospital Readmission Performance Classification
We randomly divided the discharges into 2 groups, which were stratified on hospital and 
principal diagnosis category (Figure 1). We used one half of the sample (the “performance 
classification sample”) to calculate hospital risk-standardized all-cause, unplanned 
readmission rates and classify the hospitals into quartiles of readmission performance. We 
calculated readmission performance using risk-standardized readmission rates in a manner 
consistent with the CMS publicly reported, hospital-wide, 30-day readmission 
measure.6,10,18 The classification of an unplanned readmission is based on the CMS 
measures.19 In brief, hospital-wide risk-standardized readmission rates are calculated as the 
ratio of the number of ‘predicted’ readmissions to the number of ‘expected’ readmissions, 
multiplied by the national observed readmission rate. Specifically, the hospital-wide 
readmission measure was computed within 5 specialty cohort levels, including surgical/
gynecology, cardiovascular, cardiorespiratory, neurological, and medical hospitalizations. 
Five hierarchical logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the predicted and 
expected number of readmissions. The approach simultaneously modeled data at the patient 
and hospital levels to account for the variation in patient readmissions within and between 
hospitals. Hospitals were classified into quartiles based on their hospital-wide risk-
standardized readmission rates from the performance specification sample.
Hospital Comparisons
We used the other half of the sample to identify patients who had been admitted to hospitals 
in different quartiles of risk-standardized readmission rate performance for a similar 
diagnosis (i.e., within the same diagnostic category of the readmission measure). For these 
patients, we selected 1 or more pairs of hospitalizations, with 1 hospitalization in each of 2 
or more quartiles. If a patient had more than 1 hospitalization in a given quartile, then 1 
hospitalization was randomly selected. The result was a group of patients with 1 or more 
pairs of hospitalizations for similar diagnoses that occurred in hospitals that were in different 
readmission performance quartiles. The patients and hospitalizations in the quartile-pair 
comparisons constituted the study sample.
Statistical Analysis
First, we described the characteristics of the hospitals in the study sample by performance 
quartile. We reported risk-standardized readmission rates, teaching status, safety-net status,

 geographic location, urban/rural status, and bed size. Second, we described the patients in 
each of the quartile-pair comparisons (i.e., quartiles 1 versus 2; 2 versus 3; 3 versus 4; 1 
versus 3; 2 versus 4; 1 versus 4). We reported age, race, sex, dual eligibility status, 
socioeconomic status, geographic location, and time between admissions. Dual beneficiaries 
were defined as individuals enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare. Beneficiaries with low 
socioeconomic status were defined as those in the lowest quartile group of the 
socioeconomic status index score of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, a 
composite measure of socioeconomic status that was calculated based on 7 measures from 
the census data.20 We also report the sequence of admissions to determine if there is an 
imbalance as to whether the individual went to the higher or lower quality hospital first. 
Third, for each performance quartile pair (i.e., quartile 1 vs. quartile 2; quartile 1 vs. quartile 
3, etc.) we calculated the difference in the observed 30-day, unplanned all-cause readmission 
rates among patients contributing an admission pair to that quartile pair. To assess the 
significance of the difference between paired proportions, we calculated the 95% confidence 
interval using McNemar’s test. Our primary inference involved testing of 6 null hypotheses 
that for each of the 6 quartile pairs, readmission rates are equal in the 2 paired performing 
quartiles. To maintain a family-wise error rate of 0.05, we used a Bonferroni adjustment 
indicating that a statistical significance of 0.0083 would be required. We next compared the 
patients in the study sample with those who were excluded. To determine the similarity of 
the diagnoses at the most granular level, we compared the specific International 
Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) principal 
discharge diagnosis code for the admissions in each quartile. We identified the top-50 
ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes in each quartile and summarized the differences in percentages 
of top-50 ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for each quartile pair in histograms. Finally, we 
compared the admission characteristics for each hospitalization for each quartile pair to 
provide more information about the comparability of the admissions. We calculated the 
standardized difference in mean or proportion for each admission characteristic. We used 
SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for analyses. We obtained institutional review board 
approval, including waiver of the requirement for participant informed consent, through the 
Yale University Human Investigation Committee.
RESULTS
Study Cohorts
The study cohort construction is shown in Figure 1. In the study period, there were 
7,163,152 hospitalizations, of which 6,910,341 met inclusion criteria for the hospital-wide 
risk-standardized readmission measure. Of these, 3,455,171 discharges (2,741,289 patients 
and 4,738 hospitals) were randomly selected to calculate the hospital readmission 
performance. The second sample was comprised of 3,455,170 discharges in the study 
sample, of which 130,704 were patients who had 2 or more admissions for similar diagnoses 
at least 30 days apart. Compared with those excluded, this sample of 130,704 patients was 
slightly younger (77.5 years versus 78.4 years), more likely to be non-white (19.4% versus 
14.1%), less likely to be female (55.8% versus 56.4%), more likely to have lower 
socioeconomic status (25.2% versus 20.5%), and more likely to be from the South region 
(42.0% versus 40.6%) (Table S1). Then, at the patient level, for those with multiple

 admissions to hospitals within a quartile, we randomly selected 1, leaving us with a final 
study sample that included 75,581 hospitalizations from 37,508 patients and 4,272 hospitals. 
There is an odd number of hospitalizations because a single hospitalization could be used in 
more than 1 quartile-pair comparison.
Hospital Readmission Performance Classification
Risk-standardized hospital-wide unplanned all-cause readmission rates were calculated for 
each institution in the performance classification cohort. The results of specialty cohort-level 
hierarchical logistic regression models are shown in Table S2. The mean was 15.6%, with a 
range of 11.7% to 19.6% and an interquartile range of 15.3% to 15.8%. The mean risk-
standardized readmission rates for the 4 hospital quartiles were 15.0%, 15.4%, 15.7%, and 
16.3% (Table S3). Hospital characteristics by quartile are shown in Table 1.
Main Findings
Among the patients who were hospitalized more than once for similar diagnoses at different 
hospitals that were classified into different performance quartiles, the observed readmission 
rate was significantly higher in patients admitted to the worst quartile compared with the 
best quartile (absolute readmission rate difference = 1.95 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.39% 
to 3.50%) (Table 2). The differences in the comparison of the other quartiles were smaller 
and not significant.
Quartile Comparisons
The patient characteristics for the individuals in the quartile comparisons are reported in 
Table 3. The definition of the quartiles is derived from the performance specification cohort, 
but the patients and hospitalizations in the quartile comparisons are from a separate study 
sample. In the quartile comparisons, the median of days between paired admissions for the 
same patient was from 111 to 118 days. The sequence of the admissions was similar across 
hospital quartile comparisons, as the percentage of first admissions that occurred at the 
better performing quartile hospitals was 50.01% for the quartile 1–2 comparison; 48.59% for 
quartiles 2–3; 50.38% for quartiles 3–4; 48.45% for quartiles 1–3; 51.42% for quartiles 2–4; 
and 49.64% for quartiles 1–4. For the comparison that was significant, the higher 
readmission rate for the worst quartile was present in both sequences (Table S4). The 
principal discharge diagnoses (Table S5) and the patient characteristics (Table S6) that could 
have changed (e.g., comorbidities, admission source, age) between the quartiles for each 
quartile-comparison pair were not substantively different. In Figure S1, we summarized the 
differences in percentages of top-50 ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for each quartile pair in 
histograms; the max (min) difference in percentages of top codes is −1.58% (1.03%).
DISCUSSION
In this study, when the same patients were admitted with similar diagnoses to multiple 
hospitals in the best and worst performance quartiles based on the CMS readmission 
measure, they experienced significantly higher rates of readmission after hospitalization at 
worse performing facilities. This study addresses a persistent concern that national 
readmission measures may reflect differences in unmeasured factors rather than hospital

 performance.16,21,22 The findings suggest that hospital quality contributes at least in part to 
readmission rates independent of patient factors. By studying individuals who are admitted 
twice within a year with similar diagnoses to different hospitals, this study design is able to 
isolate hospital signals of performance while minimizing differences among the patients 
used to estimate performance. In these cases, because the same patients have admissions at 2 
hospitals, the patients, including their level of social disadvantage, level of education, or 
degree of underlying illness, are broadly the same. The alignment of the differences we 
observed with the CMS hospital-wide readmission measure results also adds to evidence that 
the readmission measure classifies true differences in performance.
There may be some factors that could change over time for individual patients. We sought to 
evaluate whether any of those factors, such as comorbidities, sequence of the admissions, 
and specific principal discharge diagnoses may have influenced the outcomes at the 
respective hospitals. We could find no evidence of systemic differences in factors that could 
have been different in the 2 hospitalizations. Moreover, we conducted the study so that 
hospitalizations used to characterize hospital readmission performance were not used in the 
evaluation of risk for patients who were admitted to hospitals categorized as having different 
levels of performance. This separation of the hospitalizations was intended to ensure 
independence of hospital performance evaluation and readmission risk determination for 
individual patients.
Of note, the study was not designed to determine whether particular patient factors currently 
not included in the measure are an important indicator of an individual’s risk of readmission. 
Several studies have indicated that sociodemographic characteristics are associated with 
readmission for at least some conditions at the patient level.23,24 The root cause of that risk 
deserves continued scrutiny and not all studies agree.25 Moreover, there is a difference 
between patient-level prediction and risk adjustment at the hospital level. Several studies 
indicate that adding information about social factors to the CMS readmission measures has 
little impact on the characterization of hospital performance.12–14,17
Nor was the study designed to determine the contribution of the hospital effect relative to 
other factors. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the difference in readmission risk among the 
same patients admitted to the best and worst quartile is similar to the difference in the risk-
standardized readmission rates in the CMS measure. If unmeasured patient factors were 
confounding the assessment of readmission performance, we would expect the difference to 
be smaller than that reported by the public measures. The difference is actually larger than 
the mean risk-standardized readmission rate quartile differences from the performance 
specification sample, perhaps owing to the study sample being, overall, a higher risk group 
given that it comprised individuals who experienced at least 2 admissions within a year. An 
absolute difference of 2% may seem small relative to the overall readmission risk, but it 
indicates that for every 50 patients admitted to a hospital in the lowest performing, rather 
than highest performing, quartile, there is 1 additional readmission.
The study has several limitations. First, it focused on the subset of patients seen in more than 
1 hospital with different readmission performance. These patients have a higher risk of 
readmission and have more comorbidities than the other patients. Nevertheless, they are an

 ideal population in which to test the validity of the readmission measures. In particular, the 
factors that could vary by hospitalization, i.e., the sequence of the admissions and the 
diagnoses, were quite comparable. Second, this study focused on hospital-wide readmission 
because of the larger sample it afforded rather than readmission performance for individual 
admitting conditions. Third, we did not evaluate particular hospitals, but rather groups of 
hospitals because paired admissions were infrequent among individual hospital pairs. We 
cannot exclude that there may be exceptions for certain individual hospitals. Fourth, the 2 
admissions were matched for similar, but not exactly the same, diagnoses. Nevertheless, we 
did evaluate the specific principal diagnoses and admission characteristics and we did not 
detect an important difference (Figure S1 and Table S3). Finally, only the first and fourth 
quartiles had significant differences. However, given that each RSRR is associated with 
some uncertainty and the hospitals in closer quartiles likely have overlapping interval 
estimates, it is not surprising that there are not entirely consistent differences. Since these 
differences are not statistically different, what we observe may be a result of the play of 
chance among hospitals that are not so different in their true rates.
In conclusion, we report evidence that the same patients admitted to hospitals with different 
levels of readmission performance, as classified by risk-standardized readmission rates, have 
different risk of outcomes. This result should reassure the public, policymakers and health 
care professionals that the signal of quality from the hospital-wide readmission measure is 
valid and can be used as a means to benchmark performance. Moreover, there are 
opportunities for worse performing hospitals to improve their care and avert potentially 
preventable readmissions.

Numbers of hospitals may not sum to total due to missing values (88 hospitals cannot be matched with American Hospital Association 2015 survey data); safety-net hospitals are defined as hospitals with an 
annual Medicaid caseload that was greater than 1 SD above their respective state’s mean private hospital Medicaid caseload;26 A Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) is a U.S. geographic area defined by 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that consists of 1 or more counties (or equivalents) anchored by an urban center of at least 10,000 people plus adjacent counties that are socioeconomically 
tied to the urban center by commuting;27 Quartiles are defined based on the performance classification sample; IQR, interquartile range; Q, quartile; SD, standard deviation

Lower quartile and higher quartile represent the 2 groups of each quartile pair; Q, quartile-pair (e.g., Q12, quartile-pair comparison Q1 vs. Q2); the confidence interval for the difference in observed 30-day 
readmission rate is calculated using McNemar’s test with Bonferroni adjustment (statistical significance level was 0.05/6=0.0083).
