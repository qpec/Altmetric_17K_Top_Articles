Abstract
Bloodstream infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)
are associated with treatment failure and increased mortality. Detection of CPE from blood
cultures (BC) by standard methods takes 16–72 hours, which can delay the initiation of
appropriate antimicrobial therapy and compromise patient outcome. In the present study,
we developed and evaluated a new method for the rapid detection of carbapenemases
directly from positive BC using a new multiplex immunochromatographic test (ICT). The
new ICT was assessed using 170 molecularly characterized Enterobacteriaceae clinical iso-
lates including 126 CPE (OXA-48-like (N = 79), KPC (N = 18) and NDM (N = 29)). After spik-
ing with bacteria and incubation in a BC system, blood from positive BC bottles was
hemolyzed, bacteria concentrated by centrifugation and lysed. The lysate was transferred
to the RESIST-3 O.K.N. ICT (Coris BioConcept, Gembloux, Belgium), which detects OXA-
48-like, KPC and NDM carbapenemases. The final results of the ICT were read when they
became positive, at the latest after 15 min. All CPE isolates (126/126) were correctly
detected with the new protocol (100% sensitivity, 100% specificity). There was perfect con-
cordance between ICT results and molecular characterization. Total time to result was 20–
45 min.
Conclusions: This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that with the newly developed
method, OXA-48-like, KPC and NDM carbapenemases can be reliably detected directly
from positive BC bottles. The new method is more rapid than other currently available
assays and can be performed in any routine microbiology laboratory. This can help to rapidly
identify patients with CPE BSI and optimize the management of patients with these difficult-
to-treat infections. Further studies are needed to assess the performance of the ICT in rou-
tine diagnostics.

 Introduction
With the increase of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), the treatment of
severe bacterial infections has become more difficult, especially in high prevalence regions.
Bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by CPE often delay appropriate antimicrobial therapy
and are associated with an increased mortality [1]. The rapid detection of CPE as causative
pathogens of BSI is therefore of paramount importance, as it has the potential to improve
patient management and outcome. Among the different carbapenemases, OXA-48-like, KPC,
VIM, IMP and NDM type carbapenemases are the most important worldwide [2].
The phenotypic detection of carbapenemases can be difficult by standard techniques. The
detection of CPE from blood cultures in routine laboratories is lengthy and usually takes 16–
72 hours after a blood culture is flagged positive (16–20 hours for direct susceptibility testing
plus additional time for confirmatory tests). Reliable phenotypic tests (e.g. inhibitor based
tests) or colorimetric tests (e.g. CarbaNP) require 2 to 24 hours after the first result of the sus-
ceptibility tests [3, 4]. Molecular detection of carbapenemases by PCR is considered the gold
standard, but is costly, not performed in many laboratories, and/or available only during the
main working hours [4].
Immunochromatographic lateral flow tests (ICT) have recently been developed for CPE
detection from cultures on solid media. The ICTs detect epitopes specific for a carbapenemase,
are very rapid (�15 min) and have demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity across
different carbapenemase variants and species [3, 5–7].
The RESIST-3 O.K.N. assay (Coris BioConcept, Gembloux, Belgium) is a new multiplex
ICT based on monoclonal antibodies against carbapenemases of the type OXA-48-like, KPC
and NDM. It has been evaluated for CPE detection from solid media [8, 9]. In the present
study, we developed and evaluated two new protocols for the rapid detection of CPE directly
from positive blood cultures using this ICT.
Material and methods
Ethics
The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital Cologne (approval
number 08–160) and written informed consent was obtained from all healthy volunteers who
donated blood for this study.
Bacterial isolates
In total, 126 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates harboring different carbapenemases and 44
Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates that were carbapenemase-negative were included in the
analysis. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent species (N = 84), followed by Escherichia
coli (N = 53) and Enterobacter cloacae (N = 15) as depicted in Table 1. All isolates were from
the University Hospital Cologne or from previous studies and had been molecularly character-
ized as reported previously [3, 10–13]. Carbapenemase-producing isolates included the three
carbapenemases OXA-48-like (N = 79), NDM (N = 29) or KPC (N = 18).
Inoculation and processing of blood culture bottles
A bacterial suspension equivalent to 0.5 McFarland was diluted 1:1000. Subsequently 10 μL of
this solution was mixed with 5 mL of human blood from healthy volunteers for a final inocu-
lum of ~300 cfu/mL of blood and inoculated into a BD Bactec Plus Aerobic blood culture bot-
tle (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). The bottles were then incubated in a Bactec FX

 automate (Becton Dickinson) until they flagged positive. All positive blood culture bottles
were controlled for purity by inoculation of 100 μL blood culture fluid onto sheep blood agar.
Additionally, 10 NDM producing isolates were tested using BactAlert Aerobic Plus BC bot-
tles (bioMe
´rieux, Nu
¨rtingen, Germany). The procedure was identical to that using Bactec bot-
tles, except that bottles were not incubated in an automated BC system but in a standard
incubator until a color change was visualized at the bottom of the BC bottle.
Immunochromatographic test from blood cultures
From positive bottles, different volumes of blood culture fluid was drawn and mixed with a
hemolyzing agent at the ratio of 5:1. For hemolysis of erythrocytes, different substances were
tested, including 5% saponin (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), Triton-X (Sigma-Aldrich,
Schnelldorf, Germany), ammonium-chloride/potassium hydrogen carbonate [0.15 M NH4Cl,
1 mM KHCO3] (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 10% SDS solution (Fa Gibco, Darmstadt, Ger-
many). After hemolysis, the mixture was spun down in a table top centrifuge (13 000 g, 1 min).
The sediment was washed with 1000 μL aqua dest. If the suspension was still red, it was washed
a second time using 1000 μL phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, the pellet was
lysed with 10 drops of LY-A solution, a lysis solution provided with the test kit, and then 90 μL
of the lysate was transferred to the lateral flow test. The final results of the ICT were read when
they became positive, at the latest after 15 min.
A short protocol using 10% SDS is depicted in Fig 1.

 A second, advanced protocol was developed for improved performance with NDM produc-
ing Enterobacteriaceae, Fig 2. The steps are the same as above, except that after 1 ml BC fluid
was drawn from the BC bottles, 10 μl of a 0.5 M solution of zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) were added
and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37˚C in a dry heating block, shaking at 300/min.
The remaining protocol remained unchanged, including hemolysis with 10% SDS, washing
once or twice and lysis of the pellet with LY-A solution.

All tests were performed and read by the same technician to guarantee a standardized

 Results
In the first part of the evaluation, a protocol for the analysis of blood cultures with the ICT was
developed. Therefore, blood culture bottles were spiked with five different CPE isolates and
the blood culture fluid was processed either without any pretreatment or pretreated with four
different hemolyzing agents. Additionally, different blood culture fluid volumes were assessed.
Without pretreatment, only a low blood culture fluid volume (� 100 μL) could be used which
subsequently resulted in a low sensitivity for NDM-producing isolates (Fig 2D and S2 Fig).
Additionally, the red background of the erythrocytes compromised the reading of the bands of
the ICT. When 1 mL of blood was lysed with 200 μL 10% SDS, the best results were achieved
regarding intensity of the bands and time for the ICT to become positive (Fig 2 and Fig 3).
Other hemolyzing agents (5% saponin, Triton-X or NH4Cl/KHCO3) or a lower blood volume
resulted in either less complete hemolysis (S1 Fig), a lower intensity of the bands on the ICT or
false negative results for NDM (data not shown). For the following evaluation, 126 CPE and 44
carbapenemase-negative isolates were tested after hemolysis with 10% SDS.
Using 1 mL of blood culture fluid volume and after hemolysis with SDS, there was no red
background and the bands on the ICT could be easily read (Fig 2 and S2 Fig). All carbapene-
mases were detected with the new protocol from BC and there were no false-positives, result-
ing in a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for OXA-48-like, KPC and NDM (Table 2). NDM
isolates resulted in fainter bands on the ICT and became positive later (mean 5.8 ± 3.4 min)
than isolates producing OXA-48-like (mean 0.54 ± 0.16 min, P<0.0001) or KPC

 carbapenemases (mean 0.79 ± 0.34 min, P<0.0001), Figs 1 and 2. In a few isolates, NDM
bands of the ICT very faint and appeared only after the full 15 min reading time. For that rea-
son, an advanced protocol was developed which includes an additional 15 min incubation step
with zinc sulfate. Using this protocol, NDM isolates producing faint bands on the ICT could
be read more easily (Fig 4) and the median time to positivity decreased from 5.8 min to 3 min,
p = 0.003. The turn-around-time for the test was 20–30 min with the short protocol and 35–45
min with the advanced protocol.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that with the newly developed protocols KPC, OXA-48-like and
NDM carbapenemases can reliably be detected directly from positive blood cultures within

 20–45 min. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay from blood cultures is equal to the sensi-
tivity reported from solid media [8]. However, both the inoculum and hemolysis procedure
were critical to obtain a sensitivity of 100%. ICTs from positive blood cultures have been
reported for OXA-48 and recently for KPC using a low blood culture fluid volume (40 μL-
100 μL) without hemolysis [14, 15]. Confirming the results of Wareham et al. [15], this proce-
dure worked fine for OXA-48-like producing isolates, but not for NDM with frequent false-
negatives, likely because of a lower sensitivity of the ICT for NDM. Without hemolysis, results
of the ICT were more difficult to read because of the red background of the erythrocytes (Fig
2). Therefore, we used a volume of 1 mL to increase the bacterial inoculum and a hemolysis
procedure to facilitate reading of the ICT. Using the short protocol, all carbapenemases could
be detected and a sensitivity of 100% was achieved. However, NDM positive isolates resulted
in fainter bands compared to KPC and OXA-48, which has also been observed for this ICT
when NDM producing strains were harvested from solid media [9]. Therefore, as recom-
mended by the manufacturer any band appearing on the ICT should be regarded as positive.
For a better performance with NDM producing isolates, we additionally developed an
advanced protocol including 15 min incubation with zinc sulfate. Zinc is a co-factor for
metallo-β-lactamases and it has previously been demonstrated that it improves the detection
of NDM with the ICT from solid media [9]. Using the advanced protocol, isolates with previ-
ously faint bands could be read more easily.
In a recent study NDM could not be reliably detected from blood cultures [16] using the
same ICT as in the present study. However, both a smaller inoculum (100 μL or 500 μL) and
no hemolysis procedure were used. Additionally, the ICT was assessed with blood culture bot-
tles of a different manufacturer (bioMe
´rieux BacT/Alert), which could have further influenced
the results because of a different composition of the broth and resins. For that reason, we also
assessed the performance of the ICT with the two protocols and BacT/ALERT FA Plus BC bot-
tles. A total of 10 NDM-producing isolates was tested with the standard protocol and the
advanced protocol and the results were compared to results of Bactec BC bottles, which were
simultaneously inoculated. With both protocols 10/10 NDM isolates were detected, but bands
were fainter with BactAlert compared to Bactec bottles. With the advanced protocol including
zinc, ICT results for NDM could be read more easily also for BactAlert bottles.
Compared to the previous evaluations [9, 14, 15], in the present study more isolates with
different carbapenemases were included and the multiplex ICT was evaluated for its use
directly from positive blood cultures. The sensitivity and specificity was 100%, which was
higher than previously reported when protocols without hemolysis and a smaller volume of
blood culture fluid were used [14, 16].
Other methods have been reported for the detection of carbapenemases directly from posi-
tive blood cultures, e.g. the Carba NP test, MALDI-TOF hydrolysis assays or molecular meth-
ods, e.g. the Verigene assay [17–19]. Each approach has specific strengths and weaknesses
regarding performance, associated costs and time to result. Compared to the Carba-NP and
the MALDI-TOF hydrolysis assay, the advantage of the ICT-based protocol is the considerably
shorter hands-on time and time to result. For the aforementioned techniques, additional broth
cultures and longer incubation are necessary after a blood culture has become positive, requir-
ing an additional three to five hours compared to 20–30 min for the ICT with the short and
35–45 min with the advanced protocol. With the Verigene assay, the time to result is longer
(~2h) and the assay is considerably more expensive than the ICT. Furthermore, for both the
MALDI-TOF hydrolysis assay and the Verigene assay, additional equipment and software is
necessary. Most importantly, the sensitivity and specificity for NDM, OXA-48-like and KPC
carbapenemases was higher (100%) with our ICT-based protocol than with either Carba NP,

 MALDI-TOF or Verigene assay [17–19]. However, with the ICT VIM and IMP type carbape-
nemases are currently not recognized but can be detected by the other methods.
In this proof of principle study, two new protocols for the detection of CPE from blood cul-
tures using a multiplex ICT was developed and systematically assessed, resulting in the detec-
tion of the most important carbapenemases with 100% sensitivity and specificity. A rapid, 20–
30 min protocol was developed and an advanced protocol for improved detection of NDM
producing isolates. Especially in areas where NDM is frequent and for users of the BacT/Alert
BC system, we recommend the advanced protocol, as reading is easier for NDM. In patients
that are known to be colonized by KPC or OXA-48-like Enterobacteriaceae and where the
exclusion of BSI with these carbapenemases is crucial, the short protocol may be used to fur-
ther reduce handling time.
The study included a large number of molecularly characterized isolates with different car-
bapenemase variants. However, the study has some limitations. Since the prevalence of BSI
with CPE at our institution is too low for a prospective evaluation, we had to use spiked blood
cultures to include a sufficient number of isolates with different carbapenemase variants. To
optimally simulate the conditions in bloodstream infections from patients, human blood was
used instead of horse blood as in other studies [16]. However, our results should be verified in
a routine microbiology laboratory setting with a sufficient number of patients with BSI caused
by CPE. Additionally, we tested aerobic blood cultures from the two main manufacturers only
(Becton Dickinson and bioMe
´rieux). Results might not be identical when other blood culture
media are used. In areas with a high prevalence of other carbapenemases not included in this
multiplex ICT (e.g. VIM, IMP), the present ICT should be combined with other tests for the
detection of these carbapenemases.
Conclusions
The present study demonstrates that with the new protocols, OXA-48-like, KPC or NDM- car-
bapenemases from carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae can be reliably detected by
the new multiplex ICT directly from positive blood culture bottles. With 20 to 45 min time to
result, the new method is more rapid than other currently available assays and can be per-
formed in any routine microbiology laboratory, as no additional equipment is required.
Especially in regions with a high prevalence of OXA-48-like, NDM or KPC-producing Entero-
bacteriaceae and/or in patients known to be colonized by any of these CPE, our protocols may
help to rapidly identify patients with CPE bloodstream infections and early optimize the man-
agement of patients with these difficult-to-treat infections. Further studies are needed to assess
the performance of the ICT in routine diagnostics.
