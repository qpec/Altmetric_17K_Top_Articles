Sexting and its potential links to sexual behavior, including risky sexual practices, have received schol-
arly scrutiny, but this literature is marked by divergent perspectives and disparate findings. To assess
claims regarding the nature of the relationship between sexting and sexual behavior, we conducted
a critical review of the literature and analyzed data from 15 articles via quantitative meta-analytic
techniques. Sexting behavior was positively related to sexual activity, unprotected sex, and one’
s num-
ber of sexual partners, but the relationship was weak to moderate. Additional information, gleaned
from a critical review of included studies, helped contextualize these findings and point to specific
limitations and directions for future research.

With the advent and introduction of new communication technologies come debates about their utility
and morality (Katz, Rice, & Aspden, 2001). As Green and Clark (2015) explained, “Such debates arose
first in the wake of the telegraph and have arisen anew from the development of every new technology
since” (p. 247). One recent debate surrounds the use of digital devices, such as computers and mobile
phones, to create and exchange messages and images of a sexual nature, a practice commonly referred
to as sexting (Ringrose, Gill, Livingstone, & Harvey, 2012). Two discourses dominate this debate, both
in the academic literature and in the popular press (Doring, 2014; Rice et al., 2014). The prevailing dis-
course frames sexting as inherently risky, a deviant behavior in need of intervention and prevention.

 The competing frame positions sexting as a normal, even healthy aspect of sexual expression and rela-
tionships (Doring, 2014). Evidence in support of this normalcy perspective is growing (Cooper, Quayle,
Jonsson, & Svedin, 2016), but far more sexting studies focus on its potential negative consequences and
links to problematic behaviors. In fact, Doring (2014), in a review of 50 academic papers on sexting,
noted that 66% of the articles framed sexting as a risky, unhealthy behavior. Many of those articles
focused on the relationship between sexting and risky sexual behaviors, but a systematic examination
and synthesis of that literature was beyond the scope of her review.
Scholarly interest in the potential links between sexting and risky sexual behavior began with the
publication of the results of the Sex and Tech survey (2008) commissioned by the National Campaign to
Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and Cosmogirl.com. Of the 1,280 teens (ages 13–19) and young
adults (ages 20–26) who participated in the study, 39% of teens and 59% of young adults had sent or
posted sexually suggestive messages, and 20% of teens and 33% of young adults had sent or posted nude
or seminude photos of themselves. Moreover, 38% of teens and 40% of young adults indicated that the
act of sexting someone made dating or hooking up with that person more likely. Close on the heels of the
Sex and Tech survey came the AP-MTV Digital Abuse Study (2009), which involved a survey completed
by a nationally representative sample of individuals ages 14–24. This study documented similar sexting
prevalence rates, adding that sexually active individuals were twice as likely to send nude self- images
than their nonsexually active counterparts. Findings from these seminal studies, as well as some public
sexting scandals, fueled further research on the links between sexting and sexual behavior; however,
contradictory findings in the extant literature make it difficult to determine the nature or strength of
this relationship (Davis, Powell, Gordon, & Kershaw, 2016).
Scholars need a better understanding of the links between sexting and risky sexual behavior to make
evidence-based recommendations for policies and programs focused on promoting safer sex and/or
digital citizenship. Although this literature is still growing, we have amassed enough studies on sex-
ting and sexual behavior to allow for a meta-analytic review, the chief purpose of which, according
Bangert-Drowns (1997), is the “comprehensive, statistical integration of contradictory empirical find-
ings” (p. 244). To this end, we gathered all published, peer-reviewed studies on sexting and sexual behav-
ior and subjected those studies to a meta-analytic and critical review. The following sections describe
how researchers have studied sexting and what we can glean from a critical review and synthesis of this
literature.
Initially, researchers focused their efforts on establishing the prevalence of sexting within particu-
lar populations, but, more recently, scholars turned their attention to sexting correlates (Walrave et al.,
2015). Neither set of studies, however, has produced consistent findings. Studies involving nationally rep-
resentative probability samples of teens report sexting prevalence rates ranging from 2.5% to 24% with
an estimated mean of 10.2%. Prevalence also varies across studies involving adult samples, with some
reporting rates as low as 30% and others as high as 81% (Klettke, Hallford & Mellor, 2014). Scholars (e.g.,
Ringrose et al., 2012; Strassberg, Rullo, & Mackaronis, 2014) have attributed these discrepant findings
to various methodological issues, including sampling problems. For example, nonprobability and adult
samples frequently yield the highest prevalence rates, and, like most sex research, sexting studies rely
heavily on convenience samples (Dunne, 2002; Klettke et al., 2014). The wide variation in sexting preva-
lence rates might also be due to various biases. As Ringrose and colleagues (2012) noted, “It is difficult
to know if ‘
sexting’is under-reported because of social desirability factors (e.g. embarrassment on the
part of respondents) or over-reported because of response biases (those who do it may be more likely to
respond to surveys).” The lack of a consensus definition or standardized measure of sexting only further
complicates matters (Cooper et al., 2016).
These methodological issues might also account for the inconsistent findings regarding the relation-
ship between sexting and risky sexual behavior. For example, some studies have reported a significant

 relationship between sexting and risky sexual practices, such as sex with multiple partners (e.g.,
Benotsch, Snipes, Martin, & Bull, 2013; Dir, Cyders, & Coskunpinar, 2013) or without protection
(e.g., Crimmins & Seigfried-Spellar, 2014; Yeung, Horyniak, Vella, Hellard, & Lim, 2014); others
(e.g., Ferguson, 2011; Gordon-Messer, Bauermeister, Grodzinski, & Zimmerman, 2013) have found
no significant association between sexting and high-risk sexual behavior. There seems to be greater
consensus among researchers regarding the relationship between sexting and sexual activity, more
generally; however, Temple and Choi (2014), who analyzed the second and third waves of data from
a longitudinal sexting study, found that being asked or asking for a sext at Wave 2 was not associated
with sexual activity at Wave 3. As such, we sought to clarify the relationship between sexting, sexual
activity, and risky sexual practices (i.e., having multiple sex partners or unprotected sex) through a
meta-analytic and critical review of this literature.
In addition to these methodological limitations, theoretical issues make it difficult to interpret sex-
ting study findings. Several scholars (e.g., Cooper et al., 2016; Marcum, Higgins, & Ricketts, 2014) have
decried the dearth of theoretically informed research on sexting and have underscored the need for the-
ory testing and building in this area. Although this meta-analysis was not designed to test a theory, per
se, our research questions were informed by two theoretical perspectives, which align with the deviance
and normalcy frames that dominate the sexting literature. First, problem behavior theory (Jessor & Jes-
sor, 1977) offers a compelling explanation for why sexting and risky sexual behavior might be linked,
an assumption of the deviance perspective. Problem behavior theory assumes that different problem
behaviors stem from the same causes and that individuals who engage in one problematic activity will
be more likely to exhibit other problematic behaviors. The deviance perspective that dominates the sex-
ting literature advances similar arguments regarding sexting and sexual risk. If, in fact, sexting is linked
to risky sexual practices, then this might give credence to both the deviance perspective and problem
behavior theory.
Unlike the deviance perspective, which assumes that sexting is part of a constellation of risky prac-
tices, the normalcy discourse frames sexting as a healthy form of sexual expression (Doring, 2014). In
fact, some have argued that sexting can help prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections
by giving individuals a way to vent sexual impulses without acting on them (Lippman & Campbell,
2014). Catharsis theory provides some support for this argument. According to Harris and Scott (2002),
“Applied to sex, the catharsis argument says that consuming sexual media relieves sexual urges, with the
magazine or video acting (perhaps in conjunction with masturbation) as a sort of imperfect substitute
for the real behavior” (p. 312). In the context of sexting, catharsis theory would predict that those who
send or receive sexts would be less likely to engage in sexual activity. Given these competing explanatory
frameworks and contradictory findings regarding the links between sexting, sexual activity, and risky
sexual practices, we developed two research questions to guide our meta-analytic review.
RQ1: What is the nature of the relationship between sexting and sexual activity?
RQ2: What is the nature of the relationship between sexting and risky sexual practices (i.e., having
multiple sex partners or unprotected sex)?
Method
To address our research questions, we relied on meta-analytic techniques, which allow researchers to
synthesize the results of multiple studies in order to measure the overall effect of one variable on another.
We used a random-effects model, which does not assume a single fixed effect exists between variables
in studies carried out in different samples representing different populations (Hedges & Vevea, 1998).

 We followed Lipsey and Wilson’
s (2001) recommendation to employ Pearson’
s r as the standard effect
size representing the relationships between our concepts of interest: sexting and sexual behaviors. The
following sections describe how we approached searching the literature, coding the articles we located,
and building a meta- analytic dataset.
Searching the Literature
We began with exhaustive searches using the PubMed and EBSCO databases. In EBSCO, we confined our
search to the subdatabases that index social science research, which include Academic Source Complete,
Communication Source, ERIC, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES. We used one search term, sexting, and
we limited our searches to published, English-language articles. We concentrated our efforts on gath-
ering published, peer-reviewed articles for two reasons. First, we wanted to avoid drawing on the same
data more than once in our analysis; because many of the conference papers and dissertations that we
examined were eventually published, we excluded the unpublished versions. Second, although including
unpublished manuscripts in a meta-analysis is one way in which researchers attempt to combat publica-
tion bias, Ferguson and Brannick (2012), in an empirical test of this assumption, found that this practice
might actually increase publication bias. As such, we focused on published articles on sexting and sexual
behavior.
In addition to searching for relevant research via library databases, we reviewed the reference lists
of the articles we gathered to identify potentially useful papers that were not indexed by PubMed or
EBSCO. Our database searches and reference list mining produced 234 results. After removing duplicates
and articles that did not meet our inclusion criteria (i.e., quantitative research on sexting and sexual
behavior), we were left with 55 articles.
Coding the Literature
After our literature search, we reviewed each article in order to identify the operational definitions of sex-
ting and sexual behavior that were employed. We identified the following characteristics of each article:
the authors; the publication date; the publication outlet; the study design (i.e., cross-sectional or lon-
gitudinal); the measures of sexting and sexual behavior; the sample size; and, the characteristics of the
sample (i.e., race, age, sex/gender, and sexual identity). After conducting this review of the articles that
we had gathered, we decided to exclude 32 articles because their authors either did not report how they
measured sexting or did not examine the relationship between sexting and sexual behavior. As a result,
we were left with 23 articles that dealt with the variables of interest: sexting, sexual activity, unprotected
sex acts, and sex with multiple partners.
Building a Meta-Analytic Data Set
We used a spreadsheet to record the effects representing the relationships between our variables of inter-
est, and we included these effects regardless of whether they were reported in the article as bivariate
relationships only or within a multivariate model. For example, in some cases, the variables of interest
were only reported in the results of a logistic regression model that also included other independent
variables. In line with current recommendations (Ferguson, 2015), we chose to favor results reported
from multivariate models, if available, or bivariate relationships (e.g., correlation, chi-square with one
degree of freedom). Of the 23 articles that dealt with our variables of interest, eight did not have suf-
ficient information to use for our meta-analysis (i.e., two used analytic categories for sexting that were
not comparable to those in other articles, three measured relevant variables but did not report any rela-
tionships between them, and three used variables that measured more than simply sexting or sexual
behavior and were not comparable to other articles). Due to differences in the way in which these 23

 reported articles data, we contacted the corresponding authors in order to obtain the necessary infor-
mation, but our requests were met with few favorable responses. Unable to secure the necessary data to
conduct our own multivariate analyses, we were faced with a choice between: (a) a meta-analytic data
set that was incomplete due to nonresponse from some authors or (b) a data set that contained estimates
derived solely from information provided in the articles, thereby excluding the eight with insufficient
information. Either choice seemed imperfect, but, ultimately, we chose the second option.
The 15 articles with usable data included six that reported multivariate models (logistic regression
and path analysis/multiple regression) using sexting as an independent variable and sexual behavior as a
dependent variable. We were able to use effect estimates taken directly from these articles. Three articles
reported only bivariate correlations. Six other articles reported multivariate results with sexual behavior
as an independent variable and sexting as a dependent variable, which ran counter to the assumptions of
the theories that guided this analysis and produced effect estimates that were not analytically comparable
to those from the other articles. Thus, for these studies, we calculated the effects as bivariate relationships
(chi-square tests with one degree of freedom) from information available in the articles. We were able
to maintain a high level of quality control by converting the data, as reported in the articles, using a
consistent set of formulas provided in the methodological literature on meta-analysis (Lipsey & Wilson,
2001). Our final meta-analytic spreadsheet included 15 articles drawing on 14 unique data sets (two
articles were based on the same data set). Study characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
These 15 articles identified a total of 50 effects. Eleven effects were originally reported in the articles as
a bivariate Pearson’
s r correlation or equivalent (e.g., phi coefficient, standardized regression coefficient),
requiring no mathematical conversion. The remaining 39 effects required a mathematical conversion to
Pearson’
s r. One effect was reported as a comparison of means between two groups (i.e., individuals
who had sexted and individuals who had not sexted), for which we calculated the standardized mean
difference and converted it to a correlation coefficient. Ten effects were reported as adjusted odds-ratios.
The remaining 28 effects were either (a) reported as chi-square tests with one degree of freedom or (b)
derived from information provided in the article and used to calculate a chi-square test ourselves. For
the latter, we used published frequency counts or percentage breakdowns to construct cross-tabulation
tables between sexting (reported as a “yes” or “no” dichotomy in each article) and sexual behaviors. We
could then conduct significance tests for a chi-square statistic with one degree of freedom. We employed
conversion formulas for effect sizes from Lipsey and Wilson (2001), SPSS macros from Wilson (2005),
and the formula for I2 from Higgins and Thompson (2002). An overview of the effects we identified from
each article is provided in Table 2.
Results
Our analysis relied on data derived from a total of 15 published articles that explored possible links
between sexting and aspects of sexual behavior, including participants’engagement in sexual acts gen-
erally, engagement in unprotected sexual acts, and number of sexual partners. In the following sections,
we expound on the characteristics of these studies and present the results of our meta-analytic review.
Review of Study Characteristics
Article details
Our critical review of the articles included in our meta-analysis uncovered some trends with respect to
the publication of manuscripts that dealt with sexting and sexual behavior as well as the designs of these
kinds of studies. Although we did not restrict our literature search by date, we did not locate any articles
on sexting and sexual behavior that were published prior to 2011. In addition, a majority (53.3%) of

 the studies were published in the last 2 years (i.e., 2014–2015). We also noticed some trends regarding
publication outlets. The vast majority (73.3%) of these articles appeared in health journals (see Table 1).
Conspicuously absent from this list of publication outlets were communication journals, despite the
centrality of communication and communication technologies to sexting.
A closer reading of the included articles revealed additional trends regarding study designs. For
example, despite the lack of prior research on which to base hypotheses, none of the authors posed
formal research questions. Instead, authors specified the general aims or purpose of the study. Six articles
described the authors’hypotheses, and, although these hypothesis statements made multiple predictions,
only one article (i.e., Dir et al., 2013) presented enumerated hypotheses. Only two of the articles that we
reviewed based their predictions on a specific theory or theoretical model (i.e., Dir & Cyders, 2015; Dir
et al., 2013), and all but one study (i.e., Temple & Choi, 2014) relied on cross-sectional data.
All but one study (i.e., Dake et al., 2012) detailed the specific items or instruments used to mea-
sure sexting, and these measures implicated different behaviors, technologies, content, and contexts.
The majority (85.7%) of the 14 studies that described their sexting measures emphasized “sending” in
their operational definitions; seven of these studies also assessed “receiving” sexts. One study (i.e., Jon-
sson et al., 2015) included a question about “posting” sexual content, and Ybarra and Mitchell (2014)
queried participants about having “sent or shown” sexual images of oneself. The communication tech-
nologies associated with sexting also differed across studies. In seven studies, participants were asked
about sexting via text or online, and five studies focused just on text messaging. The measure used by
Ferguson (2011) did not reference a particular medium or technology, and Ybarra and Mitchell’
s (2014)
operational definition included sharing sexual pictures “in person, on the Internet, and on cell phones
and text messaging” (p. 758). The measures employed in these studies also characterized the form and
content of sexts in different ways. Eight studies focused entirely on images, including pictures and videos;
the remaining studies (n = 6) assessed both images and text. Measures most commonly referred to sext
content as sexually explicit, suggestive, or provocative in nature (n = 7). Other measures simply referred
to sext content as “sexual” in nature (n = 2), and six studies included questions regarding nude, nearly
nude, or seminude photos. Ten studies specified the photo or message subject (i.e., images of or messages
about oneself), but only Yeung and colleagues (2014) asked about the relational context in which sexting
occurred.
Sample details
The articles we reviewed reported data from a total of 18,190 participants, and their characteristics are
reported in Table 1. Sample sizes ranged from 88 to 3,715 (M = 1,212.7). Eleven articles described sam-
ples with a higher percentage of female than male participants, and, in the studies with more male
participants, the percentage of males who participated was only slightly higher than the percentage
of females who took part. Of the four studies that mentioned transgender participants (i.e., Jonsson
et al., 2015; Rice et al., 2012, 2014; Ybarra & Mitchell, 2014), data collected from these participants was
excluded from the analysis in all but the 2012 publication from Rice and colleagues. One study (i.e.,
Houck et al., 2014) did not describe the demographic data, including the sex/gender or racial composi-
tion, for the sample as a whole; instead, the authors included data for subsamples of participants. Ybarra
and Mitchell (2014) used a similar technique when reporting the racial composition of their sample.
Two articles (i.e., Jonsson et al., 2015; Yeung et al., 2014) did not specify the race or ethnicity of those
who participated. Six articles described samples dominated by White participants, four indicated that the
samples featured more Hispanic individuals than people from other ethnic groups, and one study sample
was comprised of more African Americans than Whites or Hispanics. Six articles mentioned questions
regarding participants’sexual identity or orientation (i.e., Dir & Cyders, 2015; Gordon-Messer et al.,

 2013; Rice et al., 2012, 2014; Ybarra & Mitchell, 2014; Yeung et al., 2014); the remaining studies either
did not include a sexual identity measure or did not report this data. Finally, although the participants
in these studies ranged in age from 10 to 51 years old, only one study (i.e., Dir & Cyders, 2015) involved
individuals over 30 years old, and, given that the mean age of participants in that study was 21.2 years,
those individuals appeared to be outliers. Four of the studies were mainly comprised of adolescents (typ-
ically defined as ages 12–18); four others consisted of emerging adults (i.e., individuals between the ages
of 18 and 25); and, six studies did not report the age range of the participants. None of the articles that
we reviewed focused entirely on adult samples (i.e., individuals 26 or older).
Meta-Analytic Review
Research Question 1 concerned the nature of the relationship between sexting behavior and engage-
ment in sexual activity in general.1 A total of 10 studies provided data relevant to this research question,
with 23 effects reported (see Table 3). After averaging effects for each study with more than one effect
reported, we conducted a random-effects model. The results produced a medium effect size (Cohen,
1988) of r = .35 (95% confidence interval between .23 and .46). Based on these results, the 10 studies
provide evidence for the assertion that sexting is associated with engaging in sexual activity. There is
also evidence of a great deal of heterogeneity in the effect size across studies based on the coefficient I2,
where a value closer to 100% indicates more heterogeneity (Higgins & Thompson, 2002). Specifically,
the effects for studies using this dependent variable reported relationships anywhere from small (r = .10)
to large (r = .66; Cohen, 1988).
With Research Question 2, we sought to clarify the relationship between sexting behavior and unpro-
tected sexual activity. For these variables, nine studies provided a total of 14 effects (see Table 3); for
studies reporting multiple effects, we calculated an average effect size with each effect weighted equally.
The random-effects model reported an effect size of r = .16 (95% confidence interval between .09 and
.23). The result suggests that sexting co-occurs with unprotected sexual behavior, although the rela-
tionship is small. As with the previous dependent variable, the coefficient I2 indicates a high level of
heterogeneity across the effects included in this analysis (ranging from a small effect of r = .00 to a
medium effect of r = .36; Cohen, 1988).
RQ2 also focused on the relationship between participants’sexting behavior and number of sexual
partners. There were seven studies reporting 13 effects for this relationship (see Table 3). Multiple effects
within an individual study were averaged. The random-effects results indicated an effect size of r = .20
(95% confidence interval between .16 and .23). This result suggests a consistent but small association
(Cohen, 1988) between engaging in sexting behavior and having a higher number of sexual partners.
Contrary to the other two dependent variables, the coefficient I2 suggests more consistency (i.e., less
heterogeneity) within this group of effects, which ranged from small (r = .10) to medium (r = .32).2
Discussion
Sexting and its potential links to sexual behavior have garnered significant scholarly scrutiny in recent
years, but this literature is marked by divergent perspectives and disparate findings (Doring, 2014). The
deviance perspective that dominates this literature assumes that sexting is a risky practice and, therefore,
should be associated with other risky practices, such as having multiple sex partners or unprotected sex;
however, an emerging normalcy discourse challenges these assumptions (Cooper et al., 2016). To assess
these claims, we conducted a meta-analytic and critical review of published research on sexting and its
relationship to sexual behavior. Our review revealed several trends in the sexting literature, including
the types of study designs and samples that were most common. In addition, we uncovered considerable

variability in how sexting was measured across the 15 studies including in our analysis. Despite this
variability, our meta-analysis was able to parse out significant relationships between sexting and three
aspects of sexual behavior: general sexual activity, history of unprotected sex, and number of sexual
partners. The following sections describe possible explanations for and implications of each of these
findings.
First, our meta-analytic review of the 10 studies and 23 effects that dealt with sexting and general sex-
ual activity revealed a substantive relationship between two, which undermines the catharsis argument.
Although this finding might confirm parental concerns about sexting, these results must be interpreted
with caution because the vast majority of studies reviewed were cross-sectional in nature. As such, all we
know is that sexting and sexual behavior co-occur. Sexting might act as a gateway to other sexual activity,
but it is just as likely that sexting is simply a part of an already sexually active person’
s sexual repertoire.
The lack of attention to relational context in the sexting measures employed also makes this finding diffi-
cult to interpret. Including questions or question wording regarding the relationship between the sexters
in future studies would provide valuable data. As Davis and colleagues (2016) noted, this information
is needed to “differentiate between healthy sexual expression within a steady partnership versus a strat-
egy to engage new and casual partnerships that may increase HIV risk” (pp. 139–140). Contextualizing
these practices within particular relationships should invite questions regarding the relational (not just

 the sexual) implications of sexting and bring an important relational lens to bear. For example, studies
linking sexting to sexual activity in committed relationships have limited utility; research on the possible
links between sexting and other aspects of established relationships, such as relational stability and/or
satisfaction, would be of greater use. Two recent publications (i.e., McDaniel & Drouin, 2015; Parker,
Blackburn, Perry, & Hawks, 2013) have examined these links, but the use of small convenience samples
in these studies make additional research warranted. Although communication scholars and theory are
particularly well suited to these kinds of pursuits, none of the articles included in this meta-analysis were
published in communication journals or were framed by communication theory. Studying sexting as a
way of communicating and relating should encourage more communication research on this decidedly
discursive activity and help bring to light previously unexamined aspects of sexting.
Our meta-analytic review also explored the relationship between sexting and two indicators of sexual
risk—sex with multiple partners or without protection. Our analysis of the nine studies that examined
unprotected sex and the seven studies that attended to the number of sex partners reported by par-
ticipants uncovered relatively weak overall associations between engaging in sexting and risky sexual
practices. These findings suggest that, although sexting might be an indicator of risky sexual practices, it
is not a particularly good one. Experimental or longitudinal research on sexting and risky sexual behav-
ior would help establish causality or time-order, but the weak association observed in this meta-analytic
review indicates that the money, time, and energy spent on collecting experimental or longitudinal data
might be better invested elsewhere. Although this finding provides support (albeit weak) for the deviance
perspective and problem behavior theory, future work informed by either or both of these perspectives
would be wise to move beyond discussions of sexual risk to focus on other risky practices that might have
a stronger tie to sexting. Researchers have linked sexting practices to other problem behaviors, such as
intimate partner violence (e.g., Drouin, Ross, & Tobin, 2015) and school truancy or suspensions (e.g.,
Perkins, Becker, Tehee, & Mackelprang, 2014), but, in a review of the literature on sexting and adoles-
cent risk behavior, Van Ouytsel and colleagues (2015) noted that the number of studies on sexting and
sexual risk greatly exceeded the number of articles that dealt with other problem behaviors. Identifying
problem behaviors with stronger ties to sexting would bolster the arguments advanced by proponents
of the deviance perspective and provide more fertile ground for testing problem behavior theory.
When coupled with the findings from our critical review, these results suggest additional avenues for
future research. For example, potentially useful demographic information, namely the sexual identity or
orientation of participants, is missing from the majority (60%) of the articles we reviewed. Furthermore,
only four studies made mention of transgender participants, with one that erroneously characterized
transgender as a sexual rather than gender identity (i.e., Rice et al., 2012) and three that excluded data
from gender nonconforming individuals (i.e., Jonsson et al., 2015; Rice et al., 2014; Ybarra & Mitchell,
2014). The lack of attention to sexual and gender identity in the extant sexting literature is impor-
tant for a few reasons. First, members of sexual minority groups and/or the transgender community
are especially likely to use communication technologies to find potential sexual partners (Kosenko,
Bond, & Hurley, 2016) and several studies (e.g., Beymer et al., 2014) have linked locating sex partners
online or with the help of apps to risky sexual practices. It might be that sexting is also associated with
risky sexual practices among sexual minorities and/or transgender individuals, but without information
regarding the sexual or gender identity of participants, researchers cannot make this determination. This
represents a missed opportunity to explore a potential risk vector in communities disproportionately
affected by sexually transmitted infections, including HIV (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2016). Including questions about sexual identity, allowing participants to select “transgender” or “gender
non-conforming” when asked about their sex, and/or targeting members of sexual minority groups or
the transgender community for future sexting studies would help give us greater insight into the specific
practices of these subgroups.

 Like others who have reviewed the sexting literature (e.g., Cooper et al., 2016; Klettke et al., 2014),
we noted inconsistencies in how sexting is measured across studies. Most (85.7%) of the articles we
examined included questions regarding sending sexts; only half asked about receiving sexts. Although
sending sexts is more of an active, agentic activity than receiving sexts (Temple & Choi, 2014), passive
media consumption, such as exposure to sexual content in television and film, has been linked to early
sexual debut (O’
Hara, Gibbons, Gerrard, Li, & Sargent, 2012) and teen pregnancy (Chandra et al., 2008).
Moreover, receiving a sext might mean being in possession of child pornography and, thus, being subject
to prosecution (Lorang, McNiel, & Binder, 2016). Given the potential legal and behavioral consequences
of passive sexting, researchers should consider including questions or question wording about receiving
sexts in future sexting studies. Future studies should also involve a careful consideration of the content
and form of sexts. The majority of the studies we reviewed defined sexting content as sexually suggestive
or explicit but did not explain what messages or images counted as such. For instance, do breastfeeding
images, which have been flagged on social media sites as sexual and obscene (Ibrahim, 2012), qual-
ify as sexually suggestive or explicit? Relying on such nebulous terminology has proven problematic
in research and legislation on pornography and could create similar problems with respect to sexting
(Suarez, 2008). Some researchers attempted to clarify what was meant by sexually suggestive or explicit
by specifying that sexts involved nude or seminude photos, which leaves written messages out of the
definition. Although focusing on sexual photos might make sense given that the legal cases involving
sexting also center on images (Strassberg et al., 2014), researchers and policymakers will need to deter-
mine if sexting involves more than just pictures. If researchers limit sexting to photographic content,
then sexting measures will need to clearly establish the subject of the photographs. Ten of the studies we
reviewed specified this information in their sexting measures, but one-third of our sample did not, which
could be a source of measurement error. For example, participants may count sending sexual images of
known or unknown others, such as celebrities, as sexting. Given the concerns about sexting resulting in
cyberbullying (e.g., D’
Antona, Kevorkian, & Russom, 2010), defining sexting content in terms of images
of oneself seems unnecessarily limiting, but broadening these definitions to include images of others
creates its own set of problems. Future research in this area must consider which activities AND what
types of content are constitutive of sexts.
Our critical review of the studies included in this meta-analysis revealed additional trends in sexting
research that warrant further discussion. References to theory were all but absent from the articles that
we reviewed, which made it more difficult to interpret study findings. Although these articles establish an
excellent base for theory building, using extant theory to inform future sexting research would provide
a stronger basis for study predictions and make findings easier to explain and interpret. For example,
we noticed that problem behavior theory (Jessor & Jessor, 1977) offered an explanatory framework for
studies rooted in the deviance perspective and that catharsis theory (Feshbach, 1955), although not sup-
ported by our findings, shared some key assumptions with the normalcy perspective. In future studies,
sexting researchers could turn to models of health behavior, such as the health belief model (Rosenstock,
1974), and/or theoretical perspectives rooted in the communication discipline, including the uses and
gratifications perspective (Rosengren, 1974). Each of these theories would lead researchers to examine
different aspects of sexting and sexual behavior and would inevitably improve our understanding of
the relationship between the two. For example, researchers who believe that sexting causes risky sex-
ual behavior might choose to view this relationship through the lens of the health belief model and to
argue that sexting is a cue to action that prompts subsequent unhealthy sexual behaviors. Whereas, a
uses and gratifications perspective would draw a researcher’
s attention to the gratifications sought and
obtained from mediated sexual encounters versus face-to-face ones. Using extant theory to inform sex-
ting research would improve the quality of these studies and broaden the scope of the theories applied.

 Our critical and meta-analytic review is not without limitations. First, this meta-analysis was con-
strained in its scope. Because of discrepancies in how variables were measured and reported, not all stud-
ies on sexting and sexual behavior could be included or compared using meta-analysis. We attempted to
circumvent this issue by requesting original datasets from authors, but our attempts to gather these data
from all authors were unsuccessful. Reasons for data being unavailable ranged from general unwilling-
ness to share data (including data sets collected using U.S. federal funds), authors not storing data after
publication, corresponding author nonresponse, and the unfortunate death of one of the data sets’gate-
keepers. In addition, inconsistencies in how sexual behavior was measured made comparisons across
studies difficult. For example, assessing the relationships between sexting and the number of sexual
partners was complicated by inconsistent time frames measured in each study. Some studies asked par-
ticipants about their lifetime number of sexual partners while others asked about the number of sexual
partners one had had in the last 3 months. In our analyses, we had to assume that this variability between
studies was random and did not introduce systematic error into our overall effect estimates, but future
analysis should test this assumption when more published work is available. We also selected Pearson’
s
r assuming that sexting and sexual behaviors represent constructs that are normally distributed on a
continuous measurement scale. However, very few studies measured sexting or sexual behavior in this
way. Most commonly, these constructs were operationalized with dichotomous measures (e.g., sexted or
not, had sex or not, had multiple sexual partners or not), which provides data that offer straightforward
interpretation but weaker measurement validity. We were also unable to follow recent recommendations
to use standardized regression coefficients (Ferguson, 2015), which may provide a more accurate esti-
mate of statistical relationships by removing “noise” from the bivariate relationship, because we could
not obtain original data and because nine of 15 articles did not use multivariate models with sexting as
the independent variable and sexual behavior as a dependent variable.
Overall, our research presents an overview of the state of the growing research on this communicative
activity and its correlates in real-life sexual behaviors, as well as some important routes to follow in future
research on these topics. Most importantly, additional attention is needed in study design and variable
measurement. Moreover, researchers should put effort into identifying key demographic or background
variables that shape this behavior, ideally from probability samples of the general population. Pursu-
ing these avenues would allow for greater consistency in comparisons across studies and, ultimately,
greater understanding of how sexual communication using new technologies is reshaping the contours
of human sexual experience.
Notes
1 At the suggestion of an anonymous reviewer, we conducted separate analyses to partially account for
age. We compared the effect sizes of articles with only teen participants (e.g., 12–18;14–19) to those
with older participants (e.g., 18–25; 16–29). The results revealed small differences in the effect sizes
between the two populations, but based on the 95% confidence intervals for these effect sizes the
differences were not statistically significant.
2 An anonymous reviewer requested that we present these results, which we derived from both
bivariate and multivariate effect estimates, in a format excluding the bivariate effects (which cannot
account for potentially spurious influences). We did replicate each analysis using only effects
reported in multivariate context (i.e., those listed in Table 2 as adjusted odds ratios or regression
coefficients). For all three dependent variables, the overall effect sizes were replicated, falling within
the 95% confidence interval for the analysis using more studies. For general sexual activity (based on
three studies) and unprotected sex (based on four studies), there were higher levels of heterogeneity.

 For the number of sexual partners, the multivariate results (based on three studies) demonstrated an
extremely low level of heterogeneity. These results, which are available upon request, should be
interpreted with caution given the potential for upward bias.
