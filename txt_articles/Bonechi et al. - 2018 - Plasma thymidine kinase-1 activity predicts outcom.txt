ABSTRACT
The aim of this study was to investigate if thymidine kinase-1 (TK1), a well-known 
proliferation marker, could represent a valid circulating biomarker to identify hormone 
receptor positive (HR+)/HER2 negative (HER2neg) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) 
patients most likely to benefit from endocrine therapy (ET). We used the DiviTumTM 
assay to analyze TK1 activity in cell lysates of three HR+/HER2neg BC cell lines and in 
plasma of 31 HR+/HER2neg MBC patients receiving ET. Blood samples were collected 
at treatment initiation, after one month and at disease progression. CTCs count and 
ESR1/PIK3CA mutations in circulating tumor DNA were performed and correlated with 
TK1 activity. TK1 activity was reduced in the two endocrine-sensitive cell lines after 2 
days of treatment. In patients, high baseline TK1 activity correlated with CTCs positivity 
(p-value=0.014). Patients with low baseline levels of TK1 activity had a significantly 
better PFS compared to those with high baseline TK1 activity (p-value=0.012). Patients 
with an early drop of TK1 activity after one month of treatment had a significantly 
better PFS compared to those who experienced an increase (p-value=0.0026). Our study 
suggests that TK1 could be a potential prognostic, predictive and monitoring marker of 
early ET response in HR+/HER2neg MBC patients.
INTRODUCTION
Nearly 75% of breast cancers express hormone 
receptors (HR) and can be treated with endocrine therapy 
(ET). Approved ET for HR positive (HR+) and HER2 
negative (HER2neg) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) 
include aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen and fulvestrant 
and should be the preferred systemic treatment option 
for patients with minimal visceral involvement, indolent 
disease and limited symptoms [1]. Recently, the mTOR 
inhibitor everolimus and inhibitors of Cyclin-dependent 
Kinases 4 and 6 (palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib) 
in combination with ET, have shown prolongation of 
progression free survival (PFS) for HR+/HER2neg MBC 
patients [2–6]. Although efficacious, these combinations 
are not devoid of important side-effects and elevated costs.

The lack of predictive biomarkers leaves the choice of 
administering ET alone or in combination with a targeted 
agent to empirical considerations.
Given that a large fraction of HR+/HER2neg 
patients will receive extended benefit from ET alone [7], 
it is imperative to develop biomarkers that can identify 
responding patients either before starting ET or early in 
the course of therapy in order to maximize the chances 
of treatment success or to timely re-direct treatment in 
case of inefficacy. Due to the difficulties of obtaining 
repeated tissue biopsies in MBC patients, non-invasive 
biomarkers may be more clinically relevant. In this 
context, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating 
tumor DNA (ctDNA) have shown prognostic significance 
in MBC; however technical constraints limit their use in 
daily clinical practice.
Thymidine kinase-1 (TK1) is an enzyme playing 
a critical role in the synthesis of DNA and in cell 
proliferation [8]. High TK1 levels and activity in primary 
BC tissue correlate with poor prognosis [9, 10] and a 
lesser response to tamoxifen [11]. Cancer cells can secrete 
pathological levels of TK1 detectable in blood [12, 13]. 
High TK1 activity in blood has been described as an 
adverse prognostic factor in BC [14]. Recently, studies 
of TK1 activity in blood using a refined ELISA assay 
(DiviTumTM technology, Biovica International, Sweden) 
in patients with MBC and other solid malignancies have 
suggested that baseline and repeated assessments of 
TK1 activity during the course of treatment, might give 
prognostic information [15–18]. TK1 activity may be 
influenced by certain chemotherapeutic agents both by 
interference with the synthesis of deoxy-thymidine-mono-
phosphate [19–21], with a compensative increase of TK1 
expression, or as a measure of increased cell proliferation 
in the bone-marrow, after chemotherapeutic induced 
leukopenia [16]. Therefore, TK1 activity modifications 
during chemotherapy may not accurately reflect changes 
in the proliferation status of the tumor. On the other hand, 
ET does not interact directly or indirectly with TK1 
activity, and changes in TK1 activity may entirely reflect 
changes in tumor proliferation in this context. However, 
the ability of TK1 to predict the response to ET in patients 
with HR+/HER2neg MBC has yet to be thoroughly 
investigated.
We hypothesized that plasma TK1 activity may be 
a “bona-fide”, non-invasive circulating marker of tumor 
proliferation in patients with MBC. In keeping with the 
well established prognostic role of tumor proliferation in 
HR+ BC, we hypothesized that low baseline levels of TK1 
might identify a sub-group of patients with HR+ MBC 
with extended clinical benefit while on ET. Additionally, 
given the potential of TK1 to be analyzed dynamically 
during the course of treatment, we hypothesized it might 
be a marker of early response to ET for patients with HR+ 
MBC. To this end, we tested TK1 activity in BC cell lines 
treated with ET, and in a cohort of HR+/HER2neg MBC 
undergoing ET and compared it with CTCs count and 
ctDNA analysis.
RESULTS
TK1 activity in HR+/HER2neg BC cells
To investigate TK1 activity as a marker of endocrine 
response in vitro, we tested intracellular levels of TK1 
activity in three HR+/HER2neg BC cell lines treated 
with tamoxifen or fulvestrant. Proliferation of MCF7 and 
T47D cells was significantly inhibited by ET compared 
to vehicle; this was not observed in ZR75-1 suggesting a 
more endocrine resistant phenotype (Figure 1a).
After only two days of treatment, fulvestrant 
induced a significant reduction in TK1 activity in both 
endocrine sensitive models; with tamoxifen, this was 
observed in T47D, but not in MCF7. On the other hand, 
there was no significant change in TK1 activity in the 
ZR75-1 treated with ET (Figure 1b). Intriguingly, the 
reduction of TK1 activity was evident at an earlier time-
point compared to reduction in cell proliferation. Our in 
vitro results therefore support the hypothesis that TK1 
activity might be an early marker of response to ET.
TK1 activity: correlation with clinico-
pathological characteristics in patients 
with HR+/HER2neg MBC
To investigate whether plasma TK1 activity might 
be a marker of endocrine response in patients with HR+/
HER2neg MBC, a cohort of 32 HR+/HER2neg MBC 
patients treated with ET at our Institution was analyzed. 
Blood samples collection and main clinico-pathological 
characteristics are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 1, 
respectively.
Median age of patients was 64 years. The majority 
of patients had estrogen receptor positive (ER+)/
progesterone receptor positive (PR+) primary tumors 
and had received no prior ET for MBC before study 
entry. Median TK1 activity value at baseline (T0) was 
122 DiviTumTM  units per liter (Du/L) (range 20–13,000) 
(Table 2). The patient population was divided into 2 
groups according to individual TK1 values, “TK1 high” 
(≥ 122 Du/L) and “TK1 low” (< 122 Du/L). We found 
no significant association between TK1 status and age, 
line of therapy (0 vs 1-2), number of metastatic sites (1 
vs 2-7) and presence of visceral or bone metastasis. We 
also tested blood samples for the presence of CTCs and 
ESR1 and PIK3CA mutations in ctDNA. As expected, the 
majority of patients were CTC negative (<5 CTC/7.5 mL) 
and ESR1 and PIK3CA wild type (Table 3). Interestingly, 
a statistically significant association between TK1 activity 
at baseline and presence of CTCs (p-value=0.014) was 
found, with the vast majority (87.5%) of CTC positive 
patients also exhibiting high levels of TK1 activity. On the

other hand, no association between TK1 status and ESR1 
or PIK3CA mutations was observed (Table 3).
TK1 activity modulation and correlation with 
outcome in HR+/HER2neg MBC
We wanted to investigate the modulation of TK1 
activity in patients receiving ET at different time-points. 
We observed a reduction in TK1 activity after one month 
of treatment (T1, median value 36 Du/L) and an increase 
at the time of disease progression (T2, median value 331 
Du/L) (Table 2). TK1 activity levels for each patient at T0, 
T1 and T2 are shown in Supplementary Table 1.
Patients were divided into two groups according to 
treatment duration, split at the median PFS (mPFS) value 
(9.6 months); changes of TK1 levels between T0 and T1 
are shown in Figure 3. Interestingly, 12 out of 19 patients 
who experienced a drop in TK1 activity had high baseline 
TK1 levels (Table 4).
We analyzed TK1 activity according to PFS. mPFS 
in the study population was 9.6 months. Patients with low 
baseline TK1 activity (T0) showed a significantly better 
PFS compared to those with high baseline TK1 activity 
(p-value=0.012; Figure 4a). Interestingly, mPFS of 
patients with low TK1 activity was 25.9 months compared 
to only 5.9 month in the group with high TK1.

We also evaluated whether an early change in TK1 
activity, measured after only one month of ET (T1), 
could identify patients with a better outcome. Patients 
experiencing a drop in TK1 levels had a significantly 
better mPFS compared to those who had an increase (14.5 
months versus 3.8 months, respectively; p-value=0.0026) 
(Figure 4b).
CTC positivity and mutations in ctDNA were 
also strong negative prognostic factors in this cohort, as 
expected (Supplementary Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
One well described prognostic feature of HR+/
HER2neg BC is tumor proliferation. We therefore 
hypothesized that a proliferation marker that can be tested 
in plasma could help identify patients with different 
prognosis and response to ET.
TK1 is a well-known proliferation marker. It is a 
cell cycle dependent enzyme contributing to the supply of 
deoxy-thymidine-tri-phosphate via the salvage pathway. 
Its activity rapidly increases after the G1-S transition and 
then declines when DNA replication is completed. TK2 is 
an isoenzyme located in mitochondria which is cell cycle-
independent [22, 23]. The DiviTumTM assay, used in the 
present study to assess TK1 activity, measures both forms 
of TK. However, circulating levels of TK2 are very low 
and have little or no correlation with cell proliferation rate 
[23].
Here we show for the first time that baseline TK1 
activity in plasma of patients with HR+/HER2neg MBC 
can identify patients who derive prolonged benefit from 
ET and that an early drop in TK1 activity can predict ET 
response, both in vitro and in patients’ samples. Results 
from the cell culture analysis support the mechanistic 
rationale for using TK1 activity as a proliferation 
biomarker for ET.
In this study, TK1 activity is reduced in vitro after 
only two days of treatment in endocrine sensitive, but not 
in resistant cells. This effect was observed at an earlier 
time-point compared to cell proliferation experiments, 
suggesting that TK1 reduction can provide early signal 
of endocrine response. Although we acknowledge reports 
indicating the ZR75-1 model as endocrine sensitive, in 
our experiments it demonstrated an endocrine resistant 
phenotype, as previously reported also from other groups 
[24]. The selection of a more endocrine resistant clone 
in different laboratories might explain the discrepancies 
observed.
We retrospectively evaluated TK1 activity levels in 
a cohort of patients with HR+/HER2neg MBC. Median 
TK1 levels at T0 in our study was 122 Du/L which is 
lower than that reported in a previous study analyzing 198 
women with MBC [15]. This study, different from ours, 
also included patients with HR negative or HER2+ disease 
and 47% of patients had received chemotherapy, possibly 
explaining the higher median TK1 activity level observed.
We evaluated TK1 activity levels at serial time 
points for each patient. Median TK1 activity levels were 
found to be higher at disease progression compared to 
baseline. This suggests that TK1 activity levels may 
increase through disease progression and endocrine 
resistance, as a consequence of uncontrolled tumor 
proliferation.
Additionally, we show in this study that TK1 activity 
did not correlate with the number of metastatic sites or 
prior lines of therapy. This underlies that TK1 activity 
may in fact reflect tumor biology (i.e. tumor proliferation) 
rather than tumor burden.
We also investigated the correlation between TK1 
activity and two well-established prognostic biomarkers for 
MBC patients, namely CTCs and ctDNA PIK3CA or ESR1 
mutations. Interestingly, most of the patients with high 
baseline levels of TK1 activity were also CTC positive.

This may suggest a different tumor biology, with higher 
proliferation rates for CTC positive compared to CTC 
negative MBC, warranting further investigation. With 
respect to mutations in ctDNA, we found a cumulative 
frequency of 30%, in line with other studies [25–27]. 
We found no correlation between TK1 activity and 
ESR1/PIK3CA mutations in ctDNA, suggesting that 
mutant tumors do not quantitatively differ from wild type 
tumors in terms of proliferation.
Our data from the clinical cohort show that TK1 
levels both at baseline and after 1 month of ET have a 
strong prognostic impact. Indeed, patients with low 
baseline TK1 had a median PFS of about 26 months, a 
remarkable result as patients in this study are treated 
with single agent ET. This may suggest that patients with 
low levels of TK1 activity at baseline, might represent a 
group with an excellent prognosis with single agent ET, 
where additional treatment with biological agents should

be carefully considered and potentially be avoided. This 
finding warrants further studies. We also confirm in our 
cohort the strong prognostic impact of baseline CTCs 
count and ESR1 or PIK3CA mutational status. Of note, 
baseline TK1 levels seem to perform equally well as 
compared to these two well-established prognostic factors 
with the obvious advantage for TK1 being less expensive 
and readily implementable in every diagnostic laboratory. 
We did not compare TK1 with standard tumor markers 
in our cohort; however, TK1 was previously shown as a 
better predictor of outcome compared with CA 15-3 in 
patients with metastatic breast cancer [15].
In line with the in vitro results, our data show that 
patients who experienced an early drop in TK1 activity 
after one month of treatment had a better outcome 
compared to patients who experienced an increase. In 
particular, the latter group had a mPFS of only 3.8 months, 
an extremely poor outcome in this patient population. This 
suggests that a dynamic evaluation of the changes in TK1 
activity during the early phases of treatment might give 
important predictive information. Of note, this information 
is given by TK1 after only 1 month of therapy, as opposed 
to 4-6 months typically used for clinico-radiological 
disease assessment in the clinic. Overall, patients with 
a better outcome were those who had low baseline TK1 
levels and those who experienced a drop in TK1 activity 
after one month of ET. Nevertheless, mPFS in these two 
groups was substantially different (25.9 vs 14.5 months, 
respectively). The fact that the majority of patients who 
experienced a drop in TK1 activity had high baseline 
TK1 levels (i. e. a worse prognosis) might explain this 
difference in terms of survival.
It may be hypothesized that patients with both 
low baseline TK1 levels and a drop in TK1 activity 
might represent the subgroup with the best outcome; this 
hypothesis warrants further investigation in a larger cohort 
of patients.
TK1 might be used as an early marker of outcome 
not only for ET but also for other therapies, such as 
biological agents. Interestingly, early results from 
a neoadjuvant trial of palbociclib for patients with 
early stage luminal BC have shown that serum TK1 
levels were highly concordant with Ki-67 assessed 
by immunohistochemistry on tumor tissue biopsies,

experienced an increase in TK1 at T1 (b).

suggesting that TK1 may represent a valid pharmaco-
dynamic marker in this context [28] that can be serially 
tested in the blood without the need of tumor tissue.
Our study is not without limitations; it is based on 
a mono-institutional, small cohort of patients. Therefore, 
results may suffer from unintended selection biases and 
require confirmation in larger studies. However, the 
PFS differences observed are very large and likely to be 
clinically meaningful.
In conclusion, our data suggest that TK1 activity 
may be a useful prognostic and monitoring marker of early 
response for luminal MBC patients treated with ET. The 
potential of this biomarker is currently being investigated 
by our group in a larger patient dataset from a randomized 
clinical trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Proliferation assay and cell lysates collection in 
BC cell lines
Three HR+/HER2neg BC cell lines were used: 
MCF7, kindly provided by Dr Rachel Schiff, Baylor 
College of Medicine, Houston (TX), T47D and ZR75-1, 
kind gift of Dr Livia Malorni, Institute of Food Science-
CNR, Avellino, Italy. Cells were authenticated on January 
2016 by short tandem repeat DNA analysis. All cell lines 
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium 
(DMEM) with 4.5g/glucose and L-glutamine (Lonza) 
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine 
serum (FBS) (Hyclone), L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin 
(100 IU/mL) and streptomycin (0,1 mg/mL) (Sigma-
Aldrich).
For proliferation assays, 3,000 cells/well for each 
cell line cultured in their individual medium were plated 
in 96-well plates in triplicate, 24 hours before beginning 
treatments, which consisted of either tamoxifen 10-7 M, 
fulvestrant 10-7 M or ethanol (vehicle) for six days. Media 
were replaced every 48 h. Cell growth was assessed at 
day zero, two, four and six by methylene blue assay. 
Cells were fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde grade II (Sigma-
Aldrich) and stained with 0.05% methylene blue (Sigma-
Aldrich). The dye was subsequently extracted with 3% 
HCl (Carlo Erba) and absorbance measured at 655 nm.
Cell lysates for TK1 activity were prepared 
following a standard protocol from Biovica International, 
Uppsala, Sweden. Briefly, 150,000 cells/well for each 
cell line, cultured in their individual medium were 
plated in 6-well plates in triplicate. After 24 hours, 
treatments consisting of tamoxifen 10-7 M, fulvestrant 
10-7 M or ethanol (vehicle) were added. After two days 
of treatment, cell extracts were prepared by scraping cells 
into one mL of ice cold RB lysis buffer (Biovica). Cell 
extracts were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and snap 
frozen at -80°C until shipment to Biovica laboratories, 
where the cell extracts were thawed, spun for 10 min 
and supernatants collected. Cell extract samples were 
analyzed using the DiviTumTM assay (see below) without 
any knowledge of cell-line or treatment identifiers. TK1 
activity was normalized to total protein concentration for 
each sample, determined by use of the BCA Protein Assay 
(Thermo Scientific Pierce).
Study population
A cohort of 32 consecutive HR+/HER2neg MBC 
patients treated with 0-2 lines of ET for MBC and 
candidate to start a new line of ET at Hospital of Prato was 
studied. Blood samples for TK1 and mutational analyses 
were collected in K2EDTA tubes (BD Bioscences) and for 
CTCs count in CellSave preservative tubes (Menarini, 
Silicon Biosystem) at ET initiation (T0), after 4 weeks 
of ET (T1) and at time of progressive disease (T2) 
(Figure 2). Tumor assessment as per RECIST criteria 
was performed every 3 months or as clinically indicated. 
Clinical information was recorded on a dedicated e-CRF. 
All patients signed an informed consent for study 
participation. The protocol was reviewed and approved by 
the local Ethic Committee.
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) count
CTCs count was performed by CellSearch® System 
(Menarini, Silicon Biosystem) as previously described 
[29]. CellSearch™ Epithelial Cell kit was used to select 
EpCAM positive cells, isolated CTCs were stained with 
the nuclear dye 4′, 6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), 
anti-cytokeratin 8, 18 and 19-phycoerythrin (PE) labelled 
antibodies. CD45 antibody labelled with allophycocyanin 
(APC) was used to dye white blood cells. Labelled cells 
were analyzed and counted in the CellTracks® Analyzer 
II. CTCs were identified and enumerated according to the 
criteria specified by the manufacturer's instructions.
Plasma collection
Blood samples were processed within 1 hour from 
withdrawal by centrifugation at 1600g for 10 min at 4°C 
followed by a centrifugation at 14000g for 10 min at 4°C. 
Plasma was aliquoted and stored at -80°C.
TK1 activity
TK1 activity was determined by a refined ELISA 
based method, the DiviTumTM assay (Biovica, Instructions 
for Use, www.biovica.com) at the Biovica laboratory 
without access to, or any knowledge of, patient or tumor 
characteristics.
For this assay, a sample is diluted 1/10 in a 
dilution buffer. The diluted sample is transferred to a 
well with reaction mixture on the assay plate. During an 
incubation, Bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine 
analogue, is phosphorylated to BrdU-monophosphate 
 Oncotarget

by the thymidine kinase (TK) in the sample, then further 
phosphorylated and incorporated in an immobilized 
DNA-strand in the well. After washing the wells, BrdU 
incorporation is detected by ELISA technique using an 
anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody conjugated to enzyme 
alkaline phosphatase and a chromogenic substrate. The 
product of the alkaline phosphatase reaction is yellow, and 
the absorbance is measured at 405 nm with the reference 
wavelength of 630 nm. Absorbance is measured after 
30 and 60 min of incubation. The measured signal is 
proportional to the TK-activity of the tested sample and 
given as DiviTumTM units per liter (Du/L), calculated from 
a standard curve based on calibrators of known activity. 
The DiviTumTM assay has a working range from 20-4000 
Du/L and a coefficient of variation at 100 Du/L of <20%. 
Two control samples included with the kit are run in 
parallel.
ESR1 and PIK3CA mutations
ctDNA was extracted from 1-5 mL of plasma using 
QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen). Samples 
were subjected to 10 cycles of target pre-amplification 
step using Sso Advanced preamp Supermix and ESR1-
537-538 primer PCR Preamp assay, PIK3CA E542-E545 
and PIK3CA H1047-G1049 primer PCR Preamp assay 
(Bio-Rad). PIK3CA E542K, E545K, H1047R and ESR1 
D538G, Y537N, Y537S mutations were detected using 
QX200TM droplet digital PCR system (Bio-Rad) using 
PrimerPCRTM mutation assays (Bio-Rad). Positive and 
negative controls for each mutation were used. Samples 
allele frequency (fractional abundance, FA) was calculated 
by Bio-Rad QuantaSoft package and displayed as mutated 
DNA/(mutated DNA + wild type DNA)+/- 95% CI. 
Patients were considered mutated if the upper error bar of 
negative control FA did not overlap with the lower error 
bar of samples FA.
Statistical analyses
For proliferation assays, three biological replicates 
were performed. Mean value absorbance of all experiments 
+/- standard error of the mean (SEM) was plotted. For 
TK1 activity in cell extracts, three biological replicates 
were performed, and results from one representative 
experiment were plotted. Values were normalized against 
TK1 activity in the presence of ethanol and represented 
means of three technical replicates +/- SEM. Two–way 
ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was 
performed with GraphPad Prism version 7.03 and p-values 
<0.05 were considered significant.
In order to examine TK1 as a continuous variable 
in an univariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards 
modelling, we tested the model assumptions. The model 
met the proportional hazards assumption (Schoenfeld 
Individual test p = 0.55) [30] but failed the test for 
linearity assumption (Supremum Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test p = 0.04) [31]. As a possible solution of this violation, 
TK1 was categorized using the maximally selected rank 
statistics [32] to determine the optimal cutpoint (104 
Du/L). Ultimately median value (122 Du/L) was chosen 
since close to the returned optimal cutpoint and its 
widespread use in literature.
Correlations between blood markers and clinico-
pathological factors were evaluated through Kruskal-
Wallis or Fisher exact test with R version 3.4.0 (http://
cran.r-project.org).
PFS was computed as the time interval between the 
collections of T0 and T2 sample or death. Observation 
time of patients still on treatment at the time of analysis 
was censored at the last visit. Distribution of PFS was 
estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared 
with the log-rank test (R version 3.4.0). Median follow-
up time, estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier inverse 
method, was 30 months (95%CI= 21.6-NA).
As exploratory analyses, the p-values and supportive 
analyses should be considered descriptive only.
