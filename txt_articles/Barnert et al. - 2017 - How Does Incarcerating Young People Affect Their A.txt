BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite the widespread epidemic of mass incarceration in the US, 
relatively little literature exists examining the longitudinal relationship between youth 
incarceration and adult health outcomes. We sought to quantify the association of youth 
incarceration with subsequent adult health outcomes.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 14 344 adult participants in the National Longitudinal 
Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We used weighted multivariate logistic regressions to 
investigate the relationship between cumulative incarceration duration (none, <1 month, 
1–12 months, and >1 year) before Wave IV (ages 24–34 years) and subsequent adult health 
outcomes (general health, functional limitations, depressive symptoms, and suicidal 
thoughts). Models controlled for Wave I (grades 7–12) baseline health, sociodemographics, 
and covariates associated with incarceration and health.
RESULTS: A total of 14.0% of adults reported being incarcerated between Waves I and IV. Of 
these, 50.3% reported a cumulative incarceration duration of <1 month, 34.8% reported 1 
to 12 months, and 15.0% reported >1 year. Compared with no incarceration, incarceration 
duration of < 1 month predicted subsequent adult depressive symptoms (odds ratio 
[OR] = 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11–1.80; P = .005). A duration of 1 to 12 months 
predicted worse subsequent adult general health (OR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.12–1.96; P = .007). 
A duration of >1 year predicted subsequent adult functional limitations (OR = 2.92; 95% CI, 
1.51–5.64; P = .002), adult depressive symptoms (OR = 4.18; 95% CI, 2.48–7.06; P < .001), 
and adult suicidal thoughts (OR = 2.34; 95% CI, 1.09–5.01; P = .029).
CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative incarceration duration during adolescence and early adulthood 
is independently associated with worse physical and mental health later in adulthood. 
Potential mechanisms merit exploration.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Despite 
compelling data on the unmet health needs of 
incarcerated youth, no existing studies describe the 
longitudinal relationship between the duration of 
incarceration of young people and subsequent adult 
health outcomes.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The study demonstrates 
that youth incarceration is independently associated 
with worse adult physical and mental health 
outcomes. This fi
 nding suggests an important role 
for pediatricians to protect youth from potentially 
harmful effects of incarceration and mitigate any 
downstream negative effects.

Despite widespread use of 
incarceration in the United 
States, relatively little literature 
examines longitudinal effects 
of youth incarceration on adult 
health outcomes. 
1, 
 
2 The United 
States incarcerates a far greater 
proportion of youth than any other 
developed country. 
3 Each year, 
US law enforcement arrests 1.3 
million juveniles (ie, children and 
adolescents <18 years old). 
4 Of these, 
∼80% will be reincarcerated as 
adults.5 Currently, 6.8 million adults, 
or 2.8% of the adult population, are 
under correctional supervision. 
6 
Furthermore, data from the US 
Bureau of Justice Statistics indicate 
that the lifetime imprisonment risk 
in a state or federal prison is 1 out 
of 17 for white men, 1 out of 3 for 
African American men, and 1 out of 
6 for Hispanic men. These numbers 
increase dramatically if incarceration 
in jails is also included. These trends 
of racial and ethnic disparities in 
confinement are similar for females. 
7
Incarcerated juveniles have 
extremely high rates of unmet health 
needs. 
8 
 
– 
11 Forty-six percent of newly 
detained juveniles have urgent 
medical needs requiring immediate 
attention.9 Seventy percent of 
incarcerated juveniles have at least 1 
psychiatric disorder. 
12 Additionally, 
12% of juveniles currently 
incarcerated, both boys and girls, are 
expecting a child of their own. 
10
Despite compelling, nationally 
representative cross-sectional data 
on the health status of incarcerated 
youth, there is surprisingly little 
evidence on the relationship 
between juvenile incarceration and 
subsequent adult health outcomes. 
1, 
 
2 Overall, youth and adults with 
a history of incarceration have 
markedly worse health statuses 
than their non–justice involved 
counterparts. 
8, 
 
13 However, the 
linkage between youth incarceration 
and subsequent worse adult health 
might not be causal. First, many 
social determinants of poor health 
(eg, poverty and racial/ethnic 
minority status) are also associated 
with greater incarceration risk.14 
Second, individuals with poor 
health may be at higher risk for 
incarceration (eg, many drug users 
and mentally ill offenders are 
incarcerated instead of treated). 
1 
Causal associations, however, are 
also plausible. Although incarceration 
may have some short-term health 
benefits, mostly due to the provision 
of health care during detention 
and removal from risk-promoting 
environments, incarceration is 
more frequently postulated to have 
overall detrimental effects on health. 
1 
Proposed mechanisms for a causal 
linkage between incarceration and 
worse subsequent health include 
exposures within detention facilities 
(eg, communicable diseases) and 
physical or sexual traumas sustained 
while confined. 
1 Confinement 
also likely erodes mental health. 
15 
Postincarceration social and 
economic disadvantages related to 
stigma, disrupted social networks, 
and negative “social” credentials 
may also contribute to the higher 
rates of fatal drug overdose, suicide, 
and posttraumatic stress seen in 
former adult prisoners.15, 
 
16 Finally, 
incarceration may compound existing 
socioeconomic and psychosocial 
health risks in vulnerable 
populations. 
1
The small existing literature on 
longitudinal health effects of youth 
incarceration suggests that any 
incarceration during adolescence 
or young adulthood is associated 
with worse general health, 
 
17 severe 
functional limitations, 
 
1 stress-related 
illnesses, such as hypertension, 
 
2 
and higher rates of overweight and 
obesity during adulthood. 
18 We 
add to what is currently known 
by examining a dose measure of 
incarceration. The longitudinal 
impact of the cumulative duration of 
incarceration on subsequent adult 
health is unknown. We sought to 
quantify the association between 
youth incarceration and a diverse set 
of adult health outcomes.
METHODS
We analyzed data from the National 
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent 
to Adult Health (Add Health), a 
nationally representative survey 
of US youth sampled from 1994 to 
2008. 
19 The baseline survey (Wave 
I) included 20 745 youth in grades 7 
to 12. The 14-year follow-up survey 
(Wave IV) included 15 701 adult 
participants between the ages of 24 
to 34 years old. The Wave I baseline 
survey collected data on social 
determinants of health and youths’ 
health status. The Wave IV Add 
Health follow-up survey collected 
data on if, when, and for how long 
individuals were incarcerated as well 
as data on adult health status. The 
Wave IV survey included in-home 
interviews conducted within the 
home residences of participants as 
well as interviews conducted within 
correctional settings. 
20
We sought to measure the association 
between youth incarceration and 
subsequent adult health outcomes. 
We define “youth” as adolescents 
and young adults <25 years old. 
To explore possible temporal 
associations between incarceration 
and subsequent adult health, 
we excluded the 311 individuals 
incarcerated before their Wave I 
interview. The resulting analytic 
sample included 14 344 participants 
with full data on the primary 
predictor, primary outcome (adult 
general health), and sample weight.
Incarceration Predictor Measures
To provide a dose measure of 
incarceration exposure, which, to our 
knowledge, no previous study has 
done, we constructed our primary 
predictor as cumulative lifetime 
duration of incarceration before 
Wave IV (ages 24 to 34 years). Based 
on the distribution of the raw data 
and a conceptual cut-point of “short, 
”

“medium, 
” and “long” durations of 
incarceration, we constructed our 
cumulative incarceration duration 
predictor to have 4 categories: no 
incarceration (reference category), 
a duration of <1 month, a duration 
of 1 to 12 months, and a duration of 
>1 year. To construct our cumulative 
incarceration duration predictor, we 
combined responses to the Wave IV 
questions asking, “Before your 18th 
birthday, about how much total time 
did you spend in jail or detention?” 
and “Since your 18th birthday, about 
how much total time have you spent 
in jail or detention?” For ease of 
interpretation, we also created a 
dichotomous variable (ever versus 
never incarcerated) to display our 
descriptive and bivariate results.
Adult Health Outcomes
We chose adult health outcomes for 
their high prevalence and impact 
on morbidity, mortality, and overall 
well-being. Our primary adult health 
outcome was adult general health, 
which may incorporate aspects 
of physical health, mental health, 
and psychosocial well-being. We 
selected the secondary outcomes of 
adult functional limitations, adult 
depressive symptoms, and suicidal 
thoughts to assess for differential 
associations between youth 
incarceration and physical versus 
mental health domains.
Adult General Health
To measure adult general health, we 
used self-report of health, a well-
studied general health measure 
associated with morbidity and 
mortality. 
21 In both Waves I and IV, 
participants were asked to rate their 
health as excellent, very good, good, 
fair, or poor. Given the response 
distributions in the relatively young 
and healthy Add Health population, 
we used a dichotomous measure of 
worse self-rated health for responses 
of good, fair, or poor. A sensitivity 
analysis using the alternate cut-
point of defining worse self-related 
health as fair or poor revealed similar 
results.
Adult Functional Limitations
Adult functional limitations are an 
important physical health outcome 
that likely also has implications 
for mental health. We created a 
dichotomous measure of adult 
functional limitations based on 
a question that asked whether 
health problems created limitations 
with climbing flights of stairs. We 
categorized individuals as having 
functional limitations if they reported 
any limitations in climbing stairs.
Adult Depressive Symptoms
We selected adult depressive 
symptoms as a secondary adult 
health outcome because depression 
is one of the most common adult 
mental health disorders and is 
associated with poor social and 
physical health. 
22, 
 
23 In Waves I 
and IV, respondents completed the 
short-form Center for Epidemiologic 
Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10), 
a well-validated 10-item screening 
for depression symptoms in the 
previous 7 days. 
24 We used Wave IV 
CESD-10 data to construct the adult 
depressive symptoms variable and 
Wave I CESD-10 data to construct 
the baseline depressive symptoms 
variable. Consistent with previous 
studies, we categorized a score 
≥11 as a dichotomous measure of 
depressive symptoms. 
25
Adult Suicidal Thoughts
Suicidality is an important concern in 
adult populations 
22 and is especially 
a risk for incarcerated and formerly 
incarcerated adults. 
26 We created 
a dichotomous measure of adult 
suicidal thoughts using the Wave 
IV single-item response that asked 
respondents if they had seriously 
considered suicide in the previous 12 
months.
Covariates
We selected covariates that were 
associated with both 
youth incarceration and adult 
health 
1, 
 
2, 
 
11, 
 
17; these included baseline 
health variables, sociodemographic 
variables, and, based on existing 
literature, additional variables 
associated with incarceration and 
health. Potential covariates were 
identified based on the literature and 
then confirmed to be significantly 
associated with the main predictor 
(duration of incarceration) and 
main outcome (adult general 
health) in bivariate analyses. 
Specifically, the baseline health 
variables were baseline general 
health in the general health model, 
baseline functional limitations in the 
functional limitations model, and 
baseline depressive symptoms and 
suicidal thoughts in the depressive 
symptoms and suicidal thoughts 
models. For the Wave I baseline 
health variables of general health, 
depressive symptoms, and suicidal 
thoughts, questions were asked that 
were identical to those for the adult 
Wave IV participants. For baseline 
functional limitations, because an 
identical item was not asked in Wave 
I, we created a dichotomous measure 
using a single-item response that 
asked participants whether they had 
difficulty using their limbs because 
of a permanent physical condition. 
The sociodemographic variables 
included: self-reported gender; race/
ethnicity (white, African American, 
Hispanic, other); age; parents’ 
reported household income; and 
highest level of parental education. 
We also included other individual, 
family, and community-level factors 
that may be associated with both 
incarceration and health based on 
findings from existing literature. 
Individual-level covariates were: 
(1) school connectedness, measured 
via a 5-item scale (Cronbach’s α, 
0.83)27; (2) high-school grade point 
average, constructed based on 
self-reported most recent grades 
in English or language arts, math, 
history or social science, and science; 
(3) perceived likelihood of attending 
college (single-item, 5-point scale

asking about likelihood of attending 
college); (4) delinquent behaviors, 
measured by the 12-item serious 
delinquency scale (Cronbach’s α, 
0.81) 
28; (5) regular alcohol use, 
defined as drinking at least 2 days 
per month; (6) cigarette use, defined 
as use at least once during the 
previous 30 days; (7) marijuana use, 
defined as use at least once in the 
previous 30 days; (8) other drug use, 
defined as using “other drugs, 
” such 
as, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 
phencyclidine (PCP), cocaine, ecstasy, 
inhalants, or mushrooms at least 
once in the previous 30 days. Family-
level covariates were: (1) family 
household structure, (2 biological 
parents, 2-parent [≥1 nonbiological], 
single parent, other); (2) history of 
parental incarceration, measured 
by self-report in Wave IV; and (3) 
family connectedness, measured via 
a 3-item scale (Cronbach’s α, 0.77). 
29 
Community-level covariates were: 
(1) perceived neighborhood safety, 
(single-item response asking about 
perceived neighborhood safety; 
reference category was “yes”); (2) 
neighborhood unemployment, 
as defined by the 1990 census 
standardized unemployment rate 
by block group; and (3) proportion 
of neighborhood adults without 
a high-school diploma, defined as 
the standardized proportion of 
community adults age ≥25 years 
without a high-school diploma or 
equivalent, and also measured by 
the 1990 census unemployment rate 
by block group. All of the covariates 
were constructed based on self-
report items from the adolescent 
in-home Wave I interviews with the 
exceptions of household income, 
grade point average, parental 
incarceration, neighborhood 
unemployment, and neighborhood 
high school graduation rate.
Data Analysis
We first explored descriptive 
statistics and then performed 
bivariate and multivariate analyses 
on the relationship between 
baseline social determinants of 
health, baseline health status, 
incarceration, and subsequent 
adult health outcomes. F-test and 
χ2 analyses were performed to 
compare covariates and adult health 
outcomes between individuals 
with a history of incarceration and 
those without any incarceration. 
Multivariate logistic regressions 
investigated the relationship 
between an individual’s cumulative 
duration of incarceration before 
Wave IV (age 24–34 years) and 
subsequent adult health outcomes 
(self-reported general health, 
functional limitations, depressive 
symptoms, and suicidal thoughts) 
in Wave IV, controlled for the 
covariates described above. We 
conducted analyses in Stata version 
12.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX) 
using the “svy” suite of commands 
to account for the Add Health survey 
design elements of stratification, 
clustering, and weighting. We tested 
for interactions by gender and race/
ethnicity by creating interaction 
terms and by exploring analyses 
stratified by gender and race/
ethnicity. The study was approved 
by the UCLA institutional review 
board.
RESULTS
Fourteen percent of the analytic 
sample of 14 344 young adults 
reported ever being incarcerated. Of 
these, 50.3% reported a cumulative 
incarceration duration of <1 month, 
34.8% reported 1 to 12 months, 
and 15.0% reported >1 year ( 
Fig 1). 
At Wave IV, 57.6% of the analytic 
sample reported very good or 
excellent health, our reference 
category; 42.4% reported poor, fair, 
or good health. Similarly, at Wave IV, 
6.1% reported functional limitations, 
6.9% reported suicidal thoughts 
in the last 12 months, and 16.0% 
described symptoms of depression in 
the last week.
Bivariate analyses demonstrated 
worse adult health outcomes 
for individuals with a history 
of incarceration compared with 
those without incarceration. 
These unadjusted results were 
statistically significant for all 4 
of the adult health outcomes and, 
overall, show a strong statistically 
significant relationship between 
social determinants of health, such 
as poverty, parental education, 
and parental incarceration, and 
subsequent incarceration risk 
( 
Table 1).
Multivariate analyses revealed 
that any length of incarceration 
was associated with higher odds 
of having worse adult health 
( 
Table 2). In the model for adult 
general health, we found that 
compared with no incarceration, a 
cumulative incarceration duration 
of 1 to 12 months predicted worse 
subsequent adult general health 
(odds ratio [OR] = 1.48; 95%

of adult functional limitations, 
adult depressive symptoms, and 
adult suicidal thoughts, all in the 
incarceration >1-year category.
Several covariates held significance 
across at least 3 models: gender, 
household income, family 
connectedness, grade point 
average, and the baseline health 
variables. The associations between 
incarceration and our primary 
outcome, general health, were 
not modified by gender or race/
ethnicity.
DISCUSSION
Our results suggest that 
incarceration during adolescence 
and early adulthood is independently 
associated with worse physical and 
mental health outcomes during 
adulthood. This relationship holds 
even when accounting for baseline 
health and key social determinants 
of health. Our findings linking youth 
incarceration and worse adult 
health are consistent with previous 
longitudinal studies, which have 
similarly shown an association 
between youth incarceration and 
worse long-term health. 
1, 
 
2, 
 
17, 
 
18 Our 
study adds the dimension of a dose 
measure of incarceration. Given 
the wide variations in sentencing 
and amount of justice involvement 
different youth may experience, it is 
critical to understand how duration 
of incarceration might affect health. 
We found that an incarceration 
duration of >1 month is associated 
with worse adult general health, and 
a duration of >1 year is associated 
with worse adult mental health 
and adult functional limitations. 
In addition to the observation of a 
temporal relationship between youth 
incarceration and subsequent worse 
adult health outcomes, the higher 
ORs in the >1-year category observed 
when we examined the specific 
adult health outcomes of functional 
limitations, depressive symptoms, 
and suicidal thoughts provide 
evidence that a causal relationship 
may exist.
Given the current era of mass 
incarceration, this observation 
has important health implications. 
Incarcerated and formerly 
incarcerated individuals face 
disproportionate morbidity and 
mortality compared with their 
non–justice involved counterparts, 
which may compound any social 
vulnerabilities and additionally 
hinder opportunities for success. 
8, 
 
16 
For the 1.3 million children and 
adolescents arrested in the 
United States each year, 
 
4 
incarceration may systemically 
degrade their healthy development. 
The juvenile justice system, 
initially created to rehabilitate 
youthful offenders, has become 
increasingly harsh and punitive. 
30 
Our findings speak to an urgent 
need for pediatricians to increase 
efforts to: (1) prevent youth 
incarceration by addressing key 
behavioral and social determinants 
of health and (2) mitigate 
potential downstream health 
effects of youth incarceration. 
Our findings align with the 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
2011 policy statement on youth 
involved in the juvenile justice 
system, which put forth several 
actions pediatricians can take 
to improve the health of justice-
involved youth, including to actively 
advocate to reduce the number of 
youth confined.8
Our study has several potential 
limitations. First, the baseline Add 
Health survey was a school-based 
sample, which could have created 
a selection bias for our study. Also, 
although follow-up surveys were 
conducted in correctional settings, it 
is possible that survey participants 
with a history of incarceration 
may still have been lost to follow-up 
at a higher rate. However, it is 
reassuring that the observed 
incarceration rate at Wave IV is 
consistent with national figures. 
31 
It is also important to note that 
the age range for our adult health 
outcomes was relatively wide 
(24–34 years old). Overall, we 
postulate that these limitations may 
have led to an underestimate of the 
associations between cumulative 
incarceration and health, because 
higher-risk, justice-involved 
individuals and those with worse 
adult health outcomes would have 
been less likely to be included 
in the final Add Health sample. 
Additionally, the study sample 
included some individuals first 
incarcerated after young adulthood 
(ie, 25–34 years old); however, 
our sensitivity analyses excluding 
these individuals did not 
substantially alter our results. 
Another issue is the possibility 
of unmeasured factors that we 
were not able to account for in 
our analysis, such as system-level 
differences within correctional 
settings, including the quality 
of health care delivered and the 
overall conditions of confinement. 
Despite these limitations, our 
findings support that mechanisms 
causally linking youth incarceration 
with worse adult health may exist. 
These potential mechanisms merit 
additional examination and, if 
confirmed, intervention.
CONCLUSIONS
Given the high prevalence of 
incarceration, coupled with a 
current bipartisan willingness to 
pursue criminal justice reform, 
 
32 the finding that more months 
in confinement as adolescents 
and young adults correlates with 
worse adult health outcomes is 
timely. Individuals with a history of 
incarceration may need increased 
support to overcome any long-term 
detrimental physical and mental 
health effects of incarceration. 
Health professionals can stand at 
the forefront of the juvenile and

criminal justice reform movement 
to more fully explore how justice 
reform can adapt alongside 
healthcare reform to develop 
systems that may protect rather 
than harm the health of these 
youth. Pediatricians have the 
opportunity to improve youths’ 
long-term adult health outcomes 
by ensuring that unnecessary, 
potentially harmful exposures to 
incarceration are minimized and, 
for those exposed, to monitor 
for and mitigate any negative 
downstream health effects.
