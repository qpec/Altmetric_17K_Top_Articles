SUMMARY
Associative learning is an essential brain process
where the contingency of different items increases
after training. Associative learning has been found
to occur in many brain regions [1–4]. However, there
is no clear evidence that associative learning of vi-
sual features occurs in early visual areas, although
a number of studies have indicated that learning of
a single visual feature (perceptual learning) involves
early visual areas [5–8]. Here, via decoded fMRI neu-
rofeedback termed ‘‘DecNef’’ [9], we tested whether
associative learning of orientation and color can be
created in early visual areas. During 3 days of
training, DecNef induced fMRI signal patterns that
corresponded to a specific target color (red) mostly
in early visual areas while a vertical achromatic
grating was physically presented to participants. As
a result, participants came to perceive ‘‘red’’ signifi-
cantly more frequently than ‘‘green’’ in an achromatic
vertical grating. This effect was also observed
3–5 months after the training. These results suggest
that long-term associative learning of two different
visual features such as orientation and color was
created, most likely in early visual areas. This newly
extended
technique
that
induces
associative
learning is called ‘‘A-DecNef,’’ and it may be used
as an important tool for understanding and modifying
brain functions because associations are funda-
mental and ubiquitous functions in the brain.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The complete experiment consisted of four stages: retinotopic
mapping [10], color classifier (decoder) construction, associative
decoded fMRI neurofeedback (A-DecNef) training, and post-test
stages (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In the
color classifier construction stage, we measured blood-oxy-
gen-level-dependent (BOLD)-signal multi-voxel patterns in the
primary and secondary visual areas (V1/V2) evoked by the pre-
sentation of red-black, green-black, and gray-black gratings of
both vertical and horizontal orientations (Figure S1) and con-
structed a color classifier [11]. The outputs of the classifier repre-
sented the calculated likelihood of red color presented to the
participants. The classifier’s mean percentage of correct color
classification was approximately 70%, which was significantly
above chance (50%, t11 = 13.66, p < 0.001 for red; t11 = 11.60,
p < 0.001 for green; one-sample t test with Bonferroni correction).
The color classifier construction stage was followed by 3 days
of the A-DecNef training stage (Figure 1). Participants were un-
knowingly trained to create an internal association between a
physically presented achromatic vertical grating and the neural
activation for a specific target color (red), although no chromatic
stimulus was presented in the display. Participants were asked
to do the following: ‘‘Maintain your gaze at the fixation point at
the center of the display. While the achromatic grating is being
presented, try to somehow regulate your brain activity to make
a to-be-presented solid gray disk as large as possible.’’ The par-
ticipants were not informed that the size of the disk was propor-
tional to the red likelihood. In short, participants were trained to
induce the activation patterns for red in V1/V2 without having any
real red stimulus presented. By pairing such activation patterns
with a physically presented vertical grating, we tested whether
associative learning of vertical orientation and red occurred.
Figure 2 shows the red likelihood change due to A-DecNef
training. The red likelihood on days 1, 2, and 3 was significantly
higher than the red likelihood on day 0 (the red likelihood for the
achromatic vertical grating during the color classifier construc-
tion stage). These results suggest that BOLD-signal patterns
similar to those evoked by the red-black grating in V1/V2 were
successfully induced during A-DecNef training. None of partici-
pants reported that they had the target color in mind during
A-DecNef training (Table S1).

 Next, we tested whether associative learning between the
orientation and color was indeed created as a result of A-DecNef.
We conducted a psychophysical measurement during the post-
test stage where a two-alternative-forced-choice task was
performed to construct chromatic psychometric functions for
each participant. Vertical, horizontal, and oblique gratings were
used (Figure 3A). Assuming that A-DecNef training should
have no effect on oblique stimuli, the oblique stimuli were used
as control orientations for the vertical orientation. The color of
the inner grating was tinted from green to red in eight steps,
passing through a neutral gray. Participants were instructed to
judge whether the inner grating was red or green. Figures 3B
and 3C show the mean red response percentage in the A-DecNef
group and the control group (see the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures), who did not participate in A-DecNef training,
respectively. Results of a three-way mixed-design ANOVA
(group as a between-participants factor, and orientation and co-
lor as within-participants factors) on the red response percent-
age indicated a significant main effect of color (F2.6,42.1 =
142.82, p < 0.001; ε = 0.38), and a significant three-way interac-
tion (F7.1,113.5 = 2.18, p = 0.040; ε = 0.51). Testing for a simple
interaction for each group showed that the interaction between
orientation and color was significant for the A-DecNef group
(F14,224 = 2.41, p = 0.004), indicating that A-DecNef training
resulted in an orientation-specific shift of the chromatic psycho-
metric function. In contrast, a simple interaction between orienta-
tion and color was not significant for the control group (F14,224 =
1.32, p = 0.20). Thus, it is suggested that A-DecNef training,
which targeted V1/V2, created perception of a color associated
with an orientation.
We further tested whether A-DecNef successfully created the
orientation-specific color perception in the A-DecNef group. If
A-DecNef successfully associates the vertical orientation with
red BOLD-signal patterns, we should observe the following
two aspects in the A-DecNef group. First, the point of subjective
equality (PSE) to produce 50% red responses (and therefore
50% green as well) for the vertical orientation should be signifi-
cantly more greenish in terms of the tinted color level in the inner
gratings than for the other orientations. Second, the red
response percentage should be significantly higher than chance
when the vertical orientation was at the neutral gray, which is
defined as the PSE for the control oblique orientation.
First, a cumulative Gaussian function was fitted to the data
from each individual participant, and the PSE for each orientation
was defined as the stimulus level with the 50% red response. We
applied one-way repeated-measures ANOVA (orientation as a
within-participants factor) to the PSE for each orientation. The
ANOVA showed that a main effect of orientation on the PSE
was significant (F1.3,14.2 = 7.28, p = 0.013; ε = 0.65). The PSE
for the vertical orientation was significantly different from those
for the horizontal (t11 = 2.87, p = 0.015) and the oblique orienta-
tion (t11 = 2.77, p = 0.018), indicating a significant shift of PSE for
the orientation used in A-DecNef training.
Next, we obtained the red response percentage for the vertical
orientation at the neutral gray. Perception of the neutral gray for
the oblique (control) grating was not significantly affected by
A-DecNef, because two-way mixed-design ANOVA (group as a
between-participants factor, and color as a within-participants
factor) on the chromatic psychometric function of the oblique
grating showed no significant effect of group (F1,16 = 2.51,
p = 0.133). The red response percentage for the vertical orienta-
tion was defined as the fitted value of a cumulative Gaussian
function at this neutral gray. The red response percentage for
the vertical grating was significantly higher than chance (t11 =
3.70, p = 0.004). These results suggest that A-DecNef created
red perception in an achromatic vertical grating.
Is the effect of associative learning temporary or long-lasting?
To test this, the chromatic psychometric functions for vertical,

 horizontal, and oblique orientations for the A-DecNef group were
measured after 3–5 months and compared with those of the con-
trol group. The results of detailed analyses (Figure S2; Table S2)
indicate that psychometric functions were significantly different
between the groups and that the vertical grating continued to
be perceived as reddish in the A-DecNef group even several
months later, and that the A-DecNef group showed significant
differences in the PSE between vertical and other orientations
even after 3–5 months. These results show that the association
between orientation and color is long-lasting, as has been re-
ported for other types of associative learning [12, 13].
It is worth noting that the green perception tends to increase
for the horizontal gratings after A-DecNef training. In Figure 3B,
the PSE for the horizontal grating was significantly different
from that for the oblique grating (t11 = 2.25, p = 0.046), whereas
in Figure 3D, there was the tendency that the red (or green)
response percentage for the horizontal grating at the neutral
gray was lower (or higher) than chance (t11 = �1.89, p = 0.086).
Three to five months later (Figure S2A), the same tendency
was observed. The PSEs for the horizontal and oblique gratings
were significantly different from each other (t8 = 5.56, p < 0.001),
and the red (or green) response percentage was significantly
lower (or higher) than chance (t8 = �7.84, p < 0.001).
A-DecNef training was specifically based on BOLD-signal pat-
terns in V1/V2. However, we thought that it was necessary to test
whether similar neural activities in different areas other than V1/
V2 had occurred by A-DecNef and contributed to the association
between the orientation and color. If A-DecNef training induced
color-specific brain activities in areas other than V1/V2, then
BOLD-signal patterns in those areas should in turn properly pre-
dict the red likelihood in V1/V2 on a trial-by-trial basis. The results
of a searchlight analysis [14] that explored the whole brain utiliz-
ing an L1 regularized least-square regressor (Supplemental
Experimental Procedures) indicated the following results. First,
during the color classifier construction stage, in which partici-
pants were presented with the chromatic gratings, the colors
were accurately classified based on BOLD-signal patterns in
V1/V2 and in ventral areas including the fourth visual area (V4)
(Figure 4A). Second, during the color classifier construction
stage, the red likelihood in V1/V2 was best predicted by
BOLD-signal patterns in V1/V2 and moderately by those in
ventral areas including V4 (Figure 4B). However, during the
A-DecNef training, the BOLD-signal patterns in areas other
than V1/V2 including V4 were very poor predictors of the red like-
lihood in V1/V2 (Figure 4C). These results collectively indicate the
following points. The result of the color classification accuracy
(Figure 4A) indicates the ability of the classifier to extract chro-
matic information in V4 when there is chromatic information in
V4. Furthermore, multi-voxel patterns in V4 can predict chro-
matic information in V1/V2 by the regressor during the color clas-
sifier construction stage (Figure 4B). Thus, the result that the
same regressor did not predict chromatic information in V1/V2
from multi-voxel patterns in V4 during the A-DecNef training (Fig-
ure 4C) suggests that there was little chromatic information in V4
and other areas during the A-DecNef training. These results
further suggest that the A-DecNef predominantly modified
BOLD-signal patterns and the red likelihood in early visual areas.
We also examined A-DecNef-related brain activation by a con-
ventional generalized linear model (GLM) analysis (Figure S3A) to
test whether V1/V2 is the main locus of the A-DecNef. Although
we found significant activation in nine areas during the A-DecNef
training stage, the activation in these areas was negligibly corre-
lated with the perceptual change, except for V1/V2 (Figure S3B).
Note that the searchlight analysis was based on classification

 performance of ‘‘red’’ versus ‘‘green,’’ whereas the GLM analysis
was conducted on BOLD-signal amplitudes, which could be
caused by multiple factors. Considering these differential as-
pects of the analyses, it is suggested that during the A-DecNef
training stage, activations not only involved in red perception
but also in the training procedure occurred.
These results together suggest that early visual areas, rather
than the higher areas including V4, are most likely to be the
main locus of the associative learning of the orientation and color
in the current study. However, we need to say that we cannot
completely reject the possibility of the contribution of other areas
to the current associative learning. Future studies to test whether
induced associative learning transfers between eyes or between
retinal locations may be helpful to clarify the roles of the higher
visual areas in the current associative learning.
There are neurons that respond to a specific combination of
orientation and color in V1 [15–18]. Does this invariably indicate
that associative learning of orientation and color should occur
in V1? The answer is negative. For example, it is well known
that there are neurons in V1 that best respond to a specific
orientation. However, this does not necessarily mean that
learning of the orientation occurs in V1. In a similar manner of
logic, the existence of neurons that respond best to a specific
combination of orientation and color does not necessarily
indicate that learning to associate a specific combination of
orientation and color occurs in V1. There has been no study,
to our knowledge, that indicates that neurons responding to
a specific combination of orientation and color learned to
induce perception of the color when the orientation was pre-
sented as a cue.
What is a possible neural mechanism for the current associa-
tive learning? As mentioned above, A-DecNef training resulted in
not only reddish perception on an achromatic vertical grating but
also greenish perception on an achromatic horizontal grating.
Simple pairing of a vertical orientation and red color would not
produce greenish perception on the horizontal grating [19].
Because of the nature of A-DecNef training, which uses the
red-versus-green output of the classifier, it is likely that the
A-DecNef training created a neural state that biases toward a
‘‘more likely to be red, not green’’ state as opposed to an abso-
lute red state. We therefore suggest that A-DecNef changed the
balance of mutual inhibition between the neuronal populations
that process red and green (Figure S4; see [18, 20]). This sug-
gests that for the current associative learning to occur, mere acti-
vation of the population for red paired with a vertical grating is not
sufficient. The neurofeedback training that leads to the more
likely to be red, not green state, which is perhaps due to changes
in the balance of mutual inhibition between neuronal populations
for red and green, may be necessary. This may be why associa-
tive learning between orientation and color as a result of pairing
of a real colored stimulus with an achromatic grating has never
been reported. Future studies have to test the validity of the
model. One good way is to use a grating in a different color
(e.g., blue) during the DecNef training to test shifts in psychomet-
ric functions after association of a given color and achromatic
grating.
One may wonder whether the McCollough effect [19] is
compelling evidence of associative learning in early visual areas.
In some cases, the McCollough effect has been discussed as a
possible manifestation of associative learning of orientation and

 color in early visual areas. However, there is no clear evidence for
such a claim. First, it is a matter of great controversy whether the
McCollough effect occurs in early visual areas [21–24]. In addi-
tion to the studies that advocate the V1 origin hypothesis of
the effect [25, 26], there are a substantial number of studies
that are against this view. One fMRI study found BOLD activity
changes in multiple areas and concluded that the McCollough
effect is created through top-down processing from a high-
cognitive area [27]. Another fMRI study found that the left ante-
rior portion of the color-selective area in the ventral occipital
cortex, presumably V4 alpha, was significantly activated in
association with the McCollough effect [28]. Second, in the
McCollough effect, the induced color is complementary to the
exposed color. This indicates that in contrast to the associative
learning in the present study, the McCollough effect is not due
to a simple form of association but rather reflects the complexity
of the underlying neural mechanism, including adaptation pro-
cesses [29]. Some studies have suggested that the McCollough
effect is not due to associative learning [30].
The orientation-color association in the present study is also
distinguishable from the anti-McCollough effect [31], in which
the exposed color rather than the complementary color is
perceived in a configuration similar to the McCollough effect
[31]. First, the anti-McCollough effect shows 100% interocular
transfer, suggesting that it takes place in higher areas than in
V1. Second, the anti-McCollough effect lasts less than a day,
whereas the orientation-color association in the present study
lasts at least 3–5 months. These lines of evidence indicate that
neither the McCollough effect nor the anti-McCollough effect
has provided any clear evidence that associative learning occurs
in early visual areas.
To summarize, using A-DecNef, we created long-lasting asso-
ciative learning of orientation and color in early visual areas.
These results suggest that early visual areas are most likely to
be the main locus of the associative learning, although we cannot
completely reject the possibility of the contribution of other areas
to the associative learning.
