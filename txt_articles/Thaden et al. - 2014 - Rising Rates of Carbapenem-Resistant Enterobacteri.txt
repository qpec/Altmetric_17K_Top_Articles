Abstract
OBJECTIVE—Describe the epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) 
and examine the effect of lower carbapenem breakpoints on CRE detection.
DESIGN—Retrospective cohort.
SETTING—Inpatient care at community hospitals.
PATIENTS—All patients with CRE-positive cultures were included.
METHODS—CRE isolated from 25 community hospitals were prospectively entered into a 
centralized database from January 2008 through December 2012. Microbiology laboratory 
practices were assessed using questionnaires.
RESULTS—A total of 305 CRE isolates were detected at 16 hospitals (64%). Patients with CRE 
had symptomatic infection in 180 cases (59%) and asymptomatic colonization in the remainder 
(125 cases; 41%). Klebsiella pneumoniae (277 isolates; 91%) was the most prevalent species. The 
majority of cases were healthcare associated (288 cases; 94%). The rate of CRE detection

 increased more than fivefold from 2008 (0.26 cases per 100,000 patient-days) to 2012 (1.4 cases 
per 100,000 patient-days; incidence rate ratio (IRR), 5.3 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22–
22.7]; P = .01). Only 5 hospitals (20%) had adopted the 2010 Clinical and Laboratory Standards 
Institute (CLSI) carbapenem breakpoints. The 5 hospitals that adopted the lower carbapenem 
breakpoints were more likely to detect CRE after implementation of breakpoints than before (4.1 
vs 0.5 cases per 100,000 patient-days; P < .001; IRR, 8.1 [95% CI, 2.7–24.6]). Hospitals that 
implemented the lower carbapenem breakpoints were more likely to detect CRE than were 
hospitals that did not (3.3 vs 1.1 cases per 100,000 patientdays; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS—The rate of CRE detection increased fivefold in community hospitals in the 
southeastern United States from 2008 to 2012. Despite this, our estimates are likely 
underestimates of the true rate of CRE detection, given the low adoption of the carbapenem 
breakpoints recommended in the 2010 CLSI guidelines.
Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have emerged as a global threat.1 Patients 
with CRE infections have adverse outcomes, including mortality risk ranging from 48%–
71%.2–5 Multidrug-resistant organisms, such as CRE, have been labeled as “a serious threat 
to public health” by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)6(p36) and “one of 
the three greatest threats to human health,” by the World Health Organization.7(p1939) 
Although CRE are still relatively uncommon in the United States, the rate of carbapenem 
resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is increasing. Among cases due to Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, for example, the percentage due to meropenem-resistant strains increased from 
0.6% to 5.4% from 2004 to 2008.8
Little is known about the epidemiology of CRE in community hospitals, despite the fact that 
the majority of healthcare in the United States is provided in this setting.9 These hospitals 
often have difficulty identifying trends, given the sporadic occurrence of cases, and as a 
result are less likely to view CRE as an important pathogen in their facilities.
Despite the global emergence of CRE, no clear consensus has emerged in regard to the 
method of detection. Because of early studies that showed that some CRE had carbapenem 
minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in the susceptible range,10 the Clinical and 
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recently lowered breakpoints for carbapenem 
antibiotics.11 Adherence to the new CLSI breakpoints requires that laboratories take 
additional steps to validate the lower breakpoints. Many laboratories have not yet adopted 
the new carbapenem breakpoints, potentially resulting in decreased detection and 
underestimation of CRE prevalence. The objectives of our study were to (1) describe the 
epidemiology of CRE in a network of community hospitals in the southeastern United 
States, (2) evaluate the methods that these hospitals use to detect CRE, and (3) better 
understand how differences in laboratory methods influence CRE detection.
METHODS
Participating Hospitals
This mixed-methods study included data from 25 community hospitals in North Carolina, 
South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia from January 2008 through December 2012. All 
hospitals were members of the Duke Infection Control Outreach Network (DICON), which

 has been described elsewhere.12 All 25 hospitals responded to the questionnaire and had 
complete surveillance data for the entire 5-year period.
Surveillance Data
Local infection preventionists (IPs) performed prospective surveillance for CRE using 
standardized protocols in all hospitals. The IPs collected and entered data on patients with 
CRE isolates into a centralized database, including the following variables: infection versus 
colonization, year of birth, sex, ethnicity, date of hospital admission, previous admissions to 
the same hospital during the preceding year, specimen collection data and type, dialysis 
dependence, and whether admission was from home or another healthcare facility. IPs also 
entered monthly patient-days for each hospital. Incidence rates were calculated as the 
number of patients with CRE per 100,000 patient-days. To determine infection versus 
colonization, IPs examined the medical record and spoke to the primary healthcare providers 
to evaluate for signs or symptoms consistent with infection. All IPs received identical 
training and followed identical standard protocols in this regard.
Study Patients and Definitions
All CRE-positive cultures from the surveillance database were reviewed for inclusion. If an 
individual patient had multiple hospitalizations during which CRE was detected, only the 
first isolate and admission were included; thus, a single patient was counted once even if 
they produced multiple cultures with CRE over the 5-year period. Location of acquisition 
was defined as follows: (1) “community onset, healthcare associated” was defined as 
infection or colonization occurring less than 48 hours after admission plus the presence of 1 
or more of the following healthcare risk factors: previous hospitalization, surgery, dialysis, 
or residence in a long-term care facility in the 12 months preceding identification or the 
presence of an invasive device; (2) “community acquired” was defined as identification 
occurring less than 48 hours after admission without 1 of the above healthcare risk factors; 
and (3) “hospital onset” was defined as identification that occurred 48 hours or more after 
hospital admission.13 CRE were defined using CDC definitions based on phenotypic 
susceptibility.6 Enterobacteriaceae had to be nonsusceptible to 1 or more of the carbapenem 
antibiotics according to the breakpoints of the individual microbiology laboratories. CRE 
phenotype was determined by automated platforms according to local practice (Vitek 2 
[bioMérieux] or Microscan Walk-away [Dade Behring]) using panels provided by the 
manufacturer for this purpose.
Questionnaire Data
Qualitative laboratory data were obtained from all 25 hospitals using questionnaires. First, 
the North Carolina Department of Public Health (NC DPH) sent surveys to all North 
Carolina acute care hospital microbiology laboratories and hospital IPs in July 2012. The 
survey requested information regarding testing methods used to identify CRE, the automated 
MIC system in use, whether the 2010 CLSI carbapenem breakpoints had been implemented, 
and what additional actions were taken if a CRE was detected. Thirteen study hospitals 
participated in this survey.

 Hospitals from which no survey data were available, including those in North Carolina that 
did not respond to the survey and all DICON-affiliated hospitals in South Carolina, Virginia, 
and Georgia, received a telephone call to the hospital microbiology laboratory supervisor 
from April to September 2013. Telephone survey questions mirrored the questionnaire used 
by the NC DPH. In addition, the telephone survey addressed local site practices of active 
CRE surveillance. Data from 12 additional hospitals were obtained through this second 
round of telephone surveys.
Statistics
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the epidemiology of CRE in the 25 study 
hospitals with complete surveillance data. Poisson regression was used to determine trends 
in the rates of CRE detection and to calculate relative rates and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs). Overdispersion was observed and corrected using the Pearson χ2 as the dispersion 
parameter. Generalized estimating equation regression using a Poisson distribution was used 
to test for trend while controlling for nonrandom clustering of each outcome. Denominator 
data were normalized by log transformation. SAS software version 9.3 was used for all 
calculations (SAS Institute). A 2-sided P value of less than or equal to .05 was considered 
significant for all tests.
One of the 25 hospitals was known to have endemic CRE and was excluded from trend 
analyses (over 50% of the detected CRE strains in the network came from this hospital). For 
the analysis involving rates of CRE detection based on adoption of the 2010 CLSI 
guidelines, we performed 2 comparisons using Poisson regression methods described above. 
First, among the microbiology laboratories that adopted the 2010 guidelines (n = 5), we 
compared rates of CRE detection before and after the guidelines were adopted and 
implemented. Second, we limited the time period to 2011–2012 and compared rates at 
switch hospitals to those at nonswitch hospitals.
RESULTS
Surveillance Data
Bed size for the 25 study hospitals ranged from 100 to 657 (median, 210 beds). A total of 
305 unique patients with CRE from 16 hospitals were identified during 7,312,847 patient-
days of surveillance (cumulative incidence rate of CRE detection, 4.17 cases per 100,000 
patient-days).
Patients with CRE had symptomatic infection in 180 cases (59%) and asymptomatic 
colonization in the remainder (125 cases; 41%; Table 1). K. pneumoniae (n = 277; 91%) was 
the most prevalent species. The most common anatomical sites involved were urine (n = 
181; 59%), sputum (n = 51; 17%), and blood (n = 21; 7%). The majority of cases were 
healthcare associated; 184 (60%) were community-onset, healthcare-associated cases, and 
104 (34%) were hospital-onset, healthcare-associated cases. Of the 184 community-onset, 
healthcare-associated CRE cases, 103 (56%) were in patients who were admitted from a 
nursing home or other extended care facility.

 Laboratory Questionnaire Data
Questionnaire data from the clinical microbiology laboratories of 25 community hospitals 
are presented in Table 2. Twenty hospitals (80%) had not adopted the 2010 CLSI 
breakpoints for carbapenems. All laboratories used automated MIC detection systems; 13 
(52%) of the hospitals used the Vitek 2 system, and 12 (48%) used the Microscan system. 
Verification of carbapenemase production was performed in house with the modified Hodge 
test in 10 hospitals (40%), by forwarding on to an outside laboratory for testing in 13 
hospitals (52%), or not at all in 2 hospitals (6%). Twenty-three laboratories (92%) reported 
that, if CRE were detected, they would notify the local infection control personnel. No 
hospitals had adopted active CRE surveillance programs.
Trends in CRE Detection
Trends and rate analyses were limited to the 25 hospitals with complete surveillance and 
questionnaire data. When data from 1 additional hospital where CRE was known to be 
endemic were excluded, the incidence rate of CRE detection was 1.2 cases per 100,000 
patient-days and the median rate of CRE detection per hospital was 0.79 cases per 100,000 
patient-days (interquartile range [IQR], 0–1.71). The rate of CRE detection increased more 
than fivefold from 2008 (0.26 cases per 100,000 patient-days) to 2012 (1.4 cases per 
100,000 patient-days; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 5.3 [95% CI, 1.22– 22.7]). This increase 
remained statistically significant even after adjusting for clustering of CRE by hospital (P = .
01; Figure 1).
The rate of CRE detection was significantly higher among hospitals that used the Vitek 2 
system as opposed to the Microscan (2.47 vs 0.54 CRE isolates detected per 100,000 
patient-days; P = .01; Table 3). Hospitals that verified the presence of carbapenemases with 
an in-house modified Hodge test tended to detect CRE at a higher rate than those that sent 
the strains to a referral laboratory (2.36 vs 1.00 CRE isolates detected per 100,000 patient-
days; P = .07). Finally, hospitals that would notify infection control when CRE were 
detected tended to detect more CRE than those hospitals that would not (mean, 1.64 vs 0 
CRE isolates detected per 100,000 patient-days; P = .16).
The 5 hospitals that adopted the new CLSI carbapenem breakpoints were more likely to 
detect CRE after implementation of the breakpoints than before implementation (4.1 vs 0.5 
isolates per 100,000 patient-days; IRR, 8.1 [95% CI, 2.7– 24.6]; P < .001). Finally, hospitals 
that implemented the CLSI carbapenem breakpoints were more likely to detect CRE than 
were hospitals that did not (3.6 vs 1.1 isolates per 100,000 patient-days; P = .01).
In light of the above findings, we performed an exploratory analysis using the Poisson 
model constructed above. After controlling for whether the new CLSI carbapenem 
breakpoints had been adopted and implemented, detection of CRE still increased during the 
time period, although the trend was no longer statistically significant (P = .08). A separate 
Poisson regression model limited to the 19 hospitals that had not yet adopted the guidelines 
also demonstrated an increasing trend in CRE detection (P = .02). These findings suggest 
that the increasing CRE trend is related to both changes in testing and increasing endemicity.

 DISCUSSION
Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to use mixed methods to describe and compare 
epidemiologic trends and microbiologic practices in a large number of community hospitals. 
There are major and interrelated conclusions from our analysis: (1) the rate of CRE 
detection in community hospitals is rapidly and significantly increasing, (2) microbiology 
laboratories in community hospitals use widely varying techniques for detection and 
reporting of CRE, and (3) more preparation is needed to combat this emerging threat.
The rate of CRE detection increased more than fivefold in our network of community 
hospitals from 2008 to 2012. The higher rate of CRE infection likely stems from a 
combination of factors, including increased use of broad-spectrum carbapenems, the ease 
with which carbapenemase enzymes can be transmitted among bacteria, and increased 
transmission between patients in healthcare settings. For example, 94% of cases of CRE 
infection detected in our study were healthcare associated. Given the recent finding that 30% 
of patients in long-term acute care hospitals are colonized with carbapenemase- producing 
K. pneumoniae,14 there are likely to be reservoirs of CRE within acute care hospitals, skilled 
nursing facilities, and hemodialysis centers that are driving the increase in CRE transmission 
in healthcare settings.
The use of more sensitive detection methods by clinical microbiology laboratories also 
contributes to recent increases in CRE. Microbiology laboratories in our network used 
different automated MIC systems, carbapenem breakpoints, and methods to verify the 
presence of carbapenemases (if any verification was done at all). Rates of CRE detection 
varied on the basis of these different approaches. We believe the low adoption of the 
decreased carbapenem breakpoints from the 2010 CLSI guidelines results in a significant 
underestimation in the true rate of CRE detection in our network of community hospitals. In 
our cohort, the rate of CRE detection was over threefold higher in hospitals that adopted and 
implemented the 2010 CLSI guidelines. Interestingly, there was a statistically significant 
association between the use of the Vitek 2 automated MIC system and increased rate of CRE 
detection. Previous head-to-head studies have demonstrated that the Microscan is at least 
equivalent to if not superior to the Vitek 2 system in detecting CRE.15 Thus, the cause of 
this association is unclear. It is conceivable that hospitals using Vitek 2 in this study had 
other confounding factors that caused this observation (eg, higher colonization pressure or 
worse CRE prevention practices).
The relatively low rate of CRE detection among the community hospitals in this study 
punctuates the importance of using networks of hospitals to identify larger epidemiologic 
trends and to better understand the importance of microbiology laboratory practices in 
detecting these pathogens. The overall number of CRE detected in individual hospitals is 
generally not sufficient to make firm conclusions regarding trends. As a result, practitioners 
in these single institutions would find it difficult to detect the increased rate of CRE 
detection or assess how variability in laboratory practices influences CRE detection. 
Analysis of surveillance data from the DICON network of community hospitals, however, 
has demonstrated that multiple epidemiologically important bacteria— extended-spectrum

 β-lactamase–producing bacteria13 and now CRE—are present and increasing in number in 
community hospitals in the United States.
There are several limitations in this study. First, the CRE surveillance data were recorded by 
local hospital IPs after interpretation of microbiology data. There is inherent subjectivity in 
surveillance practices despite the use of standard protocols and database. Given the overall 
low number of CRE present in community hospitals, this variability could be significant and 
skew the data in unclear ways. We recently performed a retrospective analysis, however, 
that confirmed that the definition used for “multidrug-resistant” gram-negative phenotypes 
by IPs detected 100% of CRE that occurred at a single tertiary care medical center.16 This 
issue is the reality of infection surveillance in community hospitals and further highlights the 
nationwide challenge in detecting and controlling this emerging threat. Second, this study 
used qualitative data from microbiology laboratory directors regarding laboratory practices, 
which may be subject to recall bias. We used multiple surveys to gain a more complete data 
set. Third, we did not collect data on the presence of carbapenemases, and so we are unable 
to comment on the molecular epidemiology of genes important in carbapenem resistance. 
Despite these limitations, we believe that this study provides a practical description of the 
limited data available on incidence of CRE in a multicenter sample of community hospitals 
and highlights deficiencies in preparedness for this public health threat.
We believe community hospitals in our network have much more work to do to prepare for 
and respond to CRE. Specifically, 2 focus areas must be developed to prevent CRE 
transmission: infection control and improved laboratory detection. Hospitals must be 
vigilant to limit person-to-person transmission. The CDC has outlined basic strategies to 
decrease transmission, including hand hygiene, contact precautions, healthcare personnel 
education, limitation of medical device use, patient and staff cohorting, laboratory 
notification strategies, antimicrobial stewardship, and CRE active screening.6 Of note, 
hospitals in our network have had significant difficulty implementing these 
recommendations because of resource limitations. No community hospitals in our cohort 
have yet adopted active surveillance programs for CRE. Finally, microbiology laboratories 
in these hospitals must make every effort to switch to the new carbapenem breakpoints. For 
example, all of the hospitals that did not detect a single CRE also did not adopt the new 
breakpoints. Thus, we remain skeptical that CRE are indeed absent from these hospitals. The 
inability to detect and control CRE makes in-hospital transmission more likely and could 
further drive the increasing trend and lead to hospital outbreaks.
In conclusion, our data indicate that the rates of CRE, while still infrequent, are increasing 
dramatically in community hospitals, where the majority of Americans receive their 
healthcare. We believe this increase is attributable to growing reservoirs and transmission of 
CRE and improvement in detection. Overall, we believe the estimates from study hospitals 
are underestimates of the true incidence in these hospitals. This point underscores the fact 
that these organisms are increasingly important and relevant in all areas of healthcare, 
including small community hospitals. Greater adherence to the 2010 CLSI guidelines is 
necessary to better understand the true prevalence of CRE and to better define what public 
health measures must be undertaken to prevent further spread of this serious, emerging 
threat.
