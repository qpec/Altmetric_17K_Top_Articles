A general relationship links gait mechanics and running ground
reaction forces

ABSTRACT
The relationship between gait mechanics and running ground
reaction forces is widely regarded as complex. This viewpoint has
evolved primarily via efforts to explain the rising edge of vertical force–
time waveforms observed during slow human running. Existing
theoretical models do provide good rising-edge fits, but require more
than a dozen input variables to sum the force contributions of four or
more vague components of the body’s total mass (mb). Here, we
hypothesized that the force contributions of two discrete body mass
components are sufficient to account for vertical ground reaction force–
time waveform patterns in full (stance foot and shank, m1=0.08mb;
remaining mass, m2=0.92mb). We tested this hypothesis directly by
acquiring simultaneous limb motion and ground reaction force data
across a broad range of running speeds (3.0–11.1 m s−1) from 42
subjects who differed in body mass (range: 43–105 kg) and foot-strike
mechanics. Predicted waveforms were generated from our two-mass
model using body mass and three stride-specific measures: contact
time, aerial time and lower limb vertical acceleration during impact.
Measured waveforms (N=500) differed in shape and varied by more
than twofold in amplitude and duration. Nonetheless, the overall
agreement between
the 500
measured waveforms
and those
generated independently by the model approached unity (R2=0.95
±0.04, mean±s.d.), with minimal variation across the slow, medium and
fast running speeds tested (ΔR2≤0.04), and between rear-foot
(R2=0.94±0.04, N=177) versus fore-foot (R2=0.95±0.04, N=323)
strike mechanics. We conclude that the motion of two anatomically
discrete components of the body’s mass is sufficient to explain the
vertical ground reaction force–time waveform patterns observed during
human running.

INTRODUCTION
Running ground reaction forces are of fundamental physical and
biological importance. Acutely, they determine the body’s state of
motion, limb-loading rates and tissue stresses. Over time, they
influence the health and functional status of the tissues, limb and
runner. However, the mechanical basis of the vertical force–time
waveform patterns described most extensively for human runners
(Cavanagh, 1987; Munro et al., 1987) continues to be a matter of
significant disagreement (Chi and Schmitt, 2005; Clark et al., 2014;
Denoth, 1986; Derrick, 2004; Lieberman et al., 2010; Nigg, 2010;
Shorten and Mientjes, 2011). The current discordance is at least
partially attributable to the mechanical complexities of the limbs and
bodies responsible for the forces present at the limb–ground interface.
Human and other vertebrate runners are mechanically complex in
their body and limb-segment morphology, tissue properties, neural
control of muscle forces, and joint and limb stiffnesses. These
features allow body mass components to accelerate differently with
respect to one another and the ground. Because the total waveform
corresponds to the acceleration of the body’s entire mass, the summed
accelerations of different mass components must somehow determine
the instantaneous forces and waveform patterns observed.
At present, the most common approach to explaining the force–
time waveform patterns of human runners are lumped element,
spring–mass systems that include four or more hypothetical mass
components with multiple springs and dashpots (Fig. 1A). Most
current versions include 14 or more input variables derived via
forward dynamics simulations (Chi and Schmitt, 2005; Liu and
Nigg, 2000; Ly et al., 2010; Nigg and Liu, 1999; Nikooyan and
Zadpoor, 2011; Zadpoor and Nikooyan, 2010). Per their intended
purpose, these models are able to provide close, post facto fits to the
rising edge of the force–time waveforms that result from rear-foot
strike mechanics at jogging speeds under a variety of surface,
footwear and other conditions (Ly et al., 2010; Zadpoor and
Nikooyan, 2010). However, these models do not attempt to predict
the falling edge of the waveform, they do not explain the differently
shaped waveforms that typically result from fore-foot strike
mechanics, and their ability to fit waveforms from intermediate
and fast running speeds is completely unknown.
A
scientific
justification
for
including
numerous
mass
components to account for vertical ground reaction force–time
waveforms was importantly provided by a direct motion-to-force
experiment conducted by Bobbert et al. (1991) a quarter century
ago. These investigators demonstrated that the total waveform can
indeed be reasonably predicted from the summed accelerations of
seven body mass components at modest running speeds. Recently,
we have theorized that an alternative approach may allow the
number of masses needed for full waveform prediction to be
reduced from seven to only two.
Our approach (Clark et al., 2014) divides the body’s mass into
two, anatomically based, invariant, mass components: the first
corresponding to the mass of the lower limb (m1, 8% total body
mass) and the second corresponding to the remainder of the body’s
mass (m2, 92% total body mass; Fig. 1B). The model theoretically
allows the full vertical force–time waveform to be predicted from
the force contributions corresponding to the two body mass
components. Impulse 1 results from the vertical collision of m1
with the running surface and impulse 2 results from the vertical
accelerations of m2 throughout the ground contact period (Clark
et al., 2014). Our introductory effort (Clark et al., 2014) was able to

 account for essentially all of the variation present in four vertical
force–time waveforms (R2 range: 0.95–0.98, mean=0.97±0.01)
selected for their amplitude, duration and shape heterogeneity.
However, the close fits achieved resulted from post facto selection
of the input parameters to maximize the goodness of each fit.
Here, we undertook a direct, experimental test of the hypothesis
that the motion of two discrete body mass components is sufficient
to predict running vertical ground reaction force–time waveforms in
full. The two-mass model requires only body mass and three stride-
specific measures as inputs: contact time, aerial time and lower limb
acceleration. Because these three inputs can be readily acquired
from a variety of video or other inexpensive motion-sensing
technologies, our model potentially offers economical options for
generating running ground reaction force waveforms without a force
platform. Additionally, the concise running force–motion linkage
provided could be applied to footwear, prosthetic and orthotic
design, or used to inform gait interventions designed to reduce
injuries or enhance running performance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Model formulation
Although the physical motion of running occurs in three spatial
dimensions, the total vertical ground reaction force waveform is
determined by the forces due to the instantaneous vertical
accelerations of the body mass components. Our computational
model utilizes experimental measurements to determine the
parameters linking running motion to impulse forces, thus
avoiding the limitations of modeling ground reaction forces with
single-axis or single-body mass–spring-damper systems (Nikooyan
and Zadpoor, 2011). The fundamental premise of the two-mass
model (see Appendix for detailed derivation) is that the total vertical
ground reaction force waveform is composed of two overlapping
bell-shaped impulses due to the vertical collision of the lower limb
(J1) with
the running surface
and the
concurrent vertical
accelerations of the rest of the body (J2) during ground contact.
The total ground reaction impulse JT is the sum of J1 and J2 and can
be determined by the total stance-averaged vertical ground reaction
force FT,avg during the ground contact time tc:
JT ¼ J1 þ J2 ¼ FT;avgtc:
ð1Þ
The model assumes steady-speed level running where the speed is
constant and the net vertical displacement of the center of mass of
the body is zero over each step. Thus, the time-averaged vertical
ground reaction force must equal the body’s weight and FT,avg can
be determined if contact time tc and aerial time ta are known:
FT;avg ¼ mbg tc þ ta
tc
;
ð2Þ
where mb is body mass and g is gravitational acceleration
(g=9.8 m s−2), and the quantity tc+ta equals the step time, tstep.
Impulse J1 corresponds to the vertical deceleration of m1 during
surface impact:
J1 ¼ F1;avgð2Dt1Þ ¼
m1
Dv1

þ m1g
�
�
ð2Dt1Þ;
ð3Þ
where m1 is 8.0% of the body’s mass (Plagenhoef et al., 1983;
Winter, 1990), Δt1 is the time interval between touchdown and the
vertical velocity of m1 slowing to zero, Δv1 is the change in vertical
velocity of m1 during Δt1, and F1,avg is the average force during the
total time interval (2Δt1) of impulse J1, here defined as the impact
interval. A single ankle marker is used to measure Δv1 and Δt1,
which determine the vertical acceleration of the lower limb mass m1
(Fig. 2). The lower limb attains a relatively constant positive
velocity after the impact interval (Fig. 2C), resulting in a near-zero
acceleration of m1 (Fig. 2D) and negligible force (Fig. 2E). Thus, J1
can be represented by a finite impulse during the impact interval.
Kinematic data for the ankle marker position during the impact
interval for representative rear-foot strike (RFS) and fore-foot strike
(FFS) subjects appear in Fig. 3. For highest accuracy of the Δt1
measurement, a velocity threshold and projection method is used to
eliminate minor fluctuations in the ankle marker velocity profile
near zero (see Appendix). To assess the accuracy of this projection
method, the measured ankle marker velocity at the projected time to
zero was quantified for all footfalls.
Impulse J2 corresponds to the remainder of the body’s mass and is
determined from total ground reaction impulse JT in Eqn 1 and
impulse J1 in Eqn 3:
J2 ¼ F2;avgtc ¼ JT � J1;
ð4Þ
where F2,avg is the average force of impulse J2 during the contact
time tc.
The raised cosine bell (RCB) curve function was used to generate
the F(t) waveforms of J1 and J2 for both foundational and empirical
reasons. The RCB function is unique among all bell curve functions
in that it can be derived from the first two terms of the Fourier series
(see Appendix). Analyses of vertical ground reaction force–time
waveforms from jumping in place indicate that using a function
consisting of two bell curves provides a superior representation and
requires a lower number of Fourier terms than a half-sine curve
(Racic and Pavic, 2009). Direct waveform comparisons indicate that
the RCB function provides superior descriptions versus both the
half-cosine and Gaussian functions (see cos2 data in table 2 of Sim
et al., 2008) when vertical ground reaction force impulses are
generated at frequencies ≥2 Hz.

than m2 as a result of the extension of the leg prior to impact.

Model force–time waveforms
Model-predicted versus measured vertical force waveforms were
tested for both individual footfalls and trial-averaged force data. For
the individual footfall predictions, the input parameters of body
mass, ground contact time, subsequent aerial time, m1 vertical
velocity at touchdown and impact interval time Δt1 were used to
generate the model-predicted waveform, which was then compared
with the measured waveform from that footfall. For the trial-
averaged waveform comparisons, the input parameters from each
right footfall were averaged for that trial. A minimum of three and a
maximum of six right footfalls were included in the trial average,
depending on the number of steps completed during the trial. The
measured input parameters from each trial average were used to
generate a model-predicted waveform, which was then compared

model is that the force resulting from the acceleration of m1 can
be accurately modeled by a finite impulse during the impact

 with the measured trial-averaged waveform. An example of this data
treatment appears in Fig. 4, including a series of original measured
waveforms (Fig. 4A), the trial-average model-predicted waveform
(Fig. 4B), and the model-predicted versus trial-average measured
waveform (Fig. 4C). Both single-footfall and trial-averaged
predictions were assessed to evaluate whether the number of
footfalls included influences the predictive accuracy of the model.
To validate the anatomical mass fractions in our model,
waveforms were alternatively generated with literature-suggested
impact-mass minimum and maximum values (Derrick, 2004). A
smaller m1 quantity of 1.5% was used (representing the approximate
mass of the foot; Plagenhoef et al., 1983; Winter, 1990; Hamill and
Knutzen, 2009) with a corresponding m2 quantity of 98.5%. A
larger m1 quantity of 16% was used (representing the approximate
mass of the entire stance limb; Plagenhoef et al., 1983; Winter,
1990; Hamill and Knutzen, 2009) with a corresponding m2 quantity
of 84.0%. We predicted that across both speed and foot-strike
mechanics, values along the rising edge of the waveform would be
under-predicted with an m1 quantity of 1.5% and over-predicted
with an m1 quantity of 16%.
Statistical analysis
The predictive accuracy of the model was assessed on the 500
individual footfalls acquired using both the R2 statistic and the root
mean square error (RMSE) statistic, global values that quantify
goodness of fit in relative and absolute terms, respectively. These
statistical assessments are broadly used for a variety of purposes,
including quantifying the degree of overlap present in time-series
data per prior practice (Cohen, 2013; Clark et al., 2014; Clark and
Weyand, 2014; Morin et al., 2005). The footfall sample size was
sufficiently large to detect very small differences in model
performance across foot-strike type and speed using the R2 and
RMSE statistics.
A two-way ANOVA was used to evaluate whether goodness-of-
fit and RMSE values varied as a function of speed (slow, medium,
fast) and foot-strike (rear- versus fore-foot categories) classifications
(P≤0.05, Table 1) on all 500 footfall waveforms acquired.
Subjects and participation
A total of 42 subjects, 23 men and 19 women, volunteered and
provided written informed consent. The consent process and all
experimental procedures were approved by, and conformed to, the
approval terms granted by the Institutional Review Board of Southern
Methodist University. All subjects were between 18 and 37 years of
age and engaged in regular physical activity at the time of testing. The
mean age and size characteristics of the men and women were as
follows: men: age=23.3±5.0 years, range=18–37 years; height=1.79±
0.07 m,
range=1.69–1.95 m;
mass=81.1±8.5 kg,
range=71.0–
101.5 kg; and women: age=22.5±1.7 years, range=18–36 years;
height=1.68±0.06 m,
range=1.55–1.78 m;
mass=63.3±9.4 kg,
range=43.4–82.0 kg.
Subjects
included
recreationally
trained
individuals, intercollegiate team-sport athletes, and professional
track and field athletes, four of whom were Olympic medalists in
sprint or hurdle events.
Data acquisition
Data were collected across a range of speeds (3.0 m s−1 to top
speed) on a three-axis, custom-built high-speed force treadmill
(AMTI, Watertown, MA, USA) capable of speeds of over
20 m s−1. To ensure that the model was being evaluated at
speeds that required a normal running gait, only trials above a
Froude speed of 1.0 [v/√(gL0)>1.0] were included in the
statistical analysis. For both submaximal and maximal tests,
subjects followed testing procedures similar to those described in
Weyand et al. (2000, 2010). Thirty-nine of the 42 subjects
completed trials up to top speed, and these subjects were
habituated to high-speed treadmill running during one or more
familiarization sessions before undergoing top speed testing. All
subjects wore standardized black compression shirts and shorts,
and the same model of running shoes (Nike Waffle Racer version
7.0, Beaverton, OR, USA).
Kinetic and kinematic data collection and analysis
Ground reaction force data were acquired at 1000 Hz and were
post-filtered using a low-pass, fourth-order, zero-phase-shift
Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 25 Hz (Winter,
1990). For each footfall, the vertical ground reaction force applied
during the contact period was determined from the time during
which the vertical force signal exceeded a threshold of 40 N.
Additionally,
trial-averaged
vertical
ground
reaction
force
waveforms were generated for individual subjects at different
trial speeds by averaging the force from each millisecond of the
contact period for the right-foot waveforms that had corresponding
kinematic data.
For each trial, 3.46 s of video data were collected using a high-
speed video system consisting of three Fastec Imaging HiSpec 2G
cameras
(Mikrotron
GmbH,
Unterschleissheim,
Germany)
operating at 1000 frames s−1. Subjects wore reflective markers on
the heel and ball of the foot on the lateral aspect of the right running
shoe, as well as on the lateral aspect of the joint axes of rotation of
the right ankle, knee and hip to capture these respective positions
during the trials. A single-frame video file of each subject was

 recorded prior to testing to serve as a reference for the kinematic
analyses. To assess the predictive accuracy of the model across
different foot-strike types, footfalls were classified as RFS if the first
surface contact occurred on the posterior half of the foot, and FFS if
the first surface contact occurred on the anterior half.
The procedures used in extracting three-dimensional marker
coordinates from the high-quality multiple camera videos consisted
of correcting image distortions, calibrating the three-dimensional
space and digitizing the markers. The calibration and digitization
routines extensively used functions from the MATLAB Image
Processing Toolbox (MathWorks,
Natick,
MA,
USA).
The
calibration and digitization MATLAB routines were developed by
the Hedrick Lab at the University of North Carolina (Hedrick,
2008). A resolution of 0.7 mm was measured under dynamic
conditions using the high-speed video system with the custom
MATLAB image correction, calibration and digitization routines.
Data acquisition timing for the AMTI DigiAmp amplifier and
Fastec Imaging cameras was synchronized through hardware
interfaces. The digitized marker data were filtered at 25 Hz using
the same filter as for the force data.
RESULTS
Overall agreement between model-predicted and measured
waveforms
The goodness-of-fit agreement (R2) between the 500 ground
reaction force waveforms we measured and those predicted by our
two-mass model approached unity as hypothesized (Table 1). The
corresponding
error of
prediction
expressed
in force
units
standardized to the body’s weight was slightly greater than 0.2Wb
and was equal to 11.5% of the mean stance-averaged vertical force
from all 500 trials (1.82±0.23Wb). The R2 and RMSE statistics for
the 108 trial-averaged waveform values were nearly identical to
those for the 500 individual waveforms. Specifically, the goodness
of fit between model-predicted and measured trial-averaged
ensemble
waveforms
was
only
0.01
greater
(R2=0.96±
0.03) than the individual footfall value, while the RMSE of
prediction
was
only
0.02Wb
less
(0.19±0.07Wb)
than
the
corresponding individual footfall values.
Predictive accuracy across foot-strike types and running
speeds
The goodness-of-fit between the model-predicted and measured
waveforms (R2) was nearly identical (ΔR2=0.01) for the 177 RFS
versus 323 FFS waveforms (Table 1). Because of the large number
of footfalls tested and minimal variability in model predictive
accuracy, the 0.01 greater R2 value for the FFS versus RFS
waveforms was significantly different statistically. Corresponding
RMSE differences for the RFS versus FFS waveform predictions
were small (ΔRMSE=+0.04Wb) and not statistically different.
The goodness-of-fit between the model-generated and actual
waveforms was slightly, but significantly, better for waveforms
acquired from slow and medium speeds versus those from fast
speeds. The R2 values, when averaged for the waveforms from the
three speed ranges (R2 total, Table 1) regardless of foot-strike type,
were slightly, but significantly lower (ΔR2=−0.03) for the faster
versus medium and slower speed trials. Similarly, the RMSE of the
model fits to the slow and medium speed waveforms were not
different from one another; however, both were significantly smaller
than the error of prediction for the waveforms from the fastest
speeds. Similar across-speed patterns were present for both the R2
and RMSE statistics when the waveforms were analyzed within
either the RFS or FFS mechanics categories (Table 1).
The waveforms generated with the two-mass model accurately
predicted the more rapid rising edges of the RFS versus FFS
waveforms, including transient rising-edge peaks when present,
regardless of the running speed, and total waveform amplitude and
duration (Figs 5A,C,E and 6A,C,E). Waveform shape variability
across foot-strike types was accurately predicted from the shorter
deceleration periods of the m1 mass segment for RFS versus FFS
(Δt1, Table 2) with little difference in the overall J1 impulse values
(Fig. 5B,D,F versus Fig. 6B,D,F; Δv1, Table 2) at similar speeds.
From slower to faster speeds, J1 impulses predicted by the model
became greater for both RFS and FFS waveforms as a result of the
greater pre-impact ankle velocities (Table 2). The close fits to the
middle and later portions of all the waveforms resulted largely or
exclusively from the J2 impulse predicted from the model because
the m1 impact deceleration event concluded during the first quarter
to half of the total contact period.
The measured ankle marker velocity at the time our projection
technique identified a zero value was, on average, −0.05±
0.04 m s−1 for the 500 individual trials. All but two of the
footfalls had a measured velocity within ±0.20 m s−1 of a literal zero
value (i.e. 0.00 m s−1).
Model predictive accuracy with alternative m1 segment
values
Poorer
agreement
between
model-predicted
and
measured
waveforms resulted from using m1 segment values that were either
smaller or larger than the originally assigned anatomical model
value of 8.0% of mb. As hypothesized, waveforms generated using
lesser m1 values (m1=1.5% with m2=98.5% of mb) consistently
under-predicted the force values measured along the rising edge of
the waveforms (Figs 7A,D,G and 8A,D,G). Conversely, waveforms
generated using greater m1 values (m1=16.0% with m2=84.0% of
mb) consistently over-predicted measured rising-edge force values
(Figs 7C,F,I and 8C,F,I). Differences were more pronounced at the
faster trial speeds because of the greater m1 segment decelerations
and correspondingly larger J1 impulses at faster speeds.

 The R2 goodness of fit values for the 500 individual footfall
waveforms generated using m1 values equal to 1.5% and 16.0% of
mb accounted for 12% and 21% less variance, respectively, versus
the original m1=8.0% results (m1−1.5% R2=0.83±0.16 and
m1−16.0%
R2=0.74±0.21).
Predictive
error
values
for
the
waveforms generated using the two alternative m1 segment values
were approximately twice as large as those obtained using the
original 8.0% value (m1−1.5% RMSE=0.36±0.17Wb; m1−16.0%
RMSE=0.47±0.24Wb).
DISCUSSION
As hypothesized, we found that the force contributions of two
discrete body mass components do indeed suffice to predict running
vertical ground reaction force–time waveforms in full. Our two-
mass, two-impulse model independently predicted nearly all of the
variation in measured running ground reaction force waveforms,
which differed considerably in their shape, amplitude and duration.
Although our prior, best-fit analysis indicated that this outcome
might be theoretically possible (Clark et al., 2014), an experimental
test incorporating simultaneous motion and force data had not been
previously undertaken. Our direct test here indicated that regardless
of whether our 42 human subjects jogged, ran at intermediate speeds
or sprinted, and whether they first contacted the running surface
with the fore or rear portions of their feet, there was near-complete
agreement between the model-predicted and measured force–time
waveforms across the 500 footfalls we analyzed (Table 1). Thus, we
conclude that the vertical ground reaction forces of human runners
can be broadly understood from the motion of two discrete portions
of the body: (1) the contacting lower limb and (2) the remainder of
the body’s mass.
Two-mass model: scientific and technical elements
A primary scientific challenge here was not knowing a priori how
well the waveform contributions from the 92% of the body’s mass
could be predicted when modeled as a single mass component.
Conceivably, the summed force contributions resulting from the
motion of the head, arms, trunk, upper portion of the contacting leg
and full mass of the non-contacting leg might defy accurate
prediction when treated as a single mass (Bobbert et al., 1991). This
large, multi-jointed mass component lacks a fixed, readily
measurable center because of the non-uniform motion of the
different segments that comprise it. Hence, the complexity of the
within-segment and total motion of our model’s mass component
m2 and its corresponding force contribution would be difficult to
measure
and
predict
from
positional
data.
We
ultimately
implemented
an
indirect
approach
that
allowed
the
force
contributions of mass m2 to be quantified without position and
time data. We simply subtracted impulse J1 from the total ground
reaction impulse JT, after quantifying the latter from body mass,
gravity and the contact proportion of the total step time (Eqns 1–3).
The resulting fits supported the efficacy of the approach as the
agreement between model-predicted and measured waveforms was

 consistently excellent over the later portions of the stance period
where the total waveform is predominantly determined by impulse
J2 (Figs 5A,C,E and 6A,C,E, waveform trailing edges).
A potential limitation of our impulse subtraction approach was
the required assumption that the net vertical displacement of the
body’s center of mass over the course of one or many strides is zero.
However, our analysis indicated that little to no predictive error was
introduced by this assumption under our level, treadmill-running
test conditions. We found similar levels of predictive accuracy for
trial-averaged and individual-footfall waveforms even though non-
zero vertical displacements of the center of mass, when considered
on a per-step basis, could have been substantially greater over the
course of an individual step versus multiple consecutive steps.
However, for our across-speed comparisons, it seems likely that our
slightly less accurate waveform predictions for the fastest speeds,
where step-to-step mechanics are generally less consistent versus
medium and slower speeds (Weyand et al., 2010), are probably
attributable to marginally greater violations of this assumption for
the faster trials (Table 1).
An
additional
technical
challenge
involved
accurate
and
consistent quantification of the duration of mass component m1’s
impact-period deceleration to a zero velocity (i.e. Δt1 in Eqn 3; see
also Fig. 2) for all footfalls. Following RFS impacts, the ankle
marker position–time trajectories consistently provided a discrete
vertical position minimum corresponding to the zero velocity
needed to quantify half-impact duration Δt1 in our model (Fig. 3).
However, for some FFS footfalls, the rates of the positional change
versus time during the last fraction of the deceleration period were
less consistent and more prolonged than the FFS data in Fig. 3. This
led us to implement an ankle marker projection technique (see
Appendix) to avoid basing impulse J1 predictions on Δt1 values that,
in these cases, are not representative of the overall timing of the

 impact-deceleration event. Upon implementation across all 500
footfalls, we found that the measured ankle marker velocities at the
time that the projection technique identified a zero velocity value
were very near the true zero value desired (mean vankle=−0.05
±0.04 m s−1). Given the overall mean ankle marker vertical
velocity, Δv1, of −1.59±0.02 m s−1 at impact across all 500
footfalls (Δv1, Table 2), this method, on average, captured 97% of
m1 total post-impact deceleration to zero.
The ability to consistently predict rising-edge waveform peaks
that occurred from 15 to 50 ms after initial impact is a noteworthy
aspect of our model validation. As the timing of rising-edge peaks
on individual waveforms is determined by the overlap of the two
impulses in our model, successful prediction required precisely
capturing the timing of both the high- (J1) and low-frequency (J2)
components of the waveforms. The timing of impulse J1 was
determined from motion data, and was therefore fully independent
of our force data, filtering and processing routines. Conversely, the
timing of impulse J2 was directly dependent on our force data and
processing routines, and was therefore fully independent of our
kinematic data and processing routines. Had even a minor degree
of temporal inaccuracy been present in either our kinematic or
kinetic data, the predictive accuracy with which the two-mass
model identified rising-edge force peaks would not have been
possible.
Integrating two-mass model and multi-mass model results
Our experimental goal was to identify the most concise mechanical
explanation that running ground reaction force waveforms might
have. The multi-mass models, in contrast, were formulated to
evaluate the potential influence of numerous factors on the
waveform rising edge. Many of the features incorporated into the
multi-mass models provide reasonable theoretical representations of
the numerous, potentially influential musculoskeletal complexities
present (Liu and Nigg, 2000; Ly et al., 2010; Nigg and Liu, 1999;
Nikooyan and Zadpoor, 2011; Zadpoor and Nikooyan, 2010).
These include mass components that vary in stiffness, that are both
rigid and wobbling in nature, and that are connected with both serial
and parallel elements (Fig. 1A). While the quantitative descriptions
derived for these features undoubtedly include uncertainty, their
basic influence on the RFS jogging waveforms thus far analyzed are
plausible and largely consistent with other experimental and
modeling approaches (Gruber et al., 1998; LaFortune et al., 1996;
Pain and Challis, 2001; Shorten and Mientjes, 2011). Accordingly,
our demonstration that a substantially more concise model can
account for running ground reaction force waveforms in full should
not be regarded as incompatible with the more theoretical results the
multi-mass models have provided. Indeed, the most reasonable
conclusion from the different approaches is that the collective
influence of the many biological complexities incorporated into the
multi-mass models is, in sum, accurately described by the concise
impulse–momentum relationships the two-mass model provides.
The force–motion relationship for human running: general or
foot-strike specific?
In contrast to the prevailing view that the impact forces resulting
from RFSs and FFSs involve different mass quantities (Lieberman
et al., 2010; Nigg, 2010), our results indicate that mass quantities
and force–motion relationships do not differ across strike types. This
becomes fully apparent when J1 impact impulses are quantified
using measured, foot-strike-specific deceleration durations in
conjunction
with
the
invariant,
anatomically
based
mass
quantities in our model. With both factors in place, we were able
to accurately predict the waveforms in full for both foot-strike types
at slow, intermediate and fast running speeds alike.

 As is evident from both our impulse J1 illustrations (Figs 5 and 6)
and the Δv1 values in Table 2, rising-edge force peaks that are
generally visible for RFS but not FFS waveforms can be fully
attributed to the different m1 deceleration durations we measured.
Longer FFS deceleration durations reduce and delay the J1 peak
force values; they also result in greater waveform force contributions
from impulse J2 at the time of the J1 force peak. In combination,
these timing-dependent factors typically do not allow the J1 impulse
peak to introduce a localized force peak along the rising edge of the
full waveform (Fig. 6B and Fig. 8B,E). We found this to be the case
even though the total ground reaction impulses resulting from FFSs
in our data set were just as large as those resulting from RFSs (note:
J1 impulses are ∝Δv1 in Table 2). One noteworthy exception to these
general foot-strike-specific waveform patterns has recently been
documented for specialized sprinters (Clark and Weyand, 2014).
These
fore-foot
striking
athletes
have
waveforms
that
are
characterized by prominent rising-edge force peaks that result
from brief, large J1 impulse peaks. The high pre-impact limb
velocities (Δv1) and brief impact deceleration periods (Δt1) of
specialized sprinters introduce conspicuous rising-edge force peaks,
particularly at faster running speeds (Fig. 6E,F and Fig. 8H).
Our waveform predictions using alternative mass fractions for
segments m1 and m2 also support the validity of describing FFS and
RFS waveforms with the same fractional body mass quantities and
force–motion relationships. As hypothesized for these alternative
mass distributions, substantially reducing the lower limb mass value
of m1 from the anatomical fractional value of 0.08 (Plagenhoef et al.,
1983) to the much lower value of 0.015 resulted in predicted rising-
edge force values that fell consistently below measured values
(Figs 7A,D,G and 8A,D,G). Conversely, substantially increasing
the m1 fractional mass value to 0.16 resulted in predicted rising-edge
force values that fell consistently above the measured values
(Figs 7C,F,I and 8C,F,I). The magnitudes of the respective
predictive errors and trends observed across speed were similar
for the two foot-strike types using the aforementioned alternative m1
fractional mass values. In both cases, the increases in the magnitude
of the J1 impulse across speed introduced greater predictive errors at
higher versus lower speeds. More globally, the contrast between the
systematic predictive errors present in both sets of alternative-mass
generated waveforms versus the near-full agreement achieved with
the original values provides strong support for the validity of the
anatomical values originally assigned to mass components m1 and
m2 in our two-mass model.
General considerations, applications and concluding
remarks
The accuracy and conciseness of our mechanical explanation for the
variable ground reaction force–time patterns of dozens of human
runners performing across their full range of speeds raises a
noteworthy possibility. Our two-mass, two-impulse approach may
offer a mechanical explanation that generalizes to the ground
reaction force–time patterns of other running species. However, for
non-human runners, the lesser distal-limb mass segments typically
present (Hildebrand, 1960; Rubenson et al., 2011) could alter both
the form and applicability of the two-mass approach. Minimally,
species-specific mass distributions would need to be incorporated to
generate waveforms from the basic stride measures included in the
model. In this regard, comparative anatomical variation constitutes
both a challenge and an experimental opportunity to evaluate the
basic tenets of the model. More broadly, the testable hypotheses the
model offers should be tractable using a variety of direct and indirect
approaches.
Finally, our empirical validation of a concise model that can fully
predict running vertical ground reaction forces offers basic insights
with immediate potential for application. In contrast to simplified,
single-mass models (Blickhan, 1989; Blum et al., 2009; Farley and
Gonzalez, 1996; McMahon and Cheng, 1990; Silder et al., 2015),
which are incapable of capturing the high-frequency, impact-phase
components of the waveform (Bullimore and Burn, 2007; Clark and
Weyand, 2014; Shorten and Mientjes, 2011), and multi-mass
models that do not account for the whole waveform and are too
theoretical and complex for practical application, the two-mass
model requires only body mass and very limited motion data in
order to predict the waveform in full. These attributes enable indirect
assessment of impact forces, limb loading rates, and other
informative,
force-based
outcomes
using
video
or
other
inexpensive
motion-sensing
technologies.
Potential
model
applications include: informing the design of running robots,
exoskeletons and prostheses, the customization of running shoes
and orthotics from individual gait mechanics, the development of
wearable ground force sensors, and the improvement of evidenced-
based feedback for gait analyses, intervention and modification.
APPENDIX
Impulse determination
The model assumes steady-speed horizontal running where the net
vertical displacement of the center of mass of the body is zero over
each step and the speed is constant. Each step is defined by a contact
time tc with vertical ground reaction force F(t), and an aerial time ta
where the force is zero. Under these conditions, a runner supports an
average of one body weight during the step time (tstep=tc+ta). This
can be expressed using the formal mathematical definition of the
average value of the force function F(t) over the interval t=0 to tstep:

Force curve function
The bell-shaped force curve F(t) for each impulse (J1, J2) can be
accurately modeled using the RCB curve (Clark et al., 2014). The
raised cosine function can be derived from the first two terms of the
Fourier series:
FðtÞ ¼ a0 þ

n¼1
ansinð2pfnt þ unÞ;
ðA10Þ
where α0 is the mean of the signal, and fn, αn and θn are the
frequency, amplitude and phase angle of the nth harmonic (Clark
and Weyand, 2014; Winter, 1990). The first two terms are:
FðtÞ ¼ a0 þ a1sinð2pf1t þ u1Þ:
ðA11Þ
The peak of this function can be referenced to t=0 by defining phase
θ1=π/2:
FðtÞ ¼ a0 þ a1cosð2pf1tÞ:
ðA12Þ
Term α0 is the mean of the function, and term α1 is the amplitude of
the function. Each term is defined by the total peak amplitude A,
resulting in α0=α1=A/2. The peak is located at center time B.
Frequency f1 can be expressed in terms of width parameter C, which
is defined from the peak at t=B to the time where F(t) decays to zero,
resulting in f1=1/(2C). The constants A, B and C are inserted into
Eqn A12 to yield the raised cosine periodic function:

Impulse J1 ankle marker velocity considerations
Impulse J1 results from the acceleration of the lower limb during the
limb impact interval and is quantified by Eqn A8. Δv1 and Δt1 are
determined using ankle marker kinematics to represent the motion
of the lower limb mass m1. The lower limb attains a relatively
constant positive velocity after the impact interval (Fig. 2C),
resulting in a near-zero acceleration of m1 (Fig. 2D) and negligible
force F1=m1g (Fig. 2E) as described in Eqn A6. This force is less
than 55 N for a subject with body mass mb=70 kg and lower limb
mass m1=5.6 kg (m1=0.08×70 kg). Thus, J1 can be modeled by a
finite impulse during the impact interval.
Kinematic data for the ankle marker position during the impact
interval for representative RFS and FFS subjects appear in Fig. 3.
Δt1 is the time interval between touchdown and the vertical
velocity of m1 slowing to zero. For some FFS runners at slower
speeds, minor fluctuations in the ankle marker velocity–time
profile near the end of the m1 impact interval can create variability
in the Δt1 measurements as a result of slow m1 impact velocities
and skin marker motion artifact during the impact interval
(Bobbert et al., 1991). Accordingly, Δt1 was quantified using a
technique that represented the functional end of the m1 impact
time interval. An ankle marker velocity of −0.25 m s−1 was used
as a threshold point, and the previous 10 ms of data were utilized
for a linear projection of the ankle marker velocity to zero. For
consistency in analysis, this method was applied to all ankle
marker kinematics data, regardless of the speed or foot-strike
mechanics of the runner (see Results).
Impulse J2 asymmetry considerations
The temporal location of the peak of impulse J2 is dependent on the
relative location of the center of mass at touchdown and takeoff.
Idealized spring–mass running has symmetrical center of mass
displacement, and thus a symmetrical profile where the location of
peak B2 is 0.50tc. However, the stance leg is more extended at
takeoff than at touchdown (Blickhan, 1989), and this causes the
center of mass height to be lower at touchdown than at takeoff
(Cavagna, 2006), which results in an asymmetrical impulse J2
profile. The model waveform F2(t) for impulse J2 can be modified
to include width parameters to control the symmetry:

 the center of mass asymmetry originally reported by Cavagna et al.
(1977) (see their table 4). With the symmetry control, C2L=B2 and
C2T=tc−B2.
Impulse J2 threshold considerations
A baseline noise level is present in all force platforms. To establish
accurate and reproducible contact measurements, a threshold value
is specified such that any ground reaction force signal below this
value is zero. The threshold setting can be incorporated into the
impulse J2 model waveform F2(t). Eqn A18 can be solved for the
width parameters C2:
C2 ¼
jt � B2jp
cos�1ðð2F2=A2Þ � 1Þ :
ðA19Þ
This equation is specifically evaluated for each width parameter at
time t where the force F2 is equal to the threshold. A force threshold
of 40 N was used for the AMTI high-speed force treadmill system.
The leading width parameter C2=C2L is determined at the first
channel (t=1 ms) and the trailing width parameter C2=C2T is
determined at the last channel (t=tc). Leading and trailing width
parameters C2L and C2T are calculated using the same peak location
B2 and peak amplitude A2.
The peak amplitude is recalculated after the width parameters
are changed in order to preserve the impulse. The impulse after
the calculation of width parameters (J2A) should approximately
equal the impulse before the calculation of width parameters
(J2B):
J2A ¼ J2B;
ðA20Þ

2 A2BC2TB;
ðA21Þ
A2A ¼ A2B
C2LB þ C2TB
C2LA þ C2TA
:
ðA22Þ
As a result of this recalculation, the impulse is approximately
equal to the original impulse and the values at the first and last
channel are approximately equal to the threshold value.
