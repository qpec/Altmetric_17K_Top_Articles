ABSTRACT
A dynamic relationship between the gut microbiota and brain is pivotal in neonatal development.
Dysbiosis of the microbiome may result in altered neurodevelopment; however, it is unclear which
specific members of microbiota are most influential and what factors might mediate the
relationship between the gut and the brain. Twenty-four vaginally-derived male piglets were
subjected to magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 30 d of age. Ascending colon contents, feces, and
blood were collected and analyzed for volatile fatty acids, microbiota relative abundance by 16s
rRNA, and serum metabolites, respectively. A mediation analysis was performed to assess
the mediatory effect of serum biomarkers on the relationship between microbiota and
neurometabolites. Results indicated fecal Ruminococcus and Butyricimonas predicted brain
N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Analysis of serum biomarkers indicated Ruminococcus independently
predicted serum serotonin and cortisol. A 3-step mediation indicated: i) Ruminococcus negatively
predicted NAA, ii) Ruminococcus negatively predicted cortisol, and iii) a significant indirect effect
(i.e., the effect of fecal Ruminococcus through cortisol on NAA) was observed and the direct effect
became insignificant. Thus, serum cortisol fully mediated the relationship between fecal
Ruminococcus and brain NAA. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, this study used a statistical
mediation analysis and provides a novel perspective into the potential underlying mechanisms
through which the microbiota may shape brain development. This is the first study to link
Ruminococcus, cortisol, and NAA in vivo, and these findings are substantiated by previous literature
indicating these factors may be influential in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Introduction
The
term
microbiota-gut-brain
axis
is
used
to
describe the bi-directional communication between
the gut microbiota and the brain. Early in life the
microbial community of the gut is rapidly evolving
in parallel with brain development, providing a win-
dow during which highly dynamic changes in the
brain could be susceptible to microbial alterations.
Throughout this period, myelination, growth and
expansion of neurons, and changes in neuro-metabo-
lites are occurring, and the trajectory of these pro-
cesses may be influenced by microbial dysbiosis.1,2 In
fact, other findings from animal studies have sug-
gested an influence of the microbiota on brain
metabolites,3 behavior,4 and neurogenesis.5 Although
the underlying mechanisms for these interactions are
widely unknown, it has been suggested that bacterial
metabolites
could
mediate
the
communication
between the gut and the brain.6
Early-life changes in the structure and function of
the brain commonly result in neurodevelopmental
disorders, and there is increasing evidence linking the
microbiome to psychiatric and neurodevelopmental
disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
While the microbiome is suggested to play a role in
the etiopathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders,
it is unclear which gut bacteria might be most
influential in the observed comorbid brain differences.
Current literature is limited in the characterization of
specific microbiota, which might modulate particular
aspects of brain development. Accordingly, studies
using a multimodal, interdisciplinary approach are
necessary to understand the complex communication
between the gut, the brain, and mediating factors. Use

https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2017.1353849
 of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a novel,
non-invasive approach to answering fundamental
questions relating to the gut-brain-axis. To our knowl-
edge, only 2 studies have used this technique, these
studies showed that dietary probiotics alter brain func-
tion in adult women7 and brain neurometabolites in
mice.3 By elucidating the effects of specific members
of microbiota on measures of brain health using MRI,
researchers can better understand the underlying
mechanisms through which gut microbiota modulate
brain development.
When studying the underlying mechanisms of
host-microbe interactions in humans, researchers
must account for genetic and environmental variation,
including diet and supplement use (i.e., probiotics and
prebiotics). The use of gnotobiotic and germ-free
rodent models has significantly advanced mechanistic
microbiome-gut-brain axis research; however, rodent
models are limited by physiologic and metabolic dif-
ferences when compared with humans. Pigs and
humans exhibit strikingly similar physiology, immune
system function, dietary patterns, and disease progres-
sion, thereby elevating the pig as optimal translational
model for assessing the interactions between diet,
micriobiota and host physiology.8 Moreover, the piglet
is a well-established translational model for gastroin-
testinal9 and brain development,10 and its use allows
for tightly controlled dietary, genetic, and environ-
mental influences. The objective of this exploratory
study was to apply an interdisciplinary approach using
the piglet model to: 1) identify predictive relationships
between microbiota and magnetic resonance spectros-
copy-derived neurometabolites, 2) identify predictive
relationships between microbiota and intermediary
biomarkers, and 3) characterize how the identified
biomarkers mediate the relationship between micro-
biota and brain metabolites. To our knowledge, this is
the first time this multimodal approach has been
applied to elucidate possible mechanisms between the
microbiome-gut-brain axis.
Methods and materials
All animal care and experimental procedures were
in accordance with the National Research Council
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
and approved by the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee.
Animals and housing
Twenty-four vaginally-derived intact male Yorkshire pig-
lets from the University of Illinois Imported Swine
Research Laboratory were obtained 48 h after birth, to
allow for adequate colostrum consumption, and were
subsequently artificially reared over a 30 d trial period.
Piglets were provided one of 2 experimental diets, over
the course of the 30 d trial, a detailed description of die-
tary treatment was described previously,11,12 and diet was
not significant in any of the outcomes assessed herein. A
detailed description of animal husbandry was described
previously,11,12 and details of the non-invasive neuroim-
aging procedures performed at 30 d of age are described
below. At 31 d of age, piglets were anesthetized by intra-
muscular injection at 0.03 mL/kg bodyweight using a tel-
zol:ketamine:xylazine solution [50.0 mg tiletamine plus
50.0 mg zolazepam reconstituted with 2.50 mL ketatmine
(100 g/L) and 2.50 mL xylazine (100 g/L); Fort Dodge
Animal Health]. Upon verifying anesthetic induction,
piglets were euthanized via intracardiac administration
of sodium pentobarbital (86.0 mg/kg bodyweight; Fatal
Plus, Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI, USA).
Immediately following intracardiac injection, piglet heads
were removed and trunk blood was collected. Whole
blood was centrifuged and serum was collected and
stored at ¡80�C for future analysis. Ascending colon
(AC) (the proximal one third of the colon) contents and
feces were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
¡80�C for volatile fatty acids and microbiota analyses.
Magnetic resonance imaging
Piglets were subjected to MRI procedures at 30 d-of-age,
as described previously.11 All scans were acquired using
a Siemens MAGNETOM Trio 3T Imager using a
Siemens 32-channel head coil. Magnetic resonance spec-
troscopy (MRS) was used to non-invasively quantify
metabolites both in the hippocampi and intervening tis-
sue, as described previously.13,14 In short, an MRS spin-
echo chemical shift sequence was used to assess a voxel
which centered over the left and right dorsal hippocampi
with a size of 12 mm £ 25 mm £ 12 mm. Sequence
parameters used for MRS data acquisition are as follows:
TR D 3000 ms; TE D 30 ms; signal averages D 128
(water-suppressed scan) and 8 (non-water supressed
scan); vector size D 1024 point. Water-suppressed and
non-water-suppressed data were acquired in institutional
units, and all MRS data were analyzed using LC Model
(version 6.3), using methods described previously.13,14

 Only neurometabolites for which a single data point
was obtained for all piglets on the study were analyzed.

(GPCCPCh),

(mI),
n-acetylaspartate
(NAA),
n-acetylaspartate
C
n-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAACNAAG).
Volatile fatty acid quantification
Concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFA) in AC con-
tents were determined as described previously.15 The
VFA concentrations were quantified using a Hewlett-
Packard 5890A Series gas chromatograph and a glass
column (180 cm 3 4 mm i.d.) packed with 10% SP-
1200/1% H3PO4 on 80/100 mesh Chromosorb WAW
(Superlco). Volatile fatty acid production was calculated
as VFA concentrations of substrate-containing tubes
minus the VFA content of blank tubes divided by sub-
strate weight expressed on a dry matter basis.
Pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S RRNA genes
DNA extraction, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and
sequence analysis were performed as described previ-
ously.12 Briefly, DNA was isolated from AC contents
and feces using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qia-
gen, Valencia, CA) in combination with the FastPrep-
24 System (MP Biomedicals, Carlsbad, CA). DNA con-
centration was determined with a NanoDrop 1000
spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). The V3
to V5 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes were
amplified for bacterial pyrosequencing with primers
341F and 907R (Klindworth et al 2013). Pyrosequenc-
ing was performed at Research Testing Laboratory
(RTL; Lubbock, TX) using 454 Life Sciences Genome
Sequencer FLX with Titanium series reagents and pro-
tocol (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) (Dowd
et al 2008, Handl et al 2011). Sequences processing and
analysis were performed using a bioinformatic pipeline
developed at RTL as described previously.12 Candidate
bacteria used in subsequent regression analysis were
limited to only bacterial genera for which data was
present for each individual piglet, thus resulting in 18
candidate genera for analysis.
Metabolomics
Serum samples were prepared as described previously16
by a commercial laboratory (Metabolon, Inc., Research
Triangle Park, NC). Briefly, sample extracts were
divided into 5 fractions: 1) acidic positive ion condi-
tions, chromatographically optimized for more hydro-
philic compounds; 2) acidic positive ion conditions,
chromatographically optimized for more hydrophobic
compounds; 3) basic negative ion optimized conditions
using a separate dedicated C18 column; 4) negative
ionizations following elution from HILIC column; and
5) reserved for backup. Next, non-targeted mass spec-
trometry analyses were performed, where extracts were
subjected to UPLC-MS/MS using methods optimized
for each sample fraction; detailed methods described
previously.16 Using a proprietary data analysis pipeline
(Metabolon, Inc.), metabolites were characterized by
ion features and compared with a reference library of
chemical standards.17,18 Ion peaks were quantified using
area-under-the-curve counts. Raw area counts were
normalized to account for variation from instrument
inter-day tuning differences by the median value for
each run-day. As such the median value for each run
day was set to 1.0, thus allowing for metabolites of dif-
ferent raw peak curves to be similarly compared.
Statistical analysis
Stepwise regression for genera and diet predicting
brain neurometabolites
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statisti-
cal Packages version 24 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). First, a linear regression equation was created
using the stepwise regression procedure in which can-
didate independent variables (i.e., relative abundances
of AC bacterial genera and diet or fecal bacterial gen-
era and diet) predicted the concentration of individual
brain metabolites (i.e., derived from MRS); Table 1.
Multicollinearity between independent variables was
assessed using the variance inflation factor (VIF).
Within each model, none of the independent variables
exceeded VIF factors of 2, thus all candidate variables
remained available for use in the final models. Upon
construction of models, a Cook’s D test was applied to
each model to determine the influence of individual
observations on the dependent variable; 3 models that
met the criterion of a Cook’s D value less than 0.5 and
are reported herein. The Mallows’ Cp value was also
calculated and reported for each regression to assess
goodness of fit. In the stepwise selection method, entry
and stay a levels were set at 0.05 and 0.10, respectively,
for independent variables to be included and remain

 in the final model. Only linear relationships were
tested and unstandardized regression coefficients (b)
§ SE are presented. This initial regression approach
was used to characterize fecal microbiota which
may serve as predictive fecal biomarkers for brain
neurometabolites.
Stepwise regression for individual genus and diet
predicting serum serotonin, serum cortisol, and
ascending colon volatile fatty acids
From the initial stepwise regressions, the following
candidate fecal genera were identified as significant
predictors of one or more neurometabolites and were
used in subsequent regression analyses to identify pos-
sible mediating variables: Bacteroides, Clostridium
XIVb, Ruminococcus, and Butyricimonas. A linear
regression equation was created using the stepwise
regression procedure in which candidate independent
variables (i.e., individual ascending color or fecal bac-
terial genus and diet) predicted one of the dependent
variables (i.e., serum serotonin, serum cortisol, or
ascending colon volatile fatty acids). It is known that
volatile fatty acids and microbiota are related, thus all
volatile fatty acids (i.e., acetate, butyrate, proprionate,
valterate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were assessed as
possible mediators in this analysis. Previous research
indicates serum serotonin and serum cortisol relate to
microbiota, thus in an effort to limit the metabolites
analyzed in as possible mediators, only serotonin and
cortisol were analyzed herein.1,2 All selection criteria
described above were applied to the regression
described herein, and only models that met all speci-
fied criteria are presented.
Mediation analysis
A mediation analysis was performed using the Process
macro designed for SPSS.19 The mediation model was
used to characterize the relationship between relative
abundances of fecal Ruminococcus, serum cortisol,
and a MRS-derived brain metabolite (NAA) using a
3-step process. In the context of the following media-
tion, we tested whether the relationship between the
fecal Ruminococcus and the MRS-derived brain NAA
was mediated by serum cortisol. For a mediation to
occur, there must have been a significant indirect
effect,20 meaning the effect of the independent variable
(fecal Ruminococcus) through the mediator (serum
cortisol) on the dependent variable (spectroscopy-
derived NAA) must be significant.
The following 3-step framework was used to deter-
mine the mediation:
1. Path A: A regression model was used to describe
the relationship between the independent vari-
able (Ruminococcus) and the dependent variable
(NAA).
2. Path B: A regression model was used to
describe the relationship between the inde-
pendent
variable
(Ruminococcus)
and
the
mediator (cortisol).
3. In the third step, the Process macro was used
and a bootstrapping method applied to estimate
the mediation effects. The bootstrapping used
5000 samples with replacement from the data
set to estimate the distribution for the direct and
the indirect effects. The direct effect indicates
the relationship between the indepdendent vari-
able (Ruminococcus) and the dependent variable
(NAA) (Path A’). The indirect effect describes
the relationship from the independent variable
(Ruminococcus) through the mediator (cortisol)
to the dependent variable (NAA) (Path B £ C).
A significant mediation occurred when the indirect
effect

Results
Piglet characteristics
One piglet was determined to be an outlier (i.e., >3 SD
from the mean) in all analyses and was therefore
excluded from the data set, thus 23 subjects were used
to generate the results presented herein. Piglet growth
assessment was described previously.12
Ascending colon eubacterium predicts brain NAA
Diet and 18 ascending colon genera (candidate inde-
pendent variables) were entered into a stepwise regres-
sion procedure to generate individual linear models
for 5 neurometabolites (dependent variables) (Table 1).
Using a stepwise regression approach to identify can-
didate independent variables that predict brain NAA
concentrations, Eubacterium (b1 D ¡0.412 § 0.119;
R2
model D 0.364; Pmodel D 0.002) entered the model
first; diet and all other candidate genera did not meet
criteria to enter the model. Predictive models for brain
mI, GPCCPCh, NAACNAAG, and CrCPCr did not
meet criteria set forth above and were therefore
excluded.
Specific fecal bacterial genera predict brain
myo-Inositol (mI), N-acetylaspartate (NAA),
and creatineCphosphocreatine (CrCPCr)
Diet and 18 fecal genera (candidate independent vari-
ables) were entered into a stepwise regression proce-
dure to generate individual linear models for 5
neurometabolites (dependent variables) (Table 1).
Using a stepwise regression approach to identify
candidate independent variables that predict brain mI
concentration (Table 2), Bacteroides (b1 D 0.039 §
0.011; Pb1 D 0.001; Pmodel D 0.002) entered the model
first and Clostridium XIVb (b2 D 0.127 § 0.054;
Pb2 D 0.031; Pmodel D 0.001) entered the model sec-
ond; diet and all other candidate genera did not meet
criteria to enter the model. When identifying candi-
date variables that predict brain NAA (Table 2),
Ruminococcus (b1 D ¡0.160 § 0.045; Pb1 D 0.002;
Pmodel D 0.002) entered the model first and Butyrici-
monas (b2 D 0.155 § 0.060; Pb2 D 0.017; Pmodel D
0.001) entered the model second; diet and all other
candidate genera did not meet criteria to enter the
model. Lastly, a linear model for brain CrCPCr
(Table 2) indicated that Bacteroides (b1 D 0.010 §
0.004; Pb1 D 0.013; Pmodel D 0.013) entered the model,
and diet and all other candidate genera did not meet
criteria to enter the model. Predictive models for brain
GPCCPCh and NAACNAAG did not meet criteria
set forth above and were therefore excluded.
Identification of candidate mediating variables for
individual genus and MRS metabolite relationships
From the initial stepwise regressions, the following candi-
date genera were identified as predictors of one or more
brain metabolites: ascending colon Eubacterium, fecal
Bacteroides, fecal Clostridium XIVb, fecal Ruminococcus,
and fecal Butyricimonas. Candidate mediating variables
in this analysis included: serum serotonin, serum cortisol,
and ascending colon volatile fatty acids. Individual step-
wise regressions indicated fecal Bacteroides was predictive
of: serum serotonin (b1 D 0.016 § 0.007; Pmodel D 0.038;
Table 3), ascending colon valerate (b1 D ¡0.174 § 0.048;
Pmodel D 0.002; Table 4), and total branched-chain fatty
acids (b1 D ¡0.317 § 0.103; Pmodel D 0.006; Table 4);
diet did not meet criteria to enter any of the described
models. Similarly, stepwise linear models indicated fecal

 Ruminococcus was predictive of serotonin (b1 D ¡0.169
§ 0.057; Pmodel D 0.008; Table 3) and cortisol (b1 D
¡0.109 § 0.032; Pmodel D 0.002; Table 3); diet did not
meet criteria to enter any of the described models. Indi-
vidual regressions with ascending colon Eubacterium or
fecal Clostridium XIVb and Butryricimonas did not meet
selection criteria for inclusion into stepwise predictive
models of serum serotonin, serum cortisol, or volatile
fatty acids, and were therefore excluded. Previous
research indicates serum cortisol and serum serotonin
influence the expression of one another, however there
was no observed correlation (P D 0.148) between cortisol
and serotonin in this study.
Serum cortisol fully mediates the relationship
between fecal Ruminococcus and MRS-derived brain
NAA
A formal mediation analysis was performed to assess the
relationship between Ruminococcus and NAA through
cortisol. The following regression framework was used
to elucidate the characteristics of this relationship.
Higher Ruminococcus predicted decreased cortisol
(Table 3), therefore cortisol was considered as a candi-
date mediating variable for the previously identified
relationship
between
Ruminococcus
and
NAA
(Table 2). Using the 3-step framework for a formal
mediation analysis, higher Ruminococcus predicted
decreased NAA concentrations (b D ¡0.160 § 0.045;
R2
model D 0.367; Pmodel D 0.002, Fig. 1 path A). Next,
higher Ruminococcus predicted decreased cortisol
concentrations (b D ¡0.109 § 0.032; R2
model D 0.360;
Pmodel D 0.002, Fig. 1 path B). Lastly, the formal medi-
ation model, assessing the effects of serum cortisol
concentrations on the relationship between Rumino-
coccus and NAA, was significant (R2
model D 0.450,
Pmodel D 0.003). The indirect pathway of the media-
tion was significant ([95%CI: ¡0.150 ¡ ¡0.009; Fig. 1
path B £ C] [b D 0.573 § 0.330; Pb D 0.098; Fig. 1
path C]), and the direct pathway of the mediation was
not significant (95%CI: ¡0.238 – 0.012; b D ¡0.113
§ 0.060; Pb D 0.075; Fig. 1 path A’). Thus, cortisol
concentrations
fully
mediated
the
relationship
between
fecal
Ruminococcus
and
brain
NAA
concentrations.
Discussion
This study uses multimodal methodology to provide a
novel insight into the complex interactions between the
microbiome-gut-brain axis in early development. Due
to their strikingly similar physiology, immune system
function, dietary patterns, and disease progression, pigs
have been identified as an optimal translational model
for assessing the interactions between diet, micriobiota
and host physiology.8 The piglet is considered the best
model for human gastrointestinal9 and brain develop-
ment10 with proven clinical translatability. Recent stud-
ies have used gnotobiotic piglet models,21,22 thereby
establishing the piglet as a useful model for assessing
the influence of specific microbiota throughout devel-
opment. Using the biomedical piglet model, these find-
ings provide a previously unidentified link between
relative
abundances
of
specific
bacterial
genera,

 neurometabolites and serum metabolites. In doing so,
these results may identify a novel mechanism through
which the microbiome may influence neurodevelop-
ment. However, it should be noted that the proposed
mechanism described herein should be further substan-
tiated through empirical studies, thus this finding is
reported as an exploratory analysis and should be con-
sidered as hypothesis generating evidence for future
work. In the following paragraphs, we will discuss: i)
predictive models between fecal microbiota and brain
metabolites, ii) predictive models between fecal micro-
biota and serum/colonic biomarkers, and iii) a media-
tion model through which serum biomarkers mediate
the relationship between fecal microbiota and brain
metabolites.
Fecal microbiota predict neurometabolites
The first objective of this analysis was to identify novel
relationships between fecal microbiota and neurome-
tabolites. Our results indicated brain mI, a marker for
glial cells and pre-myelinating events in the develop-
ing brain,23 was positively predicted by both Bacter-
oides and Clostridium XIVb. Additionally, brain
CrCPCr, an indicator of energy metabolism,24 was
positively predicted by Bacteroides. Lastly, these analy-
ses indicated brain NAA, a marker of neuronal
health,24 was negatively predicted by Ruminococcus
but positively predicted by Butyricimonas. Concentra-
tions of these brain metabolites change over the course
of development23 and our research suggests gut colo-
nization of microbiota may play a pivotal role in this
phenomenon. Dysbiosis in the gut microbiota is
known to alter behavior in both humans and animal
models,,4,25,26 and changes in neurometabolites may
underlie these behavioral phenotypes. Interestingly,
altered brain CrCPCr,27-29 NAA,30 and mI27,31 have
been reported in subjects diagnosed with ASD, yet no
studies have identified specific links between gut
microbes and these metabolites. Mice supplemented
with a daily dose of Lactobacillus rhamnosus for
2 weeks showed an increase in brain NAA quantified
by MRS, thus providing evidence that brain metabolite
concentrations can be modulated by microbial shifts
in the gut.3 Although Lactobacillus was not identified
as a predictive bacteria for neurometabolites in this
study, we assessed the interaction of Lactobacillus and
brain NAA and the correlation was not significant,
data not shown.
Fecal microbiota predict serum/colonic biomarkers
The next step of the analysis framework was to identify
possible mediatory biomarkers that relate to the
Figure 1. Serum cortisol fully mediates the relationship between fecal Ruminococcus and MRS-derived brain N-acetylaspartate. First,
fecal Ruminococcus negatively predicted MRS-derived brain NAA concentrations (path A). Second, fecal Ruminococcus negatively pre-
dicted serum cortisol concentrations (path B). Third, mediation effects were assessed for serum cortisol concentrations. The indirect
effect (i.e., the effect of fecal Ruminococcus through serum cortisol on MRS-derived brain NAA; path B £ C) was significant, and the
direct effect (path A’) was not significant. Thus, serum cortisol fully mediates the relationship between fecal Ruminococcus and MRS-
derived brain NAA. Abbreviation: N-acetylaspartate (NAA).

 previously identified fecal bacterial genera. This analysis
showed that Bacteroides positively predicted serum
serotonin, whereas Ruminococcus negatively predicted
both serum serotonin and cortisol. These findings have
not previously been reported in the literature. However,
correlations between operational taxonomic units that
belong to Ruminococcus and daily cortisol levels in
depressed patients have been reported.32 Previous
research indicates both serotonin and cortisol release
can be influenced by bacterial strains.25 In a probiotic
study,
supplementation
of
Lactobacillus
helveticus
R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 decreased
urinary cortisol levels in healthy human volunteers, fur-
ther indicating bacterial strains can influence cortisol
levels.33 Although Lactobacillus was not identified as a
predictive bacteria for neurometabolites in this study,
we assessed the interaction of Lactobacillus and serum
cortisol and the correlation was not significant, data not
shown. Interestingly, alterations in serum serotonin and
cortisol, as well as fecal Bacteroides and Ruminococcus
levels, have been described in patients with ASD.6
Serum cortisol as a mediator between fecal
ruminococcus and brain NAA
Given the relationships reported in our predictive
models, we used a mediation model to characterize
the mediatory effects of serum biomarkers on the rela-
tionship between fecal microbiota and neurometabo-
lites.
Our
results
provided
clear
evidence
that
serum cortisol mediated the relationship between fecal
Ruminococcus and brain NAA. Interestingly, Rumino-
coccus, cortisol, and NAA have all independently been
implicated in ASD; however, this is the first time a
relationship between the 3 has been reported.
First, higher Ruminococcus predicted lower NAA.
Previous research indicates elevated fecal Ruminococ-
cus in subjects with ASD,34,35 and fecal Ruminococcus
positively correlated with autistic-like behaviors in a
mouse model of ASD.36 In addition, MRS indicates
NAA was decreased in the cerebellum,37 hippocampus
and amygdala,38 temporal lobe,39 gray matter and
white matter,28 and whole brains27 of ASD patients.
To our knowledge, no other study has reported a link
between Ruminococcus and NAA.
Second, higher Ruminococcus predicted lower corti-
sol concentrations. This finding is supported by previ-
ous research in which decreased serum cortisol was
observed in individuals with ASD.40 It should be noted
that the implications of cortisol in ASD vary widely,
with some research suggesting elevated cortisol in
ASD patients.41 Although these inconsistent results
could be attributed to differences in methodological
approach (i.e., salivary vs. serum cortisol) as well as
the heterogeneity of symptoms among individuals
with ASD, it is important to note that diverse micro-
bial populations may differentially influence serum
cortisol concentrations. As stated previously, supple-
mentation of specific bacterial strains resulted in
reduced cortisol in healthy human volunteers.33
These findings further suggest that specific bacterial
strains may differentially impact serum cortisol con-
centrations,
rather
than
attributing
the
cortisol
changes to a particular disease state.
Third, the indirect pathway of the mediation indi-
cated cortisol has a mediatory effect on the relationship

 between Ruminococcus and NAA. Previous research
shows salivary cortisol positively relates to hippocampal
NAA, although it should be noted this observation was
made in patients exhibiting posttraumatic stress disor-
der.42 Thus, it follows that lower levels of cortisol would
relate to lower levels of NAA, thereby supporting our
finding. Given the independent reports on Ruminococ-
cus, cortisol, and NAA in individuals with ASD (Fig. 2),
this mediation analysis could provide a possible mecha-
nism underlying the complex relationship between the
microbiota and neurodevelopment in the context of
ASD. Interestingly, provision of fructo-oligosaccharides
and galacto-oligosaccharides in mice resulted in a
reduction in cecal Ruminoccocus among other bacterial
genera, indicating a possible dietary approach to reduc-
ing Ruminococcus concentrations.43
Conclusion
This study used an interdisciplinary approach through
the use of fecal microbiota measures, serum bio-
markers, and MRS. To our knowledge, this approach
has not been undertaken in previously published stud-
ies. The relationships identified herein provide several
novel perspectives on the possible mechanisms of
microbiome-gut-brain-axis. First, due to the high
diversity of the gut microbiota, unravelling specific
relationships between bacterial genera and particular
brain metabolites is difficult; however, these predictive
models identify the most influential genera on individ-
ual brain metabolites. Second, identification of these
relationships permits a focused approach for selection
of mediatory biomarkers. Third, identification of pre-
dictive microbes on brain metabolites enables sensitive
targeting of the gut microbiota to alter neurometabo-
lites, thereby influencing neurodevelopment. This
study reported a predictive relationship between levels
of fecal Ruminococcus, serum cortisol, and brain
NAA, 3 observations that have independently been
reported in patients with ASD. While the initial aim
of this study was not to focus on ASD etiology, these
results provide preliminary data for future research
aiming to investigate the microbiota-brain communi-
cation in ASD and to develop targeted treatment
options for a subgroup of affected individuals.
Our study was limited to assessing fecal micro-
biota at the genera taxonomic level; thus, future
work assessing the impact of specific microbial spe-
cies may reveal a more detailed microbial signature
as it relates to specific aspects of neurodevelop-
ment. Provided the continued maturation of the
brain and the gastrointestinal tract into childhood,
longitudinal assessment in the pig model may pro-
vide key evidence of critical developmental win-
dows during which microbiota are most influential.
Lastly, this novel approach can be implemented in
the assessment of other neurodevelopmental disor-
ders that may be influenced by microbiota. While
these findings do not specifically identify mecha-
nisms of action between the observed relationships,
this exploratory study used a statistical approach
that
aids
in
identifying
potential
mechanisms,
which can set the framework for future interven-
tional studies.
From our results we: i) provide a novel perspec-
tive into the interaction between fecal microbiota
and
brain
metabolites,
ii)
provide
novel
links
between fecal microbiota and serum biomarkers
implicated in ASD, and iii) bring together 3 inde-
pendently reported observations in ASD patients to
provide a potential mechanism for the communica-
tion between one bacterial genera and a specific
brain metabolite. The relationships identified in
this study may serve as hypothesis-generating find-
ings from which future empirical studies can aim
to further investigate the underlying mechanisms
proposed in this paper. Additionally, these novel
findings may serve as preclinical evidence through
which future dietary intervention can be imple-
mented to alter microbial populations and influence
neurodevelopment.
