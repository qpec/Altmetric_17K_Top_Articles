The HIV-1 fusion peptide, comprising 15 to 20 hydrophobic residues at the N terminus of the
Env-gp41 subunit, is a critical component of the virus-cell entry machinery. Here, we report
the identification of a neutralizing antibody, N123-VRC34.01, which targets the fusion peptide
and blocks viral entry by inhibiting conformational changes in gp120 and gp41 subunits
of Env required for entry. Crystal structures of N123-VRC34.01 liganded to the fusion peptide,
and to the full Env trimer, revealed an epitope consisting of the N-terminal eight residues of
the gp41 fusion peptide and glycan N88 of gp120, and molecular dynamics showed that the
N-terminal portion of the fusion peptide can be solvent-exposed.These results reveal the
fusion peptide to be a neutralizing antibody epitope and thus a target for vaccine design.
T
ype 1 viral fusion machines, including
HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), mediate
virus entry through structural rearrangements
that drive virus-cell membrane fusion (1–3).
The hydrophobic N-terminal region of the
gp41 transmembrane subunit (the fusion pep-
tide), which is liberated by cleavage of the en-
velope precursor, is a critical element in this
process because it directly interacts with the
target-cell membrane in both intermediate and
postfusion states (1–3). In the prefusion state,
sequestration of the HIV-1 Env fusion peptide
has been thought essential to avoid its being
snared by the viral membrane or forming a hy-
drophobic aggregate with other fusion peptides.
Published structures of trimeric HIV-1 Env in its
prefusion closed state indicated a surface-exposed
fusion peptide located in the membrane-proximal
quartile of the viral spike (4–6); however, sub-
stantial disorder of the N-terminal portion of
the fusion peptide in both antibody-bound and
ligand-free crystal structures (6, 7) made expo-
sure of the fusion peptide unclear.
A chronically HIV-1–infectedindividual, donor
N123 (8, 9), displayed potent serum neutraliza-
tion (fig. S1A); however, the epitope specificity of
the serum-neutralizing antibodies could not be
clearly categorized (fig. S1, B and C). We performed
antigen-specific single memory B cell sorting with
the BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer (6, 10, 11); among 92
antigen-specific B cells were 7 members of the
clonal lineage N123-VRC34 (named for donor
“N123” andantibody lineage “VRC34,” with specific
clone “x” referred to as VRC34.“x”) (Fig. 1A and fig.
S2). The most potent member of the clonal family
(VRC34.01) neutralized 16 out of 22 HIV-1 Env-
pseudoviruses, including BG505 (fig. S3), and
further neutralized 49% of 208 HIV-1 strains (fig.
S4 and database S1). VRC34.01 and clonal mem-
bers bound to BG505 SOSIP.664, but not BG505
gp120 monomer in enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 1B and fig. S5A), and
VRC34.01-04, but not VRC34.05-07, bound to
cell-surface BG505 trimer (fig. S5, B and C). In
competition ELISA, VRC34.01 was partially inhib-
ited by antibody PGT151 (12) (fig. S6), and on a
panel of 28 glycan mutants of strain BG505,
VRC34.01 displayed a profile distinct from PGT151
(fig. S7). VRC34.01 neutralization was reduced by
elimination of the N88 glycan and was enhanced
by glycan mutations N611Q and N611D. There
was minimal effect on VRC34.01 neutralization
when viruses were grown in the presence of gly-
cosylation inhibitors kifunensine, swainsonine,
orinGnTI−/−cells(fig.S8),suggestingthatVRC34.01

 recognition does not require complex glycosyla-
tion. Similar to PGT151 (13), VRC34.01 stained
293T cells expressing wild-type JR-FL Env, but
not its uncleaved mutant (Fig. 1C). Overall, these
results indicated that VRC34.01 targets a unique
trimer-specific, cleavage-dependent epitope that
involved glycan N88.
To define further VRC34 recognition, we crystal-
lized a ternary complex formed by antigen-binding
fragment (Fab) VRC34.01, BG505 SOSIP.664, and
Fab PGT122, a glycan-V3–directed antibody (4, 6, 14).
Diffraction data extended to 4.3 Å resolution, and
we determined (15) and refined the ternary com-
plex structure (Fig. 1D and table S1). Each gp120-
gp41 protomer bound a single VRC34.01 Fab and
a single PGT122 Fab (Fig. 1, D and E). VRC34.01
recognized an epitope in the gp120-gp41 inter-
face consisting primarily of the fusion peptide on
gp41 (residues 512 to 519, 55% interactive surface
area) and glycan N88 on gp120 (26% interactive
surface area) (Fig. 1E and table S2) (16).
The fusion peptide and glycan N88 formed a
contiguous surface on HIV-1 Env, with the heavy
and light chains of VRC34.01 oriented perpen-
dicular to this surface, so that both heavy and
light chains were involved in binding both fusion
peptide and glycan N88 (Fig. 1E). The first eight
residues of fusion peptide (17) were embedded in
a hydrophobic groove formed by complementarity-
determining regions (CDRs) H1, H2, H3, L1, and
L3, consistent with VRC34.01 neutralization of
strain BG505 being knocked out by site-directed
mutations in this region (fig. S9) (18). Glycan N88
was recognized by a pocket formed by CDRs L1,
L2, and H3 of VRC34.01 (fig. S10) (19). Surface
plasma resonance (SPR) studies of the N88Q
variant of BG505 SOSIP.664 indicated removal
of glycan N88 to decrease VRC34.01 affinity from
0.3 nM to 19.9 nM (Fig. 1F). The ability of VRC34.01
to recognize the N88Q mutant with nM affinity
indicated its interaction with fusion peptide to
dominate the energetics of interaction; a more
substantial decrease in affinity (to 272 nM) was
observed with a single-chain version of BG505,
indicating the charged N terminus to be critical
in VRC34.01 recognition (Fig. 1G). Consistent with
the ternary complex crystal structure, negative-
stain electron microscopy (EM) of Fab VRC34.01
and BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer revealed a three-
antibody to one-trimer stoichiometry (fig. S11).
We next cocrystallized Fab VRC34.01 with the
N-terminal portion of the fusion peptide (residues
512 to 520). Diffraction data extended to 1.5 Å
resolution, and we determined and refined the
peptide-Fab structure (Fig. 2A and table S1). Well-
defined electron density extended from 512 to
518, with the side chain of F519 partially ordered
and residue L520 completely disordered (fig. S12).
A shallow groove spanning all of the CDRs except
L2 held the fusion peptide in extended confor-
mation, with residues A512, V513, I515, and V518
fitting snugly into four hydrophobic pockets span-
ning the VRC34.01 paratope (Fig. 2A) (20). We also
determined the ligand-free structure of VRC34.01
(table S1); no significant change in VRC34.01
paratope occurred upon fusion-peptide engage-
ment (fig. S13).
About 50% of HIV-1 isolates tested were resist-
ant to VRC34.01 (fig. S4 and database S1). This
resistance could arise from structural or sequence
variation. Because glycan N88 is conserved in
98.6% of HIV-1 sequences (21), we analyzed the
fusion-peptide sequence of 3943HIV-1 sequences
(22), which identified variation at several residues
(Fig. 2B). We individually introduced less prev-
alent residues into the fusion peptide of the
BG505-Env pseudovirus and assessed VRC34.01
neutralization. Several mutants displayed dimin-
ished neutralization, and a Thr insertion at posi-
tion 514b led to complete resistance to VRC34.01
(Fig. 2C). Notably, most mutations led to incom-
plete neutralization, which could be potentially
explained by the inability of VRC34.01 to remain
tightly bound to the fusion peptide throughout
the HIV-1 entry process (23, 24). We also ana-
lyzed the sequences and neutralization sensitivity
of 208 Env-pseudoviruses. Two sequences lacked
the glycosylation site at N88 and were resistant
to VRC34.01 (database S2). The remaining 206
sequences, divided into three groups based on
their fusion-peptide sequence (25), showed dis-
tinct VRC34.01 sensitivity (Fig. 2D and database
S2). These results indicate that a dominant com-
ponent of neutralization resistance to VRC34.01
stems from sequence variation of the fusion peptide,
a corollary being that a majority of HIV-1 strains
appear to be capable of assuming the solvent-
exposed conformation of the fusion peptide
observed in the VRC34.01-Env complex.
To delineate further the conformation of
HIV-1 Env recognized by VRC34.01, we evaluated
the interaction of VRC34.01 with cell-free virus
andthecontributionof thisinteractiontoneutraliza-
tion (Fig. 3A). These data indicated neutralization
to be mediated primarily by binding to cell-free

 virus before cell surface attachment. Next we per-
formed SPR assays to quantify VRC34.01 binding
to soluble BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers (10), as well as
a 201C-433C variant (DS-SOSIP.664), which had
been disulfide-stabilized to prefer the prefusion
closed Env conformation (7). VRC34.01 bound tight-
ly to 2G12-captured SOSIP.664 and DS-SOSIP.664
trimers,aswellastoCD4-Ig-capturedDS-SOSIP.664
trimers (Fig. 3B and fig. S14). In contrast, VRC34.01
binding to CD4-captured SOSIP.664, which under-
goes CD4-induced conformational opening, was
substantially reduced. VRC34.01 thus appears to
recognize a prefusion Env conformation before
CD4-induced rearrangement.
We tested the ability of VRC34.01-bound BG505
SOSIP.664 to engage CD4 by preincubating the
Env trimer with an excess of VRC34.01 and ana-
lyzed interactions with CD4-Ig or 2G12 by SPR.
Preincubation with VRC34.01 showed little effect
on CD4 engagement (Fig. 3C and fig. S15). Al-
though VRC34.01 neutralized Env-pseudotyped
JR-FL virions (Fig. 3A and fig. S16), incubation
with these virions showed little effect on attach-
ment to TZM-bl cells expressing surface CD4
(Fig. 3D). Single-molecule fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (smFRET) of JR-FL Env molecules
on native virions revealed VRC34.01 to increase
the population of a partially open conformation
(24), which is a required entry intermediate (Fig.
3E). This is in contrast to other broadly neutraliz-
ing antibodies that stabilize the prefusion closed
conformation (6, 24). We also tested the effect

 bridging sheet, which is required for co-receptor
binding and virus entry (26, 27). We observed the
CD4-induced formation of the bridging sheet
formation—as detected by binding to antibody
17b—to be substantially inhibited by VRC34.01
(Fig. 3F and fig. S17). These results indicate that
VRC34.01 recognizes cell-free virus and is able
to engage the prefusion closed state while sta-
bilizing Env in an intermediate state; VRC34.01
thus appears not to interfere with virus attach-
ment to cell surface CD4 but to inhibit CD4-
induced formation of the bridging sheet (26),
which is required for co-receptor engagement
and viral entry.
We docked the VRC34.01-SOSIP.664 complex
into EM-observed electron density (28), which
positioned the N terminus of the fusion peptide
~20 Å from the membrane (Fig. 4A). We carried
out molecular dynamics simulations (29) over
500 ns on fully glycosylated BG505 SOSIP.664
with fusion peptide initially in the VRC34.01-
bound conformation (Fig. 4B and fig. S18) (30);
this analysis indicated residues 512 to 520 of the
fusion peptide to be solvent-exposed, with the ex-
posed residue range coinciding closely with the
epitope recognized by VRC34.01 (Fig. 4B and
fig. S18). Despite this flexibility, a 20 Å approach
to the viral membrane (Fig. 4C), and intrinsic
prefusion motion of HIV-1 Env (24), there did
not seem to be an issue with the fusion peptide
being trapped by the viral membrane or induc-
ing trimer aggregation (31).
VRC34.01 antibody recognition of the fusion
peptide is shared to a limited degree by antibody
PGT151, which binds in the vicinity of VRC34.01
(figs. S9 and S11). To provide further insight into
the antibody-specific recognition of the fusion
peptide during HIV-1 infection, we designed a
VRC34-epitope scaffold (32, 33) (fig. S19 and da-
tabase S3). This scaffold was used to assess 24
sera from a cohort of HIV-1–infected subjects.
Ten sera displayed specific recognition of the
fusion peptide (figs. S20 and S21), with four sera
showing reduced neutralization when a fusion
peptide–specific mutation G516A was introduced
(fig. S22).
In summary, the N terminus of the fusion
peptide on HIV-1 is antibody-accessible, binding
and neutralizing antibodies against it are elicited
during natural infection, and broadly neutraliz-
ing antibodies recognize it either partially (anti-
bodyPGT151)(34,35)ormorecompletely(antibody
VRC34.01). Taken together, our results indicate
the fusion peptide of the Env trimer to be a region
of interest for vaccine design against HIV-1.

30. While 500 ns is not enough time to sample large-scale
conformational transitions associated with the prefusion
HIV-1 Env trimer, it should be sufficient to assess local
motions of the fusion peptide.
31. When trimers are positioned into nearest-neighbor contact,
only the N-terminal three residues of the fusion peptide can
extend to contact a fusion peptide on a neighboring trimer. The
N-terminal three residues of the fusion peptide are Ala-Val-Gly.
Although the Ala-Val are somewhat hydrophobic, the positive
charges of two N termini likely repel, preventing aggregation.
In terms of close-by glycans, these may help to prevent
aggregation, especially glycans N88, N611, and N618. However,
it appears to be primarily the recessed nature of the fusion
peptide, coupled to the fact that only eight residues of the
fusion peptide are flexible (Fig. 4), that prevents aggregation.

after the injection ended. Binding to CD4-Ig normalized with

38. The HIV Env trimer is conformationally dynamic. Binding and
smFRET experiments show that VRC34 do not bind to the

neutralized. The conformation specificity of VRC34.01 for the
closed and intermediate conformation may explain the
observed incomplete neutralization.

ORIGIN OF LIFE
A high-yielding, strictly regioselective
prebiotic purine nucleoside
formation pathway
Sidney Becker,* Ines Thoma,* Amrei Deutsch, Tim Gehrke, Peter Mayer,
Hendrik Zipse, Thomas Carell†
The origin of life is believed to have started with prebiotic molecules reacting along
unidentified pathways to produce key molecules such as nucleosides. To date, a single
prebiotic pathway to purine nucleosides had been proposed. It is considered to
be inefficient due to missing regioselectivity and low yields. We report that the
condensation of formamidopyrimidines (FaPys) with sugars provides the natural
N-9 nucleosides with extreme regioselectivity and in good yields (60%). The FaPys are
available from formic acid and aminopyrimidines, which are in turn available from
prebiotic molecules that were also detected during the Rosetta comet mission. This
nucleoside formation pathway can be fused to sugar-forming reactions to produce
pentosides, providing a plausible scenario of how purine nucleosides may have formed
under prebiotic conditions.
I
t is assumed that life originated from a sim-
ple set of small molecules. These prebiotic
molecules can be found on comets and as
components of Earth’s early atmosphere (1, 2).
The RNA-world hypothesis (3, 4) posits that
these molecules assembled to produce nucleosides,
and later informational polymers, which are able
to replicate themselves. A prebiotically plausible
route to pyrimidine nucleosides provides these
key building blocks in a stepwise reaction se-
quence in high yields (5). The situation is less
clear for the purine nucleosides, which are not
only central components of DNA and RNA but also
constituents of adenosine triphosphate and gua-
nosine triphosphate and substructures in many
coenzymes (6).
Presently, the only prebiotic route to purine
nucleosides proposes the condensation of the
complete nucleobase, such as adenine (1, R1 =
NH2, R2 = H), with ribose 2 in the molten state
(Fig. 1A) (7). This reaction provides complex mix-
tures of purine ribosides with yields of about 4%
for adenosine (b-fA). The reaction needs adenine
1 as its hydrochloride salt and subsequent equi-
libration of the mixture under basic (NH4OH)
conditions (8). Because many of the N atoms of
the purine skeleton can react, a regioselectivity
problem is encountered, which is responsible for
the low yields. In addition, the N-9 atoms of the
purine heterocycles, which connect the nucle-
obase with the sugar in canonical purine ribosides,
are particularly unreactive. This, together with
the fact that the purine heterocycles themselves
are available only in low yields under prebiotic
