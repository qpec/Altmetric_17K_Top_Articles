ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To determine whether low intensity pulsed ultrasound 
(LIPUS), compared with sham treatment, accelerates 
functional recovery and radiographic healing in 
patients with operatively managed tibial fractures.
Design
A concealed, randomized, blinded, sham controlled 
clinical trial with a parallel group design of 501 
patients, enrolled between October 2008 and 
September 2012, and followed for one year.
setting
43 North American academic trauma centers.
PartiCiPants
Skeletally mature men or women with an open or 
closed tibial fracture amenable to intramedullary nail 
fixation. Exclusions comprised pilon fractures, tibial 
shaft fractures that extended into the joint and 
required reduction, pathological fractures, bilateral 
tibial fractures, segmental fractures, spiral fractures 
>7.5 cm in length, concomitant injuries that were likely 
to impair function for at least as long as the patient’s 
tibial fracture, and tibial fractures that showed <25%
cortical contact and >1 cm gap after surgical fixation. 
3105 consecutive patients who underwent 
intramedullary nailing for tibial fracture were 
assessed, 599 were eligible and 501 provided informed 
consent and were enrolled.
interventiOns
Patients were allocated centrally to self administer 
daily LIPUS (n=250) or use a sham device (n=251) until 
their tibial fracture showed radiographic healing or 
until one year after intramedullary fixation.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Primary registry specified outcome was time to 
radiographic healing within one year of fixation; 
secondary outcome was rate of non-union. Additional 
protocol specified outcomes included short form-36 
(SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) scores, 
return to work, return to household activities, return to 
≥80% of function before injury, return to leisure 
activities, time to full weight bearing, scores on the 
health utilities index (mark 3), and adverse events 
related to the device.
results
SF-36 PCS data were acquired from 481/501 (96%) 
patients, for whom we had 2303/2886 (80%) 
observations, and radiographic healing data were 
acquired from 482/501 (96%) patients, of whom 82 
were censored. Results showed no impact on SF-36 
PCS scores between LIPUS and control groups 
(mean difference 0.55, 95% confidence interval 
−0.75 to 1.84; P=0.41) or for the interaction 
between time and treatment (P=0.30); minimal 
important difference is 3-5 points) or in other 
functional measures. There was also no difference 
in time to radiographic healing (hazard ratio 1.07, 
95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.34; P=0.55). 
There were no differences in safety outcomes 
between treatment groups. Patient compliance was 
moderate; 73% of patients administered ≥50% of 
all recommended treatments.
COnClusiOns
Postoperative use of LIPUS after tibial fracture fixation 
does not accelerate radiographic healing and fails to 
improve functional recovery.

Introduction
Tibial shaft fractures, the most common long bone 
 
fracture,1  are typically managed with intramedullary 
nailing.2  Operatively managed tibial fractures generally 
require three to six months before patients return to 
their functional status before injury. Moreover, the lim-
ited soft tissue envelope surrounding the bone predis-
poses tibial fractures to non-union.3  Low intensity 
pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) is commonly used in North 
America after fracture surgery to accelerate fracture 
healing and prevent non-union.2 4  Although random-
ized trials have suggested that LIPUS improves radio-
graphic healing, inferences are limited because of small 
sample size, risk of bias, and inconsistent results.5 
 
Moreover, radiographic fracture healing represents a 
surrogate outcome that might not translate into acceler-
ated functional recovery.6
In 2004, global revenues for bone stimulators were 
about $400 m (£234 m, €267 m).7  Widespread use, how-
ever, does not assure effectiveness. Each year, unneces-
sary interventions are estimated to account for 10-30%

of spending on healthcare in the US, or $250 bn-$800 bn 
(£154 bn-£490 bn; €190 bn-€610 bn).8  Reasons for 
unnecessary treatment include knowledge gaps, biased 
research, profit seeking, patient demand, and rapid 
uptake of unproved technology.9 Interest in curtailing 
unnecessary treatment is growing. For instance, the 
American Board of Internal Medicine launched its 
Choosing Wisely campaign in December 2011, and the 
BMJ’s “Too Much Medicine” initiative highlights the 
waste of resources on unnecessary care.10  
11
To resolve the uncertainty regarding the role of LIPUS 
in operatively managed patients with tibial fractures, 
we conducted a multicentre, sham controlled, random-
ized controlled trial that prioritized functional recovery. 
The design of our trial was informed by a pilot study12 
 
and a survey of 450 orthopedic trauma surgeons2 that 
found surgeons were managing almost all tibial frac-
tures operatively and using intramedullary nailing in 
more than 80% of fractures. Of the respondents, 45% 
used bone stimulators—evenly split between LIPUS and 
electrical stimulation. Our null hypothesis was that 
there would be no difference in functional recovery or 
radiographic healing after surgical repair of a traumatic 
tibial fracture with intramedullary nailing, whether 
managed with adjunctive LIPUS or a sham device.
Methods
trial design
This multicenter, randomized, blinded, sham con-
trolled, parallel group clinical trial was conducted at 43 
North American university affiliated academic trauma 
centres between October 2008 and March 2013. There 
were no shared patients between the TRUST pilot 
study12 and the TRUST definitive trial.
Patient selection
Eligible patients were skeletally mature men or women 
with an open (Gustilo type I-IIIB) or closed (Tscherne 
grade 0-3) tibial fracture amenable to intramedullary 
nail fixation who provided written informed consent 
within 14 days of intramedullary nailing and were will-
ing and able to comply with the study protocol.
We excluded patients in whom wound care precluded 
ultrasound-skin contact, pilon fractures, tibial shaft 
fractures that extended into the knee or ankle joint and 
required reduction, pathological fractures, bilateral tib-
ial fractures, segmental fractures, spiral fractures 
>7
.5 cm in length, concomitant injuries that, in the opin-
ion of the attending surgeon, were likely to impair func-
tion for at least as long as the patient’s tibial fracture,
and tibial fractures that showed less than 25% cortical
contact and >1 cm gap after intramedullary nail fixa-
tion. We also excluded patients if there were likely to be 
problems with maintaining follow-up (such as no fixed 
address), patients with cognitive impairment or lan-
guage difficulties that would impede the valid comple-
tion of questionnaires, women who were pregnant or
nursing or planned to become pregnant during their
treatment period, or patients with osteobiologic
implants at the site of their tibial fracture or with active 
implanted devices such as cardiac pacemakers.
randomization and masking
The manufacturer labeled and shipped visually iden-
tical active and inactivated (sham) Exogen 4000+ 
ultrasound device units to investigational sites 
according to a computer generated randomization 
plan created by the McMaster University methods 
center. Randomization was stratified by center and 
severity of soft tissue injury (open or closed) with ran-
domly varied block sizes ranging from 2 to 4. After 
fracture fixation with an intramedullary nail, partici-
pating investigators randomized patients, in a 1:1 
ratio, to LIPUS or a deactivated device (identical in 
appearance and apparent function) by accessing a 24 
hour toll-free remote telephone randomization sys-
tem that ensured concealment. Patients, surgeons 
and other clinicians, data collectors, outcome adjudi-
cators, data analysts, and the industry sponsor were 
blind to treatment allocation until the data analysis 
was complete.
Perioperative care
Trauma fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons 
administered standardized care before and after sur-
gery. The type of intramedullary nailing (reamed or 
unreamed), and the number of interlocking screws 
used, were at the discretion of the attending surgeon. 
For closed fractures, the protocol specified preopera-
tive antibiotic administration be continued for 24 
hours postoperatively, and for open fractures, antibi-
otic administration (including a cephalosporin and 
an aminoglycoside, if indicated for grade IIIA-IIIB 
fractures) continued for 72 hours postoperatively. Irri-
gation and debridement of soft tissues and contami-
nated bone was repeated as necessary, and delayed 
wound closure, split thickness skin grafting, or mus-
cle flaps (for grade IIIB only) occurred only after the 
initial surgery. For both open and closed fractures, 
cortical contact of the fracture ends guided weight 
bearing. If cortical contact was achieved, patients 
were instructed to weight bear as tolerated. Other-
wise, patients were instructed to partially weight bear 
on the affected limb until performance of a definitive 
procedure to achieve contact.
interventions
Each patient received a LIPUS device containing a timer 
that monitored treatment times and automatically 
turned the unit off after 20 minutes, verbal instructions 
in its use, and a booklet containing detailed instruc-
tions. The device transmits a low intensity ultrasound 
signal (30 mW/cm2) to the fracture site through cou-
pling gel. This is similar to diagnostic ultrasound levels 
used in sonography (fetal monitoring) procedures. 
Because of the low intensity, patients feel no sensation 
during treatment. The active and sham devices had the 
same visual, tactile, and auditory signals and were 
therefore indistinguishable. Patients self administered 
treatment once daily for 20 minutes until their surgeon 
determined that their fracture showed radiographic evi-
dence of bridging at all four cortices or until the 52 week 
follow-up visit, whichever occurred first.

Outcome measures
We assessed outcomes at discharge and at follow-up 
visits at 6, 12, 18, 26, 38, and 52 weeks postoperatively. 
We submitted our trial protocol to the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for approval with a primary effec-
tiveness outcome of return to function (short form-36 
(SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) scores). 
The FDA, however, requested we change our primary 
outcome to radiographic healing. After discussion, the 
FDA agreed to accept a co-primary outcome of SF-36 
PCS scores and time to radiographic healing, with the 
understanding that, in independent analyses, both 
endpoints had to show a clinically important treatment 
effect for the results to be considered positive. The pri-
mary safety outcome was the difference between treat-
ment groups in the proportion of patients with adverse 
events related to the device and unplanned secondary 
procedures related to bone healing and infection.
In December 2015 the industry sponsor edited the 
trial registry data to reflect the co-primary outcome 
agreed with the FDA (that is, added SF-36 PCS scores) 
and replaced the secondary outcome of rate of non-
union with treatment compliance. The primary and sec-
ondary outcomes that we have reported are consistent 
with the original protocol with the modification 
requested by the FDA.
The SF-36 has shown construct validity, test-retest 
reliability, and acceptable responsiveness in orthopedic 
populations; evidence suggests that patients consider a 
difference of 3-5 points or more as important.13-16  Our 
survey of orthopedic trauma surgeons found that 80% 
of respondents thought a reduction in healing time of 
six weeks or more, attributed to a bone stimulator, 
would be important to patients.2
A central adjudication committee, comprising ortho-
pedic trauma surgeons who were blind to device alloca-
tion, independently adjudicated patient eligibility, time 
to radiographic healing (bridging of three cortices), 
non-union, secondary procedures, and adverse events 
related to the fracture. Radiographic non-union was 
defined as failure of the fracture to progress further 
towards radiographic healing for at least eight consec-
utive weeks, after a minimum of six months (26 weeks) 
after initial intramedullary nailing. Any disagreements 
were resolved through discussion.
Study centers sent digital photographs of anteropos-
terior and lateral radiographs to the methods center. 
The adjudication committee assessed radiographic 
healing using the radiographic union scale for tibial 
fractures (RUST) system, which assigns a score to 
anteroposterior and lateral radiographs based on the 
assessment of healing at each of the four cortices visible 
on these projections.17 Each cortex receives a score of 1 
point if it is deemed to have a fracture line with no cal-
lus, 2 points if there is callus present but a fracture line 
is still visible, and 3 points if there is bridging callus 
with no evidence of a fracture line. The individual corti-
cal scores were added to give a total for each set of films 
with 4 being the minimum, indicating the fracture is 
definitely not healed, and 12 the maximum score, indi-
cating the fracture is fully healed. A cortex was judged 
as bridged when it achieved a RUST score of 2 or 3. 
Although they were deemed radiographically healed 
when, in the opinion of the adjudication committee, 
three cortices were bridged, to guard against missing 
data from misclassification by site investigators, 
patients continued to use their study device and 
undergo radiographic evaluation until the site investi-
gator determined that all four cortices were bridged. 
Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were standard-
ized, whenever possible, with use of the same x ray 
machine at each site and the same exposure settings.
Secondary outcomes were return to work without 
limitations among those who were employed before 
their injury; return to household activities without lim-
itations; return to at least 80% of function from before 
injury; return to leisure activities without limitations; 
time to full weight bearing; and scores on the health 
utilities index (mark 3), which is a validated generic 
utility measure—evidence suggests patients consider a 
difference of ≥0.03 points as important.18 We evaluated 
self reported function by having participants indicate at 
each follow-up visit, on a scale from 0% to 100%, what 
their overall level of functioning was, with 0% repre-
senting no ability to function and 100% representing 
their level of functioning before injury.
sample size
The smallest difference in score SF-36 PCS that would be 
important for patients is not well established, and 
investigators have provided different estimates; how-
ever, a 3-5 point change in score on a 0-100 scale is often 
cited as a minimally important difference, based on the 
work by Stewart and colleagues.19  Based on our previ-
ous study of health related quality of life in patients 
with distal tibial fractures,15  and the TRUST pilot 
study,12 we anticipated a standard deviation of ≤12 for 
SF-36 PCS scores. Considering these findings, we esti-
mated that 250 patients per group would be required to 
have a power of 80% (α=0.05, two tailed) to identify a 
difference in absolute scores of 3 points between treat-
ment and control groups. Our power calculation was 
based on detecting an average difference between the 
groups, rather than the test of the interaction term 
planned in the analysis, and was therefore conserva-
tive. Our sample size calculation is based on SF-36 PCS 
scores as our co-primary outcome measure, radio-
graphic healing, is a surrogate for functional recovery.
interim analysis and guidelines for study 
discontinuation
We planned an interim analysis when 300 patients had 
completed the trial, with review by a data monitoring 
committee using the O’Brien-Fleming stopping rule.20 
The industry sponsor, however, conducted an 
unplanned interim analysis of blinded data from 237 
TRUST patients with one year follow-up in November 
2012 (groups were analyzed as “group A” and “group B”). 
Based on the finding of no difference in treatment effect 
between groups, and thus a conclusion of futility, the 
sponsor discontinued the study. We continued to collect 
data from patients up to March 2013. Submission was 
 on 2 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

delayed as we dealt with the industry sponsor’s many 
concerns, including requests for many post hoc sub-
group analyses. All patients, clinicians, investigators, 
data analysts, and the industry sponsor remained 
blinded to allocation until analysis of all data was 
 
completed.
statistical analyses
All patients enrolled were analyzed according to their 
randomized group, regardless of compliance with treat-
ment or any other deviation from protocol (intention to 
treat principle). All patients without full follow-up, 
regardless of reason, were censored at their last fol-
low-up. Data analyses were conducted with SAS version 
9.4 (SAS Institute) with a threshold P≤0.05. We calcu-
lated compliance with treatment by dividing the num-
ber of days that patients administered ≥18 minutes of 
LIPUS/day from the day they received their study device 
to when they achieved radiographic healing or their 
52-week follow-up, by the total number of days within 
this time period.
Primary analyses considered only available data 
without imputation for missing data. We used multi-
level linear models to examine SF-36 PCS and scores on 
the health utilities index over time including time, 
treatment, the interaction between time and treatment, 
severity of soft tissue injury (open versus closed), and 
the interaction between severity and time as indepen-
dent variables in the model. The multi-level model, 
which allows for the clustering of repeated measures 
within patients and the clustering of patients within 
treatment site, included three levels: site, patient, and 
follow-up visit. We also performed adjusted analyses 
that added the following independent variables to our 
models: age, sex, smoking status, fracture gap, fracture 
pattern, and fracture grade, but not severity or its inter-
action with time because open versus closed is part of 
the fracture grade variable. We conducted a sensitivity 
analysis for SF-36 PCS scores using non-linear multiple 
imputation (fully conditional specification approach) to 
deal with missing observations.21 
22
We evaluated time to radiographic healing, time to 
full weight bearing, time to return to work without 
restrictions, time to return to household duties without 
restrictions, time to return to at least 80% of function 
before injury, and time to return to leisure activities 
without restrictions, in LIPUS compared with control 
groups, using Cox proportional hazards models strati-
fied by severity of soft tissue injury and clinical site. For 
time to radiographic healing, we also performed an 
adjusted Cox proportional hazards model including 
age, sex, smoking status, fracture gap, fracture pattern, 
and fracture grade as covariates. This model was not 
stratified by severity of soft tissue injury because open/
closed is included in the fracture grade variable. The 
date on which patients received their study device was 
used as the starting point for all time to event analyses. 
In our analyses of binary endpoints, because they 
would be missing completely at random (uninformed 
censoring), we included patients who died or who did 
not continue to one year because the trial was stopped 
early. Data from patients lost to follow-up were also 
included up to the point of loss (informed censoring).
We compared the proportion of adverse events 
related to the device, deaths, unplanned secondary pro-
cedures related to bone healing and infection, and the 
occurrence of non-union between ultrasound and con-
trol groups with Pearson’s χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test.
subgroup and sensitivity analyses
We planned one a priori subgroup analysis based on 
open versus closed fractures, with the anticipation that 
open fractures would show larger treatment effects.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for recruitment, design or implemen-
tation of the study. We did, however, respond to patient 
feedback regarding excessive questionnaire burden in 
the TRUST pilot study.12 No patients were asked to 
advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There 
are no plans to disseminate the results of the research to 
study participants or the relevant patient community.
 Results
Participants
Of 3105 patients screened, 501 met eligibility criteria, 
provided informed consent, and were randomized 
(fig 1). Most exclusions of potentially eligible patients 
occurred because fractures were not amenable to an 
intramedullary nail, patients were aged <18, patients 
stated they could not comply with the study protocol, or 
because there was concomitant injury that was likely to 
impair function for longer than their tibial fracture.
Most patients were men who had been injured in a 
fall resulting in a closed tibial fracture, and 368 (74%) 
were employed before their injury; patients’

characteristics were similar in intervention and control 
groups (table 1). As a result of the industry sponsor’s 
decision to stop the study early, 73 patients were fol-
lowed up for fewer than 12 months (see table A in 
appendix for further details). Data on patient compli-
ance were available for 424 patients (62 did not return 
their study device, and 15 devices failed to record 
 
compliance); 189 (45%) had ≥75% compliance and 119 
(28%) had ≥50% but <75% compliance. There was no 
difference in compliance between treatment groups.
We acquired SF-36 PCS data from 481/501 (96%) 
patients, from whom we had 2303/2886 (80%) observa-
tions. We included data on radiographic healing for 
482/501 (96%) patients in our analysis, of whom 82 
were censored. We acquired health utilities index data 
from 481/501 (96%) patients, from whom we had 
2304/2886 (80%) observations. Our rate of follow-up for 
secondary functional outcomes was 83% (406/490) for 
return to at least 80% of function before injury, 78% 
(269/347) for return to work without limitations, 73% 
(343/473) for return to household activities without lim-
itations, 91% (451/497) for return to full weight bearing, 
and 70% (321/457) for return to leisure activities without 
limitations. The rate of follow-up for secondary func-
tional outcomes considered all enrolled patients minus 
those affected by early trial stoppage who had not yet 
experienced the event of interest.
effectiveness
Results differed little between primary analyses, 
adjusted analyses, and analyses with imputation (fig A 
in appendix); we report here the unadjusted analyses. 
Our repeated measures analyses found no significant 
interaction for treatment by time (P=0.30 for SF-36 PCS, 
fig 2 ; P=0.94 for health utilities index). Treatment failed 
to influence SF-36 PCS scores (mean difference 0.55, 
95% confidence interval −0.75 to 1.84; P=0.41; table B in 
appendix), or health utilities index scores (0.01, −0.02 to 
0.05; P=0.44; table C in appendix). Time to radiographic 
healing was also similar between groups (hazard ratio 
1.07
, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.34; P=0.55; fig 3; 
table D in appendix).

We found no differences in time to return to work 
without limitations (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence 
interval 0.82 to 1.50; P=0.51; table E in appendix), time 
to return household activities without limitations (0.94, 
0.73 to 1.22; P=0.65; table F in appendix), time to full 
weight bearing (0.87; 0.70 to 1.08; P=0.21; table G in 
appendix), time to return to ≥80% of function before 
injury (1.00, 0.80 to 1.25; P=0.97; table H in appendix), 
or time to return to leisure activities without limitations 
(1.06, 0.77 to 1.46; P=0.72; table I in appendix). Table 2 
summarizes the results. Subgroup analyses suggested 
no difference in treatment effect for open versus closed 
fractures for SF-36 PCS scores (P=0.59 for interaction), 
health utilities index scores (P=0.64 for interaction), or 
radiographic healing (P=0.65 for interaction).
safety
No site investigators reported adverse events associated 
with the study treatment. There was one death among 
the patients randomized to LIPUS and two among the 
patients randomized to sham treatment (P=0.62). The 
risks of unplanned secondary procedures related to 
bone healing (11/250 v 9/251; P=0.66), infection (2/250 v 
3/251; P=1.00), and non-union (9/250 v 5/251; P=0.28) 
were similar between groups.
discussion
Principal findings
In this randomized controlled clinical trial of patients 
undergoing surgery for fresh tibial fracture, the addi-
tion of low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) did not 
improve functional recovery or accelerate radiographic 
healing.
strengths and limitations
Strengths of this randomized trial include our pragmatic 
design;23 a sample size sufficient to generate  
narrow 
confidence intervals; multiple participating  
surgeons 
and centers, enhancing generalizability;  
strategies to 
reduce bias that included central randomization to 
ensure concealment, blinding of patients, clinicians, 
data collectors, outcome assessors, data analysts and 
the industry sponsor, and independent, blinded adjudi-
cation of eligibility and outcomes; and completion of 
≥80% of all follow-up visits for our primary outcomes.
The primary limitation of our trial was our failure to 
obtain 100% follow-up for our primary outcomes, and 
larger loss to follow-up for some secondary outcomes; 
however, multiple imputation led to similar estimates 
of treatment effects, providing reassurance that loss to 
follow-up was unlikely to have biased our results.
Patient compliance was moderate and is a possible 
explanation for differences in results between TRUST 
and previous studies. Two previous trials of LIPUS for 
fracture healing ensured close to perfect compliance by 
having investigators administer LIPUS to patients in 
hospital24  or to officers stationed at a naval academy 
that were required to report for daily treatment.25  The 
former found no effect on time to when the callus was 
considered strong enough for safe removal of the fixator 
after high tibial osteotomy (0.8 weeks earlier, 95% con-
fidence interval 2.3 weeks earlier to 0.71 weeks later; 
P=0.31),24  and the latter found no effect on time to 
return to active duty after tibial stress fracture (0.4 days 
earlier, 14.1 days earlier to 13.3 days later; P=0.96).25
In the outpatient setting in which LIPUS is used, 
patients use the device themselves. Compliance with 
treatments is, in general, limited;26  this is particularly 
true of treatments that involve the level of inconvenience 
or burden associated with LIPUS (for example, the ninth 
edition of the American College of Chest Physicians Evi-
dence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines noted that 
compliance is the greatest challenge associated with use 
of outpatient limb compression devices in orthopedic 
surgical patients27). Thus, the compliance found in our 
trial—only 73% of our patients administered ≥50% of all 
recommended treatments—probably reflects patients’ 
use in real clinical settings. The level of compliance we 
observed is high enough that, if effects on time to radio-
graphic healing seen in previous studies were present in 
our patients, we would have seen a substantial (albeit 
possibly attenuated) impact of the device.
implications
The FDA approved LIPUS for fracture healing in 1994 on 
the basis of small trials at high risk of bias that showed 
that LIPUS accelerated radiographic healing.28  Many 
medical devices, however, are approved for sale with-
out randomized trial evidence of important benefit to 
patients.29  A study published in 2016 found that of 99 
medical devices recently approved by the FDA, 43 were 
cleared or approved before a clinical study was pub-
lished.30  Further, as is the case with LIPUS,31-33  device 
inventors or industry employees are often investigators 
on clinical trials that are used to gain regulatory 
approval.34 Our experience suggests the high desirabil-
ity of demanding evidence from randomized trials con-
ducted by investigators other than those who will gain 
financially from clinical use of the device before 
approval by regulatory agencies.
Conclusions
Among patients undergoing intramedullary nailing for 
a tibial shaft fracture the addition of low intensity 
pulsed ultrasound does not improve functional recov-
ery or accelerate radiographic healing.
