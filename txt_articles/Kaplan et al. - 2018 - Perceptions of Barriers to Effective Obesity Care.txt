Objective: ACTION (Awareness, Care, and Treatment in Obesity maNagement) examined obesity-related
perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors among people with obesity (PwO), health care providers (HCPs),
and employer representatives (ERs).
Methods: A total of 3,008 adult PwO (BMI � 30 by self-reported height and weight), 606 HCPs, and 153
ERs completed surveys in a cross-sectional design.
Results: Despite several weight loss (WL) attempts, only 23% of PwO reported 10% WL during the pre-
vious 3 years. Many PwO (65%) recognized obesity as a disease, but only 54% worried their weight may
affect future health. Most PwO (82%) felt “completely” responsible for WL; 72% of HCPs felt responsible
for contributing to WL efforts; few ERs (18%) felt even partially responsible. Only 50% of PwO saw them-
selves as “obese,” and 55% reported receiving a formal diagnosis of obesity. Despite HCPs’ reported
comfort with weight-related conversations, time constraints deprioritized these efforts. Only 24% of PwO
had a scheduled follow-up to initial weight-related conversations. Few PwO (17%) perceived employer-
sponsored wellness offerings as helpful in supporting WL.
Conclusions: Although generally perceived as a disease, obesity is not commonly treated as such. Diver-
gence in perceptions and attitudes potentially hinders better management. This study highlights inconsis-
tent understanding of the impact of obesity and need for both self-directed and medical management.

Introduction
Despite increasing consensus that obesity is a serious, complex,
and chronic disease with considerable negative impact on individual
health and quality of life, as well as a significant societal burden
(1-8), addressing and treating obesity within the standard medical
context are uncommon. Increased awareness of a pathophysiological
basis for obesity has led to its growing recognition as a disease by
the health care community, but strong stigma persists against indi-
viduals with obesity and health care providers who treat them
(9,10). Only a small minority of patients with obesity receive clini-
cally proven lifestyle, pharmacological, and/or surgical interventions
(11). Although attitudes toward obesity are changing (12-14), there

CLINICAL TRIALS AND INVESTIGATIONS
Obesity
 appear to be strong impediments to effective care including obesity
prevention policies, behavior change communication, and health
care professional training (15-17). Broad-based efforts across multi-
ple stakeholder groups are needed to identify the most critical bar-
riers to effective obesity management. To advance these efforts, the
ACTION (Awareness, Care, and Treatment in Obesity maNagement)
study aimed to identify perceptions, attitudes, behaviors, and poten-
tial barriers to effective obesity care across three respondent types:
people with obesity (PwO), health care providers (HCPs), and
employer representatives (ERs). Specific aims were to gain greater
understanding of barriers preventing PwO from receiving effective
obesity care and support and to generate insights and recommended
strategies to guide collaborative action promoting effective care for
PwO.
Methods
Procedure
This study, sponsored by Novo Nordisk Inc., was approved by the
Copernicus Group Independent Review Board (18). Separate surveys
to assess obesity-related perceptions, behaviors, and barriers were
developed for PwO, HCPs, and ERs based on literature review and
qualitative research (19). Surveys were developed collaboratively
with the ACTION study steering committee, a multidisciplinary
team of professionals (including study authors) specializing in obe-
sity management within clinical practice, scientific investigation,
patient advocacy, employer human relations, and public policy. Sur-
veys were designed to facilitate comparisons within and across
respondent types (see online Supporting Information for surveys).

 Surveys were pretested among 10 PwO, 10 HCPs, and 3 ERs using
45-minute Web-assisted telephone interviews to assess clarity, face
validity, and relevance. Data were collected via online surveys using
a cross-sectional design. Additionally, PwO completed two previ-
ously psychometrically validated measures, Short Form Health Sur-
vey
(SF-12)
and
Impact

(IWQOL-Lite) (20,21), measuring general health-related quality of
life and weight-related quality of life, respectively. The study is reg-
istered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03223493).
Data collection and participants
Data were collected from October 29 to November 12, 2015. All
respondents were recruited via email or telephone through an online
panel company to which respondents had provided permission to be
contacted for research purposes.
To reduce possible sampling bias and enhance generalizability,
stratified sampling techniques were used based on self-reported
demographic criteria. PwO criteria included age, household income,
race/ethnicity, gender, and geographic region. HCP criteria included
practice setting, years in practice, geographic region, and professio-
nal training. The HCP stratified sampling plan included recruiting
primary care providers (PCPs) and obesity specialists at a 5:1 ratio.
PCPs were those practicing in primary care (i.e., general practice,
family practice, and internal medicine). Obesity specialists were
those practicing in primary care, endocrinology, bariatrics, or bariat-
ric surgery and identified as an obesity/weight loss (WL) specialist
and/or those who saw at least 50% of their patients for obesity. ERs
were selected from companies with 500 or more employees, divided
equally into those with 500 to 999, 1,000 to 4,999, and 5,000 or
more employees.
Prior to completing surveys, respondents provided informed con-
sent. PwO inclusion criteria were age �18, US residency, and
BMI �30 kg/m2 based on self-reported height and weight. HCP
inclusion criteria included employment in US facilities (except
Vermont to comply with Sunshine reporting requirements), spend-
ing a minimum of 70% of professional time in patient care,
seeing �100 patients during the previous month with �10 patients
in need of weight management, practicing 2 to 35 years in their
current role, and board certification or eligibility in their chosen
specialty (for physicians). Inclusion criteria for ER respondents
included age �18, working in the United States for companies
with �500 employees offering health insurance, responsible for
making or influencing decisions about employee health insurance
or health and wellness programs, and reported believing there is a
“weight issue” among their employee population. ERs and HCPs
were excluded if they reported working in market research, mar-
keting,
public
relations,
or
pharmaceutical/medical
device
manufacturing.
Five-point end-anchored Likert scales assessed agreement, in which
1 meant “do not agree at all” and 5 meant “completely agree.”
Responses of 4 or 5 were coded as “agree” and are reported as such
unless otherwise noted. The SF-12 and IWQOL-Lite were scored
according to standard scoring algorithms (20,22). Table 1 provides
scores on both instruments.
To reduce potential selection bias, respondent-level, individual
weighting was applied to the PwO sample. Using an established
weighting methodology (23), final data were weighted to representa-
tive demographic targets for age, household income, ethnicity, race,
Hispanic descent, gender, and US region based on the 2010 US Cen-
sus (24). Participant characteristics are reported for the final
unweighted sample. All other results are weighted unless otherwise
specified.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistical analysis (means, frequencies) was performed
using SPSS 15.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago). Tests of differences (v2, t
tests) within respondent types were performed using SPSS tables;
additional analysis was performed using Stata/IC 14.1 (StataCorp,
College Station, Texas). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05
using two-tailed tests. Multiple test corrections were not applied to
statistical tests, as this research was exploratory and descriptive in
nature.
Results
Response rates for PwO, HCP, and ER surveys were 9.7%, 20.4%,
and 14.6%, respectively. Completion times averaged 51.4 minutes,

 58.9 minutes, and 37.1 minutes, respectively. Suspension rates (i.e.,
not completing the survey) were 13.3%, 12.7%, and 4.3%, respec-
tively, typically occurring during the informed consent process (see
Supporting Information Figures S1-S3 and Table S1 for sample
dispositions).
Characteristics for the final sample for all groups are displayed in
Table 1 (additional details in Supporting Information Table S2).
Adult PwO (n 5 3,008, BMI � 30 kg/m2), 606 HCPs (83% PCPs,
17% WL specialists), and 153 ERs completed the surveys.
PwO survey results
Figure 1 illustrates types of obesity-related interactions PwO may
have experienced with HCPs. Seventy-one percent of PwO spoke
with an HCP about their weight within the past 5 years; fifty-five
percent reported being diagnosed with obesity (additionally, 77%
reported overweight diagnoses, with some reporting both). Thirty-
eight percent of PwO discussed a WL plan with an HCP within the
past 6 months. For many, these discussions came after numerous
reported “serious WL efforts” in their adult lifetime (median 5 3,
mean 5 7; Supporting Information Figure S4).
While all PwO had self-reported heights and weights equating to
obesity criteria (BMI � 30 kg/m2), only 50% perceived themselves
as “obese” or “extremely obese.” The remaining reported having
“overweight” (48%) or “normal weight” (2%). More than two-thirds
of PwO considered obesity to be as or more serious than many other
health conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and
depression (Supporting Information Figure S5).
Among PwO, 18% reported that “committed to a WL plan” best
describes them today. Among those who had spoken with an HCP
within the past 6 months, 26% reported having “committed to a WL
plan.” Of those PwO who had WL discussions in the past 5 years,
47% reported typically bringing up weight with their HCP at
appointments, and 53% reported their HCP bringing it up.
Among PwOs who had spoken with their HCP in the past 6
months, the most frequently reported goals included “to lose (any
amount) of weight,” “to improve my existing health conditions,”
“to reduce the risks associated with weight/prevent a health con-
dition,” or “to not gain any more weight” (Supporting Informa-
tion Table S3). PwO who discussed WL and were recommended
specific WL goals by their HCP reported the average goal was

 20% WL, consistent with the WL PwO reported needing to be
satisfed with their efforts (20%). When recommendations were
made for a specific reduction in pounds, the mean recommended
WL was 47 pounds.
In ascertaining WL among PwO, 23% reported a current weight at
least 10% less than their maximum weight during the previous 3
years. Of these, 44% (10% of the total PwO sample) reported having
maintained the WL for more than 1 year.
More than half (55%) of PwO were employed; among these, 12%
reported that their employer offered “nutrition coaching,” 9%
reported “healthy food options,” and 6% reported “onsite diet
programs.”
Additionally,
13%
of
PwO
reported
that
their
employer offered “insurance coverage for the medical treatment
of obesity.”
HCP survey results
Figure 2 illustrates top reasons cited by HCPs as to why they might
not initiate discussions about WL. “Lack of time/the appointment
was not long enough” was selected most often (52%), followed by
other “more important issues and concerns” (45%) (see Supporting
Information Table S4 for full list).
More than 50% of HCPs considered obesity at least as serious as
most other health conditions, including high blood pressure, diabe-
tes, and congestive heart failure (Supporting Information Figure S6).
They believed patients who are classified as overweight to class III
obesity are likely to live 4 to 17 years less, respectively, than
patients with healthy weight.
Sixty-seven percent of HCPs said they typically initiated weight
management discussions; thirty-three precent indicated that their

 patient brought it up. Sixty-seven percent of HCPs reported being
“very comfortable” or “extremely comfortable” talking with PwO
about weight management, whereas thirty-three percent reported
being “somewhat comfortable” or “a little comfortable.” When
describing treatment options, HCPs reported recommending “general
improvements in eating habits/reducing calories” and “generally
being more active/increasing physical activity” to a large proportion
of patients in need of weight management (58% and 57%, respec-
tively). Other specific treatment options were recommended to fewer
patients, including “counseling or lifestyle modification” (32%),
“visiting a nutritionist or dietician” (27%), “prescription WL medi-
cation” (11%), “visiting a WL specialist” (nonsurgical) or “WL clin-
ic” (9%), “over-the-counter WL medications” (4%), and “WL sur-
gery” (7%).
HCPs reported that they “always” (28%) or “most of the time”
(41%) recorded an “overweight” or “obesity” diagnosis in the medi-
cal record. Of those who did not say “always” or “most of the time”
(31%), 43% reported providing a verbal diagnosis.
ER survey results
Similar to HCPs, more than half of ERs considered obesity at least
as serious as most other conditions (Supporting Information Figure
S7). ERs were asked about the type of wellness programs currently
offered by their company, though not programs that are obesity spe-
cific. More than three-quarters (77%) reported that their company
provided health and wellness information to their employees. Provi-
sion of healthy food options and nutrition coaching were reported
by less than half of ERs (44% for both); provision of on-site diet
programs was reported by 16%.
Employer wellness programs were reportedly motivated by numer-
ous factors, including to “reduce insurance premiums/claims” (75%),
“promote healthy behaviors among employees” (72%), “improve the
physical well-being of employees” (70%), “support the well-being
of employees and their families” (61%), and “improve work
productivity” (53%).
Figure 3 shows concerns ERs expressed about offering insurance
coverage for obesity management. The primary concern, “costs of
premiums and/or medical claims,” was endorsed by 52% of ERs.
The next most commonly reported concerns were lack of data
regarding return on investment, treatment efficacy, and long-term
treatment benefits.
Divergent behaviors and attitudes potentially
creating barriers to obesity care
The panels in Figure 4 describe some key comparisons between
respondent groups. Agreement that “obesity is a disease” was most
prevalent among HCPs (80%), whereas PwO (65%) and ERs (64%)
were less likely to agree. In ascertaining perceived WL responsibil-
ity, 82% of PwO believed it was completely their own responsibil-
ity. Seventy-two percent of HCPs reported that they (HCPs) had a
responsibility to actively contribute to their patients’ WL. In con-
trast, nearly half of ERs (46%) disagreed with the statement that
employers have at least partial responsibility for employee WL.
However, there was agreement among all groups that a 10% WL
would be beneficial to overall health. A substantial disparity existed
in perceived effectiveness of employer wellness programs tailored to
PwO. Although 64% and 72% of HCPs and ERs, respectively,
reported that they are helpful, only 17% of PwO agreed.

 Although the majority of HCPs (93%) and ERs (78%) felt that a
person’s weight would affect their health in the future “a lot” or an
“extreme amount,” PwO were less likely to report this concern
about their own weight (54%). Perceived barriers to PwO initiating
WL were similar among all respondent groups (Table 2). Across all
three study groups, “lack of exercise” was the most agreed-upon
barrier to initiating WL efforts. “Lack of motivation” was the
second-most-cited reason among PwO, whereas “preference for
unhealthy food” was cited relatively more frequently among HCPs
and ERs. “Controlling hunger” was also a frequently mentioned rea-
son. See Supporting Information Table S5 for a comprehensive list
of cited reasons.
PwO and HCPs diverged on reasons for PwO not seeking obesity
care. Among PwO who had not sought help from their HCP, the top
two reasons cited (Table 3) were a belief that managing their weight
was their own responsibility (44%) and that they knew what was
needed to manage their weight (37%). In contrast, the primary rea-
son cited by HCPs was PwO’s embarrassment (selected by HCPs at
a rate far higher than by PwO—65% vs. 15%, respectively). A full
list of the reasons PwO do not seek help and reasons HCPs gave for
PwO not seeking help are provided in Supporting Information
Tables S6 and S7, respectively.
Relatively few HCPs (9%) reported that they did not schedule fol-
low-ups after discussing weight. In contrast, among PwO who dis-
cussed their weight with an HCP, 24% reported that a weight-
related follow-up appointment was scheduled. Both HCPs and PwO
reported that these follow up visits were not always kept. Only 4%
of HCPs reported patients “always” kept follow-up appointments
and half of HCPs (49%) reported that patients kept follow-up
appointments “most of the time.” More than 95% either have kept
or intended to keep the follow-up appointment.
Most PwO and HCPs agreed that general eating improvements and
increases in physical activity are “completely effective” for long-
term weight management. For most other treatments, such as nutri-
tion/exercise tracking, nutritional counseling, medication, and sur-
gery, HCPs perceived greater effectiveness than PwO (Figure 5).
Discussion
The ACTION study highlighted current obesity perceptions and dif-
fered from other studies in its inclusion of three stakeholder groups,
PwO, HCPs, and ERs. Viewing these perceptions from the vantage
point of three key stakeholders, we found differences in attitudes
about underlying cause(s) and appropriate treatment of obesity.
Despite general consensus that obesity is a disease, the strong belief
held by PwO that WL is their responsibility combined with their rel-
atively low concern about the impact of weight on future health
may contribute to their not seeking medical care for it. Lack of for-
mal obesity diagnoses, low prioritization of WL discussions by
HCPs, lack of follow-up care, divergent beliefs between PwO and
HCPs about obesity treatment effectiveness, and low perceived value
of employer wellness programs among PwO may also impact suc-
cessful weight management.
Most (80%) HCPs recognize that obesity is a chronic disease with
an impact on health and life expectancy, but fewer PwO and ERs
recognize obesity’s seriousness. Only about half of PwO believe an
individual’s weight could negatively impact future health, consider-
ably less than reported by HCPs and ERs. Most (82%) PwO feel
reducing their weight is their responsibility. However, as the major-
ity of HCPs feel they have a responsibility to contribute to their
patients’ WL efforts, this could be an opportunity to help encourage
HCPs take a more active role in facilitating obesity-related discus-
sions with their patients.
Perceived WL barriers are similar among all three respondent
groups, with lack of exercise and motivation most commonly cited.

 However, there is lack of alignment regarding reasons why PwO
may not seek obesity care from HCPs. HCPs are more likely to
view PwO as unmotivated to lose weight or too embarrassed to dis-
cuss their weight than PwO are to report this about themselves.
PwO report not initiating conversations about their weight primarily
because of the belief that managing their weight is their own respon-
sibility and that they already know what is needed to be successful.
Although obesity is generally perceived to be a disease, it is not typ-
ically treated as such. Discussion of weight management tends to be
deprioritized among HCPs, despite the negative impact on quality of
life and longevity. Even when weight is discussed, just over half of
PwO report receiving a diagnosis of obesity, which is often not
documented.
Further, once WL conversations occur, follow-up care is not routine,
with only about one-quarter of PwO reporting that a follow-up
appointment is scheduled. This may be partly due to HCP percep-
tions of a lack of time in daily practice to address obesity.
When ascertaining perceived treatment effectivness, lifestyle interven-
tions (healthy eating and physical activity) are considered more useful
than medical management among both PwO and HCPs. However,
HCPs have more confidence in surgical interventions and the benefits
of specialized nutrition or therapeutic counseling than PwO.
Lastly, PwO widely perceive that employer wellness programs have
limited value, as compared with the value reported by ERs and
HCPs. Employer perceptions of the relative cost-effectiveness of
available medical treatments and insufficient quality and quantity of
data demonstrating treatment effectiveness may limit insurance cov-
erage for obesity management.
Strengths
This study utilized a broad-based approach to query large samples
of three key participants in decision-making about health care. Inte-
gration of the perspective of PwO, HCPs, and employers has been
lacking in previous studies that have tried to address the barriers to
effective obesity care at a provider or system level (25,26). The sur-
veys used in this study were designed to cover a broad range of
obesity-related topics that could help identify and characterize atti-
tudes and barriers to effective obesity management. The robust
stratified sampling strategy used in this study enhances the general-
izability of the results.
Limitations
Survey research can be susceptible to measurement errors; the cross-
sectional design and self-reported nature of height and weight are
potential limiting factors. Many studies have supported the conclu-
sion that self-reported height and weight underestimates BMI (27).
Thus, with the inclusion criterion of BMI � 30 calculated from self-
reported height and weight, the actual BMI of subjects enrolled in
this study are likely to skew somewhat higher across the study popu-
lation. The study’s response rate, between 10% and 20%, may be
considered a limitation, as well as the survey durations, which
exceeded 37 minutes. However, comparison with the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (28) shows very similar
distributions among various PwO characteristics and demographics,
including BMI, age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income, and
marital status. While strong response rates are important in helping
to reduce selection bias, our stratified sampling approach likely miti-
gates overrepresentation among any one PwO group as related to
demographic factors. Finally, as this research was exploratory in
nature, statistical testing may have revealed differences not other-
wise found using multiple testing procedures.
Conclusions and implications
Some of the attitudes and barriers revealed in this study are likely mod-
ifiable, and correcting them should yield greater opportunities for more
effective obesity management. Although a cause-and-effect relation-
ship cannot be assumed for each barrier identified, these data provide
directions for future research necessary to reduce or overcome these
barriers. Obesity pathophysiology and management are often absent
from health professional school curricula, rendering most HCPs ill
equipped to address this problem. HCPs often recognize this limitation,
but there are few incentives to remedy it. Exacerbating the problem,
effective treatment of obesity is challenging, time-consuming, and
poorly reimbursed, for both provider and patient. In the face of a large
professional information gap, myths and misinformation abound. The
perceptions and behaviors observed in this study reveal a broad, unmet
opportunity to educate HCPs, PwO, ERs, and other stakeholders about
the biology of obesity and the opportunity, value, and need of profes-
sional health care-based interventions. Overcoming major barriers to
patients’ seeking and receiving care is a necessary prerequisite to
effectively addressing downstream barriers, whether from inadequate
quality of care or limited effectiveness of available therapies. Strat-
egies developed by collaborative efforts among PwO, HCPs, and ERs
will likely lead to a better understanding of obesity itself, and the
resulting solutions are more likely to be embraced, implemented, and
ultimately successful.
A possible first step to changing perceptions and treatment practices
for obesity is to further educate HCPs, PwO, and ERs about the
biology, chronicity, and overall health impact of the disease. Inform-
ing HCPs about the real barriers for PwO not discussing weight con-
cerns could reduce the reluctance among HCPs to proactively initi-
ate these important conversations. HCPs also need to be encouraged
to schedule follow-up visits focusing on the obesity diagnosis, given
patients’ inclination to keep these appointments. Finally, there is an
opportunity to increase understanding among ERs that obesity can
be
effectively
treated
as
a
disease,
potentially
helping
them
design better wellness programs and more rigorously assess their
effectiveness. O
