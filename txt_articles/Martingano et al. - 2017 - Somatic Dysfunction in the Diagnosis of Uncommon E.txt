ctopic pregnancy occurs in approximately 1.5% to 2.0% of all pregnancies1 and 
is the cause of 6% of all maternal deaths.2 While the majority of ectopic pregnan-
cies commonly encountered in clinical practice are located within the fallopian 
tube with a mortality rate of 0.5% deaths per 100,000 live births, maternal mortality from

Background: Ectopic pregnancies occur when the implantation of a fertilized ovum 
occurs outside the endometrial cavity. Such pregnancies occur in approximately 1.5% 
to 2.0% of all pregnancies and cause 6% of maternal deaths.
Objectives: To evaluate osteopathic structural examination (OSE) findings in patients 
with ectopic pregnancies of uncommon locations and to establish the utility of these 
findings in the diagnosis of these ectopic pregnancies.
Methods: In this prospective case series, a focused OSE was performed on each 
 
patient with an ectopic pregnancy at her initial presentation after the patient history 
but before other diagnostic or laboratory tests were performed and surgical treatment 
was initiated. Chapman reflex points (CRPs) were evaluated pre- and postoperatively. 
 
For comparison, patients who had otherwise normal first pregnancies, underwent elec-
tive postpartum bilateral tubal ligation, or had simple ovarian cysts were also included 
and received OSEs. 
Results: Seven cases with ectopic pregnancies outside the fallopian tube were in-
cluded. Two primary ovarian pregnancies and 1 heterotopic pregnancy (uterine and 
ovarian) had somatic dysfunction at the T10-T11 spinal levels and CRPs posterior 
for the ovary, 1 primary omental pregnancy with somatic dysfunction at the T9-T12 
spinal levels and CRPs anterior and posterior for the ileum and jejunum, and 1 tubal 
pregnancy with somatic dysfunction at the T10-L1 spinal levels and CRPs anterior 
and posterior for the fallopian tube. Two cornual ectopic pregnancies were not associ-
ated with unique findings. These somatic dysfunctions and CRP findings appear to be 
distinct from those of comparison cases, including first pregnancies at any trimester, 
simple ovarian cysts, and elective bilateral tubal ligation. 
Conclusion: The OSE findings demonstrated in these cases aided in the final diag-
nosis and thus can potentially prove helpful in cases of ovarian, tubal, and omental 
pregnancies to provide clues to abnormal ectopic pregnancy locations where diag-
nostic imaging results are insufficient or equivocal. Osteopathic structural examina-
tions may allow osteopathic physicians to better prepare for treatment approaches, 
including surgery.

The inclusion criteria were suspicion of ectopic preg-
nancy either clinically or by ultrasonography without 
diagnosis before time of OSE. Exclusion criteria were 
patients with confirmed location of ectopic pregnancy 
before OSE was performed. 
 
In the cases of ectopic pregnancy, a focused OSE was 
performed on each patient at her initial presentation after 
the patient history but before other diagnostic or labora-
tory tests were performed and surgical treatment was initi-
ated. During the OSE, the patient was supine and the 
thoracic and lumbar spinal regions and sacrum were 
evaluated, in addition to relevant anatomical locations of 
Chapman reflex points (CRPs), which included the areas 
of the rib cage and pelvis. The CRPs, which are otherwise 
known as specific areas of lymphatic and venous conges-
tion related to affected organs or pathologic process,8 were 
evaluated pre- and postoperatively. Findings from the 
OSEs were recorded in the patients’ medical records.
 
For comparison purposes, cases of normal first 
pregnancy, elective postpartum bilateral tubal liga-
tion, and simple ovarian cysts were also included. 
Patients with a normal first pregnancy underwent the 
same focused OSE and, so as not to confound the so-
matic dysfunction and CRP findings related to the 
uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries, included only those 
with a history of 1 pregnancy and no history of uterine 
or adnexal surgery. Findings from OSEs were re-
corded in the medical records. Patients seeking elec-
tive postpartum bilateral tubal ligation underwent a 
focused OSE preoperatively, immediately postopera-
tively, and 2 weeks postoperatively. “Immediately 
postoperatively” was defined as the period after the 
operation when the patient had completely recovered 
sensation from spinal anesthesia, so as not to inadver-
tently mask somatic dysfunctions. Patients with 
simple ovarian cysts underwent a focused OSE after 
identification of the cysts through transvaginal ultra-
sonography (TVUS). To eliminate varied results by 
different examiners, all OSEs were conducted by the 
same osteopathic physician (D.M.). 
ectopic pregnancies of uncommon locations is often 
much higher.3 Maternal mortality mainly results from 
delay of diagnosis before rupture and resultant maternal 
hemorrhage. One half of 1% to almost 3% of ectopic 
pregnancies are implanted within the ovary,3-5 1.3% are 
implanted within the abdominal cavity,4 and 2% to 4% 
of all ectopic pregnancies are cornual (or interstitial) 
pregnancies.4,6 
 
In addition to conventional means of diagnosing a 
patient’s condition, many osteopathic physicians use pal-
patory findings of the musculoskeletal system to aid in the 
physical examination of their patients when conducting 
an osteopathic structural examination (OSE). These 
physical examination findings, collectively referred to as 
somatic dysfunctions, the character and location of which 
depend on the specific organ or organs involved, aid in 
diagnosing and monitoring various disease states.7 
Although OSEs are often a part of osteopathic physicians’ 
initial diagnostic workup, OSE findings in cases of ec-
topic pregnancies of uncommon locations have yet to be 
described to the authors’ knowledge. 
 
We present a case series of OSE findings in patients 
with ovarian, abdominal, heterotopic, and cornual 
 
ectopic pregnancy and compare them with cases of 
pathologic conditions of the uterus, fallopian tubes, 
 
and ovaries. Such OSE findings may enhance the initial 
diagnostic workup in emergent situations such as ectopic 
pregnancy and can potentially prove helpful in cases of 
ovarian, fallopian tube, and omental pregnancies, where 
diagnostic imaging results are typically insufficient and 
equivocal. Available osteopathic literature regarding 
 
somatic dysfunctions of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and 
ovaries are also reviewed. 
Methods
We conducted a prospective observational study from 
July 2015 through February 2016. All appropriate insti-
tutional approvals and patient informed consents were 
obtained for this case series before patient evaluation.

tional sac to the left of the uterine fundus surrounded by 
an asymmetric thin mantle of myometrium consistent 
with an ectopic pregnancy of the cornua.
 
In the operating room, the contents were consistent 
with the MR image—a large ectopic pregnancy was 
located in the left cornua of the uterus with a very thin 
wall. Once the uterus was exposed, the left cornual 
wall was so thin that slight manipulation of the uterus 
caused rupture of the uterine wall and spontaneous 
expulsion of the fetus. The remaining products of con-
ception were evacuated, a cornual wedge resection was 
performed, and the specimens were set aside for sub-
mission to the pathology department. The dermoid cyst 
was then removed. The rest of the pelvic structures 
appeared normal. The patient tolerated the remainder 
of the procedure well, and the rest of the hospital 
course was uneventful.
Case 2: Right Cornual Ectopic Pregnancy
A 33-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 12 weeks 
gestational age by last menstrual period presented to the 
emergency department by ambulance with complaints of 
syncope, vaginal bleeding, and severe abdominal pain. 
The patient denied any medical or surgical history. 
 
On evaluation, the patient was noted to be hypotensive 
(blood pressure around 90/60 mm Hg) and tachycardic 
(pulse rate, 135 beats/min). An OSE of the thoracic and 
lumbar spine and the sacrum revealed hypertonic para-
spinal muscles bilaterally at the T10-L2 spinal levels. No 
CRPs were identified. A TVUS showed gross free fluid 
in the pelvis. Given this patient’s hemodynamic insta-
bility, emergent diagnostic laparotomy was performed 
via Pfannenstiel incision.
 
In the operating room, the abdomen was entered and 
the uterus exposed. An ectopic pregnancy was seen in the 
ruptured right cornua of the uterus. A cornual wedge re-
section and partial right salpingectomy were performed, 
and the remaining products of conception and approxi-
mately 1500 mL of hemoperitoneum were evacuated. 
The rest of the pelvic structures appeared normal. The 
patient tolerated the remainder of the procedure well, and 
the rest of the hospital course was uneventful.
 
Osteopathic structural examination findings were 
correlated with findings on surgical exploration either 
through laparoscopy or laparotomy. Analysis was not 
performed beyond correlating preoperative OSE findings 
with surgical findings. 
 
A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, 
PubMed, Google Scholar, and The Journal of the Amer-
ican Osteopathic Association from 1900 to 2015 to as-
sess the literature regarding somatic dysfunctions of the 
uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.
Report of Cases
Six cases were included in the case series of ectopic preg-
nancies in uncommon locations. An additional case of a 
tubal ectopic pregnancy was included to distinguish findings 
from those of uncommon locations. The somatic dysfunc-
tion findings presented in this cases series are summarized 
 
in Table 1, and the CRPs and corresponding pathologic 
 
findings are described in Table 2 and shown in the Figure. 
Each case is described in the following paragraphs.
Case 1: Left Cornual Ectopic Pregnancy
Martingano et al9 presented a case of an intact cornual 
ectopic pregnancy that ruptured intraoperatively. The 
patient was a 29-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 
 
12 weeks gestational age by last menstrual period. She 
presented to the emergency department for evaluation of 
possible bicornuate uterus and ectopic pregnancy after 
routine ultrasonography. Her medical history was no-
table for 2 prior cesarean deliveries. The patient had no 
complaints of pain or discomfort at this time but did re-
port vaginal bleeding with slight fetal movement. An 
OSE was performed on the thoracic and lumbar spine 
and the sacrum, which revealed hypertonic paraspinal 
muscles bilaterally at the T10-L2 spinal levels. No CRPs 
were identified. A pelvic TVUS revealed the presence of 
a gestational sac and positive fetal heart tones with an 
uncertain location, either within the left fallopian tube 
proximal to the uterus or to the left of the uterine fundus. 
A magnetic resonance (MR) image of the pelvis without 
contrast showed a 4.6-cm eccentrically located gesta-

without skin pallor. An abdominal examination demon-
strated a tense, distended abdomen in all quadrants, with 
greater tenderness of the right lower quadrant than the 
left and rebound in both quadrants. Serum β-human cho-
rionic gonadotropin level was 3951 mIU/mL.
 
An OSE of the thoracic and lumbar spines, sacrum, 
and lower extremities revealed hypertonic paraspinal 
muscles on the right at the T10-T11 spinal levels. 
Chapman reflex points were identified at the tip of the 
transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra extending 
parallel with the iliac crest and on the right between the 
10th and 11th dorsal transverse space.
 
The patient was unable to tolerate a TVUS. An MR 
image revealed moderate fluid in the cul-de-sac with 
heterogeneity suggesting hemorrhagic components and 
an enlarged uterus with multiple fibroids. The largest fi-
broid was in the left side of the uterine body with a partial 
submucosal component, an exophytic subserosal fibroid 
Case 3: Heterotopic Ovarian Pregnancy
A 41-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 7 weeks ges-
tational age by egg implantation date confirmed by early 
sonogram presented to the emergency department with 
sudden-onset abdominal pain. The patient reported that 
she initially tried over-the-counter antacids, simethicone, 
and milk of magnesia without relief. The patient denied 
shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, vaginal 
bleeding, or constipation. She reported a medical history 
of fibroid uterus, irritable bowel syndrome, infertility for 
2 years, and 1 previous failed trial of in vitro fertilization. 
In this current pregnancy, the patient was attempting her 
second in vitro fertilization and taking progesterone sup-
positories twice per day and estradiol once daily. 
 
The patient’s surgical history included an ovarian cystec-
tomy 10 years prior. On physical examination, the patient 
was tachycardic (pulse rate, 102 beats/min), normoten-
sive (blood pressure, 126/81 mm Hg), afebrile, and

In the operating room, the abdomen was entered and 
insufflated and a camera was inserted to view the pelvic 
contents. Approximately 2000 mL of hemoperitoneum 
was evacuated. Both fallopian tubes and the right ovary 
appeared normal. The left ovary demonstrated a ruptured 
ovarian pregnancy. An ovarian wedge resection was per-
formed and electrocautery was used to obtain hemostasis 
in the remaining ovarian tissue. The fallopian tube and 
utero-ovarian ligament were identified and demonstrated 
to not be involved with the ectopic pregnancy. After the 
abdomen was closed, the copper IUD was removed. The 
remainder of the hospital course was uneventful.
Case 5: Primary Ovarian Pregnancy
A 22-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 11 weeks 
gestational age by last menstrual period presented to the 
emergency department by ambulance from an urgent 
was in the fundus, and smaller fibroids were seen within 
the uterine wall. An intrauterine pregnancy was identi-
fied. The left ovary was without abnormality, and the 
right ovary was difficult to visualize. A complete struc-
ture was identified in the right ovary. No normal ap-
pendix was seen. This patient subsequently underwent 
diagnostic laparoscopy. 
 
After entering the abdomen, inspection included the 
appendix, liver, gallbladder, uterus, fallopian tubes, and 
ovaries. Hemoperitoneum was noted in the abdominal 
cavity, and evacuation of 700 mL of blood was per-
formed. The patient’s right ovary had a hemorrhagic 
structure emanating from within. The subserosal fibroid 
seen on the MR image was additionally identified. Histo-
logic analysis confirmed the presence of chorionic villi 
within the ovarian tissue. The rest of the visible abnormal 
tissue was removed from the ovary via ovarian wedge 
resection and cauterized to achieve adequate hemostasis. 
The fallopian tube and utero-ovarian ligament were not 
involved with the ectopic pregnancy. The rest of the ab-
dominal structures appeared normal. The patient toler-
ated the procedure well and had an uneventful recovery. 
Case 4: Primary Ovarian Pregnancy
A 17-year-old female adolescent, gravida 1, para 0, at 9 
weeks gestational age by her last menstrual period pre-
sented to the emergency department by ambulance with 
complaints of vaginal bleeding and severe left lower 
quadrant pain. This patient’s medical history was notable 
for a copper intrauterine device (IUD) placed 3 years 
prior for contraception. The patient denied any surgical 
history. On physical examination, the patient was noted 
to be hypotensive (blood pressure around 90/50 mm Hg), 
afebrile, and tachycardic (pulse rate, 130 beats/min). An 
OSE was performed on the thoracic and lumbar spine 
and the sacrum, which revealed hypertonic paraspinal 
muscles on the left at the T10-T11 spinal levels. 
Chapman reflex points were identified on the right be-
tween the 10th and 11th dorsal transverse space. A TVUS 
was ordered, but the patient could not tolerate the exami-
nation. Given this patient’s clinical status, diagnostic 
laparoscopy was pursued.

spine of the ilium and at the spinous process of the fifth 
lumbar vertebra on the iliolumbar ligament. Images from 
TVUS revealed a moderate to large amount of complex 
fluid in the pelvis representing hemoperitoneum, an IUD 
in the endometrial cavity, and a ring-like structure with 
surrounding vascularity in the right ovary suggestive of 
a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Given these findings, diag-
nostic laparoscopy was pursued.
 
In the operating room, the abdomen was entered and 
insufflated and a camera was inserted to view the pelvic 
contents. Approximately 100 mL of hemoperitoneum 
was evacuated. The uterus, right fallopian tube, and both 
ovaries appeared normal. A ruptured left fallopian tube 
was identified and the entire fallopian tube was removed. 
After hemostasis was achieved, the abdomen was exited 
and the sites closed. The copper IUD was then removed. 
The patient tolerated the remainder of the procedure well 
and the rest of the hospital course was uneventful.
Case 7: Primary Omental Pregnancy
Martingano et al10 presented a case of a primary omental 
pregnancy that mimicked ovarian implantation: a 
23-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 9 weeks ges-
tational age by last menstrual period presented to the 
emergency department with complaints of severe ab-
dominal pain for the past 3 hours. She denied vaginal 
bleeding, nausea, and vomiting. Vital signs at the time 
of presentation were stable (blood pressure, 117/82 mm 
Hg; pulse rate, 88 beats/min); however, physical exami-
nation revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness, guarding, 
and signs of acute abdomen with increasing lethargy. 
An OSE of the thoracic and lumbar spines, rib cage, and 
sacrum revealed hypertonic paraspinal muscles bilater-
ally at the T9-T12 spinal levels. Chapman reflex points 
were identified anteriorly in the intercostal space be-
tween the 9th and 10th and the 10th and 11th ribs near 
the costochondral junction bilaterally, as well as poste-
riorly between the transverse processes of T9 and T10 
and T10 and T11 midway between the spinous pro-
cesses and the tips of the transverse processes.
 
A TVUS image revealed an endometrial stripe of 
 
8 mm, a large amount of complex fluid with internal 
care facility with complaints of severe right lower quad-
rant pain. Her medical history was unremarkable, and her 
surgical history was notable for an appendectomy 5 years 
prior. On physical examination, the patient was hypoten-
sive (blood pressure, 120/70 mm Hg), afebrile, and 
tachycardic (pulse rate, 128 beats/min). An OSE of the 
thoracic and lumbar spine and the sacrum revealed hy-
pertonic paraspinal muscles on the right at T10-T11 
spinal levels and CRPs on the right between the 10th and 
11th dorsal transverse space. The TVUS results from the 
patient’s previous care center suggested a ruptured tubal 
pregnancy. Given this patient’s clinical status, the deci-
sion was made to proceed to diagnostic laparoscopy.
 
In the operating room, the abdomen was entered and 
insufflated and a camera was inserted to view the pelvic 
contents. Approximately 2500 mL of hemoperitoneum 
was evacuated. Both fallopian tubes and the left ovary 
appeared normal. The right ovary demonstrated a ruptured 
ovarian pregnancy. An ovarian wedge resection was per-
formed, and electrocautery was used to obtain hemostasis 
in the remaining ovarian tissue. The fallopian tube and 
utero-ovarian ligament were identified and demonstrated 
to not be involved with the ectopic pregnancy. The patient 
tolerated the remainder of the procedure well and the rest 
of the hospital course was uneventful.
Case 6: Tubal Ectopic Pregnancy
A 35-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 10 weeks 
gestational age by last menstrual period presented to the 
emergency department with complaints of vaginal 
bleeding and severe left lower quadrant pain. The pa-
tient’s medical history was notable for a copper IUD 
placement 3 years prior for contraception. The patient’s 
surgical history was significant for 2 prior cesarean de-
liveries. On physical examination, this patient was tachy-
cardic (pulse rate, 110 beats/min), normotensive (blood 
pressure, 121/85 mm Hg), afebrile, and without skin 
pallor. An OSE of the thoracic and lumbar spines and 
sacrum revealed hypertonic paraspinal muscles on the 
left at the T10-L1 spinal levels. Chapman reflex points 
were identified midway between the acetabulum and the 
sciatic notch and between the posterior superior iliac

dominal cavity revealed no presence of abnormal 
tissue. The histopathologic report revealed focally 
hemorrhagic fibroadipose tissue, reactive lymph nodes, 
and products of conception consisting of immature 
chorionic villi in the supporting tissue. 
Cases of Normal First Pregnancy
Fifteen patients with normal first pregnancy underwent 
OSEs to identify any somatic dysfunctions or CRPs 
present (Table 3). Five patients were in their first tri-
mester of pregnancy, 5 in their second, and 5 in their 
third. Of the 15 patients, 3 had somatic dysfunctions and 
CRPs identified. The somatic dysfunctions identified 
were all present for pregnancies in the third trimester and 
corresponded to those of the uterus. The CRP that was 
identified in these cases was related to the broad liga-
ment, which likely resulted from irritation caused by the 
term gravid uterus.
echoes around the uterus and both ovaries (most likely 
representing hemoperitoneum), as well as a 0.5-cm left 
adnexal cystic structure with focal increased vascularity. 
An ectopic pregnancy of the left fallopian tube was sus-
pected. Findings were highly suggestive of a ruptured 
ectopic pregnancy, and the patient was taken to the oper-
ating room for an emergent laparotomy.
 
Intraoperative findings were notable for 1500 mL of 
hemoperitoneum. Examination revealed a normal 
uterus with intact ovaries, ligaments, and fallopian 
tubes. Further inspection of the abdomen revealed a 
brownish-red encapsulated soft nodular tissue easily 
palpated and clearly seen on the left side of the 
omentum. The gestational sac was identified with sur-
rounding blood clots, and a left partial omentectomy 
was performed with a wide omental excision technique 
to avoid leaving trophoblastic tissue behind. Examina-
tion of the remaining contents of the pelvis and ab-

dysfunctions after the operation all had segmental find-
ings corresponding to the uterus, which is likely a result 
of their recent pregnancy. The 1 CRP identified corre-
sponded to the broad ligament, which is also likely a re-
sult of the recent pregnancy and gravid uterus irritating 
the broad ligament. Immediately postoperatively, so-
matic dysfunctions and CRPs identified corresponded to 
the fallopian tubes. All preoperative and postoperative 
somatic dysfunction and CRP findings were not present

onstrated CRPs corresponding to the broad ligament

Each patient, who had no previous adnexal surgery or pathologic finding (either prior or present) and who underwent elective postpartum bilateral  
tubal ligation received an osteopathic structural examination to identify somatic dysfunction and Chapman reflex points (CRPs) before, immediately  
after, and 2 weeks after the surgical procedure. One CRP was identified preoperatively corresponding to the broad ligament. Three patients  
demonstrated a CRP immediately postoperatively corresponding to the fallopian tubes. No CRPs were identified 2 weeks postoperatively.

Where ovarian cysts are present, if treatment is first 
started 15 days prior to the next menstrual period, 
employing short, decisive treatment at each visit, the 
reaction induced by this procedure, will sometimes 
cause the cyst to completely drain during the 
menstrual flow.8(pp76-77) 
 
Burns18-20 extensively researched and developed 
the concept of somatic dysfunction. Specifically re-
lating to her work on the pelvic viscera, she studied 
animals in various stages of pregnancy and showed 
that electrical stimulation of the uterine cervix caused 
muscular contractions near the lumbosacral joint, 
whereas electrical stimulation of the body of the 
uterus caused contraction of the muscles near the 
second lumbar vertebra.
 
Regarding the cornual ectopic pregnancies, neither 
case was shown to be associated with CRPs, but both 
demonstrated somatic dysfunctions at T10-L2. For the 
heterotopic ovarian pregnancy, CRPs were identified 
posteriorly and were associated with uterine fibroma 
and the outer half of the ovary. Somatic dysfunctions 
were located at T10-T12 as well as at L1-L2, which 
likely represent the ovary and the uterus given the 
pathologic findings of both organs. Early pregnancy 
itself is unlikely to affect the somatic dysfunctions 
present because it was characteristically absent in the 
cases of an otherwise normal pregnancy of the first 
and second trimesters. In the third trimester, however, 
somatic dysfunctions and CRPs were identified at the 
uterus and broad ligament. Findings in the third tri-
mester are unlikely to pose a confounding presenta-
tion of normal pregnancies and ectopic pregnancies, 
considering that ectopic pregnancies are usually re-
stricted to the first trimester of pregnancy, during 
which no somatic dysfunctions or CRPs were demon-
strated for normal first pregnancy in the current report, 
and they very rarely progress into the third trimester. 
For ovarian pregnancies, CRPs were identified poste-
riorly corresponding to the outer ovary. Regarding the 
omental pregnancy, CRPs were identified anteriorly 
and posteriorly, representing the ileum and jejunum 
irritation from the ectopic location on the omentum 
Cases of Simple Ovarian Cysts
Fifteen cases of patients with simple ovarian cysts under-
went an OSE to identify any somatic dysfunctions and 
CRPs. Five patients had cysts on the left ovary, 5 on the 
right, and 5 bilaterally. Six patients presented with ad-
nexal pain, and the others were asymptomatic. One pa-
tient with an 8-cm left simple ovarian cyst demonstrated 
somatic dysfunction (at the T10-T11 spinal levels) and a 
CRP (at the outer ovary, posterior). This patient pre-
sented with adnexal pain and had the largest ovarian cyst 
(8 cm) of the 15 patients evaluated (other patients, range 
1.5-6 cm). Thus, it appears that VSRs and CRPs may be 
present only if these cysts reach a certain size or cause 
sufficient congestion. 
Discussion
Osteopathic concepts in ectopic pregnancy have not 
been well studied, and currently no literature is avail-
able, to our knowledge, regarding CRPs in this set-
ting. Moreover, these concepts have not been 
described in the setting of ectopic pregnancies outside 
the fallopian tubes. Additionally, somatic dysfunction 
and CRP findings in related conditions of the uterus, 
fallopian tubes, and ovaries are not well described. 
Smutny et al7 state that OMT is contraindicated in ec-
topic pregnancies given that they are surgical emer-
gencies. Nevertheless, this view does not preclude the 
use of an OSE as part of the initial physical examina-
tion and diagnostic approach. 
 
Based on the literature search conducted, only 1 re-
port describing somatic dysfunctions and ectopic preg-
nancy was identified. Woods11 demonstrated somatic 
dysfunctions at T10-L1 in the case of a ruptured left 
tubal ectopic pregnancy. A review by Beal12 revealed 
that somatic dysfunctions of the uterus, fallopian tubes, 
and ovaries have been found, typically at spinal levels 
T12-L1, T10-L1, and T9-L1, respectively, on average, 
with the more common locations being T10-L1, T10-
L1, and T10-T11, respectively.7,13-17 Based on Chap-
man’s work (as cited by Owens), ovarian cysts are 
recognized to cause CRPs:

locations where diagnostic imaging results are insuf-
ficient or equivocal. Such information allows the 
osteopathic physician to better prepare for treatment 
approaches, which in the cases of ruptured ectopic 
pregnancies is surgical. 
Limitations
Because this report is a case series and thus has a lim-
ited sample size, the conclusions are limited. It is pos-
sible that the somatic dysfunctions identified resulted 
from somatovisceral interactions rather than somatic 
dysfunctions. This consideration is based on the work 
done by Johnston21—namely, the somatic dysfunction 
and segmental alterations identified during the OSE 
were from somatic rather than visceral origin. It is pos-
sible that the somatic dysfunctions found on OSE at the 
thoracolumbar junction are somatosomatic findings re-
lated to associated dysfunctions found both superiorly 
and inferiorly in the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine 
regions. This cause is less likely in the cases of ectopic 
pregnancies, tubal ligations, and simple cysts but may 
be a factor in cases of term pregnancies where the 
gravid uterus causes great challenges to the lumbar 
spine and thoracic spine. 
 
A randomized controlled trial of ectopic pregnan-
cies and OSE findings would prove difficult given the 
emergent nature of the condition. Although CRPs were 
reevaluated and described, because of the urgent na-
ture and emotional aftermath of ectopic pregnancies 
and other gynecologic operations, reassessing the 
 
patient with a full OSE proved to be difficult and con-
sequently was not done.  This is a gross limitation of 
this study. In future studies, it is imperative that com-
plete, focused OSEs are used to reassess each patient 
after surgery to determine if the somatic dysfunctions 
located before surgery were indeed absent after the 
specific elements of the ectopic pregnancy were re-
sected. This assessment would confirm that the somatic 
dysfunction of interest was directly related to the 
pathologic finding. Further studies are required to 
firmly establish reliable and reproducible OSE findings 
for these and related conditions. 
affecting the small intestine. It is likely that the hemo-
peritoneum itself was causing these CRPs because the 
previous cases presented also had hemoperitoneum 
and these CRPs were not additionally identified. In 
this case, somatic dysfunctions were present from T9-
T12. Regarding the tubal pregnancy, CRPs were iden-
tified anteriorly and posteriorly corresponding to the 
fallopian tube. The somatic dysfunctions were found 
at T10-L1 and are consistent with previous studies.
 
From this case series, several conclusions can be 
drawn. Despite the variations of ectopic pregnancy loca-
tions, somatic dysfunctions were consistently identified 
at T10-L2, and this finding is absent when compared 
with otherwise normal first pregnancies in the first and 
second trimesters. For ectopic pregnancies of the ovary, 
it appears that when a CRP is identified, it usually corre-
sponds to only the outer half of the ovary where the 
pregnancy had actually ruptured. It is unknown if an in-
tact ovarian pregnancy of the inner half would have the 
same CRP identified. Hemoperitoneum on its own is not 
likely to be the main cause of CRPs or somatic dysfunc-
tions given the variations of these components in the 
different cases presented and that all but 1 case had he-
moperitoneum. Cornual ectopic pregnancies do not ap-
pear to elicit CRPs, unlike pregnancies of the fallopian 
tube, ovary, and omentum. The somatic dysfunction and 
CRP findings present in ectopic pregnancies of un-
common locations are not likely to be confounded by 
other conditions of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ova-
ries as evidenced by the findings presented for otherwise 
normal pregnancies, elective bilateral tubal ligation, and 
simple ovarian cysts.
 
The OSE findings described in this case series are 
important because they enhance the initial diagnostic 
workup, which is essential in emergent situations 
like ectopic pregnancies, where prompt intervention 
is necessary and concrete diagnostic information is 
unavailable. The OSE findings demonstrated in 
these cases correctly aided in the final diagnosis and 
thus can potentially prove helpful in cases of 
ovarian, fallopian tube, and omental pregnancies to 
provide clues to ectopic pregnancy of uncommon

Conclusion
While the majority of ectopic pregnancies commonly en-
countered in clinical practice are located within the fallo-
pian tubes, ectopic pregnancies of uncommon locations 
can occur. The OSE findings described in this case series 
are important because they enhance the initial diagnostic 
workup, which is essential in emergent situations like ec-
topic pregnancies and can potentially prove helpful in 
cases of ovarian, fallopian tube, and omental pregnancies 
to provide clues to abnormal ectopic pregnancy locations 
where diagnostic imaging results are insufficient and often 
equivocal. Although OMT is contraindicated in ectopic 
pregnancies, it does not preclude the use of an OSE as part 
of the initial physical examination and diagnostic ap-
proach. Related disorders of the uterus, fallopian tubes, 
and ovaries, specifically in otherwise normal pregnancies, 
elective bilateral tubal ligation, and simple ovarian cysts, 
do not appear to consistently present with similar somatic 
dysfunctions and CRPs and thus are not likely to confound 
findings present in ectopic pregnancies of uncommon lo-
cations. Further studies are required to firmly establish 
reliable and reproducible OSE findings for these condi-
tions in a larger population and among different pathologic 
conditions of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.
