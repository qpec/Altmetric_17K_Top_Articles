Abstract
The hippocampus provides the brain’s memory system with a subset of neurons holding a map-
like representation of each environment experienced. We found in mice that optogenetic-silencing 
those neurons active in an environment unmasked a subset of quiet neurons, enabling the 
emergence of an alternative map. This intervention applied in a cocaine-paired environment 
neutralized an otherwise long-lasting drug-place preference, showing that recoding a spatial 
memory engram can alleviate associated maladaptive behavior.
Memory is central to behavior, enabling individuals to respond to their environment using 
past experiences1. The spatially-tuned and temporally-coordinated activity of hippocampal 
CA1 principal cells contributes to adaptive memories by providing the brain with neuronal 
engrams that represent the spatial context of life events2–5. Nonetheless, the recall of certain 
representations, such as those associating an environment with a drug of abuse, can impair 
the individual’s ability to make adaptive choices, including an uncontrolled drive to revisit 
drug-paired locations6. Manipulating hippocampal neuronal representations could redress 
undesirable spatio-contextual behaviors. However, a given hippocampal ‘place cell’ can 
contribute not to one but to multiple representations4,7–12. Therefore, it remains unknown 
how the hippocampal neuronal representation of a particular place could be selectively 
edited. In a given environment the hippocampus exhibits, alongside the active place cells, a 
subset of quiet neurons without clear spatial selectivity3,9,12–17. Here, we used a c-fos-based 
optogenetic approach to silence hippocampal neurons active in a particular environment and 
examined whether quiet neurons could implement an alternative representation that 
neutralizes a drug-place memory.

 To label and manipulate hippocampal neurons recruited during exploration of an 
environment, we bilaterally injected the dorsal CA1 of c-fos-tTA transgenic mice with a 
TRE3G-ArchT-GFP viral construct (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). In these c-
fos::ArchT mice neuronal activation leads to the expression of the tetracycline transactivator 
(tTA) through the promoter of the c-fos immediate early gene. The transient removal of 
doxycycline (Dox) from the mouse diet enables the tTA to interact with the tetracycline-
responsive element (TRE3G), thereby tagging active neurons with the light-driven silencer 
Archaerhodopsin-T (ArchT). To test this tagging procedure, a first group of mice explored a 
circular-walled enclosure (the ‘circle’) while transiently off Dox (Fig. 1b). In these ‘tagged 
mice’, 6.28±0.38% of neurons in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer expressed ArchT-GFP of 
which 99.70±0.10% were pyramidal cells (‘tagged neurons’; Fig. 1c; n=4 mice). This 
neuronal tagging lasted at least six days (n=2 mice; Supplementary Fig. 1b) and was 
virtually absent in c-fos::ArchT control mice (n=3) always fed on Dox (0.09%±0.02%, 
P<0.001 tagged versus control; Fig. 1a-c).
We next optogenetically silenced ArchT-GFP-tagged neurons while monitoring CA1 
ensemble activity from c-fos::ArchT tagged mice (n=5; Fig. 1a,b). Tagged mice were 
transiently taken off Dox to tag CA1 neurons in the circle (Fig. 1b; Day 0), and recordings 
were performed on the following days during re-exposure to the circle with CA1 light-
delivery (561nm, 30s-light-ON pulses with 70s-light-OFF intervals; Fig. 1b). We found that 
ArchT photo-silencing significantly decreased the firing rate of 133 neurons (‘putative 
tagged neurons’; OFF=1.08±0.08Hz, ON=0.06±0.005Hz) out of the 1,083 principal neurons 
recorded (range: 161–231 daily recorded neurons over 6 days) while increasing the firing 
rate of 332 neurons (‘alternative neurons’; OFF=0.84±0.04Hz, ON=1.97±0.08Hz; Fig. 1d,e 
and Supplementary Fig. 2). The activity of the remaining 618 neurons was not significantly 
altered (‘unchanged neurons’; Fig. 1d,e; OFF=0.70±0.04Hz, ON=0.78±0.04Hz). We did not 
observe such a light-induced firing switch amongst the 358 CA1 principal neurons recorded 
from c-fos::ArchT control mice continuously fed on Dox (n=2; Fig. 1b and Supplementary 
Fig. 2a,b).
We then sought to identify functional differences between tagged and alternative neurons. 
We found that the baseline (light-OFF) firing rate of alternative neurons was initially lower 
in the circle than that of tagged and unchanged neurons (Days 1–2; Fig. 2a and 
Supplementary Fig. 2d,e). In contrast, their firing rate matched that of the tagged and 
unchanged neurons during exploration of a square-walled enclosure mice also experienced 
each day (the ‘square’; Supplementary Fig. 2d,e). This suggests that the preferred 
recruitment of a selected subset of neurons in a given environment is associated with tight 
inhibitory control over other principal cells18. Accordingly, the photo-evoked switch in 
activity of tagged and alternative neurons (Fig. 1e) was accompanied by a fine redistribution 
of interneuron firing activity, without a change in the interneuron population mean rate 
(n=189 interneurons recorded; Supplementary Figure 3).
During the following days, the baseline (light-OFF) activity of alternative neurons increased 
in the circle while that of tagged neurons concomitantly decreased (Fig. 2a), as revealed by 
the slope of the linear regression (firing rate = β0 + β1 × days; with β1 = 0.15 and −0.19 for 
alternative and tagged neurons, respectively; both Ps<0.00001). In these tagged mice, there

 was no similar rate shift of light-unresponsive neurons in the circle (‘unchanged neurons’, 
Supplementary Fig. 4a,b), nor for tagged and alternative neurons in the square (both 
Ps>0.19). Moreover, no shift in neuronal activity was observed in c-fos::ArchT tagged mice 
exploring the circle without CA1 light-delivery (n=3; Supplementary Fig. 4c,d). Thus, the 
repetitive photo-silencing of neuronal activity in the circle, but not context re-exposure per 
se, caused the tagged/alternative firing rate shift.
We next computed place firing rate maps in light-OFF and light-ON epochs. During the first 
days of re-exposure to the circle, tagged neurons but not alternative neurons exhibited clear 
light-OFF spatial firing fields (Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Fig. 5). While light-delivery 
strongly disrupted the place fields of tagged neurons, it simultaneously led to the emergence 
of spatially-structured firing of alternative neurons (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Figs. 5b,c 
and 6). This photo-evoked switch from one hippocampal map to another was not observed in 
c-fos::ArchT control mice (Supplementary Figs. 7,8), ruling out non-specific remapping 
caused by light-delivery. Moreover, the hippocampal map photo-switch was associated with 
a transient increase in locomotor reactivity which diminished over the following days of 
light-delivery, suggesting that the expression of the alternative representation caused tagged 
mice to initially treat the circle as a new enclosure (Supplementary Fig. 8). Interestingly, 
concurrent with this behavioral shift the baseline spatial tuning of the alternative neurons 
increased while that of tagged neurons decreased (Fig. 2b,d and Supplementary Figs. 5,6; 
with β1 = 0.08 and −0.07, respectively; both Ps<0.00001), but no such change was observed 
in light-unresponsive neurons (Supplementary Fig. 4b).
Information processing in cortical circuits is thought to rely on spiking activity coordinated 
over short-intervals in distributed groups of neurons forming assemblies5. We tested whether 
our intervention changed the contribution of tagged and alternative neurons to the temporal 
expression of hippocampal assemblies. We detected significant assembly-patterns from the 
co-fluctuation of (light-OFF) neuronal discharges in 25-ms windows, and described them by 
weight vectors representing the contribution of each neuron to each assembly-pattern (Fig. 
2e and Supplementary Fig. 9a-f). We found that while tagged neurons predominantly 
contributed to assembly-pattern expression in the first 3-day block, this was reversed in the 
next 3-day block which was marked by the dominant contribution of their alternative peers 
(Fig. 2f) without a change in the average strength of assembly-activations (Supplementary 
Fig. 9g,h).
We finally investigated whether recoding a hippocampal map could reset the memory of an 
environment in which a drug had been previously experienced. Drugs of abuse, through their 
association with environmental cues and contexts, produce powerful and long-lasting 
memories that precipitate relapse6. Concordantly, we found that more CA1 neurons recruited 
in a cocaine-paired environment were re-activated during drug-free re-exposure to that 
environment than for a saline-paired environment (Supplementary Fig. 10). We thus tested 
whether our optogenetic intervention could revoke the memory of a cocaine-paired 
environment. We trained mice in a conditioned place preference task to learn the association 
of one compartment with cocaine and the other with saline, such that they expressed a 
cocaine-place preference (Fig. 3, Test 1). This cocaine-place association was long-lasting for 
both c-fos::ArchT control mice (n=8) and wild-type control littermates (n=8) (Fig. 3, Test 2).

 However, c-fos::ArchT tagged mice (n=13) no longer exhibited a cocaine-place preference 
(Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 11) after the repetitive CA1 photo-silencing in the cocaine-
paired compartment had shifted neuronal activity from the tagged to the alternative subset 
(Supplementary Fig. 11c). The cocaine-place preference of tagged mice could not be 
reinstated in response to cocaine-priming injection, suggesting that the shift to the 
alternative hippocampal map had neutralized the cocaine-place memory (Supplementary 
Fig. 11d). However, both tagged and control mice were able to express a place preference 
for a never before experienced compartment (Supplementary Fig. 11e,f). We therefore 
propose that in tagged mice the absence of spatial preference after hippocampal map 
recoding indicates that the compartment previously paired with cocaine was no longer 
associated with the drug experience and yet was perceived as familiar again.
Previous studies using c-fos-based optogenetic technology have influenced the behavioral 
output of a spatio-contextual memory by altering the interaction the hippocampus has with 
extra-hippocampal circuits that attach valence to context19,20. In this study, we report an 
alternative approach that directly changes the hippocampal ensemble representation of a 
spatial context by disengaging the initially recruited neurons while enabling previously quiet 
neurons to emerge and provide an alternative representation. Drug-paired spatio-contextual 
memories increase the propensity for relapse in cocaine users and prompt drug-seeking 
behavior in laboratory rodents6. Here, our approach for editing the hippocampal ensemble 
representing an environment associated with cocaine was able to revoke drug-induced spatial 
preference in mice. In contrast with regular extinction, the neutralizing effect of this 
intervention was not overturned by a priming cocaine experience. Together, our data 
demonstrate that recoding a selective hippocampal engram represents a potent strategy to 
reset spatial memories and neutralize maladaptive behavior.
ONLINE METHODS
Subjects
c-fos-tTA animals were adult transgenic mice heterozygous for the transgene carrying the c-
fos promoter-driven tetracycline transactivator (tTA)21. Mice were bred from c-fos-tTA mice 
crossed with C57Bl6/J mice, and housed with their littermates until used in the experimental 
procedure. Food containing doxycycline (the “regular Dox”; 40mg/kg Dox chow; Bio-Serv) 
was provided for at least two weeks before the injection surgery. c-fos-tTA-LacZ animals22 
were adult male double transgenic mice carrying the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) 
transgene under the control of the c-fos promoter, as well as a second transgene linking the 
tetO promoter to the tau-LacZ reporter and the tetracycline transactivator mutant tTAH100Z 
(tTA*) in order to maintain the tetO-linked gene expression after the initial neuronal 
activation. In the absence of doxycycline the active tetO promoter forms a positive feedback 
loop with tTA* that then becomes doxycycline insensitive. The c-fos-tTA-LacZ mice were 
backcrossed to a C57Bl6/J background and were raised on food with regular Dox. These two 
c-fos-tTA mouse lines were generated at The Scripps Research Institute and maintained at 
Tufts University until shipment to the MRC BNDU at the University of Oxford. Mice had 
free access to food and water ad libitum in a dedicated housing room with a 12/12h light/
dark cycle (7am-7pm). Behavioral experiments were performed during daylight. All

 experiments involving animals were conducted according to the UK Animals (Scientific 
Procedures) Act 1986 under personal and project licenses issued by the Home Office 
following ethical review.
Viral construct cloning, packaging and testing
The pAAV-TRE3G-ArchT-GFP plasmid was constructed using the pAAV-CamKII-ArchT-
GFP backbone vector (Addgene plasmid # 37807)23 where the original CamKII promoter 
was substituted, using PacI and the BamHI restriction enzymes recognition sites, with the 
third generation of tetracycline responsive element containing promoter (TRE3G, Clontech 
Laboratories, Inc.). The recombinant AAV vector was serotyped and packaged with AAV2 
coat proteins (University of North Carolina). Dox-controlled transcriptional activation of 
ArchT-GFP expression was first assessed in cultured HEK-293 cells (Supplementary Fig. 
1a) co-transfected with a pTet-DualOFF vector (Clontech Laboratories Inc.; IRES2-
ZsGreen1 cassette removed using EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites followed by Klenow 
fragment blunting and self-ligation of the vector). The ArchT-GFP expression was assessed 
in c-fos-tTA mice injected in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus with the TRE3G-
ArchT-GFP viral construct while under regular Dox (n=9 mice, Supplementary Fig. 1b). 
One month post injection, these c-fos::ArchT mice explored a circular-walled environment 
(the “circle”, 43cm diameter, 26cm height) while either off Dox (“tagged mice”, n=6; Dox 
removed from food diet three days before) or on Dox (“control mice”, n=3). Both groups 
were put on food containing a high dose of Dox (1g/kg) immediately after exploration of the 
circle in order to block any further neuronal tagging and were returned to a regular Dox diet 
the following day. The mice were perfused three or six days later and their brain was 
extracted for immunohistochemistry procedures.
Surgical procedures
c-fos-tTA mice were bilaterally injected and implanted under deep anesthesia and 
analgesia24. TRE3G-ArchT-GFP viral vector injections (2×450nl for each side) were 
performed bilaterally in the dorsal CA1 using stereotaxic coordinates (−1.6mm and −2.4mm 
anteroposterior, ±1.7mm lateral from bregma and −1.1mm ventral from the brain surface). 
The viral vector was delivered at a rate of 100nl/min using a glass micropipette24. After two 
weeks of recovery mice were implanted with a ten-independently movable tetrode 
microdrive combined with two optic fibers (Doric lenses, Québec, Canada) targeting the 
dorsal CA1 bilaterally24.
Recording procedures
Following the implant surgery, mice recovered for at least one week before familiarization to 
the recording procedure commenced. Mice were handled 5–10 minutes in a dedicated towel, 
twice a day, and connected to the recording system for 1–2h a day for at least a week. 
During this time, tetrodes were gradually lowered towards the pyramidal cell layer. All cell 
ensemble recordings were performed from the CA1 hippocampus of adult male mice. On 
recording days, each morning tetrodes were lowered into the pyramidal cell layer in search 
of multi-unit spiking activity as previously described24. All recordings were performed 
under dim light conditions (20–40lux) with no rewards provided. At the end of each 
recording day, tetrodes were raised to avoid damaging the pyramidal cell layer overnight.

 The primary recordings completed in this study were from drug-free c-fos::ArchT tagged 
mice exploring the circle paired with CA1 light-delivery (see below) and a square-walled 
enclosure (the “square”, 46cm×46cm×38cm; ~30min) without light-delivery (n=5 tagged 
“light-IN” mice). Wooden pieces were added on some of the square walls on each day to 
make it novel. In these drug-free experiments recordings were also performed from two 
control groups. The first control group consisted of c-fos::ArchT control (non-tagged) mice 
exploring the circle paired with light-delivery and the square without light-delivery (n=2 
control “light-IN” mice) and the second control group consisted of c-fos::ArchT tagged mice 
exploring the circle without light-delivery and the square with light-delivery (n=3 tagged 
“light-OUT” mice). The purpose of light-delivery in tagged light-OUT mice was to allow the 
identification of tagged and alternative neurons without affecting their activity during re-
exposure to the circle. Locomotor behavior of tagged light-IN mice was similar to that of 
both non-tagged light-IN and tagged light-OUT mice in the circle during baseline condition 
(distance travelled = 110.54±7.90m, 103.23±5.78m and 113.19±3.01m, respectively; animal 
speed = 5.26±0.38, 4.91±0.27 and 5.39±0.14; P=0.78). CA1 light-delivery in tagged light-IN 
mice was however initially associated with an increased locomotor reactivity, indicative of a 
behavioral novelty response to the expression of the alternative hippocampal map (see 
Supplementary Figure 8). In experiments involving cocaine, recordings were performed in 
mice (n=4 on C57Bl6 background) exploring an enclosure paired with a saline 
administration (0.9% saline, i.p) followed by the exploration of another enclosure paired 
with a cocaine administration (10mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma) (Supplementary Figure 11a). 
Additionally, in order to determine whether the shift in neuronal activity caused by the 
repetitive photo-silencing in the drug-free circle enclosure (Figure 2) also occurred in a 
cocaine-paired environment recordings were performed in c-fos::ArchT tagged mice (n=2) 
during the conditioned place preference task (Supplementary Figure 11c).
Doxycycline treatment
Tagged, but not control, c-fos::ArchT mice were taken off regular Dox three days before the 
tagging day (Day 0), a period during which familiarization to the recording procedure was 
temporarily discontinued for both tagged and control mice. On the tagging day of the drug-
free open-field experiment both tagged and control c-fos::ArchT mice explored the circle for 
45min. For the CPP experiment, the least preferred enclosure was identified for each mouse 
during the pre-test and that enclosure was paired with cocaine and explored for 45min on the 
tagging day (see Conditioned place preference section below). All mice went back to their 
home cage immediately after the tagging and were fed with high dose of Dox. The following 
day mice returned to the regular Dox diet.
Multichannel data acquisition
The signals from the electrodes were buffered on the head of the animal (unity gain op-
amps, Axona Ltd, www.axona.com) and transmitted over a single strand of litz wire to a 
dual stage amplifier and band pass filter (gain 1000, pass band 0.1Hz to 5kHz; Sensorium 
Inc., Charlotte, VT)24, or (in a second setup) the electrode signals were amplified, 
multiplexed, and digitized using a single integrated circuit located on the head of the animal 
(RHD2164, Intan Technologies, Los Angeles; pass band 0.09Hz to 7.60kHz). The amplified 
and filtered electrophysiological signals were digitized at 20kHz and saved to disk along

 with the synchronization signals from the position tracking and the laser activation. In order 
to track the location of the animal three LED clusters were attached to the electrode casing 
and captured at 25 frames per second by an overhead color camera.
CA1 light-delivery
A 561nm diode pumped solid state laser (Laser 2000, Ringstead, UK) was used to deliver 
light to the dorsal CA1 (~15mW) of c-fos::ArchT tagged and control mice through two 
lengths of optic fiber and a rotary joint with splitter (Doric Lenses, Québec, Canada)24. For 
the drug-free open-field experiment, light was delivered in the circle (“light-IN”) using 
trains of 30 pulses 30s in duration (“light-ON”) with 70s between pulses (“light-OFF”). As 
these experiments relied on the propensity of the mice to spontaneously explore, this light-
delivery protocol was chosen to ensure the mice evenly covered the circle in both light-OFF 
and light-ON epochs (i.e., ~35min and 15min total exploration, respectively). CA1 photo-
silencing was also performed in c-fos::ArchT tagged mice during the exploration of the 
square, i.e. after that of the circle (“light-OUT”; 1s light pulses with 9s between pulses), in 
order to optogenetically identify tagged and alternative neurons. For the CPP experiment, 
trains of 30 light pulses of 30s duration were delivered during the 20 minute re-exposure 
sessions to the cocaine-paired enclosure. A 20-minute re-exposure session with light-
delivery was used per day in the CPP experiment in order to prevent possible drug-
conditioned memory extinction due to prolonged and non-reinforced context re-exposure to 
the cocaine-conditioned enclosure. Thus, shorter light-OFF (10s) intervals were used to 
preserve a total of 15-minute CA1 light-delivery.
Spike detection and unit isolation
The recorded signals were digitally band pass filtered (800Hz to 5kHz) offline for spike 
detection and unit isolation. Spikes were detected using a threshold in the RMS power 
(0.2ms sliding window) of the filtered signal. Unit isolation was performed on the first 
principal components calculated for each channel recorded by the tetrode in question. This 
was achieved by automatic over clustering to up to 100 clusters (KlustaKwik, klusta-
team.github.com) followed by graphically-based manual recombination and further isolation 
informed by cloud shape in principal component space, cross-channel spike waveforms, 
auto-correlation histograms and cross-correlation histograms24–26. All sessions recorded on 
a given day were concatenated and cluster cut together to monitor cells throughout the day. 
Only well-isolated and stable units over the entire day were used for analysis24 and 
hippocampal principal cells and interneurons were identified by their auto-correlogram, 
firing rate and spike waveform as described before25. Firing probabilities relative to theta 
oscillations and SWR events25 were used to classify interneurons as established 
elsewhere27–29. A total of 1,083 principal cells (from Day 1 to 6: n=200, 161, 189, 139, 163 
and 231, of which 28, 17, 18, 18, 22 and 30 tagged neurons; 62, 65, 71, 30, 25 and 79 
alternative neurons; 110, 79, 100, 91, 116 and 122 unchanged neurons) and 189 interneurons 
were isolated from the CA1 hippocampus recordings of c-fos::ArchT light-IN tagged mice 
during drug-free exploration of open-field enclosures. The number of cells isolated from the 
other recordings is indicated where appropriate.

 Identification of tagged and alternative neurons
Light-modulation of neuronal discharge was identified by calculating, for each neuron, the 
spike discharge across one-second time bins relative to light pulse onsets. The mean firing 
probability across bins during light-delivery was then compared to the mean across light-
OFF bins. Neurons with a light-ON firing probability more than two standard deviations 
outside the light-OFF value were deemed to exhibit a significant light response. Neurons 
that were significantly photo-silenced were classified as ‘putative’ tagged neurons while 
those exhibiting a significant rate increase were classified as alternative neurons. Light-
response scores (light-ON versus light-OFF firing rate difference over their sum) of tagged 
neurons and those of alternative neurons both had unimodal distributions (both Ps>0.76, 
Hartigan’s Dip test; mean±s.e.m rate score: −0.82±0.01 and 0.44±0.01, respectively). 
Neurons with no light-modulated activity were grouped together as “unchanged neurons”.
Spatial rate maps
The horizontal plane of the recording arena was divided into bins of approximately 2×2cm 
to generate spike count maps (number of spikes fired in each bin) for each unit and an 
occupancy map (time spent by the animal in each bin). All maps were then smoothed by 
convolution with a two-dimensional Gaussian kernel having standard deviation equal to one 
bin width. Finally, spatial rate maps were generated by normalizing the smoothed spike 
count maps by the smoothed occupancy map. Spatial coherence was calculated from the 
unsmoothed place rate maps; it reflects the similarity of the firing rate in adjacent bins, and 
is the z-transform of the Pearson correlation (across all bins) between the rate in a bin and 
the average rate of its eight nearest neighbors30,31. The inter-quartile range in spatial 
coherence of the population was 0.49–0.74. The population map similarity (Supplementary 
Figure 8d) was measured as previously described24,30,32. It compares all the place maps 
from two different time periods in a pairwise fashion and represents the degree to which 
cells that fired in similar regions of space (i.e., overlapping place fields) in one time period 
still fire in similar regions in the other time period. It is calculated by first computing the 
place field similarity (PFS) value for each cell pair during the first time period as the 
Pearson correlation coefficient from the direct bin wise comparisons between the spatial rate 
maps of the two cells limited to valid bins (occupancy greater than zero). This is repeated for 
the second time period and the population map similarity between the two time periods is 
calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the PFS values from each of the 
time periods.
Principal cell assembly-patterns
To quantify the extent to which hippocampal principal cells contribute to the formation of 
neuronal assemblies by synchronizing their firing activity with peer neurons, significant co-
firing patterns were detected using an unsupervised statistical method based on independent 
component analysis (ICA) (Figure 2e,f and Supplementary Fig. 9)33. Light-OFF epochs 
during exploration of the circle were divided into 25ms time-bins34, and for every principal 
cell the number of spikes per bin was counted. Time windows matching theta-band (4–
12Hz) oscillatory waves (~100ms) were also used as they represent another natural temporal 
division for the expression of hippocampal cell assemblies (Supplementary Fig. 9f). In order

 to restrict the analysis to the temporal coordination of spiking activity without bias due to 
differences in the average firing rates, the binned spike-counts were normalized for each 
neuron by a z-score transform:
where for neuron i, Zi,b is its z-scored spike-count in bin b, xi,b its spike-count in bin b, μxi 
its mean spike-count across all bins and σxi the standard deviation of its spike-counts. This 
set each neuron to have a null mean rate with unitary variance. With the number of principal 
cells denoted by n and the number of time-bins denoted by B, let Z be the n × B binned and 
z-scored spike-count matrix with element (i, b) equal to zi,b. From this matrix Z assembly-
patterns were identified in two steps: (1) the number of significant patterns in the data was 
estimated based on random matrix theory, after which (2) the corresponding number of 
assembly-patterns was extracted using ICA. Note that here a “pattern” is described by a 
weight vector over the n principal cells recorded that day. In the dataset used here the 
average number of principal cells was 30.11±2.51 per recording day.
Determination of the number of significant assembly-patterns—A principal 
component analysis was first applied to matrix Z. The pairwise correlation matrix of Z is 
given by 
 (where ZT is the transpose of Z) and the eigenvalue-decomposition of C 
is given by:
where λj is the jth eigenvalue of C and pj its corresponding eigenvector (i.e., principal 
component of Z) (for j = 1, … , n). To estimate the number of significant patterns embedded 
within Z, the Marčenko-Pastur distribution was used which states that the eigenvalues of the 
correlation matrix obtained from a Z matrix whose elements are independent and identically 
distributed random variables (with zero mean and unit variance) are asymptotically (i.e., 
when n, B → ∞ such that B/n converges to a finite positive value) bounded to the interval 
35. This implies that none of the eigenvalues of the 
correlation matrix of a Z matrix constructed from the spike trains of neurons with 
independent firing activity is expected to exceed 
, as demonstrated 
elsewhere (for B > n)36,37. An eigenvalue above λmax thus indicates that the pattern given by 
the corresponding principal component captures more correlation in the data than any 
pattern could if the firing activity of all neurons was independent. The number of 
eigenvalues above λmax (denoted by NA) therefore represents the minimum number of 
distinct significant patterns in the data33,38.

 Identification of assembly-pattern composition using ICA—The first NA principal 
components each capture a significant amount of correlation between the firing patterns of 
the neurons. However, principal components are restricted to be orthogonal to each other 
while cell assemblies do not need to be (e.g., they can contain overlapping neurons). 
Principal components are also extracted from the data sequentially, which usually causes the 
first principal component to seemingly be a mixture of multiple assembly-patterns36,39 (our 
own observation not shown). Moreover, principal component analysis is solely based on 
pairwise correlations while higher-order correlations can also inform assembly 
identification. To avoid these issues, ICA was used instead. The ICA extracts patterns such 
that the linear projections of the data onto these patterns are as independent from each other 
as possible. However ICA directly applied to Z without prior dimension reduction would 
extract as many patterns as there are neurons33. To restrict the number of patterns identified 
by ICA to NA, the data was first projected onto the subspace spanned by the first NA 
principal components:
where PSIGN is the n × NA matrix with the first NA principal components as columns. ICA 
was then applied to the matrix ZPROJ. That is, an NA × NA un-mixing matrix W was found 
such that the rows of the matrix Y = WTZPROJ were as independent as possible. This 
optimization-problem was solved using the fast ICA algorithm40,41. The resulting un-mixing 
matrix W was then expressed in the original basis spanned by all the neurons:
where the columns of V (i.e., v1, …, vNA) are the assembly-patterns. As both the sign and 
the scale of the ICA output is arbitrary, all assembly-patterns were scaled to unit length (i.e., 
) and their sign set such that the highest absolute weight of each pattern was 
always positive. The contribution of each neuron towards the temporal expression of an 
assembly-pattern was taken as its squared weight (25ms time-bins: Days 1-3: 436 and 1312 
patterns; Days 4-6: 162 and 411 patterns; theta-cycle time-bins: Days 1-3: 380 and 1128 
patterns; Days 4-6: 123 and 438 patterns; with tagged and alternative neurons, respectively).
Tracking the activation-strength of assembly-patterns over time—To determine 
whether the optogenetic manipulation altered the strength of the expressed assemblies, we 
tracked each assembly-pattern vk over time by:
where z(t) is a smooth vector-function containing for each neuron its z-scored instantaneous 
firing-rate and Pk is the matrix projecting z(t) to the activation-strength of assembly-pattern 
k at time t. Pk was taken as the outer product of vk with the main diagonal entries set to zero 
to prevent high activation-strength caused by the isolated activity of a single neuron with

 high weight to that pattern. With this approach, only interactions between neurons could 
contribute towards the activation-strength of an assembly-pattern33,36–38. To increase the 
temporal resolution beyond the bin-size used to identify the assembly-patterns, z(t) was 
obtained by convolving the spike-train of each neuron with a kernel-function33,42 after 
which the resulting smooth curve was normalized by a z-score transform. A Gaussian kernel 
was chosen with standard deviation 
, so that the kernel had the same standard 
deviation as fixed time-bins of w ms 43. We set w to 25ms to match the bin-size used to 
identify the assembly-patterns. The resulting activation-strength time-courses showed a low 
baseline with sparse, transient peaks. Assembly-activations were defined as peaks exceeding 
RTHRES = 5 (Supplementary Fig. 9g,h).
Conditioned place preference (CPP)
The CPP apparatus consisted of a circle (46cm diameter, 38cm height) and a square 
(46cm×46cm×38cm) compartment connected via a bridge (8cm length, 5cm width), which 
was present during the Pre-test, the two CPP tests, the Extinction, the Drug-priming and the 
Novel sessions. All CPP experiments were performed using adult male mice and all days are 
numbered relative to the tagging day (Day 0; Figure 3a and Supplementary Fig. 11b). All 
mice were handled for at least 3 days prior to the experiment. On the first experiment day 
(Day -7), drug-free mice explored the entire apparatus for 15min to determine their baseline 
preference for one of the two compartments (Pre-test). Then, mice were conditioned for 
three days (Day -6, -5 and -4) with two pairing sessions each day. Conditioning was 
performed with respect to the initial preference of each animal (as identified during the Pre-
test) for one of the two compartments44,45. In the first session, mice received saline (0.9% 
saline, i.p.) prior to exploring the preferred compartment for 20min (saline-paired 
compartment). In the second session, 5h later, mice received cocaine (10mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma) 
prior to exploring the least-preferred compartment for 20min (cocaine-paired compartment). 
On the day after (22h after) the last conditioning session the cocaine place memory was 
assessed by allowing (drug-free) mice to explore the entire apparatus for 15min (Test 1; Day 
-3). Dox was subsequently removed from the diet of tagged mice, but not control mice. Mice 
were injected with cocaine (10mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma) prior to re-exposure to the cocaine-paired 
compartment for the tagging procedure (45min; Day 0). Both tagged and control mice were 
put on high Dox immediately after, and on regular Dox the next day. During each one of the 
three following days (Days 1–3) mice were successively re-exposed to the saline-paired 
compartment without photo-silencing (20min exploration) and to the cocaine-paired 
compartment 5h later with ArchT photo-silencing (20min exploration). The locomotor 
behavior of control and tagged c-fos::ArchT mice during re-exposure to the cocaine-paired 
enclosure was similar (distance travelled = 48.51±3.32m versus 54.26±2.74m, animal speed 
= 4.04±0.27cm/s versus 4.52±0.23cm/s; P=0.18). The cocaine place memory was re-
assessed by allowing mice to explore the entire apparatus for 15min (Test 2, Day 4). For 
each mouse the time spent in each compartment was measured during the pre-test and the 
two tests sessions and the cocaine place preference score calculated as the difference 
between the time spent in the cocaine-paired compartment minus that in the saline-paired 
compartment over their sum. Two additional experiments using the CPP apparatus were 
performed. The first was to test the ability of the mice to subsequently reinstate a cocaine 
place preference when cocaine-primed (10mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma; Supplementary Figure 11d)46 
Trouche et al.

 and the second was to test their ability to detect spatial novelty (Supplementary Figure 11e). 
Because control mice exhibited a cocaine place preference in Test 2 (see Figure 3c), we used 
a trial-to-criterion approach to extinguish their place preference prior to the drug-primed 
reinstatement test by repeatedly testing their place preference until their CPP score was no 
more than 0.04 (number of additional tests: 3.50±0.88)46. The drug-priming test was 
performed 24 hours after the extinction criterion was reached for control mice or 24h after 
Test 2 for tagged mice, then followed by the spatial novelty test. For each mouse the time 
spent in each compartment was measured during both the drug-priming and the novelty 
tests. The cocaine place preference score was calculated as mentioned above, and the novel 
place preference was scored by the time spent in the new compartment minus that in the 
other (familiar) compartment over their sum.
Cocaine place memory retrieval in c-fos-tTA-LacZ mice
A group of c-fos-tTA-LacZ adult male mice was used to evaluate the extent to which dorsal 
CA1 neurons that were activated during the exploration of the tagged open-field enclosure 
associated with a cocaine (n=7 mice) or a saline (n=4 mice) administration were 
subsequently re-activated during a (drug-free) spatial context re-exposure (Supplementary 
Fig. 10). Mice were individually housed for at least two weeks (and regular Dox was 
removed three days) before the tagging day. The tagging day consisted of injecting mice 
with either saline (0.9% saline, i.p.) or cocaine (10mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma) before they were 
allowed to explore the open-field enclosure for 30min. A high dose of Dox (1g/kg) was 
provided immediately after the exploration session before returning to regular Dox one day 
after. Drug-free mice were re-exposed to the tagged enclosure three days later and perfused 
90min after. Brains were extracted for immunohistochemistry procedures (Supplementary 
Figure 10).
Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry
At the completion of the experiments all mice were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital 
and transcardially perfused with 0.1M phosphate buffer saline (PBS) followed by cold 4% 
paraformaldehyde (4% PFA) dissolved in PBS24. Brains were extracted and kept in 4% PFA 
for at least 24h before slicing and sections were stored in PBS-azide. For immunostaining, 
free-floating sections were rinsed extensively in PBS with 0.25% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) and 
were blocked for 1h at room temperature in PBS-T with 10% normal donkey serum (NDS). 
Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 3% NDS blocking solution 
and incubated at 4°C for 72h (rabbit polyclonal anti-neuropeptide tyrosine NPY 1:1,500, 
Abcam; goat polyclonal anti-Parvalbumin PV 1:4,000, Swant; rat monoclonal anti-
Somatostatin 1:1,000; mouse monoclonal anti-beta-Galactosidase 1:10,000, Promega; rabbit 
polyclonal anti-c-Fos 1:10,000, Santa Cruz). All sections were rinsed three times for 15min 
in PBS-T and incubated for 4h at room temperature in secondary antibodies (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch; donkey anti-rat AMCA 1/250; donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 1/1,000; donkey 
anti-mouse 647 1/500; donkey anti-goat 647, 1/500) diluted in the blocking solution. This 
step was followed by three rinses for 15min in PBS-T. Sections were then incubated for 
1min with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Dapi, 0.5μg/ml, Sigma, D8417) diluted in PBS 
to label cell nuclei before undergoing three additional rinse steps of 10min each in PBS.

 Sections were mounted on slides, cover-slipped with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector 
Laboratories, CA) and stored at 4°C.
Image acquisition and quantification
Images shown in Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure 10c were acquired using a laser-
scanning confocal microscope (LSM 710; Zeiss, 40×/1.3 objective) in sequential scanning 
mode. A single 1μm confocal plane was used for Dapi pictures with flattened z-stacks (2μm 
step) for the GFP, LacZ or Fos signals. Series of tiled single-plan GFP and Dapi images 
shown in Supplementary Figure 1b were acquired using an epifluorescence microscope 
(AxioImager M2; Zeiss, 10×/0.45 objective) and StereoInvestigator software (Virtual Tissue 
2D module, MBF Bioscience). Counting was performed on z-stacks using StereoInvestigator 
(MBF Bioscience) and ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/) software. An experimenter blind to 
each condition outlined the pyramidal cell layer of the dorsal CA1 according to the Dapi 
signal in each brain section. The experimenter estimated the total number of Dapi positive 
cells in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer by randomly outlining 9 CA1 sample areas on sections 
from a subset of c-fos::ArchT mice (n=3). In Figure 1, quantification of ArchT-GFP positive 
neurons in the pyramidal cell layer was conducted from 1-in-3 coronal sections (50μm 
thickness, average of n=11.14±1.31 CA1 hippocampi per mouse) throughout the dorsal CA1 
(−1.46 to −2.46mm from bregma) from tagged (n=4) and control (n=3) mice perfused on 
Day3. In each hippocampus section, the percentage of ArchT-GFP cells expressing the 
different interneuron markers (Parvalbumin PV, neuropeptide-Y NPY and somatostatin) was 
evaluated. Putative pyramidal cells were required to exhibit dendritic spines (Figure 1c) and 
be immunonegative for PV, NPY and somatostatin, markers known to capture 
interneurons27,28,47,48. In Supplementary Fig. 10, quantification of LacZ-positive and Fos-
positive neurons in the pyramidal cell layer was conducted from 1-in-7 coronal sections 
(30μm thickness, average of n=11.91±0.45 CA1 hippocampi per mouse) throughout the 
dorsal CA1 (−1.31 to −2.53 from bregma) from saline (n=4) and cocaine (n=7) mice.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. All P values were calculated in R 
(www.r-project.org) using a two-sided t-test or an ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Tukey’s 
test for multiple comparisons, unless specified otherwise.

 Figure 3. CA1 photo-recoding revoked an otherwise long-lasting cocaine-place memory
(a) Cocaine-conditioned place preference paradigm. Mice explored the entire apparatus 
(Pre-test) before the preferred compartment was paired with saline (+S) and the other with 
cocaine (+C) administration, followed by a place-preference test (Test 1). Then tagged, but 
not control, c-fos::ArchT mice were transiently taken off Dox to tag active CA1 neurons and 
all mice received cocaine in the cocaine-paired compartment. CA1 light was delivered to all 
c-fos::ArchT mice during subsequent (drug-free) re-exposure to the cocaine-paired 
compartment, followed by a second place-preference test (Test 2). (b) Example paths for c-
fos::ArchT tagged and control mice during Pre-test, Test 1 and Test 2. (c) Cocaine-place 
preference score (mean±s.e.m). During each test drug-free mice had access to the entire
