BACKGROUND: Influenza-associated pediatric deaths became a notifiable condition in the 
United States in 2004.
METHODS: We analyzed deaths in children aged <18 years with laboratory-confirmed 
influenza virus infection reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during 
the 2010–2011 to 2015–2016 influenza seasons. Data were collected with a standard case 
report form that included demographics, medical conditions, and clinical diagnoses.
RESULTS: Overall, 675 deaths were reported. The median age was 6 years (interquartile 
range: 2–12). The average annual incidence was 0.15 per 100 000 children (95% confidence 
interval: 0.14–0.16) and was highest among children aged <6 months (incidence: 0.66; 95% 
confidence interval: 0.53–0.82), followed by children aged 6–23 months (incidence: 0.33; 
95% confidence interval: 0.27–0.39). Only 31% (n = 149 of 477) of children aged ≥6 months 
had received any influenza vaccination. Overall, 65% (n = 410 of 628) of children died 
within 7 days after symptom onset. Half of the children (n = 327 of 654) had no preexisting 
medical conditions. Compared with children with preexisting medical conditions, children 
with none were younger (median: 5 vs 8 years old), less vaccinated (27% vs 36%), more 
likely to die before hospital admission (77% vs 48%), and had a shorter illness duration  
(4 vs 7 days; P < .05 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: Each year, influenza-associated pediatric deaths are reported. Young children 
have the highest death rates, especially infants aged <6 months. Increasing vaccination 
among children, pregnant women, and caregivers of infants may reduce influenza-
associated pediatric deaths.

WhAt’S KNOWN ON thIS SUbjECt: In 2004, 
influenza-associated pediatric mortality became 
a notifiable condition, and deaths are reported 
annually. Young children and children with 
preexisting conditions, particularly neurologic 
disorders, are overrepresented among influenza-
associated pediatric deaths. Influenza vaccination 
for all children ≥6 months old is recommended.
WhAt thIS StUDy ADDS: From 2010 to 2016, young 
children continued to be at the greatest risk for 
influenza-associated pediatric deaths. Children 
without preexisting medical conditions accounted 
for half of all deaths. Vaccination coverage was low 
among influenza-associated pediatric deaths.

 In 2004, after a particularly severe 
influenza season with 153 reported 
pediatric deaths, influenza-
associated pediatric deaths became 
a nationally notifiable disease, and 
the Influenza-Associated Pediatric 
Mortality Surveillance System was 
implemented in the United States.1, 
 
2  
Since 2004, surveillance data 
have been used to describe the 
burden and risk factors associated 
with both seasonal and pandemic 
influenza-associated pediatric 
deaths.3 
– 
8 Previous results that were 
summarized from this surveillance 
system have contributed to evidence 
used by the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices for influenza 
vaccination recommendations for 
children.9, 
10 In this report, we update 
previous reports and describe 
influenza-associated pediatric deaths 
for the 6 seasons after the 2009 
(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, from the 
2010–2011 season to the 2015–2016 
season.

Data Source
We analyzed data from the Influenza-
Associated Pediatric Mortality 
Surveillance System for 6 influenza 
seasons, 2010–2011 to 2015–2016. 
For this analysis, an influenza season 
was defined as October 1 through 
September 30 of the following year. 
This system has been described in 
detail previously.3, 
 
6 
– 
8 Briefly, an 
influenza-associated pediatric death 
is defined as a death resulting from 
a clinically compatible illness in a 
US resident aged <18 years with 
laboratory-confirmed influenza 
virus infection, with no period of 
complete recovery between the 
illness and death. State and territorial 
health departments report deaths 
to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention using a standard 
case report form and transmit the 
information through a secure, Web-
based interface. The form is used to 
collect information on demographics, 
dates of illness onset and death, 
hospital admissions, complications, 
location of death, preexisting 
medical conditions, influenza virus 
testing and results, and influenza 
vaccination status. In addition, states 
report whether bacterial testing 
was performed on specimens from 
sterile sites after illness onset or from 
postmortem tissue (if the specimen 
was collected within 24 hours after 
death) and results.
We compared the relative proportion 
of influenza A and B viruses detected 
among pediatric deaths with the 
proportions detected in persons 
aged ≤24 years as reported by the 
US Influenza Virologic Surveillance 
System. The Influenza Virologic 
Surveillance System collects data 
from ∼100 public health and 300 
clinical laboratories in the United 
States through either the US World 
Health Organization Collaborating 
Laboratories System or the 
National Respiratory and Enteric 
Virus Surveillance System.11 Each 
week, these laboratories report 
to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention the total number 
of respiratory specimens tested, 
the number that are positive for 
influenza viruses by virus type, 
and the (when available) influenza 
A virus subtypes and influenza B 
virus lineage. In addition, the World 
Health Organization collaborating 
laboratories report on the age or age 
group (0–4 years, 5–24 years, 25–64 
years, and ≥65 years) of the person 
tested.12
Definitions
Children aged ≥6 months at the date 
of illness onset were considered 
eligible for vaccination. Children 
aged 6 months to 8 years were 
considered fully vaccinated if they 
were reported to have received the 
recommended doses of the influenza 
vaccine ≥14 days before illness 
onset in that season13 
– 
18; they were 
considered partially vaccinated if 
they were reported to have received 
1 dose of the vaccine ≥14 days before 
illness onset but no vaccination in 
the immediate-previous season or if 
they received 2 doses in the current 
season but the interval between the 
2 doses was <28 days or the interval 
between the second dose and illness 
onset was <14 days. Data on maternal 
vaccination were not collected. 
Children with ≥1 of the following 
conditions before illness onset were 
considered to have a preexisting 
medical condition: asthma and/or  
reactive airway disease, cancer, 
cardiac and congenital heart 
diseases, cerebral palsy, chronic 
pulmonary diseases, cystic fibrosis, 
chromosomal diseases, moderate to 
severe developmental delay, diabetes 
mellitus, endocrine disorders, 
febrile seizures, immunosuppressive 
conditions, metabolic diseases, 
mitochondrial disorder, neurologic 
or neurodevelopmental disorders, 
neuromuscular disorder, premature 
at birth, pregnancy, renal diseases, or 
seizure disorder.
Statistical Analysis
A Wilcoxon rank test was used to 
compare medians, and a χ2 test was 
used to compare proportions among 
different groups. A Cochran-Armitage 
trend test was used for trend 
analysis. Population estimates from 
the US Census Bureau (2011–2015) 
were used to calculate minimum 
mortality rates.19 Population 
estimates for 2016 were not available 
at the time of this analysis, so the 
population estimates of 2015 were 
used for 2016 population calculation. 
Although the true burden was likely 
underestimated, the mortality rates 
allowed us to compare the burden 
across different groups. Exact 95% 
confidence intervals were calculated 
with Poisson distribution. All P values 
were 2 sided, and P values <.05 were 
considered statistically significant. 
Data were analyzed with SAS 9.3 
(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).

 RESULtS
From October 2010 to September 
2016, 675 influenza-associated 
pediatric deaths were reported by 49 
states and Puerto Rico. The median 
age was 6 years (interquartile range 
[IQR]: 2–12 years). The average 
annual mortality rate was 0.15  
deaths per 100 000 children (Table 1). 
 
Children aged <6 months had the 
highest mortality rate (0.66 deaths 
per 100 000 children). Compared 
with children aged 13 to 17 years, 
infants aged <6 months were >6 
times as likely to have an influenza-
associated death, and children aged 
6 to 23 months were >3 times as 
likely to have an influenza-associated 
death. During the 6 seasons 
examined, annual mortality rates 
were consistently the highest in 
children <6 months and children 6 to 
23 months. Native Hawaiian and/or 
Pacific Islander and American Indian 
and/or Alaskan native children had 
higher mortality rates than children 
who were white, African American, 
or Asian American.
The annual average number of 
influenza-associated pediatric deaths 
from 2010 to 2016 was 113; the 
2012–2013 season had the highest 
number of pediatric deaths reported 
(n = 171), and the 2011–2012 season 
had the lowest number (n = 37;  
 
Fig 1).12 Overall, 65% (n = 436 of 
675) of pediatric deaths coincided 
with an influenza A virus infection, 
33% (n = 225 of 675) of case patients 
had an influenza B virus infection 
reported, <1% (n = 5 of 675) had A 
and B viruses coinfections, and 1% 
(n = 9 of 675) were not typed. This 
relative proportion of A and B viruses 
for each season was similar to that 
seen among all persons aged ≤24 
years in the virologic surveillance 
(except for the 2012–2013 season, 
during which influenza A viruses 
[48%] were detected less frequently 
than B viruses [52%] among 
pediatric deaths). In virologic 
surveillance, influenza A viruses 
were predominant (>65%) during 
all 6 seasons. The actual proportion 
of influenza B viruses detected in 
pediatric deaths was higher than the 
proportion of influenza B viruses 
detected in children of a similar 
age (≤24 years old) from virologic 
surveillance for each of the 6 seasons. 
This finding remained when we 
limited the analysis to children aged 
<5 years in both surveillance systems 
(data not shown). Overall, among the 
4 age groups of children who died 
(<6 months, 6 to 23 months, 24 to 
59 months, and 5–17 years), young 
children had a higher proportion 
of influenza A viruses detected 
than older children; 83% (n = 63 
of 76) of children aged <6 months 
had influenza A viruses detected 
compared with 58% (n = 216 of 371) 
of children aged 5 to 17 years (test 
for trend P < .01).
Half of the children who died had ≥1 
preexisting medical condition before 
illness onset (Table 2). Neurologic 
disorders (27%) were the most 
commonly reported conditions, 
followed by asthma and/or reactive 
airway disease, cardiac or congenital 
heart disease, and chronic pulmonary 
diseases. Of the 477 children who 
were eligible for vaccination and for 
whom vaccination information was 
available, 31% had evidence of any 
influenza vaccination, and 22% had 
evidence of full vaccination. Two 
of the children who were partially 
vaccinated were <7 months of age 
and therefore did not have time for 
full vaccination before death. The 
median time from symptom onset 
to death was 5 days (IQR: 2–11 
days). The majority of children 
(65%) died within 7 days of illness 
onset, and 13% died within 1 day of 
illness onset. Thirty-eight percent

Downloaded from 
 (n = 255 of 665) of the children died 
in the community or emergency 
department (ED) before hospital 
admission.
Specimens from normally sterile  
sites were collected from 362  
children for bacterial testing, among 
these, blood or blood combined  
with other samples (85%) were the 
most frequently reported. Overall, 
43% had bacteria detected. Of  
those, β-hemolytic Streptococcus 
(19%) and Staphylococcus aureus 
(17%) were the most commonly  
reported bacterial coinfections 
(Table 2). The majority (66%;  
n = 31 of 47) of S aureus isolates that 
had sensitivity testing performed  
on them were antibiotic resistant.  
We found no difference in the  
proportion of bacterial coinfections 
that were detected among children 
who died within 5 days of illness 
onset compared with children 
who died later in their illnesses 
(P = .39). In 13% (n = 62 of 488) 
of influenza-associated pediatric 
deaths, coinfection with another 
virus was reported, with respiratory 
syncytial virus (40%) being the most 
frequently identified.
Overall, clinical complications before 
death were reported for 75% of 
the children (Table 2). The most 
frequently reported complications 
were pneumonia (41%), sepsis or 
shock (31%), and acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) (29%). We 
did not detect a higher proportion 
of invasive bacterial infections 
among patients with pneumonia 
complications compared with 
nonpneumonia patients (43% [n = 73 
of 167] vs 40% [n = 53 of 133];  
P = .50). In addition to the syndromes 
that are typically recognized as 
complications, 22 (4%) and 17 (3%) 
deaths had bronchiolitis and croup 
reported, respectively. Antiviral 
treatment was reported in 53%  
(n = 321 of 611) of pediatric deaths; 
as expected, most antiviral use  
(n = 282; 88%) was among children 
who were admitted to the hospital. 
Antibiotic treatment was reported 
in 51% (n = 310 of 611) of pediatric 
deaths, and most antibiotic use  
(n = 266; 86%) was among children 
who were admitted to the hospital.
Children who died with and without 
preexisting medical conditions 
differed by age, vaccination status, 
bacterial coinfections, clinical 
complications, illness duration, 
antiviral treatment, and location of 
death (Table 3). Preexisting medical 
conditions were more common 
among older children, and the 
proportion of children who died 
with preexisting medical conditions 
increased with age; of children <6 
months old, 29% had preexisting 
medical conditions, but 60% of 
children aged 9 to 17 years had 
preexisting medical conditions  
(P for trend <.01). Children without 
preexisting medical conditions 
were less likely to be vaccinated, 
have clinical complications, receive 
antiviral treatment, and to be 
admitted to a hospital, but they 
were more likely to have bacterial 
coinfections or die more quickly 
than children with preexisting 
medical conditions. Among the 
children who died before hospital 
admission, the median number of 
days from illness onset to death was 
the same for children with or without 
preexisting medical conditions 
(Fig 2). Among children who were 
admitted to the hospital before 
death, the time between illness 
onset and death among those with 
preexisting medical conditions was 
longer compared with those without 
preexisting medical conditions. 
However, the time from illness onset 
to admission was the same for these 
2 groups (median: 2 days; P = .10).

Comparison of influenza A and B viruses detected among influenza-associated pediatric deaths and 
persons aged ≤24 years by the Influenza Virologic Surveillance System in the United States (2010–
2016). The number of specimens that were able to be typed as either influenza A or B infection among 
pediatric deaths were as follows: 2010–2011 season, 123 of 123; 2011–2012 season, 36 of 37; 2012–
2013 season, 168 of 171; 2013–2014 season, 107 of 111; 2014–2015 season, 145 of 148; and 2015–2016

systems were as follows: 2010–2011 season, P < .01; 2011–2012 season, P = .06; 2012–2013 season, 
P < .01; 2013–2014 season, P = .38; 2014–2015 season, P = .01; 2015–2016 season, P < .01; and from

 DISCUSSION
During influenza seasons 2010–2011 
to 2015–2016, an average of 113 
influenza-associated pediatric 
deaths were reported each year. This 
number is likely an underestimate, 
with the true number perhaps being 
as much as twofold higher.21 Half 
of the reported deaths were among 
children with preexisting medical 
conditions, with neurologic disorders 
being the most commonly reported. 
Children aged <6 months were >4 
times as likely and children aged 
6 to 23 months were >2 times as 
likely to die compared with children 
aged 2 to 17 years. Young children 
<2 years of age were less likely to 
have preexisting medical conditions 
compared with older children who 
died. Reported influenza vaccination 
coverage levels among pediatric 
deaths for all age groups were below 
the nationally reported level of 59% 
during the 2015–2016 influenza 
season.22 Our results reinforce the 
need to continue efforts to improve 
vaccination coverage among all 
children aged ≥6 months as well 
as pregnant women and household 
members who care for infants aged 
<6 months to meet the Healthy 
People 2020 goal of 70%.23
Young children are at an increased 
risk for severe influenza infections. 
In addition to high rates of 
influenza-associated deaths, young 
children also had the highest rates 
of influenza-associated pediatric 
hospitalization from 2003 to 2009 
and pediatric hospitalizations 
because of lower respiratory tract 
infections from 2007 to 2011.24 
– 
27 
Also, most young children who were 
hospitalized had no preexisting 
medical conditions.25, 
 
26, 
 
28, 
 
29 For 
children aged ≥6 months, influenza 
vaccination has been estimated to 
reduce the risk of pediatric deaths by 
half among children with preexisting 
medical conditions and by nearly 
two-thirds among children without 
preexisting medical conditions 
from 2010 to 2014.30 Vaccination

demonstrated to reduce laboratory-
confirmed influenza among infants in 
the first 4 to 6 months of life.31

Children with certain preexisting 
medical conditions are at an 
increased risk for influenza 
complications, 
34 including 
hospitalization or death.35, 
 
36 Among 
influenza-associated pediatric deaths, 
neurologic disorders were the most 
commonly reported conditions, 
as previously described.1, 
7, 
 
8 These 
conditions are rare in the general 
population but are overrepresented 
among pediatric deaths and 
children who are hospitalized with 
influenza.37 
– 
39 Vaccine coverage 
was low for these high-risk children, 
and ongoing educational efforts are 
needed.
The time from illness onset to death 
was short for most children in our 
data set. The majority of children 
died within 7 days after illness 
onset, and 13% died within 1 day; 
this percentage was even higher 
among children without preexisting 
medical conditions. Also, ∼40% of 
the children died in the community 
or ED before hospital admission. 
The reasons for such a rapid demise 
remain unknown, but we cannot 
rule out that the overall shorter 
illness duration in previously 
healthy children may be related to 
differences in health care–seeking 
behavior or the timing of health care 
interventions after illness onset.
During the 6 seasons studied, the 
proportion of influenza B viruses 
relative to A viruses detected among 
pediatric deaths was higher than 
among children of a similar age in the 
US Influenza Virologic Surveillance 
System. This has been documented 
previously.1, 
 
3, 
 
6, 
 
8 Thus, both influenza 
A and B viruses are associated with 
pediatric deaths, but the relative 
proportion of B virus infections 
might be slightly higher among 
deaths than in general surveillance. 
Additional studies are underway in 
an effort to describe this observation

 more completely. Some researchers 
suggest slower age-dependent 
accumulation in the innate immune 
response to influenza B relative to 
influenza A illnesses, although the 
exact immune system changes are 
unknown.40, 
 
41
The children who died experienced 
a range of complications with 
pneumonia, sepsis, or shock,  
and ARDS was reported most 
commonly, which is similar to 
what’s been revealed in previous 
reports.1, 
 
8 Pneumonia and  
ARDS were also frequently 
reported in hospitalized pediatric 
patients.42 
–44 Consistent with 
previous reports, Streptococcus 
and S aureus were the most 
commonly identified bacterial 
coinfections in addition to influenza 
virus infection.1, 
 
5, 
 
8 More bacterial 
coinfections were identified in 
children without preexisting 
medical conditions than in those 
with preexisting conditions, which 
is consistent with other reports.8, 
37 
Information on the receipt of other 
pediatric vaccines was not collected. 
However, these results highlight 
the importance of the receipt of 
vaccination against other vaccine-
preventable diseases among young 
children and ongoing research to 
prevent respiratory diseases that 
currently have no vaccines.
Overall, more than half of the 
pediatric patients who died were 
reported to have received antiviral 
or antibiotic treatment; we do not 
have information on the timing of 
treatment relative to death. Antiviral 
treatment is recommended for all 
persons with severe illnesses that 
are suspected to be associated with 
influenza, such as hospitalized illness, 
and for illnesses among persons with 
high-risk conditions.45
Our findings are subject to several 
limitations. First, there is a potential 
underestimation of mortality 
numbers and rates because influenza 
testing was not always performed 
or was performed later in the 
illness, when the virus could not 
be detected anymore. The testing 
practices may also vary by age 
and the presence of preexisting 
medical conditions. In addition to 
underestimating mortality, these 
variations in testing practices might 
also affect the representation of 
certain children in our data. Second, 
the misclassification of preexisting 
medical conditions and vaccination 
status may have occurred because 
of the challenges of diagnosing 
underlying conditions in young 
children and missing data. Third, we 
compared the proportion of influenza 
virus types among pediatric deaths 
to surveillance data from a larger 
age group (persons aged ≤24 years) 
because of the format of surveillance 
data. Finally, we are unable to assess 
the effect of antiviral or antibacterial 
treatment on deaths with the 
information collected.
CONCLUSIONS
Influenza-associated pediatric deaths 
are reported each year in the United 
States. Influenza-associated pediatric 
mortality was highest among young 
children aged <2 years. Although 
many pediatric deaths occurred in 
children with preexisting medical 
conditions, half of the deaths were 
in previously healthy children. 
This report reinforces the need 
to improve influenza vaccination 
coverage to meet the Healthy People 
2020 goals. Also, prompt antiviral 
treatment should be initiated when 
young children and children with 
high-risk conditions are suspected 
to have influenza and when children 
are hospitalized with suspected 
influenza.
