ABSTRACT
Objective: When advising patients about possible
initiation of primary prevention treatment, clinicians
currently do not have information on expected impact
on lifespan, nor how much this increment differs
between individuals.
Methods: First, UK cardiovascular and non-
cardiovascular mortality data were used to calculate the
mean lifespan gain from an intervention (such as a
statin) that reduces cardiovascular mortality by 30%.
Second, a new method was developed to calculate the
probability distribution of lifespan gain. Third, we
performed a survey in three UK cities on 11 days
between May–June 2014 involving 396 participants
(mean age 40 years, 55% male) to assess how
individuals evaluate potential benefit from primary
prevention therapies.
Results: Among numerous identical patients, the
lifespan gain, from an intervention that reduces
cardiovascular mortality by 30%, is concentrated within
an unpredictable minority. For example, men aged
50 years with national average cardiovascular risk have
mean lifespan gain of 7 months. However, 93% of these
identical individuals gain no lifespan, while the
remaining 7% gain a mean of 99 months. Many survey
respondents preferred a chance of large lifespan gain to
the equivalent life expectancy gain given as certainty.
Indeed, 33% preferred a 2% probability of 10 years to
fivefold more gain, expressed as certainty of 1 year.
Conclusions: People who gain lifespan from
preventative therapy gain far more than the average for
their risk stratum, even if perfectly defined. This may be
important in patient decision-making. Looking beyond
mortality reduction alone from preventative therapy, the
benefits are likely to be even larger.
INTRODUCTION
Deciding whether or not to start preventative
therapy can be challenging. Current guide-
lines recommend a shared decision-making
process, beginning with estimation of cardio-
vascular risk.1
2 However, when calculated
over a lifetime (the usual intended duration
of preventative medication), cardiovascular
risk turns out to be high in everyone.3
4
Therefore,
perhaps
in
order
to
spread
people along a spectrum, cardiovascular risk
is commonly assessed over a fixed time
window such as 10 years.
A challenge commonly raised by oppo-
nents of primary prevention is that many
patients given preventative medication could
be argued to not ‘need’ it because, even
without treatment, they will not experience a
cardiovascular event.5 Clinicians understand
that averaging benefit over a population is a
necessary simplification, as whenever there is
one patient who gains less than average from
an intervention, there is another who has an
identical risk factor profile at baseline but
KEY QUESTIONS
What is already known about this subject?
▸ Current clinical practice examines cardiovascular
risk over fixed time windows that are typically
much shorter than a healthy individual’s life
expectancy. Therefore, when advising patients
about possible initiation of primary prevention
treatment, clinicians currently do not have infor-
mation on expected impact on lifespan, nor how
much this differs between individuals.
What does this study add?
▸ Our study shows that the probability distribution
of expected benefit from primary prevention
therapy for individuals starting from an identical
baseline is far from uniform, with people who
gain lifespan from preventative therapy gaining
far more than the average for their risk stratum.
In addition, the spectrum of lifespan gain has a
similar range between low-risk and high-risk
patients: the difference is not in the size of life-
span in those that benefit but in the proportion
of patients who benefit.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
▸ The results of this study suggest an opportunity
to broaden prescription of primary prevention,
since it suggests that younger patients, despite
having lower initial estimated cardiovascular
risk, may be in a position to gain the most from
extended therapy.

 gains more.6–8 Discussing this uncertainty over an indivi-
dual’s future gain is rare, perhaps because information
on it is not currently available in a manner that can
easily be conveyed to patients.9
10 In principle, this
could be described as a distribution of different sizes of
lifespan gain among individuals who at the outset are
indistinguishable.
To address these gaps in knowledge, we performed a
three-part study. First, we used published cardiovascular
and non-cardiovascular mortality data to calculate the
mean lifespan gain from primary prevention interventions
such as a statin. Second, we used a simulation approach to
calculate a probabilistic distribution of lifespan gain at the
individual level for patients who at baseline have identical
cardiovascular risk profiles. Finally, we carried out a survey
to assess empirically how people perceive benefit gains
from primary prevention therapy when these benefits are
described in fixed or probabilistic terms.
METHODS
Calculation of mean lifespan gain
Age-specific cardiovascular mortality data and established
hazard ratios achievable by preventative therapy were
used to calculate the expected, or mean, lifespan gain for
men and women with different levels of baseline cardio-
vascular risk using standard multiple decrement life-table
methods.11 Baseline life expectancy was calculated using
published age-specific mortality data in England and
Wales in 201212 and population data13 obtained from the
UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). Deaths from
ischaemic heart disease (ICD-10 codes I20–I25) and cere-
brovascular disease14 (I60–I69) were combined to calcu-
late age-specific cardiovascular mortality.
Data on the national average mean, and the distribu-
tion of blood pressure (BP), smoking status and choles-
terol were obtained from the QRESEARCH database
(2005).15 Separate life expectancy values were calculated
for each combination of cardiovascular risk factors
(smoking, systolic BP
, total cholesterol, age and sex)
using the SCORE algorithm.16 We have not included
separate life-tables for patients with diabetes because
they routinely receive primary prevention.2
Reduction in cardiovascular mortality was calculated for
a single-agent preventative therapy—for example, a statin
that has been shown in meta-analyses to reduce cardiovas-
cular
death
by
20–30%.17
We
defined
the
average
expected longevity benefit as the difference between base-
line life expectancy and life expectancy with intervention
that reduces cardiovascular (but not non-cardiovascular)
mortality by 30%. We covered ages of initiation of pre-
ventative therapy from 50 years upwards.
Distribution of lifespan gain among individuals within the
same risk stratum
Motivation and outline of calculation method
Even within a group of people with identical cardiovas-
cular risk, individuals will each have different lifespans
and different individual gains in lifespan from preven-
tion, because of the effect of chance. To calculate an
individual gain, we need to quantify for each individual
a pair of lifespans which use an identical play of chance
but with different thresholds for a fatal event (see online
supplementary appendix 1).
The outline of this process is most easily appreciated
using an analogy. Imagine mortality being determined
purely by throwing a pair of dice every day. If an individ-
ual throws a six on either of their dice, their life ends.
Running this for many days permits a lifespan to be cal-
culated. The same dice throws can then be re-evaluated
to deliver reduced mortality risk but identical play of
chance. For example, if a double six was now required
for a fatal event, then many of the throws that had been
considered fatal would now not be fatal, so lifespan
would likely be longer. This ability to evaluate in a single
simulated individual (ie, an identical play of chance) the
impact of a risk reduction on lifespan is unique to this
approach. This cannot be established from clinical trials
because each patient lives only once.
This process can be carried out for multiple simulated
individuals at identical baseline risk. Each individual has
their own unique single set of dice throws for which two
lifespans are calculated. Conducting this process for
thousands of simulated individuals who are identical at
the outset allows us to state what proportion of them
would gain lifespan from the intervention and by how
much. The existence of a distribution of lifespan gain
should not be misunderstood to reflect variation in risk
between individuals: all had identical risk and the differ-
ences result entirely from the play of chance.
Details of formal calculation method
We wrote software in Matlab to carry out these calcula-
tions. For purposes of replication, we wrote the same
algorithm in Python to confirm identical results. Online
supplementary Appendix 1 shows software code in both
languages with a full explanation of the method of cal-
culation, which is a Monte Carlo simulation with dupli-
cate evaluation of identical stochastic data.
Conveying life expectancy gains to patients: survey of
general public to assess preference
We tested members of the general public for their pref-
erence between a certainty of a small gain in healthy life-
span (1 year) versus a percentage chance of a larger
gain
in
healthy
lifespan
(10 years).
Adults
were
approached in public thoroughfares in three different
multiethnic cities in the UK (London, Leicester and
Newcastle) on 11 separate days and invited to participate
in a brief verbal survey. There were no inclusion or
exclusion criteria.
Respondents were randomly allocated to one of five
versions of the survey in which the percentage chances
of the larger gain are 2%, 5%, 10%, 20% and 50% (see
online supplementary Appendix 2). Each respondent
answered the question for only one of these five

answered by at least 55 respondents, which would
provide a precision (95% CI) of±13%.

by

Sample size calculation for survey
We calculated the necessary sample size based on achiev-
ing a target level of precision. We wanted to quantify the
proportion of respondents preferring each of the two
choices with a precision (95% CI) of ±5%. This required
385 respondents. We aimed to sample for complete days
until the count exceeded 385 respondents.19
RESULTS
Life expectancy gain from a lifetime of preventative
therapy
From the mean lifespan gain for any combination of
baseline risk factors (figure 1), the effect of the age of
initiation of therapy on mean lifespan gain can be seen
(figure 2). For example, among non-smokers starting
preventative therapy at the age 50, the life expectancy
gain ranges from 3.1 months for women in the lowest
risk
stratum
(total
cholesterol
4 mmol/L,
SBP
120 mm Hg) to 17.8 months for men in the highest risk
stratum (total cholesterol 8 mmol/L, SBP 180 mm Hg).
It is notable that although risk, and absolute risk
reduction from intervention, increases with age, this
does not translate into mean lifespan gain increasing
with age of initiation of intervention. In fact, for any
combination of cardiovascular risk factors, the potential
lifespan gain from initiation of intervention decreases
with increasing age of initiation. The gain for initiation
at age 50 is approximately twofold to threefold larger
than the gain for initiation at age 80.
Distribution of lifespan gain within a primary prevention
population compared with mean lifespan gain
A group of individuals starting preventative therapy at
the same age, even if their baseline characteristics are
identical, will have a range of different individual life-
span gains. The distribution of lifespan gain from taking
daily preventative therapy with a risk reduction of 30% is
shown in figure 3 for men with national average cardio-
vascular risk starting preventative therapy at the age of
50. Notably, the great majority gain no lifespan, while
the minority that do gain, gain much more than the
group average increase in lifespan. For example, for a
50-year-old, non-smoker, non-diabetic man with average
cholesterol
and
BP
,
mean
life
expectancy
gain
is
7 months starting preventative therapy. However, among
such individuals, 93% gain no extra lifespan, but the
remaining 7% gain an average of 99 months.
Impact of cardiovascular risk on the distribution of
lifespan gain within a risk stratum
The distribution of lifespan gain is dependent on base-
line cardiovascular risk. For a group of lower risk indivi-
duals, for example, women with half-national average
baseline
cardiovascular
risk
for
women,
mean
life
expectancy gain from initiating therapy at age 50 is
3 months. This arises from a 3.4% subset of patients
who, between them, gain an average of 92 months, while
the remaining 96.6% do not gain any increase in life
expectancy.
In a higher risk group, for example, males initiating
therapy at 50 years with double the national average
baseline risk for men, the mean life expectancy gain is
higher (12 months). This is composed of a more sub-
stantial subset (11.1%) of patients who gain an increase
in lifespan of average 107 months (figure 4).
Thus, those that gain lifespan in the high-risk popula-
tion gain a very similar amount to those that gain life-
span in the low-risk population. What differs greatly
between the populations is the proportion who benefit,
which is approximately three times larger for the high-
risk group in the example above.
Sensitivity analysis
We explored this pattern in a sensitivity analysis, which
examined alternate scenarios (table 1). We covered com-
binations of proportions of cardiovascular risk (15%,
20%, 25%) and hazard reductions from intervention
(0.2, 0.3, 0.4). The pattern of results was that higher pro-
portions of cardiovascular risk and larger hazard reduc-
tions gave higher mean lifespan gains, and this was
composed of a larger proportion of patients benefitting
but almost no change in the mean lifespan gain among
those who gained lifespan.
Impact of delayed initiation on lifespan gain
On first inspection of figure 2, it may appear that there
is little to gain from starting intervention at the youngest
age of initiation because lifespan gain is not falling
rapidly with age. Our analysis permits the same patient’s
life course to be recalculated without intervention or
with intervention started at different ages. This permits
the extra lifespan gain in that individual from earlier or
later initiation of therapy to be directly evaluated.
Figure 4 reveals that with increasing age, the percentage
of patients that benefit stays relatively stable, but the
mean possible lifespan gain and the lifespan gain in
those that benefit decrease.
For example, in men initiating therapy at age 50,
mean lifespan gain available is 12 months with 11.1%
gaining an average of 107 months. If this same group of
identical individuals started therapy at 80 years instead,
the mean lifespan gain is reduced to 6 months, which
arises from the percentage benefitting staying relatively

 constant at 11.5% but those benefitting gaining a far
smaller amount (56 months).
Survey of general public’s preference between certainty of
small lifespan gain and chance of large lifespan gain
Discussing life expectancy gains with patients tacitly
relies on the principle that they would consider it
equally desirable to gain a 50% chance of two extra life-
years or a certainty of 1 year. We assessed how individuals
evaluate potential benefit of primary prevention therapy
when such benefits were presented in fixed or probabil-
istic terms. Between May and June 2014, 396 participants
were recruited after approaching 465 members of the
public. Their mean age was 40 years (SD 17 years), 55%
were male and 4% had had myocardial infarction or
stroke (see online supplementary Appendix 3).
The findings are shown in figure 5. Some respondents
(left pair of bars) were asked to choose between the cer-
tainty of 1 year of lifespan gain and a 2% chance of
10 years of lifespan gain which is equivalent to a life
expectancy increase of 0.2 years. For other respondents,
the probability offered was 5%, 10%, etc. For the respon-
dents offered 2% or 5% probability as the chance
option, choosing the chance option misses substantial
opportunity for life expectancy gain, as shown by grey
shading of columns. Conversely, for respondents offered
20% or 50% probability as the chance option, choosing
the certainty option misses an even larger opportunity
for lifespan gain, again shown by grey shading of
columns. As the probability offered increased, progres-
sively
more respondents
chose
the
chance
option.
Nevertheless, at each offered probability, many respon-
dents preferred the option that gave the shorter life
expectancy.
DISCUSSION
Current clinical practice examines risk over fixed time
windows that are typically much shorter than a healthy
individual’s life expectancy. Our present analysis, which
addresses entire lifespan, shows that for any cardiovascu-
lar risk factor profile, it is the younger individuals who
gain the most lifespan from initiation of primary preven-
tion therapy.
Second, our results show that although the great
majority gain no lifespan, the minority that do gain,
gain much more than the group average increase in life-
span. The spectrum of lifespan gain has a similar range
Figure 3
Distribution of lifespan for men initiating
preventative therapy (with a risk reduction of 30%) at the age
of 50, with national average blood pressure and national
average cholesterol. Each small square indicates one
representative individual taking a lifetime of preventative
therapy. For the individuals whose lifespans are longer with
medication, a bar is drawn whose height represents their
individual lifespan gain from medication: white columns
represent individuals who gain no extra lifespan, yellow
columns represent individuals who gain lifespan less than the
group mean gain, blue columns represent individuals who
gain an amount of lifespan similar to the group mean gain and
green columns represent individuals whose gain is more than
the group mean gain. The graph makes it clear that although
only a minority of the cohort (7%) gain any lifespan from a
lifetime of preventative therapy; nevertheless, this relatively
small group gain is much more (99 months) than the group
mean gain (7 months).
Figure 2
For any combination of cardiovascular risk factors, the lifespan gain from initiation of intervention decreases with
increasing age of initiation. Change in lifespan gain as age of initiation of therapy increases with differing baseline cardiovascular
risk in non-smokers (A) and smokers (B) taking a daily single-agent therapy—for example, a statin with 30% cardiovascular risk
reduction. Men are shown with square, filled data points, women with circular, unfilled data points.

 between low-risk and high-risk patients: the difference is
not in the size of lifespan in those that benefit but in
the proportion of patients who benefit.
Third, our survey indicates that, when presented with
probabilistic information, many individuals have a per-
sonal preference for certainty of a small gain or for a
chance of a large gain, not corresponding to which of
those is mathematically larger. This suggests that when
discussing benefit of preventative therapy with patients,
we might present lifespan gain both ways.
More gain despite lower risk? The age paradox
When discussing whether to initiate primary prevention
therapy, clinicians commonly counsel patients using
metrics such as estimated cardiovascular risk over a fixed
time window—for example, percentage risk of cardiovas-
cular disease over 10 years.1 However, treatment is not
intended for a fixed time window but for life. Although
older individuals tend to have higher estimated risk, it is
likely that initiation of primary prevention therapy in
younger individuals, whose estimated risk is lower but
who meet eligibility criteria, gives larger gains in life-
span. These results are based on the HR for cardiovascu-
lar event reduction calculated from meta-analysis of
randomised controlled trials of statins. Our calculations
use the Gompertz method to build in recognition that
non-cardiovascular mortality (not improved by statins)
will progressively rise with age, attenuating the overall
HR for mortality from statins. However, if statins were to
have a previously undescribed effect of increasing mor-
tality after prolonged use, our calculations would not be
valid. Few data with randomisation retained in the long
term do seem to suggest a sustained hazard reduction
while randomised to statin.20
A more complex issue is the impact of smoking. On
the one hand, smokers have a higher risk of cardiovas-
cular disease, which would tend to increase the gain
from
preventative
therapy.
On
the
other
hand,
smokers
have
a
higher
risk
of
death
from
non-
cardiovascular
disease,

cancer,

 would tend to decrease the gain from preventative
therapy. It is difficult to confidently quantify whether
preventative therapy adds more or less extra lifespan
in smokers than in non-smokers; therefore, our study
refrains from attempting to do so. Likewise, our study
addresses patients who have already been risk stratified
in whatever manner is considered cost-effective. For
example, this might be by demographic and physio-
logical measurements, or by newer technology such as
CT
calcium
scoring.
Whatever
the
stratification
process, there is no way to tell which individual among
many with the same risk level will die first, or which
individual
will
gain
the
most
from
preventative
therapy. Our paper addresses the uncertainty that
cannot be removed owing to cardiovascular mortality
possessing substantial inherent unpredictability within
individuals in the long term.
Treat all versus tailored approach
Our study has implications for the debate between offer-
ing treatment to all or spending resources on a tailored
approach for primary prevention. The lifetime risk of
cardiovascular disease for a man with average character-
istics is 37%.21 Some people may consider this a large
value and worthy of preventative steps. Others may con-
sider it too small. Our study indicates that individuals
will vary in their opinions and it would be worth asking
them their view individually.
Separately, modern technology may allow options
beyond demographic and physiological measures to
assess risk stratum. However, regardless of the method of
risk evaluation, there will remain inherent uncertainty in
the
actual
outcome
for
the
individual.
Our
study
addresses this irremovable uncertainty in individualised
medical practice.
Do people focus on average gain or maximum gain?
It is natural for healthcare provision planners to focus
on average gain from an intervention, as mathematically
this is the simplest summary. It has the desirable prop-
erty of consistently increasing if the probabilities stay the
same and the individual magnitudes increase, and also if
the individual magnitudes stay the same and the prob-
ability of benefit increases. It is the basis for indices such
as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) that are widely
used in healthcare economic planning.22 Our study is
not an economic analysis. It does not quantify dollar
costs or attempt to attach dollar values to the benefit of
having more life. This is because patients rarely decline
primary prevention at the outset on the basis of too
great financial cost to the healthcare system, nor too
little financial gain from intervention. Instead, our ana-
lysis focuses on dimensions widely understood and
brought up by patients—namely, magnitude of benefit
and chance of receiving it.
People do not always choose the option offering the
mathematically maximal average benefit.23 Our survey
illustrates that people often prefer a small chance of a
large benefit over the certainty of a small benefit, even
when the mathematical average gain from the former is
smaller. Similar phenomena are described in the fields
of behavioural economics and cognitive psychology
under
the
umbrella
of
prospect
theory.24
Taken
together, these insights have important implications for
the shared decision-making process for considering
primary prevention statin therapy.
Study limitations
Our calculation of lifespan gain is based on the relative
risk reduction for cardiovascular mortality from preventa-
tive medication being approximately the same across risk
groups and across ages. In particular, we have relied on

Open Heart: first published as 10.1136/openhrt-2015-000343 on 11 March 2016. Downloaded from 
 the observation from large-scale meta-analyses
25 of
statins
that
there
is
no
sign
that
patients
with
low-to-intermediate estimated cardiovascular risk have a
weaker hazard reduction. However, if there is any particu-
lar risk stratum in which cardiovascular mortality is
reduced to a different extent by medical intervention,
then our results would need to be modified.
Our analysis pays no regard to the possibility of
adverse
effects
of
therapy.
For
primary
prevention
statins, for example, there is a documented increase of
diagnosis of diabetes of approximately 0.5% which
partly counteracts the 0.5% decrease in absolute mortal-
ity, 1% decrease in myocardial infarction and 0.3%
decrease in strokes.26 In the longer term, it is conceiv-
able that the higher rate of diabetes could increase car-
diovascular
event
rates.
However,
even
the
longest
randomised controlled trials have shown nothing other
than continued reduction of cardiovascular event rates
in the statin arms, to the end of the randomised period
and beyond.27
We used contemporary mortality data for all age strata
to construct the life-table, but it should be remembered
that there has been a secular trend to falling mortality,28
which is likely to continue for many years to come.
Therefore, when people currently aged 50 eventually
reach the age of 80, they will be facing not the mortality
of current 80-year-olds (used in our life-tables) but a
future mortality which is likely to be lower. Thus, the
actual life-years gained for people starting preventative
therapy now will likely be larger than computed in our
life-tables.
Life
expectancy
and
cardiovascular
and
non-
cardiovascular mortality rates vary between countries.28
Therefore, our life-tables, built from the UK data, may
be slightly different in other geographies. We have previ-
ously provided full details of this method in an online
supplementary appendix to a previous publication.18
We have used the SCORE system to assess cardiovascu-
lar risk as suggested in current European Society of
Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. It is widely used in the UK
since it has been present in the British National
Formulary (equivalent to the American Physicians’ Desk
Reference) since September 2000. Any risk score system
can be criticised for not being representative of other
populations that may differ because of geography, or
because of secular changes that have occurred in the
time between system development and current applica-
tion. For example, in developed countries, age-specific
death rates from cardiovascular disease are falling, partly
from the widespread adoption of preventative steps, and
only the increasing population age is causing the abso-
lute
numbers
of
cardiovascular
deaths
to
remain
Figure 5
Patients’ preferences do not always match maximisation of lifespan. Respondents were randomly allocated to one of
five groups. Each respondent chose between the certainty of 1 year of lifespan gain and a % chance of 10 years of lifespan gain.
The different % chances offered to the five groups were 2%, 5%, 10%, 20% and 50%, respectively, equivalent to a mean life
expectancy increase of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 years. The bars show the proportion of respondents in each group choosing the
certainty option or the % chance option. We have shaded in grey the respondents who were choosing an option with lower mean
life expectancy. As the probability offered increased, progressively more respondents chose the % chance option. Nevertheless,
at each offered probability, many respondents preferred the option that gave the lower mean life expectancy (grey columns).

 constant. Nevertheless, in other countries, even age-
specific death rates from cardiovascular disease are still
in their rising phase. The principle of our study,
however, is applicable to any risk score that shows a grad-
ation of risk at each age and increasing risk with age.
In our survey, the participants are a convenience
sample from several places in one country only, which
limits its external validity. Moreover, it is possible that
persons in public places may differ from the true
general population in their relative preference between
certainty of small benefit and chance of large benefit.
We perceived that the advantages of high participation
might outweigh the statistical imperfection of a conveni-
ence sampling strategy. To encourage high participation,
we intentionally ensured that the survey was relatively
short and easy to complete. This focus on high participa-
tion prevented any simultaneous assessment of numer-
acy or educational level; therefore, we do not know
whether variation in numeracy in our survey participants
could have influenced our results. Further research to
confirm our findings might additionally address the
potential impact of numeracy on probabilistic presenta-
tion of lifespan benefit.
Our survey age spectrum was deliberately wide
because this study followed on from a previous study
in which we recognised that the lifespan gain from
choosing primary prevention is certainly no lower for
younger patients than older.18 If we had focused
entirely on older patients, we would have had less
ability to explore variation in preference across this
wide age spectrum.
Our model of the distribution of lifespan gain oper-
ates on the basis that there is a cohort of patients with
identical baseline risk and whose risk rises only with age,
with no other differentiating factors. A more complex
model could alternatively be constructed which would
include the counting of, for example, non-fatal events,
which might produce additional variables such as extra
lifespan free of cardiovascular events. While many non-
fatal events leave no long-term disability, some cause
long-term incapacitation by, for example, heart failure.
Degrees of reduction of long-term morbidity from
primary prevention are more difficult to quantify than
those of mortality but are likely to be approximately par-
allel given the nature of the disease process. On this
basis, if the benefit in morbidity and mortality could be
calculated, it would likely be larger than described here
and the proportion of people benefitting would be
larger.
CONCLUSIONS
Current practice is to advise patients whether to start
primary prevention therapy based on their cardiovascu-
lar risk over a fixed time horizon. Our results suggest an
opportunity to broaden this approach, since it suggests
that younger patients, despite having lower initial esti-
mated cardiovascular risk, may be in a position to gain
the most from extended primary prevention therapy.
Furthermore, our numerical analysis indicates that the
probability
distribution
of
expected
benefit
from
primary prevention therapy for individuals starting from
an identical baseline is far from uniform, consisting
instead of many who gain no extra lifespan plus a small
minority who gain a large extra lifespan gain (many
times greater than the group mean life expectancy
gain).
