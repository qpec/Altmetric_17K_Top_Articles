ABSTRACT
Background: The causal nature of associations between breakfast
and health remain unclear in obese individuals.
Objective: We sought to conduct a randomized controlled trial to
examine causal links between breakfast habits and components of
energy balance in free-living obese humans.
Design: The Bath Breakfast Project is a randomized controlled trial
with repeated measures at baseline and follow-up among a cohort in
South West England aged 21–60 y with dual-energy X-ray absorpti-
ometry–derived fat mass indexes of $13 kg/m2 for women (n = 15)
and $9 kg/m2 for men (n = 8). Components of energy balance (resting
metabolic rate, physical activity thermogenesis, diet-induced thermo-
genesis, and energy intake) were measured under free-living conditions
with random allocation to daily breakfast ($700 kcal before 1100) or
extended fasting (0 kcal until 1200) for 6 wk, with baseline and follow-
up measures of health markers (e.g., hematology/adipose biopsies).
Results: Breakfast resulted in greater physical activity thermogenesis
during the morning than when fasting during that period (difference:
188 kcal/d; 95% CI: 40, 335) but without any consistent effect on 24-h
physical activity thermogenesis (difference: 272 kcal/d; 95% CI:
2254, 798). Energy intake was not significantly greater with break-
fast than fasting (difference: 338 kcal/d; 95% CI: 2313, 988). Body
mass increased across both groups over time but with no treatment
effects on body composition or any change in resting metabolic rate
(stable within 8 kcal/d). Metabolic/cardiovascular health also did not
respond to treatments, except for a reduced insulinemic response to
an oral-glucose-tolerance test over time with daily breakfast relative
to an increase with daily fasting (P = 0.05).
Conclusions: In obese adults, daily breakfast leads to greater phys-
ical activity during the morning, whereas morning fasting results in
partial dietary compensation (i.e., greater energy intake) later in the
day. There were no differences between groups in weight change and
most health outcomes, but insulin sensitivity increased with breakfast
relative to fasting. This trial was registered at www.isrctn.org as
ISRCTN31521726.

INTRODUCTION
Despite strong public belief regarding the role of regular break-
fast in human health (1), most evidence linking the omission of
breakfast with negative health outcomes is based on cross-
sectional associations and prospective cohort studies (2–6). None-
theless, randomized controlled trials in free-living adults have
begun to question the causal nature of these links between break-
fast habits, components of energy balance, and health (7–15).
Many experimenters have compared different breakfast types,
informing conclusions regarding the effects of size or compo-
sition (8, 10, 16–19), as opposed to the fundamental contrast
between the presence or absence of morning feeding. Trials that
have investigated extended morning fasting represent a range of
experimental approaches—from translating the acute metabolic/
behavioral responses to fasting on a given morning or number of
days (7, 12, 13, 20–23) to studying the health effects of skipping
breakfast for weeks (11, 14) and ultimately the effect on body
mass of recommendations to skip breakfast for 4 mo (9). Our
recent work complemented these studies by examining the ef-
fects of extended morning fasting for 6 wk on all components of
energy balance and health in lean individuals (15). In particular,
we took advantage of free-living metabolic and behavioral
monitoring to provide the first report to our knowledge of
physical activity thermogenesis in response to breakfast, re-
vealing greater energy expenditure relative to morning fasting
but with little evidence of compensatory feeding later in the day.
It is important to note that it cannot be assumed that individual
components of energy balance would respond similarly in the
obese. Indeed, cross-sectional evidence in adolescent girls ques-
tions whether the relation between breakfast habits and physical
activity may be moderated by adiposity (24). Obese individuals are
more receptive to external cues to eat (25, 26) and display delayed
satiation (27), possibly in part because of reduced concentrations
of the satiety hormone peptide YY (28) and limited feeding-
induced suppression of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin (29, 30).

 Effective weight loss strategies are particularly relevant for
obese individuals, yet such strategies can potentially be misguided
if informed solely by the positive cross-sectional association
between breakfast omission and obesity (5) and reports that, for
example, 78% of successful dieters consume breakfast daily (31).
Emerging trials in the overweight/obese are crucial for informing
evidence-based weight loss strategies (9, 11, 32), with the largest
of these trials recently demonstrating no effect of breakfast
recommendations on weight loss (9). However, specific com-
ponents of energy balance such as physical activity/exercise can
affect disease and mortality risk independent of a net energy
surplus/deficit or changes in adiposity (33, 34). Our recent report
of daily breakfast compared with fasting affecting physical ac-
tivity energy expenditure occurred without noteworthy changes in
body mass in lean individuals (15). Considering the associations
between breakfast omission and disease risk (2–5), it is prudent
to establish whether these observations are causal and attribut-
able to mechanisms independent of body mass.
This randomized controlled trial examined a 6-wk period of
breakfast consumption or morning fasting and used assessments
of energy balance and health in an obese population. Consistent
with our previous report in lean individuals, we hypothesized that
physical activity thermogenesis would be lower when fasting dur-
ing the morning but that—unlike in lean individuals—extended
morning fasting would also result in compensatory energy intake.
METHODS
Experimental design
The Bath Breakfast Project (ISRCTN31521726) is a random-
ized controlled trial that compares the effects of daily breakfast con-
sumption relative to extended morning fasting on energy balance
and human health. The procedures followed were in accordance
with the protocol approved by the National Health Service South
West 3 Research Ethics Committee (10/H0106/13). This protocol
has since been published in full (15, 35), with trial enrollment,
baseline/eligibility testing, allocation, and follow-up all con-
ducted in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials guidelines (36). (See Supplemental Figure 1 for a Con-
solidated Standards of Reporting Trials flow diagram and
Supplemental Figures 2 and 3 for the precise details of this
protocol and the rationale for our approach/methods, re-
spectively.) As justified in our published protocol (35), w14
people in each treatment group were deemed necessary to confer
a 90% probability of detecting an increase in physical activity
energy expenditure of 646 kcal with use of a 2-tailed t test with
an a level of 0.05. Herein we report data for the obese cohort
from the Bath Breakfast Project, classified according to dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry-derived fat mass indexes of
$13 kg/m2 for women and $9 kg/m2 for men (37), for whom
recruitment and follow-up lasted from 28 August 2010 to 24 May
2013. Study participants were recruited from local advertising,
and invitations to participate were distributed to potentially el-
igible individuals via local general practice surgeries. Partici-
pating individuals did not receive any payment apart from any
travel costs incurred for attending laboratory visits and all met
the following inclusion criteria: aged 21–60 y; record of regular
menstrual cycle/contraceptive use (if relevant); no anticipated
changes in diet and/or physical activity habits during the study
period; weight stable (within 2% over past 6 mo); nonshift
workers; not pregnant or breastfeeding; and free from any other
condition or behavior deemed either to pose undue personal risk
or introduce bias into the experiment.
Baseline demographic and anthropometric characteristics of
those who completed the trial are presented in Table 1. This cohort
completed intensive laboratory-based assessments at baseline to
determine their resting metabolic rate (via indirect calorimetry
from gaseous exchange) and anthropometric characteristics, i.e.,
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic Discovery W); waist
and hip circumference (midpoint between the lowest rib and iliac
crest and the widest gluteal girth, respectively); and sagittal ab-
dominal height (with use of a Holtain-Kahn caliper at the iliac
crest). While participants remained in a 10-h overnight fast
(0900 6 1 h), a 15-mL blood sample was drawn from an antecubital
vein via an indwelling cannula to determine concentrations of
key systemic metabolites/hormones via commercially available
spectrophotometric assays (HDL/LDL cholesterol, triacylglycer-
ol, nonesterified fatty acids, glucose, and C-reactive protein from
Randox Laboratories) and ELISAs [IL-6, leptin, and adiponectin
from R&D Systems; triiodothyronine (free-T3) and thyroxine
(free-T4) from Alpco Diagnostics; total and acylated ghrelin from
Bertin Pharma; peptide YY and active glucagon-like peptide-1
from Millipore; and insulin from Mercodia]. A small (w1 g)
subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy was then sampled from the
abdomen to provide estimates of tissue-specific insulin action
(i.e., insulin-stimulated [U-14C]D-glucose uptake). Participants
then undertook an oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) that in-
volved ingesting 75 g glucose polymer in Polycal solution
(Nutricia) with 5 mL arterialized venous blood samples drawn at
baseline and every 15 min for 2 h after glucose ingestion from
a separate cannula fitted retrograde to a dorsal vein on the back of
the hand after warming for at least 15 min in a sealed box
(Medical Engineering Unit, University of Nottingham) containing
static air at 558C (38).
All previously described measures were followed up 6 wk
later, with free-living assessments of energy intake (estimated
from directly weighed food diaries) and energy expenditure
(combined heartrate/accelerometry) monitored by Actiheart
(CamNtech) throughout the first and last weeks of intervention,
along with continuous (5-min sampling interval) monitoring of
interstitial glucose concentrations via a subcutaneous abdominal
catheter (iPro; Medtronic) both to document chronic glycemic
responses and to verify compliance (neither the continuous
glucose monitoring system data nor food diary records provided
any evidence of noncompliance to either intervention in any
participants). During the intervening 4-wk period, participants
were not monitored. For estimating energy intake, participants
were provided with a set of food-weighing scales and trained by
the experimenters during enrollment on how to appropriately
record food intake. Packaging from preprepared items was kept
by participants for analysis by the research team with use of the
manufacturers’ information, with fresh foods input with use of
Compeat Pro 5 dietary analysis software (Nutrition Systems).
The Actiheart device for measuring energy expenditure is
a chest-mounted device that was worn at all times apart from
during water-based activities. This device uses heart rate and
accelerometry combined in a branched equation model to esti-
mate energy expenditure (39, 40) and has been shown to be
a valid measure of energy expenditure in a variety of laboratory

 and free-living settings (41–43). Eumenorrheic women provided
baseline samples 2 wk before the start of the 6-wk intervention
so that follow-up samples could be acquired 3–10 d after the
onset of menses (i.e., follicular phase). During the 6-wk interven-
tion, participants were randomly assigned (1:1 allocation ratio)
into either a group prescribed an energy intake of $700 kcal
before 1100 daily, with at least half consumed within 2 h of
waking (breakfast group), or a group to extend their overnight
fast by abstaining from ingesting energy-providing nutrients
(i.e., plain water only) until 1200 each day (fasting group). The
randomization scheme was generated with use of a computer-
based random-number generator and was stratified according to
baseline breakfast habits (block size = 4), with frequent break-
fast consumption defined as the ingestion of $50 kcal within
2 h of waking on most days of the week. The investigators
who enrolled participants were unaware of these details and in-
dependently requested group assignments to prevent deciphering
of the allocation sequence. Because of the self-administered
nature of the treatments, it was not possible to blind participants
to group allocation or to blind investigators for many outcomes
that either required direct interaction with nonblinded partici-
pants (e.g., anthropometry and metabolic rate) or in which
treatment allocation is immediately evident in the data (e.g., diet
records and continuous glucose monitoring). These same in-
vestigators then also shared responsibility for completing vari-
ous aspects of tissue and data analysis. The intervention was
applied under free-living conditions. All other lifestyle choices
were allowed to vary naturally. Compliance was confirmed via
self-report and verified via continuous glucose monitoring. Four
participants withdrew before baseline assessments (Supplemental
Figure 1); data reported herein are therefore only for those indi-
viduals for whom baseline and follow-up measurements were
available (i.e., a completers-only analysis).
Data analysis
The primary outcome measures comprehensively assessed
components of energy balance under free-living conditions,
which were averaged from the first and last week of intervention
and therefore expressed as simple summary statistics and an-
alyzed with use of either paired or independent t tests for
contrasts within and between groups, respectively. Secondary
outcomes included regulatory/mechanistic data and markers of
cardiovascular health and metabolic control at baseline and
follow-up, for which treatment 3 time interactions were ex-
plored with use of a mixed-model ANOVA. Most variables in
this experiment therefore involved a single comparison be-
tween 2 means and were not adjusted for multiple comparisons
across the different variables reported herein (44). However,
when multiple comparisons were made within a given variable
(i.e., physical activity thermogenesis was partitioned according
to intensity and time), a Holm-Bonferroni stepwise adjustment
was applied to prevent type I error rate inflation (45). Statis-
tical analyses were performed with use of SPSS version
22 (IBM), with statistical significance accepted at an a level of
P # 0.05. Values are means with SDs in text and tables and

RESULTS
Components of energy balance
Physical activity thermogenesis
Physical activity thermogenesis is illustrated in Figure 1 and
partitioned in Figure 2 to illustrate how and when this component
of energy expenditure was accumulated. There was a significantly
higher rate of physical activity thermogenesis in the breakfast
group than the fasting group before 1200 daily (435 6 132 kcal/d
compared with 247 6 171 kcal/d; P = 0.03) but no difference
after 1200 (756 6 135 kcal/d compared with 676 6 540 kcal/d;
P = 0.7), such that there was no consistent difference between
groups over the entire day (1221 6 261 kcal/d compared with
949 6 709 kcal/d; P = 0.3). There were also no differences in the
specific intensities of activity during any period of the day.
There were no differences between treatment groups in daily
recordings of median (range) waking times [breakfast group:
0739 (0652–0840); fasting group: 0717 (0632–1046)] or sleep-
ing times [breakfast group: 2255 (2227–0011); fasting group:
2312 (2155–0232)], such that mean sleep duration was similar
between the breakfast group (501 6 27 min/night) and the
fasting group (486 6 38 min/night).
Resting metabolic rate
Baseline assessments of the resting metabolic rate were not
different between the breakfast and fasting groups (1679 6 101
kcal/d compared with 1613 6 79 kcal/d, respectively). The
right-hand portion of Figure 1 presents follow-up data for
these respective groups (1679 6 106 kcal/d compared with
1605 6 91 kcal/d). The resting metabolic rate was therefore
stable within 8 kcal/d from baseline to follow-up, with no dif-
ference between groups in response to the intervention (P = 0.8).
Diet-induced thermogenesis
Based on established constants for the thermogenic effect of
each macronutrient reportedly ingested according to food diaries
(46), no difference in diet-induced thermogenesis was apparent
between groups (Figure 1). In accordance with the relative
similarity in energy intake and diet composition (see next section
and Figure 1), diet-induced thermogenesis was 220 6 55 kcal/d
in the breakfast group and 193 6 57 kcal/d in the fasting group
(P = 0.3).
Energy intake
The breakfast group reported ingesting 2719 6 683 kcal/d
relative to 2381 6 777 kcal/d reported by the fasting group
(P = 0.3). The left-hand portion of Figure 1 illustrates that there
were no differences in reported dietary macronutrient compo-
sition between the 2 groups, with all the data shown representing
the mean over the intervention period (i.e., the mean of week 1
and week 6) given that both groups reported a similar small re-
duction in energy intake from the first to the last week (time
effect: F = 4.9; P = 0.04), with the separate data for each period
reported in the Figure 1 legend.
Energy balance regulatory hormones
Thyroid hormones that regulate resting metabolic rate were
unresponsive to either treatment, with systemic concentrations of
FIGURE 1
Components of energy balance under free-living conditions with either the ingestion of $700 kcal before 1100 daily (breakfast group) or
abstinence from all energy-providing nutrients until at least 1200 daily (fasting group). Data are means with SE bars compared with use of independent t tests.
Estimated energy intake values for comparison of relative differences between groups are the mean of the first (breakfast, n = 11: 2820 6 595 kcal/d; fasting,
n = 11: 2459 6 780 kcal/d; P = 0.2) and last (breakfast, n = 11: 2618 6 833 kcal/d; fasting, n = 11: 2303 6 792 kcal/d; P = 0.4) weeks of intervention, for
which a loss of data was caused by a loss of diet record. Resting metabolic rate values (breakfast group, n = 11; fasting group, n = 11) were data-recorded at
follow-up, with 1 individual unable to complete the follow-up resting metabolic rate collection. Diet-induced thermogenesis values (breakfast group, n = 11;
fasting group, n = 11) were estimated from reported energy intake, for which a loss of data was caused by a loss of diet record. Physical activity values are the
mean of the first (breakfast, n = 9: 1204 6 322 kcal/d; fasting, n = 10: 997 6 887 kcal/d; P = 0.5) and last (breakfast, n = 9: 1238 6 220 kcal/d; fasting, n = 10:
902 6 543 kcal/d; P = 0.1) week of intervention.

 triiodothyronine (free-T3) and thyroxine (free-T4) closely matched
between treatments at baseline and follow-up (Table 2). Similarly,
a range of hormones implicated in the regulation of appetite and
energy balance also did not differ in response between treat-
ments. Table 2 presents fasted concentrations of leptin, total
ghrelin, acylated ghrelin, peptide YY, active glucagon-like
peptide-1, and adiponectin, all of which displayed no significant
treatment 3 time interactions, although there was a tendency
toward an interaction effect for leptin (P = 0.06).
Health risk factors
Anthropometric factors
Body mass increased from pre- to postintervention (0.6 kg;
95% CI: 0.1, 1.1 kg) when all participants from both groups were
considered (F = 6.3; P = 0.02). The absolute change was greater
in the breakfast group (1.0 kg; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.7 kg) compared
with the fasting group (0.2 kg; 95% CI: 20.5, 1.0 kg) but with
no interaction between treatment and time (F = 2.2; P = 0.15).
None of the measures of body composition was differently af-
fected by the interventions (Table 1).
Cardiovascular health
None of the cardiovascular disease risk factors presented in
Table 2 responded differently between groups to the intervention
(all P . 0.1). There was an increase in total and LDL cholesterol
concentrations across both groups from pre- to postintervention
(both P , 0.03).
Metabolic control
Fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin concentrations did
not change over time (both P . 0.3), with no evidence of
a treatment 3 time interaction (both P . 0.6) (Table 2). Both
Matsuda and HOMA indexes of insulin sensitivity were not
different over time (P . 0.3), with no evidence of an interaction
(P . 0.5). Glycemic response to the OGTT was unaffected by
either intervention (P . 0.17). There were no main effects of
treatment or time (i.e., baseline follow-up) on insulin in-
cremental AUC (both P . 0.3), but there was a significant
treatment 3 time interaction with an increase in the fasting group
from baseline relative to a decrease in the breakfast group
from pre- to postintervention (P = 0.05) (Figure 3).
The rates of adipose tissue-specific glucose uptake obtained in
these individuals is displayed in Figure 4. There was a main
effect of insulin (F = 23; P , 0.001) but no main effects of
treatment, time, or any interaction of these effects (all P .
0.05). For context, the obese population reported herein had
much lower insulin-stimulated glucose uptake than the lean
population we reported previously (15), particularly with max-
imal (supraphysiologic) insulin stimulation. Because of these
very low absolute rates of glucose uptake/responsiveness to in-
sulin, the index of adipose tissue insulin sensitivity we pre-
viously calculated in lean individuals could not be used for
these data.
Subcutaneous glucose was monitored continuously at 5-min
intervals throughout the first and last week of intervention. Mean
and peak glucose concentrations from waking until 1200 and
from 1200 until sleep were similar between groups at baseline
and over time, and there was thus no difference in response to
the intervention between groups. The nocturnal glycemic control
data from the continuous glucose monitoring system in 5 in-
dividuals contained implausibly stable periods at the lower ex-
tremity of the physiologic/detectable range (2.2–2.5 mmol/L),
although only for ,10% of measurements from these in-
dividuals. When this occurred for more than 4 consecutive
measurements (.15 min), these data were removed (this did not
affect the conclusions drawn). Nocturnal (sleeping) peak values
did not differ between groups (breakfast group: 7.0 6 1.4;
fasting group: 7.3 6 1.1 mmol/L), but there was a main effect of
treatment reflecting lower mean overnight glucose concentra-
tions in the breakfast group than the fasting group across the first
and last week of intervention (breakfast group: 4.9 6 0.5;
fasting group: 5.4 6 0.6 mmol/L; F = 4.4; P = 0.05).

 continuously monitored glucose data are available for individual
patients (47). This measure did not reveal any differences be-
tween groups over time or in response to the intervention between
groups from waking until 1200 and from 1200 until sleep or
nocturnally. Equally, none of these variability, mean, or peak
glucose values varied over the full 24-h period.
DISCUSSION
This is the first experiment to our knowledge to measure all
components of energy balance and selected markers of metabolic
control and cardiovascular disease risk in response to daily
morning fasting compared with breakfast consumption for 6 wk
in healthy obese individuals. Four key findings from this study
were that there was 1) no difference in reported total energy
intake between interventions, indicative that those fasting during
the morning at least partially compensated for the $700 kcal
deficit imposed; 2) lower physical activity thermogenesis in
those fasting before 1200 than in those who consumed breakfast;
3) similar blood lipid, appetite regulatory hormone, and
C-reactive protein responses to the intervention between groups
but with a decreased insulinemic response to an OGTT in those
consuming breakfast relative to an increase in those extending
their fast; and 4) no evidence that the omission of breakfast had
any effect on body weight.
Energy intake in those who habitually skip breakfast has been
reported in cross-sectional studies to be similar (31, 48) and lower
than those regularly consuming breakfast (6, 49). Experimental
evidence in individuals omitting breakfast without a prescribed
daily energy deficit has also produced conflicting results, with
greater (14), similar (13) and lower intake (7) in those missing
breakfast. Our previous study examined the same interventions as
reported herein in lean individuals (15). In contrast to the current
data, that experiment revealed that individuals assigned to
morning fasting had considerably lower energy intake than those
consuming breakfast, with minimal dietary compensation through-
out the rest of the day.
When attempting to reconcile our results with the extant lit-
erature, it is possible differences in the extent to which breakfasts
were prescribed may account for some of the discrepancy. Two of

 the studies previously mentioned allowed ad libitum intake of
breakfast and foods throughout the day (7, 13), whereas Farshchi
et al. (14) prescribed identical foods consumed at 0800 in the
breakfast condition or delayed until 1100 in the no-breakfast
condition, with scheduled meal patterns/composition. In our
experiment, individuals in the breakfast group were required to
consume $700 kcal by 1100 in the breakfast condition. The
impact of differing energy intake at breakfast during free living
has not been well-investigated, although work by Martin et al.
(18) established that free-living energy intake in lean men was
greater when consuming a 700-kcal than a 100-kcal breakfast.
This is contrary to the current data and therefore may indicate
a modifying effect of weight status on energy intake during
breakfast/morning fasting.
Reeves et al. (7) reported lower energy intake with morning
fasting in lean and overweight/obese individuals who in
a crossover design both ate and skipped breakfast for 7 d.
However, this was a pooled effect, and the difference in over-
weight/obese individuals (w60 kcal) was less pronounced than
in lean individuals (w265 kcal). This finding is consistent with
the interpretation that obese individuals display greater com-
pensation for a morning caloric deficit than lean counterparts.
Reasons for greater reported dietary compensation with in-
creasing adiposity are not immediately apparent, although it
should be noted that underreporting of energy intake is greater in
the obese (50). Despite this, there is no reason to suspect that
underreporting should occur to a greater extent in either ex-
perimental (i.e., breakfast or fasting) group (51).
In this study, obese individuals undertaking daily morning
fasting displayed lower physical activity expenditure before
1200. This finding verifies our earlier observation in lean in-
dividuals that physical activity energy expenditure is specifically
most affected during the period in which energy intake is re-
stricted (15), a finding also consistent with evidence of lower
physical activity in the morning in adolescents that skip breakfast
more frequently (52). The precise reasons for lesser morning
physical activity expenditure when fasting remain to be
established but may be related to perceptions of lethargy and/or
expectations relating to physical activity readiness. In the future
it would be informative to use subjective markers of energy
throughout the day [e.g., the subjective vitality scale (53)] with
breakfast and fasting regimens. In contrast to our previous
findings in lean individuals (15) in which a greater overall effect
of breakfast was apparent (442 kcal/d; 95% CI: 34, 851), total
daily physical activity thermogenesis was not significantly higher
when consuming breakfast among this obese population
(272 kcal/d; 95% CI: 2254, 798). This study was powered to
detect an effect sufficient to produce a net negative energy
balance, and because the magnitude of difference was far less
than the energy directly provided by breakfast, it was not
deemed statistically significant. Although even a small increase
in physical activity may be associated with positive health
outcomes independent of energy balance, the difference in en-
ergy expenditure we previously reported in lean individuals was
w60% greater than reported herein, which mirrors the lack of
difference in overall energy intake in obese individuals. There-
fore, responses of individual components of energy balance to
fasting may be generally less marked with greater adiposity.
The measurement of greater physical activity energy expen-
diture during the morning when breakfast is consumed is unlikely
to be attributable simply to tachycardia after feeding because
480 kcal of mixed macronutrients resulted in elevations of only
w5 beats/min in lean and obese women (54). Moreover, even
elevations in heart rate alone cannot account for the differences
in energy expenditure (particularly at light intensity) measured
in this study because the branched model used by the Actiheart
device weights energy expenditure estimates heavily toward
accelerometry unless the heart rate is substantially above rest. In

 addition, the reported energy intake of the fasting group from
midday onward was w550 kcal greater than that of the breakfast
group, further supporting that energy expenditure measured with
use of this device is not predicated on an acutely increased heart
rate after meals. Although it is possible this effect on physical
activity may have been caused by the behavior of eating,
cooking activities span the range of 2.5–3.5 metabolic equiva-
lents (55), so the potential energetic contribution would have
been small (w50–75 kcal), even assuming a generous 30-min
food preparation period substituted for complete rest when
fasting.
Blood lipid concentrations were not different between in-
terventions in this cohort. This differs from the findings of
Farshchi et al. (14), who reported increased systemic LDL and
total cholesterol concentrations after 2 wk of breakfast omission
in lean women. That effect was attributed to reduced stimulation
of hydroxyl methyl glutaryl-Co-A reductase by insulin given that
the insulinemic response to a mixed-meal challenge was lower
after breakfast consumption. Similar to that study, herein we
report an interaction for the insulin AUC in response to the OGTT
such that insulinemia decreased in those consuming breakfast
relative to an increase in those extending their fast (indicating
reduced insulin sensitivity in those that fasted). However,
HOMA-IR and Matsuda composite insulin sensitivity index
measures of insulin sensitivity and insulin-stimulated glucose
uptake into isolated adipocytes were unchanged. It remains to be
established whether these examples of specific responses to meal
challenges will translate into ecologically relevant benefits in
response to repeated mixed-meal ingestion.
In view of the public perception that breakfast consumption
facilitates weight management (1), it is paradoxical that 10 of the
11 individuals in the breakfast group gained weight (1.0 kg; 95%
CI: 0.2, 1.7 kg). Although in the absence of a significant treatment
3 time interaction for body mass it cannot be concluded that
daily breakfast causes weight gain, it is clear that ensuring the
overnight fast is broken upon waking does not cause weight loss
in a free-living setting. This interpretation is consistent with
a large 16-wk intervention that recommended breakfast con-
sumption or fasting until 1100 daily in overweight/obese in-
dividuals (9), so the conclusion that breakfast per se is not
causally related to weight change is not specific to the precise
nature of our intervention. Therefore, caution should be exer-
cised when considering recommendations that advocate
breakfast in general for the purpose of weight loss in obese
individuals. However, it remains to be established whether
breakfasts of specific composition could better target weight
management, but data such as reported herein may provide the
understanding necessary to target mechanisms that would best
allow this (e.g., by enhancing/limiting compensatory responses
to breakfast/fasting, respectively).
To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence from
a randomized controlled trial that sustained daily breakfast
omission affects some indexes of insulin sensitivity in healthy
obese individuals and adds to the body of evidence that breakfast
consumption can maintain insulin sensitivity (14) and glycemic
control (15) in lean individuals and that greater breakfast quantity
can improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (10, 56). It is
therefore important to recognize that randomized controlled trials
in a variety of populations have demonstrated health benefits of
breakfast consumption beyond mere weight management. With
this in mind, there is a need for the popular media, health pro-
fessionals, and public health messages to discriminate between
the effects (or potential lack thereof) of breakfast consumption on
body weight and the substantiated role for regular breakfast
consumption in influencing other aspects of health.
In summary, we conclude that neither overall energy intake nor
physical activity is different in obese individuals fasting during
the morning or consuming a daily breakfast for 6 wk. However,

nutrients until at least 1200 daily (fasting group, n = 10), for which missing data resulted from insufficient adipose tissue obtained from the biopsy. Data are

 differences in the distribution of physical activity throughout
the day were apparent, with lower physical activity during the
morning in response to fasting. Resting metabolic rate and blood
lipid profiles were not differently affected by breakfast or fasting,
although there was some evidence of breakfast omission reducing
insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, regular daily breakfast did not
facilitate weight loss.
