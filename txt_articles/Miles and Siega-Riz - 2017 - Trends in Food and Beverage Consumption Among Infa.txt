Consumption Among Infants 
and Toddlers: 2005–2012

abstract
BACKGROUND: Nutritional guidance for infants and toddlers is lacking, and the diets of 
American children in the first 2 years of life are not well characterized.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the NHANES were used to describe the diets of 0- to 
23-month-olds in the United States. Participants with complete dietary data were eligible 
for the analysis (N = 2359). Linear regression models were constructed to identify changes 
from 2005 to 2008 and from 2009 to 2012 in food and beverage consumption, both overall 
and within sociodemographic groups.
RESULTS: We observed several trends toward meeting early-feeding recommendations, 
such as a decline in the prevalence of complementary feeding among 0- to 5-month-olds. 
However, the prevalence of vegetable consumption was consistently lower than desired 
(∼25% of 6- to 11-month-olds and 20% of 12- to 23-month-olds had no reported vegetable 
consumption on dietary recall days in the 2009–2012 set). Subgroup analyses revealed 
that some trends were limited to certain populations (eg, a decline in juice consumption 
was observed among 6- to 11-month-old non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks 
but not among Mexican Americans), and additional trends emerged within groups (eg, 
the prevalence of breast milk consumption declined among 0- to 5-month-old Mexican 
Americans).
CONCLUSIONS: Although there have been some improvements in the diets of 0- to 23-month-
olds in recent years, there are areas in which this population continues to fall short of 
current recommendations. This underscores the need for additional policy guidance for 
providers and education for parents and caretakers on helping infants and toddlers achieve 
healthy diets.

A growing body of research 
suggests early feeding habits 
influence diet and health later in 
life. The establishment of food 
preferences begins during infancy 
and toddlerhood, and factors such as 
exposure to breast milk, the timing 
of introduction to solids, and types 
of first foods offered are believed 
to play important roles in laying 
the foundation for healthy eating 
habits.1 Furthermore, evidence 
from both observational studies and 
intervention trials suggest that early 
diet is linked to immune function 
and weight status during childhood 
as well as cardiometabolic health 
into adulthood.2 
– 
6 Despite these 
potentially far-reaching effects, 
nutritional guidance for children 
during the first 2 years of life has 
been limited.
Currently, the early-feeding 
recommendations set forth by the 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) are among the most 
comprehensive for children ages 0 to 
23 months in the United States.7 For 
example, the AAP recommendations 
include the following regarding food 
and beverage consumption in the first 
2 years of life: exclusive breastfeeding 
for the first 6 months, consumption 
of appropriate complementary 
foods after 6 months of age, offering 
vegetables and/or fruits with every 
meal and snack, offering water and 
nonflavored whole milk or 2% milk 
as beverages for children ages 12 
months to 2 years, and delaying juice 
introduction until 12 months.
Efforts to provide broader nutritional 
guidance for 0- to 23-month-olds are 
underway.8 Specifically, the 2020 
Edition of the Dietary Guidelines for 
America will include guidance for 
children younger than 2 years for the 
first time since the initial report was 
issued in 1980. However, additional 
research characterizing the current 
feeding habits of infants and toddlers 
is needed to inform specific guidance 
for this age group. The current study 
adds to the literature describing the 
early feeding habits of American 
infants and young toddlers9 
– 
18 by 
examining recent trends in food and 
beverage consumption among 0- to 
23-month-olds using data from the 
NHANES.
MeThODs
We investigated temporal trends in 
the prevalence of food and beverage 
consumption among infants and 
young toddlers in the United States 
by using NHANES dietary recall 
data collected between 2005 and 
2012. The NHANES’ analytic and 
data-collection methods have been 
described elsewhere and were 
approved by the National Center 
for Health Statistics Research Ethics 
Review Board.19, 
 
20 In brief, the 
NHANES is a surveillance program 
administered by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention to 
monitor the health and nutrition of 
noninstitutionalized Americans of 
all ages.19 Information is obtained 
from a nationally representative 
sample of the population through a 
series of questionnaires and physical 
examinations. What We Eat in 
America (WWEIA), the dietary intake 
component of the NHANES, consists 
of two 24-hour dietary recalls 
conducted by trained interviewers. 
For children ages 6 years and 
younger, dietary recall interviews 
are completed by adults who are 
knowledgeable about the children’s 
feeding. Each food and liquid reported 
in WWEIA is assigned a code from 
the Food and Nutrient Database 
for Dietary Studies (FNDDS), which 
contains detailed descriptions and 
nutritional information for more than 
7000 foods and beverages and is 
updated biannually to reflect changes 
in the US food supply.
We linked data from WWEIA to the 
version of the FNDDS corresponding 
to the survey cycle (ie, 2005–2006 
WWEIA data were linked to FNDDS 
3, 2007–2008 WWEIA data were 
linked to FNDDS 4.1, and so on) to 
categorize food and beverage items 
consumed by participants <2 years 
old.21 
– 
24 To facilitate cross-study 
comparisons, we used previous 
research to identify age-appropriate 
food and beverage categories for this 
population.11, 
 
18, 
 
25 Consistent with 
this literature, food mixtures (eg, 
pizza, sandwiches) were considered 
a single food item instead of broken 
down into their component parts. 
Consumption was defined as any 
reported intake, regardless of 
amount, on at least 1 recall day 
unless otherwise noted.
All analyses were performed in 
Statistical Analysis System version 
9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) 
using survey procedures to produce 
nationally representative estimates 
and account for the NHANES’ 
complex sampling design. Children 
who had not yet reached their 
second birthday by the time of the 
dietary data collection and had 2 
dietary recall interviews completed 
on their behalf were eligible for the 
study (N = 2359). We pooled data 
over 2 survey cycles to obtain an 
adequate sample size for subgroup 
analyses.26 Therefore, a combined 
dietary sample weight was calculated 
to properly estimate SEs. Rao-
Scott χ2 tests27 (for categorical 
variables) and t tests (for continuous 
variables) were performed to 
identify changes over time in the 
distribution of demographic and 
anthropometric characteristics 
of 0- to 23-month-olds in the 
United States. Multivariable linear 
regression models were constructed 
to estimate the prevalence of food 
and beverage consumption from 
2005 to 2008 and from 2009 to 
2012 and identify changes over time 
within the following age groups: 
0 to 5 months, 6 to 11 months, 
and 12 to 23 months. In subgroup 
analyses, we examined trends within 
the 3 largest racial/ethnic groups 
(Mexican Americans, non-Hispanic 
whites, and non-Hispanic blacks) 
and among children participating in

the Supplemental Nutrition Program 
for Women, Infants, and Children 
(WIC). Prevalence estimates were 
adjusted for mother’s age at birth 
and household income-to-poverty 
ratio (a measure used to determine 
eligibility for many federal programs, 
including WIC)28 to account for 
demographic and economic shifts in 
the US population occurring during 
the study period.29,

ResulTs
The demographic characteristics 
of the study population remained 
relatively unchanged between 2005 
to 2008 and 2009 to 2012 (Table 1).  
However, the proportion of 0- to 
23-month-olds falling below the 
fifth percentile of weight-for-length 
decreased, and the proportion falling 
above the 85th percentile increased 
during this period.
young Infants (0- to 5-Month-Olds)
In general, the prevalence of breast 
milk and infant formula consumption 
remained stable among 0- to 
5-month-olds: more than one-third of 
young infants consumed breast milk, 
but infant formula remained the most 
commonly consumed milk type for 
this age group (Table 2). However, 
the percentage of Mexican Americans 
in this age group who consumed 
breast milk was 36.4% in 2009–2012 
compared with 50.5% in 2005–2008 
(P = .03; data not shown).
As shown in Fig 1, complementary 
feeding (ie, consumption of foods or 
beverages other than breast milk and 
infant formula) declined more than 
10% among all 0- to 5-month-olds 
(from 50.4% to 39.6%; P = .04). The 
prevalence of solid food consumption 
in particular decreased from 
41.8% in 2005–2008 to 29.6% in 
2009–2012 (P = .008). These trends 
were largely driven by declines 
in the prevalence of infant cereal 
consumption (the most commonly 
consumed food in this age group) and 
fruit juice consumption.
Older Infants (6- to 11-Month-
Olds) and young Toddlers (12- to 
23-Month-Olds)
 
Table 3 summarizes foods and 
beverages consumed by older 
infants and young toddlers across 6 
overarching categories: milk, fruit 
and fruit juice, vegetables, other 
(nonmilk) protein sources, grains

(including sweetened beverages). 
Similar to young infants, formula was 
the most commonly consumed milk 
type among 6- to 11-month-olds. 
However, more than 20% of infants 
in this age group in the 2005–2008 
set and nearly 15% in the 2009–2012 
set consumed cow’s milk on a typical 
day. Whole-fat cow’s milk was the 
most commonly consumed milk 
type among 12- to 23-month-olds. 
However, a substantial proportion of 
children in this age group consumed 
reduced-fat cow’s milk in both 2005–
2008 and 2009–2012 (32.3% and 
26.2%, respectively).
Older infants and young toddlers 
also consumed a variety of foods 
and nonmilk beverages, and their 
food group consumption patterns 
were generally similar in both time 
periods. Apples and bananas were the 
most popular fruit varieties. Deep-
yellow vegetables were the most 
commonly consumed vegetable type 
for 6- to 11-month-olds, whereas 
white potatoes were the most 
popular among 12- to 23-month-olds. 
Dark-green vegetables were the 
least commonly consumed vegetable 
type in both age groups. The 
percentage of 6- to 23-month-olds 
consuming any fruit or vegetable 
on a typical day remained relatively 
unchanged between 2005–2008 
(6- to 11-month-olds: 91.3%; 
12- to 23-month-olds: 96.0%) and 
2009–2012 (6- to 11-month-olds: 
93.8%; 12- to 23-month-olds: 
96.2%). However, the proportion 
of older infants and young toddlers 
consuming fruits and vegetables on 
both intake days was lower in both 
time periods. For example, 52.6% of 
6- to 11-month-olds and 57.8% of 12- 
to 23-month-olds had any reported 
consumption of fruit on both recall 
days in 2009–2012. The percentage 
of 6- to 11-month-olds and 12- to 
23-month-olds who consumed 
vegetables on both recall days in 
2009–2012 was 42.7% and 42.3%, 
respectively.
There were a few notable changes 
in fruit, fruit juice, and vegetable 
consumption among older infants 
and young toddlers. The prevalence 
of 100% fruit juice consumption 
declined among 6- to 11-month-
olds such that less than half had any 
reported intake during the later  
time period (the prevalence was 
60.2% in 2005–2008 and 47.7%  
in 2009–2012; P = .02). Similarly,  
a decline from 74.7% to 60.3%  
(P = .01) was observed among older 
infants participating in WIC, who 
had a higher prevalence of fruit 
juice consumption than infants in 
this age group overall. Among 12- to 
23-month-olds, the percentage of 
children consuming canned or frozen 
fruit decreased by more than 10% 
(from 37.0% to 26.2%; P = .01) as 
shown in Table 3. The prevalence of 
dark-green vegetable consumption 
also decreased by more than 50% in 
this age group (from 15.3% to 7.5%; 
P = .02); a 1-year-old was more likely 
to consume fried white potatoes on 
an average day in 2009–2012. There 
were also changes in the vegetable 
consumption habits of WIC-enrolled 
toddlers: consumption of white 
potatoes declined from 56.1% in 
2005–2008 to 43.4% in 2009–2012 
(P = .03), and consumption of other 
starchy vegetables declined from 
28.1% to 15.7% (P < .05) in the same 
period.
Consumption of meat and other 
(nonmilk) protein sources and grains 
and grain products was prevalent 
among 12- to 23-month-olds and, 
to a lesser extent, among 6- to 
11-month-olds (Table 3). Protein 
from mixed dishes was consistently 
the most popular protein source 
among older infants, although 
their consumption of foods in this 
category declined by 13.3% between 
2005–2008 and 2009–2012 (P = 
.03). No changes were observed in 
the consumption of grains and grain 
products among 6- to 11-month-
olds or protein consumption among 
12- to 23-month-olds. However, the 
percentage of young toddlers with 
any reported consumption of breads, 
rolls, and quick breads (2005–2008: 
55.2%; 2009–2012: 44.4%; P < .05)

as well as grains in mixed dishes 
(2005–2008: 86.3%; 2009–2012: 
78.3%; P = .04) decreased over the 
study period.
The percentage of 6- to 11-month-
olds consuming snacks, desserts, or 
sweetened beverages on a typical day 
declined from 62.0% in 2005–2008 
to 50.5% in 2009–2012 (P < .05), but 
the prevalence remained relatively 
unchanged among 12- to 23-month-
olds. There was a marked decline 
in consumption of infant cookies, 
teething biscuits, and animal crackers 
in both age groups: the prevalence 
decreased by 17.0% among 6- to 
11-month-olds (P < .001) and 12.2% 
among 12- to 23-month-olds (P = 
.007). Additionally, the percentage 
of older infants consuming other 
types of cookies (2005–2008: 23.0%; 
2009–2012: 12.5%; P = .006) and 
the percentage of young toddlers 
consuming other sweets such as 
milk flavorings (2005–2008: 30.5%; 
2009–2012: 19.9%; P = .001) 
decreased over the study period.
Some trends in food and beverage 
consumption among 6- to 23-month-
olds were limited to certain racial/
ethnic groups (Table 4). Among 6- to 
11-month-olds, the decline in the 
prevalence of fruit juice consumption 
was observed among non-Hispanic 
whites and non-Hispanic blacks but 
not Mexican Americans. Additionally, 
the decline in the percentage of 
12- to 23-month-olds consuming 
breads, rolls, and quick breads was 
not consistent across racial/ethnic 
groups: the prevalence decreased 
among non-Hispanic whites but 
increased among Mexican Americans. 
Furthermore, the decline in the 
percentage of 12- to 23-month-
olds consuming other sweets was 
only observed among non-Hispanic 
whites.
Moreover, trends that were not 
observed in the overall population 
emerged within racial/ethnic groups. 
As shown in Table 4, there was an 
increase in the prevalence of any  
fruit consumption among 6- to 
11-month-old Mexican Americans 
(from 77.6% to 88.4%; P < .05) and 
12- to 23-month-old non-Hispanic 
blacks (from 71.9% to 84.2%;  
P = .02) over the study period. On 
the other hand, the prevalence of 
vegetable consumption in the latter 
group decreased (from 87.1% to 
74.1%; P < .05), and the percentage 
of 12- to 23-month-old Mexican 
Americans consuming any whole 
fruits or vegetables on a typical day 
also declined (from 97.4% to 89.9%; 
P = .02). Additionally, the percentage 
of 6- to 11-month-old non-Hispanic 
whites consuming mixed pasta 
dishes more than doubled from 8.9% 
in 2005–2008 to 22.7% in 2009–
2012 (P = .04). Other downward 
trends that emerged among 12- to 
23-month-olds include the following: 
the prevalence of ham and pork 
consumption among non-Hispanic 
blacks (from 39.3% to 16.7%; 
P = .007); mixed protein dishes 
(from 90.7% to 79.1%; P = .03) 
and carbonated soda (from 39.3% 
to 21.7%; P = .003) consumption 
among Mexican Americans; and 
consumption of ice cream, frozen 
yogurt, and pudding among non-
Hispanic whites (from 33.5% to 
22.4%; P < .05).
DIscussIOn
In this study, we used 2005–2012 
data from the NHANES to describe 
the foods and beverages consumed 
by infants and young toddlers 
in the United States. Similar to 
previous studies, 
11 we estimated 
that nearly 60% of 0- to 5-month-
olds do not consume any breast 
milk. Additionally, we reported a 
decline in the prevalence of breast 
milk consumption among Mexican 
Americans. Continued public health 
efforts are needed to achieve 
broad, public awareness of the 
many benefits of breastfeeding.32 
Additionally, more support 
structures are needed in hospitals, 
communities, and workplaces to 
promote breastfeeding initiation and 
to make continued breastfeeding 
more feasible for new mothers.

We observed a decrease in the 
consumption of complementary 
feeding, including solid food 
consumption, among 0- to 5-month-
olds, which aligns with the AAP 
recommendations. Yet, more than 
38% of 3-month-olds, 64% of 
4-month-olds, and 75% of 5-month-
olds consumed foods or beverages 
other than breast milk or formula on 
a typical day in 2009–2012. Previous 
research suggests parental concerns 
about infant hunger and conflicting 
messages from health care providers 
about optimal timing of introduction 
to solids may be among the reasons 
mothers introduce solid foods to 
infants before 6 months.33
Our findings also suggest a 
nontrivial percentage of young 
toddlers, particularly in some racial/
ethnic groups (eg, non-Hispanic 
blacks), may not be meeting the 
AAP recommendation for fruit or 
vegetable consumption with every 
meal and snack. Furthermore, the 
sources of vegetable consumption 
among young children may be 
suboptimal: a 1-year-old was 
more likely to consume fried white 
potatoes than dark-green vegetables 
on an average day. This warrants 
attention because fried white 
potatoes are among the top  
sources of saturated fat in the 
American diet.34 Another cause for 
concern is the percentage of 6- to 
11-month-olds who consume cow’s 
milk given the evidence linking this 
practice to iron deficiency during 
infancy.35
There were several positive changes 
in the beverage consumption 
habits of 6- to 23-month-olds. 
Fruit juice consumption decreased 
among 6- to 11-month-old non-
Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic 
whites, and infants enrolled in WIC. 
Furthermore, there was a decline 
in soda consumption among 12- to 
23-month-old Mexican Americans. 
This is especially noteworthy given 
the high prevalence of obesity 
among Mexican American youth.36 
However, the finding that more 
than 50% of all young toddlers have 
daily consumption of sweetened 
beverages is troubling. Not only are 
sweetened beverages outside of the 
AAP recommendations for children 
in this age group, but research 
suggests consumption of sugar-
sweetened beverages in early life 
is associated with greater intake of 
these beverages and increased odds 
of obesity later in childhood.5, 
 
6, 
 
37, 
38
The first 2 years of life are critical 
for setting the stage for diet and 
health throughout the life course. 
Flavors introduced and foods 
consumed during this period will 
influence later food intake.1 A recent 
prospective study found evidence 
of a link between consumption of

fruits, vegetables, and sweetened 
beverages during infancy and intake 
levels at age 6 years.38, 
 
39 Therefore, 
additional guidance is needed to help 
young children make the transition 
from a milk-based diet to one 
consisting primarily of family foods. 
Research is particularly needed to 
understand the factors that influence 
parents’ early-feeding decisions, the 
challenges they experience during 
this transition period and beyond, 
and how providers and society can 
better support them in following AAP 
or other national recommendations. 
In the absence of federal policy 
guidance and programmatic efforts 
targeting this age group, health 
care providers play a key role in 
helping parents make appropriate 
choices for feeding infants and 
young toddlers. Providers should 
educate parents on the importance 
of modeling healthy food choices as 
well as assess early-feeding habits, 
offer clear messaging about optimal 
timing of introduction to solid 
foods, discourage consumption of 
sweetened beverages, encourage 
fruit and vegetable intake, suggest 
strategies to increase variety in 
the types of vegetables consumed, 
and discuss common early-feeding 
challenges (eg, food rejection).
This study provides the most 
recent description of the food and 
beverage consumption habits of all 
0- to 23-month-olds in the United 
States. Furthermore, because we 
report estimates adjusted for 
maternal age at birth and poverty 
status, the trends reported may not 
be fully explained by demographic 
changes that occurred in the United 
States during the study period. 
However, these findings should 
be interpreted with some caution 
given the limited research validating 
dietary assessment methods in 
infants and young toddlers and the 
tendency for parents to overreport 
energy intake for children in this age 
group.40 This may have resulted in 
an overestimation of the prevalence 
of consumption in some food or 
beverage categories, especially 
those perceived as more socially 
acceptable. On the other hand, 
we may have underestimated the 
prevalence of consumption in some 
categories by treating food mixtures 
as a single food item. Additionally, 
we did not account for variability in 
portion sizes in the current study. 
However, future research should 
seek to estimate usual intake levels of 
key nutrients in this population and 
compare them against the dietary 
reference intake recommendations 
set forth by the Institute of 
Medicine’s Food and Nutrition 
Board.41, 
 
42
cOnclusIOns
While there have been some 
improvements in the diets of 0- to 
23-month-olds in recent years,  
there are areas in which this 
population continues to fall  
short of meeting current 
recommendations for early feeding. 
This underscores the need for 
clear policy guidance for providers 
and education for parents and 
caretakers on helping infants and 
young toddlers achieve healthy diets. 
Findings from the current study 
highlight key issues (eg, increasing 
vegetable consumption, decreasing 
sweetened beverage consumption) 
that should be monitored by 
clinicians and addressed by future 
dietary guidelines for the birth-to-24-
months population.
