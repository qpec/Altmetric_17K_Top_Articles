Abstract
Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to human welfare. Inhibitors of multidrug efflux pumps 
(EPIs) are promising alternative therapeutics that could revive activities of antibiotics and reduce 
bacterial virulence. Identification of new druggable sites for inhibition is critical for the 
development of effective EPIs, especially in light of constantly emerging resistance. Here, we 
describe EPIs that interact with periplasmic membrane fusion proteins, critical components of 
efflux pumps that are responsible for the activation of the transporter and the recruitment of the 
outer-membrane channel. The discovered EPIs bind to AcrA, a component of the prototypical 
AcrAB-TolC pump, change its structure in vivo, inhibit efflux of fluorescent probes, and potentiate 
the activities of antibiotics in Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria. Our findings 
expand the chemical and mechanistic diversity of EPIs, suggest the mechanism for regulation of 
the efflux pump assembly and activity, and provide a promising path for reviving the activities of 
antibiotics in resistant bacteria.

The threat of bacterial antibiotic resistance is real and broadly recognized. Multidrug efflux 
is a primordial mechanism of antibiotic resistance and is present in all microorganisms. By 
reducing antibiotic concentrations at targets, polyspecific drug efflux transporters not only 
provide intrinsic levels of antibiotic resistance but also enable development of class-specific 
resistance and often act cooperatively. Escherichia coli AcrAB-TolC is a prototype multidrug 
efflux pump and a major contributor to antibiotic resistance in clinical settings.1 Close 
homologues of this pump are conserved in the genomes of Gram-negative pathogens and 
share with it their structure and molecular mechanism. These transporters act synergistically 
with the low permeability barrier of the Gram-negative outer membrane (OM) by expelling 
drugs from the inner membrane and periplasm into the external medium. Such transport 
requires a concerted action of three proteins: the inner membrane transporter AcrB, the 
periplasmic membrane fusion protein (MFP) AcrA, and the outer membrane channel TolC. 
Together the three components form a protein conduit spanning the two membranes and the 
periplasm of E. coli.2 Inactivation of any of the three components completely abrogates drug 
efflux and leads to a dramatic increase in susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents.3
Efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) are emerging alternative therapeutics that have the potential to 
revive the activities of existing antibiotics and to control the spread of antibiotic resistance.4 
The inner membrane transporter AcrB has hitherto been a focus of efforts to identify 
EPIs.4a,5 The three previously described EPIs, DA-13-1809, MC207110 (PAβN), and 
MBX2319, were shown to bind to AcrB and have similar mechanisms of action.4a,5a,c,6 
MC207110 stands somewhat apart because its mechanism also involves permeabilization of 
the outer membrane7 and interference with binding of other substrates.8 For different 
reasons, these inhibitors have not yet progressed to clinical trials, and continued efforts are 
needed to identify EPIs with different mechanisms of action. Chemical and mechanistic 
diversification of EPIs could facilitate the development of inhibitors suitable for clinical 
applications.
Here, we analyzed the periplasmic MFP, AcrA, as an allosteric target for multidrug efflux 
inhibition. AcrA and homologous MFPs enable the extrusion of antibiotics across the OM 
by assembling into a hexameric structure on the periplasmic surface of AcrB and creating a 
sealed tunnel for antimicrobials to reach TolC.2b,6,9 This assembly is highly dynamic and 
serves both structural and several functional roles. AcrA and other MFPs have been

 proposed to sense substrate-dependent conformational changes in the transporter and to 
interact with substrates directly, initiating engagement of the OM channel into the trans-
envelope complex.9a Interactions with the OM channel trigger the assembly of the AcrA 
tunnel and the conformational changes in AcrA needed to activate the transporter and open 
the OM channel.
The structure of AcrA befits its diverse functions.10 AcrA and other MFPs form four linearly 
arranged domains connected by flexible linkers (Figure 1A). The docking site for TolC is the 
α-helical hairpin of AcrA. This domain assumes multiple conformations due to the 
flexibility of the hinge region linking it to the lipoyl domain.10a Although the exact 
functional role of the lipoyl domain remains unclear, analysis of mutations targeting this 
domain in AcrA suggests a role in stabilizing the complex.10a,11 The α–β-barrel domain is 
involved in ligand binding, as a Zn2+ ion, a substrate of the MFP ZneB, was found to bind to 
the α–β-barrel domain and cause a conformational change affecting the adjacent membrane 
proximal (MP) domain.12 It remains unclear whether or not substrates interact with AcrA or 
other MFPs. The MP domains are often unresolved in crystal structures of MFPs as they can 
be unstructured and proteolytically labile.10a,13 Ligand binding and modification with lipids 
and interprotomer interactions stabilize the MP domains in a β-roll structure, which varies 
substantially in different MFPs.10b,12 The relative positioning of the α–β-barrel and MP 
domains changes the protein from a crescent-like shape to a more extended conformation 
(Figure 1A,B).
In the assembled AcrAB-TolC complex, AcrA functions as a trimer of dimers, in which each 
protomer of an AcrA dimer is functionally distinct and forms a unique interaction with AcrB 
and TolC.14 One protomer in each dimer is thought to be responsible for the stimulation of 
transporter turnover, whereas the second protomer is important for functional interactions 
with TolC (Figure 6). Hence, the oligomerization of AcrA is essential not only for the 
assembly of the trans-periplasmic drug tunnel but also for the coupling of transport 
processes in the two different membranes.
The structural and functional studies discussed above suggest that a structure-based 
approach to ligand design specific to AcrA might be fruitful, in which allosteric and/or 
protein/protein interaction inhibitors are pursued that act at the interdomain interfaces or 
elsewhere to disrupt efflux pump assembly and/or function. In this study, we targeted AcrA 
to discover EPIs with desired biochemical activities. To achieve this, we developed a joint 
experimental–computational ligand screening approach of general applicability in the 
discovery of inhibitors for periplasmic targets. The experimental screen involved growth 
inhibition assays that were used previously to identify compounds acting synergistically 
with known antibiotics.5b,15 We modified this screen to increase its sensitivity and 
selectivity. In whole cell assays, it is difficult to separate the inhibition of efflux from the 
permeabilization of the OM because the two are synergistically linked by the efflux of 
antibiotics across the OM.5b Therefore, to increase the probability of selectively identifying 
EPIs, we used WT-Pore E. coli cells, which carry large, 2.4 nm, pores in their OM. These 
cells are susceptible to antibiotics that do not permeate the intact OM but they retain full 
efflux activity.16 Using this computational–experimental approach, we discovered new 
AcrA-binding EPIs that potentiate antibiotics in E. coli.

 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Experimental Screening for EPIs
To identify AcrA-specific inhibitors of antibiotic efflux, we developed a protocol of parallel 
experimental and structure-based computational screens and counter-screens (Figure 2). The 
experimental screen involved the growth inhibition assay, in which antibacterial activities of 
various compounds were analyzed in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of an 
antibiotic. For the computational screen, we used an ensemble docking approach to rank 
compounds on the basis of their binding to different AcrA conformers and sites. Top scorers 
from both types of screening were further analyzed to establish multidrug potentiation, to 
experimentally assess binding to AcrA, and to probe the mechanism of action.
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Diversity 5 set (1593 compounds) and the NCI Natural 
Product Set (117 compounds) (NCI 5) were screened for the potentiation of antimicrobial 
activity of the antibiotic novobiocin in WT-Pore cells.16 Screening in these cells counter-
selects against compounds that permeabilize the OM and also increases the positive hit rate 
because more diverse compounds are able to reach the periplasmic AcrA. Novobiocin was 
selected for potentiation screening because the permeabilization of the OM in efflux-
proficient WT-Pore cells decreased its minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) by only 4-
fold, from 128 to 32 μg/mL. In contrast, inactivation of efflux decreased the MIC of 
novobiocin by 256-fold both in the ΔTolC-Pore cells with the intact OM and in 
permeabilized cells. This effect of active efflux on the activity of novobiocin creates a large 
potentiation window that is mostly insensitive to the permeability of the OM. Hence, to 
qualify as an EPI, a compound should demonstrate a concentration-dependent potentiation 
of the inhibitory activity of novobiocin in WT-Pore cells but not in ΔTolC-Pore cells lacking 
active efflux (Figure 2).
The screen identified 12 compounds that potentiated novobiocin inhibitory activity in WT-
Pore cells in a concentration-dependent manner (0.7% hit rate) (Table 1). Checkerboard 
assays were carried out to determine the minimal potentiating concentration (MPC) of hits 
for novobiocin and erythromycin, another substrate of AcrAB-TolC. Four hits were found to 
potentiate both novobiocin and erythromycin equally well, with similar MPC4 values (MPC 
at which the inhibitory activity of an antibiotic is potentiated 4-fold) for both antibiotics 
(Table 1). Two hits potentiated erythromycin significantly better than novobiocin, and two 
potentiated the activity of novobiocin only. Of the 12 hits, 8 compounds did not potentiate 
the activities of antibiotics in the efflux-deficient ΔTolC-Pore cells. Therefore, these 8 
compounds possess EPI-like properties.
Validation of Functional Binding Sites and Computational Screening
For the computational screens, we generated structural models of full-length AcrA from E. 
coli K-12 substrate MG1655 on the basis of homology with crystallographically determined 
structures (see the Supporting Information). Consistent with previous studies,10a,17 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated the presence of a hinge-bending motion 
between the lipoyl and α–β-barrel domains of AcrA (Figure 1B). The “hinge bending”

 defines the orientation of the hairpin domain, and the hinge region contains a well-defined 
groove (Figure 1C).
A multiple sequence alignment of 1670 AcrA homologues showed that the hinge site is lined 
by highly conserved residues of the lipoyl domain of AcrA (Figure 1C; Figure S1). To 
analyze the functional significance of this site, Glu67, Arg69, Thr174, Lys175, and Thr177 
were substituted with alanine in plasmid-borne AcrA coexpressed with AcrB. Expression of 
all the constructed AcrA variants was similar to that of the wild-type protein. On the basis of 
MIC measurements with novobiocin and erythromycin, R69A, T174A, K175A, and T177A 
mutants fully complemented the susceptible phenotype of E. coli ΔacrAB cells. In contrast, 
the E67A variant was only partially active, and the reversal of charge in the E67R variant 
further reduced the ability of AcrA to complement the drug susceptibility phenotype (Figure 
1D). Thus, both the size and the charge of the residue at position 67 are important for AcrA 
function. Therefore, the hinge site (hinge) of AcrA is functionally important and was 
selected as a potential binding site for small molecules. Another potential binding site was 
identified on the conformationally flexible MP domain. This site, which again contains 
functionally important and conserved residues,18 is located at the interface of the MP 
domain and the adjacent α–β-barrel domain (Figure 1A).
To identify compounds that could potentially bind to the hinge and/or MP sites, we 
performed short MD simulations of monomeric AcrA and clustered the structures to extract 
an ensemble of ~30 representative conformations. Using an ensemble docking approach, we 
carried out in silico high-throughput docking screens on each conformation19 (Figure S2). 
This screen was performed with the NCI 5 library. The compounds were ranked on the basis 
of their docking scores. Among the 50 top-scoring compounds for each site, 21 were 
predicted to bind specifically at the hinge site, 21 were predicted to bind specifically at the 
MP site, and 29 were predicted to bind at both sites (Table S1).
Identification of AcrA Inhibitors
The 12 primary hits from the experimental screen and the 18 top scorers from the virtual 
screening were then experimentally counter-screened for physical interactions with purified 
AcrA using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The purified AcrA protein has a very low 
propensity to oligomerize, and it is the association with AcrB and cooperative interactions 
with TolC that are believed to drive AcrA oligomerization and formation of the trans-
envelope tunnel.2a,6,9b For SPR, purified AcrA was immobilized onto a CM5 chip at three 
protein densities, and ligands were injected at 50 μM concentration. A total of 11 AcrA 
binders (36%) were identified in this counter-screen, of which 7 compounds (23%) were 
potentiators of antibiotic activities in E. coli cells (Table 1 and Figure 2), suggesting that 
they may be acting on AcrA.
Seven of the experimentally validated AcrA binder–potentiators were in the top 10% of the 
rankings in the computational screen at the hinge site, MP site, or both (Figure 2B,C; 
Figures S3 and S4). Of these, NSC 60339, NSC 227186, NSC 33353, and NSC 305798 were 
all ranked in the top 5% of the computational hits, were shown to bind AcrA in SPR 
experiments, and potentiated the inhibitory activity of novobiocin. The confluence of 
computation and experiment led us to select these four compounds for further investigation.

 NSC 227186, also called chlorobiocin, is an aminocoumarin antibiotic that differs from 
novobiocin by a chloro substitution of the C-8′ methyl group and a pyrrole substitution of 
the 3-O″-carbamoyl group in novobiocin20 (Figure S5). Similar to novobiocin, NSC 227186 
is an excellent substrate for the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, as seen from the ~10-fold 
decrease in MIC caused by deletion of TolC (Table 1). Thus, NSC 227186 may act as a 
competitive inhibitor. To evaluate this notion, we next compared the properties of 
novobiocin and NSC 227186 in potentiating the activity of erythromycin.
The checkerboard assay showed that NSC 227186 interacts synergistically with both 
novobiocin and erythromycin. Because MICs of NSC 60339 and NSC 227186 were too high 
to be measured in E. coli WT cells, all drug combinations were analyzed in WT-Pore cells. 
In these cells, the MPC4 of NSC 227186 was found to be 3 μM for novobiocin and 6 μM for 
erythromycin, and the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices were 0.325 and 
0.375 for novobiocin and erythromycin, respectively. An FIC index ≤0.5 indicates 
synergistic interactions between antibiotics, and an FIC of 1 indicates an additive effect 
between the drugs.21 No synergistic interactions between NSC 227186 and antibiotics were 
found in the efflux-deficient ΔTolC-Pore cells (Table 1). Importantly, novobiocin did not 
potentiate the inhibitory activity of erythromycin in the WT-Pore cells (FIC index = 2, 
indicating an indifferent effect) and the combination of the two antibiotics was additive in 
ΔTolC-Pore cells, with an FIC index of 0.75. Thus, NSC 227186, but not novobiocin, has an 
EPI-like activity in E. coli cells.
NSC 60339 is a substituted phthalanilide (2-chloro-4′,4″-bis (2-imidazolin-2-
yl)terephthalanilide) with chemotherapeutic activity against a wide range of cancers.22 This 
compound has a weak antibacterial activity against WT-Pore E. coli with an MIC of 200 μM. 
The MIC decreases to 12.5 μM in ΔTolC-Pore cells, suggesting that NSC 60339 is a 
substrate of AcrAB-TolC (Table 1). NSC 60339 potentiates both NOV and erythromycin in 
WT-Pore E. coli cells with an MPC4 of 25 μM for novobiocin and 12.5 μM for 
erythromycin, but has no effect on these antibiotics in ΔTolC-Pore cells (FIC index = 2).
NSC 33353 is a substituted aminoquinoline with a chemokine receptor-modulating 
activity.23 This compound has weak antimicrobial activity with an MIC in E. coli WT-Pore 
cells of 100 μM. It is a substrate of AcrAB-TolC as seen from the 8-fold decrease in MIC to 
12.5 μM in ΔTolC-Pore cells (Table 1). NSC 33353 potentiates equally well the activities of 
novobiocin and erythromycin with MPC4 for both antibiotics in the 1.56–3.125 μM range. 
This compound has the largest fold potentiation window (MIC/MPC4 = 32–64) among the 
top four compounds.
Lastly, NSC 305798 is an antimalarial agent, enpiroline ((R)-piperidin-2-yl(2-
trifluoromethyl)-6-[4-(trifluoromethyl)-pyridine-4-yl]methanol), with an unknown 
antimalarial mechanism of action.24 The MIC of enpiroline is 25–50 μM in E. coli WT, WT-
Pore, and efflux-deficient ΔTolC cells and 12.5 μM in ΔTolC-Pore cells. Thus, among the 
top four hits, NSC 305798 is the only compound for which activity is not affected 
significantly by the permeability of the OM or AcrAB-TolC-mediated efflux. NSC 305798 
potentiates erythromycin with an MPC4 of 1.56–3.125 μM (MIC/MPC4 = 16–32) but has a

 weaker potentiating activity in combination with novobiocin with MPC4 at 12.5 μM 
(MIC/MPC4 = 2–4).
The Four Top Hits Are Inhibitors of AcrAB-TolC with Different Mechanisms of Action
To further characterize the mechanism(s) of inhibition, we compared the biochemical 
activities of the top four hits to two previously characterized EPIs, phenylalanyl-β-
naphthylamide (MC207110) and the pyranopyridine MBX2319, both of which are thought 
to act on the transporter AcrB.8,25 MC207110, but not MBX2319, is also a substrate of the 
AcrAB-TolC pump.5b,8 We first compared the affinities of the hits and EPIs, as well as those 
of novobiocin and erythromycin, to purified AcrA protein. For this purpose, SPR 
sensorgrams were collected with immobilized AcrA and increasing concentrations of ligands 
from 6 to 100 μM. We found that NSC 227186, NSC 60339, NSC 33353, NSC 305798, 
MC207110, and novobiocin bind AcrA with low-to-mid micromolar affinities (Table 1 and 
Figure 3; Figure S5), suggesting that all of these compounds may interact with AcrA in vivo. 
In contrast, MBX2319 and erythromycin do not bind AcrA with detectable affinities.
We next investigated whether the top hits inhibit efflux of the fluorescent drug bisbenzimide 
H33342 (HT). The fluorescence of HT increases dramatically when it intercalates into 
membranes and intracellular DNA. When added to efflux-proficient cells, HT fluorescence 
increases very slowly because it is an excellent substrate of AcrAB-TolC, but inactivation of 
TolC leads to a rapid increase in HT fluorescence.26 Similar fluorescence-based assays have 
been used previously to test the abilities of candidate EPIs to increase intracellular 
concentrations of compounds.15,27 In agreement with previous studies, treatment of cells 
with increasing concentrations of either MBX2319 or MC207110 led to increased 
fluorescence and hence inhibition of HT efflux (Figure S6). Novobiocin and NSC 227186 
are intrinsically fluorescent, and their ability to inhibit the efflux of HT could not be 
analyzed using this approach. However, NSC 60339, NSC 33353, and NSC 305798 all 
demonstrated efflux-inhibitory activities, albeit with different concentration dependencies 
(Figure 3A–C). In the presence of NSC 60339, the initial rates of HT uptake into cells 
increased by ~3 fold and remained constant at or above 12 μM NSC 60339. In contrast, the 
rates of HT uptake increase linearly with increasing concentrations of NSC 305798. The 
concentration dependence of NSC 33353 inhibition is more complex and at high (≥25 μM) 
concentrations, some enhancement of HT uptake was also observed in ΔTolC-Pore cells 
(Figure S7). Thus, all three top hits are EPIs, but with different mechanisms of inhibition. 
NSC 33353 is likely to have additional interactions in cells.
This conclusion was further confirmed by studies of the potentiating activities of NSC 33353 
and NSC 60339 in different Gram-negative bacteria (Table 2). In addition to E. coli, NSC 
33353 potentiated activities of novobiocin and erythromycin in Acinetobacter baumannii, 
Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae and of a fluoroquinolone levofloxacin only 
in E. coli and K. pneumoniae (Table 2). In contrast, NSC 60339 was active only in E. coli 
but potentiated activities of not only novobiocin and erythromycin but also levofloxacin. 
Thus, NSC 60339 is a species-specific EPI. None of the EPIs was active in Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa PAO1, presumably because they cannot penetrate the outer membrane of this 
bacterium.

 NSC 60339 Changes the Structure of AcrA in Vivo
To determine whether or not interactions of the EPIs with AcrA affect its structure or ability 
to form a functional AcrAB-TolC complex in vivo, we used an in vivo proteolysis approach. 
In agreement with previous results,18 the proteolytic cleavage profile of AcrA in the absence 
of TolC (ΔTolC-Pore cells) accumulated a K46–R315 fragment that was absent in the profile 
of AcrA engaged in the tripartite complex (WT-Pore cells) (Figure 4A). The assembly of the 
AcrAB-TolC complex leads to cleavage in the MP domain of AcrA, as seen in the 
accumulation of the K46–R294/296 fragment that dominates the AcrA proteolytic profile in 
the WT-Pore cells. Pretreatment of WT-Pore cells with NSC 227186, NSC 305798, NSC 
33353, MC207110, or MBX2319 did not result in notable changes in the proteolytic 
cleavage of AcrA, consistent with these inhibitors not significantly affecting the structure of 
AcrA or the assembly of the AcrAB-TolC complex (Figure S6). In contrast, two stable AcrA 
fragments were accumulated in WT-Pore cells treated with NSC 60339: the K46–R294/296 
fragment characteristic for the assembled AcrAB-TolC complex and a new fragment 
corresponding to residues K46–K346 of AcrA (Figure 4B). Thus, the structure of AcrA is 
different in the presence of NSC 60339 from that in its absence. Taken together, these 
findings suggest that the mechanism of inhibition by NSC 60339 may involve structural 
changes in AcrA.
Binding to AcrA Is Required for the Inhibitory Activities of EPIs
The results described above show that NSC 60339 is an EPI that binds to and changes the 
structure of AcrA in vivo. In a preliminary investigation of structure–activity relationships 
(SARs), we prepared several analogues of NSC 60339 (Figure 5A). Compounds in which 
the chlorine of the central 2-chlorophthalamide ring was replaced, that is, R = Me (SLU-
PP-227) or R = H (SLU-PP-192), still demonstrated binding to AcrA and potentiation of 
novobiocin and erythromycin, albeit with reduced activities (Figure 5B and Table 3). 
However, the analogue SLU-PP-228, in which the central ring has been converted to a 
saturated cyclohexyl ring, was found to have no binding with AcrA or potentiation (Table 3). 
Interestingly though, this compound did possess the greatest antimicrobial activity of the 
new analogues, with an MIC of 50 μM in WT-Pore cells.
We also prepared analogues by modifying the flanking imidazoline rings. The replacement 
of these groups with hydroxymethyl substituents (SLU-PP-103) resulted in a complete loss 
of both binding to AcrA and potentiation. We prepared another analogue in which the 
imidazoline group is migrated to the 3-position, SLU-PP-187. This compound retains most 
of the binding and potentiation exhibited by NSC 60339 and similarly has low antimicrobial 
activity (MIC = 200 μM) on its own (Figure 5C and Table 3). This finding suggests that the 
imidazoline group is critical for binding and that the AcrA binding site is able to 
accommodate a less linear molecule, such as SLU-PP-187. These findings also show that the 
interaction between NSC 60339 and AcrA is specific and that there is a clear relationship 
between the changes in binding to AcrA and the EPI activities of the NSC 60339 analogues.
In addition, two commercially available structural analogues of NSC 305798 were identified 
and tested in AcrA binding and potentiation assays (Figure 5D). Both compounds are weak 
antimicrobial agents with MICs of 400 and 100 μM in the WT-Pore cells for NSC 29375 and

 vacquinol-1, respectively (Table 3). Efflux inactivation reduced the MICs by 2–4-fold, which 
suggests that both compounds are weak substrates of AcrAB-TolC. NSC 29375 showed 
weak AcrA binding activity and weak potentiation activity for both novobiocin and eryth-
romycin. Similarly, vacquinol-1 binds AcrA and potentiates the activity of novobiocin 
(MPC4 = 25 μM), albeit with weaker activities than those of NSC 305798. Thus, as is the 
case with the NSC 60339 series, there is a relationship between the activity of the EPI and 
binding to AcrA. In agreement, among the four primary hits that potentiated the activity of 
novobiocin but did not bind AcrA, three compounds, NSC56410, NSC 260594, and NSC 
26980, potentiated the activity of novobiocin in an efflux-independent manner in ΔTolC-
Pore cells and, therefore, were not EPIs (Table 1).
Inhibitors with Different Mechanisms May Target Different Sites on AcrA
We cannot exclude the possibility that in addition to binding to AcrA, interactions with 
AcrB or other intracellular targets could also contribute to the observed EPI activities. 
However, our results suggest that the targeting of two different sites on AcrA may yield 
inhibitors with different mechanisms of actions. Two binding sites on AcrA were used for 
computational molecular docking: the hinge and the MP sites. The hinge site is important for 
the assembly of the hexameric AcrA tunnel.2a,28 In addition, the conformations of the hinge 
site in the crystal structure of a soluble AcrA fragment10a and in the assembled hexameric 
AcrA tunnel2 are slightly different. Among the identified EPIs, NSC 60339 and NSC 
227186 were ranked highest in docking to the hinge site and their computed molecular 
contacts with AcrA are similar (Figure 6B). In these models of the docked complex Glu67, 
which is important for AcrA function, interacts electrostatically with one of the 
dihydroimidazole rings of NSC 60339 and with a hydroxy group of NSC 227186 (Figure 1).
To probe possible interactions between NSC 60339 and AcrA in the efflux pump, we 
superimposed our model of monomeric AcrA with NSC 60339 bound in its highest ranking 
docked pose at the hinge site onto one of the protomers of hexameric AcrA in a 
pseudoatomic model of the efflux complex.2b This procedure placed the inhibitor at an 
interprotomer interface such that it would interfere with the AcrB- and TolC-driven 
hexamerization of AcrA required to assemble the functional complex (Figure 6A). Thus, it is 
plausible that binding of NSC 60339 to AcrA may prevent or disrupt the structure of the 
pump. The in vivo proteolysis supports such a mechanism for NSC 60339 (Figure 4). 
Pretreatment of WT-Pore cells with this compound changed the proteolytic pattern of AcrA, 
suggesting that NSC 60339 binding indeed changes the structure of AcrA.
In the assembled AcrAB-TolC complex, the MP site of AcrA has two different interfaces 
with AcrB.2a One site occupies an interprotomer cavity of the AcrB trimer, whereas the MP 
site of another AcrA subunit interfaces with the porter domain of AcrB, the site of substrate 
capture and conformational changes in AcrB needed for substrate extrusion (Figure 6A). 
The top four hits scored relatively high in docking to the MP site, but the docked molecules 
have different poses and molecular contacts in this site. Several residues predicted to contact 
NSC 305798 and NSC 33353 or to be in immediate proximity to their binding sites (Figure 
6C) were previously identified by mutagenesis and chemical cross-linking as essential for 
interactions between AcrA and AcrB, as well as in their respective homologues MexA and

 MexB from P. aeruginosa.28,29 In particular, cysteine residues introduced at positions 219, 
249, 319, and 344 in AcrA can be cross-linked directly to AcrB,10b whereas substitutions at 
G240, V244, and S249 in AcrA enabled its function with a noncognate MexB transporter.29c 
Thus, binding of compounds at the MP site could interfere with functional interactions 
between AcrA and AcrB or by preventing conformational changes in AcrA needed for 
stimulation of the AcrB transporter.
Differences in Functionalities and Molecular Contacts Distinguish Substrates from 
Inhibitors
With the exception of NSC 305798, the described inhibitors are excellent substrates of the 
AcrAB-TolC pump, and hence their mechanisms of action could involve interactions with 
the transporter as well. Surprisingly, the substrate, novobiocin, which does not have an EPI-
like activity, also interacts with AcrA (Figure S5), leading to the possibility that AcrA 
binding sites might be shared by both substrates and inhibitors. Comparison of novobiocin 
and clorobiocin binding to AcrA by ensemble docking analyses suggests that in both the 
hinge and MP sites clorobiocin binds more strongly than novobiocin and that the predicted 
poses and contacts for these two molecules are different (Figure S8). The pyrrole moiety of 
clorobiocin could play the same functional role in AcrA binding as the imidazoline ring of 
NSC 60339 (Figure 5). Hence, the distinction between substrate and inhibitor could arise 
from small differences in molecular contacts of compounds with AcrA and/or AcrB binding 
sites.
METHODS
Microbiological and Biochemical Assays
E. coli WT-Pore and ΔTolC-Pore strains are derivatives of BW 25113 and GD102.16 Plasmid 
pAcrABHis carrying the acrAB operon under the native promoter30 was used for 
construction of AcrA mutants and in the complementation assays. Plasmid pEZ11 
expressing a soluble AcrAHis variant under the IPTG-inducible T7-promoter was used for 
purification of AcrA.31
MICs were analyzed using a 2-fold broth dilution method.32 For the checkerboard assay, an 
antibiotic and a test compound were serially diluted into 96-well plates as described 
previously.5b SPR experiments were carried out with the purified AcrA immobilized onto a 
CM5 chip (Biacore).9b For the in vivo proteolysis, exponentially grown WT-Pore and 
ΔTolC-Pore cells were permeabilized by inducing the expression of the pore with 0.1% 
arabinose for 3 h. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of trypsin, and AcrA 
fragments were visualized by immunoblotting of total cellular protein.18a The HT uptake 
assay was performed in a temperature-controlled microplate reader (Tecan Spark 10M) 
equipped with a sample injector, in fluorescence mode. Data were fitted to extract initial 
rates as described previously (Krishnamoorthy et al., submitted for publication).
