While some epidemiologic studies support the hypothesis that stress can adversely affect fertility, few prospec-
tive studies have assessed the association in couples from the general population. We used data from Pregnancy
Study Online, a web-based preconception cohort study of pregnancy planners from the United States and Canada
(2013–2018), to examine the association between women’s and men’s perceived stress levels prior to conception
and fecundability. Women (aged 21–45 years) and their male partners (aged ≥21 years) who were attempting con-
ception without fertility treatment were eligible. We measured perceived stress using the 10-item Perceived Stress
Scale (PSS). We ascertained pregnancy information using bimonthly follow-up questionnaires of female partici-
pants. We followed 4,769 couples until self-reported pregnancy, initiation of fertility treatment, loss to follow-up, or
12 menstrual cycles of attempt time, whichever came first. We used proportional probabilities regression models to
estimate fecundability ratios and 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for potential confounders. Higher PSS scores
among the women were associated with slight reductions in fecundability (comparing PSS scores of ≥25 vs. <10,
fecundability ratio = 0.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.74, 1.02). PSS scores among the men were not substantially
associated with fecundability.

In North America, 20%–25% of women and 18%–21%
of men of reproductive age report daily psychological stress
(1, 2). Stress adversely affects quality of life and is associated
with cardiovascular and mental illness, accelerated disease
progression, and premature mortality (3–7). The physiology
of the human stress response is well-established. A stressful
stimulus results in signaling to the hypothalamus, which acti-
vates the sympathetic-adrenomedullary axis and increases blood
norepinephrine and salivary α-amylase. If the stress becomes
chronic, the sympathetic-adrenomedullary axis remains hyper-
active, while the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is also acti-
vated, increasing blood and salivary cortisol. Suppression of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis activation represents a physiological link between
the stress response and the female reproductive system (8).
Reports among infertile couples of spontaneous conception
following adoption of a child (9, 10) and positive associations
between psychiatric treatments and improved in vitro fertiliza-
tion outcomes (11–13) indicate that stress affects fertility. Among
women, stress could influence fertility by delaying or inhibiting
the luteinizing hormone surge of the menstrual cycle (14), affect-
ing gamete transport (15), increasing risk of anovulation (16), or
creating an unfavorable environment for implantation (17).
Epidemiologic studies of the association between stress among
women and fertility report conflicting results (16). Two precon-
ception cohort studies have found inverse associations between
salivary levels of α-amylase, but not cortisol, and fecundabil-
ity (18, 19), while studies of questionnaire-based stress mea-
sures and fecundability have reported an inverse association
with luteal-phase psychological distress (20), an inverse asso-
ciation with follicular-phase stress but a positive association with
luteal phase stress (21), or little association (22). Inconsistencies
across studies could stem from differing methods and timing of
stress measurements.

 Among men, stress might affect fertility through decreased
testosterone levels, altered spermatogenesis (23), and erectile
dysfunction and ejaculatory problems (24, 25). Studies of male
medical students during examinations(26,27)and men experienc-
ing war-time conditions (28–30), work-related stress (31), and
recent bereavement (32) suggest that psychological stress adversely
affects sperm concentration and semen quality. The only epi-
demiologic study, to our knowledge, to examine the associa-
tion between male stress and fertility found that psychological
stress (33), but not job strain (high demand and low control) (34),
was associated with reduced fecundability.
In the present study, we examined the association between
perceived stress among men and women and fecundability in
a North American cohort of couples planning a pregnancy.
METHODS
Study population
Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO) is an ongoing web-based
preconception cohort study of pregnancy planners from the
United States and Canada (35). Eligible women are 21–45 years
old and attempting to conceive without fertility treatment. Wo-
men’s participation involves completion of a baseline question-
naire on demographic, behavioral, medical, and reproductive
factors and bimonthly follow-up questionnaires to update preg-
nancy status and exposure information. Women may also invite
their male partners aged ≥21 years to participate. Men’s partici-
pation involves completion of a baseline questionnaire. Ten
days after baseline, participants complete a validated food fre-
quency questionnaire (36).
From June 2013 through January 2018, 6,813 women com-
pleted the baseline questionnaire. We excluded women with
implausible last menstrual period dates (n = 123), history of
infertility (n = 623), or who had been attempting conception
for >6 cycles at study entry (n = 1,298). The final study popu-
lation comprised 4,769 women and 1,272 men.
The institutional review board at Boston University Medical
Center approved this study. All participants provided informed
consent.
Exposure assessment
We measured perceived stress using the 10-item version of
the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), designed to assess how unpre-
dictable, uncontrollable, and overwhelming individuals find their
life circumstances (37). Reliability studies demonstrate that the
PSS effectively captures stress over the previous 4–8 weeks in
community-based samples with at least an 8th grade educa-
tion (37–39). Given that stress-associated pathology results
from cognitively mediated responses to a stressful event, rather
than from the event itself, the PSS is considered a better measure
of relevant stress than objective measures of stressful events (37).
Participants completed the PSS at baseline (both partners)
and at each follow-up (women only). The items referred to the
past month, with 5 response choices ranging from 0 (never) to 4
(very often). We summed the responses of the 10 items to com-
pute a total score (range, 0–40), with higher scores indicating
higher perceived stress.
Outcome assessment
On follow-up questionnaires, women reported whether they
were currently pregnant and, if not, whether they had experi-
enced any pregnancy losses since their last questionnaire, were
still attempting conception, or had initiated fertility treatment.
For nonresponders, we sought pregnancy information via tele-
phone contact, linking with birth registry data, and searching
for baby registries and announcements online.
At baseline, women reported the number of menstrual peri-
ods they had had since they began trying to conceive. They also
reported whether their menstrual cycles were regular and, if
yes, their usual cycle length. For women with irregular cycles,
we estimated usual cycle length using last menstrual period dates
at baseline and follow-up. We calculated pregnancy attempt
time, rounded to the nearest whole cycle, as follows: (menstrual
cycles of attempt time at baseline) + ([last menstrual period date
from most recent follow-up questionnaire − date of baseline
questionnaire] ÷ cycle length) + 1.
Covariate assessment
We collected covariate information on the baseline question-
naires, including age, race/ethnicity, education, household income,
height, weight, sleep duration, employment status, hours per week
of work, smoking history, alcohol and caffeine consumption,
intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, physical activity, inter-
course frequency, use of methods to improve chances of con-
ception, multivitamin and folic acid use, depressive symptoms
(Major Depression Inventory score (40)), and reproductive his-
tory. From the food frequency questionnaire, we calculated
Healthy Eating Index scores (41).
Statistical analysis
A factor analysis using orthogonal rotation to identify domains
within the PSS revealed 2 factor loadings, confirming results
from studies assessing the psychometric properties of the PSS
(38, 42, 43). The first factor included the 6 negatively worded
items on perceived stress and had factor loadings from 0.61 to
0.78. The second factor included the 4 positively worded items
on coping skills and had factor loadings from 0.64 to 0.77.
Cronbach’s α values for the 6 stress items and 4 coping items
were 0.85 and 0.76, respectively, indicating high internal
consistency.
We generated 5 imputation data sets using a Markov chain
Monte Carlo method to impute missing exposure, covariate,
and outcome data. For women not completing any follow-up
questionnaires (n = 542, 11.4%), we assigned 1 menstrual cycle
of follow-up and imputed their pregnancy status. PSS score was
missing for <0.1% of women and 40.6% of men (administering
the PSS to men was added to the baseline questionnaire in Janu-
ary 2015). Missing covariate data ranged from 0% (age) to 3%
(income).
We used the Anderson-Gill data structure (44, 45) with 1
observation per menstrual cycle to update covariates over time
and account for left truncation (46, 47). Women contributed
observed menstrual cycles to the analysis from study entry
until pregnancy, fertility treatment, cessation of pregnancy
attempt, loss to follow-up, or 12 cycles, whichever came first.

 We used proportional probabilities regression to estimate fe-
cundability ratios (FRs), the per-cycle probability of concep-
tion comparing exposed with unexposed individuals, and 95%
confidence intervals.
For women, we examined PSS score in 3 ways: at baseline,
as a time-varying variable (for each cycle, using the PSS score
from the most recently completed follow-up questionnaire), and
as a cumulative average variable (for each cycle, the average
PSS score from baseline through that cycle). We administered
the PSS to men at baseline only. Given the lack of clinical cut-
points for the PSS, we categorized PSS scores based on their
distributions in the cohort: <10 (referent), 10–14, 15–19, 20–24,
and ≥25. We assessed the shape of the curve relating PSS score
to fecundability using restricted cubic splines (48, 49). We con-
ducted a couples-based analysis comparing fecundability within
joint categories of PSS scores from each partner.
We used a directed acyclic graph (Web Figure 1, available at
https://academic.oup.com/aje) to identify confounders. With
the exception of irregular cycles, the directed acyclic graphs
for women and men were identical. These included age (in years:
<25, 25–29, 30–34, ≥35), body mass index (calculated as weight
(kg)/height (m)2: <25, 25–29, 30–34, ≥35), race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white vs. not), education (up to high school educa-
tion, some college, college degree, graduate school), annual
household income (less than $50,000, $50,000–$99,999,
$100,000–$149,999, at least $150,000), and employment (in
hours per week: <20, 20–39, 40–49, ≥50 or unemployed).
To assess potential for reverse causation, we stratified mod-
els by attempt time at study entry (<3 vs. 3–6 cycles). We also
examined the association between PSS score and fecundabil-
ity in the first observed cycle only. We stratified models by
women’s age (<35 years vs. ≥35 years) to determine whether
associations were stronger in older women.
Baseline PSS scores were positively associated with attri-
tion: Among women with PSS scores of ≥25 and <25, attri-
tion was 32.4% and 22.3%, respectively. We corrected for
differential attrition using inverse probability weights (50–
52). First, we developed pooled logistic regression models for
the probability of study continuation at each observed ques-
tionnaire cycle, conditional on remaining uncensored in the
previous cycle. We included variables, some of which were
time-varying, hypothesized to predict attrition (Web Table 1).
We fitted a separate pooled logistic regression model includ-
ing only baseline variables. From these models, we calculated
the predicted probability of continuation for each observation
and computed stabilized weights inversely proportional to the
probability of continuation at each questionnaire cycle. Parti-
cipants with a low probability of continuation received larger
weights, compensating for underrepresentation in the data. We
applied stabilized weights to the regression models and re-
ported weighted FRs and 95% confidence intervals.
High levels of stress can cause sleep disturbances, depres-
sive symptoms, uptake of unhealthy behaviors (e.g., consump-
tion of tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine), lower intercourse
frequency, and abnormal menstrual function (38, 53–56). We
examined whether any observed association between perceived
stress and fecundability was partially or completely mediated
through these variables using a causal mediation analysis (57).
We estimated the direct effects of women’s baseline PSS scores
(≥25 vs. <10) on fecundability (natural direct effect) and effects
that operate through the mediating variables (natural indirect
effect). We calculated the proportion mediated as (FRNDE ×
[FRNIE − 1])/(FRNDE × FRNIE − 1).
RESULTS
We observed 19,130 cycles among 4,769 women. During
follow-up, we identified 2,851 (59.8%) pregnancies: 2,327 self-
reported on a follow-up questionnaire, 364 identified using other
methods, and 160 imputed to women with no follow-up. Of the
remaining 1,918 women, 334 initiated fertility treatment, 46
stopped trying to conceive, 704 were censored at 12 cycles,
744 were lost to follow-up, and 90 were still actively partici-
pating in the study.
Women had higher baseline PSS scores than men (mean =
15.8 (standard deviation, 5.7) and 14.7 (standard deviation, 6.0),
respectively). Among the women followed for 12 menstrual cy-
cles, mean PSS score was 15.4 at baseline, 14.7 at 6 months,
and 15.3 at 12 months, indicating little individual change in PSS
scores over time. Higher PSS scores among women were asso-
ciated with longer attempt times at study entry, higher body
mass index, current smoking, alcohol use, caffeine intake, hours/
week of work, Major Depression Inventory score, history of
physician-diagnosed depression and anxiety, gravidity, irreg-
ular cycles, and short cycles, and they were inversely associ-
ated with age, white non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, education,
income, physical activity, sleep duration, regular multivitamin
intake, and intercourse frequency (Table 1). Patterns were simi-
lar for men, although men’s PSS scores were not substantially
associated with age, alcohol use, or physical activity (Table 2).
Women’s and men’s PSS scores were weakly positively corre-
lated (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.18).
After adjusting for confounders, we observed an inverse asso-
ciation between perceived stress and fecundability (Table 3).
Compared with baseline PSS scores <10, women with base-
line PSS scores of 10–14, 15–19, 20–24, and ≥25 had FRs of
0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.87, 1.07), 0.99 (95%
CI: 0.89, 1.09), 0.95 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.07), and 0.87 (95% CI:
0.74, 1.02). Results for time-varying and cumulative average
PSS scores were similar to the baseline-only results. Consis-
tent with the categorical results, restricted cubic spline analy-
ses showed an approximate linear decline in fecundability
with increasing PSS scores (Figure 1A).
The association between women’s baseline PSS scores and
fecundability was stronger among couples attempting concep-
tion for 0–2 cycles at enrollment (n = 3,158; comparing base-
line PSS score ≥25 with <10, FR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.68, 1.00)
than for couples attempting conception for 3–6 cycles at enroll-
ment (n = 1,611; FR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.41). When we
restricted the analysis to the first observed cycle (n = 4,769), FRs
for women’s baseline PSS scores 10–14, 15–19, 20–24, and ≥25
compared with <10 were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.07), 1.01 (95%
CI: 0.86, 1.19), 0.91 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.10), and 0.72 (95% CI:
0.55, 0.95), respectively. The association was stronger among
younger women (for PSS score ≥25 vs. <10 and age <35 years (n
= 4,138), FR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.99; for women aged ≥35
years (n = 631), FR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.76, 1.84) (data not shown).
Men’s PSS scores were not substantially associated with
fecundability (Table 3); adjustment for women’s PSS score

 made little difference in FRs (data not shown). Results were
similar among men with complete data on PSS score. In the
restricted cubic spline analysis, we also observed little relation-
ship between men’s PSS score and fecundability (Figure 1B).
Results were similar across strata of attempt time at study entry
and female partner’s age, and when restricted to the first observed
cycle of follow-up.
We observed lower fecundability in couples where the
man had a PSS score <10 and the woman had a PSS score of
≥20 (FR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.42, 1.30), compared with couples
where both partners had PSS scores <10 (Table 4). Conversely,
couples where both partners had PSS scores ≥20 did not have
reduced fecundability, although results were imprecise (FR =
1.22, 95% CI: 0.74, 2.03).
In mediation analyses (Table 5), natural indirect effects were
small (range, FR = 0.98–1.00), whereas natural direct effects
were similar to the overall association. The proportions of the
association mediated by intercourse frequency and irregular cy-
cles were 10.0% and 9.7%, respectively; the proportion medi-
ated for other variables was small (<5%).

 DISCUSSION
In this preconception cohort study, we found that greater per-
ceived stress among women, but not men, was associated with
lower couple fecundability. Results were similar regardless of
how women’s stress was analyzed (fixed baseline, time-varying,
or cumulative average) but were stronger among women at-
tempting conception for 0–2 cycles at enrollment and for youn-
ger women.
We measured stress using the PSS, a validated scale that re-
flects perceived stress in a relatively short time frame (38). Our
results diverge from the one prior study of the relationship
between PSS score and fecundability. Among 339 female
pregnancy planners from the United Kingdom, PSS scores
measured on day 6 of the menstrual cycle showed little asso-
ciation with fecundability (for PSS scores 10–14, 15–19, and
≥20 vs. <10, FRs were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.52, 1.25), 0.98 (95%
CI: 0.61, 1.56), and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.50), respectively)
(22). Our strongest findings were for PSS scores ≥25; if few
women in the UK study had PSS scores ≥25, this could explain
the discrepant findings. Our results are consistent with a study
of 430 Danish pregnancy planners in which short-term psycho-
logical distress on day 21 of the menstrual cycle was associated
with reduced fecundability (20).
Other studies have measured stress at a more granular level,
with either daily stress diaries or measurement of salivary bio-
markers of stress. In the Mount Sinai Study of Women Office
Workers, a 1-unit increase in self-reported daily stress levels
during the ovulatory and preovulatory windows was associ-
ated with 46% and 27% reductions in fecundability, respec-
tively (21). Among 274 female pregnancy planners from the
United Kingdom, a 1-unit increase in the natural logarithm of
salivary α-amylase measured on the sixth day of each men-
strual cycle was associated with a 10% reduction in first-cycle
fecundability (95% CI: 29, −13) (18). Likewise, pregnancy
planners from Michigan and Texas (n = 373) in the highest
tertile of salivary α-amylase (measured on first day of the first

 observed menstrual cycle) had a fecundability odds ratio of
0.71 (95% CI: 0.51, 1.00) compared with the lowest tertile
(19). We did not measure stress during specific windows of
susceptibility, for example, during ovulation or implantation.
We ascertained PSS score every 8 weeks, but we asked the
questions in reference to the previous 4 weeks. When we restricted
the analysis to the first observed cycle of pregnancy attempt, our
results were stronger, indicating possible attenuation from nondif-
ferential exposure misclassification.
Consistency in results across baseline, time-varying, and
cumulative average analyses could relate to the strong corre-
lations among the 3 measures: correlation coefficients ranged
from 0.88 to 0.97, and over 75% of women remained in the
same PSS score category throughout follow-up. Neither our
study nor others studying fecundability have measured stress
over longer periods of time.
Ours is, to our knowledge, the first study to report that a
male partner’s stress might modify the association between
the female partner’s stress and fecundability, with partner-
stress discordance resulting in stronger associations. Given
the small number of couples in each category when cross-
classified by stress, these findings might be due to chance.
However, concordance of stress levels between partners could
be a marker for relationship quality. The “buffering model” of
stress hypothesizes that positive quality relationships can buffer
the health effects of stress (58). If relationship quality modifies
the association between stress and fecundability, and if partner
stress discordance is a marker of relationship quality, this could
explain the association among women whose partners report
low levels of perceived stress.
Mediation analysis results indicated that intercourse fre-
quency and irregular cycles, but not other factors, each ex-
plained a meaningful proportion (approximately 10%) of the
association between PSS and fecundability. This observation
indicates that if perceived stress exerts a causal effect on fer-
tility, it is likely through decreased intercourse frequency,
increased irregular cycles, and/or mechanisms not measured
in our study.

 Difficulty conceiving can cause stress (59); thus this associ-
ation is particularly susceptible to reverse causation. However,
associations were stronger among women who had been at-
tempting conception for 0–2 cycles at enrollment, indicating
that reverse causation was unlikely.
We found that the inverse association between PSS score
and fecundability was present only among women <35 years of
age. The absence of an association among older women might
reflect chance variation, the higher baseline risk for infertility
among older women, or biological differences related to age.
The lack of repeated measures of men’s perceived stress
precluded an examination of the relationship between men’s
time-varying PSS scores and fecundability. Baseline and
time-varying results among women, however, were similar,
implying that either the timing of stress was not an important
factor or we had insufficient variability in stress over time to
assess the extent to which acute versus chronic stress is im-
portant for fecundability. To the extent that our measure of
stress was outside of a relevant time window, nondifferential
misclassification would have attenuated our findings.
Women with lower income, less education, or higher body
mass index are less likely to recognize their pregnancies early
in gestation (60). These factors are also positively associated
with stress. If stress delays pregnancy recognition, then out-
come misclassification could have biased our results because
nonstressed women would identify pregnancy losses earlier

 than stressed women. However, we found that women with
PSS scores of <10 and ≥25 had similar mean gestational ages
at positive pregnancy test (4.2 and 4.4 weeks, respectively),
providing little evidence for pregnancy recognition bias.
Stressed women might be at higher risk of unplanned preg-
nancy (61), and unplanned pregnancies likely occur among more
fecund women. Therefore, studies restricted to pregnancy plan-
ners might be susceptible to selection bias. However, many Preg-
nancy Study Online participants enroll at the beginning of their
pregnancy attempt time. These women represent the full fertility
spectrum, including those who conceive right away and those
who take longer. Among women attempting pregnancy for
0 or 1 cycles at study entry, results were stronger than in the
main analysis, indicating that a pregnancy planning bias is
unlikely to explain our findings.
Adjustment for a wide range of demographic, behavioral,
reproductive, and dietary variables did not substantially alter
the association between PSS and fecundability, indicating lit-
tle confounding by measured variables. Nevertheless, unmea-
sured confounding could have affected our results.
Women with higher baseline PSS scores were more likely
to be lost to follow-up than those with lower scores. Account-
ing for potential differential attrition using inverse probability
weights made little difference in our results.
Internet-based recruitment should not affect the internal valid-
ity of the study unless the relationship between perceived stress
and fecundability differs according to internet access, which
seems unlikely. Further, we have demonstrated in an internet-
based cohort of Danish pregnancy planners that even when
enrollment is related to factors such as age or parity, the mea-
sures of association are not biased (62).
There are several biological mechanisms through which wo-
men’s stress could directly affect fecundability. Stress is associ-
ated with higher levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone and
glucocorticoids, which suppress the function of gonadotropin-
releasing hormone and could delay or inhibit the luteinizing
hormone surge of the menstrual cycle (14). Glucocorticoids
could also suppress the uterine cytokine NF-κB and local
inflammation, which are essential for implantation (17, 63).
Stress might also reduce ovarian reserve, given that salivary
α-amylase has been related to lower levels of anti-Müllerian
hormone (64). Moreover, a study of couples undergoing in vitro
fertilization found an association between nonfertility stressors
and reduced conception, and the association was partially medi-
ated by a lower number of oocytes harvested during oocyte
retrieval (65).
In summary, in this large prospective cohort study, high lev-
els of perceived stress among women were associated with
reduced fecundability. Part of the association might be medi-
ated through decreased intercourse frequency and increased
risk of irregular cycles.
