urrently, 29.1 million people, or 9.3% of the US population, have diabetes mel-
litus.1 Complications in patients with diabetes include cardiovascular disease 
(CVD), stroke, limb amputation, and microvascular complications such as ne-
phropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
has estimated that total direct medical costs for all types of diabetes in the United States are 
estimated at $176 billion annually.1 Indirect costs from disability, work loss, and premature 
death add up to another $69 billion.1 
 
Although taking medications to control blood glucose, lipid levels, and blood pressure 
is important for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), developing a healthy lifestyle 
consisting of a well-balanced diet and physical activity is also essential for controlling CVD 
risk factors and preventing the multitude of difficult and costly complications that accom-
pany this chronic disease.1-3
Effectiveness of the Complete Health Improvement  
Program in Reducing Risk Factors for Cardiovascular 
Disease in an Appalachian Population 
Christopher Leibold, OMS III; Jay H. Shubrook, DO; Masato Nakazawa, PhD;  
and David Drozek, DO
Context: In 11 counties in Appalachian Ohio, the self-reported prevalence of diabetes 
mellitus (11.3%) is higher than the state (7.8%) or national (7.2%) average. Direct medi-
cal costs for diabetes in the United States are estimated at $176 billion annually. Indirect 
costs from disability, work loss, and premature death add up to another $69 billion. 
Objective: To determine the effectiveness of the Complete Health Improvement 
Program (CHIP) in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in a sample 
of Appalachian participants with elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels or a 
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods: In a retrospective study, data from 6 CHIP cohorts conducted in Appala-
chian Ohio from 2011 to 2012 were combined and analyzed for short-term changes 
in CVD risk factors from baseline. This study focused on a subsample of the overall 
CHIP, whose participants had elevated FBG levels or T2DM. Statistical analysis was 
completed by calculating means and SDs and using paired t tests to compare differ-
ences in variables. 
Results: After the CHIP intervention, 110 participants with baseline elevated FBG 
levels showed notable reductions in FBG levels, total cholesterol, low-density lipo-
protein cholesterol, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure (all P values <.001). 
Likewise, participants in the subsample with T2DM experienced reductions in all 
CVD risk factors (all P values <.05). 
Conclusion: The CHIP lifestyle intervention was effective in reducing CVD risk 
 
factors in this Appalachian population with elevated FBG levels or with T2DM.

For the larger study, participants were recruited through 
announcements in churches, the local media, or from local 
health care providers. They attended 1 of several informa-
tional sessions presented throughout the community where 
they attended a combination of video and live presenta-
tions, had their questions addressed, and were offered an 
opportunity to enroll in the study. Inclusion criteria for the 
present study were enrollment in the CHIP cohorts and 
either a self-reported history of T2DM or an abnormal 
glucose level (>100 mg/dL) on intake laboratory results. 
All participants were informed that the present study re-
sults would be aggregated and reported for research pur-
poses. They were given the option of having their data 
excluded without affecting their eligibility to participate in 
CHIP. All study participants signed a consent form.
Description of CHIP
The primary focus of CHIP was the consumption of 
whole foods, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole 
grains, legumes, nuts, and 8 ten-oz glasses of water daily. 
More specific goals included overall dietary fat content 
below 20% of total calories, daily intake of added sugar 
less than 10 tsp, daily sodium less than 2000 mg, choles-
terol below 50 mg, and high fiber intake (>35 g/d). Stress 
reduction techniques and flexibility exercises were taught 
and encouraged, along with at least 30 minutes (or 10,000 
steps) of daily aerobic exercise. The intent of CHIP was 
 
to nurture intelligent self-care through enhanced under-
standing of the causes, effects, and risk factors associated 
with chronic Western diseases.4 The CHIP curriculum 
included instruction on Western medicine’s accomplish-
ments and limitations, atherosclerosis, CVD risk factors, 
smoking, exercise, dietary fiber, cholesterol, plant-based 
nutrition, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, 
lifestyle and health, behavioral change, anger manage-
ment, and self-worth. Participants were encouraged but 
were not required to consult their physicians throughout 
the program. Medications for hypertension and T2DM 
were often reduced during the course, owing to the rap-
idly achieved benefits of the intervention.10
 
Many diets and lifestyle intervention programs have 
proven beneficial for people at risk for or who already 
have a diagnosis of T2DM. One such program, the Com-
plete Health Improvement Program (CHIP), a commu-
nity-based lifestyle intervention focused on a 
plant-based, whole-food diet, has demonstrated im-
provements in various chronic diseases, including 
T2DM, across different settings in the United States and 
around the world.4 This program is facilitated by volun-
teers trained and approved by Lifestyle Medicine Insti-
tute LLC. In Athens, Ohio, CHIP is administered locally 
by Live Healthy Appalachia, a 5013C group.
 
Poorer Appalachian regions struggle with higher 
rates of disease, lack of health care providers, limited 
access to health care, and greater rates of uninsured 
people.5 In 11 counties in Appalachian Ohio, the self-re-
ported prevalence of diabetes (11.3%) is higher than the 
state (7.8%) or national (7.2%) average.6 Athens County 
is a part of Appalachia, a stretch of land covering 420 
counties and 13 states from Mississippi to New York.7 
Athens is identified as a “distressed county” of Appala-
chia and is ranked in the lowest 10% of the nation’s 
counties in terms of economic status.8 The population 
has been found to be at high risk for T2DM.9 The objec-
tive of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 
CHIP in reducing CVD risk factors in people living in 
Appalachian Ohio with elevated fasting blood glucose 
(FBG) levels or diagnoses of T2DM. We hypothesized 
that participants with dysglycemia would also achieve 
substantial benefits in cardiovascular risk factors after 
completing CHIP. 
Methods 
Study Participants
This retrospective study reports on a subgroup of a previ-
ously published CHIP study9 and was approved by the 
Ohio University Institutional Review Board. The present 
study analyzes the results of the first 6 CHIP cohorts 
(overall CHIP) studied in Athens from 2011 to 2012.

office, as part of the overall CHIP routine, and separate 
from the data collection for this study. For this study 
(CHIP diabetes), CHIP administration provided aggre-
gated data, without personal identifiers, in a password-
protected Excel (Microsoft Corporation) database file. 
 
After the second biomedical assessment was com-
pleted (before the final class session), personal and 
 
deidentified aggregated session results were given to 
each participant so they could see their personal im-
provements and how they compared with the group as a 
whole. The distribution of results was accompanied by a 
video presentation on the interpretation of the results, 
and participants were urged to continue with the newly 
acquired lifestyle changes. Participants were encouraged 
to share additional copies of the results with their pri-
mary care physician. After the final class session, partici-
pants were invited to join the local CHIP alumni group 
for ongoing support of lifestyle changes initiated during 
the intervention.
Statistical Analysis
A previous study9 analyzed the data from 6 CHIP cohorts 
conducted in Athens, Ohio, from 2011 to 2012, with a 
total enrollment of 225 volunteer participants. Data for 
participants who either self-reported a diagnosis of 
T2DM, were receiving medication for T2DM, or had an 
elevated FBG level on 1 of the biomedical assessments 
were included in the present study for analysis. 
 
Means and SDs were calculated for the change from 
baseline in all CVD risk factors. Mean change (baseline 
mean vs postintervention mean) was also calculated 
 
to demonstrate the extent of change. Paired samples 
 
t tests were applied to the mean changes to determine 
whether the changes were statistically significant across 
all participants or within subgroups (eg, men vs 
women). Mean percent change (100 × mean change/
baseline mean) was also computed. The Welch modi-
fied 2-sample t tests were computed to compare the size 
of changes between this study subset population and the 
overall CHIP.9
 
Each of the 6 cohorts consisted of 16 two-hour group 
sessions over a 4- to 8-week period. Four sessions were 
conducted in 4 weeks and met 4 times per week, and 
 
2 cohorts were 8 weeks long, with fewer meetings per 
week. Participants in this study were represented in 
both group sessions. Cohorts were usually managed 
by 2 trained facilitators with 1 or 2 additional non-
trained helpers. The number of participants per cohort 
ranged from 13 to 50. A typical session included an 
instructional video, cooking demonstration, group 
discussion, and an exercise component. Participants 
paid the tuition out of pocket or received scholarship 
assistance from their employer or local community 
organization. The cost of the course included 2 bio-
medical assessments performed at baseline and near 
the end of the program, food samples, textbook, work-
book, cookbook, water bottle, pedometer, and supple-
mentary reading and reference materials. The course 
tuition increased incrementally over the time frame 
covered by the study from $350 to $450. 
Data Collection and Reporting
Biomedical assessments were held at baseline and near 
the conclusion of the program. Preprogram and postpro-
gram differences were measured at 4 or 8 weeks de-
pending on the duration of that cohort. Participants 
completed a lifestyle questionnaire assessing their di-
etary and exercise practices, current illnesses, and medi-
cation use at baseline. A physical examination was 
performed at baseline to assess weight, height, pulse rate, 
and blood pressure. At baseline and at the conclusion of 
the sessions, blood was collected via venipuncture by 
trained phlebotomists to determine total cholesterol 
(TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyc-
eride (TG), and FBG levels. 
 
Data for each participant were entered into a pass-
word-protected proprietary Microsoft Access–based da-
tabase (Microsoft Corporation) maintained on the CHIP 
administration computer at the Live Healthy Appalachia

Results 
Of 225 participants in the overall CHIP,9 110 partici-
pants who had elevated FBG levels or T2DM met the 
current inclusion criteria (Table 1). Sixty-four partici-
pants had elevated FBG levels, and 46 had T2DM. 
Of 110 participants, 75 were women (68%). Ages of 
participants ranged from 25 to 80 years, with a mean 
age of 56.6 years. The demographics of the population 
with elevated FBG levels and T2DM were similar to 
the overall CHIP. Between the 2 subgroups of elevated 
FBG levels and T2DM, we found similarities in mean 
age, age range, and percentage of women and men. 
 
Table 2 shows the percent mean difference be-
tween pre- and postprogram values for all the CVD 
risk factors. A statistically significant (P<.05) reduc-
tion in TC levels, HDL-C, LDL-C, FBG levels, body 
mass index, and systolic blood pressure was found 
after CHIP. Although triglyceride levels and diastolic 
blood pressure (DBP) were reduced, changes were not 
statistically significant (P>.05). Table 2 also shows 
the mean percent changes of the 225 participants in 
the overall CHIP, which were similar to those in the 
current study.9
 
Participants with elevated FBG levels at baseline 
(n=64) had a statistically significant (P<.05) reduction in 
all measured CVD risk factors, with TC levels showing 
the greatest reduction after CHIP (P<.001). Participants 
with T2DM at baseline (n=46) also experienced a reduc-
tion in all risk factors. All CVD risk factor reductions in 
the T2DM subgroup were statistically significant (P<.05) 
except TC levels and DBP (P>.05). 
 
Women in the study (n=75) had a statistically signifi-
cant (P<.05) reduction in all CVD risk factors except 
DBP (P>.05). For the men (n=35), all measures demon-
strated a statistically significant (P<.05) reduction.
 
Table 3 provides further detail, listing the pre- and 
postprogram values for the 2 subgroups: those with ele-
vated FBG levels and those with T2DM. 
Discussion
Our findings demonstrate the short-term effective-
ness of the CHIP program in reducing CVD risk fac-
tors in an Appalachian population of 110 participants 
with elevated FBG levels or a diagnosis of T2DM. 
Almost all of the CVD risk factors were significantly 
improved by this program. The results in this study 
were consistent with the overall CHIP results previ-
ously published.9
 
The CHIP is a lifestyle intervention that is unique in 
several ways. It engages the community to strive for 
and reach better health. The program is short in dura-
tion but prepares participants with structure to continue 
a healthy lifestyle in the future. Participants are encour-
aged to maintain a low-fat, vegan diet with 20% of total 
calories coming from fat and an unlimited intake of 
complex carbohydrates and other plant-based, whole 
foods rather than animal products (eg, meat, dairy, and 
eggs) and fatty foods (eg, added oils, fried food). Bar-
nard et al11 reported the results of a similar low-fat, 
vegan diet demonstrating notable reductions in body 
weight, hemoglobin A1c, FBG level, and plasma lipids 
over 74 weeks compared with an American Diabetes 
Association diet.
 
In the present study, the mean FBG level was sig-
nificantly reduced by an absolute value of 11.1 mg/dL,

15% to 83% with a diet high in fruits and vegetables, 
whole grains, fish, and poultry, along with decreased 
consumption of red meat, processed foods, and sugar-
sweetened beverages.16 
 
Participants in the present study, as well as those in 
the overall CHIP, had significant reductions in 
HDL-C. Another study of a low-fat, plant-based diet 
and its effects on blood lipid level showed similar re-
ductions in HDL-C.17 Typically, an increase in HDL-C 
is desirable to provide a protective effect against 
CVD, especially for people with comorbidities who 
are at increased risk.18 A meta-analysis19 of 70 studies 
on weight reduction analyzed changes in blood lipids 
by diet type and found that participants who were ac-
tively losing weight had reductions in HDL-C. How-
ever, the analysis found that once the participants 
were at a stabilized, reduced weight, their HDL-C 
levels increased.19
 
In the current study, other than DBP and triglyceride 
levels, all other CVD risk factors lowered significantly. 
All CVD risk factors in the present study’s population 
or 9.31%. Our findings are similar to those in the Dia-
betes Prevention Program study.12 Another similarly 
structured study with the Dietary Approaches to Stop 
Hypertension diet13 showed comparable findings, 
adding further support for dietary intervention as a 
means to decrease the risk factor profile in T2DM. The 
participants in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyper-
tension study14 had a greater reduction in FBG levels 
(29.4 mg/dL) but also had a greater baseline FBG level 
(160.9 mg/dL) compared with participants in the 
present study (137.5 mg/dL). 
 
One factor contributing to the reduction of FBG 
levels could be increased fiber intake. A systematic re-
view and meta-analysis of 11 studies on high-fiber diets 
showed a similar reduction in FBG levels of 9.97 mg/
dL.14 Natural fiber from whole grains, nuts, fruits, and 
vegetables benefits those with T2DM and are encour-
aged as part of a dietary intervention for T2DM.15 An-
other systematic review of 10 large prospective studies 
on the prevention of T2DM by dietary patterns showed a 
relative risk reduction of T2DM diagnosis ranging from

years after completion of the program.23 Future re-
search could examine CHIP as the primary preven-
tion for CVD, similar to a study conducted on the 
Mediterranean diet.24 Long-term studies looking at 
major outcomes such as remission, CVD, stroke, 
and death of CHIP participants are needed. Con-
tinued studies focused on maintaining the positive 
effects and adherence to healthy lifestyle changes 
after completion of CHIP are important.25 The cur-
rent study found results consistent with previous 
studies that evaluated plant-based diets in patients 
with diabetes.26,27
had a greater reduction compared with the overall CHIP 
study findings except for TC, which was −9.64% in the 
prediabetes group and −10.3% in the T2DM group. A 
previously published CHIP study suggested that those 
with a higher risk at baseline had greater reductions 
after conclusion of the CHIP course.20 This finding is 
important for reducing the risk of macrovascular com-
plications, such as myocardial infarction, coronary ar-
tery disease, and stroke.21 Cardiovascular disease is the 
leading cause of death among patients with T2DM.22 
 
To date, CHIP has been shown to be effective in 
maintaining reductions of CVD risk factors up to 3

Limitations
Although the CHIP program demonstrated statistically 
significant results over a short period of time, the self-
selected population in the present study was motivated to 
make changes in diet and exercise, which does not neces-
sarily represent the general population. No control group 
was used. 
 
The short period of intervention (4-8 weeks) with 2 
data points and limited follow-up are additional limita-
tions. New healthy behaviors are subject to decay when 
the intervention is complete.25 Long-term reductions in 
CVD risk factors and decreased major events and out-
comes such as myocardial infarction and stroke cannot 
be determined. 
 
The variable length of the CHIP classes was a pos-
sible limitation. Four of the sessions were conducted 
over 4 weeks, and 2 of the sessions were 8 weeks in dura-
tion. The differences in session duration could have 
contributed to variability in the data and decreased the 
statistical significance. However, a previous study dem-
onstrated similar outcomes despite the differences in 
session duration.28
 
Of the 28 participants in the study who were taking dia-
betes medications, none reported an increase in medication 
dose during the course of the program, whereas 9 reported 
 
a decrease in medications either in dose or number of 
 
medications or doses. The participants did not report 
whether it was the physician who initiated the change. The 
decrease in medications could have attenuated the change in 
FBG levels, leading to an underrepresentation of the actual 
magnitude of influence of the intervention on FBG level.
Conclusion
The CHIP was effective in reducing CVD risk factors in 
an Appalachian population with elevated FBG levels 
and T2DM. Further studies are needed to examine long-
term outcomes of CHIP and its effects on macrovascular 
complications and health outcomes. We will continue to 
follow up with the participants to determine whether
