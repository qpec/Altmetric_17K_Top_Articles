Abstract
Background: A major contributor to the growing obesity crisis is screen based sedentary behaviour among young
children. Media parenting practices may be an important determinant of children’s screen time, however published
research exploring the influence of parenting practices on children’s screen time has mainly focused on children’s
television use and the parenting practices of the mother. This study examined children’s use of mobile media
devices (as well as television use) and included the role of fathers in media parenting, allowing a fuller understanding
of the role mothers’ and fathers’ media parenting practices play on children’s screen time in the current media
environment.
Methods: Secondary data analysis was conducted using data from 62 children between 1.5 and 5 years of age
and their parents (39 mothers, 25 fathers), who were part of the Guelph Family Health Study - phase 2 pilot.
Linear regression using generalized estimating equations was used to examine associations between media
parenting practices and children’s weekday and weekend screen-time.
Results: Mothers’ screen-time modeling, mealtime screen use, and use of screens to control behaviour were
positively associated with children’s weekday screen-time. Mothers’ practices of monitoring screen-time and
limiting screen-time were inversely associated with children’s weekday screen-time. Fathers’ mealtime screen
use was positively associated with children’s weekday screen-time; whereas fathers’ monitoring screen-time
and limiting setting were inversely associated with children’s weekday screen-time. Fathers’ modeling and use
of screens to control behaviour was not significantly associated with children’s weekday screen time. While
most associations were similar for weekend day screen time there were a few differences: Fathers’ use of
screens to control behaviour was positively associated with children’s weekend screen-time. Mothers’ and
fathers’ modeling and mealtime screen use were not significantly associated with children’s weekend screen
time.
Conclusion: Mothers’ and fathers’ media parenting practices were associated with children’s screen-time. Interventions
aimed at reducing children’s screen-time should address both mothers’ and fathers’ media parenting practices.

 Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes child-
hood obesity as a growing epidemic [1]. The prevalence of
children with obesity and overweight under the age of five
worldwide is estimated to be 41 million [1]. In Canada,
the rate of children with obesity is on the rise with nearly
one third of children being categorized as having over-
weight or obesity [2]. A major contributor to the growing
obesity crisis is screen based sedentary behaviour among
young children [3–5]. Both observational and intervention
research has shown that higher levels of screen time, typ-
ically measured as TV viewing, is associated with in-
creased risk of obesity among children [6, 7]. With only
15% of Canadian preschoolers meeting the Canadian Sed-
entary Behaviour Guidelines for the Early Years of less
than 1 h of recreational screen time per day [8, 9], identi-
fying effective strategies to reduce young children’s screen
time is needed. To inform such strategies, we must first
understand key determinants of children’s screen time.
Parents have been identified as playing a critical role
in the development of their young children’s weight-re-
lated behaviours, including screen time [10]. In particu-
lar, media parenting practices, defined as the specific
methods parents employ to guide the media use of their
children, may be an important determinant of children’s
screen time. Research related to media parenting prac-
tices to date has focused on children’s television time
with few studies including mobile media devices such
as tablets and smartphones [11, 12]. These mobile
media devices have soared in popularity among young
children in recent years; from 2011 to 2013 the per-
centage of 2 to 4-year-old children using mobile media
devices in the United States increased from 39 to 80%,
while television viewing time decreased [13]. Thus, re-
search aiming to understand how media parenting
practices are associated with children’s screen based
sedentary behaviours in this current media environ-
ment must include screen-time assessments that take
into consideration time spent on mobile media devices
as well as more traditional modes of screen time.
There is also limited representation of fathers in the
current research related to media parenting practices
and children’s screen time. Aftosmes-Tobio et al. [11]
examined 103 studies in their systematic review of media
parenting and childhood obesity and found that only 57
of these studies included fathers. The majority of these
studies that did include fathers combined information
across parents rather than distinguish mothers from fa-
thers. Thus, little is known about how fathers’ parenting
practices influence children’s screen time. The underrep-
resentation of fathers is particularly concerning given
emerging research identifying fathers as key stakeholders
in childhood obesity prevention. A prospective study
found that children with an obese father and a healthy
weight mother were over 10 times more likely to be
obese 4 years later than children with two healthy weight
parents, whereas the same pattern was not observed for
children with an obese mother and healthy weight father
[14]. This finding underscores the need to understand
fathers’ role in the development of childhood obesity-re-
lated behaviours, including children’s screen time.
Using data from the Guelph Family Health Study
(GFHS), a family-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada,
this study examined the associations between both
mothers’ and fathers’ parenting practices (screen time
modeling, mealtime screen use, use of screens in the
bedroom, limit setting, use of screens to control behav-
iour, and screen time monitoring) and weekend/weekday
screen time (television, computers, videogames, tablets
and smartphones) among young children aged 1.5 to
5 years.
Methods
Recruitment and eligibility
This study used baseline data collected between Febru-
ary 24, 2016 to December 15, 2016 among parents par-
ticipating in the GFHS phase 2 pilot study. The GFHS is
a family-based cohort study designed to identify early life
risk factors for obesity and chronic disease and to test
family-based approaches for health promotion. Recruit-
ment efforts included flyers and social media at local or-
ganizations who serve families with young children in
the Guelph and Wellington County, Ontario, Canada.
Families were eligible to participate in the GFHS if they
had at least one child aged 1.5–5 years at the time of re-
cruitment, lived in or near Guelph, Ontario, Canada,
had a parent who could respond to questionnaires in
English, and the children were without severe health
conditions that would prohibit participation in study ac-
tivities. Parents provided informed consent. A total of 39
families (62 children and 68 parents) participated in the
GFHS phase 2 pilot. Four fathers did not complete child
questionnaires and were therefore not included in this
study. The final analytic sample included 39 families,
with 25 of those families providing data from both
mother and father, resulting in a total of 64 parents (39
mothers and 25 fathers), and 62 children. Approximately
92% of families were two-parent households, and 8% of
families were single-parent households. The study was
approved by the University of Guelph Research Ethics
Board (REB14AP008) (Fig. 1).
Measures
Media parenting practices
To assess media parenting practices, both mothers and
fathers separately completed an on-line questionnaire
that included purpose-designed items that were in-
formed by previously designed measures to assess media

 parenting practices [15, 16]. For parents with multiple
children, one questionnaire was completed by both
mother and father for each child enrolled in the study.
The following six parenting practices were assessed: Par-
ental modeling (2 items): “when I am with my child I
use a screen based device” and “I try to limit how much
I use a screen based device when I am with my child”;
Mealtime screen use (2 items): “our family often watches
a screen during meals” and “family members are allowed
to use screen based devices during meals”; Use of
screens in bedroom (3 items): “my child falls asleep
while using a screen based device”, “a screen based de-
vice is usually playing in the room when my child falls
asleep”, and “my child has access to a mobile screen
based device in bed”; Use of screens to control behaviour
(2 items): “I offer screen time to my child as a reward
for good behaviour” and “I take away screen time from
my child as a punishment for bad behaviour”; Parental
monitoring of screen time (2 items): “I keep track of my
child’s screen time during the week” and “I keep track of
my child’s screen time during the weekend”; Limit set-
ting (3 items): “I limit my child’s screen time during the
week”, “I limit my child’s screen time during the week-
end” and “I encourage my child to do activities other
than screen time”. Response options for each media
parenting practice item included a 4-point Likert scale
ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” Re-
sponses were coded numerically from 1 to 4 and then
totalled to create a score for each media parenting prac-
tice, with the exception of limit setting and monitoring,
where score for parenting practice was totalled separ-
ately for weekday and weekend day. The parenting prac-
tice of using screens in the
child’s bedroom was
endorsed by only one out of 64 parents in the GFHS,
phase 2 pilot. Given this lack of variation, the parenting
practice of using screens in the bedroom was removed
from analysis. Separate Cronbach’s α for mothers and fa-
thers were run to measure internal consistency among
Fig. 1 Participant involvement beginning from enrollment to final analytic sample for the Guelph Family Health Study Phase 2 pilot
Tang et al. BMC Obesity  (2018) 5:37 
Page 3 of 10
 questions asked within each of the six parenting prac-
tices (Table 1). For parental modeling, there was poor
internal consistency (Cronbach’s α for Mothers = 0.12,
Fathers = 0.36), resulting in the modelling item “I try to
limit how much I use a screen based device when I am
with my child” being excluded, and “when I am with my
child I use a screen based device” to be examined inde-
pendently.
The
remaining
four
parenting
practices
showed good internal consistency for both mothers and
fathers ranging between 0.72 and 0.95 (Table 1). In
addition to measuring these parenting practices, we also
assessed parent overall screen time using the same ques-
tions used to assess child screen time (described below).
Child screen time
Parent one, defined as the first parent to enroll in the
study, reported on children’s total recreational screen
time on an average weekday and weekend day. In the
questionnaire, screen time was defined for parents as
“any time that is spent on screens such as television, cell
phones, iPads or tablets, and videogames.” The specific
questions were “not including screen time for school/
homework, how many hours does your child spend on
screens on an average weekday?” and “not including
screen time for school/homework, how many hours does
your child spend on screens on an average weekend
day?” Response options were none, less than 1 h per day,
2–3 h per day, 4–6 h per day, and 7 or more hours per
day. Response options were coded as 0, 1, 2.5, 5, and 7,
respectively. Weekday and weekend day screen times
were examined separately as research suggests that level
of children’s screen time and associations between media
parenting practices and children’s screen time may differ
between weekdays and weekend days [17].
Covariates
Parent one provided the information for household in-
come, number of children in the family, and sex of the
child on the baseline questionnaire. Child age was calcu-
lated using the child’s birthdate and the date of the
child’s baseline assessment.
Weight, height, and BMI
Parent and child weight, height and BMI were collected
at the University of Guelph in the Body Composition
Lab during the baseline health assessment visit. Height
was measured using a wall-mounted stadiometer with
barefoot or socks and no hair accessories. Two height
measurements were taken and if there was a difference
greater than 0.5 cm, a third measurement was taken.
The final height measurement was a calculated using the
average of the two closest measurements. Weight was
taken using the BOD POD™ digital scale and were bare-
foot or in socks. BMI (kg/m2) for adults was calculated
using the weight measurement in kilograms divided by
the average height measurement in meters squared. For
children, the BMI z-score was calculated using WHO
Anthro [18] and WHO AnthroPlus [19].
Statistical analysis
SAS University Edition, version 3.6 [20] was used to per-
form all analyses. Linear regression using generalized es-
timating equations was used to determine whether
associations exist between media parenting practices
(parental modeling, mealtime screen use, use of screens
in bedroom, use of screens to control behaviour, parental
monitoring of screen time, and limit setting) and chil-
dren’s screen time (weekend and weekday) while adjust-
ing for correlations among study participants. Analyses
were stratified by parent gender and by weekday/week-
end day of child screen time. All models included house-
hold income, number of children in the family, child sex,
and child age. Significance was determined as p < 0.05.

Discussion
This study examined the associations between media
parenting practices and young children’s screen time
among a sample of Canadian families with children aged
1.5–5 years. Overall, this sample had a lower rate of
overweight and obesity [21], and a higher median in-
come compared to the Canadian Population [22]. The
results show that the media parenting practices of both
mothers and fathers influence the amount of time chil-
dren spend in front of screens. Regression coefficient es-
timates for each significant association range from 0.15

 to 0.58, translating to between 9 and 35 min of children’s
screen time per day, per unit increase in the respective
parenting practice, which suggests these parenting prac-
tices have a meaningful impact on children’s screen time.
For weekday mealtime screen use, monitoring screen
time and limit setting, and weekend using screens to
control behaviour and monitoring screen time the re-
gression coefficient estimates remain relatively consist-
ent, suggesting that both mothers and fathers may have
a similar influence on children’s screen time.
The parenting practice of mealtime screen use for both
mothers and fathers resulted in children spending more
time during the weekdays in front of a screen-based de-
vice. These results support previous research from the
Canadian TARGet Kids! study, which found that one of
the factors significantly associated with increased total
daily screen time was television viewing during meals
[23]. Taken together, these findings suggest that inter-
ventions focused on reducing mealtime screen use has
the potential to reduce children’s overall screen time.
Both mother’s and fathers’ use of screens to control
behaviour was positively associated with children’s
screen time. These results mirror what has been found
in research examining parental influences on children’s
physical activity and dietary intake. Research has shown
that when parents use food to control behaviour, chil-
dren have a greater dietary intake of those same foods
[24]. This is also true for physical activity. A study by
Vaughn et al. [16] found that the use of physical activity
as a reward for good behaviour was positively associ-
ated with physical activity. Taken together, these results
suggest that using physical activity, food, or screen time
to control children’s behaviours may lead to higher
levels of those same behaviours. Alternatively, it may be
that when parents are trying to control their children’s
behaviour, they choose a reward or punishment that
they know their child values, i.e., they only select screen
time as a reward when their child really values screen
time. Children who really value screen time may watch
more screen time, in general. Thus, this association be-
tween parental control and screen time may be partly
due to reverse causation. Longitudinal research is
needed to help determine temporal order of parenting
practices and children’s screen time.
The association between father’s use of screens to con-
trol child behaviour and child screen time was signifi-
cant only for children’s weekend screen time. This may
be due to the greater availability and involvement of fa-
thers with their children on weekends as compared to
weekdays. This increase in weekend involvement is de-
scribed in a study by Yeung et al. [25], who found that
fathers of intact families have 6.5 h of involvement time
with their children on a weekend day, compared to 2.5 h
on a weekday. This study also determined that the
amount of time fathers are engaged or accessible to
children between 3 and 5 years of age is 58% that of
mothers on weekdays, and 86% that of mothers on
weekends [25], potentially further explaining why fa-
thers’ use of screens to control behaviour is significant
on weekends and not weekdays. However, more studies
that include fathers are needed to validate this result as
there is only one other study that has examined this
parenting practice. Among their sample of parents
(93% mothers) Vaughn and colleagues found that re-
moving television time as a punishment and using tele-
vision to control a child’s behaviour was positively
associated with children’s overall TV time [16].
This study was the first to investigate the association be-
tween the media parenting practice of monitoring screen
time and children’s total screen time. For both mothers
and fathers, monitoring the amount of screen time was in-
versely associated with children’s weekday and weekend
total screen time. These results demonstrate that parental
monitoring of screen time could potentially change screen
time viewing behaviour among young children and may
be an important target for interventions.
Our findings support previous research, which has
shown that the media parenting practice of limit setting
is successful in reducing children’s total screen time
[26–28]. The majority of existing studies examined
mother’s parenting practices only. One study that ex-
amined the parenting practices of mothers and fathers
among 70 Australian families of school aged children
found that the media parenting practice of limit setting
for fathers, but not mothers, was inversely associated
with children’s screen time [28]. This study builds on
previous research that examined fathers’ influence and
found that limit setting by both mothers and fathers is
inversely associated with screen time. Thus, interven-
tion approaches aiming to reduce children’s screen time
should address limit setting practices among both
mothers and fathers.
No association was found between the overall weekday
and weekend day screen time of mothers or fathers with
children’s weekday and weekend day screen time. This
finding may be due to the young age of children in this
study. A study by Carson and Janssen [29] found that
parental screen time was associated with the screen time
of children between 4 and 5 years of age, but not among
children from birth to 3 years. It is possible that parents
of young children have more opportunity to engage in
screen time away from their children, i.e., during nap
time or an early bed time. As children age and they nap
less and go to bed later, this additional awake time may
result in increased screen time for both parents and chil-
dren. Modelling of screen time, i.e., using screens in
front of their children, was positively associated with
children’s weekday and weekend screen time among

 mothers, but not among fathers. These results supported
those of Matarma et al. [12] who found that television
time of mothers, but not fathers, was positively associ-
ated with their children’s television time. This could po-
tentially be because although there has been a shift in
the diversity of family structures, mothers remain the
primary caregiver in the majority of families [30], and
are therefore spending more time with their children.
Thus, it is reasonable to believe that mothers would
exert more influence on their children through modeling
behaviours when compared to fathers. As mentioned
previously, additional research that explores fathers’ in-
fluence on children’s screen time is needed to confirm
our findings.
Only one out of 64 parents endorsed screen use in the
bedroom, and therefore we were unable to move forward
with analysis of this variable. A potential explanation for
the low practice of using screens in the bedroom could
be due to the relatively high socioeconomic status (SES)
of participants in this study, as this parenting practice
may not be as common among families with higher SES
[31]. It also may not be as common for Canadian chil-
dren to have a screen based device in their bedroom,
when compared to in the United States (U.S.), where
over half of American children have a television in their
bedroom [32]. This may point to a potential cultural dif-
ference related to the parenting practice of using screens
in the bedroom between the U.S. and Canada.
Strengths of our study included the inclusion of mo-
bile media devices such as tablets and smartphones in
our assessment of children’s screen time. This allowed
us to investigate how media parenting practices influ-
ence children’s screen based sedentary behaviours in a
way that represents the current media environment.
Second, this study included the practice of monitoring
screen time and use of screens to control behaviour,
parenting practices that are limited in the current re-
search. This allowed for better understanding of the
role a range of parenting practices have on total screen
time in young children. Lastly, the exploration of the
impact of fathers’ parenting practices helps address a
key gap in our understanding of influences on chil-
dren’s screen time behaviours.
This study had some limitations that should be consid-
ered when interpreting our results. First, both parenting
practices and children’s screen time were based on par-
ent report. This may result in social-desirability bias or
errors in estimating children’s daily average screen time.
Further, self-reported measures of screen time have vari-
able levels of validity for both children and adults when
compared to objective measures. A second limitation is
the relatively high socioeconomic status and that most
of the participants identify as Caucasian. Therefore, re-
sults may not be generalizable to ethnically diverse
families or families with lower SES. Lastly, there was no
data collected on current work status of parents. This
information would help to determine time spent with
children, which is important when considering parenting
practices such as modeling and using screens to control
behaviour. Future research should examine these associ-
ations using objective measures of screen time within
more ethnically and racially diverse populations.
The results of this study provide a more complete un-
derstanding of the influence media parenting practices
have on young children’s screen time. It is important
that children’s screen time recommendations are met,
as exceeding screen time recommendations can nega-
tively affect young children’s cognitive and emotional
development, attention span, and future academic per-
formance [33, 34] and increase the risk of childhood
obesity [6, 7]. Results from this study can be used to
guide parents in meeting screen time recommendations
that promote positive health and development among
their young children.
Conclusion
Overall, media parenting practices used by both mothers
and fathers was associated with young children’s total
screen time. Given that parents play a key role in the devel-
opment of their young children’s screen time behaviours,
and that research shows exceeding screen time recommen-
dations may have negative physical, developmental, and
psychosocial affects on young children [33, 34], fully under-
standing the influence of both mother and father media
parenting practices has on children’s screen time in the
current media environment is needed. This knowledge will
guide parents toward media parenting practices that work
to achieve the current screen time recommendations. This
study furthers that understanding by highlighting the im-
portance of targeting both mothers’ and fathers’ media par-
enting practices. Further study is needed that includes
mobile media devices in the assessment of children’s screen
time, examines the relatively understudied media parenting
practices of monitoring screen time and using screens to
control behaviour, and that includes a more ethnically di-
verse population. Research that further explores the role of
fathers’ media parenting practices on children’s screen time
is also needed.
