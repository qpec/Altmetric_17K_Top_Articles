BACKGROUND
We tested interim positron-emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) as a mea-
sure of early response to chemotherapy in order to guide treatment for patients with advanced 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
METHODS
Patients with newly diagnosed advanced classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma underwent a baseline PET-
CT scan, received two cycles of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) 
chemotherapy, and then underwent an interim PET-CT scan. Images were centrally reviewed with 
the use of a 5-point scale for PET findings. Patients with negative PET findings after two cycles 
were randomly assigned to continue ABVD (ABVD group) or omit bleomycin (AVD group) in cycles 
3 through 6. Those with positive PET findings after two cycles received BEACOPP (bleomycin, 
etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone). Radio-
therapy was not recommended for patients with negative findings on interim scans. The primary 
outcome was the difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rate between randomized 
groups, a noninferiority comparison to exclude a difference of 5 or more percentage points.
RESULTS
A total of 1214 patients were registered; 937 of the 1119 patients (83.7%) who underwent an 
interim PET-CT scan according to protocol had negative findings. With a median follow-up of 
41 months, the 3-year progression-free survival rate and overall survival rate in the ABVD 
group were 85.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82.1 to 88.6) and 97.2% (95% CI, 95.1 to 98.4), 
respectively; the corresponding rates in the AVD group were 84.4% (95% CI, 80.7 to 87.5) and 
97.6% (95% CI, 95.6 to 98.7). The absolute difference in the 3-year progression-free survival 
rate (ABVD minus AVD) was 1.6 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 5.3). Respiratory adverse 
events were more severe in the ABVD group than in the AVD group. BEACOPP was given to 
the 172 patients with positive findings on the interim scan, and 74.4% had negative findings 
on a third PET-CT scan; the 3-year progression-free survival rate was 67.5% and the overall 
survival rate 87.8%. A total of 62 patients died during the trial (24 from Hodgkin’s lymphoma), 
for a 3-year progression-free survival rate of 82.6% and an overall survival rate of 95.8%.
CONCLUSIONS
Although the results fall just short of the specified noninferiority margin, the omission of bleo-
mycin from the ABVD regimen after negative findings on interim PET resulted in a lower inci-
dence of pulmonary toxic effects than with continued ABVD but not significantly lower effi-
cacy. (Funded by Cancer Research UK and Others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00678327

T
he treatment of advanced-stage 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma with chemotherapy 
has produced high survival rates. A series 
of randomized trials has confirmed that doxoru-
bicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine 
(ABVD), first described more than 40 years ago,1 
yields cure rates of 70 to 80%, similar to the 
rates observed with more complex multidrug 
regimens.2-7 The possible exception is escalated 
therapy with bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and 
prednisone (BEACOPP), with higher-than-standard 
doses of etoposide, doxorubicin, and cyclophos-
phamide.8 This escalated regimen has been 
shown to yield higher progression-free survival 
rates than ABVD among previously untreated 
patients.9,10 Trials in which ABVD and escalated 
BEACOPP have been directly compared have not 
shown a significant difference in overall sur-
vival, but a meta-analysis of several studies has 
suggested that the 5-year survival rate may be 
5 to 10 percentage points higher with escalated 
BEACOPP than with ABVD.11
This increment is achieved at the cost of sig-
nificantly increased short-term and long-term 
toxic effects. Escalated BEACOPP carries the risk 
of permanent infertility and prolonged fatigue, 
and myelodysplasia or acute leukemia develops 
in a number of patients.12,13 There is also a risk 
of second solid cancers from the use of radiation 
therapy. ABVD does not carry these same long-
term risks. The long-term toxic effects of treat-
ment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma are important, 
because the majority of patients have a life ex-
pectancy of many years. Although ABVD is gen-
erally associated with acceptable adverse-event 
rates, it carries the risk of serious pulmonary 
toxic effects as a result of the bleomycin expo-
sure.14 The risk increases with age and with 
consolidation radiotherapy to the thorax, which 
is typically used when there are bulky lymph 
nodes at presentation or when residual masses 
remain at the end of chemotherapy.
In the context of these observations, we sought 
to explore the potential for adapting therapy by 
de-escalating treatment for patients with a good 
outlook and intensifying it for those at highest 
risk for treatment failure. Retrospective analyses 
suggest that positron-emission tomography (PET) 
with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) after two cy-
cles of ABVD was predictive: patients with low 
FDG uptake had a 2-year progression-free sur-
vival rate of 95%, whereas those with high FDG 
uptake had a rate of only 13%,15 though more 
recent estimates are substantially higher. We 
designed a prospective trial to test a response-
adapted approach, performing FDG-PET scans 
in patients after two cycles of ABVD and modify-
ing treatment according to the results. In pa-
tients who had negative PET findings, a random-
ized comparison tested whether the omission of 
bleomycin from subsequent cycles had any effect 
on control of the lymphoma or the toxic effects 
of therapy. Patients who had positive PET find-
ings underwent intensification with escalated 
BEACOPP or an accelerated version (BEACOPP-14) 
involving growth-factor support, both with re-
peat FDG-PET scanning to evaluate outcomes.
Methods
Eligibility
Previously untreated patients 18 years of age or 
older with advanced classic Hodgkin’s lympho-
ma that was confirmed by histologic analysis 
were eligible if they were fit to receive a full 
course of combination chemotherapy. Staging 
comprised clinical assessment; contrast-enhanced 
computed tomography (CT) of the neck, thorax, 
abdomen, and pelvis; and bone marrow biopsy. 
Advanced stage was defined as an Ann Arbor 
stage of IIB to IV, or stage IIA with adverse fea-
tures: bulky disease (>33% of the transthoracic 
diameter or >10 cm elsewhere) or at least three 
involved sites. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all patients before trial entry.
PET Scanning
Patients underwent PET-CT scanning with low-
dose unenhanced CT within 28 days before 
enrollment. PET-CT scans were acquired at 
60±10 minutes after the intravenous injection of 
350 to 550 MBq of FDG, as reported previously.16 
Subsequent PET-CT scanning was performed un-
der the same conditions and on the same scan-
ner as baseline scanning. Scans were centrally 
reported by a network of national core laborato-
ries in the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, Den-
mark, and Australia.17 Scans were scored by two 
readers at each core laboratory who were un-
aware of the patient’s clinical status. Differences 
were resolved by consensus between two doctors

Interim PET Scan in Advanced Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
at the same core laboratory, or when agreement 
could not be reached, by a third doctor at an-
other core laboratory.
Interim PET-CT scanning was performed 9 to 
13 days after the preceding dose of chemother-
apy. PET findings were scored with the use of a 
5-point scale, according to the level of any re-
sidual FDG uptake at involved sites on baseline 
PET.18 A score of 1 (no uptake), 2 (slight uptake 
but lower than uptake in the normal mediastinal 
blood pool), or 3 (uptake equal to or slightly 
above uptake in the blood pool but less than 
uptake in the liver) was regarded as indicating 
negative findings, and a score of 4 (uptake mod-
erately higher than uptake in the liver) or 5 (up-
take markedly higher than uptake in the liver) 
was regarded as indicating positive findings.
Trial Design
This was a prospective, randomized, controlled 
trial to determine whether the omission of 
bleomycin after negative findings on an interim 
PET-CT scan could yield a noninferior progres-
sion-free survival rate at 3 years, as compared 
with the rate among patients who continued 
standard ABVD. It also assessed the progression-
free survival rate among patients with positive 
findings on an interim PET-CT scan, for com-
parison with historical controls.
After initial staging and a baseline PET-CT 
scan, all patients received two cycles of standard 
ABVD chemotherapy, given at full dose and on 
schedule irrespective of the blood count, if they 
were well enough to receive treatment. An in-
terim PET-CT scan was performed after the 
second cycle. The images were transmitted to a 
national core laboratory for scoring within 72 
hours. Patients with a PET score of 1 to 3 were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to continue 
ABVD or receive the same regimen without bleo-
mycin (AVD) for a further four cycles. Random-
ization was performed by the Cancer Research 
UK and University College London Cancer Trials 
Centre, with stratification according to PET 
score and center. Patients with a PET score of 
4 or 5 received either BEACOPP-14 or escalated 
BEACOPP (for doses and schedules, see the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org), with the regi-
men chosen in advance by each treatment center. 
Those receiving BEACOPP-14 had a third PET-CT 
scan after four cycles, and those receiving esca-
lated BEACOPP were reassessed after three cy-
cles. Patients with negative findings on the third 
PET-CT scan completed either two further cycles 
of BEACOPP-14 or one more cycle of escalated 
BEACOPP. Patients who had positive findings on 
the third PET-CT scan underwent further salvage 
treatment in accordance with local protocols.
Patients with negative findings on the interim 
or third PET-CT scans were not recommended to 
receive consolidation radiotherapy, although local 
investigators had discretion to use radiotherapy 
if they believed it was necessary. Patients with 
negative findings on the interim PET-CT scan 
did not undergo repeat PET-CT evaluation at the 
completion of therapy. Patients underwent clini-
cal evaluation every 3 months in year 1, every 
4 months in year 2, every 6 months in year 3, 
and annually thereafter. A CT scan was obtained 
at 3 months and at 1 year after the completion 
of all therapy, but there were no other protocol-
mandated CT or PET-CT scans during follow-up.
Trial Oversight
The authors designed the trial, and they vouch 
for the accuracy and completeness of the data 
and for the fidelity of this report to the protocol 
(available at NEJM.org). No commercial support 
was provided, and no commercial entity had any 
role in study design, data accrual, data analysis, 
or manuscript preparation.
Statistical Analysis
This trial was designed as a noninferiority trial 
in which the principal outcome was the differ-
ence between the randomized groups in the rate 
of progression-free survival at 3 years, measured 
from the date of registration to the date of first 
appearance of disease progression, relapse, or 
death from any cause. On the basis of previous 
publications, we assumed that 75% of patients 
would have negative findings on the interim 
PET-CT scan, with a 3-year progression-free sur-
vival rate of 95%. We calculated that 101 events 
of disease progression, relapse, or death in the 
randomized group would be required for the 
trial to have 90% power to exclude a 5-percent-
age-point difference at 3 years, using a one-sided 
alpha of 0.025 (target sample size, 950 randomly 
assigned patients; see the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Secondary outcomes included the progres-

sion-free survival rate among patients with posi-
tive findings on the interim PET-CT scan who 
were assigned to BEACOPP; the overall survival 
rate; and short-term and long-term toxic effects, 
with assessments including serial evaluations of 
respiratory function.
Results
Patients
From August 2008 through December 2012, a 
total of 1203 eligible patients were registered at 
138 participating centers in the United King-
dom, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, 
Sweden, and Denmark (Fig. 1; a full list of cen-
ters and investigators is provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The median age was 33 years 
(range, 18 to 79), 54.5% of patients were men, 
and 41.6% had stage II disease, 30.2% stage III 
disease, and 28.3% stage IV disease. Systemic B 
symptoms (i.e., weight loss, night sweats, and 
fever) were present in 61.3% of the patients, and 
32.1% had bulky disease.
PET-CT Scans
After two cycles of ABVD, 1119 patients under-
went an interim PET-CT scan according to pro-
tocol (an additional 16 patients were excluded 
owing to deviations from the PET-CT protocol). 
Central review showed a PET score of 1 in 111 
patients (9.9%), a score of 2 in 483 (43.2%), a 
score of 3 in 343 (30.7%), a score of 4 in 144 
(12.9%), and a score of 5 in 38 (3.4%). Overall, 
937 patients (83.7%) had negative PET findings 
(a score of 1 through 3). Pretreatment character-
istics of the patients with negative findings 
and those with positive findings are shown in 
Table 1.
Randomization of Patients with Negative PET 
Findings
All but 2 of the 937 patients with negative find-
ings on the interim PET-CT scan underwent 
randomization, with 470 assigned to the ABVD 
group and 465 assigned to the AVD group. Only 
10 patients did not receive the assigned therapy: 
8 in the AVD group (2 elected to continue ABVD, 
5 withdrew for other reasons, and 1 died before 
starting cycle 3) and 2 in the ABVD group (both 
were treated with AVD owing to pulmonary 
toxic effects) (Fig. 1). The number of patients 
completing a total six cycles of treatment was 
458 in the ABVD group (97.9%) and 446 in the 
AVD group (97.6%). In the ABVD group, only 
4.3% of the total planned bleomycin doses were 
omitted and 3.2% were given at less than 90% 
of the planned dose. One patient (in the ABVD 
group) died during treatment, 10 withdrew ow-
ing to toxic effects, and 10 withdrew for other 
reasons. Consolidation radiotherapy was admin-
istered to 12 patients (2.6%) in the ABVD group 
and 20 (4.3%) in the AVD group.
Outcomes in the Randomized Group with 
Negative PET Findings
At a median of 41.2 months (range, 2.0 to 79.7) 
of follow-up after randomization, 142 events of 
disease progression, relapse, or death had oc-
curred; events did not differ significantly between 
the patients who continued ABVD and those who 
received AVD (hazard ratio with AVD, 1.13; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.57; P 
= 
0.48) 
(Table 2 and Fig. 2). The 3-year progression-free 
survival rate was 85.7% (95% CI, 82.1 to 88.6) in 
the ABVD group and 84.4% (95% CI, 80.7 to 
87.5) in the AVD group, with a difference (ABVD 
minus AVD) at 3 years of 1.6 percentage points 
(95% CI, −3.2 to 5.3). The two groups also 
showed similar 3-year overall survival rates: 
97.2% (95% CI, 95.1 to 98.4) with ABVD and 
97.6% (95% CI, 95.6 to 98.7) with AVD. A per-
protocol analysis that excluded the 10 patients 
who did not receive the randomly assigned treat-
ment had similar results (Table 2). Subgroup 
analysis of the randomly assigned patients

of the Patients and Outcomes of Positron-Emission 
 
Tomography–Computed Tomography (PET-CT).
PET findings on the interim PET-CT scan were scored 
with the use of a 5-point scale, according to the level  
of any residual uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose at in-
volved sites on baseline PET and with higher scores 
 
indicating greater uptake. A score of 1, 2, or 3 was re-
garded as indicating negative findings, and a score of  
4 or 5 was regarded as indicating positive findings. 
BEACOPP-14 is an accelerated version of BEACOPP 
(bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophospha-
mide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) that 
involves growth-factor support. Escalated BEACOPP 
involves higher-than-standard doses of etoposide, 
doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. ABVD denotes 
doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, 
AVD doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, DLBCL 
diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, and NLPHL nodular 
lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

Positron-emission tomographic (PET) findings on the interim PET–computed tomographic (PET-CT) scan were scored with the use of a 
5-point scale, according to the level of any residual uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose at involved sites on baseline PET and with higher scores 
indicating greater uptake. A score of 1, 2, or 3 was regarded as indicating negative findings, and a score of 4 or 5 was regarded as indicating 
positive findings. ABVD denotes doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, AVD doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, and 
BEACOPP bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone.

Interim PET Scan in Advanced Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
vival rate of 90.0% (95% CI, 86.4 to 92.6) among 
patients with stage II disease, versus 83.1% (95% 
CI, 78.2 to 87.0) among those with stage III dis-
ease and 79.6% (95% CI, 73.8 to 84.2) among 
those with stage IV disease (P<0.001). A similar 
but less strong effect was seen for prognostic 
score, and older patients had a higher rate of 
events than younger patients. There was no sig-
nificant association with bulky disease, B symp-
toms, or PET score (Tables S1 and S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix), nor did this change 
when data from the small number of patients 
who were treated with consolidation radiotherapy 
were censored. The toxic effects of continued 
ABVD treatment were greater than those of AVD, 
with more grade 3 or 4 respiratory events (Table 3). 
In a longitudinal analysis, the absolute differ-
ence between the ABVD group and AVD group 
in the change in the diffusing capacity of the 
lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) from baseline 
to the completion of therapy was −7.4 percentage 
points (95% CI, 5.1 to 9.7; P<0.001); this effect 
persisted at 1 year, with an absolute difference 
between groups of −4.6 percentage points (95% 
CI, 1.6 to 7.5; P 
= 
0.003).

An additional four deaths occurred in patients who withdrew from the trial before randomization: two from Hodgkin’s lymphoma (one

The absolute difference (ABVD minus AVD) in the intention-to-treat analysis was 1.6 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], −3.2 
to 5.3). The difference was calculated by applying the hazard ratio to the 3-year estimate in the AVD group, the group with more events of 
disease progression, relapse, or death. With adjustment for stratification factors (PET score and center), the absolute difference was 1.0 per-
centage points (95% CI, −4.3 to 5.0). In the per-protocol analysis, the absolute difference was 1.3 percentage points (95% CI, −3.7 to 5.1).

The hazard ratio (AVD vs. ABVD) in the intention-to-treat analysis was 1.13 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.57; two-tailed P = 0.48 for the null hypothesis of 
a hazard ratio of 1.00; one-tailed P = 0.11 for the null hypothesis of a hazard ratio of ≥1.39 [i.e., a difference of 5 percentage points from 80.7% 
to 85.7%] vs. the alternative hazard ratio of <1.39). In the per-protocol analysis, the hazard ratio was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.53; P = 0.58).

scan were available for 160 patients, of whom 
119 (74.4%) had negative findings. Of these pa-
tients, 20 went on to receive consolidation radio-
therapy. In the group with positive PET findings 
overall, there have been 22 deaths and 55 events 
of disease progression, relapse, or death as fol-
low-up continues (Table 2). Further chemo-
therapy was given for consolidation after sal-
vage therapy in 24 patients (additional cycles of 
BEACOPP in 11, other salvage regimens in 6, 
and high-dose therapy in 7), 1 patient received 
brentuximab vedotin, and 43 received radio-
therapy. The 3-year progression-free survival rate 
for the group as a whole was 67.5% (95% CI, 59.7 
to 74.2), and the overall survival rate was 87.8% 
(95% CI, 81.5 to 92.1) (Fig. 2). The nonrandom-
ized comparison of BEACOPP-14 and escalated 
BEACOPP did not show a significant difference 
in outcomes between regimens, and toxic effects 
were broadly similar, except for higher rates of 
thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia with 
escalated BEACOPP (Table 3).
Discussion
The principal aim of this trial was to determine 
whether an interim FDG-PET scan could be used 
to guide the de-escalation of therapy for patients 
with a high probability of cure after ABVD ther-
apy and escalation for those at higher risk for

Interim PET Scan in Advanced Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
treatment failure. The intention was to reserve 
more intensive treatment for patients whose poor 
prognosis justified the added risk. The overall 
results of this approach appear favorable as com-
pared with those of our previous studies that 
involved full-course ABVD and more consolida-
tion radiotherapy.5,6 This trial population as a 
whole had a progression-free survival rate of 
82.6% (83.7% among patients <60 years of age), 
and only 78 of the 1203 patients (6.5%) received 
radiotherapy, as compared with a progression-
free survival rate of 75% and 80% in the two 
preceding trials, in which consolidation radio-
therapy was given in 38% and 53% of patients, 
respectively. In all these studies, patients with 
stage II disease but systemic symptoms or other 
adverse features were included, because standard 
care is usually with a full course of chemother-
apy, but it is evident that the results in this 
group are generally better than in patients with 
stage III and IV disease.
The primary outcome measure was the pro-
gression-free survival rate among patients who 
were randomly assigned to continue or stop 
bleomycin after negative findings on an interim 
PET-CT scan; the aim was to exclude a difference 
of 5 percentage points at 3 years. The observed 
upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval 
(5.3 percentage points) was just over this mar-
gin, and this is probably due to the lower-than-
expected 3-year progression-free survival rate of 
85.7% in the ABVD group, which would require

more events to exclude a 5-percentage-point dif-
ference.
Subgroup analysis that was designed to iden-
tify those at higher risk for treatment failure also 
showed similar progression-free survival rates in 
the two groups, except for the paradoxical find-
ing that there was an apparent advantage to 
continuing ABVD in those without B symptoms. 
This is not easily explained on biologic grounds. 
Adherence to the protocol-specified therapy was 
good, with excellent delivery of the first two 
cycles of ABVD and more than 90% of bleomycin 
doses given as planned for those in the ABVD 
group. An important feature of the protocol of 
the present trial was the advice to proceed with 
full-dose chemotherapy irrespective of the blood 
count whenever possible, on the basis of previ-
ous studies that showed the feasibility of this 
approach.19,20 Our findings may be compared with 
those of the recent German Hodgkin Study Group 
(GHSG) HD13 trial involving patients with early-
stage Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which used only 
two cycles of ABVD before involved-field radio-
therapy and showed that the 5-year rate of free-
dom from treatment failure was 3.9 percentage 
points higher with ABVD than with AVD.21
We conclude from these findings that the 
inclusion of bleomycin in the first two cycles 
may still make a positive contribution to the 
control of disease, but its omission after nega-
tive findings on an interim PET-CT scan carries 
a minimal risk of treatment failure, estimated in 
our trial to be 1.6%, and there was no signifi-
cant difference in survival between the random-
ized groups. This approach does, however, re-
duce toxic effects; in particular, we found that 
the omission of bleomycin lowered the incidence 
of fatigue and respiratory events and led to bet-
ter preservation of DLco.
We found that the rate of recurrence among 
patients with negative findings on an interim 
PET-CT scan was higher than the rate in retro-
spective series. This has been a common finding 
in other large prospective trials that took the 
same approach. Despite very careful quality con-
trol and rigorous prospective central review of all 
interim scans, the 3-year progression-free sur-
vival rate among patients with negative findings 
on an interim PET-CT scan in this trial was 
84.9%, as compared with 95% in one large retro-
spective series.15 A U.S. Intergroup trial showed 
a 1-year progression-free survival rate of 85%,22 
and the Italian HD0607 trial showed a 4-year 
failure-free survival rate of 85%,23 confirming 
that the negative predictive value of interim PET 
imaging is less than that previously reported. 
The consistency of this finding across different 
groups suggests that this is a reflection of the 
technical validity of the test rather than errors of 
interpretation. Analysis of baseline prognostic 
factors suggested that patients with a higher Ann 
Arbor stage or international prognostic score had 
a higher likelihood of recurrence after negative 
findings on an interim PET-CT scan. Neither 
bulky disease nor the PET score (1 to 3) had a 
significant effect on the risk of recurrence.
On the basis of these findings, it does not 
appear that the results are worse in the group of 
patients who would normally have received con-
solidation radiotherapy on the basis of bulky dis-
ease or residual masses, and the overall results 
suggest that the approach of omitting radio-
therapy after negative findings on an interim 
PET-CT is appropriate. It is possible that the 
negative predictive value might be improved by 
performing the scan after one cycle rather than 
two,24 but this requires prospective evaluation, 
as does the use of biologic stratification with the 
use of immunohistochemical or gene-expression 
analysis, both of which have been proposed to 
be predictive of treatment failure.25,26
The escalation of therapy for patients with 
positive findings on an interim PET-CT scan was 
effective in roughly two thirds of cases, with a 
3-year progression-free survival rate of 67.5%. 
This rate was substantially higher than that ob-
served in retrospective series in which patients 
continued ABVD15 and is similar to the rates in 
other series in which patients received BEACOPP 
after positive findings on an interim PET scan, 
such as the U.S. Intergroup trial and the Italian 
HD0607 trial.22,23 None of these was a random-
ized comparison, so the precise effect of escala-
tion remains uncertain, despite the historical 
controls. Even after escalation, there was a sug-
gestion that patients with an interim PET score 
of 5 are at a higher risk for relapse than those 
with lower scores, with 20 treatment failures 
among the 38 patients. This suggests that alter-
native approaches such as early myeloablative 
therapy or combinations with antibody–drug 
conjugates should be tested in this group, al-
though the number of patients involved is small. 
BEACOPP-14 and escalated BEACOPP appeared 
similar in efficacy in this nonrandomized com-
parison, which is consistent with data from the

GHSG HD15 trial, in which a formal compari-
son suggested substantial similarity.27
In conclusion, disease control of advanced 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma after interim-PET–adapted 
therapy showed overall outcomes at least as good 
as in our previous studies. Longer follow-up will 
be required to establish whether reduction in the 
use of bleomycin and consolidation radiotherapy 
may affect long-term morbidity and mortality.
