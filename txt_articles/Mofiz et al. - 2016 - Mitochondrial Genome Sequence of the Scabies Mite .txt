Abstract
The scabies mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, is an obligate parasite of the skin that infects humans
and other animal species, causing scabies, a contagious disease characterized by extreme
itching. Scabies infections are a major health problem, particularly in remote Indigenous
communities in Australia, where co-infection of epidermal scabies lesions by Group A
Streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus is thought to be responsible for the high rate of
rheumatic heart disease and chronic kidney disease. We collected and separately
sequenced mite DNA from several pools of thousands of whole mites from a porcine model
of scabies (S. scabiei var. suis) and two human patients (S. scabiei var. hominis) living in dif-
ferent regions of northern Australia. Our sequencing samples the mite and its metagenome,
including the mite gut flora and the wound micro-environment. Here, we describe the mito-
chondrial genome of the scabies mite. We developed a new de novo assembly pipeline
based on a bait-and-reassemble strategy, which produced a 14 kilobase mitochondrial
genome sequence assembly. We also annotated 35 genes and have compared these to
other Acari mites. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and used these to
infer the presence of six haplogroups in our samples, Remarkably, these fall into two
closely-related clades with one clade including both human and pig varieties. This supports
earlier findings that only limited genetic differences may separate some human and animal
varieties, and raises the possibility of cross-host infections. Finally, we used these mito-
chondrial haplotypes to show that the genetic diversity of individual infections is typically
small with 1–3 distinct haplotypes per infestation.

 Author Summary
The scabies mite is a skin parasite that infects humans and other animal species, causing
scabies, a contagious disease characterized by extreme itching. Scabies infections are a
major health problem in developing countries and in indigenous Australian populations,
where scabies is associated with pyoderma (skin sores) and linked to rheumatic fever and
rheumatic heart disease. Little is known about the genetics of the scabies mite. We have
assembled the mitochondrial genome of scabies mites obtained from human patients in
Australia and from a pig model. While investigating the genetic diversity of each infesta-
tion, we found that mitochrondial genomes clustered into two broad clades and showed
limited genetic diversity within each infestation. Remarkably, one closely related clade
included both human and pig mites, suggesting that mite transmission from pig to human
may be possible. This could have major implications in the management of porcine mange
and human scabies.
Introduction
The scabies mite is an ectoparasitic arachnid that causes an itchy skin infection, known as sca-
bies. Each year around 300 million people worldwide are affected by scabies [1]. Scabies is
responsible for a significant disease burden in affected populations through its obligate para-
sitic lifecycle, which facilitates secondary infections by other pathogens. A severe, but more
rare form of scabies, known as crusted scabies, is characterised by hyper-infestation. It gener-
ally occurs in immune-compromised individuals [2], although it can occur in patients with no
overt immunological deficiency [3]. Cases of crusted scabies can play a significant role in trans-
mission [4]. The mite also infects more than a hundred species of mammals, creating an animal
welfare and economic burden in primary industry [5–7].
Scabies represents a major health problem in many remote Indigenous communities in Aus-
tralia and particularly affects children. Up to 25% of adults and 50% of children acquire scabies
infections each year, and 7 out of 10 children under 1 year contract scabies with first presenta-
tion peaking at 2 months of age [4, 8]. Scabies is associated with pyoderma (skin sores) in
Indigenous communities, but also in many other circumstances of disadvantage globally [9]. In
tropical regions, the major pathogens of pyoderma are Group A streptococcus (Streptococcus
pyogenes; GAS) and Staphylococcus aureus; with S. pyogenes considered the dominant and usu-
ally primary pathogen [4, 10, 11]. This is also the case for remote Indigenous communities in
northern and central Australia [4, 10–12]. Sequelae of infection with GAS include acute post-
streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which can be clustered (epidemic) or sporadic, and acute
rheumatic fever [4, 13, 14]. Rheumatic heart disease, characterised by heart valve damage,
occurs as a consequence of acute rheumatic fever and repeated episodes of it can result in
cumulative heart valve damage, with consequent heart failure and death [5, 13]. The prevalence
of rheumatic heart disease in Indigenous communities is amongst the highest in the world [4,
15]. Several recent studies provide molecular evidence of the scabies mite itself promoting
streptococcal growth in pyoderma through complement inhibitors [1, 16, 17]. Association of
scabies with these long-term health problems makes it an important factor to consider in
Indigenous health. Despite this, there is a relative paucity of genetic and genomic information
on scabies [1].
The scabies mite belongs to the subclass Acari (Arthropoda: Chelicerata: Arachnida: Acari),
which contains around 48,000 species of ticks and mites [18], and order Sarcoptiformes. Cur-
rently, the scabies mite is classified taxonomically as a single species with different varieties

 based on host specificity [19]. Reportedly, cross infectivity is rare and when it happens it is gener-
ally of temporary nature and self-limiting infestation [19, 20]. However, evidence regarding host
specificity is conflicting, with some studies suggesting cross infectivity is possible between certain
animal and human varieties [21, 22], while others suggest mono-specificity of scabies mite varie-
ties [4, 5, 23–26]. For example, genetic and phylogenetic studies that used hypervariable satellite
markers, 16S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit I of mitochondria (cox1), have shown that
human and dog mites are genetically distinct in north Australian sympatric populations and that
gene flow between the scabies mite population is extremely rare [19, 27]; while another study,
using the cox1 gene showed that dog mites from China, USA and Australia are genetically similar
to with certain human mites from Australia [21, 22]. Choice of the genetic marker may play a role
in conflicting outcomes. Additionally, it has been postulated that each variety, when infesting a
non-native host, can acquire morphological and innate characteristics suited to the host through
selection if it is allowed to persist due to immunodeficiency or malnutrition of the host [20].
Host specificity has been an area of ongoing investigation because potential cross infectivity,
in particular between domestic and companion animals and humans, would have important
implications for disease control programs. There are no morphological differences between
mites from different host species [20], but multiple failed experimental cross infestation
attempts indicated that physiological differences may exist [1, 27, 28]. Mites from dogs have
successfully established long term infestations in rabbits [28]. Microsatellite studies in wild ani-
mal mite populations also indicated a limited gene flow between mites from sympatric host
populations [29], but a further study suggested a prey to predator transfer of mites may be pos-
sible [30]. Taken together, available data suggests that a limited gene flow occurs between host-
associated populations of scabies mites, however a strict ‘host taxon’ law cannot be assumed.
Here, we describe the in silico isolation, de novo assembly and analysis of the mitochondrial
genome of scabies mites from a variety of complex metagenomic samples. The samples con-
sisted of thousands of whole mites collected from two clinical isolates from different regions of
Australia and replicates from a laboratory porcine model of scabies [31]. We assembled the
mitochondrial genome by applying a bespoke, iterative bait-and-assemble strategy to the mas-
sively parallel sequencing data from each mixture—demonstrating the utility of the general
approach on complex metagenomics mixtures. Additionally, we identified 6 mitochondrial
haplotype clusters in the human (Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis) and pig (Sarcoptes scabiei var.
suis) scabies/mange mite populations sampled. This allowed us to examine the genetic diversity
within and between isolates and suggests an extremely low level of diversity overall. To the best
of our knowledge, these findings provide the first view of the genetic diversity of individual sca-
bies infestations (intra-host diversity) based on whole mitochondrial genome sequences.
Methods
Collection and DNA extraction
The collection of human patient samples was approved by the Human Research Ethics Com-
mittee of the Northern Territory Department of Health and Menzies School of Health Research
(approval 13–2027) and informed consent was obtained in writing from each participant. Ani-
mal care and handling procedures used in this study followed the Animal Care and Protection
Act, in compliance with the Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for sci-
entific purposes, outlined by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council.
The study was approved by the QASP and the QIMR Berghofer MRI Animal Ethics Commit-
tees (DEEDIAEC SA2012/02/381, QIMR A0306-621M).
Skin scrapings were collected from two unrelated patients with severe crusted scabies
(patient A and patient B) from different regional areas of Northern Territory, Australia. The

 collections from individual patients were made 14 months apart and were likely independent.
On both occasions, scabies mites (S. scabiei var. hominis) were individually picked from the
skin. Each sample contained >1000 mites. Two samples of pig mites (S. scabiei var. suis) were
collected from an inbred population of mites from a pig model [31]. The samples were taken
from different pigs from consecutive cohorts (where infections are passed on to new piglets
from a previous group) at different time points. The first sample consisted of >1000 whole
adult mites (pig unwashed). The second sample also consisted of >1000 mites, but was split
into three subsamples, which were washed using different protocols to reduce the amount of
bacteria present on the surface of the mites due to the wound micro-environment (pig washed
1, 2 and 3 respectively). The protocol entailed: (1) 15 min wash at room temperature in 4%
paraformaldehyde in water [32]; (2) 1 hour incubation at 37°C in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM
EDTA, pH8.0, 0.6% SDS, and 0.125 ug/ul lysozyme [adapted from 33] and; (3) 1 hour incuba-
tion at 37°C in 1% bleach (Sodium hypochlorite) in water. Mites were subsequently rinsed
twice in water. Between wash steps mites were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 2 min.
Whole genome sequencing
Whole mites were crushed and DNA was extracted from each sample using a Blood and Cell
culture DNA Kit QIAGEN and a modified procedure, adapted from the manufacturer’s proto-
col. Washed mites were submerged in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM EDTA, 100 mM
NaCL, 1% TritonX-100, 500 mM Guanidine-HCl, 10 mM Tris pH7.9) and homogenized with
stainless steel beads of 2.8mm diameter at 6800rpm, 3 cycles, 30 sec per cycle, 30 sec between
cycles. The suspension of lysed mites was supplemented with DNase free RNase A to 0.2 mg/
ml and with Proteinase K to 0.8 mg/ml and incubated at 50°C for 1.5 h. After centrifugation at
4000g for 10 min to pellet insoluble debris the genomic DNA was isolated on the QIAGEN
genomic tip as instructed in the manufacturer’s protocol. Six DNA libraries were constructed
and 100 nucleotide (nt) long paired-end reads were generated on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.
Additionally, 54 S. scabiei var. suis eggs were collected from the pig model. To reduce any sur-
face bacteria, these were washed washed twice in 4% paraformaldyde and rinsed twice in water.
DNA was extracted separately from 51 individual eggs, and from 3 pools of 5 eggs and 1 pool
of 16 eggs. Sequencing libraries were constructed using the Nugen Ovation SP Ultralow DNA
kit for 3 single eggs, and pools of 5 and 16 eggs, and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500
with 2x100 nt reads. Raw data is available via ENA accession PRJEB12428.
Initial de novo assembly
Sequence read quality was assessed using FASTQC [34]. Adapter and quality (Q�20) trim-
ming was performed using TrimGalore! (v0.3.1) [35]. For the human and unwashed pig sam-
ples, reads were de novo assembled using Velvet (v1.2.08) [36]. To establish the best k-mer size,
we initially assembled all reads from patient B using k-mer values of k = 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71,
73, 75, 79, 85, 89 and 95. Based on the quality of these assemblies, we used k = 69, 75, 77, 79,
81, 83, 85, 89 and 95 for patient A and the unwashed pig samples.
Metagenomic profiling
Metagenomic profiling of the patient B mite assembly was carried out using PhymmBL (v4.0)
[37]. We augmented the bundled PhymmBL model database with interpolated Markov models
trained on the spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (strain London) (available at https://
bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/gdb/tetranychus/) [38] as a proxy for scabies mite. To estimate the
species abundance, reads were aligned back to contigs using Bowtie2 (v2.2.3) in local alignment
mode [39] and the number of reads aligning to each contig were counted.

 De novo assembly of the mitochondrial genome
For the two human samples and the unwashed pig sample, the mitochondrial genomes were
assembled individually using a bait-and-reassemble strategy (see Fig 1 for overview). First, con-
tigs from the whole genome assemblies were aligned to European house dust mite (EHDM),
Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus mitochondrial reference genome (NCBI GenBank:
EU884425) [40] using LASTZ (v1.02.00) [41] with default settings. For patient B, contigs from
the k = 65 assembly were used for alignment; for patient A, contigs from k = 77, 79 and 89 were
used; and for the unwashed pig sample, contigs from the k = 69 and 81 assemblies were used.
These different k-mer value assemblies varied in their N50 values, largest contigs sizes and
median read coverage. The aligned contigs were then filtered against the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) NT database for scabies mite mitochondrial contigs using
BLASTN (v2.2.29) [42] to remove likely false positives due to homology with other mitochon-
drial genomes (e.g. host mitochondrial genome). After the filtering step, contigs from patient B
k = 65 assembly gave the best coverage of EHDM mitochondrial reference genome. Adapter
and quality trimmed reads from the patient B sample were then aligned back to the filtered
patient B k = 65 contigs using Bowtie2 (v2.2.3) in local alignment mode. Aligned reads were
then used to de novo assemble the patient B scabies mite mitochondrial genome using Velvet

 (v1.2.08). Assemblies were run using k = 69, 79, 87, 89, 91 and 95. A k-mer size of 91 gave the
longest single contig and was selected as the reference mitochondrial genome of scabies mite.
To generate the mitochondrial reference for patient A, adapter and quality trimmed reads
from the patient A sample were aligned to the patient B mitochondrial reference genome, and
matching reads were de novo assembled using Velvet. The final contigs were scaffolded and
gaps filled with Ns. This scaffold was then used to realign the patient A reads and reassemble.
This process was run iteratively. The second iteration gave the minimal number of Ns in the
contig and this was retained as the patient A mite mitochondrial genome.
The same process was used for the unwashed pig sample, but in this case the first iteration
gave the best contig with minimal Ns.
Annotation
Mitochondrial protein-coding genes were predicted on patient B mitochondrial reference genome
using the MITOS pipeline (accessed online, August 2014) [43] using the invertebrate mitochondrial
genetic code (with default settings). To verify the annotations, open reading frames (ORFs) between
stop to stop codons were extracted from the assembled patient B mite genome using the GETORF
program from the EMBOSS package (v6.6.0) [44] using the invertebrate mitochondrial codon
table. The extracted 774 ORFs were then used to search the NCBI NR protein database using
BLASTP (v2.2.29) (E-value threshold = 0.1). For further verification, 13 protein-coding genes from
EHDM were aligned to the patient B mite reference genome using TBLASTN (v2.2.29).
12S and 16S ribosomal RNA were annotated using covariance models for those genes using
Infernal (v1.1rc4) [45, 46]. The covariance models were built from multiple sequence align-
ments of 12S and 16S rRNA genes from three sarcoptiformes, Steganacarus magnus (NCBI
RefSeq: NC_011574), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (NCBI GenBank: EU884425) and Der-
matophagoides farinae (NCBI RefSeq: NC_013184) using Clustal-omega (run on the web ver-
sion on 15/12/2013) [47]. MITFI (within the MITOS pipeline) was used to identify 21 of 22
standard mitochondrial tRNA genes.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms and diversity
For each of the six samples, reads from each sample were aligned to the patient B reference
genome using the Bowtie2 aligner in local mode. Pileups were generated using SAMtools
(v0.1.19-44428cd) [48] mpileup. Varscan (v2.3.6) [49] was then used to call SNPs with the
mpileup2snp command (Min Coverage: 300; Min Variant Frequency: 0.01; otherwise default
parameters). SNPs called within the 100 nt boundary at both ends of the genome (positions
1–100 and 13,820–13,919) were manually filtered out due to lack of reliability of alignments at
those low complexity regions. For each sample, SNP frequency was estimated using the ratio of
reads supporting the variant to total read depth at the SNP.
Results
Sequencing of the two human and four pig samples (unwashed and 3 washed technical repli-
cates) generated 46 (patient B) to 62 (pig washed 1) million read pairs per sample (S1 Table).
As expected, the libraries also contained host and microbial DNA. We estimated the level of
contamination using two approaches. PhymmBL was applied to the patient B mite mitochon-
drial assembly to classify contigs into taxa. This revealed that 44% of contigs were from bacteria
or other non-arachnid species (S1A Fig). Species abundance was estimated by re-aligning the
reads back to the contigs. This revealed that 6% of the reads were derived from contaminants
(S1B Fig).

 Using our bait-and-assemble strategy, we assembled the mitochondrial genome of each
sample (ENA accessions: LN874268-LN874270). The patient B mitochondrial genome assem-
bly comprised a single contig of length 13,919 nt. The patient A and unwashed pig assemblies
were 13,902 and 14,044 nt respectively. Both also consisted of single contigs, but each con-
tained a contiguous gap of 118 (patient A) to 255 (unwashed pig) Ns. We were unable to gener-
ate a circular mitochondrial genome sequence and found the contig ends were composed of
repeat rich sequences. Assuming the scabies mitochondrial genome is circular, we estimate
that an AT-rich gap of approximately 300 nt in length is present in the human mite reference
assembly. Similar gaps are also present in the other assemblies.
Similar to other sequenced Acari mitochondrial genomes, the scabies mite mitochondrial
genome is also highly AT-rich with a 19.32% GC-content. The strand bias is characterized by
GC and AT skews, calculated using (G%-C%)/(G%+C%) and (A%-T%)/(A%+T%) respec-
tively. The GC skew for the leading strand is -0.0327 and AT skew is 0.0341. Negative GC skew
and positive AT skew are similar to standard metazoan genome strand biases including Acari.
Reversal in GC skew in terms of strands has been observed in only two mites so far, Varroa
destructor [40, 50] and house dust mite [40].
Annotation
Thirty-five predicted genes were identified in the scabies mite (var. hominis) mitochondrial
genome (Fig 2). These include 13 protein coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and 20
tRNA genes. All of the expected mitochondrial genes for a typical metazoan mitochondrial
genome were identified, except for two tRNAs (Alanine and Tyrosine). Search with BLASTP of
extracted stop-to-stop ORFs from the mitochondrial genome also verified 12 of the 13 protein-
coding genes (except the ATP8 gene) and TBLASTN alignment of 13 protein coding genes
from the EHDM mitochondrial genome to the scabies mite mitochondrial genome also con-
firmed 12 of the 13 protein coding genes (except the ND4L gene) in the scabies mite mitochon-
drial genome. Two tRNA genes identified by tRNAscan-SE were considered ambiguous due to
their overlap with other genes (A is overlapping with C and Y is overlapping with NAD4L).
However, the overlap is not on the same strand.
The gene order and strand specification of the protein coding and ribosomal RNA genes are
the same as that of EHDM. All identified tRNA genes, except tRNA-C and tRNA-V also main-
tain the same gene order and strand as EHDM. The tRNA genes that are not syntenic with
EHDM (tRNA-C, tRNA-V) are also on the opposite strand to that of EHDM.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms and mitochondrial haplotypes
To identify genetic polymorphisms in the sequenced mite pools, reads were mapped back to
the reference Mt genome (patient B). The average depth of coverage was 2914 across samples
(average per sample ranging 1698–4299). A total of 665 single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) were identified across all samples relative to the reference Mt genome (patient B assem-
bly): 601 SNPs in the patient A sample, 598 SNPs in the patient B sample, and 102 SNPs in the
unwashed pig sample, while the washed pig samples (w1, w2, w3) contained 102, 100, 102
SNPs respectively (S2 Table). The four pig mite samples are effectively replicates (biological
and technical) and were highly concordant.
Within each sample, SNP allele frequencies, estimated from the ratio of reads supporting
the variant to the total coverage, were tightly grouped into a small number of clusters (Fig 3A),
suggestive of the presence of just a few mitochondrial haplotypes in each sample. To estimate
the number and frequencies of haplotypes, and to infer their sequences, we used k-means clus-
tering (S3 Table). SNPs common to all haplotypes within a sample have a frequency of 1.

 Additional haplotypes are defined by the presence of extra SNPs with mean frequency less than
1. We also examined reads supporting SNPs located close to each other (<100 nt) for evidence
that SNPs were on the same haplotype (supported by the same reads) or distinct haplotypes
(never co-occurring on one read). Only 4 pairs of SNP were located within 100 nucleotides of
each other and in two different frequency clusters. In each sample, we gave the haplotype with
the highest frequency the prefix H1. Haplotypes with successively lower frequencies are labeled
H2 and H3, in that order.

 In the patient B sample, a single clear cluster in the SNP frequencies was observed (Fig 3A).
This implies the presence of two haplotypes. The dominant haplotype, H1_B_REF, has an esti-
mated frequency of 0.98 and corresponds to the consensus obtained from de novo assembly.
The second haplotype (H2_B) is defined by the presence of 598 SNPs and has an estimated fre-
quency of 0.02.
The patient A sample contains a single clear cluster, containing 593 SNPs with a frequency
of 1.0. An additional 8 SNPs do not cluster well with the dominant group. These fall into four
other clusters identified by k-means. We chose to ignore the three smallest clusters, resulting in
just two closely-related haplotypes: H1_A, which has a frequency of 0.98, and H2_A, which
has a frequency of 0.02 and is separated from H1_A by just 4 SNPs. The lack of replication of
these SNPs makes the significance of these closely related haplotypes unclear.
All four pig samples contain three clear clusters, forming three haplotypes in each sample.
The haplotypes with the highest frequencies (H1_u, H1_w1, H1_w2, H1_w3) have estimated fre-
quencies of 0.89, 0.91, 0.89 and 0.90 respectively. Additional haplotypes are composed of combi-
nations of the clusters (S3 Table) and are concordant between samples. The second haplotypes
have estimated frequencies of 0.10, 0.07, 0.09 and 0.09 for the unwashed and three washed sam-
ples respectively and we label these H2_u, H2_w1, H2_w2, and H2_w3. The third haplotypes,
which we label H3_u, H3_w1, H3_w2 and H3_w3 for the unwashed and three washed samples
respectively, have estimated frequencies 0.02, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.01 respectively. The H1_u, H1_w1,
H1_w2, H1_w3 haplotypes have 82, 82, 81, 81 SNPs; H2_u, H2_w1, H2_w2, H2_w3 have 82, 82,
81, 81 SNPs and H3_u, H3_w1, H3_w2, H3_w3 have 87, 87, 85, 87 SNPs respectively.
Similar analyses of DNA sequencing data from a limited number of individual scabies mite
eggs or small pools did not identify clusters in the SNP allele frequencies (S2 Fig), suggesting
that multiple haplotypes provide evidence for genetic diversity rather than heteroplasmy.
To understand the relationship between the 16 inferred haplotypes, we constructed a phylo-
genetic tree based on the SNPs present in each haplotype sequence using MEGA5 (v5.2.2) [51]
with a distance measure based on the number of differences between haplotype sequences (S4
Table). The tree shows that the haplotypes fall into two broad clades and six haplogroups (Fig
3B). Three haplogroups are found in clinical isolates (human mite haplogroups 1–3), while the
pig mites comprise three haplogroups (pig mite haplogroups 1–3). The average difference
between haplotypes within each of the pig mite haplogroups is 1–2 SNPs. The two haplotypes
in human mite haplogroup 3 are almost identical and very similar to human mite haplogroup
2, forming one of the clades, while human mite haplogroup 1 is distinct from the other human
mite haplogroups, and more similar to the pig mite haplogroups, forming the second clade.
Discussion
We de novo assembled the mitochondrial genome of the scabies mite using massively parallel
sequencing data from thousands of pooled whole mites obtained from two clinical isolates
from different parts of northern Australia and from a laboratory pig model. Our approach was
to initially perform a full metagenomic de novo assembly. As expected, the samples were con-
taminated by bacterial reads presumably from the scabies mite gut and the scabies lesion
micro-environment. We then iteratively selected Mt contigs and used these as bait to recruit
and assemble genuine mite reads. Our bespoke de novo assembly approach has some similarity
to an existing bait-and-assembly method called MITObim [52]. MITObim first directly baits
the short reads using a closely related mitochondrial genome, then iteratively maps reads and
performs contig extension using MIRA. De novo assembly is also supported, but only for “well
behaved” data. In contrast, our approach performs full de novo assembly of the metagenomic
mixture, baiting of contigs using the house dust mite genome and filtering of host

 mitochondrial contigs, then 1–2 iterations of read alignment and de novo assembly using vel-
vet. Our results substantially extend the limited case studies and simulations used to validate
MITObim and demonstrate that the general approach of mitochondrial genome bait-and-
assembly works on real examples that are highly complex metagenomic mixtures involving
both genetic heterogeneity and host/bacterial contamination.
Mitochondrial genomes are generally circular, but rare occurrences of linear mitochondrial
genomes have been reported [53]. While we were unable to circularise the scabies mite mito-
chondrial genome assemblies, it seems unlikely that it is linear; a simpler explanation is that
the region contains highly repetitive AT-rich sequences (which we observe on the flanking
regions of the break) and these are difficult to map reads to and assemble across. The same
region in EHDM mitochondrial genome contains the origin of replication site. This might also
be a factor for the missing coverage in this region.
The gene content and organisation of the Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis mitochondrial
genome is the same as the recently published var. canis mitochondrial genome contig (NCBI
GenBank: CM003133 JXLN01000000) [54]. The gene order is also similar to the rabbit ear
mite, Psoroptes cuniculi, mitochondrial genome (NCBI Refseq: NC_024675) [55] with the
exception of the two additional tRNA genes found in the latter (Fig 4) and the house dust mite
(NCBI GenBank: EU884425), suggesting a close evolutionary relationship between these spe-
cies. These observations further support the hypothesized close evolutionary relationship
between the parasitic scabies mite and free-living house dust mite [56, 57]. However, it is dis-
tinct from most other Acari mitochondrial genomes sequenced to date [40], including Tetrany-
chus urticae (NCBI GenBank: EU345430). It is also quite distinct from Limulus polyphemus
(NCBI GenBank: NC_003057), which represents the arthropod ground pattern of gene
arrangement for chelicerates [58].
We found variations in the diversity of infestations between individuals (clonal or heteroge-
neous). Mites from skin scrapings from one patient with crusted scabies (patient A) appeared
to be essentially clonal. This lack of diversity suggests that either a single female mite may initi-
ate infection, or selection by the host immune system may operate. Mites from the second
patient (patient B), who had more severe crusted scabies than patient A, showed two highly
divergent haplotypes. Remarkably, one of the haplotypes in the patient B sample was much
more similar to the pig mite haplotypes than to the other human mite haplotypes. This may
reflect an actual cross-species infection, highlight the possibility of this, or could merely suggest
that the genetic differences between varieties are limited.
The population-level genetic diversity of scabies mites has been studied extensively using
single or small numbers of gene sequences. One recent study based on cox1 gene sequences
showed that scabies infestations of humans, dogs and other animals fall into 3 clades [21]. Two
clades contained only geographically isolated var. hominis mites, while the third contained
closely related human and animal mites. Another recent study, which used 3 gene sequences,
reported 5 clades—4 distinct var. hominis clades (one for each geographical region studied)
and one clade containing closely-related var. hominis and other animal scabies mite varieties
[21, 22]. These findings are consistent with our observation that one of the patient B mite hap-
lotypes was more similar to the pig mite haplotypes than to the other human mite haplotypes.
Since we used the entire mitochondrial genome, we expect our results to be robust. Moreover,
our intra-sample inference of haplotypes has revealed that patients and animals can harbour
multiple genetically divergent mites, or near clonal infestations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first view of intra-host genetic diversity for scabies mites.
One issue with our analysis of haplotypes is that we are unable to utilize a few unclustered and
unreplicated SNPs, in particular, from the patient B sample. These may define additional haplo-
types or represent genetic drift. Notwithstanding, these haplotypes would be extremely closely

 related. Our justification is that these are very small differences between haplotypes and may be
due to sequencing errors and thus erroneously detected variants, whereas large numbers of SNPs
with clustered frequency are more likely to be real. Regardless, our analysis provides a first look
at the genetic diversity of scabies infections within patients. However, further study with broader
population sample is required to refine the intra- and inter-host population diversity structure.
Conclusion
Scabies is responsible for significant morbidity in Indigenous Australians in many remote com-
munities of northern and central Australia. Effective control and prevention of scabies epidem-
ics in those communities is of paramount importance as scabies has a long-term effect on the
life expectancy and quality. We have sequenced, assembled and annotated the mitochondrial
genome of the scabies mite using a bespoke bait-and-assembly approach; we identified SNPs in
multiple isolates from patients and a laboratory pig model, and inferred the haplotype structure
and diversity of individual infections. We used these tools to investigate the genetic diversity
within individual infestations. Larger samples are now needed.
The development of genomics resources for studying the scabies mite will accelerate
research into this parasite, just as genome sequences have for other neglected parasitic diseases.

 For example, in malaria genomic resources provided means to identify drug resistance causing
mutations [59] or in schistosomiasis it helped suggesting new approaches to preventions and
strategies for control [60]. The scabies mite mitochondrial genome sequence will facilitate fur-
ther population genetics research in this area.

using the method described previously (except the minimum coverage threshold was set to 15
in this case due to lower coverage). The low frequency SNPs in the pooled egg samples (5 and
16) are all adjacent to homopolymer runs and consistent to be sequencing errors. The cluster
of SNPs with frequency 1.0 and absence of other clear clusters suggests that only a single haplo-
type is present in individual eggs and that genetic diversity, rather than heteroplasmy explains
the clusters in other samples.
