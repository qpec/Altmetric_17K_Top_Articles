Abstract
Objectives—Among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), female gender has been associated 
with an increased risk of stroke and a decreased likelihood of receiving oral anticoagulant therapy 
(OAT). The elderly are less likely to receive OAT due to concerns about falling and frailty. This 
study assessed the appropriateness of OAT among women and the elderly, looking for patterns of 
under-treatment or unnecessary treatment.
Design—Retrospective cohort study.
Setting—Primary care practices of an academic healthcare system.
Participants—1,585 adults with non-valvular AF seen between March 2013 and February 2014.
Intervention—Treatment recommendations were made by an Atrial Fibrillation Decision 
Support Tool (AFDST) based on projections for quality-adjusted life expectancy calculated by a 
decision analytic model that integrates patient-specific risk factors for stroke and hemorrhage.
Results—Treatment was discordant from AFDST-recommended treatment in 45% (326/725) of 
women and in 39% (338/860) of men (p = 0.02). While current treatment was discordant from 
recommended in 35% (89/258) of the elderly (age ≥ 85), and in 43% (575/1328) of patients < 85 
years of age (p = 0.01) a large proportion of under-treated elderly patients were receiving aspirin 
as the sole antithrombotic agent.
Conclusion—Physicians should understand that female gender is a significant risk factor for 
AF-related stroke and incorporate this into decision-making about thromboprophylaxis. By

INTRODUCTION
With the aging of the U.S. population, the number of individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) 
will increase substantially from over 2.2 million to more than 3 million by the year 2020.1 
The contribution of AF to the burden of stroke also increases with age. In the Framingham 
study, 23.5% of strokes in individuals ≥ 80 years of age were due to AF.2 It is also worth 
noting that due to the higher risk of AF-related stroke in the elderly, the impact of 
anticoagulation on the absolute risk reduction of stroke is greater in the elderly than in 
younger patients.
Surveys exploring barriers to optimal anticoagulation have identified numerous issues. Beyth 
and colleagues noted that physicians were less likely to prescribe warfarin for older 
patients.3 Others have shown that advanced age, female gender, and rural residency were 
associated with underuse of oral anticoagulant therapy.4 The therapeutic options for oral 
anticoagulant therapy (OAT) have evolved over time from vitamin K oral anticoagulants 
such as warfarin to a number of novel agents only recently approved for use in the United 
States by the FDA (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). The reasons for 
under-treatment of women are unclear, but likely relate to an incorrect perception that 
women are at lower risk of stroke.5 The pivotal physician-related factor seems to be an 
insufficiently balanced evaluation of the risk versus benefit of oral anticoagulant therapy. A 
recent systematic review comparing current treatment practices for stroke prevention in AF 
with a variety of published guidelines, including those of the American College of Chest 
Physicians (ACCP), and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/
Heart Rhythm Society (ACC/AHA/HRS), showed underuse of OAT in high risk patients in 
the majority of 54 studies reviewed.6 Among patients in 29 studies with a history of prior 
stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) who should all be receiving anticoagulant therapy, 
treatment levels averaged less than 60% (range 19% - 81.3%). Among high risk patients 
with a CHADS2 score ≥ 2 treatment levels averaged less than 70% (range 39% - 92.3%). 
While there has been a trend towards improvement in utilization of anticoagulant therapy 
over the past decade, a recently published study of community-based practices in the 
Christiana Care Health System in northern Delaware continued to show substantial 
underutilization with almost one-third of high risk patients (CHADS2 score ≥ 2) never 
receiving anticoagulant therapy despite the absence of identified barriers to such treatment.7 
In an analysis of predictors of warfarin use among the 1,141 patients studied there was a 
trend for men to be more likely to receive treatment than women. In an analysis of predictors 
of warfarin interruptions, there was a trend towards an increased risk in women.

 Middle-aged women have been found to be at significantly increased risk of death from AF.8 
The addition of female gender to AF-related stroke risk scoring systems such as the 
CHA2DS2VASc underscores the observation that female gender is a risk modifier for AF-
related stroke in the presence of additional stroke risk factors. That being said, the risk of 
stroke in women with AF is underappreciated by clinicians.9 Furthermore, studies have 
shown that populations of women at equivalent risk of stroke are less likely to receive 
anticoagulant therapy than men.10
There also is evidence that women, particularly older women, are less likely to receive OAT 
for AF.5, 11, 12 Fang and colleagues found that women not taking oral anticoagulants were at 
higher risk for stroke than men at both younger and older ages, with an adjusted relative risk 
of 1.6 (95% CI – 1.0 – 2.3) and 1.8 (95% CI – 1.4 – 2.3) respectively among patients ≤ 75 
years of age and > 75 years of age.13
Others have found that older patients are less likely to receive anticoagulant therapy.14 
Despite improvements over the past decade, still fewer than half of eligible elderly patients 
are receiving warfarin.15, 16 Surveys of physicians cite fall risk, dementia, and non-
adherence as factors in elderly patients that deter them from prescribing warfarin in this 
population of patients.17-19
With the recent approval and availability of 4 non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants 
(NOACs), concerns have been raised regarding the safety of these agents in the elderly. 
Reasons for such concerns include the high frequency of renal impairment, low body mass 
index in the frail and most-elderly, and altered body composition of muscle and fat.20 There 
have been a number of reports of increased bleeding risk among the elderly receiving 
treatment with dabigatran.21-23 While no randomized trials have specifically examined the 
efficacy and safety of the NOACs in the elderly, a meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials 
(RCTs) of more than 25,000 patients ≥75 years, the risk of major bleeding was not 
significantly different between the NOACs and conventional therapy, usually warfarin. In the 
4 trials involving patients with AF, NOACs were more effective than warfarin in the 
prevention of stroke in the elderly.24
This study is aimed at producing a better understanding of the appropriateness of 
antithrombotic therapy* for thromboprophylaxis among women and the elderly, looking for 
patterns of either under-treatment or unnecessary treatment. It also provides some insight 
into the process of generating patient-specific reports regarding current and optimal 
anticoagulation therapy in an academic healthcare system. Our hypothesis was that in our 
cohort of AF patients we would find that women and older patients are under-treated with 
OAT compared with the most recent recommendations of the AHA/ACC/HRS.25 We 
selected this guideline since it was both the most recent AF guideline released in the United 
States (March 2014), and it utilizes the more recently developed CHA2DS2VASc for 
determining AF-related stroke risk. We also hypothesized the same would be true even after 
accounting for AF-related stroke risk and bleeding risk on anticoagulant therapy, using an 
Atrial Fibrillation Decision Support Tool (AFDST) developed at our institution.
*Antithrombotic therapy – includes oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel).

 METHODS
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1,585 adults, ages 28-93, with non-valvular AF 
or flutter seen in ambulatory primary care practices of an academic healthcare system 
serving the Cincinnati tristate region. We used our health system’s clinical data store to 
identify 9,270 patients with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (427.31) or atrial flutter 
(427.32) who did not have diagnoses of mitral valve disease (394.x), aortic valve disease 
(395.x), heart valve transplant (V42.2) or heart valve replacement (V42.3). We abstracted 
one year of data at the beginning of March 2014 (March 1, 2013-February 28, 2014). During 
this one-year period of time, 4,021 AF patients were seen in any of the outpatient practices 
in our health system, and 1,585 were seen in the primary care network (PCN). The 
institutional review board at the University of Cincinnati approved this study.
Information needed to calculate stroke risk using CHA2DS2VASc26, major hemorrhage 
using HAS-BLED27, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)27, was extracted from the clinical 
data store using the active problem list and a combination of laboratory values and clinical 
measurements. Current antithrombotic therapy was retrieved from the active medication list. 
Data were stored on a secure server at our Center for Health Informatics as discrete elements 
hosted on MYSQL™. SAS data files were created as necessary for statistical analyses using 
unique coded patient identifiers. Further details are described separately.28
Treatment recommendations were made by an Atrial Fibrillation Decision Support Tool 
(AFDST) which we developed. The computational engine of the AFDST is a patient-specific 
decision analytic model comprised of a 29-state Markov simulation which projects quality-
adjusted life expectancy (QALE) for each of 3 strategies - 1) no antithrombotic therapy, 2) 
aspirin, and 3) oral anticoagulant therapy (warfarin in the base case) for each individual 
patient.29 The decision model uses information from the EHR to integrate patient-specific 
risk factors for stroke and hemorrhage in its calculations.28, 29 Decision model construction 
and analysis was done using a standard computer program (Decision Maker, Boston, 
Massachusetts). Further details of the patient-specific decision analytic model are described 
separately.28 While the decision analytic model used efficacy and bleeding risk data from 
warfarin for the oral anticoagulation strategy, the AFDST recommendation was for any oral 
anticoagulant if the warfarin strategy was better than either no antithrombotic therapy or 
aspirin. Thus, the AFDST was slightly conservative in its recommendations for OAT, given 
more recent data regarding the efficacy and bleeding risks associated with recently approved 
novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Finally, while recommendations of guidelines 
promulgated by the ACCP and the AHA/ACC/HRS are based solely upon stroke risk, the 
AFDST quantitatively incorporates both AF-related stroke and bleeding risk. SAS was used 
to perform simple descriptive statistical analyses and to develop multivariable regression 
models. All reported p-values are derived from models in which the provider is a random 
factor and denominator degrees of freedom are based on numbers of patients. The study 
alpha was a two-tailed p = .05, unadjusted for multiple tests.

 RESULTS
Characteristics for the 1,585 patients in the study are described in Table 1. Patients’ ages 
ranged between 28 years and 93 years, with a mean age of 70.5 years. Figure 1 shows the 
distribution of age across 5-year increments. Forty-six percent of patients were women. The 
mean CHA2DS2VASc and HAS-BLED scores were 3.7 and 2.1, respectively. Fifty percent 
of the cohort was receiving some form of OAT, most commonly warfarin (see Table 1). Only 
a small proportion of patients (11%) were receiving any of the non-vitamin K oral 
anticoagulants. There was a trend towards lower levels of OAT in women than in men but 
the difference was not statistically significant, 48% (347/726) and 52% (449/860) (p = 0.06), 
respectively.
The AFDST recommended OAT for 1,374 (87%) patients, aspirin for 65 (4%), and no 
antithrombotic therapy for 146 (9%) patients. Overall, antithrombotic therapy was 
concordant with AFDST recommendations in 58% of patients. Fifty-seven percent of 
patients for whom OAT or aspirin was recommended were receiving such treatment (788 
and 37, respectively), while 64% of those for whom no antithrombotic therapy was 
recommended (94) were receiving no antithrombotic therapy. Antithrombotic therapy was 
discordant from that recommended by the AFDST in 42% of patients. Thirty-seven percent 
of patients for whom the tool recommended OAT were receiving only aspirin or no 
antithrombotic therapy; 2% of patients for whom the tool recommended aspirin were 
receiving either no antithrombotic therapy or OAT; and 3% of patients for whom the tool 
recommend no antithrombotic therapy were receiving either aspirin or OAT.
As shown at the bottom of Table 2a, current treatment was discordant from recommended 
treatment in 45% (326/725) of women and in 39% (338/860) of men (p = 0.02). In addition, 
44% (321/725) of women were “under-treated,” receiving aspirin or no OAT when OAT was 
recommended, while only 31% (263/860) of men were “under-treated” (p < 0.0001). Thus, 
women were 1.8 times more likely to be under-treated than men. The most recent update of 
the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society 
(AHA/ACC/HRS) guideline for antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF recommends 
OAT for CHA2DS2VASc scores ≥2, no antithrombotic therapy for a CHA2DS2VASc of 0, 
and states that any therapy is reasonable for a CHA2DS2VASc of 125. However, women with 
a CHA2DS2VASc of 1 (i.e., whose only risk factor is female gender) are at very low risk for 
stroke and no antithrombotic treatment is an appropriate choice, as recommended in 
European guidelines.30 Comparing current treatment to the most recent AHA/ACC/HRS 
guideline-based therapy†, 51% (370/725) of women and 37% (317/860) of men had 
treatment that was discordant with the guideline (p < 0.0001), resulting in an even greater 
disparity between the sexes (see Table 2b).
In non-stratified analyses, there was no significant difference in the use of OAT in older and 
younger patients; 55% (141/258) of patients 85 years of age or older were receiving OAT 
compared with 49% (654/1328) of those < 85 years of age (p = 0.13). As shown at the 
†Although the AHA/ACC/HRS guideline makes no special mention of women with CHA2DS2VASc scores of 1, whose only risk 
factor is female gender, we have used the European Guideline recommendation suggesting no antithrombotic therapy for these patients 
due to very low stroke risk.

 bottom of Table 3, among the very elderly (age ≥ 85) current treatment was discordant from 
recommended treatment in 35% (89/258), while treatment was discordant among 43% 
(575/1328) of patients < 85 years of age (p < 0.01). Similar proportions of patients under 85 
years of age, 37% (497/1328) and ≥ 85 years of age,” 34% (87/258) were “under-treated (p 
= 0.30). Aspirin use was no different between patients ≥ 85 and < 85 years of age (36%).
We further examined age categories in 5-year increments and found that discordant therapy 
was as high as 60-70% in those between the ages of 31 and 50 (see Figure 2).
Table 2a describes in what manner treatment was discordant among women and men 
compared with therapy recommended by the AFDST. Among 326 women with discordant 
treatment 99% (322/326) was due to under-treatment and 1% (4/326) was due to over-
treatment (patients receiving either aspirin or OAT when no antithrombotic therapy was 
recommended, or OAT when only aspirin was recommended). Among 338 men with 
discordant treatment 81% (274/338) was due to under-treatment, while 19% (64/338) was 
due to over-treatment.
Table 3 describes in what manner treatment was discordant among patients <85 and ≥85 
years of age. Among 89 elderly patients with discordant treatment, 98% (87/89) of 
discordance was due to under-treatment and 2% (2/89) was due to over-treatment; whereas 
in those < 85 years of age, 88% (509/575) was due to under-treatment and 12% (66/575) 
was due to over-treatment.
We developed a multivariable logistic regression model to explore the impact of gender and 
age in order to investigate the hypothesis that female gender and advanced age were 
associated with an increased risk of discordant therapy. While the impact of female gender 
supported our initial hypothesis (Beta coefficient 0.36, p = 0.0007), we were surprised to 
find the opposite effect of increasing age (Beta coefficient −0.024, p < 0.0001).
DISCUSSION
In our study of 1,585 adults, similar proportions of women and men were receiving OAT. 
However, when looking at discordance between actual treatment and recommendations of 
either an Atrial Fibrillation Decision Support Tool or the most recent AHA/ACC/HRS 
guideline, women with AF continue to receive less aggressive treatment to prevent stroke.
The sad irony is that female gender is associated with an increased risk of AF-related stroke. 
Thus, for any given set of risk factors, a woman has a higher risk of AF-related stroke than a 
man. While previously published studies have come to varying conclusions with regards to 
the presence or absence of gender differences in antithrombotic therapy for patients with 
AF4, 5, 11-13, 31, 32,33, our study adds to the more contemporary evidence that gender 
differences in treatment are still occurring in some academic medical center settings, and we 
must remain vigilant in addressing them.
Numerous past studies have found advanced age to be a predictor of decreased use of oral 
anticoagulants.14, 31-36 This is an issue since a growing proportion of patients with AF are 
elderly. It is estimated that by the year 2050, 50% of the roughly 5.6 million people with AF

 will be over the age of 80 years.1 Clearly, physicians have concerns about frailty and fall 
risk, cognitive deficits that might interfere with medication adherence, polypharmacy, and an 
increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage among others in the elderly. However, given the 
generally increased risk of AF-related stroke in older patients, the absolute gain in decreased 
stroke risk afforded by OAT may be greater in the elderly. In our cohort, we found no 
significant difference in the use of OAT in patients older or younger than 85 years of age. 
However, this does address whether such treatment is appropriate or not. When we looked at 
treatment compared with the recommendations of the AFDST, which takes both stroke and 
bleeding risk into account, we found similar proportions of patients older or younger than 85 
years of age were under-treated. However, of some concern, a significant proportion of 
undertreated elderly patients were receiving aspirin as the sole antithrombotic agent. In 
interviews with physicians trying to understand why AFDST or guideline-appropriate 
therapy was not being given to these under-treated elderly patients, physicians cited 
concerns about bleeding risk. They felt that they “needed to do something” and that while 
aspirin is less effective than OAT, it has a lower associated bleeding risk. Recent data 
evaluating the efficacy of aspirin has shown a declining efficacy with increasing age, such 
that over the age of 77 years, aspirin has minimal if any impact on reducing AF-related 
stroke risk.37 Furthermore, bleeding risk associated with aspirin is often underappreciated. 
The net result of treating elderly patients with aspirin is that we expose them to a significant 
risk of major hemorrhage while providing virtual no benefit in terms of stroke prevention. In 
2007, the Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Treatment of the Aged Study (BAFTA) of 973 
patients aged 75 years or older, randomized to treatment with either warfarin or aspirin (75 
mg), found the relative risk of stroke among patients receiving warfarin was 0.46 (95% CI, 
0.26-0.79) compared with aspirin.38 Furthermore, rates of major hemorrhage, including 
intracranial and extracranial bleeds, were not different between the warfarin- and aspirin-
treated arms of the study. It has been proposed that the lack of difference in rates of major 
bleeding may have been due to selection bias in that over four-fifths of recruited patients 
were already taking either aspirin or warfarin. Thus, having already “survived” exposure to 
antithrombotic therapy, they may have been a population pre-selected to be at lower risk of 
major bleeding.39 Nonetheless, anticoagulation of elderly patients with AF is beneficial 
unless there are compelling contraindications or the patient decides that the benefits are not 
worth the risk and hassle.
Four NOACs have been recently approved for use in the United States for AF.40-43 While 
they all possess somewhat different profiles, in general they are equally if not more effective 
than warfarin, and generally have a lower risk of major hemorrhage, in particular, 
intracerebral hemorrhage, and do not require routine monitoring.44 Clinicians have 
questioned the generalizability of these results to a more elderly population. A recent meta-
analysis evaluated evidence from 10 randomized controlled trials focusing on an elderly 
population of patients ≥ 75 years of age.24 In the 4 trials of patients with AF, the NOACs 
were more effective than warfarin in preventing stroke in the elderly. In the full meta-
analysis of all 10 studies, NOACs did not cause excess bleeding in the elderly. Similar 
results were noted in a summary of subgroup analyses of elderly patients in the phase 3 
RCTs comparing warfarin with NOAC therapy.45 Perhaps the NOACs can fill the niche now 
occupied inappropriately by aspirin therapy for elderly patients with AF.

 Finally, contrary to our initial hypothesis, a larger proportion of patients under the age of 85 
were receiving treatment that was discordant from the recommendation of the decision 
support tool. This was due largely to over-treatment of younger patients between the ages of 
31 and 50.
CONCLUSIONS
We found that women in our cohort of AF patients receiving primary care in an integrated 
healthcare system of an academic medical center are regularly under-treated with 
antithrombotic therapy. Somewhat surprisingly, compared with older patients, a larger 
proportion of patients < 85 years of age are receiving treatment that is discordant from 
recommended therapy. Furthermore, in women and the elderly the major reason for 
discordant therapy is under-treatment; whereas in men and younger patients, a larger 
proportion of discordance is due to over-treatment.
What actions should these findings prompt? Physicians should understand that female 
gender is a significant and independent risk factor for AF-related stroke and factor this into 
their decision-making about thromboprophylaxis. While there are many reasons to be 
circumspect about treating older patients with OAT, we are under-treating these patients. 
Furthermore, in our efforts to avoid harm by treating older patients with aspirin instead of 
OAT we are actually exposing them to a significant risk of bleeding with little to no benefit 
relative to reduction of AF-related stroke risk. Finally, although they comprise a small 
proportion of patients with AF, we are over-treating young patients who are at minimal risk 
of AF-related stroke.

 Figure 2. Proportion of Patients with Discordant Care by Age Category
Five-year age categories are displayed on the x-axis, while the y-axis reports the proportion 
of patients in each age category who had treatment that was discordant from the 
recommendations of the Atrial Fibrillation Decision Support Tool (AFDST). Among 
patients between the ages of 31 and 50, the proportion with discordant care ranges between 
50% and 70.
