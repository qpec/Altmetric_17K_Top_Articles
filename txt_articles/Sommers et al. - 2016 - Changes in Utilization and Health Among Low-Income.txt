ABSTRACT 
Importance: Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), more than 30 states have expanded 
Medicaid, with some states choosing to expand private insurance instead (“private option”).  In 
addition, while coverage gains from the ACA’s Medicaid expansion are well-documented, 
impacts on utilization and health are unclear. 
 
Objective: To assess changes in access to care, utilization, and self-reported health among low-
income adults in three states taking alternative approaches to the ACA.   
 
Design: Differences-in-differences analysis of survey data from 2013-2015. 
 
Setting & Participants: U.S. citizens ages 19-64 with incomes below 138% of the Federal 
Poverty Level in Kentucky, Arkansas, and Texas (n=8,676). 
 
Exposure: Medicaid expansion in Kentucky and use of Medicaid funds to purchase private 
insurance for low-income adults in Arkansas (“private option”), compared to no expansion in 
Texas.   
 
Main Outcomes: Self-reported access to primary care, specialty care, and medications; 
affordability of care; outpatient, inpatient, and emergency utilization; receiving glucose and 
cholesterol testing, annual check-up, and care for chronic conditions; quality of care, depression 
score, and overall health. 
 
Results: Significant changes in coverage and access were more apparent in 2015 than in 2014.  
By 2015, expansion was associated with a 22.7 percentage-point reduction in the uninsured rate 
compared to non-expansion (p<0.001).  Expansion was associated with significantly increased 
access to primary care, improved affordability of medications, reduced out-of-pocket spending, 
reduced likelihood of emergency department visits, and increased outpatient visits.  Screening 
for diabetes, glucose testing among diabetics, and regular care for chronic conditions all 
increased significantly after expansion. Quality of care ratings improved significantly, as did the 
share of adults reporting excellent health.  Comparisons of Arkansas versus Kentucky showed 
increased private coverage in the former, increased Medicaid in the latter, and higher diabetic 
glucose testing rates in Kentucky, but no other statistically significant differences.   
 
Conclusions: In the second year of expansion, Kentucky’s Medicaid program and Arkansas’s 
private option were associated with significant increases in outpatient utilization, preventive 
care, and improved health care quality; reductions in emergency department use; and improved 
self-reported health.  Aside from the type of coverage obtained, outcomes were similar for nearly 
all other outcomes between the two states using alternative approaches to expansion.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has led to gains in coverage 
for millions of low-income adults in over 30 states.1-4  But in several states, policymakers continue 
to debate whether to expand Medicaid and are weighing alternative approaches such as using 
private insurance, increased cost-sharing, or work requirements for beneficiaries.5,6  In Arkansas 
and Kentucky, which expanded coverage in 2014, newly-elected governors have proposed 
substantial policy changes or even reversing their expansion.7-9  Meanwhile, Louisiana recently 
became the first state in the deep South to expand Medicaid.10 
 
Multiple studies have assessed the early impacts of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. 
National data show significant increases in insurance coverage in expansion states compared to 
non-expansion states, as well as improvements in access to primary care, specialty care, and 
prescription drugs.1,3,11-13 Beyond coverage and access, research to date has demonstrated limited 
impact of the Medicaid expansion on utilization, preventive care, and health.  However, coverage 
expansions can take several years to reach full enrollment,14 so there is a critical need for longer-
term studies. 
 
In this report, we assess changes in access, utilization, preventive care, and self-reported 
health among low-income adults after two full years of expansion in three Southern states that 
responded differently to the ACA’s optional Medicaid expansion: Texas did not expand.  Kentucky 
expanded Medicaid with almost 90% of beneficiaries in Medicaid managed care.15 Arkansas 
adopted the “private option,” which used federal Medicaid funding to purchase private health 
insurance from the ACA marketplace for low-income adults.16  These three states, each with 
different approaches, offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the ACA.  The public health 
implications of expansion are perhaps greatest in Southern states, which have some of the highest 
  
4 
poverty and uninsured rates in the country.  
A previous study in these states showed that after one year both Kentucky’s and Arkansas’ 
expansions produced improvements in affordability and access to care in 2014, but no significant 
changes in utilization or health.17  This report expands on that preliminary research using survey 
data from the end of 2015, documenting changes over a longer time period and offering timely 
evidence to inform the ongoing policy debate about the future of Medicaid. 
 
METHODS 
Study Design 
 
We surveyed low-income adults in November-December 2013, 2014, and 2015, to 
examine changes in health insurance, utilization, preventive care, and self-reported health.  Each 
year, we surveyed approximately 1000 different individuals in each state; no individual was 
surveyed in multiple years.  We then conducted a differences-in-differences analysis comparing 
changes before and after the ACA for the two expansion states (Arkansas and Kentucky) versus 
the non-expansion state (Texas), and tracked how outcomes changed between the first and 
second year of the expansions.  We then compared changes in outcomes between Kentucky and 
Arkansas to assess the two different approaches to expansion.   
 
 
Survey Instrument & Outcomes 
 
We administered a random-digit telephone survey, using landlines and cellphones, to 
U.S. citizens ages 19-64 with family incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL), the 
ACA’s Medicaid eligibility threshold.  The survey was available in English and Spanish.  Survey 
questions were primarily drawn from government surveys, the Oregon Health Insurance 
Experiment, and other national surveys.18-22  The overall response rate was 21% (ranging from 
  
5 
20-24% per year).  All results were weighted to demographic benchmarks from federal 
government survey data to produce estimates corresponding to the target population in each 
state; further methodological details (including state-specific response rates) are described in the 
Appendix eMethods and previous publications.17,23   
 
Our study outcomes were presence and type of health insurance; having a personal 
doctor; usual location of care; cost-related delays in obtaining care or prescription medications; 
difficulty making appointments for primary and specialty care; trouble paying medical bills; out-
of-pocket medical spending; outpatient, emergency department (ED), and inpatient utilization; 
receipt of cholesterol and glucose tests; regular care for chronic conditions; self-reported quality 
of care; self-reported health; and a validated two-item depression screen.24 
 
Statistical Analysis 
 
We used multivariable linear regression to analyze changes in outcomes from before 
expansion (2013) versus after expansion (2014 and, separately, 2015) in the study states.  We 
specified two different analyses.  The first compared the expansion states (Arkansas and 
Kentucky) versus the non-expansion state (Texas) to assess the overall impact of coverage 
expansion.  This model used a binary variable for Medicaid Expansion interacted with each of 
the two post-expansion years (2014 and 2015); modeling these years separately enabled us to 
identify the post-expansion trend by year for each outcome.   
In the second analysis, an additional interaction term between the private option and the 
2014 and 2015 expansion variables was added to this model, allowing us to compare Arkansas’ 
private option to Kentucky’s traditional Medicaid expansion.   
Each person was assigned a primary type of insurance coverage (see Appendix 
eMethods).  Medical out-of-pocket spending was converted from six discrete categories into a 
  
6 
linear variable, using the midpoint of each dollar-value category, then analyzed as the logarithm 
of spending.  We used linear models for all outcomes for ease of interpretation.25  Following our 
previous analysis, we used robust standard errors clustered at the county level, which generally 
produced more conservative confidence intervals in our models than state-based clustering, given 
the small number of state clusters.17  Models adjusted for sex, age, marital status, family size, 
race/ethnicity, education, income, urban vs. rural residence, annual county unemployment rate,26 
year, and state.  See Appendix for full regression equations; sample power calculations for the 
private option vs. Medicaid expansion; and results of sensitivity analyses using logistic or 
Poisson models, omitting observations with missing covariates, and pooling 2014-2015 data.   
We also separately examined two subgroups likely to experience greater barriers to care: 
racial/ethnic minorities and those in counties containing primary care health profession shortage 
areas (HPSAs) as designated by the U.S. government.27    
To assess the representativeness of our survey’s estimates, we compared our insurance 
measures for 2013-2014 to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) and 
several access measures to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), for adults meeting our inclusion criteria: U.S. citizens in 
the study states aged 19-64, with family incomes below 138% of FPL.  Despite some differences 
in sample definition between our survey and the government surveys, these analyses showed 
reasonable concordance (Appendix eTables 1 and 2): mean absolute differences in state-level 
estimates ranged from 2.8 to 7.3 percentage points for insurance with high correlation across 
states and years (rho=0.80 to 0.99), and mean absolute differences of 3.0 to 11.4 percentage 
points for access to care measures with moderate-to-high correlation across states and years 
(rho=0.55 to 0.82).  These differences are consistent with the magnitude of differences found in 
  
7 
previous research comparing estimates of coverage and access to care across different 
government surveys (see eMethods).22   
 
RESULTS 
Sample Characteristics  
 
Table 1 presents demographic and health characteristics by state (n=8,676).  The state 
samples did not significantly differ in terms of income, marital status, and gender.  Respondents 
in Texas were slightly younger, more urban, and disproportionately Latino compared to 
respondents in Arkansas and Kentucky.  The majority in all three states (64-95%) resided in 
counties containing primary care shortage areas.  55-70% of adults, depending on the state, 
reported at least one chronic condition, with depression and hypertension the most prevalent.   
 
Coverage Changes 
 
Figure 1 presents unadjusted patterns of insurance coverage by state for 2013 vs. 2015.  
Uninsured rates dropped dramatically in Arkansas (41.8% to 14.2%) and Kentucky (40.2% to 
8.6%), and more modestly in Texas (38.5% to 31.8%).  Coverage gains were largely from private 
insurance in Arkansas and from Medicaid in Kentucky. 
 
Comparing Expansion to Non-Expansion  
 
Table 2 presents differences-in-differences estimates of changes associated with 
Medicaid expansion (Appendix eTable 3 presents unadjusted state-by-state estimates).  The first 
set of results in Table 2 compares changes in expansion states versus non-expansion after the 
first year of expansion (2014 vs. 2013), and the second set shows changes after two years (2015 
vs. 2013).  Relative to Texas, Medicaid expansion was associated with a 14.0 greater percentage-
  
8 
point decrease in the uninsured rate in 2014 (p<0.001) and a 22.7 greater percentage-point 
decrease in 2015 (p<0.001), both compared to 2013.   
In terms of access and utilization, numerous outcomes that had not changed by 2014 
showed significant changes by 2015.  By 2015, Medicaid expansion was associated with a 
significant increase in the likelihood of having a personal doctor (+12.1 percentage points, 
p<0.001), and a decreased reliance on the ED as a usual location of care (-6.1 percentage points, 
p=0.003).  In 2015, expansion was associated with reductions in cost-related barriers to care (-
18.2 percentage points, p<0.001), skipping prescription medications (-11.6 percentage points, 
p<0.001), and difficulty with medical bills (-14.0 percentage points, p<0.001), as well as a 29.5% 
reduction in annual out-of-pocket medical spending from a baseline mean of $434 (p=0.02). 
 
There were also changes in utilization and health.  Medicaid expansion was associated 
with a significantly decreased likelihood of any ED visits (-6.0 percentage points, p=0.04), while 
the number of office visits increased by 0.69 per person (p=0.04).  Expansion was associated 
with increased likelihood of a checkup (+16.1 percentage points, p<0.001) and a glucose check 
(+6.3 percentage points, p=0.05) in the past year, and an increase in glucose monitoring among 
patients with diabetes (+10.7 percentage points, p=0.03).  Compared to Texas, the share of adults 
obtaining regular care for chronic conditions increased by 12.0 percentage points after expansion 
(p=0.008), the proportion of adults reporting fair or poor quality of care declined (-7.1 
percentage points, p=0.03), and the proportion reporting excellent health increased (+4.8 
percentage points, p=0.04).  Expansion was not associated with significant changes in depression 
rates (-6.9 percentage points, p=0.08). 
 
Comparing Traditional Medicaid to the Private Option 
 
Table 3 shows regression estimates comparing changes in 2015 versus 2013 for Arkansas 
  
9 
versus Kentucky.  Private coverage gains were greater in Arkansas than Kentucky (+21.7 
percentage points, p<0.001), while Medicaid gains were smaller in Arkansas than Kentucky (-
21.3 percentage points, p<0.001).  Changes in glucose monitoring rates for diabetics were lower 
in Arkansas than Kentucky (-11.6 percentage points, p=0.05).  None of the other 26 outcomes 
differed significantly between these two states. 
 
Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses 
 
Subgroup analyses (Appendix eTable 4) showed similar overall patterns but some 
differences from the full sample.  In counties containing primary care shortage areas, we found 
significant improvements in access to care, affordability, and quality of care after expansion, but 
no evidence of increased outpatient visits or decreased ED visits.  There was no significant 
change in self-reported health, though there was a significant reduction in depression scores. 
 
Minorities experienced significant increases in coverage, affordability, office visits, and 
check-ups after expansion, with lower ED visit rates, but also significantly increased trouble 
obtaining specialist appointments.  Compared to Kentucky, minorities in Arkansas experienced 
greater reductions in the ED as a usual source of care and larger improvements in self-reported 
health, but with significantly higher out-of-pocket costs.    
Sensitivity analyses showed similar results as our main models for most outcomes 
(Appendix eTable 5).  However, improvements in self-reported health were evident only for the 
share in “excellent health” but not other levels of health or in a logistic model.  In models that 
pooled the 2014-2015 data into a single post-expansion period or excluded observations with 
missing covariates, respondents in Arkansas reported higher out-of-pocket spending after 
expansion (estimates ranging from 21% to 24%) compared to Kentucky.

DISCUSSION 
As numerous states continue debating whether and how to expand coverage to low-
income adults under the ACA, our results provide important new evidence.  In this report on 
three Southern states with high baseline uninsured rates, the expansions took more than one year 
to mature, suggesting that preliminary studies likely underestimate the longer-term impacts of 
Medicaid expansion.13,28-31  This pattern may reflect both larger coverage increases over time and 
increasing familiarity with and utilization of coverage among the newly-insured.  By the end of 
2015, we found marked increases in coverage and reduced cost-related barriers to care in the 
expansion states, with associated increases in preventive care, outpatient office visits, annual 
check-ups, and chronic disease care, as well as decreased reliance on the Emergency Department 
(the subject of conflicting results in studies of prior coverage expansions).32-34   
Moreover, adults in expansion states reported significant improvements in self-reported 
quality of care and health.  Our findings of increased glucose screening rates in the general 
population and increased glucose monitoring among diabetics are consistent with the Oregon 
Health Insurance Experiment (though that study did not show any improvement in diabetic 
glucose control),35 as well as analyses of Kentucky Medicaid claims data36 and national 
laboratory data.37  Improvements in self-reported health in our study offer some of the earliest 
evidence that the ACA’s Medicaid expansion may be producing similar benefits detected in prior 
insurance expansions.19,38-40  While self-reported health has been shown to be a strong predictor 
of mortality,41 it remains to be seen whether the modest changes detected here will lead to 
subsequent improvements in objective measures of population health. 
Of note, we found improvements in receipt of check-ups, care for chronic conditions, and 
quality of care even in primary care shortage areas, suggesting that while clinician capacity is 
  
11 
undoubtedly an important consideration,42-44 insurance expansions can have a demonstrable 
positive impact even in areas with relative shortages, perhaps partially due to increased use of 
safety net providers.45   
Meanwhile, half a dozen states have received federal approval to expand under the ACA 
using alternative program features, including the private option.46  There is keen interest in 
assuring that federal flexibility does not jeopardize care for newly insured populations.  We 
found few significant differences between Arkansas’s private option and Kentucky’s traditional 
Medicaid expansion.  Other than the type of coverage obtained (primarily private insurance in 
Arkansas and Medicaid in Kentucky), the only significant difference was higher glucose 
monitoring rates among diabetics in Kentucky compared to Arkansas. All other outcomes related 
to utilization, quality of care, and self-reported health were similar for Kentucky and Arkansas.  
Of particular relevance to clinicians, we found no significant differences in access to primary and 
specialty care between private insurance and Medicaid expansions.  Overall, more than 85% of 
low-income adults in both expansion states reported no difficulties obtaining physician 
appointments in 2015.  Whether other state expansion models using different features than 
Arkansas’ program would produce similar results is unclear and worthy of future study.   
Subgroup analyses suggested that racial/ethnic minorities may be differentially affected 
by alternative expansion approaches.  For non-whites, the private option decreased reliance on 
the ED and improved self-reported health, but increased out-of-pocket spending compared to 
Medicaid.  The latter finding likely relates to Arkansas’ decision to impose more cost-sharing for 
higher-income private option beneficiaries than most states require in traditional Medicaid.47  
But overall, the two alternate expansions were associated with very similar changes for most 
outcomes. 
  
12 
Our study has several limitations.  First, we used a random-digit dialing (RDD) telephone 
survey, which produces response rates below those of federal government surveys.22  This may 
introduce non-response bias, though weighting for observable population features (as we have 
done) can mitigate this bias,48,49 and recent research demonstrates that RDD surveys “provide 
accurate data on most political, social and economic measures” compared to higher response-rate 
government surveys.50 With regard to health care in particular, other telephone surveys with 
lower response rates than ours have produced estimates of ACA-related changes quite similar to 
subsequently-released government data.1,51,52 A smaller concern is that our survey instrument 
used annual family income to define the study sample, and this is an imperfect measure for 
ACA-related eligibility, particularly in complex family arrangements or for those with 
fluctuating incomes.  Fortunately, our survey’s estimates of coverage and several measures of 
access to care in 2013-2014 were highly correlated with government estimates, offering support 
for our approach. 
Another limitation is that these states may not generalize to the U.S.  Arkansas and 
Kentucky have emerged as national leaders in the size of their coverage expansions;53 in states 
that have been less successful at increasing coverage, this may dampen the changes detected in 
this study.  More generally, Medicaid programs vary widely across states in terms of physician 
payment, covered benefits, and other features,54 which means that our results are in some sense a 
case study of two specific expansion efforts.  However, given Louisiana’s recent decision to 
expand Medicaid, Arkansas and Kentucky can offer valuable insights into the ACA’s potential 
impact there and in other Southern states with large uninsured populations. 
Finally, our study design precludes any clear causal interpretation.  While the use of a 
control group and multivariate adjustment rules out effects from secular trends and observable 
  
13 
confounders (such as the higher levels of urban and Latino residents in Texas, and county-level 
unemployment rates), unmeasured time-varying differences across the states including migration 
patterns or non-ACA health system changes may have biased our results.  However, the 
consistency of our findings with previous randomized and quasi-experimental studies of 
insurance expansions makes alternative explanations less likely.19,35,38,39  
Our study has several strengths.  Our sequential surveys allow us to assess the changing 
impact of the Medicaid expansion over time.  The survey’s rich set of outcomes adds important 
texture to our understanding of the ACA.  By including both a traditional expansion and private 
option, our study provides important information as states debate alternative approaches.  By 
targeting a sample of individuals most likely to gain coverage under the expansion – namely, 
poor adults in two states with the largest coverage gains under the ACA – we have greater 
statistical power to detect changes associated with this policy than many national analyses.  
Finally, by utilizing a telephone survey with a short turnaround time, we offer timely evidence to 
inform policy decisions being made in these states and others.  
In conclusion, we find that significant impacts of Medicaid expansion may take several 
years to unfold.  After two years of coverage expansion in Kentucky and Arkansas, compared to 
Texas’ non-expansion, there were major improvements in access to primary care and 
medications, affordability of care, utilization of preventive services, care for chronic conditions, 
and self-reported quality of care and health.  As Kentucky and Arkansas reconsider the future of 
their expansions, our study (along with evidence on the financial benefits to these states of 
expansion)55 provides support for staying the course.  For other states still considering whether to 
expand, our study suggests that coverage expansion under the ACA – whether via Medicaid or 
private coverage – can produce substantial benefits for low-income populations.

SUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIX: eMethods 
Survey Methods and Additional Details 
All estimates from our survey were weighted using the 2012 American Community 
Survey (ACS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for the following characteristics 
in each state’s population of low-income adult citizens: age, gender, education, race/ethnicity, 
marital status, geographic region, and population density (from ACS), and cell-phone versus 
land-line use (from NHIS).  Weights were adjusted for the number of household members and 
rates of dual cell phone and landline use among respondents, to account for the probability of 
inclusion in the sample.  In households with multiple respondents, the individual with the most 
recent birthday was chosen as the interview subject.  
 
For item non-response, we omitted from each regression any observation with a missing 
value for the outcome in question.  County of residence was missing for 3.8% of the sample 
(1.0% in Arkansas and Kentucky, 1.8% in Texas), and for these observations, we created an 
additional category of “missing county” within each state that we used for county-level 
clustering of standard errors.  For the unemployment rate covariate, when county of residence 
was not available, we used the statewide unemployment rate instead; our results are quite similar 
with or without adjustment for the unemployment rate.  For individual-level covariates, non-
response for race/ethnicity (0.6%) was treated as “other” and missing income (7.1%) was treated 
as its own category; note that all respondents in the sample reported incomes below 138% of 
FPL during the initial screening questions, but some did not provide any additional detail upon 
subsequent questioning – which is what we are calling the “missing income” group.  For 0.7% of 
the weighted sample with missing age, 0.4% with missing education, and 0.5% with missing 
marital status, we imputed these values based on multivariate regression models using 
  
25 
race/ethnicity, gender, income, family size, urban/rural location, cell phone usage, and political 
affiliation as predictor variables.  Our overall results were extremely similar if we omitted 
observations with imputed covariates (1.4% of the sample) from the analysis, as described in 
Appendix eTable 5. 
 
We then compared the demographics of each state sample from 2013 to 2015 to detect if 
there were any significant changes in our sample composition over time.  This analysis compared 
our survey-weighted demographic estimates for each state in 2013 vs. 2015.  There were no 
significant changes in gender, race/ethnicity, education, income, marital status, family size, rural 
vs. urban residence, living in a county designated a HPSA shortage area, and presence of any 
chronic conditions.  The only significant change in any state was a modest decline in the 
proportion of adults ages 55-64 in Kentucky from 27.4% in 2013 to 22.3% in 2015 (p=0.04).  
This suggests that the sample composition in these three states over time was fairly stable.  
Although our study already adjusts directly for these potential confounders in the regression 
analysis, this stability in observable features is reassuring and reduces the likelihood of important 
unmeasured confounders changing differentially in these three state samples over time. 
 
Classification of Insurance Outcomes 
 
Respondents were asked whether they had each of the following 6 coverage options 
(using state-specific names when appropriate): Medicaid, Medicare, military coverage, 
employer/union sponsored insurance, Marketplace coverage, or non-Marketplace private 
coverage purchased directly from an insurer.  For the 20.5% of respondents reporting more than 
one type of coverage, we assigned each person a primary form of insurance according to the 
following hierarchy: Medicaid, Medicare, employer-sponsored insurance, Marketplace coverage, 
  
26 
non-Marketplace direct purchase, and other.  Since the ACA prohibits a person from 
simultaneously having Medicaid and Marketplace coverage, we assigned people reporting both 
types of coverage (6.5% of the weighted sample) into one category or the other depending on 
state of residence.  For Arkansas and Texas, which did not expand Medicaid eligibility but did 
expand Marketplace coverage in 2014, those reporting both Marketplace and Medicaid were 
classified as having Marketplace insurance.  In Kentucky, since all individuals in our sample had 
incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level, such individuals were assigned Medicaid 
coverage.  If we do not use a state-specific decision rule for those reporting both Medicaid and 
Marketplace coverage, and instead simply use the same coverage hierarchy for all states, this still 
produces estimates of higher private coverage in 2015 in Arkansas than Kentucky (16.0 
percentage points, p<0.001) and lower Medicaid (-14.4 percentage points, p=0.001); these results 
are generally similar though smaller in magnitude than the estimates in Table 3.  Once a primary 
type of coverage had been determined for each respondent, we then created four mutually-
exclusive categories for analysis: uninsured, Medicaid, private insurance, and other.   
 
Survey Response Rate  
 
The survey’s overall response rate was 21%, using the American Association for Public 
Opinion Research (AAPOR) RR3 definition.  This definition requires an estimate of the 
percentage of all numbers dialed that meet the sample eligibility criteria.  This estimate was 
calculated based on 1) the share of dialed numbers that are working phone numbers, and 2) the 
share of working phone lines that have a household member meeting the study’s inclusion 
criteria.  The first parameter was based on the ratio of known working telephone numbers to total 
possible numbers in the landline (6%) and cellphone (29%) sampling strata.  The second 
  
27 
parameter was based on the overall percentage of all answered calls that identified an eligible 
household member (23% for landlines, 15% for cell phones).  This calculation and the 
underlying assumptions are consistent with AAPOR’s standard response rate definitions; for 
additional details, see: www.aapor.org/AAPOR_Main/media/publications/Standard-
Definitions2015_8theditionwithchanges_April2015_logo.pdf

Validation of Survey Estimates Against Government Data Sources 
 
Using our survey data for 2013-2014, we compared each state’s annual estimates for four 
outcomes – percent uninsured, change in uninsured, percent with Medicaid, and percent with 
private coverage (Appendix eTable 1) – and calculated the correlation coefficients between the 
estimates from our survey and the ACS.  The correlation coefficients were very high (rho=0.91 
for uninsured, 0.99 for change in uninsured, 0.95 for Medicaid, and 0.80 for private insurance), 
indicating similar patterns of insurance across data sources, with mean absolute differences in 
state-level estimates ranging from 2.8 to 6.2 percentage points depending on the coverage type 
(and 7.3 points for the uninsured estimate from the BRFSS). 
We then compared each state’s annual estimates for three measures of access to care in 
our survey to estimates from the BRFSS.  The BRFSS does not measure income precisely, 
  
28 
instead asking people to report income in increments ranging from $5000 to $25,000, so we 
imputed this as a percentage of the federal poverty level using the midpoint of each income band.  
In addition, the BRFSS does not ask about citizenship, meaning the comparison sample included 
both citizens and non-citizens, unlike our survey (which is limited to citizens).  These important 
sampling differences reduce the direct comparability of estimates between the BRFSS and our 
study survey, but nonetheless the results show moderate to strong correlation coefficients for the 
outcome pairings between the two surveys: for uninsured 0.88, for usual source of care 0.82, for 
cost-related delay in care 0.56, and for checkup in past year 0.55.  Mean absolute differences for 
these outcomes ranged from 3.0 to 11.4 percentage points. 
These differences across data sources are generally consistent with the magnitudes of 
differences across federal government surveys.  For instance, previous research (Skopec, Musco, 
and Sommers, 2014) showed that the mean difference in the uninsured rate in the BRFSS and 
ACS was 3.3 percentage points, similar to the mean absolute differences of 2.8 to 6.2 percentage 
points for our measures in Appendix eTable 1.   That study also found that the concordance for 
access-to-care measures across government surveys is lower than for coverage measures.  For 
instance, the National Health Interview Survey and Medical Expenditure Panel Survey produce 
mean estimates that differ by 8.6 percentage points for “cost-related delays in care,” which is 
similar to the mean absolute differences of 3.0 to 11.4 percentage points for our measures in 
Appendix eTable 2.   
We did not compare our results to 2015 federal survey data because those data are not yet 
available.

Regression Equations: 
 
Our pooled analysis of expansion vs. non-expansion is described by the following 
equation: 
Uninsuredist = β0 + β1 Xi + β2 Arkansass +β3 Kentuckys + β4 Year2014t + β5 Year2015t 
+ β6 Expansion States * Year2014t + β7 Expansion States * Year2015t + εist  
(1) 
where i indexed individuals, s state, and t year.  Xi was a vector of demographics (age, 
sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, family size, education, income, and urban vs. rural status). β2 
and β3 capture the direct effects of each state at baseline compared to Texas, and β4 and β5 adjust 
for the year.  β6 measures the difference-in-differences estimate for the change in outcome in the 
expansion states (Arkansas and Kentucky) in 2014, compared to the control group (Texas), and 
β7 provides the comparable estimate for 2015.  The error terms, εist, were assumed to be 
correlated between individuals within counties, which we addressed using robust sandwich-
based estimates for our standard errors. 
 
Our comparison between Arkansas and Kentucky used the following regression equation: 
Uninsuredist = β0 + β1 Xi + β2 Arkansass +β3 Kentuckys + β4 Year2014t + β5 Year2015t 
+ β6 Expansion States * Year2014t + β7 Expansion States * Year2015t  
+ β8 Arkansass * Year2014t + β9 Arkansass * Year2015t  + εist 
 
(2) 
where the terms were all defined as in Equation 1, but with the addition of the two 
interaction terms between Arkansas and the years 2014 and 2015.  Combined with the terms 
captured by β6 and β7, this means that β8 and β9 capture the difference in outcomes for each year 
between the two expansion states (i.e. Arkansas vs. Kentucky).   
 
Based on the results in Table 3, we assessed the likelihood that we would have detected 
clinically relevant differences between the private option and Medicaid expansions for selected 
  
30 
outcomes.  For the observed rates and sample sizes in Arkansas and Kentucky, we had 
approximately 80% power to detect a net change of at least 9.0 percentage points in “trouble 
obtaining a primary care appointment” or at least 6.4 percentage points in “excellent self-
reported health.”

Notes: Both analyses estimate coverage rates for the U.S. citizen population aged 19-64 with family incomes below 
138% of the federal poverty level.  N=65,006 for ACS 2013-2014 data, and N=5,665 for study survey 2013-2014 
data.  Our study survey data were collected in November-December of each year, while the Census Bureau’s ACS 
data are collected continuously throughout the year.  Thus, the estimates of coverage change in the former reflect 
11-12 months of expansion versus just 6 months (on average) in the ACS.  For this reason, the correlation 
coefficients are likely a better measure of the surveys’ comparability than raw differences in magnitude between the 
surveys.  The following are the correlation coefficients for year-coverage outcome pairings between the two 
surveys: for uninsured 0.91, for coverage change 0.99, for Medicaid 0.95, and for private insurance 0.80.

All estimates are from difference-in-difference models.  “Expansion vs. Non-Expansion” reports the 
changes for 2015 vs. 2013 in the two expansion states (Arkansas and Kentucky), compared to the non-expansion 
state (Texas).  “Private Option vs. Medicaid” reports the changes for 2015 vs. 2013 in Arkansas’ private option 
state, compared to the traditional Medicaid expansion in Kentucky.   Each subgroup was modeled separately.  All 
analyses adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, marital status, family size, education, income, urban vs. rural 
residence, county annual unemployment rate, state, and year.   
**p≤0.01, *p≤0.05 
PCP = Primary Care Profession  
a – All estimates are reported as percentage-point changes for binary outcomes, other than number of office 
and ED visits and out-of-pocket spending. 
b - Usual source of care was grouped into 3 categories – those reporting an office-based usual source of 
care, those without any usual source of care, and those using the ED as the usual source of care. 
c – Out-of-pocket spending estimates show relative change (%) using log-expenditures as the outcome. 
d – Sample limited to patients reporting heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or hypertension. 
e – Sample limited to patients reporting a history of diabetes. 
f – Sample limited to patients reporting at least one of the following conditions: hypertension, heart 
attack/coronary artery disease, stroke, asthma/COPD, kidney disease, diabetes, depression, cancer, and substance 
abuse.

**p≤0.01, *p≤0.05 
a – In the first two sets of columns, all estimates are reported as percentage-point changes for binary 
outcomes, other than number of office and ED visits and out-of-pocket spending.  For the third set (non-linear 
models), all results are reported as logistic odds ratios, except for the number of office and ED visits, which were 
Poisson-model coefficients. 
b - Usual source of care was grouped into 3 categories – those reporting an office-based usual source of 
care, those without any usual source of care, and those using the ED as the usual source of care. 
c – Out-of-pocket spending estimates show relative change (%) using log-expenditures as the outcome. 
d – Sample limited to patients reporting heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or hypertension. 
e – Sample limited to patients reporting a history of diabetes. 
f – Sample limited to patients reporting at least one of the following conditions: hypertension, heart
