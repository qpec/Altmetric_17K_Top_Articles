ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To investigate the association between alcohol 
consumption and cardiovascular disease at higher 
resolution by examining the initial lifetime 
presentation of 12 cardiac, cerebrovascular, 
abdominal, or peripheral vascular diseases among five 
categories of consumption.
Design
Population based cohort study of linked electronic 
health records covering primary care, hospital 
admissions, and mortality in 1997-2010 (median 
follow-up six years).
setting
CALIBER (ClinicAl research using LInked Bespoke 
studies and Electronic health Records).
PartiCiPants
1 937 360 adults (51% women), aged ≥30 who were free 
from cardiovascular disease at baseline.
Main OutCOMe Measures
12 common symptomatic manifestations of 
cardiovascular disease, including chronic stable 
angina, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, 
unheralded coronary heart disease death, heart 
failure, sudden coronary death/cardiac arrest, 
transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, 
intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage, 
peripheral arterial disease, and abdominal aortic 
aneurysm.
results
114 859 individuals received an incident cardiovascular 
diagnosis during follow-up. Non-drinking was 
associated with an increased risk of unstable angina 
(hazard ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 
1.45), myocardial infarction (1.32, 1.24 to1.41), 
unheralded coronary death (1.56, 1.38 to 1.76), heart 
failure (1.24, 1.11 to 1.38), ischaemic stroke (1.12, 1.01 to 
1.24), peripheral arterial disease (1.22, 1.13 to 1.32), 
and abdominal aortic aneurysm (1.32, 1.17 to 1.49) 
compared with moderate drinking (consumption 
within contemporaneous UK weekly/daily guidelines 
of 21/3 and 14/2 units for men and women, 
respectively). Heavy drinking (exceeding guidelines) 
conferred an increased risk of presenting with 
unheralded coronary death (1.21, 1.08 to 1.35), heart 
failure (1.22, 1.08 to 1.37), cardiac arrest (1.50, 1.26 to 
1.77), transient ischaemic attack (1.11, 1.02 to 1.37), 
ischaemic stroke (1.33, 1.09 to 1.63), intracerebral 
haemorrhage (1.37, 1.16 to 1.62), and peripheral arterial 
disease (1.35; 1.23 to 1.48), but a lower risk of 
myocardial infarction (0.88, 0.79 to 1.00) or stable 
angina (0.93, 0.86 to 1.00).
COnClusiOns
Heterogeneous associations exist between level of 
alcohol consumption and the initial presentation of 
cardiovascular diseases. This has implications for 
counselling patients, public health communication, 
and clinical research, suggesting a more nuanced 
approach to the role of alcohol in prevention of 
cardiovascular disease is necessary.

Introduction
The relation between alcohol consumption and cardio-
vascular disease is both complex and controversial.1 2 
 
There have been multiple systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses of the association between consumption 
and aggregated cardiovascular disease,1-7  as well as 
cardiovascular traits.1 8 9  Most have shown that, com-
pared with non-drinking, moderate levels of alcohol 
intake are associated with a lower risk of morbidity and 
mortality from cardiovascular disease, as well as more 
favourable cardiovascular health profiles in general. 
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Moderate alcohol consumption is thought to be associated with a lower risk of 
developing cardiovascular disease compared with abstinence or heavy drinking.
There are ongoing debates about the role of combining different types of current 
non-drinkers in producing this apparent protective effect. Specifically, former or 
occasional drinkers might have reduced or ceased drinking because of ill health, 
making the aggregated non-drinking group artificially seem to have a higher risk of 
cardiovascular disease and mortality
Less is known about the role of alcohol consumption in the aetiology of specific 
cardiovascular diseases; where studies exist they are often few in number, small in 
size, have combined different types of non-drinkers, and have not excluded all 
forms of cardiovascular disease before the primary event
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
This large scale study of 1.93 million adults without cardiovascular disease at 
baseline showed that moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk of initial 
presentation with several, but not all, cardiovascular diseases, even after 
separation of groups of non-drinkers
Though higher levels of alcohol intake are associated with a lower risk of initial 
presentation with myocardial infarction, this is offset by heavier drinkers having a 
greater risk of initially presenting with several other cardiovascular diseases as well 
as mortality from non-cardiovascular causes
Data on clinically recorded alcohol consumption can be validly used in research 
and practice

There is, however, a growing scepticism around this 
observation, with recent commentary pieces pointing 
out several methodological shortcomings in the evi-
dence on which the U shape is based.10-12  These include 
failure to have disaggregated the current non-drinking 
group into lifelong abstainers, former drinkers, and 
those who drink on an occasional basis. It is known that 
former drinkers (who might have quit for health rea-
sons) have an increased risk of mortality from cardio-
vascular disease13  compared with lifelong non-drinkers; 
therefore combination of these two groups is likely to 
lead to the overestimation of the protective effects of 
moderate drinking. Similarly, it has been shown that 
the onset of ill health is associated with a reduction in 
regular consumption to drinking on an occasional 
basis,14 therefore combination of these individuals with 
non-drinkers also introduces bias.
Evidence from short term alcohol feeding interven-
tions has shown that moderate drinking is related to 
higher concentrations of high density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol and adiponectin, as well as lower concentra-
tions of fibrinogen, but not other intermediate 
cardiovascular traits such as triglycerides.8  Given this, 
it could be hypothesised that moderate alcohol con-
sumption might be protective for some cardiovascular 
diseases but not others.15 Similarly, there are concerns 
about residual confounding in moderate drinkers, and 
exploration of heterogeneity in the association between 
alcohol intake and subtypes of cardiovascular disease 
with different aetiology could help to alleviate part of 
this (for example, finding moderate drinking is associ-
ated with a lower risk of one cardiovascular disease but 
not another).
In an era of precision medicine, more detailed dis-
ease phenotype models are required to improve risk 
prediction at an individual and population level as 
well as be able to offer tailored advice to patients,16 
 
and for this reason there have been calls for research 
into the association between alcohol consumption 
and deeper phenotypes of cardiovascular disease.17 
 
The evidence base for specific phenotypes, however, is 
sparse compared with that of aggregated outcomes. 
Table A in the appendix provides an overview of 
research from major investigator led prospective 
observational studies as well as meta-analyses of the 
topic of alcohol consumption and a selection of spe-
cific cardiovascular diseases. Most research has 
focused on acute myocardial infarction or stroke (total 
and broad categories of ischaemic or haemorrhagic), 
which currently represent about 40% of incident car-
diovascular events in the UK. Far less attention has 
been paid to other cardiovascular endpoints such as 
heart failure, cardiac arrest/sudden cardiac death, 
angina, peripheral arterial disease, subtypes of haem-
orrhagic stroke (intracerebral and subarachnoid hae-
morrhage), abdominal aortic aneurysm, and transient 
ischaemic attack, which collectively make up a sub-
stantial proportion of morbidity and healthcare 
expenditure in current clinical practice.18 19
Few studies, however, have been sufficiently pow-
ered to examine individual cardiovascular diseases, 
and fewer still are in a position whereby they are also 
able to disaggregate the group of current non-drinker 
into non-drinkers, former drinkers, and occasional 
drinkers. Linked electronic health record data can be 
re-used to create cohorts of sufficient size and of sat-
isfactory clinical resolution to be able to carry out 
such research.18 20  Studies using linked electronic 
health record data in the context of cardiovascular 
disease have shown heterogeneous associations 
between disease phenotypes and various exposures, 
including sex, blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and 
smoking.21-28
We used linked electronic health record data to create 
a contemporary cohort with a median of six years of fol-
low-up (11 637 926 person years) to investigate for the 
first time at large scale and within the same study 
whether the association with alcohol consumption dif-
fers across a wide range of incident cardiovascular dis-
eases that are recognised to have different biological 
mediators. In addition to increased endpoint resolu-
tion, we also separated non-drinkers from former and 
occasional drinkers to provide to additional clarity in 
this debate.
Methods
study design and participants
We included 1 937 360 anonymised patients from the 
CALIBER (CArdiovascular research using LInked 
Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records) pro-
gramme.29  Details of the enrolment, follow-up, and 
data sources are presented in the appendix. Briefly, 
the cohort used patient data from the Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink (CPRD), comprising anonymised 
patient records from general practices in England. 
Patients were included if they were aged ≥30 from 1 
January 1997 to 25 March 2010 and had no record indi-
cating any cardiovascular disease before study entry 
(fig 1 ). CPRD provides primary care data on health 
behaviours, diagnoses, investigations, procedures, 
and prescriptions; and its accuracy and completeness 
are regularly audited. CPRD patients are representa-
tive of the UK population in terms of age, sex, ethnic-
ity,30 31  and overall mortality32  and have been 
validated for epidemiological research.33  Patient 
CPRD data were further linked with three other data 
sources: the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit 
Project registry (MINAP)34 ; hospital episodes statis-
tics (HES); and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). 
MINAP is a national registry of patients admitted to 
hospital with acute coronary syndromes in England 
and Wales. HES provides information on all hospital 
admissions and ONS on cause specific mortality 
records for all deaths in England and Wales. Informa-
tion is coded with the hierarchical clinical coding 
schemes (Read codes,35  ICD-10 (international statisti-
cal classification of diseases, 10th revision), and 
Office of the Population Censuses and Surveys classi-
fication of interventions and  
procedures36). Our study 
protocol was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT01864031) before data were released to the lead 
author.

alcohol assessment
General practitioners or practice nurses prospectively 
collected and coded self reported alcohol consumption 
on the consultation date in CPRD. We used the most 
recent record of alcohol consumption in the five years 
before entry into the study to classify participants’ 
drinking behaviour. In light of current debates on the U 
or J shaped relation observed between consumption 
and aggregated cardiovascular disease outcomes we 
defined five categories of drinking: non-drinkers (Read 
codes such as “teetotaller” and “non-drinker”), former 
drinkers (those with codes for “stopped drinking alco-
hol” and/or “ex-drinker”), occasional drinkers (those 
with codes for “drinks rarely” and/or “drinks occasion-
ally”), current moderate drinkers (codes such as “alco-
hol intake within recommended sensible limits” and 
“light drinker”), and heavy drinkers (codes including 
“alcohol intake above recommended sensible drinking 
limits” and “hazardous alcohol use”). We also used 
data fields with information entered on daily and/or 
weekly amount of alcohol consumed to define partici-
pants as non-drinkers, moderate drinkers (drank within 
daily and/or weekly recommended sensible drinking 
limits for the UK at the time of observation37), and heavy 
drinkers (exceeded daily and/or weekly sensible drink-
ing limits). We reclassified non-drinkers as former 
drinkers if they had any record of drinking or a history 
of alcohol abuse in their entire clinical record entered 
on CPRD before study entry. Further details, including a 
diagram depicting our coding scheme (fig B) plus a full 
list of the exact Read codes used to define drinking cat-
egories (table B) as well as a series of proof of concept 
validation analyses of the association between these 
groups and cardiovascular traits (fig C), are available in 
the appendix.
study endpoints
Patients were followed up until the date of an initial 
presentation of one of our cardiovascular endpoints (or 
death from non-cardiovascular causes) or were cen-
sored on the date they left the practice or the date of last 
data submission from their practice. We defined 
 
multiple endpoints on the basis of the first recorded 
diagnosis of one of12 of the most common symptomatic 
manifestations of cardiovascular disease, including 
chronic stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial 
infarction, unheralded death from coronary heart 
 
disease, heart failure, cardiac arrest/sudden coronary 
death, transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, 
intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemor-
rhage, peripheral arterial disease, and abdominal aor-
tic aneurysm. We additionally estimated associations 
with non-cardiovascular disease mortality as well as 
coronary heart disease and stroke events that were not 
otherwise specified.
Secondary outcomes
For comparisons with existing studies we estimated 
models for aggregated coronary heart disease (myocar-
dial infarction and unheralded death from coronary 
heart disease), cardiovascular disease (all cardiovascu-
lar endpoints other than stable angina), fatal cardiovas-
cular disease (combination of fatal coronary heart 
disease and fatal cardiovascular disease), and all cause 
mortality. We also decomposed the myocardial infarc-
tion category into ST elevation, non-ST elevation, and 
myocardial infarction not otherwise specified. For fur-
ther details see table C in the appendix.
Covariates
Covariates considered in analyses included age (and 
age2), sex, area based socioeconomic deprivation 
(index of multiple deprivation38), smoking status, dia-
betes status, systolic blood pressure, body mass index 
(BMI), high density lipoprotein cholesterol, use of 
anti-hypertensive drugs or statins, and whether the 
patient had received dietary advice. Baseline covari-
ates were defined with the most recent measurement 
up to one year before study entry (except smoking, 
which was up to three years). Additional information 
on how covariates were derived can be found on the 
CALIBER portal (www.caliberresearch.org/portal) and 
elsewhere.21-24 26
statistical analysis
We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard models 
to calculate hazard ratios and associated 95% confi-
dence intervals for the association between categories 
of drinking and the initial presentation with specific 
cardiovascular disease phenotypes within a competing 
risk framework (that is, people could experience only 
one initial presentation). We plotted Schoenfeld residu-
als to ascertain that the proportional hazards assump-
tion had not been violated. In our primary analysis we 
adjusted for age, socioeconomic deprivation, and 
smoking status. The baseline hazard function of each 
model was stratified by general practice and sex. Miss-
ing data were handled with multiple imputation39 
under a missing at random assumption, and we carried 
out a series of sensitivity analyses adjusting for addi-
tional covariates, comparing imputed data (main anal-
ysis) to complete case data (n=1 104 838, with over a

smoking status), limiting analyses to different data 
sources, and using data only from 2004 onwards when 
recording of alcohol in primary care was incentivised. 
We also examined the association between alcohol cat-
egories and different cardiovascular diseases within 
subgroups defined by smoking status and BMI in a 
series of post hoc analyses suggested by reviewers. Fur-
ther information on all sensitivity analyses is available 
in the appendix. Assuming mutual independence 
between endpoints, we assessed heterogeneity in asso-
ciations across cardiovascular disease phenotypes 
within  
drinking categories using the I2 statistic. Our ref-
erence category in all models was moderate drinkers.40 
All analyses were conducted with Stata v14.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Results
Participant characteristics
Table 1 shows characteristics of the sample by category 
of drinking. Most study participants were non-smokers, 
had a BMI within the normal range, and were free from 
diabetes. All types of current non-drinkers were more 
likely to belong to the most deprived socioeconomic 
fifth. The distribution of 114 859 initial presentations 
across a broad range of cardiovascular disease 
 
endpoints within each drinking category is shown in fig 
D in the appendix.
Outcomes for common aggregated cardiovascular 
disease endpoints and all cause mortality
Figure 2 shows the association between categories of 
clinically recorded alcohol  
consumption and coronary 
heart disease, cardiovascular disease, fatal cardiovascu-
lar disease, and all cause mortality. We observed classic 
J shaped associations for cardiovascular disease (all and 
fatal) and all cause mortality, with non-drinkers, former 
drinkers, and heavy drinkers having an increased risk 
compared with moderate drinkers. For coronary heart 
disease, though we found that non-drinkers had an 
increased risk of experiencing an event (hazard ratio 
1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 1.36), we observed 
no difference in risk in heavy drinkers (0.97
, 0.90 to 1.06) 
compared with moderate drinkers.
Outcomes for specific phenotypes of cardiovascular 
disease
Figures 3 and 4 show findings from multivariable Cox 
models for cardiac and non-cardiac cardiovascular dis-
eases, respectively. Compared with moderate drinkers, 
non-drinkers had an increased risk of developing 
unstable angina (hazard ratio 1.33, 95% confidence 
interval 1.21 to 1.45) or experiencing a myocardial infarc-
tion (1.32, 1.24 to 1.41), unheralded coronary death (1.56, 
1.38 to 1.76), heart failure (1.24, 1.11 to 1.38), ischaemic 
stroke (1.12, 1.01 to 1.24), peripheral arterial disease 
(1.22, 1.13 to 1.32), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (1.32, 
1.17 to 1.49) as their initial presentation of cardiovascu-
lar disease.

Heavy drinkers had an increased risk of their initial 
presentation of cardiovascular disease being unher-
alded coronary death (hazard ratio 1.21, 95% confi-
dence interval 1.08 to 1.35), heart failure (1.22, 1.08 to 
1.37), cardiac arrest/sudden coronary death (1.50, 1.26

intracerebral haemorrhage (1.37, 1.16 to 1.62), and 
peripheral arterial disease (1.35, 1.23 to 1.48) (fig 4 ). 
Heavy drinkers, however, had a lower risk of experi-
encing a myocardial infarction (0.88, 0.79 to 1.00) and 
stable angina (0.93, 0.86 to 1.00) as their first cardio-
vascular disease (fig 3).
Former drinkers had an augmented risk of unstable

unheralded coronary death (1.40, 1.06 to 1.83), heart

presentation.
Occasional drinkers had an increased risk of myocar-
dial infarction (hazard ratio 1.14, 95% confidence inter-
val 1.05 to 1.23), unheralded coronary death (1.13, 0.99 
to 1.29), and heart failure (1.19, 1.11 to 1.27) (fig 3 ) and 
peripheral arterial disease (1.11, 1.01 to 1.21) (fig 4).
We present findings for non-cardiovascular disease 
death (as well as coronary heart disease and stroke, not 
otherwise specified) in fig F in the appendix. All other 
categories of drinking were associated with an 
increased risk of non-cardiovascular disease mortality 
compared with moderate drinkers.
We found no significant heterogeneity in the associa-
tion with alcohol consumption across subtypes of myo-
cardial infarction (fig F in appendix). There was, 
however, evidence of significant heterogeneity in the 
initial presentation of cardiovascular diseases within 
the categories of non-drinking and heavy drinking 
(table D in appendix).
effect modification by sex
We found some evidence that the association between 
alcohol consumption and heart failure and non-cardio-
vascular disease mortality differed by sex (see table E 
and figs I and J in the appendix). Specifically, among 
women we observed no increased risk between heavy 
drinking and heart failure and an attenuated, although 
still increased, risk in women who did not drink com-
pared with moderate drinkers.
sensitivity analyses
Findings of sensitivity analyses are in the appendix. 
Interpretation did not change substantially when we 
adjusted only for age and sex (fig G) or after additional 
adjustment for systolic blood pressure, BMI, and diabe-
tes mellitus (fig H). Similar associations were observed 
when we restricted analyses to endpoints determined 
with secondary care and mortality data sources (fig K), 
as well as fatal events only (fig L). There were no notable 
differences in the associations we observed when we 
used data only from 2004 onwards (fig M). Our findings 
when we used complete case methods were broadly 
concordant with those obtained using multiple imputa-
tion (fig N).
Post hoc analyses
Estimates from post hoc analyses within subgroups 
defined by smoking status (figs O and P) and BMI 
(figs Q, R, S) are also presented in the appendix. Our 
interpretation was not materially altered when we 
limited analyses to any specific subgroup. It is 
worth noting that as these analyses were restricted 
to observed data out of necessity, statistical power 
was noticeably reduced, and, while there were some 
differences between the point estimates in sub-
groups for certain endpoints (often rarer events), 
the confidence intervals often overlapped and 
included the point estimates (fig 3 ).41 Suggestive dif-
ferences included that the lower risk of myocardial 
infarction in heavy drinkers was attenuated in cur-
rent smokers (hazard ratio 0.95, 95% confidence 
interval 0.83 to 1.08) and those with a BMI in the 
normal range (1.00, 0.79 to 1.27). Non-drinking was 
not associated with an increased risk of cardiac 
arrest/sudden coronary death or abdominal aortic 
aneurysm in never smokers and those considered 
obese.

discussion
In this population based cohort study of a large scale 
contemporary clinical sample we found considerable 
heterogeneity in the association between recorded alco-
hol consumption and the initial presentation of 12 car-
diovascular diseases.
Our findings for aggregated endpoints are in line 
with those of previous observational studies,42 43 
showing that there is an increased risk of coronary 
heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and all cause 
mortality in the group of non-drinkers from whom for-
mer and occasional drinkers have been removed. At 
the same time, compared with moderate drinkers, 
heavy drinkers have an increased risk of experiencing 
all but coronary heart disease. This lends further sup-
port to the validity of using routinely collected clini-
cal data on alcohol consumption in research and risk 
prediction algorithms.
novel associations and improved resolution for 
association between alcohol consumption and 
specific cardiovascular diseases
Our finding that moderate alcohol consumption is asso-
ciated with a lower risk of initially presenting with a 
range of cardiovascular diseases is consistent with 
results of previous smaller studies (see table A). We 
extend this earlier work in clarifying that the protective 
effect observed for moderate drinking and major clini-
cal outcomes such as myocardial infarction,43  isch-
aemic stroke,44  sudden coronary death,45 46  heart 
failure,47  peripheral arterial disease,48  and abdominal 
aortic aneurysm49  is present even after separation of 
the group of current non-drinkers into more specific 
categories. Unlike others,50  we found no evidence of a 
protective effect of moderate drinking for subarachnoid 
haemorrhage, but we observed an increased risk of 
intracerebral haemorrhage among heavy drinkers, 
which is consistent with reports elsewhere.51 52  Other 
studies have also shown protective effects of alcohol 
consumption, even at heavy levels, for myocardial 
infarction.43 
53
In most outcomes for which we found a protective 
effect of moderate drinking, the risk of initially pre-
senting with that endpoint was higher in former drink-
ers, which is consistent with the “sick quitter” 
hypothesis, although we still observed excess risk 
among non-drinkers.10 13
To our knowledge, we have provided the first set of 
analyses examining the association between alcohol 
intake and subcategories of myocardial infarction, 
finding no heterogeneity across subtypes of ST eleva-
tion, non-ST elevation, and myocardial infarction not 
otherwise specified. This is also the first study to 
explore the association between not drinking and tran-
sient ischaemic attack.54  There was no difference in 
risk between non-drinking and occasional drinking 
groups compared with those with a moderate alcohol 
intake. Moderate drinking, however, was associated 
with a lower risk of initially presenting with stable 
angina in contrast with non-drinking .55 56  Further-
more, we report the first findings for alcohol consump-
tion and unheralded coronary death, an outcome of 
major importance to public health, showing that both 
non-drinkers and heavy drinkers were more likely than 
moderate drinkers to present with coronary death with 
no previous symptomatic presentations. We are also 
the first to show that heavy drinkers are more likely to 
initially present with peripheral arterial disease55  and 
fill in a current gap in the evidence base by showing no 
association between heavy drinking and the initial pre-
sentation of abdominal aortic aneurysm.49
sex differences in association between alcohol 
consumption and cardiovascular diseases
We observed few associations that differed in their mag-
nitude by sex, which is consistent with a recent 
meta-analysis for aggregated cardiovascular disease.57 
We extend this to multiple cardiovascular disease phe-
notypes (except heart failure, for which there was a sig-
nificant sex difference).

strengths: high resolution of exposure and 
endpoints in a contemporary clinical cohort
One of the primary strengths of our study is its large 
size, which allowed us to examine risk of multiple car-
diovascular diseases within the same sample, some of 
which are too rare to reliably investigate in smaller 
studies. Use of data from several electronic health 
record databases further improved the validity of our 
cardiovascular disease endpoints.33 Furthermore, we 
attempted to stratify the group of current non-drinkers 
into non-drinkers and former and occasional drinkers 
to clarify whether the observed protective effects of 
moderate drinking were present when these groups 
were separated from each other. Another strength of 
our use of a contemporary cohort is that our exposure 
variable reflects the drinking habits encountered by 
health workers in present day clinical practice, whereas 
the information used in consented cohort studies often 
echoes drinking behaviour prevalent 15-20 years or 
more ago. This strength also carries over to other 
behaviours and clinical practice.
limitations
Of course, our study is not without limitations. For 
example, our categories of drinking were based not 
only on self reported alcohol intake as reported by 
patients to their general practitioner or practice nurse 
but also our own judgement as how best to combine the 
recorded codes. Self reported measures of drinking 
have been criticised,58 and it is likely that a certain 
degree of misclassification bias is present in our drink-
ing categories—for example, some of the occasional 
drinkers were probably regular/moderate drinkers 
while some moderate drinkers were likely to be heavy 
drinkers. Therefore, the heavy drinkers in our study 
could represent the more extreme end of the drinking 
spectrum.
Furthermore, no standard questions about drinking 
were used by all health professionals during the study 
period, meaning that their own personal biases might 
have resulted in further misclassification59—for exam-
ple, whether they consume alcohol or not. Individuals 
might respond more honestly when recording their 
alcohol consumption on a paper questionnaire than 
directly to a medical professional (differential reporting 
by sex, fear of being judged, etc), but there was no way 
to quantify what proportion of data were collected by 
either method. It is important to bear in mind, however, 
that the information on alcohol consumption we used is 
intrinsically relevant to clinical practice as it was gath-
ered as part of routine care and is therefore the sort of 
information on which clinicians will base their subse-
quent advice and/or treatment of patients in day to day 
clinical practice. Additionally, it has been standard 
practice in every meta-analysis of alcohol consumption 
and aggregated cardiovascular disease (plus other dis-
eases) to date to combine data collected using different 
methods, and we do not consider our approach any 
more inherently biased than that. We also carried out a 
series of analyses linking the categories of drinking we 
used in this study to multiple cardiovascular traits, and 
they behaved as expected indicating acceptable validity 
of our approach.
We were unable to account for differences in risk by 
beverage type, though findings in this area are largely 
mixed,43 60 61  and it has been argued that beverage spe-
cific effects are more often a result of residual con-
founding by socioeconomic position62  than true 
effects. Furthermore, we were unable to account for the 
impact of drinking pattern4 43 63  or changes in drinking 
over time64-67  on different cardiovascular outcomes. 
Frequency of consumption is an important omission as 
it is known that most people do not spread their drink-
ing equally across the week and even isolated episodes 
of heavy drinking are enough to eliminate the protec-
tive effects observed for coronary heart disease in oth-
erwise moderate drinkers.4 63 We also did not explicitly 
seek to determine “thresholds” of drinking associated 
with the lowest risk of harm, instead we used existing

clinically recorded data on alcohol consumption to 
examine for the first time at large scale and within the 
same study the association between broadly defined 
categories of drinking (with an emphasis placed on 
separating different non-drinking groups) and the ini-
tial presentation of a range of pathologically diverse 
cardiovascular diseases. After we have shown that het-
erogeneous associations exist across cardiovascular 
endpoints, a logical next step forward would be to 
more thoroughly investigate the shape of the dose-re-
sponse association using continuous measures of alco-
hol consumption. Furthermore, our thorough 
examination of alcohol consumption recorded in elec-
tronic health records has additional clinical implica-
tions in having highlighted areas in which 
measurement of alcohol could be improved in clinical 
practice (such as drinking pattern).
While we examined a range of cardiovascular dis-
eases, we were unable to resolve some specific sub-
types—for example, thrombotic versus embolic 
ischaemic stroke. This means that an even greater 
degree of heterogeneity could be present across sub-
types of disease. While we tried to minimise measure-
ment error in the group of non-drinkers by using a 
patient’s entire clinical history to define them as for-
mer drinkers if they had any record of drinking, it is 
likely that this approach did not capture all former 
drinkers. As such it is possible that the increased risk of 
initially presenting with several cardiovascular dis-
eases in non-drinkers is partly caused by drinking cat-
egory contamination/existing comorbidities (for 
example, we found that non-drinkers were more likely 
to have diabetes or be obese). Finally, as with all obser-
vational studies, we were unable to exclude residual 
confounding—for example, we did not have informa-
tion on amount of tobacco smoked (as well as other 
smoking related traits such as age at initiation, pat-
tern/duration of smoking, and exposure to second-
hand smoke), dietary habits, or level of physical 
activity as these are lacking in the pre-existing elec-
tronic databases we used. By assessing the relatively 
negligible changes in the magnitude of the effect esti-
mates observed for alcohol and aggregated coronary 
heart disease,63  ischaemic stroke,68  and myocardial 
infarction,43 pre- and post-adjustment for dietary com-
ponents and physical activity in large studies to date, 
however, we are somewhat confident that even if we 
were able to adjust for these factors, our overall conclu-
sions would not materially change.
Clinical and public health implications
As noted previously, there is growing belief that the 
cardiovascular benefits of moderate drinking might 
have been overestimated,10  including in a recent large 
scale Mendelian randomisation study69  that found no 
protective effects of moderate alcohol intake for aggre-
gate cardiovascular disease (though there have been 
some critical commentaries of this study70 71). A sister 
paper from the Alcohol-ADH1B consortium, however, 
found evidence for non-linear associations between 
alcohol intake and some cardiovascular disease traits, 
including non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
BMI, waist circumference, and C reactive protein.72 We 
would expect these associations to then translate into 
greater heterogeneity of association with specific car-
diovascular disease endpoints as seen here, underly-
ing the importance of greater granularity in endpoint 
specification.
The main clinical implications stemming from our 
findings are concerned with primary prevention and 
personalised risk. For example, if a patient reports 
heavy drinking they can be informed that if they con-
tinue to do so they have an increased risk of initial pre-
sentation withischaemic stroke, heart failure, cardiac 
arrest, transient ischaemic attack, intracerebral haem-
orrhage, or peripheral arterial disease, as well coronary 
death with no previous symptoms. These findings could 
have further translational value in an era whereby risk 
prediction algorithms are being developed and/or 
improved for specific cardiovascular disease pheno-
types through having shown that the association with 
alcohol consumption is not common across diseases. 
Similarly, having shown that data on clinically recorded 
alcohol consumption can be validly used in research 
settings, in the future such information could be incor-
porated in disease specific risk prediction algorithms 
nested in clinical practice.
While we did find that heavy drinkers had a lower 
risk of presenting with a myocardial infarction, this 
needs to be considered within the context of our study, 
which was focused on initial presentation. This does 
not mean that heavy drinkers will not go on to experi-
ence a myocardial infarction in the future, just that they 
were less likely to present with this as their first diagno-
sis compared with moderate drinkers. Furthermore, 
heavy drinkers were more likely to initially present with 
death from causes other than non-cardiovascular dis-
ease, meaning it is possible that they are less likely to 
initially present with any cardiovascular disease 
because they die from other causes before they are able 
to develop a cardiovascular disease.
Similarly, while we found that moderate drinkers 
were less likely to initially present with several car-
diovascular diseases than non-drinkers, it could be 
argued that it would be unwise to encourage individ-
uals to take up drinking as a means of lowering their 
risk (although it must be noted that the findings from 
this study do not directly support this as we did not 
consider transitions from non-drinking to drinking). 
This is because there are arguably safer and more 
effective ways of reducing cardiovascular risk, such as 
increasing physical  
activity73 74  and smoking cessa-
tion,75  which do not incur increased risks of alcohol 
related harm such as alcohol dependence, liver dis-
ease, and cancer.76-78 It is also worth bearing in mind 
that our focus was on risk of initial presentation with 
one cardiovascular disease rather than another, not 
absolute risk of cardiovascular disease. Ultimately an 
individual’s decision to drink should not be consid-
ered in isolation from other health behaviours or risk 
factors and instead be motivated by their own per-
sonal circumstances.

Finally, from a public health perspective, our finding 
that moderate drinking is not universally associated 
with a lower risk of all cardiovascular conditions also 
supports the decision not to incorporate the apparent 
protective effects of drinking for cardiovascular disease 
in the recent UK chief medical officers’ alcohol guide-
lines review.76
Conclusions
Collectively, our findings, from the most comprehen-
sive study to date of the relation between alcohol con-
sumption and risk of cardiovascular disease, indicate 
that moderate alcohol consumption is associated 
with a lower risk of initially presenting with several, 
but not all, cardiovascular diseases. Similarly, we 
show that heavy drinking is differentially associated 
with a range of such diseases. This has implications 
for patient counselling, public health communica-
tion, and disease prediction algorithms and suggests 
the necessity for a more nuanced approach to the role 
of alcohol consumption in the prevention of cardio-
vascular disease.
