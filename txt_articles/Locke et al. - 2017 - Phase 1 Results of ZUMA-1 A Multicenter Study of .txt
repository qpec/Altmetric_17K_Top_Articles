Outcomes for patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lym-
phoma (DLBCL) are poor. In the multicenter ZUMA-1 phase
1 study, we evaluated KTE-C19, an autologous CD3z/CD28-
based chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, in
patients with refractory DLBCL. Patients received low-dose con-
ditioning chemotherapy with concurrent cyclophosphamide
(500 mg/m2) and fludarabine (30 mg/m2) for 3 days followed
by KTE-C19 at a target dose of 2 � 106 CAR T cells/kg. The inci-
dence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was the primary endpoint.
Seven patients were treated with KTE-C19 and one patient expe-
rienced a DLT of grade 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and
neurotoxicity. Grade R3 CRS and neurotoxicity were observed
in 14% (n = 1/7) and 57% (n = 4/7) of patients, respectively. All
other KTE-C19-related grade R3 events resolved within
1 month. The overall response rate was 71% (n = 5/7) and com-
plete response (CR) rate was 57% (n = 4/7). Three patients have
ongoing CR (all at 12+ months). CAR T cells demonstrated peak
expansion within 2 weeks and continued to be detectable at 12+
months in patients with ongoing CR. This regimen of KTE-C19
was safe for further study in phase 2 and induced durable remis-
sions in patients with refractory DLBCL.
INTRODUCTION
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype
of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the United States, accounting
for approximately 30%–40% of all cases of NHL.1–3 Studies exam-
ining outcomes in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL show
that the response rates to subsequent therapy varies from 14% to
63%.4–8 However, relapsed/refractory DLBCL is broadly defined
and consists of a heterogeneous patient population. Outcomes are
particularly poor in those patients with truly refractory DLBCL,
defined as no response to last line of chemotherapy or relapse within
1 year of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).6–9 A large patient-
level meta-analysis of patients with refractory DLBCL (Retrospective
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Research, SCHOLAR-1) found that out-
comes in this homogeneous population are significantly worse, with
a complete response (CR) rate of 8%, a partial response (PR) rate of
18%, and median overall survival (OS) of 6.6 months,10 indicating a
major unmet need for effective therapies for these patients.
Adoptive cell therapy with T cells genetically engineered to express
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting CD19 is a promising
approach for treatment of B cell malignancies. A recent single-insti-
tution study conducted at the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
demonstrated high response rates with an overall response rate of
73% and a CR rate of 55% with anti-CD19 CAR T cells containing
CD3z/CD28 signaling domains administered in conjunction with
low-dose cyclophosphamide conditioning regimen in patients with
relapsed/refractory B cell lymphomas.11 KTE-C19 is an autologous
CD3z/CD28-based anti-CD19 CAR T cell product that uses the
same CAR construct as in the NCI study but is manufactured in a
centralized, closed, and streamlined process of approximately
8 days. ZUMA-1 is the first multicenter study evaluating the safety
and efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in patients with refractory
NHL (NCT02348216). We report here the safety, efficacy, and correl-
ative studies of apheresis product, KTE-C19, and in vivo effects from
the phase 1 portion of ZUMA-1.

 events (AEs) due to disease progression, discontinued the study, and
never received KTE-C19 (one prior to leukapheresis and one prior to
conditioning chemotherapy). KTE-C19 manufacturing was success-
ful for all eight leukapheresed patients (Figure S1). Seven patients
received conditioning chemotherapy and KTE-C19. One additional
patient was added to have the pre-specified dose-limiting toxicity
(DLT) set of six patients treated at a target of 2 � 106 CAR+
T cells/kg (see Materials and Methods). Patients ranged from 29 to
69 years of age and had received two to four prior lines of therapy.
Three were refractory to second-line or later lines of therapy, and
four patients had relapsed post-ASCT within 1 year (Table 1). Two
of the four that relapsed post-ASCT received another regimen before
enrollment: patient 4 had stable disease after three cycles of
R-GEMOX and patient 6 had progressive disease after two cycles of
ipilimumab and lenalidomide therapy, meeting the definition
of refractoriness as defined in the protocol. Median absolute lympho-
cyte count at time of enrollment was 900 lymphocytes/mL (range,
100–1,400 lymphocytes/mL). Four patients were non-germinal center
B cell (GCB) subtype, and three were GCB as per the Hans
algorithm.12
Safety
All AEs occurring within 30 days of KTE-C19 infusion were graded
and reported for the seven (100%) treated patients, with maximum
grade 3, 4, and 5 events reported in three (43%), three (43%), and
one (14%) patient(s), respectively (Table 2). All patients experienced
KTE-C19-related AEs of any grade, with grade 3 and 4 events re-
ported in four (57%) and one (14%) patient(s), respectively. No
patient had a grade 5 KTE-C19-related event. B cell aplasia and hypo-
gammaglobulinemia was observed in patients 4, 5, and 6 (data not
shown).
One patient (14%) experienced a DLT. Patient 7 was a 29-year-old fe-
male with DLBCL with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status of 1 and refractory to three lines of com-
bination immuno-chemotherapy (Table 1). She experienced grade 3
hypotension, grade 3 metabolic acidosis, and grade 4 encephalopathy
on day 0 and required intubation on day 1; grade 3 acute systolic heart
failure on day 2; and grade 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
comprising grade 4 acute kidney injury on day 6. The grade 4 KTE-
C19-related events in patient 7 initially improved with tocilizumab,
corticosteroids, and supportive care including dialysis. However,
the patient’s condition subsequently worsened with grade 4 pseudo-
monal sepsis, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 4 neutropenia, and
subsequent grade 5 intracranial hemorrhage. Death was deemed un-
related to KTE-C19 per the investigator, and on the day of death, the
patient was on ongoing heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
prophylaxis in the setting of grade 4 thrombocytopenia and pseudo-
monas sepsis. Retrospective biomarker analysis revealed that immedi-
ately prior to initiation of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, the
patient had a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 655 mg/L (normal range,
0–10 mg/L), which was approximately 100-fold higher than the base-
line values of the other patients (median, 7 mg/L; range 4–34 mg/L),
indicating an elevated baseline inflammatory state. With the excep-
tion of the patient experiencing a DLT, all grade R3 KTE-C19-related
toxicities resolved within 1 month.

 Cytokine release syndrome was reported in six (86%) patients treated
with KTE-C19. Five (71%) patients experienced grade %2 CRS and
one (14%) patient experienced grade 4 CRS (occurring in the patient
with a DLT; Table 3). The most common CRS-related symptoms were
pyrexia (71%), hypotension (43%), and tachycardia (29%). All grade 3
and 4 CRS-related events, except for one grade 3 pyrexia and one
grade 3 hypoxia, occurred in the same patient experiencing the
DLT. Six of seven (86%) patients (patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7) received
tocilizumab and four of seven (57%; patients 1, 3, 4, and 7) received
corticosteroids for management of CRS and/or neurotoxicity symp-
toms as described by Lee et al.;13 four patients (patients 1, 3, 4,
and 7) received both tocilizumab and corticosteroids. All evaluable
patients experienced at least one neurotoxicity event of any grade
(Table 3), with three (43%) having maximum grade 3, and one
(14%) having a maximum grade 4 event (occurring in the patient
with the DLT). The median time to development of CRS and neuro-
toxicity were 1 day (range: 0–3 days; n = 6) and 4 days (1–4 days;
n = 6), respectively, with a median duration of 7 days (range:
3–17 days; n = 6) and 8 days (range: 2–20 days; n = 6), respectively.
Except for the patient who experienced a DLT, CRS and neurotoxicity
were found to be self-limiting and reversible. Four of the seven pa-
tients have died. With the exception of the patient who experienced
the DLT, all deaths were due to progressive disease. Based on the
safety profile of the six evaluable DLT patients in phase 1, this
regimen was deemed safe for study in phase 2.
Efficacy
Five of seven (71%) patients achieved an objective response within
1 month of KTE-C19 infusion, with four of seven (57%) achieving
a CR. Three patients are in ongoing CR at 12 months post-KTE-
C19 infusion. All three patients with ongoing CR had previously
relapsed within 5.8 months of ASCT (Table S1; Figure 1A). Of the
three patients with ongoing CR at 12 months, one received tocilizu-
mab, corticosteroids, and supportive care for the management of
both CRS and neurotoxicity, one received only tocilizumab and

 supportive care for the treatment of both CRS and neurotoxicity
during the first week post-treatment, and one received supportive
care only. Figure 1B shows a representative positron emission tomog-
raphy-computed tomography (PET-CT) with induction of CR
30 days after KTE-C19 infusion in patient 5. The response is ongoing
at 12+ months. Patient 5 was previously treated with R-CHOP and
R-ICE followed by ASCT conditioned with rituximab-gemcitabine-
busulfan-melphalan+azacitidine-vorinostat
and
relapsed
with
DLBCL in the terminal ileum, ileocolic, and retroperitoneal lymph
nodes 3.2 months after ASCT (Table 1).
Patient 2 achieved CR at 1 month after KTE-C19; however, progres-
sive disease was noted at 3-month restaging and was subsequently
proven as CD19+ relapse by biopsy. Per protocol, patient 2 was re-
treated with exactly the same low-dose conditioning chemotherapy
followed by the same target dose of KTE-C19. After the second infu-
sion, KTE-C19 expansion was detected and the patient achieved a PR
at 1 month. This patient progressed 3 months after the second infu-
sion of KTE-C19 and died at 9 months following the initial KTE-C19
infusion due to rapidly progressive bulky lymphoma (Figure 1A).
After the second KTE-C19 treatment, the patient developed myelo-
dysplastic syndrome (MDS) with a complex karyotype and nonsy-
nonymous DNMT3A and TP53 (double) mutations. Retrospective
analysis demonstrated that these mutations were present in periph-
eral blood prior to study enrollment, indicating a pre-existing smol-
dering MDS.
Immunophenotyping and Biomarker Analysis
Detailed phenotypic characterization of the patients’ apheresis ma-
terial, KTE-C19, and subsequent biomarker samples were conducted
as outlined in Materials and Methods. The initial apheresis material
(Table S2) and subsequent KTE-C19 product had similar intrapa-
tient CD4/CD8 ratios (data not shown). Unfractionated CD4 and
CD8 T cells were effectively transduced and showed ex vivo reac-
tivity against CD19+ target cells (Table 4). T cells within the apher-
esis product typically showed more differentiated phenotypes with
higher proportions of cells with effector memory (Tem [CCR7�,
CD45RA�]) and effector (Teff [CCR7�, CD45RA+]) phenotypic
profiles (Figure 2). The post-manufacture KTE-C19 CAR T cell
product showed a less differentiated phenotype (Figure 2) based
on CCR7 and CD45RA expression, with lower proportions of cells
with Tem and Teff phenotypes compared to apheresis T cells and
higher proportions of T cells with central memory (Tcm [CCR7+,
CD45RA�]) and naive (TN [CCR7+, CD45RA+]) phenotypes
(Figure S2).
Peak expansion of CAR T cells occurred within the first 7–14 days
post-infusion (Figure 3A) and were detectable at low levels by
qPCR analysis for up to 12 months in the peripheral blood of all three
patients with ongoing CRs. Expansion of KTE-C19 was mirrored by
sequential induction, elevation, and general clearance of a range of
homeostatic (IL-15), inflammatory and immune modulating cyto-
kines, chemokines (such as IP-10), and T cell effector proteins (Fig-
ures 3B, 3C, and S3). Some of these cytokines and markers, notably
IL-15 (median fold change from baseline, 9.9; range, 7.6–17.8),
were initially elevated by the cyclophosphamide and fludarabine con-
ditioning chemotherapy, paralleled by reduction of perforin and
endogenous lymphocyte numbers. No antibodies for the scFv portion
of KTE-C19 were detected in any of the patients during the course of
the study (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter study of anti-CD19
CAR T cell therapy in patients with NHL. Our results demonstrated
that (1) the conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide at 500 mg/m2
(days �5, �4, and �3) and fludarabine at 30 mg/m2 (days �5, �4,
and �3) followed by KTE-C19 (day 0) at a dose of 1–2 � 106 CAR
T cells/kg is safe for further study and the toxicity is manageable;
(2) a centralized, �8-day, closed manufacturing process of CAR
T cells is feasible for a multicenter trial; and (3) therapy with

 cryopreserved KTE-C19 product is associated with robust CAR T cell
expansion and durable clinical responses that are similar to those
observed with fresh anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in studies con-
ducted at single institutions.14 The results of this phase 1 study led
to the initiation of the pivotal ZUMA-1 phase 2 registration trial.
The conditioning chemotherapy regimen doses utilized in ZUMA-1
were selected based on the results of the NCI clinical trial demon-
strating that lower doses of chemotherapy afforded clinical efficacy
with an attenuated toxicity profile versus higher doses of conditioning
chemotherapy.15 Although the fludarabine dose was comparable, the
dose of cyclophosphamide utilized here is significantly lower than
that used in other trials of CAR T cell therapy.16–18 The lower doses
of the conditioning chemotherapy with KTE-C19 were also associated
with an acceptable toxicity profile. CRS and neurotoxicity were
the two primary categories of KTE-C19-related AEs. Grade R3
CRS and neurotoxicity were observed in 14% (n = 1/7) and 57%
(n = 4/7) of patients, respectively. One of seven patients (14%) expe-
rienced a DLT of grade 4 CRS and neurotoxicity, and none of the
patient deaths was attributed to KTE-C19.
Close examination of the patient who experienced a DLT was
revealing. The patient experienced cyclical fevers prior to cell infusion
on day 0 attributed to rapidly progressive bulky disease with B symp-
toms. Although blood cultures remained negative, the patient had
mucositis with underlying active HSV-1 that was being treated
through KTE-C19 infusion. Biomarker analysis of this patient re-
vealed a baseline CRP of 655 mg/L (normal range, 0–10 mg/L) in
conjunction with the elevation of other inflammatory markers
(IL-6, TNF-a). This timing and the nature of the cytokine profile
were in stark contrast to the other patients in this trial (Figures 3B
and 3C), indicating an extremely high level baseline inflammatory
state. Following this DLT, the protocol was amended for safety so
that patients having an active infection needing treatment or wors-
ening of their end organ function at the time of planned initiation
of conditioning chemotherapy would be ineligible to proceed with
conditioning chemotherapy or infusion of KTE-C19. Except for the
patient who experienced a DLT, all CRS and neurotoxicity AEs
were self-limiting, and resolved within 1 month at a similar incidence
with those observed on single institutional anti-CD19 CAR T cell
trials for B cell malignancies.19,20 Consistent with the “on-target,
off-tumor” effect of KTE-C19, B cell aplasia and hypogammaglobu-
linemia were observed in subjects with ongoing complete response
and persistent CAR T cells at 12 months post-infusion.
Despite the small numbers in this study, the overall and CR rates were
high and durable relative to historical controls. Durable efficacy of the
KTE-C19 regimen was observed in patients with rigorously defined
chemotherapy refractory disease who had no viable treatment
options. Rapid CRs were demonstrated after only 1 month of
follow-up in only those four (57%) patients who relapsed after prior
ASCT, and responses are ongoing at 12+ months in three of seven
(43%) patients. In these three patients, the duration of response
with KTE-C19 markedly exceeded the time to relapse after their prior
ASCT. This is remarkable, as the expected CR rate in this chemo-
therapy refractory patient population is 8%, and median OS is
6.6 months with conventional therapies.10 Notably, responses in
ZUMA-1 were observed without the use of any bridging chemo-
therapy: all patients proceeded directly from apheresis to condition-
ing chemotherapy and KTE-C19 infusion.
Comprehensive characterization of the apheresis product, KTE-C19,
and blood/serum samples post-infusion provided insights into the
possible mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity observed in these pa-
tients. The closed, approximately 8-day, centralized manufacture of
a cryopreserved product consistently yielded active CAR T cells in
all patients, across a broad range irrespective of lymphocyte counts
at time of enrollment (median, 900 lymphocytes/mL; range, 100–
1,400/mL). The product T cells showed a less differentiated phenotype
based on CCR7 and CD45RA expression, considered desirable for
adoptive T cell therapies (Figure S2) as naive and central memory
T cells have increased proliferative capacity.21–23 Adequate CD4+
and CD8+ CAR T cells in the final product were obtained without
pre-selection of T cell subsets.
The low-dose cyclophosphamide and fludarabine conditioning
chemotherapy alone was capable of enhancing several homeostatic
cytokines and chemokines, most notably IL-15, a critical T cell
proliferative cytokine.24 Conditioning chemotherapy followed by
KTE-C19 infusion resulted in a rapid and sequential induction,

 elevation, and general clearance of an array of cytokines, chemo-
kines, and immune effector proteins (Figure 3C). More specifically,
markers, including CRP, IL-6, TNF-a, IFN-g, and IL-15, increased
with peak values occurring 2–3 days post-infusion, and typically
resolved to baseline within the first 28 days (Figure S3). Levels of
Granzyme B, a key effector of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, peaked
later, 3–7 days post-infusion, providing evidence of when im-
mune-mediated tumor cell killing may occur. This sequence of
events paralleled CAR T cell expansion within 1–2 weeks after
T cell infusion (Figure 3).
The timing of the elevations and general clearance of these systemic
cytokines, chemokines, and immune effectors are similar in timing
to the onset and resolution of CRS and neurotoxicity. Although the
etiology of CRS is better understood, the pathophysiology of neuro-
toxicity that manifests as toxic encephalopathy remains unclear.
The neurotoxicity reported here has been observed across other
anti-CD19 CAR T cell studies and with blinatumomab, a bispecific
T cell engager to CD19.18,19,25–27 Given that there is no direct
evidence of CD19 expression in the CNS, two hypotheses that may
not be mutually exclusive arise as the cause of neurotoxicity: either
passive diffusion into the CNS of systemically generated cytokines;
or activated CAR T cells migrating through the blood-brain barrier
with subsequent local production of cytokines within the CNS.28,29
Regardless, the neurotoxicity is generally reversible resolving in a
similar temporal fashion to the abatement of peak CAR T cell and
cytokines levels.
The agents effectively used for management of CRS and neurotox-
icity, tocilizumab and/or systemic corticosteroids, did not appear to
ablate CAR T cell expansion nor alter the CAR T cell-related elevation
of cytokines, chemokines, and immune effector molecules. Impor-
tantly, durable responses were observed in patients who received
tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids for toxicity management as well
as those who did not. Overall, this analysis suggests the CAR T
infusion in concert with chemotherapy conditioning creates an envi-
ronment that promotes CAR T cell expansion, trafficking, anti-tumor
activity, and persistence for an interval of time sufficient to mediate
clinical activity.

In conclusion, the results of this phase 1 portion
of ZUMA-1, the first multicenter study of anti-
CD19 CAR T cell therapy in aggressive NHL,
demonstrated that the KTE-C19 regimen was
tolerable and safe for further study. It also vali-
dated that centralized manufacturing is feasible
and established the logistics for transportation
of patient-specific product door to door within approximately
2 weeks. More importantly, it showed that a single infusion of cryo-
preserved KTE-C19 cells could provide durable clinical responses
in refractory DLBCL patients including those whose disease has failed
to respond to ASCT. Together, these results fulfilled a prerequisite to
broaden clinical applicability of this patient-specific adoptive T cell
therapy and have led to the initiation of the pivotal multicenter phase
2 portion of ZUMA-1 for patients with refractory aggressive B cell
NHL with an unmet clinical need.

Figure 3. Kinetics of Peripheral Blood CAR T Cells and Serum Biomarkers
(A) PCR data demonstrates exponential expansion and persistence of CD19 CAR T cells in blood. Expansion occurs rapidly with peak levels achieved within the first
7–14 days post-KTE-C19 infusion (note: patient 7 was not tested). Persisting CD19 CAR T cells were detectable in six of six (100%) patients at week 4 and in four of five (80%)
patients with samples available for testing at month 3. Three patients with ongoing CR had detectable CAR T cells at 12 months. Limit of detection of the qPCR assay is
0.001% or 1 � 10�5. (B) Analysis of patient serum reveals a biomarker profile composed of specific cytokines, chemokines, and effector proteins associated with KTE-C19
treatment. The expansion of CD19 CAR T cells (Figure 3A) was mirrored by induction and elevation of a range of cytokines that regulate proliferation, activation, and effector
function. Induction of IL-15 occurs during conditioning chemotherapy and levels continue to rise post-infusion, promoting anti-CD19 CAR T cell expansion. CRP levels
parallel CRS and generally resolve within the first 28 days. Granzyme B levels peak 3–7 days post-infusion, during peak anti-CD19 CAR T cell expansion, and provide
evidence of effector function and tumor killing. (C) Heat map of serum biomarkers demonstrates sequential induction and gradual resolution within the first 2 weeks after
KTE-C19 infusion of key cytokines, chemokines, and effector proteins. Patients 1–6 demonstrated similar baseline levels and post-infusion kinetics for induction of IL-15

 echocardiogram. Key exclusion criteria included history of malignancy
otherthannon-melanomaskincarcinomainsitu,ASCTwithin6weeks
of informed consent, history of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplant, prior CD19-targeted therapy, and prior CAR T cell therapy
(except KTE-C19). All patients provided written, informed consent.
The Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee of
each study site approved the protocol. This study was conducted in
accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Phase 1 Study Design and Toxicity Evaluation
In the phase 1 portion of ZUMA-1, the primary endpoint was inci-
dence of DLTs. The study began with cohort A1. Progression to phase
2 would occur if the patient incidence of DLT was less than or equal to
one of six DLT-evaluable patients in cohort A1. Dose-limiting toxic-
ities were defined as KTE-C19-related events with onset within
30 days of infusion and included grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocy-
topenia lasting longer than 21 or 35 days, respectively; any KTE-C19-
related AE requiring intubation; all other grade 3 toxicities lasting
more than 3 days; and any grade 4 toxicities. Exceptions to this defi-
nition, not counting as DLT, included the following: aphasia/
dysphasia or confusion/cognitive disturbance resolving to grade %1
within 2 weeks and baseline within 4 weeks; grade 3 fever or myelo-
suppression; or grade 3 immediate hypersensitivity reaction within
2 hr reversible to grade %2 within 24 hr; and grade 3 or 4
hypogammaglobulinemia.
The investigators were responsible for monitoring and reporting of all
AEs through 3 months post-infusion. Adverse events were graded ac-
cording to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (CTCAE), version 4.03. For CRS, a revised grading system
created by Lee et al.13 was used. After 3 months, investigators moni-
tored and reported on a targeted subset of AEs, including neurological
and hematological AEs, infections, autoimmune disorders, and sec-
ondary malignancies for 24 months (or until disease progression,
whichever occurred first). Secondary endpoints included objective
response rate per revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lym-
phoma per Cheson et al.,30 duration of response, progression-free
survival, OS, incidence of AEs and clinically significant changes in
laboratory values, incidences of anti-KTE-C19 antibodies, and levels
of anti-CD19 CAR+ T cells and cytokines in blood and serum. Explor-
atory endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and duration
of second response among patients retreated with KTE-C19, and
biomarker development based on assessment of blood and tumor
cells and KTE-C19.
Study Procedures and Treatment
Patients were enrolled following screening and confirmation of
eligibility and underwent leukapheresis within 5 days of enrollment
to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to manufac-
ture KTE-C19. Approximately 5 to 10 � 109 mononuclear cells
from 12 to 15 L of apheresis material were shipped overnight to the
central cell processing facility and enriched for the T cell-containing
PBMC fraction. T cells were then stimulated to expand with anti-CD3
and IL-2 and transduced with a retroviral vector containing the CAR
gene construct.20 Following expansion, the final KTE-C19 product
was washed, cryopreserved, and tested for identity, potency, sterility,
and adventitious agents. After meeting acceptance criteria, the KTE-
C19 product was shipped back to the clinical sites using a validated
cryo-shipper within approximately 2 weeks.31
Before receiving CAR T cell infusion, per cohort A1 parameters,
patients received a non-myeloablative low-dose conditioning chemo-
therapy regimen of fludarabine at 30 mg/m2/day and cyclophospha-
mide at 500 mg/m2/day on day �5, day �4, and day �3. On day 0,
hospitalized patients received a single intravenous infusion of
KTE-C19 at a target dose of 2 � 106 CAR+ T cells/kg (minimum of
1 � 106 CAR+ T cells/kg) and remained hospitalized to recovery
through day 7 or until all KTE-C19-related non-hematological toxic-
ities returned to grade %1 or baseline.
Patients were followed in the post-treatment assessment period and
returned to the clinic at week 2, week 4 (±3 days), month 2
(±1 week), and month 3 (±1 week). All patients completing the
month 3 visit were followed in the long-term follow-up period for sur-
vival and disease status every 3 months (±2 weeks) through month 18,
every 6 months (±1 month) between months 24 and 60; beginning
with year 6 (month 72 ± 3 months), patients will return to the clinic
once annually for up to 15 years. Patients achieving a CR or PR could
have received a second course of conditioning chemotherapy and
KTE-C19 if their disease progressed (not due to CD19� malignant
cells) as part of an exploratory analysis. Each patient was allowed a
maximum of one retreatment course.
Biomarker Analysis
Multiparametric flow cytometry was performed from apheresis
through manufacturing, and final product, with in vivo characteriza-
tion until end of study. Biomarker analyses were performed on blood
and tumor samples to evaluate predictive and pharmacodynamic
markers for KTE-C19. The presence, expansion, and persistence of
transduced anti-CD19 CAR+ T cells in the blood were monitored
by PCR. Levels of 44 serum cytokines, chemokines, circulating angio-
genic factors, immune effector molecules, and markers of macro-
phage activating syndrome (MAS) were also assessed. Archived
tumor tissue was collected for central pathology review.
Measurement of Serum Cytokines
Patient serum was harvested at the following time points: day �5
(prior to conditioning), day 0 (prior to KTE-C19 administration),
(T cell proliferation), CRP (marker of inflammation), granzyme B (evidence of effector function), and IP-10 (chemokine that promotes CAR T cell homing). Early induction of
IL-15, CRP, and IP-10 was observed 1–3 days post-infusion and effector function occurred around days 3–7 for these patients. In contrast, patient 7 demonstrated a
dysregulated profile relative to the other six patients both at baseline (IL-15, CRP, and IP-10) and after KTE-C19 administration (all markers), indicative of an inflammatory state
prior to KTE-C19.

 every other day during hospitalization, day 14 and day 28. Serum sam-
ples were processed locally using standard serum separator tubes (BD
Biosciences). Serum samples were held at �80�C for subsequent anal-
ysis by Luminex (EMD Millipore) or Meso Scale Discovery (MSD).
Prior to processing, serum samples were briefly thawed on ice and ali-
quoted into 96-well U-bottom plates (BD Biosciences). Samples were
analyzed using the following MSD kits: MSD V-PLEX Plus Angiogen-
esis Panel 1 (Human) Kit (bFGF, Flt-1/VEGFR-1, PlGF, Tie-2,
VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D), MSD V-PLEX Plus Chemokine Panel 1
(Human) Kit (Eotaxin, Eotaxin-3, IL-8 [HA], IP-10, MCP-1, MCP-4,
MDC, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, TARC), MSD V-PLEX Plus Cytokine Panel 1
(Human) Kit (GM-CSF, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17A, IL-1a,
IL-5, IL-7, TNF-b), MSD V-PLEX Plus Proinflammatory Panel 1 (Hu-
man) Kit (IFN-g, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8,
TNF-a), MSD V-PLEX Plus Vascular Injury Panel 2 (Human) Kit
(CRP, ICAM-1, SAA, VCAM-1), and Luminex HCD8MAG-15K-04
(Granzyme A, Granzyme B, sFASL, and Perforin). All assays were car-
ried out according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Quality and
assay standard controls were included for independent runs per the
manufacturer’s protocol.
All MSD assays were read using a MESO QuickPlex SQ 120 and anal-
ysis was performed using DISCOVERY WORKBENCH 4.0 (MSD).
Luminex assays were read using a Luminex 200 system, and analysis
was performed using Bio-Plex Data Pro software (Bio-Rad). Analyte
values were reported as picograms per milliliter of serum.
Flow Cytometry Analysis of Product, Apheresis Material, and
CAR T Cells after Co-culture with Target Cells
As part of standard release criteria, KTE-C19 products were evaluated
by flow cytometry for anti-CD19 CAR surface expression, percentage
of CD4 and CD8 T cells, and also memory phenotypes (Naive, Tcm,
Tem,, and Teff as defined by CCR7 and CD45RA). Testing was per-
formed by Progenitor Cell Therapy, using validated protocols.
Cryopreserved apheresis samples were rapidly thawed in a 37�C water
bath, washed twice with calcium-free/magnesium-free PBS (VWR
Scientific) by gentle centrifugation, and resuspended in FACS Stain
Buffer (BD Biosciences). Sample viability and cell density were
measured using a Vi-cell as described. Cell densities were adjusted
to 1.0 � 106 viable cells/mL in FACS stain buffer. Cells were aliquoted
into 5-mL FACS tubes (BD Biosciences) at a final density of 1.0 � 106
viable cells/test. Cells were stained for 30 min on wet ice with the
following commercially available fluorochrome-conjugated anti-
bodies from BioLegend, CD3 fluorescein isothiocyante (FITC),
CCR7 Brilliant Violet 650 (BV650), CD45RA allophycocyanin
(APC), and CD4 Alexa Fluor 700 (AF700).
Cells from co-cultures of CAR T cells and target cell lines CD19-K562
or NGFR-K562 were pooled for analysis by flow cytometry. Sample
viability and cell density were measured using a Vi-cell as previously
described. Cell densities were adjusted to 1.0 � 106 viable cells/mL.
Cells were aliquoted into 5-mL polystyrene FACS tubes (BD Biosci-
ences) at a density of 1.0 � 106 viable cells. Staining was performed
for 30 min on wet ice with the following commercially available fluo-
rochrome-conjugated antibodies: (1) from BD Biosciences, PD1 phy-
coerytherin cyanine 7 (PE-Cy7) and CD57 Brilliant Violet 421
(BV421); (2) from BioLegend, CD3 (FITC), CCR7 (BV650),
CD45RA (APC), CD4 (AF700), CD69 (BV510), CD137 (BV421),
and CD107a (AF700); (3) from the Surgery Branch of the NCI,
anti-CD19 CAR PE. All antibodies used in this study were titrated
before use.
Prior to flow-cytometric analysis, samples were stained with propi-
dium iodide (BD Biosciences) to exclude dead and apoptotic cells.
Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCanto II (BD Biosci-
ences). For phenotypic markers, data were reported as percent
positive (% pos) relative to the appropriate fluorescence minus
one (FMO) control. For activation markers, data were reported
relative to the CAR T cell products not subjected to co-culture.
The analysis employed a cell-gating strategy that selected viable
CD3+ and anti-CD19 scFV+ cells and excluded dead/apoptotic
cells. A notable exception to the gating strategy in co-cultured
CAR T cell products was a shifting of the gating strategy to viable
CD3+ cells (and not anti-CD19 scFV+ cells) due to downregulation
of surface CAR on T cells following engagement of the target anti-
gen. Where feasible, data from a minimum of 1 � 104 viable cells
were acquired. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software,
version 10 (FLOWJO) using standardized gating and compensation
strategies.
Measurement of Anti-CD19 CAR T Cell Presence, Expansion,
and Persistence
A qPCR assay, previously described,14,15,32 was optimized and vali-
dated by the University of Rochester Medical Center Central Lab
Services (URMC CLS) for monitoring of anti-CD19 CAR T cell
expansion and persistence. Sensitivity of the optimized method is
0.001% or 1 � 10�5. Testing was performed by URMC CLS using
cryopreserved PBMC at baseline, prior to conditioning chemotherapy
and KTE-C19 administration, at days 7, 14, and 28, and months 3, 6,
9, and 12.
Measurement of Anti-KTE-C19 Antibodies
Presence of anti-KTE-C19 antibodies were monitored by Intertek
Laboratories using a qualified bridge ELISA designed to specifically
detect anti-FMC63 antibodies in patient serum. Testing was per-
formed at baseline, prior to conditioning chemotherapy and KTE-
C19 administration, and at months 1 and 3.
