IMPORTANCE With rising rates of marijuana use in the general population and an increasing
number of states legalizing recreational marijuana use and authorizing medical marijuana
programs, there are renewed clinical and policy concerns regarding the mental health effects
of cannabis use.
OBJECTIVE To examine prospective associations between cannabis use and risk of mental
health and substance use disorders in the general adult population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A nationally representative sample of US adults aged 18
years or older was interviewed 3 years apart in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol
and Related Conditions (wave 1, 2001-2002; wave 2, 2004-2005). The primary analyses
were limited to 34 653 respondents who were interviewed in both waves. Data analysis was
conducted from March 15 to November 30, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We used multiple regression and propensity score
matching to estimate the strength of independent associations between cannabis use at
wave 1 and incident and prevalent psychiatric disorders at wave 2. Psychiatric disorders were
measured with a structured interview (Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities
Interview Schedule–DSM-IV). In both analyses, the same set of wave 1 confounders was used,
including sociodemographic characteristics, family history of substance use disorder,
disturbed family environment, childhood parental loss, low self-esteem, social deviance,
education, recent trauma, past and present psychiatric disorders, and respondent’
s history of
divorce.
RESULTS In the multiple regression analysis of 34 653 respondents (14 564 male [47.9%
weighted]; mean [SD] age, 45.1 [17.3] years), cannabis use in wave 1 (2001-2002), which was
reported by 1279 respondents, was significantly associated with substance use disorders in
wave 2 (2004-2005) (any substance use disorder: odds ratio [OR], 6.2; 95% CI, 4.1-9.4; any
alcohol use disorder: OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.9-3.8; any cannabis use disorder: OR, 9.5; 95% CI,
6.4-14.1; any other drug use disorder: OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.6-4.4; and nicotine dependence: OR,
1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4), but not any mood disorder (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.4) or anxiety disorder
(OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7-1.1). The same general pattern of results was observed in the multiple
regression analyses of wave 2 prevalent psychiatric disorders and in the propensity
score–matched analysis of incident and prevalent psychiatric disorders.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Within the general population, cannabis use is associated
with an increased risk for several substance use disorders. Physicians and policy makers
should take these associations of cannabis use under careful consideration.

Although the cross-sectional association between canna-

previous national study has prospectively examined the asso-
ciation between cannabis use and the prevalence and inci-
denceofothermood,anxiety,andsubstanceusedisorders.Na-
tional estimates of the increased incidence of major mental
disorders attributable to cannabis use would critically inform
clinical practice and public policy.
To help fill this gap in knowledge, we prospectively ex-
amined the associations of cannabis use with the prevalence
and incidence of mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders
in a large, nationally representative, longitudinal survey. With
the use of propensity score–matched27 groups of cannabis us-
ers and nonusers, we further examined whether these asso-
ciations were dose dependent and whether they were robust
to control for numerous confounders.16,17
Methods
Sample
TwowavesoftheNationalEpidemiologicSurveyonAlcoholand
Related Conditions (NESARC) were the source of data (wave 1,
2001-2002; wave 2, 2004-2005). Wave 1 targeted the civilian
noninstitutionalized population 18 years or older residing in
households and group quarters. Black and Hispanic individu-
alsandyoungadults(aged18-24years)wereoversampled,with
data adjusted for oversampling and household- and person-
level nonresponse. Wave 1 interviews were conducted with
43 093 participants by experienced lay interviewers with ex-
tensive training and supervision. The background sociodemo-
graphic characteristics28 and rates of cannabis use disorders29
of the NESARC sample have been presented elsewhere.
Allproceduresreceivedfullhumansubjectsreviewandap-
proval from the US Census Bureau and US Office of Manage-
ment and Budget. Participants provided written informed con-
sent. The wave 2 interview was conducted approximately 3
years after wave 1 (mean interval, 36.6 months). After exclud-
ing respondents ineligible for the wave 2 interview (eg, de-
ceased), the weighted response rate was 81.5% (n = 34 653).
Sample weights were developed to additionally adjust for non-
response in wave 2, as well as demographic factors and psy-
chiatric diagnoses, to ensure that the wave 2 sample approxi-
mated the target population, that is, the original sample minus
attrition between the 2 waves.
Measures
Sociodemographic Characteristics and Cannabis Use
Sociodemographic measures included age, sex, race/ethnicity,
and educational level. Cannabis use was assessed by asking re-
spondents whether they had used cannabis in the 12 months
preceding the interview. In some analyses, the following 3 lev-
elsofcannabisusewereconsidered:nocannabisuseinthepast
12 months; some cannabis use in the past 12 months, but less
than 1 use per month; and 1 or more uses per month.
Psychiatric Diagnoses
AlldiagnosesweremadeaccordingtoDSM-IVcriteriausingthe
Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview
Schedule (AUDADIS-IV), waves 1 and 2 versions.30,31 Axis I di-
agnosesincludedsubstanceusedisorders([SUDs];alcoholabuse
and dependence, cannabis use and dependence, other drug
abuse and dependence, and nicotine dependence), mood dis-
orders (major depressive disorder, dysthymia, and bipolar dis-
order),andanxietydisorders(panicdisorder,socialanxietydis-
order, specific phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder). As
documentedbypreviousnationalandinternationalstudies,the
test-retest reliability of the AUDADIS-IV is good to excellent for
SUDs (κ>0.74), good for major depressive disorder (κ, 0.65-
0.73), and fair to good for other mood and anxiety disorders (κ,
0.40-0.60).30,31HavinganewAxisIdisorderwasdefinedbythe

Key Points
Question: Does cannabis use increase the risk of psychiatric
disorders?
Findings: In this survey of a nationally representative sample
of US adults, cannabis use was associated with significantly
increased risk for developing alcohol, cannabis, and other drug use
disorders as defined by the DSM-IV at 3 years of follow-up.
However, cannabis use was not associated with increased risk
for developing mood or anxiety disorders.
Meaning: Cannabis use is associated with an increased risk
of developing drug and alcohol use disorders.

obtained unadjusted estimates of the observed associations.
Weighted estimates and odds ratios of the prevalence and in-
cidence of psychiatric disorders at wave 2 by cannabis use in
the past 12 months at wave 1 were computed. Odds ratios are
considered significant if their 95% CIs do not include 1. Inci-
dence refers to disorders that were reported at wave 2 among
respondents without a lifetime history of the disorder at wave
1. We used a linear χ2 test to examine the existence of dose-
response associations between cannabis use and prevalence
and incidence of psychiatric disorders.
Second, we considered 2 different statistical methods (ie,
multipleregressionandpropensityscorematching)27toobtain
estimates of the unconfounded association between cannabis
use and psychiatric disorders. By controlling for variables that
could increase the probability of both cannabis use and the
prevalenceandincidenceofpsychiatricdisorders,theadjusted
associations from these methods yield estimates of their inde-
pendent association, assuming no unmeasured confounders.
Both methods, which tend to provide similar results in large
samples,32-34 used the same set of confounders measured at
wave 1 found to be highly predictive of lifetime cannabis use.35
Theconfoundersincludeabroadrangeofpredictorsfrom5tiers
(childhood,earlyadolescence,lateadolescence,adulthood,and
pastyear)ofthemodeldescribedbyBlancoetal.35Tominimize
the risk of reverse causality, variables in the past-year tier (co-
morbidity with psychiatric disorders in the year of the assess-
ment of cannabis use, marital problems, and number of stress-
ful life events) were not included in the model. Confounders
from the childhood tier included family history of SUDs (life-
time history of alcohol or drug use disorders in the biological
parents or siblings), parental loss (parent’
s divorce or death of
atleast1parentbeforetheparticipantwas18yearsold),andvul-
nerable family environment (parental absence or separation
from a biological parent before age 18 years). The confounders
fortheearly-adolescencetierincludedlowself-esteem(dichoto-
mous; scored 1 if respondents believed they were not as good,
smart, or attractive as most other people), age at onset of anxi-
ety disorders (with childhood onset before age 18 years), and
social deviance (assessed as the number of conduct disorder or
antisocial personality disorder behaviors in which the respon-
dent engaged before age 15 years; range, 0-33). Confounder in
the late-adolescence tier included educational level (in years),
number of personality disorders, and number of Axis I disor-
ders with onset before age 18 years. Confounders in the adult-
hood tier included history of divorce, history of SUD (alcohol
usedisorder,nicotinedependence,anddrugusedisorderother
than cannabis use disorders), and social deviance (measured
as the number of antisocial personality disorder behaviors in
which the individual engaged after age 15 years but prior to the
wave 1 assessment). The covariates also included age, sex, and
race/ethnicity (white or nonwhite). In total, 18 covariates were
considered.
Multivariable logistic regression was performed in the full
samplewithpsychiatricdisorderatwave2astheoutcome,can-
nabis use in the past 12 months at wave 1 as the primary pre-
dictor of interest, and all 18 covariates included as main effects
for control. The adjusted odds ratios and 95% CIs for cannabis
associated with incidence and prevalence were obtained.
Propensity score matching was performed in 2 steps: first,
obtainingthepropensityscore,andsecond,matchingeachcase
(ie, cannabis user) with controls (ie, nonusers) who had very
similar propensity scores. Each respondent’
s propensity score
was his or her predicted probability of cannabis use from a lo-
gisticregressionmodelwithcannabisuseinthepast12months
as a binary variable (use or nonuse) at wave 1 as the outcome
andall18potentialconfoundersaspredictorsincludingall2-way

amongcannabisusersandtheirpropensityscore–matchedcon-
trols was checked before conducting additional analyses. Un-
confounded odds ratios between psychiatric disorders at wave
2 and cannabis use in the past 12 months at wave 1 were than
obtained using the matched sample. All SEs and 95% CIs in the
analyses of the full sample and the propensity score–matched

Results
Analysis of the Full Sample
Distribution of Covariates
In the full sample of 34 653 respondents (14 564 male [47.9%
weighted]; mean [SD] age, 45.1 [17.3] years), the 1279 individu-
als with cannabis use (772 male [66.4% weighted]; mean [SD]
age, 29.9 [10.7] years) had greater odds of most risk predic-
tors examined except age and history of divorce, which were
lower among individuals with cannabis use, and educational
level and nonwhite race/ethnicity, which did not differ across
groups (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Among the individuals
with cannabis use, 345 (28.4% weighted) had cannabis abuse
in the past year and 99 (7.7%) had cannabis dependence in the
past year (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Prevalence and Incidence of Disorders in Wave 2
Table 1 and Table 2, respectively, present the prevalence and
incidence of wave 2 psychiatric disorders among respon-
dents with and without cannabis use in the past year at
wave 1. In the full sample, cannabis use in the past year at
wave 1 was associated with significantly greater prevalence
(Table 1) and incidence (Table 2) of all disorders at wave 2,
except major depressive disorder and dysthymia (as well as
incidence of specific phobia). For both prevalence and inci-
dence, the largest odds ratios were for cannabis use disor-
ders. After adjusting for the covariates, cannabis use in
wave 1 predicted increased prevalence (Table 1) and inci-
dence (Table 2) of all wave 2 substance use disorders,
including nicotine dependence, but not of mood or anxiety
disorders. The pattern of findings in the adjusted and unad-
justed results remained the same whether cannabis use was
examined as a dichotomous or continuous (ie, frequency of
use) variable (eTables 3 and 4 in the Supplement). The
prevalence of any mental disorder at wave 2 tended to
increase with increasing level of exposure to cannabis at

wave 1, with the largest increment occurring between 0 and
1 marijuana joints per day (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Analysis of the Propensity Matched Samples
Distribution of Covariates
After matching individuals on their propensity scores, there
were no differences in the odds of any of the predictors exam-
ined, indicating that the propensity score model was success-
ful in balancing the distribution of covariates (eTable 6 in the
Supplement).
Prevalence and Incidence of Disorders in Wave 2
Individuals who used cannabis at wave 1 had greater odds than
nonusers of prevalence (Table 3) and incidence (Table 4) of all
SUDs, including nicotine dependence. All findings remained
similar between the 2 statistical methods when cannabis use
wasconsideredasadichotomousvariable,exceptcannabisuse
was associated with significantly increased incidence of so-
cial anxiety disorder in the propensity score–matched analy-
sis (Table 4) but not the multiple regression analysis (Table 2).
Similar patterns were observed in the propensity score–
matched analysis that considered frequency of cannabis use
(eTables 7 and 8 in the Supplement). A greater frequency of
cannabis use was also associated with significantly increased
oddsofincidentsocialanxietydisorder(eTable8intheSupple-
ment). The percentage of individuals with any wave 2 disor-
der increased with the frequency of wave 1 cannabis use, with
the largest increase occurring between no cannabis use in the
past 12 months and cannabis use that was less than once per
month (Figure).
Discussion
In a large nationally representative sample, we prospectively
examined associations between cannabis use and psychiatric
disorders. In unadjusted analyses in the full population, can-
nabis use was associated with increased prevalence and inci-
dence of a broad range of psychiatric disorders. However, af-
teradjustingforseveralcovariatesthatpredictedcannabisuse,
multiple regression analysis and propensity score matching
converged in indicating that cannabis use was associated only
with increased prevalence and incidence of alcohol and drug
use disorders, including nicotine dependence. For most find-
ings, higher frequency of cannabis use was associated with
greater risk of disorder incidence and prevalence.
Wefoundimportantcontrastsbetweenassociationsofcan-
nabis use with psychiatric disorders in the unadjusted and ad-
justed analyses. Our findings extend previous findings that
have focused on younger individuals or a restricted number
of disorders to several age groups and disorders. The new re-
sults also help reconcile discrepant findings from prior studies

by suggesting that most of the association of cannabis use with
non-SUD psychiatric disorders is explained by differences in
the distribution of confounders between cannabis users and
nonusers.14,15,17-19,23-25Inaddition,ourfindingssupportadose-
response association between cannabis use and the risk of
SUDs.16,17
A second important finding was that, even after adjusting
for multiple confounders, cannabis use was associated at fol-
low-up with increased odds of prevalence and incidence of all
SUDs, including nicotine dependence, although not with other
mood or anxiety disorders. The development of cross-
adaptations through shared mechanisms of action or
neuroadaptation36 between cannabis and other substances, as
well as greater overlap of circuitry across SUDs than overlap of
thecircuitryofSUDswithmoodandanxietydisorders,37-39may
contribute to the association of cannabis use with SUDs but not
with most other disorders examined. Use of cannabis can also
lead to behavioral disinhibition, which increases the likeli-
hood of use of other substances and the risk of abuse or de-
pendence on those substances.40
The reasons for the association of cannabis use with in-
creased incidence of social anxiety disorder in the propensity-
matched analysis are less obvious. Cannabis use may lead to
social avoidance that over time may promote social anxiety in
a subgroup of individuals.40,41 In practice, new-onset or wors-
ening social anxiety might prompt clinical evaluation of
whether cannabis is a contributing factor. Because prior pro-
spective research with young people also indicates that social

anxiety disorder increases the risk of cannabis dependence,42
bidirectional causality is possible. However, because the re-
sults were significant only in the propensity score matching,
but not in the multiple regression analysis, they should be con-
sidered with caution pending replication.
Fromaperspectiveofprevention,thelackofassociationbe-
tween more frequent cannabis use with increased risk of most
mood and anxiety disorders does not diminish the important
public health significance of the association between cannabis
use and increased prevalence and incidence of drug and alco-
holusedisorders(includingnicotinedependence).Smokingand
alcohol consumption are, respectively, the first and third lead-
ing causes of preventable death,43 and illicit drug use is asso-
ciatedwithincreasedratesofincarcerationandnearly$200bil-
lion each year in costs owing to national health care, lost
productivity, incarceration, and drug enforcement.44,45
Taken together, our findings suggest caution in the imple-
mentation of policies related to legalization of cannabis for rec-
reational use, as it may lead to greater availability and accep-
tance of cannabis, reduced perception of risk of use,25 and
increased risk of adverse mental health outcomes, such as sub-
stance use disorders.2,46-48 While the health benefits of can-
nabis use require further testing among patients who are un-
responsive to more traditional treatments,5 the association of
cannabis use with negative mental health outcomes, such as
substanceusedisorders,appearsstrong.Agreaterunderstand-
ing of potential negative psychological effects of cannabis use
may help inform the ongoing debates regarding the legal sta-
tus of medical and recreational cannabis and implementa-
tion of new legislation that incorporates scientific evidence as
well as political considerations. In the meantime, educa-
tional campaigns regarding the potential adverse conse-
quences of cannabis use may help limit the expansion of
recreational use.49
The results of this study should be interpreted in the light
of several limitations. First, despite its prospective design, our
study does not establish a causal association between canna-
bis use and new onset of disorders because of the possibility
of residual confounding, particularly confounders that may
vary over time across survey waves. However, prospective ob-
servational studies of large nationally representative cohorts
such as the NESARC may be the strongest source of available
information for the foreseeable future in light of ethical con-
straints on randomized clinical trials in this area. Second, the
follow-up period was limited to 3 years. Longer follow-up may
have revealed different patterns of incidence or prevalence.
Different patterns also might have been observed if we had ex-
cluded individuals who used cannabis in the past but stopped
becausetheydevelopedsymptomsofamentaldisorder.Third,
cannabis use was assessed through self-report and not con-
firmed with objective means. Fourth, although the NESARC
is the largest prospective study with detailed psychiatric di-
agnostic information, sample size constraints limit our power
todetectpotentiallymeaningfulsignificantdifferencesinsome
strata. Last, despite including the most common mental dis-
orders, some disorders were not assessed.
Conclusions
Our study indicates that cannabis use is associated with in-
creased prevalence and incidence of substance use disor-
ders. These adverse psychiatric outcomes should be taken un-
der careful consideration in clinical care and policy planning.
