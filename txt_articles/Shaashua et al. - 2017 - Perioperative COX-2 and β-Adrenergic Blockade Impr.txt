Abstract
Purpose: Translational studies suggest that excess perioperative
release of catecholamines and prostaglandins may facilitate
metastasis and reduce disease-free survival. This trial tested the
combined perioperative blockade of these pathways in breast
cancer patients.
Experimental Design: In a randomized placebo-controlled
biomarker trial, 38 early-stage breast cancer patients received
11 days of perioperative treatment with a b-adrenergic antagonist
(propranolol) and a COX-2 inhibitor (etodolac), beginning 5
days before surgery. Excised tumors and sequential blood samples
were assessed for prometastatic biomarkers.
Results: Drugs were well tolerated with adverse event rates
comparable with placebo. Transcriptome profiling of the primary
tumor tested a priori hypotheses and indicated that drug treatment
significantly (i) decreased epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition,
(ii) reduced activity of prometastatic/proinflammatory transcrip-
tion factors (GATA-1, GATA-2, early-growth-response-3/EGR3,
signal transducer and activator of transcription-3/STAT-3), and
(iii) decreased tumor-infiltrating monocytes while increasing
tumor-infiltrating B cells. Drug treatment also significantly abro-
gated presurgical increases in serum IL6 and C-reactive protein
levels, abrogated perioperative declines in stimulated IL12 and
IFNg
production, abrogated postoperative mobilization of
CD16� "classical" monocytes, and enhanced expression of
CD11a on circulating natural killer cells.
Conclusions: Perioperative inhibition of COX-2 and b-adren-
ergic signaling provides a safe and effective strategy for inhibiting
multiple cellular and molecular pathways related to metastasis
and disease recurrence in early-stage breast cancer. Clin Cancer Res;

Introduction
The removal of a primary tumor, and the abolition of its
potential immunosuppressive and metastasis-promoting effects
(1), presents a window of opportunity to eliminate or control any
remaining minimal residual disease. Unfortunately, the periop-
erative period and the excision of a primary tumor also trigger a
variety of physiologic processes that may potentially accelerate the
progression of pre-existing micrometastases and promote the
initiation of new metastases (2, 3). As such, the perioperative
period plays a critical role in determining long-term cancer out-
comes, disproportionally to its short duration (4). Importantly,
preclinical animal models of cancer suggest that pharmacologic
modification of perioperative physiology could be exploited to
reduce the burden of residual disease (4).
Specifically, animal studies using syngeneic or human xeno-
graft models of cancer have implicated peri-surgical high levels
of catecholamines and prostaglandins in mediating many of
the prometastatic effects of surgery and perioperative stress
(2, 4, 5). Catecholamines and prostaglandins are released by
tumor cells, stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment,
and by host physiologic systems as a result of physiologic and
psychologic stress responses to coping with cancer, tissue
damage, pain, and a variety of surgical impacts (6). These
signaling pathways can act directly on tumor cells to enhance
their proliferation, motility, invasive capacity, resistance to
anoikis, secretion of angiogenic factors (5, 7–9), and epitheli-
al-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT; refs. 7, 10). Catechola-
mines and prostaglandins can also indirectly promote metas-
tasis by suppressing cell-mediated immunity (2), increasing
prometastatic cytokines (e.g., IL8; ref. 11), and inducing inflam-
mation, which is a hallmark of cancer progression (12).
During the last decade, we and others have found that phar-
macologic inhibition of b-adrenoceptors and/or prostaglandin

 synthesis can reduce the prometastatic and immune-suppressive
effects of stress and surgery (9, 13–18). In these preclinical studies,
the simultaneous administration of a b-blocker (propranolol)
and a COX-2 inhibitor (etodolac) in combination (rather than
each drug alone) has generally proven most effective, and some-
times constitutes the only effective approach (19–21). The syn-
ergistic effect of combined treatment protocols may stem from the
fact that catecholamines and prostaglandins are both elevated
perioperatively and each can increase metastatic propensity
through converging pathways (i.e., activation of the cAMP-Pro-
tein Kinase A signaling system). Simultaneous inhibition of COX-
2 and b-adrenergic signaling has reduced postoperative metastasis
(and in some cases improved overall survival) in multiple pre-
clinical tumor models including breast, colon, lung, melanoma,
and leukemia (19, 20, 22–24). Consistent with these preclinical
studies, several pharmaco-epidemiologic studies have also docu-
mented reductions in breast cancer progression or recurrence in
patients who happened to be taking b-blockers at or before initial
diagnosis (25, 26). Long-term use of COX-inhibiting NSAIDs was
also associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer (27). To
assess the potential biological impact of combined perioperative
COX-2 and b-adrenergic inhibition in human breast cancer, we
herein conducted a randomized placebo-controlled biomarker
trial employing etodolac and propranolol. Primary outcome
analyses tested whether this combined drug treatment would
reduce proinflammatory and prometastatic transcriptome pro-
files in the malignant tissue.
Three specific transcriptome signatures were targeted a priori
based on previous research implicating them in COX-2 and/or
b-adrenergic influences on breast cancer progression and metas-
tasis. (i) The primary tumor's EMT profile was assessed as mes-
enchymal polarization has been shown to promote intravasation
and extravasation of epithelial tumor cells (28), and because both
COX-2 activation and b-adrenergic signaling can promote EMT
[COX-2 by inducing matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and
MMP-2 (10) and inhibiting Smad signaling (29), and b-adren-
ergic signaling by upregulating SNAIL and TWIST transcription
factors (7)]. (ii) Transcriptome signatures of tumor-infiltrating
leukocyte subpopulations were assessed based on data-linking
monocyte/macrophage infiltration to breast cancer metastasis
and B lymphocyte infiltration to reduced progression. (iii)
Proinflammatory and prometastatic transcription control path-
ways previously implicated in breast cancer progression were
also assessed [nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB)/cRel, activator-
protein-1 (AP-1), GATA family, STAT family, NRF-2, EGR
family transcription factors, and the glucocorticoid receptor
(GR)]. Secondary outcome analyses addressed peripheral
immune parameters, including serum and ex-vivo–stimulated
Th1 and inflammatory cytokines (IL12, IFNg), NK-cell activa-
tion markers, and circulating leukocyte populations (with a
particular focus on monocytes due to their involvement in
metastasis). This is the first clinical trial to test the efficacy of
a combined perioperative treatment with a b-blocker and a
COX-2 inhibitor in breast cancer patients.
Materials and Methods
Patients and inclusion/exclusion criteria
Thirty-eight women (age 33–70) diagnosed with stage I–III
breast cancer were enrolled from three medical centers in Israel.
Exclusion criteria included (i) any contraindication for the drugs,
such as diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, or low blood
pressure, (ii) chronic use of any b-blocker or COX inhibitor, and
(iii) chronic autoimmune disease. The study protocol (Clinical-
Trials.gov Identifier: NCT00502684) was approved by Institu-
tional Review Boards at each study site, and written informed
consent was obtained from patients before performing any study-
related procedures.
Study design and drug treatment
This multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled randomized
biomarker trial employed two equal-sized arms of drug- and
placebo treatment (Figs. 1A and 1B). Patient randomization was
stratified by age within each medical center (below or above 50).
Drug/placebo was administered for 11 consecutive days, start-
ing 5 days before resection of the primary tumor (Fig. 1B). Oral
BID etodolac (400 mg) was administered throughout the treat-
ment period. Propranolol was administered orally using extended
release formulations: 20 mg BID during the 5 days preceding
surgery; 80 mg on the morning of surgery and on the evening and
morning following surgery; and 20 mg BID thereafter during 5
postoperative days. Identical schedules were used for placebo and
medication.
Endpoints and assessments
Excised tumor tissuewasfixed in 4% formaldehyde and stored as
a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) block. Five 5-mm sec-
tions were used for gene expression profiling as described below.
Four blood samples were obtained between 7 and 11 AM. The first
was taken before medication initiation (T1); the second and third
were taken on the mornings before and after surgery (T2 and T3,
respectively),atleast1hourafterthemorningmedicationdose;and
the fourth was taken at least 2 days after treatment cessation (T4;
median of 16 days postmedication; Fig. 1B).
Gene expression profiling and bioinformatic analysis
Detailed methods and references for gene expression profiling
and bioinformatic analysis are presented in the Supplementary
Methods. Briefly, RNA was extracted from five 5-mm FFPE sections
Translational Relevance
The clinical trial reported here supports the safety and
efficacy of pharmacologically inhibiting b-adrenergic and
COX-2 pathways during the perioperative period in early-stage
breast cancer. Preclinical studies have shown that simulta-
neous blockade of these two pathways improves long-term
survival rates in several models of primary tumor excision.
Moreover, this treatment is inexpensive and clinically feasible
for patients without contraindications for the medications
used (�50% of patients). Given the positive biomarker indi-
cations reported in the present proof-of-concept trial, future
studies assessing clinical impact on disease progress/recur-
rence and overall survival are justified. This treatment may
also be beneficial in a variety of cancer types and does not
contraindicate other cancer therapies. As such, brief perioper-
ative inhibition of b-adrenergic and COX-2 signaling may
provide a novel strategy for improving long-term cancer
outcomes.

 of breast tumors, tested for sufficient mass, and subjected to
genome-wide transcriptional profiling using Illumina Human
HT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips (Illumina Inc.) with quantile
normalization (30). Linear model analyses of log2-transformed
expression values quantified the difference in average expres-
sion between groups (drug treatment vs. placebo) after con-
trolling for tumor stage. A priori hypotheses regarding EMT
polarization and tumor-associated leukocyte transcriptomes
were tested using Transcript Origin Analyses to relate all genes
showing � 1.25-fold differential expression in this study to
previously published reference transcriptome profiles derived
from mesenchymal- versus epithelial-polarized breast cancer
cells (GSE13915) or isolated leukocyte subsets (GSE1133). A
priori hypotheses regarding activity of breast cancer-relevant
transcription control pathways were tested using TELiS bioin-
formatic analysis of transcription factor binding motifs in the
promoters of all genes showing � 1.25-fold differential expres-
sion, using TRANSFAC position-specific weight matrices for
inflammation-related pathways (NF-kB/cRel, AP-1), GATA
family factors GATA1-GATA3, cytokine response factors STAT1
and STAT3, the oxidative stress response factor NRF-2, the
neuroendocrine response factor GR, and EGR family transcrip-
tion factors EGR1-EGR4/NGFIC, as previously described. Sta-
tistical testing of bioinformatics results was based on standard
errors derived from bootstrap resampling of linear model
residual vectors over all genes assayed (which accounts for any
potential correlation across genes).
Blood collection, ELISA, flow cytometry, and induced cytokine
production
The Supplementary Methods detail the standard procedures
used to assess serum IL6, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL10, and
cortisol; ex-vivo lipopolysaccharide- (LPS) and phytohaemagglu-
tinin- (PHA) stimulated production of IFNg and IL12; and flow
cytometric analyses of NK-cell activation markers and leukocyte
subset prevalence.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were two-sided and conducted based on a priori
hypotheses. Our primary hypothesis was that drug treatment
would reduce three progression-related transcriptome profiles
in malignant tissue (EMT, tumor-associated monocyte/macro-
phage
transcriptomes,
and
proinflammatory/prometastatic
transcription factors). Our secondary hypothesis was that drug
treatment would shift circulating immune parameters toward
lower inflammatory and higher antimetastatic immunity as
indicated by serum and ex-vivo–stimulated cytokine levels, NK-cell
activation markers, and circulating "classical" (CD14þþCD16�)
monocytes.
For tumor transcriptome analyses, the statistical significance of
bioinformatic result ratios (Drugs/Placebo) was tested by the
Student t test. For blood-measures analyses, a planned contrast
was used to compare the impact of drug treatment (average of
T2 and T3) with untreated levels (average of T1 and T4) (i.e.,
Drugs[(T2þ T3)� (T1þT4)]� Placebo[(T2 þ T3)� (T1þ T4)]),
and post-hoc comparisons were performed to assess group differ-
ences at specific time points. For serum cytokine levels and gene
expression assessments, data were log transformed to stabilize
variance. Blood sample data during treatment were expressed as a
percentage of the average value at no-treatment time points (i.e.,
average of T1 and T4).
Results
Demographics, adverse events, and drug compliance
The two groups did not differ on any demographic or cancer-
related characteristic assessed (Tables 1 and 2). Two patients
reported physical discomfort within the first 2 days of treatment
(before hospitalization): one placebo-treated patient reported
anxiety and showed increased heart rate and blood pressure; a
second drug-treated patient reported nausea. Both self-withdrew
without further medical examination, and no additional samples
were collected from these patients. The other 36 women reported
no adverse events and consumed at least 95% of their medication/
placebo doses.
Tumor gene expression
Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of tumor tissues iden-
tified 163 genes showing >1.25-fold upregulation in tumors
from drug-treated patients versus placebo-treated controls, and
141 genes were equivalently down regulated. A priori–specified
bioinformatic analyses, using previously published mesenchy-
mal and epithelial breast cancer cell transcriptomes as reference
points, showed that drug treatment reduced the extent of
mesenchymal polarization (diagnosticity z-score: mean ¼
–0.43 � SE 0.09, P < 0.0001) but had no significant effect on
epithelial-characteristic gene expression (þ0.13 � 0.11, P ¼
0.106; Fig. 2A). Similar a priori–specified tumor transcriptome
analyses using isolated leukocyte subpopulations as reference
points (Fig. 2B) indicated that drug treatment reduced expres-
sion of CD14þ monocyte-related transcripts (–0.42 � 0.15, P ¼
0.0036) and increased expression of genes characteristic of
CD19þ B cells (þ0.45 � 0.17, P ¼ 0.0033). We also tested a
priori hypotheses regarding specific transcription control path-
ways that are linked to prometastatic processes of inflamma-
tion, tissue invasion, and EMT. Promoter-based bioinformatic
analyses (Fig. 2C) indicated downregulated activity of GATA-1
(log2 fold difference in promoter binding site prevalence:
mean ¼ –0.48 � 0.10, P < 0.0001), GATA-2 (–0.40 � 10,
P ¼ 0.0001), STAT3 (–1.61 � 0.66, P ¼ 0.0154), EGR-3 (–0.70
� 0.35, P ¼ 0.048), and GRE (–0.85 � 0.42, P ¼ 0.043) in
tumors from drug-treated patients.
Serum levels of soluble factors
As expected, given that psychologic and physiologic stress
responses intensify in the lead-up to surgery (31), serum levels
of IL6 increased by 24% � 12.1% from T1 to T2 in the placebo-
treated group and CRP levels similarly increased by 41.5% �
20.5% (Fig. 3A and B). However, this pattern was significantly
reversed in the drug-treated group (11.3% � 5.5% decline for IL6,
P ¼ 0.0009; 10% � 10.7% decline for CRP, P ¼ 0.034). On the
morning after surgery (T3), both placebo- and drug-treated
groups showed increases in IL6 and CRP above presurgical levels
(IL6: þ573% � 97% and þ442% � 70% for placebo- and drug-
treated groups, respectively; CRP: þ828% � 285% and þ635% �
281%; all P < 0.001). A planned contrast of drug- versus placebo-
treated groups during treatment (average of T2 and T3) versus off
treatment (average of T1and T4) showed a significant reduction in
IL6 for the drug-treated group (P ¼ 0.011), and a marginally
significant reduction in CRP. Drug treatment did not significantly
affect serum cortisol or IL10 concentrations at any time point
(Fig. 3C and D).

 Immune indices in blood samples
In the placebo-treated group, ex-vivo LPS- and PHA-stimu-
lated production of IL12 and IFNg decreased progressively from
T1 to T3 (IL12: –38% � 10%; IFNg: –30.2% � 9.1%; both P <
0.0001), as previously reported (31). Drug treatment blocked
this decrease, resulting in higher levels of these cytokines at T2
and T3 (i.e., for the planned contrast described above, IL12:
þ50.8% � 15.2%, P ¼ 0.028; IFNg: þ31% � 8.6%, P ¼
0.024; Fig. 4A and B).
Drug treatment also blocked an influx of CD14þþCD16�
classical monocytes into circulation on the morning after surgery
(T3; difference ¼ 85% � 15%, P ¼ 0.032; Fig. 4C), and increased
expression of the activation marker CD11a on NK cells
(CD3�CD56þCD16þ) during treatment (average of T2 and T3)
versus off treatment (average of T1 and T4; difference ¼ þ16% �
6.3%, P ¼ 0.024; Fig. 4D).
Discussion
These data show that perioperative administration of the
b-adrenergic antagonist propranolol and the COX-2 inhibitor
etodolac induces multiple favorable impacts on (i) primary tumor
gene expression profiles (bioinformatic indications of reduced
EMT; reduced activity of GATA-1, GATA-2, EGR3, GRE, and STAT3
transcription factors; and reduced tumor-associated monocytes
and increased tumor-associated B cells) and on (ii) circulating
immune parameters (serum and ex-vivo–induced cytokine levels,
reduced classical monocyte influx, and increased NK-cell activa-
tion markers). Each of these outcomes has previously been
linked to reduced tumor progression in preclinical animal models
and/or human clinical studies. This study was designed solely as a
randomized controlled test of perioperative propranolol and
etodolac effects on biomarker outcomes, and involved no

 long-term assessment of clinical outcomes. However, the favor-
able safety profile and favorable impacts on tumor transcriptome
profiles and immune parameters provide a rationale for future
clinical trials employing more robust sample sizes and long-term
follow-up to assess impacts of perioperative COX-2 and b-adren-
ergic inhibition on clinical outcomes in early-stage breast cancer.
Tumor molecular characteristics
Drug treatment reduced tumor molecular biomarkers of EMT.
This finding corresponds well with animal studies indicating that
COX-2 inhibitors and b-adrenergic antagonists can inhibit EMT in
human tumor xenografts (5, 32). In metastatic breast cancer, a
mesenchymal phenotype is more prevalent in circulating tumor
cells than in the primary tumor (33), suggesting the clinical
significance of EMT for metastasis. Moreover, the EMT profile of
the primary tumor predicts long-term cancer outcomes, including
overall survival (34), in several cancer types.
Drug treatment also decreased intra-tumoral molecular indi-
cators of several pro-metastatic transcription control pathways,
including GATA-1, GATA-2, and EGR3. GATA-1 exerts antiapop-
totic activity (35) and promotes EMT by downregulating E-cad-
herin (5), and GATA-2 can inhibit the tumor-suppressor gene,
phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN; ref. 36). Both factors
promote breast cancer development and progression (37). EGR3
is induced by estrogen signaling (38) and has been linked to
lymph node status, metastatic spread, and poor prognosis (39).
Drug treatment also reduced indicated activity of the GR, which
can enhance tumor cell survival by inducing Bcl-xL (40), inducing
antiapoptotic signaling (41, 42), suppressing p53 activity (43),
and inducing chemoresistance (8).
Inflammatory indicators in the tumor and circulation
Previous studies have reported that psychologic and surgery-
related sympathetic nervous system stress responses can elevate
levels of proinflammatory ligands, including IL6 and CRP (44).
In the current study, both IL6 and CRP levels increased before
surgery in the placebo group (from T1 to T2), but drug treat-
ment reversed this effect and reduced levels of both inflamma-
tory indicators at T2. IL6 and CRP are associated with tumor
progression and poor prognosis in multiple solid tumor types,

 including breast, lung, and prostate, and hematopoietic malig-
nancies (37, 45). IL6 activates the janus-kinase-STAT signaling
pathway, which is well known to promote tumor cell prolifer-
ation, survival, and invasion, as well as immunosuppression
and inflammation. STAT3 and STAT5 are strongly associated
with cancer progression (37). Here, both plasma IL6 levels and
indicators of tumor STAT3 activity were reduced by the drug
treatment. Drug treatment also effectively blocked a marked
postoperative (T3) mobilization of "classical" proinflammatory
CD14þþCD16� monocytes.
Thus,
combined perioperative
b-blockade and COX-2 inhibition may inhibit stress-induced
inflammatory and metastatic processes through multiple cellu-
lar and molecular pathways.
Immune status in the tumor and circulation
Transcriptome profiling of the primary tumor also indicated
potential effects of the combined perioperative drug treatment in
increasing tumor-infiltrating B cells and decreasing tumor-asso-
ciated monocyte/macrophages. Tumor-infiltrating B cells com-
prise up to 60% of the tumor-associated lymphocytes (46,47) and
predict increased survival rates in breast cancer (47, 48). Mono-
cyte recruitment by tumors was shown in several animal models
to be enhanced by b-adrenergic signaling, and to promote cancer
progression (5). In human cancers, tumor-infiltrating monocytes,
which often transform into M2-macrophages, are correlated with
decreased survival in many solid tumors including breast, thyroid,
and bladder cancers (49, 50). Thus, the profile of immune cell

yielded RNA of sufficient quality for transcriptome
profiling (10 drug-treated and 15 placebo). A, Effects of
drug treatment on primary tumor EMT gene expression
were quantified by Transcript Origin Analysis (58) of 163

 alterations reflected in whole-tumor transcriptome profiling indi-
cates favorable effects of this drug regimen on local immune cell
mediators of disease progression.
Consistent with previous reports in animal models, (31) stress
and surgery also decreased LPS- and PHA-induced production of
IFNg and IL12 by circulating leukocytes. However, this suppres-
sion was abrogated by drug treatment. These Th1 cytokines are
prominent activators of antitumor CTL and NK cells (2). The drug
treatment also increased expression of CD11a (lymphocyte func-
tion-associated antigen-1; LFA-1) on circulating NK cells. This
membrane glycoprotein is a marker of NK-cell activation and
interacts with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and
other tumor ligands to promote tumor lysis by NK cells (51). In a
preclinical model, where a spontaneously metastasizing ortho-
topic primary tumor was excised, surgery reduced CD11a expres-
sion on NK cells and our perioperative drug treatment (propran-
olol and etodolac) blocked that effect and improved long-term
survival rates (20).
Perioperative significance of the treatment and safety
concerns
Combined administration of propranolol and etodolac had
favorable impacts on multiple biomarkers assessed before,
during, and following surgery. Given that both catecholamines
and prostaglandins are abundant throughout the perioperative
period, and that micrometastases and residual disease may
exist before and following surgery, these data suggest that
treatment throughout the
entire
perioperative
period
is
optimal.
The safety of this drug regimen is discussed in greater detail
in the Supplementary Methods. Briefly, for patients without
contraindications, the safety profiles of propranolol and eto-
dolac are well established, especially for the short duration
employed here (52, 53). Concerns and variable findings have
been reported regarding the perioperative use of b1-selective
antagonists (54), but no evidence indicates a risk associated
with use of nonselective b-adrenergic antagonists such as pro-
pranolol. Tissue healing was shown in animal studies not to be
adversely affected by either drug or by their combined use (55).
In the current study and in a previous study in cancer patients
(56), we observed no serious or moderate adverse events
associated with this treatment regimen. This favorable safety
profile is important in evaluating the overall cost–benefit ratio
for the present drug regimen, especially as both chronic and
perioperative uses of COX inhibitors or b-adrenergic blockers
have been associated with improved cancer outcomes (4, 7,
57). Thus, any hypothetical long-term risk associated with the
combined use of propranolol and etodolac appears empirically

 unlikely and should be weighed against the positive outcomes
reported by translational, epidemiologic, and clinical studies,
as well as by the favorable profile of molecular and cellular
biomarkers observed in this trial.
Limitations
This study was designed solely as a randomized controlled
proof-of-concept test of perioperative propranolol and etodolac
effects on metastasis-related biomarkers in early-stage breast
cancer. This study was powered only to detect those biomarker
outcomes (based on effect sizes previously observed in preclinical
studies), and it provides no information about long-term clinical
outcomes (e.g., effects on relapse-free or overall survival). The
generality of these results also needs to be examined in future
studies beyond the present single-nation context, and possibly
examining alternative treatment durations and regimens (includ-
ing the use of each agent alone in addition to combined use) and
selective targeting of high-risk disease settings (e.g., ER�/PR�/
her2� breast cancer) and other cancer types. It is also important to
note that the biomarkers examined in this trial were selected a
priori as outcomes (based on previous clinical and preclinical
research) and are not intended to provide a prognostic biomarker
for clinical disease progression.
Summary
Data from this first clinical trial of perioperative treatment with
a COX-2 inhibitor and a b-adrenergic antagonist in early-stage
breast cancer find a favorable safety profile and favorable impact
on multiple tumor and circulating biomarkers associated with
cancer progression and metastasis. These findings provide a
biological rationale for future clinical trials to assess the impact
of this easily implemented, safe, and inexpensive treatment
regimen on long-term clinical outcomes (e.g., overall and recur-
rence-free survival).
