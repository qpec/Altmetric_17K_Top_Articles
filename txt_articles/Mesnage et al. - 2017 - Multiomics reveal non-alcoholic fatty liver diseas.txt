Multiomics reveal non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease in rats following 
chronic exposure to an ultra-low 
dose of Roundup herbicide

The impairment of liver function by low environmentally relevant doses of glyphosate-based herbicides 
(GBH) is still a debatable and unresolved matter. Previously we have shown that rats administered for 
2 years with 0.1 ppb (50 ng/L glyphosate equivalent dilution; 4 ng/kg body weight/day daily intake) of a 
Roundup GBH formulation showed signs of enhanced liver injury as indicated by anatomorphological, 
blood/urine biochemical changes and transcriptome profiling. Here we present a multiomic study 
combining metabolome and proteome liver analyses to obtain further insight into the Roundup-
induced pathology. Proteins significantly disturbed (214 out of 1906 detected, q < 0.05) were 
involved in organonitrogen metabolism and fatty acid β-oxidation. Proteome disturbances reflected 
peroxisomal proliferation, steatosis and necrosis. The metabolome analysis (55 metabolites altered out 
of 673 detected, p < 0.05) confirmed lipotoxic conditions and oxidative stress by showing an activation 
of glutathione and ascorbate free radical scavenger systems. Additionally, we found metabolite 
alterations associated with hallmarks of hepatotoxicity such as γ-glutamyl dipeptides, acylcarnitines, 
and proline derivatives. Overall, metabolome and proteome disturbances showed a substantial overlap 
with biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its progression to steatohepatosis and thus 
confirm liver functional dysfunction resulting from chronic ultra-low dose GBH exposure.
Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), such as Roundup, are the major pesticides used worldwide1. Residues of 
GBH are routinely detected in foodstuffs2,3 and drinking water4. Epidemiological data on the human body burden 
of GBH residues is very limited but evidence suggests that glyphosate and its metabolites are widespread5. The 
active principle of GBH, glyphosate, is a competitive inhibitor of phosphoenolpyruvate6. Glyphosate acts as a 
herbicide by inhibiting 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) of the shikimate aromatic amino 
acid biosynthesis pathway present in plants and some bacteria7.
A number of toxicity studies have shown that glyphosate and its commercial formulations have non-target 
effects on mammalian metabolism and provoke toxic effects, especially with respect to liver and kidney structure 
and function8,9. Potential adverse hepatic effects of glyphosate were first observed in the 1980s, including its abil-
ity to disrupt liver mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation10. As glyphosate can act as a protonophore increasing 
mitochondrial membrane permeability to protons and Ca2+ 11, it can trigger the production of reactive oxygen 
species resulting in observed oxidative stress12. Elevation in oxidative stress markers is detected in rat liver and 
kidney after subchronic exposure to GBH at the United States permitted glyphosate concentration of 700 μ 
g/L in 
drinking water13. Hepatic histological changes and alterations of clinical biochemistry are detected in rats con-
suming 4.87 mg/kg body weight (bw) glyphosate every 2 days over 75 days14. In farm animals, elevated glyphosate 
urinary levels are correlated with alterations in blood serum parameters indicative of liver and kidney oxidative 
stress and depletion in nutrient trace element levels15.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that most results from these GBH toxicity studies were obtained at doses far 
greater than general human population exposure. Doses tested were typically over the glyphosate acceptable daily 
intake (ADI), which is currently set at 0.3 mg/kg bw/day within the European Union (1.75 mg/kg bw/day in the 
USA) based on hepatorenal toxicity measurements after chronic exposure in rats16,17. However, no long-term 
studies investigating the toxicity of complete GBH commercial formulations, which contain a broad spectrum 
of largely undisclosed “adjuvants” as well as glyphosate, have been conducted (see ref. 9). In an effort to address 
this gap in commercial GBH toxicity evaluation, a 2-year study was conducted where rats were administered 
with a Roundup GBH via drinking water at a concentration of 0.1 ppb (0.05 μ 
g/L glyphosate; daily intake 4 ng/kg 
bw/day), which is an admissible concentration within the European Union (0.1 μ 
g/L) and USA (700 μ 
g/L)18. The 
results showed that Roundup caused an increased incidence in signs of anatomical pathologies, as well as changes 
in urine and blood biochemical parameters suggestive of liver and kidney functional insufficiency18.
Most pesticides exert their toxic effects by targeting proteins and modulating their activity. Herbicides act 
mostly by inhibiting plant enzymes responsible of photosynthesis, carotenoid synthesis, or amino acid synthesis19. 
Besides its well known interaction with EPSPS, it has been suggested that glyphosate could impact mitochondrial 
function by inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase20, or on steroid biosynthesis by inhibiting aromatase enzyme 
activity21. Molecular profiling techniques can be used to identify specific signatures of chemical toxicity and 
thus provide greater insight into organ pathological status22,23. The proteome and metabolome are very sensitive 
to toxic chemical exposures and have been used to reveal non-targets effects of herbicides such as paraquat24, 
atrazine22 and organophosphate mixtures25 in mammalian species. However, while transcriptome profiles reveal 
pathway disturbances that could be correlated to toxic effects, they do not always translate into alterations in 
protein levels and functional, metabolic disturbances. Overall, mRNA transcript abundance explains approxi-
mately one- to two-thirds of the variance in steady-state protein levels26. In yeast subjected to oxidative stress, 
a post-transcriptional regulation of a large fraction of the genes was observed independently of their up- or 
downregulation27.
Given the insight molecular profiling methods can potentially provide into processes and mechanisms of 
toxicity, we have previously conducted a transcriptomics investigation of the same female cohort of animals sub-
jected to ultra-low dose Roundup exposure, and which showed signs of liver and kidney damage at a anato-
morphological and blood/urine biochemical level of function28. Our previous results showed alterations in the 
liver transcriptome reflective of fibrosis, necrosis, phospholipidosis, mitochondrial membrane dysfunction and 
ischemia29. However, as changes in the transcriptome may not fully translate into alterations in organ function, 
we hypothesized that a study of the proteome and metabolome of the same liver tissues will provide confirmation 
of, and possibly a mechanistic link to, the type of liver pathology developed by rats exposed to Roundup. Our 
results show that proteins whose levels were altered were reflective of oxidative stress and changes in fatty acid 
metabolism. Proteome alterations were typical of disturbances measured in cases of peroxisomal proliferation, 
steatosis and necrosis. Metabolome analysis confirmed the induction of oxidative stress, and revealed hallmarks 
of hepatotoxicity. Overall, metabolome and proteome disturbances showed a substantial overlap with biomarkers 
of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and thus confirm metabolic dysfunction resulting from chronic 
exposure to an ultra-low dose of Roundup.
Results
The female rat liver tissues, which formed the starting material for this investigation, were as previously 
described29. They were obtained from animals that formed part of a 2 year study of Roundup toxicity18. Harlan 
Sprague–Dawley rats were administered with Roundup via drinking water at a regulatory admissible dose 
(50 ng/L glyphosate). The average daily intake of Roundup was approximately 4 ng/kg bw/day glyphosate equiv-
alent dose. Control and Roundup-treated animals were respectively euthanized at 701+ 
/− 
 62 and 635+ 
/− 
 131 
days. Anatomopathological analysis of organs from these animals revealed that the liver was the most affected 
organ18. Roundup-treated female rats showed 3 times more anatomical signs of pathology (15 in 8 rats) than the 
control group (6 in 4 rats)18. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein of each rat under short isoflurane 
anesthesia after 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months of treatment. Serum biochemical analysis showed 
increased levels of serum triglycerides (Fig. 1). Thus, although no differences were observed during the first year 
of the experiment, the rats administered with Roundup started progressively to accumulate serum triglycerides 
as they aged.
The proteome discovery study consisted of a comparison between control (n = 
 10) and Roundup treated 
(n = 
 10) rat liver samples. Fractions for both non-enriched peptide and enriched phosphopeptides were analysed 
using Orbitrap Velos-Pro. A total of 1906 peptides were quantified across all liver samples. We began our analysis 
by looking at the variance structure in an unsupervised Principal Component Analysis (PCA). While percent-
ages of explained variance on the 2 first components were low (22.3% and 14.3% respectively), a separation was 
observed between control and Roundup-treated rats (Fig. 2A). Of the 1906 quantifiable peptides taken forward 
for bioanalytical analysis, 214 were respectively found to be significantly regulated (Supplementary Table 3) at 
the cut off Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value (or q-value) of 0.05 with a fold change (FC) of > 
1.2. Figure 2B 
shows the statistical significance of differential protein expression by volcano plot along with their respective FC.
We developed a high throughput Tandem Mass Tag - Selected Reaction Monitoring (TMT-SRM) method to 
verify the alterations observed in protein levels in liver of Roundup-treated rats. The raw discovery LC-MS/MS 
spectra from Orbitrap Velos-Pro were used to select transition ions for each peptide (Fig. 3). First, in order to 
determine a subset of peptides, which can be detected by SRM, individual liver samples marked by a heavy TMT 
were combined with an internal standard constituted by all 20 samples marked by a light TMT. This method 
was repeated 4 times and any peptides/transitions, which were not detected in all 4 repeats removed. A total of 
9 proteins and 10 peptides have been analysed over a 35 minute gradient. Then, 20 combined (TMTLight and 
TMTHeavy) liver samples were analysed on the TSQ Vantage in triplicate, leading to the production of 60 raw

21 and 24 months of treatment. Pair-wise comparisons were performed with a Mann-Whitney U test.

data files. The average CV value between technical repeats was 13.8%. Of the 10 peptides we aimed to quantify, 
5 peptides were successfully detected across all 60 replicates. Several light and heavy transitions co-eluting at the 
same retention time were clearly identified, as illustrated for the peptide ‘ILTFDQLALESPK’ of the 60S ribosomal 
protein L18 (Fig. 4). All of 5 peptides showed a corresponding FC between the two methods (Table 1). The SRM 
data therefore corroborate protein alterations detected in the initial discovery analysis.
In order to obtain insight into the biological significance of the alterations in the proteome profile observed 
between the control and Roundup treatments groups, we next conducted an enrichment analysis integrating 
annotations from KEGG and Gene Ontology (GO) databases using DAVID 6.8 (Supplementary Table 5). The 
most enriched biological process was the response to drug (GO:0042493, FE = 
 6.0, BH corrected p = 
 1.9E−8), 
clearly indicating that the liver proteome of the treated animals are reflective of the treatment with a chemical 
agent (Table 2). Interestingly, the response to organonitrogen compounds (FE = 
 9.9, BH corrected p = 
 4.0E−2) 
was particularly enriched. Since glyphosate is an organonitrogen, this first set of proteins (BHMT, CYP2C7, 
HMGCS1, CYP2E1, MGST1) could constitute a signature of glyphosate metabolic effects. This is consistent with 
the glyphosate metabolic process (GO:0018920), which is defined as a type organonitrogen compound metabolic 
process (GO:1901564) in the GO database. A majority of the enriched terms are related to a modification of 
redox status (GO:0055114, FE = 
 4.9, BH corrected p = 
 2.1E−7). Overall, the proteome is reflective of an oxida-
tive stress response (GO:0006979, FE = 
 8.5, BH corrected p = 
 7.6E−4). The alteration of glutathione metabolism 
(GO:0006749, FE = 21.1, BH corrected p = 1.1E−5) is indicative that the liver of the Roundup treated animals are 
likely to have suffered from an increase in oxidative stress.
A major significant cluster of annotation was related to fatty acid degradation (rno00071, FE = 
 11.5, BH cor-
rected p = 9.1E−5). Of particular note is the modulation of triglyceride metabolism (GO:0006641, FE = 21.4, BH 
corrected p = 
 6.6E−4), which corroborates with the accumulation of serum triglycerides measured in these rats 
(Fig. 1). Another enriched GO term is indicative of the modulation of epoxygenase P450 pathways (GO:0019373, 
FE = 
 27.3, BH corrected p = 
 1.7E−3). Some P450 cytochromes had their levels altered by the Roundup treat-
ment, namely CYP2C12, CYP2C7, CYP2C70, CYP2A1, CYP2D1, CYP2C6v1, CYP2D26 and CYP2E1, with all 
being overexpressed. This reflects a response to a xenobiotic stimulus by the modulation of detoxification path-
ways. The toxicity processes analysis in Metacore (Fig. 5) confirms lipotoxic conditions as revealed by distur-
bances in protein expression associated with the induction of peroxisomal proliferation (n = 
 14, BH corrected 
p = 
 8.8E−7) and steatosis (n = 
 16, BH corrected p = 
 9.1E−5). Collectively, these gene ontology terms are indicative 
of a change in lipid metabolism provoked by intoxication with the Roundup herbicide and imply the development 
of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
We next conducted a metabolome profiling of liver sections from the same animals to further investigate 
for the presence of markers of liver disease. Instrument variability determined by calculating the median rel-
ative standard deviation (RSD) for the internal standards was 6%. Overall process variability determined by 
Figure 3. The raw LC-MS/MS spectra of 60S ribosomal protein L18. The peptide “ILTFDQLALESPK” from

calculating the median RSD for all endogenous metabolites was 12%. In total, 673 compounds were identified 
(Supplementary Table 8). By contrast to the results at the proteome level, the PCA of the metabolome samples 
(Fig. 2A) shows no clear separation of test and control groups. A volcano plot of statistical differences in metab-
olite levels is presented in Fig. 2B. Using the same statistical analytical methods we employed to analyse the 
proteomics dataset with a stringent statistical cut-off threshold (Benjamini Hochberg adjusted p ≤ 
 0.05), only 
3 compounds (namely, N-methyl proline, N-acetyl-beta-alanine, nicotinamide riboside) were found to be sig-
nificantly altered in the Roundup treated verses the control group (Supplementary Table 7). However, the 55 
metabolites having a p-value < 
 0.05 were nevertheless considered for biological interpretation. Although the level 
of statistical significance of these 55 metabolites does not survive the multiple comparison tests, their biological 
interpretation provides a coherent explanation of the treatment effect due to the fact that these statistically signif-
icant differences were not randomly distributed among metabolic pathways but concentrated in those involved in 
the response to oxidative stress and lipotoxic conditions. Statistically significantly altered metabolites had FC val-
ues ranging from − 
2.76 (nicotinamide riboside) to 4.29 (2-hydroxyhippurate). Of the 55 metabolites having their 
levels changed, 12 had FC over 2. (Note: glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine) and its principal metabolite 
aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) were not detected in liver tissue with a limit of detection of 7.8 ppb).
Biochemicals indicative of a change in cellular redox status were markedly disturbed (Table 3; Fig. 6). 
Ophthalmate (FC =

conditions. A depletion of GSH was detected but did not reach statistical significance (FC = 
 − 
1.64, p = 
 0.09). 
Gamma glutamyl dipeptides, indicators of the production of reduced glutathione, are increased in our study. 
Out of 10 gamma glutamyl dipeptides detected, 9 had their levels elevated (3 being significantly increased). 
Remarkably, cysteine levels (used to synthesize glutathione) were depleted (FC = 
 − 
1.2, p = 
 0.07). Furthermore, 
because hypotaurine production is dependent on cysteine levels, its decrease (FC = 
 − 
1.7, p = 
 0.02) suggests a 
redistribution of cellular cysteine stores toward glutathione synthesis that could deplete hypotaurine synthesis by 
substrate attrition. Cellular redox status disturbances are also corroborated by alterations in ascorbate metabolism 
(another intracellular free radical scavenger). Dehydroascorbate, ascorbate and oxalate levels were increased by 
the consumption of Roundup even if these did not reach statistical significance. Altogether, even though statisti-
cal significance was observed in only some cases, alterations in biochemical levels of the two major intracellular 
free radical scavenger systems consistently suggest cellular oxidative stress.
Higher levels of amino acids such as glycine (FC = 
 1.21 p = 
 0.007) and aspartate (FC = 
 1.50 p = 
 0.01), and 
of amino acid catabolites such as 2-aminoadipate (FC = 
 1.39 p = 
 0.01) were observed. In addition, many bio-
chemicals associated with purine and pyrimidine metabolism were elevated, indicating heightened nucleic acid 
turnover. Levels of purine catabolites such as urate and allantoin, or pyrimidine catabolites such as β 
-alanine and 
3-aminoisobutyrate, were either not detected or not altered, suggesting that an elevation in the levels of these 
compounds was indicative of nucleic acid turnover associated with growth rather than nucleic acid breakdown. 
The Roundup treatment group also presented an increased rate of polyamine synthesis, suggesting cell prolifer-
ation and organ regeneration. All of the 4 polyamines detected namely acisoga (FC = 
 1.95, p = 
 0.03), putrescine 
(FC = 1.77, p = 0.03), spermidine (FC = 1.67, p = 0.0005) and 5-methylthioadenosine (FC = 1.78, p = 0.02) were 
statistically significantly increased (Fig. 5). This was accompanied by an increased S-adenosylmethionine (SAM): 
S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratio, a regulator for the synthesis of spermidine. This biochemical signature 
most likely indicates that overall metabolism was higher in Roundup-treated animals.
Additionally, we found metabolite alterations associated hepatotoxicity biomarkers. Levels of proline deriv-
atives were elevated in the liver of Roundup-treated rats (Fig. 5). In particular, N-methylproline a biomarker 
of fibrosis30 whose levels remained significant following multiple comparison adjustment, was increased by 
2.27-fold (p = 
 0.00008) (Fig. 5). We also noticed alterations in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism inter-
mediates. Levels of nicotinamide riboside (FC = − 
2.8, p = 0.0002) and nicotinamide ribonucleotide (FC = − 
2.3, 
p = 
 0.04) were decreased. Hepatic acylcarnitines, reflective of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation impairment, 
were increased. We also observed an increased trend in hepatic accumulation of most medium and long-chain 
fatty acids as well as branched or dicarboxylate fatty acids. Furthermore, cholesterol levels were weakly disturbed 
(FC = 1.16, p = 0.002).
Collectively, alterations of the proteome and the metabolome profiles in the liver of rats chronically receiving 
an environmentally relevant concentration of Roundup in their drinking water show a substantial overlap with 
those characteristic of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Discussion
We report here the first in vivo multiomic analysis combining the proteome and metabolome profiles of the liv-
ers from rats following long-term (2-year) exposure to a GBH (Roundup) at an environmentally relevant dose 
(50 ng/L glyphosate equivalent concentration; 4 ng/kg bw/day). Our integrated analysis of these molecular profiles 
is clearly reflective of features of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progression to non-alcoholic 
steatohepatosis (NASH). Our study thus confirms the increased incidence of liver pathologies in these female rats, 
which was observed at an anatomorphological and blood/urine biochemical level18, and following transcriptome 
analysis29.
NASH results from a two-hit process31. The first hit is a metabolic disruption, marked by a hepatocellular 
accumulation of fatty acids, which then sensitizes the liver to further injury. Steatosis is associated with the accu-
mulation of lipotoxic intermediates such as acylcarnitines. In the liver of rats administered with Roundup, a trend 
in the accumulation of most fatty acids, in particular acylcarnitines, as well as a statistically significant elevation of 
cholesterol levels was observed (Table 3). Proteome profiles further confirmed a marked change in lipid detoxify-
ing metabolic processes (Table 1, Fig. 5). In the pathology of NASH, oxidative stress acts as a second hit31, leading 
to lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage, hepatocellular injury, and finally chronic inflammation and fibrosis. 
Proteome profiles were significantly enriched in features of peroxisomal proliferation, liver steatosis and necrosis. 
An association to features of NASH is further supported by enhancement of markers of oxidative stress and fibro-
sis in the metabolome profile (Fig. 5). The metabolomics analysis also indicates an increased cell proliferation. 
Tissue homeostasis relies on a delicate balance between apoptosis and cellular proliferation. When oxidative stress 
provokes apoptosis, injured cells are generally replaced through increased proliferation.
Our observations may have human health implication since NAFLD is predicted to be the next major global 
epidemic. Approximately 20–30% of the population in the United States carry extra fat in their livers32. NAFLD is 
associated with the recent rapid rise in the incidence of diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome33. Overall, it is 
acknowledged that NAFLD is mostly caused by excess caloric intake, but also from the consumption of processed 
foods, which increases simple sugar and saturated fat ingestion as well as sedentary lifestyles34,35. However, many 
suffer from NAFLD but which do not have any high risk factors and thus other contributors to disease, such as 
exposure to physiologically active environmental pollutants via contaminated food, cannot be excluded. Recently, 
some endocrine disrupting chemicals have been implicated in the aetiology of metabolic syndrome. Commonly 
defined as obesogens, some environmental chemicals have been found to promote adipose cell differentiation and 
lipid storage in experimental animals and thus presumably also in humans36.
We detected metabolic alterations well below the glyphosate ADI (0.3 mg/kg bw/day) set within the European 
Union, and is within the range admitted in drinking water (0.1 ppb) and foodstuffs (for example, 20 ppm in 
soybeans or 2 ppm in bovine kidneys). However, inter-species biological relevance still needs to be ascertained

because there is a lack of data pertaining to biological effects of glyphosate in human tissues at these levels to 
support or contradict our data.
The Roundup-induced liver pathologies confirmed in this report may arise from multiple sources as there is 
increasing evidence to suggest that GBHs and glyphosate can bring about toxic effects via different mechanisms, 
depending upon the level of exposure. Glyphosate has been suggested to act as an estrogen agonist based on 
assays in cultures of human breast cancer cells at comparable concentrations to the native hormone37,38. Other 
studies, albeit at much higher doses, have also shown that glyphosate can uncouple liver mitochondrial oxidative 
phosphorylation10. Glyphosate is also a patented antibiotic (Patent No.: US 7771736) and can inhibit the growth 
of susceptible bacteria by inhibition of the shikimate pathway and could cause dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal 
tract39. Additionally, because glyphosate herbicidal action results from competition for phosphoenolpyruvate 
(PEP) in plants, it is possible that similar effects are being exerted by this compound on other PEP utilizing 
enzymes including those in mammals. This could explain the effects of glyphosate on the activity of some TCA 
cycle enzymes observed in this study (Supplementary Table 3). In this regard the fact that glyphosate has been 
shown to interact with mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)20 is noteworthy. We hypothesize that 
glyphosate could interfere at multiple points within the TCA cycle by inhibiting enzymes having oxoacids as 
substrates.
One of the problems with the statistical analysis of the metabolome data we encountered was the lack of 
statistical significance following multiple comparison correction for all but three metabolites. However, the 
need for appropriate p-value adjustments is an important consideration to extract meaningful results from 
high-throughput experiments as conducted in this study40. Corrections for multiple comparisons reduce the 
chance of making type I errors (false positives) by increasing the chance of making type II errors (false negatives). 
In the case of metabolome data, p-value adjustments are calculated based on the number of metabolites detected 
in the experiment. Therefore, some biologically relevant biomarkers can have their statistical significance masked 
by the detection of a high number of unrelated metabolites as is the case in the study we present here. Overall, 
statistical significance should not be disconnected with biological interpretations but should also be balanced 
with the magnitude of the effect, the quality of the study and with findings from other studies40.
Although our results cannot provide insight into the mechanisms of the pathologies resulting from chronic 
very low–dose glyphosate exposure, they highlight the need for future GBH toxicity studies where organ molec-
ular profiles are determined prior to appearance of the overt pathologies observed at late-stage termination as in 
this instance. Indeed, the use of aged animals may have enhanced variability. Additionally, differences in metab-
olite levels between individual animals within a group were greater than the effect of Roundup in some cases, 
which resulted in a lack of statistical power to survive multiple correction tests. However, in certain cases such 
as elevation in N-methylproline (Fig. 6), a biomarker of liver fibrosis30, remained statistically significant after 
multiple comparison adjustment. In addition, the non-adjusted statistically significant different changes in levels 
of metabolites such as trans-4-hydroxyproline and pro-hydroxy-pro were found to be non-random and thus bio-
logically meaningful, and found to cluster in metabolic networks related to oxidative stress metabolism (Fig. 6). 
Nevertheless, larger cohorts would be needed to reach the statistical power required to reduce false discovery 
rates and increase the confidence in the conclusiveness of the small fold changes observed here. We emphasize 
that although the amplitude of the changes of certain metabolites was low, it is known that small changes over a 
long period of time can have major health consequences. For example, a 25% increase in serum HDL cholesterol 
levels is associated with reduced risk of death from ischaemic heart disease41.
An important consideration is that Roundup is not a single compound, but a mixture of an active ingredient 
(glyphosate) combined with various adjuvants, which are required to stabilise and allow penetration of glyphosate 
into plants. In short term acute exposures, some adjuvants can be considered as responsible of Roundup toxic-
ity42. Populations of farmers exposed to adjuvants, such as solvents or petroleum distillates, possess a higher risk 
of developing hypospadias43 and present with more allergic and non-allergic wheeze conditions44. However, as 
adjuvant composition is proprietary and not fully disclosed, it is not possible to attribute the toxicity of the whole 
agricultural herbicide formulation to a given component. Future studies involving the administration of glypho-
sate alone would shed light on this issue.

Conclusions
The results of the study presented here imply that chronic consumption of extremely low levels of a GBH formu-
lation (Roundup), at admissible glyphosate-equivalent concentrations, are associated with marked alterations of 
the liver proteome and metabolome. These changes in molecular profile overlap substantially with biomarkers of 
NAFLD and its progression to NASH. These alterations correlate with the observed signs of hepatic anatomor-
phological and biochemical pathological changes in this organ18, and as suggested by transcriptome profiling29. 
Confirmatory studies incorporating testing principles from endocrinology should be performed to investigate 
potential implications of GBH low dose exposure in the development of metabolic syndrome.
Methods
Experimental design. 
The rat tissues analysed in this study were obtained from animals as previously 
described18. Briefly, the experimental protocol was as follows. Following 20 days of acclimatization, Harlan 
Sprague-Dawley rats at 5 weeks of age were randomly assigned on a weight basis into groups of 10 animals. 
Animals were fed with the standard diet A04 (Safe, France) including 33% maize DKC 2675 over two years. All

female rats. Levels of each metabolite from the metabolomics of livers from female rats receiving the herbicide 
Roundup in their drinking water (R) were subjected to a statistical analysis by comparison to controls (C) using 
a Mann-Whitney U test. A selection of metabolites showing a statistically significant increase (dark red) or 
decrease (dark green) and which are of potential biological relevance are shown. Some metabolites approaching 
the level of significance (p < 0.1) are shown by light red and light green frames.

feed formulations consisted of a balanced diet, chemically measured as substantially equivalent. All animals 
were kept in polycarbonate cages (820 cm2, Genestil, France). The location of each cage within the experimen-
tal room was regularly changed. The litter (Toplit classic, Safe, France) was replaced twice weekly. The animals 
were maintained at 22 ± 
 3 °C under controlled humidity (45% to 65%) and air purity with a 12 h-light/dark 
cycle, with free access to food and water. All reagents used were of analytical grade. The animal experimen-
tal protocol was conducted in accordance with the regulations of the local ethics committee in an animal 
care unit authorized by the French Ministries of Agriculture and Research (Agreement Number A35-288-1). 
Animal experiments were performed according to ethical guidelines of animal experimentation (regulation 
CEE 86/609).
Groups of 10 animals had access to either plain water (control) or to the same water supplemented with 
1.1 × 
 10−8% of Roundup (0.1 ppb or 0.05 μ 
g/L glyphosate equivalent dilution). The commercial formulation 
of Roundup used was Grand Travaux Plus (450 g/L glyphosate, approval 2020448; Monsanto, Belgium). The 
required level of Roundup dilution in drinking water was confirmed by measurement of glyphosate concentration 
by HPLC-MS/MS. Similarly, glyphosate stability in solution was studied and validated during the 7 day period 
between two preparations of the test treatment solutions.
Triglycerides were quantified by the enzymatic reactions of Fossati and Trinder45. The procedure measures 
the concentrations of total triglycerides by converting them to glycerol and free fatty acids by lipase. The glycerol 
is then converted to glycerol-3-phosphate and finally to hydrogen peroxide. A colored complex is formed from 
hydrogen peroxide, 4-aminophenazone and 4-chlorophenol via an enzymatic reaction with a peroxidase. The 
absorbance of the complex is measured at 510 nm.
Tissue sampling. 
Animals were sacrificed at the same time of day during the course of the study either to 
comply with animal welfare regulations to avoid unnecessary suffering (for example, resulting from 25% body 
weight loss, presence of tumours over 25% bodyweight, hemorrhagic bleeding, or prostration) or at the termina-
tion of the study period of 2 years. Animals were sacrificed by exsanguination under isoflurane anesthesia. Livers 
were divided in two and half snap frozen in liquid nitrogen/dry ice and stored at − 
80 °C.
Proteome profiling using Tandem Mass Tag-LC-MS/MS. 
Transverse cross sectional slices of liver were 
lysed in 8 M lysis buffer (urea, NaCl, Tri-HCl, dH2O, phosphatase and protease inhibitor) and the protein con-
centration of the resulting homogenate calculated using a Nanodrop protein assay (used on the A280 setting). 
Samples were reduced with 5 mM dithiotreitol (Sigma, UK), alkylated by treatment with 14 mM iodoacetamide 
(Sigma) and digested with 12 μ 
g bovine sequencing grade trypsin (Roche, Germany, Ref. 11418475001) at 37 °C 
for 18 hours. Subsequently, peptides were purified and extracted using Waters Sep-Pak Vac 3cc 200 mg tC18 
cartridges (Waters, WAT054925) in accordance to with the manufacturer’s instructions before each sample was 
labelled by incubation with 60 mM TMT10plex Isobaric Label Reagents (Thermo-Scientific, ref 90406). Labelled 
peptides were then purified and extracted again with the Waters Sep-Pak Vac 3cc 200 mg tC18 cartridge, before 
being fractionated by strong cation exchange (SCX) across an increasing salt concentration using elution buffers 
containing different concentrations of KCl: ranging from 0 mM KCl in the first fraction to 350 mM KCl in the 
10th fraction. A 1/10th aliquot of the eluted peptide fractions were separated and lyophilised for direct analysis 
by LC-MS/MS. The remaining 9/10th of column eluate was enriched for phosphopeptides using a Pierce TiO2 
Phosphopeptide Enrichment and Clean-up Kit (Pierce, Prod # 88301).
Un-enriched samples were re-suspended in 100 μ 
l of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and F1&6, F2&7, F3&8, 
F4&9 and F5&10 pooled to give 5 fractions. Phosphopeptide enriched samples were re-suspended in 30 μ 
l 50 mM 
ammonium bicarbonate and pooled in the same way as the un-enriched samples to also give 5 fractions. Both 
enriched (8 μ 
l) and un-enriched (5 μ 
l) fractions were loaded onto a 50 cm EASY-spray column (Thermo Scientific) 
and quantitative analysis was performed using the Orbitrap Velos-Pro mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) in 
positive ion mode. The peptides and phosphopeptides were separated by gradient elution, from 5–80% 0.1% 
trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (5–40% from 0–100 minutes, 40–80% from 100–110 minutes), at a flow rate of 
300 nl/min. Mass spectra (m/z) ranging from 400–1600 Daltons was acquired at a resolution of 60,000 and the 10 
most intense ions were subjected to MS/MS by HCD fragmentation with 35% collision energy.
Protein identification was performed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Raw files 
were imported and searched against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Database using Sequest for Proteome Discoverer. 
Exported raw data for the two TMT10plex sets is available as Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Raw files for both 
enriched and un-enriched fractions were merged together in a single file search for each of the two TMT10plex 
sets. Precursor mass tolerance for the searches was set at 20ppm and fragment mass tolerance at 0.8ppm. The 
taxonomy selected was Rattus norvegicus and three enzymatic miscleavages were allowed. Dynamic modifica-
tions selected on the search were Oxidation/+ 
15.995 Da (M), Phospho/+ 
79.966 Da (S, T, Y) and Deamidated/+ 
0.984 (N, Q) and static modifications were Carbamidomethyl/+ 
57.021 Da (C), TMT10plex/229.163 Da (K), 
TMT10plex/229.163 Da (Any N-terminus).
Proteome verification using Tandem Mass Tag - selected reaction monitoring experi-
ment. 
Samples were prepared in the same way as the discovery experiment up to the TMT labelling stage. For 
selected reaction monitoring (SRM) analysis the twenty individually TMT10plex Heavy labelled samples were not 
combined but analysed individually against a pool of the twenty liver samples labelled with TMTZero/Light Label 
Reagent (Thermo-Scientific) included as a single point reference sample. All labelled peptides were purified and 
extracted before being lyophilised prior to mass spectrometry analysis.
Peptides were selected for TMT-SRM verification based on findings from the discovery analysis. Peptides 
chosen were significantly regulated against parameters where peptides had to display a fold change ≥ 
1.2, either

up or down-regulated, whilst being significant to a p-value of ≤ 
0.01. Peptides were re-solubilised in 2% acetoni-
trile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 2.5 μ 
g of protein loaded onto a 50 cm EASY-Spray column (Thermo Scientific) 
using initial gradient conditions identical to those used in the discovery experiment. The LC system was coupled 
to a TSQ Vantage mass spectrometer (Thermo-Scientific) set in positive ion mode with Q1 and Q3 peak width 
settings of 1 full width at half its maximum height (FWHM). Capillary temperature (°C), collision gas pressure 
(mTorr) and spray voltage (V) were set at 270, 1.2 and 1800 respectively. In order to asses peptide transition spec-
ificity and abundance and define retention times, initial optimisation was performed using the reference sample 
alone. Following this a combined 1:1 mix with a random Heavy TMT labelled sample was then measured. The 
final method contained all successful transitions for both TMT Heavy and TMT Light versions of the peptides 
(Supplementary Table 4; 68 transitions from 10 peptides and 9 proteins). This final method was applied in three 
separate injections to each Heavy labelled experimental sample, which had been mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the 
Light labelled reference sample. Peptides were separated over 35 minutes, using gradient elution 5–80% 0.1% 
trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (0–5% from 0–3 minutes, 5–50% from 3–7 minutes, 50–65% from 7–30 minutes 
and 65–80% from 30–35 minutes) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min.
Data was analysed using Skyline software46, with all peak matching also being visually verified. Peak area ratios 
between Light and Heavy transitions were generated for each sample and exported into Excel. When importing 
raw SRM data files from the TSQ vantage into Skyline software, a unique peak picking algorithm was used to 
confidently and accurately assign the best transition peaks for each peptide. Peptides were only taken forward for 
analysis if all assigned peaks were within a similar retention time period across all 60 samples. From the assigned 
peaks Skyline software was then used to produce a ‘total ratio’ between the Light and Heavy transitions for all 
of the 60 raw data files (3 × 
 10 control sample injection and 3 × 
 10 treated sample injections). This ‘total ratio’ 
value is a mean of the transition ratios, where the ratio is the comparison of the heavy transition peak areas to the 
light transition peak areas. The total ratio was averaged across all control and treated samples and a fold change 
between the two calculated. Coefficient of variation (CV) values between technical sample repeats were calculated 
and also averaged across control and treatment samples. Any peptides which displayed an average technical CV 
value higher than 15% were excluded from further analysis.
Metabolome analysis. 
Semiquantitative metabolomics analysis was performed by ultra-high performance 
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy 
(GC-MS) at Metabolon Inc. (Durham, NC, USA)47.
Samples were prepared using the automated MicroLab STAR® 
 system from Hamilton Company (Reno, NV, 
USA). A recovery standard was added prior to the first step in the extraction process for QC purposes. In order 
to remove protein, dissociate small molecules bound to protein or trapped in the precipitated protein matrix, 
and to recover chemically diverse metabolites, proteins were precipitated with methanol under vigorous shaking 
for 2 min (Glen Mills GenoGrinder, 2000) followed by centrifugation. The resulting extract was divided into five 
fractions: one for analysis by UPLC-MS/MS with positive ion mode electrospray ionization, one for analysis by 
UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion mode electrospray ionization, one for LC polar platform, one for analysis by 
GC-MS, and one sample was reserved for backup. Samples were placed briefly on a TurboVap® 
 (SOTAX Corp, 
Westborough, MA, USA) to remove the organic solvent. For LC, the samples were stored overnight under nitro-
gen before preparation for analysis. For GC, each sample was dried under vacuum overnight before preparation 
for analysis.
The LC-MS portion of the platform was based on a Waters ACQUITY ultra-performance liquid chromatogra-
phy (UPLC) system (Waters Corp, Milford, MA, USA) and a ThermoFisher Scientific Q-Exactive high resolution/
accurate mass orbitrap mass spectrometer operated at a 35,000 mass resolution, which was interfaced with a 
heated electrospray ionization (HESI) source. The sample extract was dried then reconstituted in acidic or basic 
LC-compatible solvents, each of which contained 12 or more injection standards at fixed concentrations to ensure 
injection and chromatographic consistency. One aliquot was analyzed using acidic positive ion-optimized condi-
tions and the other using basic negative ion-optimized conditions in two independent injections using separate 
dedicated columns (Waters UPLC BEH C18-2.1 × 
 100 mm, 1.7 μ 
m). Extracts reconstituted in acidic conditions 
were gradient eluted using water and methanol containing 0.1% formic acid, while the basic extracts, which also 
used water/methanol, contained 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate. A third aliquot was analyzed via negative ioni-
zation following elution from a HILIC column (Waters UPLC BEH Amide 2.1 × 
 150 mm, 1.7 μ 
m) using a gradient 
consisting of water and acetonitrile with 10 mM ammonium formate. The MS analysis alternated between MS and 
data-dependent MS/MS scans using dynamic exclusion and the scan range was from 80–1000 m/z.
The samples destined for analysis by GC-MS were dried under vacuum for a minimum of 18 h prior to being 
derivatized under dried nitrogen using bistrimethyl-silyltrifluoroacetamide. Derivatized samples were separated 
on a 5% diphenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane fused silica column (20 m × 
 0.18 mm ID; 0.18 μ 
m film thickness) 
with helium as carrier gas and a temperature ramp from 60° to 340 °C in a 17.5 minute period. Samples were 
analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole mass spectrometer using electron 
impact ionization (EI) and operated at unit mass resolving power. The scan range was from 50–750 m/z.
Bioinformatics analysis. 
For the proteome, only peptides with TMT reporter ion signal intensities for all 
ten samples were used for further bioinformatics analysis. Any duplicate peptides were removed before the data 
was SumScale normalised. The two normalised data files were then merged together to give one 10vs10 file com-
parison. Any peptides which did not have intensity values in all twenty TMT reporter ion channels were filtered 
out and median values were taken of the control and treated samples respectively. A total of 1906 peptides were 
quantified across all liver samples.

For the metabolome, raw data was extracted, peak-identified and QC processed using Metabolon’s hardware 
and software. Raw data is available as Supplementary Table 6. Metabolites were identified by automated com-
parison of the ion features in the experimental samples against a reference library of more than 3000 purified 
standard compounds that included retention time/index (RI), mass to charge ratio (m/z), and chromatographic 
data (including MS/MS spectral data), and then curated by visual inspection for quality control using software 
developed at Metabolon48. Peaks were quantified using area-under-the-curve. A total of 673 metabolites were 
detected. The maximum percent missing data allowed was 20%. As a result, 602 metabolites were taken forward 
for bioanalytical analysis.
The language and statistical environment R49 together with the ade4 package50 method was employed in 
order to explore the relationship between the control and the treated samples. We regressed out the batch effects 
between TMT1 and TMT2 from the protein expression data, and to correct variation resulting from instrument 
inter-day tuning differences for the metabolome data, using the limma package removeBatchEffect51. For plotting 
of results, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was first performed. Missing data was imputed by the value 
of the median of the group for a given metabolite in order to perform the PCA analysis. A previous evaluation of 
different fold change (FC) rules have found that a 1.2-fold change could be regarded as indicative of a significantly 
varying protein in TMT-LC-MS/MS experiments52. Data used for the functional analysis were selected at the cut 
off values of q < 
 0.05 (p < 
 0.005) with FC > 
 1.2. Pairwise non-parametric Mann–Whitney U tests were performed 
and a p-value was attributed to each of the 1906 peptides and the 602 metabolites. The resulting p-values were 
adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg multi-test adjustment method for a high number of comparisons. Volcano 
plots were also constructed in order to visualize the differences in metabolite and protein expression for each of 
the comparisons. The aforementioned tests and plots were performed using in-house R scripts. The pathway anal-
ysis was done using the Thomson Reuters MetaCore Analytical Suite and/or the NIH Database for Annotation, 
Visualization and Integrated Discovery Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (DAVID) using recommended analytical 
parameters53.
