Background. Youths with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) experience severe distress
and impaired functioning at school and at home. Critical cognitive domains for daily func-
tioning and academic success are learning, memory, cognitive flexibility and goal-directed
behavioural control. Performance in these important domains among teenagers with OCD
was therefore investigated in this study.
Methods. A total of 36 youths with OCD and 36 healthy comparison subjects completed two
memory tasks: Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM) and Paired Associates Learning (PAL); as
well as the Intra-Extra Dimensional Set Shift (IED) task to quantitatively gauge learning as
well as cognitive flexibility. A subset of 30 participants of each group also completed a
Differential-Outcome Effect (DOE) task followed by a Slips-of-Action Task, designed to assess
the balance of goal-directed and habitual behavioural control.
Results. Adolescent OCD patients showed a significant learning and memory impairment.
Compared with healthy comparison subjects, they made more errors on PRM and PAL
and in the first stages of IED involving discrimination and reversal learning. Patients were
also slower to learn about contingencies in the DOE task and were less sensitive to outcome
devaluation, suggesting an impairment in goal-directed control.
Conclusions. This study advances the characterization of juvenile OCD. Patients demonstrated
impairments in all learning and memory tasks. We also provide the first experimental evidence
of impaired goal-directed control and lack of cognitive plasticity early in the development of
OCD. The extent to which the impairments in these cognitive domains impact academic
performance and symptom development warrants further investigation.
Introduction
Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adolescents is a distressing condition,
which is often chronic and persists into adulthood (Micali et al. 2010). Almost 90% of these
young patients have problems at school, home or socially; with difficulties doing homework
and concentrating at school being the two most common problems (Piacentini et al. 2003).
It is key that we identify and address underlying issues early to aid treatment and help patients
to reach their full potential in life. Several cognitive domains are important for daily function-
ing and educational success. School performance has been shown to relate to memory capacity
(Gathercole & Pickering, 2000; Gathercole et al. 2004), independent of socio-economic back-
ground (Engel de Abreu et al. 2014). In addition, cognitive flexibility has been shown to be
important for academic success, especially for math and reading skills (Yeniad et al. 2013).
Finally, an intact balance between goal-directed and habitual control is crucial for daily func-
tioning. Stimulus–response (S-R) habits are thought to be mediated by direct S-R associations,
which renders them efficient but also inflexible. Goal-directed action control, on the other
hand, allows us to base our actions on the value of the anticipated outcome and to flexibly
adjust our actions when the outcome is no longer desirable (de Wit & Dickinson, 2009).
Impairments in these domains could have serious widespread consequences, especially in
young, still developing individuals.
Deficits in memory, cognitive flexibility and goal-directed control have been identified in
adult OCD (Purcell et al. 1998; Gillan et al. 2011; Abramovitch et al. 2013). In particular,
impaired goal-directed control is one of the hallmarks of adult OCD (Gillan et al. 2011).
The inability to stop a compulsion (such as excessive hand washing) despite negative

 consequences (like the development of painful skin condition or
inability to work/study due to the time spent washing) can be
interpreted as impaired goal-directed action control. Indeed, it
has been proposed that a shift in the balance between flexible,
goal-directed control and S-R habitual control plays an important
role in the development of compulsions (Gillan & Robbins, 2014).
However, these impairments remain poorly investigated in
adolescent OCD. Findings from adult patients do not necessarily
apply to younger ones, given that there are important differences
between adult and adolescent OCD, such as gender distribution
(Geller et al. 2001), degree of insight (Storch et al. 2008) and
genetic influence (van Grootheest et al. 2005).
The few neuropsychological studies in youths with OCD
have yielded inconsistent results (Abramovitch et al. 2015).
Visuospatial memory has been found to be impaired among juvenile
patients in some (Andrés et al. 2007; Chang et al. 2007; Lewin et al.
2014) but not in other studies (Shin et al. 2008; Zandt et al. 2009;
Ornstein et al. 2010; Geller et al. 2017; Hybel et al. 2017). For cogni-
tive flexibility and set shifting, some studies have shown impairments
in youths with OCD (Andrés et al. 2007; Shin et al. 2008; Isik Taner
et al. 2011; Gruner et al. 2012), while others found no deficits (Beers
et al. 1999; Ornstein et al. 2010; Kodaira et al. 2012; Hybel et al.
2017). To our knowledge, no study has yet investigated the relative
balance of goal-directed and habitual control in youths with OCD.
Previous studies often involved small sample sizes. For
example, Chang et al. (2007) tested 16 OCD patients and com-
pared them with 15 healthy controls and 15 patients with
Tourette’s syndrome. Rubia et al. included only male subjects:
10 with OCD, 18 with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) and 20 healthy boys (Rubia et al. 2011). Shin et al.
(2008) compared 17 OCD patients to 18 healthy volunteers,
while Britton et al. (2010) administered tasks to 15 OCD patients
and 20 healthy controls. Another limitation of previous studies is
the inclusion of patients with comorbidities. While it has been
reported that around half of youth with OCD fulfil criteria for
anxiety or depressive disorder, with another 16% suffering from
externalizing disorders (Peris et al. 2017), previous studies have
tested patients with a wide range of comorbidities, including
depression, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress
disorder, specific or social phobia, separation anxiety disorders,
ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder and Tourette’s syndrome
(Chang et al. 2007; Britton et al. 2010; Huyser et al. 2010;
Ornstein et al. 2010; Gruner et al. 2012; Kodaira et al. 2012;
Lewin et al. 2014; Geller et al. 2017). Though some of these
disorders might share overlapping impairments, the different
profiles of comorbidities add to the heterogeneity of the
samples. Finally, many studies used non-computerized tasks,
which heavily rely on the interaction of participants and experi-
menters. These characteristics add unnecessary variability to the
data set, which might partially explain why the findings thus far
have been so inconsistent. We therefore aimed to assess learning,
memory and cognitive flexibility rigorously with extensively
validated, computerized tests from the CANTAB (Cambridge
Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery) in a larger sample
free from comorbid disorders. In addition, the balance between
goal-directed and habitual control was assessed with a newly
developed instrumental discrimination learning task. The ability
to learn about the consequences of actions was studied by com-
paring acquisition of (‘differential outcomes’, DOs) discrimina-
tions that could be supported by (stimulus–outcome–response,
S-O-R) learning about unique outcomes v. (‘common outcomes’,
COs) discriminations that could only be learned by relying on
direct S-R associations. Subsequently, we assessed participants’
ability to flexibly adjust their performance to changes in outcome
value in a Slips-of-Action Test (SOAT) (de Wit et al. 2012).
Methods and materials
Participants
Thirty-six participants diagnosed with OCD (69% female) were
recruited from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services,
through independent charities, and adverts on social media.
Patients were screened by an experienced psychiatrist in an
extended
clinical
interview
supplemented
by
the
Mini
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI for participants
over 18, MINI-KID for participants under 18; Sheehan et al.
1998, 2010) to ensure that they met Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision
(DSM-IV-TR) criteria for OCD and were free of co-morbid
Axis-I disorders. A total of 67 patients was screened, of which 31
had to be excluded due to comorbidities. Of the final 36 subjects,
23 patients were prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors:
one took citalopram (20 mg), eight fluoxetine (range 7.5–60 mg),
14 sertraline (50–200 mg); two patients were also on circadin
(4 and 6 mg) and one was also on pregabalin (150 mg).
Control subjects (n = 36, 69% female) were recruited through
local adverts and screened for psychiatric disorders using the
age-appropriate version of the MINI (see above) by the same clin-
ician as the patients. All participants were between 12 and 19
years old, fluent in English, and reported no history of psychiatric
or neurological disorder or brain injury. The study was approved
by the East of England – Essex Research Ethics Committee (REC
10/H0301/49). It was also adopted by the NIHR Clinical Research
Network (CRN) Portfolio (9532) and the study information was
publicly available on the UK CRN Portfolio website. All volunteers
gave written informed consent before beginning the testing and
received monetary compensation for their participation. For parti-
cipants under 16 years, parental written consent was also obtained.
Clinical assessment
Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory for Youth
and Beck Anxiety Inventory for Youth from the Beck Youth
Inventories Second Edition (Beck et al. 2005). Self-reported obses-
sive–compulsive
symptomatology
was
assessed
with
the
Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory Revised (Foa et al. 2002) and in
patients additionally with the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive
Compulsive Scale (Scahill et al. 1997).
Neuropsychological measures
Participants completed two subtests (vocabulary and matrix rea-
soning) of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence
(Wechsler, 1999) and the following three CANTAB tasks: Pattern
Recognition Memory (PRM) assessing visual pattern recognition
(Sahakian et al. 1988), Paired Associates Learning (PAL) in high
functioning mode (up to 12 patterns) testing visuospatial learning
(assessed by total errors made) and memory (measured as first
trial memory score; Sahakian et al. 1988), and Intra-Extra
Dimensional Set Shift (IED) measuring discrimination learning
and set formation [stages before the extradimensional shift
(EDS)] as well as cognitive flexibility, measured at the extradimen-
sional shift stage (Downes et al. 1989). Subjects also completed a

ing and goal-directed v. habitual control.
Differential-Outcome Effect task followed by SOAT (for a
detailed task description, see online Supplemental Material). At
the start of this four-stage task, participants were informed that
they were to play a game in which they could earn vouchers for
six different rewards by defeating eight different monsters (pic-
tures on the screen that served as the discriminative stimuli).
They were told that the person who would collect the most vou-
chers would be given £15 at the end of the study. Participants
chose their preferred six rewards from 13 different rewards,
each worth about £15 (cinema voucher, sports equipment, acces-
sory gift card, McDonald’s gift card, portable phone charger, hair
straightener,
magazine
subscription,
cosmetics,
headphones,
Starbucks gift card, clothes shop gift card, phone case and
HMV gift card). The six chosen rewards were subsequently incor-
porated into the game.
Stage 1: Pavlovian training
In order to establish strong stimulus–outcome (S-O) associations
between the discriminative stimuli and instrumental outcomes,
participants first received Pavlovian training. They passively
observed the relationships between the eight (discriminative)
stimuli and six rewards. Four monsters were each paired with a
unique outcome (DO stimuli: S1-O1; S2-O2; S3-O3; S4-O4),
while the remaining four stimuli formed two pairs where each
was associated with a CO (CO stimuli: e.g. S5-O5; S6-O5;
S7-O6; S8-O6).
Stage 2: Instrumental discrimination training
At the start of training, participants were instructed that they
could defeat the different monsters by pressing either the right
or the left arrow key on the keyboard. The four CO and four
DO monsters functioned as discriminative stimuli, with half sig-
nalling that the left key was correct and the other half the right
key. Participants could learn by trial and error to press the correct
key. The stimuli were still associated with the same outcomes as
during the Pavlovian training (S1:right → DO1; S2:left → DO2;
S3:right → DO3; S4:left → DO4; S5:right → CO5; S6:left → CO5;
S7:right → CO6; S8:left → CO6). Performance was separately
assessed on the DO and the CO trials, to allow us to compare
learning rates. Previous studies have shown that animals and
humans acquire the DO discriminations faster than the CO dis-
criminations (Trapold, 1970; Estevez et al. 2001). This ‘DO effect’
(DOE) is generally believed to reflect the usage of the differential
properties of outcomes to aid learning of the DO discriminations
(Trapold, 1970). In contrast, in the CO discrimination, each out-
come should become associated with both the left and right
response, and it should therefore rely on relatively slow S-R habit
learning. Consequently, a general reliance on habitual control – at
the expense of goal-directed control – should be reflected in a
reduced DOE. The associative structures are illustrated in Fig. 1.
Stage 3: SOAT and Baseline test
The speeded SOAT and Baseline test were conducted in counter-
balanced order in each group. During the SOAT, each block
started with 10-s ‘instructed devaluation’ screen showing all six
outcomes, but with a cross superimposed on either two DOs
(one for a right response and one for a left) or on one CO to indi-
cate that these outcomes were devalued, and that participants
should therefore refrain from responding for these. Participants
were instructed that they would be shown the eight monster
stimuli in quick succession, and that they should withhold their
learnt responses for the devalued outcomes, while pressing for
the still-valuable outcomes. Thus, participants were required to
withhold their responses to two discriminative monster stimuli,
while continuing to press for the other six stimuli.
The baseline test was identical except that the monster stimuli
were initially shown to be devalued (‘disarmed’) rather than the
outcomes. During each block, two stimuli were devalued: either
two CO or two DO stimuli, but always where one had signalled
a right and one a left response. This test should impose similar
working memory and response inhibition demands, but does
not require evaluation of an anticipated outcome.
Stage 4: Choice test of R-O knowledge
During this self-paced instructed outcome-devaluation test, each
trial showed a pair of DOs: one previously earned by a right
response and one by a left response. One of the two outcomes
was
devalued
as
signalled
by a
superimposed
red
cross.
Participants were instructed to press the key that previously
earned the still-valuable outcome. This test assessed participants’
ability to base choices between the outcomes on their memory of
the R-O contingencies
Data analysis
Data were analysed in SPSS version 21 and R version 3.3.3.
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was carried out using multiple
linear regression to test for between-group differences, with age
and gender as covariates. In addition, a between-subject factor
was used when appropriate to assess the effect of task difficulty
or level. When the homogeneity of variances assumption was
not met, a Welch correction was used. When the assumption of
sphericity was violated for analyses involving repeated measures,
the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used. To assess the
memory demand of the DOE task, a priori Pearson correlation
coefficients were calculated for difference scores (per cent
responses to still-valuable stimuli minus per cent responses to
devalued stimuli), PAL and PRM performance. Data were ana-
lysed for 36 OCD patients and 36 healthy control participants
for PRM immediate recall, PAL and IED. 30 participants in
each group completed the PRM with a 20 min delayed recall
and the DOE task, as these tasks were added at a later point in
the study. One subject did not complete the choice test of R-O
knowledge of the DOE task.
Results
Clinical and psychological scales
The demographic and clinical assessment data are shown in
Table 1. OCD patients and healthy comparison subjects were
well matched for age, gender and IQ. The mean Children’s
Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale was 25.1 (S.D. = 5.0,
range 15–34). Patients had worse symptoms of OCD, depression
and anxiety, though none of the participants fulfilled clinical cri-
teria for depression or anxiety disorder.

 fewer patterns correctly in both immediate and delayed recall
(both p < 0.001) even accounting for age and gender, while they
were also slower to respond in immediate ( p = 0.003), but not
delayed recall ( p = 0.374).
Young OCD patients also showed impairments on the PAL
task: they had a significantly lower first trial memory score and
made more errors in total, even when age and gender were con-
trolled for. Planned post hoc comparisons, again adjusted for age
and gender, showed a significant main effect of difficulty (F4,254
=3.567, p = 0.0075) and a significant interaction between group
and task difficulty (F4,254 = 59.081, p < 0.001). Specifically, OCD
patients made significantly more errors than controls at the
more difficult 6, 8 and 12 pattern stages (F1,50.4 = 12.947, p <
0.001; F1,57.8 = 5.351, p = 0.024 and F1,55.3 = 9.376, p = 0.003,
respectively).
The analysis of learning curves at the eight- and 12-shape stage
of the task revealed a significant interaction between trial and
group
(F1,2.0 = 4.754,
p = 0.011
and
F1,2.2 = 4.269,
p = 0.013,
respectively; for description of learning curves see Sahakian
et al. 1988). While all participants eventually identified all
patterns correctly, the OCD patients took more trials to do so.
On the IED task, patients made significantly more errors in the
stages before the extradimensional shift ( p < 0.05). In contrast,
patients and controls did not differ from each other at the extra-
dimensional shift stage.
DOE and SOAT
The main results are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 3. Data were
analysed using a repeated measures approach, where the effect of
discrimination was treated as a within-subject factor, and group
as a between-subjects factor. During the first half of instrumental
training, there was a significant interaction of discrimination
(DO, CO) and group (OCD, controls; F1,58 = 5.236, p = 0.026).
Post hoc analysis revealed that controls showed a DOE and learned
better about DOs than COs (F1,29 = 12.115, p = 0.002), while
OCD patients did not (F1,29 = 0.002, p = 0.961). OCD patients
had lower average response accuracies for DOs (F1,58 = 5.659, p =
0.021), but not COs compared with controls (F1,58 = 1.141, p =
0.290). Follow-up analyses showed that this effect was driven by
the first stages of the training: response accuracies for DOs were
significantly different between groups in the first half of the
training (F1,58 = 5.856, p = 0.019), but not during the second
half (F1,42.2 = 3.858, p = 0.056). The groups had similar scores on
the questionnaires testing explicit knowledge of S-R and S-O
Fig. 1. The difference between differential and common outcomes in training and associative structure. Differential outcomes: In the training phase, participants
learn to associate stimuli with correct responses and differential outcomes. The ideal strategy to learn about these contingencies is to apply a goal-directed strat-
egy and form stimulus–outcome–response (S-O-R) associations. However, participants can also apply a more habitual strategy to form stimulus–response (S-R)
associations. Common outcomes: Here, two common-outcomes stimuli are associated with different correct responses but the same outcome. Therefore, these
discriminations should be hard, if not impossible, to learn with S-O-R associations, because one outcome would be associated with two different responses.
The favourable strategy is the habitual S-R association to prevent this conflict.

 contingencies ( p = 0.276 and p = 1, respectively) and similar
response accuracies on the choice test of R-O knowledge ( p = 0.272).
For the SOAT and Baseline test, we first performed an ANOVA
with test type (SOAT, Baseline), devaluation (valuable, devalued)
and discrimination (DO, CO) as within-subject factors and
group as between-subjects factor. There was a significant inter-
action of devaluation and group (F1,58 = 6.419, p = 0.014), but
no interaction of devaluation, group and test type (F1,58 = 0.370,
p = 0.546). Therefore, we calculated the overall difference scores
(per cent responses to still-valuable stimuli minus per cent
responses to devalued stimuli) across the two tests and found
them to be significantly lower in OCD patients compared with
controls, even when controlling for age and gender (F3,56 = 2.869,
p < 0.05), as shown in Fig. 3. Pearson’s correlations revealed that
the difference scores correlated with accuracy on PRM and PAL
total errors (r = 0.329, p = 0.010 and r = 0.446, p < 0.001, respect-
ively). There was also a significant interaction of test type, devalu-
ation and discrimination (F1,58 = 8.350, p = 0.005), which did not
differ between the groups. Both OCD patients and controls made
more errors for COs than DOs in the SOAT (F1,58 = 18.066, p <
0.001), but – as expected – not in the Baseline task, which does
not rely on retrieval of outcome knowledge.
Discussion
Using standardized CANTAB tasks and a newly developed DOE
and SOAT, we show that teenagers with OCD have significant
learning and memory impairments compared with healthy con-
trol subjects. Patients identified fewer patterns correctly and
were slower on the PRM task. They also made more errors on
the PAL task, similar to adult OCD patients (Morein-Zamir
et al. 2010). Performance at the discrimination and reversal learn-
ing stages of the IED task was also impaired, but not at the extra-
dimensional set shift stage. The observed difficulties at the
learning stages probably impaired formation of a stable atten-
tional set. More errors on the extradimensional shift stage, as
seen in adult OCD, are usually interpreted as impaired cognitive
flexibility (Chamberlain et al. 2007), but the present pattern of
results precludes firm conclusions about the existence of a similar
deficit in young OCD patients.
In this study, we provide the first experimental evidence of
impaired goal-directed control in youths with OCD. First of all,
the DOE task revealed a specific learning impairment in patients.
They were slower to learn instrumental discriminations with DOs
(but not CO) than controls, which may be indicative of an impair-
ment in goal-directed learning. However, patients did learn about
these contingencies later in the training, as shown by their explicit
knowledge of contingencies and good performance on the choice
test of R-O knowledge.
During the subsequent SOAT and Baseline test, patients were
generally less able to selectively respond on valuable trials, while
withholding their response when either the antecedent stimulus
or the consequent outcome had been devalued. Previously, it
has been argued that the SOAT provides a better measure of
Fig. 3. Impaired training accuracy and poorer adjustment to stimulus/outcome devaluation in youths with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Error bars denote
S.E.M. (a) Instrumental learning stage. Participants learned to associate stimuli (monsters) with correct responses (left or right button press) and outcomes
(rewards). In the first half of the training, patients performed less well for differential outcomes but not common outcomes compared to control participants,
but accuracy did not differ between the groups by the end of the training. (b) Stimulus/outcome devaluation. During the Baseline and Slips-of-Action tests,
some monsters or rewards were devalued, respectively. In the Baseline test, participants were instructed to withhold a response for the devalued stimuli. In
the Slips-of-Action test, they had to stop responding for stimuli that were associated with now devalued outcomes (the explicit indication of ‘GO’ and ‘NO-GO’
stimuli was added here for demonstration purposes, but was not shown in the task). There was no main effect of task. The combined analysis of Baseline and
Slips-of-Action tasks revealed a significantly lower difference score (% responses towards valuable minus % responses towards devalued stimuli) in the patient
group, suggesting an impaired ability to adjust learnt responses to instructed changes in stimulus/outcome value among youths with OCD. (c) Response–outcome
knowledge test. Participants were shown two differential outcomes simultaneously on the screen, one of which was devalued. They were instructed to make a
response towards the still valuable outcome, by pressing the key they would have to press to defeat the enemy associated with this reward. There were no
group differences in accuracy, suggesting that patients and controls had learned equally well about response–outcome contingencies for differential outcomes.

 relative goal-directed/habitual control than the Baseline test
because it relies on accurate prediction of the outcomes of one’s
actions, while the Baseline test merely requires one to remember
to which stimuli one should no longer respond (Worbe et al.
2015). According to that logic, the present finding of an impair-
ment across the two tests provides support for a more general
impairment in response inhibition or working memory in youths
with OCD. However, the results could equally well be explained
by a greater reliance on learnt S-R habits, as this should interfere
with suppression of learnt responses in both tests. We argue that
such a habitual style of responding could also be interpreted as an
impairment in goal-directed control in a broader sense. If patients
formed rigid S-R associations (as indicated by the lack of DOE in
the training phase among patients, suggesting that they employed
a S-R strategy to learn about both DOs and COs), discriminative
stimuli should continue to strongly trigger associated responses –
regardless of whether the stimulus or the outcome is devalued. In
both cases, rigid S-R associations would over-ride the devaluation.
Therefore, we argue that our results are in line with an imbalance
between goal-directed and habitual control towards inflexible
habits.
Our analyses suggest that the ability to differentiate between
valuable and devalued stimuli/outcomes relies on general memory
capacity: difference scores was moderately correlated with PRM
accuracy and PAL total errors. It has been shown that an increased
memory load can impair goal-directed behavioural control and
promote habitual actions (Otto et al. 2013a). The memory impair-
ment observed in patients could contribute to reliance on S-R
learning, which is thought to be less cognitively demanding than
goal-directed learning. At first glance, the results from the present
study may seem to partially contradict those of a previous study in
adult OCD that provided direct evidence for an impairment in
goal-directed control (Gillan et al. 2011). However, there are not-
able differences between the studies. The previous study did not
include Pavlovian training and fast responses were encouraged in
the instrumental discrimination training (participants were
instructed to respond quickly as fast responses were rewarded
with more points than slow responses). In contrast, the paradigm
described here facilitated outcome-learning by prior Pavlovian
(S-O) training and by imposing an S-R delay in the instrumental
discrimination training, which allowed participants more time to
retrieve the appropriate outcome before responding. This differ-
ence might explain why adult OCD patients in the previous
study were impaired on explicit knowledge of S-O-R contingencies
and a choice test of R-O knowledge (Gillan et al. 2011), while
adolescent OCD patients in the present study were not.
Widespread effects of learning and memory problems
The most consistent finding across the tasks of this study is a sig-
nificant learning and memory impairment in youths with OCD, as
it is evident in all four tasks. We postulate that the deficits demon-
strated in this study and others could have important consequences
for juvenile OCD patients. Experiencing learning and memory dif-
ficulties in childhood could lead to lower confidence in memory.
Elevated doubt regarding memory and compulsive behaviours is
often reported in OCD patients (Tolin et al. 2001; Zitterl et al.
2001), as well as increased intolerance of doubt and uncertainty
(Rasmussen & Eisen, 1989). These characteristics could be vulner-
ability factors for OCD. Compulsive checking can be used as an
example: after checking once, patients who are aware of their mem-
ory problems and therefore doubt their memories from the last
checking, could be encouraged to check again and again. It has
been shown that reduced confidence in memory abilities is asso-
ciated with OCD symptoms, and especially checking in healthy
participants (Nedeljkovic & Kyrios, 2007).
These learning and memory problems in youths could be amp-
lified by stress. It has been shown that children show significant
increases in stress hormone levels when they enrol in school
(Russ et al. 2012). Stress, in turn, is known to impair memory, espe-
cially declarative and episodic memory of non-emotional material
(Wolf, 2009). It is conceivable that entering school with pre-
existing memory impairments and experiencing difficulties at
school would increase this stress response even more, starting a cir-
cle of negative influences. Furthermore, both stress and memory
deficits are known to tip the balance between goal-directed and
habitual behavioural control towards inflexible habits (Schwabe
& Wolf, 2011; Otto et al. 2013b). These two factors – stress and
memory impairments – could work in concert to make children
and adolescents more reliant on S-R habits and less able to flexibly
adjust their actions, and may predispose them to develop OCD.
Once OCD has developed, memory impairments could also
weaken the effect of therapy. One of the most effective therapies
for paediatric OCD is cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT),
which requires the patient to understand and remember what is
being discussed and practiced in therapy. There is evidence to
suggest that performance on a memory task can predict treatment
response to CBT among children and adolescents with OCD, such
that non-responders showed significantly lower memory perform-
ance than responders (Flessner et al. 2010). Importantly, it has
also been shown that successful treatment is associated with an
improvement in non-verbal memory, such that juvenile OCD
patients were impaired before, but not after treatment compared
with healthy controls (Andrés et al. 2008).
Future studies will be necessary to show if these learning and
memory impairments are clinically significant in adolescent
OCD. It is conceivable that we will need to address memory
impairments in these children early on to break the circle of nega-
tive influences and aid recovery.
