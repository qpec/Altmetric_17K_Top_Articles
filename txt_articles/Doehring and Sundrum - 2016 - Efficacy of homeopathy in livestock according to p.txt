Efficacy of homeopathy in livestock according to 
peer-reviewed publications from 1981 to 2014
C. Doehring, A. Sundrum
Homeopathy is widely used in livestock, especially in order to reduce the use of antibiotics, although 
it is often seen as controversial. A comprehensive literature review has been conducted to assess the 
efficacy of homeopathy in cattle, pigs and poultry. Only peer-reviewed publications dealing with 
homeopathic remedies, which could possibly replace or prevent the use of antibiotics in the case of 
infective diseases or growth promotion in livestock were included. Search results revealed  
a total number of 52 trials performed within 48 publications fulfilling the predefined criteria.  
Twenty-eight trials were in favour of homeopathy, with 26 trials showing a significantly higher 
efficacy in comparison to a control group, whereas 22 showed no medicinal effect. Cure rates for 
the treatments with antibiotics, homeopathy or placebo varied to a high degree, while the remedy 
used did not seem to make a big difference. Looking at all the studies, no study was repeated 
under comparable conditions. Consequently, the use of homeopathy currently cannot claim to have 
sufficient prognostic validity where efficacy is concerned. When striving for high therapeutic success 
in treatment, the potential of homeopathy in replacing or reducing antibiotics can only be validated if 
evidence of efficacy is confirmed by randomised controlled trials under modified conditions.
Within the scientific community and veterinary practice, the use 
of homeopathy in food-producing animals is highly controversial. 
however, there is evidence that homeopathic remedies are widely 
used in these animals (hovi 2001, ECCh 2007, iMPRO 2015). 
For organic agriculture, the use of homeopathy is even promoted. 
According to the European Commission Regulation (EC no 
889/2008, Article 24[2]) (European Commission 2008) on organic 
agriculture, homeopathic and other products should be used in 
preference to chemically synthesised allopathic veterinary treatment, 
provided that the resultant therapy is effective for the species of animal 
and the condition for which the treatment is intended. 
in the case of infectious bacterial diseases, antimicrobial drugs 
have been used in livestock production for decades as the first and 
often only effective option for individual or group treatment. 
nowadays, the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals is often 
unpopular among consumers (Midan Marketing 2014, Mintel Group 
2015, niamh 2015). ‘Antibiotic-free’ or ‘raised without antibiotics’ 
labelled products are enjoying increased popularity in both Europe 
and the USA. this development is fuelled by, among others, mis- 
and overuse of antibiotics in human and animal medicine, which has 
promoted the development of resistant strains of bacteria worldwide 
(Laxminarayan and others 2013). Correspondingly, many farmers and 
veterinarians see homeopathy as an alternative for treating diseases in

farm animals and thus reducing the consumption of antibiotics.
homeopathy was introduced by Samuel hahnemann as early as 
1796 and claims as a method to treat diseases with dilute remedies 
that cause the same symptoms undiluted in healthy individuals as the 
disease does (simile principle). those symptoms are seen as very spe-
cific and individual, resulting in the requirement for a detailed diagnos-
tic procedure where not only the symptoms and cause of the disease 
are considered, but also the patient’s behaviour, constitution and con-
ditions that may cause aggravation or amelioration of symptoms, to 
find the corresponding remedy for each patient (hahnemann 1869).
Reviews on the efficacy of homeopathy in people have found that 
the success of homeopathic treatment in general cannot be completely 
due to placebo effects, but studies have provided insufficient evidence 
that homoeopathy is efficacious (Linde and others 1997). in fact, the 
quality of the methodologies used was low (Linde and others 2001) 
and the bias high in homeopathic trials on people. At the same time, 
there is weak evidence for the particular effectiveness of homeopathy 
as compared to conventional treatment (Shang and others 2005). Up 
until now, only a few scientific publications have reviewed the efficacy 
of homeopathy in animals (Kowalski 1989, hektoen 2005, Rijnberk 
and Ramey 2007, Ruegg 2008), revealing diverse results. Previously, 
a review and meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials in 
veterinary homeopathy with a special focus on medical conditions 
were published by Mathie and Clausen (2014, 2015). Due to the low 
number and quality of studies available, particularly regarding the risk 
of bias, they found very limited evidence for distinguishable differences 
between homeopathy and placebo in clinical interventions, demanding 
the need for new and higher quality research in veterinary homeopathy. 
For food-producing animals, there has been no review of peer-reviewed 
publications conducted on the efficacy of homeopathy. the aim of this 
review was therefore to systematically evaluate the existing knowl-
edge on the efficacy of homeopathic remedies used for the prevention 
or treatment of diseases in livestock that are usually treated with anti-
microbials by considering more scientific, peer-reviewed publications

(including doctoral thesis) and a comprehensive timeframe from 1981 
to 2014. Within the analysis, additional information on trial conditions, 
remedies used and treated species were taken into account.
Methods
the search for scientific publications was carried out in the follow-
ing databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect and Web of Science. Specific 
databases on veterinary homeopathy were available at homVetCR 
(Carstens-Stiftung) (2016), Vetion:oekovet.de (2016) or AudeSapere 
(2016) and also taken into account. Further publications were found 
by relying on the reference list of considered studies. the searches 
were performed in February 2014 and updated up to the end of 
June 2016. the search terms were defined according to the PiCOS 
approach (Moher and others 2009): 
n  
Population: ‘livestock’ OR ‘dairy’ OR ‘cows’ OR ‘cattle’ OR 
‘bovine’ OR ‘heifer’ OR ‘calves’ OR ‘pigs’ OR ‘sows’ OR ‘piglets’ 
OR ‘poultry’ OR ‘swine’ OR ‘porcine’ OR ‘turkeys’ OR ‘broiler/s’ 
OR ‘chicken’ OR ‘hen/s’ 
n  
intervention: ‘homeopathy’ OR ‘veterinary homeopathy’ OR 
‘homeopathic’ OR ‘dilution’ OR ‘complementary veterinary med-
icine’ OR ‘isopathy’ OR ‘nosodes’ 
n  
Comparison: ‘prevention’ OR ‘prophylaxis’ OR ‘metaphylaxis’ 
OR ‘treatment/s’ OR ‘therapy’ OR ‘comparison’ 
n  
Outcome: ‘efficacy’ OR ‘effectiveness’ OR ‘effect/s’ OR 
‘efficiency’ 
n  
Setting: ‘clinical trial’ OR ‘review’ OR ‘trial/s’ OR ‘study/ies’.
Only publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals and doctoral 
theses were taken into account. the studies considered addressed the 
efficacy of homeopathic drugs in cattle, pigs or poultry in production 
diseases under European or comparable conditions (in respect to hous-
ing, breeds, intensive farming). included in the evaluation were only 
studies dealing with homeopathic remedies, which could possibly 
replace or prevent the use of antibiotics in the case of infective produc-
tion diseases or growth promotion. the time frame of publications 
considered was from 1981 to 2014. Accessible languages were English 
and German. the main reasons for excluding publications were: that 
no peer-review was performed (conference abstracts, journals without 
peer-review), trials only dealt with companion animals, and/or trials 
that dealt with diseases that were not infectious, eg, hormonal-treated 
fertility disorders.
the search and filtering process (Fig 1) was performed by the same 
person following the PRiSMA guidelines (Liberati and others 2009). 
the following information was extracted from each study according 
to a predefined protocol (available from the authors): author, publica-
tion year and source, research body, species/group, farming system, 
purpose of application, disease in focus, exclusion criteria, diagnostic 
method and person diagnosing, remedy used (as well as origin [pro-
ducer]), ingredients and potency of the remedy, method of adminis-
tration, study design and control groups, methods of measurement, 
possible risk of bias and outcome of the study. Publications including 
more than one clinical trial were regarded as separate studies for the 
purpose of the evaluation and comparison of data.
in medicine, efficacy indicates the capacity for beneficial change 
(or therapeutic effect) of a given intervention (eg, a drug). When talk-
ing in terms of efficacy vs effectiveness, effectiveness relates to how 
well a treatment works in the practice of medicine, as opposed to effi-
cacy, which measures how well treatment works in clinical trials or 
laboratory studies (thaul 2012).
this review classified homeopathic treatment as efficacious when 
the homeopathic remedy presented a statistically significant improve-
ment in comparison to a placebo, a conventionally treated or an 
untreated group of farm animals. if the impact of a homeopathic treat-
ment did not differ significantly to that from a placebo or an untreated 
group, or was worse, nil efficacy was reported. Results were classified 
as ‘inconclusive’, when the level of efficacy did not differ significantly 
between the homeopathic group and the group employing antibiotics 
(without a further control group as placebo or untreated), when the 
values of particular parameters improved while others deteriorated or 
when the authors did not provide a clear result. t
o assess the possible 
influence of single dichotomous factors on reporting efficacy of home-
opathy in a trial, a sensitivity analysis was performed, expressing the 
effect size as odds ratio (OR) with 95 per cent confidence interval and 
P values calculated according to Sheskin (2004).
Results
From the 4448 publications found, 48 publications were identified, 
which met the given criteria (Fig 1). these publications featured 52 
individual clinical trials (including 34 trials with cattle, 12 with pigs 
and six with poultry). One publication included three separate clinical 
trials (Day 1986), and two publications each included two clinical tri-
als (Schütte 1991,1994).
the 33 scientific papers were primarily published in homeopathic 
journals (eg, Homeopathy, British Homeopathic Journal, International Journal 
of High Dilution Research, Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, 
Zeitschrift für Ganzheitliche Tiermedizin), and only a few were found in 
veterinary journals (eg, Veterinary Record, Journal of Dairy Science, Journal 
of Animal Science, Berliner und Münchener Tierärztliche Wochenzeitschrift, 
Transboundary and Emerging Diseases). Fifteen doctoral theses on home-
opathy in livestock were available, having originated from veterinary 
or agricultural universities. the greater part of the studies were pub-
lished between the years 2003 and 2014 (n=25). it seems fewer stud-
ies were published before, with 14 publications in the time period 
1981 until 1991 and nine publications between 1992 and 2002.
in most of the studies (54 per cent), the production method was 
not specified. the remaining studies were defined as either conven-
tional (33 per cent, particularly pig and poultry farms) or as organic 
(6 per cent, exclusively dairy farms). Seven per cent of the studies had 
looked at both farming systems.
the main purpose of applying homeopathic remedies in clinical 
trials was prevention of disease (quoted in a total of 30 studies, includ-
ing six studies aiming for good general health or growth promotion). 
Furthermore, 18 studies referred to the therapeutic treatment of diseas-
es, while four studies focused on metaphylactic treatment (medication 
administered before the onset of clinical signs in the herd). 
Indication
the reason for using homeopathic remedies to treat disease was dif-
ferent for each species (Fig 2). in studies dealing with cattle, treatment

was for mastitis or fertility disorders in dairy cows. Calves were only 
treated for the indications diarrhoea and pneumonia. the studies on 
pigs ranged between fertility disorders, especially mastitis-metritis-
agalactia syndrome (MMA) in sows, respiratory infections and diar-
rhoea in piglets, and growth promotion and general health in fatten-
ing pigs. in the case of poultry, the main indication for using home-
opathy was growth promotion or the treatment of diarrhoea.
Studies which included more than one treatment indication were 
counted per indication. nearly all animals treated with remedies had 
become sick through natural infection. An artificial infection was 
only induced in two studies on chickens: Velkers and others (2005) 
induced an Escherichia coli-infection in the chickens on day 8 and 
Berchieri and others (2006) challenged chickens on the day 17 after 
birth with a broth culture of Salmonella Enteritidis.
Exclusion criteria
nineteen of 52 studies defined criteria for the exclusion of animals 
from trial participation or gave reasons for exclusion of animals dur-
ing the trial. Animals were primarily excluded for showing systemic 
clinical signs (eg, fever, loss of appetite) or severe organ damage, which 
affects the ability of an animal’s immune system to react to a stimulus, 
as well as the presence of additional diseases or any further medica-
tion being taken at the time of the study, missing data or because the 
animals died or were sold prematurely. 
Diagnostic procedure
in the various studies diagnostic procedures to evaluate the amelio-
ration or deterioration of health or performance and to measure the 
effect of the applied remedy were quite heterogeneous. the diagnostic 
methods were divided into four groups: 
1.  
Direct tests (Dt): eg, laboratory tests for detection of the pathogen 
in milk, faeces, blood, and so on.
2.  
indirect tests (it): eg, California mastitis test or conductivity milk 
test, rectal palpation of the uterus, general blood parameters, and 
so on.
3.  
Clinical signs (CS): eg, optical assessment of milk for clots, observa-
tion of clinical signs such as alterations in faeces consistency, cough-
ing, and so on. 
4.  
Measurements (M): eg, body temperature, body weight, milk yield, 
and so on.
in more than half of the trials, two (n=22) or more parameters 
(n=9) were considered when diagnosing diseases or the possible effects 
of using remedies. the most frequently undertaken diagnostic test was 
the recording of clinical signs, followed by direct tests. indirect tests, 
often available as on-site tests, and additional measurements were per-
formed to a lesser degree (Fig 3). An individualised homeopathic diag-
nostic procedure enclosing the choice of an appropriate (and often differ-
ent) homeopathic remedy for the individual was performed in five trials 
(Seifert 1987, hektoen and others 2004, W
erner and others 2010) with 
two of them limiting the selection of possible remedies ( (Sonnenwald 
1986, Williamson and Lacy-hulbert 2014). the question of who had 
diagnosed a disease or observed a clinical sign remained unanswered in 
22 of 52 studies. in 13 studies, homeopathic expertise was provided by 
a veterinarian, trained or experienced in homeopathy or accompanied 
by a trained homeopath (hektoen and others 2004) or supervised by an 
external veterinarian experienced in homeopathy (Werner and others 
2010). in 11 trials, a veterinarian diagnosed the clinical signs, in three 
trials the farmer decided whether the animal improved or not, in one 
case the diagnosis was made by the veterinarian and farmer together in 
another, an immunologist and in a further trial an automated milking 
system gave the diagnosis.
Remedies
in general, two types of homeopathic remedies were available: rem-
edies including only one active ingredient in the initial tincture (used 
for classic or individualised homeopathy) and remedies combining 
two or more active ingredients in the initial tincture (used for complex 
homeopathy). Fifty-six per cent of the studies saw complex remedies 
(with combined ingredients) being employed and 34 per cent of the 
studies saw classic single remedies being used. in the remaining stud-
ies (10 per cent), the type of homeopathic remedy was not revealed or 
was impossible to differentiate (eg, parallel use of single and complex 
remedies). the producers of the applied remedies were not listed in 
30 per cent of the studies. in the other cases, the companies heel (15 
per cent) and DhU (13 per cent) were most often listed as producers 
of remedies, followed by other small producing companies or local 
pharmacies (42 per cent). the homeopathic dilutions or potencies of 
the applied drugs were either high (n=21 trials) from D60 (respective-
ly C30, a 1: 10-60 dilution) to D400 (respectively C200, a 1: 10-400 
dilution) or low potencies (n=21) from D1 (a 1:10 dilution) to D24 
(a 1:10-24 dilution), where the letter ‘D’ stands for decimal dilution 
steps and ‘C’ for centesimal dilution steps. in six studies, the potency 
was not mentioned. Four studies considered both high and low poten-
cies (tiefenthaler 1990, Vohla 1991, Knierim 1992, Egan 1995). the 
ingredients used in the studies were of herbal, mineral or animal ori-
gin. nosodes, a specific type of homeopathic preparations often called 
‘homeopathic vaccines’ were made up either from the pathogen or 
from products of the disease (eg, pus, sputum) and used in nine trials.
Methods of administration
the means of administration differed depending on whether individ-
uals or groups of animals were treated. For groups, the administration 
was solely oral (by drinking water or mineral salt). For individuals, 
the drugs were usually administered orally or infrequently via subcu-
taneous or intramuscular injection, topical (eg, vulval spray or udder 
cream) or by intramammary injection. 
Study design 
the ‘evidence-based medicine’ approach is premised upon the current 
knowledge level based on clinical studies and scientific publications, 
which confirm or invalidate the efficacy of a certain measure or rem-
edy (Panesar and others 2010). in single clinical trials, double-blind 
randomised-controlled trials (RCt
s) are regarded as the ‘gold stand-
ard’ for proving the empiric evidence of efficacy of a remedy tested 
(European Medicines Agency [EMA] 2001, Kaptchuk 2001). With 
this in mind, the structures of the selected trials were examined with 
respect to their ability to measure the efficacy of homeopathy on the 
level of evidence-based medicine.
Seventy-nine per cent of the single clinical trials were RCt
s (n=41). 
the remaining studies were either non-randomised controlled trials, eg, 
parallel groups (n=6) or observational trials without a control group 
(n=5). the RCt
s (n=41) could be divided into 21 non-blind trials, nine 
single-blind trials and 11 double-blind trials. ‘Single-blind’ means that 
the patient is not aware of the true nature of the drug applied. in the case 
of animals, a single-blind experiment means that the person administer-
ing the drug is not aware of the true nature of the applied drug or the 
ingredients. Double-blind trials include a ‘blinding’ of both the user and

the sample assessor (Schulz and Grimes 2002). the blinding aims to 
eliminate effects such as observation bias and wishful thinking, which 
could occur if the samples are evaluated by someone who already 
knows the group’s organisational and treatment methods.
Control groups (eg, an untreated group, placebo group or antibiotic-
treated group) were also included in this evaluation. More than half of 
the trials (65 per cent) had a study design with only one control group, 
17 per cent included two control groups and four studies compared the 
experimental group with three control groups. the five observational 
studies did not use any control or parallel group at all. Out of all 64 
control groups, 42 per cent were treated with a placebo, 31 per cent with 
antibiotics, 10 per cent with a different conventional treatment (eg, teat 
sealers or a local disinfectant) or a combined treatment (eg, antibiotic 
combined with a placebo or a homeopathic remedy) and only 17 per 
cent included an untreated group. 
Efficacy
in total, 54 per cent (n=28) of the trials were able to confirm the efficacy 
of the homeopathic remedy administered, while 42 per cent (n=22) 
found no benefit compared with the placebo or untreated group. Four 
per cent (n=2) had inconclusive results. When considering a single spe-
cies (t
able 1) only homeopathic studies dealing with pigs were found 
to be frequently efficacious, while studies with cattle or poultry were 
seen to have a similar distribution of efficacious and non-efficacious 
treatment.
t
rials demonstrating the efficacy of the homeopathic remedy 
were published mainly in scientific journals (21 out of 28 positive tri-
als), as well as studies with a negative outcome (14 out of 22 negative). 
in journals focussing on alternative treatments, 15 of 18 trials reported 
that the homeopathic remedy tested was effective (odds ratio [OR] 
3.75, 95 per cent confidence interval [Ci] 0.63 to 22.04, P=0.14), 
while in journals with a broader focus on veterinary medicine, 12 out 
of 18 trials found the homeopathic treatment was ineffective (OR 
0.27, 95 per cent Ci 0.05 to 1.57). Results described in a doctoral the-
sis on homeopathic remedies were nearly evenly distributed between 
non-efficacious (n=8) and efficacious (n=7), apart from one thesis 
which revealed inconclusive results.
Treatment success
in order to provide information on cure rates, 18 out of 52 clinical tri-
als which administered homeopathy exclusively for therapeutic reasons 
were further analysed. Only 10 of these trials gave information on cure 
rates (t
able 2), while eight trials did not define cure rates at all. instead, 
the effectiveness of the homeopathic remedy was evaluated on the basis 
of other criteria, for example, number of recurring treatments, mortality, 
duration of diarrhoea, fertility parameters, milk yield, and so on.
A wide range of different criteria for defining recovery or cure was 
found, for example, in case of mastitis: ‘full recovery’ with or with-
out cytobacteriological recovery, or ‘clinical recovery’ with or without 
cytobacteriological recovery, or only ‘bacteriological recovery’, and 
so on. this made comparison and interpretation of the results more 
difficult. Correspondingly, the different cure rates could not all be 
compared directly to one another. Overall, the cure rates in the seven 
studies focusing on mastitis ranged from 5 per cent to 80 per cent for 
a treatment with homeopathic remedies, from 17 per cent to 95 per 
cent when using a conventional remedy (predominantly antibiotics),

and from 4 per cent to 56 per cent for the administration of a placebo. 
in two studies, the results comparing homeopathic remedies with a 
placebo for diarrhoea in calves seemed to be the same. the results for 
MMA in sows favoured homeopathy compared to allopathy.
Efficacy and remedy
When the outcomes of the trials were compared with the type 
of remedy used (single or complex remedies), no differences were 
found. Remedies with low potencies (D1 to D12) showed the same 
results as homeopathic treatments with high potencies (more than 
D24) as far as efficacy was concerned (OR 1, 95 per cent Ci 0.28 to 
3.54 , P=1) and did not depend on the purpose of use (prevention, 
treatment, metaphylaxis) nor the indication (eg, mastitis, diarrhoea), 
species or the performance of an individualised treatment procedure.
Study design and risk of bias
Fig 4 shows the results of the studies evaluated with a focus on the study 
designs. the double-blind RCt
s reported efficacy (n=5) of the homeo-
pathic treatment almost as often as they reported lack of efficacy of it 
(n=6). Single-blind RCt
s and non-blind RCt
s on homeopathy had a 
tendency to be efficacious. Observational trials or parallel groups (with-
out randomisation) were most likely to present evidence of efficacy.
All trials were also analysed for a possible risk of bias, which incor-
porated both study design and study conduct (t
able 3). Studies were 
regarded as having a ‘low’ risk of bias when: they included a randomi-
sation, a control group, blinding of the people directly involved in their 
administration and evaluation, the absence of selective reporting and 
other shortcomings within the trial, and no direct or indirect funding of 
the study by the producer of the conventional or homeopathic remedy. 
Only 13 studies displayed a low or unclear risk of bias. Shortcomings 
and risk for selective reporting or bias were found in 39 trials to various 
degrees. Some studies only considered a very small number of animals 
(eg, 10 to 40 animals) in the trial. therefore, conclusions drawn could 
only be very limited. Often, studies were financially supported, eg, by 
the producer of the homeopathic or conventional remedy (full funding 
or free provision of remedies), which might have influenced the results 
(n=12). in one trial, all of the researchers worked for the supplier of the 
homeopathic remedy, which certainly entailed a conflict of interests 
(Aubry and others 2013). however, studies with such vested interests 
reported efficacy of homeopathy less often than studies with no overt 
vested interest (OR 0.87, 95 per cent Ci 0.23 to 3.37, P=0.84 vs OR 
1.15, 95 per cent Ci 0.30 to 4.42). Further shortcomings were that the 
origin, contents or potencies of remedies were not presented (n=10), 
compromising any attempt to repeat a trial. in trials where antibiotics 
were used as a control, the antimicrobial substance was often chosen 
without considering guidelines for prudent use or existing knowledge 
about resistance characteristics of the pathogen in focus, eg, penicillin 
treatment for E coli-infection (Coelho and others 2009). One study also 
mentioned the exclusion of certain homeopathic remedies and their 
test results because they were not positive (Berchieri and others 2006). 
the intake of the homeopathic remedy was not easy to define, eg, 
as the administration was via concentrate or water troughs. Further

risks found were: groups were not evenly distributed, measures were 
not scientifically valid, eg, subjective or very indirect measures for 
improvement or cure, homeopathy was only tested in combination 
with antimicrobials or no control (placebo/untreated) was considered. 
Altogether, studies with a high possible risk of bias were more prone 
to report efficacy of homeopathy than studies with a low risk of bias 
(OR 1.71, 95 per cent Ci 0.48 to 6.11, P=0.41 vs OR 0.58, 95 per cent 
Ci 0.16 to 2.09).
Species-specific results
Studies on cattle 
Altogether, 34 trials on cattle matched the selection criteria (t
able 4). 
the main focus (85 per cent) was on dairy cows (n=29), the other 
studies dealt with calves (n=5). homeopathy was proved efficacious 
in 15 studies, but no evidence was found in 18 studies and inconclu-
sive results were returned for one of them. Five out of eight studies 
performing double-blind RCt
s reported no homeopathic efficacy,

while three demonstrated efficacy (Day 1986, hümmelchen 1999, 
Schlecht 2004).
t
wenty studies dealt exclusively with udder health, including 
prevention or treatment of acute or subclinical mastitis, drying off 
(Schütte 1994, Klocke 2010) or udder health in general (Schlecht 
2004). Apart from mastitis, fertility disorders, especially around 
the parturition such as retained placenta and endometritis, were 
addressed in nine studies. Remarkably, almost all studies on fertility 
disorders used homeopathy exclusively for prevention and not for 
therapeutic treatment. Only Enbergs and Sensen (2007) examined 
the use of two different homeopathic complex remedies to treat 
chronic endometritis, yielding a positive result. Wirth (1990) and 
Erbe (1990) applied different metaphylactic homeopathic remedies 
to their experimental groups to reduce retained placenta and endo-
metritis, both with a positive outcome. 
When only taking into account studies on dairy cows, 14 out 
of 29 publications were able to prove efficacy of the homeopathic 
remedy, while in the same number of studies no benefit of home-
opathy was shown. One of the studies failed to show a clear result: 
Sonnenwald (1986) struggled with undefined results comparing 
homeopathic and antibiotic treatment for acute mastitis. the home-
opathic treatment showed better results for Gram-negative masti-
tis-causing bacteria and antibiotics were more effective for Gram-
positive Streptococcus subspecies.
Four of the five studies on calves dealt exclusively with the 
treatment of diarrhoea (Frerking and Romansky-Rieken 1981, 
Kayne and Rafferty 1994, Verdier and others 2003, hornig 2014).

gle homeopathic drug Arsenicum album 30C as efficacious, resulting 
in recovery one day faster in the homeopathically treated calves 
than in the placebo group. Boerms (1981) tested the effectiveness 
of the classic homeopathic remedy Echinacea in combination with 
standard allopathic remedies for treating pneumonia and enteritis 
in calves. this was trialled in comparison with ‘pure’ standard 
antibiotic treatment without significant differences in cure rates 
compared to Echinacea. 
Studies on pigs 
t
welve studies on pigs were identified (t
able 5). nine trials found the 
homeopathic remedy to be effective, two could not prove the tested 
remedy to be efficacious and one had inconclusive results. the various 
outcomes seemed not to be related to the study design. Observational 
trials and open RCt
s, as well as single- or double-blind RCt
s, were 
performed with either efficacy or no efficacy or inconclusive results 
for the applied homeopathic remedy reported. 
the age of the animals varied considerably between the tri-
als evaluated: five trials were performed with sows, four trials with 
mainly fattening pigs and three with piglets. the reasons listed for 
application of homeopathic remedies were predominantly prevention 
(n=10). three studies addressed fertility disorders in sows (Day 1984, 
Seifert 1987, Drösemeier 1989), three dealt with respiratory infections 
(Schütte 1991 [two trials], Albrecht and Schütte 1999) and three with 
diarrhoea (Soto and others 2008, Coelho and others 2009, Camerlink 
and others 2010), while two focused on growth promotion(Guajardo-
Bernal and others 1996, Da Silva and others 2011) and one simply 
aimed for a good general health (Schütte 2003). the three disease 
complexes mentioned are among the most common reasons for the 
use of antibiotics on pig farms in practice (Christensen and others 
1995, Petersen and others 2008). the prevention or treatment of fer-
tility disorders (in particular stillbirth and MMA) with homeopathic 
remedies was effective in two out of three trials in sows. it should be 
noted that the trials that were efficacious were either a parallel group 
trial (Day 1984) or a non-blind RCt (Seifert 1987), while the one 
study that failed to yield evidence of efficacy of preventing MMA in 
sows was a double-blind RCt (Drösemeier 1989).
in a study on respiratory disease and general state of health, home-
opathy was significantly more effective than low dosage antibiotics 
or a placebo for fattening pigs, but was less effective than a high dos-
age antibiotic metaphylaxis (Albrecht and Schütte 1999). in the ear-
lier non-blind trial of Schütte (1991), a metaphylactic treatment with 
two different homeopathic complex remedies yielded a significantly 
higher efficacy compared with a placebo depending on the duration of 
treatment, but was not as efficacious as an antibiotic treatment. 
t
wo of the studies dealt with growth promotion: Guajardo-Bernal 
and others (1996) administered a very high dilution (C201) of sulfur 
to pregnant sows and examined the weight and performance of the 
new born piglets in a single-blind RCt. it found no significant differ-
ence in the birth weights and the further development of the piglets in 
comparison with a placebo group. in an observational trial, Da Silva 
and others (2011) treated the pigs directly with a complex remedy 
in two different treatment schemes aiming for growth promotion. 
the weight recorded differed between the groups within the study 
period, but as there was no control group, no clear outcome could 
be concluded. Studies by Soto and others (2008), Coelho and others 
(2009) and Camerlink and others (2010) aimed to prevent diarrhoea 
in piglets. Coelho and others (2009) and Camerlink and others (2010) 
performed a double and single blind RCt, respectively. Both studies 
yielded a positive result for efficacy of homeopathy in comparison to 
a control group treated with an antibiotic or placebo. Soto and others 
(2008) showed that homeopathically treated piglets lost less weight 
compared to an untreated control or placebo group, but the difference 
between the placebo and homeopathy groups was not significant. 
the only study evaluating the influence of homeopathy on general 
health in pigs measured by clinical signs, gravity and length of illness, 
therapeutic results and antibiotic consumption (Schütte 2003) showed 
that the consumption of antimicrobials on the participating farms 
could be reduced by 60 per cent (over three years) when homeopathy 
was used.
Studies on poultry 
Only six studies were found dealing with homeopathic treatment in 
poultry production and they were performed exclusively on chickens 
(t
able 6). Efficacy of homeopathic treatment was proven in four stud-
ies out of the six. 
in three trials, homeopathy was administered to treat diarrhoea 
caused by Salmonella (Sandoval and others 1998, Berchieri and oth-
ers 2006) or E coli-infection (Velkers and others 2005). the remain-
ing three studies looked at growth promotion (Amalcaburio and 
others 2009, hadipour and others 2011, Sato and others 2012), and 
one study combined this with observations on improved immune 
reactivity (Sato and others 2012). the four studies where homeo-
pathic treatment was effective were performed as observational 
(Sandoval and others 1998), non-blind RCt
s (Berchieri and others 
2006, hadipour and others 2011) and a double-blind RCt (Sato and 
others 2012). Berchieri and others (2006) induced an infection to test 
the preventive effect of a Salmonella nosode and found a significant 
lower faecal excretion of Salmonella Enteritis when compared with an 
untreated group. hadipour and others (2011) compared the growth 
promoting effects of a combined homeopathic remedy with unde-
fined potency to a group treated with a standard regime of antibiot-

ics and vaccines. they found a 5 per cent lower mortality and signif-
icantly higher weight gain in the homeopathic experimental group. 
Sato and others (2012) performed a double-blind RCt with chickens 
and noted that the group with Thymulin in a D5 (1:10-5) dilution ben-
efitted from an immune stimulating and growth-promoting effect, 
compared to an untreated group.
the two studies with a negative outcome were an observational 
study (Velkers and others 2005) and a non-blind RCt (Amalcaburio 
and others 2009). One of them used high dilutions (C12 or C30) of a 
combined homeopathic remedy in comparison to an untreated con-
trol (Amalcaburio and others 2009). the other study administered 
three different combinations of homeopathic drugs combined with 
an E coli nosode, all in a high dilution (C30, C200), with no effect 
compared to the untreated or antibiotic-treated control groups (V
elkers 
and others 2005). 
Heterogeneity among the trials
A classic comparison of the individual clinical trials within a system-
atic review according to the principles of evidence-based medicine was 
not possible. these principles involve randomisation, blinding and 
several clinical trials performed on the same species, disease and rem-
edy to be evaluated in a systematic way. A large heterogeneity among 
all clinical trials was found. Differences emerged in various areas:
n  
Patients. the patients included in the trials differed with respect to 
species. Differences within species were in relation to: age of farm 
animals, performance level, resilience, and thus different individual 
abilities to respond to pharmaceutical active ingredients.
n  
Remedy. the remedies used in the trials differed with respect to: 
ingredients in classic and combined homeopathic remedies, high 
and low dilutions (potencies), administration method, pharma-
ceutically active ingredients (not standardised). Remedies were 
administered in different ways for various indications in order to 
achieve preventive, metaphylactic, therapeutic, growth-promoting 
or immune system stimulating effects.
n  
Context. the trials were performed in different contexts, distin-
guished among others by: diseases, pathogens, means of infection 
(naturally occurring or artificially induced), farm animals’ living 
conditions regarding hygiene standards, feeding regimen and treat-
ment procedures. in 54 per cent of the studies, the living conditions 
were not described.
n  
Expertise: Diagnostic procedures in the trials were performed 
by people who differed considerably in education, expertise and 
knowledge of treatment strategies. Choice of remedy and means 
of measuring the therapeutic effect of the homeopathic remedy 
applied differed between trials. this was also the case regarding 
assessment of therapeutic effects (eg, visual improvement in milk) 
compared to an objective analysis (eg, complete clinical examina-
tions accompanied by external laboratory tests) (Fig 3).
Within the studies considered, the use of the same remedy admin-
istered to the same species with a comparable medical indication was 
not repeated. thus, the results lack any reproducibility. 
Discussion
t
aking into account the long existence of homeopathy and use in 
livestock production, only a comparatively small number of scientific 
studies focussing on the efficacy of homeopathy have been conducted 
so far. Four publications summarised a limited number of trials with 
different search criteria while considering various species, including 
livestock. three of them evaluated the efficacy of homeopathy as 
poor or insufficient; one of the reports did not come to a clear result 
due to limitations in scientific quality of studies available: 
n  
Kowalski (1989) evaluated homeopathic treatment in veterinary 
literature for a doctoral thesis and found that homeopathy had cer-
tain effects, but only one homeopathic trial seemed to have been 
efficacious. Fourteen controlled, clinical trials (not including experi-
mental trials on single animals and general treatises on remedy pic-
tures) were assessed. t
en of the 14 trials considered cattle or pigs, 
while the rest dealt with cats, dogs or horses. 
n  
hektoen (2005) took into account three single clinical trials and the 
publication of Kowalski (1989) to evaluate the efficacy of homeop-
athy in animals. the remaining sources covered broader literature 
and conference proceedings or grey literature on the topic ‘home-
opathy and placebo effect’, predominantly considering human 
medicine. the resulting article did not emerge with a clear decision 
on the efficacy of homeopathy, because of the poor quality of the 
available studies.
n  
Rijnberk and Ramey (2007) considered 10 publications from 
human medicine, for example, homeopathy reviews, while only 
four clinical trials including animals (three on cattle, one on dogs) 
were considered. they published a report on the lack of effective-
ness of veterinary homeopathy pointing out among other things 
the existence of no significant differences of homeopathic remedies 
and placebos when compared in studies. 
n  
Ruegg (2008) compared different treatment strategies of mastitis 
and its efficacy. Four publications (Egan 1998, hektoen and others 
2004, holmes and others 2005, Rijnberk and Ramey 2007) were 
considered and concluded that efficacy data for veterinary home-
opathy appear to be almost completely lacking.
in comparison to the reports previously published, dealing with 
the effectiveness of homeopathy in animals, the current review 
encompasses a much higher number of studies. One reason is the 
fact that much time has passed between the first review by Kowalski 
(1989) and today. Apart from publications in peer-reviewed jour-
nals, the current review also included doctoral theses in German. 
this reflects the situation in German-speaking countries, where 
(for unknown reasons) homeopathy is more frequently used than 
in other countries (Kayne 2006, Mathie and others 2012, Albrecht 
2013, Allensbach institute for Public Opinion Research 2014). in their 
characterisation of research literature on veterinary homeopathy in 
preparation of following publications, Mathie and others (2012) did 
not define doctoral thesis as peer-reviewed as was done in this review. 
Due to the extended literature search using multiple sources, it can be 
assumed that nearly all peer-reviewed articles on homeopathy in live-
stock matching the search criteria were considered. thus, the current 
review can claim to be the most comprehensive review on homeopa-
thy in farm animals so far. 
Comparing the previous reports (Kowalski 1989, hektoen 2005, 
Rijnberk and Ramey 2007, Ruegg 2008) with this review’s findings, 
only a very small number of trials on animals were considered and the 
selection criteria were either unclear or not even stated. these facts 
may have caused the authors to be biased in their reporting of the 
results.
Contrary to the summary reports of the previous authors, Clausen 
and others (2013) and Mathie and Clausen (2014, 2015) published 
three articles exclusively on randomised placebo-controlled trials in 
veterinary medicine built upon each other. the main focus was on 
medical conditions, for example, randomisation, risk of bias according 
to Cochrane’s evidence-based medicine principles, individualised/non-
individualised treatments, and so on, to assess whether homeopathic 
interventions are distinguishable from corresponding treatments with 
placebo. they found two trials of 18 (2014) and 15 (2015), respec-
tively with reliable evidence, free from vested interest precluding gen-
eral conclusions about the efficacy of homeopathy and very limited 
evidence for differences between homeopathy and placebo within 
placebo-controlled RCt
s. the authors saw a need for a higher quality 
research on veterinary homeopathy
homeopathic trials performed as a single-blind or non-blind RCt, 
parallel groups or an observational trial (Fig 4) tended to be more fre-
quently efficacious than a double-blind RCt, indicating that positive 
outcomes may partly be due to a bias caused by a conscious or uncon-
scious preference for a certain treatment. the biggest proportion of 
the trials (79 per cent) were RCt
s – a high quality level according to 
the principles of evidence-based medicine and regarded as the standard 
for a remedy’s clinical proof of efficacy by the scientific community 
(van Sluijs 2005). this may lead to the general conclusion that home-
opathic remedies are able to support the healing process under certain 
conditions. however, the evidence-based medicine method is also 
prone to errors (eg, by a narrow scope of considered studies) producing 
misleading conclusions or results claiming efficacy where there might 
be none (Weymayr 2013). 
A critical point in the current methods of performing trials on effi-
cacy is that they are conducted under standardised conditions and do

not consider the situation animals actually experience on farms. the 
focus is mainly on the remedy without particular focus on the interac-
tions between animals and their living conditions, and their ability 
to react to a certain pathogen. the variability of the living conditions 
and of the pre-existing situations on farms are not considered either, 
for instance, regarding the appropriateness of diagnostics to determine 
the most suitable remedy or treatment procedure. thus, a certain rem-
edy which proved efficacious in a scientific trial may not be effective 
under farm conditions. 
no differences concerning the outcome were found in relation to 
the means of publication in scientific journals or as doctoral theses. 
the number of non-peer-reviewed publications found was more than 
double the number of peer-reviewed journals. Similar results were 
found by Clausen and others (2013), who evaluated all studies, collect-
ed by the homVetCR database on veterinary homeopathy, focusing 
on the content of placebo-controlled trials. the peer-reviewed studies 
were more often published in journals dedicated to homeopathy or 
alternative therapies than in journals on veterinary medicine in gen-
eral. it can be assumed that journals which focus on complementary 
and alternative therapies like homeopathy are rather more likely to 
receive articles dealing with this therapy. there is an increased risk 
for publication bias; for example, reports with positive results for a 
tested method or remedy are usually more likely to be published than 
those with negative results (Arlt and heuwieser 2010). in this evalua-
tion, articles published in journals focussing on alternative treatments 
were much more likely to present an efficacy (positive publication 
bias) while it was vice versa for articles in journals focussing more on 
conventional therapies (negative publication bias) but failed to provide 
statistically significant differences (OR 3.75, 95 per cent Ci 0.63 to 
22.04, P=0.14). 
Comparing the reasons why homeopathic remedies were used, 
positive results tended to occur more often for a preventive use (n=16 
of 28) than for a therapeutic (n=8 of 28) or a metaphylactic use (n=4 
of 28). Remarkably, when strictly following the simile-rules (‘like 
cures like’) of homeopathic treatment, a preventive effect is difficult to 
achieve because a complete homeopathic clinical picture is lacking and 
so is the matching remedy picture. the results of the trials contradict 
this principle, but may be an unspecific reaction of the immune sys-
tem to the stimulus (the remedy). A different case might be the special 
form of homeopathic remedy called ‘nosode’, manufactured using a 
sample of diseased matter as a basis (usually from a certain animal in 
the herd to be treated), highly diluted and mainly used for prevention. 
the dilution process reduces the amount of infective pathogens to 
almost zero but could possibly induce unspecific humoral immunity.
the most objective and scientific way to assess the outcome of 
treating a diseased animal is to perform a direct test (eg, on the pres-
ence or absence of the pathogens responsible) and this is best per-
formed by an official laboratory. Starting from this basis, the treat-
ment assessment methods can be listed as follows: direct test > indi-
rect test performed onsite > clinical signs > measurements. the list 
starts with the most scientific methods and ends with the least scien-
tific ones. the person performing the diagnostic procedures may well 
have judgement, which varies according to education and experience. 
the complexity of factors which results in a cure and the performance 
of different diagnostic measures might distort the resultant efficacy of 
a remedy applied. Expertise is a prerequisite in finding the appropriate 
remedy and helps inform any ongoing adaptations of the treatment 
when necessary. however, when any factors present which cause dis-
ease are left undiscovered and are not instantly removed, animals may 
still remain ill. if farm animals are kept under living conditions where 
their immune systems are under strain or exhausted, neither conven-
tional nor alternative remedies will be able to provide a sufficient cure 
rate.
While conventional medication focuses primarily on the indica-
tion, homeopathy addresses the individual reactions and symptoms 
arising in the first place. Correspondingly, to an extent the conven-
tional approach acts in a context-invariant way whereas the homeo-
pathic approach considers the context, particularly observing how 
animals behave in a specific situation. thus, an assessment of the 
effectiveness of homeopathic medication should not exclude the con-
text in which these remedies are employed. 
When compared in the same trial, there were differences in the 
therapeutic effect homeopathy and the placebo had. this ranged 
between 0 per cent and 27 per cent (Werner and others 2010, hornig 
2014). Sometimes relatively small and insignificant differences were 
found between the homeopathic remedy and the placebo groups in 
clinical trials. this raises the question whether the effects of home-
opathy are comparable to a placebo effect. nevertheless, 12 trials were 
performed above a dilution of 1:1024 and showed a positive outcome 
for the efficacy of the homeopathic remedy administered in relation 
to a control treatment. the efficacy of a placebo generally corresponds 
to the function of self-healing forces of the body without the influ-
ence of an active substance. therefore, a comparison of homeopathy 
with a placebo and an untreated group aids the distinction between 
the effect a placebo has and the self-healing effect. When aiming to 
find an alternative to an existing medicine, it is necessary to undertake 
trials with the above remedy, the proposed alternative and a placebo 
group in order to come up with valid results (European Medicines 
Agency 2001). this ensures that animals receive the most effective 
therapy possible.
in order to be considered as an alternative to antimicrobials in 
cases of bacterial infections, homeopathic remedies ought to be at 
least as effective. in 18 studies, a homeopathic treatment was com-
pared with an antimicrobial treatment. in several cases, the efficacy 
of the chosen homeopathic remedy was higher than the convention-
al treatment with antimicrobials. Differences between the cure rate 
of homeopathic and antibiotic treatment in a trial ranged between 
2 per cent (hektoen and others 2004) and 30 per cent (tiefenthaler 
1990) in favour of homeopathy. however, a comparable amount of 
trials reported homeopathic remedies as having poorer cure rates 
compared with the conventional treatment, with differences rang-
ing between 1 per cent to 55 per cent in the same trial (hektoen and 
others 2004, Walkenhorst 2006). in other studies, no significant dif-
ferences could be found in the cure between the experimental group 
treated with homeopathy and an antibiotic control group (Boerms 
1981, tiefenthaler 1990, Sandoval and others 1998). Furthermore, 
it has to be considered that in most trials no sensitivity tests on the 
bacterial resistance patterns of the bacteria responsible were per-
formed before choosing the antimicrobial for treatment. Performing 
a sensitivity test in the trials might have led to altering the drug 
selected, thus causing the antimicrobial tested to be more effective 
overall.
When taking the total number of studies into account, not even 
one study was repeated under comparable conditions. Consequently, 
the existing conditions, which enable a systematic review to be car-
ried out completely are not given. the current evidence of studies 
providing evidence in favour of homeopathy lacks reproducibility and 
therefore cannot claim to have sufficient prognostic validity. no gen-
eral conclusions can be drawn as to whether a homeopathic remedy 
shown to be significantly more effective than a control treatment in a 
specific context is also effective in a different context or under differ-
ent conditions (as the previous trial describes). it cannot be concluded 
whether it is better, worse or ineffective. 
the efficacy of a remedy cannot be reduced to the concentration 
of pharmaceutically active ingredients alone and cannot be isolated 
from the context in which it is used. it is the result of complex interac-
tions of various factors which include, among others: the individual’s 
immune strength and capacity to react to stimuli, the degree the main 
and any secondary causes are eliminated, an adequate diagnosis and 
an appropriate treatment (no matter of the kind), and, last but not 
least, the farm animals’ living conditions, especially in relation to 
nutrient supply and hygiene conditions. 
in practice, homeopathy may well not be applied according to a 
certain standard in diagnostic, treatment and education due, among 
other reasons, to the different level of homeopathic education of farm-
ers and veterinarians. however, it is also questionable whether con-
ventional medicine (eg, antibiotics) is always used according to the 
guidelines on the prudent use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine 
in farm practice as the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe (2014) 
recommend. Various publications indicate that farmers rarely instigate 
diagnostic tests to detect the pathogen responsible (Ouweltjes and oth-
ers 2008, Doehring and Sundrum 2013).

Conclusions 
in a considerable number of studies, a significant higher efficacy was 
recorded for homeopathic remedies than for a control group. therefore, 
the potential medical efficacy of homeopathy under certain conditions 
cannot be ruled out. however, this does not necessarily imply that 
homeopathic remedies are effective under different conditions. this is 
especially true for the context-sensitive treatment strategy of homeopa-
thy, which considers (beside clinical signs and the pathogen responsible) 
behaviour, constitution and conditions in which the animal is living in. 
the review revealed that all studies included were conducted under very 
specific conditions, but no trial was repeated in a comparable manner. 
thus, the previous studies cannot be generalised and have to be regarded 
as single-case studies. the first priority when medically treating ani-
mals should always be to apply the most effective treatment or remedy 
and thus prevent unnecessary suffering of the animal, if only for the 
reasons of animal welfare. Due to the unknown level of effectiveness 
of on-farm homeopathy, this can only be achieved by the appropriate 
control and monitoring of treatment success in farm practice. Due to a 
lack of prognostic validity, replacing or reducing antibiotics with home-
opathy currently cannot be recommended unless evidence of efficacy 
is reproduced by RCt
s and proven in various farm practice conditions.
