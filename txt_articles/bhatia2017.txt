IMPORTANCE Clinical guidelines advise against routine electrocardiograms (ECG) in low-risk,
asymptomatic patients, but the frequency and impact of such ECGs are unknown.
OBJECTIVE To assess the frequency of ECGs following an annual health examination (AHE)
with a primary care physician among patients with no known cardiac conditions or risk
factors, to explore factors predictive of receiving an ECG in this clinical scenario, and to
compare downstream cardiac testing and clinical outcomes in low-risk patients who did and
did not receive an ECG after their AHE.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based retrospective cohort study using
administrative health care databases from Ontario, Canada, between 2010/2011 and
2014/2015 to identify low-risk primary care patients and to assess the subsequent outcomes
of interest in this time frame. All patients 18 years or older who had no prior cardiac medical
history or risk factors who received an AHE.
EXPOSURES Receipt of an ECG within 30 days of an AHE.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was receipt of downstream cardiac
testing or consultation with a cardiologist. Secondary outcomes were death, hospitalization,
and revascularization at 12 months.
RESULTS A total of 3 629 859 adult patients had at least 1 AHE between fiscal years
2010/2011 and 2014/2015. Of these patients, 21.5% had an ECG within 30 days after an AHE.
The proportion of patients receiving an ECG after an AHE varied from 1.8% to 76.1% among
679 primary care practices (coefficient of quartile dispersion [CQD], 0.50) and from 1.1% to
94.9% among 8036 primary care physicians (CQD, 0.54). Patients who had an ECG were
significantly more likely to receive additional cardiac tests, visits, or procedures than those
who did not (odds ratio [OR], 5.14; 95% CI, 5.07-5.21; P < .001). The rates of death (0.19% vs
0.16%), cardiac-related hospitalizations (0.46% vs 0.12%), and coronary revascularizations
(0.20% vs 0.04%) were low in both the ECG and non-ECG cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite recommendations to the contrary, ECG testing after
an AHE is relatively common, with significant variation among primary care physicians.
Routine ECG testing seems to increase risk for a subsequent cardiology testing and
consultation cascade, even though the overall cardiac event rate in both groups was very low.

ow-value care, defined as care where there is a lack of
benefit or where the benefits are outweighed by the po-
tential risks, can lead to higher health care costs, pa-
tient inconvenience, and in some cases harm to patients.1-3
Resting electrocardiography (ECG) in low-risk patients under-
going an annual health examination (AHE) by a primary care
physician is an example of low-value care. In 2012, the United
States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recom-
mended against routine ECG screening in low-risk patients be-
cause there is inadequate evidence for the added utility of ECG
in the diagnosis of coronary disease.4 The Choosing Wisely
campaign, launched in 2012, also saw multiple specialty so-
cieties include a recommendation against noninvasive car-
diac testing in low-risk or asymptomatic patients in their top
5 lists of low-value tests, treatments, and procedures that phy-
sicians and patients should question.5
As interest in curbing low-value care increases, accurate
estimates of the utilization of low-value care and its costs and
impact on patient outcomes are vital.6 While prior research has
estimated the frequency of ECGs in selected low-risk patient
groups,population-wideusageofECGsinlow-riskpatientsand
in particular its impact on costs and cardiovascular outcomes
is unknown.7-9 Understanding the association between low-
valuecardiactestingandsubsequenthealthcareutilizationand
outcomes is essential in the face of concerns regarding rising
cardiovascular testing utilization.10,11
The aim of this study is to quantify the frequency of ECGs
ordered after an AHE in low-risk primary care patients with no
prior cardiac medical history. In addition, we examined
whether such ECGs are associated with subsequent cardiac
tests or consultations and/or patient outcomes.
Methods
Study Design and Data Sources
We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada,
using linked population-based administrative health care da-
tabases. The data sets were linked using unique encoded iden-
tifiers and analyzed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sci-
ences (ICES). Patients were included if they were an Ontario
residentwithavalidhealthcardnumberandhadatleast1claim
for an annual health examination (AHE) with a primary care
physician (ie, a family physician), between April 1, 2010, and
March 31, 2015. Index AHE claims were identified via Ontario
Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) billing codes for either a peri-
odic health visit (PHV) or an AHE conducted on a healthy adult
patient (aged 18 years or older).12 The general AHE code was
replaced by the PHV in 2013.13 Similar to an AHE with a healthy
patient, the newer PHV is defined as a service performed on
“healthypatientswhohavenoapparentmedicalproblems.The
physician and patient can use the appointment to discuss pre-
vention like screening for cancer and other health issues rel-
evanttotheindividualpatient’
smedicalhistoryandlifestyle.
”13
Beyond the PHV having differential billing codes for different
aged patients, there are no practical differences between the
AHE and PHV,13 and so both were considered interchange-
able for this anaylsis. We excluded patients residing in long-
term care or with incomplete demographic data. Patients with
physician visits, emergency department visits, or hospitaliza-
tions suggesting significant cardiovascular disease or cardio-
vascular risk within 3 years prior to their AHE were deemed
high-risk (eg, prior myocardial infarction, hypertension, dia-
betes) and excluded through application of diagnostic codes
from OHIP and International Statistical Classification of Dis-
eases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes
fromtheDischargeAbstractDatabase(DAD).7,14,15Patientswith
prior cardiac-related procedures (eg, aortic valve replace-
ment, coronary artery revascularization), hospitalizations, or
consultations were also excluded using ICD-10 and Canadian
Classification of Health Interventions (CCI) codes.14 We ex-
cluded patients with a history of diabetes and hypertension
using the Ontario Diabetes Database and the Ontario Hyper-
tension Database. eAppendix 1 in the Supplement details the
full extent of inclusion and exclusion criteria, including data
sources and associated codes.
Several data sources were used to define patient- and phy-
sician-level characteristics to describe the patient cohort and
create multivariable statistical models. Demographic data on
patients (ie, age, sex, rurality), were obtained from the Regis-
tered Persons Database (RDPB). Quintiles of median neigh-
borhood income were used to approximate patients’socio-
economic status.16 Any hospitalizations (except those for
cardiac-related reasons) within 3 years prior of the index ex-
amination were determined from DAD ICD-10 codes. OHIP and
DADwereusedtodeterminepatients’historyofcancer,chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, dementia,
mental illness, and rheumatoid arthritis within 3 years prior
to study entry. Whether or not a patient was rostered to a regu-
lar primary care physician was determined through cross-
referencing Client Agency Program Enrolment (CAPE) tables
and OHIP fee codes. Ontario introduced formal rostering in its
primary care patient enrolment models in 2001 and during the
study period most (70%) Ontarian patients were rostered.17
Physician-level variables were primarily identified by linking
physicians from patients’OHIP claims with the ICES Physi-
cians Database (IPDB) to determine physician sex, years since
graduation, and international medical graduate status. The
CAPEtablesandOHIPclaimswereusedtoclassifyprimarycare
practicegroups(herebyreferredtoaspractices).18,19Theseprac-
tices consisted of 3 or more physicians submitting joint claims
Key Points
Question How frequently are electrocardiograms (ECG) ordered
as part of an annual health examination (AHE) and what is the
impact of an ECG on downstream cardiac testing?
Findings In this population-based cohort study of 3 629 859 adult
patients who had an AHE, 21.5% had an ECG within 30 days of an
AHE. Those who had an ECG were 5 times more likely to have
another cardiac test or consultation than those who did not.
Meaning Electrocardiograms conducted on patients as part of an
AHE are common and are associated with more cardiac tests and
consultations.

 to the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care for reimburse-
ment (ie, billing groups).19 Payment models were noted and
any practices consisting of fewer than 3 physicians were ex-
cluded for privacy reasons.
Research ethics approval was received from Sunnybrook
Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Patient con-
sent was waived because all data were deidentified.
Low-Value Cardiac Care
The primary outcome was low-value cardiac care, defined as
patient receipt of at least 1 ECG within 30 days of a patient’
s
index AHE.8 Ontario Health Insurance Plan claims were used
to identify any electrocardiography performed on the patient
in that timeframe.
DownstreamcardiaccarewasidentifiedusingOHIPclaims.
Receipt of either a consultation with a cardiologist or cardiac
surgeon, transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), stress test,
nuclear stress test, and/or cardiac catheterization procedure
were measured where claims occurred within 90 days of an
eligible AHE.
Cardiac outcomes, including death, cardiac-related hos-
pitalizations, and coronary revascularization procedures were
captured within 12 months of the index AHE. Death was iden-
tified via the RPBD, whereas the latter events were identified
using DAD ICD-10 codes and CCI codes, respectively. Percuta-
neous coronary interventions (PCI) and coronary artery by-
pass grafts (CABG) were also identified using OHIP claims data.
Statistical Analysis
Unadjusted 30-day ECG rates were calculated separately at the
level of individual regions, practices, and physicians between
fiscal years 2010/2011 and 2014/2015. Regions were defined by
Ontario’
s 14 Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs)—
geographically organized administrative regions that plan, in-
tegrate, and fund local health care. Variation in ordering rates
wasassessedateachlevelbycalculatingthecoefficientofquar-
tile deviation, a potentially more robust alternative to the co-
efficient of variation.20 All statistical analyses were performed
using SAS statistical software (version 9.4, SAS Institute).
Hierarchical random-intercept multivariable logistic re-
gression models were used to assess the association of pa-
tient- and physician-level characteristics with the occurrence
of an ECG within 30 days post-AHE. Owing to the physician-
levelcharacteristicsincludedinthesemodels,onlypatientswho
could be linked to a family physician belonging to an identifi-
able practice were included. To test the sensitivity of our pri-
mary outcome definition, we ran a similar analysis including
only patients that had an ECG on the same day as an AHE.
Through inclusion of random intercepts for each prac-
tice, it was possible to calculate the median odds ratio (MOR),
a measure of the heterogeneity in ordering a post-AHE ECG
among practices.21-23 If one were to repeatedly sample 2 par-
ticipants with the same covariates from different practices ran-
domly, then the MOR is the relative odds difference between
the participant at higher risk of receiving an ECG and the par-
ticipant at the lower risk of receiving an ECG in the median
case.21-23 The MOR always has a value greater than or equal to
1 because it places the patient belonging to the practice with
higheroddsoforderinganECGinthenumerator.21-23Thevalue
is directly comparable to a fixed effects OR, and is based on a
between-practicevarianceestimatethatisadjustedforallother
factors present in a multilevel model.21 For example, a MOR
of 2.00 suggests, in the median case, 100% higher odds of re-
ceiving an ECG at 1 practice vs another.23 The intracluster cor-
relation coefficient (ICC) was also calculated using the linear
threshold method to estimate the proportion of total vari-
ance in ECG ordering that can be attributed to between-
practice differences.21-23
In addition, hierarchical random-intercept multivariable
logistic regression models were used to assess the impact of
having postvisit ECG on downstream cardiac care and ad-
verse patient outcomes. For each of these additional models,
receipt of an ECG within 30 days post-AHE was the primary
exposure of interest and included as a covariate. To account
for the possibility that a physician’
s propensity to order low-
value ECGs may be associated with the propensity to order
downstream care we determined each physician’
s ECG order-
ing rate (ie, the proportion of patient AHEs with an ECG or-
dered within 30 days) and then created a variable that strati-
fied physicians into quintiles based on their individual rates.
This factor representing physician ECG ordering quintile was
then included in the regression models for both downstream
care and outcomes.

 low-value ECG within 30 days of their index AHE, 51.7% of ECG
claims occurred on the same day as the AHE, and 78.5% of ECG
claims were within 7 days of an AHE. Patients who had at least
1 ECG in the defined follow-up period were more likely to be
male and were generally older than those who did not have
an ECG. The comorbidity burden was low for the entire co-
hort, though there were some statistically significant differ-
ences between groups.
Variation by Region, Practice, and Physician
Regional variation of ECG ordering ranged from a low of 0.7%
in the North West LHIN to 24.4% in the Central LHIN (coeffi-
cient of quartile deviation [CQD], 0.71) (eAppendix 2.0 in the
Supplement). Among 679 practices, the proportion of pa-
tients who received an ECG post-AHE ranged from 1.8% to
76.1% (CQD, 0.50) as shown in Figure 2. Substantial variation
was also observed across individual primary care physicians
(range, 1.1%-94.9%; CQD, 0.54) as shown in eAppendix 2.1 in
the Supplement. Among the 8036 primary care physicians in-
cluded, 7.2% ordered ECGs on more than 50% of their pa-
tients following an AHE.
Factors Associated With Ordering an ECG Post-AHE
From the initial study cohort detailed in Figure 1, a total of
2 873 357 adult patients who reported belonging to, and could
be linked to, an established practice were eligible for model-
ing of post-AHE ECG receipt status.
As described in Table 2, older age was associated with in-
creased odds of having an ECG within 30 days after an AHE.
Patients living in a rural area were less likely to have an ECG
than those living in urban areas. Patients with rheumatologi-
cal disease and cancer had increased odds of having an ECG.
Physician factors associated with ECG ordering were male sex,
internationalmedicalgraduatestatus,andhavingpracticedfor
longer than 30 years. The interpractice variation in ECG or-
dering was significant. The MOR was 2.50, indicating that the
odds of a patient having a post-AHE ECG at 1 randomly se-
lected high-ordering practice were 150% greater than a pa-
tient with the same characteristics at another randomly se-
lected,low-orderingpractice.Asidefrompatientage,theeffect
of a patients’practice membership on receipt of an ECG was
stronger than the association observed between the outcome

 and any other patient- or physician-level factors. The ICC es-
timate indicates that 21.9% of the total variation in post-AHE
ECG use can be attributed to practice-level variation. Based on
the sensitivity analysis, all of the characteristics significantly
associated with increased odds of having an ECG at 30 days
post-AHE were similarly associated with same-day receipt of
an ECG (eAppendix 2.2 in the Supplement).
Association of Post-AHE ECG With Downstream Cardiac Care
Overall,5.3%ofpatientswithanAHEhadacardiac-relatedcon-
sultation, test, or procedure within 90 days following their pri-
mary care physician AHE. Cardiac care included consulta-
tions with a cardiologist or cardiac surgeon (n = 36 085),
transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE, n = 83 463), stress tests
(n = 42 923), nuclear stress tests (n = 15 651), and cardiac cath-
eterizations (n = 1830).
Table 3 presents the final multivariable models for down-
stream cardiac care. After adjusting for physician ECG order-
ing quintile, patients with an ECG within 30 days of an AHE
had significantly higher odds of having further cardiac tests
or consultations compared with those who did not. There was
significantinterpracticevariationinorderingdownstreamcare
(cardiac consultations: MOR, 1.47; ICC, 4.7%; TTEs: MOR, 1.60;
ICC,6.85%),andeitherformofstresstest(stresstest:MOR,1.71;
ICC, 8.85%; nuclear stress test: MOR, 1.56; ICC, 6.23%). Car-
diac catheterization rate was low (0.29% vs non-ECG 0.03%)
and attempts to model resulted in nonconvergence in the sta-
tistical software (eAppendix 2.3 in the Supplement). Sensitiv-
ityanalysesforECGsconductedonthesamedayshowedasimi-
lar association with higher odds of ordering additional cardiac
testing within 90 days (eAppendix 2.4 in the Supplement).
Theoverallratesofadverseclinicaloutcomesat1-yearpost-
AHE were extremely low in both groups. The unadjusted rate
of each outcome was higher in the ECG vs the non-ECG group,
including death (0.19% vs 0.16%), cardiac-related hospitaliza-
tions(0.46%vs0.12%),andcoronaryrevascularizations(0.20%
vs 0.04%) (eAppendix 2.5 in the Supplement). Only the de-
scriptive statistics are presented for these outcomes because
their corresponding regression models each failed to con-
verge in the statistical software.
Discussion
In this large, retrospective cohort study, we found that de-
spite recommendations against ECGs in low-risk patients un-
dergoingaroutineAHEwithaprimarycarephysician,thisprac-
ticeseemedtobecommon.Importantly,wedemonstratedthat
patients who received an ECG 30 days post-AHE were more
than 5 times more likely to also receive another cardiac test,
procedure, or consultation with a specialist. These down-
stream cardiac tests and procedures also demonstrated sig-
nificantpracticevariationevenafteradjustmentforpatientand
physicianfactors.Finally,bothgroupsofpatientsexhibitedlow
combined rates of death, cardiac-related hospitalizations, and
coronary revascularizations in the ensuing year.
These findings support earlier results that show high rates
of potentially low-value ECGs in primary care patients. Previ-
ous studies have shown the frequency of ECGs in low-risk pa-
tients to be between 9% to 12% in various populations, includ-
ingbothMedicareandcommercialpayers,withsimilardegrees
of regional variation to this study.7-9 Where this study differs
isthatitincludesanentirepopulationfromasingle-payer,pub-
licly funded system, allowing for a more robust analysis of or-
dering practices. We also found significant variation in order-
ingbetweenregions,practices,andevenphysiciansthatcannot
be explained by patient factors such as comorbidities. This
striking ordering variation, which has been noted in both pri-
mary care and hospital-based ordering practices in previous
work, provides potential opportunities for improvements in

ordered ECGs on most of their patients.24,25 Most impor-
tantly, we demonstrate that ECGs in this low-risk population
leads to further downstream cardiac testing and consulta-

 tions in patients who had an ECG. The diagnostic cascade is
a described phenomenon where higher rates of noninvasive
diagnostic testing lead to higher rates of more invasive diag-
nostic testing and therapeutic interventions.26-29 For
example, Shah and colleagues26 found higher rates of rou-
tine stress testing after coronary revascularization lead to
higher rates of repeated revascularization with no impact on
death or repeated myocardial infarction. To date, however,
this finding has not been shown in resting ECG testing,
which is most commonly done in primary care offices in
patients who often do not have a medical history of cardiac
disease. The higher rates of further testing or consultations,
like ECG ordering, were independent of patient comorbidi-
ties; it is probable that incidentally discovered abnormalities
found on ECG precipitated further testing and cardiology
consultations.
The low event rates in patients who received and did not
receive an ECG as part of an AHE add more evidence to the rec-
ommendation against using ECGs as a risk stratification tool.
Systematic reviews have found no randomized clinical trials
or large prospective cohort studies on the effects of ECGs or-
dered in low-risk patients vs no ECG on clinical outcomes or
costs.4,30 Despite this lack of evidence there still remains some
debate as to the utility of ECGs as a risk stratification tool.29
Our findings in a large, population-based cohort study show
very low event rates that were less than 1% in both groups, de-
spite higher rates of cardiovascular investigations in the ECG
group. This data lends further evidence to the current guide-
lines recommending against routine ECGs in low-risk pa-
tients, which appear to lead to higher health care utilization
with questionable clinical benefit.
The results of this study have considerable health care
policy implications. First, when selecting overuse metrics for
qualityimprovementinitiatives,considerationshouldbegiven
to the impact on downstream testing and outcomes.31,32 Some
of the past criticism of the Choosing Wisely recommenda-
tionsisthattheyareoftenofseeminglylittleconsequence,with
specialty societies avoiding big-ticket items like surgical pro-
cedures,ormoreadvanceddiagnostictests.33Ourfindingssug-
gest that even low-cost procedures, like ECGs in low-risk pa-
tients occur with considerable frequency, and importantly can
lead to more advanced testing that adds costs with little po-
tential benefit to patients. Second, measurement of low-
valuecareshouldalsoattempttoquantifytheimpactonhealth
outcomes for patients.6 Finally, quality improvement inter-
ventions to reduce low-value care could be designed to more
effectively target practices and physicians with high ordering
rates to reduce the prevalence of low-value cardiac testing, and
the unexplained ordering variation.34 In particular, prior re-
search has shown that the use of audit and feedback, deci-
sion support tools, and education could reduce low-value car-
diac testing, and similar types of interventions could be used
in some combination to reduce low-value care.24,35-37
Limitations
The results must be interpreted in the context of several limi-
tations. Administrative databases do not provide important
clinical information, such as presence of symptoms or abnor-
mal physical examination findings that are necessary to de-
termine appropriateness of further testing orders. In this in-
stance, we are unable to determine whether a patient had an
ECG for screening, or if the patient had symptoms or signs that
warranted a diagnostic test. However, usually a visit will not
be coded as an AHE if there is a specific cardiac symptom that
is the focus of the assessment. It is also possible that some phy-
sicians ordered an ECG prior to the AHE that were not cap-
tured.WealsodonothavetheresultsoftheECGs,whichwould
almost certainly have influenced further cardiac investiga-
tions. Finally, it is possible that practice or regional factors
not identified by available data may play a role in the degree
of ordering variation seen, which may be an opportunity for
future studies. Despite these limitations, this study provides
important new information about the use and impact of low-
value cardiac testing in the primary care setting.
Conclusions
In this large, population-based retrospective study, we found
21.5% of low-risk patients received an ECG within 30 days fol-
lowing an AHE, with significant regional-, practice-, and phy-
sician-levelorderingvariation.Moreover,low-riskpatientswho
received an ECG also had a higher likelihood of further car-
diac tests, procedures, and cardiologist consultations.
