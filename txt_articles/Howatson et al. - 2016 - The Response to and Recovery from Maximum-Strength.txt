Abstract 
28 
There is a great deal of research on the responses to resistance training; however, 
29 
information on the responses to strength and power training conducted by elite 
30 
strength and power athletes is sparse. Purpose: To establish the acute and 24 hour 
31 
neuromuscular and kinematic responses to Olympic-style barbell strength and power 
32 
exercise in elite athletes. Methods: Ten elite track and field athletes completed a 
33 
series of 3 back squat exercises each consisted of 4 x 5 repetitions. These were done 
34 
as either strength or power sessions on separate days. Surface electromyography 
35 
(sEMG), bar velocity and knee angle was monitored throughout these exercises and 
36 
maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), jump height, central activation ratio (CAR) 
37 
and lactate were measured pre, post and 24 hours thereafter. Results: Repetition 
38 
duration, impulse and total work were greater (p<0.01) during strength sessions, with 
39 
mean power being greater (p<0.01) following the power sessions. Lactate increased 
40 
(p<0.01) following strength but not power sessions.  sEMG increased (p<0.01) across 
41 
sets for both sessions, with the strength session increasing at a faster rate (p<0.01) and 
42 
with greater activation (p<0.01) by the end of the final set . MVC declined (p<0.01) 
43 
following the strength and not the power session, which remained suppressed 
44 
(p<0.05) 24 hours later; whereas CAR and jump height remained unchanged. 
45 
Conclusion: A greater neuromuscular and metabolic demand following the strength 
46 
and not power session is evident in elite athletes, which impaired maximal force 
47 
production up to 24 hours.  This is an important consideration for planning concurrent 
48 
athletic training.

Introduction 
50 
Elite strength and power athletes use very specific resistance exercises to develop the 
51 
physical attributes of maximum strength and maximum power. Sessions comprising 
52 
high intensity (> 80% maximum load) and low repetitions (two to six) are often 
53 
performed to develop maximum strength.1 Adaptations to maximum strength training 
54 
involve increased muscle fibre cross sectional area2 and increased neural drive.3 
55 
Conversely, lower load exercises performed at higher velocities are performed to 
56 
develop power.4 Power-type training also improves neural drive, particularly motor 
57 
unit activation,5 and increases the ability to generate force during higher velocity, 
58 
dynamic movements.6 Consequently, the adaptations following resistance exercise 
59 
occur in both central and peripheral areas of the neuromuscular system and are largely 
60 
specific to the training performed.  
61 
Fatigue can be globally defined as an exercise-induced decline in the ability to 
62 
generate maximal voluntary muscle force7 and is associated with reductions in central 
63 
activation and neural drive, which are thought to provide (at least in part) the 
64 
necessary stimulus for adaptations to strength training8. In addition, increased surface 
65 
electromyographic (sEMG) amplitude during resistance exercise is indicative of 
66 
greater motor unit recruitment and therefore provides the required stimulus for an 
67 
adaptive response.9,10  Interestingly, the neuromuscular responses to strength and 
68 
power training have been examined in recreational athletes,8,10 but very little 
69 
information regarding elite athletes exist. Previous work has studied neuromuscular 
70 
fatigue and recovery following very high intensity (20 x 1RM) and high volume (10 x 
71 
10RM) resistance exercise sessions8,11 and found decreases in MVC for males and 
72 
females immediately following the sessions, with incomplete recovery 24 h post-
73 
session.   
74 
 4 
 
A better understanding of the neuromuscular consequences following maximum 
75 
strength and power resistance exercise might better inform the training plan in order 
76 
to optimise adaptation, particularly in elite athletes. Additionally, the degree and 
77 
nature of fatigue will likely determine the recovery time required, influencing the type 
78 
of physical or technical training that is suitable following, or in conjunction with 
79 
resistance exercise.  For example, knowledge of neuromuscular function 24 h 
80 
following maximum strength and power type resistance exercise will help coaches 
81 
plan day-to-day sessions, given the multiple types of training that can occur across the 
82 
cycle.  
83 
In the present study we had a rare opportunity to recruit elite athletes and expose them 
84 
to the ‘typical’ training stimulus of Olympic-style barbell exercises that are regularly 
85 
employed by elite track and field athletes (>10 sets)12,13 when targeting the 
86 
development of maximum strength and power.  Therefore, the primary purpose of this 
87 
study was to examine the acute neuromuscular and kinematic responses to maximum 
88 
strength and power type resistance exercise and the subsequent 24 h recovery.  The 
89 
second aim was to examine male and female responses within this elite group, which 
90 
might help inform whether the responses differ between sexes.  
91 
 
92 
Methods 
93 
Subjects 
94 
Following institutional ethical approval, 10 performance programme athletes (Table 
95 
1) were recruited from UK Athletics Olympic Performance Centre, Lee Valley, 
96 
London and health-screened before providing written informed consent. All 
97 
 5 
 
volunteers were international standard sprinters or horizontal jumpers who regularly 
98 
partook in barbell strength training. 
99 
A schematic of the experimental design is presented in Figure 1. The trials were 
100 
completed following the competitive season when no sport-specific training was 
101 
occurring. Following familiarisation athletes performed a maximum strength or power 
102 
session in a randomised cross-over design within a seven day period. Each visit was 
103 
preceded with at least one rest day.  Females were assessed during the luteal phase of 
104 
the menstrual cycle to limit hormonal variation on performance.  
105 
After arriving at the testing centre in a fasted state, blood lactate measures were taken 
106 
(Lactate Pro, ARK Corp, Japan) and consumed a standardised breakfast. The training 
107 
commenced with 10 minute warm up at 100 W on a cycle ergometer (Keiser M3, 
108 
Keiser Corp, USA). Subjects performed the pre-session neuromuscular (NM) tests, 
109 
comprising isometric knee extension force assessment (MVC), central activation ratio 
110 
assessment (CAR) and a vertical jump test (CMJ).  The maximum strength or power 
111 
session was then performed; whole body barbell squat, split squat and press exercises.  
112 
These exercises were selected as commonly used exercises employed by UK strength 
113 
and conditioning coaches in delivering maximum strength and power programmes to 
114 
elite athletes. 
115 
During each session, surface electromyography (EMG), barbell displacement and 
116 
knee flexion (determined with electrogoniometry) were recorded.  Based on a prior 
117 
pilot investigation, blood lactate was collected 4 minutes following the completion of 
118 
the final set to determine peak post-exercise lactate concentration. Ten minutes 
119 
following the session, CMJ, MVC and CAR tests were repeated to assess the 
120 
influence of the session on muscle function.14 On completion of each session subjects 
121 
provided a session RPE rating, using the Borg scale.  To examine recovery following 
122 
 6 
 
the maximum strength and power sessions, subjects returned to the testing centre the 
123 
following day where MVC, CAR and CMJ assessments were performed following the 
124 
aforementioned warm up procedure.  
125 
Subjects attended familiarisation not more than seven days before the initial trial.  
126 
This included full instruction and practice of the MVC, CAR and CMJ assessments.  
127 
In addition, barbell loads were determined for the maximum strength session of squat, 
128 
split squat and push press.  For each exercise, a series of incrementally loaded sets of 
129 
five repetitions were performed, starting at a self-selected ‘moderate’ load, separated 
130 
by three minutes rest between sets. At the end of each set, the intensity was rated 
131 
(RPE), using the Borg scale (6 to 20). The load corresponding to an active muscle 
132 
RPE = 16 or 17 (very hard) enabled the subjects’ exercise to be matched for relative 
133 
intensity.15 Whilst percentage of repetition maximum loads are often used, the use of 
134 
RPE enables the determination of a load that is repeatable across all sets within the 
135 
session and akin to training methods used by UK elite track and field athletes.16 
136 
Immediately prior to the warm up subjects were fitted with an electrogoniometer 
137 
(TDA-100, Biopac Systems Inc., USA) attached to the lateral aspect of the left knee 
138 
to determine the beginning and end of the concentric phase of the movement and 
139 
synched with other instruments (such as EMG and the potentiometer) to determine the 
140 
kinematics and the relevant epoch could be identified across sessions.  Barbell 
141 
displacement was measured using a potentiometer (Celesco PT5A, USA) attached to 
142 
the barbell to estimate power during the lifting phase.17  For the squat, speed squat, 
143 
split squat and split squat jump repetition, the mean power was calculated from the 
144 
whole concentric phase. For push and power press, the power calculation was limited 
145 
to the period where the knee angle was decreasing and displacement was increasing.  
146 
Power was calculated offline, where, force (load) = system mass × (acceleration + 
147 
 7 
 
9.812), then, power = force (load) × velocity. This was used to compare changes in 
148 
power within sets during each session.  
149 
The duration of the combined lowering and lifting movement were used to define 
150 
repetition duration of each exercise.  From repetition duration and the derived force 
151 
values, impulse was calculated as the integral of force over time. In addition, total 
152 
work was obtained as the integral of power. Mean set values for concentric mean 
153 
power, repetition duration, impulse and total work were determined from the average 
154 
of the five repetitions.  Total work performed during the entire maximum strength and 
155 
power sessions were also compared; all calculations were computed off line 
156 
(AcqKnowledge® 3.8.1, Biopac Systems Inc., USA). 
157 
Surface EMG (sEMG) was continually monitored throughout the strength and power 
158 
sessions. The appropriate area was shaved, abraded and cleaned; 10-mm-diameter 
159 
electrodes (PNS Dual Element Electrode; Vermed, Vermont, USA), with 10-mm 
160 
inter-electrode distance were attached to the right vastus lateralis with the ground 
161 
electrode attached to the patella.18 The EMG data were sampled at 2000 Hz and 
162 
filtered using 1 Hz - 500 Hz band pass filter.  The root-mean-squared (RMS) 
163 
amplitude was processed from the raw EMG amplitude using a 100 ms, overlapping 
164 
window.  RMS amplitude values were normalised to the value obtained from 
165 
repetition one within each set.   
166 
The subjects performed the knee extension MVC force and CAR test as one combined 
167 
assessment, using an isokinetic dynamometer (Kin Com, Chattanooga, USA). 
168 
Subjects were positioned according to the manufacturer’s recommendations with 70° 
169 
of knee flexion from full extension. Following three warm up contractions of 
170 
increasing intensity, subjects were instructed to produce three, 7 s ‘ramp’ contractions 
171 
(whereby maximum force was reached within 4 s) with 60 s rest between test 
172 
 8 
 
contractions. Visual feedback, and strong verbal encouragement was provided 
173 
throughout.  The trial resulting in greatest voluntary force was used for data analysis 
174 
and was processed as the mean value from a 200 ms window centred upon the peak 
175 
force value. 
176 
During one randomly chosen MVC, and without warning, central activation ratio 
177 
(CAR) was determined by percutaneous stimulation (StimISOC, Biopac Systems Inc, 
178 
USA) of the femoral nerve with 250 ms, 100 Hz tetanic pulse train,19 the intensity of 
179 
which was determined during the familiarisation session; the optimum position was 
180 
marked to ensure consistent placement on subsequent visits. The CAR was 
181 
determined from the peak force prior to stimulation and the peak force during the 
182 
stimulation;20 from this, CAR = (MVC force / superimposed stimulated force) x 100. 
183 
Three maximal counter movement jumps (CMJ) were then performed with a 30 s 
184 
pause between each.  Subjects held a wooden stick across the shoulders during the 
185 
jump to remove extraneous use of the arms.  The stick also enabled the potentiometer 
186 
(Celesco PT5A, USA) to directly measure jump height.  The peak CMJ height from 
187 
the three trials was used for data analysis. 
188 
Following the warm up and pre-session assessments, two sets of squat were 
189 
performed at a self-determined ‘moderate’ intensity in order to provide an exercise-
190 
specific warm up prior to the sessions. A series of three exercises Using Olympic 
191 
barbells, each exercise consisting of four sets of five repetitions, with three minutes 
192 
rest between sets were completed, which accurately reflected elite training sessions 
193 
for strength and power athletes on the Team GB Olympic track and field programme. 
194 
Constant feedback was given to the athletes regarding range of movement, timing and 
195 
speed during both sessions. 
196 
 9 
 
During the maximum strength session, the squat, split squat and push press were 
197 
performed, in that order, using the pre-determined loads.  The squat was performed 
198 
with the bar resting across the shoulders, feet shoulder width apart and squatting 
199 
down until the hips lowered to below knee and then standing back up during the 
200 
concentric phase.  The split squat also involved squatting and raising, with the barbell 
201 
resting upon the shoulders; however, the right foot was forward with the left foot 
202 
back.  The movement involved squatting down, flexing at the hip and knee of the 
203 
front leg and the knee of the back leg, whilst keeping the trunk upright.  The push 
204 
press was performed with feet shoulder width apart and holding the barbell in the 
205 
hands across the front of the shoulders.  The movement comprised a small squat down 
206 
followed by synchronously pressing the bar over the head whilst standing back up.  
207 
Subjects were instructed to perform the concentric phase of all movements over two 
208 
seconds, which was controlled by a metronome.   
209 
During the power session the speed squat, split squat jump and power press were 
210 
performed with 30% of the barbell load used in the maximum strength session.5,21 
211 
During the speed squats, subjects were instructed to perform the eccentric and 
212 
concentric repetition cycle as fast as possible, with a minimal jump in order to 
213 
maximise repetition speed.  Subjects performed the split squat jumps and power press 
214 
with maximum acceleration in the concentric phase, following a controlled lowering 
215 
phase. 
216 
All data are presented as mean ±SD. Differences between sessions for MVC, CAR, 
217 
and CMJ were examined using a two factor (session, 2 × time, 3) repeated measures 
218 
ANOVA, with one less level for lactate. Differences in sEMG between and within 
219 
session a three factor (session, 2 × set, 4 × rep, 5) ANOVA was used. A further three 
220 
factor ANOVA  (session, 2 × exercise, 3 × set, 4) was used to determine differences 
221 
 10 
 
in power, impulse, repetition duration and total work. Where necessary, effects were 
222 
followed by Tukey’s post-hoc tests. Given the gender differences, we explored post-
223 
session changes in MVC between male and female athletes using an independent 
224 
samples t-test.  In addition, regression analysis assessed the relationship between the 
225 
post-session relative MVC and squat load, and also the relationship between the post-
226 
session relative MVC and the system mass (Barbell Load + (0.88 x body mass)) 
227 
load used during the power sessions, expressed in relation to the maximum strength 
228 
load.  All data were performed on statistical software (Minitab v.15, USA); 
229 
significance was accepted at α = 0.05. Where appropriate, 95% lower and upper 
230 
confidence intervals (CI) and Cohen’s d effect sizes (ES) calculated by: Cohen's d = 
231 
Mean1 - Mean2 / SDpooled, where SDpooled = √[(SD 12+ SD 22) / 2]. ES were then 
232 
interpreted as <0.2 = trivial, 0.2-0.5 = small, 0.5-0.8 = moderate, >0.8 = large. Where 
233 
significant and non significant main effects are described the mean ES and CI, 
234 
between conditions, across all time points are presented. 
235 
 
236 
Results 
237 
Significant interaction between the exercises and sessions were found for repetition 
238 
duration (F = 18.13, p<0.001) impulse (F = 97.47, p < 0.001), total work (F = 8.38, p 
239 
= 0.004) and mean power (F = 77.37, p < 0.001) – Table 2.  Post hoc tests showed 
240 
impulse and repetition duration were greater and power was less (p < 0.01; impulse 
241 
speed squat ES: 3.6, CI: 2.06 to 4.82; split squat ES: 4.4, CI: 2.62 to 5.76; press push 
242 
ES: 2.3, CI: 1.13 to 3.38) during all three exercises in the maximum strength session 
243 
compared to the equivalent power session.  Post hoc tests between equivalent 
244 
exercises showed that only squat exercise had greater total work than the speed squat.  
245 
However, the total work performed during the entire maximum strength session was 
246 
 11 
 
significantly greater (F = 3.65, p = 0.008; ES: 1.34, CI: 0.32 to 2.29) than the power 
247 
session. 
248 
Lactate (Figure 2.) showed a session and a session by time interaction effect (F = 57.56, 
249 
p<0.001).  Lactate values post- maximum strength session were higher than baseline 
250 
(6.86 ± 2.2 versus 0.94 ± 0.2 mmol.L-1; ES: 3.8, CI: 2.2 to 5.06), whilst post-power 
251 
session lactate was relatively unchanged (0.89 ± 0.2 versus 1.2 ± 0.3 mmol.L-1; ES: 1.2, 
252 
CI: -2.11 to -0.22).  Post-session RPE was higher (t = 11.92, p = 0.012; ES: 2.8, CI: 1.46 
253 
to 3.87) following the strength (16.5 ± 1.8) versus the power session (11.2 ± 2.0). 
254 
Repetition sEMG (Figure 3.) increased within sets for both sessions (F = 18.76, p < 
255 
0.001; ES: 0.28, CI: 0.035 to 0.36).  For example, during set four of the maximum 
256 
strength session, sEMG increased (relative to repetition one of each set) to 116.5 ± 
257 
14.3%, 125.8 ± 15.6% and 125.8 ± 15.6% for squat, split squat and push press, 
258 
respectively.  During set four of the power session RMS increased to 121.1 ± 18.5%, 
259 
102.0 ± 13.1%, and 112.7 ± 16.2% for speed squat, split squat jump and power press, 
260 
respectively.  There were session by set interaction effects (F = 4.78, p = 0.029); post-
261 
hoc tests revealed repetitions four and five were higher to repetition one (p<0.01; mean 
262 
ES: 0.26, mean CI: 0.0255 to 0.3472) during all sets of maximum strength session, 
263 
whereas repetitions four and five were only different during set one of the power session. 
264 
There were no differences in pre-session values between maximum strength and 
265 
power session on any variable showing that athletes were in a similar physical 
266 
condition between sessions (MVC- ES: 0.03, CI: -0.92 to 0.83; CAR-ES: 0.34,      CI: 
267 
-1.21 to 0.55; CMJ – ES: 0.19, CI: -0.69 to 1.07) (Table 3).  There was a significant 
268 
effect of the session on MVC (F = 9.37, p = 0.014) and across time (F = 7.83, p = 
269 
0.004). Post-hoc analysis revealed that following the strength session MVC was lower 
270 
than pre strength MVC (p < 0.01; ES: 0.4, CI: -0.49 to 1.28) with no significant 
271 
 12 
 
decline (ES: 0.17, CI: -0.71 to 1.04) demonstrated following the power session. 
272 
Importantly, MVC was still depressed by a small amount 24 h following strength 
273 
session (p < 0.05; ES: 0.23, CI: -0.66 to 1.10), whereas the restoration of MVC at 24 
274 
h post-power session was largely resolved.  There were no main effects or interactions 
275 
for CAR (ES: 0.24 CI: -1.11 to 0.65) or CMJ height (ES: 0.13 CI: -0.75 to 1.00). 
276 
The relative change in MVC for male (n = 6) and female (n = 4) subjects, expressed 
277 
as a percentage of pre-session values, was 89.9 ± 9.3% versus 86.9 ± 5.8% post the 
278 
maximum strength session and 98.6 ± 5.9% versus 86.4 ± 7.5% post the power 
279 
session, respectively.  T-test revealed the female subjects suffered significantly 
280 
greater decrement, albeit by a trivial amount, in MVC post-power session compared 
281 
to the males (t = 2.88, p = 0.02; ES: 1.8, CI: -0.23 to -0.00979). 
282 
There was a significant relationship (r2 = 0.705, p < 0.01) between the athletes’ strength 
283 
during the squat exercise (determined as the system mass (bar mass + body mass) 
284 
divided by body mass) and relative change in MVC (Figure 4A).  In addition, there was 
285 
a significant relationship (r2 = 0.744, p<0.001) between the change in post-power 
286 
session MVC (Figure 4B) and the relative load used during the power session in 
287 
comparison to maximum strength session.  
288 
 
289 
Discussion  
290 
This study investigated the consequences of strength and power sessions in elite track 
291 
and field athletes.  These data show increased neuromuscular activity throughout both 
292 
training sessions, but there is an acute and prolonged (24 h post-session) reduction in 
293 
function following the maximum strength training results, but not power. 
294 
 13 
 
The important findings were reduced MVC immediately following strength but not 
295 
power sessions, whilst there were no changes in CAR or CMJ height.  This is most 
296 
readily explained by greater total work during strength vs. power session, 
297 
accompanied by greater post-session lactate, suggesting greater metabolic challenge.  
298 
This difference in decline following maximum strength and power concur with our 
299 
previous results16 and from those studies using machine-based exercise sessions with 
300 
non-elite exercisers.21 The reduction in MVC with no change in CAR suggests 
301 
peripheral rather than central fatigue mechanisms were the dominant cause of MVC 
302 
decline.22 This observation disagrees with previous work,8 based upon sEMG 
303 
changes, that nervous system fatigue occurred.21 However, other research using 
304 
similar methods to the present study found no evidence of central fatigue following 
305 
three sets of elbow flexion resistance exercise.23  Consequently, comparing with these 
306 
data on non-elite subjects might be somewhat futile given the obvious differences in 
307 
training status; nonetheless it seems that structured resistance exercise, designed for 
308 
maximum strength adaptation, result primarily in peripheral fatigue that is not evident 
309 
following sessions designed to enhance maximum power. 
310 
Although previous findings are somewhat contradictory, the sport-specific training 
311 
response in the current investigation has hitherto, not been reported for elite athletes.  
312 
Muscle function assessments were conducted 10-minutes following completion of the 
313 
final set, rather than immediately following the final repetition where ischemia or 
314 
muscle pH changes could influence action potential propagation and contractile 
315 
function, thus influencing outcome measures.24 The choice of assessment timing 
316 
could influence CAR measurement, as central fatigue recovers quickly post-
317 
exercise.25 Therefore, it is conceivable that central fatigue was present immediately 
318 
after training, but was resolved before the 10-minute post-exercise assessment.  
319 
 14 
 
Nonetheless, it was surprising that high intensity resistance exercise did not result in 
320 
central fatigue given the neuromuscular system is heavily implicated in adaptation to 
321 
maximum strength and power training.3,26  It is also conceivable that central fatigue 
322 
per se is not necessary to induce an adaptive response and we speculate that the 
323 
ability to recruit the target areas of the neuromuscular system during the session is 
324 
arguably the most important element of resistance exercise in elite athletes.  
325 
During both the maximum strength and power sessions, RMS increased within the 
326 
sets, with no concomitant change in mean power. This indicates greater recruitment 
327 
and/or firing rates, possibly of larger non-fatigued motor units.  Somewhat intuitively, 
328 
RMS increased more during strength than the power sessions, suggesting greater 
329 
neuromuscular activation to maintain repetition performance, compared to lower load 
330 
higher velocity repetitions.25,27 The peripheral fatigue indicated by decreased MVC, 
331 
could be attributed to localised muscle damage, although in trained athletes the 
332 
repeated bout effect will limit the damage response.28  Nonetheless, reporting of 
333 
muscle soreness at 24 h might have provided indirect evidence of muscle damage. 
334 
Alternatively, the accumulation of metabolites (evidenced by modest elevations in 
335 
blood lactate) affected the release and re-uptake of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum 
336 
and thereby impaired excitation-contraction coupling.29 In either case, greater 
337 
peripheral fatigue following maximum strength-type training provides a larger 
338 
stimulus for muscle protein synthesis,30 although both high and low load training has 
339 
been shown to increases skeletal muscle hypertrophy in trained men.31  
340 
MVC was still depressed by ~6% below pre-session force following the maximum 
341 
strength session which has important implications for subsequent exercise 
342 
prescription and training programme design considerations for elite athletes. Previous 
343 
research on non-elite populations8,11,21 showed similar, but nonetheless larger effects; 
344 
 15 
 
however the load, used in these studies would not be used in optimal elite strength 
345 
training programmes. In addition, muscle function changes in post-session relative 
346 
MVC of male vs. female are somewhat limited by low numbers, but are still insightful 
347 
given the elite nature of these athletes. Although, all of them showed reduced MVC 
348 
post strength session (11-12%), only females reduced MVC post-power session by a 
349 
similar amount, whereas the males maintained MVC. However, previous findings, 
350 
using non-elite subjects showed similar reductions in MVC for both genders post 
351 
power sessions21 and that when females are matched for strength, there were no 
352 
difference in fatigue to men.32 Therefore, as we did not match strength it is possible 
353 
that individual strength accounted for the difference in NM fatigue.  Furthermore, we 
354 
showed a strong relationship between strength and the relative change in MVC 
355 
following the power  (r = 0.84), but not strength session.  This is likely to be from 
356 
varied relative loading level used between subjects during the power session.  
357 
Furthermore, the system mass load lifted during the power session (relative to the 
358 
loaded lifted during the maximum strength session) was inversely related to the 
359 
degree of change in MVC post power session (Figure 4B).  Consequently, it is likely 
360 
that MVC force reduction differences of male vs. female is weaker, lighter subjects 
361 
were working ‘relatively’ harder during the power session than stronger, heavier 
362 
athletes. Definitive gender differences are not possible to glean from these data in 
363 
elite athletes, but it does highlight the importance of training intensities in a ‘system 
364 
mass’ term because of the practical issues in exercise prescription. Setting load levels 
365 
for power sessions as percentages of system mass loads might help ensure individuals 
366 
train at a similar relative intensity.  
367 
 
368 
Practical applications and Conclusion 
369 
 16 
 
In summary, these data provide new information of the fatigue and recovery 
370 
following resistance exercise sessions designed to improve maximum strength and 
371 
power in elite track and field athletes. The findings show that 12 sets of maximum 
372 
strength resistance exercise results in reduced force generating capacity that take more 
373 
than 24 h to be resolved, whereas force is largely unchanged following power 
374 
sessions.  This is likely from higher intensity and time under tension during the 
375 
maximum strength session (impulse) and total work done. The study provides 
376 
valuable information for athletes, coaches and practitioners when planning the 
377 
training programme to understand the consequences of engaging elite athletes in 
378 
strength and power resistance exercise.  Specifically, in the day following maximum 
379 
strength training there is likely to be an impairment of maximum strength; therefore 
380 
practitioners should be mindful of appropriate programming particularly where 
381 
subsequent maximal or perimaximal efforts might be required.
