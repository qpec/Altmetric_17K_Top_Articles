ABSTRACT
Accurate identification of risk factors for calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is necessary to develop
preventive strategies for this morbid disease. We investigated whether baseline factors recorded at
hemodialysis initiation would identify patients at risk for future CUA in a matched case-control study using
data from a large dialysis organization. Hemodialysis patients with newly diagnosed CUA (n=1030) be-
tween January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, were matched by age, sex, and race in a 1:2 ratio to
hemodialysis patients without CUA (n=2060). Mean ages for patients and controls were 54 and 55 years,
respectively; 67% of participants were women and 49% were white. Median duration between hemodial-
ysis initiation and subsequent CUA development was 925 days (interquartile range, 273–2185 days). In
multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses, diabetes mellitus; higher body mass index; higher
levels of serum calcium, phosphorous, and parathyroid hormone; and nutritional vitamin D, cinacalcet, and
warfarin treatments were associated with increased odds of subsequent CUA development. Compared
with patients with diabetes receiving no insulin injections, those receiving insulin injections had a dose-
response increase in the odds of CUA involving lower abdomen and/or upper thigh areas (odds ratio, 1.49;
95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.51 for one or two injections per day; odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence
interval, 1.30 to 3.43 for 3 injections per day; odds ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval, 2.28 to 6.25 for
more than three injections per day), suggesting a dose-effect relationship between recurrent skin trauma
and CUA risk. The presence of risk factors months to years before CUA development observed in this study
will direct the design of preventive strategies and inform CUA pathobiology.

The lack of effective therapeutic interventions
underscoresa need to develop strategies to prevent
calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA). Mortality
rates for patients with CUA are extremely high and
have remained over three times that for patients
receiving hemodialysis without CUA. The report-
ed prevalence of CUA is 4% in patients receiving
chronic hemodialysis and recent reports suggest
that incidence of CUA in patients receiving
chronic hemodialysis is increasing.1–4 A first
step in preventing CUA is to conduct a compre-
hensive ascertainment of risk factors for CUA.
Previous studies evaluating CUA risk factors are
limited by small sample size (number of patients
with CUA ranging from five to 62)3–13 and have
mostly focused on factors at or close to the diag-
nosis of CUA.3,5,8,10 The cross-sectional nature of
these prior studies leaves uncertainty as to whether
the outcome followed exposure or exposure resulted
from the outcome.

CLINICAL RESEARCH
 We hypothesized that baseline factors recorded at the
time of dialysis initiation would help to accurately profile
patients at the highest risk for future CUA. Since CUA
is typically seen in patients receiving chronic dialysis for
.1 year,4,14,15 baseline factors recorded months to years
prior to a CUA diagnosis can be the target of potential in-
terventions to reduce the subsequent CUA risk. We tested
this hypothesis by conducting a large nationally represen-
tative case-control study that compared characteristics at
hemodialysis initiation between patients with CUA and
matched patients receiving hemodialysis without CUA.
Considering the previously described heterogeneity asso-
ciated with anatomic distribution of CUA lesions (central
lesions versus peripheral lesions),7,16 we also examined risk
factors for central and peripheral CUA separately and in-
vestigated whether insulin injections as a source of skin
trauma are associated with the risk of future CUA.
RESULTS
Study Patient Characteristics
From chronic dialysis units affiliated with Fresenius Medical
Care North America (FMCNA), we identified 1030 patients
receiving hemodialysis with newly diagnosed CUA (cases)
between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014. We then
randomly selected contemporaneous patients receiving he-
modialysis without CUA from the FMCNA database and
matchedthemto casesina2:1ratio byage(65years),sex,and
race to serve as controls.
The median duration between hemodialysis initiation and
CUA development was 925 days (interquartile range [IQR],
273–2185 days). Skin biopsy confirmation was reported for
55% and the remaining were diagnosed clinically. Matching
produced equivalent age, sex, and race distributions for cases
and controls (Table 1). Mean ages for cases and controls were

 54 and 55 years, respectively. CUA was
noted to have a predilection for women
(67%) and white race (49%). Prevalence
of diabetes mellitus was higher in cases
compared with controls (61% versus
44%) and mean body mass index (BMI)
for cases was 37 kg/m2 compared with
30 kg/m2 for controls. Serum phosphorus
and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels
were higher at hemodialysis initiation
among patients who eventually developed
CUA, whereas serum calcium levels (both
albumin corrected and albumin noncor-
rected) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels
were similar. Nutritional vitamin D (9%
versus 5%), cinacalcet (7% versus 2%),
and phosphate binder (35% versus 31%)
treatments were more prevalent at hemo-
dialysis initiation among cases compared
with controls, whereas activated vitamin
D treatment use was less prevalent in cases
compared with controls (32% versus 37%)
and dialysate calcium levels (2.560.3 ver-
sus 2.560.2) were similar between cases
and controls. Both calcium-containing
(19% versus 17%) and noncalcium-
containing phosphate binder treatments
(16% versus 14%) were more prevalent at
baseline among cases compared with con-
trols; however, differences did not reach
statistical significance (P values 0.06 and
0.07, respectively). Warfarin therapy at hemodialysis initiation
was over three times more prevalent among cases compared
with controls. At hemodialysis initiation, statin treatment
had a higher prevalence among cases compared with controls
(25% versus 22%), whereas erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
had a lower prevalence in cases compared with controls (45%
versus 56%). Among patients with diabetes, insulin use at
hemodialysis initiation was more common in cases compared
with controls (32% versus 27%; P=0.002).
Risk Factors for Future CUA Development at the Time
of Hemodialysis Initiation
In multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses ad-
justed for allcovariateslisted inTable1,diabetesmellitus (odds
ratio [OR], 2.16; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.69 to
2.59), higher BMI (for every 5 kg/m2 increase: OR, 1.38; 95%
CI, 1.29 to 1.51), higher albumin-corrected serum calcium
(for every 1 mg/dl increase: OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.61),
higher serum phosphorous (for every 1 mg/dl increase: OR,
1.11; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.19), higher PTH (for every 100 pg/ml
increase: OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.21), nutritional vitamin D
use (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.95), cinacalcet use (OR, 2.12;
95% CI, 1.10 to 3.15), and warfarin use (OR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.11
to 4.65) at hemodialysis initiation were associated with
increased odds of future CUA development, whereas higher
hemoglobin (for every 1 g/dl increase: OR, 0.81; 95% CI,
0.91 to 0.99) and use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
(OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.99) were associated with reduced
odds (Figure 1). Phosphate binder treatments (both calcium-
containing and noncalcium-containing agents) did not dem-
onstrate significant association with future CUA development.
In multivariable analyses adjusted for covariates identified
by stepwise selection, the same covariates were independently
associated with increased odds of CUA development.
Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted conditional logistic regression analyses and
examined the association between cinacalcet and nutritional
vitamin D use and CUA development across the severity
categories for each mineral metabolism marker. Overall the
associations were consistent; however, sample size introduced
limitations on statistical significance for some associations
(Supplemental Table 1). To overcome this sample size limita-
tion, we identified all the remaining patients (n=259,212), in
addition to 1030 CUA cases and 2060 controls, who were re-
ceiving dialysis care at the FMCNA during the contempora-
neous study period. In this large cohort (total n=262,302,
mean age =62 years [615 years], 57% men, 62% white, and

 32% black), 5246 patients (2%) were treated with cinacalcet
within the first 90 days of hemodialysis initiation and 12,286
patients (5%) were treated with nutritional vitamin D within
the first 90 days of hemodialysis initiation. In logistic regression
analyses, increased risks for CUA were noted with cinacalcet and
nutritional vitamin D across all the mineral metabolism sever-
ities (Supplemental Table 2). In multivariable-adjusted analyses
adjusted for mineral metabolism markers, use of cinacalcet
(OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.79 to 3.46) and nutritional vitamin D
(OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.67 to 3.34) were associated with in-
creased CUA risk.
We also examined whether association of cinacalcet with
CUA varies across cinacalcet dosing by categorizing cinacalcet
dose as #60 mg/d and .60 mg/d. In univariate analyses,
#60 mg/d cinacalcet dose (OR, 4.21; 95% CI, 2.80 to 6.33)
and .60 mg/d cinacalcet dose (OR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.52 to 6.33)
were associated with increased odds of CUA. In multivariable
analyses adjusted for all covariates listed in Table 1, low-dose
cinacalcet was associated with statistically significant in-
creased odds of CUA (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.11 to 3.92). High-
dose cinacalcet was also associated with increased odds of CUA;
however, sample size likely introduced limitations to statistical
significance (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 0.91 to 5.29).
The relationship between various risk factors and CUA
developmentwasnotmateriallydifferentinsensitivityanalyses
restricted to patients with CUA with reported diagnostic skin
biopsy confirmation (n=567) and their corresponding match-
ing controls (n=1134) (Supplemental Table 3).
Central CUA
Data on CUA lesion(s) location were available for 69% of cases
(n=710). Patients with lesions involving chest, trunk, but-
tocks, genitals, lower extremities proximal to knee joints,
and upper extremities proximal to elbow joints were classified
as having a central distribution, whereas patients with lesions
restricted to lower extremities at and distal to knee joints,
upper extremities at and distal to elbow joints, and head
were classified as having a peripheral distribution. Most pa-
tients with CUA had lesions in central distribution (n=582).
When compared with CUA patients with lesions limited to
peripheral distribution, patients with CUA with central distri-
bution were younger and had a higher prevalence of obesity
and warfarin use (Table 2). In multivariable analyses restricted
to patients with central CUA and their corresponding controls
and adjusted for all covariates listed in Table 2, the following
independent risk factors for central CUA were identified: di-
abetes mellitus (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.69 to 6.01), BMI (for every
5 kg/m2 increase: OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.82), albumin-
corrected serum calcium (for every 1 mg/dl increase: OR, 1.31;
95% CI, 1.07 to 2.23), warfarin use (OR, 3.98; 95% CI, 2.21 to
10.21), and insulin use (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.98). In
multivariable analyses adjusted for covariates identified by
stepwise selection, the results were similar. The relationship be-
tween these risk factors and central CUA development was not
materially different in sensitivity analyses restricted to patients
with central CUA with reported diagnostic skin biopsy confir-
mation (n=378) and their corresponding matching controls
(n=756).
To further examine whether recurrent skin trauma in-
duced by insulin injections poses a risk for CUA, we
conducted analyses restricted to patients with diabetes and
CUA lesions involving usual sites for insulin administration
such as lower abdomen and/or upper thigh areas (n=348)
and controls with diabetes mellitus (n=906). Among pa-
tients with diabetes and CUA lesions involving lower abdo-
men and/or upper thigh areas, 54% were not receiving
insulin therapy at hemodialysis initiation, 16% were receiv-
ing one or two, 12% were receiving three, and 18% were
receiving more than three insulin injections per day. Among
control patients with diabetes, 73% were not receiving any
insulin therapy at hemodialysis initiation, 16% were receiv-
ing one or two, 6% were receiving three, and 5% were receiv-
ing more than three insulin injections per day. Compared
with patients with diabetes receiving no insulin injections,
those receiving one or two (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.51),
those receiving three (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.30 to 3.43),
and those receiving more than three (OR, 3.74; 95% CI,
2.28 to 6.25) insulin injections per day had a dose-response
increase in the odds of CUA lesions (Figure 2). In models
adjusted for demographics and for covariates with statistical
significance in univariate analyses (including BMI), effects
were attenuated but remained significant for those receiving
three and more than three insulin injections per day. We
observed a significant trend between the odds of CUA and
increasing insulin injection frequency across all the tertiles of
BMI, suggesting that the association between CUA and insu-
lin injections is likely more reflective of skin trauma than
larger body size (Supplemental Table 4).
Peripheral CUA
In multivariable analyses restricted to patients with peripheral
CUA (n=128) and their corresponding controls and adjusted
for all covariates listed in Table 2, the following independent
risk factors for peripheral CUA were identified: diabetes mel-
litus (OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.35 to 4.21), BMI (for every 5 kg/m2
increase: OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.66), and activated vita-
min D treatment (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.65). In multi-
variable analyses adjusted for covariates identified by stepwise
selection, the same covariates were independently associated
with increased odds of peripheral CUA development. In sen-
sitivity analyses restricted to patients with peripheral CUA
with reported diagnostic skin biopsy (n=53) and their corre-
sponding matching controls (n=106), the relationship was
similar in direction but not significant, due to limited sample
sizes.
CUA Incidence Rate and Mortality
In the entire cohort of FMCNA patients receiving dialysis
between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, a mean CUA
incidence rate was 3.49 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI, 3.30 to
3424

 3.72). We noted a significantly increased CUA incidence rate in
warfarin users of 6.24 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI, 5.87 to
6.67) compared with 3.41 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI, 3.27
to 3.75) in warfarin nonusers (P,0.001). Mean incidence rate
of CUA involving lower abdomen and/or upper thigh areas
progressively increased with increasing frequency of insulin
injections: 2.27 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI, 2.09 to 2.57)
for those not receiving any insulin; 2.71 per 1000 patient-years
(95% CI, 2.41 to 2.85), 3.01 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI,
2.73 to 3.20), and 3.35 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI, 2.98 to
5.34) for those receiving one or two, three, and more than
three insulin injections per day, respectively (P for trend
,0.001).
Mortality rates were 27% at 6 months after CUA diag-
nosis and 45% at 12 months after CUA diagnosis. Median
time to death was 151 days (IQR, 107–368 days) from CUA
diagnosis.
DISCUSSION
For a complex disease such as CUA, multiple risk factors are
expected. Aligned with this possibility, we now report signif-
icantassociationsofbaselinediabetesmellitus,obesity,mineral
bone disease, warfarin, and insulin injections with future
development of CUA in a large, nationally representative,
matchedcase-controlstudy.Diabetesmellitusandobesitywere
associated with both central and peripheral CUA, whereas
insulininjectionsandwarfarinwerespecificallyassociatedwith
central CUA. The majority of patients with CUA were white
women.
Prior studies designed to investigate risk factors for CUA
suffered from sample size limitations3–5,7–13; the largest pub-
lished study to date included 62 patients with CUA.3 Limited
sample size of prior studies restricted multivariable adjust-
ments and separate analyses for central versus peripheral

 CUA.3,5 Furthermore, most prior studies evaluated risk factors
at the time of or close to the CUA diagnosis,3–5,8,9,11,12 a major
impediment to uncovering potential causality. A classic dem-
onstration of this is the almost universal positive association
between lower serum albumin and CUA3,5,11; however, when
measured months to years prior to CUA, low serum albumin
was not a significant risk factor in this study. In contrast, fac-
tors likely unchanged by dialysis such as diabetes status, obe-
sity, and of course white race and female sex, were reported
previously and in our study as well. Since the current study
examined risk factors at the time of hemodialysis initiation,
months to years prior to the CUA diagnosis, we provide po-
tential insights into the CUA pathobiology and suggest poten-
tially modifiable factors to prevent and treat CUA.
We believe that the results of this study further strengthen
the observations reported in previous cross-sectional studies
regarding associations between increased serum calcium,
serum phosphorous, and PTH levels and CUA risk, and hint
that previous cross-sectional studies that did not observe
similar positive associations could be either biased due to lack
of lag time between exposure and outcome or levels of these
parameters could be different once CUA develops, due to
deposition of minerals in skin tissue and/or due to treatments
introduced to treat mineral bone disease following CUA
development. Although median PTH levels at hemodialysis
initiationwere higher for CUAcases compared with controls in
our study, they were still within the Kidney Disease Improving
Global Outcomes study recommended range of within two to
nine times the upper range of normal for the majority of CUA
cases, raising questions regarding what should be a target PTH
for CUA prevention and how this could be achieved.17 Novel
observations from our large study regarding differential asso-
ciations between therapeutic agents targeted at mineral and
bone metabolism abnormalities (cinacalcet and nutritional
vitamin D associated with increased odds
of subsequent CUA, whereas such associa-
tion was not observed with activated vita-
min D treatment in the primary analysis)
demonstrate the significance of evaluating
risk factors months to years prior to CUA
development, when treatment decisions are
not confounded by the existent CUA. These
findings will need careful assessment in
other prospective registries.
Our study findings support the ongoing
and future translational investigations fo-
cused on metabolic syndrome, adipose
tissue biology, mineral bone disease, skin
trauma, and vitamin K metabolism in the
pathogenesis of CUA.1,18,19 Insulin-related
skin trauma is particularly interesting and
has been previously speculated in case re-
ports.20,21 Dermal arteriolar endothelial
damage caused due to immune reactions
to insulin triggering a procoagulant state
or adverse anabolic effects of insulin on local dermal architec-
ture are potential underlying mechanisms; however, these
actions may not be unique to insulin as various other skin
traumas, such as chronic resting of elbows on thighs and ap-
plication of ice packs, have also been reported to trigger
CUA.20 Our confirmation of association between warfarin
therapy (vitamin K antagonist) and CUA will inform risk-
benefit discussion of warfarin use in patients receiving hemo-
dialysis, especially as novel oral anticoagulants become available
for this population. This confirmation also stimulates
examination of other potential causes of vitamin K deficiency
(e.g., suboptimal intake, antibiotic exposure, etc.) for CUA. Pa-
tients receiving dialysis have a high prevalence of vitamin K de-
ficiency, even in the absence of warfarin therapy,22,23 and future
research is needed to determine if correction of vitamin K defi-
ciency prevents CUA. Ideally, only a randomized controlled trial
can conclusively address the efficacy of preventive approaches;
however, limitations of rare disease research and ethical concerns
need to be taken into account and creative trial designs will be
needed.24–26
While our study had several strengths, we cannot ignore
certain limitations. Residual confounding cannot be excluded
and causality cannot be inferred. Although the increased CUA
risks among patients using cinacalcet and nutritional vitamin
D were consistent across the severity spectrum of mineral and
bone metabolism markers, the observational nature of our
study cannot rule out reverse causality. This is especially
relevant because in the Evaluation of Cinacalcet Hydrochloride
Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events (EVOLVE) trial,
relative CUA risk reduction of 69%–75% in the cinacalcet arm
compared with the placebo arm was noted,27,28 and in the Study
to Evaluate Cinacalcet Plus Low Dose Vitamin D on Vascular
Calcification in Subjects With Chronic Kidney Disease Re-
ceiving Hemodialysis (ADVANCE) trial there was a trend

 toward attenuation in the progression of aortic and valvular
calcifications with cinacalcet treatment.29 In our case-
control analyses restricted to patients with moderate to
severe hyperparathyroidism to resemble the EVOLVE trial,
cinacalcet use did not have a statistically significant associ-
ation with CUA risk (Supplemental Table 1) but sample size
was limited; and indeed, a statistically significant association
across all the categories of PTH levels was observed when we
analyzed data from the entire contemporaneous FMCNA
cohort (Supplemental Table 2). Similarly, causality to skin
trauma cannot be attributed in an observational study. We
relied on the treating clinicians to report CUA cases
introducing a potential misclassification bias. There is a po-
tential for survivorship bias; however, this would tend to bias
the results toward the null. Due to uncertainty regarding the
precise time of CUA development, we did not conduct re-
peated measures analyses to examine risk factors at 3 months
or 6 months prior to CUA; however, we are certain that none of
the cases had CUA at the time of hemodialysis initiation, and
the earliest CUA diagnosis in terms of dialysis initiation timing
was at 194 days.
In conclusion, risk factors for CUA are present months to
years prior to CUA development in patients receiving hemo-
dialysis. CUA has a predilection for white, female, diabetic, and
obese patients and, especially in these patients, research and
clinical attention should focus on avoiding additional CUA
triggers such as vitamin K antagonism or deficiency, skin
trauma, and mineral bone abnormalities.
CONCISE METHODS
The study protocol was approved and granted a waiver of informed
consent by the New England Institutional Review Board.
Study Patients
Data were derived from the FMCNA database that prospectively
captures data elements for the purposes of health care delivery and
epidemiologic studies. Multiple prior high-quality publications have
resulted from the FMCNA database used in this study.30,31 Approx-
imately 35% of the United States adult outpatient dialysis population
is represented in the FMCNA database. The Clinical Quality Group
and Data Entry Error Reduction Task Force at FMCNA mandates
protocols and audits incoming information to ensure data are accu-
rately documented for clinical care and Medicare billing. A single
provider (Spectra Laboratories, Rockleigh, NJ) performs all labora-
tory testing and the results are directly downloaded into the database.
Patient prescriptions for oral and home medications are charted in
the FMCNA database on standardized medication tables. Registered
nurses at the dialysis facilities transcribe each drug name with its
dose, route, start date, and stop date, as labeled on the medication
bottle, into the database forms. Injectable medications administered
at dialysis are recorded for each patient on a per treatment basis.
CUA cases have been prospectively tracked at the FMCNA since
January 2010 by requesting clinicians to report every new CUA case to
FMCNA and to submit relevant information in a questionnaire that
records information on how the CUA diagnosis was made (biopsy
confirmation versus clinical diagnosis) and characteristics of CUA
skin lesions. New CUA cases diagnosed between January 1, 2010, and
December 31, 2014 in adult (aged .18 years) patients receiving he-
modialysis at one of the FMCNA facilities were eligible for inclusion
in this matched case-control study. After excluding patients with
CUA receiving peritoneal dialysis (n=107) and patients for whom
the ascertainment of CUA diagnosis could not be done due to non-
availability of the questionnaire to be filled out by a treating clinician
(n=152), we identified 1030 CUA cases to be included in this study. In
all these cases, the ascertainment of CUA diagnosis was made by a
manual review (by S.U.N.) of questionnaires filled out by treating
clinicians. Controls (hemodialysis patients without the diagnosis of
CUA receiving dialysis care at one of the FMCNA facilities during the
contemporaneous time period) were randomly selected and matched
to cases on age (65 years), sex, and race in 2:1 ratio. The final sample
size was 1030 cases and 2060 controls. In addition to these CUA cases
and controls, we also identified all the remaining patients
(n=259,212) who were receiving dialysis care at the FMCNA during
the contemporaneous study period, to conduct sensitivity analyses
and to compute CUA incidence rate.
Study Data
Data on demographics, comorbidities, dialysis treatments, medica-
tions, and laboratory variables were obtained from the FMCNA
database described above. These datawere obtained within the first 90
days of hemodialysis initiation. Medication exposure was defined as
any use of that medication within the first 90 days of hemodialysis
initiation. For patients who had multiple laboratory measurements
(including for mineral bone parameters) within the first 90 days of
hemodialysis initiation, mean levels were computed for analyses. The
median numbers of mineral metabolism parameter values available
for computation during the first 90 days of hemodialysis initiation
were as follows: serum calcium, 5 (IQR, 3–5); phosphorous, 5 (IQR,
3–5); PTH, 3 (IQR, 2–4); and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1 (IQR, 1–2).
Serum calcium levels were corrected for albumin using the follow-
ing formula: albumin-corrected serum calcium = measured serum
calcium + 0.8 (4 2 measured serum albumin).32 Data on CUA lesions
and method of CUA diagnosis were obtained from a review of the
questionnaires provided by treating clinicians.
Statistical Analyses
Frequency (for categorical variables), mean and SD values (for
normally distributed variables), and median and IQR (for non-
normally distributed variables) were reported. Categorical variables
werecompared between cases and controls using a x2 test. Continuous
variables were compared using independent samples t test or Mann–
Whitney U test. Comparisons were also made between patients with
central CUA and peripheral CUA and between patients with diabetes
and CUA lesions involving lower abdomen and/or upper thigh areas
and controls with diabetes mellitus.
To test the association between risk factors and CUA, conditional
logistic regression models were applied to compute OR and 95% CI.
Any confounding effect from age, sex, and race was handled via the

 matching procedure and all the other covariates listed in Table 1 were
included in primary multivariable-adjusted analyses. We also con-
ducted secondary multivariable-adjusted analyses adjusted for
covariates identified by stepwise selection and sensitivity analyses re-
stricted to patients with CUA with reported diagnostic biopsy con-
firmation. Separate multivariable conditional logistic regression
analyses (adjusted for all covariates listed in Table 2, adjusted for
covariates identified by stepwise selection, and restricted to patients
with CUA with reported diagnostic biopsy confirmation) were also
conducted to identify independent risk factors for central and pe-
ripheral CUA. We examined the association between insulin injec-
tions and CUA involving usual sites of insulin administration in
patients with diabetes by constructing unadjusted and adjusted lo-
gistic regression models for three categories of insulin frequency (one
or two, three, and more than three injections per day), with zero
injections per day as a referent. We conducted conditional logistic
regression analyses to examine the risk of CUA for cinacalcet users
and nutritional vitamin D users across tertiles of mineral metabolism
markers in the case/control population and also conducted logistic
regression analyses on data from the entire FMCNA cohort during
the contemporaneous time period.
We calculated the CUA incidence rate (mean, 95% CI) per 1000
patient-years in the FMCNAcohort by assuming it followed a Poisson
distribution and applying the following equation: CUA incidence
rate =numberof newCUAcases/sumofpersonfollow-up timeatrisk.
The Cochran–Armitage test was conducted to examine the un-
derlying trend of CUA incidence rate across patient groups by their
frequency of insulin injections.
All analyses were performed using the SAS program (version 9.4)
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Statistical significance was set as
P,0.05.
