Evaluation of Prescription Drug Monitoring by a
United States Laboratory

Objectives: Recently, more than 63% of the 52,404 drug overdose
deaths in the United States involved heroin and opioid pain medi-
cations. More than 30% of opioid-related deaths also involved
benzodiazepines. Previous studies examining the extent of concur-
rent opioid and benzodiazepine use have relied on prescription data.
To gain fuller insight into the extent of the concurrent use problem,
we analyzed opioid and benzodiazepine prescription patterns in the
context of drug testing results.
Methods: All specimens from patients that were prescribed at least 1
drug and were tested for both opioids and benzodiazepines by a national
reference laboratory were included. This resulted in an analytical set of
231,228 sets of test results from 144,535 patients with diverse demo-
graphic factors being tested in a variety of health care settings.
Results: Laboratory test results indicated concurrent use of opioids
and benzodiazepines in over 25% of patients. In 52% of test results
with evidence of concurrent use, 1 drug class was prescribed and
the other was non-prescribed. Nearly 1 in 5 specimens (19%) testing
positive for prescribed opioids also tested positive for non-prescribed
benzodiazepines. Over 15% of specimens with prescribed benzo-
diazepines also demonstrated non-prescribed opioid use.
Conclusions: The extent of concurrent use of benzodiazepines and
opioids, particularly non-prescribed use, suggests the need for more
effective clinician assessment and intervention. The results support
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention opioid prescribing
guidelines that drug testing occur before and periodically throughout
opioid use and suggest that this testing should be extended to patients
prescribed benzodiazepines as well.
Key Words: benzodiazepines, concurrent drug use, non-prescribed

S
ince 2000, the rate of opioid deaths in the United States
has tripled (Rudd et al., 2016). Drug overdose deaths rose to
the highest level ever recorded in 2015 and may have risen since.
Over 63% of the 52,404 drug overdose deaths in 2015 involved
heroin and opioid pain reliever medications (Rudd et al., 2016),
and nearly half of these deaths involved prescription medications
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2017). A
number of risk factors have been identified that increase the risk
of adverse events related to opioids, including concurrent use of
benzodiazepine medications and other central nervous system
depressants (Zedler et al., 2014). The cumulative and synergistic
drug effects from combining benzodiazepines and opioids
depress the central nervous system’s medullary controls for
respiration; benzodiazepines through the gamma-aminobuty-
ric-acid receptors and opioids through mu (m) and delta (d)
receptors. Some patients and individuals with substance use
disorder may combine opioid and benzodiazepine drugs to
increase the subjective peak strength of drug effects and sedation
(Lintzeris et al., 2007), whereas others may use each drug
therapeutically. In 2010, over 30% of opioid-related deaths in
the United States also involved benzodiazepines (Jones et al.,
2013). Of interest, among United States military veterans who
were prescribed opioids and who subsequently died of a drug
overdose, approximately half involved concurrent prescriptions
for benzodiazepines (Park et al., 2015).
Federal agencies in the United States continue to make
efforts to combat the opioid abuse and overdose epidemic. In
August 2016 the United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) issued a ‘‘boxed warning’’ on both prescription opioids
and benzodiazepines alerting prescribers to the dangers of
concurrent use (FDA, 2016). In March 2016, the CDC

ORIGINAL RESEARCH
 released the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for
Chronic Pain—United States, 2016. Two key recommenda-
tions are that clinicians ‘‘should use urine drug testing before
starting opioid therapy and consider urine drug testing at
least annually to assess for prescribed medications as well as
other controlled prescription drugs and illicit drugs’’ (Dowell
et al., 2016). Drug testing prior to starting therapy with a
controlled substance provides baseline information of current
drug use. Subsequent drug tests monitor for both adherence
with prescribed medications and abstinence from use of non-
prescribed or illicit drugs. Drug testing patients who are
prescribed opioids can reveal potentially dangerous drug
combinations, including concurrent use of benzodiazepines,
which can inform and affect clinicians’ treatment decisions.
Many studies have analyzed opioid (Pletcher et al., 2008;
Jones, 2015) and benzodiazepine (Olfson et al., 2015; Jones,
2015) prescription data, and some have used this approach to
appraise the extent of concurrent and potentially problematic
prescribing (Paulozzi et al., 2015; Hwang et al., 2016; Stein
et al., 2017). Considering that drug diversion and illicit use of
both drug categories are known problems (The White House,
2012; Drug Enforcement Administration, 2013; Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2016),
we believe it is important to understand not only prescribing
patterns, but also how these patterns relate to actual patient drug
use. Using a large national prescription drug monitoring data-
base, we examined prescription data and urine drug testing data
to determine the extent of concurrent use among patients
undergoing drug testing for both opioids and benzodiazepines.
METHODS
Specimen Collections and Handling
The urine drug testing analyses included either presump-
tive immunoassay screens confirmed by quantitative definitive
mass spectrometry, or only quantitative definitive mass spec-
trometry. The immunoassay presumptive screens for the ben-
zodiazepines and opioids drug classes were performed using
laboratory developed test procedures modified to detect com-
pounds with low cross-reactivity (eg, 6-aminoclonazepam,
lorazepam, hydromorphone). Quantitative confirmation analy-
sisisperformedtoruleoutfalse-positive presumptive screening
results. The liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
analysis was performed in clinical laboratories to provide
sensitive and specific definitive quantitative analysis of the
drugs and drug metabolites. All mass spectrometry methods
were calibrated using reference materials traceable to the
National Institute of Standards and Technology.
Study Data
All prescription drug monitoring test results with unique
patient information within the Quest Diagnostics dataset that
had at least 1 medication prescribed by the ordering physician
from March 2015 through December 2015 and that were co-
tested for both opioids and benzodiazepines were included.
March 2015 was the first full month after we increased the
number of drug analytes for this drug testing service from 26
to 44. A total of 131,012 patients were identified using a
company-wide unique patient identification number and an
additional 13,523 were identified using a combination of date
of birth, gender, ZIP Code, and insurance provider, combining
for the 144,535 individuals in the analytical population. There
were 231,228 test results from these individuals. All results
were analyzed using the Quest Diagnostics medMATCH
reporting service for tests of commonly prescribed and abused
drugs. This service reports the presence of prescribed and non-
prescribed drug(s) and drug metabolite(s) tested. Prescribed
drug information is provided by the clinician ordering the test.
Physicians ordering these tests are instructed to include
information for all prescribed drugs for the patient, not just
the drugs they have prescribed themselves. Many physicians
use state prescription monitoring programs to check for other
prescribed drugs before sending the information.
Drug Outcome Subgroups
For some drugs, the urine drug test may include multiple
combinations of results in which parent drug(s) and drug
metabolite(s) both represent drugs that may be prescribed. In
these instances it was necessary to define the following analyte
groupings thataccount forpossible parentdrug/drug metabolite
relationships: codeine and morphine; hydrocodone and hydro-
morphone; oxycodone and oxymorphone; and nordiazepam,
oxazepam, and temazepam. All groupings were counted posi-
tive if either the parent drug or metabolite(s) were present. Not
all patients were tested for all subgroups: in some cases,
individual subgroups were tested as a confirmation following
a presumptive positive immunoassay result; in other instances,
individual subgroups were tested in accordance with the labo-
ratory test request. For example, a physician can order a test for
oxycodone that, if presumptive positive, will reflex to a test for
oxycodone, noroxycodone and oxymorphone or the health care
provider may order a test for expanded opiates including
oxycodone, noroxycodone, oxymorphone, codeine, hydroco-
done, hydromorphone, morphine and norhydrocodone.
Demographic Factors
To account for potential changes during the study period,
we analyzed demographic factors based on only the first exami-
nationforeachpatient.Thisstudyincludedtestresultsofpatients
from48statesintheUnitedStates.Datawereanalyzedinregions
defined by the United States Department of Health and Human
Services. Provider type information is linked to each Quest
Diagnostics client account and/or individual provider. The dem-
ographics presented in Table 1 are intended to compare positive
rates by characteristics within each group and the outcomes in
each column are not mutually exclusive.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical significance testing of group proportions was
conducted using the chi-square test. Trends in proportions of
drug use among various groups were analyzed using the
Cochran-Armitage test. The t test was used for significance
testing of means. Multivariable logistic regression analysis
was used to identify characteristics associated with prescribed
and non-prescribed opioid and benzodiazepine use, as well as
co-presence. To eliminate the possibility of correlated error
due to some individuals having multiple test results we limited
all logistic regression models to the each patient’s first test

 result. We included variables that had a rate of concurrent
benzodiazepine and opioid use higher than average for the
study population in the unadjusted models. For area of resi-
dence, Health and Human Services Regions 3, 4, 6, or 7 were
all included as separate binary variables. Being 35 years of
age or older, having order codes originating from a pain clinic,
primary care physician, and neurologist and having Medicare
payer status were all included as binary variables. All vari-
ables from the unadjusted models were included in the testing
of multivariable models because of their potential as con-
founding factors and to enable comparisons between models.
Insignificant variables were removed from the multivariable
models in backward stepwise fashion using a P value of
<0.05. Test results with missing data for any of the variables
were excluded from the adjusted models. All adjusted cova-
riates are shown in the logistic model table. Results of
adjusted and unadjusted models were stated as odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Data were
analyzed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
The proportional Venn diagram shown in Figure 1 was created
using JMP version 11.0.0 (SAS Institute). This Quest Diag-
nostics Health Trends study was deemed exempt by the
Western Institutional Review Board (Puyallup, Washington).
RESULTS
Demographic factors were captured at the time of
each patient’s first test result within the study period
(Table 1). Of the 144,535 patients included, almost three-
fourths tested positive for opioids and more than one-third
tested positive for benzodiazepines. More than one-fourth of
patients tested positive simultaneously for both opioid(s) and
benzodiazepine(s).
The proportions of males and females testing positive for
opioid medications were similar, but use of benzodiazepines and
concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines was significantly
more common among women than men (P< 0.01, Table 1).
However, this was largely driven by women being prescribed
benzodiazepines at a higher rate than men (32.7% vs 23.5%) as
non-prescribed benzodiazepine use was similar between men
and women (19.4% vs 15.2%). Use of opioids, benzodiazepines,
and concurrent use of both drug classes demonstrated a signifi-
cant increasing trend with age (all P< 0.01), but leveled off
among those �65 years of age. Patients in pain clinics had the
highestlevelofconcurrentuse.Thefrequencyofconcurrentdrug
class use varied with geographic region, being lowest in region
10 and highest in region 7. Medicare patients had significantly
higher levels of opioid use, benzodiazepine use, and concurrent

or private payer status (all P< 0.01).
Overall, 124,410 (86.1%) patients were prescribed at
least 1 opioid, 41,599 (28.8%) patients were prescribed at
least 1 benzodiazepine and 28,240 (19.5%) were prescribed
both. 67.5% of specimens were positive for the opioid that
was prescribed, 66.1% were positive for the benzodiazepine
that was prescribed, and 58.9% were positive for both when
both were prescribed. A breakdown of positivity for all study
test results by prescribed and non-prescribed status is shown
in Table 2. The majority of test results in the study were either
negative for both benzodiazepines and opioids (15.9%) or
positive for prescribed opioids only (43.1%). Of the 59,557
test results (25.8% of all results) that demonstrated concurrent
use, 39,175 (65.8%) used at least 1 non-prescribed benzodi-
azepine or opioid. Other breakdowns of concurrent use are
shown in Figure 1.
Nearly 1 in 5 results testing positive for prescribed
opioids also tested positive for non-prescribed benzodiaze-
pines (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.
lww.com/JAM/A63). The hydrocodone subgroup was the
most frequently prescribed opioid, and was most frequently
found in combination with non-prescribed benzodiazepines.
The nordiazepam/oxazepam/temazepam group was the most
common non-prescribed benzodiazepine. The codeine, hydro-
codone, and oxycodone subgroups followed similar concurrent
usepatterns;however,thosetestingpositiveforthemethadoneand
burprenorphine subgroups showed different patterns of benzodi-
azepine subgroup positivity. There were 6292 test results with
non-prescribed opioids in addition to prescribed benzodiazepines
(15.5% of those positive for prescribed benzodiazepines—see
Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/
JAM/A64). The most commonly prescribed benzodiazepine
was alprazolam. There were over 13,000 test results showing
non-prescribed opioid use in the codeine subgroup and over
14,000 in the hydrocodone subgroups.
Of the test results positive for opioids, 21.6% were
positive for multiple opioid subgroups. 13.6% of the test
results that were positive for benzodiazepines were positive
for multiple benzodiazepine subgroups. Of the test results

Concurrent Use of Opioids and Benzodiazepines
� 2017 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. on behalf of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.

 demonstrating concurrent use (see Fig. 1), 26.5% were posi-
tive for multiple opioid subgroups (including 6.7% of results
positive for 3 or more subgroups), and 14.7% were positive for
multiple benzodiazepine subgroups.
Multivariable models for prescribed and non-prescribed
use of opioids and benzodiazepines, including concurrent use,
are shown in Table 3. There are few consequential differences
between the adjusted and unadjusted models; however, there
are key differences between the prescribed and non-pre-
scribed use models, most notably in patients age 35 or older
and patients in pain clinics. Concurrent use models (both
prescribed and non-prescribed) are noticeably more similar to
benzodiazepine use models than opioid use models.
DISCUSSION
The findings of the present study suggest that analyzing
the co-prescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines using
available prescription databases and monitoring programs
does not adequately assess the extent of this drug mixing
polypharmacy problem in the United States. The strength of
this study is its scale, wide sex, age and geographic represen-
tation, and most critically, given the wide use of non-pre-
scribed
illicit
drugs,
its
basis
of
actual
laboratory
measurement of drugs rather than relying on prescription
data. More than 1 in 4 patients in this study had concurrent
positive drug tests for both opioids and benzodiazepines.
Nearly two-thirds (65.8%) of the test results that demonstrated
concurrent use also showed non-prescribed use of at least 1
opioid or benzodiazepine. Over 4% of concurrent use results
did not have prescriptions for either drug. This supports the
previous assertions that benzodiazepine use among those
undergoing chronic opioid therapy is non-prescribed and
possibly recreational (Jones et al., 2012; Gudin et al., 2013).
Positivity for prescribed benzodiazepines and pre-
scribed opioids was found in 11.2% of all test results. This
is similar to the 9.6% reported in an analysis of millions of
patients filling opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions
(Hwang et al., 2016). However, this sharply contrasts with

 the 25.8% of all test results that were positive for any type of
concurrent use. We also found that a large number of the
59,557 results demonstrating concurrent use tested positive
for multiple drugs within the groups, particularly opioids.
This likely magnifies the dangers of accidental drug overdose
from misuse by these patients. It seems clear that concurrent
prescribing is only a part of the concurrent use problem facing
the United States. The amount of patients who did not test
positive for their prescribed drugs is also concerning. Patients
may not take their prescribed drugs due to undesirable side
effects, or because they are no longer in pain; others may not
be able to afford them; some patients may sell or give their
drugs to others (diversion); in rare cases patients may be rapid
metabolizers of the prescribed drug making the drug or
metabolite undetectable at the time of testing.
With over 18% of test results positive for prescribed
opioids demonstrating concurrent non-prescribed benzodiaze-
pine use, the data presented in this study substantiate the rec-
ommendations by the CDC for drug testing of patients receiving
opioid pain relievers. However, the data presented here also
indicate that non-prescribed opioid use among those with ben-
zodiazepine prescriptions is also a critical factor in the overall
pattern of concurrent use. Over 15% of results testing positive for
prescribed benzodiazepines also tested positive for non-pre-
scribed opioids. This alarming frequency suggests that drug
testing should be strongly considered by health care providers
not only when prescribing opioid medications, as the CDC
suggests, but when prescribing benzodiazepines as well.
As expected with high rates of opioid use relative to
benzodiazepine use in the study population, concurrent use
was largely driven by benzodiazepine positivity. This is
evident in the multivariable models for both prescribed and
non-prescribed drug classes. There are interesting differences
between the prescribed and non-prescribed adjusted models.
Those age 35 years or older and those with Medicare payer
status were significantly more likely to test positive for
prescribed opioids; however, both groups were significantly
less likely to test positive for non-prescribed opioids.
Strengths of this study include that the data presented
represent a large cohort (over 230,000 test results from over
140,000 patients) with great representation of sex, age, and
geographic location. Our ability to analyze drug testing data
allowed us to examine this polypharmacy problem at the
utilization level and compare that to the prescription level.
Subgroup drug testing data allowed for analyses to determine
the extent of polypharmacy use within the greater opioid and
benzodiazepine groups.
We also recognize some study limitations. Opioid and
benzodiazepine subgroup analytes can be metabolites of
multiple drugs, including prescribed drugs, which limited
the amount of detail provided in the subgroup analyses.
Physician prescribing information may not be complete for
all patients in the study. We were not provided information
about whether testing was witnessed or not. With nearly 72%
of the patients in this population testing positive for opioids, it
is possible that the index of suspicion for drug misuse is higher
in this population. Thus, this population is more likely to be
representative of a prescription drug-monitored cohort than
the general population in the United States. Given the new
opioid prescribing guidelines released by the CDC recom-
mending drug testing for all patients who are prescribed
opioid medications, it is also possible that some selection
bias in the population may be reflecting the physicians already
using best practices in drug prescribing.
CONCLUSIONS
The data presented in this study demonstrate that the
extent of concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opioids goes
well beyond what is indicated by analyzing prescription data
alone. The data also support CDC recommendation that drug
testing occurs before and periodically throughout opioid use
and suggests that this testing should be extended to benzodi-
azepine prescribing as well. Expansion of electronic Prescrip-
tion Drug Monitoring programs in many states has greatly
improved clinicians’ ability to identify all prescription infor-
mation for their patients in real time. Unfortunately, these
programs cannot capture non-prescribed drug use. Clinicians
should be aware of potentially dangerous drug interactions
beyond the prescription level, and our data demonstrate these
interactions are happening with alarming frequency. Insights
gained through drug testing can inform health care providers,
affect treatment strategies, and save lives.
