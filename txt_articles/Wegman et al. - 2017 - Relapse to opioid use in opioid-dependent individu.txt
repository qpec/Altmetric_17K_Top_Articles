Summary
Background Detention of people who use drugs into compulsory drug detention centres (CDDCs) is common 
throughout East and Southeast Asia. Evidence-based pharmacological therapies for treating substance use disorders, 
such as opioid agonist treatments with methadone, are generally unavailable in these settings. We used a unique 
opportunity where CDDCs coexisted with voluntary drug treatment centres (VTCs) providing methadone in Malaysia 
to compare the timing and occurrence of opioid relapse (measured using urine drug testing) in individuals 
transitioning from CDDCs versus methadone maintenance in VTCs.
Methods We did a parallel, two-arm, prospective observational study of opioid-dependent individuals aged 18 years and 
older who were treated in Malaysia in the Klang Valley in two settings: CDDCs and VTCs. We used sequential sampling 
to recruit individuals. Assessed individuals in CDDCs were required to participate in services such as counselling 
sessions and manual labour. Assessed individuals in VTCs could voluntarily access many of the components available 
in CDDCs, in addition to methadone therapy. We undertook urinary drug tests and behavioural interviews to assess 
individuals at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-release. The primary outcome was time to opioid relapse 
post-release in the community confi
 rmed by urinary drug testing in individuals who had undergone baseline 
interviewing and at least one urine drug test (our analytic sample). Relapse rates between the groups were compared 
using time-to-event methods. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02698098).
Findings Between July 17, 2012, and August 21, 2014, we screened 168 CDDC attendees and 113 VTC inpatients; of 
these, 89 from CDDCs and 95 from VTCs were included in our analytic sample. The baseline characteristics of the two 
groups were similar. In unadjusted analyses, CDDC participants had signifi
 cantly more rapid relapse to opioid use 
post-release compared with VTC participants (median time to relapse 31 days [IQR 26–32] vs 352 days [256–unestimable], 
log rank test, p<0·0001). VTC participants had an 84% (95% CI 75–90) decreased risk of opioid relapse after adjustment 
for control variables and inverse propensity of treatment weights. Time-varying eff
 ect modelling revealed the largest 
hazard ratio reduction, at 91% (95% CI 83–96), occurs during the fi
 rst 50 days in the community.
Interpretation Opioid-dependent individuals in CDDCs are signifi
 cantly more likely to relapse to opioid use after 
release, and sooner, than those treated with evidence-based treatments such as methadone, suggesting that CDDCs 
have no role in the treatment of opioid-use disorders.

Introduction
Criminalisation of drug possession and use is common 
worldwide, with many Asian countries confi
 ning 
people who use drugs, or those suspected of using 
them, in specialized facilities called compulsory drug 
detention centres (CDDCs).1 In Malaysia, CDDCs were 
fi
 rst introduced in 1978 in response to a growing heroin 
epidemic and have been operated by the Malaysian 
National Anti-Drug Agency (NADA). As of 2010, NADA 
was operating 28 of these detention facilities housing 
7000 individuals. For those placed in CDDCs, national 
drug control laws mandate 2 years of detention, 
followed by community supervision for another 
18 months after release.2
Although Malaysia introduced opioid-agonist therapies 
and needle and syringe programmes in 2005 when it 
failed to meet its political goal of reducing HIV infections,2 
CDDCs remain central to drug control eff
 orts.3 By 2010, 
Malaysia’s Ministry of Health had expanded opioid 
agonist therapies in communities and prisons. The 
perceived eff
 ectiveness of community-based opioid 
agonist therapies in contrast to the perceived high failure

rates of CDDCs resulted in NADA partially shifting its 
policy toward treating addiction from compulsory, 
institutional interventions to voluntary, evidence-based 
treatment in line with that provided by the Ministry 
of Health.4 Several CDDCs were subsequently transitioned 
to VTCs, called Cure and Care centres, which provided 
inpatient and outpatient methadone maintenance with a 
menu 
of 
voluntary 
psychosocial 
interventions, 
recreational programming, and vocational training.5,6 By 
contrast with CDDCs, patients could voluntarily present 
themselves for treatment at VTCs. After a thorough 
medical assessment (which was not available in the 
CDDCs) patients at VTCs could receive 1 to 3 months of 
inpatient methadone treatment, followed by continued 
outpatient methadone maintenance upon release.
Up to now, no fi
 ndings from studies have supported 
any sustained rehabilitation benefi
 ts from CDDCs;7 
instead, they are associated with negative health 
consequences, increased HIV risk-taking, compounded 
stigma and discrimination, human rights violations, and 
absence of evidence-based practices in treating drug 
dependence.3,8,9 Despite many international agencies 
calling for all countries to close CDDCs over concerns of 
their ineff
 ectiveness and human-rights abuses,10 CDDCs 
continue to operate, and in some settings proliferate, 
across 
east 
and 
southeast 
Asia. 
Approximately 
600 000 people are mandatorily detained in more than 
1000 facilities annually.11–14

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We sought to compare the rates of relapse after mandatory 
confi
 nement in compulsory drug detention centres (CDDCs), 
where methadone was not available, with voluntary treatment 
programs providing methadone, for persons with opioid 
dependence. We reviewed the scientifi
 c literature by searching 
PubMed, EMBase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
and Google Scholar for any original articles published through 
December, 2015 with no language restrictions, with the search 
terms “methadone”, “opioid”, opiate”, “addiction”, “opioid 
substitution therapy”, opioid agonist therapy”, “methadone”, 
‘‘substance abuse’’, “substance use”, “dependence”, ”detention”, 
“forced treatment”, “compulsory treatment”, “mandated 
treatment”, “mandatory treatment”, “addiction”, “addiction 
treatment”, “involuntary treatment”, “involuntary addiction 
treatment”, “detained”, “compulsory”, “prison”, “jail”, “correction”, 
“incarc”, “eff
 ective”, “relapse”, and “urine drug testing”.
From our search we concluded that peer-reviewed research 
comparing the eff
 ects of voluntary opioid agonist therapies 
programmes with CDDCs on post-release opioid use outcomes 
is non-existent. The predominance of information on CDDC 
eff
 ectiveness is at a high risk of bias, and has equivocal fi
 ndings, 
as documented in a systematic review. By contrast, fi
 ndings 
from clinical trials and systematic reviews of community-based 
methadone maintenance therapy are available in Asia and 
other regions, and confi
 rm the eff
 ectiveness of methadone 
maintenance therapy for treating opioid dependence in 
reducing illicit opioid use compared with no pharmacological 
therapy. Similarly, fi
 ndings from several trials have shown the 
value of methadone provided in confi
 ned settings, with 
increased post-release treatment retention and decreased 
likelihood of relapse.
Although WHO recommends providing maintenance with 
opioid-agonist treatments such as methadone or 
buprenorphine as best practice for treating opioid dependence 
in prisoners with opioid dependence, CDDCs are not subjected 
to the same oversight, and such evidence-based 
pharmacological treatments for treating substance use disorders 
are not provided in these settings. Globally, only 40 countries 
provide treatment with methadone or buprenorphine in prison, 
albeit with low coverage rates. Many high-income countries 
such as Australia, Canada, and most of the European Union have 
made methadone maintenance therapy available in criminal 
justice settings. In Asia, only six countries provide methadone 
maintenance therapy in prisons, including Indonesia and 
Malaysia. In Asia where CDDCs exist, none provide methadone 
maintenance therapy, and because of this absence of drug 
treatments and the evidence of human rights abuses, many 
international agencies have called for their systematic closure.
Added value of this study
This is the fi
 rst prospectively assessed study that directly 
compared post-release drug use outcomes for people who 
completed so-called drug rehabilitation at CDDCs with those for 
participants of voluntary drug treatment centres (VTCs) in 
Malaysia. By designing a study that simultaneously assessed 
two diff
 erent, but coexisting, drug treatment programmes, we 
provided robust, previously unavailable information about the 
eff
 ectiveness of CDDCs and their role in relapse reduction 
compared with voluntary treatment with methadone. These 
striking fi
 ndings are also urgently needed to counter the 
continued expansion of CDDCs across the country and recent 
developments in the region where VTCs are being suspended or 
reverted to CDDCs, in the absence of documented evidence of 
their benefi
 t.
Implications of all the available evidence
The fi
 ndings from our study showed that relapse to opioid use 
is more likely and faster after release from CDDCs compared 
with VTCs suggesting that CDDCs have no role in the treatment 
of opioid use disorders. The sum of evidence strongly supports 
international calls for all countries in Asia that support CDDCs 
to cease such human rights violations and scale-up 
evidence-based treatments such as opioid agonist therapies 
that can be accessed voluntarily and made potentially available 
to individuals as part of an alternative to incarceration strategy.

centres all vary substantially. In most countries, 
detention in CDDCs is predicated by a complex interplay 
of individual, social, and political factors.15 The main 
reasons for entering CDDCs include a positive urine 
drug test, suspicion of illicit drug use by police, or 
insistence by family members.7,16 Proponents argue that 
these centres are central policy components of a 
comprehensive response to opioid use, and serve to 
balance individuals’ needs for rehabilitation with the 
right to safety for families and communities.17 
Individuals are held in these centres, however, which 
often do not have trained healthcare personnel or 
evidence-based drug treatments, without due process 
protections or judicial oversight of detention. Opioid 
agonist 
therapies 
such 
as 
methadone 
and 
buprenorphine, which are included in the model list of 
essential medicines by WHO for opioid dependence 
treatment, are unavailable;18 and instead, educational 
and vocational training programmes, and hard labour 
are often mandated.7
Despite more than 30 years of experience, concerns 
over CDDCs’ ineff
 ectiveness and continued expansion, 
few studies have empirically examined how CDDCs 
aff
 ect drug use outcomes. A systematic review19 of 
compulsory inpatient and outpatient treatment strategies 
showed little evidence that compulsory drug treatment is 
eff
 ective in promoting abstention from drug use or in 
reducing criminal recidivism. This review did not, 
however, compare the eff
 ectiveness of CDDCs relative to 
evidence-based treatment, such as voluntary medical 
treatment with opioid agonist therapies.
For our study, we took advantage of a unique 
opportunity where CDDCs coexisted with voluntary drug 
treatment centres (VTCs) providing methadone in 
Malaysia. This transition allowed contemporaneous 
comparison of two divergent policies towards addressing 
problematic drug use in Malaysia with objective drug 
treatment outcomes in opioid-dependent individuals. In 
our analysis, we compared the timing and occurrence of 
relapse with opioids and other illicit drugs confi
 rmed by 
urine drug testing between the two groups. Given the 
evidence of methadone’s eff
 ectiveness in reducing opioid 
use relative to treatment without opioid agonist therapies, 
we hypothesised that individuals transitioning to the 
community after release from VTCs would have fewer 
relapses and longer times to relapse than those released 
from CDDCs.
Methods
Study design
We did a parallel, two-arm, prospective study of opioid-
dependent individuals treated in two settings: Malaysian 
CDDCs and VTCs in the Klang Valley. We did not select a 
randomised design because the Malaysian judicial system 
determined who entered CDDCs. The study was approved 
by institutional review boards at the University of Malaya 
and Yale University, and by NADA, and the protocol, 
questionnaires, anonymised data, and analytic code are 
deposited publically.
Participants and setting
Eligibility criteria included being aged 18 years or older, 
the ability to provide informed consent, meeting criteria 
for opioid dependence,20 and intending to live in the Klang 
Valley. Assessed individuals in CDDCs were required to 
participate in non-evidence-based services, including 
individual, group and family counselling sessions, 
spiritual programmes, physical exercise, manual labour, 
and vocational training (eg, farming or electronics). In 
addition to methadone therapy, individuals enrolled in the 
VTC arm could access many of the components of the 
CDDC programme, but did so voluntarily.5,6,21 Recruitment 
in CDDCs occurred within 90 days before expected 
release. Common reasons for non-participation included 
not returning to Klang Valley, confi
 dentiality concerns, 
and concerns over potential harassment by law 
enforcement because of study participation.
We 
used 
sequential 
sampling 
for 
participant 
recruitment. During the recruitment periods, all facility 
attendees meeting eligibility criteria at three VTCs 
providing methadone maintenance therapy in Greater 
Kuala Lumpur and at six CDDCs were off
 ered study 
participation. Recruitment was halted early in September, 
2014, because of reversion of some VTCs to CDDCs; and 
because interim analyses revealed large diff
 erences 
between study arms in the primary outcome.
After group informational sessions, interested clients 
met privately with trained researchers to complete 
informed consent procedures. Everyone screened 
received referral information for healthcare and drug 
treatment. Consented participants were reimbursed 
RM50 (approximately US$15) for each visit and provided 
mobile phones with phone credit. Additional RM50 
bonuses were provided for completing all of the fi
 rst 
six and 12 follow-up interviews (one per month).

Procedures
Results from urine drug tests were obtained at baseline 
and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-release; baseline and 
monthly behavioral surveys were also obtained through 
12 months post-release. We interviewed participants about 
their demographic and social characteristics, incarceration 
or detention history, lifetime and recent drug use, addiction 
severity,22 opioid cravings using an 11-point Likert scale, 
motivation for drug treatment using SOCRATES,23 HIV 
testing and treatment history, social support,24 and drug-
related and sex-related HIV-risk behaviours. The survey 
was translated and back-translated to Bahasa Malaysia to 
ensure the accuracy of intended meaning. Researchers 
undertook 
and 
recorded 
urine 
drug 
tests 
for 
fi
 ve metabolites: opioids, methamphetamines, benzo-
diazepines, methadone, and buprenorphine using a 
custom RapiDip InstaTest (Cortez Diagnostics, CA, USA). 
The tests have good diagnostic accuracy, interoperator 
reliability, and perfor 
mance on interference testing with 
high specifi
 city when tested with other common 
metabolites. We also did HIV testing, but this is the subject 
of a companion analysis. Urine drug test assessments 
occurred on the day of release for CDDC participants and 
baseline surveys occurred within 90 days before, or 7 days 
after, release from CDDC or inpatient treatment at VTCs. 
Follow-up visits, especially those where urine drug testing 
assessments were made, were scheduled (within a 2-week 
target window) in person in a private setting. All interviews 
were conducted in Bahasa Malaysia.
Outcomes
The primary outcome, specifi
 ed a priori, was occurrence 
and timing of urine drug test-confi
 rmed opioid use in 
the community, because all participants met criteria for 
opioid dependence, the most frequently used illicit drug 
in Malaysia. Timing of relapse was based on free choice 
in the community and not within a controlled setting. A 
secondary outcome was urine drug test-confi
 rmed use of 
any of three illicit drug types: opioids, amphetamine-type 
substances, or benzodiazepines.
In our adjusted, weighted analyses, we included 
variables which could explain potential diff
 erences in 
treatment allocation or baseline risk of opioid relapse 
between the arms: receptiveness, ambivalence and taking 
steps towards change in drug use; daily heroin use before 
detention or inpatient VTC entry; age of fi
 rst drug use 
and years of heroin use; addiction severity; drug injection; 
previous drug treatment; lifetime use of alcohol, 
stimulants, benzodiazepines and non-heroin opioids; 
age; ethnicity; marital, housing, and education status; 
social support; and number of times imprisoned, jailed, 
and previously detained in a CDDC (appendix).
Statistical analysis
We used fi
 ve number summaries and Mann–Whitney 
U test statistics (continuous variables) or proportions and 
χ² test statistics (categorical variables) to compare group 
characteristics. For the main analyses, we employed time-
to-event approaches, for which the time origin was the 
fi
 rst day not being in a controlled environment (release 
date from CDDCs or inpatient VTC units). The target 
event was the fi
 rst positive urine drug test, assuming that 
any missing intervening follow-up measurements were

negative (non-events). With this defi
 nition, we censored 
observations only at the latest non-missing negative urine 
drug test, given that the event had not yet occurred.
For each group, we estimated Kaplan-Meier curves for 
time-to-relapse, cumulative relapse-free proportions at 
selected intervals, and median relapse times, applying the 
log-rank test of equality. In our prespecifi
 ed primary 
analysis, we employed Cox-regression with Efron’s 
method for ties handling. To account for potential 
selection eff
 ects, a logistic regression model of the 
propensity of seeking care at a VTC was developed using 
control variables measuring characteristics of participants 
before treatment allocation.25 Common support and 
balance diagnostics suggested good model performance 
(appendix).25 Inverse propensity of treatment scores were 
then incorporated as stabilised weights in the fi
 nal Cox 
regression with the remaining control variables (ie, opioid 
cravings and the SOCRATES subscales) included as 
explanatory variables with study arm as the main variable 
of interest (see appendix for further description of this 
approach and related robustness checks).26
Detecting the presence of a time-varying eff
 ect of study 
arm,27 we used Akaike Information Criteria to select a 
piece-wise model which included a time-varying 
specifi
 cation (appendix). We provided hazard ratio 
estimates for both the time-invariant and time-varying 
specifi
 cations, with the former interpretable as the 
averaged eff
 ect over the follow-up interval. We also 
plotted adjusted survival curves. These were implemented 
after a two-stage imputation approach to address partial 
missing information on length of inpatient stay for the 
VTC arm, timing of the fi
 rst urine drug test measurement 
for the CDDC arm, and baseline control variables 
(appendix 
contains 
description 
of 
missingness, 
imputation details, and related sensitivity analyses).
Because 
of 
attrition 
and 
missing 
follow-up 
measurements, we did several additional robustness 
checks (sensitivity analyses) by redefi
 ning our missing 
follow-up measurement assumptions in several ways, 
such that all missing follow-up urine drug tests were 
equivalent to a non-event; all missing follow-up urine 
drug tests were equivalent to an event; and missing 
follow-up urine drug tests were 25% likely to be events 
for CDDC participants and 75% likely to be events for 
VTC participants (ie, a 50% absolute diff
 erence). 
Analyses were done in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute 
Inc., Cary, NC). This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.
gov (NCT02698098).

and 95 (VTC) of these individuals had at least one 
subsequent urine drug test, representing our analytic 
sample (fi
 gure 1). Loss between recruitment and baseline 
measurement was due to inability to locate participants 
(including early release) and absence of communication 
with the study team. Delaying the origin of time from 
day of entry at the VTC to day of inpatient release reduced 
the VTC arm sample by between 13 and 34 participants 
depending on the imputation model used, representing 
attrition before the discharge date (appendix). The 
number of completed outcome measurements for each 
group were similar, with 50% completed at month 3 and 
a quarter to a third completed at month 12 (appendix).
Participants were similarly matched for most baseline 
characteristics (table 1) except that CDDC participants 
were older, had higher education levels, were incarcerated 
more frequently, were less likely to have injected opioids, 
and were less likely to be taking steps towards changing 
their drug use.
In unadjusted analyses, CDDC participants had 
signifi
 cantly more rapid relapse to opioid use post-release 
compared with VTC participants (median time to relapse 
31 days [95% CI 26–32] vs 352 days [256 to unestimable], 
log rank test, p<0·0001; table 2, fi
 gure 2, appendix); 
additional analyses with relapse to any drug use were 
similar (30 days [95% CI 24–32] vs 317 days [177 to 
unestimable]; table 2, appendix), favouring more rapid 
median time to relapse for CDDC participants (30 vs 
317 days, log rank test, p<0·0001). Cox-regression 
modelling, including inverse propensity score weighting 
and adjustment for post-treatment-assignment variables 
revealed consistent results (adjusted curves in fi
 gure 3; 
unadjusted, adjusted, and adjusted with time-varying 
group eff
 ect hazard ratios in table 3).
VTC participants had an 80% (95% CI 69–88) lower risk 
of opioid relapse—an eff
 ect that was accentuated to 84% 
(75–90) after adjustment using control variables and 
inverse propensity of treatment weights. Time-varying 
eff
 ect modelling revealed the largest hazard ratio reduction, 
of 91% (83–96), occurred during the fi
 rst 50 days of 
observation. This hazard ratio reduction diminished over 
the post-release period to 61% (12–83) at 180 days and by 
270 days a large diff
 erence remained in the arms. Moreover, 
increased craving for opioids at baseline corresponded to a 
reduction in hazard of relapse; hazard ratios for recognition 
of, ambivalence for, and taking steps towards changing 
drug use were not signifi
 cantly diff
 erent between the 
groups. Similar adjusted hazard ratio estimates were 
computed for any-illicit-drug use, including amphetamine-
type substances (appendix). Additionally, sensitivity 
analyses aff
 ecting the imputation of missing dates or 
alternate event coding did not substantively change the 
results for opioid or any-illicit-drug use (appendix).
Discussion
Our study showed opioid-dependent participants treated 
with methadone in VTCs experienced a seven-fold 
decreased risk of relapse to opioids and any-illicit-drug

after release, compared to similarly matched individuals 
released from CDDCs in Malaysia. Not only did we fi
 nd 
that relapse was markedly faster for those released from 
CDDCs compared to those treated in VTCs, but 
considered on its own, relapse to opioid use was rapid 
after CDDC release, suggesting CDDCs have no role in 
treating opioid use disorders. This is one of the fi
 rst peer-
reviewed study comparing objective drug use outcomes 
contemporaneously 
for 
opioid-dependent 
persons 
released from CDDCs with similar participants receiving 
evidence-based methadone maintenance in community-
based VTCs. It contributes to a growing body of evidence 
of how drug policies negatively impact individual and 
public health.28
The fi
 ndings here strongly support international calls 
for all countries that support CDDCs to cease operations 
in light of the ineff
 ectiveness of these centres in treating 
drug dependence. Simultaneously, these countries 
should scale-up evidence-based opioid agonist therapies 
such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance in 
communities, which should be encouraged and 
voluntary. 
Promisingly, 
policy 
modifi
 cations 
are 
underway in southeast Asia where some CDDCs are 
transitioning to VTCs where opioid agonist therapies are 
available.14 Yet, these fi
 ndings are also urgently needed to 
counter developments in Vietnam and Malaysia where 
VTCs are being suspended or reverted to CDDCs, in the 
absence of clear evidence that they reduce drug use.29
CDDCs share similarities with many prisons globally, 
where people who use drugs are concentrated, and 
transitions to the community are marked by similar high 
rates of drug relapse and disruptions in social networks. 
Findings from several countries empirically support 
provision of opioid agonist therapies within prisons for 
reducing within-prison transmission of blood-borne 
viruses.12 In the post-release period, opioid agonist 
therapies substantially reduce drug use and HIV 
transmission risk30 and increases retention in care,31,32 
especially if the opioid agonist therapy is optimally 
dosed.33 Unlike prisons, however, CDDCs do not adhere 
to international regulatory oversight because entry 
ignores judicial processes, and they do not provide an 
equivalence of treatment available in the community, 
including opioid agonist therapies and medical care.3,11,34
Despite the new fi
 ndings from this study, the data 
should be interpreted in the context of several 
considerations. First, the two comparison programmes 
diff
 er not just by the presence and absence of methadone 
maintenance therapy, but also by other optional services 
available and the voluntariness of the two strategies. Our 
study was not designed to isolate the precise 
component(s) responsible for the diff
 erence. However, 
given systematic reviews that document a substantial 
diff
 erence in treatment outcomes between drug-free 
treatment and patients prescribed opioid agonist 
therapies,35 methadone is likely to have played a 
prominent role in the observed diff
 erences. In this study, 
we specifi
 cally compared two policy programmes to 
address opioid dependence that coexist in several 
countries in Asia. Accordingly, we have not explored nor 
discussed all potential policy options, such as provision 
of opioid agonist therapies in compulsory settings or 
voluntary residential treatment without opioid agonist 
therapies.
Second, this study was observational in nature, such 
that treatment exposures were allocated non-randomly. 
Participants in the CDDC arm were detained by police 
for suspected or real drug use. By contrast, VTC 
participants probably sought treatment of their own 
volition, including through support from family and 
friends. This diff
 erence, however, is partly mitigated by 
our eligibility criteria for which only those meeting 
opioid 
dependence 
criteria 
were 
enrolled. 
We 
characterised latent dissimilarity between these two 
populations by obtaining several measures associated 
with drug relapse. These measures yielded only small 
diff
 erences, especially in addiction severity, between the 
two groups. We further incorporated these variables in 
our modelling to adjust for the diff
 erent propensities of 
seeking treatment.
Third, there was high attrition in our study. After 
recruitment, 53% participants in the CDDC arm 
completed baseline interviews and had at least one urine

Data compare the hazard of the specifi
 ed post-release or discharge opioid relapse in the voluntary treatment centres group 
versus the compulsory drug detention centres group. The unadjusted hazard ratios were estimated using Cox regression 
models for which group was the only covariate and no additional weighting was used. The adjusted Cox models 
additionally adjusted for measurements of opioid cravings and ambivalence, recognition, and taking steps towards change 
and applied inverse propensity of treatment weights. The adjusted, time varying group eff
 ects modifi
 ed the adjusted 
model by incorporating a time-varying (non-proportional) hazard for the group, implemented as an interaction between 
group and the logarithm of time beyond 50 days post-release. Stochastic regression for missing discharge and inpatient 
times was used; missing outcome measurements were ignored.

drug test, compared with 84% from the VTCs. 
Nonetheless, we noted considerable similarity between 
groups retained and subsequently analysed. Thus, for 
problematic bias to occur, we would have to believe that 
the full sample of CDDC participants were substantially 
less likely to relapse than the participants recruited from 
VTCs. Additionally, among those who had a baseline 
interview and at least one urine drug test (our analytic 
sample), attrition did not diff
 er between groups. This 
suggests that although the analysed sample might have 
been predisposed to more favourable outcomes, both 
groups were similarly aff
 ected. For this reason, estimates 
of the between-group eff
 ects are still likely to be valid. 
Furthermore, alternative event coding which assumed a 
large (50%) absolute diff
 erence in risk of event for missing 
values between each group produced fi
 ndings that 
remained signifi
 cant. Taken together, these limitations 
suggest that the fi
 ndings, while of strong internal validity, 
are likely to be most refl
 ective of a subset of people who 
use drugs in these settings, and may exaggerate the overall 
eff
 ects experienced had all people who use drugs in 
CDDCs been shifted to VTCs. Despite these limitations, 
this study provides clear evidence of the ineff
 ectiveness of 
CDDCs in addressing opioid dependence, and shows a 
several-fold decrease in relapse to opioid use after release 
among those prescribed methadone in VTCs.
Understanding the extent to which the eff
 ectiveness of 
methadone provided in VTCs is refl
 ected in other 
outcomes such as criminal activity, rearrest, HIV 
transmission, mortality, and quality-of-life, is important 
and requires further assessment. Findings from previous 
studies36,37 have shown that drug-treatment eff
 ectiveness is 
strongly associated with improvements in these indicators. 
Furthermore, rapid relapse to drug use after release from 
controlled settings like prisons is associated with high 
rates of HIV risk-behaviors,38 overdose, and death.39
These results are likely to be generalisable beyond 
Klang Valley to greater Malaysia, and more broadly, to 
other regions of east and southeast Asia. This conclusion 
is supported by evidence suggesting that relapse is 
common among released detainees who are not provided 
opioid agonist therapies in both Malaysian CDDCs3,40 and 
those elsewhere in Asia.7,41 This fi
 nding would also 
probably hold for settings where amphetamine-type 
substances 
are 
prevalent. 
For 
example, 
use 
of 
amphetamine-type substances was common in our 
sample of individuals with opioid dependence (around 
70% with lifetime use). Although there are currently no 
evidence-based pharmacological treatments for people 
with amphetamine use disorders, the fi
 rst quartile 
median time to relapse to use of amphetamine-type 
substances in our sample was 33 versus 355 days for 
CDDC and VTC participants, respectively. Even though it 
was beyond the scope of this study to examine outcomes 
for those using amphetamine-type substances but 
without opioid dependence, fi
 ndings here provide 
evidence that CDDCs are ineff
 ective in preventing 
relapse to use of amphetamine-type substances, and 
should be closed even in regions where amphetamine 
use disorders are common.
Although the individual and societal costs of 
maintaining CDDCs are high and despite incontrovertible 
evidence that Malaysia’s harm reduction programmes 
are cost-eff
 ective,42 government and public resistance to 
closure of CDDCs or even conversion to VTCs remains 
high.14 Key factors sustaining CDDCs in Malaysia include 
the country’s anachronistic culture of zero tolerance 
towards people who use drugs and abstinence-based 
treatment. In addition, NADA’s performance metrics are 
focused on maintaining or increasing arrests and 
detentions, rather than the societal goals of rehabilitation 
and public health that focus on reducing drug use, crime 
or recidivism, and HIV transmission.14,43
Since 2010, several international agencies have provided 
many regional consultations on CDDCs in Asia, from 
which an expert working group has been established to 
formulate evidence-based recommendations to support 
the transition to a comprehensive system of voluntary, 
community-based treatment, harm reduction and social 
support services. Along with these recommendations, this 
group proposes a three-step strategy for transition that 
includes establishing a national, multisectoral decision-
making mechanism with responsibility for the transition; 
implementing reforms to develop and strengthen the 
various mechanisms responsible for addressing operations 
and treatment of substance use disorders across diff
 erent 
sectors; and examining related drug policies, including 
laws, regulations, strategies and practices, and shifting 
away from criminalisation and punishment, to health-
based and rights-based drug policy measures.44
Despite regional consultations and a 2012 joint statement 
by 12 UN agencies calling for immediate closure of CDDCs 
and for implementation of voluntary, evidence-informed 
and rights-based health and social services in the 
community, CDDCs continue to operate in east and 
southeast Asia. Our study provides the fi
 rst prospective, 
comparative evidence that CDDCs are ineff
 ective in 
preventing drug relapse, especially when compared with 
voluntary evidence-based treatments like methadone. In 
light of this, and numerous studies documenting the cost-
eff
 ectiveness of opioid agonist therapies in treating opioid 
dependence, a renewed eff
 ort by governments to transition 
to and expand a comprehensive system of voluntary, 
community-based treatment is urgently needed, especially 
in Asia. Ultimately, this eff
 ort should be situated within a 
more comprehensive review of national and regional drug 
policies that continue to criminalise drug use and limit 
people who use drugs from accessing evidence-based 
treatment, care, and support.
