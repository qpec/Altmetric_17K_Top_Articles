episodic memory reconsolidation in humans

The adjustment of maladaptive thoughts and behaviors associated with emotional memories is central to treating
psychiatric disorders. Recent research, predominantly with laboratory animals, indicates that memories can become
temporarily sensitive to modification following reactivation, before undergoing reconsolidation. A method to
selectively impair reconsolidation of specific emotional or traumatic memories in humans could translate to an
effective treatment for conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder. We tested whether deep sedation could
impair emotional memory reconsolidation in 50 human participants. Administering the intravenous anesthetic
propofol following memory reactivation disrupted memory for the reactivated, but not for a non-reactivated,
slideshow story. Propofol impaired memory for the reactivated story after 24 hours, but not immediately after
propofol recovery. Critically, memory impairment occurred selectively for the emotionally negative phase of the
reactivated story. One dose of propofol following memory reactivation selectively impaired subsequent emotional
episodic memory retrieval in a time-dependent manner, consistent with reconsolidation impairment.
INTRODUCTION
Memory for traumatic experience can contribute to anxiety disorders
(1–3), such as specific phobias or trauma and stressor-related disor-
ders such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (4–6). An effective
treatment for these disorders should selectively decrease these intru-
sive, pathological memories. A theoretical obstacle to developing these
treatments has been a prevailing view that established memories are
relatively fixed. That is, memories are initially labile and sensitive to
interference by, e.g., electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (7), general an-
esthesia (8), or protein synthesis inhibition (9), but stabilize over time
during a period of consolidation, after which memories were
considered to be established and no longer sensitive to disruption or
modification (10). However, recent research using nonhuman animals
challenges this classical view by showing that reactivating an old
memory can temporarily return it to a labile state requiring restabili-
zation processes to persist, referred to as reconsolidation, and render-
ing the memory restabilization susceptible to manipulation (11).
The development of protocols to selectively reduce unwanted
memories via the disruption of reconsolidation could be of potential
clinical benefit. However, evidence for reconsolidation in humans re-
mains limited, primarily because the manipulations used to disrupt
memory in animals, such as protein synthesis inhibitors, are toxic.
Consequently, studies on reconsolidation in humans have largely used
behavioral manipulations to target nondeclarative memory (12), in-
cluding conditioned fear (13), which involves repeated pairings of a
conditioned stimulus with an aversive unconditioned stimulus such
as mild electric shock. Human psychopharmacological approaches
using the b-adrenergic antagonist propranolol before or after the reac-
tivation of conditioned fear for simple sensory stimuli show efficacy in
blocking reconsolidation (14, 15). The rationale for trialing b-adrenergic
antagonists in this context is based on previous reports that propranolol
blocks emotional memory encoding (16, 17) and retrieval (18). In
patient studies targeting reconsolidation to treat PTSD, b-adrenergic
antagonists have shown promise (19–21). It should be noted, how-
ever, that some studies have failed to replicate these reconsolidation
impairing effects in humans using behavioral manipulations (22, 23)
or propranolol (22–25) to target conditioned fear or using propran-
olol in patients with PTSD (26).
Traumatic memories are more complex than simple associations
formed by conditioning. These episodic memories are enriched with
what-where-when contextual information (27), and their retrieval can
be triggered by similar experiences (2, 28). Therefore, the modulation
of reconsolidation of rare traumatic memories may need different
manipulations than the ones used in previous studies using simple fear
conditioning (12). Most of the extant studies on episodic memory re-
consolidation have used noninvasive behavioral techniques, such as
post-reactivation interference learning to update memory (29) instead
of disrupting it. By contrast, we showed recently, in patients with uni-
polar depression, that ECT can selectively impair reconsolidation of a
reactivated emotional episodic memory (30). This study design met
criteria generated from nonhuman animal studies to provide compelling
evidence for the reconsolidation phenomena in humans (31). These
criteria include the requirement for (i) reactivation of consolidated
memory by a reminder cue and (ii) that the memory effect be observed
aftersufficient time haselapsed for reconsolidation to take place (typically
tested after 24 hours) and not immediately after reactivation (11, 30, 31).
A third criterion, which is important for interpreting data as a disrup-
tion of reconsolidation (32), is that the manipulation targeting recon-
solidation is delivered after reactivation and not before. This latter
criterion was also met.
ECT comprises the application of short-acting general anesthesia,
neuromuscular blockade, and cranial electrical stimulation to evoke
generalized seizure activity. Although we attributed ECT-induced re-
consolidation impairment in patients with depression to cranial elec-
trical stimulation, whether the different components of ECT could

 individually impair reconsolidation remains an open question. A pos-
sibility that the anesthetic was, in part, responsible for ECT-induced
reconsolidation impairment is particularly important, as the wide use
of this pharmacological class in clinical practice suggests that it could
be a relatively safe and accessible method to modify unwanted mem-
ories. The mechanism of action of most general anesthetics is the
modulation of g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, and data from
animal models have shown that administration of GABA receptor
type A (GABAA) agonists can disrupt reconsolidation (33–35). If anes-
thesia alone blocks reconsolidation, then targeted memory disruption
in patients with psychiatric disorders could be achieved without the
more invasive aspects of ECT. In support of this possibility, human
neuroimaging data demonstrate that general anesthetics disrupt activity
in the hippocampus and amygdala (36, 37), brain areas critically
involved in emotional memory (38). We therefore tested the hypothesis
that the intravenous anesthetic propofol impairs reconsolidation of
emotional memories reactivated immediately before anesthetic admin-
istration in psychiatrically and neurologically healthy individuals who
had been referred for endoscopy for clinical indications.
Fifty participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups (A
and B) matched for gender (Table 1). During emotional memory en-
coding, participants viewed slideshows of two distinct negative arous-
ing stories. Both stories comprised three phases: Phases 1 and 3 were
emotionally neutral, whereas phase 2 comprised the emotionally neg-
ative part of each story. The memory reactivation session took place
1 week after the encoding session (Fig. 1). To reactivate the memory
and initiate a memory destabilization process, patients were presented
with the first slide of one of the two stories and asked three questions
about what had been visible behind a mask placed over a part of the
slide. Immediately following memory reactivation, all participants re-
ceived propofol and underwent endoscopy (gastroscopy, colonoscopy,
or both) under deep sedation [depression of consciousness but spon-
taneous ventilation maintained (39)]. Memory for both stories was
tested using a multiple-choice memory test after 24 hours (group A)
or immediately after discharge from the recovery room (group B). All
participants completed the digit symbol substitution test (DSST), a
brief cognitive screening test of digit-symbol pairs, before emotional
memory encoding and memory testing.
RESULTS
Cognitive status before memory encoding and retrieval
Groups A and B performed equally in the DSST task (F1,47 = 2.72,
P = 0.11, h2
p = 0.055) (fig. S1). Both groups improved with repeti-
tion of the task. That is, there was a main effect of experiment time
point, encoding to recognition (F1,47 = 5.56, P = 0.023, h2
p = 0.106),
but no experiment time point by group interaction (F1,47 = 2.39, P =
0.13, h2
p = 0.048), indicating a comparable cognitive performance
across groups at the time of memory testing. Note that one participant
from group B was discarded from further analyses because of a
worsening of performance between the encoding and memory testing
phases (3 SDs below the mean), which could indicate still being under
the influence of propofol.
Propofol administration impairs emotional
memory reconsolidation
To test our hypothesis that memory would be impaired in group A,
but not group B, for the story reactivated before propofol administra-
tion, we performed a group (A and B) by reactivation (reactivated
story and nonreactivated story) repeated-measures analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) on recognition memory scores. Variables that could
have affected memory function were included as covariates of no in-
terest. These comprised years of education, propofol dose (mg/kg),
DSST performance immediately before the recognition test, which
of the two stories was reactivated, which endoscopic procedure was
performed (gastroscopy, colonoscopy, or both), and diagnostic out-
come of the procedure (as this may have influenced levels of anxiety
for a given patient). Furthermore, 27 of the 50 participants received
adjuvant agents during deep sedation, which included midazolam
or phenylpiperidine derivatives (Table 1); thus, adjuvant pharmaco-
logical agent administration during the endoscopy was also included
as a covariate of no interest.
Supporting a hypothesis that anesthesia disrupts emotional mem-
ory reconsolidation, we observed a group by reactivation interaction
(F1,40 = 4.84, P = 0.034, h2
p = 0.108) (Fig. 2A).There was no main effect
of reactivation (F1,40 = 0.31, P = 0.58, h2
p = 0.008) or group (F1,40 =
1.46, P = 0.23, h2
p = 0.035). Given that reconsolidation is a time-
dependent process, we had predicted that reactivation-induced
memory impairment should be present only in group A, but not in
group B, as in group B, reconsolidation would not yet be complete.
Confirming this prediction, planned paired t tests show reduced
memory for the reactivated versus nonreactivated story in group A
(t24 = −2.14, P = 0.043, d = 0.44), but no difference in memory for
the reactivated versus nonreactivated story in group B (t23 = −0.87,
P = 0.39, d = 0.17). The observed differences in recognition scores
between groups A and B are not due to differences in memory reac-
tivation, as there was no between-group difference in memory reac-
tivation scores for the first slide of the reactivated story immediately
Fig. 1. Study protocol. All patients, randomly assigned to one of two groups (A or B), underwent three sessions. Session 1 corresponded to day 1 and was the
encoding session of the two emotional stories. Session 2 took place 7 days after day 1. All participants performed a memory reactivation task for one of the two
emotional stories in the endoscopy unit. Immediately after, they received propofol, followed by the endoscopy procedure. For group B, session 3, the recognition
memory test took place after the participants recovered from the procedure and were discharged from the recovery room. For group A, session 3 took place 24 hours
after the endoscopy.

 before propofol administration (t47 = 0.70, P = 0.49, d = 0.20), i.e.,
both groups reactivated memory and performed above chance level
(fig. S2).
Both stories consisted of three phases: Phase 1 (slides 1 to 4) and
phase 3 (slides 9 to 11) were of neutral content, whereas the middle
part of the stories, phase 2 (slides 5 to 8), had emotionally negative
content. Although we did not observe selectivity of reconsolidation
disruption for any particular phase of the stories in our previous study
involving ECT, recognition accuracy was generally low in those pa-
tients with severe depression, and we did not observe the typical en-
hancement of memory for the emotional phase of the stories (16).
However, on examining recognition scores for reactivated versus non-
reactivated stories as a function of phase in group A of the current
study (Fig. 2B), selective reactivation–induced memory impairment
for the emotional part of the story was evident. On post hoc testing,
we observed memory differences for phase 2 between the reactivated
versus nonreactivated stories [tphase2(24) = −3.05, P = 0.006, P = 0.033

analyses because of outlier-level performance on the DSST before recognition testing. Groups A and B did not differ on any demographical variables (age,
gender, years of education, or type of endoscopy procedure) or in terms of dosage of other agents (midazolam or alfentanil) administered. However, there was a
significant difference in the amount of propofol administered.

 reactivation did not affect memory for the neutral phases of the stories
[tphase1(24) = −0.56, P = 0.58, d = −0.11; tphase3(24) = −1.20, P = 0.91, d =
−0.024]. We observed no difference for any of the three phases in
group B (P > 0.25 for all phases) (Fig. 2B).
Emotional memory reconsolidation impairment is not
correlated with propofol dose
Propofol was administered entirely for clinical reasons, not for the
purposes of the current study. To obtain deep sedation in all patients
undergoing endoscopy, prescribed propofol doses are adjusted relative
to the weight, age, and clinical condition of the patient. Critically, the
degree of sedation was similar for all participants in our study. However,
despite randomized group assignment, group A was prescribed, on
average, a higher total propofol dose than group B (t47 = 2.04, P =
0.047, d = 0.59) (Table 1). To mitigate the likelihood that this dose
difference contributed to the observed memory impairment in group
A and not in group B, we included the dose of propofol as a covariate
in the group by reactivation ANOVA described above. Furthermore,
we found no linear association between the dose of propofol and phase 2
(emotional) recognition scores in group A (Pearson’s rreactivated = 0.22,
P = 0.30; rnonreactivated = −0.007, P = 0.97; rreactivated minus nonreactivated =
0.17, P = 0.40) or in group B (Pearson’s rreactivated = 0.12, P = 0.56;
rnonreactivated=−0.005,P=0.98;rreactivated minus nonreactivated=0.10,P=0.63)
(fig. S3). Last, we performed a median split on group A based on propofol
dose and repeated the comparison of reactivated versus nonreactivated
recognition scores for phase 2 (the emotional phase), taking only those
13 participants at, or below, the median propofol dose (2.97 mg/kg). The
reactivation-induced reconsolidation impairment observed in group A
(Fig. 2B) remains statistically significant in this subgroup [tphase2(12) =
−2.61,P=0.023,d=−0.73].Wethereforefoundnoevidencethatpropofol
dose accounts for the specific memory impairment of the emotional part
of the reactivated story in group A. This suggests that deep sedation, and
not propofol dose per se, is the important factor determining reconso-
lidation impairment.
Endoscopic procedure is unlikely to contribute to
reconsolidation impairment in group A
Short-acting deep sedation is administered relatively routinely in the
hospital setting. Thus, instead of exposing healthy participants to an-
esthesia that they would otherwise not need, we elected to perform the
current study on psychiatrically and neurologically healthy individ-
uals referred for endoscopy. The effects of propofol on memory recon-
solidation were therefore studied in the context of an endoscopic
procedure. This procedure may stimulate the vagus nerve either at
esophagealintubation duringgastroscopy orbystretching of the sigmoid
mesentery during colonoscopy. Although the memory consequences
of vagal stimulation in this context are unknown, continuous electri-
cal stimulation of the vagus nerve in human patients with implanted
stimulators has been shown to modulate cerebral blood flow in dif-
ferent brain areas, including the hippocampus and amygdala (40),
raising a possibility that vagal stimulation contributed to the ob-
served memory effects. However, it is reasonable to assume that those
individuals undergoing both gastroscopy and colonoscopy would
obtain more vagal stimulation than those having just one procedure.
That is, whereas the effect of propofol does not depend on the dosage
and would appear to reflect sedation level per se, any effect of vagal
stimulation on reconsolidation could depend on total stimulation.
We therefore tested the reconsolidation effects in group A and found
these to be equivalent across the three subgroups undergoing either or
both interventions when taking recognition scores for the entire story
(F2,22 = 2.41, P = 0.11, h2
p = 0.018) or just for the emotional phase 2
(F2,22 = 0.47, P = 0.63, h2
p = 0.041). This makes it unlikely that vagal
stimulation contributes to the memory effects we observe. In any case,
vagal stimulation is thought to up-regulate memory (41), so if anything,

 this could have obscured reconsolidation disruption instead of con-
tributing to it.
DISCUSSION
We demonstrate that a single dose of the GABAA agonist propofol
following memory reactivation impaired reactivated, but not non-
reactivated, episodic memory. In keeping with an explanation in
terms of reconsolidation impairment, this reduction was only ob-
served if tested 24 hours (group A), but not immediately (group B),
after memory reactivation and propofol administration. Post hoc
testing indicated that the memory impairment by propofol was se-
lective for the negative phase of the reactivated story.
Evidence for the disruption of reconsolidation by anesthesia de-
rives from animal studies investigating fear-conditioned memories
(33–35).To date, the effects of general anesthesia have onlybeentested
on emotional memory encoding in humans (36, 37). The anesthetic
gas sevoflurane, a GABAA agonist, was shown to block the episodic
memory enhancement associated with emotional arousal at subanes-
thetic doses, an effect associated with a reduction in connectivity be-
tween the amygdala and hippocampus during simultaneous glucose
positron emission tomography scanning (36). This result in humans
is supported by analogous data from rats showing that propofol (42)
and sevoflurane (43) impair emotional learning, but not in animals
that had undergone previous lesions to the amygdala. We therefore
speculate that human amygdala activity may be highly sensitive to
the inhibitory effects of anesthesia and that the emotional memory re-
consolidation disruption by propofol observed here is possibly
mediated by a down-regulation in amygdala and hippocampal activity
and their coupling. A confirmation of this mechanism would be rele-
vant to any application of propofol in the management of PTSD, as a
disturbance in this circuit is considered a key pathophysiological fea-
ture of PTSD (4, 6).
An alternative potential mechanism underlying the effects of
propofol on emotional memory reconsolidation we observe is via
influencing the noradrenergic system. In vivo recordings in rodents
have shown that propofol inhibits spontaneous firing in locus coeruleus
(LC) (44). The noradrenergic antagonist propranolol has been shown
to impair reconsolidation of conditioned fear but not episodic memory
(14), making it less likely that the episodic memory reconsolidation im-
pairment we observe reflects an effect of propofol on the noradrenergic
system. We did not test for an effect of propofol on simple associative
(conditioned) fear memory reconsolidation, but it is possible that pro-
pofol could impair reconsolidation of fear-conditioned memories via its
action on LC. If this is not the case, the administration of both propofol
and propranolol with a reminder cue may be required to inhibit con-
ditioned fear and the episodic memory associated with the conditioning
event. Reports that propranolol does disrupt reconsolidation of emo-
tional episodic memory (45) would suggest that reconsolidation of both
episodic emotional memory and conditioned fear could be disrupted by
an effect of propofol on LC. However, in these studies, drug adminis-
tration typically precedes memory reactivation, raising a possibility that
any reduction in memory performance on subsequent testing reflects a
sustained retrieval failure at reactivation (18, 26, 46) and not a disrup-
tion of reconsolidation, leaving the risk of the return of memory. The
current design does not suffer from this limitation in interpreting the
results as a disruption of reconsolidation, as administration of propofol
is intravenous and therefore acts immediately following successful
memory reactivation.
Considering recognition scores for each story in their entirety,
our previous study (30) showed an ECT-evoked memory reduction in
patients with depression of 8.48% down to chance levels, whereas in
the current study, propofol-evoked reduction was 5.71%. Effect sizes
for memory for the reactivated versus nonreactivated story in group A
(Cohen’s d = 0.44) was lower than following ECT in the analogous
group in our previous study (Cohen’s d = 0.90) (30). However, the
effect of propofol is qualitatively different from that we reported for
ECT, with propofol selectively reducing memory for the emotional
phase of the reactivated story by 12.29% and not the neutral phases.
Thus, whereas ECT may be a more potent method to disturb emotion-
al episodic memory reconsolidation, propofol is less invasive and may
be more selective to the emotional content of memories. Note that in
our previous ECT study, the anesthetic administered as part of ECT
was etomidate (30). Like propofol, etomidate potentiates the effects of
GABA on GABAA receptors (47) and is known to impair learning and
memory (48). However, etomidate also produces adrenal cortical in-
hibition. Given the role of cortisol in emotional memory (49), we es-
chewed this potential confound by performing this study in
participants receiving propofol.
Determining the mechanism by which propofol reduces emotional
memory (story phase 2) reconsolidation down to the same level as
neutral memory (phases 1 and 3) will address a more fundamental
question regarding the effects of emotion on memory. These observa-
tions suggest that either there is a degraded episodic memory that re-
tains an emotional enhancement or reconsolidation of the emotional
enhancement is impaired by propofol. Analogous effects of a reduction
of emotional memory performance to the same level as neutral memory
are observed following administration of propranolol (16–18, 50) or
sevoflurane (36) at encoding. What is currently unknown is whether
emotion simply strengthens the consolidation of an otherwise neutral
memory trace or there is a qualitative difference between emotional
and neutral memories. If the latter was the case, this would raise the
additional question of whether the emotional and neutral components
of an emotional memory are independent, but associated, or these two
components are necessarily integrated and indivisible. Although the
current results cannot discern between these possibilities, we do dem-
onstrate that propofol evokes the same pattern of deficit at reconsoli-
dation as is observed following pharmacological disruption of
emotional memory consolidation.
In contrast to the current study, our previous ECT experiment (30)
included a third group (group C), for which patients with severe de-
pression underwent the same emotional memory protocol but were
not given ECT following memory reactivation. Here, we elected not
to include an analogous nontreatment control group for two reasons.
First, group C patients in our previous study showed memory en-
hancement for the reactivated material in the absence of ECT. Although
this enhancement was observed in patients with severe depression, it is
likely that a similar enhancement would occur in the current study,
given cross-species evidence from rodents (51) and healthy human
participants (52) that reactivation can strengthen episodic memory
via reconsolidation in the absence of post-reactivation treatment de-
signed to impair it. Second, as propofol was administered as part of a
clinical intervention, a nontreatment control group (i.e., a group not
undergoing deep sedation plus endoscopy following memory reactiva-
tion) would have differed on key aspects besides anesthesia that would
have likely influenced memory function. These include the absence of
anxiety associated with the endoscopic procedure and diagnostic out-
come, as well as the anxiety associated with undergoing anesthesia.

 We demonstrate propofol-induced reconsolidation impairment at
an interval of 24 hours after reactivation and deep sedation. Testing
memory after a longer period (e.g., 1 week) would have allowed us to
determine whether memory recovers over time. Memory recovery at
1 week would indicate that the reduced recognition memory for the
reactivated story observed in group A at 24 hours reflects a temporary
retrieval impairment or temporary inhibition of the memory trace and
not a reconsolidation blockade. However, the current paradigm is not
suited to repeated memory testing (i.e., immediately after recovery
from propofol, at 24 hours and at 1 week) within the same individuals.
The multiple-choice questionnaires are highly structured, providing
substantial information for new learning of the stories that would ren-
der performance on a repeat memory test a poor indication of what is
remembered from the initial learning experience. This is why we
elected to have two groups (immediate testing and at 24-hour delay),
as opposed to one group being tested both immediately and at 24 hours,
to prevent confounding effects of new learning during recognition.
The aim of this study was to test for a method to reduce aversive
episodic memories in a relatively noninvasive way by reactivating these
memories before a dose of intravenous anesthetic is administered. The
results presented here pertain to impairing the reconsolidation of
aversive episodic memories learned in an experimental context by
healthy individuals. Thus, these emotional memories remain quite dis-
tant from those formed during truly stressful life experiences. While
here we provide a proof of concept that a routine anesthetic procedure
impairs reconsolidation and could potentially be used to treat psychi-
atric disorders in which abnormal emotional memory plays a role, clin-
ical trials are required to apply these findings to patients with
pathological, traumatic memories. Reactivation of these memories
before propofol administration could be achieved by simple script-
driven recall through to immersive virtual reality, tailored to the pa-
tients’ traumatic event. However, we note that disorders such as PTSD
are multifaceted disorders. PTSD involves recurrent, intrusive recollec-
tion of the trauma memory and peritraumatic memory disturbances
(4, 5, 53), and these different facets may vary in sensitivity to alteration
following reactivation. One limiting factor may be the age of the
memory; in some animal models, older memories seem to be more re-
sistant to reconsolidation blockade (54). However, there is also evi-
dence that altering parameters of the reactivation session, such as
increasing duration (55), can destabilize remote memories (56). The
administration of propofol with simultaneous recording of the
electroencephalogram may provide useful markers of the depth of se-
dation and loss of consciousness (57) potentially predictive of efficacy
of reconsolidation impairment across patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
Fifty participants, without history of neurological and psychiatric
illnesses, were recruited from the gastroenterology clinic of the Hospital
Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, with an age range of 30 to 45 years
(Table 1). Participants were invited to join the study because they had
been referred for a routine endoscopy procedure (gastroscopy and/or
colonoscopy) involving brief, deep sedation. Participants were ran-
domly assigned to one of two groups (A and B) matched for gender
(15 men per group). All participants were free of psychoactive medica-
tion and were only under stable pharmacological treatment related to
gastrointestinal conditions (22 of 50 participants). The two groups did
not differ in terms of age, educational level, and endoscopic procedure
or ensuing diagnosis (Table 1). The ethical committee of the Hospital
Clínico San Carlos approved the study, and all participants provided
written informed consent after the nature and possible consequences
of the studies were explained. All methods were carried out in accord-
ance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Emotional stories
Participants viewed slideshows of two distinct negative arousing stories
on a 16″ laptop computer screen. Each story consisted of 11 slides, each
accompanied by an auditory narrative, presented via computer speak-
ers through the integrated device high-definition audio (mean: 62 dB,
in a range between 42 and 80 dB at a distance of 15 cm). Each slide was
shown for 20s, with atotalpresentation time of 3.6min per story. Story 1
contained scanned analog images, whereas story 2 consisted of mod-
ern digital photographs. To minimize interference due to learning two
stories in a short period of time, the narrator for story 1 was male, and
the narrator for story 2 was female (30). Both stories were adapted to
the Spanish language and were identical in structure, grammar, and
details. Both stories comprised three phases: Phase 1 (slides 1 to 4)
was emotionally neutral, phase 2 (slides 5 to 8) comprised the emo-
tionally negative part of each story, and phase 3 (slides 9 to 11) was
again of neutral content.
Emotional memory encoding
Session 1 took place in the gastroenterology consulting room 1 week
before the patient’s endoscopy (Fig. 1). The order in which the two
narrated slideshow stories were presented was randomized across
participants. The encoding session for both stories lasted for ap-
proximately 15 min.
Memory reactivation
This session took place 1 week after the encoding session. Once the
participant was supine in the hospital endoscopy room and the in-
travenous cannula was placed, memory for one of the two stories
was reactivated. Which of the two stories was reactivated was count-
erbalanced across participants within each group (for 12 participants
in each group, story 1 was reactivated). To reactivate the memory and
initiate a destabilization process, patients were presented with the first
slide of one of the two stories and asked three questions about what
had been visible behind a mask placed over a part of the slide. After the
patient answered the question, the related part of the mask was re-
moved. The entire slide was visible after all three questions were
answered. Answers were provided by free recall and recorded using
a tape recorder by the investigator. If the patient was unable to answer
freely, a two-alternative forced choice question was posed. Reactiva-
tion score was calculated as the number of questions answered cor-
rectly by free recall (multiplied by 2) plus the number of correctly
answered questions by multiple choice (yielding a maximum score
of 6). Immediately following memory reactivation, all participants re-
ceived propofol and underwent endoscopy. The reactivation session
lasted for approximately 1 to 2 min.
Deep sedation
All participants were administered propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol)
by an anesthetist; initial dose: 100 to 200 mg; additional doses: intra-
venous (IV) dose of 25 to 75 mcg/kg per minute or incremental IV
bolus doses of 30 to 50 mg. Furthermore, 27 of the 50 participants re-
ceived adjuvant agents (Table 1), which included midazolam or pheny-
lpiperidine derivatives (alfentanil or remifentanil). That is, although all

 participants received propofol, the memory study did not interfere with
the individual anesthetist’s prescribing preferences for adjuvant agents.
Two participants in each group were administered both midazolam and
alfentanil as adjuvant agents. Only one participant in group B received
remifentanil (2 mcg). Participants maintained spontaneous ventilation
and were monitored with a peripheral pulse oximeter for SpO2. Across
all participants, the mean (SD) duration under deep sedation was
12.3 (6.6) min with no significant between-group difference in duration
(Table 1).
Memory testing
Memory for both stories was tested after 24 hours (group A) or
after 27 to 105 min (group B), which corresponded to the time taken
for group B participants to recover from the procedure and be dis-
charged from the recovery room (mean: 60.4 min; SD: 21.3 min).
Memory was assessed using a multiple-choice test (30) conducted in
the same consultation room where the stories were initially encoded.
Following the order of the 11 presented slides, three to five multiple-
choice questions were posed per slide with four answer options.
Memory performance on the first slide for both stories was excluded
from the memory score, as this slide was used for memory reactiva-
tion. Testing memory for both stories required approximately 1 hour.
Digit Symbol Substitution Test
The DSST was completed by all participants before emotional memory
encoding and memory testing. For nine digit-symbol pairs, the task was
to write down the associated digits underneath 115 symbols as fast and
with as few errors as possible.
Statistical analysis
Recognition memory scores were entered into ANOVA, with effect
sizes reported as partial h2 (h2
p). t test effect sizes were reported as
Cohen’s d. For paired t tests, the values provided pertain to drm
(Cohen’s effect size for repeated measures). All t tests are two-tailed.
For ANOVAs, the assumption of sphericity was assessed by Mauchly’s
test, and Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used if applicable.
