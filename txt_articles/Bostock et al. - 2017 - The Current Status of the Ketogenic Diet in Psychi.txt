Background: The ketogenic diet (KD) has been used in treatment-resistant epilepsy 
since the 1920s. It has been researched in a variety of neurological conditions in both 
animal models and human trials. The aim of this review is to clarify the potential role of 
KD in psychiatry.
Methods: Narrative review of electronic databases PubMED, PsychINFO, and Scopus.
Results: The search yielded 15 studies that related the use of KD in mental disorders 
including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These studies comprised nine 
animal models, four case studies, and two open-label studies in humans. In anxiety, 
exogenous ketone supplementation reduced anxiety-related behaviors in a rat model. In 
depression, KD significantly reduced depression-like behaviors in rat and mice models in 
two controlled studies. In bipolar disorder, one case study reported a reduction in symp-
tomatology, while a second case study reported no improvement. In schizophrenia, an 
open-label study in female patients (n = 10) reported reduced symptoms after 2 weeks 
of KD, a single case study reported no improvement. In a brief report, 3 weeks of KD in a 
mouse model normalized pathological behaviors. In ASD, an open-label study in children 
(n = 30) reported no significant improvement; one case study reported a pronounced 
and sustained response to KD. In ASD, in four controlled animal studies, KD significantly 
reduced ASD-related behaviors in mice and rats. In ADHD, in one controlled trial of KD 
in dogs with comorbid epilepsy, both conditions significantly improved.
Conclusion: Despite its long history in neurology, the role of KD in mental disorders is 
unclear. Half of the published studies are based on animal models of mental disorders 
with limited generalizability to the analog conditions in humans. The review lists some 
major limitations including the lack of measuring ketone levels in four studies and the 
issue of compliance to the rigid diet in humans. Currently, there is insufficient evidence 
for the use of KD in mental disorders, and it is not a recommended treatment option. 
Future research should include long-term, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled 
crossover dietary trials to examine the effect of KD in various mental disorders.

iNTRODUCTiON
The ketogenic diet (KD) has a long-standing place in neurology 
and has been used for treatment-resistant epilepsy since the 1920s 
(1). KD consists of a rigidly controlled high-fat, low-protein, and 
low-carbohydrate diet usually with a 4:1 lipid:non-lipid ratio (fat 
to protein and carbohydrate ratio) (2). Woodyatt noted that in a 
normal person in a state of starvation or eating a diet contain-
ing low carbohydrate and a high percentage of fat, the ketones 
acetone, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyric acid increase (3), 
and the absence of glucose serves as alternative fuels for the body. 
KD has been proven an effective treatment in difficult-to-control 
seizures with its use primarily in children with epilepsy (4, 5), 
particularly those with epileptic encephalopathies whereby epi-
leptic activity may contribute to severe neurological and cognitive 
impairments (6). The finding that KD is beneficial for epilepsy 
was supported by a systematic review (7), meta-analysis (8), and 
a Cochrane review (9). KD and related diets have been proven 
useful in pharmacoresistant childhood epilepsy (10).
The mechanism by which KD acts is not clearly understood. 
However, among the many hypotheses advanced, elevation of 
brain acetone may account for the efficacy of the diet in epilepsy 
as it has proven anticonvulsant effects (11). In a variation of the 
diet, the medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) KD increases plasma 
levels of decanoic acid, which in vivo has been shown to be 
anticonvulsant; although the precise mechanism remains unclear 
(12). In young and adult rats, KD increases concentrations of 
kynurenic acid (KYNA) in the hippocampus and striatum but 
not the cortex (13). Elevated levels of KYNA in the cerebrospinal 
fluid have been demonstrated in patients with schizophrenia 
(14) and bipolar disorder (15). Pharmacological manipulation 
of kynurenines is a potential treatment strategy for psychiatric 
disorders (16).
Currently, there are no international protocols guiding the 
implementation of the diet, rather dietary recommendations are 
based on individual treating physician’s advice. Consequently, 
there exists a need for more standardized protocols for manage-
ment recommendations for clinical and research use (17). In 2006, 
a group of 26 pediatric epileptologists and dieticians was convened 
to create a consensus statement regarding the clinical management 
of KD. They specified the following absolute contraindications to 
commencing KD “carnitine deficiency (primary), carnitine pal-
mitoyltransferase (CPT) I or II deficiency, carnitine translocase 
deficiency, beta-oxidation deficiencies including medium-chain 
acyl dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD), long-chain acyl dehy-
drogenase deficiency (LCAD), short-chain acyl dehydrogenase 
deficiency (SCAD), long-chain 3-hydroxyacl-CoA deficiency, 
medium-chain 3-hydroxyacl-CoA deficiency, pyruvate carboxy-
lase deficiency and porphyria. Relative contraindications of KD 
include the following: inability to maintain adequate nutrition, 
surgical focus identified by neuroimaging and video EEG 
monitoring, and parent or caregiver non-compliance” (18). The 
possible risks of KD must be weighted against its potential value 
for seizure control or its other benefits (19).
Ketogenic diet has been assessed in a variety of neurological 
conditions other than epilepsy in both animal models and human 
trials. In an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
SOD1-G93A transgenic mice were fed KD. It was shown that 
KD led to significant alterations in the clinical manifestation 
of the disease, specifically a higher motor neuron count in the 
lumbar spinal cord and preserved motor function (20). KD has 
also been trialed in rats following controlled cortical impact 
injury, a model for brain trauma, showing that the diet improves 
both cognitive and motor functioning (21). In an animal model 
of multiple sclerosis, the effects of KD on memory impairments 
and inflammation expressed by experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis were examined. In mice, it was demonstrated 
that brain inflammation was associated with impaired spatial 
learning and memory function, and the administration of KD 
exerted protective effects against these. The proposed mode of 
action was through attenuation of the immune response and 
increased oxidative stress observed in the mice (22).
In humans, KD has been trialed in a number of neurological 
conditions. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group study in Alzheimer’s disease, an oral ketogenic 
compound AC-1202 was tested on 152 patients. Regular medi-
cations were continued throughout the study. Daily dosing of 
AC-1202 significantly elevated the levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate 
2 h after administration. After 45 and 90 days, patients treated 
with AC-1202 had significant improvements on the ADAS-Cog 
scale (23). In a small study of seven patients with Parkinson’s 
disease, five adhered to KD for 28 days (24). Scores on the 
Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale improved in all five 
as did symptoms such as resting tremor, freezing, balance, gait, 
mood, and energy levels. These results should be interpreted with 
caution due to the small sample size, subjective ratings, and the 
lack of a control group to exclude a placebo effect. The modified 
Atkins diet (a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet), which creates a 
ketotic state was trialed in adolescent patients with chronic daily 
headaches (25). Due to difficulties adhering to the diet, the study 
was terminated prematurely. Three participants reported an 
improvement in headache severity and quality of life; however, 
they still required pharmacotherapy to manage their condition. 
In a comprehensive review of KD in diverse neurological condi-
tions, Stafstrom and Rho concluded that there are rich opportuni-
ties for further investigation of KD in both the laboratory and 
clinical practice (26).
The therapeutic advantage of KD has been replicated in animal 
models of neurological illnesses, and the purported underlying 
mechanisms include those which improve mitochondrial func-
tion (27). Molecular, biochemical, and physiological studies 
tend to support the assumption that cellular energy status is a 
determinant for multiple disorders (28). Aberrant energy pro-
duction has been associated with cancer (29), heart failure (30), 
aging (31), and neurological conditions such as epilepsy (32) and 
Alzheimer’s disease (33). The precise pathways by which energy 
disruption is related to these and other disorders are unknown. 
There are also strong indications of metabolic pathways involv-
ing energy production in the pathophysiology of some mental 
disorders including bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia 
(34) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (35), and potentially atten-
tion deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (36). There is also a 
recognized comorbidity between epilepsy and mental disorders 
(37), which might indicate some commonality of mechanisms.

Given the degree of interest in KD and neurological condi-
tions, the aim of this narrative review is to examine the effect of 
the diet in mental disorders. The literature searched in anxiety, 
depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, ASD, and ADHD.
MeTHOD
A comprehensive search of the electronic databases PubMed, 
PsychINFO, and Scopus for peer-reviewed articles published in 
English was conducted in the last week of November 2016 and 
updated in January 2017. Search terms were “bipolar disorder” 
“manic depress*” “depress*” “schizophren*” “autism” “ASD” 
“attention deficit hyperactivity disorder” “
ADHD” “obsessive 
compulsive disorder” “OCD” “anxiety” “anxi*” “psychiatry” 
“mental disorder*” (group 1) AND “ketogenic diet” “ketosis” 
“ketogenesis” “ketone bodies” “high fat low carbohydrate” “diet” 
“acetone” “acetoacetic acid” “beta-hydroxybutyric acid” “acetyl-
coA” “ketonemia” “ketonuria” “fatty acid metabolism” “hyper-
ketonemia” “fasting” “nutritional ketosis” “acidotic” (group 2). 
These terms were combined as follows: group 1 AND group 2. In 
addition, a hand-search of the reference lists of published articles 
was also conducted, and articles were assessed for their suitabil-
ity in the review. An initial search was conducted using all the 
search terms listed above, and abstracts were reviewed by author 
Emmanuelle C. S. Bostock. Full text publications were retrieved 
for those that addressed the subject matter.
ReSULTS
The results are discussed by mental disorders examining animal 
and human studies including case reports and studies of patient 
groups. The search yielded 15 studies that examined KD in men-
tal disorders, specifically anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, 
schizophrenia, autism, and, ADHD. These studies included nine 
animal models, and in humans four case studies and two uncon-
trolled trials. A summary of results by animal models and human 
studies are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
Anxiety
Anxiety is a common mental disorder affecting 18.1% of the 
population in the United States (52). In humans, functional 
magnetic resonance imaging indicates that anxiety is associated 
with activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and hip-
pocampal regions of the brain (53). Symptoms of anxiety and 
disorders are more frequent in patients with epilepsy with one 
recent study reporting a lifetime incidence of 22.8% as opposed 
to 11.2% in people without epilepsy (54).
In a recent animal model study of anxiety in male rats, two 
methods of administration of exogenous ketone supplement were 
applied (38). In the chronic administration condition, 48 male 
Sprague-Dawley (SPD) rats were fed for 83 days with either a 
standard diet (n = 9) or standard diet plus one of four ketone 
supplementation conditions. In the sub-chronic intragastric 
gavage bolus condition, 39 SPD rats were fed with standard diet 
and gavaged daily with water (control, n = 11) or 1 of 3 levels 
of ketone supplementation for 7 days; this was repeated with 
32 Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk rats receiving a half-dose of 
supplementation. In both modes of supplementation, beta-
hydroxybutyrate was significantly elevated indicating ketosis. All 
treatment conditions resulted in reduced anxiety as assessed by 
behavior on the elevated plus maze. The dependent variables of 
less entries and time spent in closed arms, more entries and time 
spent in open arms, more distance traveled in open arms, and 
delayed entry to closed arm were used as an analog of anxiety 
in humans. The authors hypothesized that the mode of action 
was through the glutamatergic and/or GABAergic and purinergic 
systems.
Depression
In a recent review, a number of studies suggested that depression 
is associated with an increased risk of epilepsy (55). The effec-
tiveness of conventional antidepressant therapies is frequently 
examined in animals. In rodents, to test current levels of depres-
sion, a methodology known as the Porsolt forced swim test is 
often employed (56) and has been used in testing the effectiveness 
of new antidepressant drugs (57). In the two-part swim test, 
animals are first placed in a container from which they cannot 
escape. When they then stop trying and immobility ensues, a state 
of behavioral despair is shown. Second, to assess the effects of 
antidepressants, the time spent immobile is used as a dependent 
variable, and reductions are interpreted for significance (56). 
To examine the antidepressant properties of KD, 20 Wistar rats 
given the diet (4:1 lipid:non-lipid ratio) were compared to 20 fed 
a standard diet (39). It was found that rats on KD spent less time 
immobile than control rats thus providing some evidence for 
potential antidepressant effects of the diet. The diet duration was 
7 days, and levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate were measured.
Brain morphology and behavior of CD-1 mice exposed 
to KD (4:1 lipid:non-lipid ratio) for 30 days in utero and fed a 
standard diet in postnatal life were examined (40). Adult mice 
that were fed the diet in utero showed reduced susceptibility to 
anxiety and depression and exhibited elevated physical activity 
when compared with control mice fed a standard diet in utero. 
Morphological differences included cerebellar volumetric 
enlargement by 4.8%, a hypothalamic reduction by 1.39%, and 
a corpus callosum reduction by 4.77%, as computed relative to 
total brain volume.
While animal models pave the way for future research in 
humans, the conclusions that may be made are limited. The 
mechanism by which KD acts in animal models of depression 
is unknown; however, in children with epilepsy, KD resulted 
in significant alterations in levels of serotonin and dopamine 
neurotransmitters (58), both of which are implicated in anxiety 
and depression. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies 
examining the effects of KD in depressed humans.
Bipolar Disorder
A diagnosis of bipolar disorder type I requires an episode of 
mania, which consists of “a distinct period of abnormally and 
persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood, lasting at least 
1 week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary)” (59). 
 
A diagnosis of bipolar disorder type II requires at least one episode 
of hypomania. In a study of nutrition and exercise behavior, when 
compared to patients with schizophrenia or healthy controls, it

was found that patients with bipolar disorder were more likely to 
report risk factors for poor nutrition including difficulty obtain-
ing or cooking food (60). Treatments for bipolar disorder typically 
include an antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer, and many patients 
are treated with adjunct anticonvulsants.
In a case study of two women with bipolar disorder type 
II, the patients maintained ketosis for an extended period of 2 
and 3 years, respectively. The women reported subjective mood 
stabilization, which exceeded that of medication as well as an 
overall improvement in their condition that they related to ketosis 
(measured in the urine). Both women tolerated the diet well with 
few or no side effects reported (46). The ratio of KD was not 
mentioned in the first case, but in the second it was estimated to 
be around 70% fat, 22% protein, and 8% carbohydrates.
In a separate case study, a woman with treatment-resistant 
bipolar disorder was placed on KD (4:1 lipid:non-lipid ratio) and 
showed no clinical improvement (47). It should be noted that no 
urinary ketones were detected, the type of bipolar disorder was 
not listed (type I or type II), and treatment duration limited to 
1 month.
These studies illustrate that careful attention should be paid 
to the intricacies of the diet (such as measuring ketones and 
calculating macronutrient ratios) to fully examine its efficacy 
in bipolar disorder, as well as the need for larger well-designed 
placebo-controlled studies in this area. The mechanism by 
which KD may be effective in bipolar disorder is based on the 
hypothesis that acidosis achieved through ketosis reduces intra-
cellular sodium and calcium, both of which are elevated in the 
disorder (47). Mood stabilizers reduce intracellular sodium in 
an activity-dependent manner within the context of KD; this is 
hypothesized as being achieved through the acidification of the 
blood (46).
Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is associated with high levels of morbidity. The 
precise pathophysiology of the disorder is unknown, and current 
pharmacological treatment options are limited (61). Animal 
models of schizophrenia fit into four induction methods includ-
ing developmental, drug-induced, lesional, or genetic manipula-
tion (62). In a recent drug-induced (MK-801, dizocilpine) animal 
model of schizophrenia in C57BL/6 mice, it was demonstrated 
that 3 weeks of KD (77.6% fat, 9.5% protein, and 4.7% crude fiber, 
AD fiber 4.7%) normalized pathological behaviors (41). These 
included psychomotor hyperactivity, stereotyped behavior, social 
withdrawal, and working memory deficits, which reflect the posi-
tive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of the disorder. Weight 
loss was an observed side effect. Elevated levels of the ketone 
beta-hydroxybutyrate and decreased glucose levels indicated that 
metabolic adaptation had occurred.
In a 1965 study, the effect of KD was tested in 10 female 
patients with schizophrenia. All participants were reported to 
have a poor prognosis and were not treatment responsive at the 
time. Concurrent therapies remained throughout the duration 
of the diet including pharmacotherapy and electroconvulsive 
therapy. The Beckomberga Rating Scale was administered to 
patients three times during the diet period (2 days, 2 weeks, and 
1 week after discontinuation), there was a statistically significant 
decrease in symptomatology after 2 weeks of established KD 
(48). This was, however, a small, poorly controlled study, and in 
addition, the lipid:non-lipid ratios were not detailed, and it was 
not stated whether ketone levels were measured throughout the 
study. A further consideration is that the study was conducted 
in 1965 before the advent of atypical antipsychotics and their 
metabolic side effects.
In a case study of a 70-year-old overweight woman with a diag-
nosis of schizophrenia, KD was initiated by her treating physician 
(49). The patient remained on KD for 12 months and reportedly 
had no recurrences of auditory or visual hallucinations, and 
the patient lost weight. The patient reported eating mainly lean 
proteins and low-carbohydrate vegetables (the lipid:non-lipid 
ratio was not listed), ketosis was not confirmed and perhaps not 
established due to the lack of dietary fats listed; therefore, this case 
report is of indeterminate value.
Some studies suggest that abnormal glucose and energy 
metabolism may underlie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, 
which may provide some potential pointers into the hypothesized 
mode of action of KD in the disorder (63, 64). Others have noted 
that abnormal glucose metabolism may occur secondary to antip-
sychotic medications alongside significant treatment side effects 
such as weight gain, hyperglycemia, and diabetes (65). The high 
metabolic risk associated with schizophrenia is due to genetic and 
environmental factors (66).
Autism Spectrum Disorder
Features of patients with ASD include compromised social inter-
action and communication (67). It is estimated that between 5 
and 40% of patients with autism will develop epilepsy (68), and 
while most patients will respond to pharmacotherapy, in one 
study, 34% of 170 patients had medically refractory epilepsy (69). 
The precise pathogenesis of ASD remains unknown, but genetic 
and environmental factors have been known to contribute to its 
onset. One such factor is exposure to valproic acid (VPA) in utero, 
which is associated with a 12% incidence of ASD in children (70) 
and is used as an animal model of induction of ASD (42).
Using the animal model of autism induced by prenatal expo-
sure to VPA in mice, the effects of KD were examined. Pregnant 
Swiss mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of 600 mg/
kg of VPA (n = 26) or saline (n = 18) on gestational day 11. At day 
21, 16 VPA treated and 16 control mice were used. Half of each 
group was fed KD (lard 690 g/kg, sunflower oil 5 g/kg, protein 
250 g/kg, fiber 10 g/kg, ash 5 g/kg), while the other received a 
standard diet. Ketone levels were not measured. After 70 days 
on KD, a statistically significant result was found in mice with 
VPA in behaviors such as social deficits and stereotypies that are 
common behaviors in those with ASD (42). It is also believed that 
mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role in the onset of ASD 
(35). Ahn et al. (43) aimed to determine if KD could reverse the 
social deficits and mitochondrial dysfunction seen in a prenatal 
VPA animal model of autism using Wistar rats. On postnatal day 
21, rats were placed on either KD (6:1 lipid:non-lipid ratio) or 
standard diet for 10–14 days. Beta-hydroxybutyrate was meas-
ured. KD had a significant effect and was able to modify complex 
social behaviors in VPA and control rats and mitochondrial 
respiration (43).

Another animal model of autism using the inbred BTBR 
mouse strain that exhibits three core features of autism, includ-
ing reduced sociability, communication, and increased repetitive 
behavior, was studied (71). In another study, 33 genes were 
differentially expressed in the temporal cortex and 48 in the 
hippocampus suggesting deficits in the stress response and in 
neuronal signaling and communication in BTBR mice. After 
14 days on KD (6.3:1 lipid:non-lipid ratio), both brain regions 
showed improvements on autistic deficits associated with myelin 
formation and white matter development (44). One study has 
found that in BTBR mice, KD reduces total gut microbial and 
compositional remodeling of the mouse microbiome providing a 
potential explanation as to its efficacy in this model (72).
In an animal model with behavioral characteristics of ASD 
and comorbid epilepsy in male and female EL mice, the effect of 
KD was assessed (45). Testing occurred at 8–9 weeks postpartum 
following 3–4 weeks of dietary treatment. Animals were fed either 
a standard diet or one of two KDs (3.0:1 or 6.6:1 lipid:non-lipid 
ratio). KD raised ketones in all groups, but the higher fat ratio 
deepened ketosis. Both KDs significantly increased sociabil-
ity, time spent in the chamber with another mouse, in females 
and males. Social novelty, preference for a newly introduced 
mouse was higher in females fed the higher KD ratio. The test of 
repetitive behavior (self-grooming) was significantly decreased 
in males but was non-significant in females. This study provides 
some intriguing results regarding the effects of sex and KD in a 
mouse model of ASD and idiopathic epilepsy.
The role of KD in ASD has been examined in a pilot study 
of 30 children (50). The diet (30% of energy as MCT oil, 30% 
fresh cream, 11% as saturated fat, 19% carbohydrates, and 10% as 
protein) was administered for 6 months with intervals of 4 weeks 
with 2 diet-free weeks. Of the total sample, 40% did not comply 
or did not tolerate the diet. Urinary ketones were measured. In the 
remaining sample, two children showed significant improvements 
on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, while the rest showed 
mild-to-moderate improvements. As observed in patients with 
epilepsy, after the termination of KD the benefits persisted, which 
raise intriguing questions regarding the effects of plasticity.
In a case study of a child with autism and epilepsy, following 
standard treatment non-response, the individual was placed 
on KD (1.5:1 lipid:non-lipid ratio) with adjunct anticonvulsant 
therapy (51). The patient was in ketosis. After initiation of the 
diet several benefits ensued including the resolution of morbid 
obesity and the improvement of cognitive and behavioral features 
of the disorder. After several years on the diet, the patient’s score 
on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale decreased from 49 to 17, 
a change from a rating of severe autism to non-autistic, and IQ 
increased by 70 points. Fourteen months following the initiation 
of the diet the patient was also seizure free.
The suggested mechanisms of action of KD in ASD include 
that it may reduce pain sensitivity through the reduction 
of glucose and may have anti-inflammatory properties as it 
reduces swelling and plasma extravasation (42). In a systematic 
review of KD in ASD it was concluded that the limited number 
of reports of improvements after treatment with the diet is not 
sufficient to attest to the practicability of KD as a treatment for 
the disorder (73).
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is characterized by a 
lack of behavioral inhibition and by neuropsychological deficits 
in four areas, including working memory, self-regulation of 
affect–motivation–arousal, internalization of speech, and behav-
ioral analysis and synthesis (74). ADHD is the most commonly 
occurring mental disorder in children and adolescents with 
epilepsy occurring in 16 (29.1%) of 78 patients (75). Children 
with ADHD have a high frequency of epileptiform discharges as 
observed by EEG (76). In a prospective study of children with 
epilepsy (n = 34) on KD it was found that after 1 year on the diet 
there was a statistically significant improvement of attention and 
social functioning (77).
There is little evidence examining ADHD and KD, but a 
6-month prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-
controlled, crossover dietary trial compared the effects of 
KD (10% moisture, 28% protein, 15% fat, 6% ash, 2% crude 
fiber, and MCT oil) or a standard diet on behavior in 21 dogs 
with comorbid ADHD and idiopathic epilepsy (36). It was 
hypothesized that there were three specific behaviors related to 
ADHD in dogs including excitability, chasing, and trainability. 
ADHD in dogs is manifested as inattention and excitability/
impulsivity, which have been likened to the disorder in humans 
(78). When compared with the standard diet, KD resulted in 
a significant improvement in ADHD-related behaviors. Serum 
beta-hydroxybutyrate was measured. The mechanisms of behav-
ioral improvements during KD remain unknown. The authors 
postulated that alterations of energy metabolism in the brain 
may contribute to behavioral changes. Research into humans 
with ADHD and KD is lacking.
DiSCUSSiON
In neurology, KD is an established treatment option for 
treatment-resistant epilepsy with evidence from a range of 
studies including controlled trials. By contrast, KD research in 
humans with mental disorders, though extending over a 50-year 
period, has received little attention with few studies other than 
case reports, small sample size open studies, and no controlled 
trials. Animal studies have been more systematic, investigating 
mechanisms as well as outcomes on putative disease analogs in 
rodents and canines, the latter including randomized controlled 
trials of KD.
With respect to mechanisms, the pathophysiology of the 
mental disorders covered in this review is not clearly understood, 
though impaired metabolism due to mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion has been identified as an important substrate (34). This is 
congruent with findings in neurological conditions, Stafstrom 
and Rho concluding that energy metabolism changes induced 
by KD in neurological conditions suggest a final common 
pathway implicating mitochondrial function (26). KD may also 
influence neuronal plasticity by modifying neural circuits and 
cellular properties to normalize function (26). Mitochondrial 
dysfunction may be relevant in some mental disorders including 
schizophrenia, ASD, and ADHD, whereas the improvements 
seen in anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder may be related 
to alterations of neurotransmitters.

One other possible mediator of the beneficial effects of KD in 
mental disorders is the effect on sleep. In a study of 18 children 
with treatment-resistant epilepsy, after 3 months of KD sleep was 
reported to be enhanced with a pattern of significant reduction in 
total night sleep, preservation of slow-wave sleep, increased rapid 
eye movement (REM) sleep, and decrease in sleep stage 2 (79). 
The mechanisms by which KD affects sleep is unclear (80), and 
more studies are necessary to confirm reports that certain dietary 
patterns and foods improve sleep (81).
Sleep problems and mental disorders are codependent condi-
tions that exacerbate each other and lead to impaired quality 
of life and increased disability (82). Impairments of sleep are a 
widespread feature of mental disorders. Anxious patients have 
been found to have significantly less sleep period time, total 
sleep time, percentage stage REM and percent stage 4 sleep, 
shorter latency to stage REM, and greater percent stage 1 sleep 
than healthy controls (83). REM sleep abnormalities including 
shortening of REM latency, lengthening of the duration of the 
first REM period, and heightening of REM density are found 
in patients with depression (84). In patients with inter-episode 
bipolar disorder, shorter sleep onset latency and increased REM 
density has been observed (85). A decrease of REM sleep latency 
in schizophrenia has been described (86). Individuals with ASD 
have prolonged sleep latency, more frequent nocturnal awaken-
ings, lower sleep efficiency, increased duration of NREM stage 1 
sleep, and decreased deeper stages of NREM sleep (87). In ADHD, 
disturbed sleep architecture has been described including shorter 
REM latencies, reduced REM sleep, and increased delta sleep 
percentage (88). It should also be noted that sleep deprivation can 
precipitate mania in bipolar disorder and seizures in epilepsy (89) 
and can be used as a treatment for depression (90). The specific 
effects of KD on these mental disorder-related sleep symptoms 
has not been studied in detail, but interactions are likely and may 
be possible mediators of a therapeutic effect.
In epilepsy, KD acts differently to antiepileptic drugs (AED) 
in seizure prevention. While AED act directly on ion channels 
and synaptic processes, KD acts through intermediary metabolic 
pathways (91). Chang et al. showed that an MCT (palm oil and 
coconut oil) diet, a variation of KD, reduces seizures in children 
via inhibition on AMPA receptors (12, 92, 93). The questions 
posed by the literature indicate that the mechanism of action 
is still unknown, and there may be many potential pathways 
involved. The mechanism of action appears different from AED 
and therefore probably psychiatric drugs also, which opens 
potential avenues for treatment in a manner that may supplement 
conventional pharmacological treatment approaches. The exact 
mechanism of action of KD is unclear, and for detailed discussion, 
see Rogawski et al. (91). Thus, present knowledge indicates that 
KD exerts its effects on seizure control by mechanisms different 
from conventional AED and therefore, in psychiatry, this may 
also be the case although as yet unproven.
There are a number of reasons why the effectiveness of KD 
in mental disorders remains unproven. In addition to the low 
number of human studies, the quality of the studies has some 
significant limitations. Sample sizes are small, there is no control 
for placebo effects, and the establishment of ketosis is generally 
lacking with no confirmatory measurement of ketones in three 
human studies. There are also significant limitations associated 
with the diet itself including the detailed regimen, unpalatable 
food choices, side effects, and duration of diet required. There are 
also no enforced standards as to what constitutes KD in humans 
with variable lipid:non-lipid ratios reported. KD monotherapy is 
used in animal models of mental disorders but remains unexam-
ined in human studies. Ten adult patients with epilepsy followed 
KD monotherapy, and it was concluded that it may be feasible, 
well tolerated, and an effective long-term alternative (94).
To comply with KD, patients who may be acutely unwell are 
required to measure food portions to ensure that the macronutri-
ent targets associated with the diet are met, and they may find 
it difficult to adhere to such a demanding diet (47). This is par-
ticularly so for patients with mental disorders where symptoms 
such as impulsivity in mania, apathy, and reduced appetite in 
depression, food cravings, and binge eating associated with antip-
sychotic medications may variously interfere with compliance 
with KD (95). A mitigating factor to the outcomes in children 
with epilepsy may be that the diet is typically administered in a 
hospital setting initially and subsequently, by caregivers.
El-Mallakh and Paskitti have outlined the adverse conse-
quences of KD including constipation, menstrual irregularities, 
elevated serum cholesterol and triglycerides, hypoproteinemia, 
hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and gall stones (96). 
Kidney stones have been noted to occur in 1 of 20 children on the 
diet (97). In a period of almost 2 years, prospective monitoring of 
52 children with pediatric epilepsy was conducted. Ten percent 
of children experienced serious adverse events associated with 
the diet 1 month after initiation (98). This included presacral and 
periorbital edema, developmental impairment, and unwanted 
weight loss in an infant, renal tubular acidosis, viral gastroen-
teritis, abnormal liver function, and thrombocytopenia. It should 
be noted that all patients were being treated with concomitant 
VPA. It was reported in a retrospective study of 158 children 
with intractable epilepsy that, in 80% emesis, food refusal and 
hypoglycemia occurred (99).
By definition, KD is confirmed by the production of ketones 
measured in the blood or urine. In the reviewed literature cover-
ing KD in mental disorders, four studies did not report ketone 
levels, which severely limit comparability across studies and the 
ability to invoke any consistent mechanism. One study compared 
whether measuring serum beta-hydroxybutyrate or urinary 
ketones was superior to monitor KD (100). In humans, it was 
found that beta-hydroxybutyrate correlated more strongly with 
a reduction in seizures than urinary ketones; therefore, future 
studies should measure ketones in the blood. Another issue is 
that the lipid:non-lipid ratios used were different (see Tables 1 
and 2). In a study that compared the efficacy and tolerability of 
the 3:1 versus the 4:1 lipid:non-lipid ratios, the latter was shown 
to have a higher seizure-free outcome (2).
One issue when interpreting the results is the levels of evi-
dence in the evidence-based hierarchy. Animal models of mental 
disorders are considered valuable preclinical tools to investigate 
the neurobiological basis of a disorder (62). While this may be 
true, they are nonetheless subject to a number of limitations. One 
such limitation is the issue of validity, and their use is based on the 
assumption that humans and animals share basic neurobiological

mechanisms associated with the complex behaviors that mimic 
mental disorders in animals (101).
Another difficulty posed to practitioners is that there are cur-
rently no international protocols guiding the administration of 
the diet; this is something that may be established from future 
research into KD. There was only one case study that detailed 
what the participant, diagnosed with schizophrenia, ate, and it 
was not established whether this individual was in ketosis. In the 
various studies in humans, outcomes were assessed following 
dietary durations that varied from 7 days to 2 years.
Further research into the neural correlates of KD is needed to 
help explain the mechanisms by which it acts. Some suggestions 
regarding methodologies, provided by Fusar-Poli are elaborated 
below. Changes in glucose metabolism seen in KD could be 
examined using positron emission tomography fluorodeoxy-
glucose. To observe the neural correlates of KD, a combination 
of electrophysiological measures including EEG and magne-
toencephalogram and fMRI/PET to combine the high temporal 
resolution of the former with the high spatial resolution of the 
latter may be used (102).
In the neurological literature, a single study, in Alzheimer’s 
disease, used a synthesized ketogenic compound AC-1202 rather 
than a KD. AC-1202 is an MCT composed of glycerine and 
caprylic acid (23). It is not yet clear what role ketogenic pharma-
cotherapy options might play alongside or as a substitute for KD.
While these animal studies are placing research into KD on a 
firm footing and identifying some promising leads, on balance 
the evidence in humans is insufficient to form an opinion as to the 
efficacy or lack thereof of this intervention in the mental disorders 
reported. Further basic research to clarify the specifics of dietary 
manipulation or supplementation required to produce optimum 
ketosis in specific models is an obvious intermediate step toward 
studying the effectiveness of the diet in human mental disorders 
using conventional phases of research including open-label stud-
ies and randomized controlled trials.
