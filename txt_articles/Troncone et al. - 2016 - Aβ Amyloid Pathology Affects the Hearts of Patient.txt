Abstract
Background—Individually, heart failure (HF) and Alzheimer Disease (AD) are severe threats to 
population health, and their potential coexistence is an alarming prospect. In addition to sharing 
analogous epidemiological and genetic profiles, biochemical characteristics, and common triggers, 
we recently recognized common molecular and pathological features between the 2 conditions. 
Whereas cognitive impairment has been linked to HF through perfusion defects, angiopathy, and 
inflammation, whether patients with AD present with myocardial dysfunction, and if the 2 
conditions bear a common pathogenesis as neglected siblings is unknown.
Objectives—Here we investigated if amyloid beta (Aβ) protein aggregates are present in the 
hearts of patients with a primary diagnosis of AD, affecting myocardial function.
Methods—We examined myocardial function in a retrospective cross-sectional study from a 
cohort of AD patients and age-matched controls. Imaging and proteomics approaches were used to 
identify and quantify Aβ deposits in AD heart and brain specimens compared to controls. Cell 
shortening and calcium transients were measured on isolated adult cardiomyocytes.

 Results—Echocardiographic measurements of myocardial function suggest that patients with 
AD present with an anticipated diastolic dysfunction. As in the brain, Aβ40 and Aβ42 are present 
in the heart, and their expression is increased in AD.
Conclusions—Here we provide the first report of the presence of compromised myocardial 
function and intramyocardial deposits of Aβ in AD patients. Our findings depict a novel biological 
framework in which AD may be viewed either as a systemic disease or as a metastatic disorder 
leading to heart, and possibly multiorgan failure. AD and HF are both debilitating and life-
threatening conditions, affecting enormous patient populations. Our findings underline a 
previously dismissed problem of a magnitude that will require new diagnostic approaches and 
treatments for brain and heart disease, and their combination.
Keywords
Amyloidosis; Cardiomyopathy; Dementia; Heart Failure; Protein Aggregates
Heart failure (HF) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are age-dependent diseases that are 
growing worldwide. HF claims 36% of cardiovascular deaths, with an aging prevalence 
growth of 4% to 9% from 60 to 80 years of age, and AD is the fifth most common cause of 
death in patients 65 years of age and older (1). Epidemiological evidence indicates that HF 
shares risk factors with dementing processes, and clinical studies link cardiovascular 
diseases and dementia through analogous genetic and biochemical profiles, and common 
triggers (2–8). Additionally, a number of more recent discoveries suggest a closer common 
pathogenesis between the 2 conditions. These include the discovery that protein aggregates 
deposit in the myocardium of patients affected by idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy 
(iDCM) (9), and that such deposits are biochemically akin to those found in AD (10). 
Moreover, genetic variants in the same gene associated with early-onset AD (presenilin = 
PSEN) were reported in familial (11) and sporadic cases (9) of iDCM. Thus, whether these 
conditions are causally linked or part of a multiorgan syndrome, their potential coexistence 
raises an alarming prospect with people living longer.
Even though “cardiogenic dementia” was first postulated nearly 4 decades ago (12) and 
numerous studies have identified HF as a risk factor for AD (13,14), it is unknown whether 
AD affects myocardial function and if the 2 maladies share a common pathogenesis. The 
prevailing belief is that major determinants of the heart-to-head connection are compromised 
blood flow to the brain, amyloid, or atherosclerotic angiopathy (15–17). The cognitive 
decline from low brain perfusion has been shown early in pre-symptomatic AD, whereas 
increasing blood flow to the brain improves AD symptoms (15). Whether the opposite is 
true, namely compromised heart function in patients affected by AD, in the absence of other 
underlying cardiovascular disease, is unknown.
A pathological hallmark of AD is the accumulation of amyloid deposits in the form of 
extracellular plaques (18) (composed of the amyloid precursor protein [APP] proteolytic 
fragments [Aβ]) (19,20) in the brain parenchyma, causing neuritis and neuronal cell death 
(21). Abnormal cleavage of APP (22) leads to an amyloidogenic pathway, generating 
pathological Aβ fragments.

 Here, we investigated whether Aβ amyloid accumulates in the hearts of AD patients, 
affecting organ function. We found that: in vivo myocardial and in vitro cardiomyocyte 
function are compromised in AD patients; Aβ40 and Aβ42 are both present in the 
myocardium, and are increased in the hearts of AD patients. These findings, in combination 
with our previous report of the toxic effect of Aβ pre-amyloid oligomers (PAOs) on 
cardiomyocytes (9), suggest Aβ amyloid as a novel pathogenesis for myocardial 
dysfunction.
Methods
Detailed methods are available in the Online Appendix.
Human subjects
A cohort of AD cases and controls was selected from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical 
Center clinical database to determine in vivo myocardial function in AD. Fresh heart and 
brain specimens from a separate cohort of patients with clinical diagnoses of AD and 
controls were used for in vitro pathological and functional studies.
Tissue samples
Myocardial tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde or 2% glutaraldehyde for 
imaging. Frozen myocardial and brain samples were used for imaging and molecular tests. 
Fresh tissue was used to isolate adult left ventricular (LV) cardiomyocytes (23,24).
Imaging
Brain sections were stained for amyloid fibers with Thioflavin S or silver stain, and for PAO 
by immunohistochemistry using structural antibodies (A11). Transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) was used to visualize the fibers in the myocardium. Immunogold TEM 
with structural antibodies against Aβ42-PAO (VIA antibodies, recognizing the last 3 amino 
acids Val40-Ile41-Ala42 of Aβ42) (25) were used to identify Aβ in the myocardial deposits.
Molecular tests
Immunoblotting and enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to identify 
and quantify Aβ peptides in heart and brain tissue.
Cardiomyocyte function
Adult LV cardiomyocytes were isolated by enzymatic digestion (24,26). Contractility and 
calcium (Ca2+) transients were measured using a video edge-detection and dual-excitation 
system (Ion-Optix, Westwood, Massachusetts) (27).
Results
Diastolic function is reduced in AD
Reduced blood flow to the brain from low cardiac output has been linked to cognitive 
impairment in HF. Here we analyzed if, conversely, myocardial function is abnormal in AD. 
We studied a cohort of AD patients with the clinical diagnosis or diagnostic work-up of AD,

 in the absence of other underlying conditions affecting myocardial function (including 
history of coronary artery disease [CAD], previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, 
primary or secondary amyloidosis, dilated/hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, endocarditis, 
chemotherapy, or radiotherapy). Cases and controls were matched by age/sex/ethnicity with 
a 1:2 ratio (Table 1A, Online Table 1, and Online Figure 1).
Clinical assessment of myocardial function (Online Table 2) did not show any significant 
difference between AD cases and controls. Because AD is an age-related disease, we then 
performed a linear regression analysis and adjusted the associations between AD status and 
cardiac function for age. We found that age predicts a reduction in diastolic function by 
mitral valve E/A ratio (MVE/A) (Online Table 3A), as previously shown (28). We then 
performed exploratory analyses of means and standard errors of the mean by age category 
and AD status. Cases and controls were divided into 3 age groups (<65, 65 to 80, and >80 
years of age). The Student t-test analysis, as well as the estimates obtained by ordinary least 
squares of our linear regression model (Online Table 3B), showed no significant differences 
between AD and MVE/A ratio. Notably, diastolic function did not differ in the third tertiles 
of age in AD versus controls (MVE/A ratio 0.82 ± 0.08 vs. 0.86 ± 0.08). However, a 
correlation between AD and anticipated decline of myocardial function was present in the 
first age tertile (1.20 ± 0.18 vs. 1.34 ± 0.12) (Figure 1A). This appeared to be better 
explained by defects in myocardial compliance because such a pattern was not shown for the 
atrial component (A) of the MVE/A (Figure 1B). Furthermore, we also used a linear 
regression F-test (p < 0.05), which showed that the pattern we observed was consistent with 
poorer diastolic function at earlier ages among the AD participants, conforming with the 
pathogenesis of AD as a disease of anticipated aging.
AD status was also associated with increased LV wall thickness, as shown in other 
infiltrative diseases, including classical cardiac amyloidosis. However, the difference was 
significant only in elderly subjects (left ventricle septal wall thickness [LVSWT] 1.12 ± 0.05 
vs. 1.01 ± 0.04; p < 0.05 left ventricle infero-laretal wall thickness (LVILT) 1.07 ± 0.05 vs. 
1.00 ± 0.03; p < 0.05), but not in the first age tertile, and therefore not a possible cause of the 
anticipated diastolic defect found in AD subjects younger than 65 years of age (Figures 1C 
and 1D). Similarly, aortic valve peak velocity was increased only in older AD subjects (2.44 
± 0.41 vs. 1.51 ± 0.14; p < 0.05), suggesting it as a putative cause of wall thickening at later 
time points, but, again, unlikely to be a determinant of early diastolic impairment. The 
analysis of individual cases showed that 4 AD patients had high values of peak aortic 
velocity, indicating a stochastic occurrence of associated reduced aortic valve compliance in 
a few older cases.
Clinical assessment of the patient population underlined the role of beta-blockade in 
protection from cognitive dysfunction
Associated diseases were similarly distributed, with an equivalent number of cases with the 
diagnosis of diabetes, arrhythmia (particularly atrial fibrillation, which often occurs in the 
aging population), and neoplasms (Online Table 4). Interestingly, only 1 AD case was on 
beta-blocker therapy. Instead, about one-third of controls were on such treatment. Beta-
blocker therapy has been associated with reduced risk of AD (29). Although beta-blockade

 may improve diastolic function, skewing our results, it does so when it achieves a significant 
reduction in heart rate, which was unchanged in our control versus AD cases. However we 
performed ANOVA to account for this variable, and separated the controls in 2 groups on the 
basis of the presence or absence of beta-blocker therapy. We found that there was no 
difference in diastolic function, as measured by MVE/A, between the 2 therapeutic regimen 
groups (Online Table 5).
AD tissue samples
The definitive diagnosis of AD versus other forms of dementia can only be made at 
pathological and histological examination. Therefore we collected samples of heart and, 
when possible, brain tissue from 4 cases with a medical history of AD from which the 
patients were maintained in respiratory support (Table 1B). This stringent criterion is 
required to avoid postmortem false positive depositions of protein aggregates, but made the 
procurement of such samples extremely rare. We were therefore limited to the following few, 
but highly selected and significant cases: 1) a 58-year-old Caucasian woman with a history 
of cognitive impairment for 10 years and diagnosis of AD for 7 years; 2) a 70-year-old 
Caucasian woman with a clinical diagnosis of dementia. In this case, the clinical diagnosis 
of AD was confirmed at pathology by CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD) 
plaque score C and Braak tangle score IV (30,31); 3) an 84-year-old Caucasian woman with 
clinical diagnosis of AD for 3 years. The heart from this case was removed 7 h and 30 min 
postmortem (labeled as tissue donor); 4) 91-year-old Caucasian man with clinical diagnosis 
of AD.
Structural staining identified Aβ in the myocardium
Neuritic plaques are distinctive histological lesions required for the diagnosis of AD. We 
therefore imaged brain and heart tissue from the 4 pathological specimens of AD compared 
to controls.
First, we verified the presence of Aβ for the diagnosis of AD in the brain specimens by 
immunostaining with structural A11 antibodies (32,33) and staining with Thioflavin S (34), 
which revealed the presence of pre-amyloid and amyloid deposits, respectively (Figures 2A 
and 2B). The brain of the 70-year-old woman showed plaques by Hirano silver staining 
(Figures 2E and 2F), and the typical global atrophy at gross pathology (Figure 2G).
In the heart, small intracellular or extracellular amyloid deposits cannot be clearly visualized 
by traditional staining due to the high background generated by the birefringent sarcomeres. 
Therefore, we imaged the hearts by TEM and identified fibrillar deposits in AD myocardial 
specimens (Figure 3, Online Figure 2). However, the fibrillar-rich content of interstitial 
tissue in the myocardium also hinders the recognition of pre-amyloid and amyloid deposits. 
Therefore, to identify the pathological inclusions within the normal extracellular fibrillar 
matrix, we used immunogold TEM on the specimens from the oldest and the youngest cases. 
We used anti-Aβ42 antibodies and/or Aβ42-PAO structural VIA antibodies. Positive VIA 
immunogold staining was detected within the muscle fibers and the interstitial tissue (Figure 
4). These data indicate that inclusions of pathological Aβ are present in the myocardium of 
AD patients. In contrast, the signal for nonoligomerized Aβ42 was below the threshold of the

 signal noise; therefore, we cannot infer an evaluation of the presence of nonoligomerized 
form of the peptide using this method.
Molecular tests identified both Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the myocardium
The presence of both Aβ peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) was confirmed and quantified by 
immunoblotting and ELISA. Given the difference of only 2 amino acids between Aβ40 and 
Aβ42, we first determined the antibody specificity by dot blot. We confirmed that each 
antibody uniquely recognizes the corresponding peptide (Online Figure 3). By 
immunoblotting, we then found that both Aβ peptides (MW ≅5 to 10 kDa) are present in the 
heart and brain of AD patients (Figure 5A and Online Figure 4).
ELISA confirmed that Aβ40 and Aβ42 are expressed in the heart, although at lower levels 
than the brain. In both organs, Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were increased in the tissue from AD 
patients compared with controls (Figure 5B). These data further indicate that, similar to the 
brain, Aβ is present in the myocardium and is increased in AD.
Cardiomyocytes display relaxation defects
To test whether the relaxation defect identified clinically is solely due to interstitial deposits 
and extracellular matrix stiffness, or if cardiomyocyte function is also abnormal in AD, we 
measured contractility and Ca2+ transients in LV cardiomyocytes isolated from the 58-year-
old AD heart, compared to cardiomyocytes isolated from 68- and 56-year-old female control 
hearts (Online Figure 5). AD cardiomyocytes displayed slower velocities of relaxation (R50 
[time to 50% relaxation]: 0.272 vs. 0.238) and prolonged Ca2+ transients (time-to-peak 
[TTP]: 0.544 vs. 0.151; R90: 0.328 vs. 0.084) compared with controls, indicating a defect in 
Ca2+ homeostasis (23,26,27,35). No statistical calculations were performed because we only 
measured 3 cardiomyocytes from 1 AD case. Although we cannot infer a role for circulating 
Aβ versus a primary defect in AD cardiomyocytes, it is possible that cardiomyocytes and 
extracellular infiltrates may combine to determine the overall functional defect in AD hearts.
Discussion
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and HF have been recently added to the growing list of age-
related proteinopathies (9,36), of which AD is one of the founders. DCM shares several risk 
factors with dementing disorders, including AD, and clinical evidence links DCM and AD 
through analogous epidemiological, biochemical, and genetic profiles (2,4). Here, we 
provide novel evidence that the heart and brain can be affected within the same clinical 
picture. We found that diastolic dysfunction is an early defect in patients affected by AD, 
and that intramyocardial deposits of Aβ are present in the myocardium of these patients. 
Because Aβ-PAOs affect cell function in the heart as in the brain (9,37), it is possible that 
they may contribute to the observed myocardial dysfunction.
Head-to-heart connection in AD: a multifaceted mechanism
HF has been found to be a risk factor for both vascular dementia and AD (13,38), and 
cognitive impairment has been found in patients with HF and correlates with its severity 
(13,14). This relationship has been attributed to reduced blood flow to the brain and diffuse

 amyloid angiopathy (13,15,39,40). The latter is also regarded as the reverse link between 
myocardial functional decline in AD and aging (38,41). Furthermore circulating Aβ40 was 
shown to worsen vascular atherosclerosis, and to predict disease progression and 
cardiovascular mortality in patients with established CAD (42,43). Here, we tested whether 
other mechanisms link cardiac dysfunction to the brain disorder in the absence of any known 
causes of compromised cardiovascular function. This possibility was suggested by our 
recent discoveries of: 1) protein aggregates in iDCM (9); 2) common genetic mutations in 
AD and iDCM (9); and 3) common components of the AD and iDCM aggregates (10). Thus, 
low perfusion and amyloid angiopathy may not be the sole contributors to the heart-to-brain 
connection, and the possibility that patients with AD would present with myocardial 
dysfunction was a reasonable hypothesis. Although the small number of cases for a clinical 
assessment limits the statistical significance of our findings, our data suggest that AD 
patients may also present with compromised diastolic cardiac function, raising the awareness 
of a growing clinical hazard.
Anticipated diastolic dysfunction occurs in patients with clinical diagnosis of AD
Reduced diastolic function is a normal event in myocardial aging. Although AD has a close 
correlation with age, and diastolic function in AD progressively worsen with age, we found 
that AD patients displayed worse values at younger ages compared with controls, 
asymptotically approaching the values of old-age controls, and supporting the definition of 
the AD phenotype as anticipated aging. Larger datasets are, however, necessary to 
unequivocally establish a direct link between AD and myocardial dysfunction. Although the 
pathogenesis of diastolic dysfunction is complex, it is a common feature associated with 
myocardial hypertrophy. In our AD cohort, a significant thickening of the left ventricular 
walls was observed only in the oldest individuals, and therefore was unlikely to be the cause 
of the observed diastolic dysfunction in the younger cases. This would most likely be due to 
the occurrence of aortic stenosis in elderly AD cases. Thus, neither hypertrophy nor aortic 
valve stenosis can be the underlying cause of the diastolic dysfunction observed in the 
younger AD cohort. Other mechanisms linked to the pathogenesis of AD may account for 
the observed changes, including the accumulation of Aβ in the myocardium.
Aβ inclusions are present in myocardial tissue in AD
Deterioration of cognitive functions characterizes a number of dementing processes, 
including “senile dementia.” AD instead defines a distinct condition of “presenile” dementia 
for which the definitive diagnosis can only be made at pathology. In our clinical cohort, in 1 
case who was deceased, the diagnosis was also confirmed by gross pathology and 
histological analysis. Three cases presented with positive family history for AD. Although 
these data strengthen the confidence in the diagnosis of our cohort of AD patients, we 
further tested whether, in fact, AD pathology extends outside the brain by determining the 
presence of Aβ in cardiac muscle tissue samples harvested from a separate cohort of 
deceased AD patients.
Aβ fragments generated from abnormal cleavage of APP (Online Figure 6) (22) are among 
the main constituents of senile plaque and cerebrovascular deposits in AD. Aβ aggregates 
typically deposit not only in the brain, but also in the submeningeal vasculature in patients

 affected by AD, causing damage to the vascular wall (44). Such deposits have been 
attributed to either basolateral-to-apical transport of soluble Aβ or disruption of the blood-
brain barrier and Aβ leakage into the bloodstream, as shown in human and mouse models of 
AD (45,46). Flowing in the bloodstream, Aβ may deposit in distal organs and vessels, 
causing other forms of non-neurological amyloid pathology, as has been reported in the 
skeletal muscle, skin, kidney, lung, and intestine of AD patients (47), but never in 
myocardial tissue.
Indeed, deposition of amyloid, secondary to the pathology of other organs, is a common 
mechanism causing cardiac amyloidosis (e.g., caused by accumulation of light chain or 
transthyretin) (48). Furthermore, organ damage due to circulating amyloid-prone proteins 
has also been described in diabetes, where amylin, secreted together with insulin, causes 
amyloid deposits not only in the pancreas, but also at distance, in the heart and brain, 
causing AD and DCM (49,50). Thus, the deposition of amyloid fibers in the heart from 
circulating Aβ peptides, leading to cardiac dysfunction in AD patients, is a likely event. 
However, a significant amount of Aβ was identified in the peripheral circulation and 
platelets, worsening CAD. Thus, it is possible that accumulation of Aβ in the heart 
compromises myocardial function in patients with AD, identifying a more profound 
pathogenic root for the brain-to-heart connection, in addition to the effect of Aβ on vascular 
atherosclerosis or to other mechanisms linked to amyloidosis, including neurohormonal 
activation and inflammation. This possibility is supported by our previous data indicating a 
similar mechanism of toxicity of PAOs on cardiomyocytes (9), as demonstrated in neurons 
(37). Additionally, amyloid proteins, including Aβ, have been shown to directly activate 
specific proinflammatory and necrotic responses (inflammasome and necrosome). Thus, Aβ 
may also affect myocardial function through the activation of the newly discovered 
functional amyloid signaling (51).
Myocardial dysfunction in AD: a possible metastatic or systemic process
Various pathogenic mechanisms can be invoked to explain our findings: either Aβ fragments 
may deposit in the heart as in other distal tissues, recreating the amyloid pathology as a 
metastatic disease; or a common genetic, biochemical, and molecular profile and common 
triggers affect both organs as a systemic disease; or both (Central Illustration). Although the 
genotype was not available to exclude the presence of known AD mutations, our cohort of 
AD cases was predominantly sporadic, suggesting the absence of Mendelian genetic 
mutations, but not excluding predisposing genetic variants or polymorphisms.
Limitations
We acknowledge the following limitations of this study.
1.
The number of samples available for the clinical, pathological, and 
molecular biology assessment is limited. However, obtaining heart 
specimens from patients under respiratory support is extremely difficult, 
and we were fortunate to be able to obtain such specimens. Furthermore, 
case reports are important to raise the awareness of a potential clinical 
problem. The results from epidemiological cohorts generally have wide

 confidence intervals. Therefore, we cannot infer temporality on the basis 
of the cross-sectional nature of our validation cohort. However, the results 
of our analysis support the possibility of differences in cardiac outcomes 
by AD status. We also acknowledge the measurements of cardiomyocyte 
function were obtained only from 3 myocytes of the youngest case. 
Isolating adult human cardiomyocytes is challenging, and even more so 
from hearts with amyloid inclusions, limiting the technical success of the 
procedure.
2.
The diagnosis of AD is anatomopathological. It is obtained from the 
following brain regions: the middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 
[BA]8/9); superior temporal gyrus (BA22/21); inferior parietal lobule 
(BA39/40); occipital cortex, including 1 visual (BA17/18); 1 motor/
sensory cortex (BA4/1/2/3); and the hippocampus/entorhinal cortex. In our 
study, the brain samples were obtained from the cortex. However, given 
the mentioned difficulties in obtaining such highly-selected heart and brain 
samples, and because, at the late symptomatic stage, Aβ pathology spreads 
outside the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, the cortical regions we 
studied may be representative for the pathological diagnosis of AD. 
Furthermore, the diagnosis of 71-year-old case of AD followed the Aging-
Alzheimer’s Association guidelines, and the heart of this case featured the 
same myocardial pathological changes as the other cases.
3.
A detailed clinical assessment of cardiac function for the cases from which 
the specimens were obtained was not always available. Instrumental 
evaluation (e.g., echocardiography for myocardial function) is not 
performed in patients found unsuitable for organ explant, such as those 
with AD, due to age. Other causes of cardiac dysfunction were excluded in 
the cases we collected. Larger studies are, however, mandatory to assess 
the presence and type of cardiomyopathy in patients with AD, as well as to 
determine the impact and mechanisms.
4.
We acknowledge that the E/E’ ratio is a more accurate index of diastolic 
function by Doppler echocardiography. However, the clinical data were 
obtained retrospectively, and this measurement is not part of the routine 
clinical diagnostic assessment. Future prospective research studies 
directed to assess diastolic function will be required. Those may include 
cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
Conclusions
Overall, our data underscore the importance of recognizing the pathological involvement of 
the heart in AD, in addition to the known involvement of other organs (18,24–26). The 
clinical burden of AD has notably increased over the last decade, due to the aging of the 
population and the development of more effective therapies, prolonging lives. The increase 
in prevalence and improved survival of AD patients would lead to an expansion of the 
already high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, including CAD and now HF. As the heart

 is exposed to the free circulatory flow of aggregate-prone peptides, and no barrier segregates 
the organ, the involvement of this “nonimmunoprivileged” organ may carry a worse 
prognosis, as is the case with cardiac AL amyloidosis (52). If AD and HF alone are severe 
health threats, their combination will represent a clinical challenge requiring an 
interdisciplinary approach to patient management and treatment.

 PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE
The relationship between AD and HF is mediated not only by abnormalities of tissue 
perfusion, neurohormonal activation, and inflammation, but also by factors that directly 
affect the functional properties of the myocardium.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK
Further studies are needed to define the dysfunctional cardiac phenotype observed in 
patients with AD, characterize proteomics and biomarkers common to the 
cardiomyopathies, and brain pathology that accompany aging, and explore the impact of 
therapeutic approaches to each disease on outcomes related to the other.

 Figure 1. Crude Means of Cardiac Ultrasound Parameters for Groups and Age Ranges Show 
Worse Myocardial Function in the AD Clinical Cohort Compared With Controls
Crude means of cardiac ultrasound parameters for age tertiles and groups corresponding to 
the linear regression. The top left panel shows how the value of the MVE/A ratio is lower in 
younger AD subjects and progressively overlaps with the controls at advanced ages. The 
mean value of the MVE/A ratio of AD patients in the first tertile appears intermediate 
between the value of the first and the second tertile of controls. An analogous pattern is 
shown for AD patients in the second tertile (A). (B) Notably, the atrial (A) component alone 
showed no differences in all groups, suggesting that the LV compliance is the main 
contributor to the diastolic dysfunction in AD patients. (C and D) show the increased LV 
septal and inferior wall thickness, respectively, in the older AD subjects. *p < 0.05. Black 
diamonds: controls; gray squares: AD cases. Aβ = amyloid beta; AD = Alzheimer’s disease; 
LV = left ventricle/ventricular; MVE/A = mitral valve E/A ratio.

 both in the heart and the brain. Of note, both Aβ40 and Aβ42 high molecular weight bands 
were also present in old cases without diagnosis of AD, and also in young patients, although 
at lower levels, as previously described in the brain. (B) Quantification of the levels of Aβ40 
and Aβ42 in AD and donor samples by ELISA, showing increased levels of both fragments 
in the hearts and brains of patients affected by AD. Controls were divided by age ≥ or ≤50 
years. Student t-test: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 ***p < 0.005 compared with AD. A 1-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also performed in all groups, followed by Bonferroni 
post hoc analysis. ANOVA was significant for Aβ40 (p < 0.0001) and Aβ42 (p < 0.05). Post-
test for Aβ40 was significant (p < 0.001) by age group comparisons, whereas p = 0.074 for 
all groups for Aβ42. The Levene test was performed for equal variances. A larger sample 
size may be necessary to establish the significance of the differences. The axis of ordinates 
is separated to better visualize the control values. Values indicate pg/mg Aβ/total protein.

 Central Illustration. Myocardial Aβ Amyloid Deposits in Alzheimer Disease
Aβ aggregates extend outside the central nervous system to the myocardium in AD. Patients 
with a diagnosis of AD present with clinical signs of a functional defect. Therefore, in the 
context of increasing life expectancy, these findings raise an alarming threat for public 
health, as they suggest that the 2 maladies may coexist, either sharing a common etiology or 
as phenotypes of a multiorgan syndrome. Aβ = amyloid beta; AD = Alzheimer’s disease; 
BBB = blood-brain barrier.
