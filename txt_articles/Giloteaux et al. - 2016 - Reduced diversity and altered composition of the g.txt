Abstract
Background: Gastrointestinal disturbances are among symptoms commonly reported by individuals diagnosed
with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). However, whether ME/CFS is associated with
an altered microbiome has remained uncertain. Here, we profiled gut microbial diversity by sequencing 16S ribosomal
ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes from stool as well as inflammatory markers from serum for cases (n = 48) and controls
(n = 39). We also examined a set of inflammatory markers in blood: C-reactive protein (CRP), intestinal fatty acid-binding
protein (I-FABP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-binding protein (LBP), and soluble CD14 (sCD14).
Results: We observed elevated levels of some blood markers for microbial translocation in ME/CFS patients; levels of
LPS, LBP, and sCD14 were elevated in ME/CFS subjects. Levels of LBP correlated with LPS and sCD14 and LPS levels
correlated with sCD14. Through deep sequencing of bacterial rRNA markers, we identified differences between the gut
microbiomes of healthy individuals and patients with ME/CFS. We observed that bacterial diversity was decreased in
the ME/CFS specimens compared to controls, in particular, a reduction in the relative abundance and diversity of
members belonging to the Firmicutes phylum. In the patient cohort, we find less diversity as well as increases in
specific species often reported to be pro-inflammatory species and reduction in species frequently described as
anti-inflammatory. Using a machine learning approach trained on the data obtained from 16S rRNA and inflammatory
markers, individuals were classified correctly as ME/CFS with a cross-validation accuracy of 82.93 %.
Conclusions: Our results indicate dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in this disease and further suggest an increased
incidence of microbial translocation, which may play a role in inflammatory symptoms in ME/CFS.

Background
Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), also known as chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS), or ME/CFS, is a debilitating
illness of unknown etiology with no widely accepted
therapy. Primary symptoms reported by patients are fa-
tigue, muscle and/or joint paint, sore throat, headaches,
unrefreshing sleep, and post-exertional malaise and
have been the basis of the widely used Fukuda diagnostic
criteria [1]. Many ME/CFS patients also report gastro-
intestinal (GI) symptoms, including but not limited to
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [2–6]. Intestinal discomfort
is also indicated in a survey of drug use by individuals with
CFS compared to controls, which found significantly more
use of antacids, H2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors
in the ME/CFS cohort [7].
The prevalence of bowel symptoms has led to attempts
to treat the disease by probiotic oral or rectal supplements.

 patients at 4 weeks following bacteriotherapy comprised
of rectal infusion of 13 enteric bacteria, though the
number with a sustained response was not well docu-
mented. In two small studies, marginal improvement in
certain symptoms was reported following oral probiotic
therapy [9, 10].
Two reports suggest altered gut microbiota in ME/CFS
patients. Using culture-based methods, Sheedy et al. [11]
described higher levels of D-lactic acid producing Entero-
coccus and Streptococcus spp. in ME/CFS patients vs. con-
trols. More recently, Norwegian ME/CFS patients and
healthy controls were found to exhibit differences in gut
microbiota composition through a 16S rRNA gene se-
quencing study [12]. It is well documented that gut
microbiota can be significant with respect to patho-
logical intestinal conditions such as ulcerative colitis
(UC), Crohn’s disease (CD) [13], and systemic diseases
such as diabetes [14]. Because of the frequent occur-
rence of GI disturbances, as well as these prior reports
of abnormalities, we investigated the diversity and com-
position of the gut microbiota of ME/CFS patients in
comparison to healthy individuals.
Along with GI symptoms, individuals with ME/CFS ap-
pear to have both immune activation and immune dys-
function. Many of the common symptoms reported by
ME/CFS patients are characteristic of inflammatory ill-
nesses [15]. Most reports concerning cytokine levels in
ME/CFS patients vs. controls are somewhat limited in
scope and discordant, but several recent papers with a
51-plex cytokine assay indicate abnormal immune sig-
natures in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid [16, 17].
Abnormal immune activation can be caused by trans-
location of microbes from an inflamed gut [18]. A prior
report indicated increased IgA and IgM to lipopolysac-
charide (LPS) in serum of CFS patients [19]. We therefore
assayed plasma levels of LPS and LPS-binding protein, as
well as the LPS/LBP receptor sCD14 [20]. We also exam-
ined the levels of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory
marker, and I-FABP as a marker for gastrointestinal tract
integrity [21].
Objective molecular markers for diagnosis of ME/CFS
are lacking. We examined the levels of plasma markers
and microbiota composition in the diseased vs. healthy
subjects in order to determine whether the data, taken
together, could predict ME/CFS vs. healthy status.
Results
Study population characteristics
Subjects with ME/CFS were established patients of a ME/
CFS specialist, Susan Levine, M.D. and fit the Fukuda diag-
nostic criteria [1]. This study began before the criteria for
systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID) were estab-
lished [22], but most, perhaps all, also fit the description of
SEID. Of the 48 patients and 39 control participants who
self-reported good health, 34 ME/CFS patients and 7 con-
trols self-reported gastrointestinal disturbances such as
constipation, diarrhea, or intestinal discomfort. Many ME/
CFS patients are able to identify an acute, often flu-like,
illness that immediately preceded the onset of the dis-
ease eventually diagnosed as ME/CFS, while others are
unaware of an initiating event and consider their onset
to be gradual. Among the 48 ME/CFS patients in the
study, 19 indicated a gradual and 25 stated a sudden onset.
ME/CFS subjects completed the SF-36 form (Additional
file 1: Figure S1) and Bell’s Disability scale (Table 1).
In comparison to other studies in which patients diag-
nosed with ME/CFS also filled out the SF-36 form, our
study population fell within the same ranges on the eight
subscales of the SF-36 (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Measurements of levels of microbial translocation
markers indicate microbial translocation
We quantified plasma levels of hsCRP, lipopolysaccha-
rides (LPS) as a marker of microbial translocation (MT)
and plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP)
as a marker for gastrointestinal tract damage in both
groups. The distribution of plasma hsCRP, LPS and I-FABP
is shown in Fig. 1. Levels of hsCRP were higher in the ME/
CFS population in comparison to healthy controls (1.38
and 1.21 mg/L, respectively), but the difference was not
statistically significant (P = 0.15, Fig. 1a, Table 2).
ME/CFS patients had significantly higher plasma LPS
levels than healthy individuals (median ME/CFS—
119.43 pg/mL vs. controls—74.74 pg/mL, P < 0.0005,
Fig. 1b and Table 2). The median plasma I-FABP level
was 341.9 pg/mL in the ME/CFS group and 301 pg/mL in
the healthy group. Though the median I-FABP levels in
the ME/CFS group was higher than that of the healthy
group, the difference was not statistically significant
(P = 0.27, Fig. 1c, Table 2).
To obtain further information concerning chronic LPS
stimulation in vivo, we also measured plasma sCD14 levels
and plasma LBP, which is produced by gastrointestinal and

 hepatic epithelial cells. Thus, increased LPS in the circula-
tion promote hepatic synthesis of LBP, a plasma protein
that increases the binding of LPS to CD14. sCD14 and
LBP concentrations in both groups are shown in Fig. 1. For
the ME/CFS cohort the median plasma sCD14 concentra-
tion was 1.97 ug/mL, and the median LBP plasma concen-
tration was 17.68 ug/mL. These values were significantly
different from the plasma sCD14 and LBP concentra-
tions of the healthy volunteers (1.36 ug/mL; P < 0.0005
and 12.32 ug/mL; P < 0.0005, respectively) (Fig. 1d, e,
Table 2).
Next, we analyzed the associations among biomarker
measurements in the ME/CFS population. As can be
seen in Fig. 2a, b plasma LPS levels correlated posi-
tively with levels of sCD14 and LBP (r = 0.347, P < 0.01
and r = 0.487, P < 0.01, respectively), consistent with
stimulation of sCD14 production by LPS in vivo. In
addition, we found a strong significant correlation be-
tween plasma sCD14 and hsCRP and sCD14 and LBP;
high levels of sCD14 were associated with high levels of
hsCRP (r = 0.507, P < 0.01) and LBP (r = 0.578, P < 0.01)
(Fig. 2c, d). We also analyzed whether enterocyte dam-
age (i.e., I-FABP levels) was associated with the pro-
posed microbial translocation markers LPS, sCD14, and
LBP. We found no relationship between I-FABP and
LPS levels (r = −0.125; P = 0.278), I-FABP and sCD14
levels (r = −0.117; P = 0.310), or I-FABP and LBP levels
(r = −0.08; P = 0.488).
Stool microbiota of ME/CFS patients exhibit reduced
diversity and different composition than healthy controls
The hypervariable V4 region of 16S rRNA genes was se-
quenced from fecal samples of individuals with ME/CFS
(n = 48) and healthy individuals (n = 39). A total of
8,534,117 high-quality and classifiable reads were gener-
ated from all samples, with an average of 98,093 ± 29,231
reads per sample. Binning sequences using a pairwise
identity threshold of 97 %, we obtained an average of
1330 ± 423 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) per
sample. The sequence-based rarefaction curves based on
the Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) metric were nearly asymp-
totic and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test demonstrated a statis-
tical difference in the diversity of ME/CFS and healthy
individuals (P = 0.004, W = 1268) (Fig. 3a).
We examined the number of “observed species,” i.e., the
number of 97 % ID OTUs observed in 32,223 sequences,
the estimators of community evenness (Shannon H), and
richness (Chao1 and PD) in the two group of samples.
ME/CFS samples had a significant overall lower microbial
diversity, with lower evenness (H = 5.33 ± 0.93 vs. 5.92 ±
0.93, P = 0.004), and lower richness (observed species,
1204 ± 351 vs. 1486 ± 456; Chao1, 2363 ± 704 vs. 2918 ±
885, P = 0.002; PD, 61.6 ± 16.7 vs. 73.4 ± 19.04, P = 0.004)
(Fig. 3b).
To evaluate overall differences in beta-diversity between
the microbiomes, we applied Principal Component Ana-
lysis (PCoA) to weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance

the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test

 metric matrices generated for the sample set. Within the
microbial community cluster, there appears to be no clear
difference in beta-diversity between the ME/CFS group
and healthy group using both weighted (Additional file 2:
Figure S2a) and unweighted (Additional file 2: Figure S2b)
UniFrac distance matrices. None of the other parameters
tested, i.e., sex, BMI, or clinical data revealed clustering
(data not shown). Because beta-diversity clustering as mea-
sured by UniFrac shows how dissimilar overall community
structure is between samples, the samples may not cluster
in a manner that reflects differences detected at the OTU
level, or the overall alpha diversity within groups.
The overall microbial composition for ME/CFS and con-
trols differed at the phylum and family levels (Fig. 4a, b),
although none of these differences were statistically sig-
nificant after multiple test correction. The two largest
phyla represented in each dataset of healthy and ME/CFS-
afflicted individuals were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. In
healthy individuals, this corresponded to 46 and 45 % re-
spectively of the rarified 16S rRNA sequences. Also, Pro-
teobacteria made up the next largest represented phylum
(3.6 %), with Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria in rela-
tively low relative abundance (2.1 and 1.6 %, respectively).
At the phylum level, the abundance of the Bacteroidetes
was comparable (52 %) in both datasets (Fig. 4a). ME/CFS
samples showed lower relative abundance of Firmicutes
(35 %) (Fig. 4a) and higher relative abundance of Proteo-
bacteria (8 %), due almost entirely to a twofold increase in
the Proteobacteria family Enterobacteriaceae (6 vs. 3 % for
ME/CFS and healthy individuals, respectively) (Fig. 4b).
Within the Firmicutes, at the family level, Ruminococca-
ceae were lower in the ME/CFS samples (16 vs. 11 % in
ME/CFS and healthy individuals respectively) (Fig. 4b),
whereas Lachnospiraceae were similar among both data-
sets (16 % for both healthy and ME/CFS samples). Some
differences were noted between cases and controls in
family members of the Bacteroidetes, i.e., Bacteroidaceae
(35 vs. 43 %), Rickenellaceae (3 vs. 4 %), and Prevotella-
ceae (3.2 vs. 0.7 %). Finally, within the Actinobacteria,
Bifidobacteriaceae were lower in the ME/CFS samples
(1 vs. 0.5 %).
At the OTU level, 40 OTUs were found to be signifi-
cantly different between groups after multiple testing cor-
rection. The majority of them belonged to the Firmicutes
phylum, including members of the Ruminococcaceae
family such as Oscillospira spp. (q = 0.016), Faecalibac-
terium prausnitzii (q = 0.014), and Ruminococcus spp.
(q = 0.014) and members of the Lachnospiraceae, i.e.,
Coprococcus spp. (q = 0.014). Other OTUs included
members of the Actinobacteria such as Eggerthella
lenta (q = 0.014) and Collinsella aerofaciens (q = 0.014).
These significant differences were further confirmed
by LEfSe analysis, which uses linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) coupled with effect size measurements to identify
bacterial taxa whose sequences are differentially abundant
between ME/CFS and healthy individuals. In addition to
detecting significant features, LEfSe also ranks features by
effect size, which put features explaining most of the bio-
logical difference at top (Segata et al. 2011). LEfSe identified
24 discriminative features (genus level, LDA score >2)
whose relative abundance varied significantly among fecal
samples taken from the ME/CFS and healthy groups (Fig. 5).
ME/CFS microbiota were enriched with an unclassified
member of the Desulfohalobacteriaceae and genera from
the Firmicutes phylum, i.e., Oscillospira, Lactococcus, Anae-
rotruncus and Coprobacillus and Eggerthella, a member of
the Actinobacteria phylum (P < 0.05, Fig. 5). Eighteen gen-
era were enriched in the control group compared to the
ME/CFS group (Fig. 5) with members mainly belonging to
the Firmicutes phylum. We observed that members of
the Ruminococcaeae and Bifidobacteriaceae, i.e., Fae-
calibacterium and Bifidobacterium, respectively, were

Using a machine learning approach, samples were mostly
successfully classified into healthy and ME/CFS groups,
with the highest proportion of samples correctly classified
when genus-level taxa along with data from the inflamma-
tory markers were used in the analysis. With 97 % ID
OTUs used in the analysis, 82 % of the samples could be
correctly classified (standard deviation of 0.14). With
OTUs collapsed at the species level, the average accuracy
was 0.80 with a standard deviation of 0.11. Collapsing

Discussion
Our analysis of the microbiome in cases suggests that
gastrointestinal tract of ME/CFS patients is a pro-inflam-
matory environment. This environment might cause dam-
age to the intestinal epithelium, thus augmenting microbial
translocation (MT) and subsequently triggering an im-
mune response. It has been previously documented that
disruption of mucosal barrier function occurs in ME/CFS
as demonstrated by the increased serum concentrations of
IgA and IgM to LPS of Gram-negative enterobacteria [19].
Our data supports the hypothesis of increased MT in the
ME/CFS group as evidenced by (i) significantly raised
levels of plasma LPS and (ii) significantly higher levels of
sCD14 and LBP, as indicators of direct LPS stimulation.
Increased gut permeability and increased LPS levels have
been also described in patients with liver diseases, alcoholic,
and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [23], during chronic HIV
infection [24], and in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
[25, 26] suggesting that an activation of pro-inflammatory
and endotoxin-signaling cascades could be important
for disease progression in ME/CFS. Consequently, high
plasma LPS levels in ME/CFS could result from an in-
creased production of endotoxin upon changes in the
gut microbiota. Furthermore, we observed that sCD14
levels positively correlated with levels of LPS, LBP, and
hsCRP. If there is damage to the gut mucosa, microbial
translocation could increase, altering antimicrobial regula-
tors and dysregulating the innate immune system.
As a marker, LPS is limited to particular microbes, as
it is only present in Gram-negative bacteria. sCD14 is
produced primarily by macrophages and hepatocytes in
response to LPS but is also stimulated by other bacterial
and viral agents [27]. LBP functions as a co-factor along

 with sCD14 and is constitutively synthesized in hepato-
cytes to recognize LPS released to the bloodstream but
various inflammatory factors such as IL22, IL-6, and
TNF-α can induce its expression [28, 29]. Nevertheless,
we found significantly more patients with elevated levels
of these biomarkers in comparison to the healthy group,
suggesting that more MT occurs in people affected by
ME/CFS.
Using both aerobic and anaerobic culturing methods,
Butt and colleagues were the first to present evidence of
altered fecal microbiota in ME/CFS patients compared
to healthy individuals [30]. Subsequently, using culture
methods and metabolite analysis, Sheedy et al. [11] ob-
tained information concerning the fecal microbiome in
patient and health cohorts. Both found that D-lactic
acid-producing Enterococcus and Streptococcus species
were strongly over-represented in ME/CFS patients and
that among anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella was a bacterial
genus found to be in excess in subjects with ME/CFS.
Recently, a study used high-throughput 16S rRNA
gene sequencing to investigate the presence of specific
alterations in the gut microbiota of ME/CFS patients
from Belgium and Norway [12]. The authors amplified
the V5 and V6 hypervariable 16S rRNA regions and se-
quenced the amplicons using a Roche FLX 454 sequen-
cer, which resulted in an average of only 6000–7000
reads/sample. In contrast, we amplified the V4 hypervar-
iable region of the 16S rRNA gene, sequenced amplicons
using the MiSeq Illumina platform, obtained an average
of many more reads/sample (98,000), and compared the
resulting sequences to a different database, the Green-
genes non-redundant reference database [31]. Our ana-
lysis showed that within-sample diversity is lower in the
ME/CFS specimens compared to controls. The same indi-
ces in the Fremont et al. [12] study did not differ between
ME/CFS and healthy subjects [12], likely due to the lower
read number they obtained. Lower richness has also been
observed in unhealthy or inflammatory states [32, 33] and
has been associated with IBD, necrotizing enterocolitis
[34], and greater abdominal discomfort levels in patients
with food intolerances [35, 36].
Regardless of disease state, bacteria belonging to the
Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actino-
bacteria phyla represented the vast majority of sequences
identified. We observed reduced levels of members of the
dominant phylum Firmicutes, also noted repeatedly in
Crohn’s disease patients [13, 37, 38]. Proteobacteria were
more abundant in ME/CFS patients than in controls,
observed as well in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pa-
tients [39, 40]. In an inflamed gut, infiltrating macrophages
and neutrophils release sulfur- and nitrogen-derived
metabolites such as tetrathionate and nitrate [41–44].
Opportunistic members of the Proteobacteria can take
advantage of the host inflammatory response by using
these compounds as electron acceptors [43, 44] to gener-
ate energy and foster their own growth in the gut. We did
not collect information concerning diet of patients and
thus do not know whether this factor might have affected
the composition and/or metabolism of the colonic micro-
biota in our cohorts.
We observed significantly lower levels of the genus
Faecalibacterium, a member of the Ruminococcaceae in
the ME/CFS population. For example, Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii, which produces an anti-inflammatory pro-
tein [45], is reduced in ME/CFS cases relative to con-
trols. This genus is also depleted in IBD [13, 38] and
ulcerative colitis [46] and has been shown to have anti-
inflammatory properties both in vitro and in vivo [37].
Faecalibacterium belongs to a group of producers of
butyrate, a short chain fatty acid known to have anti-
inflammatory properties and to protect the intestine
[40]. Individuals with IBD and IBS [47] exhibit a lack of
butyrate-producing bacteria and lower levels of butyr-
ate in their gut [48, 49] which modulates different pro-
cesses including hormone and cytokine secretion (e.g.,
leptin, IL-10) and activation of immune/inflammatory
responses [50–52].
We also found a decrease in Bifidobacterium, previously
observed in IBS [53–57], IBD [58], and type II diabetes
[59]. Bifidobacteria are a group of lactic acid-producing
bacteria that are widely used as probiotics and as tar-
gets for prebiosis [60]. Treatment with Bifidobacterium
infantis 35624 was reported to reduce CRP levels in a
cohort of ME/CFS patients [61].
We have employed a supervised machine learning ap-
proach to help prediction of disease state based on the
microbiome sequence datasets [62]. Using this approach,
we were able to classify unlabeled samples with some de-
gree of accuracy, as demonstrated by the high AUC ROC
value obtained (0.8928) at the genus level. This method
has been recently used in several microbiome surveys to
accurately place individuals into an IBD/healthy category
[63], including ulcerative colitis (ROC AUC = 0.9225) and
colonic (ROC AUC = 0.8787) or ileal Crohn’s disease
(ROC AUC = 0.9699) [64]. Such an approach could there-
fore serve as a complement to other non-invasive diagno-
ses of symptoms or as an initial diagnosis to determine if
the subject likely has ME/CFS. Because this is a relatively
small cohort, to move to a formal diagnostic clinical ap-
plication, a large cohort of ME/CFS and healthy con-
trols would be needed to verify that classification would
retain its accuracy with independent sample handling
and sequencing.
Conclusions
Taken together, our results suggest an ongoing damage to
the gut mucosa, leading to increased microbial transloca-
tion in ME/CFS, which in turn could alter antimicrobial

 regulators and disregulate the innate immune system.
Differences between the gut microbiomes of healthy indi-
viduals and patients with ME/CFS were identified in terms
of relative abundance of specific genera. There is no single
precise alteration of the gut microbiota in all ME/CFS pa-
tients we examined, but our data converges to support the
concept of a less diverse and unstable community of bac-
teria in the disorder. It highlights the association of specific
bacterial taxa with ME/CFS, and the identification of the
underlying role of this altered commensal gut microbiota
could lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies
that would improve clinical outcome. Future studies may
also reveal additional molecular markers that could be
combined with gut microbiome information to enhance
the sensitivity and specificity of ME/CFS diagnostic assays.
The cause of ME/CFS is unknown, but gut dysbiosis
could be contributing to some of the symptoms and their
severity. Developing therapeutic interventions aimed at re-
ducing local inflammation, restoring gastrointestinal tract
immunity and integrity and modifying the intestinal micro-
biome may ameliorate ME/CFS symptoms in a number of
affected patients.
Methods
Human subjects and sample/data collection
All work involving human subjects was approved by the
Cornell University Institutional Review Board. Fecal sam-
ples were collected at home by participants in 15-ml con-
ical tubes containing RNAlater (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY) and refrigerated prior to shipment. Upon ar-
rival at Cornell University, the samples were divided into
aliquots and stored at −80 °C until processing. Blood
samples were drawn into EDTA and heparin tubes from
an antecubital vein with subjects in the seated position.
Samples were shipped by overnight courier from New
York City to Cornell University (Ithaca). Upon receipt,
samples were centrifuged at 4000 r.p.m. for 30 min to
pellet blood cells, and plasma was stored at −80 °C until
further analyses. BMI, age, and gender of subjects were
recorded. ME/CFS subjects completed the Short Form
36 Health Survey (SF-36.org) and Bell’s Disability Scale
[65]. Potential controls from the same geographic area
as cases were screened by the physician for suitability
as healthy controls. As indicated in Table 1, mean and
median ages of cases and controls were within 5 years
and the female to male ratios were similar.
Plasma level determination of hsCRP, sCD14, LBP, LPS,
and I-FABP
High-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured
from unhemolyzed EDTA plasma using a Chemilumines-
cence immunoassay on an Immulite 2000 (Siemens
Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL). Markers
for microbial translocation, sCD14 and LBP, were measured
in plasma samples by commercially available enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Plasma sCD14
was quantified using the Quantikine Human sCD14
Immunoassay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and
plasma LBP was measured by LBP soluble ELISA kit
(Hycult Biotechnology, Uden, The Netherlands) according
to the manufacturers’ protocols. Plasma bacterial endo-
toxin, i.e., LPS, was measured from heparinized blood
samples (Brandtzaeg) using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate
(LAL) assay (Lonza Group Ltd, Allendale, NJ). The method
uses a chromogenic endpoint assay yielding data as endo-
toxin units (EU/ml). Briefly, 100 μl of each plasma sample
was diluted in 200 μl of β-G-Blocker (Lonza Group Ltd,
Allendale, NJ) to eliminate the possibility of false positives.
Samples were further diluted with 100 μl of pyrogen-free
water to give a final dilution of 1:4. All dilutions were pre-
pared in pyrogen-free tubes. Samples were then placed in a
water bath at 85 °C for 15 min to inactivate inhibitory
plasma proteins. Results of LPS measured were expressed
in picograms per milliliter (1 EU/ml = 100 pg/ml). Levels
of intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), a marker
associated with enterocyte damage, were assayed using an
ELISA (Hycult Biotechnology, Uden, the Netherlands) ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s instructions. All the samples
were run in duplicate.
Statistical analysis of plasma markers levels
We initially performed a Shapiro-Wilk test to check if
the data was normally distributed [66]. In case of viola-
tion of normality, data was log transformed and checked
again for normality. Both parametric independent samples
t test and a non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U
test were used to determine the significance of differences
in each subject group. Values of P < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. All data from the biomarkers levels
determination were processed and analyzed in SPSS
Statistics Version 21 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).
DNA extraction, 16S rRNA gene sequencing
Metagenomic DNA was isolated from an aliquot of
~100 mg from each fecal sample using the PowerSoil-htp
DNA isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories Ltd, Carlsbad, CA),
which involves both chemical and physical lysis of the cells.
We amplified 16S rRNA genes (V4 hypervariable region)
from bulk DNA using the 515F and 806R primers as
previously described [67] prior to sequencing. Duplicate
PCR reactions of samples and extraction blanks consisted
of 2.5X HotMasterMix (5-Prime, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD),
10–100 ng DNA template, and 0.05 μM of each primer.
DNA amplification of samples and extraction blanks was
performed on a 96-well plate with a minicycler PTC 200
(MJ Research) starting with 3-min denaturation at 94 °C,
followed by 25 cycles consisting of denaturation (45 s at
94 °C), annealing (60 s at 50 °C), extension (90 s at 72 °C),
Giloteaux et al. Microbiome  (2016) 4:30 
Page 9 of 12
 and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Samples were
randomly distributed on the plate with no grouping for
sample type. The replicate PCR reactions were combined
and purified using a magnetic bead system (Mag-Bind
EZPure, Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA). PCR amplicons
were quantified using the QuantiT PicoGreen dsDNA
Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Aliquots of amplicons
(at equal masses) were combined for a final concentration
of approximately 15 ng/μl. Extraction blanks showed no
amplification. All amplicons were then sequenced on a
single run using the Illumina MiSeq 2x250 bp platform at
Cornell Biotechnology Resource Center Genomics Facility.
Quality filtering and analysis of the 16S rRNA gene
sequence data were performed with QIIME 1.9.0 as
previously described [68]. Briefly, matching paired-end
raw sequences (mate-pairs) were merged using the fastq-
join command in the ea-utils software package (http://
code.google.com/p/ea-utils), and merged sequences with
less than a 200-bp overlap were filtered out of the dataset.
The remaining merged sequences were quality filtered
and assigned to samples based on their barcodes using the
default parameters of QIIME. Sequences were assigned to
97 % ID OTUs by comparing them to a non-redundant
reference database of near-full length sequences [31]. All
OTUs that were observed fewer than two times, i.e., sin-
gletons, were removed from the analysis. The OTU table
was rarefied to the sequence count of the sample with the
lowest sequence depth, 32,223 sequences per sample, and
used in all subsequent analyses. For statistical compari-
sons of healthy individuals to those afflicted with ME/
CFS, p values obtained with the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
U test were corrected for multiple comparisons using the
false discovery rate of Benjamini and Hochberg, imple-
mented in the QIIME pipeline. We used both the weighted
and unweighted UniFrac distance metrics as measures of
between-sample (beta) diversity and applied principal coor-
dinates analysis (PCoA) to visualize patterns of diversity.
Within-samples (alpha) diversity was calculated using three
different measures (1) ChaoI index [69]; (2) Shannon Index
[70]; and (3) Phylogenetic Diversity [71].
LEfSe analysis and machine learning
Linear discriminant effect size analysis (LEfSe) on filtered
datasets [72] was performed at the genus level to find fea-
tures (genera) differentially represented between healthy
and ME/CFS groups. LEfSe combines the standard tests
for statistical significance (Kruskal-Wallis test and pair-
wise Wilcoxon test) with linear discriminate analysis. It
ranks features by effect size, which put features that ex-
plain most of the biological difference at top. LEfSe ana-
lysis was performed under the following conditions: the α
value for the factorial Kruskal-Wallis test among classes
was 0.05 and the threshold on the logarithmic LDA score
for discriminative features was 2.0.
A machine learning approach was used to identify vari-
ables discriminating the two groups of samples (feature
selection). For these analyses, we used either 97 % OTUs,
or taxa abundances based on combining OTUs at the spe-
cies and genus levels. Classification of samples as healthy
controls or ME/CFS was carried out by using a random
forest approach with supervised learning [73] and area
under the curve (AUC) calculation to optimize feature
(e.g., abundance of a particular genus) selection, imple-
mented in the software package R. Scripts, required pack-
ages, and instructions for processing data are available on
https://gist.github.com/walterst/2222618976a66b3fc8dd. In
addition to the taxonomic abundance data, levels of in-
flammatory markers (BMI, sCD14, LBP, LPS, and I-FABP)
were included in the analysis. Average accuracies were
calculated with five repeats of 10-fold cross validation,
which is intended to predict the accuracy of the model,
and indicate over-fitting if significantly different than
the full dataset results, by subsampling the data and
testing this training subsample against the remaining
data reference set.
