ABSTRACT
Vibrio cholerae is an important human pathogen and environmental mi-
croflora species that can both propagate in the human intestine and proliferate in
zooplankton and aquatic organisms. Cholera is transmitted through food and water.
In recent years, outbreaks caused by V. cholerae-contaminated soft-shelled turtles,
contaminated mainly with toxigenic serogroup O139, have been frequently reported,
posing a new foodborne disease public health problem. In this study, the coloniza-
tion by toxigenic V. cholerae on the body surfaces and intestines of soft-shelled tur-
tles was explored. Preferred colonization sites on the turtle body surfaces, mainly
the carapace and calipash of the dorsal side, were observed for the O139 and O1
strains. Intestinal colonization was also found. The colonization factors of V. cholerae
played different roles in the colonization of the soft-shelled turtle’
s body surface and in-
testine. Mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA) of V. cholerae was necessary for
body surface colonization, but no roles were found for toxin-coregulated pili (TCP)
or N-acetylglucosamine-binding protein A (GBPA). Both TCP and GBPA play impor-
tant roles for colonization in the intestine, whereas the deletion of MSHA revealed
only a minor colonization-promoting role for this factor. Our study demonstrated
that V. cholerae can colonize the surfaces and the intestines of soft-shelled turtles
and indicated that the soft-shelled turtles played a role in the transmission of chol-
era. In addition, this study showed that the soft-shelled turtle has potential value as
an animal model in studies of the colonization and environmental adaption mecha-
nisms of V. cholerae in aquatic organisms.
IMPORTANCE Cholera is transmitted through water and food. Soft-shelled turtles
contaminated with Vibrio cholerae (commonly the serogroup O139 strains) have
caused many foodborne infections and outbreaks in recent years, and they have be-
come a foodborne disease problem. Except for epidemiological investigations, no
experimental studies have demonstrated the colonization by V. cholerae on soft-
shelled turtles. The present studies will benefit our understanding of the interaction
between V. cholerae and the soft-shelled turtle. We demonstrated the colonization
by V. cholerae on the soft-shelled turtle’
s body surface and in the intestine and re-
vealed the different roles of major V. cholerae factors for colonization on the body
surface and in the intestine. Our work provides experimental evidence for the role of
soft-shelled turtles in cholera transmission. In addition, this study also shows the
possibility for the soft-shelled turtle to serve as a new animal model for studying the
interaction between V. cholerae and aquatic hosts.

 epidemics to date. Seven cholera pandemics have been recorded historically. Accord-
ing to etiological evidence, the sixth pandemic was caused by the classical biotype of
serogroup O1, and the seventh pandemic, which began in 1961 and is ongoing, was
caused by the O1 El Tor biotype of serogroup O1 (2). In 1992, cholera caused by
serogroup O139 emerged in India and spread to many countries in Asia (3, 4). In 1993,
cholera from serogroup O139 was found in China, and since then, sporadic O139
cholera cases and local outbreaks have appeared in some provinces.
In addition to human hosts, V. cholerae naturally inhabits aquatic environments,
particularly estuarine water, by colonizing zooplankton (5, 6). It can use chitin as a
carbon and nitrogen source, which may also benefit the carbon and nitrogen cycles in
aquatic environments (7). Water and seafood contaminated with V. cholerae are com-
mon sources of infections and outbreaks. In addition, foodborne infections and out-
breaks of cholera, mainly of serogroup O139, mediated by soft-shell turtles have been
frequently reported in China. Some investigations have reported that the rates of
detection of V. cholerae on soft-shelled turtles were higher than for other aquatic
products (8, 9). In some areas, the detection rate has reached 8.9% (9). Epidemiological
and laboratory investigations of some cholera outbreaks showed that V. cholerae strains
isolated from turtle samples had molecular subtyping patterns indistinguishable from
those of patient strains, which suggested that the turtles served as the vehicle (10–13).
V. cholerae was also found in soft-shelled turtles imported from Malaysia to China and
from Bangladesh to Japan (14, 15). V. cholerae strains have been isolated from turtles’
surfaces, cloacae, intestines, and eggs (9, 10, 13, 16–18). Taken together, these results
provide strong evidence that V. cholerae can adhere to and colonize soft-shelled turtles.
Thus, since no appearance or weight changes have been observed in turtles carrying V.
cholerae, this colonization may result in the wide spread of the strains through markets.
Soft-shelled turtles are reptiles that inhabit standing or slow-flowing bodies of
water, such as reservoirs, ponds, and rivers, and they are known as a nutrient-rich food
in Asian countries, particularly, China (19). The large-scale breeding of soft-shelled
turtles has been rapidly expanding, particularly, in eastern and southeastern China.
Soft-shelled turtle consumption has reached approximately 100 to 150 million kilo-
grams annually (20). Pelodiscus sinensis (commonly known as Chinese soft-shelled
turtles), Palea steindachneri, and Pelochelys bibroni are three species of soft-shelled
turtles in China. Among them, P. steindachneri and P. bibroni are rare animals protected
by Chinese law, and only Chinese soft-shelled turtles can be sold in markets for
consumption. The relationship of cholera cases or outbreaks to soft-shelled turtles has
mainly been identified through epidemiological investigations and the isolation of
strains. Direct observation of V. cholerae colonizing soft-shelled turtles is rare, except for
an experiment that showed that V. cholerae could adhere to soft-shelled turtle egg-
shells and invade eggs (21). Such studies will provide new insight into the colonization
of soft-shelled turtles by V. cholerae and will have profound significance for human
health and foodborne infectious disease control and prevention.
Mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA), toxin-coregulated pili (TCP), and
N-acetylglucosamine-binding protein A (GBP) are three important factors of V. cholerae
colonization that have been identified in animal models. MSHA, which is a member of
the family of type IV pili and is associated with hemagglutinating activity, plays a
significant role in biofilm formation on abiotic or biotic surfaces (22) and promotes
adherence to zooplankton (23). No apparent role for MSHA in V. cholerae colonization
of human or mouse intestines has been reported (24, 25). TCP is another type IV pilus
that is necessary for colonization of the mammalian intestine and for pathogenesis (24,
26, 27). GBP is a chitin-binding protein that is involved in the attachment to chitin and
mammalian intestine cells (28, 29). Although these three colonization factors have been
widely studied, most studies are based on the mammalian intestine, zooplankton, and
chitin surfaces. Their roles on the surfaces and in the intestines of soft-shelled turtles
have not been investigated.
In this study, we estimated the colonization of the soft-shelled turtle by toxigenic V.
cholerae. The colonization ability was certified on the body surface and in the intestine,

 and the roles of various colonization factors were identified. This study suggests that,
aside from its epidemiological significance in the spread of cholera, the soft-shelled
turtle can also be developed as a model for V. cholerae colonization.
RESULTS
Colonization of V. cholerae strains on the surface of the soft-shelled turtle. To
observe V. cholerae colonization on the soft-shelled turtle’
s surface and identify colo-
nization sites, we constructed a bioluminescent strain, VC4251, of the V. cholerae
serogroup O139 using the lux reporter plasmid pXEN-pmdh-luxCDABE. Soft-shelled
turtles were infected via immersion in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing
approximately 107 CFU/ml bioluminescent cells. Because V. cholerae strains grow slowly
in aquatic environments and too many rounds of anesthesia will lead to turtle deaths,
bioluminescence was measured 24 h postinfection and observed every 24 h. At 96 h,
the entire dorsal sides of the turtles emitted photons. Hence, the soft-shelled turtles
were not analyzed for bacterial colonization after 96 h postinfection. After the biolu-
minescence imaging analysis, the surfaces of the soft-shelled turtles were sampled with
sterile cotton swabs, and the experimental strains were obtained.
The surface bioluminescence imaging results showed that strong bioluminescent
signals could be detected at 24 h and that the bioluminescence increased gradually
with time (Fig. 1). Compared with that on the ventral sides, the dorsal sides emitted
more photons. Photon emission was strongest and most stable on the calipashes
during the experiments, showing that V. cholerae had the strongest ability to colonize
the calipash. In addition, relatively strong bioluminescent signals could also be moni-
tored on the dorsal sides of the carapaces, and these signals increased gradually with
time (Fig. 1). The entire dorsal sides of the soft-shelled turtles’ carapaces emitted
photons at 96 h. The bioluminescent signals could also be detected on the dorsal sides
of the limbs and necks. Poor photon emission was detected on the ventral sides, and
the main bioluminescent sites on this side were on the limbs. Lower photon emission
was detected on the plastrons, calipashes, and necks on the ventral sides (Fig. 1). A
bioluminescent strain of V. cholerae serogroup O1 (VC1898) was also constructed based
on the bioluminescent plasmid pXEN-pmdh-luxCDABE to estimate the colonization by
V. cholerae O1 on soft-shelled turtles. Using the same infection and bioluminescence
imaging procedures, the colonization by this serogroup O1 strain on the soft-shelled
turtle surface was observed. The colonization sites and the expanded bioluminescent
areas were similar to those of O139 strain VC4251.
To determine the possible outer membrane factors of V. cholerae involved in its
colonization on the body surfaces of soft-shelled turtles, mutations were made in the
genes encoding TCP, MSHA, and GBP. The mutant strains were then tested for their
ability to colonize and were compared with their corresponding isogenic wild-type
strains. We first determined the colonization functions of these gene mutants with
competition tests in the infant mouse intestine, the commonly used colonization model
for evaluation of these factors in V. cholerae, and confirmed their effects for strain
VC4251 (Fig. 2). In addition, no obvious growth defects were found between the
wild-type strain and mutants carrying the pXEN-pmdh-luxCDABE plasmid, and all
strains produced similar levels of bioluminescent light at the same time points (see Fig.
S1C and D in the supplemental material). Using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
assays, the transcription of these three genes at 28°
C was also confirmed, whereas the
knockout mutants did not express mRNAs for the deleted genes (data not shown).
These strains were used in the following experiments. Bioluminescence imaging of the
turtles’body surfaces showed that in comparison to the wild-type strain, VC4251, the
gbpA and tcpA mutant strains had similar photon emission trends, i.e., expanded
bioluminescent areas on the dorsal sides and stable areas on the ventral sides of the
turtles (Fig. 1). However, the mshA mutant strain had poor photon emission after
infection, and after 48 h, photon emission from the strain could barely be detected on
the soft-shelled turtles’surfaces (Fig. 1). These data suggested that compared with the
wild-type strain, VC4251, the gbpA and tcpA mutant strains had similar colonization

led to a colonization defect.
Colonization competition assays of V. cholerae on the turtle surface. To accu-
rately evaluate the colonization abilities of VC4251dlacZ and mshA, gbpA, and tcpA
mutant strains, colonization competition assays were performed. According to the
surface bioluminescence imaging results, the main colonization sites for V. cholerae on
soft-shelled turtles’surfaces (the dorsal side carapace, calipash, and limbs) were sam-
pled in the colonization competition assays. We measured the optical density at 600 nm
(OD600) of these strains in LB medium, and no obvious growth difference was found
between the VC4251 wild-type strain and any mutant (Fig. S1C). According to surface
bioluminescence imaging, the dorsal side carapace, calipash, and limbs were colonized;
t tests were performed to compare the differences between the output ratios and input
ratios for each competition strain pair. The results showed that for gbpA and tcpA
mutants, from day 0 to day 10 on the carapace, calipash, or limbs, no significant
differences between the input and output ratios of the competition pairs (P � 0.05 by
t test) were observed. The competitive indexes of the gbpA and tcpA mutants were
always close to 1 (Fig. 3, shown with the log10 values). However, for the mshA mutant

 strain, significant colonization differences were observed on the carapaces, calipashes,
and limbs (P � 0.05 by t test). From day 2, the competitive indexes were relatively
stable and showed that loss of mshA decreased colonization by 10- to 81-fold com-
pared with that of the wild type (Fig. 3).
We also tested the colonization abilities of the three colonization factor gene
mutants which were restored by introducing the plasmids pBADmshA, pBADgbpA, and
pBADtcpA to express mshA, gbpA, and tcpA, respectively, on the carapaces, calipashes,
or limbs, from day 0 to day 10. The colonization ability for the mshA-complemented
strain was restored and even 2.5- to 11.4-fold higher than for VC4251dlacZ(pBAD), the
wild-type strain characterized by the lack of lacZ and carrying the control plasmid
pBAD24, on the carapace, calipash, and limbs (Fig. 3). For gbpA and tcpA complemen-
tary strains, the colonization competitive indexes were always close to 1 and showed
no colonization differences from strain VC4251dlacZ(pBAD) (P � 0.05 by t test).
Colonization of V. cholerae in turtle intestine. To detect whether V. cholerae can
colonize the intestines of soft-shelled turtles, the animals were intragastrically inocu-
lated with the bioluminescent O139 strain, VC4251. It was previously found that the
food digestion time of soft-shelled turtles weighing approximately 150 g was between
34.03 and 56.56 h at 28°
C (30). Thus, we chose 72 h as the colonization time. Because
soft-shelled turtles have thick carapaces, bioluminescent signals could not be directly
detected by our in vivo imaging system. Thus, at 72 h postinfection, the soft-shelled
turtles were euthanized, and the internal organs, including the hearts, livers, lungs,
kidneys, spleens, and digestive tracts, were separated and placed on the observation
platform of the imaging system. In vivo bioluminescence imaging assays showed that
bioluminescent signals could only be detected in the intestines (Fig. 4), and the V.
cholerae strain was isolated only from these segments. No bioluminescent photons
were emitted from other organs and no V. cholerae strains were isolated in other
organs.
To determine the colonization by the O1 serogroup V. cholerae strain and the
possible outer membrane factors involved in the in vivo colonization of soft-shelled
turtles, the turtles were also intragastrically inoculated with the bioluminescent-
labeled serogroup O1 strain, VC1898, and all VC4251-derived gene mutant biolu-
minescent strains. For the bioluminescence-labeled serogroup O1 strain, VC1898,
and VC4251dmshA gene mutant bioluminescent strains, the same colonization sites
(i.e., only in the intestinal tracts) were suggested by bioluminescence imaging and
bacterial isolation. However, for the VC4251dgbpA and VC4251dtcpA gene mutant
bioluminescent strains, no bioluminescent photons were emitted from the intestines,

both the bioluminescence imaging detection results and bacterial isolation results were

Colonization competition assays of V. cholerae in the turtle intestine. To accurately
evaluate the roles of MSHA, TCP, and GBP in the intestinal colonization by V. cholerae,
colonization competition assays were performed by coinfection of the strain
VC4251dlacZ and tcpA, mshA, and gbpA deletion mutants. After 72 h, the entire intestines
were isolated for plate counting of the competition strain pairs. Similar competition effects
were observed with the gbpA and tcpA groups, and the comparisons between the ratios of
the inputs and outputs were all statistically significant (P � 0.05 by t tests). Competition
index calculations showed that mutations of gbpA and tcpA decreased the colonization
abilities of the mutants by 44- and 225-fold, respectively (Fig. 5, shown with the log10
values). The colonization abilities of the gbpA and tcpA mutants were restored by the
complemented plasmids pBADgbpA and pBADtcpA, respectively, and were 2.69- and
3.57-fold higher than that for VC4251dlacZ(pBAD), respectively, as deduced by the over-
expression of these two complementary genes resulting from the strong promoter induced
by arabinose. For mshA, comparisons of the ratios between the inputs and outputs of the
VC4251dmshA-VC4251dlacZ pairs were statistically significant (P � 0.05 by t test). The
competition index analysis showed that colonization by the mshA mutant was 3.71-fold
higher than that by the wild-type strain and 1.96-fold lower when mshA was comple-
mented (Fig. 5).

 DISCUSSION
V. cholerae has two typical living environments, namely, an aquatic habitat and the
human intestine (31, 32). The organism possesses different colonization and prolifera-
tion mechanisms in each environment (33). Soft-shelled turtles have already caused
several foodborne cholera outbreaks (10–13) and have become a notable spreading
factor for cholera. In this study, we demonstrated that the soft-shelled turtle could be
colonized by V. cholerae on the surface and in the intestine, therefore playing a role in
V. cholerae transmission as a medium.
Using bioluminescence-labeled V. cholerae strains and bioluminescence imaging
techniques, the colonization sites on the soft-shelled turtle surface and the proliferation
of V. cholerae were observed directly and successively. Combined with competition
assays, these data were used to estimate the roles of the colonization factors of V.
cholerae on the soft-shelled turtle surface and in the digestive tract. Both methods
showed good repeatability. In V. cholerae, the animal models commonly used for
colonization and pathogenesis studies are infant mice and rabbits, as well as the ileal
loop of the adult rabbit (34–37). Compared with those using mammalian animal
models, studies with soft-shelled turtles provide a new method for evaluating V.
cholerae colonization on aquatic animal surfaces; animals can be continuously observed
without euthanization. In addition, zooplankton, fish, shellfish, chironomid egg masses,
waterfowl, and crustaceans are environmental hosts of V. cholerae (6, 38–43), and fish
and shellfish are proven vectors of V. cholerae (44). In studies of colonization in aquatic
organisms, soft-shelled turtles can be anesthetized and sampled out of water for
relatively long periods without the risk of hydropenia and death, due to their amphib-
ious nature, making them a better model than zebrafish and other fish or shrimp
models. Therefore, it should be possible to develop specific-pathogen-free soft-shelled
turtles as a model for studying V. cholerae survival mechanisms in aquatic environ-
ments.
From bioluminescence imaging assays, we found the colonizations by V. cholerae on
soft-shelled turtles surfaces were uneven and that the main colonization sites were the
carapace, calipash, limbs, and the dorsal side of the neck. Soft-shelled turtle muscle and
skin (45), particularly the calipash (46), are highly abundant in collagen. V. cholerae
produces collagenase (47), and collagen may be a nutrient source for the growth of V.
cholerae. The carapace and plastron have different anatomical and physiological struc-

 tures, which possibly lead to the different colonization abilities of V. cholerae at these
two sites.
MSHA, TCP, and GBP are the major colonization factors of V. cholerae and are
recognized as such in mouse models (24, 26–29) and in zooplankton (23). In the
soft-shelled turtle’
s intestine and on the body surface, we found different effects of
these factors. In the soft-shelled turtle’
s intestine, effects similar to those seen in the
mouse intestine were observed for these colonization factors. TCP was important in the
colonization by V. cholerae in the turtle intestine, similar to that in the mouse model
(24–26). MSHA pili showed an extremely important role in colonization on the turtle
body surface. In the bioluminescence imaging assays, the weak bioluminescence of the
mshA mutant strain was found in the first 24 h but hardly observed later, showing the
colonization loss caused by MSHA. We suspected it may represent nonspecific binding
in the first 24 h because of the higher bacterial concentration, and the mutant with the
defective colonization was washed away, since every 24 h the turtles were washed and
the sterile PBS was replaced during the experiments. The complement of intact mshA
to the mshA mutant restored the colonization ability and produced a slightly increased
colonization. MshA is the major pilin subunit of the MSHA pili, and we suspect that the
overexpressed MshA from the complementary plasmid could promote the assembly of
MSHA pili and result in the slightly increased colonization compared with that of the
wild-type strain. However, in the intestine, this appeared to depress colonization. A
similar effect was also found in the mouse model (25). In the suckling mouse intestine,
MSHA pili bound secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and reduced the colonization
ability of V. cholerae by preventing the bacteria from penetrating the mucus barrier and
adhering to epithelial cells (48). As reptiles, soft-shelled turtles can also produce sIgA
(49), and reptilian sIgA is evolutionarily related to mammalian sIgA (50). V. cholerae has
a low level of MSHA gene expression in the intestine (48). Therefore, we hypothesize
that the slightly lower colonization of the wild type compared with that of the mshA
deletion mutant might result from the interaction between sIgA and weakly expressed
MSHA in the wild-type strain; cells could bind to sIgA to some degree, whereas the
mshA mutant should lack MSHA pili.
Compared with that of the wild-type strain, the colonization ability of the gbpA
deletion mutant obviously decreased in the soft-shelled turtle intestine, similar to that
in the mouse intestine colonization model (51). However, on the body surfaces of
soft-shelled turtles, inactivation of gbpA has no significant effect on colonization.
Previous results have shown that deletion of the gbpA gene of V. cholerae led to a
significant decrease in colonization on the shells of crustaceans, such as crab, shrimp,
and shellfish (28, 29). Chitin is the main element of crustacean shells (52, 53), and its
�-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues are receptors for GBP-mediated
binding (54). Thus, GBP interacts with the chitinous exoskeleton and promotes the
colonization ability of V. cholerae. Soft-shelled turtles are reptiles with endoskeletons
and are distinct from crustaceans with exoskeletons (55). Epidermis, dermis, and
subcutaneous tissues cover the outside of the carapace skeleton, and these tissues are
rich in collagen (56). GBP had no effect on the V. cholerae colonization of soft-shelled
turtle shells, possibly because of this difference in structure and material composition.
In summary, we studied the colonization ability, colonization sites, and roles of
major colonization-related factors for V. cholerae on soft-shelled turtles. Soft-shelled
turtles’surfaces and intestines carried V. cholerae and allowed it to proliferate. These
outer membrane accessory structures play different but important and even aquatic
animal-specific roles in the colonization by V. cholerae on the body surfaces and in the
intestines of soft-shelled turtles. The results from this study strongly implicate soft-
shelled turtles in cholera transmission in areas with high soft-shelled turtle consump-
tion. These soft-shelled turtles are thus an important risk factor for foodborne cholera
outbreaks. In addition, soft-shelled turtles could be developed as a valuable animal

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains. V. cholerae serogroup O139 strain VC4251 and serogroup O1 strain VC1898 were
isolated from soft-shelled turtles in markets in Jiangxi and Guizhou provinces in China, respectively. Both
strains have natural resistances to streptomycin (100 �g/ml) and polymyxin B (5 �g/ml). The mshA, gbpA,
tcpA, and lacZ mutants were constructed from strain VC4251. A list of all strains used in this study is
presented in Table 1.
These strains were obtained from swab samples of the turtles and identified according to the Manual
for Prevention and Control of Cholera, 6th edition (57). The serogroups were determined with diagnosis
typing sera (Wantai Biotech, Zhengzhou, China). The Escherichia coli strain SM10 �pir was constructed
from SM10 (58) by lysogenizing with �pir to allow the replication of an R6K suicide plasmid (http://www
.openwetware.org/wiki/E._coli_genotypes) used to construct a mutant allele in allelic exchange to create
a gene mutation, which was obtained from the strain collection in our lab.
Soft-shelled turtles. Soft-shelled turtles were obtained from an aquaculture company in Shanghai.
Turtles weighing 150 g and 9 cm in length (diameter of calipash) were selected for use in these studies.
To ensure that the turtles used in this study did not carry V. cholerae before the experiments, we
screened the turtles with PCR and with isolation for V. cholerae. Surface and anus swabs were collected
from the turtles. PCR for V. cholerae was performed as previously described (ompW and ctxA were
detected as the targets of V. cholerae [59]). The surface and anus swabs were also placed in alkaline
peptone water for V. cholerae enrichment, and V. cholerae was isolated and identified according to the
Manual for Prevention and Control of Cholera, 6th edition (57). Turtles positive for any gene in the PCR
and/or isolation were excluded, and turtles negative for both detections were used in subsequent
experiments.
Each selected soft-shelled turtle was carefully washed with sterile distilled water and kept in sterile
distilled water for 48 h to remove mud from the surface and intestine. The soft-shelled turtles were kept
in sterile PBS for another 48 h to maintain osmotic pressure for the subsequent experiments. For
anesthesia, the soft-shelled turtles were placed in a sealed beaker with five ether cotton balls (containing
10 ml of ether) for 10 min. For euthanasia, the dose of ether was doubled, and the soft-shelled turtles
were kept in the sealed beaker for 60 min.
This study was performed in strict accordance with animal protocols approved by the ethics
committee of the National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC, in
accordance with the medical research regulations of the Ministry of Health, China.
Construction of bioluminescent V. cholerae strains. To enhance the expression of luxCDABE and
bioluminescence intensity, the promoter of the housekeeping gene mdh (malate dehydrogenase gene),
a highly transcribed gene (by transcriptome analysis, data not shown), from strain VC4251 was amplified
(primers are listed in Table 2). The amplicons were digested with KpnI and BamHI and cloned into
pXEN-luxCDABE (PerkinElmer) through the multiple cloning site, to generate the recombinant plasmid
pXEN-pmdh-luxCDABE. O1 strain VC1898, O139 strain VC4251, and all mutants generated from strain
VC4251 were transformed with the plasmid pXEN-pmdh-luxCDABE. These strains were plated on LB
(Luria-Bertani) agar plates containing ampicillin (100 �g/ml), and lux-expressing clones were selected
with the In-vivo FX Pro imaging system (Bruker) and were verified by sequencing.
Construction of mutants. The mshA mutant strain was constructed from strain VC4251 using a
homologous recombination method. We designed primers for a region upstream of the mshA gene
(mshA-1 and mshA-2) and introduced a XhoI endonuclease recognition site into the primer mshA-1.
Downstream primers (mshA-3 and mshA-4) were also designed, and a NotI endonuclease recognition site
was introduced into the primer mshA-4. The upstream and downstream DNA fragments flanking the
target sequences within mshA were amplified from VC4251 genomic DNA using the primer pairs
mshA-1/mshA-2 and mshA-3/mshA-4, respectively. Because portions of the primers mshA-2 and mshA-3
were complementary to one another, the upstream and downstream amplicons were mixed at equimolar
concentrations and used as the template to amplify the chromosomal fragment, excluding the target-

 deleted fragment, using the primer pair mshA-1/mshA-4. After digestion with XhoI and NotI, the resulting
fragment was cloned into the suicide plasmid, pWM91, containing a sacB counterselectable marker (60)
to generate the plasmid pWM91-ΔmshA. The resulting suicide plasmid was maintained in E. coli SM10
�pir and transformed to the strain VC4251 by conjugation. The transconjugants were selected on LB agar
plates containing streptomycin (100 �g/ml) and ampicillin (100 �g/ml), and the clones were streaked on
LB agar plates with 8% sucrose and without NaCl at 22°
C. After 48 h, double-crossover recombination
mutants were selected and verified by sequencing to generate the mutant strain, VC4251dmshA. The
gbpA, tcpA, and lacZ mutants were constructed using the same method described above. The primers
used in the mutant construction of these genes are listed in Table 2.
Construction of complementary strains. The complementation plasmids carrying mshA, gbpA, and
tcpA were constructed with plasmid pBAD24 (61). The open reading frames (ORFs) of mshA, gbpA, and
tcpA were amplified from VC4251 chromosomal DNA using the primer pairs mshC-F/mshC-R, gbpC-F/
gbpC-R, and tcpC-F/tcpC-R, respectively. After digestion with EcoRI and XbaI, the resulting fragments
were cloned downstream of the pBAD promoter in the plasmid pBAD24 (as a result, all transcriptions of
these genes were driven by the pBAD promoter), to generate the complementation plasmids pBADmshA,
pBADgbpA, and pBADtcpA, respectively, which were verified further by sequencing. Then, the mutant
strains VC4251dmshA, VC4251dgbpA, and VC4251dtcpA were transformed with the complementation
plasmids pBADmshA, pBADgbpA, and pBADtcpA, respectively, to generate the complementation strains
VC4251dmshA(pBADmshA), VC4251dgbpA(pBADgbpA), and VC4251dtcpA(VC4251dtcpA). Strain
VC4251dlacZ was transformed with the control plasmid pBAD24 to generate strain VC4251dlacZ
(pBAD).
Small intestine colonization competition assays in infant mice. VC4251dlacZ and mshA, gbpA,
and tcpA mutant strains were cultured overnight on LB agar plates at 37°
C. The colonies were scraped
and resuspended in 3 ml of PBS to an OD600 of 1.0 (the amount of each strain was measured by plate
counting), which was approximately equal to 109 CFU/ml. Approximately 105 cells of mshA, gbpA, and
tcpA mutants were mixed with VC4251dlacZ at a 1:1 ratio and were inoculated intragastrically into
5-day-old CD-1 infant mice. The mixtures were diluted for enumeration to calculate the input ratios
(mutant to wild type). After 24 h, the mice were euthanized and the small intestines were removed and
homogenized. Serial dilutions were made and plated on LB agar plates supplemented with polymyxin B
(5 �g/ml), streptomycin (100 �g/ml), and X-Gal ([5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-�-D-galactopyranoside] 50
�g/ml) for enumeration and calculation of the output ratios (mutant to wild type). Referring to the
colony counting method from the previous study (62), the lacZ mutant strain was also constructed from
strain VC4251. Because lacZ-positive V. cholerae strains (all colonization gene mutants, including
VC4251dmshA, VC4251dgbpA, and VC4251dtcpA) show blue colonies on LB agar plates in the presence
of X-Gal and lacZ-negative V. cholerae strain colonies are white, the colony numbers of different strains
for colonization competition assays can be calculated directly. The competitive index was calculated from
the output ratio and normalized against the input ratio. Three mice were used for each group of
competition assays.
Turtle body surface bioluminescence imaging assays. The bioluminescence-labeled serogroup O1
strain VC1898, serogroup O139 strain VC4251, and VC4251-derived mshA, gbpA, and tcpA mutants were

 cultured overnight on LB agar plates containing 100 �g/ml ampicillin at 37°
C. The colonies were scraped
and resuspended in 30 ml of PBS containing 100 �g/ml ampicillin to obtain an OD600 value of 1.0 (the
amount of each strain was measured by plate counting), which was approximately 109 CFU/ml. The
suspensions were diluted in 3 liters of PBS containing 100 �g/ml ampicillin. Soft-shelled turtles were
immersed in the bacterial suspension for 2 h for surface colonization. Each soft-shelled turtle was washed
twice with 2 liters of sterile PBS to remove cells that were not attached. The soft-shelled turtles were kept
in 3 liters of sterile PBS containing 100 �g/ml ampicillin at room temperature (28°
C). At 24, 48, 72, and
96 h postinfection, the soft-shelled turtles were washed and placed in fresh sterile PBS containing 100
�g/ml ampicillin. After administration of anesthesia, the soft-shelled turtles were analyzed for biolumi-
nescent bacteria with an In-vivo FX Pro imaging system. Bioluminescent signals were also detected
before infection as negative controls. After bioluminescence imaging, the surfaces of the soft-shelled
turtles were sampled with sterile cotton swabs for V. cholerae isolation. In these assays, five turtles were
immersed in the bacterial suspensions of the above five strains, and the tests were repeated three times
(15 turtles in total were used).
Body surface colonization competition assays. The mshA, gbpA, and tcpA mutants and
VC4251dlacZ were cultured overnight on LB agar plates at 37°
C, and the colonies were scraped and
resuspended in PBS to an OD600 of 1.0. VC4251dlacZ was mixed with the mshA, gbpA, and tcpA mutants
at a 1:1 ratio. The mixtures were diluted for enumeration to calculate the input ratios. Then, 30 ml of the
mixtures was diluted with 3 liters of PBS. The soft-shelled turtles were immersed in the bacterial
suspension for 2 h for surface infection; the turtles were separated into three groups to detect the three
gene mutants. Each soft-shelled turtle was washed twice with 2 liters of sterile PBS to remove cells that
were not attached. The dorsal carapace, calipash, and limbs of each turtle were sampled with sterile
cotton swabs. The swabs were washed with 300 �l of sterile PBS. Serial dilutions were made and plated
on LB agar plates supplemented with polymyxin B (5 �g/ml), streptomycin (100 �g/ml), and X-Gal (100
�g/ml) for enumeration and calculation of the output ratios (this detection time point was assigned as
day-0 time point). The soft-shelled turtles were then kept in 3 liters of sterile PBS at 28°
C. Every 24 h
postinfection, the soft-shelled turtles were washed, sampled, and placed in fresh sterile PBS. Bacterial
enumerations were performed as described above to calculate the output ratios. The detections were
continuously performed for 10 days (day-1 time point to day-10 time point). The competitive index was
calculated from the output ratio and normalized against the input ratio. Three soft-shelled turtles were
used for each group in the competition assays, and the assays were repeated three times.
In the competition assays using strain VC4251dlacZ(pBAD) and the complementation strains
VC4251dmshA(pBADmshA), VC4251dgbpA(pBADgbpA), and VC4251dtcpA(pBADtcpA), the LB agar
plates and PBS were supplemented with ampicillin and arabinose to final concentrations of 100 �g/ml
and 0.5%, respectively, to culture these strains. LB agar plates for the selective isolation of these strains
were supplemented with the following components: ampicillin (final concentration of 100 �g/ml),
polymyxin B (5 �g/ml), streptomycin (100 �g/ml), and X-Gal (50 �g/ml). Other procedures of the
competition assay with these strains were performed as described above.
Bioluminescence imaging assays of the internal organs. The bioluminescence-labeled serogroup
O1 strain VC1898, serogroup O139 strain VC4251, and VC4251-derived mshA, gbpA, and tcpA mutant
bioluminescent strains were cultured overnight on LB agar plates containing 100 �g/ml ampicillin at
37°
C. The next day, the strains were scraped and resuspended in 3 ml of PBS to obtain an OD600 of 1.0.
Soft-shelled turtles were anesthetized as described above. Next, 200-�l bacterial suspensions were
inoculated intragastrically into the soft-shelled turtles’stomachs. To ensure the entry of all bacterial
suspensions into the stomachs, polyethylene tubes that were at least 15 cm long were inserted into the
turtles’mouths. In the assays, six turtles were inoculated intragastrically with the above six strains, and
the assays were repeated three times (18 turtles in total were used).
The turtles were cultured in 3 liters of sterile PBS containing 100 �g/ml ampicillin at 28°
C. Every 24
h postinfection, the soft-shelled turtles were placed in new sterile PBS containing 100 �g/ml ampicillin.
At 72 h, the soft-shelled turtles were euthanized, and the internal organs (including the hearts, livers,
lungs, spleens, kidneys, and digestive tracts) were analyzed for bioluminescent bacteria. Bioluminescent
signals were also detected for the soft-shelled turtles inoculated with sterile PBS as negative controls. The
internal organs were homogenized with 5 ml of sterile PBS. Serial dilutions were made and plated on
selective LB agar plates supplemented with polymyxin B (5 �g/ml), streptomycin (100 �g/ml), and
ampicillin (100 �g/ml) for V. cholerae isolation.
Intestinal colonization competition assays. In the competition assays with the gene mutant
strains/VC4251dlacZ and complementary strains/VC4251dlacZ(pBAD), the strains were cultured over-
night on LB agar plates (100 �g/ml ampicillin was used when strains carrying plasmids were cultured)
at 37°
C. The next day, the colonies were scraped and resuspended in 3 ml of PBS to obtain an OD600 of
1.0. The paired strains used for the competition assays were mixed at approximately a 1:1 ratio. The
mixtures were diluted for enumeration to calculate the input ratios. Soft-shelled turtles were inoculated
with 200 �l of the bacterial suspensions and kept as described above. At 72 h, the soft-shelled turtles
were euthanized, the intestines were aseptically removed, and the intestinal tubes were washed with
sterile PBS three times to remove cells that were not attached and homogenized with 5 ml of sterile PBS.
Serial dilutions were made and plated on LB agar plates supplemented with the corresponding
antibiotics as above and X-Gal for enumeration of the corresponding strains and the calculation of
output ratios. The competitive index was calculated from the output ratio and normalized against the
input ratio. Three soft-shelled turtles were used for each competition strain pair in these colonization
competition assays, and the assays were repeated three times.
