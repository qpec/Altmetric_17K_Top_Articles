BACKGROUND
The survival benefit of a strategy of coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) added to 
guideline-directed medical therapy, as compared with medical therapy alone, in pa-
tients with coronary artery disease, heart failure, and severe left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction remains unclear.
METHODS
From July 2002 to May 2007, a total of 1212 patients with an ejection fraction of 35% 
or less and coronary artery disease amenable to CABG were randomly assigned to 
undergo CABG plus medical therapy (CABG group, 610 patients) or medical therapy 
alone (medical-therapy group, 602 patients). The primary outcome was death from any 
cause. Major secondary outcomes included death from cardiovascular causes and death 
from any cause or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes. The median duration of 
follow-up, including the current extended-follow-up study, was 9.8 years.
RESULTS
A primary outcome event occurred in 359 patients (58.9%) in the CABG group and in 
398 patients (66.1%) in the medical-therapy group (hazard ratio with CABG vs. medical 
therapy, 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.97; P 
= 
0.02 by log-rank test). A 
total of 247 patients (40.5%) in the CABG group and 297 patients (49.3%) in the 
medical-therapy group died from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 
0.66 to 0.93; P 
= 
0.006 by log-rank test). Death from any cause or hospitalization for 
cardiovascular causes occurred in 467 patients (76.6%) in the CABG group and in 524 
patients (87.0%) in the medical-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.82; 
P<0.001 by log-rank test).
CONCLUSIONS
In a cohort of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, the rates of death from any 
cause, death from cardiovascular causes, and death from any cause or hospitalization 
for cardiovascular causes were significantly lower over 10 years among patients who 
underwent CABG in addition to receiving medical therapy than among those who re-
ceived medical therapy alone. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; STICH [and

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A 
dvances in the management of 
cardiovascular risk factors and acute cor-
onary syndromes have increased survival 
among patients with coronary artery disease, 
transforming it into a chronic disease that affects 
15.5 million U.S. patients; however, coronary ar-
tery disease still accounts for more than 538,000 
deaths yearly in the United States alone.1 The 
major long-term manifestations of coronary ar-
tery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and 
heart failure are projected to affect 8 million 
patients by 2030, which has enormous societal 
implications.1
Landmark clinical trials have established cor-
onary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) as an effec-
tive treatment for patients with disabling angina 
symptoms.2-4 In these trials, CABG was associat-
ed with longer survival than was medical therapy 
alone among the subgroups with more extensive 
coronary artery disease and worse left ventricu-
lar dysfunction.5 However, the trials were con-
ducted more than 40 years ago, before the avail-
ability of current guideline-based medical therapy 
for coronary artery disease and heart failure,6,7 
and they did not include patients with severe left 
ventricular dysfunction; only 4% of participants 
had symptomatic heart failure.8 More recently, 
an increasing proportion of patients with heart 
failure and left ventricular dysfunction are re-
ferred for CABG.9
The Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart 
Failure (STICH) study consisted of two trials — 
a surgical revascularization component and a 
surgical ventricular reconstruction component. 
The surgical revascularization component was 
designed to test the hypothesis that CABG plus 
guideline-directed medical therapy for coronary 
artery disease, heart failure, and left ventricular 
dysfunction would improve survival over that 
with medical therapy alone. In the analysis of 
data from the surgical revascularization compo-
nent of the STICH study at a median follow-up 
of 56 months, there was no significant differ-
ence between the CABG group and the medical-
therapy group in the rate of death from any 
cause, although the rates of death from cardio-
vascular causes and of death from any cause or 
hospitalization for cardiovascular causes were 
lower among patients in the CABG group.10 We 
now report the results of the STICH Extension 
Study (STICHES), which was conducted to evalu-
ate the long-term (10-year) effects of CABG in 
patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Methods
Study Design
The design and enrollment characteristics of the 
STICH study have been published previously, as 
have the intermediate-term results of the surgi-
cal revascularization component and the final 
results of the surgical ventricular reconstruction 
component.10-13 The protocol (available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org) was ap-
proved by the principal investigator and by the 
ethics committee at each center. Before the 
treatment-group assignments were revealed or 
any intermediate-term results were reported, the 
protocol was amended to extend the follow-up 
period by an additional 5 years for all patients 
who were enrolled in the surgical revasculariza-
tion component of the study. The Duke Clinical 
Research Institute coordinated all aspects of 
global trial operations, site management and 
monitoring, data collection, statistical analyses, 
and reporting. All the authors assume responsi-
bility for the completeness and accuracy of the 
data and the analyses and for the fidelity of the 
trial to the protocol.
Patients
Patients were eligible for participation in the 
trial if they had coronary artery disease that was 
amenable to CABG and an ejection fraction of 
35% or lower. Detailed enrollment criteria, in-
cluding randomization strata criteria, have been 
published previously10 and are provided in Table 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org. Eligibility for participation was deter-
mined by site investigators after each patient 
underwent direct coronary angiography. Patients 
who did not have a left main coronary artery 
stenosis of 50% or more of the artery diameter 
or Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III or 
IV angina (with classes ranging from I to IV, and 
higher values indicating more disabling pain due 
to angina) while they were receiving medical 
therapy were eligible for random assignment to 
either the CABG group or the medical-therapy 
group. By design, in our trial, patients who met 
these criteria but did not meet the criteria for 
eligibility for surgical ventricular reconstruction 
(dominant anterior left ventricular akinesia or 
dyskinesia) were enrolled in stratum A, whereas 
patients who did meet the criteria for eligibility 
for surgical ventricular reconstruction were 
enrolled in stratum B; patients were included in

Coronary-Artery Bypass Surgery for Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
the current analysis only if they were assigned to 
CABG or medical therapy. All patients provided 
written informed consent.
Trial Procedures
At the initial evaluation, a baseline physical ex-
amination was performed, and baseline demo-
graphic and clinical data (including information 
regarding current medications and previous diag-
nostic and other cardiovascular procedures) were 
obtained. Random assignment to either CABG 
or medical therapy was accomplished with the 
use of an interactive voice-response system.
Throughout the trial follow-up period, the use 
of guideline-recommended medications and de-
vices for the treatment of heart failure and coro-
nary artery disease was strongly emphasized for 
all patients. Patients assigned to CABG were to 
undergo the procedure within 14 days after ran-
domization. CABG was performed by preapproved 
study surgeons who had provided documentation 
of an operative mortality of 5% or lower among 
patients whose risk of complications was similar 
to that of patients in our trial. During the enroll-
ment period, a surgical therapy committee mon-
itored the overall mortality and rates of compli-
cations associated with the CABG procedures.
All patients had follow-up evaluations at the 
time of discharge or at 30 days after randomiza-
tion, then every 4 months for the first year and 
every 6 months thereafter. During the extended 
follow-up period, if a patient was unwilling or 
unable to return to the enrolling center, follow-
up was maintained by the enrolling investigator 
through telephone contact or was transferred, 
for follow-up either in person or by telephone, to 
a lead regional investigator under the oversight 
of local ethics boards.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was death from any cause. 
The prespecified secondary outcomes included 
death from cardiovascular causes, death from 
any cause or hospitalization for cardiovascular 
causes, death from any cause or hospitalization 
for heart failure, death from any cause or hospi-
talization for any cause, and death from any 
cause or revascularization. The adjudication of 
the cause of death according to prespecified 
criteria was conducted by an independent clin-
ical-events committee, the members of which 
were unaware of the treatment assignments (see 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Statistical Analyses
The statistical methods used for comparative 
treatment analyses that included data from the 
extended follow-up period were similar to those 
used in the original STICH study.10 All major 
comparisons were performed according to the 
intention-to-treat principle — that is, treatment 
groups were defined according to the original 
randomization. Two-sided significance testing 
was used for all statistical tests. The cumulative 
event rates were calculated according to the 
Kaplan–Meier method,14 with event or censoring 
times calculated from the date of randomiza-
tion. The significance of the differences in 
outcomes between the treatment groups was 
assessed with the use of the log-rank test, with 
adjustment for randomization stratum (A or B, 
as described previously).10 Relative risks were 
expressed as hazard ratios with associated con-
fidence intervals and were calculated with the 
Cox proportional-hazards model.15 The consis-
tency of treatment effects across a number of 
prespecified subgroups, including those defined 
according to age, sex, race and ethnic back-
ground, geographic region, randomization stra-
tum, heart failure class, left ventricular ejection 
fraction, angina class, and number of diseased 
vessels, was examined by testing for interactions 
between treatment and these baseline character-
istics with the use of the Cox model. To assess 
the robustness of the log-rank results with 
crossing of hazard functions, post hoc analyses 
without an assumption of constant relative risks 
were also performed.16,17
To assess the effect of early crossovers be-
tween treatment groups (within the first year), 
secondary as-treated and per-protocol analyses 
were also performed. The as-treated compari-
son was performed with the use of a Cox model 
in which CABG was incorporated as a time-
dependent covariate.
The final clinical assessment for surviving 
patients was performed during the 6-month pe-
riod before November 30, 2015, which was the 
cutoff date for the extended follow-up. Patients 
who provided documentation declining further 
participation at any point were classified as hav-
ing withdrawn, whereas patients whose last con-
tact occurred before June 1, 2015, were classified 
as lost to follow-up.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Blood Institute met yearly to review the progress 
of the trial, ensure the safety of the participants, 
and assess the overall integrity of the follow-up 
data. Formal interim efficacy analyses were not 
planned during the extended follow-up period. 
For the final analysis, a P value of 0.05 or less 
was considered to indicate statistical signifi-
cance. All analyses were performed with the use 
of SAS software, version 9.3 or higher (SAS In-
stitute). The final statistical analysis plan was 
approved by the trial executive committee before 
the database lock (see the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Results
Study Population
Between July 24, 2002, and May 5, 2007, a total 
of 1212 patients across 99 sites in 22 countries 
were randomly assigned to receive CABG (610 
patients) or medical therapy (602 patients) (Table 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The charac-
teristics of the patients at baseline, including 
ventricular function and coronary anatomy, were 
similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Procedures
Among the 610 patients who were randomly as-
signed to the CABG group, 555 (91.0%) under-
went CABG before completion of the trial; the 
median time from randomization to CABG was 
10 days (interquartile range, 5 to 16), and the 
maximum was 177 days. Among the patients 
who were randomly assigned to the CABG group 
and underwent CABG, 505 (91.0%) received at 
least one arterial conduit, and 473 of the 553 
patients for whom data were available (85.5%) 
received one or more venous conduits. Addi-
tional details of the surgical procedures have 
been published previously.18
Among the 602 patients who were randomly 
assigned to the medical-therapy group, 119 
(19.8%) had CABG performed at any time before 
the completion of long-term follow-up; 66 pa-
tients (11.0%) underwent CABG within the first 
year of follow-up. The median time to CABG was 
6.9 months (interquartile range, 1.2 to 33.6). The 
indications for crossovers between the treatment 
groups within the first year have been published 
previously.19
The frequency of the use of guideline-direct-
ed medication was high at baseline and through-
out the study period. There were no significant 
differences between the treatment groups with 
regard to the frequency of the use of guideline-
directed medication at baseline (Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Follow-up
The median duration of follow-up among all 
patients was 9.8 years (interquartile range, 9.1 to 
11.0); the minimum was 3.5 years, and the 
maximum was 13.4 years. Details regarding 
follow-up are provided in Figure 1.
The final follow-up status was ascertained for 
1187 patients (97.9%) between June 1 and Novem-
ber 30, 2015. Among the 25 patients who could 
not be evaluated during the final follow-up peri-
od, 6 withdrew consent for further follow-up, and 
19 could not be located by site investigators. The 
median time from randomization to the date of 
last contact for patients who withdrew from the 
trial or were lost to follow-up was 6.4 years (in-
terquartile range, 5.9 to 8.1).
Outcomes
A primary outcome event (death from any cause) 
occurred in 359 of 610 patients (58.9%) in the 
CABG group and in 398 of 602 patients (66.1%) 
in the medical-therapy group (hazard ratio with 
CABG vs. medical therapy, 0.84; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.97; P 
= 
0.02 by log-rank 
test) (Table 2 and Fig. 2A, and Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The median survival 
was 7.73 years among patients in the CABG group 
and 6.29 years among patients in the medical-
therapy group; median survival was 1.44 years 
longer in the CABG group, and the number 
needed to treat to prevent one death was 14 pa-
tients (95% CI, 8 to 55). Post hoc analyses with-
out an assumption of constant relative risks 
showed significance similar to the values in the 
prespecified log-rank test.
A total of 247 patients (40.5%) in the CABG 
group and 297 (49.3%) in the medical-therapy 
group died from cardiovascular causes (hazard 
ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.93; P 
= 
0.006 by log-
rank test) (Table 2 and Fig. 2B). Death from any 
cause or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes 
occurred in 467 patients (76.6%) in the CABG 
group and in 524 (87.0%) patients in the medi-
cal-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 
0.64 to 0.82; P<0.001 by log-rank test) (Table 2 
and Fig. 2C). The results for other prespecified 
secondary outcomes and additional outcomes

Hazard ratios (CABG vs. medical therapy) are based on the Cox model, and the associated P values are based on the log-rank test. All as-
sessments were adjusted for patient stratum (A vs. B: patients who met the eligibility criteria for random assignment to the CABG group or 
medical-therapy group but did not meet the criteria for eligibility for surgical ventricular reconstruction were enrolled in stratum A; patients 
who did meet the criteria for eligibility for surgical ventricular reconstruction were enrolled in stratum B).
†  
The method of revascularization was either percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.

Coronary-Artery Bypass Surgery for Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
Analysis of Crossovers
Among the 591 patients who did not undergo 
CABG within 1 year (55 in the CABG group and 
536 in the medical-therapy group), 402 (68.0%) 
died during follow-up; among the 621 patients 
who underwent CABG either as randomly as-
signed or as a treatment crossover from the 
medical-therapy group within the first year after 
randomization, 355 (57.2%) died during follow-
up (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.87; 
P<0.001) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
We also performed a per-protocol analysis com-
paring the 536 patients in the medical-therapy 
group who did not cross over to CABG within 
the first year with the 555 patients in the CABG 
group who actually received CABG within the 
first year; the hazard ratio with CABG as com-
pared with medical therapy alone was 0.77 (95% 
CI, 0.67 to 0.90; P 
= 
0.001 by the log-rank test) 
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup analyses based on demographic and 
clinical characteristics of interest reflected the 
broad consistency of the effect of CABG on 
the primary outcome (Fig. 3). An exception was 
the nominally significant interactions of treat-
ment with randomization stratum, race, and 
number of diseased vessels with 75% or greater 
stenosis.
Discussion
In this randomized clinical trial involving pa-
tients with heart failure, left ventricular dysfunc-
tion, and coronary artery disease, the rate of 
death from any cause over 10 years was lower by 
16% (an 8-percentage-point absolute difference 
in the 10-year Kaplan–Meier rates) among pa-
tients who underwent CABG in addition to re-
ceiving medical therapy than among those who 
received medical therapy alone. Overall, CABG 
was associated with an incremental median sur-
vival benefit of nearly 18 months and prevention 
of one death due to any cause for every 14 pa-
tients treated and of one death due to a cardio-
vascular cause for every 11 patients treated.
CABG was associated with more favorable 
results than medical therapy alone across all 
clinically relevant long-term outcomes we evalu-
ated. These findings were directionally similar 
to those reported earlier on the basis of a me-
dian follow-up period of 56 months.10 We believe

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
that the further statistical separation between 
the groups that we now report resulted from a 
persistent and perhaps increasing effect size over 
time, coupled with the enhanced precision of es-
timates afforded by the greater number of events. 
We previously reported that CABG was associated 
with a risk of death within the initial 30 days 
after randomization that was triple the risk with 
medical therapy alone, with similar differences in 
risk up to the second year of follow-up, before a 
significant benefit began to accrue after 2 years. 
Thus, it appears that the operative risk associ-
ated with CABG is offset by a durable effect that 
translates into increasing clinical benefit to at 
least 10 years. The lack of convergence of the 
curves over this prolonged period of follow-up 
contrasts with other long-term follow-up studies 
involving patients with heart failure and severe 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction and under-
scores the lasting benefits of CABG.20,21 Further-
more, the analyses of the as-treated and per-
protocol populations suggest that crossovers 
between the treatment groups diminished the 
effect of CABG observed when the data were 
analyzed according to the assigned group and 
that the mortality associated with CABG may be 
as much as 20 to 25% lower than that associated 
with medical therapy, under the assumption that 
the surgical mortality in routine clinical practice 
is similar to or lower than that reported in our 
trial.
Substantial declines in risk-adjusted mortality 
associated with CABG have occurred since the 
1970s, when the landmark trials comparing 
CABG and medical therapy were performed. Im-
provements in myocardial protection techniques, 
surgical skill, and perioperative care, coupled 
with the near-universal use of the left internal 
mammary artery (LIMA) conduit are probably 
responsible. Among the patients randomly as-
signed to undergo CABG, 91.0% of patients in 
STICH received a LIMA graft, as compared with 
9.9% of patients in the early CABG trials.8 Al-
though there are limited data on the long-term 
patency of LIMA or saphenous vein grafts in pa-
tients at high risk for death or complications, 
like those enrolled in STICH, evidence from 
studies involving lower-risk patients supports 
the superior 1-year angiographic results with the 
LIMA.22 In addition, the high rate of use of 
statins, which have been shown to reduce the 
rate of vein-graft failure,23,24 is likely to have 
contributed to the durable effect of CABG and 
the low rates of repeat revascularization ob-
served in this group.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy remains a high-risk 
and lethal condition, as indicated by an observed 
overall mortality of 62.5% with a median follow-
up of 9.8 years, even on the background of 
guideline-directed medical therapy. Patients with 
heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction 
have abnormalities of coronary hemodynamics 
and myocardial energetics during rest, including 
an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption 
and altered myocardial lactate metabolism, even 
in the absence of epicardial coronary artery dis-
ease.25,26 Coronary disease compounds the already 
unfavorable myocardial conditions and limited 
cardiac reserve in these patients. The significant 
subgroup interaction we noted between treat-
ment and the extent of coronary artery disease is 
consistent with previous analyses involving this 
trial population, which indicated a greater benefit 
of CABG in patients with three-vessel coronary 
artery disease than among patients with one-
vessel or two-vessel disease27; it is also consistent 
with observations in studies involving cohorts of 
lower-risk patients with coronary artery disease 
who were treated before the current advances in 
Figure 3 (facing page). Subgroup Analyses of Death 
from Any Cause.
Age, sex, race, region, New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) heart failure class, left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF), stratum, Canadian Cardiovascular 
 
Society (CCS) angina class, and number of diseased 
vessels are prespecified subgroup factors. All other 
variables are post hoc subgroup factors. All subgroups 
are based on values measured at baseline. Data on 
ESVI were missing for 97 patients, data on the number 
of vessels with 75% or greater stenosis and on the de-
gree of stenosis of the left main coronary artery (LM) 
and proximal left anterior descending artery (PLAD) 
were missing for 1 patient, and data on mitral regurgi-
tation were missing for 3 patients. The Canadian Car-
diovascular Society (CCS) angina classes range from I to 
IV, with higher classes indicating more disabling pain 
due to angina. New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
heart failure classes range from I to IV, with higher values 
indicating greater disability. The divisions between the 
LVEF and the end-systolic volume index subgroups were 
based on the median values. Patients who met the eli-
gibility criteria for random assignment to the CABG 
group or medical-therapy group but did not meet the 
criteria for eligibility for surgical ventricular reconstruc-
tion were enrolled in stratum A; patients who did meet 
the criteria for eligibility for surgical ventricular recon-
struction were enrolled in stratum B.

By design, in this trial, both the enrolled pa-
tients and the site investigators were aware of 
the treatment-group assignments, and this lack 
of blinding may have affected the rates of revas-
cularization procedures. We acknowledge this as 
a limitation of our trial, especially as it relates to 
the interpretation of nonfatal events. Unmeasured 
confounding owing to differences in subsequent 
care cannot be ruled out; however, we found 
high and similar rates of medical therapy and 
follow-up in both groups. It is not known

plus medical therapy over medical therapy alone 
with respect to the rate of death from any cause 
among patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
