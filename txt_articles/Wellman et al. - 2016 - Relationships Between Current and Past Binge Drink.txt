Purpose: Heavy episodic (i.e., “binge”) drinking (i.e., �five drinks/occasion) is highly prevalent
among young adults; those who binge do so four times per month on average, consuming nine
drinks on average on each occasion. Although it is well established that chronic heavy drinking
(�two alcoholic beverages per day) increases the risk of hypertension, the relationship between
binge drinking and blood pressure is not well described. Our aim was to describe the relationship
between frequency of binge drinking, both current (at age 24 years) and past (at age 20 years), and
systolic blood pressure (SBP) at age 24 years.
Methods: Participants (n ¼ 756) from the longitudinal Nicotine Dependence in Teens study reported
alcohol consumption at ages 20 and 24 years and had SBP measured at age 24 years. We examined the
association between binge drinking and SBP using multiple linear regression, controlling for sex, race/
ethnicity, education, monthly drinking in high school, cigarette smoking, and body mass index.
Results: Compared to nonbinge drinkers, SBP at age 24 years was 2.61 [.41, 4.82] mm Hg higher
among current monthly bingers and 4.03 [1.35, 6.70] mm Hg higher among current weekly bingers.
SBP at age 24 years was 2.90 [.54, 5.25] mm Hg higher among monthly bingers at age 20 years and
3.64 [.93, 6.35] mm Hg higher among weekly bingers at age 20 years, compared to nonbinge drinkers.
Conclusions: Frequent binge drinking at ages 20 and 24 years is associated with higher SBP at age
24 years and may be implicated in the development of hypertension.

IMPLICATIONS AND
CONTRIBUTION
Little is known about the
relationship
between
binge drinking and blood
pressure
(BP)
in
young
adults. This study showed
that frequency of binge
drinking, past and present,
is associated with higher
systolic
BP,
which
may
pose a risk for developing
hypertension.
Practi-
tioners
should
inquire
about
binge
drinking
when monitoring BP.
Numerous reports [1e3] suggest that alcohol consumption is
associated with higher blood pressure (BP) and furthermore, that
moderate to heavy drinking raises the risk of essential hyperten-
sion [4e6]. In cross-sectional analyses of CARDIA data for >5,000
US adults age 18e30 years, mean systolic BP (SBP) was directly
associated with daily alcohol intake in white and black males and in
white females [7]. Similarly, cross-sectional data for >14,000 adults
(median age 29 years) participating in the 2008 wave of the Na-
tional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health showed that
consuming two drinks (females) or three drinks (males) on
5e7 days per week was associated with a 5.3 mm Hg increase in
SBP. Heavier drinking (i.e., >two drinks (females) or >three drinks
(males) on 5e7 days per week) was associated with a 4.5 mm Hg

 increase in SBP after controlling for body mass index (BMI) and
smoking [8].
Variability in daily alcohol intake has rarely been investigated
as a risk factor for high BP. INTERSALT, an international multi-
center epidemiological study of 9,681 men and women, age
20e59 years, investigated the separate influence on BP of overall
alcohol consumption and daily variability in consumption [9].
Overall, daily alcohol consumption was related to SBP. Compared
to nondrinkers, SBP was 4.6 mm Hg higher among men who
consumed 6e7 drinks per day and 3.9 mm Hg higher among
women who consumed 3e4 drinks per day. SBP also tended to be
higher than in nondrinkers among men and women who drank
fewer than three drinks per day, but the differences were not
statistically significant. Variability in daily drinking was inde-
pendently associated with higher SBP. Compared to nondrinkers,
SBP was 4.5 mm Hg higher among men whose daily alcohol
consumption was episodic and highly variable and who drank
3e4 drinks per day, on average and 2.2 mm Hg higher among
men who drank fewer than three drinks per day, on average, after
controlling for age, BMI, and smoking [9].
Binge drinking (i.e., consuming �five alcoholic beverages on a
single occasion [10]) is associated with highly variable patterns
of daily consumption and may be linked, over and above chronic
heavy drinking, to higher BP. In a cross-sectional study of 14,000
adults age 45e69 years in Eastern Europe, compared to those
who did not binge and those who binged (i.e., �seven drinks for
men and �four drinks for women in one session) less than once/
month, men who binged at least once a month had a 62% greater
likelihood and women a 31% greater likelihood of having hy-
pertension (systolic > 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic > 90 mm Hg)
[11]. This effect was independent of annual alcohol intake.
Many young adults binge drink. Past-year prevalence esti-
mates for 18e19 year olds were 31% in the United States [10] and
43% in Canada [12], whereas estimates for 20e24 year olds were
45% in the United States [10] and 32% in Canada [12]. Of partic-
ular concern is that 18- to 24-year-old binge drinkers report 4.2
binge drinking episodes per month on average, and they
consume 9.3 drinks (approximately 126g of pure ethanol [13]) on
average per binge drinking occasion [14].
Although many studies explore the association between
alcohol and chronic disease, the biological pathways leading
from alcohol consumption to the early origins of chronic disease
are not well understood. Given the dearth of studies investi-
gating binge drinking as a risk factor for elevated BP and hy-
pertension in young adults, our aim was to determine if current
or past binge drinking is associated with SBP in a sample of
young adults. We examined this objective in both cross-sectional
and longitudinal analyses to broaden our understanding of the
possible relationship between binge drinking and the develop-
ment of hypertension.
Methods
Data were drawn from the prospective longitudinal Nicotine
Dependence in Teens (NDIT) study conducted in Montréal, Can-
ada [15]. A cohort of 1,294 students in grade 7, recruited in 1999
from 10 secondary schools, completed a self-report question-
naire at school every three months for a total of 20 surveys over
the five years of secondary school (1999e2005). Schools were
selected to include students from urban, suburban, and rural
areas; from high, moderate and low socioeconomic status fam-
ilies; and who spoke either French and/or English. In two
additional postsecondary school surveys, questionnaires were
mailed to participants’ homes in 2007e2008, when they were
age 20 years on average; in 2011e2012 (age 24 years on average)
questionnaires were completed and anthropometric and BP
measurements were taken in the NDIT offices. Parents provided
consent and participants provided assent during the secondary
school cycles; participants provided consent in the post-
secondary school surveys. The NDIT project was approved by the
ethics research committee of the Centre de Recherche du Centre
Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal.
Characteristics of NDIT participants at baseline resembled
those of a provincially representative sample of youth aged
13 years from the Quebec Child and Adolescent Health and Social
Survey [15]. Between baseline (grade 7) and the final survey cycle
in high school, 85 of the 1,294 baseline NDIT participants were
lost to follow-up. An additional 130 participants refused follow-
up after the first postsecondary school cycle (at age 20 years)
[15, Table 2]. The second postsecondary cycle (at age 24 years)
was completed by 858 participants (79.5% of the 1,079 who
remained eligible to participate at age 24 years); 781 of 858
provided BP measures [15; Table 2].
For the current analysis, we identified individuals whose SBP
was measured at age 24 years and who provided data on the
frequency with which they drank alcoholic beverages in the year
preceding the measurement of BP (the “cross-sectional” analysis,
so labeled because data on alcohol consumption and BP were
collected at the same point in time). Most of those participants
had also provided data on their alcohol consumption in the year
preceding the survey at age 20 years (the “longitudinal” analysis,
so labeled because frequency of alcohol consumption was
measured four years before the BP measurements were taken).
Study variables
We chose SBP as the outcome measure because it is a
stronger predictor of cardiovascular risk and leads to more ac-
curate diagnosis and staging of hypertension than diastolic BP
[16,17]. It has been suggested as the primary target of antihy-
pertensive treatment [18]. SBP was assessed at age 24 years by
trained technicians using standardized methods [19]. After the
participant had voided and rested for 5 minutes, BP was
assessed in the sitting position, on the right arm with the arm
resting at heart height on a table, with an oscillometric device
(Dinamap XL, model CR9340, Critikon Co, Tampa, FL). Cuff size
(Brassard Baumanomètre) was determined by arm circumfer-
ence: 16.0e22.5 cm, size 9 (adolescent), 22.6e30.0 cm, size 12
(adult), 30.1e37.5 cm, size 15 (large adult), 37.6e43.7 cm, size
17.5 (thigh). Oscillometric devices were calibrated against a
mercury

collection
period. Three consecutive measures were obtained at 1-minute
intervals. If the difference between the second and third read-
ings exceeded 20 mm Hg, then fourth and fifth readings were
taken. To reduce BP reactivity or habituation, the first reading
was not considered [20]. We calculated the mean of the two
closest remaining readings.
We assessed alcohol consumption at age 20 years (labeled
herein as “past drinking”) and at age 24 years (labeled herein as
“current drinking”) with two questions: “During the past
12 months, how often did you drink alcoholic beverages?” and
“During the past 12 months, how often did you drink 5 or more
alcoholic beverages on one occasion?” Response options were
never, <once a month, 1e3 times per month, 1e6 times per

 week, every day. The wording of the binge drinking question is
similar to that used in the Canadian Addiction Survey ([12], p.21).
Nondrinkers were defined as those who answered never to both
questions, and nonbingers were defined as those who answered
never to �5 drinks per occasion but reported any frequency of
drinking alcohol.
Covariates. The likelihood of engaging in binge drinking differs
by sex, race/ethnicity, and level of education [14], and the risk of
developing
hypertension
differs
by
socioeconomic
status
[21e24].
We,
therefore,
included
self-reported
sex,
race/
ethnicity, and level of education as covariates, with education
serving as a proxy for socioeconomic status.
In a previous NDIT study, drinking alcoholic beverages at least
once per month in three or more years during high school pre-
dicted the likelihood of sustaining binge drinking between age
20 and 24 years [25]. Alcohol consumption was assessed in each
of the 20 survey cycles during high school with the question
“During the past three months, how often did you drink alcohol
(beer, wine, hard liquor)?” Response options were never, a bit to
try, once or a couple of times a month, once or a couple of times a
week, usually every day. We calculated the number of grades
(0e5) in which a participant reported drinking at least once per
month in any survey cycle. This was our measure of monthly
drinking in high school.
Cigarette smoking is associated with higher SBP [26] in young
adults [8] and adolescents [27]. We assessed smoking at age 24
years with two questions: “Have you ever in your life smoked a
cigarette, even just a puff (drag, hit, haul)?” Ever smokers
were asked “Did you smoke cigarettes, even just a puff, in the
past three months?” Never smokers and ever smokers who had
not smoked in the past three months were classified as non-
smokers, whereas past-three-month smokers were classified
as smokers.
BMI is strongly associated with SBP [28]. Weight in kilograms
and height in meters were measured at age 24 years by trained
technicians using a standardized protocol [29]. We recorded two
measures to the nearest .2 kg for weight and .1 cm for height. If
they differed by >.2 kg or .5 cm, a third measure was taken, and
the average of the two closest measures was recorded. Inter-rater
reliabilities (split-half coefficients) computed using repeat mea-
sures for one in 10 participants were .99 for both weight and
height [30]. BMI was calculated according to the standard for-
mula, weight (kg)/height2 (m).
Statistical analyses
We used t-tests, chi-square tests, and analyses of variance
with Scheffé post hoc tests to examine bivariate relationships
between SBP, frequency of current and past binge drinking, and
the covariates. We then used multivariate linear regression an-
alyses controlling for sex, racial/ethnic background, education,
monthly drinking in high school, cigarette consumption, and
BMI; variables were entered simultaneously. Possible multi-
collinearity between covariates was assessed with values of the
variance inflation factor (VIF) >2.5 [31]. Following Stevens’ rec-
ommendations [32], we identified potential outliers and influ-
ential data points with three measures: (1) Weisberg’s t for the
studentized residual [33] >3.92 (the critical value for p < .05
with 11 predictors and n ¼ 500); (2) centered leverage scores (hii)
greater than twice the mean; and (3) Cook’s distance [34] >1
[32]. Statistical analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS version
22 (released 2013, SPSS Statistics for Windows; IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY).
Results
The analytic sample included 756 NDIT participants who had
their SBP measured and provided data on their past-year alcohol
consumption at age 24 years. Compared to the 538 NDIT par-
ticipants not retained in the analyses, those retained were more
likely to be female and less likely to have ever smoked a ciga-
rette; they also reported having consumed fewer cigarettes in the
three months preceding the survey. Their SBP and diastolic blood
pressure were lower. There were no differences in race/ethnicity,
parents’ education, alcohol use, or BMI (Table 1). Data on past
(age 20 years) alcohol consumption were missing for 65 partic-
ipants. They did not differ from the 691 participants who pro-
vided data on SBP, current (age 24 years) alcohol consumption,
sex, education, high school drinking, current smoking status, or
BMI. However, they were more likely to be Caucasian (92.3% vs.
81.9%) than non-Caucasian (c2 (1) ¼ 4.49, p ¼ .03).
Mean age was 24 years (standard deviation [SD] ¼ .7, range:
22.2e27.8); 54.6% of participants were female. Most participants
were Caucasian (82.8%), followed by Asian (6.3%), mixed/other
(4.2%), black (3.4%), Arab (1.9%), and Latin American (1.5%). About
half (54.2%) of participants had some college or university
education, 33.6% had attended or completed technical school or
junior college, and 12.2% had a high school education. Mean SBP
was 108.4 (SD ¼ 11.5, range: 81e149.5) mm Hg.
Table 2 presents the results of the bivariate analyses. Among
current weekly binge drinkers, mean SBP was 6.5 [3.8, 9.2] mm
Hg higher than among nondrinkers, 8.2 [6.3, 10.1] mm Hg higher
than among nonbingers, and 6.7 [5.2, 8.2] mm Hg higher than
among less than monthly bingers. Additionally, among current
monthly bingers, mean SBP was 4.6 [2.7, 6.5] mm Hg higher than
among nonbingers. Current monthly and weekly binge drinkers
were more likely to meet the current criterion for a diagnosis of
prehypertension (i.e., SBP > 120) [35] than were nondrinkers and
nonbingers. Mean SBP in males was 11.3 [9.8,12.7] mm Hg higher
than in females. Compared to participants whose BMI was < 25,
mean SBP was 6.1 [5.1, 7.0] mm Hg higher among those whose
BMI was 25e29.9 and 4.8 [3.9, 5.8] mm Hg higher among those
whose BMI was � 30.
In the cross-sectional multivariate model that used current
binge drinking as the exposure (Table 3), SBP was 2.6 mm Hg

compared to nonbingers. VIF values were all �2.1, indicating no
multicollinearity. Eighteen cases had high leverage scores.
However, the maximum Cook’s distance was .03, so all cases
were retained in the analysis.
In the bivariate analysis of past (age 20 years) binge drinking
(Table 2), mean SBP among weekly binge drinkers was 5.0 [2.0,
8.0] mm Hg higher than among nondrinkers and 6.0 [4.1, 7.9] mm
Hg higher than among nonbingers; among monthly binge
drinkers mean SBP was 4.6 [2.7, 6.5] mm Hg higher than among
nonbingers. More monthly and weekly binge drinkers than
nonbingers met the criterion for a diagnosis of prehypertension.
In the longitudinal multivariate model that used past (age 20
years) binge drinking as the exposure (Table 4), SBP was almost
3 mm Hg higher among monthly bingers at age 20 years and
3.6 mm Hg higher among weekly bingers compared to non-
bingers. VIF values were all <2.3, indicating no multicollinearity.
Nine cases had high leverage scores. However, the maximum
Cook’s distance was .03, so all cases were retained in the analysis.
In a secondary analysis, we compared participants who re-
ported past and current binge drinking (i.e., at age 20 and 24 years
(n ¼ 458)) with those who binged at age 20 years only (n ¼ 64).
Mean SBP was 109.5 (SD ¼ 11.5) among those who binged at both
ages, compared to 105.2 (SD ¼ 11.6) among those who did not
[t(520) ¼ 2.79, p ¼ .005]. However, this difference was not statis-
tically significant after controlling for covariates (regression
coefficient ¼ 2.50 [�.23, 5.23], p ¼ .07), which may relate to a lack
of statistical power because very few binge drinkers reported
binge drinking at age 20 years only.
Discussion
In this study, we showed that frequency of binge drinking
(whether current or past) is associated with higher SBP. These
results concur with findings from the CARDIA study [7],
the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [8], and

 the HAPIEE study [11], all of which found that the intensity
of current drinking was associated with higher BP. Our study
adds to these other studies by investigating both current and
past drinking and by focusing specifically on binge drinking in
young adults.
We previously reported that 85% of NDIT participants who
binged at age 20 years sustained that behavior until at least age
24 years [25]. Although binge and heavy drinking generally
decrease with age [10,12], a review of six longitudinal studies
conducted in the United States, Britain, and Finland found that
drinking patterns in early adulthood were strong predictors of
both frequency of alcohol use and problem drinking at ages 30
and 48 years [36]. If binge drinking is indeed associated with SBP,
young adulthood may represent a critical period in the life course
for the prevention of hypertension because drinking patterns are
modifiable. Future research should examine the association be-
tween binge drinking and SBP in adolescence to determine how
early in life the association is established.
As a speculative exercise, we estimated the potential increase
in SBP associated with binge drinking from age 20 to 24 years by
dividing the differences in SBP between frequent (monthly and
weekly) binge drinkers and nonbingers by four years. Compared
to drinking alcohol without binging, binging at least once per
month at age 20 years might be associated with an increase of
approximately .75 mm Hg per year and binging at least once per
week with an increase of approximately .90 mm Hg per year by
age 24 years. The plausibility of this hypothesis is strengthened
by our finding of a 4 mm Hg difference (unadjusted for cova-
riates) in SBP after four years among those who binged at age 20
and 24 years relative to those who binged at age 20 years only. If
participants continued to binge at similar frequencies, and if the
effects of binging were cumulative, their SBP could increase
another 7.5e9 mm Hg in the next 10 years, which could place
many at risk of hypertension. This speculation is further rein-
forced by the significantly greater proportions of monthly and
weekly past and current binge drinkers who qualified for a
diagnosis of prehypertension compared to nonbinge drinkers.
Because we measured SBP only once, we cannot determine the
extent to which SBP changes over time. Future research should
follow young adults with more frequent measurement of SBP
and drinking to study whether binge drinkers develop hyper-
tension more quickly than nondrinkers and nonbingers.
Limitations
Limitations of this study include that self-reports of alcohol
consumption may have resulted in misclassification. Definitions
of binge drinking differ. Although the US Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Association defines binge drinking as “consuming
five or more alcoholic drinks on the same occasion on at least one
day in the past 30 days,” the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse
and Alcoholism provides a specific blood alcohol concentration
(i.e., �.08 gram-percent) achieved within a specific time frame
for a drinking occasion (i.e., about two hours) and a different
amount for men (five drinks) and women (four drinks) [37].
Because our definition of binge drinking was similar to that used
by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Association, we may have
underestimated the number of binge drinkers, particularly
among females, in our sample. In addition, participants could
have consumed up to four drinks (56g ethanol) per occasion
frequently and be classified as nonbingers. Residual confounding
may be an issue because it is possible that unknown or
unmeasured confounders of the association of interest were not
taken into account. Finally, we could not assess whether a cu-
mulative dose of alcohol over time (e.g., two drinks per day for
one week) has the same effect on SBP as consuming an equiva-
lent amount of alcohol in high doses on one or more single oc-
casions (e.g., seven drinks on each of 2 days). Specifically, is it the
cumulative dose over time that results in higher risk or is a high
dose of alcohol on a single occasion riskier in terms of SBP?
If our findings are replicated, it might be that frequency of
binge drinking in young adults is associated with the develop-
ment of hypertension. More than one-fifth of monthly binge
drinkers and almost one-quarter of weekly binge drinkers in our
sample met the criterion for a diagnosis of prehypertension, a
condition that frequently progresses to hypertension [38]. Most
hypertension screening and treatment guidelines are based on
studies conducted in middle-aged and older populations. Above
normal BP in young adult men is significantly related to
increased all-cause coronary heart and cardiovascular disease
[39], whereas isolated systolic hypertension (i.e., SBP > 140 with
diastolic BP < 90) in young and middle adulthood increases the
31-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease and of death
from coronary heart disease [40]. Because drinking patterns are
modifiable, our findings may eventually have implications for
clinical and preventive interventions. Health care practitioners
who monitor BP in young adults should inquire about binge
drinking, especially when elevated BP is found and counsel pa-
tients that binging is associated with increased SBP. From a
public health perspective, although the dangers of binging in
terms of intoxication, driving, safety, and addiction are well
known, higher SBP may need to be added as a possible conse-
quence of binge drinking in public health campaigns.
