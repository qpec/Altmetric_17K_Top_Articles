BACKGROUND
Robust data on patient-reported outcome measures comparing treatments for clini-
cally localized prostate cancer are lacking. We investigated the effects of active moni-
toring, radical prostatectomy, and radical radiotherapy with hormones on patient-
reported outcomes.
METHODS
We compared patient-reported outcomes among 1643 men in the Prostate Testing 
for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial who completed questionnaires before diag-
nosis, at 6 and 12 months after randomization, and annually thereafter. Patients 
completed validated measures that assessed urinary, bowel, and sexual function and 
specific effects on quality of life, anxiety and depression, and general health. Cancer-
related quality of life was assessed at 5 years. Complete 6-year data were analyzed 
according to the intention-to-treat principle.
RESULTS
The rate of questionnaire completion during follow-up was higher than 85% for most 
measures. Of the three treatments, prostatectomy had the greatest negative effect on 
sexual function and urinary continence, and although there was some recovery, these 
outcomes remained worse in the prostatectomy group than in the other groups 
throughout the trial. The negative effect of radiotherapy on sexual function was great-
est at 6 months, but sexual function then recovered somewhat and was stable there-
after; radiotherapy had little effect on urinary continence. Sexual and urinary function 
declined gradually in the active-monitoring group. Bowel function was worse in the 
radiotherapy group at 6 months than in the other groups but then recovered some-
what, except for the increasing frequency of bloody stools; bowel function was un-
changed in the other groups. Urinary voiding and nocturia were worse in the radio-
therapy group at 6 months but then mostly recovered and were similar to the other 
groups after 12 months. Effects on quality of life mirrored the reported changes in 
function. No significant differences were observed among the groups in measures 
of anxiety, depression, or general health-related or cancer-related quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS
In this analysis of patient-reported outcomes after treatment for localized prostate 
cancer, patterns of severity, recovery, and decline in urinary, bowel, and sexual func-
tion and associated quality of life differed among the three groups. (Funded by the

A 
s reported in a companion article 
in the Journal, the U.K. National Institute 
for Health Research–supported Prostate 
Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial 
has shown no significant difference in prostate-
cancer–specific mortality or all-cause mortality 
among men with prostate cancer detected by 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing who were 
randomly assigned to radical prostatectomy, ac-
tive monitoring (a surveillance strategy), or radi-
cal conformal radiotherapy with neoadjuvant 
hormonal therapy, at a median of 10 years of 
follow-up; however, the ProtecT trial has shown 
higher rates of metastases and disease progres-
sion among men in the active-monitoring group 
than among men in the radical-treatment groups.1 
In this article, we focus on the prospective assess-
ments by the participants of the effects of treat-
ments on urinary, sexual, and bowel function and 
specific and general aspects of quality of life; 
validated measures were completed regularly by 
the participants to assess these outcomes.
Systematic reviews2-5 and studies involving 
large, prospective cohorts6,7 have shown particu-
lar effects on urinary, bowel, and sexual function 
and little effect on general quality of life after 
radical treatments, but clear comparisons among 
contemporary treatments have been hindered by 
differences in outcome definitions, limited use 
of validated outcome measures, mostly short-term 
follow-up, and sparse data on radiotherapy or 
active surveillance programs.8 Randomized clin-
ical trials have not included the full range of 
validated patient-reported outcome measures. 
Using a questionnaire specific to the study, the 
investigators in the Scandinavian Prostate Can-
cer Group-4 (SPCG-4) trial showed that prosta-
tectomy had a greater effect on sexual and uri-
nary function and quality of life than did watchful 
waiting among men who had clinically identi-
fied prostate cancer.9,10 Using three single symp-
toms items, the investigators in the Prostate Can-
cer Intervention versus Observation Trial (PIVOT) 
reported worse urinary incontinence and erectile 
dysfunction after prostatectomy than after ob-
servation, and similar bowel function, among 
men with PSA-detected prostate cancer.11 Here 
we present a comprehensive set of patient-report-
ed outcomes from the ProtecT trial over 6 years of 
follow-up.
Methods
ProtecT Trial Participants
Details of the recruitment methods of the ProtecT 
trial and the baseline data have been published 
previously (see also Table S1A in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix, available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org).12 In brief, after population-
based PSA testing and standardized diagnostic 
procedures had been performed between 1999 
and 2009, a total of 2896 men received a diagno-
sis of prostate cancer, including 2664 men with 
clinically localized disease. A total of 1643 of 
these men (62%) underwent randomization; 545 
were assigned to active monitoring (regular PSA 
testing with clinical review to enable change to 
radical treatment if disease progressed), 553 to 
radical prostatectomy (most of the operations in-
volved an open retropubic, nerve-sparing approach), 
and 545 to radiotherapy (external-beam three-
dimensional conformal radiotherapy delivered at 
a total dose of 74 Gy in 37 fractions, along with 
neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy). The 
prespecified primary outcome was prostate-can-
cer mortality at a median of 10 years of follow-up, 
with prostate-cancer–related deaths defined as 
deaths that were definitely or probably due to pros-
tate cancer or its treatment.13
Trial Design and Oversight
The authors vouch for the accuracy and complete-
ness of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of 
the study to the protocol, available at NEJM.org. 
The ProtecT trial was approved by the East Mid-
lands (formerly Trent) Multicenter Research Eth-
ics Committee in the United Kingdom (reference 
number 01/4/025). The ProtecT trial followed the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting of Trials 
(CONSORT) guidelines for patient-reported out-
comes.14
Patient-Reported Outcome Measures
Patient-reported outcomes were prespecified sec-
ondary outcomes that were assessed with the use 
of validated measures in four key domains15 (Ta-
ble 1). Domain A comprised urinary function, in-
cluding urinary incontinence and lower urinary 
tract symptoms, and the effect of urinary func-
tion on quality of life; outcomes were assessed 
with the use of the International Consultation

Patient-Reported Outcomes in Prostate Cancer
on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ),16 the Ex-
panded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) 
instrument,17 and the International Continence 
Society Male Short-Form (ICSmaleSF) question-
naire.18 Domain B comprised sexual function, 
including erectile function, and the effect of 
sexual function on quality of life; outcomes were 
assessed with the use of the EPIC instrument.17 
Domain C comprised bowel function, including 
the occurrence of loose and bloody stools and 
incontinence, and the effect of bowel function 
on quality of life; outcomes were assessed with 
the use of the EPIC instrument.17 Domain D 
comprised measures of health-related quality of 
life, which included general health status (as as-
sessed with the use of the Medical Outcomes 
Study 12-Item Short-Form General Health Survey 
[SF-12]19), anxiety and depression (as assessed 
with the use of the Hospital Anxiety and Depres-
sion Scale [HADS]),20 and cancer-related quality 
of life (as assessed with the use of the European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire–Core 30 
module (EORTC QLQ-C30).21
Study questionnaires were completed at base-
line (i.e., at the time of biopsy, before the diag-
nosis was known), at 6 and 12 months after 
randomization, and annually thereafter. The 
ICSmaleSF questionnaire, the SF-12, and the HADS 
were included in the study during the entire course 
of the ProtecT trial; the ICIQ was included starting 
in 2001, and the EPIC instrument was included 
starting in 2005. Because the EORTC QLQ-C30 
concerns cancer-related quality of life, this ques-
tionnaire was included at year 5 only. Patient-
reported outcome measures were scored and ana-
lyzed as recommended by the authors of the 
assessments, with key items identified to aid in 
the interpretation of clinical relevance (Table 1). 
Men received therapies as required for side effects 
of treatments in accordance with guidelines,22-25 
and their questionnaire responses include influ-
ences of the effects of these therapies.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed according to the inten-
tion-to-treat principle, and summary statistics and 
95% confidence intervals are reported according 
to randomization group. For each outcome mea-
sure in turn, all available data after randomiza-
tion for each man were compared between the 
treatment groups; a likelihood-ratio test evaluated 
the evidence against a null hypothesis of equal 
mean response over 6 years of follow-up across 
the three groups. Two-level random-effects models

Patient-Reported Outcomes in Prostate Cancer
were used to accommodate the correlation be-
tween the repeated assessments for each man. 
Two-level linear models (also known as variance 
component models) were used for continuous 
measures, and two-level logistic models were used 
for binary measures; normal random-effects dis-
tributions were used in both the linear and logis-
tic models. All models included as covariates the 
variables that were used for stratification or mini-
mization in the randomization process: age and 
PSA level at baseline (continuous variables) and 
Gleason score and study center (dummy variables). 
Although we had planned to include baseline 
measures as covariates, we did not include them 
because the EPIC instrument and the ICIQ were 
not available for men who were recruited early in 
the trial. No meaningful differences in patient-
reported outcome measures across treatment 
groups were observed at baseline.15
Missing data were not imputed; all data from 
men with at least one measure available after 
randomization were included in the analysis. The 
random-effects models used here provided unbi-
ased estimates of treatment comparisons, under 
the assumption that any systematic determinant 
of data being missing was predictable from the 
covariates that were included in the model, such 
as the treatment group or earlier measures of the 
outcome (i.e., data were missing at random).26 All 
analyses were performed with the use of Stata 
software, version 14.1 (StataCorp).
Results
Response Rates
The response rates during follow-up were higher 
than 85% for most measures, including sexual 
function, and did not decline over time (Table S1B 
in the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 55 men 
(3.3%) stopped completing questionnaires, and 
some men did not complete all the question-
naires at every time point. Outcomes in the four 
domains are presented in this section, and selected 
scores and items are shown in Figures 1, 2, 3, 
and 4 (details of all patient-reported outcomes 
are provided in Table S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Domain A: Urinary Function and Effect  
on Quality on Life
Prostatectomy had the greatest negative effect on 
urinary continence at 6 months, and although 
there was some recovery, urinary incontinence 
remained worse in the prostatectomy group than 
in the radiotherapy group and active-monitoring 
group at all time points (P<0.001 for each mea-
sure) (Fig. 1A and 1B, and Table S2A in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Radiotherapy and ac-
tive monitoring had little effect on urinary con-
tinence; the rates of urinary incontinence were 
similar in the two treatment groups, although 
the rate rose slightly in the active-monitoring 
group over time. The rate of use of absorbent pads 
increased from 1% at baseline to 46% at 6 months 
in the prostatectomy group, as compared with 
4% at 6 months in the active-monitoring group 
and 5% at 6 months in the radiotherapy group. 
By year 6, 17% of men in the prostatectomy group 
were using pads, as compared with 8% in the ac-
tive-monitoring group and 4% in the radiotherapy 
group (Fig. 1B). The effect of urinary inconti-
nence on quality of life was worse in the prosta-
tectomy group for 2 years, but then became some-
what similar to that reported in the other groups 
(Fig. 1C). A similar pattern was shown for scores 
that combined lower urinary tract symptoms 
and incontinence (Fig. 1D and 1F). Scores for 
voiding symptoms were a little worse in the ra-

e 1 (facing page). Outcomes for Urinary Function 
and Effect on Quality of Life.
Shown are the effects of the treatments on urinary 
function (including urinary incontinence) and quality 
of life. The International Consultation on Incontinence 
Questionnaire (ICIQ) incontinence scores, shown in 
Panel A, range from 0 to 21. Panel B shows the per-
centage of men who used one or more absorbent 
pads per day for urinary incontinence, as assessed by 
the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) 
instrument. In Panel C, the percentages shown are for 
men who reported a moderate-to-severe incontinence 
problem, as assessed by the ICIQ. The EPIC urinary 
scores, shown in Panel D, comprise several urinary 
symptoms, including incontinence; scores are formed 
by linear transformation of raw scores and range from 
0 to 100. The International Continence Society Male 
Short-Form (ICSmaleSF) voiding scores, shown in 
Panel E, range from 0 to 20. Panel F shows the per-
centage of men reporting that urinary symptoms af-
fected their quality of life somewhat to a lot, and Panel 
G, the percentage of men reporting nocturia at least 
two times per night — both as assessed by the  
ICSmaleSF. The P values show the strength of evi-
dence for a difference in mean response over 6 years 
of follow-up across the three groups, with P values of 
0.01 or lower indicating strong evidence of a differ-
ence. I bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

groups at 6 months but then returned close to 
baseline levels and were similar to the scores in 
the prostatectomy group and the active-monitor-

similar across the treatment groups (Table S2A

Patient-Reported Outcomes in Prostate Cancer
ment groups; the increase occurred particularly 
in the radiotherapy group at 6 months, but this 
percentage then decreased to become similar to 
that in the active-monitoring group. The percent-
age of men reporting nocturia returned closest to 
the baseline level in the prostatectomy group 
(Fig. 1G).
Domain B: Sexual Function and Effect  
on Quality of Life
Erectile function was reduced from baseline to 
6 months in all the men, with clear differences 
among the treatment groups (P<0.001) (Fig. 2A). 
At baseline, 67% of men reported erections firm 
enough for intercourse, but by 6 months this 
rate fell to 52% in the active-monitoring group, 
to 22% in the radiotherapy group, and to 12% in 
the prostatectomy group. Erectile function re-
mained worse in the prostatectomy group at all 
time points, and although there was some recov-
ery to 21% with erections firm enough for inter-
course at 36 months, this rate had declined again 
to 17% at 6 years. In the radiotherapy group, the 
percentage of men reporting erections firm enough 
for intercourse increased between 6 months and 
12 months and then declined again to 27% at 
6 years, and in the active-monitoring group, the 
percentage declined year to year, with 41% of 
men reporting this outcome at year 3 and 30% 
at year 6. Very similar patterns across the treat-
ment groups and over time were observed for 
the other measures of overall sexual function, 
bother (the level of the problem experienced), 
and effect on quality of life (Fig. 2B through 2E, 
and Table S2B in the Supplementary Appendix).
Domain C: Bowel Function and Effect  
on Quality of Life
Bowel function and bother scores and the effect 
of bowel habits on quality of life were un-
changed in the prostatectomy group and active-
monitoring group, but scores for these outcomes 
were worse in the radiotherapy group, particu-
larly at 6 months (Fig. 3A, 3B, and 3F, and Table 
S2C in the Supplementary Appendix). The per-
centage of men reporting fecal incontinence and 
loose stools was similar across the treatment 
groups (Fig. 3C and 3D), but the percentage of 
men reporting bloody stools from year 2 onward 
was higher in the radiotherapy group than in the 
other treatment groups (P<0.001) (Fig. 3E). The 
scores on the “bowel bother” assessment and the 
effect on quality of life were also a little worse in 
the radiotherapy group than in the other treat-
ment groups (Table S2C in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Domain D: Health-Related Quality of Life
The comparisons of health-related quality of life 
revealed no significant differences among the 
treatment groups in the physical and mental 
health subscores of the SF-12 general health 
measure, in scores on the HADS, or in any of the 
symptom or function scale scores of the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 at year 5 (Fig. 4, and Table S2D in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
The ProtecT trial has shown that all three treat-
ment groups had similar, very high rates of 
survival after treatment, but higher rates of me-
tastases and disease progression were observed 
in the active-monitoring group than in the two 
radical-treatment groups.1 In this context, under-
standing the effects of the treatments and how 
the treatments affect men’s lives becomes crucial 
for decision making. The patient-reported out-
come measures in the ProtecT trial included key 
domains that were recommended by international 
groups,4,27,28 and we followed reporting guidelines14 
to provide unbiased comparisons of the effects 
of standardized prostatectomy, radiotherapy, and 
active-monitoring management strategies for 
PSA-detected clinically localized prostate cancer. 
The findings of the ProtecT trial have clarified 
the distinct effects of prostate-cancer treatments 
on urinary, sexual, and bowel function and con-
dition-specific quality of life. The negative effect 
of prostatectomy on urinary continence and sex-
ual function, particularly erectile function, was 
greatest at 6 months, and although there was 
some recovery, the effect was worse than in the 
other treatment groups over 6 years; however, 
prostatectomy was associated with no change in 
bowel function. At 6 months, the negative effect 
of radiotherapy with neoadjuvant androgen de-
privation therapy on sexual function, particularly 
erectile function, was only a little less than that 
of prostatectomy, and bowel function, urinary 
voiding, and nocturia were worse in the radio-
therapy group than in the other groups. However, 
there was then considerable recovery in the ra-
diotherapy group for these measures, apart from

*e 3. Outcomes for Bowel Function and Effect on Quality of Life.
Shown are the effects of the treatments on bowel function and quality of life. In Panel A, the EPIC bowel function 
scores range from 0 to 100. In Panel B, the EPIC bowel bother scores range from 0 to 100. In Panel C, the percent-
ages are for men who reported having loose stools half the time or more. In Panel D, the percentages are for men 
who reported having fecal incontinence at least once per week. In Panel E, the percentages are for men who report-
ed having bloody stools half the time or more. In Panel F, the percentages are for men who reported a moderate-
to-severe negative effect on bowel habits. The P values show the strength of evidence for a difference in mean re-
sponse over 6 years of follow-up across the three groups, with P values of 0.01 or lower indicating strong evidence 
of a difference. I bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

Patient-Reported Outcomes in Prostate Cancer
more frequent bloody stools. In the active-mon-
itoring group, sexual (including erectile) func-
tion and urinary continence and function were 
affected much less than in the radical-treatment 
groups initially but worsened gradually over time, 
as increasing numbers of men received radical 
treatments and age-related changes occurred 
(Table S3B in the Supplementary Appendix); 
bowel function was unchanged.
With respect to numbers needed to treat, we 
estimated that treating 4 men with prostatecto-
my or 8 men with radiotherapy rather than ac-
tive monitoring would cause one additional case 
of erectile dysfunction at 2 years; treating 5 men 
with prostatectomy or 143 men with radiothera-
py rather than active monitoring would cause one 
additional case of urinary incontinence at 2 years. 
By the end of follow-up at 6 years, urinary and 
sexual function had stabilized in the radiothera-
py group after improving for 2 or 3 years, and 
with the steady decline that was evident in the 
active-monitoring group, the outcomes became 
similar in the active-monitoring group and the 
radiotherapy group but remained worse in the 
prostatectomy group. These profiles of the effects 
of treatments on function were mirrored in out-

Shown are the effects of the treatments on health-related quality of life. Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-
Form General Health Survey (SF-12) physical health scores (Panel A) and mental health scores (Panel B) range from 
0 to 100. “Possible case” indicates the percentages of patients, who were assessed with the use of the Hospital Anx-
iety and Depression Scale (HADS), with scores suggesting clinically significant cases of anxiety (Panel C) and de-
pression (Panel D). The P values show the strength of evidence for a difference in mean response over 6 years of 
follow-up across the three groups, with P values of 0.01 or lower indicating strong evidence of a difference. I bars 
represent 95% confidence intervals.

comes reported for the sexual, urinary, and 
bowel quality-of-life items, with some evidence 
of accommodation to changes over time. No ef-
fects were observed with respect to general 
health status (mental or physical) or anxiety or 
depression in any treatment group at any time or 
in cancer-related quality of life at 5 years.
The paucity of published data, lack of consis-
tency in definitions of outcomes, and variability 
in timing of assessment severely constrain our 
ability to compare ProtecT findings directly with 
those of other randomized trials or major cohort 
studies of treatments.3,5 Table 2 presents the 
findings for two specific items that we could 
compare — erectile function and the use of pads 
for urinary incontinence. The findings in the 
ProtecT trial were similar to those in the SPCG-4 
trial and PIVOT with respect to erectile function 
after prostatectomy and active monitoring (or 
watchful waiting).9,11,30 The slightly worse results 
in observational cohorts6,7,29 could be related to 
age or selection biases. The percentage of pa-
tients who required the use of pads after prosta-
tectomy or active monitoring was considerably 
lower in the ProtecT trial than in the SPCG-4 
trial and was similar to that in PIVOT; the re-
sults regarding pad use after radiotherapy were 
similar in the three observational studies at all 
time points (Table 2). Broadly similar results 
were also found with respect to bowel function 
and urinary symptoms after radiotherapy4,6 and 
for urinary voiding after prostatectomy.6 The 
EPIC scores in the ProtecT trial were similar to 
those in other studies.31,32 Other studies also re-
ported similar results for assessments of general 
health-related or psychological aspects of quality 
of life.3,9,33
The primary analysis of patient-reported out-
come measures according to treatment group is 
essential for policy development, but the inter-
pretation of the overall scores for decision mak-
ing by an individual patient or clinician is diffi-
cult because factors related to the design and 
analysis of the ProtecT trial and its treatment 
policies will have affected some scores. The re-
ceipt of therapies to ameliorate the side effects of 
treatments will also have affected some scores. 
These issues are considered further in section S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix. Determining 
the clinical significance of outcome measures is 
also challenging; minimal clinically important 
differences were proposed to be half the base-
line standard deviation or 10 points on some 
scores but were not defined for other scores.15 
We have provided figures for key outcomes ac-
cording to treatment group (Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4), 
as well as a table containing all summary statis-
tics, with P values that were not adjusted for 
multiple testing (Table S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix), to enable readers to make their own 
judgments.
The interventions in the ProtecT trial remain 
the three most common contemporary methods 
of treatment, but there have been developments 
since the study began. In the ProtecT trial, among 
the men in the prostatectomy group, 324 re-
ceived open retropubic procedures, 23 received 
laparoscopic procedures, and 25 received robot-
assisted procedures (the specific procedure was 
not specified in the case of 19), and most of the 
prostatectomies were nerve sparing (205 bilat-
eral, 53 unilateral, and 12 unspecified). Obser-
vational studies suggest that minimally invasive 
procedures result in a shorter length of hospital 
stay and fewer adverse events than do open pro-
cedures.34 However, a recent trial has shown that 
the functional outcomes 12 weeks after a robot-
assisted procedure were similar to those after an 
open retropubic approach,35 and another study 
showed levels of erectile dysfunction (88%) and 
urinary incontinence (31%) among men receiving 
robot-assisted procedures that were very similar 
to those in the prostatectomy group in the Pro-
tecT trial at 12 months36 The radiotherapy proto-
col in the ProtecT trial conforms with contem-
porary guidelines,37 but other techniques such as 
brachytherapy and intensity modulation have been 
introduced. Although many active-surveillance 
programs were developed during the ProtecT trial 
period, there remains little consensus on inclu-
sion criteria or monitoring and intervention 
strategies.38 The active-monitoring policy in the 
ProtecT trial had less selective inclusion criteria 
than do many active-surveillance programs, and 
follow-up did not include scheduled repeat biop-
sies or magnetic resonance imaging; however, 
the rate of men in the active-monitoring group 
in the ProtecT trial who changed treatment 
strategies was similar to that in other studies.
There are strengths and limitations in the 
design and conduct of the ProtecT trial. Key 
strengths are the inclusion of radiotherapy, the 
use of validated patient-reported outcome mea-
sures, well-balanced baseline data, high response

rates, and concordance between measures across 
the range of domains affected by treatments for 
localized prostate cancer. A high rate of eligible 
participants underwent randomization (62%).39,40 
The generalizability of the ProtecT trial is en-
hanced by its inclusion in a larger trial evaluating 
prostate cancer screening. In the Cluster Random-
ized Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP), 
general practices were randomly assigned to form 
the intervention group or the control group (the 
intervention group enrolled participants in the 
ProtecT trial and the control group followed usual 
care, which did not include an organized program 
of PSA testing).41 The diagnosis of prostate cancer 
in the ProtecT trial participants was made after 
population-based PSA testing and standardized 
diagnostic procedures.12 An important limitation 
in the current trial was that only a small number 
of men of nonwhite race were included, although 
this reflected the population in the recruitment 
areas.15 Other limitations are related to changes 
in diagnostic and treatment strategies since the 
inception of the trial and the low levels of previ-
ous PSA testing in the population42; however, as 
confirmed on biopsy, the ProtecT trial involved 
numbers of men who had stage T1 disease (76%) 
and disease with a Gleason score of 6 (on a scale 
of 2 to 10, with higher scores indicating a worse 
prognosis) (77%) that were similar to or higher 
than the numbers in other treatment or screening 
trials in the era of PSA testing.11,43,44
This primary analysis has provided data on 
patient-reported outcomes over 6 years after treat-
ment assignment in the ProtecT trial. These data, 
combined with the findings of the companion 
article,1 can be used by policymakers who are 
developing guidelines and by patients and clini-
cians who are making decisions about treatments 
for newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer or 
who are contemplating PSA testing. However, 
follow-up for an additional 5 to 10 years is required 
to fully inform decisions involving the tradeoff 
between the shorter-term effects of the manage-
ment strategies shown here and the longer course 
of progression and treatment of prostate cancer 
in the context of the onset of other life-threaten-
ing conditions.
