Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of disability and morbidity in the
aging population. Joint injury leads to cartilage damage, a known
determinant for subsequent development of posttraumatic OA,
which accounts for 12% of all OA. Understanding the early molecular
and cellular responses postinjury may provide targets for therapeutic
interventions that limit articular degeneration. Using a murine model
of controlled knee joint impact injury that allows the examination of
cartilage responses to injury at specific time points, we show that
intraarticular delivery of a peptidic nanoparticle complexed to NF-κB
siRNA significantly reduces early chondrocyte apoptosis and reactive
synovitis. Our data suggest that NF-κB siRNA nanotherapy maintains
cartilage homeostasis by enhancing AMPK signaling while suppress-
ing mTORC1 and Wnt/β-catenin activity. These findings delineate an
extensive crosstalk between NF-κB and signaling pathways that gov-
ern cartilage responses postinjury and suggest that delivery of NF-κB
siRNA nanotherapy to attenuate early inflammation may limit the
chronic consequences of joint injury. Therapeutic benefits of siRNA
nanotherapy may also apply to primary OA in which NF-κB activation
mediates chondrocyte catabolic responses. Additionally, a critical bar-
rier to the successful development of OA treatment includes ineffec-
tive delivery of therapeutic agents to the resident chondrocytes in
the avascular cartilage. Here, we show that the peptide–siRNA nano-
complexes are nonimmunogenic, are freely and deeply penetrant to
human OA cartilage, and persist in chondrocyte lacunae for at least
2 wk. The peptide–siRNA platform thus provides a clinically relevant
and promising approach to overcoming the obstacles of drug deliv-
ery to the highly inaccessible chondrocytes.

O
steoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and a
major cause of morbidity in the aging population (1). Currently,
there are limited treatment options and no disease-modifying OA
drugs (DMOADs). Joint injury is a known predisposing factor for
the development of posttraumatic OA (PTOA) and accounts for
12% of all OA in the United States, costing more than $3 billion
annually in healthcare (2). Surgical stabilization alone does not
prevent PTOA development (3). Several studies have documented a
robust inflammatory response in the aftermath of joint injury that
likely contributes to chondrocyte death and cartilage degeneration
(4). These observations suggest that limiting the early inflammatory
responses may retard PTOA development. Understanding the mo-
lecular and cellular responses postinjury may also provide targets for
therapeutic interventions that limit articular degeneration, a char-
acteristic of all forms of OA.
However, detection of the early events in chondrocyte responses
that lead to cartilage degeneration has been difficult to accomplish.
To gain further insights into these early events, we established a
noninvasive model to induce cartilage injury by applying controlled
compressive loads to mouse knee joint (5). This model allows the
examination of molecular and structural events at specific time
points postinjury. We hypothesize that early interruption of the in-
flammatory cascade postinjury will halt the progression of cartilage
damage. We also posit that the NF-κB pathway represents an at-
tractive therapeutic target for PTOA prevention, as its activity
controls the expression of gene products involved in a myriad of
cellular responses and is essential for the expression of catabolic
mediators in OA cartilage and synovium (6).
Although local [intraarticular (i.a.)] delivery of therapeutic agents
represents an attractive approach for the treatment of OA, as it is
potentially safer and more effective than systemic administration,
drug delivery into subcompartments of cartilage has proven a chal-
lenging task (7). The avascular cartilage renders chondrocytes in-
accessible even to locally delivered therapeutics, and the dense
collagen matrix further prevents effective drug penetration into the
deeper cartilage layers. In these proof-of-concept studies, we used a
peptidic nanoparticle (NP) structure that features an amphipathic,
cationic, cell-penetrating peptide as an siRNA carrier that is stable
in biological fluids and enables coordinated endosomal escape and
release of siRNA into the cytoplasm to rapidly engage the RNA-
induced silencing complex and simultaneously suppresses both ca-
nonical and noncanonical NF-κB activities (8, 9). We have recently
shown that these peptide–siRNA nanocomplexes suppressed in-
flammation in a preclinical model of rheumatoid arthritis by down-
regulating NF-κB p65 expression specifically in the joints without
affecting p65 expression or host immune responses in off-target or-
gans (10). Here, we show that administration of peptide–NF-κB
Significance
Osteoarthritis is a common debilitating joint disease that affects
millions in the United States and for which there are few thera-
peutic options. Critical barriers to the successful development of
osteoarthritis treatment include limited understanding of the
pathways governing early cartilage degradation and ineffective
delivery of therapeutic agents to the resident chondrocytes in the
avascular cartilage. Using a peptidic nanoparticle carrying siRNA
that specifically suppresses NF-κB, we show that early antiin-
flammatory intervention reduces chondrocyte death caused by
joint injury, a known predisposing factor for osteoarthritis. The
peptidic nanoparticle deeply penetrates human cartilage to deliver
its therapeutic cargo to the chondrocytes, demonstrating its ability
to permeate the dense cartilage matrix. This approach promises to
overcome the barriers to effectively treat osteoarthritis.

Results
Formulation and Characterization of Peptide–siRNA NP. We have
previously reported that the cationic amphipathic peptide desig-
nated as “p5RHH” (VLTTGLPALISWIRRRHRRHC) is capable
of siRNA transfection without significant cytotoxicity at all tested
doses (8). This novel sequence lacks the toxicity profile of its full
parent compound, melittin, because it features a truncation of six
terminal amino acids that prevents peptide-induced cytolytic
membrane pore formation at low doses in the blood stream (11–13),
yet when concentrated in endosomes still promotes endosomolysis
and siRNA escape (9). The noncovalent coupling, self-assembling
formulation strategy is depicted in Fig. 1A, where p5RHH (10 mM)
is mixed with siRNA (100 μM) at 100:1 peptide:siRNA ratio in
dilution buffer (HBSS) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 40 min
or on ice for 10 min. At this point, the size of p5RHH-siRNA NP is
∼55 nM by wet mode atomic force microscopy (8, 9) and by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1B). The NP was
fully stabilized for later injection by mixing with albumin, where
albumin final concentration was 0.5 mg/mL, or was used imme-
diately without a stablization step.
Effects of p5RHH–NF-κB siRNA NP on Cartilage Following Impact Injury.
We used a noninvasive murine model of controlled knee-joint
impact injury delivered by axial tibial compression consisting of a
single loading episode of 60 cycles (5). This injury model allows for
the study of early events after impact, at a time when inflammation
is thought to be particularly important, and mimics a traumatic
joint injury (5). Although we observed no NF-κB activity in the
absence of injury, mechanical loading stimulated both canonical
(p65) and noncanonical (p100) pathways (Fig. 2A). Phosphoryla-
tion of p65 was detected as early as 12 h following joint injury at
and around the impact site and persisted for at least 2 wk. On the
other hand, significant p100 activation was not observed until at
least 48 h after loading (Fig. 2A). Impact injury also led to NF-κB
up-regulation in the synovium (Fig. 2A). Although previous
studies suggested that the canonical pathway of NF-κB signaling
plays a central role in the catabolic responses of OA cartilage (6),
the exact contribution of the noncanonical pathway to chondrocyte
pathology has not been evaluated. We initially hypothesized that a

phospho (P)-p65 (green, Upper) and P-p100 (green, Lower) at the indicated time. There is no p65 or p100 phosphorylation in the left, uninjured knee.
Phosphorylation of p65 is seen at and around the impact area as early as 12 h after impact injury and persists for at least 14 d outside of the impact area (white
demarcation lines) and in the synovium (*). p100 phosphorylation is delayed, becoming notable around 48 h and persisting until day 14. Mice were left
untreated or injected i.a. with p65 and p100 siRNA NP immediately and at 48 h after impact injury; knees were harvested on day 5 for analysis. Mean
fluorescent intensity (MFI) of P-p65 (B) and P-p100 (C) per chondrocyte in p5RHH–NF-κB siRNA NP or scrambled (scram) siRNA NP-treated knees was measured in the

 combinatorial RNA-silencing strategy aimed at dual inhibition of
p65 and p100 would be superior to targeting individual pathways.
Informed by the articular dwelling time of the p5RHH-siRNA
NP (Fig. S1) and the timing of p65/p100 up-regulation following
impact injury (Fig. 2A), we elected to administer a combination of
p5RHH-p65/p100 siRNA NPs i.a. (0.05 μg of each siRNA for a
total of 0.1 μg in a volume of 15 μL, which was equivalent to 7.5 ×
10−12 mol of siRNA) immediately after compression injury and
repeated the i.a. injection at 48 h in an attempt to simulate early
preventative therapy in a real clinical setting. p5RHH-scrambled
siRNA NP (0.1 μg) served as control. On day 5, knee joints were
dissected and processed for histology and immunostaining. We
observed significant decrease in phosphorylation of p65 and p100
in chondrocytes, ∼50% and ∼30%, respectively, which was still
evident 72 h after the last NF-κB siRNA NP administration (day 5,
Fig. 2 B and C). In addition, p5RHH-p65/p100 siRNA NPs limited
chondrocyte death, as evidenced by an ∼50% reduction in the
number of TUNEL+ chondrocytes (Fig. 3A). Suppression of p65/
p100 phosphorylation and chondrocyte death correlated with an
∼40% reduction in cartilage injury length (lesion) as measured by
the extent of proteoglycan loss, which was indicated by reduction in
Safranin O staining (Fig. 3 B and C). Mechanical loading also
changed the distribution pattern of aggrecan from pericellular to
intracellular in the area of impact injury, as previously described
(5) (Fig. S2). Areas with aggrecan redistribution corresponded to
areas of dying cells (TUNEL+ cells) (Fig. S2) and correlated with
cartilage injury length measured by loss of Safranin O staining (Fig.
3 B and C). In addition, p5RHH–NF-κB siRNA NP i.a. adminis-
tration also profoundly suppressed p65/p100 phosphorylation in
the synovium (Fig. S3), which likely explains the ∼40% reduction
in posttraumatic reactive synovitis as measured by a previously
established scoring system (5) (Fig. 3 B and C).
To evaluate the specific effects of p65 versus p100 suppression,
we treated separate sets of mice with either i.a. p5RHH-p65
siRNA NP (0.05 μg) or p5RHH-p100 siRNA NP (0.05 μg), using
the same delivery schedule as above. We showed that the gene-
silencing effect was specific to respective siRNA (Fig. 4 A and B).
Suppression of either p65 or p100 reduced the number of
TUNEL+ cells, cartilage injury length (extent of proteoglycan
loss), and reactive synovitis (Fig. 4C) although only the p65 sup-
pression was significantly reduced compared with no treatment.
Results showed that combined inhibition of p65 and p100, al-
though statistically different from no treatment, did not provide
additional protection compared with the suppression of p65 alone
(Fig. 4C). These findings suggest that the canonical p65 pathway
plays a major role in cartilage response following impact injury.
Effects of p5RHH–NF-κB siRNA NP on Chondrocyte/Cartilage Homeostasis.
Normal chondrocytes express high levels of autophagy-related
genes (Atg), such as microtubule-associated protein light chain 3
(LC3), whereas aging and osteoarthritic cartilage displays marked
reduction in Atg expression accompanied by increased apoptosis
(14, 15). We observed that impact injury significantly reduced
chondrocyte-associated LC3 expression, an event that occurred as
early as 12 h after injury and became more extensive over time (Fig.
5A). Treatment with p5RHH-p65/p100 siRNA NPs limited the
injury-induced suppression of LC3 expression, an ∼40% reduction
at day 5 (Fig. 5B), suggesting that NF-κB signaling also modulates
Fig. 3.

 chondrocyte autophagy. The relationship between NF-κB and
autophagy in cell death/survival in the context of cancers is well
described (reviewed in refs. 16 and 17). How NF-κB signaling may
modulate autophagy to maintain chondrocyte homeostasis is still
unknown. We hypothesized that NF-κB suppression promotes
chondrocyte autophagic activity through the inhibition of mam-
malian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a known negative regulator
of autophagy (18). To this end we treated another set of mice with
an i.a. injection of p5RHH-p65 siRNA NP or scrambled siRNA
NP immediately after impact loading and examined the knee
joints at 24 h. Consistent with the data obtained at day 5 (Fig. 3A),
p5RHH-p65 siRNA NP reduced the number of TUNEL+ cells
within 24 h by ∼50% whereas p5RHH-scrambled siRNA NP had
no effect (Fig. S4A). We further confirmed that chondrocyte death
proceeded in part through apoptosis, as evidenced by nuclear lo-
calization of poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) C-terminal
cleavage fragment (Fig. S4B). In addition, we found that impact
injury up-regulated mTOR phosphorylation in chondrocytes
whereas p5RHH-siRNA NP administration significantly suppressed
mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity, as evidenced by attenuation
of ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation downstream of mTOR
(Fig. 6A). Taken together, these results suggest that p5RHH- p65

 siRNA NP preserved chondrocyte autophagy/homeostasis via
suppression of mTORC1 activity.
It is known that mTORC1 activity is regulated by AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) (18–20), a potent inducer of autophagy.
Recent evidence also suggests that AMPK is constitutively phos-
phorylated at Thr172 in articular cartilage and that the phosphory-
lation decreases with OA (21, 22). Thus, we explored the possibility
that p5RHH-p65 siRNA nanotherapy suppressed mTORC1 via
AMPK activation. Indeed, we found that AMPK activity was
maintained in the noninjured knee whereas mechanical injury led
to a profound suppression of AMPK phosphorylation at 24 h
(Fig. 6B). Conversely, p5RHH-p65 siRNA NP administration
led to enhanced AMPK phosphorylation in chondrocytes sur-
rounding the area of impact whereas scrambled siRNA had no
effect (Fig. 6B). Increase in AMPK activity was confirmed by
the phosphorylation of its classic target, acetyl-coA carboxylase
(Fig. S5A). Although compression loading did not significantly
change AMPK level, p5RHH-p65 siRNA nanotherapy enhanced
total AMPK expression as well as its activity (Fig. S5B).
AMPK has also been shown to modulate the Wingless Int-1
(Wnt) signaling pathway (23–25), which is implicated in the
pathogenesis of OA (26). Wnt stimulation in cartilage pro-
motes the accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin,
an effector of Wnt signaling, where it activates the expression
of catabolic target genes such as metalloproteinases (26). We
observed an increase in β-catenin level and its nuclear trans-
location, suggesting that impact injury activated Wnt signaling
in chondrocytes (Fig. 6C). On the other hand, p5RHH-p65
siRNA nanotherapy significantly suppressed β-catenin expres-
sion (Fig. 6C).

 Extended in Vivo Effects of p5RHH–NF-κB siRNA NP. We have shown
that p5RHH–NF-κB siRNA nanotherapy attenuated early chon-
drocyte apoptosis and reactive synovitis at day 5. However, the
lasting effect of NF-κB siRNA in the joint following i.a. adminis-
tration of NP is unknown. To further elucidate this point, we
treated a set of mice with three serial doses of p5RHH-p65 siRNA
NP delivered i.a. immediately after impact injury and again on days
1 and 2 during the acute phase that was marked by vigorous in-
flammatory response; p5RHH-scrambled siRNA NP served as
control. The knees were harvested on day 14 and analyzed for the
number of TUNEL+-positive cells and LC3 expression. Serial
p5RHH-p65 siRNA NP treatments significantly preserved chon-
drocyte viability (∼50% reduction in TUNEL+ cells) and homeo-
stasis (∼30% reduction in LC3 suppression) (Fig. 7A). These
results suggest that i.a. administration of p5RHH-p65 siRNA NP
partially suppressed the downstream negative effects of impact
injury on cartilage (summarized in Fig. 7B), an outcome that
persisted for at least 2 wk, far beyond the observed short half-life of
siRNAs in the circulation (27).
Repeated i.a. injections of p5RHH-p65 siRNA NP did not elicit
antibody production (Fig. S6A), corroborating our previous data
following systemic NP administration (10). In addition, siRNAs
have the potential to stimulate pattern recognition receptors such
as intracellular toll-like receptors (TLRs), leading to the induction
of cytokines that include type I interferons (IFNs) (28). To examine
whether i.a. injection of peptide-siRNA NP stimulated type I IFN
release, we administered p5RHH-p65 siRNA NP i.a. and examined
IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) response in the liver by real-time PCR.
Systemic administration of poly(I:C) served as a positive control for
TLR stimulation. We found no evidence of type I IFN activation
following i.a. injection of p5RHH-p65 siRNA NP (Fig. S6B).
Penetration and Persistence of p5RHH-siRNA NP in Human OA
Cartilage. As a proof of concept that our results could eventually
translate to clinical applications, we tested the efficiency of our
p5RHH-siRNA NP penetration in human OA cartilage. Fluorescent-
labeled p5RHH-siRNA NPs at 500 nM siRNA concentration
(equivalent to the concentration of NPs to which mouse cartilage
was exposed in vivo) were incubated with 5-mm2 cartilage explants
from human OA knee joints obtained at the time of total joint
arthroplasty. After 48 h of incubation, cartilage explants were
washed extensively and processed for histology. Sagittal sections
were examined in the central area (to avoid assessment of NP dif-
fusion from the cut sides of the cartilage discs) and evaluated for
Fig. 7.
Extended effects of p5RHH-p65 siRNA NP on cartilage. (A) Mice were subjected to compression injury at 6 N and injected immediately i.a. with 0.1 μg
of p5RHH-p65 or p5RHH-scrambled (scram) siRNA NP; the dose was repeated at 24 h and at 48 h (for a total of three doses). On day 14, knees were harvested
and analyzed for TUNEL+ cells (green, Upper) and length of LC3 down-regulation (green: Lower, between yellow demarcation lines). Note that the number of
TUNEL+ cells decreased over time. Values represent mean ± SEM; n = 4 mice per treatment (Tx) group. COL2 (red), type II collagen; F, femur; M, meniscus;
S, synovium. DAPI (blue) stains nuclei. (Scale bars, 100 μm.) *P < 0.05. (B) Graphical summary. Impact injury activates NF-κB–signaling pathways in chon-
drocytes, leading to expression of inflammatory cytokines that promote ECM degradation and expression of proapoptotic gene products that induce apo-
ptosis. Administration of p5RHH–NF-κB siRNA NP blocks these downstream effects. p5RHH–NF-κB siRNA nanotherapy also potentially preserves chondrocyte/
cartilage homeostasis through AMPK activation that, in turn, blocks mTORC1, thus enhancing autophagy. Impact injury likely stimulates Wnt signaling, as
evidenced by increased β-catenin level and nuclear translocation. p5RHH–NF-κB siRNA nanotherapy suppresses β-catenin expression, thus reducing the ex-
pression of catabolic genes (such as metalloproteinases).

 depth of NP penetration by confocal microscopy. In human OA

ficial layer, potentially due to NP accumulation within areas of
cartilage fibrillation (Fig. 8A). NP could be seen penetrating human
OA cartilage up to a depth of at least 700 μm, freely diffusing into
chondrocyte lacunae located in the intermediate zone (Fig. 8B). NP
also deeply penetrated normal cartilage (Fig. S7). To further assess
for persistence of siRNAs in cartilage, we incubated OA explants
with the same concentration of NP used above, washed off the
excess NP after 48 h, and examined for signal from fluorescent-
labeled siRNA over time. siRNA fluorescent signal persisted in
chondrocyte lacunae for at least 14 d after excess NP removal and
could still be detected at low level up to day 21 (Fig. 8C).
Discussion
Our results suggest extensive crosstalks between NF-κB and the
signaling pathways that govern early cartilage responses to injury
(summarized in Fig. 7B), thus providing a rationale for suppressing
NF-κB activity in limiting the progression of cartilage degeneration.
Growing evidence suggests that the NF-κB pathway is the central
regulator of the inflammatory responses in OA (6), yet targeted
therapeutic strategies to inhibit NF-κB activity in vivo to slow or
reverse OA progression remain far and few between. The i.a. de-
livery of decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) that selectively block
NF-κB activation has been previously shown to partially limit the
progression of OA induced by surgical transection of the anterior
cruciate ligament (29). However, therapeutic delivery of free ODNs
is still strongly hampered by a short half-life (30). Another study
showed that the use of an adenoviral vector to deliver NF-κB p65
siRNA into knee joints alleviated inflammation and reduced carti-
lage degradation in a rat surgical model of chronic OA (31). Despite
the excellent transfection efficiency attained with viral-based vectors,
several safety concerns remain, including genotoxicity and immu-
nogenicity (32). In addition, viral vectors are difficult to produce and
have restricted target-cell specificity (33). Nonviral platforms have
thus emerged as viable alternatives for siRNA delivery.
The historical challenge of safely delivering therapeutic siRNA
in effective doses to selected pathologies is well known (34, 35).
The recent resurgence of interest in siRNA delivery by the phar-
maceutical industry has focused on agents that accumulate pas-
sively in the liver based on the propensity of lipid carriers to be
cleared by the reticuloendothelial system (i.e., inhibition of hepatic

NP penetration in human OA cartilage explants. p5RHH-Cy3–labeled siRNA NPs (red) were incubated with 5-mm2 cartilage explants from human OA
knee. (A) After 48 h, cartilage explants were washed extensively and processed for histology. Sagittal sections were examined for depth of NP penetration by
confocal microscopy. DAPI (blue) stains nuclei. (B) Large aggregates of NPs could be seen in the matrix of the superficial zone and accumulated in chon-
drocytes in the intermediate zone. (C) Human OA cartilage explants were incubated with fluorescent NPs for 48 h; the excess NP was washed off, and explants
were kept in complete culture medium for up to 21 d. Fluorescent signal inside chondrocytes was examined by confocal microscopy at different time points.
MFI per chondrocyte was obtained from z-stack confocal images (at least 20 chondrocytes per time point were analyzed); data were derived from two
different OA samples. The rate of fluorescence decay was calculated relative to the signal observed on day 2, which was set at 100%. [Scale bars, 500 μm (A)

 PCSK9 for hypercholesterolemia or transthyretin for familial
amyloidosis). To circumvent the shortcomings of lipid carriers, we
used a peptidic NP structure that represents the culmination of a
number of specific sequence modifications to the amphipathic
cationic peptide, melittin (12, 36, 37). In this present version of the
peptide, the pore-forming capacity has been intentionally attenu-
ated while still permitting membrane penetration, thus facilitating
endosomal escape and coordinated release of siRNA into cyto-
plasm to avoid deactivation of therapeutic moieties (8, 9, 11, 38).
We have previously shown that these particles did not elicit any
systemic or adaptive immune responses in an experimental model
of rheumatoid arthritis (10). Here, we show that they did not
initiate antibody production or stimulate type I IFN response
following repeated i.a. injections. p5RHH-siRNA NP freely pen-
etrated avascular human OA cartilage to reach chondrocytes re-
siding in the deeper layers. Moreover, siRNA fluorescent signal
persisted for at least 2 wk in chondrocyte lacunae, which may
potentially serve as a drug reservoir. Combined with a relatively
favorable toxicity profile, these results suggest that p5RHH-
siRNA NP merits further consideration for clinical application as
a DMOAD platform.
The NF-κB family consists of five members: p105 (constitutively
processed to p50), p100 (processed to p52 under-regulated con-
ditions), p65 (also known as RelA), RelB, and c-Rel. These
members form homo- and heterodimers that, in the resting cell, are
normally held inactive in the cytoplasm by the association with
inhibitors, the IκB proteins. Activation of NF-κB is controlled by
the IκB kinase complex that phosphorylates IκB proteins and
targets them for degradation, releasing the NF-κB subunits for
nuclear translocation and transactivation of a multitude of re-
sponsive genes. We confirmed that the p65 canonical pathway of
NF-κB plays a major role in regulating the early molecular events
following mechanical loading. Although p100 may also participate
in these inflammatory responses, we found that dual inhibition of
p65 and p100 activities did not provide a net overall advantage to
the individual approach of p65 knockdown. This may be explained
by the fact that p52 (the processed form of p100) can heterodimerize
to either p50 or p65 and act as a transcription repressor or activator,
respectively (39). Thus, p100 silencing may exhibit mixed anti- and
proinflammatory effects. In the future, we plan to explore selective
inhibition of NF-κB–inducible kinase as this is the most important
regulatory kinase of the noncanonical pathway (40).
NF-κB is known to modulate cell survival and apoptosis. NF-κB
has long been regarded as a transcription factor that prevents
TNFα-induced cell death by inducing the expression of antiapoptotic
genes (41–44). However, NF-κB may also play a proapoptotic
function, depending on the stimulus and cellular environment. A
number of studies have suggested the involvement of NF-κB in
apoptosis of articular chondrocytes through a nitric oxide (NO)-
dependent mechanism (45, 46). NO in articular chondrocytes in-
duces activation of p38 leading to NF-κB signaling, which in turn
increases expression of proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family.
We hypothesized that biomechanical injury leads to NF-κB acti-
vation, triggering a cascade of events in chondrocytes that includes
the release of inflammatory mediators, which perpetuate the
catabolic cycles leading to chondrocyte apoptosis. Congruent with
this hypothesis, we found that suppression of NF-κB activity sig-
nificantly protects against chondrocyte apoptosis in addition to
suppressing the inflammation that drives reactive synovitis.
mTOR is a signaling pathway that promotes cell growth and
differentiation while inhibiting cellular catabolism by blocking
autophagy (18). Genetic ablation of cartilage mTOR (47) or in-
hibition of mTOR with the drug rapamycin (48, 49) reduces the
expression of catabolic enzymes and maintains cartilage viability in
experimental OA. Here we establish that mTORC1 is activated
early (within 24 h) in chondrocytes following a mechanical injury.
A variety of upstream signals converge on mTORC1, and one of
these signals is AMPK (18). AMPK acts as a “central regulator” of
inflammatory signaling in various cell types (50–52). In addition,
AMPK activation has been shown to reduce inflammation in vivo
in several preclinical models (53–55). The activation of AMPK
is known to inhibit mTOR-dependent signaling activity (18). Al-
though ample evidence indicates that AMPK activation inhibits
NF-κB signaling via several pathways (56), whether NF-κB can
conversely modulate AMPK activity in chondrocytes has not been
examined. Our data suggest that compression injury activates
NF-κB while suppressing AMPK activity, which may allow unin-
hibited mTORC1 activity to repress autophagy. In contrast,
p5RHH–NF-κB siRNA nanotherapy enhances AMPK activity
and suppresses mTORC1, thus preserving chondrocyte autophagic
activity and homeostasis. Although the exact mechanism by which
NF-κB modulates AMPK activity remains to be determined, we
envision that NF-κB–induced proinflammatory cytokines such as
IL-1β and TNFα may negatively regulate the activity of AMPK
(22). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that p5RHH-
NF-κB siRNA NP administration affects other signaling pathways
that activate AMPK. We also cannot exclude that other factors,
such as Wnt signaling, may affect mTORC1 activity (18).
The canonical Wnt/β-catenin–signaling pathway plays a critical
role in the development and maintenance of bone and cartilage
(26). Polymorphisms in certain Wnt genes increase susceptibility
to OA whereas higher expression of Wnt pathway antagonists may
delay OA progression (26). β-Catenin, the effector of canonical
Wnt signaling, is normally sequestered in a protein complex that
negatively regulates its activity, accelerating its degradation (26).
Wnt stimulation releases β-catenin from this regulatory complex,
blocking its degradation and allowing it to translocate to the nu-
cleus. Conversely, AMPK has been shown to suppress Wnt sig-
naling by up-regulating β-catenin degradation (24). Our studies
showed that p5RHH–NF-κB siRNA nanotherapy augmented
AMPK activity while suppressing β-catenin level and nuclear
translocation. These results support a crosstalk between NF-κB
and Wnt, perhaps through AMPK-mediated modulation of the
β-catenin level, although determining the exact mechanism will
require further studies.
In summary, our study shows that p5RHH–NF-κB siRNA
nanotherapy mediates chondroprotective effect partially by main-
taining cartilage autophagy/homeostasis via modulation of AMPK,
mTORC1, and Wnt/β-catenin activity. Because NF-κB–mediated
chondrocyte differentiation and disruption of cartilage homeostasis
are also characteristics of primary OA (6, 57), our findings suggest
that modulation of this pathway may potentially impact the pro-
gression of cartilage degeneration in general. However, the optimal
timing and schedule for targeted anti–NF-κB therapy in primary
OA will require further studies.
Materials and Methods
p5RHH-siRNA NP Preparation. p5RHH peptide (provided by Genscript) was
dissolved at 10 mM in DNase-, RNase-, and protease- free sterile purified water
(Cellgro) and stored in 10-μL aliquots at −80 °C before use. The Cy5.5-labeled
scrambled siRNAs and Cy3-labeled p65 siRNAs were procured from Sigma-
Aldrich, dissolved at 100 μM in 1× siRNA buffer (Thermo Scientific), and stored
in 10-μL aliquots at −80 °C before use. The p5RHH siRNA NPs were prepared by
mixing equal volumes of the aforementioned p5RHH peptide and siRNA at a
peptide/siRNA ratio of 100:1 in HBSS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Gibco and Life
Technologies) and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min and then stabilized with al-
bumin at a final siRNA concentration of 500 nM before i.a. injection or incu-
bated on ice for 10 min before adding to the cartilage culture. This preparation
typically results in a nominal NP size of ∼55 nm after applying a stabilizing
albumin coating, as measured by atomic force microscopy, and zeta potentials
varying from +12 to −5.5 mV and a polydispersity index varying from 0.120 to
0.190 depending on size and the presence or absence of an exogenously ap-
plied albumin coating. We also have previously shown that the uncoated
particles are slightly smaller (by 14%) than the albumin-coated particles by
dynamic light scattering (8, 9).
TEM on p5RHH-siRNA NPs. For visualizing the p5RHH-siRNA NPs, the electron
microscopy mesh copper grids (S160-4) were negatively charged by glow

 discharge. p5RHH-siRNA NPs were diluted 10 times and then incubated with
the grid for 1 min. After the incubation, the grids were washed with dis-
tilled water and then gently blotted dry, followed by staining with 2%
phosphotungstic acid for 30 s. The p5RHH-siRNA NP samples were viewed
on a JEOL 1200 EX II transmission electron microscope.
Noninvasive Mechanical Injury Model. Mice were kept in a pathogen-free
condition at the Washington University Specialized Research Facility and were
used in experiments that were approved by the Animal Studies Committee.
Experiments were performed on 8-wk-old male C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson
Laboratory) using a materials testing machine (Instron ElectroPuls E1000) as
previously described (5). Briefly, under anesthesia, the right tibiae were posi-
tioned with the knee downward in deep flexion between custom-made cups
and subjected to axial compressive loads with a peak force of 6 Newtons (N)
with a 0.5 N preload force to maintain the limb in position between loading
cycles. Cyclic loads were applied for 0.34 s with a rise and fall time each of 0.17 s
and a baseline hold time of 10 s between cycles for 60 cycles. The uninjured left
knees were used as controls. Some animals received an i.a. dose of NPs im-
mediately after loading that may be repeated at 24 h and/or 48 h. Animals
were returned to their cages after loading and were given standard mouse
chow and water ad libitum. At indicated time points after injury, knee joints
were dissected, fixed in formalin, paraffin-embedded, and processed for
histological analysis.
NP Administration. NPs were administered using sterile techniques: the knee
was kept in a flexed position and a volume of 15 μL of p5RHH-siRNA NP (0.1 μg,
which is equivalent to siRNA at 7.5 × 10−12 mol) was injected i.a. using a 30-
gauge needle. The left knees served as controls. The injections were repeated
at 24 h and/or 48 h. Some of the knee joints were harvested at 12, 24, and 48 h
or at days 5, 9, and 14 after the loading.
Histological Analysis of Mouse Knee Joints. Formalin-fixed knee joints were
decalcified and embedded in paraffin for sectioning. Serial sagittal sections (5 μm
in thickness) from individual knees were cut through the entire lateral femoral
condyle as described previously (5). Selected sections were stained with Safranin
O-fast green (to evaluate articular cartilage proteoglycan content), according to
standard protocols. The length of the cartilage injury (loss of Safranin O
staining) in each individual knee was measured using ImageJ software (https://
imagej.nih.gov/ij) based on the section with the most severe injury. Postinjury
reactive synovitis was scored on a scale of 0–3 using an established scoring
system described previously (5): 0—normal thickness of synovial lining (1–2
cells); 1, 2—thickness of 2–4 cells; 2—thickness of 4–9 cells; and 3—thickness ≥10
cells. Quantitative scoring was performed in a blinded fashion.
Detection of Chondrocyte Apoptosis. Detection of apoptotic cells was per-
formed using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit with Fluorescein (catalog no.
11–684-795–910, Roche) with the TUNEL assay. Briefly, paraffin-embedded knee
sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, treated with protease K (10 μg/mL
for 20 min at 37 °C), and permeabilized with 0.5% TWEEN-20/PBS for 15 min. A
freshly prepared TUNEL reaction mixture was applied to sections for 60 min at
37 °C, rinsed three to five times with PBS, and mounted with VECTASHIELD
mounting medium with DAPI (catalog no. H-1200, Vector Laboratories). The
TUNEL+ cell number cells were enumerated across the entire impact area and
expressed as a mean.
Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy. Paraffin sections were
deparaffinized and rehydrated. Sections were incubated with 3% (vol/vol) H2O2 in
PBS for 15 min to quench endogenous peroxidases. Proteinase K (10 μg/mL for
20 min at 37 °C) was applied to the sections for antigen retrieval. After blocking
endogenous biotin (Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit, Vector Laboratories) and Tyramide
Signal Amp (TSA) blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature, slides were
incubated with the primary antibodies anti-LC3 (1:100, catalog no. L7543, Sigma-
Aldrich), phospho-p65 (1:100, ab28856, Abcam), phospho-p100 (1:100, catalog
no. orb106199, Biorbyt), phospho-mTOR (1:100, catalog no. 5536, Cell Signaling),
phospho-S6 Ribosomal Protein (1:100, catalog no. 4858, Cell Signaling), AMPK
(1:100, catalog no. ab131512, Abcam), phospho-AMPK (1:100, catalog no. 1535,
T172, Cell Signaling), β-catenin (1:100, catalog no. ab16051, Abcam), (1:100, cat-
alog no. 11818, Cell Signaling), cleaved PARP (1:100, catalog no. 9544, Cell Sig-
naling), and aggrecan (1:200, catalog no. AB1031, Millipore) diluted in TSA block
buffer overnight at 4 °C and then washed and incubated with the corresponding
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Biotinyl Tyramide working solution (1:100)
was applied for 3–10 min to enhance the specific signal of primary antibodies. All
of the sections were incubated in Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated–streptavidin (1:200,
catalog no. S-11223, Molecular Probes) diluted in TSA blocking buffer for 30 min
at room temperature and counterstained with DAPI (1:1,000, Vector Laborato-
ries). Slides were subsequently incubated with COL2 antibody (1:200, generously
provided by L. J. Sandell and M. F. Rai, Washington University, St. Louis) (5) for 1 h
at room temperature followed by TRITC-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody
(1:100, catalog no. 712–295-153, Jackson ImmunoResearch). All images were
visualized on a Nikon ECLIPSE microscope and acquired with QCapture software
or ZEISS LSM 880 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope. The quantification of phospho-
p65, phospho-p100, phospho-S6, phospho- and total AMPK, and phospho-ACC was
performed with software ZEN, and the analyzed chondrocytes were chosen at a
site immediately outside of the impact area. The data were obtained from 15 to 20
cells per section and 3–4 sections per knee joint and presented as the average
mean fluorescent intensity per cell. Quantitative scoring was performed in
a blinded fashion.
Ex Vivo Culture of Cartilage Explants. Human cartilage explants were obtained
from patients who signed consent forms at the time of total knee arthroplasty
through a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board at Washington
University School of Medicine and provided to us for these studies anony-
mously. The explants were then washed several times with HBSS containing
antibiotics, incubated overnight in culture medium containing DMEM/F12 (1:1),
10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/0.1 mg/mL), amphotericin B (0.25 μg/
mL), and ciproflaxin (10 μg/mL) in a six-well plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2. One day
after incubation, cartilage explants were placed in a 96-well plate and in-
cubated with p5RHH-Cy3–labeled siRNA NPs in 250 μL of culture medium
(which rendered the siRNA at a concentration of 500 nM) and incubated for
48 h. After three to five washes with PBS, the cartilage explants either were
embedded in Tissue-Tek Optimal Cutting Temperature (O.C.T.) compound
(Sakura Finetek USA, Inc.) or further cultured in complete culture medium
without NPs. At specific time points (5, 9, 14, and 21 d) the explants were again
washed extensively and embedded in O.C.T. compound. The nonfixed
sections were directly mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium with
DAPI (catalog no. H-1200, Vector Laboratories), and images were acquired
using confocal microscopy.
Statistics. Comparisons between multiple groups (three or more) were performed
by one-way ANOVA, and Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons was
performed. The sample size (number of animals per genotype/treatment) chosen
is based on means and variances in similar experiments in this mouse model of
OA for detection of differences between experimental groups at an α-level of
0.05 and a statistical power of 0.80, assuming a two-sided test.
