SUMMARY
Individuals sometimes show inconsistent risk prefer-
ences, including excessive attraction to gambles
featuring small chances of winning large amounts
(called ‘‘positively skewed’’ gambles). While func-
tional neuroimaging research indicates that nucleus
accumbens (NAcc) and anterior insula (AIns) activity
inversely predict risky choice, structural connections
between these regions have not been described in
humans. By combining diffusion-weighted MRI with
tractography, we identified the anatomical trajectory
of white-matter tracts projecting from the AIns to the
NAcc and statistically validated these tracts using
Linear Fascicle Evaluation (LiFE) and virtual lesions.
Coherence of the right AIns-NAcc tract correlated
with reduced preferences for positively skewed
gambles. Further, diminished NAcc activity during
gamble presentation mediated the association be-
tween tract structure and choice. These results iden-
tify an unreported tract connecting the AIns to the
NAcc in humans and support the notion that struc-
tural connections can alter behavior by influencing
brain activity as individuals weigh uncertain gains
against uncertain losses.
INTRODUCTION
Choice consistency is a hallmark of rationality (von Neumann and
Morgenstern, 1944). Nonetheless, people sometimes choose
inconsistently in predictable ways (Kahneman and Tversky,
1979). For instance, the profitability of casinos and lotteries sug-
gests that people are seduced by ‘‘positively skewed’’ gambles
that feature a small chance of winning a large amount combined
with a large chance of losing a little (Kraus and Litzenberger,
1976). Neuroimaging experiments suggest that, when presented
with positively skewed gambles, people report experiencing
greater positive arousal (e.g., feelings akin to ‘‘excitement’’)
and show increased brain activity in circuits associated with
gain anticipation, including the nucleus accumbens (or NAcc),
which might encourage risk taking (Wu et al., 2011).
Recent advances in neuroimaging have allowed researchers
to visualize brain activity that not only correlates with presenta-
tion of risky options, but that also precedes and predicts
choice among them (Knutson and Bossaerts, 2007). For
instance, using fMRI, researchers have shown that increased
NAcc activity predicts risk-seeking choices, but increased ante-
rior insula (AIns) activity predicts risk-averse choices on a trial-
to-trial basis (e.g., Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005). Comparative
research suggests that these regions receive input from evolu-
tionarily conserved dopaminergic and noradrenergic projections
emanating from the midbrain, respectively, and theorists have
speculated that release of these neurotransmitters in relevant
terminal regions may promote approach or avoidance behavior
(e.g., Knutson et al., 2014; Panksepp, 1998).
Although fMRI can provide information about which brain cir-
cuits promote choice, it cannot illuminate the structural connec-
tions between those circuits. Recently, investigators have used
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to trace ascending mesolimbic
axonal projections from the ventral tegmental area to the NAcc,
as well as descending projections from the medial prefrontal cor-
tex (MPFC) to the NAcc (Coenen et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2008;
Draganski et al., 2008; Lehe
´ ricy et al., 2004), recapitulating
anatomical tracing studies of nonhuman primates (reviewed in
Haber and Knutson, 2010). Diffusion measures such as fractional
anisotropy (FA) have been associated with white-matter density,
alignment, and diameter (collectively referred to as ‘‘coherence’’
henceforth; Jones et al., 2013). Assuming that greater white-
matter coherence promotes the transmission of functional sig-
nals, higher coherence might modulate brain activity in specific
projection target regions, which might then influence behavior.
For instance, the coherence of white-matter projections from
the MPFC to the NAcc can account for individual differences in
reward learning (Samanez-Larkin et al., 2012).
Whereas investigators have used DWI to estimate the coher-
ence of prefrontal projections to the NAcc, other projections
might also modulate NAcc activity. For instance, activity in
both the NAcc and AIns precedes, but has opposing effects
on, risky choice (Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005). To date, direct
structural connections between the AIns and NAcc have not
been documented in humans. Only two studies in other species

63
 have suggested the possibility of such a connection (Chikama
et al., 1997; Reynolds and Zahm, 2005). While tracers implicated
unidirectional glutamatergic projections from the AIns to the
NAcc, the researchers could only visualize the destination but
not the spatial trajectories of projections.
We investigated whether similar tracts project from the AIns to
the NAcc in humans. Further, we explored whether the white-
matter coherence of identified tracts might account for brain ac-
tivity as well as behavior related to gambles. Since functional
neuroimaging studies suggest that positively skewed gambles
preferentially increase NAcc activity (Wu et al., 2012), we pre-
dicted that the coherence of an AIns-NAcc tract might decrease
NAcc activity and choices of positively skewed gambles. We
also tested for a more prominent association in the right hemi-
sphere, since right AIns activity most consistently correlates
with negative arousal and risk perception (Craig, 2009; Critchley
et al., 2001; Paulus et al., 2003).
RESULTS
Analyses first identified and validated a white-matter tract
connecting the AIns and NAcc, next verified previously docu-
mented mesolimbic white-matter tracts, then characterized
functional predictors of positive-skew preference during a
gambling task, and finally tested whether functional activity
could account for the association of tract coherence with posi-
tive-skew preference.
Identification and Validation of White-Matter Tracts
Connecting the AIns and NAcc
Probabilistic tractography identified three bilateral white-matter
tracts in all subjects’ brains (n = 32; Figure 1A). One pair of tracts
projected through the subcaudate white matter from the AIns to
the NAcc (Figure S1). Two other pairs of tracts projected from the
MPFC to the NAcc and between the VTA and the NAcc, repli-
cating previously described pathways (Samanez-Larkin et al.,
2012).
Statistical evidence for these tracts was evaluated using the
Linear Fascicle Evaluation method and virtual lesions approach
(LiFE; Pestilli et al., 2014). Results revealed strong statistical ev-
idence for the existence of all three bilateral tracts (i.e., connect-
ing the AIns and NAcc, MPFC and NAcc, and VTA and NAcc; Fig-
ure 1B). FA was computed based on a standard tensor model
(Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996) to index white-matter coherence
for each tract. Each tract’s FA profile was computed across
each tract in each hemisphere and subject and then averaged
across the middle 50% portion of each tract’s profile to index
coherence (Figure 1C; Supplemental Information). Effects of
age on FA replicated and extended previous findings (Sama-
nez-Larkin et al., 2012; Figure 1D; Supplemental Information).

 h2 = 0.634; left: F(2,50) = 4.69, p = 0.014, h2 = 0.726; Table S1).
We additionally found a significant effect of gamble condition on
risk seeking (F(2,50) = 4.01, p = 0.024, h2 = 0.622). Pairwise com-
parisons revealed that subjects who did not always choose to
seek or avoid risk for any gamble condition (n = 20) preferred
positively skewed to negatively skewed gambles (paired t(19) =
2.13, p = 0.047). This preference, however, varied across individ-
uals (Figure S2).
Pairwise correlations showed that individual differences in
right hemisphere AIns-NAcc tract coherence were associated
with reduced preference for positively skewed gambles (b =
�0.40, t(30) = �2.38, p = 0.02). This association remained signif-
icant after controlling for age and multiple comparisons for
testing bilateral tracts (b = �0.44, t(30) = �2.37, p = 0.02).
Further, this association remained robust after removing seven
subjects who either never (n = 3) or always (n = 4) took positively
skewed gambles (b = �0.47, t(23) = �2.57, p = 0.02). Right
AIns-NAcc tract coherence was also marginally negatively asso-
ciated with general risk taking across all gamble conditions
(b = �0.31, t(30) = �1.80, p = 0.08), but not specifically for
symmetric (b = �0.08, t(30) = �0.46, p = 0.65) or negative-
skew (b = �0.14, t(30) = �0.77, p = 0.45) gambles. Left-hemi-
sphere AIns-NAcc tract coherence was marginally associated
with decreased risk taking for negatively skewed gambles
(b = �0.34, t(30) = �2.03, p = 0.06), but not with risk taking in gen-
eral or any other gamble condition (positive skew: b = �0.10,
t(30) = �0.54, p = 0.59; symmetric: b = �0.02, t(30) = �0.09,
p = 0.93; overall: b = �0.23, t(30) = �1.27, p = 0.21). Coherence
of other tracts (i.e., the bilateral MPFC-NAcc tract and bilateral
VTA-NAcc tract) was not associated with risk taking in general
or in any gamble condition.
Association of Functional Brain Activity with Risky
Choice
fMRI data were preprocessed and activity time courses ex-
tracted from predefined volumes of interest (Experimental Pro-
cedures). Logistic regressions indicated that activity immedi-
ately preceding choice predicted risk taking on a trial-to-trial
basis within subjects. Specifically, right NAcc and MPFC activity
predicted risk-seeking choices, whereas right AIns activity pre-
dicted risk-averse choices across all gambles (Table 1). Gamble
type also predicted risk-seeking choices. These variables pre-
dicted choices to gamble even after controlling for other poten-
tially relevant variables (e.g., the previous gamble’s outcome,
domain of current earnings relative to one’s endowment). The
best-fitting model included right hemisphere neural activity,
gamble type, previous gamble outcome, and domain of current
earnings (indicated by Akaike Information Criterion [AIC],
Bayesian Information Criterion [BIC], and a likelihood-ratio test:
c2(3) = 55.32, p < 0.0001; Table 1).
Activity time courses were plotted and analyzed to verify
that gamble type differentially altered neural activity in volumes
of interest in a way that could influence choice. Findings indi-
cated that presentation of positively skewed gambles elicited
greater activity in the right and left NAcc prior to choice than
did symmetric or negatively skewed gambles (right: positive
skew > symmetric: t(31) = 2.17, p = 0.04; positive skew > nega-
tive skew: t(31) = 2.80, p = 0.01; left: positive skew > symmetric:
t(31) = 2.87, p = 0.01; positive skew > negative skew: t(31) = 3.02,
p = 0.005), but not in the AIns or MPFC (Figure 2).
Functional Mediation of the Association of Tract
Coherence with Reduced Positive-Skew Preference
Individual differences in average right NAcc activity immediately
prior to choice were entered as a statistical mediator of the asso-
ciation of right AIns-NAcc tract coherence with reduced prefer-
ence for positively skewed gambles. Results from hierarchical
regression analyses indicated that right AIns-NAcc tract coher-
ence was associated with decreased right NAcc activity before
gamble choice (b = �0.35, p = 0.03) and that right NAcc activity
before gamble choice was associated with individual differences
in positive-skew preference (b = 0.46, p = 0.003; Figure 3).

Based on AIC, BIC, and a likelihood-ratio test for nested models, the best model for predicting trial-by-trial risky choice includes terms for right hemi-
sphere neural activity, gamble type, previous gamble outcome, and domain of current earnings (c2(3) = 55.32, p < 0.0001). Winning a previous gamble
significantly predicted risk aversion on the following trial. A model including left-hemisphere neural activity did not improve model fit (Table S3). Z

 Importantly, including the indirect effect of right NAcc activity
before choice significantly decreased the direct association of
right AIns-NAcc tract coherence with reduced positive-skew
preference to nonsignificance (b’ = �0.24, p = 0.14; b = �0.40,
p = 0.02), consistent with statistical mediation. Additional medi-
ation models specified with different terms (i.e., coherence of
control tracts and activity of control volumes of interest) estab-
lished that only right AIns-NAcc tract coherence and right
NAcc activity before gamble choice were associated with posi-
tive-skew preference (Table S4). Further, confirmatory analyses
of an independent fMRI dataset showed that functional coupling
of the AIns and NAcc was associated with decreased positive-
skew preference (Figure S4).
DISCUSSION
This research identifies an unreported white-matter tract con-
necting the AIns to the NAcc in humans. Consistent with a poten-
tial role in risk preferences, individual differences in AIns to NAcc
tract coherence were associated with reduced preference for
positively skewed gambles. Functionally, presentation of posi-
tively skewed gambles preferentially increased NAcc activity,
which predicted subsequent risky choice. Decreased NAcc ac-
tivity could statistically account for the association of AIns-
NAcc tract coherence with reduced preference for positively
skewed gambles, forging links from brain structure to brain func-
tion to behavior.
These findings illustrate the importance of leveraging compar-
ative neuroanatomy to guide the discovery and characterization
of structural connections in humans (e.g., Haber and Knutson,
2010). Only two comparative studies in monkeys and rats had
previously suggested that a unidirectional glutamatergic projec-
tion existed from the AIns to the NAcc (Chikama et al., 1997; Rey-
nolds and Zahm, 2005). Inspired by those findings, we were able
to identify and trace the trajectory of AIns-NAcc tracts in hu-
mans. In addition, previously documented tracts (i.e., from the

skew: paired t(31) = 2.80, p = 0.01).

VOIs showed similar results (Figure S3).
MPFC to the NAcc and connecting the
midbrain and NAcc) were validated with
novel methods, and their associations
with age extended previous findings (Sup-
plemental Information). Thus, structural
tracings in animals can provide unique clues not only about
where tracts begin and end, but also about their direction and
chemical transmission, which can guide interpretations of find-
ings in humans (e.g., Heimer et al., 1991; Lehman et al., 2011).
This investigation also illustrates how multimodal imaging can
illuminate new discoveries about brain activity and behavior. The
combination of DWI, fMRI, and behavior allowed us to trace a
path from brain structure to brain function to behavior. While pre-
vious fMRI research suggests that increased NAcc activity pro-
motes financial risk seeking while increased AIns activity instead
promotes financial risk aversion (e.g., Kuhnen and Knutson,
2005), the present research begins to situate those findings
within an anatomical framework. Specifically, increased AIns to
NAcc coherence appeared to reduce preference for positively
skewed gambles by decreasing NAcc activity during gamble
presentation. Positively skewed gambles preferentially elevated
NAcc activity, despite having the same expected value and vari-
ance as symmetric and negatively skewed gambles, which
might account for the excessive but irrational attractiveness of
these ‘‘lottery’’-like gambles (Wu et al., 2012). Interestingly, by
reducing NAcc activity to positively skewed gambles, the coher-
ence of direct projections from the AIns to the NAcc might ‘‘ratio-
nalize’’ risky choice, even in the absence of modulation from
more ‘‘reflective’’ prefrontal input.
Importantly, current tractography methods cannot quantify
differential contributions of crossing fibers within a voxel (Jones
et al., 2013). The AIns to NAcc tract traverses the lateral-medial
axis of the brain, thereby intersecting with other tracts like the un-
cinate fasciculus in some subjects (Petrides and Pandya, 2007).
Future research with improved methods will therefore need to
determine the extent to which the AIns to NAcc tract represents
a distinct component of the subcaudate white matter.
Together, these findings provide multimodal empirical support
for an ‘‘Affect-Integration-Motivation’’ or AIM framework, which
describes choice as arising from hierarchical processes of affec-
tive evaluation, integration, and motivation (Samanez-Larkin and
66
Neuron 89, 63–69, January 6, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
 Knutson, 2015). While the connections explored here pertain pri-
marily to affective evaluation, future studies may focus on the
connectivity of higher order components of the framework that
can support value integration and motivation. The findings also
add structural connectivity information to a growing functional
neuroimaging literature implicating the NAcc in assessment of
expected value, but the AIns in the assessment of risk (Knutson
and Bossaerts, 2007; Mohr et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2012), in both
financial and other uncertain choices (e.g., Sanfey, 2007). While
cross-sectional mediation analysis can only model correlations
between brain structure, function, and behavior, these findings
also cohere with causal evidence indicating that AIns lesions
(which should disconnect projections to the NAcc) can increase
financial risk taking (Clark et al., 2008), as well as selectively
impair loss but not gain learning (Palminteri et al., 2012).
These multimodal findings highlight new directions for physio-
logical research. Although the findings are logically consistent
with repeated demonstrations that NAcc fMRI activity promotes
risky choice, it is not clear how glutamatergic projections from
the AIns to NAcc might decrease fMRI activity in the NAcc. While
comparative research suggests that phasic dopamine release
may increase fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (or BOLD) ac-
tivity in the NAcc (Choi et al., 2006; Knutson and Gibbs, 2007),
the influence of glutamate release on NAcc BOLD activity has
not been characterized. One counterintuitive possibility raised
by these findings is that glutamate release in the NAcc may inter-
fere with or even decrease dopamine-elicited increases in BOLD
activity, consistent with recent findings that combine optoge-
netics with fMRI (E.A. Ferenczi et al., personal communication).
Identification of a new tract naturally raises many questions
for exploration. The anatomical connectivity of the rest of the
insular cortex is ripe for additional characterization. Comparative
studies suggest that projections from the posterior insula target
regions in the AIns, possibly providing peripheral physiological
input to affective responses (Chang et al., 2013; Craig, 2009).
The AIns also directly connects to lateral cortical regions impli-
cated in controlling and changing the course of action (Aron
et al., 2007). Little is known about the trajectory or malleability
of these white-matter tracts in humans, and rich opportunities
exist for exploring changes in their coherence as a result of
gradual (e.g., related to maturation and aging) or more rapid
(e.g., experience and training) influences. Perhaps most tanta-
lizing, identification and assessment of the stable properties of
tracts may open the door to exploring how targeted interventions
can alter their structure and related functions.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Thirty-seven right-handed healthy adults completed the study. Five were
excluded from analyses because of head motion >2 mm during the fMRI
scan, leaving a total of 32 subjects (14 females, age mean = 52, SD = 19.3,
range = 21–85 years). The study was conducted at the Stanford Center for
Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging. Written informed consent was ob-
tained from all subjects prior to participation. Subjects completed behavioral
and self-report measures, including neuropsychological tests. Subjects then
underwent functional and structural MRI scans and received $20 per hour
plus the total earned on the gambling task. The study was approved by the
Stanford Institutional Review Board.
Behavioral Task and Analysis
Subjects were scanned with fMRI as they performed a modified version of a
gambling task (Wu et al., 2011) during which they made a series of choices
to gamble (Figure S2). During each trial (n = 72; 24 per condition), gambles
were depicted as circles with slices representing the probability of associated
outcomes. If subjects chose to accept, the gamble’s outcome was displayed
as feedback that cumulated to a final payout, but if they chose to reject, no
outcome accrued, which was also displayed as feedback. When prompted
with the word ‘‘choose,’’ subjects indicated their choices with a left or right but-
ton press (spatially counterbalanced across trials). Three gamble conditions
were presented in a pseudorandom order: ‘‘Positive Skew’’ (25% probability
of gaining $5.25 but 75% of losing $1.75), ‘‘Symmetric’’ (50% probability of
gaining or losing $3.05), and ‘‘Negative Skew’’ (25% probability of losing
�$5.25 but 75% probability of gaining +$1.75). Expected value (m = $0.00)
and variance (s2 = 9.19) were held constant across all gambles. Subjects
received an endowment ($10.00) before entering the scanner plus their cumu-
lative outcome in cash at the end of the experiment. To test the effect of domain
(gain or loss) on trial-by-trial choice, the endowment was subtracted from
current earnings. Preference for each gamble type was then calculated as
the proportion of trials that subjects accepted each, and overall risk preference
was similarly indexed by averaging these proportions across gamble types.
fMRI Acquisition and Analysis
Images were acquired with a 3T General Electric Discovery 750 scanner (GE),
using a 32-channel head coil. Forty-six 2.9-mm thick slices (2.9-mm isotropic
voxels, interleaved acquisition) extended axially from the mid-pons to the top
of the skull. Whole-brain functional scans were acquired with a T2*-weighted
gradient pulse sequence (TR = 2 s, TE = 24 ms, flip angle = 77). A high-reso-
lution T1-weighted anatomical image was also collected using an axial fast
spoiled grass sequence (TR = 7.2 ms, TE = 2.3 ms, flip = 12, 0.9 mm isotropic
voxels) for co-registration of functional image and DWI data and for volume of
interest specification. Functional imaging analyses were conducted using
AFNI and followed previously described methods (Supplemental Information;
Knutson and Greer, 2008).
Mean activity time courses of predicted volumes of interest were plotted and
statistically compared with targeted t tests (Figure 2). Percent signal change
Figure 3. NAcc Functional Activity Mediated the Association be-
tween AIns-NAcc Tract Coherence and Positive-Skew Preference
AIns-NAcc tract coherence is associated with reduced NAcc activity during
presentation of positively skewed gambles (b = �0.35, p = 0.03), and NAcc
activity was associated with positive-skew preference (b = 0.46, p = 0.003).
This indirect pathway mediated the association of tract coherence with posi-
tive-skew preference (b’ = �0.24, p = 0.14; b = �0.40, p = 0.02). Path co-
efficients are standardized bs. No alternative combination of tract coherence
and functional activity could reproduce this pattern of associations (Table S4).

 prior to gamble choice in each trial (i.e., the second volume acquisition in the
trial) were included in a logistic regression model that used peak neural activity
(in the NAcc, AIns, and MPFC) to predict trial-by-trial gamble choices, and
subjects were modeled as random effects. Finally, bootstrapped mediation
analyses were conducted to determine whether NAcc activity could statisti-
cally mediate the association of AIns-NAcc tract coherence with positive-
skew preference (Figure 3).
DWI Acquisition and Analysis
DWI data were also acquired on the same 3T scanner and head coil. A dual-
spin echo diffusion-weighted sequence was used to acquire 2-mm isotropic
images in 96 diffusion directions (b = 2,500 s/mm2; TE = 97.5 ms). Ten non-
diffusion-weighted (b = 0) volumes were acquired. Preprocessing and proba-
bilistic tractography followed previously described procedures (Supplemental
Information; Tournier et al., 2007). After identification, tracts were statistically
validated using LiFE with virtual lesions (Supplemental Information; Pestilli
et al., 2014).
