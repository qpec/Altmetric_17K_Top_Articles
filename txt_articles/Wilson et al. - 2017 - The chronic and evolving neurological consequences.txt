Summary 
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can have lifelong and dynamic effects on health and wellbeing. Research 
on the long-term consequences emphasises that, for many patients, TBI should be conceptualized as 
a chronic health condition. Evidence suggests that functional outcomes after TBI can show 
improvement or deterioration up to two decades after injury, and rates of all-cause mortality remain 
elevated for many years. Furthermore, TBI represents a risk factor for a variety of neurological 
illnesses, including epilepsy, stroke and neurodegenerative disease. With respect to 
neurodegeneration after TBI, post-mortem studies on the long-term neuropathology after injury 
have identified complex persisting and evolving abnormalities best described as polypathology 
which includes chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Despite growing awareness of the life-long 
consequences of TBI, substantial gaps in research exist. Improvements are therefore needed in 
understanding chronic pathologies and their implications for survivors of TBI, which could inform 
long-term health management in this sizeable patient population.

Introduction 
Evidence accumulated in the past decades has led to recognition that for many patients traumatic 
brain injury (TBI) does not cease to evolve after the acute period and initial recovery. This injury is 
not a time-bound event, but a chronic health condition1 with lifelong effects on both morbidity and 
mortality. Estimates based on patients with TBI treated in hospital indicate that 1.1% of the US 
population have lifelong disabilities as a consequence of this injury,2 whereas if the substantial 
number of people who do not seek hospital treatment for injury are included, the percentage might 
be more than three times greater.3 Furthermore, outcomes in TBI are not fixed long term, and there 
can be improvement and deterioration many years after injury.4,5  
The long-term consequences of TBI are a matter of substantial concern for affected individuals and 
their families, and for society owing to the substantial economic burden; moreover, the costs are 
greater in the elderly and therefore set to increase in an ageing population.6 Multiple negative 
effects on lifelong health have been associated with TBI (panel),  and there is growing evidence that 
many people in the chronic phase are living with under-recognised and poorly managed sequelae of 
injury.29,30 Understanding of the long-term consequences of TBI is important because this knowledge 
will allow identification of risk factors for poor outcomes and appropriate targeting of health care 
resources and interventions.  
One area that has received recent attention is the long-term effects of repetitive concussion in 
sports.31,32  The potential effects of concussion should be understood in the broader context of TBI as 
a risk factor for long-term neurological disease.  Studies of cohorts with TBI of all severities and 
causes can help to elucidate the neurological consequences of brain injury, and neuroimaging and 
pathological investigations in the past decade have enabled better characterisation of late 
neurodegenerative features associated with TBI.  
Other reviews have provided detailed accounts of long-term pathology,33,34 imaging,35 disease,1,10,36 
functioning,4 emotional adjustment,26 and cognition.12,37  In this Series paper, we aim to bring 
together key evidence concerning the chronic consequences of TBI in adults, with an emphasis on 
neurological changes and how they evolve over time, focusing on studies that have included follow-
up of 5 years or more after injury.  
We begin by examining studies of late changes in global functional outcome and long-term 
mortality. We then evaluate the specific contribution of TBI-related neurodegenerative and other 
neurological diseases to morbidity and mortality, and consider characterization of underlying 
 5 
 
neurodegeneration. Finally, we emphasise the gaps in knowledge and highlight areas of research 
needed to improve understanding and awareness of the long-term consequences of TBI.  
Dynamic long-term functional outcomes of TBI 
A range of problems can persist after TBI, including post-concussion symptoms, emotional 
difficulties, cognitive impairment, and functional limitations.38 However, until recently relatively little 
has been known about changes in outcome many years after injury.  Understanding of global 
outcome changes has been enhanced by information from longitudinal studies involving two 
cohorts,28,39-42  both with follow-up of functional status of more than 10 years (table 1).  In the USA 
the TBI Model Systems (TBIMS) collaboration has assembled an invaluable national database  of 
long-term outcomes of patients who have received rehabilitation after brain injury, and in the UK, a 
representative cohort of patients admitted to hospital with TBI originally identified by Thornhill and 
colleagues49 in Glasgow, UK, has been successively followed up.  
The TBIMS programme was established in 1987 to collect longitudinal data that could be used to 
improve outcomes of TBI,50 and there are currently 16 funded civilian centres. Individuals enrolled in 
the project are aged 16 years and older receiving inpatient rehabilitation for a primary diagnosis of 
TBI , and they are followed up at 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years after injury, and every 5 years 
thereafter. The 15,000th person was enrolled in the TBIMS national database in 2016, with early 
participants now followed up for 25 years.  
As might be expected, older age at the time of injury tends to be associated with poorer outcomes 
and a faster rate of decline on functional outcomes.51-53 Studies have taken advantage of the 
longitudinal nature of the TBIMS national database to examine trajectories of change over time. One 
study43 weighted this database to provide estimates for the US population receiving acute inpatient 
rehabilitation: by 5 years after injury, approximately one in five had died, 12% of survivors were 
living in institutional settings, and 50% had been readmitted to hospital at least once. Of those who 
survived, the majority were moderately or severely disabled and more than a third had deteriorated 
from a previously achieved level after injury. Deterioration in functional outcome was evident across 
all age groups, implying that decline is not simply age-related. 
Another study41  used individual growth curve analysis to evaluate functional status over time as 
measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE), and found that for individuals in the 
TBIMS national database as a whole, the typical trajectory was to improve gradually over time for 
about 10 years, plateau, and then decline. This method allowed covariates to be entered into the 
model to explain variability in rates and levels of improvement and decline, and factors such as age, 
 6 
 
race, injury severity and length of rehabilitation hospital stay were found to influence functional 
trajectories. Another study42 used a similar approach to compare functional outcome trajectories (as 
defined by the GOSE and Disability Rating Scale) of those who survived with those who died more 
than 5 years after injury. This study found that those who died had a worse functional status at the 
time of discharge from inpatient rehabilitation, and that they also had more rapid functional decline 
over time (figure 1).42  These findings suggest that there might be readily detectable, although 
commonly missed, opportunities to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes and to deploy 
interventions to improve their health and quality of life. 
Similar findings have been reported from long-term follow-up of patients with TBI in the cohort 
admitted to hospital in Glasgow.49 At five to seven years after injury 70% of those originally assessed 
at 1 year were re-evaluated.39 At this timepoint nearly a quarter of those alive at 1 year had died.  
Over half of survivors were still disabled on the GOSE, and, although 29% had improved, 25% had 
deteriorated between 1 year and 5-7 years after injury. Both late improvement and late 
deterioration were strongly related to self-rating of depression, anxiety, stress and self-esteem, 
rather than injury severity and cognitive impairment. Similar associations were apparent at a further 
follow-up 12 - 14 years after injury.40 Strikingly, despite the fact that the majority of the sample had 
injuries considered to be mild on the basis of Glasgow Coma Scale criteria, more than half of the 
individuals were disabled at each follow-up timepoint.  
The findings from long-term longitudinal studies suggest that changes in functional outcome are 
common even many years after TBI, and both improvement and decline can be observed. Most 
studies described in this section had no control groups; therefore, the extent to which reported 
disability is accounted for by normal aging processes is not clear. However, it appears that age is not 
solely responsible for decline,43 and impaired cognition does not seem to be the primary cause.39  
The long-term effects of mild TBI are particularly concerning, and further research is needed on this 
issue.  
The evidence from studies of adults is in accord with reports of poor long-term outcomes following 
childhood TBI.54,55 A recent population-based study56 in Sweden found that injury in childhood 
increased the risk of later disability, psychiatric illness, and premature death. Whether injury in 
children generally results in poorer outcomes than in adults is a complex issue57 that is beyond the 
scope of this Series paper.  
 7 
 
Late mortality after TBI  
Many studies have examined mortality within the first 6 months after brain injury,58 but far fewer 
studies have assessed mortality risks in the long term (table 1).28,39-48  There is consensus that 
moderate-to-severe injuries have an enhanced risk of mortality that might persist for many years, 
but a puzzling observation is that high mortality rates might be observed even after mild TBI.28 
Long-term mortality after moderate to severe TBI 
The TBIMS national database was used to examine survival status of 8,573 TBI patients who had 
received inpatient rehabilitation.27,44 This work addressed the issue of a control group by comparing 
mortality related to TBI with mortality rates of the general population, adjusted for age, sex and race 
or ethnicity. Patients with TBI were more than twice as likely to die than individuals in the general 
population (standardized mortality rate [SMR] 2.25; 95% CI 2.10 - 2.40); life expectancy was on 
average 7 years shorter. Mortality rates were increased for a variety of causes (table 1). Older age 
increased the absolute risk of death, but as found in a previous study,59 the greatest relative risk of 
death after TBI occurred in younger age groups. In those aged 15 -19 years at injury the mortality 
rate was nearly five times that of matched individuals. Younger people more commonly died 
secondary to accidental injuries, suggesting that dysexecutive symptoms might have been causal in 
mortality risk, whereas older people more frequently died for reasons suggesting chronic medical 
conditions or comorbidities.44 Multivariate predictors of mortality included disability at discharge 
and preinjury drug or alcohol abuse,27 and were found to vary by age at injury.44  
Similar results were reported in a study from New South Wales, Australia, of 2,545 patients 
discharged from rehabilitation.45,46 An enhanced risk of death in this population was observed (SMR 
3.19; 95% CI 2.80 - 3.60), particularly within the first year after injury, and this risk remained above 
population norms for at least 8 years. Predictors of mortality included functional dependence, age, 
preinjury drug and alcohol misuse, and preinjury epilepsy. Older patients were at the highest 
absolute risk of death, but the relative risk was greatest for younger adults (aged <50 years) with 
severe TBI. This group had a four-to-six times increase in risk of mortality compared with a control 
group matched for age and sex.  
Therefore, studies of well-characterized cohorts of rehabilitation patients show that moderate-to-
severe TBI carries an enhanced risk of late mortality (table 1); deaths occur from a wide variety of 
causes, some of which might be preventable. When considering estimates of risk, it should be noted 
that these estimates are based on the use of population comparison groups, with matching limited 
to a small set of demographic variables.

Long-term mortality after mild TBI  
Substantially elevated long-term death rates after mild TBI have been reported in the cohort 
admitted to hospital in Glasgow.28 Medical records of 2,428 patients who had mild head injury 15 
years previously were traced and compared with individuals without head injury in the community. 
Overall, more than a third of patients had died despite the relatively young age at injury (median 39 
years). As expected, there were more deaths in older age groups, but again when standardized 
against those without head injury the highest rates were in the younger age groups. Apart from age, 
independent predictors of mortality included preinjury factors such as habitual alcohol excess or 
drug use, previous admissions with head injury or neurological illness, previous physical limitation, 
and social deprivation. Over the follow-up period patients with TBI had a rate of subsequent head 
injury 19 times greater than those in the control group. 
The results from the Glasgow cohort contrast with those of a US population-based study47 of 1,433 
patients with predominantly mild TBI (89%) in Olmsted County, Minnesota, the geographical area 
served by the Mayo Clinic. For patients who were alive at 6 months the death rate by 10 years was 
not significantly different than expected. The findings of the Glasgow cohort28  also contrast with 
results of the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) cohort study,48  which identified 606 participants aged 
65 years or older with a history of head injury and loss of consciousness at any time in their lives, 
and included follow up assessments every 2 years after enrolment for an average of 7 years. In this 
study no association was found between history of TBI and subsequent death.48  However, a 
relationship was found between a history of TBI reported at baseline and risk of subsequent injury 
during follow up, particularly in those aged 55 years or older at the time of first injury (hazard ratio 
[HR] 3.8; 95% CI 1.89 - 7.62). Furthermore, recent TBI (i.e. injury since the previous follow-up) was 
associated with increased risk of death (adjusted HR 2.0; 95% CI 1.51 - 2.58).  
In studies of retired professional American football players, increases in overall risk of mortality were 
not observed—eg, Guskiewicz and colleagues60 studied 2,552 former American National Football 
League (NFL) players and found no evidence for elevated mortality despite the fact that about 60% 
would be expected to have a history of mild TBI.60 In another study of 3,439 former NFL players, 18 
all-cause mortality was about half that of the national population, indicating long-term health 
benefits of participation.  
The association between mild head injury and long-term mortality appears to be sample-dependent: 
in some cohorts being admitted to hospital with mild TBI serves as a marker that the person belongs 
to a high risk group,28 whereas in other cohorts this association is not apparent.42-44 Results from the 
 9 
 
Glasgow study of mild head injury28  suggest that pre-existing status and lifestyle factors, such as 
socio-economic status and risk-taking behaviour, are major determinants of mortality in this 
particular population.  
TBI as a risk factor for later neurological disease 
The possibility that TBI is associated with neurological diseases, and neurodegenerative disease in 
particular, has had substantial attention over the years, and recent studies have provided new 
evidence concerning a link. TBI disproportionally affects young adults and, despite lengthy follow-up 
periods, most of the studies described earlier have involved substantial proportions of people with 
TBI who are still at a relatively young age. Any increased risk for neurodegenerative illness 
attributable to TBI might not become fully apparent until late life: therefore studies focusing on 
older age groups or that have very long term follow-up, or both, are important (table 2). 
Neurodegenerative disease after single TBI 
Acceptance that TBI is a risk factor for dementia is growing.33 Investigators of a meta-analysis67 of 
studies done up to 2001 with an overall sample of 4,639 patients found that a history of TBI was 
associated with a two-to-four times increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease, with a dose-response 
effect- ie, risk was highest in patients with severe injury.67 Similarly, the MIRAGE study68 showed an 
increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease in patients with a history of TBI, with greater risk in patients 
reporting injury with loss of consciousness than in those without loss of consciousness. These and 
other early studies largely used case-controlled designs, and were subject to limitations including 
recall bias, reverse causation, differing definitions of TBI, potential misclassification of 
neurodegenerative disease, and inadequate control for covariates. Studies that include a greater 
number of health and lifestyle variables in the models tend to find no relationship or a weak 
relationship between TBI and dementia.69   
Addressing some of the key limitations of study design in earlier work, Gardner and colleagues 62 
used hospital databases from California, USA, to compare the incidence of all-cause dementia in 
almost 52,000 patients with TBI with that of a control population of more than 112,000 patients 
exposed to trauma without brain injury. An increased risk of dementia after a single moderate-to-
severe TBI up to 7 years later was observed; the HR adjusted for covariates was 1.26 (95% CI 1.21–
1.32). Furthermore, even a single, mild TBI increased the risk of dementia in patients aged 65 years 
or older at the time of injury (HR 1.25; 95% CI 1.20–1.31). A similar population based study from 
Taiwan compared about 45,000 patients with TBI with around 225,000 patients without TBI and 
 10 
 
reported that TBI was associated with an elevated risk of dementia (HR 1.68; 95% CI 1.57 - 1.80) 
after adjusting for demographics and comorbidities.64 
By contrast, the Adult Changes in Thought cohort study48 found no association between TBI and 
dementia or probable Alzheimer’s disease in participants aged 65 years or older reporting a history 
of head injury with loss of consciousness and no evidence of dementia at enrolment. Building on this 
work, Crane and colleagues 16 pooled data from this study and two additional prospective 
cohorts,70,71 yielding a total sample of 7,130 participants, and found no apparent association 
between TBI of different severities (loss of consciousness  >1 h or < 1 h) and clinically diagnosed all-
cause dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.16   Limitations of these studies include the use of interview 
to ascertain TBI severity, and exclusion of patients with young-onset dementia (occurring before age 
65 years). 
The risk of developing young-onset dementia after TBI was examined in a landmark study61 that 
followed up about 800,000 Swedish military recruits for up to three decades, around 45,000 of 
whom had sustained a TBI.   TBI was not associated with risk of Alzheimer’s disease. After correcting 
for covariates (including cognitive function in young adulthood and alcohol intoxication), the authors 
reported a HR for other young-onset dementia (non-Alzheimer’s disease) types of 1·7 (95% CI 1·2–
2·3) for mild TBI and 2·6 (1·6–4·1) for severe TBI. However, the absolute risk of illness was very low: 
only 0.07% of the cohort developed dementia. 
Recent studies have provided evidence for an association between TBI and Parkinson’s disease. A 
comprehensive meta-analysis by Jafari and colleagues15 of 22 studies reported a pooled odds ratio 
(OR) of 1.57 (95% CI 1.35–1.83) for risk of Parkinson’s disease after TBI. In this meta-analysis, 19 of 
the 22 studies reported an OR greater than 1.0. A well-controlled study using the California cohort63 
found that TBI sustained after 55 years of age is associated with a 44% increased risk of developing 
Parkinson’s disease within the subsequent 5-7 years. Furthermore, in their pooled analysis Crane 
and colleagues16 identified a dose-response relationship between TBI and Parkinson’s disease, with 
patients with more severe TBI having the greatest risk. These associations were present even when 
injury had occurred before the age of 25 years, suggesting processes with a protracted time course. 
However, these results are limited by the relatively small numbers of patients who developed 
Parkinson’s disease (1.6% of the sample).16  
In conclusion, the evidence favours a link between single TBI and neurodegenerative disease. The 
evidence is perhaps strongest for Parkinson’s disease,15,16 whereas an association specifically with 
Alzheimer’s disease is less certain.  Recent research has involved stronger study designs than earlier 
 11 
 
work, but they still have considerable shortcomings, with characterization of injury severity a 
weakness in all of the studies discussed. A further limitation is the absence of prospective 
neuropathological reviews of clinical diagnoses informed by current understanding of the complex 
pathology of neurodegeneration after TBI. There is a pressing need for suitably designed and 
powered studies of the association between single incident TBI and neurodegenerative illness. 
Neurodegenerative disease after repetitive mild TBI 
Exposure to repetitive mild TBI from boxing has long provided the best evidence for the association 
between such injury and risk of neurodegenerative disease.72 More recently, attention has turned to 
other groups exposed to repetitive mild TBI (table 2). In the report of 3,439 former NFL players,18 
about two thirds of whom were younger than 60 years of age, deaths due to neurodegenerative 
illness were three times higher than in the general population;  in particular deaths due to 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  and Alzheimer’s disease were increased.  However, the absolute risk 
was low:  in total only 17 deaths involved neurodegenerative illness, and in only ten individuals was 
this the principal cause of death.  Mortality overall is lower in this group, and, arguably, as noted 
above, positive effects of participation in sports on long term health73 might be at the cost of a small 
increased risk of dementia for some sports. 
Supporting a modest increase in risk of dementia, the study by Guskiewicz and colleagues60 of 2,552 
former NFL players showed a significant association between concussion and both clinically 
diagnosed mild cognitive impairment and reported memory impairment. There was a higher 
prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (1.37; 95% CI 0.98–1.56) in the study sample than in the general 
population, with the difference particularly apparent in the youngest group (aged ≤69 years), but 
these findings were not statistically robust. Again, the overall rate of Alzheimer’s disease was low: 
only 1.3% had this diagnosis.  
Studies in former rugby players66,74,75 have reported detectable, although clinically insignificant, 
neurocognitive deficits. In one study, 66 formal neuropsychological assessment findings in a cohort of 
52 retired male international rugby players who had a median of seven mild TBIs were compared 
with assessment results of matched controls with no history of repeated concussion. Rugby players 
had poorer verbal learning and fine motor co-ordination than did the control group.  
In soccer,  prevalence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis might be increased. Investigators of a study of 
7,325 former Italian professional soccer players65 found that the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
was approximately six times higher than expected for the population. The authors argue that this 
effect is specific to soccer and not simply related to exercise: increased risk of amyotrophic lateral 
 12 
 
sclerosis was absent in parallel cohorts of cyclists and basketball players.76   This finding might be a 
consequence of exposure to repetitive concussive or sub-concussive impacts, such as in heading the 
ball in soccer (ie, hitting the ball with their heads).  However, no data have been presented in 
support of functional consequences of heading beyond mild, short lived and reversible brain 
impairment.77  
Adding to historical studies of boxers, evidence of an association between repetitive TBIs and 
neurodegenerative illness in groups of athletes has now been reported,18,60 although degenerative 
illness apparently has a low prevalence in the relatively young cohorts that have been studied. 
Again, studies to date are subject to considerable limitations to study designs, including 
retrospective designs and little control for covariates.78 Moreover, progress in understanding sports 
brain injury has been hampered by inconsistent classification of TBI and by disparity in outcome 
assessments. In particular, the common division of “concussion” and “mild TBI” has been unhelpful79 
and fails to acknowledge that TBI spans a spectrum from mild TBI or concussion to severe TBI, which 
is reflected in commonality in underlying pathology33,34,80 and in lifelong health consequences.3 Little 
can be offered by way of evidence-based advice to people who have had multiple mild TBIs. 
Longitudinal studies of athletes that address gaps in evidence are a high priority.  
Stroke and other neurological disorders after TBI 
Although recent attention has focused on the association between exposure to TBI and the potential 
increased risk for various neurodegenerative diseases, such injury might also affect later risk for 
other neurological disorders. 
Results of a large scale population study22 showed a link between TBI and increased risk of stroke in 
the first 5 years after injury. At 5 years patients with TBI had 2.3 times the risk of stroke after 
adjusting for socio-demographics and comorbidities (Table 2). A similar finding has been reported for 
a cohort of 1,173,000 patients with trauma in the USA,23 of whom 37% had TBI. After adjusting for 
confounding covariates the HR was 1.31 (95% CI 1.25–1.36), potentially placing TBI as a more 
significant stroke risk factor than hypertension. An association between TBI and stroke early after 
injury is not surprising, but the mechanism underlying a persisting link has not been established.81 
Various other diseases associated with TBI have a significant influence on long-term outcomes 
including epilepsy, 20,21 neuroendocrine disorders,24 and neuropsychiatric illness, particularly 
depression.10 A detailed discussion of these conditions is beyond the scope of this Series paper.   
 13 
 
Characterisation of neurodegeneration after TBI 
Late neuropathology of TBI 
Early observations on the brains of boxers formed the basis of Corsellis and colleagues’72 landmark 
publication in 1973 describing dementia pugilistica. However, only recently has due attention been 
paid to the significance of neurodegenerative pathology after TBI, which has now been documented 
in a growing number of serendipitously observed brains from individuals exposed to such injury in a 
range of contexts, including participants in boxing, American football, ice hockey, soccer, and 
rugby;19,33,72,82-85 military personnel;86 and survivors of a single moderate or severe TBI.34,87 Reflecting 
that it is exposure to TBI that is associated with risk of late neurodegeneration, and not the sport or 
environment or, solely, injury severity and frequency, this pathology is now termed chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).34  
Notwithstanding this recent increased awareness of and attention to CTE, reports on 
neuropathology after TBI account for just more than 300 cases in the scientific literature, with many 
studies being retrospective examinations on donated brains. These studies are therefore subject to 
inevitable case selection biases and limitations in clinical evaluation. Furthermore, few pathological 
studies include adequate numbers and appropriate samples of non-injured control brains in their 
assessments to allow observations to be placed in the context of potentially confounding 
pathologies, particularly ageing associated pathology.33 Nevertheless, evidence is emerging of a 
distinctive neurodegenerative pathology88 that, within acknowledged limitations of retrospective 
studies thus far, is almost exclusive to circumstances in which there has been previous exposure to 
TBI.89  Although many reports focus on aspects of tau neuropathology in CTE,88 the pathology after 
TBI is complex and, in addition to tau, features a range of abnormalities including amyloid beta and 
TDP-43 deposition, neuroinflammation, axonal degeneration, white matter degradation, neuronal 
loss and blood-brain barrier disruption (figure 2).33,34,90-92 
Despite heterogeneity in mechanisms of closed head injury, there is increasing acknowledgment of 
common diffuse pathologies across TBI, such as diffuse axonal injury80 and blood-brain barrier 
disruption,92 which are also reflected in the neuropathology after injury, perhaps offering potential 
candidates for development of targeted therapeutic interventions.  
Although recognition of CTE beyond former boxers has increased, no operational criteria exist for its 
clinical diagnosis; currently diagnosis requires autopsy confirmation. Perhaps as a consequence, and 
because of the low numbers of autopsies in patients with neurodegenerative disease, CTE remains 
an infrequent diagnosis. Therefore, current reporting provides no insight into the prevalence of CTE. 
 14 
 
It is an unfortunate omission in research on outcomes from TBI that few studies include prospective 
neuropathology assessment. Furthermore, studies that do include neuropathology findings in 
patients with dementia after TBI, rely on archival reporting and assessments, which precede current 
understanding of the complex pathology in these patients.16 In this context, it is worth noting that 
dementia in survivors of TBI has a clinical syndrome that appears distinct from that of typical 
Alzheimer’s disease in the absence of a history of TBI, and is perhaps more in keeping with CTE.93,94  
Imaging endophenotypes of late neurodegeneration after TBI 
Neuroimaging can provide epidemiological, conceptual, and practical advances, and resolve 
uncertainties concerning the presence, extent and type of neurodegeneration in survivors of TBI. 
Pathological characterisation is confounded by several variables.  In particular the clinical relevance 
of specific neurodegenerative pathologies (such as amyloid deposition) is difficult to quantify in 
patients with TBI, because the clinical picture might be modulated by several other factors.  These 
factors include preinjury reserve,61 loss of cognitive reserve as a direct consequence of injury, 
neuroinflammation, and activation of processes that are shared with neurodegenerative diseases.  In 
view of the difficulties in relating neurodegenerative processes to clinical outcome, imaging offers 
two key approaches to identify endophenotypes of late cognitive decline.  
The first approach is use of either late, or preferably serial, MRI to characterise global or regional 
volume reduction or cortical thinning, or white matter loss measured with use of  diffusion tensor 
MRI.  Although most studies have used MRI in the acute (days to weeks) and subacute (weeks to 
months) phases after TBI, some studies have acquired MRI data later,95-97 and in a few cases, several 
years after injury. 98-100 These studies have shown that a minority of survivors of TBI display late or 
ongoing cortical or white matter loss, or both, years after injury. 
The second approach is use of molecular imaging (e.g. PET) to identify neuropathological processes 
that might be activated following TBI, and could hence provide signatures for the cognate 
neurodegenerative diseases.  Key processes that have started to be characterised in this context 
include amyloid deposition,101-105 tau deposition,104,106 and neuroinflammation.107-109  Although the 
location and progress of pathology on MRI can provide useful clues to underlying neuropathology, 
the data from molecular imaging techniques provide insights that cannot be achieved even with 
advanced MRI. 
These combined imaging advances are useful for several reasons. In an appropriate population with 
TBI, they can provide data on the prevalence of molecular neurodegenerative processes, and (on 
serial MRI) its effect on neural loss, both of which can also be tied to late neurocognitive outcome 
 15 
 
and its progression. Serial MRI also enables careful exploration of the interaction between exposure 
to injury and recognised genetic drivers of neurodegeneration in contributing to late and progressive 
cortical loss.99 These data are also important conceptually, because they allow parcellation of 
different molecular processes that underlie late cognitive decline, such as tau deposition, amyloid 
deposition, or neuroinflammation, with the promise of precision-medicine approaches to choosing 
specific therapies, if these become available.  Finally, the literature on Alzheimer’s disease suggests 
that imaging tools can provide very early characterisation of disease, at a stage at which clinical 
deterioration is undetectable.110  Given the increased risk of late neurodegeneration described in 
this Series paper, survivors of TBI represent a population that is enriched for patients at risk of 
neurodegenerative disease.  Consequently, imaging approaches in this population could be 
particularly rewarding in terms of stratifying risk of late cognitive decline and identifying the 
molecular mechanisms involved at a stage when related clinical characteristics are not yet evident.  
These tools can therefore be used in the population of survivors of TBI to select patients for clinical 
trials, provide intermediate endpoints for such trials, and where successful allow selection of 
patients for effective treatments to prevent late neurodegeneration.  
Conclusions and future directions 
Multiple lines of evidence suggest that, for many patients, TBI is a chronic, evolving, and perhaps 
lifelong disorder. This disorder manifests as altered risk not only for various neurological pathologies 
but also systemic pathologies, with associated increased morbidity and mortality, extending for 
many decades in survivors of TBI. These negative outcomes are a major concern. However, research 
to identify and quantify late outcomes from TBI has been remarkably scarce, with few studies 
including longitudinal follow-up of more than 5 years after injury. Therefore, there is an urgent need 
for further research to address the limitations of available studies, which are confounded by 
inconsistencies in definitions of injury severity and recording of outcomes and follow-up procedures, 
and by largely retrospective methods. Furthermore, heterogeneity of TBI is an important issue that 
needs to be addressed in future work: there is well recognized heterogeneity in mechanisms of 
injury and brain abnormalities, and poorly understood variability in host factors.   
In studies that have documented late outcomes after TBI, poor long-term outcomes, late 
deterioration in functional status, and high rates of mortality have been reported across the age 
range. Therefore, age-related processes do not seem to explain these findings, and, particularly in 
younger age groups, seem likely to play a limited role. Associations between TBI and higher rates of 
mortality have been identified, with predictors for both mild28 and moderate/ severe injuries27,44,45  
including pre injury factors such as alcohol and drug abuse and previous neurological illness, 
 16 
 
although severity of injury appears not to have substantial influence. These associations suggest that 
lifestyle factors play a role in poor outcome after injury, and such factors might be amenable to 
change with appropriate interventions.  
Patients discharged with moderate or severe disability are a readily identifiable group, who 
potentially have a chronic disease. Individuals living with moderate-to-severe TBI might benefit from 
a long-term health management approach with enhanced medical monitoring and supported 
proactive health-maintenance interventions. Positive long-term outcomes from injury have been 
reported where co-ordinated health care is available.111 There is a need for comparative 
effectiveness research on long-term TBI outcomes within different systems to establish optimal 
health care and interventions that parallels current assessments of acute and sub-acute care.112 
Neuropathological evidence suggests the occurrence of complex pathological changes after TBI that 
might best be described as a polypathology.17,33,91  This pathology might be superimposed on normal 
ageing or accelerate existing age-related changes.33  Many factors will influence the point at which 
clinical threshold is reached including preinjury cognitive reserve.61 By some estimates, it has been 
calculated that TBI might currently contribute to between 5% to 15% of all incident cases of 
dementia.13 As such, TBI represents not just a major contribution to neurodegenerative illness, 
which might be preventable, but also a substantial economic burden in healthcare.   
Unquestionably, the link between TBI and neurodegenerative illness warrants further study. Long-
term longitudinal studies of patients with TBI would be particularly informative.  Objective imaging 
and molecular biomarkers of neurodegeneration related to TBI are needed, because experience 
shows that such biomarkers are essential for accurate diagnosis and for targeting therapy.113 It 
would be helpful if projects assembling large prospective cohorts of patients with TBI could include 
steps to facilitate future long-term follow-up of patients. Such cohorts could provide systematic 
selection of patients for imaging studies at late points, using molecular imaging to identify 
neurodegenerative processes (essentially reflecting neuropathology in vivo) and their effect on 
progressive anatomical and microstructural changes in the brain after TBI. These data could aid the 
design and implementation of clinical trials of new therapies aimed at this cohort of patients, and 
selection of patients for therapies that emerge as successful from such evaluation.

15 years 
Mortality 
37% of patients had died by follow up at 15 
years; death rate was 24.5 per 1,000 patients 
versus 13.3 per 1000 community controls 
(ratio =1.84).  
Age was a risk factor for mortality; 
younger adults with TBI had a 4.2 times 
greater risk of death than community 
controls; in addition to age, independent 
risk factors at time of injury included 
habitual alcohol excess, number of 
previous admissions to hospital with TBI, 
preinjury physical limitations, and social 
deprivation.

then subsequently declined.  
Growth curves were influenced by age, 
race, disability at admission, and length of 
rehabilitation stay;  trajectories for those 
who died at least 5 years after injury 
began with lower functional status and 
declined more rapidly than trajectories for 
those who survived.

Mortality, life expectancy, 
cause of death 
Patients with TBI were 2.25 times more likely 
to die than the general population (adjusted 
for age, sex, and race or ethnicity). SMR was 
elevated in all subgroups (age, gender, race, 
and injury severity), and remained higher 10 
years after injury; SMR was raised for all 
causes of death, particularly seizures (33.38), 
aspiration pneumonia (13.35), sepsis (10.37), 
accidental poisonings (9.54), and falls (9.87)  
Independent risk factors for death 
included: older age, being a man, non-
Hispanic ethnicity, being unemployed or 
unmarried at injury, preinjury drug use, 
and greater disability at discharge; risk 
factors for mortality varied by age group. 
Increased deaths in younger age groups 
were mainly due to external causes and 
accidents; life expectancy in the youngest 
men was decreased by 16 years.

Mortality 
Overall mortality was 10% and patients with 
TBI were 3·19 times more likely to die than 
the general population (adjusted for age and 
sex); risk of death was increased for 8 years or 
more after discharge; SMR was raised for 
causes of death related to abnormal clinical 
and laboratory findings (14.1), respiratory 
system (10.2), nervous system (6.4), digestive 
system (5.2), mental and behavioural 
disorders (5.4), and external causes (5.2).  
Independent risk factors included disability 
at discharge, older age at injury, being a 
man, preinjury drug and alcohol misuse, 
preinjury epilepsy, and discharge to an 
aged care facility; crude mortality rates 
increased with age, but younger adults 
had the highest risk of death compared 
with population norms.

Search strategy and selection criteria 
We searched PubMed for the period Jan 1, 2010, to June 22, 2017, for papers published in English, 
with the search terms: “traumatic brain injury” or “head injury”, “long-term”, “survivors”, “follow-
up”, “mortality”, “longitudinal”, “dementia”, “Alzheimer”, “Parkinson”, and “degenerative”.  We 
identified studies concerning adults with traumatic brain injury that included follow-up to 5 years or 
more after injury. Studies were selected that addressed the central theme of long-term 
deterioration after TBI, including the topics of functional decline, mortality, and neurodegenerative 
disease. The search was supplemented by personal files and by citations in the identified articles.  
The final selection was made on the basis of relevance to the specific topics selected for the Series 
paper.

Figure 1. Longitudinal trajectories, based on data modelling, for functional outcome after inpatient 
rehabilitation for traumatic brain injury in surviving versus deceased patients.  
Trajectories are fitted curves showing expected change in functioning of patients with TBI as 
measured with the GOSE for survivors compared with those who were deceased (died >5 years after 
injury). These sample trajectories were generated with a modelling approach known as individual 
growth curve analysis with use of longitudinal data  from the TBI Model Systems national database 
from patients aged ≥ 16 years who had completed at least three study visits (ie, having survived for a 
minimum of 2 years); the curves shown represent individuals, who were white, aged 26 years when 
their first GOSE score was recorded, had 30 days  of rehabilitation, and had the same level of 
disability on admission to rehabilitation (cognitive FIM score of 11 and motor FIM score of 33). 
Although profiles vary substantially between individuals, it is evident from these examples that the 
trajectory for those who were deceased is markedly different from those who survived: those who 
were deceased started out with more disability initially—a GOSE score nearly a point below those 
who survived—and their trajectories suggest a near constant decline in function. By contrast, the 
trajectory for surviving patients shows slight improvement in outcomes, which could take many 
years to reach a peak, followed by a delayed decline from about 10 years after injury. Reproduced

Figure 2: Neuropathology after traumatic brain injury.  
Appearance of hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates within neurons and astrocytes (brown staining 
in panels A and B) clustered around small cortical vessels (arrows), characteristically in a patchy 
distribution towards the depths of cortical sulci, is emerging as the distinctive pathology of chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy. This pathology appears to be virtually exclusive to circumstances in 
which there has been exposure to brain injury in life, whether as repetitive mild TBI as shown in a  
61-year-old male former boxer (A) or single moderate or severe TBI as shown in a 48-year-old man 
with 3 years of survival after single severe TBI (B). In addition to this distinctive tau pathology, 
neurodegeneration after TBI is increasingly recognised as a complex pathology, including abnormal 
amyloid plaque deposition (brown staining in panels C and D). As with tau, aspects of these 
pathologies can be recognised in case material from patients exposed to either repetitive mild TBI as 
shown in a 59-year-old male former soccer player (C) or single moderate or severe TBI (D; same 
patient as in panel B). Phosphorylated tau using antibody CP13 (A) or PHF-1 (B). Amyloid β was
