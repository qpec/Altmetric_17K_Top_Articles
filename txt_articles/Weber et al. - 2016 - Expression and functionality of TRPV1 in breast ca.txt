Abstract: Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels contribute to the regulation of intracel-
lular calcium, which can promote cancer hallmarks in cases of dysregulation of gene transcription 
and calcium-dependent pro-proliferative or anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Several studies have 
begun to elucidate the roles of TRPV1, TRPV6, TRPM8, and TRPC1 in cancer progression; 
however, no study has examined the expression profiles of human TRP channels in breast cancer 
on a large scale. This study focused on the expression and functionality of TRPV1, a nonselective 
cation channel that was found to be expressed in different carcinoma tissues. Next-generation 
sequencing analyses revealed the expression of TRPV1 in several native breast cancer tissues, 
which was subsequently validated via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Activa-
tion of TRPV1 by its ligand capsaicin was associated with the growth inhibition of some cancer 
cell types; however, the signaling components involved are complex. In this study, stimulation 
by the TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin, of SUM149PT cells, a model system for the most aggressive 
breast cancer subtype, triple-negative breast cancer, led to intracellular calcium signals that 
were diminished by the specific TRPV1 antagonist, capsazepin. Activation of TRPV1 by cap-
saicin caused significant inhibition of cancer cell growth and induced apoptosis and necrosis. 
In conclusion, the current study revealed the expression profiles of human TRP channels in 60 
different breast cancer tissues and cell lines and furthermore validated the antitumor activity of 
TRPV1 against SUM149PT breast cancer cells, indicating that activation of TRPV1 could be 
used as a therapeutic target, even in the most aggressive breast cancer types.
Keywords: TRP channels, TRPV1, next-generation sequencing, breast cancer, apoptosis,

Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide.1 A series 
of high-throughput methods have changed cancer research and therapy.2–4 Expression 
profiling on a genomic scale led to the classification of the intrinsic subtypes of breast 
cancer, thus allowing for the prediction of disease progression and patient stratification.3 
Treatment options are highly diverse; whereas human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2 (HER2)-positive breast cancers can be targeted by specific drugs, the triple-negative 
breast cancer phenotype is defined by chromosomal instability and low expression 
levels of estrogen receptor (ER) alpha, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2, render-
ing treatment rather difficult.5 Triple-negative breast cancer is characterized by limited 
treatment options and frequent local recurrence.6
Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, which are membranous ion chan-
nels that conduct calcium and sodium ions, have been shown to influence cancer cell

growth.7,8 These channels can be activated by many stimuli, 
including temperature or pH changes in the extracellular 
space.9 TRP channels play an important role in the develop-
ment of several diseases, and one of the most investigated 
and described TRP channel is TRPV1.10 TRPV1 agonist, 
capsaicin, is capable of inducing apoptosis11,12 and inhibiting 
cancer cell growth by cell cycle arrest in many different types 
of cancer, for example, osteosarcoma, colon, and pancreatic 
cancer cells, while normal cells remained unharmed.13–17 A 
less-pungent capsaicin-like analog, RPF151, showed antitu-
mor activity in a murine breast cancer model in vivo,18 dem-
onstrating the possibility of managing the induction of pain.
In this study, we aimed, on the one hand, to elucidate the 
expression profiles of TRP channels in a large amount of 
breast cancer tissues via RNA-Seq. On the other hand, we 
analyzed the expression of TRPV1 in detail to contribute to 
the understanding of the influences of TRPV1 activation in 
novel breast cancer therapy.
Materials and methods
Tissue preparation and reverse 
transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR)
Breast cancer tissues were obtained from Dr Bonatz, 
Augusta-Krankenanstalt Bochum, and Dr Wölk, Herz-Jesu 
Klinik Dernbach. Each patient provided written consent and 
gave permission for the storage of their samples for the use in 
research and development purposes. Identities were entirely 
concealed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 
The tumor tissue samples were maintained in RNAlater. RNA 
was isolated from the tumor samples using a homogenizer 
(Precellys®; Bertin Corp., Rockville, MD, USA) with 1.4 
ceramic beads (Precellys®) and with an RNeasy Mini Kit 
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s 
protocols. cDNa synthesis was performed using the iScriptTM 
cDNA Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol 
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). RT-PCR was conducted to 
validate the expression of the detected olfactory receptors. 
PCR was performed using GoTaq qPCR Master Mix. The 
PCR included the following steps: 3 min, 95°C, 40 cycles of 
1 min at 60°C (TRPV1) and 1 min at 72°C. A Mastercycler® 
ep realplex (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) was used.
Primers are as follows:
TRPV1 – forward: CAGGGAAGACCTGTCTGCTG;
 
reverse: ACAAGCTCCTTCAGGCTGTC.
Chemicals
Capsaicin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, 
MO, USA). The inhibitor capsazepin and the TRP channel 
inhibitor ruthenium red were purchased from Abcam (Cam-
bridge, MA, USA). Ringer’s solution contained 140 mM 
NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM 
(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), at 
a pH of 7.4. The substances were prediluted in dimethyl 
sulfoxide (DMSO) prior to usage. The final concentration 
of DMSO solvent was maximally 0.1% for each experiment.
Next-generation sequencing
For standard mRNAseq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), 
we used the TruSeqTM RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 protocol 
(Illumina). HiSeq 2000 (2 × 102 bp reads) was used for RNA-
Seq. In total, 11 breast cancer tissue samples were analyzed in 
cooperation with the Cologne Center for Genomics (CCG). 
Raw data were generated for breast cancer samples in fastq 
format. Hg19 of the human genome and transcriptome was 
used to align the reads. The alignment was arranged by the 
Bowtie program included in TopHat (version 1.2.0).19 The 
output files were sorted and indexed by the SAMtools program 
in BAM format.20 The number of the aligned mRNA-Seq reads 
was calculated using the Cufflinks program,21 which uses the 
RefSeq hg19 reference transcriptome in Gene Transfer For-
mat (GTF; obtained from the USCS Genome Bioinformatic 
database, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). 
The Cufflinks program was used for the quantification of the 
relative abundance of transcripts for each gene, using the unit 
FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments 
mapped).21 For visualization of the data sets and the analysis 
of the read distribution, the Integrative Genomic Viewer was 
used (www.broadinstitute.org/igv).
Cell culture
SUM149PT cells were purchased from Asterand Bioscience 
(Detroit, MI, USA). The cells were cultivated in Roswell Park 
Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium containing 10% fetal 
bovine serum, glutamine (5%) and 100 units/mL penicillin/
streptomycin (Gibco®; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, 
MA, USA). Cultivation was performed in an incubator with 
a humidified atmosphere at 37°C in 10% CO2. SUM149PT 
cells were passaged every 3–4 days at a confluence of 85% 
using TrypLETM (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Calcium imaging
SUM149PT cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 min with 
Ringer’
s solution containing 3 mM FURA-2-AM (fura-2-ace-
toxymethyl ester; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). 
For calcium imaging experiments, the growth medium was 
replaced by extracellular medium. Fluorimetric imaging was 
performed according to the standard protocol by Spehr et al.22

TRP channels in breast cancer
SUM149PT cells were exposed to capsaicin two to three 
times for 30–60 s, depending on the experimental approach. 
The concentrations ranged from 3–10 µM to 500 µM. The 
inhibitors ruthenium red and capsazepin were co-applied at 
concentrations of 5 and 10 µM. ATP (10 µM) served as a 
control and was applied after every measurement.
Scratch assays
Scratch assays were essentially performed as described 
in the study by Busse et al.23 For stimulation, Dulbecco’s 
Modified Eagle’s Medium containing capsaicin was used at 
concentrations of 150 and 200 µM. The software TScratch 
was used to calculate the overgrowing gap relative to the 
initial scratch area.24
Proliferation assay
SUM149PT cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 103 cells 
in 96-well plates. After 24 h of cultivation, the cells were 
stimulated with RPMI + capsaicin (150 and 200 µM) and 
RPMI + 0.1% DMSO. The CyQuant® NF assay (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) was used according to the manufacturer’s 
protocol. Excitation at 485/20 nm and fluorescence detection at 
528/20 nm were measured to calculate fluorescence intensities.
Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate 
(FITC) staining
The apoptosis assay was performed by staining the 
SUM149PT cells with FITC-labeled Annexin V and prop-
idium iodide (PI), using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis 
Detection Kit (Abcam), according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. In brief, SUM149PT cells were treated with 
capsaicin (10 and 150 µM) or control for 48 h. The cells were 
washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were 
resuspended with the Annexin V binding buffer. Then, the 
cells were incubated with FITC-labeled Annexin V and PI 
for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. For detection, 
a fluorescence microscope (Axioskop; Zeiss, Oberkochen, 
Germany) was used.
Caspase assay
For the detection of apoptosis, the Caspase-3 Colorimetric 
Assay Kit by Abcam was used according to the manufacturer’
s 
protocol. SUM149PT cells were seeded and incubated on 
12 mm coverslips and placed in 24-well plates containing 
medium. The medium was replaced by medium containing 
capsaicin (150 µM) or DMSO for 14 h. Cells were fixed for 
20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and were washed 
twice with 2 mL of PBS + Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells 
were blocked for 60 min with blocking buffer (PBS, 10% 
fish gelatin, 0.5% goat serum) at room temperature. Primary 
antibody-detecting caspase-3 (diluted 1:300 in blocking solu-
tion) was incubated overnight at 4°C. Before incubation for 1 h 
with the secondary antibody (purchased from Cell Signaling) 
at 1:1000 dilution including 2 µL of 4¢,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-
indole, the cells were washed thrice with PBS + TritonX-100. 
The cells were fixed with ProLong® Gold Antifade. Analysis 
was performed with an LSM 510 Meta (Zeiss).
Immunocytochemistry
SUM149PT cells were grown on coverslips in 24-well cell cul-
ture plates. PFA at a concentration of 4% was used for fixation 
of the cells. After fixation, the cells were washed and permea-
bilized in PBS-/- + 0.1% Triton X-100. The blocking reagent 
contained phosphate buffered saline tween-20 + 1% fish gelatin 
and was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The TRPV1 
antibody was incubated overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, the 
cells were washed three times, and the secondary antibody 
coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was 
added for 45 min at room temperature. To analyze the images, 
a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope (Zeiss) was used.
Statistics
Every result was tested for normality (Shapiro–Wilk test) 
and equal variance. Normally distributed data were analyzed 
using Student’s two-tailed unpaired t-test. Data that were not 
normally distributed were analyzed by the Mann–Whitney 
U test. Every result contained at least three independent 
experiments so that the mean standard error of the mean 
is shown. Statistical significance was indicated as follows: 
*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
Results
Expression of TRP channels in breast 
cancer
Several studies have demonstrated the influence of some TRP 
channels on breast cancer cell progression.25–27 Therefore, we 
aimed to identify the expression patterns of 16 human TRP 
channels in native breast cancer tissues and cell lines, and 
we analyzed the transcriptome of 11 different breast cancer 
tissues via RNA-Seq (Figure 1). We investigated the tissue 
samples in cooperation with the CCG and generated at least 
five Mio reads for each sample, using paired-end sequencing 
analysis and reanalyzed the data sets from the NCBI archive. 
In this study, we could detect a broad range of TRP channels 
with high expression values (FPKM > 10) in different breast 
cancer tissues.

Weber et al
In addition, we reanalyzed the transcriptome data of 49 
breast cancer cell lines originating from several different 
tumor types (Figure 2) with focus on the expression of 
TRP channels. In this study, we used the innovative clas-
sification of breast cancer subtypes, revealed by extensive 
genomic analyses of breast cancer tissues and based on 
the molecular profiles of the cells, for example, luminal 
A, luminal B, basal-like, triple-negative, or BRCA1 
mutated.28,29 There were only two TRP channels expressed 
in every tissue sample, namely TRPM7 and TRPV1 
 
(Figure 2). Because TRPM7 is known to be expressed in 
a large number of different other cell types,30 it could not 
be considered a suitable, specific target for cancer therapy. 
In comparison, TRPV1 is not expressed in such a broad 
range; furthermore, it is associated with breast tumor 
growth inhibition.8,31,32 We showed the average expression 
level of TRP channels in breast cancer cell lines and the 
expression in healthy breast tissues, using data obtained 
from the Gtex database (www.gtexportal.org; Figure 2E). 
TRPV1 was overexpressed in breast cancer tissues com-
pared to normal breast tissues. Some TRP channels were 
expressed in neither tumor tissues nor healthy tissues, for 
example, TRPC5 and TRPC7. TRPA1 was differentially 
expressed; there was no expression in healthy breast tissues 
but particular expression in some luminal breast tumors. 
Another interesting TRP channel is TRPM8, which was 
not expressed in healthy breast tissues but was expressed 
in many breast cancer samples, regardless of the subgroup. 
An almost contrary effect could be observed for TRPV2, 
showing a high expression (FPKM > 6) in healthy breast 
tissues but low to almost no expression in the different 
breast cancer subtypes. Strikingly, the luminal breast cancer 
subtype showed the least expression, and in the majority of 
samples no expression existed at all.
Expression of TRPV1 in breast 
cancer cells
With an average FPKM value of 4.9, TRPV1 showed the 
highest expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells 
(Figure 3A). Therefore, we focused on the investigation of 
TRPV1 and validated the expression of TRPV1 in breast 
cancer tissue samples via RT-PCR (Figure 3).
We analyzed the function of TRPV1 in SUM149PT cells, 
which were developed from an invasive, inflammatory triple-
negative ductal carcinoma, one of the most aggressive breast 
cancer types. Figure 4 shows the self-generated RNA-Seq 
data of SUM149PT cells, as well as the expression of TRPV1 
at the mRNA and protein levels via RT-PCR and immuno-
cytochemistry, using specific TRPV1-detecting antibodies 
(Figure 4B and C).

Characterization of TRPV1 in 
SUM149PT cells
To analyze the function of TRPV1 in SUM149PT cells, we 
investigated the effect of ligand (capsaicin) stimulation. We 
conducted calcium imaging experiments and could elicit 
calcium signals at the concentration of 100 µM capsaicin 
(Figure 5A and B), which were abolished by coapplication of 
the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepin (Figure 5F). In total, 10% 
of the cells could be activated by capsaicin at the concentra-
tion of 10 µM, and ~20% of the cells showed calcium signals 
upon stimulation with 100 µM capsaicin in calcium imaging 
experiments. Next, we investigated the physiological effects of 
capsaicin by migration and proliferation assays. Stimulation 
of SUM149PT cells with capsaicin (150 µM) for 48 h induced 
a significant reduction in cell proliferation (Figure 5C). 
Furthermore, we performed scratch assays, which are used 
to analyze cell migration. When stimulated with capsaicin 
(150 µM) for 48 h, the cells showed a reduced migration into 
the gap and altered their morphology, indicating cell transi-
tion into apoptosis (Figure 5D). Therefore, we performed 
immunocytochemical staining for the detection of apoptosis 
and necrosis, using the Annexin V-FITC Kit, which allowed 
for differentiation among early apoptotic cells, necrotic cells, 
and viable cells (Figure 5E). Stimulation with capsaicin (10 and 
150 µM) induced apoptotic and necrotic cell death (Figure 5E). 
Approximately 37% of the cells became necrotic upon stimula-
tion with capsaicin (150 µM). Then, we examined whether the 
capsaicin-induced effect on cell proliferation was mediated 
by TRPV1 using the TRPV1-specific antagonist capsazepin 
(50 µM). The reduction in cell proliferation was diminished by 
the coapplication of capsaicin (50 µM) and capsazepin (50 µM) 
in comparison to capsaicin alone (Figure 5G).

Discussion
In this study, we aimed to identify the expression profiles of 
TRP channels in different breast cancer subtypes and to inves-
tigate the effect of TRPV1 ligand on breast cancer progression. 
The targeting of different TRP channels in several cancer 
types has become increasingly important, because the roles 
of TRPs in tumorigenesis and cancer progression have been 
impressively proved by the detection of assigned oncogenic 
properties for most TRPs.10 In this study, the comprehensive 
RNA-Seq analysis of 11 breast cancer tissues and 49 breast 
cancer cell lines revealed a considerable amount of data. To 
our knowledge, no studies have yet conducted a large-scale 
comparative study of the TRP expression profiles in breast 
cancer cell lines. In this study, TRPM7 showed the highest 
expression. TRPM7 is known to regulate many features of 
malignant cancers; for example, it mediates cell migration and 
invasion through the MAPK pathway in MDA-MB-435 breast 
cancer cells.26,33 Because of the broad expression of TRPM7 
also in healthy cells, it is an unsuitable target for tumor therapy. 
Other TRP channels showed differential expression; TRPA1 is 
not expressed in the healthy tissue but in some breast tumor 
tissues, especially in the luminal subtype. Analyzing the 
association between TRPA1 expression and the progression of 
luminal breast cancer will be the aim of future studies. TRPM8 
was also expressed in breast cancer tissues only, regardless of 
the molecular subtype. This finding was in accordance with 
studies describing TRPM8 as a potential cancer biomarker 
and a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.34,35 Furthermore, 
we showed the opposite expression pattern for TRPV2, which 
was highly expressed in healthy breast tissues and weakly 
expressed in breast cancer tissues. Of course, these data are 
not sufficient to draw conclusions concerning TRP channels 
as novel biomarkers for breast cancer subtypes, but they 
could serve as the basis for further investigations. TRPV1, 
a nonselective cation channel, was the second most highly 
expressed TRP channel in our data set and was detectable in all

TRP channels in breast cancer
samples. TRPV1 is known to be expressed in several different 
neoplastic tissues, such as squamous cell carcinoma of the 
tongue, hepatocellular carcinoma, or transitional carcinoma 
of the human bladder,31,36,37 and it has also been associated 
with growth and progression in breast cancer cells.27,38 In 
MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the mediation of cell death upon 
stimulation with the ligand capsaicin was demonstrated.27 
In preliminary investigations, Vercelli et al39 demonstrated a 
reduction in cell proliferation upon application of the TRPV1 
agonist capsaicin. Interestingly, even the inhibitor, capsazepin, 
showed the same effect.39 Actually, the investigation of TRPV1 
as a novel target in breast cancer is far from complete, not 
least because its functionality differs in healthy breast cells 
and cancerous cells. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the 
effect of TRPV1 in a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. 
TRPV1 showed the highest average expression in this study, 
followed by luminal and basal-like breast cancer subtypes. 
SUM149PT displayed a triple-negative breast cancer phe-
notype, defined by the absence of ER, PR, and HER2.40 This 
cancer type accounts for 15%–20% of all breast cancer cases 
and shows poor prognosis with only a 40% 5-year survival 
rate due to the insensitivity to some of the most effective 
targeted therapies available for breast cancer treatment.5,40 
We could validate the expression of TRPV1 in SUM149PT 
cells, as well as native breast cancer tissues, via RNA-Seq, 
RT-PCR, and immunocytochemical staining. The expression 
patterns of TRP channel genes in cancer suggested that TRP 
channel-mediated Ca2+ remodeling mechanisms might play 
a crucial role in tumor cell progression and survival.41 In this 
study, we observed a clearly higher expression of TRPV1 in 
breast cancer tissues and cells than in healthy breast tissues. 
For TRPV1, high expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells 
was associated with better prognosis.37 In transitional cell 
carcinoma of the bladder, the expression of TRPV1 decreased 
progressively as the cancer stage increased.31
Calcium imaging experiments revealed the functionality 
of TRPV1 in SUM149PT cells. In this study, the stimula-
tion of the cells with its ligand capsaicin led to strong cal-
cium increases in the cells, which could be diminished by 
the coapplication of the specific inhibitor capsazepin and the 
unspecific inhibitor ruthenium red. After we proved the exis-
tence and functionality of TRPV1, we conducted proliferation 
and migration analyses to investigate the long-term effects 
of capsaicin on SUM149PT cells. In a study by Sanchez 
et al,43 the role of TRPV1 in prostate cancer cell proliferation 
was analyzed. In our experiments, a significant reduction in 
cell proliferation after capsaicin stimulation was observed, 
diminished by the coapplication of capsazepin. This finding 
was in accordance with the results of Vercelli et al,43 who 
demonstrated a significant decrease in the cell growth rate 
of MCF-7 breast cancer cells upon capsaicin stimulation. 
Interestingly, Zheng et al44 furthermore showed that capsaicin 
was capable of enhancing the antineoplastic effects of pira-
rubicin, which is an analog of the antibiotic doxorubicin.45 In 
HCT116 cells, the inhibition of cell proliferation by TRPV1 
signaling was demonstrated as well.
We showed the induction of apoptosis and necrosis upon 
capsaicin stimulation, in accordance with a study of TRPV1 
in prostate cancer cells, in which its activation by capsaicin 
led to the induction of necrotic cell death.46 This induction 
led to the suggestion that activation of TRPV1 by specific 
ligands could significantly enhance breast cancer cell death, 
even in the most aggressive breast cancer subtype, triple-
negative breast cancer. The mechanisms involved leading to 
apoptosis remain elusive.
Conclusion
We conducted a meta-study of the expression patterns of 
all human TRP channels in different breast cancer subtypes 
and showed that TRPM7 and TRPV1 were the only channels 
expressed in every sample. Furthermore, TRPV1 showed the 
highest average expression in triple-negative breast cancer 
subtypes. Analyzing channel activation, we demonstrated 
anti-proliferative, anti-migratory and apoptosis/necrosis-
inducing effects of capsaicin treatment due to the activation 
of TRPV1 in SUM149PT cells, which is a model system for 
triple-negative inflammatory breast cancer, the most aggres-
sive breast cancer subtype.
