2016.—Gut dysbiosis has been linked to cardiovascular diseases
including hypertension. We tested the hypothesis that hypertension
could be induced in a normotensive strain of rats or attenuated in a
hypertensive strain of rats by exchanging the gut microbiota between
the two strains. Cecal contents from spontaneously hypertensive
stroke prone rats (SHRSP) were pooled. Similarly, cecal contents
from normotensive WKY rats were pooled. Four-week-old recipient
WKY and SHR rats, previously treated with antibiotics to reduce
the native microbiota, were gavaged with WKY or SHRSP microbi-
ota, resulting in four groups; WKY with WKY microbiota (WKY
g-WKY), WKY with SHRSP microbiota (WKY g-SHRSP), SHR
with SHRSP microbiota (SHR g-SHRSP), and SHR with WKY
microbiota (SHR g-WKY). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was mea-
sured weekly using tail-cuff plethysmography. At 11.5 wk of age
systolic blood pressure increased 26 mmHg in WKY g-SHRSP
compared with that in WKY g-WKY (182 � 8 vs. 156 � 8 mmHg,
P � 0.02). Although the SBP in SHR g-WKY tended to decrease
compared with SHR g-SHRSP, the differences were not statistically
significant. Fecal pellets were collected at 11.5 wk of age for identi-
fication of the microbiota by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA
gene. We observed a significant increase in the Firmicutes:Bacte-
roidetes ratio in the hypertensive WKY g-SHRSP, as compared with
the normotensive WKY g-WKY (P � 0.042). Relative abundance of
multiple taxa correlated with SBP. We conclude that gut dysbiosis can
directly affect SBP. Manipulation of the gut microbiota may represent
an innovative treatment for hypertension.
microbiota; dysbiosis; hypertension; spontaneously hypertensive rat;
short chain fatty acids
IN THE PAST DECADE it has become increasingly apparent that an
imbalance of the microbiota (dysbiosis) in the gut has patho-
logical effects beyond the gastrointestinal system. For exam-
ple, gut dysbiosis has been shown to be an underlying cause or
strongly associated with obesity, insulin resistance, cancer, and
central nervous system disorders to include anxiety, depres-
sion, autism spectrum disorders, and multiple sclerosis (3, 11,
15, 22, 24, 29, 32). While the evidence linking gut dysbiosis to
pathological states is convincing, the mechanism(s) for this
link are not well understood in most cases. One well-charac-
terized association involves gut microbiota in the development
of atherosclerosis. Bacteria in the gut metabolize choline and
L-carnitine in food to trimethylamine (14, 21). The trimeth-
ylamine crosses the gut-epithelial barrier where it is carried
via the portal circulation to the liver. In the liver, trimeth-
ylamine is subsequently metabolized to trimethylamine N-oxide,
a proatherogenic molecule. Thus, a “diet-microbe-host interac-
tion” can act to promote atherosclerosis and potentially other
cardiovascular diseases (4).
Although numerous articles have speculated or discussed a
potential role for gut dysbiosis in the development of other
cardiovascular diseases, relatively few studies have addressed
this issue directly. Several animal models of hypertension and
a small cohort of humans suggests that gut dysbiosis is asso-
ciated with hypertension (16, 17, 23, 33). Durgan et al. (8)
demonstrated a causal role of the gut microbiota in the devel-
opment of obstructive sleep apnea-induced hypertension in rats
fed a high-fat diet. One potential link between dysbiosis and
hypertension can involve bacterially produced short chain fatty
acids (SCFAs), which appear to have a role in regulating blood
pressure by acting on various G protein coupled receptors (27).
In addition the SCFA butyrate has beneficial effects in the gut
wall including maintaining gut barrier integrity and influencing
intestinal inflammation (2, 6). Interestingly, bacteria that pro-
duce butyrate are decreased in animal models of hypertension
(8, 33). Further evidence for a dysbiosis-hypertension link
comes from studies showing that supplementing the diet with
probiotics (beneficial microorganisms found in the gut) can
have modest effects on blood pressure, especially in hyperten-
sive models (12, 20).
One of the most highly studied animal models of hyperten-
sion is the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), a strain
developed by breeding Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) with high
blood pressure (25, 26). The SHR begins to develop hyperten-
sion around 6–8 wk of age and plateaus near 200 mmHg
systolic blood pressure by ~15 wk. As mentioned above Yang
et al. (33) reported that the SHR demonstrate gut dysbiosis
when compared with the WKY parent strain. If dysbiosis is a
component of this genetic model for hypertension, we reasoned
that hypertension could be induced in a normotensive strain
(WKY) of rats or attenuated in a hypertensive strain (SHR) of
rats by exchanging the gut microbiota between the two strains.
Thus, we tested the hypothesis that hypertension can be in-
duced or attenuated by controlling the gut microbiota in SHR
and WKY rats.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition,
published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and were ap-
proved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Baylor
College of Medicine, Houston, TX. All rats had ad libitum access to
normal rat chow (LabDiet 5V5R, St. Louis, MO) and water through-
out the study.
Gut microbiota transplant. Cecal and colon contents were collected
and pooled from 4 WKY rats (9 wk of age) after isoflurane anesthe-
sia and decapitation. Similarly, cecal and colon contents were col-
lected and pooled from 4 stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive
rats (SHRSP) (19 wk of age). We used stroke-prone rats, a substrain
of the SHR, as donors since we have an established in-house colony
(derived from Charles Rivers stock). We reasoned that gut dysbiosis
should be fully developed by 19 wk of age, a time when hypertension
has plateaued and stabilized. The WKY donor rats were also bred
in-house. Each of the pooled samples was diluted 1:20 in sterile PBS
and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant from each
pooled sample was aliquoted and frozen at �80°C.
Recipient WKY and SHRs, received from Charles Rivers (Hous-
ton, TX) at 3.5 wk of age, were housed in a satellite facility with a 12
h light (6 AM–6 PM): 12 h dark (6 PM–6 AM) cycle. To reduce the
native microbiota load, allowing for easier colonization of gavaged
microbiota, recipient WKY and SHRs (4.5 wk of age) were orally
gavaged with 1 ml of a broad spectrum antibiotic cocktail consisting
of ampicillin, gentamycin, metronidazole, neomycin (each at 0.25
mg/ml), and vancomycin (0.125 mg/ml) once daily for 10 consecutive
days (8). Following antibiotic treatment, quantitative PCR measure-
ment of the 16S rRNA gene was performed to ensure that the effects
of antibiotics on the microbiota was similar between WKY and SHRs.
16s rRNA gene copy number was found to be 4.4�106 � 2.5�105
and 4.9�106 � 3.1�105 for WKY and SHR, respectively, and not
significantly different between strains. Two days after the last antibi-
otic administration, 750 �l of the cecal/colonic supernatant was
gavaged into the recipient rats daily for 4 consecutive days and
weekly thereafter. Cecal/colonic supernatant from the SHRSP donors
was gavaged into WKY and SHRs. In a similar manner, cecal/colonic
supernatant from the WKY donors was gavaged into WKY and SHRs
(n � 6 to 7/group). In addition to the above rats, 6 SHR and 6 WKY
rats were gavaged as described above but the antibiotic cocktail and
the donor supernatant was replaced by PBS. The groups of rats
involved in the study are shown in Table 1.
Blood pressure measurements. Beginning at 6.5 wk, before the first
microbiota gavage treatment, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was
measured using a six channel CODA high-throughput (Kent Scien-

 tific, Torrington, CT) tail-cuff blood pressure system. SBP was as-
sessed every 7–10 days for 7 wk, and a final measurement taken at
16.5 wk old. Rats were acclimatized to the system for 2 wk before the
initial measurement. While tail-cuff measurement does not provide
the same resolution as telemetry, we have demonstrated that SBP
values obtained using the CODA tail-cuff system are highly compa-
rable and not significantly different than direct arterial measurements
made in the same rat at the same time of day (Durgan DJ, unpublished
observations).
Gut microbiota analysis. The gut microbiota was analyzed as
previously described (8). In brief, fecal samples were collected in
sterile tubes at 11.5 wk of age and stored at �80°C. DNA was
extracted using MO BIO PowerMag Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO
Laboratories), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 16S rRNA
gene sequence libraries were generated using the V4 primer region on
the Illumina MiSeq platform by the Center for Metagenomics and
Microbiome Research at the Baylor College of Medicine. Using the
quality trimming features in QIIME (v.1.7.0), we removed 16S rRNA
gene sequences with ambiguous base calls or having quality scores
�20 (7). After barcodes and primers were trimmed, all remaining
reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by
closed-reference OTU-picking with a 97% similarity threshold using
the UCLUST algorithm and Greengenes reference database (v13.5) as
implemented in QIIME (9). OTU identities were assigned using the
Greengenes (v13.5) database and a confidence score of � 97%. All
16S rRNA gene sequence libraries were randomly subsampled to
20,700 sequences per sample and singletons removed before down-
stream analysis, including the calculation of diversity indices and
comparison of relative abundances.
Linear discriminate analysis effect size. Linear discriminate anal-
ysis effect size (LEFSe) analysis was performed through the Hutten-
hower laboratory galaxy site (https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/
galaxy) using subsampled 16S rRNA gene sequence data (without
prescreening) isolated from fecal samples (described above). The
LEFSe algorithm was used to identify taxa characterizing the differences
between two groups (e.g., WKY g-WKY vs. WKY g-SHRSP) (30).
Targeted metabolomics analysis. Feces from 10 wk old WKY
g-WKY, WKY g-SHRSP, SHR g-WKY, and SHR g-SHRSP rats
were submitted to the Metabolomics Core at Baylor College of
Medicine for processing and analysis. A panel of 11 metabolites,
including SCFAs, neurotransmitters, and amino acids was measured.
SCFAs in feces were quantitated using a standard curve generated by
labeled SCFAs, while neurotransmitters and amino acids are pre-
sented as fold change relative to WKY g-WKY. All samples were

olites were identified by their unique multiple reaction monitoring
transition, and analysis carried out using MassHunter (Agilent).
Statistics. Line and bar plot data are expressed as means � SE. For
analyzing the change in blood pressure, we used a three-way ANOVA
and a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. The later was followed
by a Holm-Sidak test for individual comparisons when appropriate.
Spearman rank order correlation was used to examine potential
relationships between taxa relative abundance and SBP. For micro-
biome analysis, alpha- and beta-diversity indexes were calculated in
QIIME. Normality was evaluated by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Two-way
analysis of variance was performed followed by Holm-Sidak post hoc
analysis when main effects were found to be significant. Differences
were considered statistically significant if P � 0.05.
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows SBP as a function of age in SHR and WKY
rats gavaged with only PBS (see Table 1 for groups). As
expected SHRs developed hypertension that plateaued between
11 and 13 wk. SBP in the WKY rats increased slightly over the
course of 10 wk but remained significantly less than SHRs.
Figure 2 demonstrates changes in SBP of WKY and SHRs
gavaged with the two donor contents. A three-way ANOVA of
all four groups during the 10 wk represented in Fig. 2A
revealed significant differences in strain (P � 0.001), donor
gavage (P � 0.001), and age (P � 0.001). When we considered
SBP in the WKY rats from 7.5 wk to 16.5 wk (i.e., all time
points with microbiota gavage treatment), a two-way repeated-
measures ANOVA revealed a significant increase in SBP in
WKY g-SHRSP compared with WKY g-WKY (Fig. 2, P �
0.028). The mean SBP in WKY rats between the ages of 7.5
and 16.5 wk was 178 � 3 and 161 � 2 mmHg for those
gavaged with SHRSP and WKY contents, respectively, with
the greatest difference (26 mmHg) occurring at 11.5 wk (Fig.
2, P � 0.02). Thus, hypertension developed in WKY g-SHRSP
compared with WKY g-WKY.
Figure 2 also shows the SBP of SHRs with different ga-
vages. While there was a tendency for SBP to decrease in SHR
g-WKY (with the exception of 13.5 wk) this decrease was not
statistically significant. The mean SBP for SHR between 7.5
and 16.5 wk was 194 � 7 and 186 � 7 for those gavaged with
SHRSP and WKY contents, respectively (Fig. 2B).
We next sought to examine the microbiota composition of
WKY and SHR gavaged with native or transplanted microbi-
ota. Figure 3 demonstrates the effects of genotype and gavage
contents on measures of alpha (Fig. 3, A and B) and beta
diversity (Fig. 3C). The Chao1 richness index, a measure of the
total number of distinct genera in a sample, was not signifi-
cantly different between genotypes or altered by the type of
gavage (Fig. 3A). The Shannon diversity index, which takes
into account richness and abundance, was significantly differ-
ent depending on the type of gavage and significantly elevated
in WKY g-SHRSP as compared with WKY g-WKY (Fig. 3B).
UniFrac and principle coordinate analyses were used to calcu-
late and visualize measurements of distance between each
sample, with more similar samples clustering closely together.
The three-dimensional scatter plot in Fig. 3C illustrates a
separation of two groups that is dependent on the gavaged
microbiota. WKY g-WKY cluster closely with SHR g-WKY,
while WKY g-SHRSP microbiota cluster more closely with
SHR g-SHRSP microbiota. It is worth noting that the two
groups receiving SHRSP microbiota cluster more tightly as
compared with those receiving the WKY microbiota (Fig. 3C).
Also shown is the location of the pooled cecal contents super-
natant from WKY and SHRSP used for gavage treatments.
An increase in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes (F:B) ratio,
resulting from increased abundance of the phylum Firmicutes
along with a decrease in Bacteroidetes, is a well-established
marker of gut dysbiosis and associated with numerous pathol-
ogies (10). Figure 4A illustrates the relative abundance of the
major phyla present in the gut of WKY and SHRs after
microbiota gavage treatments. Compared with WKY g-WKY,
WKY g-SHRSP had a significantly decreased abundance of
Bacteroidetes, increased Firmicutes abundance, and increased
F:B ratio (Fig. 4B). The F:B ratio of WKY g-SHRSP was not
significantly different from the SHR g-SHRSP. These data

 suggest that, at the phylum level, the microbiota of WKY rats
could be “switched” to resemble an SHRSP. However, trans-
plantation of the WKY microbiota into the SHR genotype
appeared less effective, with the F:B ratio of SHR g-WKY not
significantly different than SHR g-SHRSP (Fig. 4B).
Figure 5 shows the bacterial taxa that were altered by gavage
treatment in the WKY (Fig. 5A) and SHR (Fig. 5B) genotypes,
calculated by LEFSe analysis (30). The fold change in relative
abundance (to the log10), vs. the alternative gavage treatment
of statistically significant taxa are depicted on the horizontal
axis. On the WKY background WKY and SHRSP gavages
resulted in 25 and 21 taxa that were highly characteristic of the
respective gavage (Fig. 5A). On the SHR background WKY
and SHRSP gavages resulted in 9 and 7 taxa that were
characteristic of the respective gavage (Fig. 5B). In Fig. 5C the
taxa found to be significantly different due to gavage treat-
ments (Fig. 5, A and B) are visualized in cladograms. In each
cladogram the hierarchal position of taxa can be seen, with the
inner circle of nodes representing phyla and the outer nodes
representing genera. Visualizing the taxa characteristic to
WKY g-WKY (green) or WKY g-SHRSP (red) in a cladogram
illustrates a distinct separation of gut microbiota composition
on the WKY background (Fig. 5Ci). On the SHR background
not only were fewer taxa characteristic of gavage treatment
(Fig. 5B), but those that were did not clearly segregate on the
cladogram (Fig. 5Cii). Further analysis of genera that were
highly characteristic of either WKY or SHRSP gavage treat-
ment led us to examine the relative abundance of the sulfur-
reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio. Desulfovibrio was found to
account for 0.4 and 0.2% of the 16S rRNA sequences in WKY
g-SHRSP and SHR g-SHRSP, respectively. Interestingly, De-
sulfovibrio appears unique to the SHRSP microbiota as it was
undetectable in either strain receiving WKY gavage treatments
(Fig. 5D).
Fig. 5. Gavage treatments alter the relative abundance of multiple bacterial taxa. Linear discriminate analysis effect size (LEFSe) analysis was used to calculate
a linear discriminate analysis (LDA) score for taxa that characterize WKY vs. SHRSP gavage treatment of WKY rats (A), WKY vs. SHRSP gavage treatment
of SHR rats (B). Positive LDA scores indicate the enrichment of taxa in g-WKY (green) relative to g-SHRSP (red), and negative LDA scores indicate the
depletion of taxa in g-WKY relative to g-SHRSP. Given this relationship, the negative LDA scores can also be interpreted as enrichment in g-SHRSP (red)
relative to g-WKY (green). C: taxa found to be significantly different by LEFSe analysis (from A and B) are shown in cladograms to illustrate the phylogenetic
relationship between altered taxa. Nodes labeled alpha-numerically in C correspond to the labels in parenthesis in A and B. D: relative abundance of the genus

 We next examined any potential relationships between bac-
terial taxon abundance and SBP at 11.5 wk, the time point
when fecal samples were collected. While there are only a
limited number of studies examining the role of the microbiota
in hypertension, our laboratory and others have demonstrated
increased lactate-producing bacteria present in various models
of hypertension (8, 33). Consistent with previous studies we
observed a strong positive correlation (R � 0.6, P � 0.00013)
between the lactate-producing genus Lactobacillus and SBP,
with SHR g-SHRSP exhibiting a twofold increase in Lactoba-
cillus as compared with WKY g-WKY (Fig. 6A). Previous
studies have also demonstrated diminished acetate- and bu-
tyrate-producing taxa in numerous models of hypertension (8,
33). We observed a strong negative correlation between abun-
dance of the family Clostridiaceae (R � �0.632, P �
0.00045), known to include numerous butyrate-producing gen-
era, and SBP (Fig. 6B). Similarly, relative abundance of the
acetate-producing genera Holdemania (R � �0.483, P �
0.011) and Coprobacillus (R � �0.39, P � 0.044) were neg-
atively correlated with SBP, with greatest abundance in WKY
g-WKY (Fig. 6, C and D). Of interest, it is obvious in each
panel of Fig. 6 that WKY g-SHRSP clusters closely with SHR
g-SHRSP, while SHR g-WKY more closely associates with
SHR g-SHRSP; further evidence that shifting the microbiota
was more proficient on the WKY background.
In an effort to identify metabolites that may be linked to
hypertension we examined a panel of 11 metabolites in feces
isolated from WKY and SHR gavaged with WKY or SHRSP
microbiota. This targeted metabolomics panel included SCFAs,
neurotransmitters, and amino acids. Despite observed differ-
ences in 16S rRNA sequences that would suggest alterations in
SCFA production [Fig. 5 and (33)], two-way ANOVA revealed
no significant differences in acetate, propionate, or butyrate
due to genotype or gavage treatment (Fig. 7A). Similarly, there
were no significant differences in the measured neurotransmit-
ters or amino acids due to genotype or gavage treatment (Fig.
7, B and C).
DISCUSSION
The influence of the gut microbiota extends well beyond the
gastrointestinal tract. In the current study we tested the hypoth-
esis that the gut microbiota of SHRs contributes to the hyper-
tensive phenotype. To address this hypothesis we utilized
Koch’s third postulate, which states that if a microorganism(s)
contributes to disease, then transferring the microorganism(s)
to a healthy organism should induce disease. In these studies
we demonstrate that, indeed, transferring microorganisms (i.e.,
cecal contents) induced the disease state, hypertension. We
report three major findings in the present study: 1) The gut
microbiota of SHRSP is dysbiotic and significantly different
than the microbiota of WKY rats; 2) The SHRSP microbiota is
capable of increasing SBP in otherwise normotensive rats; 3)
the efficiency by which a microbiota can be altered by gavage
transplants varies depending on the host.
Through the use of gut microbiota transplantations we have
previously demonstrated a causal role for gut dysbiosis in
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-induced hypertension (8). Us-
ing a similar strategy in this study, we demonstrate that
transplantation of the SHRSP microbiota into WKY rats results
in significant increases in blood pressure, as compared with
WKY rats transplanted with their native WKY microbiota (Fig.
2). We have now demonstrated, in two separate models (i.e.,
SHR and OSA), that the gut microbiota plays a causal role in
the development of hypertension. It is worth noting that while
the SBP of WKY g-SHRSP is significantly greater than WKY

 g-WKY, it is still lower than SHR g-SHRSP. This suggests that
numerous mechanisms, one of which appears to be gut dys-
biosis, are influencing the hypertensive phenotype of SHR and
SHRSP.
We also tested the hypothesis that hypertension would be
attenuated in SHR gavaged with WKY microbiota. While there
was a slight trend for lower blood pressure in SHR gavaged
with WKY microbiota, as compared with SHR gavaged with
SHRSP microbiota, this did not reach statistical significance.
Efficiency of the microbiota transplantations (discussed below)
may have contributed to the lack of SBP improvement in SHR
gavaged with a WKY microbiota.
We demonstrate that the composition of the WKY and
SHRSP donor contents are clearly different as noted by the
UniFrac and principal coordinate analysis (red and blue points
in Fig. 3C). Furthermore, principle coordinate analysis dem-
onstrates that gavaging WKY rats with SHRSP microbiota
successfully “switched” the WKY microbiota to resemble that
of an SHRSP (Fig. 3C). However, switching the microbiota of
SHR to resemble the WKY donor proved less successful. The
inability to alter the microbiota of SHR to resemble the WKY
is shown in Figs. 3–5, but most obvious in Fig. 3C, where there
is still separation between WKY and SHR recipients gavaged
with WKY microbiota (noted by dashed line). Therefore we
cannot draw conclusions that rely on SHR with a WKY
microbiota.
An increase in the F:B ratio is considered a hallmark of gut
dysbiosis and observed in multiple disease states. We observe
an increased F:B ratio in WKY g-SHRSP, as compared with
WKY g-WKY, caused by an increase in the relative abundance
of Firmicutes and a decrease of Bacteroidetes (Fig. 4). Addi-
tionally, on the WKY background a number of taxa were found
to be characteristic of either g-WKY or g-SHRSP (Fig. 5). The
genera Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, which are generally
considered beneficial taxa, were associated with the normoten-
sive WKY microbiota. Of interest, the genus Adlercreutzia,
showed an increased abundance in the WKY microbiota.
Adlercreutzia metabolizes epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) to
metabolites that inhibit angiotensin-I converting enzyme, in-
crease endothelial nitric oxide production, and decrease blood
pressure (13, 28, 31). Additionally, the genus Desulfovibrio,
which reduces sulfate to hydrogen sulfide (H2S), was present in
both groups receiving the SHRSP microbiota and absent in
groups receiving WKY microbiota (Fig. 5). Notably, H2S
inhibits epithelial oxidation of butyrate, the primary energy
source for colonic epithelium, which has been shown to lead to
impaired gut barrier function and inflammation (1, 19).
When examining potential relationships between taxon
abundance and SBP, we observed a strong positive correlation
between SBP and the lactate-producing genus Lactobacillus
(Fig. 6A). While a potential link between lactate and blood
pressure regulation is not fully understood, plasma lactate
levels have been shown to be associated with an increase in
blood pressure (18). We also observed negative correlations
between SBP and the abundance of the SCFA-producing Clos-
trideaceae (butyrate producers), Holdemania, and Coprobacil-
lus (acetate producers) (Fig. 6, B–D). Similar shifts in SCFA
and lactate-producing bacteria have been reported in the SHR,
ANG II infusion, and OSA-induced hypertension models (8,
33). Given the importance of SCFA production in maintaining
gut barrier function and reducing gut wall inflammation, we
measured SCFA concentrations in feces from WKY and SHR
rats gavaged with WKY or SHRSP microbiota (6). However,
no significant differences were observed in acetate, propionate,
or butyrate in the feces of any groups (Fig. 7A). Additionally,
there were no significant differences between any groups in a
panel of eight selected neurotransmitters and amino acids (Fig.
7, B and C). However, it is worth noting that fecal concentra-
tions of SCFAs, and likely other bacterial metabolites, do not
reflect concentrations in the cecum or other intestinal regions
(5). Therefore, we cannot rule out that intestinal SCFA con-
centrations, or other metabolites, correlate with changes in
SBP.
In summary, the gut microbiota in a hypertensive strain of
rats (SHRSP) is sufficient to produce increased blood pressure
in its normotensive parent strain (WKY). Thus, our studies
provide strong evidence that the gut microbiota has a causal
role in the development of hypertension. The fact that hyper-
tension can be induced by altering the microbiome in the WKY
rats provides further evidence for the continued study of the
microbiota in the development of hypertension in humans and
supports a potential role for probiotics as treatment for hyper-
tension (12, 20).
