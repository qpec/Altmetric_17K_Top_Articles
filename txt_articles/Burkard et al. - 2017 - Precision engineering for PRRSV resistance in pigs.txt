Abstract
Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is a panzootic infectious disease
of pigs, causing major economic losses to the world-wide pig industry. PRRS manifests dif-
ferently in pigs of all ages but primarily causes late-term abortions and stillbirths in sows and
respiratory disease in piglets. The causative agent of the disease is the positive-strand RNA
PRRS virus (PRRSV). PRRSV has a narrow host cell tropism, limited to cells of the mono-
cyte/macrophage lineage. CD163 has been described as a fusion receptor for PRRSV,
whereby the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain 5 (SRCR5) region was shown to be
an interaction site for the virus in vitro. CD163 is expressed at high levels on the surface of
macrophages, particularly in the respiratory system. Here we describe the application of
CRISPR/Cas9 to pig zygotes, resulting in the generation of pigs with a deletion of Exon 7 of
the CD163 gene, encoding SRCR5. Deletion of SRCR5 showed no adverse effects in pigs
maintained under standard husbandry conditions with normal growth rates and complete
blood counts observed. Pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and peripheral blood
monocytes (PBMCs) were isolated from the animals and assessed in vitro. Both PAMs and
macrophages obtained from PBMCs by CSF1 stimulation (PMMs) show the characteristic
differentiation and cell surface marker expression of macrophages of the respective origin.
Expression and correct folding of the SRCR5 deletion CD163 on the surface of macro-
phages and biological activity of the protein as hemoglobin-haptoglobin scavenger was con-
firmed. Challenge of both PAMs and PMMs with PRRSV genotype 1, subtypes 1, 2, and 3
and PMMs with PRRSV genotype 2 showed complete resistance to viral infections
assessed by replication. Confocal microscopy revealed the absence of replication structures
in the SRCR5 CD163 deletion macrophages, indicating an inhibition of infection prior to
gene expression, i.e. at entry/fusion or unpacking stages.

 Author summary
Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome is an endemic infectious disease of pigs,
manifesting differently in pigs of different ages but primarily causing late-term abortions
and stillbirths in sows and respiratory disease in piglets. The causative agent of the disease
is the positive-strand RNA PRRS virus (PRRSV). PRRSV only infects a specific subset of
cells of the innate immune system of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Previous
research found that the virus needs a specific receptor, CD163, in order to make its own
membrane fuse with the host cell membrane in an uptake vesicle to release the viral
genetic information into the cytosol and achieve a successful infection. CD163 has a
pearl-on-a-string structure, whereby the “pearl”/ domain number 5 was found to interact
with the virus and allow it to infect a cell. Here we describe how we generated pigs lacking
the CD163 subdomain 5 using so-called CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in zygotes. The pigs
were healthy under normal husbandry conditions and other biological functions con-
ducted by the CD163 were found to be intact. We isolated a variety of monocyte and mac-
rophage cells from these pigs and found them to be completely resistant to PRRSV
infection.
Introduction
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically
important infectious diseases affecting pigs worldwide. The “mystery swine disease” was first
observed almost simultaneously in North America and in Europe in the late 1980s [1,2]. The
causative agent of PRRS was identified to be a virus later named PRRS virus (PRRSV). Infected
pigs may present with symptoms involving inappetence, fever, lethargy, and respiratory dis-
tress. However, the most devastating effects of PRRSV infection are observed in young piglets
and pregnant sows. In pregnant sows an infection with PRRSV can cause a partial displace-
ment of the placenta, leading to full abortions or to death and mummification of fetuses in
utero [3]. Late-term abortions occur in up to 30% of infected sows with litters containing up to
100% stillborn piglets. Live-born piglets from an antenatal infection are often weak and display
severe respiratory symptoms, with up to 80% of them dying on a weekly basis pre-weaning
[4,5]. Young piglets infected with PRRSV often display diarrhea and severe respiratory distress
caused by lesions in the lung. In pre-weaned piglets the infection may be transmitted via the
mammary gland secretions of an infected sow [6]. At this age the infection has a fatal outcome
in up to 80% of animals. After weaning mortality rates reduce, but continued economic losses
due to reduced daily gain and feed efficiency are often observed [4,7,8]. Due to reduction or
loss of pregnancies, death in young piglets, and decreased growth rates in all PRRSV infected
pigs it is estimated that more than $650m are lost annually to pork producers in the United
States alone [9,10].
PRRSV is an enveloped, plus-strand RNA virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family in the
order Nidovirales [11,12]. The PRRSV genome (~15 kb) encodes at least 12 non-structural and
seven structural proteins. The viral RNA is packaged by the nucleocapsid protein N, which is
surrounded by the lipoprotein envelope, containing the non-glycosylated membrane proteins
M and E, as well as four glycosylated glycoproteins GP2, GP3, GP4, and GP5, whereby GP2, 3,
and 4 form a complex [13–17].
PRRSV has a very narrow host range, infecting only specific subsets of porcine macro-
phages [18–20]. It is unknown yet how widespread PRRSV infections are within the superfam-
ily of the Suoidea. Whereby European wild boars have been shown to act as a reservoir for

 PRRSV [21], little is known about infection in African suids, such as bushpigs and warthogs.
In vitro virus replication is supported by the African Green Monkey cell line MARC-145.
Entry of PRRSV into macrophages has been shown to occur via pH-dependent, receptor medi-
ated endocytosis [22,23]. Various attachment factors and receptors have been indicated to be
involved in the PRRSV entry process (reviewed in [24]). Heparan sulphate was identified early
as an attachment factor of the virus [25–27]. In vitro infection of pulmonary alveolar macro-
phages (PAMs) but not MARC-145 cells was shown to be inhibited by an antibody targeting
CD169 (sialoadhesin), a lectin expressed on the surface of macrophages [28]. Overexpression
of CD169 in previously non-permissive PK-15 cells showed internalization but not productive
replication of PRRSV [29]. Finally, an in vivo challenge of genetically modified pigs in which
the CD169 gene had been knocked out revealed no increased resistance to PRRSV infection,
suggesting that CD169 is an attachment factor that is not essential for PRRSV infection [30].
Even though cell surface protein expression is a major determinant of PRRSV binding and
internalization, there appears to be a redundancy amongst cell surface attachment factors, with
the potential for additional, as yet unidentified receptors, being involved [31]. The scavenger
receptor CD163, also known as haptoglobin scavenger receptor or p155, is expressed on spe-
cific subtypes of macrophages and has been identified as a fusion receptor for PRRSV. The
extracellular portion of CD163 forms a pearl-on-a-string structure of nine scavenger receptor
cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains and is anchored by a single transmembrane segment and a
short cytoplasmic domain [32]. CD163 has a variety of biological functions, including mediat-
ing systemic inflammation and the removal of hemoglobin from blood plasma (reviewed in
[33,34]). Overexpression of CD163 renders non-susceptible cells permissive to PRRSV infec-
tion [35], whereby it was found that CD163 does not mediate internalization but is crucial for
fusion [36]. The transmembrane anchoring and an interaction with the SRCR domain 5
(SRCR5) of CD163 were found to be essential for successful infection with PRRSV [34,35].
Recent in vivo experiments with CD163 knock-out pigs confirmed that CD163 is required for
PRRSV infection [37]. However, as CD163 has important biological functions the complete
knockout could have a negative physiological impact on the animal, particularly with respect
to inflammation and/or infection by other pathogens. Interestingly, whereas all the other eight
SRCR domains have been shown to be involved in different biological functions, no specific
role has been associated with SRCR5, other than in PRRSV infection [34]. Therefore, this
study aimed to generate pigs with a defined CD163 SRCR5 deletion and to assess the suscepti-
bility of macrophages from these pigs to PRRSV infection.
Results
Generation of live CD163 SRCR5 deletion pigs by CRISPR/Cas9 editing
in zygotes
The CD163 gene is not correctly represented in the current pig reference genome sequence
(Sscrofa10.2) [38]. Through targeted sequencing we established a detailed model of the porcine
CD163 locus (S1 File). Briefly, CD163 is encoded by 16 exons with exons 2–13 predicted to
encode the SRCR domains of the protein [39]. Interestingly, SRCR5 is predicted to be encoded
by one single exon, namely exon 7 (Fig 1A). Thus, an editing strategy was developed to excise
exon 7 using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system [40,41]. A combination of two guide
RNAs, one located in the intron 5’ to exon 7 and one in the short intron between exons 7 and
8 was predicted to generate a deletion of exon 7, whilst allowing appropriate splicing of the
remaining exons. Due to the short length of the intron between exons 7 and 8 (97 bp) only one
suitably unique targeting sequence (crRNA) with a corresponding protospacer adjacent motif
was identified. Three candidate crRNA sequences were selected in the immediate upstream

 area of exon 7. All four sequences were assessed in vitro for cutting efficiency by transfection of
porcine kidney PK15 cells with a plasmid based on px458 [42] encoding the complete single
guide sequence (sgRNA), driven by the hU6 promoter, and a CAG promoter driving
NLS-Cas9-2A-GFP. Transfected cells were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting
(FACS) for GFP and cutting efficiency at the target site was assessed using a Cel1 surveyor
assay. Three out of four guides were shown to direct cutting of DNA as anticipated (2
upstream and one downstream of exon 7). Following double transfection assay and subsequent
PCR analysis it was found that only the combination of guides SL26 and SL28 generated the
desired exon 7 deletion in the CD163 gene (Fig 1B). Based on these results the guide combina-
tion of sgSL26 and sgSL28 was used for in vivo experiments.
sgRNAs SL26 and SL28 were microinjected together with mRNA encoding the Cas9 nucle-
ase into the cytosol of zygotes (Fig 1C). Editing efficiency was assessed in a small number of

PK15 cells were transfected with either a single plasmid encoding a guide RNA + Cas9 or co-transfected with combination of two
such plasmids. Transfected cells were identified by GFP expression and isolated by FACS. Cutting efficiency of single guide RNA
transfection was assessed by a Cel1 surveyor assay. Relative efficiency of exon 7 deletion upon double transfection was assessed
by PCR. C) Schematic of the Cas9/guide RNA injection into zygotes. The injection mix was injected into the cytoplasm of zygotes and

 injected zygotes by in vitro culture to the blastocyst stage, genomic DNA extraction, whole
genome amplification and PCR amplification across exon 7. The analysis revealed that two out
of 17 blastocysts contained a deletion of the intended size and Sanger sequencing confirmed
the deletion of exon 7. Edited blastocyst B2 showed a clean deletion and subsequent re-ligation
at the cutting sites of sgSL26 and sgSL28, whilst edited blastocyst B14 showed that in addition
to the intended deletion there was also a random insertion of 25 nucleotides at the target site
(S1 Fig). None of the full length PCR products showed nucleotide mismatches at either cutting
site in a T7 endonuclease assay. The overall editing rate in the blastocysts was 11.7%.
To generate live pigs, 24–39 zygotes injected with sgSL26, sgSL28, and Cas9 mRNA were
transferred into the oviduct of recipient gilts. A total of 32 live piglets were born and genotyp-
ing of ear and tail biopsies revealed that four of the piglets had an exon 7 deletion, correspond-
ing to 12.5% of the total. In addition to the intended deletion of exon 7, three out of the four
animals showed insertions of new DNA at the target site probably as a consequence of non-
homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair. Pig 347 showed a 2 bp truncation at the sgSL26 cut-
ting site and a 66 bp insertion between the cutting sites, pig 346 showed a deletion of 304 bp
after the cutting site of sgSL26, and pig 310 showed a short 9 bp insertion at the cutting sites
(S2 Fig). Pig 345 was found to have a precise deletion of exon 7 without insertion or deletion
of random nucleotides at the cut sites (S2B & S2D Fig). Interestingly PCR amplification indi-
cated that pigs 310, 345, and 347 were all mosaic for an editing event, with pig 310 having a
low frequency heterozygous (one allele edited) compared to unedited cells, whilst pigs 345 and
347 have both homozygous (both alleles edited) and heterozygous cell types (S2A & S2C Fig).
Genotype and phenotype of F1 generation pigs
To generate fully homozygous and heterozygous pigs, 310 was mated with 345. This mating
yielded a litter of 6 heterozygous, 2 biallelic/homozygous CD163 SRCR5 deletion (ΔSRCR5),
and 4 wild type CD163 piglets (S3 Fig). Sequencing of the animals revealed all the heterozygotes
to have inherited their edited allele from 345. Pig 629 was found to be biallelic for the exon 7
deletion with one allele carrying the genotype of 345 and the other allele the one from 310.
Interestingly 630 was found to be homozygous for the edited allele with the 9 bp insert between
the cutting sites of sgSL26 and sgSL28 as found in the 310 founder / parent (Fig 2). We con-
clude that this homozygous state has arisen from a gene conversion event in the zygote.

 Animals 627, 628, 629, 630, 633, and 634 were selected for further analysis, representing the
various genotypes (wild type, heterozygous, and biallelic/homozygous) and genders. Growth
rates of both ΔSRCR5 and heterozygous animals were comparable to wild type animals (Fig 2).
Blood samples were taken from all six animals at 10 weeks of age and analyzed by a full blood
count conducted by the diagnostics laboratory at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Sci-
ences, University of Edinburgh. The blood counts of all animals were within reference values
(S1 table). Size, stature and other morphological features of ΔSRCR5 and heterozygous pigs
were comparable to their wild type siblings (Fig 3A).
At 8 weeks of age, pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were isolated from all six ani-
mals by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). DNA was extracted from the PAMs and analyzed by
PCR and Sanger sequencing. The PAM genotype confirmed the results obtained from the ear
biopsies; 628 and 633 were wild type, 627 and 633 heterozygous, and 629 and 630 ΔSRCR5,

DNA was extracted from PAMs and genotype assessed by PCR across Intron 6 to Exon 8. The unmodified
genome PCR is predicted to result in a 900 bp product, whilst exon 7 deletion should result in a 450 bp PCR
product. C) RNA phenotype of pulmonary alveolar macrophages. RNA was extracted from PAMs, converted
into cDNA using oligo(dT) primer, and analyzed by PCR across Exons 4–9. The unmodified cDNA should
result in a 1686 bp product, whilst the exon 7 deletion is expected to yield a 1371 bp product. D) Protein

expression analyzed by western blot. E) CD163 mRNA levels in PAMs. RNA was extracted from the same

animal. Error bars represent SEM, n = 3*2.

 respectively. Sequencing of PCR products confirmed that all editing events had resulted in
complete deletion of exon 7. Whilst pigs 627 and 633 had a clean deletion of exon 7 with pre-
cise religation at the sgSL26 and sgSL28 cutting sites in one allele, 629 had one allele with a
clean deletion and one allele with a 9 bp insertion between the sites, and pig 630 had both
alleles with the 9 bp insertion (Fig 3B). RNA was extracted from the PAMs, converted into
cDNA using oligo(dT) primed reverse transcription, amplified by PCR and analyzed by Sanger
sequencing. PCR products spanning exons 4 to 9 showed the expected 315 bp deletion in both
heterozygous and ΔSRCR5 animals (Fig 3C). A third fragment situated between the full length
and exon 7 deletion band in 627 and 634 was confirmed to be a hybrid of the full length and
the exon 7 deletion fragment. This shows that deletion of exon 7 has not disrupted the use of
the correct splice acceptor site of exon 8. Expression of CD163 protein was assessed by western
blot of PAM lysate. The wild type pigs 628 and 633 expressed the full length protein with a pre-
dicted size of 120 kDa but is described to run at roughly 150 kDa [43], likely due to glycosyla-
tion, whereby a protein band at roughly 100 kDa may indicate the expression of another
isoform, which could correspond to the described human isoform CRA_a or CRA_b (Gen-
Bank references EAW88664.1 and EAW88666.1). Heterozygous animals 627 and 634 express
both the full-length and the ΔSRCR5 protein (Fig 3D). The band of the full-length protein is
clearly stronger, indicating either higher expression of the full-length gene or increased bind-
ing of the full-length protein by the polyclonal CD163 antibody used in this study. To further
examine this, gene expression was quantified by RT-qPCR on RNA extracted from PAMs and
normalized to β-actin expression, demonstrating no significant difference in total CD163
mRNA expression between wild type, heterozygous and ΔSRCR5 animals (Fig 3E).
Macrophages of ΔSRCR5 pigs are fully differentiated and express
macrophage-specific surface proteins
To assess the differentiation potential of monocytes into CD163-expressing macrophages we
isolated peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) from whole blood and then differentiated them
into macrophages by CSF1-induction for seven days. Expression of macrophage specific mark-
ers was assessed by immunofluorescence labelling and FACS analysis. CD14 and CD16 levels
are clear indicators of the differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes with levels of both
increasing significantly upon differentiation [44,45]. CD14/CD16 staining of the PMMs from
the ΔSRCR5, heterozygous, and wild type animals were all within the previously observed and
documented levels [46], with difference being observed between the various genotypes (Fig
4A). CD172a, also known as SIRP α, is expressed at high levels on both monocytes and macro-
phages [45] and was expressed at high levels in cells from all animals. CD169, described as an
attachment factor for PRRSV [29], is not expressed in monocytes but is highly expressed in tis-
sue macrophages [47] and was expressed at expected levels in cells from our animals (Fig 4B).
An additional differentiation marker found to be expressed on PMMs is SWC9, also known as
CD203a, as well as the putative PRRSV attachment factor CD151 [48,49]. Expression of SWC9
highlighted the full differentiation of the PMMs. CD151 expression together with the previously
shown CD169 expression demonstrated that both putative PRRSV attachment factors or recep-
tors are still expressed on macrophages from ΔSRCR5 animals (Fig 4C). As in humans, expres-
sion of CD163 in pigs is restricted to monocytes and macrophages. CD163 is expressed at high
levels in tissue macrophages, but at low levels in blood monocytes and in bone marrow-derived
macrophages [50] (porcine macrophage markers are reviewed in [51]). Both the wild type and
the ΔSRCR5 CD163 were recognized on the surface of the PAMs (Fig 4D). This indicates that
the ΔSRCR5 version of CD163 is likely to be properly folded as the clone 2A10/11 antibody
only recognizes the protein in a non-reduced, native conformation. The medians of CD163

 fluorescence intensity of pigs 628, 633, 627, 634, 629, 630 were 23.3, 16.7, 18.3, 16.5, 18.8, and
17.2, respectively, with the isotype control medians ranging from 1.88–3.79. Overall, PBMCs
isolated from all animals, independent of their genotype were shown to be fully differentiated
into PMMs upon CSF1 induction. They all expressed macrophage-specific surface markers,
including CD169, CD151, and CD163, which have putative functions in PRRSV entry.
To confirm the results from the in vitro differentiation PAMs were isolated by BAL and
characterized for the expression of macrophage-specific surface proteins CD14, CD16, CD169,
CD172a, and CD163 as described above. CD14/CD16 staining of the PAMs from the ΔSRCR5,
heterozygous, and wild type animals were all within the previously observed and documented
levels [46] (S4A Fig). Also CD169 and CD172a were within expected levels, confirming full dif-
ferentiations (S4B Fig). The medians of CD163 fluorescence intensity of pigs 628, 633, 627,
634, 629, 630 were 35.9, 22.7, 26.4, 24.4, 17.9, and 26.7, respectively, with isotype control medi-
ans ranging from 2.13–3.84 (S4C Fig). This indicates slightly higher expression levels of

 CD163 on PAMs compared to PMMs. Overall, PAMs isolated from all animals, independent
of their genotype were shown to be fully differentiated and to express macrophage-specific sur-
face markers, including CD169 and CD163, which have implicated functions in PRRSV entry.
ΔSRCR5 macrophages are not susceptible to infection with PRRSV
genotype 1
PRRSV has two different genotypes with distinct geographic distribution, with genotype 1
being found primarily in Europe and Asia and genotype 2 in the Americas and Asia. The two
genotypes show differences in both antigenicity and severity of pathology and show an evolu-
tionary divergence of >15% on a whole genome scale and *40% on the nucleotide level
between them (reviewed in [52]). Genotype 1 can be further divided into three subtypes, based
on the ORF7 sequence and geographical distribution, whereby subtype 1 is pan-European
whilst subtypes 2 and 3 are currently limited to Eastern Europe [53]. Here we tested all geno-
type 1 subtypes of PRRSV, represented by subtype 1 strain H2 (PRRSV H2) [54], subtype 2
strain DAI (PRRSV DAI) [55], and subtype 3 strain SU1-Bel (PRRSV SU1-Bel) [56], originally
isolated from the UK, Lithuania, and Belarus, respectively.
PAMs were infected at an MOI = 1 in a single-round infection. 19 hours post inoculation
(hpi) the cells were harvested and stained with a FITC-labelled antibody against PRRSV-N
protein. Infection levels were assessed by FACS analysis. All three virus subtypes resulted in
infection levels of 40–60% in wild type and heterozygous animals, with more than 98% of
infected cells being classified as CD163 positive. A slightly higher, statistically significant infec-
tion was observed in heterozygous animals infected with PRRSV H2 and DAI. The reason for
this is unclear, but may reflect either altered CD163 protein expression profile in heterozygous
animals or other, as yet unidentified, genetic properties. By contrast, cells from both ΔSRCR5
animals (629 and 630) were found to be highly resistant to infection in this assay (Fig 5A–5C).
A second assay was performed to assess whether virus could replicate in PAMs then infect
neighboring cells in a multiple-round infection time course. Cells were inoculated at
MOI = 0.1 and supernatant samples collected at indicated time points. Viral RNA was
extracted from the supernatants and analyzed by RT-qPCR. For PRRSV H2 and SU1-Bel spe-
cific probes and primers against ORF7 were employed. To quantify PRRSV DAI vRNA specific
primers against ORF5 and BRYT green dye binding were used due to the limited genome
information available on this strain. All wild type and heterozygous animals replicated the
virus to similar levels. Virus levels started to rise by 12 hpi and increased exponentially up to
36 hpi when they plateaued. PRRSV SU1-Bel levels reached their plateau at 48 hpi. The quanti-
fication limit of the RT-qPCR corresponded to a CT value of 35, which corresponded to 1E4
TCID50/ml for PRRSV H2, 1E3 TCID50/ml for PRRSV DAI, and 5E3 for PRRSV SU1-Bel.
vRNA levels in supernatants from ΔSRCR5 PAMs in this multiple round infection did not
increase above the quantification limit (Fig 5D–5F). In order to assess whether infectious viri-
ons were produced a TCID50 assay was conducted on supernatant collected at 48 hpi, when all
three subtypes had reached a plateau. Serial dilutions were started at a 1:10 dilution, corre-
sponding to a detection limit of 63 TCID50/ml. Virus produced from PAMs of wild type or
heterozygous origin was infectious and levels measured were comparable to those calculated
for the vRNA extractions. By contrast, homozygous ΔSRCR5 PAMs did not support virus pro-
duction at the detection limit of this assay (Fig 5G–5J). In summary, PAMs from ΔSRCR5 ani-
mals could not be infected by PRRSV genotype I at a high MOI nor did they replicate the virus
over a 72 h time course.
To explore the possibility that PMMs could be a suitable alternative to monitor PRRSV
infection and investigate whether ΔSRCR5 PMMs, like PAMs, are resistant to PRRSV infection

 we tested infectivity with all three genotype 1 subtypes of PRRSV, represented by the strains
described above. PMMs were infected and assessed as described for PAMs above in both sin-
gle-round infections (S5A–S5C Fig) and multiple-round infections (S5D–S5F Fig). The results
obtained from PMMs confirmed the ones obtained in PAMs as no replication of PRRSV was
observed in cells from ΔSRCR5 animals. Interestingly, PMMs replicated all viruses to higher
levels than PAMs, suggesting that PMMs are not only suitable but may in fact be a superior
model for in vitro infection studies with PRRSV.
As there could be a genetic variation of CD163 within the Suidae superfamily we performed
an in vitro control experiment to assess the susceptibility of warthog (Phacocherus africanus)
PMMs to PRRSV infection. Interestingly, warthog PMMs were found to be as susceptible to
infection with all PRRSV genotype 1 subtypes as the pig PMMs. They all replicated the virus at

 a similar rate and to comparable titers (S6 Fig). This also shows that the virus poses a threat to
African pig breeding countries.
Peripheral blood monocyte-derived ΔSRCR5 macrophages are not
susceptible to infection with PRRSV genotype 2
To assess the infectability of the ΔSRCR5 macrophages with the Asian/American genotype 2 of
the virus we selected two strains associated with high virulence, pathology, morbidity and
mortality; strain VR-2385, isolated in Iowa in 1992 [57] and MN184, isolated in Minnesota in
2001 [58], (both kindly provided by Prof. Tanja Opriessnig). PMMs from the different CD163
genotypes were subjected to a multiple-round infection. Therefore, cells were inoculated at
MOI = 0.1 and supernatant samples collected throughout the progression of infection at 6, 24,
32, 48, and 72 hpi. Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatants and analyzed by RT-qPCR.
Virus levels for both strains started to rise after the 6 hpi time point and increased exponen-
tially up to 32 hpi when they plateaued (Fig 6A & 6B). The virus amplification in the male
homozygous and heterozygous macrophages appears to reach higher levels for strain VR-
2385, whereby no difference could be observed for strain MN184. The quantification limit of
the RT-qPCR for VR-2385 was found to be at a CT value of 32, which corresponded to 3E2
TCID50/ml, for MN184 the quantification limit was at CT value of 36, corresponding to 25
TCID50/ml. vRNA levels in supernatants from ΔSRCR5 PMMs in this multiple round infec-
tion did not increase above the quantification limit. No replication of PRRSV was observed in
ΔSRCR5 animals.
The arrest in infection of ΔSRCR5 pulmonary alveolar macrophages
(PAMs) occurs prior to the formation of the replication/transcription
complex
In the porcine kidney cell line PK-15, lacking CD163 expression, transfected with the PRRSV
attachment factor CD169 the virus was found to be internalized but not to undergo uncoating
[36]. This indicates that CD163, in a close interplay with attachment/internalization factors,
plays a major role in the fusion of PRRSV. To assess whether the infection process in ΔSRCR5
macrophages is arrested prior to replication we inoculated PAM cells with all three PRRSV
genotype 1 subtypes, represented by the strains described above, at MOI = 2. The inoculum
was removed 3 hpi and infection allowed to continue up to 22 hpi. Cells were fixed and stained
for the replication-transcription complexes (RTC) formed by PRRSV upon replication initia-
tion. PRRSV nsp2 protein, involved in the formation of double membrane vesicles (reviewed
in [59]) was chosen as a representative marker for the RTC. The cells were permeabilized and
stained for the presence of PRRSV nsp2. We found that macrophages from both the wild type
and the heterozygous animals infected with PRRSV formed RTCs, independent of the subtype.
However, in the macrophages from ΔSRCR5 animals no RTC formation was observed. Repre-
sentative for all strains the SU1-Bel infection is shown in Fig 7, a figure of all infections may be
found in S7 Fig This underlines the involvement of CD163 in the entry and uncoating process
of PRRSV infection. It also supports the deletion of SRCR5 as an effective method to abrogate
PRRSV infection before the virus or viral proteins are amplified.
ΔSRCR5 peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages still function
as CD163-dependent hemoglobin-haptoglobin scavengers
In addition to its contribution to PRRSV susceptibility, CD163 has been described to have a
variety of important biological functions. CD163 is an erythroblast binding factor, enhancing

 the survival, proliferation and differentiation of immature erythroblasts, through association
with SRCR domain 2 and CD163-expressing macrophages also clear senescent and malformed
erythroblasts. SRCR domain 3 plays a crucial role as a hemoglobin (Hb)-haptoglobin (Hp)
scavenger receptor. Free Hb is oxidative and toxic; once complexed with Hp it is cleared
through binding to SRCR3 on the surface of macrophages and subsequent endocytosis. This
prevents oxidative damage, maintains homeostasis, and aids the recycling of iron. Recently,
CD163 was also shown to interact with HMGB1-haptoglobin complexes and regulate the
inflammatory response in a heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1) dependent manner [60]. CD163-
expressing macrophages were also found to be involved in the clearance of a cytokine named

 TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), with all SRCRs apart from SRCR5 being
involved in this process [61]. Soluble CD163 can be found at a high concentration in blood
plasma but its function in this niche is still partially unknown (reviewed in [34,62]). However,
a recent publication by Akahori et al. showed the TWEAK interaction of CD163 to be involved
in ischaemic injury tissue regeneration [63]. Maintaining these biological functions is likely to
be crucial to the production of healthy, genetically edited animals. Interestingly, none of the
biological functions assigned to CD163 have yet been linked to SRCR5. In order to confirm
whether ΔSRCR5 macrophages were still able to take up Hb-Hp complexes we performed a
variety of in vitro experiments. Hb-Hp complex uptake in PMMs in vitro has been investigated
extensively in the past, with PMMs able to take up both Hb and Hb-Hp complexes in a
CD163-dependent manner and the inducible form of heme oxygenase, HO-1, being upregu-
lated upon Hb-Hp uptake [64,65].
PBMCs were differentiated into PMMs by CSF1-induction for seven days, following which
PMMs were incubated in the presence of Hb-Hp for 24 h to stimulate HO-1 upregulation. The
HO-1 mRNA upregulation, assessed by RT-qPCR, increased 2- to 6-fold in the PMMs from all
animals (Fig 8A) with no significant difference between the different genotypes. To assess HO-
1 levels by western blotting PMMs were incubated in the presence of Hb-Hp for 24 h, lysed
using reducing Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. The levels of
HO-1 were assessed using a monoclonal antibody against the protein, with a monoclonal

 antibody against calmodulin as a loading control. HO-1 protein expression was found to be
upregulated in all animals, independent of CD163 genotype (Fig 8B). To evaluate the uptake of
Hb-Hp directly Hb was labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488). PMMs were incubated with
HbAF488-Hp for 30 min and followed by FACS analysis. Independent of the CD163 genotype,
HbAF488-Hp was taken up efficiently by the PMMs with medians of green fluorescence being
329, 305, 329, 366, 340, and 405 for animals 628, 633, 627, 634, 629, and 630, respectively,
whilst the background mock-treated cell medians ranged from 2.41–4.74 (Fig 8C). The uptake
of HbAF488-Hp into the PMMs was confirmed by confocal microscopy. In a further experiment
PMMs were incubated with HbAF488-Hp for 30 min, followed by fixation and staining for
CD163. The HbAF488-Hp was found in distinct spots, presumably endosomes, with no obvious
co-localization with CD163 (Representative animals wild type 628 and ΔSRCR5 630 shown in
Fig 8D, all animals shown in S8 Fig). This lack of co-localization is not surprising as the major-
ity of HbAF488-Hp complexes observed were likely already located in late endosomes and lyso-
somes. Overall, this data demonstrates that macrophages from ΔSRCR5 animals retain the
ability to perform their role as hemoglobin-haptoglobin scavengers.
Discussion
The results of this study show that live pigs carrying a CD163 SRCR5 deletion are healthy and
maintain the main biological functions of the protein, whilst the deletion renders target cells of
PRRSV resistant to infection with the virus. By using two sgRNAs flanking exon 7 of CD163 in
CRISPR/Cas9 editing in zygotes we achieved excision of this exon from the genome of pigs
yielding a CD163 ΔSRCR5 genotype. The expression of the truncated gene was confirmed by
PCR of cDNA, RT-qPCR and western blotting against CD163. Macrophages isolated from the

 lungs of wild type CD163, heterozygous and ΔSRCR5 animals showed full differentiation and
expression of macrophage surface markers characteristic of macrophages isolated from the
pulmonary alveolar areas. Assessing infection of PAMs from the different genotype animals in
both high dose, single-round infections and low dose, multiple-round infections showed
PAMs from ΔSRCR5 pigs to be resistant to infection in vitro. The differentiation ability of cells
of the monocytes/macrophages lineage from genetically edited CD163 animals was further
confirmed by isolation and differentiation of PBMCs. PMMs from ΔSRCR5 pigs were also
shown to be resistant to PRRSV infection. PMMs have a crucial biological role, serving as scav-
engers for Hb-Hp complexes in the blood. Using uptake experiments of fluorescently labelled
Hb-Hp complexes as well as gene upregulation assays to monitor the increase of HO-1 upon
Hb-Hp stimulation we confirmed that this important biological function is maintained in
macrophages isolated from ΔSRCR5 animals.
Using CRISPR/Cas9 editing in zygotes we generated live pigs with exon 7 CD163 deletions.
Editing efficiency was highly variable, dependent on day of the procedure/surgery, in both in
vitro cultivated blastocysts as well as born animals. However, it needs to be considered that
overall numbers are low. The reagents used on the various surgery days were the same and
both insemination and surgery times were kept consistent. However, there are many elements
in the genome editing process that rely on highly skilled personnel and technical reproducibil-
ity. Recent developments in nucleic acid delivery methods for genome editing in zygotes may
offer possible solutions to standardize the genome editing process. Various groups recently
reported successful genome editing by in vitro electroporation of CRISPR/Cas9 regents into
zygotes isolated from mice and rats without the necessity to remove the zona pellucida [66–
68]. Using electroporation to deliver genome editing reagents in vivo Takahasi et al. showed
high success with this method in mouse embryos after 1.6 days of gestation [69]. Use of in
vitro electroporation could standardize the injection process and reduce the requirement for
highly trained personnel. As an alternative, in vivo electroporation would remove both the
requirement for donor animals and the long handling process of zygotes prior to re-implanta-
tion, however this procedure has currently only been developed for mice and may prove diffi-
cult to adapt to the porcine system (reviewed in [70]). Three out of four of the founder animals
were found to be edited in a mosaic pattern, although again caution in over interpretation is to
be advised due to the low numbers involved. In animal 310 the mosaicism seems to result
from a delayed activity of the CRISPR/Cas9 complex, resulting in an edit of one allele in a sin-
gle cell at the 4- or 8-cell stage. In animals 345 and 347 an initial editing event appears to occur
in one allele at the 1-cell stage and a second editing event, modifying the second allele in one
of the cells at the 2-cell stage, resulting in homozygous/heterozygous mosaic animals. Mosai-
cism has been observed in various studies employing injection of genome editors into porcine
zygotes [71–73]. Asymmetric spreading of introduced mRNA seems unlikely following results
of Sato et al., who performed in vitro EGFP mRNA injections using parthenogenetically acti-
vated porcine oocytes, whereby a relatively homogenous fluorescence pattern could be
observed [73]. Rather, mosaicism seems to result from Cas9 protein/sgRNA complexes
remaining active throughout several cell divisions or delayed mRNA expression possibly trig-
gered by cell division. The former theory is supported by the genotype of 345 and 347, which
very likely have developed from an initial editing step in one allele at the one cell stage and
editing of the second allele in one of the 2-cell or 4-cell stage cells. To generate more biallelic
animals by direct injection of zygotes, a more active reagent set is required. Recent studies
indicate that injection of Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) is more efficient than
mRNA injection. Also, RNP injection can be combined with in vitro electroporation [74].
The mating of the F0 generation animals 310 and 345 resulted in wild type, heterozygous
and biallelic edited animals. This showed that despite mosaicism both animals are germline

 heterozygous. None of the offspring showed any adverse effect from the genome editing under
standard husbandry conditions. Interestingly, the genotype of one of the animals, 630, was
consistent with a gene conversion event at the edited CD163 locus. Based on the mechanism of
interallelic gene conversion we assume that a homologous recombination occurred in this ani-
mal between one allele showing the edited genotype of 345 and the other allele the edited geno-
type of 310. The gene conversion appears to have occurred at the zygote stage, rendering 630
homozygous for the genotype of 310 (reviewed in [75]).
PRRSV shows a very narrow host cell tropism, only infecting specific porcine macrophage
subsets. Isolating these cells from the F1 generation offspring of our genetically edited ani-
mals and their wild type siblings we showed that removal of the CD163 SRCR5 domain
results in complete resistance of the macrophages towards PRRSV infection. We further
demonstrated that macrophages from ΔSRCR5 animals are not only resistant to infection
with all European subtypes of genotype 1 but also highly pathogenic and highly virulent
strains of the Asian/American genotype 2. This shows that a targeted removal of SRCR5 is
sufficient to achieve complete resistance to PRRSV infection in vitro. PRRSV attachment fac-
tors CD151 and CD169 are still expressed on ΔSRCR5 macrophages underlining that these
proteins are not sufficient for PRRSV infection. PRRSV infection on macrophages from the
ΔSRCR5 animals was halted before the formation of replication transcription complexes
proving CD163 to be involved in the entry or uncoating stage of the PRRSV replication
cycle. The ΔSRCR5 macrophages will provide a new tool to study this process in detail in a
true-to-life system.
The ΔSRCR5 animals have several advantages over previously described genome edited
animals resistant to PRRSV infection. Whitworth et al. generated animals with a premature
stop codon in exon 3 of the CD163 gene, resulting in an ablation of CD163 expression [37].
In another recent publication the group replaced the SRCR5 of the porcine CD163 with the
human CD163-L1 (hCD163-L1) domain SRCR8, utilizing the strategy employed by van
Gorp et al. in their in vitro studies of the PRRSV-CD163 interaction [76,77]. However, when
replacing the SRCR5 with hCD163-L1 SRCR8 the resulting pigs were found to be susceptible
to PRRSV genotype 2 infection. In contrast to both approaches we have demonstrated that
specific application of genome editing tools in vivo can be used to efficiently generate
PRRSV genotype 1 and genotype 2 resistant animals with precise deletion of exon 7 of
CD163, and that these animals retain expression of the remainder of the CD163 protein on
the surface of specific differentiated macrophages in a native confirmation. We further
showed that the macrophages from these ΔSRCR5 animals retain full differentiation poten-
tial, both in PAMs as well as PBMCs stimulated to differentiate by CSF-1 addition, and that
macrophages from edited animals retain the ability to perform crucial biological functions
associated with CD163 expression, such as hemoglobin-haptoglobin uptake. Furthermore,
SRCR5 animals are not transgenic in contrast to hCD163-L1 SRCR8 replacement animals.
The hCD163-L1 SRCR8 animals or any variation thereof, which would render the animals
resistant to PRRSV genotype 2 as well as genotype 1, bear another risk, which is the adapta-
tion of the virus to the new amino acid sequence of the replacement SRCR domain, thereby
turning into a potential human pathogen due to the human sequence used. A removal of
SRCR5 has the advantage of removing the virus’s target interaction sequence all together,
thereby making it more difficult for the virus to adapt. Overall, this study demonstrates that
it is possible to utilize a targeted genome editing approach to render livestock resistant to
viral infection, whilst retaining biological function of the targeted gene. Introduction of
CD163 SRCR5 deletion animals in pig breeding could significantly reduce the economic
losses associated with PRRSV infection.

Cells and viruses
Primary pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) for the propagation of PRRSV genotype 1,
subtype 1 strain H2 (PRRSV H2) [54], subtype 2 strain DAI (PRRSV DAI) [55], and subtype 3
strain SU1-Bel (PRRSV SU1-Bel)[56] were harvested from wild type surplus research animals
aged 6–9 weeks as previously described [46]. Briefly, animals were euthanized according to a
schedule I method. Lungs were removed and transferred on ice to a sterile environment.
PAMs were extracted from lungs by washing the lungs twice with warm PBS, massaging to
release macrophages. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 400 x g. When neces-
sary red cells were removed using red cell lysis buffer (10 mM KHCO3, 155 mM NH4Cl, 0.1
mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 5 min before washing again with PBS. Cells were collected by centrifu-
gation as before and frozen in 90% FBS (HI, GE Healthcare), 10% DMSO (Sigma). Cells were
frozen gradually at 1˚C/min in a -80˚C freezer before being transferred to -150˚C. Genotype
2 PRRSV strains VR-2385, isolated in Iowa in 1992 [57] and MN184, isolated in Minnesota in
2001 [58], (both kindly provided by Prof. Tanja Opriessnig [78]) were assessed for infectivity
on PAM cells prior to use in infection experiments.
PAMs from the animals 627, 628, 629, 630, 633, and 634 were collected at 8 weeks of age.
For this the piglets were sedated using a Ketamine/Azaperone pre-medication mix and anaes-
thetized with Ketamine/Midazolam. Anesthesia throughout the procedure was maintained
using Sevoflurane. PAMs were collected by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) through an intuba-
tion with an air flow access. Three lung segments were flushed in each animal using 2 x 20 ml
PBS. Fluid recovery was between 60–80%. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 10min at
400g from the BAL fluid and frozen as above.
Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) were isolated as described previously [46]. Briefly,
blood was collected using EDTA coated vacuum tubes from the jugular vein of the piglets at 10
weeks of age. Blood was centrifuged at 1200 x g for 15 min and buffy coat transferred to PBS.
Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield) was overlaid with an equal volume of buffy coat/PBS and centri-
fuged for 45 min at 400 x g. The mononuclear cell fraction was washed with PBS, cells collected
and frozen as described above.
PAM cells were cultivated in RPMI-1640, Glutamax (Invitrogen), 10% FBS (HI, GE Health-
care), 100IU/ml penicillin and 100μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) (cRPMI). PBMCs were
cultivated in cRPMI supplemented with rhCSF1 (1×104 units/ml; a gift from Chiron) for 6
days prior to infection.
PK15 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with Glutamax (Invitrogen), 10% FBS
(HI, GE Healthcare), 100IU/ml penicillin and 100μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen).
Design and in vitro cutting efficiency assessment of guide RNAs

bp long intron 7. Oligomers (Invitrogen) were ordered, hybridized as previously described
[79] then ligated into the BbsI sites of plasmid pSL66 (a derivative of px458 with modifications
to the sgRNA scaffold as described by [42]). The generated plasmids contain a hU6 promoter
driving expression of the guide RNA sequence and a CBA promoter driving Cas9-2A-GFP
with an SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the N-terminus and a nucleoplasmin NLS at

 the C-terminus of Cas9. Cutting efficiency of each guide was assessed by transfection of the
plasmids into pig PK15 cells using a Neon transfection system (Invitrogen) set at 1400 mV
with 2 pulses of 20 mS. 48 hours post-transfection GFP positive cells were collected using a
FACS Aria III cell sorter (Becton Dickinson) and cultured for a further 4 days prior to prepara-
tion of genomic DNA (DNeasy Blood & Tissues Kit, Qiagen). PCR across the target sites was
with oSL46 (ACCTTGATGATTGCGCTCTT) and oSL47 (TGTCCCAGTGAGAGTTGCAG)
using AccuPrime Taq DNA polymerase HiFi (Life Technologies) to produce a product of 940
bp. A CelI assay (Transgenomic; Surveyor Mutation Detection Kit) was performed as previ-
ously described [80]. Co-transfection of PK15 cells with pairs of plasmids encoding guides
flanking exon 7 were carried out as described above with the exception that cells were har-
vested at 40 hours post-transfection without enrichment for GFP expression. In this instance a
truncated PCR product was observed in addition to the 940 bp fragment, indicating deletion
of exon 7.
Based on both single and double cutting efficiencies guide RNAs SL26 (GAATCGGC-
TAAGCCCACTGT), located 121 bp upstream of exon 7, and SL28 (CCCATGCCATGAA-
GAGGGTA), located 30 bp downstream of exon 7 were selected for in vivo experiments.
Generation of guide RNA and quality assessment
A DNA oligomer fragment containing the entire guide RNA scaffold and a T7 promoter was
generated by PCR from the respective plasmid template as follows; a forward primer contain-
ing the T7 promoter followed by the first 18 bp of the respective guide RNA and the reverse
primers oSL6 (AAAAGCACCGACTCGGTGCC) were used in combination with the Phusion
polymerase (NEB). DNA fragments were purified on a 1.5% agarose gel using the MinElute
Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA eluate was fur-
ther treated with 200 μg/ml Proteinase K (Qiagen) in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS for
30 min at 50˚C followed by phenol/chloroform extraction. Guide RNAs were generated from
the resultant DNA fragment using the MEGAshortscript Kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was purified using phenol/chloroform extraction followed
by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in EmbryoMax Injection Buffer (Millipore). Purity
and concentration of the RNA was assessed using an RNA Screen Tape (Agilent) on an Agilent
TapeStation according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Zygote injection and transfers
Embryos were produced from Large-White gilts as described previously [80]. Briefly, gilts
were superovulated using a regumate/PMSG/Chorulon regime between day 11 and 15 follow-
ing estrus. Following heat, the donor gilts were inseminated twice in a 6 hour interval. Zygotes
were surgically recovered from mated donors into NCSU-23 HEPES base medium, then sub-
jected to a single 2–5 pl cytoplasmic injection with an injection mix containing 50 ng/μl of
each guide (SL26 and SL28) and 100 ng/μl Cas9 mRNA (PNA Bio or Tri-Link) in EmbryoMax
Injection buffer (Millipore). Recipient females were treated identically to donor gilts but
remained unmated. During surgery, the reproductive tract was exposed and 24–39 zygotes
were transferred into the oviduct of recipients using a 3.5 French gauge tomcat catheter. Litter
sizes ranged from 5–12 piglets.
In vitro assessment genome editing in blastocyst
Uninjected control zygotes and injected surplus zygotes are cultivated in NCSU-23 HEPES
base medium, supplemented with cysteine and BSA at 38.5˚C for 5–7 days. Blastocysts were
harvested at day 7 post cultivation and the genome amplified using the REPLI-g Mini Kit

 (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Genotyping was performed as
described below.
Genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from ear biopsy or tail clippings taken from piglets at 2 days
postpartum using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The region spanning intron 6 to
exon 8 was amplified using primers oSL46 (ACCTTGATGATTGCGCTCTT) and oSL47
(TGTCCCAGTGAGAGTTGCAG), generating a 904 bp product from the intact allele and a
454 bp product if complete deletion of exon 7 had occurred. PCR products were analyzed by
separation on a 1% agarose gel and subsequent Sanger sequencing of all truncated fragments.
Fragments corresponding to the wild type length were further analyzed by T7 endonuclease I
(NEB) digestion according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA phenotyping
RNA was isolated from 1E6 PAM cells, isolated by BAL as described above, using the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, including an on-column
DNase digestion. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using an Oligo-dT primer in combina-
tion with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The cDNA was used to assess the RNA phenotype across exons 4 to 9 using
primers P0083 (ATGGATCTGATTTAGAGATGAGGC) and P0084 (CTATGCAGGCAA
CACCATTTTCT), resulting in a PCR product of 1686 bp length for the intact allele and
1371 bp following precise deletion of exon 7. PCR products were analyzed by separation on a
1% agarose gel and subsequent Sanger sequencing of deletion fragments.
Protein phenotype analysis by western blotting
4E5 PAM cells isolated by BAL were collected by centrifugation at 300 rcf for 10 min. The pel-
let was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mM DTT, boiled for 10 min at
95˚C and subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% acrylamide (Bio-Rad) gels. After transfer to a
nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham), the presence of cellular proteins was probed with anti-
bodies against CD163 (rabbit pAb, abcam, ab87099) at 1 μg/ml, and β-actin (HRP-tagged,
mouse mAb, Sigma, A3854) at 1:2000. For CD163 the blot was subsequently incubated with
HRP-labelled rabbit anti-mouse antibody (DAKO, P0260) at 1:5000. Binding of HRP-labelled
antibodies was visualized using the Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantification of CD163 mRNA by RT-qPCR
RNA was isolated from 1E6 PAMs using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions, including an on-column DNase digestion. RNA levels were measured
using the GoTaq 1-Step RT-qPCR system (Promega) according to the manufacturers’ instruc-
tions on a LightCycler 480 (Roche). mRNA levels of CD163 were quantified using primers
P0074 (CATGGACACGAGTCTGCTCT) and P0075 (GCTGCCTCCACCTTTAAGTC) and
reference mRNA levels of β-actin using primers P0081 (CCCTGGAGAAGAGCTACGAG)
and P0082 (AAGGTAGTTTCGTGGATGCC).
Characterization of macrophages by flow cytometry
PAMs were seeded one day prior to analysis. PBMCs were seeded seven days prior to analysis
and differentiated by CSF1 stimulation to yield PBMC-derived macrophages (PMMs). Cells

 were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman and fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 15
min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with blocking solution (PBS, 3% BSA) for 45
min before staining with antibodies. Cells were stained with antibodies targeting either mouse
anti pig CD14 (AbD Serotec, MGA1273F, 1:50) and mouse anti pig CD16 (AbD Serotec,
MCA2311PE, 1:200), mouse anti pig CD169 (AbD Serotec, MCA2316F, 1:50) and mouse anti
pig CD172a (SoutherBiotech, 4525–09, 1:400), mouse anti human CD151 (AbD Serotec,
MCA1856PE, 1:50) and mouse anti pig SWC9(CD203a) (AbD Serotec, MCA1973F, 1:50),
mouse anti pig CD163 (AbD Serotec, MCA2311PE, 1:50), or mouse IgG1 or an IgG2b negative
control (AbD Serotec, MCA928PE,MCA691F, or Sigma, F6397; same concentration as pri-
mary Ab). The cells were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in FACS buffer (2%
FBS, 0.05M EDTA, 0.2% NaN3 in PBS). Gene expression determined by antibody labelling was
assessed by FACS analysis on a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson) using FlowJo software.
High MOI single-round infection assay
PAMs were seeded one day prior to infection. PBMCs were seeded seven days prior to infec-
tion and differentiated by CSF1 stimulation to yield PBMC-derived macrophages PMMs. Cells
were inoculated at MOI = 1 of the respective virus strain (PRRSV H2, DAI, or SU1-Bel) in
cRPMI for 3 h at 37˚C. The inoculum was replaced by warm cRPMI. At 19 hpi cells were
detached by using a cell scraper. Cells were fixed in 4% Formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS
(Gibco) for 15 min at RT, washed with PBS, and subsequently permeabilized in PBS contain-
ing 0.1% Triton-X-100 (Alfa Aesar) for 10 min. Cells were incubated with antibody against
PRRSV-N (SDOW17-F, RTI, KSL0607, 1:200) and CD163 (AbD Serotec, MCA2311PE, 1:50)
or mouse IgG1 negative controls, as described above, in 3% BSA in PBS. The cells were washed
three times with PBS and resuspended in FACS buffer. Infection levels, determined by anti-
body labelling, were assessed by FACS analysis on a FACS Calibur (Benson Dickson) using
FlowJo software.
Low MOI multiple-round infection assay
PAMs were seeded one day prior to infection. PBMCs were seeded seven days prior to infec-
tion and differentiated by CSF1 stimulation to yield PMMs. Cells were inoculated at
MOI = 0.1 with the respective virus strain (PRRSV H2, DAI, or SU1-Bel) in cRPMI for 3 h at
37˚C. Inoculum was removed, cells washed 1x with PBS, and infection continued. At the indi-
cated times post inoculation samples were harvested to be assessed. All samples were frozen
and processed once all samples from a time course had been collected.
Viral RNA (vRNA) was extracted from the supernatant samples using the QIAmp Viral
RNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The viral RNA levels were quanti-
fied by RT-qPCR using the GoTaq Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR system (Promega) for PRRSV H2
and SU1-Bel and the GoTaq 1-Step RT-qPCR system (Promega) for PRRSV DAI, VR-2385,
and MN184, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For this the following primers and
probes were used: H2 fwd (GATGACRTCCGGCAYC), H2 rev (CAGTTCCTGCGCCTT
GAT), H2 probe (6-FAM-TGCAATCGATCCAGACGGCTT-TAMRA), (optimal H2 primer/
probe sequences obtained from JP Frossard, AHVLA), SU1-Bel fwd (TCTTTGTTTGCAATC
GATCC), SU1-Bel rev (GGCGCACTGTATGACTGACT), SU1-Bel probe (6-FAM-CCGGAA
CTGCGCTTTCA-TAMRA), DAI fwd (GGATACTATCACGGGCGGTA), DAI rev
(GGCACGCCATACAATTCTTA), VR-2385 fwd (CTGGGTAAGATCATCGCTCA), VR-
2385 rev (CAGTCGCTAGAGGGAAATGG), MN184 fwd (CTCTCGCGACTGAAGAT
GAC), MN184 rev (GCCTTGGTTAAAGGCAGTCT). RNA levels were measured on a Light-
Cycler 480 (Roche) using a standard curve generated from vRNA isolates of high titer stocks.

 Infectivity of the virus produced was assessed using a TCID50 assay of selected time points
on PAMs isolated from wild type surplus research animals.
mRNA and protein levels of heme oxygenase 1 upon Hb-Hp stimulation
of PMMs
PBMCs were seeded seven days prior to analysis and differentiated by CSF1 stimulation to
yield PMMs. Hemoglobin (Hb, Sigma-Aldrich, A0, H0267) and Haptoglobin (Hp, Sigma
Aldrich, Phenotype 2–2, H9762) were mixed in a 1:1 wt/wt ratio in PBS for 15 min on a verti-
cal roller before experimentation. PMMs were incubated with 100 μg/ml Hb-Hp in cRPMI for
24 h at 37˚C. Cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman. RNA was isolated
from 1E6 cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions, including an on-column DNase digestion. RNA levels were measured using the GoTaq
1-Step RT-qPCR system (Promega) according to the manufacturers’ instructions on a Light-
Cycler 480 (Roche). mRNA levels of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) were quantified using primers
P0239 (TACATGGGTGACCTGTCTGG) and P0240 (ACAGCTGCTTGAACTTGGTG) and
reference mRNA levels of β-actin using primers P0081 and P0082. For analysis of protein lev-
els of HO-1 cells were collected by centrifugation at 300 rcf for 10 min. The pellet was resus-
pended in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mM DTT, boiled for 10 min at 95˚C and
subjected to electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide (Bio-Rad) gels. After transfer to a nitrocellu-
lose membrane (Amersham), the presence of cellular proteins was probed with antibodies
against HO-1 (mouse mAb, abcam, ab13248, 1:250), and calmodulin (rabbit mAb, abcam,
ab45689, 1:1000). The blot was subsequently incubated with HRP-labelled goat anti-rabbit
antibody (DAKO, PI-1000) at 1:5000. Binding of HRP-labelled antibodies was visualized using
the Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Quantification and visualization of hemoglobin-haptoglobin uptake
PBMCs were seeded seven days prior to analysis and differentiated by CSF1 stimulation to
yield PMMs. For fluorescence microscopy, cells were seeded on glass cover slips. Hemoglobin
(Sigma-Aldrich, A0, H0267) was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (AF-488) using a protein label-
ling kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. HbAF488 and Hp
were mixed in a 1:1 wt/wt ratio in PBS for 15 min on a vertical roller before experimentation.
PMMs were incubated with 10 μg/ml HbAF488-Hp in cRPMI for 30 min at 37˚C.
For quantification by FACS the cells were collected with a rubber policeman and washed
three times with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS to remove surface bound HbAF488-Hp as described previ-
ously [65]. Cells were fixed in 4% (wt/v) formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS (Gibco) for 15
min at RT, washed with PBS, and subsequently permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-
X-100 (Alfa Aesar) for 10 min. Cells were stained with mouse anti pig CD163 antibody (AbD
Serotec, MCA2311PE, 1:50) as described above then washed three times with PBS and resus-
pended in FACS buffer. Gene expression determined by antibody labelling was assessed by
analysis on a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson) using FlowJo software.
For immunofluorescence imaging cells were washed three times with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS
and fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS (Gibco) for 15 min at RT, washed with
PBS, then permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X-100 (Alfa Aesar) for 10min. Cells
were washed with PBS and incubated with antibody against CD163 (rabbit pAb, abcam,
ab87099, 5 μg/ml) in blocking buffer (PBS, 3% FBS) for 1 h, washed, and incubated with sec-
ondary goat anti-rabbit AF594 antibody (A11037, 1:100), AF647 phalloidin (A22287, 1:100),

Immunofluorescence analysis of RTC formation in infected PAMs
PAMs were seeded onto coverslips one day prior to infection. Cells were inoculated at
MOI = 2 of the respective virus strain (PRRSV H2, DAI, or SU1-Bel) in cRPMI for 3 h at 37˚C.
The inoculum was replaced by warm cRPMI. At 19 hpi cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde
(Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS (Gibco) for 15 min at RT, washed with PBS, and permeabilized as
described above. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with antibody against PRRSV
nsp2 (A gift from Ying Fang, Kansas State University, [81], 1:400) in blocking buffer for 1 h,
washed, and incubated with secondary goat anti-mouse AF488 antibody (A11029, 1:100),
AF568 phalloidin (A12380, 1:100), and DAPI (1:10,000; all Life Technologies). The samples
were analyzed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM-710).
