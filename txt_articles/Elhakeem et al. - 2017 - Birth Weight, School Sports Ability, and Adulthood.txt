ABSTRACT
ELHAKEEM, A., R. COOPER, D. BANN, D. KUH, and R. HARDY. Birth Weight, School Sports Ability, and Adulthood Leisure-
Time Physical Activity. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 49, No. 1, pp. 64–70, 2017. Purpose: This study aimed to examine the associations
of birth weight with ability in school sports in adolescence and participation in leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) across adulthood
and to investigate whether associations between birth weight and LTPA change with age. Methods: Study participants were British
singletons born in 1946 and followed up to age 68 yr (the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development). Birth
weights were extracted from birth records. Teacher reports of ability in school sports were collected at age 13 yr. LTPA was self-reported
at ages 36, 43, 53, 60–64, and 68 yr and categorized at each age as participating in sports, exercise, and other vigorous LTPA at least once
per month versus no participation. Associations were examined using standard and mixed-effects logistic regression models. Results:
Relevant data were available for 2739 study participants (50.1% female). When compared with the low birth weight group (e2.50 kg),
those with heavier birth weights were more likely to be rated as above average or average at school sports (vs below average); fully
adjusted odds ratio = 1.78 (95% confidence interval = 1.14–2.77). Across adulthood, those with heavier birth weights were more likely to
participate in LTPA than those with low birth weight; fully adjusted odds ratio of LTPA across adulthood = 1.52 (95% confidence interval =
1.09–2.14). This association did not vary by age (P = 0.5 for birth weight by age interaction). Conclusions: Low birth weight was associated
with lower ability in school sports and with nonparticipation in LTPA across adulthood. Identifying the underlying developmental and social
processes operating across life for low birth weight infants may inform the design of appropriate interventions to support participation in
LTPA across life. Key Words: BIRTH WEIGHT, LIFE COURSE, EXERCISE, SPORTS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
R
egular leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) provides
many health benefits that include reduced rates of
early death from chronic disease, whereas physical
inactivity is a major contributor to morbidity and premature
mortality (2,39). To develop interventions that are more ef-
fective at promoting LTPA, a better understanding of its de-
terminants from across life is required (6,10,13,19). Studies
taking a life course approach suggest that biological and so-
cial factors in early life may influence adult health-related
behaviors, including LTPA (3,6,7,10,13,19,20,29,30). These
include studies that have examined hypothesized associa-
tions between size at birth (as a marker of exposures
in utero) and physical activity across different phases of
life (1,3,18,26,28,30,31,33).
The fetal origins of adult disease hypothesis (5) suggests
that in utero experiences such as undernutrition can, in ad-
dition to limiting size at birth, alter development and in-
crease susceptibility to chronic disease. Lower birth weight
has been associated with higher risks of cardiovascular dis-
ease (5,38) and type II diabetes (41), and more recently also
with lower aerobic fitness and muscular endurance (32) and
less favorable body composition in terms of lower bone (23)
and muscle mass (4), and weaker muscle strength (12). Low
birth weight has also been associated with poorer motor and
cognitive development (27).
These findings (4,5,12,23,27,32,38,41) alongside animal
studies showing less physical activity in those born to un-
dernourished mothers (42) provide evidence to suggest that
adolescents and adults with low birth weight might partici-
pate less in LTPA. The underlying mechanisms may operate
through an effect on the motor skills required to develop
competence at sports, a reduced exercise capacity and sub-
sequent self-selection out of sports and exercise in those
born with low birth weight (11,13). Moreover, an impaired
exercise capacity is also a reported consequence of reduced

 gestational age (i.e., preterm birth) (11,13), and thus any
associations between low birth weight and less LTPA could
be driven by an intrauterine growth restriction, a reduced
gestational age, or a combination of both.
Of the existing epidemiological studies that have investi-
gated associations between birth weight and physical activ-
ity, inconsistent results are reported with a tendency to find
null associations (26,28,29,31) or less LTPA in those born
with low birth weight (1,3,18,33). Most studies have ex-
amined activity in childhood, adolescence, or young adult-
hood and/or rely on a single measure of physical activity.
However, the influence of birth weight on chronic disease
risk is more apparent later in life (38,41), so it could be that
associations with LTPA might also be more apparent in
adulthood. Thus, studies that extend into and across adulthood
are required. In addition, the assessment of whether any as-
sociations found change across adult life may help establish
underlying mechanisms that could have important implica-
tions for future intervention. Therefore, the aim of this study
was to examine the associations of birth weight with ability in
school sports in adolescence and participation in LTPA across
adulthood and to investigate whether the association between
birth weight and LTPA changes with age.
METHODS
Study Population
Study participants were from the Medical Research
Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Develop-
ment (NSHD), a nationally representative sample of 5362
British singleton births during 1 wk in March 1946 and
followed up regularly across childhood and adulthood (21).
At age 13 yr (1959), the school teacher who was most fa-
miliar with each study participant completed a school-based
questionnaire. At ages 36 yr (1982), 43 yr (1989), and 53 yr
(1999), trained nurses interviewed and assessed the study
participants in their own homes. At age 60–64 yr (2006–
2010), they attended one of six clinical research facilities or
received a home visit, and at age 68 yr (2014), they com-
pleted a postal questionnaire.
Of those successfully contacted at ages 36 yr (n = 3322),
43 yr (n = 3262), 53 yr (n = 3035), 60–64 yr (n = 2661), and
68 yr (n = 2453), 99.6%, 100%, 98.4%, 82.2%, and 99.1%,
respectively, provided information on LTPA (3766 partici-
pants had at least one measure of LTPA). The participating
samples at ages 53 and 60–64 yr have been found to be
broadly representative of similar age members of the general
UK population (34,37). At the last completed round of data
collection at age 68 yr, 83.4% of 2943 study participants
who were still alive and eligible to participate were suc-
cessfully contacted. Of the 490 who were not successfully
contacted, 11 had died, 453 did not return a questionnaire,
and 26 questionnaires were returned undelivered.
Relevant ethics approval has been granted for each data
collection; ethical approval for the most recent assessment in
2014 was obtained from the Queen Square Research Ethics
Committee (14/LO/1073) and the Scotland A Research
Ethics Committee (14/SS/1009). Study participants provided
written informed consent.
Measurements
Birth weight. Birth weight, recorded to the nearest
quarter of a pound, was extracted from birth records within
6 wk of delivery and subsequently converted to kg.
School sports ability and adulthood LTPA. When
study participants were 13 yr old, teachers were asked to
complete a questionnaire rating their ability in school sports
as above average, average, or below average compared with
their peers (20). This measure is used as a marker of study
participants_ overall ability at school-based games and ac-
tivities requiring competence in motor skills and coordina-
tion (e.g., team sports, physical education, and athletics) and
was previously shown to relate to LTPA at age 36 yr (20).
At ages 36, 43, 53, 60–64, and 68 yr, study participants
reported how often they participated in LTPA during nurse
interviews or using self-completed questionnaires. At age
36 yr, study participants reported the number of times they
took part in 27 different sports, exercises, and other leisure
activities during the previous month using questions based on
the Minnesota LTPA questionnaire (20). At age 43 yr, infor-
mation was collected on participation in sports, exercise, or
other vigorous leisure activities in the previous year including
for how many months and how often in those months activ-
ities were performed (9). At age 53 yr, study participants were
asked how often they participated in sports, exercise, or other
vigorous leisure activities during the previous 4 wk, and this
question was asked again at ages 60–64 and 68 yr. At each age,
study participants were classed as inactive if they reported no
participation in LTPA, moderately active if they participated up
to four times in LTPA, or regularly active if they reported taking
part five or more times in LTPA (in the previous month at age
36 yr, per month at age 43 yr, and in the previous 4 wk at ages
53, 60–64, and 68 yr).
Covariates. Birth order, childhood socioeconomic posi-
tion, and cognitive ability were identified as potential con-
founders based on existing literature (6,14,24). On the basis of
mother_s report of birth order, study participants were clas-
sified as first, second, or third or later born. Father_s Registrar
General_s occupational class at age 4 yr was used to indicate
socioeconomic position in childhood and was grouped into
four categories (I and II: professional, managerial, or techni-
cal; IIINM: skilled nonmanual; IIIM: skilled manual; and IV
and V: partly skilled or unskilled). Cognitive ability was
tested at age 8 yr in a school setting and included vocabulary,
comprehension, and reading tests from which a standardized
cognitive score was derived. Missing paternal occupational
class (n = 173) and cognition scores (n = 199) were imputed
with values recorded at ages 11 and 15 yr.
In addition to the previously mentioned covariates, sports
ability in childhood and physical health in adulthood were

 hypothesized to mediate associations between birth weight
and adulthood LTPA. Physical health was derived from in-
formation collected during nurse interviews at age 36 yr on
weight, disability, self-reported health problems, hyperten-
sion, lung function, and incidence of hospital admissions
(22). This information was used to categorize participants
into worst, intermediate, or best physical health (22). Sup-
plementary analyses in those with information on body mass
index (BMI) were also conducted to examine whether body
size mediated associations. BMI (kgImj2) was derived from
height and weight measured using standardized protocols in
childhood at age 11 yr and in adulthood at age 36 yr.
Statistical Analysis
Formal tests of interactions between sex and birth weight
were undertaken, and subsequent analyses were adjusted for
sex after no evidence of interaction was found. Formal tests
of deviation from linearity were performed and showed ev-
idence of nonlinear associations between birth weight and
sports ability and LTPA. As a result, study participants were
grouped into five categories of birth weight (e2.50 kg, 2.51–
3.00 kg, 3.01–3.50 kg, 3.51–4.00 kg, and 9 4.00 kg), and the
low birth weight group (e2.50 kg) was used as the reference in
analyses. For these analyses, dichotomous measures of sports
ability and LTPA were derived. The two groups of above
average and average ability in school sports were combined
and compared with the group with below average ability. At
each age in adulthood, the two groups reporting moderate and
regular participation in LTPA were combined and compared
with the group that reported no participation in LTPA.
We examined how birth weight relates to ability in school
sports using logistic regression. The association between
birth weight and LTPA across adulthood was examined
using mixed-effects binary logistic regression with random
intercepts and slopes for age so that we could include all
participants with at least one measure of LTPA while also
accounting for correlations among repeated LTPA responses
(25). In all models, we included sex and a sex-by-age in-
teraction. To investigate whether the association between
birth weight and probability of being active in LTPA
changes with increasing age, we added a birth weight by age
interaction term to the mixed-effects models. The estimated
fixed-effects coefficients were used to plot the log-odds of
LTPA for each birth weight group against age. In addition,
multinomial mixed-effects models (25) estimated using a
simulation approach were fit to the categorical LTPA data to
examine the associations of birth weight with moderate and
regular participation in LTPA (see Table, Supplementary
Digital Content 1, Associations between birth weight and
moderate and regular participation in LTPA, http://links.
lww.com/MSS/A745).
Models of the associations of birth weight with both
sports ability and LTPA were first adjusted for sex and then
for birth order, socioeconomic position, and cognitive abil-
ity. An additional model was then run when examining the
association between birth weight and LTPA, which included
adjustment for ability in school sports and physical health in
adulthood. Lastly, we reran both final models in those with
data on BMI and compared estimates to models with added
adjustment for BMI. Sports ability models were adjusted for
childhood BMI, whereas LTPA models were adjusted for adult
BMI. Analyses were conducted in STATA 14 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Characteristics of study participants. A total of
2739 study participants had at least one measure of adult-
hood LTPA and complete data on ability in school sports,
birth weight, and all selected covariates (Table 1). The ma-
jority of included participants had LTPA data from four of
the five different ages in adulthood (a total of 10,980 LTPA
assessments between ages 36 and 68 yr were included in
analyses). When compared with those excluded because of
missing LTPA data (n = 1596), higher proportions of those
with at least one measure of LTPA were female (49.6% vs
42.5%) and had fathers in occupational classes I and II
(23.1% vs 20.9%), and lower proportions had low birth
weight (4.7% vs 8.8%). At age 13 yr, higher proportions of
girls were rated as above average or average in school sports
(Table 1). At ages 36 and 43 yr, higher proportions of men
reported taking part in LTPA, but sex differences were less
marked at older ages (Table 1).
Birth weight and ability in school sports at age
13 yr. When compared with the low birth weight group
(e2.50 kg), those in other heavier birth weight categories were
more likely to be rated as above average or average (vs below
average) at school sports at age 13 yr (Table 2). For example,
the sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of above average or
average sports ability was 1.89 (95% confidence interval
[CI] = 1.22–2.93) when combining the four other birth
weight groups and comparing this larger group with the low
birth weight group. This association was only slightly attenu-
ated when models were adjusted for birth order, cognitive
ability, and socioeconomic position (Table 2) (fully adjusted
OR of above average or average sports ability = 1.78; 95%
CI = 1.14–2.77, when comparing those in all heavier birth
weight groups with the low birth weight group). Further
adjustment for childhood BMI slightly strengthened this
association (see Table S2A, Supplementary Digital Content 2,
Associations between birth weight and ability in school sports
at 13 yr and participation in LTPA, http://links.lww.com/
MSS/A746).
Birth weight and LTPA between ages 36 and
68 yr. When compared with the low birth weight group, those
in all heavier birth weight groups were more likely to participate
in LTPA across adulthood (Table 2). There was no evidence of
an interaction between birth weight and age (P = 0.5 for con-
tinuous and categorical birth weight by age interactions),
suggesting these associations did not differ by age at assess-
ment of LTPA. This is consistent with the finding of similar

 OR of LTPA at each age in adulthood in study participants
with nonmissing LTPA (see Table, Supplementary Digital
Content 3, Associations between birth weight and LTPA at
each adult age in study participants, http://links.lww.com/MSS/
A747). A plot of the log-odds of LTPA shows the decline in
likelihood of activity with age for all five birth weight groups,
with the lowest birth weight group always having lower
probability of LTPA (Fig. 1). This plot also shows that al-
though men were more likely to report LTPA earlier in adult-
hood, women had less pronounced decline in LTPA across
adulthood in all birth weight groups (Fig. 1).
The association between birth weight and LTPA was
slightly attenuated by adjustment for early life covariates
and to a lesser degree by further adjustment for ability in
school sports and physical health in adulthood (Table 2).
The sex-adjusted OR of adulthood LTPA was 1.92 (95% CI =
1.35–2.73) when comparing those in the group combining the
four heavier birth weight groups with the low birth weight
group, which was attenuated to 1.63 (95% CI = 1.16–2.29)
after adjustment for early life covariates, and to 1.52 (95%
CI = 1.09–2.14) in the fully adjusted model. Associations
between low birth weight and lower likelihood of participation
in LTPA were stronger with more frequent participation
(see Table, Supplementary Digital Content 1, Associations
between birth weight and moderate and regular partici-
pation in LTPA, http://links.lww.com/MSS/A745). The
sex-adjusted relative risk ratios (95% CI) of moderate
(1–4 times per month) and regular (5 or more times per
month) LTPA across adulthood (vs no participation) were
1.60 (1.24–2.12) and 2.83 (1.87–4.37), respectively, when
comparing all four heavier birth weight groups with the low
birth weight group. These estimates were attenuated to 1.25
(0.90–1.93) and 1.81 (1.23–2.57), respectively, after full
adjustment. Additional adjustment for adulthood BMI had
little influence on findings (see Table S2B, Supplementary

DISCUSSION
We examined prospectively collected data from the lon-
gest running British birth cohort and found that low birth
weight was associated with lower ability in school sports
and with nonparticipation in LTPA across adulthood. More
precisely, our findings showed that, when compared with
low birth weight, those in heavier birth weight groups were
more likely to be rated by their school teacher as above
average or average rather than below average in sports at age
13 yr and were more likely to participate in LTPA between
ages 36 and 68 yr. These associations were only partly
attenuated after adjustment for a range of covariates.
Comparison with other studies. Some of the other
studies that have previously investigated this association in
younger more recently born cohorts support our findings
(1,3,18). These include a meta-analysis which showed that
Scandinavian adolescents and adults in lower birth weight
groups (range = 1.26–2.75 kg) were less likely to participate in
LTPA than the reference birth weight group (3.26–3.75 kg)
(1) and higher levels of leisure-time physical inactivity
reported by 23-yr-old Brazilian women born in 1982 with low
birth weight (G2.50 kg) (3). Also supporting our results are
findings of less participation in outdoor sporting activity by
12-yr-old Australian adolescents with low birth weight
(G2.00 kg) that persisted during 5-yr follow-up (18).
We found that associations between low birth weight and
lower likelihood of LTPA were consistent across adult life,
which is similar to animal studies showing offspring from
undernourished mothers to be less physically active across
life, including at older adult ages, when compared with
normal offspring (42). That associations between birth
weight and LTPA were apparent at older ages is similar to
findings from a Finnish study showing older adults with an
average age of 62 yr reported higher intensity LTPA if they
were bigger at birth in terms of weight and length (33).
The results presented here are not consistent with null
associations reported between birth weight and physical
activity levels in children (26,28). However, as associations
between birth weight and chronic disease tend to be more
apparent later in life (38,41); this may also be the case for
LTPA (1,3,18,33). Likewise, it is also thought that associa-
tions between preterm birth and LTPA tend to be more ap-
parent in adulthood and adolescence than in childhood (11).
Our findings are also in contrast to a study from the next oldest
British birth cohort born in 1958 where the authors reported
that no differences were found between low (G2.50 kg) and
heavier birth weights in levels of LTPA assessed in middle
adulthood, but no estimate was provided (30).
Explanation of findings. Our findings suggest that
prenatal growth may influence sports ability and participation
in LTPA across life (8,13). Motor deficits including difficul-
ties in movement-related tasks and other neurocognitive im-
pairments have been reported in children with low birth
weight (27), which may explain the associations found here
with lower ability in school sports. A lower sports ability in
early life has also been shown to be associated with less
LTPA in adulthood (20,29,30); however, adjustment for
sports ability only marginally reduced the association be-
tween birth weight and adulthood LTPA. Thus, other path-
ways besides tracking of physical activity into adulthood are
likely involved in explaining that finding.
Poorer levels of motor skills and coordination (27), less
favorable body composition (4,23), including weaker muscle
strength (12), and more prevalent chronic disease (5,38,41) in
those with low birth weight may contribute to their higher
probability of nonparticipation in LTPA across adulthood.
Yet the associations found in this study between birth weight
and LTPA were consistent across adulthood, which suggests
that health conditions related to birth weight may not play a
major role in explaining these findings. Consistent with this,
adjusting for adult physical health problems only slightly
weakened the association between birth weight and LTPA.
Methodological considerations. There was some
loss to follow-up in NSHD, as expected in long-running
studies. This led to only slight differences in characteristics
FIGURE 1—Log-odds of LTPA for each birth weight group by age in the MRC NSHD. Plots are presented separately for men and women because of
a sex–age interaction, which means that the decline in LTPA is greater in men than women.

 between those included and those with missing data. A
survival selection bias where those healthiest and physically
active from the low birth weight group survive to an older
age is possible and may have biased results toward the null.
However, our modeling strategy maximizes sample size and
improves precision of estimates of association as all in-
dividuals with at least one measure of LTPA are included
under the missing at random assumption (25). Other im-
portant strengths of this study included the collection of
measured birth weights from birth records within weeks of
delivery, an adjustment for important and prospectively
ascertained covariates, and an investigation of age-related
changes in associations with LTPA. In addition, we were
also able to examine the relationship between birth weights
and an indicator of sports ability from early life and to
compare findings with those of participation in LTPA
across adulthood.
One limitation of this study is that information on gesta-
tional age was not available, and therefore we could not
distinguish between those born small-for-gestational age and
those with low birth weight due to preterm birth. However,
there would have been less variation in gestational age in
this study population than that in more recent born cohorts
as preterm births were less likely to survive in the 1940s
(36). As a result of reduced survival, there were a limited
number of participants classified as having low birth weight
in our study, but despite reduced statistical power, associa-
tions were observed with both outcomes. In addition, birth
weight is the only measure of birth size available in NSHD
and is only a proxy marker of the adaptations that a fetus
may make to its body_s structure and function in response to
stress experienced in utero.
Self-reported LTPA can be subject to recall and mis-
classification errors; therefore, a cautious interpretation of the
findings is necessary. However, questionnaires/interviews
help capture contextual circumstances surrounding physical
activity, making them suitable for widespread gathering of
data on activity types and domains such as LTPA (35). If there
was differential reporting of LTPA by birth weight groups,
this could bias our findings; however, we have no reason to
suspect this to be the case. Furthermore, when self-reported
physical activity and data from activity monitors were com-
pared in a subsample of this cohort, they were found to rank
study participants similarly by levels of physical activity (15).
Those participating in LTPA across adulthood were also
found to spend greater amounts of time in moderate-to-
vigorous intensity activity as assessed by these monitors
when compared with others reporting no LTPA (17). The
LTPA measures used here were relatively crude in that they
summarized activity according to whether any participation in
LTPA was reported. However, even small amounts of LTPA
are important for health particularly in older populations
(2,39). Further, in supplementary analyses, we were able to
show a dose–response nature to this association, suggesting
those with low birth weights were even less likely to report
higher levels of LTPA across adulthood.
Implications. It is important to recognize that those with
low birth weight may require more support than others if
they are to achieve sufficient physical activity across life to
realize its health benefits (2,16,39). The associations ob-
served are likely to be generalizable to more recently born
cohorts because associations have been seen in the same
direction in younger cohorts (1,3,18). The increasing long-
term survival rates of babies born with low birth weight
(36,40) means that there are increasing numbers of adults
who were born with low birth weight and thus there may be
a growing proportion of the population who are at greater
risk of having lower competence at sports and who are un-
likely to be participating in LTPA. Designing appropriate
interventions may require a better understanding of how
related processes such as postnatal growth, motor capability,
and body composition influence physical activity in those
with low birth weight. Furthermore, to allow more mean-
ingful comparison of findings between different cohorts, it
would be useful to harmonize methods of analyses.
In conclusion, findings from this 68-yr prospective
follow-up study of the 1946 British birth cohort showed that,
when compared with those with low birth weight, other study
participants with heavier birth weights were less likely to be
rated by their school teacher as below average at sports and
were more likely to participate in LTPA across adulthood.
Understanding the underlying biological, developmental,
and social processes that explain the relationship between
low birth weight and low sports ability and nonparticipation
in LTPA may help identify appropriate characteristics of
effective interventions.
