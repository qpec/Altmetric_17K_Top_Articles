A
lthough out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major 
public health problem,1 individual paramedics are rarely 
exposed to these cases.2–7 Survival to hospital discharge from 
OHCA is infrequent (<10%)8 and dependent on the quality 
and timing of treatment provided by paramedics.9–15 Given 
that resuscitation skills decay over time16 and OHCA treat-
ment often falls short of the recommended standard,9–14 the 
number of OHCAs that paramedics are exposed to may be 
contributing to low survival rates.
The limited literature available indicates that exposure to 
OHCA for individual paramedics is rare2–7 and declining.2,3 
For example, in our region, we found that on average para-
medics and first responders only treat 1.4 OHCAs a year.2 
Such low exposure may impact on the paramedics’ ability to 
perform resuscitation skills according to the guidelines, which 
is vital to patient survival. However, data exploring the asso-
ciation between OHCA exposure and survival is lacking, with 
a recent systematic review17 finding only one previous study 
involving prehospital physicans18 and no studies involving 
paramedics.
Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine the association 
between paramedic exposure to OHCA resuscitation and patient 
survival to hospital discharge. We also examined the paramedics’ 
decision to initiate resuscitation in OHCA and 2 other exposure 
variables: (1) paramedic career experience and (2) time since 
previous paramedic exposure to OHCA resuscitation.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 10 years of data 
from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry (VACAR) 
and the Ambulance Victoria (AV) employment database to measure 
the association between paramedic exposure to OHCA resuscitation 
and OHCA patient survival. This study was approved by the Monash 
University Human Research Ethics Committee (project number: 
CF13/971-2013000471). The need for patient consent was waived 
Background—Although out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major public health problem, individual paramedics are 
rarely exposed to these cases. In this study, we examined whether previous paramedic exposure to OHCA resuscitation 
is associated with patient survival.
Methods and Results—For the period 2003 to 2012, we linked data from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry 
to Ambulance Victoria’s employment data set. We defined exposure as the number of times a paramedic attended an 
OHCA where resuscitation was attempted in the 3 years preceding each case. Using a multivariable model adjusting 
for known predictors of survival, we measured the association between paramedic OHCA exposure and patient survival 
to hospital discharge. During the study period, there were 4151 paramedics employed and 48 291 OHCAs (44% with 
resuscitation attempted). The median exposure of all paramedics was 2 (interquartile range 1–3) OHCAs/year. Eleven 
percent of paramedics were not exposed to any OHCA cases. Increased paramedic exposure was associated with reduced 
odds of attempted resuscitation (P<0.001). In the 3 years preceding each OHCA where resuscitation was attempted, the 
median exposure of the treating paramedics was 11 (interquartile range 6–17) OHCAs. Compared with patients treated 
by paramedics with a median of ≤6 exposures during the previous 3 years (7% survival), the odds of survival were higher 
for patients treated by paramedics with >6 to 11 (12%, adjusted odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.04–1.54), >11 
to 17 (14%, adjusted odds ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.04–1.59), and >17 exposures (17%, adjusted odds ratio 
1.50, 95% confidence interval 1.22–1.86). Paramedic years of experience were not associated with survival.
Conclusions—Patient survival after OHCA significantly increases with the number of OHCAs that paramedics have 
previously treated.  (Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2016;9:154-160. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.115.002317.)

Setting
Our study was set in the Australian state of Victoria, an area covering 
227 000 km.2 In 2012, Victoria had a population of 5.7 million; the major-
ity (75%) of whom lived in the capital city of Melbourne.20 In Australia, 
each state is serviced by a single emergency medical service (EMS). The 
state of Victoria is serviced by A
V, which attends ≈5000 OHCAs a year.21
AV is predominantly staffed by advanced life support (ALS; 
82%) and intensive care paramedics (14%), with the remainder be-
ing volunteers with basic life support training. Currently, paramed-
ics in Victoria are required to undertake a 3-year bachelor degree 
in paramedicine followed by a supervised in-field graduate year. In 
addition to this training, intensive care paramedics complete a post-
graduate diploma in emergency health. Where available, 2 intensive 
care paramedics and 2 ALS paramedics are dispatched concurrently 
to OHCAs. In addition, fire fighters and community emergency re-
sponse teams provide a first response with automatic external defi-
brillators in select areas of Melbourne and rural communities.
OHCA management in Victoria is directed by the AV clinical prac-
tice guidelines22 that are based on recommendations by the Australian 
Resuscitation Council.23 ALS paramedics are authorized to perform 
manual defibrillation, administer intravenous adrenaline, and insert 
supraglottic airways. Additionally, intensive care paramedics are au-
thorized to administer amiodarone, perform endotracheal intubation, 
insert intraosseous cannulae, and provide advanced post resuscitation 
care (rapid sequence induction, sedation, and adrenaline infusion). 
Resuscitation skills are not formally accredited after university training, 
and they are presumed to be maintained through exposure to OHCA and 
via continuing education with no mandatory recertification. ALS and 
intensive care paramedics can decide to withhold resuscitation when 
the first monitored rhythm is asystole and cardiac arrest duration is >10 
minutes or where there is evidence of body decomposition, rigor mortis, 
or injuries incompatible with life. Resuscitation can be ceased in the 
field where ALS resuscitation has been performed for >30 minutes, the 
current rhythm is not shockable, and no other signs of life are present.
Data Sources
The VACAR contains prospectively collected data on all OHCAs that 
are responded to by an emergency ambulance in Victoria.21 In addi-
tion to standard Utstein24 data elements, the VACAR contains infor-
mation on which paramedics were present at each OHCA. Our study 
cohort included adult OHCAs (≥15 years of age) of all etiologies 
attended by AV paramedics throughout Victoria for the years 2003 to 
2012. Cases are recorded in the VACAR as presumed cardiac etiol-
ogy where no other obvious cause (eg, trauma) is documented on 
the patient care record. EMS response times were recorded from the 
receipt of the call for help to the arrival of the first EMS resource 
on scene (ambulance, firetruck, or community emergency response 
team). Survival to hospital discharge data are obtained from hos-
pital medical records and validated against death records from the 
Victorian Registry of Births, Deaths, and Marriages. VACAR is ap-
proved as a quality assurance initiative by the Victorian Department 
of Health Human Research Ethics Committee, and the collection of 
patient outcomes is approved by the ethics committees of participat-
ing Victorian hospitals.
We successfully linked >99% of OHCAs where resuscitation was 
attempted with at least one paramedic in the AV employee database. 
The employee database contains the qualification and date of employ-
ment of all paramedics employed by AV. We included paramedics 
who were available to respond to an OHCA at any time during the 
outcome analysis period. The employee data set was current as of 
December 31, 2012, or the paramedic’s last day of employment.
Study Definitions
We defined exposure to OHCA as attendance at an OHCA where 
resuscitation was attempted (cardiopulmonary resuscitation and de-
fibrillation). To measure previous exposure, we counted the number 
of paramedic OHCA exposures in the preceding 3 years before each 
case. We considered 3 years to be the maximum amount of time in 
which a previous OHCA exposure could affect paramedic perfor-
mance and patient outcome. The same time period was used by Wang 
et al25 in their study of paramedic exposure to endotracheal intubation 
and OHCA survival. In our study, paramedic exposure was measured 
from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2012, and outcomes were 
measured from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2012.
To examine the effect of all paramedics on scene, we calculated 
the median previous exposures for all paramedics present at each 
OHCA. When we analyzed the secondary outcome (the paramedics’ 
decision to attempt resuscitation), we only examined the previous 
OHCA exposures of the paramedics in the first ambulance to arrive 
on scene because they are responsible for the decision to commence 
resuscitation.
To measure the amount of time since paramedics were last ex-
posed to OHCA, we counted the number of months since each 
paramedic last treated an OHCA. To measure paramedic career ex-
perience, we counted the number of years between the paramedic’s 
first day of employment and the day of the arrest. We then calculated 
the median of these values for all paramedics present and the first 
paramedics to arrive on scene.
In the sub-cohort consisting of only those OHCA cases where re-
suscitation was attempted, we divided the exposure and experience 
measures into quartiles. For the purpose of comparison, we used the 
same categories to examine the secondary outcome in all OHCA cases.
Statistical Analysis
The primary outcome measure of this study was survival to hospi-
tal discharge. The paramedics’ decision to attempt resuscitation was 
also analyzed as a secondary outcome. We used multivariable logis-
tic regression models to measure the association between exposure 
and outcome measures, adjusting for known predictors of survival, as 
well as the number of paramedics on scene. The variables included 
in the multivariable regression analysis were patient age (continu-
ous), patient sex (male/female), public location (home versus pub-
lic location), rural location (yes/no), witness (bystander/EMS/not 
witnessed), bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (yes/no), EMS 
response time (continuous), shockable rhythm (yes/no), presumed 
cardiac etiology (yes/no), presence of an intensive care paramedic 
(yes/no), and number of paramedics on scene (continuous). For EMS-
witnessed OHCAs, we entered the response time as zero minutes and 
indicated no bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The indepen-
dent variables entered in the model included median paramedic expo-
sure to OHCA in the preceding 3 years (continuous and categorical 
in quartiles), median career experience of paramedics (categorical in 
quartiles), and the median number of months since the paramedics’ 
previous OHCA exposures (categorical). When the independent vari-
able was exposure or time since exposure, we adjusted for experience 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Paramedics are rarely exposed to cardiac arrest.
• Resuscitation skills decay over time and often fall 
short of the recommended standard.
• Survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is depen-
dent on the quality and timing of treatment provided 
by paramedics.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• Patient survival increased with the number of cardiac 
arrests that paramedics had previously treated.
• Patient survival was lower when paramedics had not 
treated a cardiac arrest during the preceding 6 months.

in the model and conversely when experience was the independent 
variable we adjusted for exposure.
We performed several sensitivity analyses. First, we used 2 and 1 
year exposure periods instead of the 3 year period to test the robustness 
of the results in our model. Second, we examined the most exposed 
individual paramedic at scene to compare the effect of an individual 
paramedic versus a team. Third, to examine whether differences in 
attempted resuscitation among exposure groups lead to selection bias, 
we examined paramedic OHCA exposure in all OHCAs, regardless 
of resuscitation being attempted. Finally, we examined paramedic 
OHCA resuscitation exposure in 2 specific OHCA cohorts: (1) para-
medic-witnessed OHCAs and (2) bystander-witnessed OHCAs with 
a shockable initial rhythm. Statistical analysis was performed using 
Stata 12 (StataCorp), and P values <0.05 were considered significant.
Results
During the study period, there were 4151 paramedics 
employed by AV, and 48 291 OHCAs attended (Table 1). Dur-
ing the 7-year outcome analysis period (2006–2012), para-
medics (n=3590) attended 34 494 OHCAs. Of these, 15 362 
cases (45%) had resuscitation attempted by paramedics. Typi-
cally 4 paramedics (interquartile range [IQR] 2–4) attended 
OHCAs where resuscitation was attempted and 2 paramed-
ics (IQR 2-2) attended cases where resuscitation was not 
attempted. During the outcome analysis period (2006–2012), 
survival to hospital discharge in cases where resuscitation was 
attempted was 12% overall and 30% in patients presenting in a 
shockable rhythm (initial cardiac arrest rhythm of ventricular 
fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia). The majority of para-
medics were employed fulltime (86%), and 18% was working 
in intensive care paramedic roles (Table 2).
Paramedic Exposure to OHCA
The median exposure of all paramedics was 2 (IQR 1–3) 
OHCAs per year. Eleven percent of paramedics were not 
exposed to any OHCA cases receiving attempted resuscitation 
during the outcome analysis period. Across cases where resus-
citation was attempted, the median exposure of the treating 
paramedics was 11 (IQR 6–17) OHCAs in the 3 years preced-
ing each case. The adjusted odds of attempted resuscitation 
were significantly lower for patients where the first paramed-
ics to arrive on scene had a median of >17 OHCA exposures 
(adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.71–0.93) compared with those responded to by paramedics 
with ≤6 (Figure A;Tables I and II in the Data Supplement).
There was a 1% increase in the odds of patient survival 
for every additional increase in the median OHCA exposure 
of the paramedics (AOR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01–1.02). Compared 
with patients treated by paramedics with a median of ≤6 
exposures during the previous 3 years (7% survival), the odds 
of survival were higher for patients treated by paramedics 
with >6 to 11 (12%, AOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04–1.54), >11 to 
17 (14%, AOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.04–1.59), and >17 exposures 
(17%, AOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.22–1.86; Figure B; Tables III and 
IV in the Data Supplement). The sensitivity tests examining 
exposure over shorter periods (1- and 2 years) revealed simi-
lar results (Figures I and II in the Data Supplement). Similar 
trends were also seen when using the number of OHCA expo-
sures of the paramedic with the most exposures on scene 
and when the sample comprised (1) paramedic-witnessed 
OHCAs, (2) bystander-witnessed OHCAs with a shockable 
initial rhythm, and (3) all OHCAs, regardless of resuscita-
tion being attempted (Figures III–VI in the Data Supplement). 
The association between paramedic exposure to OHCA and 
patient survival was linear; therefore, there was no threshold 
number of OHCA exposures at which survival significantly 
improved.
Paramedic Career Experience
Across cases where resuscitation was attempted, the median 
career experience of the treating paramedics was 8 (IQR 
5–11) years. Compared with patients where the first paramed-
ics to arrive on scene had a median of ≤5 years of experience, 
the odds of paramedic-attempted resuscitation were lower for 
patients treated by paramedics with >5 to 8 (AOR 0.93, 95% 
CI 0.85–1.01), >8 to 11 (AOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.70–0.86), and 
>11 years of experience (AOR 0.62, 95% CI 0.57–0.67; Fig-
ure C; Tables V and VI in the Data Supplement). Paramedic 
experience was not significantly associated with patient sur-
vival (Figure D; Tables VII and VIII in the Data Supplement).
Time Since Paramedics Were Last Exposed to 
OHCA
The median time between OHCAs cases where resuscita-
tion was attempted was 2 (IQR 1–4) months. Compared with 
patients attended by paramedics with a median of ≤1 month 
since their last OHCA exposure, the adjusted odds of resus-
citation being attempted (AOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79–0.95) and 
survival (AOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54–0.91) were lower for those 
attended by paramedics with >6 months (Figure E and F; 
Tables IX–XII in the Data Supplement).
Discussion
This is the first study to examine the association between para-
medic exposure to OHCA resuscitation and patient survival. 
We found that OHCA survival to hospital discharge signifi-
cantly increased with the number of OHCAs that paramed-
ics had treated in the previous 3 years. We also found that 
OHCA survival was lower when paramedics had not treated 
an OHCA during the preceding 6 months. On the other hand, 
we found that although increasing paramedic career experi-
ence significantly predicted paramedics choosing to withhold 
resuscitation, there was no association between paramedic 
career experience and patient survival.
As reported in a recent systematic review,17 few previous 
studies have explored the influence of practitioner OHCA 
exposure on patient survival. Only one study by Bjornsson 
et al18 directly examined the association between OHCA 
exposure and patient survival. They found no difference 
in survival to hospital discharge in patients resuscitated by 
prehospital physicians with exposure to ≤5 or >5 OHCA 
cases over 4 years, although this finding was limited by the 
study’s small sample size (n=243 OHCA cases), reliance on 
self-reported exposure, and lack of adjustment for important 
predictors of survival. In a larger study, Wang et al25 found 
that very high paramedic exposure to endotracheal intuba-
tion was associated with increased OHCA survival. This 
finding is consistent with our study, given that the majority 
of endotracheal intubations in their prehospital setting were 
performed on OHCA patients.

Our finding of a lack of association between paramedic 
career experience and patient survival is consistent with 2 
previous international studies.6,7 However, we also found 
that paramedic experience was a strong predictor of resus-
citation being withheld. In other studies, physicians were 
also less likely to attempt resuscitation as they become more 
experienced,26,27which may indicate that experience leads to 
more confident decision-making or, alternatively, pessimism. 
Therefore, it is important that all studies examining the effect 
of practitioner factors in OHCA consider the influence these 
factors will also have on the decision to attempt resuscitation 
to prevent misinterpretation of results.28
We found that patient survival decreased when paramedics 
had not treated an OHCA for >6 months. This period of time 
is similar to the time in which ALS skills deteriorate (6–12 
months) after training.16 This suggests that 6-month exposure 
to either OHCA cases or resuscitation training might be 
required to prevent skill deterioration and to maximize patient 
survival.
Across our large region and workforce, individual expo-
sure to OHCA cases that received an attempted resuscitation 
was low. On average, individual paramedics were exposed to 
2 OHCAs a year, and 1 in 10 had no exposures in the 7-year 
period. These findings highlight the need for EMS agencies to 
monitor individual paramedic exposure to critical skills, such 
as OHCA resuscitation. Such information can inform the need 
for additional training when exposure is low or when there is 
an extended period between exposures.
Although our study did not collect any data on the quality 
of treatment provided, it is likely that paramedics who fre-
quently and repeatedly use their OHCA resuscitation skills 
may be more adept at early defibrillation and high quality

chest compressions. One possible supplement to actual resus-
citation exposure is simulation training, which could help 
paramedics attain the higher survival rates achieved by para-
medics with high exposure to actual OHCAs. In the hospital 
setting, simulation has been shown to improve practitioner 
skill performance,29–34 and there is some indication that it may 
improve patient survival.31,35 Another option is formal debrief-
ing, which helps paramedics to learn from every OHCA that 
they attend. Hospital studies have shown that debriefing after 
cardiac arrests can improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
quality,36,37 return of spontaneous circulation,36 and survival 
with favorable neurological outcome.37
Other healthcare disciplines have attempted to address 
the problem of infrequent exposure to complex skills through 
practitioner specialization and the development of specialist 
centers, such as trauma centers.38,39 However, these options 
are limited for OHCAs that can happen anywhere in the com-
munity and require an immediate response from the closest 
paramedics. This is especially true in regions where there is 
an extensive service area and large paramedic workforce. One 
possible strategy in this setting is the use of intensive care 
paramedics (who had the highest exposure to OHCA in our 
study), who can act as cardiac arrest specialists in a team, 
modifying the effect of widespread low exposure. Intensive 
care paramedics are more likely to respond to other high acu-
ity cases, such as major trauma, where they may be exposed 
to technical and nontechnical skills which are also used in 
OHCA resuscitation.
Limitations
There were several limitations to our study. First, this is an 
observational study. Although we adjusted for many of the 
known predictors of survival, there may be other unknown 
or unmeasured factors that we were unable to include, such 
as hospital volume or capability. Second, a small number 
of OHCA cases could not be linked to the employment 
records of all paramedics present. However, 99% of OHCAs 
where resuscitation was attempted were successfully linked 
with at least one paramedic in the AV employee database. 
Third, our results may not apply to other smaller services 
because this study was conducted in the context of a large 
EMS servicing both urban and rural areas where regular 
resuscitation training was not routinely provided. Fourth, 
the odds of attempted resuscitation varied across exposure 
and experience categories, which may have led to selec-
tion bias in the analysis of patient survival. However, the 
association between exposure and survival was consistent 
when all OHCAs were included in the analysis, regardless 
of resuscitation being attempted and persisted in paramedic-
witnessed OHCAs where selection bias is less likely to occur 
because of the higher attempted resuscitation rate. Fifth, the 
3-year period we used to measure previous exposure was 
chosen arbitrarily. However, a sensitivity analysis using 1- 
and 2-year periods of exposure yielded similar results. We 
deliberately chose not to use cumulative exposure to OHCA 
because this figure would closely reflect career experience, 
and many paramedics started their careers before the data 
collection period. Finally, our study focused on the expo-
sure of the whole team of paramedics rather than analyzing 
exposure at an individual level. However, when we examined 
the effect of the most exposed paramedic on scene, a similar 
trend was observed.
Notwithstanding these limitations, our study has a number 
of strengths. It is a large population-based study and the first 
to examine the association between paramedic exposure to 
OHCA and patient survival. Also, paramedics were unlikely 
to be exposed to cardiac arrest in other settings because 86% 
of paramedics were employed fulltime, and AV is the sole pro-
vider of emergency medical services in the state of Victoria 
and only operates in the prehospital setting.
Conclusions
Patient survival significantly increases with the number of 
OHCAs that paramedics have treated during the previous 3 
years. In addition, outcomes are improved if it has been <6 
months since the paramedics last treated an OHCA. These 
findings suggest that paramedic exposure to OHCA resuscita-
tion needs to be monitored, and strategies to supplement expo-
sure, such as simulation training, should be explored.
