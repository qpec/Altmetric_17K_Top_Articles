Abstract
Background: Supported self-management has been recommended by asthma guidelines for three decades;
improving current suboptimal implementation will require commitment from professionals, patients and healthcare
organisations. The Practical Systematic Review of Self-Management Support (PRISMS) meta-review and Reducing
Care Utilisation through Self-management Interventions (RECURSIVE) health economic review were commissioned
to provide a systematic overview of supported self-management to inform implementation. We sought to
investigate if supported asthma self-management reduces use of healthcare resources and improves asthma
control; for which target groups it works; and which components and contextual factors contribute to effectiveness.
Finally, we investigated the costs to healthcare services of providing supported self-management.
Methods: We undertook a meta-review (systematic overview) of systematic reviews updated with randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) published since the review search dates, and health economic meta-analysis of RCTs. Twelve
electronic databases were searched in 2012 (updated in 2015; pre-publication update January 2017) for systematic
reviews reporting RCTs (and update RCTs) evaluating supported asthma self-management. We assessed the quality
of included studies and undertook a meta-analysis and narrative synthesis.
Results: A total of 27 systematic reviews (n = 244 RCTs) and 13 update RCTs revealed that supported self-management
can reduce hospitalisations, accident and emergency attendances and unscheduled consultations, and improve
markers of control and quality of life for people with asthma across a range of cultural, demographic and healthcare
settings. Core components are patient education, provision of an action plan and regular professional review. Self-
management is most effective when delivered in the context of proactive long-term condition management. The total
cost (n = 24 RCTs) of providing self-management support is offset by a reduction in hospitalisations and accident and
emergency visits (standard mean difference 0.13, 95% confidence interval −0.09 to 0.34).
Conclusions: Evidence from a total of 270 RCTs confirms that supported self-management for asthma can reduce
unscheduled care and improve asthma control, can be delivered effectively for diverse demographic and cultural
groups, is applicable in a broad range of clinical settings, and does not significantly increase total healthcare costs.
Informed by this comprehensive synthesis of the literature, clinicians, patient-interest groups, policy-makers and
providers of healthcare services should prioritise provision of supported self-management for people with asthma as a
core component of routine care.

Background
Asthma is common, affecting 334 million people world-
wide, and is responsible for substantial morbidity and an
increasing burden on healthcare services globally [1]. In
the UK, there are over 6 million primary care consulta-
tions, and 100,000 hospital admissions each year, at an
estimated cost of £1 billion per year [2].
For a quarter of a century [3], national and international
guidelines have recommended – unequivocally – that
people with asthma
should
be provided with self-
management education reinforced by a personalised
asthma action plan and supported by regular review [4, 5],
though mode of delivery, personnel delivering the support,
the targeted group and the intensity of the intervention
vary [6]. The 2014 UK National Review of Asthma Deaths
provided a stark reminder of the importance of ensuring
that people with asthma respond in a timely and appropri-
ate manner to deteriorating symptoms: only 23% had
documented evidence of having been provided with self-
management education and 45% of people who died had
not sought or received medical attention in their final
attack [7].
However, despite self-management being highlighted as
a core component of all models of care for people with
long-term conditions (LTCs) [8–10] and the concept
being well established in the context of asthma [4, 5], in
practice only a minority of people with asthma have an
action plan [11]. Effective implementation requires a
whole systems approach, combining active engage-
ment of patients with the training and motivation of
professionals
embedded
within
an
organisation
in
which self-management is valued [12]. Patient organi-
sations, healthcare professionals, policy-makers, com-
missioners and providers of healthcare services thus need
an up-to-date systematic overview of the evidence to
inform decisions about prioritisation of supported self-
management and to underpin implementation strategies
within diverse healthcare systems.
The data presented in this paper are derived from
two parallel programmes of work on supported self-
management in LTCs commissioned by the National
Institute
of
Health
Research:
Practical
Systematic
Review of Self-Management Support (PRISMS) [13]
and Reducing Care Utilisation through Self-management
Interventions (RECURSIVE) [14]. In the context of
asthma, we aimed to answer questions of importance to
clinicians, patient-interest groups, managers responsible
for developing healthcare services and policy-makers: can
supported self-management reduce the use of healthcare
resources and improve asthma control? More specifically,
in which target groups has it been shown to work, which
components are important, in what healthcare contexts,
and at what cost?
Methods
We used established methodology for undertaking a
meta-review of systematic reviews (PRISMS) and a sys-
tematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
(RECURSIVE) [15]. The PRISMS and RECURSIVE re-
views were undertaken during 2012–2013 with initial
searches completed in November 2012 and May 2012,
respectively. We updated the PRISMS searches in March
2015 with a pre-publication update in January 2017, and
the RECURSIVE searches in September 2015. RECUR-
SIVE is registered on PROSPERO: CRD42012002694.
(PRISMS could not be registered because PROSPERO
does not register meta-reviews.)
Search strategy
Table 1 summarises the PICOS criteria, search strat-
egies, sources and search dates; further details are in
Additional file 1. The PRISMS search strategy in-
volved searching nine electronic databases using the
terms: ‘self-management support’ AND ‘asthma’ AND
‘systematic review’. We defined self-management as
‘the tasks that individuals must undertake to live with
one or more chronic conditions. These tasks include
having the confidence to deal with medical manage-
ment, role management and emotional management
of their conditions’ [16]. For the update, we searched
not only for systematic reviews published after our
initial search date but also for RCTs published after
the search dates used by the included systematic
reviews (see Additional file 2 for the details of these
dates).
Included
systematic
reviews
were
grouped
according to the populations studied (children, adults
or ethnic minority groups) and the search dates of
the reviews extracted. Dates for the update RCT
search were set from the date of the latest review
search within each population group.
The RECURSIVE search strategy in nine databases
comprised the terms: ‘self-management support’ AND
‘long-term condition’ AND ‘healthcare use’ AND ‘rando-
mised controlled trial’. (RECURSIVE included asthma
Pinnock et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:64 
Page 2 of 32
 and other LTCs in a single search.) We also specifically
sought health economic publications linked to included
RCTs.
Identification of relevant papers
Table 2 summarises the PRISMS and RECURSIVE pro-
cesses. Following training (repeated cycles of duplicate
screening of 100 titles, team discussion and clarification of
exclusion rules), one reviewer (HLP or GP for PRISMS;
LD for the update; MP for RECURSIVE) reviewed titles
and abstracts and selected possibly relevant studies. A ran-
dom sample of titles and abstracts (10% in PRISMS; 40%
in RECURSIVE) was examined by a second reviewer (HP
for
PRISMS;
PB
or
NS
for
RECURSIVE)
working
independently as a quality check. The agreement was 97%
for the initial search and 99% for the update in PRISMS
and 87% for the initial search and 88% for the update in
RECURSIVE.
After a similar training process, the full texts of all
potentially eligible studies were assessed against the
eligibility criteria (see Additional file 3) by one reviewer
(HLP for PRISMS; LD for update; MP for RECURSIVE).
Second reviewers undertook a 10% check for PRISMS
(HP) and a 30% check for RECURSIVE (PB or NS),
achieving 83% and 85% agreement, respectively. Disagree-
ments were because unclear papers were included by the
reviewer pending discussion with a lead investigator.
Uncertainties and disagreements were resolved by full
team discussion.
Assessment of methodological quality
We used the R-AMSTAR (Revised Assessment of Multiple
Systematic Reviews [17]) quality appraisal tool to assess the
methodological quality of the systematic reviews included
in the PRISMS study. This reflects both the quality of the
review process and the rigour with which the review
assessed the quality of the studies it included. We used the
Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess the quality of RCTs in-
cluded in the updated search [15]. Quality assessment was
undertaken by HLP or LD and independently by a second

 reviewer (HP) with disagreements resolved by discussion
within the team (EE, GP, HLP, ST and HP).
To reflect both quality and size of the review, we
developed a star weighting system based on (a) the R-
AMSTAR score (≥31 was defined as ‘high-quality’) and
(b) the number of participants (≥1000 participants was
defined as ‘large’):
*** Large high-quality review
** Either small high-quality review or large
low-quality review
* Small low-quality review
In the RECURSIVE study, quality assessment of
formal economic evaluations was undertaken using
the Drummond checklist [18, 19]; RCTs reporting
healthcare utilisation were assessed by judging allo-
cation
concealment
(the
quality
component
most
associated with treatment effect [20]) as adequate or
inadequate according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias
tool [15].
Outcomes
The primary outcome in the PRISMS meta-review was
unscheduled use of healthcare resources (specifically un-
scheduled consultations, accident and emergency (A&E)
department attendances and hospital admissions). Other
outcomes of interest were asthma control, asthma-
related quality of life and process outcomes (specifically,
ownership of action plans). Healthcare utilisation rates
and costs were the primary focus of the RECURSIVE re-
view, especially major cost drivers (i.e. hospitalisation
rates and costs) and comprehensive summaries including
multiple sources of cost. The results of formal cost-
effectiveness, cost-utility and cost–benefit analyses were
also of interest.

 Extraction of data
Data for the PRISMS review were extracted by HLP and
LD (update) using a piloted data extraction form, and
checked independently by HP for integrity and accuracy.
Disagreements were resolved by team discussion. We
extracted data on review rationale, the self-management
intervention under review, review methodology, summary
details of included RCTs (participant demographics, com-
parison groups, settings, service arrangements, compo-
nents, duration/intensity of the intervention, follow-up
arrangements) and the results of meta-analyses and narra-
tive syntheses. We extracted the findings and conclusions
as synthesised by the authors of the systematic reviews,
specifically avoiding going back to the individual primary
studies. The RCTs in the update review were extracted
using similar headings.
A piloted data extraction sheet was devised for RE-
CURSIVE that included descriptive data (characteristics
of studies, populations and interventions) and quantita-
tive data (for use in meta-analyses). All the descriptive
data and approximately 40% of the quantitative data
were double-extracted by two members of the research
team working independently.
Data analysis
Meta-analysis is inappropriate at the meta-review level
owing to the overlap of included RCTs between reviews.
However, for the primary outcome, where two or more
systematic reviews (including the RECURSIVE meta-
analyses) present pooled statistics, we displayed the
results graphically by creating ‘meta-Forest plots’. We
undertook narrative syntheses to answer our key ques-
tions: Does supported self-management reduce use of
healthcare resources and improve asthma control? For
which target groups does it work? Which components
contribute to effectiveness? and In what contexts does
supported self-management work? We categorised the
reviews and RCTs included in the PRISMS meta-review
according to the question(s) that they answered (see
Tables 3 and 4: column 3) and synthesised the findings
within these categories.th=tlb=
The
final
question
(What
is
the
effect
of
self-
management on healthcare utilisation and costs?) was
answered by a meta-analysis of the RECURSIVE RCT
data.
The
primary
analysis
explored
whether
self-
management support could reduce utilisation without
compromising outcomes. Standardised mean differences
(SMD) were computed using a random effects model
meta-analysis due to anticipated heterogeneity. Four
meta-analyses examined the effects of self-management
support interventions on hospitalisation rates, A&E
attendances, quality of life and total costs, respectively.
We then constructed permutation plots of the data from
the subset of trials reporting both utilisation (hospitalisation
rates, A&E attendances or total costs) and health outcomes
(quality of life). Further details about the analytic approach
are described in the RECURSIVE report [14]. Forest plots
and permutation plots [21] for the subset of studies report-
ing both health outcomes and utilisation outcomes were
constructed in STATA version 14.
Interpretation and end-of-project workshop
The PRISMS and RECURSIVE teams worked independ-
ently, but held regular teleconferences to enable synergies
between the findings of the parallel reviews to be devel-
oped. Frequent meetings of the multidisciplinary teams
aided interpretation of the emerging findings. Finally, we
held an end-of-project stakeholder conference at which
the findings and over-arching conclusions from PRISMS
and RECURSIVE were presented to 34 multidisciplinary
stakeholders, including people with LTCs, clinicians, com-
missioners, providers of healthcare services and policy-
makers. Small discussion groups discussed and advised on
practical implications for commissioning and providing
services for people with LTCs.
Lay involvement
The PRISMS project (which reviewed evidence from 14
LTCs) benefited from a lay collaborator who was involved
from the inception of the project. She and other lay repre-
sentatives from a range of LTC interest groups (including
Asthma UK) contributed to an initial stakeholder work-
shop at which the choice of LTCs studied in the project
and
self-management
interventions
of
interest
were
discussed. Lay members also participated in the end-of-
project
workshop
(described
above),
which
aided
interpretation and guided dissemination. The PRIMER
patient and public involvement group at the University of
Manchester, UK, collaborated with the RECURSIVE
project.
Updating of searches prior to publication
We updated our PRISMS searches in January 2017 by
undertaking forward citation of the original included re-
views using Web of Science. Forward citation has been
shown to be an efficient and effective method of identi-
fying relevant papers in systematic reviews of complex
and heterogeneous evidence [22]. We considered it was
very unlikely that a subsequent systematic review or
RCT would be published without citing at least one of
the previously published reviews. One reviewer (HP)
undertook focused data extraction of key findings, which
were checked by MP. The additional data were added
into the syntheses as appropriate. Had we identified
studies that substantially changed our conclusions we
planned to undertake full duplicate data extraction,
quality assessment and revise our synthesis.

 Results
Description of the studies in the meta-review
Figure 1 illustrates the PRISMA flow chart for both
reviews. After removal of duplicates, 9633 references
were identified from the initial PRISMS search and an
additional 6321 from the update search. From these, 25
systematic reviews [23–47] were included in the PRISMS
meta-review, representing data from 240 unique RCTs.
The year of review publication ranged from 1995 to
2013, and included RCTs dated from 1979 to 2013.
In addition we included 13 RCTs published since the
last search dates of the included reviews (2010 for
children, 2012 for adults and 2011 for ethnic groups;
see Additional file 2 for details) [48–60]. (For clarity
we refer to these as “update RCTs”.) A further two
systematic reviews (which included a further four
RCTs) [61, 62] and six RCTs [63–68] were added after
the pre-publication update. The RECURSIVE study in-
cluded 24 RCTs with publication dates from 1993 to
2015 [49, 69–91].
After excluding overlap, this represents 270 unique tri-
als undertaken in at least 29 high- or middle-income
countries: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
Chile,
Denmark,
Finland,
France,
Germany,
India,
Israel, Italy, Jordan, Malaysia, Malta, Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
Taiwan, Trinidad, Turkey, UK, USA and Venezuela.
In the 18 systematic reviews that reported the duration
of follow-up in their included RCTs [23–25, 27–29, 33,
35, 38–40, 42–47, 61], the modal duration (in 10 of the
reviews) was 12 months, with only 3% of reported RCTs
falling outside the range of 3–24 months. The update
RCTs had a similar profile, with 6 of 13 update RCTs
having a duration of 12 months (range 3–30 months).
Study quality and weight of evidence
Taking into consideration both study quality and total
population
size,
10
PRISMS
reviews
received
an
evidence weighting of three stars [27, 31, 32, 36–38, 40,
41, 43, 46], 13 were weighted two star [23–26, 29, 30,
Fig. 1 PRISMA flowchart. Note: The initial RECURSIVE search included all long-term conditions: papers reporting asthma randomised controlled
trials (RCTs) were identified from 184 studies included in the full RECURSIVE report [14]
Pinnock et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:64 
Page 15 of 32
 33–35, 39, 42, 44, 45] and two were weighted one star
[28, 47]. Of the PRISMS update RCTs, four were judged
to be at low risk of bias [50–52, 58], five at high risk of
bias [48, 49, 55, 59, 60] and in four the risk of bias was
unclear [53, 54, 56, 57]. Allocation concealment was
judged as adequate in six of the 24 asthma studies
included in the RECURSIVE review [74, 76, 80, 83–85].
Study quality is indicated in the first columns of Tables 3,
4 and 5, with details of the quality assessments in
Additional file 4.
Overview of presentation of results
Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 provide summaries of the studies
included in the PRISMS meta-review, update RCTs, the
RECURSIVE review and pre-publication update with
more detailed tables in Additional file 5.
Can supported self-management reduce the use of
healthcare resources and improve asthma control?
Use of healthcare resources
Figure 2 is a meta-Forest plot illustrating the meta-
analyses (including three PRISMS 3* reviews and RECUR-
SIVE) that report relative risks of admissions, A&E atten-
dances and/or unscheduled consultations [27, 31, 38].
Treatment event rates from the meta-analyses are in
Table 7. These results suggest similar effects in adults
[38], children [27] and mixed populations [31].
Hospitalisations were reported in 12 reviews [25–29,
31, 35, 38, 40, 41, 44, 46]. Six meta-analyses (four 3*,
two 2*) showed that self-management support interven-
tions led to fewer hospital admissions [25–27, 31, 38, 41].
Six narrative reviews of variable quality, reporting hetero-
geneous interventions, showed inconsistent effects on
hospitalisations [28, 29, 35, 40, 44, 46].
Ten reviews reported A&E attendances [25–27, 29, 31,
35, 38, 40, 44, 46]. Four meta-analyses (three 3* [27, 31,
38], one 2* [26]) reported a reduction in A&E atten-
dances in the self-management intervention compared
to control groups. Four narrative reviews (one 3* [46],
three 2* [25, 35, 44]) showed a reduction in A&E atten-
dances in at least half of their included RCTs; one 3*
review showed inconsistent results [40], and one 2*
review showed no benefit on A&E attendances [29].
Of the eight reviews that reported unscheduled care
[24, 27, 28, 31, 34, 35, 43, 44], three 3* meta-analyses
reported fewer unscheduled consultations in participants
who received a self-management intervention when
compared to control [27, 31, 43]. Furthermore, three 2*
narrative
reviews
reported
that
self-management
reduced unscheduled care in at least half their included
trials [34, 35, 44]. The remaining two small or poor
quality reviews had inconsistent results [24, 28].
Asthma control
Of the 10 reviews that reported measures of control
[24, 28, 30, 31, 34, 35, 38, 41, 44, 46], three meta-
analyses (two 3* [31, 41], one 2* [24]) and three narrative
reviews [28, 35, 44] reported a reduction in symptoms in
participants who received self-management interventions
compared to control groups. The other four narrative
reviews (two 3* [30, 34], two 2* [38, 46]) had inconsistent
results [30, 34, 38] or showed no benefit on symptom
control [46]. The broader concept of quality of life was
reported as improved in some reviews [25, 30, 34, 46], but
not others [27, 29, 40, 44].
Six reviews reported a reduction in days missed
from school or work [24, 29–31, 38, 41]. Two 3*
meta-analyses [31, 41], two small reviews each with
only one RCT [24, 29] and five of the 13 RCTs in a
2* narrative synthesis of school-based interventions
[30]
concluded
that
self-management
interventions
reduced absenteeism. A single RCT reported in a 3*
narrative
review
in
adults
concluded
that
asthma
education following A&E attendance had no effect on
absenteeism [38].
In which target groups has supported self-management
been shown to work?
The systematic reviews encompassed a broad range of
populations in diverse healthcare and demographic set-
tings with consistently positive findings. For example,
the reviews included all ages [28, 31] or only children
[24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 35, 40, 41] or adults [34, 38, 43, 46].
Some focused on lower socioeconomic groups [35, 40]
or ethnic minority communities [25, 29, 35]. The reviews
and RCTs identified in the PRISMS update typically built
on this extensive generic evidence base and investigated
interventions targeting specific groups such as urban
[52, 54], rural [53], deprived communities [46, 52, 54],
cultural groups [46, 54, 55, 60], adolescents [48, 54, 56,
57] or older adults [49, 51]. Table 8 summarises the key
strategies used in trials to tailor interventions, or their
mode of delivery, to different groups.
Cultural groups
Four reviews explored the impact of self-management in
cultural groups [25, 29, 35, 46]. A 2* meta-analysis
reported
that
culture-specific
programmes
reduced
hospitalisations in children and improved quality of life in
adults compared to generic interventions [25]. A 3* narra-
tive synthesis found only two RCTs testing culturally tai-
lored interventions, one of which improved quality of life
[46]. The involvement of community health workers re-
duced use of healthcare resources in two thirds, and im-
proved symptoms in all seven RCTs included in a 2*
narrative review [35]. An inpatient visit from a lay educa-
tor to Black or Latino children improved self-efficacy and

 action plan ownership 1 month post-discharge [66]. In
contrast, three generic interventions in US minority popu-

A&E attendees
Two 3* meta-analyses demonstrated reduced use of

and
in
children with a history of A&E attendance in the
previous 12 months (38 RCTs) [27]. Neither review
found improved markers of asthma control [27, 38],
though an update RCT in paediatric A&E attendees
(low risk of bias) found that children discharged
with an action plan had fewer symptoms at 28 days
compared with usual care [50].

Cultural tailoring
Culturally orientated self-

individual sessions with language-

videos/workbooks featuring culturally
appropriate role models, education
appropriate to socioeconomic
context, strategies for use of local
healthcare services, asthma action
plans.
**Bailey 2009 [25]
Adults and children from
minority groups
Culture-specific programmes
are more effective than
generic programmes in
improving QoL, knowledge
and asthma control but not
all asthma outcomes.
Culturally tailored, community-based
interventions in which healthcare
providers (pharmacists, asthma
educator, social workers, respiratory
nurses) provided language-
appropriate education programmes
including health literacy-focused
teaching, use of videos, asthma
physiology and management, inhaler
technique, PAAP.
***Press 2012 [46]
Adults from minority groups

The 5 (of 15) education
studies that were culturally
tailored showed reduced use
of unscheduled care and
improved QoL, but this is not
compared to non-tailored
interventions.
Internet-based programme
developed to deliver education and
a behaviour change intervention to
African-Americans adolescents.
Strategies include voice-overs to

Young teens
The intervention reduced
symptom-free days but had
no effect on A&E visits/
hospitalisations.
Community
workers
Community health worker from the
same/very similar community as
participating families provided
individually tailored education at
home visits. Topics included asthma,
lifestyle and trigger avoidance, with
resources to reduce allergen
exposure and smoking cessation
support.
**Postma 2009 [35]
Ethnic minority children with
asthma
Interventions involving
community health workers
reduced emergency and
urgent care use in some
but not all studies.
Indigenous healthcare workers
provided personalised, child-friendly,
culturally appropriate education ma-
terials at home visits to reinforce
clinical consultations.
**Chang 2010 [29]
Ethnic minority children with
asthma
The involvement of
indigenous healthcare
workers in asthma
programmes (1 RCT)

but not unscheduled care.
A&E attendees
Education during
the A&E

Education sessions conducted by
asthma or A&E nurses, or, less often,
respiratory specialists or a
physiotherapist. Content varied,
usually including triggers, PAAPs
and/or inhaler technique.
***Tapp 2007 [38]
Adult A&E attendees
Education delivered in A&E
reduced subsequent hospital

some cases, reduced absenteeism [30, 48, 56, 61].
Generic
parenting
skills
initiatives
improved
self-
efficacy in families struggling to manage young chil-
dren with asthma, with inconsistent effect on asthma
outcomes [64, 67].
Two update RCTs reported interventions in older
people that improved control and quality of life [49,
51], and one reduced use of unscheduled care [49]. A
key feature of
both complex interventions was a
structured approach to tailoring in order to meet
personal goals or address individual problems.
Which components of supported self-management are
important?
A 3* meta-analysis (36 RCTs; 6090 participants of all ages
recruited from primary and secondary care settings)
defined optimal self-management as education including

 advice on self-monitoring and a written action plan
that was supported by regular professional review
[31]. There is evidence that reducing the intensity of
self-management education or level of clinical review
may reduce its effectiveness [36].
Components of an action plan
The components of an action plan were further de-
fined in two 3* and three 2* reviews [23, 24, 32, 36,
39]. In adults, self-monitoring based on peak flow or
symptoms is equally effective [32, 36, 39]. In a com-
parison in children, symptom-based plans were more
effective at reducing unscheduled healthcare [23], and
equally
effective
at
improving
most
measures
of
asthma control; the exception was days with symp-
toms, which were reduced more by peak-flow-based
than symptom-based plans [23]. A 3* review con-
cluded that action plans with between two and four
action points, including recommendations on increas-
ing inhaled corticosteroids and initiating oral cortico-
steroids,
were
consistently
effective
in
reducing
admissions and A&E attendances [32].
Behavioural change techniques
One 3* meta-analysis demonstrated that self-management
interventions that incorporated specific behaviour change
techniques reduced unscheduled care and improved con-
trol [43]. Meta-regression of the data from the 38 RCTs
(7883 participants) concluded that active involvement of
participants in the intervention was a key factor in redu-
cing unscheduled healthcare [43]. More specifically, iden-
tifying individual behavioural traits (e.g. rebelliousness,
low perceived emotional support) in adolescents en-
abled targeted use of behavioural change techniques
[54]. A goal-setting approach proved challenging to
implement in primary care settings [63].
Technology
Two 1* narrative reviews investigated computer- or
internet-based interactive self-management programmes
[28, 47]. The effect on healthcare utilisation was incon-
sistent, confirmed by a recent review identified in the
pre-publication
update
[62],
though
both
showed
improvement in symptoms [28] and/or quality of life
[28,
47].
Two
update
RCTs
of
web-based
self-
management programmes for adolescents also showed
improved asthma control [54, 57], and an extended
follow-up of RCT participants concluded that these
effects could be sustained 18 months after conclusion of
the trial [59]. Several school-based programmes used
technology-based interventions to improve control and
reduce absenteeism [30]. Supported self-management
using mobile phone technology currently has a limited
and inconclusive evidence base [42, 45], though a recent
RCT in pregnancy demonstrated improved asthma con-
trol and quality of life [68].
Which contextual factors influence effectiveness?
Resonating with the concept of ‘optimal’ self-management
(education, an action plan and regular review) [31], a 3*
meta-analysis identified that omitting regular review
(1 RCT) or reducing intensity of education (1 RCT)
was associated with a smaller reduction in unsched-
uled consultations [36]. A 2* meta-analysis analysed
the findings of 18 RCTs (3006 participants) according
to the components of the Chronic Care Model [92].
Interventions that included all four components had a
greater effect on adherence to inhaled corticosteroids
compared to trials including self-management unsup-
ported by the organisational components [33].
Organisational role in promoting supported self-management
A 3* narrative review of 14 RCTs (4588 participants) con-
cluded that proactive organisational systems can increase
action plan ownership by promoting uptake of asthma
reviews and implementing (and monitoring) structured
management systems for asthma care [37]. A recent RCT
of a structured approach to self-management education in
both primary care and specialist units improved asthma
control and reduced unscheduled care [65], and a large
cluster RCT at low risk of bias showed an increased adher-
ence to guidelines and reduced asthma symptoms by
systematically providing individualised prompts to general
practitioners and parents of children with asthma [52].
Automatically linking an action plan to prescriptions given
to patients being discharged from A&E improved clinician
management and patient uptake of steroid courses [50].
What is the effect of supported self-management on
healthcare utilisation and costs?
The RECURSIVE meta-analysis confirmed that self-
management
support
interventions
for
people
with
asthma are associated with significant improvements in
quality-of-life outcomes (SMD 0.26, 95% CI 0.12–0.39),
significant small decreases in hospitalisation rates and
costs (SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.40 to −0.01), significant
small decreases in A&E visits (SMD −0.25, 95% CI −0.49
to −0.01), and non-significant small increases in total
healthcare costs (SMD 0.13, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.34).
Figure 3 shows a Forest plot of the total costs.
What is the evidence that supported self-management for
asthma can reduce costs without compromising outcomes?
Figure 4 shows the overall permutation plot of the
studies (n = 21) reporting data on both quality of life and
healthcare utilisation. The majority of the studies on
quality of life versus costs related to hospitalisations and
A&E attendances were in the right-down quadrant,
Pinnock et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:64 
Page 26 of 32
 indicating cost-effectiveness (reduced healthcare utilisa-
tion and improved quality of life). However, in terms of
total costs (n = 7), the picture was mixed with more
studies around zero and the right-up quadrant, indicat-
ing that similar costs or small cost increases are neces-
sary to achieve better quality of life.
What is the evidence that supported self-management for
asthma is cost-effective?
Four studies applied formal economic analyses; two
showed that self-management support interventions were
dominant (i.e. significantly better health outcomes with
significantly lower costs) [72, 86], and two produced non-

self-management interventions on outcomes (quality of life) and utilisation (hospitalisations and total costs) can be visualised simultaneously by
placing them in quadrants of the cost-effectiveness plane depending on the pattern of outcomes. Such plots identify studies in the appropriate
quadrant (i.e. those that reduce costs without compromising outcomes) and those in problematic quadrants (i.e. those that reduce costs but also
compromise outcomes, or those that compromise both outcomes and costs).
Pinnock et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:64

 significant ratios between costs and benefits at levels likely
to appeal to decision-makers (better outcomes with non-
significant increases in costs) [75, 89] (see Additional file 5
for more details).
Thus, the benefits derived by supported self-management
interventions are associated with reductions in key areas of
healthcare utilisation such as hospitalisations and A&E
attendances and can be delivered at similar levels of total
costs to usual care.
Discussion
Summary of findings
Extensive evidence (n = 270 RCTs) derived from a broad
range of demographic and healthcare settings reveals
that supported self-management can reduce hospitalisa-
tions, A&E attendances and unscheduled consultations,
and improve markers of control and quality of life for
people with asthma. Core components of effective self-
management are education, provision of an action plan
and the support of regular professional review. Effective-
ness has been demonstrated in diverse cultural, clinical
and demographic groups, with evidence that tailored
programmes have greater impact than generic interven-
tions. A range of modes of delivery (including telehealth-
care) may be employed to suit preferences and context.
The cost of providing self-management support is offset
by a reduction in hospitalisations and unscheduled
healthcare.
Interpretation of findings
The literature on asthma self-management is particularly
well developed and may thus be an exemplar for other
LTCs [13, 14]. The 16 systematic reviews reporting ef-
fectiveness were typically large (five included data from
>5000 participants [27, 30, 31, 41, 43]) and had consist-
ently positive results, suggesting a mature evidence base,
unlikely to be influenced by further trials. Outcomes in
subgroups were more often the subject of the update
RCTs as the field moves on from demonstrating overall
effectiveness to investigating the impact in specific
target groups [48–58, 60, 61, 72], demographic contexts
[52–54, 66], or mode of delivery [54, 59, 62, 72].
Self-management support for asthma is a complex
intervention and successful interventions were multi-
component,
including
education,
trigger
avoidance,
teaching self-monitoring, optimal treatment strategies,
promotion of adherence and behaviour change tech-
niques, many of which are common to self-management
in other LTCs [6]. Appropriately in a variable condition
[4], the hallmark of asthma self-management is the
provision of an action plan with advice on recognising
and responding to deterioration in control [4, 32].
People with asthma, however, have broader concerns as
they accommodate the condition within their lives and
the action plan needs to be embedded in support for
‘living with asthma’ [93].
Individuals with LTCs adjust medical regimes and self-
management strategies to fit into their own lives and
health beliefs [13]. Meta-reviews, for example in type 2
diabetes [94, 95], hypertension [96] and asthma [25],
have emphasised the importance of culturally tailored
interventions. Self-management support can be provided
by many different professionals, often specialist nurses
[38, 63] or LTC educators [25, 27, 95], but in some con-
texts the key personnel were community health workers
[35, 97] or peer counsellors [30, 56, 66]. Traditionally
education is delivered face-to-face,
but
increasingly
technology-based interventions are being developed as
alternatives [27, 28, 30, 42, 45, 47, 54, 57, 59, 62, 68].
Self-management support interventions are an integral
component of high-quality care for people with LTCs
[8–10]. Several of the systematic reviews demonstrated
the synergy between self-management education and
regular clinical review [31, 33, 36], and supported self-
management is most effective when delivered within a
proactive asthma management programme [33, 37, 65],
or integrated within organisational routines [50, 52].
Only a minority of trials had follow-up periods over
12 months, and studies are needed to confirm long-term
sustainability. Costs associated with self-management
interventions are similar to usual care.
Strengths and limitations
Meta-reviews have some intrinsic strengths and limita-
tions. The methodology enables the efficient review of a
large body of evidence and thus provision of a compre-
hensive overview to inform policy and practice. However,
it relies on the quality of the included systematic reviews
(e.g. comprehensive search strategies, accurate data ex-
traction
and
synthesis).
We
used
the
validated
R-
AMSTAR instrument to assess the quality of included sys-
tematic reviews [17]. In contrast to GRADE [98] (now rec-
ommended
by
the
Cochrane
Handbook
[15]),
R-
AMSTAR assesses the overall quality of the review, rather
than assessing the quality of evidence individually for each
outcome.
Re-synthesising materials that have already been syn-
thesised risks further loss of detail and has the potential
for erroneous assumptions, especially if the primary
focus of the review did not directly align with the ques-
tions of the meta-review. Overlap between the RCTs
included in the systematic reviews may result in undue
emphasis on commonly cited papers.
Whilst some reviews and update RCTs directly com-
pared interventions with or without specific components
[23–25, 32, 36, 39, 43], or a specific mode of delivery
[28, 29, 41, 45], often the different interventions were
compared
to
usual
care,
allowing
only
indirect

Page 28 of 32
 comparison [31, 33, 35, 37, 42, 46, 47]. A further limita-
tion is that ‘usual care’ is rarely defined in RCTs [99],
and the definition is even more unclear at meta-
review level. Typically usual care is enhanced in the
context of a trial, reducing the apparent impact of an
intervention [100].
Systematic reviews are only as current as their
most-recent
search,
and
meta-reviews
add
an
additional time delay. In the PRISMS meta-review we
therefore not only updated our search for systematic
reviews, but also searched for RCTs published after
the date of the last search used by the included
systematic reviews. In addition, prior to publication
we undertook forward citation on all the included
systematic
reviews,
which
identified
two
recent
systematic reviews and six RCTs [61–68]. None of
these changed our conclusions, confirming the matur-
ity of the evidence base.
The two reviewers who undertook the screening
and data extraction were not working independently;
however, both projects ensured all the reviewers were
fully trained and instituted random checks at every
stage. Restricting inclusion to reviews with extractable
RCT data maintained the quality of evidence, but
may have resulted in some lower-grade but useful evi-
dence being rejected.
RECURSIVE
was
not
restricted
to
formal
cost-
effectiveness studies – it had a broader focus and in-
cluded studies reporting data on healthcare utilisation
only, without a full effectiveness analysis including
costs and quality of life. Some of the RCTs in the
RECURSIVE meta-analysis used a more comprehen-
sive definition of ‘total costs’ (e.g. based on societal
perspective) compared to others; to account for this
inconsistency, we also present the results on key
sources of costs such as hospitalisation and A&E
attendance rates.
The PRISMS and RECURSIVE teams worked inde-
pendently, but met regularly throughout the studies
to optimise synergies. A further strength was the
multidisciplinary team, including backgrounds in pub-
lic health, general practice, epidemiology and health
psychology, enabling a balanced interpretation.
Conclusions
Supported self-management for asthma can reduce
unscheduled care, improve asthma control and quality
of life, and does not lead to significant increases in
total
healthcare
costs.
Effective
self-management
should be tailored to cultural, clinical and demo-
graphic characteristics and is most effective when
delivered in the context of proactive LTC manage-
ment. Healthcare organisations should prioritise and
promote the provision of supported self-management
for people with asthma.
