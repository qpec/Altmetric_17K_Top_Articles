IMPORTANCE Current therapy of herpes infections relies on nucleoside analogues. Pritelivir is
a well-tolerated novel herpes simplex virus (HSV) helicase-primase inhibitor that reduced
genital shedding and lesions.
OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of pritelivir with valacyclovir for suppression of genital
HSV-2 infection.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A phase 2, randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical
trial at clinical research centers in 4 US cities (October 2012-July 2013) compared daily oral
doses of 100 mg of pritelivir with 500 mg of valacyclovir. The planned sample size was 98
adults, allowing for detection of a 50% reduction in viral shedding between the study
treatments. Healthy adults with 4 to 9 annual genital HSV-2 recurrences were eligible.
Ninety-one participants were randomized: 45 to receive pritelivir and 46 to receive valacyclovir
first when the US Food and Drug Administration placed the trial on clinical hold based on
findings in a concurrent nonclinical toxicity study, and the sponsor terminated the study.
INTERVENTIONS Participants took the first drug for 28 days followed by 28 days of washout
before taking the second drug for 28 days. Throughout treatment, the participants collected
genital swabs 4 times daily for testing by HSV polymerase chain reaction assays.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Theprimaryendpointwaswithin-participantgenitalHSV

RESULTS Of the 91 randomized participants (median age, 48 years; 57 women [63%]), 56 had
completed both treatment periods at the time of the study’
s termination. In intent-to-treat
analyses, HSV shedding was detected in 2.4% (173 of 7276 ) of swabs during pritelivir
treatment compared with 5.3% (392 of 7453) during valacyclovir treatment (relative risk
[RR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.82; P = .01). In swabs with HSV, the mean quantity of HSV was 3.2
log10 copies/mL during pritelivir treatment vs 3.7 log10 copies/mL during valacyclovir
treatment (difference, −0.1; 95% CI, −0.6 to 0.5; P = .83). Genital lesions were present on
1.9% of days in the pritelivir group vs 3.9% in the valacyclovir group (RR, 0.40; 95% CI,
0.17-0.96; P = .04). The frequency of shedding episodes did not differ by group, with 1.3 per
person-month for pritelivir and 1.6 per person-month for valacyclovir (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.52
to 1.22; P = .29). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 62.3% of participants in the
pritelivir group and 69.2% of participants in the valacyclovir group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with frequently recurring genital HSV-2, the
use of pritelivir compared with valacyclovir resulted in a lower percentage of swabs with HSV
detection over 28 days. Further research is needed to assess longer-term efficacy and safety.

T
he treatment for genital herpes simplex virus (HSV)
infections relies on the nucleoside analogues acyclovir,
valacyclovir, or famciclovir administered either for each
recurrence or daily to prevent recurrences.1 In addition, vala-
cyclovir, when taken daily by a person with genital herpes has
beenshowntoreducetheriskofHSV-2transmissiontosuscep-
tiblepartners.2However,theprotectionisonlypartial(approxi-
mately 50%), likely because these drugs neither completely in-
hibit genital viral shedding nor reduce the risk of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition conferred by HSV-2
infection.3,4 Nucleoside analogues inhibit viral replication by
chain termination of viral DNA after monophosphorylation
by the viral thymidine kinase followed by phosphorylation to
triphosphate by cellular kinases.5 Drug resistance is uncom-
mon in immunocompetent persons but may occur in immuno-
compromised hosts in whom treatment is difficult due to lack
ofsafealternativemedications.Therefore,alternativeagentsto
treat HSV infections are needed.
Pritelivir inhibits HSV replication but at the helicase-
primase complex and does not require an activation step.6 In
a placebo-controlled study, oral pritelivir was well tolerated
and reduced the risk of genital viral shedding in a dose-
dependent manner.7 In the present study, pritelivir was com-
pared with valacyclovir for reduction of genital HSV shed-
ding and lesions in persons with recurrent genital herpes.
Methods
The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are available in
Supplements 1 and 2.
Participants and Procedures
Eligible participants included healthy adults who were aged
18 years or older, HSV-2 seropositive, HIV seronegative, hepa-
titis B and C negative, and had a history of 4 to 9 genital her-
pes recurrences in the last year or in the year prior to starting
suppressive antiviral therapy. Race information was self-
reported. Participants had to agree to use effective contracep-
tion, refrain from using any anti-HSV therapy for 7 days prior
to and during the treatment period, and be willing to com-
plete all trial procedures. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy,
nursing, malignancy or immunosuppression, steroid admin-
istration, other immunosuppressive medications, or medica-
tions that induced drug-metabolizing enzymes or transport-
ers. In addition, participants had to avoid grapefruit and
products containing quinine or quinidine during the study.
All participants gave written informed consent. The study
was approved by the institutional review board at each par-
ticipating institution.
Study Design and Procedures
In this randomized, double-blind, double-dummy crossover
trial,participantsreceived100mgoforalpritelivir(afteraload-
ing dose of 400 mg on day 1) plus placebo or 500 mg of vala-
cyclovir plus placebo daily for 28 days, followed by a 28-day
washoutperiod,andthen28daysoftheotherdrugwithmatch-
ing placebo and 28 days of follow-up. Randomization was con-
ducted centrally with random-number generators using a dy-
namic scheme to ensure treatment balance overall and within
strata,allocatingeachsubsequentparticipanttotheleastpopu-
latedgroup,orinthecaseofties,usingapregeneratedrandom-
number list to determine assignment; the strata used were sex
and study site. Valacyclovir was encapsulated and placebo tab-
lets or capsules were manufactured to be indistinguishable
from active agents to permit blinding of participants and in-
vestigators. Participants were required to be free of genital le-
sions on the first day of each treatment period. Throughout
thetwo28-daytreatmentperiods,participantsobtainedswabs
from their genital area 4 times during each 24-hour period, ap-
proximately6to8hoursapart.Theswabswerebroughttoclinic
at the next weekly visit.8 If a lesion consistent with genital her-
pes developed, an additional swab was obtained from the le-
sionathomeandparticipantscametoclinicforevaluation.Par-
ticipants maintained a diary of genital lesions and symptoms,
and recorded adherence to the swabbing procedure and the
study drugs. Adherence was calculated as the proportion of
the expected amount of the drug taken and calculated by pill
counts of returned blister pack. Adherence to swabs was de-
fined as the proportion of swabs returned of expected.
The dose of 100 mg of pritelivir daily was chosen based on
phase 1 and 2 studies suggesting safety and tolerability of this
regimen and also on the high efficacy of 75 mg of pritelivir in
suppressing viral shedding in the prior trial.7
Safety of the study drugs was evaluated with a weekly his-
tory and physical examination; laboratory assays for hema-
tology, metabolic panel, and liver function tests; and an elec-
trocardiogramduringeachtreatmentperiod.Alladverseevents
were graded using the division of acquired immunodefi-
ciency syndrome (DAIDS) table of adverse events.9
Laboratory Studies
The University of Washington Western blot was used to assess
HSV-2 antibody status.10 Samples of genital secretions were
tested for HSV DNA with a real-time, quantitative polymerase
chain reaction TaqMan assay at the University of Washington
Virology Laboratory.11 Swabs were considered positive for HSV
when at least 150 (2.2 log10) HSV DNA copies per mL were
detected.12Tomonitorpotentialsignalsofdrug-resistance,HSV
detected during administration of pritelivir at more than 5000
copies of DNA per mL were sequenced in the resistance-
associated regions within UL5 and UL52 of HSV-2.13,14
Key Points
Question Is pritelivir more effective than valacyclovir for
suppression of genital herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) shedding
in patients with frequent recurrences?
Findings In this double-blind, randomized crossover study of 91
adults with recurrent genital herpes, the percentage of genital
swabs with HSV detected over 28 days was significantly lower
during use of pritelivir than use of valacyclovir (2.4% vs 5.3%).
Meaning Pritelivir may be more effective for suppression
of genital HSV-2 infection than valacyclovir, but further research
is needed to assess longer-term efficacy and safety.

Sample Size
The sample size estimate for the primary efficacy end point
was based on the anticipated occurrence of genital shedding,
defined as the number of swabs that tested positive for HSV
for study participants relative to the total numbers of swabs
collected from each participant. We estimated HSV shedding
at 5% during valacyclovir administration and 1% to 2% dur-
ing pritelivir therapy.3 Using a crossover design with 80%
power, 5% type 1 error, and a discontinuation rate of 6%, we
planned to screen 120 volunteers and randomize 90. How-
ever, after trial initiation, the decision was made to increase
enrollment to 98 because of concern for the possibility that a
greater number of participants would drop out given the bur-
den of the study procedures.
Outcomes
The primary end point was the intent-to-treat comparison of
within-participant HSV shedding, defined as the number of
swabs that tested positive for HSV per study participant rela-
tivetothetotalnumberofswabscollectedperparticipant,dur-
ing pritelivir vs valacyclovir therapy. Secondary end points in-
cluded a comparison of copy number of the HSV DNA on the
days that HSV was detected, HSV shedding on days with and
without lesions, frequency of lesions, and frequency of epi-
sodes. An episode was defined as an event in which consecu-
tive swabs tested positive for HSV DNA and were preceded and
followed by swabs that tested negative. Additional second-
ary analyses evaluated the duration of pain, shedding epi-
sodes, and recurrences.
Statistical Analyses
The analysis was conducted using a nonlinear mixed-effects
model with a log link with a random intercept for each par-
ticipant to account for extra-Poisson variability.15 Period and
carryover effects were examined at a 10% significance level
using, respectively, a term for time period and an interaction
term between the treatment group and time period. Analyses
of duration used Wilcoxon signed rank test.
The intent-to-treat analyses included all randomized par-
ticipants who received at least 1 dose of the study drug and ob-
tained at least 1 genital swab; per-protocol analyses excluded
persons with major protocol deviations, including early dis-
continuation of the study or study medication. The first day
of treatment was excluded from efficacy analyses.
Safety analyses included all randomized participants who
received at least 1 dose of the study drug. Missing data were
not imputed. Statistical significance was defined as a 2-sided
P value of <.05. Analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 sta-
tistical software (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Study Population
The study was conducted at 4 clinical research centers lo-
cated in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Indianapolis,
Indiana; and Houston, Texas, between October 2012 and
July 2013. Of 150 screened participants, 91 were randomized
(45toreceivepritelivirfirst)andtookatleast1doseofthestudy
drug (Figure 1). The most common cause of ineligibility was
lack of HSV-2 antibody (n = 11). Seventy-five participants re-
ceived pritelivir and 76 received valacyclovir. On May 9, 2013,
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) imposed a clini-
cal hold (an order to the sponsor to suspend ongoing investi-
gation), based on hematologic and dermatologic findings such
as dry skin, crusty skin lesions, and alopecia in a chronic tox-
icity study involving monkeys. Because the duration of the
clinical hold was uncertain, the sponsor terminated the study
on June 24, 2013. At the time of the study termination, 74 par-
ticipants completed their first treatment period and 56 com-
pleted both treatment periods.
Themedianageofparticipantswas48years;57(63%)were
women; and 66 (72%) were white (Table 1). The median time
from HSV-2 acquisition was 17 years and the median number
of recurrences in the year prior was 5 (range, 4-9 years). The
demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in par-
ticipants initially randomized to pritelivir and those initially
randomized to valacyclovir. Overall, 7276 swabs were col-
lected during pritelivir and 7453 swabs were collected during
valacyclovirtreatment(Table2).Inbothgroups,morethat96%
of participants collected at least 80% of the expected genital
swabs. Adherence to the study drug was very high, as mea-
sured by returned study medication, with 93% of persons re-
porting having taken at least 95% of prescribed doses.
HSV Genital Shedding
Herpes simplex virus was detected in 173 of 7276 swabs
(2.4%) obtained during pritelivir treatment and 392 of 7453
swabs (5.3%) obtained during valacyclovir treatment. The
frequency of detection of HSV in genital swabs was lower
during pritelivir treatment than during valacyclovir treat-
ment (relative risk [RR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82; P = .012;
Table 2 and Figure 2A). The HSV copy number on the days
that HSV was detected did not differ by group: for a mean
3.2 log10 copies/mL during pritelivir treatment vs a mean
3.7 log10 copies/mL during valacyclovir treatment (P = .83;
Figure 2B). The frequency of subclinical shedding was sig-
nificantly lower during pritelivir treatment than during
valacyclovir treatment, 1.8% vs 4.1% (RR, 0.40; 95% CI,
0.20-0.81; P = .01; Figure 2C). The rate of shedding when
patients reported genital lesions was not significantly differ-
ent during pritelivir and valacyclovir treatment, 29.9% vs
37.1% (P = .76).
The frequency of shedding episodes was not found to dif-
ferbytreatment,with1.3perperson-monthswhiletakingprite-
livir and 1.6 per person-months while taking valacyclovir (RR,
0.80; 95% CI, 0.52-1.22; P = .29). The proportion of episodes
lasting less than 24 hours was higher during receipt of prite-
livir vs valacyclovir (87% vs 69%, P = .005; eFigure 1 in
Supplement 3).
Subgroup analyses by sex, age, and duration of genital
herpes showed potentially stronger reductions in shedding
and lesions for women and for those younger than 50 years.
However, this study was not designed to compare efficacy
between groups; and group differences were not tested sta-
tistically. Per-protocol analyses conducted on 51 persons

who completed study medication without protocol devia-
tions also showed similar results (eTable 1 in Supplement 3),
except HSV quantity was significantly lower during treat-
ment with pritelivir (pritelivir, log10 2.9 vs valacyclovir,
log10 3.7, P < .001) and median duration of recurrences was
not significantly lower during pritelivir treatment (3.0 days
vs 6.0 days, P = .050). A sensitivity analysis that excluded
the initial week of each group was also consistent (eTable 2
in Supplement 3).
Genital Lesions and Pain
The overall frequency of genital lesions was low, with
participants reporting lesions on only 2.9% of days. How-
ever, genital lesions were reported on 1.9% of days during
pritelivir treatment compared with 3.9% of days during
valacyclovir administration (RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.17-0.96;
P = .04; Figure 3).
Twenty participants experienced at least 1 recurrence dur-
ing the study. The median duration of recurrences did not dif-
fer by treatment group. The proportion of days with pain was
4.0% while taking pritelivir and 6.7% while taking valacyclo-
vir (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.93; P = .03).
No period or carryover effects were found for genital shed-
ding or lesion occurrence.
Fifty-five swabs collected during pritelivir administra-
tion contained HSV DNA of more than 5000 copies/mL.
Fifty-four were sequenced for UL5 and 55 were sequenced
for UL52. No change from the reference sequence (HSV-2

a Shedding is defined as the number of HSV-positive swabs per study
participant relative to the total number of swabs collected per participant.
Subclinical shedding includes only swabs on days without genital lesions and
lesional shedding includes only swabs on days when genital lesions were
present. Three randomized participants are not included in the intent-to-treat
efficacy analyses because they either contributed no swabs or received no
study medication.
bThis result is due to 1 person who started in the pritelivir group during a lesion,
a protocol violation. When the person with the lesion at the start was
removed, the effect was reversed −0.4 (−0.6 to −0.2; P < .001).
Model-predicted differences (ratios) do not always match raw differences
(ratios) due to weighting in correlated regression.

although white blood cell counts were was unchanged at
every visit, there were statistically significant but not clini-
cally relevant changes in the mean lymphocyte count (110-
230 100 × 3/μL lower) and creatinine levels (0.03 and 0.05
mg/dL higher [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 76.25])
during pritelivir administration (eFigure 2 in Supplement 3).
At the week-4 visit following cessation of therapy, only the
creatinine levels remained 0.02 mg/dL higher in pritelivir
than in the valacyclovir group.
One participant was randomized in error and discontin-
ued from the study due to a prolonged QT interval that was
noted prior to initiating therapy with pritelivir. One partici-
pant receiving pritelivir developed urticaria without angio-
edema and was discontinued on day 10, and one participant
receiving valacyclovir discontinued treatment on day 7
because of a constellation of mild symptoms that included
headache, insomnia, and anxiety; these treatment-emergent
adverse events were considered probably or possibly related
to the trial medication. The percentage of participants with
skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were similar during
pritelivir (10.4%) and valacyclovir (9.0%) treatment.
Discussion
Among adults with frequent recurrences of genital HSV-2,
the use of pritelivir compared with valacyclovir resulted in a
lower percentage of swabs with HSV detected over 28 days.

Pritelivir decreased the number of days of overall genital
shedding, subclinical shedding, and genital lesions over the
total number of positive swabs and days with lesions,
respectively, compared with valacyclovir in intent-to-treat
analysis. The frequency of pain was also reduced. In addi-
tion, in per-protocol analysis, quantity of virus shed was
also decreased significantly during pritelivir treatment com-
pared with valacyclovir treatment. No sequence variation in
the UL5 and UL52 regions associated with resistance to
pritelivir in vitro was detected in genital swabs obtained
during pritelivir therapy.
Acrossoverdesignofthetrialallowedparticipantstobetheir
own controls. This design is more efficient relative to a parallel
group study of the same size because in patients with estab-
lished genital HSV-2 infection, shedding and recurrence rates
have been shown to be stable over months and shedding rates
are highly variable between persons; thus, studying within-
person changes allows for a more precise estimate of treatment
efficacy. In addition, each study participant in a crossover trial
is treated with both drugs. A potential drawback to this design
occurs if either there are temporal trends that affect shedding
rates over time, if the effect of the first drug remains after the
seconddrugisinitiated,oriftherearehighdropoutrates,which
wouldmakewithin-participantcomparisonsunfeasible.Thepla-
cebo-controlled trial of pritelivir7 suggested that a month-long
washoutperiodissufficientbecausesheddingratesreturnedto
baseline within 2 weeks of drug cessation.
Currentlyavailablenucleosideanaloguesimprovetheclini-
cal outcomes in genital herpes and improve the quality of life
of those who choose suppressive therapy.16,17 However, break-
through viral shedding and recurrences still occur, as well as
sexual and perinatal transmission. Furthermore, nucleoside
analogues only partly mitigate the more severe HSV syn-
dromes such as neonatal HSV or HSV encephalitis, and the op-
tions for immunocompromised patients who develop resis-
tance to acyclovir are severely limited.18 In addition, the
availabilityofnucleosideanalogueshasnotaffectedthepreva-
lence of HSV-2, likely because most patients are not diag-
nosed or not treated and because the drugs are insufficiently
potent to completely abrogate viral shedding and transmis-
sion. Whether a more potent regimen would have the poten-
tial to reduce HSV-2 infection on the population level re-
quires further study, akin to the work currently conducted on
HIV incidence by lowering the community viral load.19
The comparison between pritelivir to valacyclovir early in
the drug development process aimed to understand the bal-
ance between efficacy and safety. Few prescription medica-
tions have a safety profile comparable with the nucleoside ana-
logues for HSV. This safety is likely driven by the requirement
for virally mediated phosphorylation by thymidine kinase, and
thus the drug is activated only in cells that are already infected.
However,thismayalsolimittheefficacyofthedrugbecausevi-
ral replication must already be ongoing in order for the drug to
be effective. In contrast, pritelivir is also very specific for HSV
butdoesnotrequireactivationorongoingviralreplication.The
drugsalsohaveadifferenceintheirhalf-lives,withacyclovirhav-
ing a half-life of 3 hours and pritelivir of 50 to 80 hours.20 Dose-
ranging studies have consistently shown that frequent dosing
of acyclovir and valacyclovir is more effective for clinical HSV
disease, and continuous infusion of acyclovir can even over-
come in vitro resistance.21,22 Thus treatment with a drug that
maintainsasteadylevelthroughoutthedosingintervalmayre-
sult in fewer opportunities for HSV to reactivate.23
The trial was placed on clinical hold by the FDA and ter-
minated by the sponsor based on findings in monkeys in a
39-week toxicity study. These findings included skin related
findings such as dry skin, crusty skin lesions, and alopecia as
well as anemia (decreases in hemoglobin and in most animals
an increase in the percentage of reticulocytes). So far the
mechanism of dermatologic and hematologic findings is not
understood. However, in the present study participants did
not experience any similar adverse events (eg, anemia),
although one person developed a rash (hives). The changes
observed in lymphocyte count and creatinine levels were
small, and longer duration of therapy will be needed to assess
their clinical significance.
This study was limited by early termination and there-
fore, fewer participants than planned were treated. However,
because of greater viral suppression during pritelivir therapy
than assumed in power calculations and because few partici-
pants were lost to follow-up, a statistically significant differ-
ence in viral shedding and genital lesions was seen during the
treatment with the 2 regimens. The persons enrolled had
agreed to obtain very frequent genital samples and thus may
differ from the general population. However, these differ-
ences should not affect the biological activity of the drugs.
Conclusions
Among adults with frequently recurring genital HSV-2, the use
ofpritelivircomparedwithvalacyclovirresultedinalowerper-
centage of swabs with HSV detection over 28 days. Further re-
search is needed to assess longer-term efficacy and safety.
