Background: Women screened with digital mammography
may receive false-positive and false-negative results and subse-
quent imaging and biopsies. How these outcomes vary by age,
time since the last screening, and individual risk factors is
unclear.
Objective: To determine factors associated with false-positive
and false-negative digital mammography results, additional im-
aging, and biopsies among a general population of women
screened for breast cancer.
Design: Analysis of registry data.
Setting: Participating facilities at 5 U.S. Breast Cancer Surveil-
lance Consortium breast imaging registries with linkages to pa-
thology databases and tumor registries.
Patients: 405 191 women aged 40 to 89 years screened with
digital mammography between 2003 and 2011. A total of 2963
were diagnosed with invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ
within 12 months of screening.
Measurements: Rates of false-positive and false-negative re-
sults and recommendations for additional imaging and biopsies
from a single screening round; comparisons by age, time since
the last screening, and risk factors.
Results: Rates of false-positive results (121.2 per 1000 women
[95% CI, 105.6 to 138.7]) and recommendations for additional
imaging (124.9 per 1000 women [CI, 109.3 to 142.3]) were high-
est among women aged 40 to 49 years and decreased with in-
creasing age. Rates of false-negative results (1.0 to 1.5 per 1000
women) and recommendations for biopsy (15.6 to 17.5 per 1000
women) did not differ greatly by age. Results did not differ by
time since the last screening. False-positive rates were higher for
women with risk factors, particularly family history of breast can-
cer; previous benign breast biopsy result; high breast density;
and, for younger women, low body mass index.
Limitations: Confounding by variation in patient-level charac-
teristics and outcomes across registries and regions may have
been present. Some factors, such as numbers of first- and
second-degree relatives with breast cancer and diagnoses asso-
ciated with previous benign biopsy results, were not examined.
Conclusion: False-positive mammography results and addi-
tional imaging are common, particularly for younger women and
those with risk factors, whereas biopsies occur less often. Rates
of false-negative results are low.

C
linical guidelines recommend a personalized ap-
proach to mammography screening that considers
potential benefits and harms (1). Important harms in-
clude adverse effects of the screening process, such as
false-positive and false-negative results and subse-
quent imaging and biopsies. Although procedures are
often necessary to evaluate findings on screening
mammography, most result in benign diagnoses. Mini-
mizing these adverse effects could improve the balance
of benefits and harms of screening for many women.
A personalized approach to screening includes
identifying individual risk factors for breast cancer. Sev-
eral risk factors have been associated with breast can-
cer in epidemiologic studies, but most relationships are
modest or inconsistent (2). Factors associated with high
risk for the disease include specific mutations of breast
cancer susceptibility genes (3) and other hereditary ge-
netic syndromes (4); previously diagnosed breast can-
cer or high-risk breast lesions (5, 6); previous high-dose
radiation therapy to the chest (4, 7); and a family history
of breast cancer, particularly among first-degree rela-
tives. The degree of risk from family history varies ac-
cording to familial patterns of disease. Estimates of life-
time risk greater than 20% are considered high (8),
although lower levels are also clinically important (9).
Additional factors that modestly increase risk in-
clude older age; current use of menopausal hormone
therapy with combined estrogen and progestin regi-
mens (10); current use of oral contraceptives (2); high
breast density (11); and, for postmenopausal women,
high body mass index (BMI) (12). How these factors in-
fluence performance outcomes of digital mammogra-
phy screening has not been extensively explored.
The purpose of this study was to estimate rates of
false-positive and false-negative digital mammography
results and subsequent imaging and biopsies among a
general population of women undergoing screening,
as well as how rates vary by age, time since the last

 mammography screening, and individual risk factors.
This analysis will be used to inform updated clinical
practice recommendations in the United States (13).
METHODS
Design Overview
This study was an analysis of data collected be-
tween 2003 and 2011 from the Breast Cancer Surveil-
lance Consortium (BCSC), a collaborative network of
mammography registries across the United States that
is supported by the National Cancer Institute (14, 15).
Registries collected data at the time of mammography
at participating community radiology facilities. Breast
cancer diagnoses were obtained by linking BCSC data
to pathology databases, regional SEER (Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results) programs, and state
tumor registries. Data were pooled at a statistical coor-
dinating center. Registries and the coordinating center
received institutional review board approval for active
or passive consenting processes or a waiver of consent
to enroll participants, link data, and perform analysis.
All procedures were compliant with the Health Insur-
ance Portability and Accountability Act, and registries
and the coordinating center received a federal Certifi-
cate of Confidentiality and other protections for the
identities of women, physicians, and facilities.
Setting and Participants
The analysis included data for 405 191 women
aged 40 to 89 years who had routine screening with
digital mammography between 2003 and 2011 at par-
ticipating facilities in 5 BCSC breast imaging registries
(Carolina
Mammography
Registry,
Group
Health
[Washington State], New Hampshire Mammography
Network, San Francisco Mammography Registry, and
Vermont Breast Cancer Surveillance System) (Figure).
Before each mammography screening, women com-
pleted questionnaires about demographic and medical
history information, including time since their last mam-
mography screening. All women with an eligible
screening mammogram who completed a question-
naire providing permission to use their information for
research were included.
Mammograms were included if they were desig-
nated by the radiologist or radiology technologist as
performed for screening purposes and if they were
done more than 9 months after a previous imaging ex-
amination in women with no history of breast cancer,
breast augmentation, or mastectomy. Each study-
eligible mammogram required at least 1 examination
within the previous 30 months. Initial and unilateral ex-
aminations were excluded. Mammography information
included Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System
(BI-RADS) breast density, assessment, and recommen-
dations for further work-up. For women with more than
1 mammography screening during the study period, 1
observation was randomly selected to be included in
the calculations to reduce potential bias, such as from
preferentially choosing women with shorter or longer
screening histories. These data comprise a defined
subset of BCSC data intended to represent the experi-
ence of a cohort of regularly screened women with no
history of breast cancer or current breast symptoms.
Outcome and Risk Factor Measures
Outcome measures included rates of false-positive
and false-negative mammography results and recom-
mendations for additional imaging and biopsies from a
single
screening
round.
False-positive
and
false-
negative
mammography
results
were
based
on
follow-up data within 1 year of screening and before
the next screening examination. Positive versus nega-
tive initial and final results were defined using BCSC
standard definitions (16), which used standardized ter-
minology and assessments from the fourth edition of
the American College of Radiology BI-RADS Atlas (17).
Each mammography screening was given an initial BI-
RADS assessment based on the screening views only.
Positive initial results included 4 assessment catego-
ries: needs additional imaging evaluation (category 0),
probably benign (category 3) with a recommendation
for immediate work-up (treated as category 0 because
of the recommendation), suspicious abnormality (cate-
gory 4), or highly suggestive of malignancy (category 5)
(18). Negative results included assessments of negative
(category 1) or benign (category 2) findings or category
3 without a recommendation for immediate work-up.
Recommendation for biopsy was defined as a pos-
itive final result after all imaging, including work-up for
an abnormal screening result. Positive final results in-
cluded BI-RADS assessments of category 4 or 5 or cat-
egory 0 with a recommendation for biopsy (18). Nega-
tive final results included an assessment of category 1,
EDITORS' NOTES
Context
Screening mammography can produce false-positive or
false-negative results.
Contribution
This analysis of registry data describes rates of false-
positive and false-negative results among women aged
40 to 89 years screened with digital mammography.
False-positives and recommendations for additional im-
aging were highest among women aged 40 to 49 years.
Rates of false-negative results were generally low. Posi-
tive family history, previous biopsy, high breast density,
and low body mass index for younger women were as-
sociated with higher risk for a false-positive result.
Caution
Variation in patient characteristics and screening proto-
cols across registries could have confounded estimates.
Implication
False-positive results and additional imaging are com-
mon, particularly for younger women and those with risk
factors.

 2, or 3 or category 0 with a recommendation for normal
or short-interval follow-up or clinical examination.
We examined associations with common risk fac-
tors for breast cancer (2). These included first-degree
relatives with breast cancer (none or ≥1), breast density
(almost entirely fat, scattered fibroglandular densities,
heterogeneously dense, or extremely dense), benign
breast biopsy result (none or previous), race/ethnicity
(white, black, Asian, Hispanic, or other), menopausal
status (premenopausal, perimenopausal, or postmeno-
pausal), menopausal hormone therapy use (none, com-
bination [estrogen with progestin], or estrogen only),
oral contraceptive use (no current use or current use),
and BMI (<25, 25 to <30, or ≥30 kg/m2). Because the
BCSC data do not include information on types of
menopausal hormone therapy, we assumed that a
woman with a uterus uses combination therapy and a
woman without a uterus uses estrogen-only therapy, as
previously described (19, 20).
The primary analysis involved 3 categories of
breast density, with almost entirely fat and scattered
fibroglandular densities combined into 1 group. In a
sensitivity analysis, we analyzed density in 3 additional
ways: 3 categories, with heterogeneously dense and
extremely dense combined into 1 group; 4 separate
BI-RADS categories; and 2 categories, with almost en-
tirely fat and scattered fibroglandular densities in one
group and heterogeneously dense and extremely
dense in the other.
Two measures of time since the last mammography
screening were evaluated to represent broad and nar-
row estimates of 1 versus 2 years (9 to 18 vs. 19 to 30
months and 11 to 14 vs. 23 to 26 months).
Missing data for outcomes and risk factors are sum-
marized in Appendix Table 1 (available at www.annals
.org).
Statistical Analysis
We calculated age-specific rates (per 1000 women
per single screening round) by decade for false-
positive and false-negative mammography results, rec-
ommendations for additional imaging, and recommen-
dations for biopsy and determined whether outcomes
differed by age, time since the last mammography
screening, and risk factors. To account for correlation
among mammograms interpreted at the same radiol-
ogy facility, we estimated robust SEs from logistic re-
gression using generalized estimating equations with
an independence working correlation matrix (21). We
then calculated 95% CIs and, to assess differences be-
tween groups, 2-sided P values. This method provides
population-averaged estimates of effects, which are not
necessarily causal relationships. Analyses were per-
formed using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute).
Role of the Funding Source
This research was funded by the Agency for Health-
care Research and Quality (AHRQ) under a contract to
support the work of the U.S. Preventive Services Task
Force. The AHRQ had no role in the analysis or the
development of conclusions. The AHRQ performed a
final review of the manuscript to ensure that the analy-
sis met methodological standards. The investigators
are solely responsible for the content and the decision
to submit the manuscript for publication.
RESULTS
Outcomes by Age
Data based on results from a single screening
round for women regularly receiving digital mammog-
raphy indicated that false-positive results were com-
mon in all age groups (Table 1). The rate was highest
among women aged 40 to 49 years (121.2 per 1000
women [95% CI, 105.6 to 138.7]) and decreased across
age groups (P < 0.001). Rates of false-negative mam-
mography results tended to increase with age, ranging
from 1.0 to 1.5 per 1000 women, but did not statisti-
cally significantly differ across age groups.
For women with initially positive mammography re-
sults, rates of recommendations for additional imaging
were highest among those aged 40 to 49 years (124.9
per 1000 women [CI, 109.3 to 142.3]) and decreased
with increasing age (P < 0.001). Rates of recommenda-
tions for biopsy did not statistically significantly differ
across age groups and ranged from 15.6 to 17.5 per
1000 women.

 Rates of invasive breast cancer were lowest among
women aged 40 to 49 years (2.2 per 1000 women [CI,
1.8 to 2.6]) and increased across age groups (P <
0.001). Rates of ductal carcinoma in situ also were low-
est among women aged 40 to 49 years (1.6 per 1000
women [CI, 1.3 to 1.9]) and increased with age (P =
0.055). Women aged 70 to 79 years had the highest
rates of invasive cancer (7.2 per 1000 women [CI, 6.4 to
8.1]) and ductal carcinoma in situ (2.3 per 1000 women
[CI, 1.7 to 3.0]). Consequently, the yield of screening
was more favorable for older women. For every case of
invasive breast cancer detected by mammography
screening in women aged 40 to 49 years, 464 women
had mammography, 58 were recommended for addi-
tional imaging, and 10 were recommended for biopsy.
In contrast, for women aged 70 to 79 years, for every
case of invasive breast cancer detected by screening,
139 women had mammography, 11 were recom-
mended for additional imaging, and 3 were recom-
mended for biopsy.
Outcomes by Time Since the Last Mammography
Screening
Rates of false-positive results, false-negative re-
sults, and recommendations for additional imaging did
not differ in comparisons of time since the last mam-
mography screening, regardless of the interval (9 to 18
vs. 19 to 30 months and 11 to 14 vs. 23 to 26 months)
(Appendix Table 2, available at www.annals.org). Biop-
sies were recommended at a higher rate only for
women aged 60 to 69 years who had their last mam-
mogram 23 to 26 months previously compared with 11
to 14 months previously (18.8 vs. 15.2 per 1000
women; P = 0.026).
Outcomes by Risk Factors
False-Positive Mammography Results
Rates of false-positive mammography results were
statistically significantly higher for women with specific
risk factors than for those without them (Table 2). These
include having a first-degree relative with breast cancer
for women aged 40 to 69 years. Women with hetero-
geneously dense breasts had higher false-positive rates
than those with almost entirely fat and scattered fi-
broglandular densities or extremely dense breasts in all
age groups except 80 to 89 years. Rates were also
higher among women with previous benign breast bi-
opsy results in the 40-to-79–year age group. Compari-
sons based on race and ethnicity indicated the lowest
rates among Asian women in all age groups.
Premenopausal women had higher false-positive
rates than those who were perimenopausal or post-
menopausal in the 40-to-59–year age group. Among
women using menopausal hormone therapy, those
aged 70 to 79 years had the highest rates; comparisons
for the other age groups were not statistically signifi-
cant. Women with lower BMI (<30 kg/m2) had higher
false-positive rates in the 40-to-59–year age group.
False-Negative Mammography Results
Rates of false-negative results were higher for
women aged 40 to 79 years with first-degree relatives
with breast cancer, although results were of borderline
statistical significance for those aged 50 to 69 years
(Appendix
Table
3,
available
at
www.annals.org).
Women with almost entirely fat and scattered fibroglan-
dular densities had lower rates than those with other
types of breast density in the 40-to-69–year age group.
Rates were higher among women with previous benign
breast biopsy results in the 50-to-89–year age group
and women with lower BMI (<30 kg/m2) in the 50-to-
59–year
age
group.
Other
comparisons
between
groups were not statistically significant.
Recommendations for Additional Imaging
Risk factors associated with differences in rates of
recommendations for additional imaging were similar
to those for false-positive mammography results (Ap-
pendix Table 4, available at www.annals.org). Rates
were highest among women with first-degree relatives

 with breast cancer in all age groups, those with heter-
ogeneously dense breasts in the 40-to-79–year age
group, those with previous benign breast biopsy re-
sults in the 40-to-79–year age group, those who were
premenopausal in the 40-to-49–year age group, those
who were using menopausal hormone therapy in the
70-to-79–year age group, and those with lower BMI in
the 40-to-49–year age group. Comparisons based on
race and ethnicity indicated the lowest rates among
Asian women in all age groups.
Recommendations for Biopsy
Rates of recommendations for biopsy were statisti-
cally significantly higher for women aged 40 to 69 years
with first-degree relatives with breast cancer and for
those aged 40 to 79 years with previous benign breast
biopsy results (Table 3). Women aged 40 to 59 years
with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts had
higher rates than those with less dense breasts; for
women aged 60 to 79 years, rates were highest among
those with heterogeneously dense breasts. Higher
rates were also associated with premenopausal status
for women aged 50 to 59 years, no current use of oral
contraceptives for those aged 40 to 49 years, and lower
BMI for those aged 40 to 49 years but higher BMI for
those aged 70 to 79 years. Other comparisons between
groups were not statistically significant.
Breast Density Categories
Rates of false-positive results, false-negative re-
sults, recommendations for additional imaging, and
recommendations for biopsy were lowest for women
with almost entirely fat breasts in all age groups. False-
negative rates were highest for women with extremely
dense breasts in all age groups except 60 to 69 years
(Appendix Table 5, available at www.annals.org). Rates
of false-positive results, recommendations for addi-
tional imaging, and recommendations for biopsy were
highest for women with heterogeneously dense breasts
or those in the combined category of heterogeneously
and extremely dense breasts in all age groups except
40 to 49 years, where rates of recommendations for
biopsy were highest for women with extremely dense
breasts.
DISCUSSION
Our analysis of BCSC data on digital mammogra-
phy screening indicated that rates of false-positive re-
sults and recommendations for additional imaging

 were highest among women aged 40 to 49 years and
decreased with increasing age, whereas rates of false-
negative results were low across all age groups. Rates
of recommendations for biopsy did not differ across
age groups. Results did not differ by time since the last
mammography screening regardless of whether broad
or narrow estimates of 1 versus 2 years were used.
Several risk factors (family history of breast cancer,
high breast density, and previous benign breast biopsy
result) were statistically significantly associated with
higher rates of false-positive and false-negative results
and recommendations for additional imaging and bi-
opsy across most age groups. Premenopausal status,
use of menopausal hormone therapy, and lower BMI
were associated with some outcomes for specific age
groups only. Comparisons based on race and ethnicity
indicated the lowest rates of false-positive results and
additional imaging among Asian women. Although
some risk factors (such as premenopausal status and
use of menopausal hormone therapy) reflect higher ex-
posure to estrogen and related changes in breast tis-
sue, others (such as family history and previous benign
biopsy result) may serve primarily as markers of in-
creased breast cancer risk.
Our analysis comparing different combinations of
breast density categories indicated that rates for all out-
comes were lowest for women with almost entirely fat
breasts and highest for those with heterogeneously
dense breasts or those in the combined category of
heterogeneous and extreme density. Women with ex-
tremely dense breasts had the highest rates of false-
negative results. This is probably related to this group's
particularly complex mammography images, which are
more difficult to interpret and thus limit discrimination
between breast cancer and normal tissue and lead to
more callbacks and biopsies and higher false-negative
rates in clinical practice (22–24).
This analysis indicated higher rates of false-positive
results and recommendations for additional imaging
and lower rates of recommendations for biopsy than
our previous analysis of BCSC data, which included
600 830 women screened between 2000 and 2005 us-
ing predominantly film mammography (25). The lower
rates of recommendations for biopsy may be due to
more selective use of procedures by radiologists be-
cause of improvements in image quality and interpre-
tation for digital mammography and ultrasonography
over time.
Our finding that results did not differ by time since
the last mammography screening differs from previous
analyses by the BCSC that indicated higher rates for
annual versus biennial screening (19, 26–30). However,
our rates were based on digital mammography only
and on a single round of screening that did not capture
the longitudinal screening experiences of individual
women, which more accurately reflect clinical practice.

 A previous analysis of BCSC data that provided results
of screening over a 10-year period indicated that when
screening began at age 40 years, cumulative rates of
false-positive mammography and benign biopsy results
were higher for annual than biennial screening (mam-
mography, 61% vs. 42%; biopsy, 7% vs. 5%) (29).
The results of our analysis of associations with risk
factors are generally consistent with previous BCSC
analyses indicating that 10-year cumulative risks for
false-positive results and benign biopsy results were
higher for women with heterogeneously or extremely
dense breasts, those with a family history of breast can-
cer, and those who used combination menopausal hor-
mone therapy (29, 31). Although our analysis identified
associations with additional risk factors, it differed from
the study of 10-year cumulative risks because it was
based on a single round of screening, did not adjust
for
other
covariates,
and
included
only
digital
mammography.
Strengths of this study include its use of digital
mammography data and patient information from a
large
national
collaborative
database
of
women
screened in the United States, which provided a com-
prehensive data source representing current clinical
practice. This study used the methods of the BCSC,
which have been standardized across the participating
registries, allowing our analysis to build on prior work
in this area (22, 23, 32).
To estimate screening outcomes applicable to clin-
ical practice in the United States, data sources must
include information from U.S. practices because rates
of false-positive and false-negative results and addi-
tional imaging and biopsies differ substantially else-
where (33–35). These differences relate to the variabil-
ity in how mammography screening and diagnostic
services are delivered and practiced.
This study has several limitations. The BCSC data
reflect opportunistic screening in a fluctuating popula-
tion of women in the United States whose information
was collected by the participating registries. Findings
may not be applicable to other populations. Other lim-
itations include the use of registry data based on pre-
defined elements and the inherent biases of observa-
tional data. Some outcomes, such as the effectiveness
and harms of different screening intervals, would be
more accurately determined by comparing outcomes
between women who were randomly assigned to com-
parison groups. However, this question has not been
resolved by randomized trials of screening that used
intervals ranging from 12 to 33 months (13).
Our goal was to provide overall rates of the out-
come measures by time since the last mammography

 screening and risk factors. Thus, our estimates were de-
rived from population-averaged models, which pro-
vided variance estimates adjusted for correlation within
facilities
but
did
not
decompose
within-
versus
between-facility effects or adjust for potential con-
founders. For example, compared with women without
risk factors, those with risk factors may tend to seek
care at facilities with different performance characteris-
tics (for example, academic medical centers); present
for screening more often; or have other characteristics
that explain the higher rates of screening harms, such
as more complex breast tissue or increased risk for be-
nign breast disease. Understanding the mechanisms
through which risk factors affect performance or varia-
tion across facilities and radiologists is beyond the
scope of this study.
Our estimates are based on digital mammography
performed
without
supplemental
imaging.
Digital
breast tomosynthesis (36–41) and supplemental tests,
such as screening ultrasonography (42), are becoming
more widely used in the United States. A similar analy-
sis of screening outcomes of these newer technologies
using a large generalizable cohort, such as the BCSC, is
needed.
In conclusion, our analysis of outcomes from a sin-
gle
round
of
digital
mammography
screening
in
405 191 women indicated that false-positive results
and additional imaging are common, particularly for
younger women and those with risk factors, whereas
biopsies occur less often. Rates of false-negative results
are low. The results of this study may be useful for
women and clinicians considering the individual bene-
fits and harms of screening as well as for health service
administrators and planners determining the implica-
tions of screening for populations.
