 Disparities in Environmental
Exposures to Endocrine-
Disrupting Chemicals and Diabetes
Risk in Vulnerable Populations
Diabetes Care 2018;41:193–205 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc16-2765
Burgeoning epidemiological, animal, and cellular data link environmental endocrine-
disrupting chemicals (EDCs) to metabolic dysfunction. Disproportionate exposure to
diabetes-associated EDCs may be an underappreciated contributor to disparities in
metabolic disease risk. The burden of diabetes is not uniformly borne by American
society; rather, this disease disproportionately affects certain populations, including
African Americans, Latinos, and low-income individuals. The purpose of this study
was to review the evidence linking unequalexposuresto EDCs with racial,ethnic, and
socioeconomic diabetes disparities in the U.S.; discuss social forces promoting these
disparities; andexplore potential interventions. Articlesexamining the links between
chemical exposures and metabolic disease were extracted from the U.S. National
Library of Medicine for the period of 1966 to 3 December 2016. EDCs associated with
diabetes in the literature were then searched for evidence of racial, ethnic, and
socioeconomic exposure disparities. Among Latinos, African Americans, and low-
income individuals, numerous studies have reported significantly higher exposures
to diabetogenic EDCs, including polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesti-
cides, multiple chemical constituents of air pollution, bisphenol A, and phthalates.
This review reveals that unequal exposure to EDCs may be a novel contributor to
diabetes disparities. Efforts to reduce the individual and societal burden of diabetes
should include educating clinicians on environmental exposures that may increase
disease risk, strategies to reduce those exposures, and social policies to address
environmental inequality as a novel source of diabetes disparities.
Diabetes is a complex and devastating metabolic disease that arises from impairments
in insulin production and/or action with consequential derangements in global energy
metabolism. In the U.S., diabetes is the leading cause of adult blindness, kidney failure,
and nontraumatic amputations; moreover, it is a central driver of cardiovascular dis-
ease, the leading cause of death among people with diabetes. Diabetes disproportion-
ately afflicts African Americans, Latinos, and low-income individuals. Compared with
non-Hispanic whites, the risk of developing diabetes is estimated to be 66% higher for
Hispanics and77%higherfor African Americans(1). Indeed, 17.9% ofAfrican Americans
and 20.5% of Mexican Americans have diabetes compared with only 9.1% of non-
Hispanic whites, and these disparities in diabetes prevalence have been amplified
over the past decade (2). Furthermore, age-adjusted diabetes mortality rates are
significantly higher among Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks than non-Hispanic whites
(3). Understanding the complete array of factors that contribute to racial and ethnic
differences in the pathogenesis of metabolic disease is critical for addressing the
disproportionate burden of diabetes in communities of color.

REVIEW
 Although physical inactivity and caloric
excess undoubtedly are risk factors,
emerging evidence implicates environ-
mental endocrine-disrupting chemicals
(EDCs) as contributors to the diabetes ep-
idemic. The Endocrine Society defines an
EDC as an exogenous chemical or mixture
of chemicals that interferes with any as-
pect of hormone action (4). Of note, the
dramatic rise in U.S. diabetes rates corre-
lates closely with synthetic chemical pro-
duction (5), and these associations are
now supported by epidemiological, ani-
mal, and cellular data that demonstrate
that EDCs can interfere with insulin secre-
tion and action as well as with other path-
ways that regulate glucose homeostasis.
Despite a history of environmental pollu-
tion disproportionately affecting commu-
nities of color in the U.S. (6), the potential
contribution of environmental toxicants
to racial and ethnic differences in diabe-
tes risk is underappreciated.
The issue of environmental injustice
first entered widespread consciousness in
1982 when residents of the predomi-
nantly African American community of
Warren County, North Carolina, made
national news by laying themselves across
a rural road to prevent encroaching trucks
from dumping dirt laden with polychlori-
nated biphenyls (PCBs) in their community
(6). This media attention prompted em-
pirical examination of the community’s
claim that toxic waste facilities were being
disproportionately sited in low-income
communities and communities of color.
This research has grown substantially
since the 1980s, with the majority of evi-
dence showing racial and socioeconomic
disparities in exposures to myriad environ-
mental hazards (6). In addition to higher
exposure to air pollution nationwide (7),
unequalexposuresamongpeopleofcolor
are also rooted in patterns of occupation,
housing conditions, and neighborhood in-
frastructure (8,9). This article reviews the
state of the evidence linking ethnic, racial,
and socioeconomic disparities in pollut-
ant exposure in the U.S. to EDCs linked
to diabetes.
UNEQUAL ENVIRONMENTAL
EXPOSURES AND DIABETES RISK
Scientific evidence linking EDCs with the
development of diabetes and other meta-
bolic disorders continues to grow. Of note,
exposures to several toxicants have been
prospectively linked to diabetes risk, includ-
ing PCBs, organochlorine (OC) pesticides,
various chemical constituents of air pol-
lution, bisphenol A (BPA), and phtha-
lates (Table 1); moreover, exposure to
these EDCs is higher among African Amer-
icans, Latinos, and low-income individuals
(Supplementary Table 1). These unequal
exposures raise the possibility that EDCs
are underappreciated contributors to di-
abetes disparities.
PCBs
Introduced in the U.S. in the 1930s for a
variety of industrial purposes, PCBs are
a class of synthetic compounds where
various combinations of hydrogen atoms
on the biphenyl (C12H10) structure are
substituted with chlorine, resulting in
209 congeners designated by a unique
number reflecting the extent and position
of their chlorination (e.g., PCB 153). Al-
though bannedbythe U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency in 1977, PCBs remain
detectable in human tissues as a result
of their environmental and biologi-
cal persistence (10). Higher PCB expo-
sures among African Americans have
been documented since the 1960s (11)
(Supplementary Table 1). Ongoing human
exposure to PCBs is due to the legacy of
contamination in food, including certain
fish (12); however, additional exposure
sources include leaching from contami-
nated industrial sites and indoor con-
struction materials (13,14). PCB waste is
found in Superfund and toxic waste sites
that are concentrated in neighborhoods
of color (6). Although catfish consump-
tion has been suggested as the main con-
tributor to increased PCB levels in African
Americans (15), the historical siting of
PCB production and disposal sites in pre-
dominantly black communities is likely a
significant additional contributor to in-
creased contamination of locally sourced
foods. Oneexampleofthisphenomenon is
Anniston, Alabama, a PCB manufacturing
city from 1929 to 1971. African Americans
not only lived closer to a former Monsanto
PCB manufacturing plant but also had
PCB levels three times higher than
whites living in Anniston (16). Consump-
tion of local fish and livestock were the
strongest predictors of higher serum PCB
levels among African Americans (17),
whereas consumption of local dairy prod-
ucts and dredging near another PCB-
contaminatedSuperfundsitealsopredicted
higher cord blood PCB levels in infants (18).
A large body of evidence, including pro-
spective epidemiological studies, supports
the hypothesis that PCBs are metabolic
disease risk factors. For example, residen-
tial proximity to PCB-contaminated waste
sites is associated with higher diabetes
hospitalization rates (19). Among female
residents of Anniston, serum PCB levels
were significantly associated with diabe-
tes (20), whereas in a separate study
with 25 years of follow-up, women with
higher PCB levels exhibited increased di-
abetes incidence (incidence density ratio
2.33 [95% CI 1.25–4.34]) (21). Similarly,
women exposed to PCB-laced rice bran
oil during the Yucheng poisoning event
in Taiwan also had an increased risk
of developing diabetes (odds ratio [OR]
2.1 [95% CI 1.1–4.5]), with markedly
higher risk among those who developed
chloracne, a cutaneous manifestation of
dioxin-like PCB exposure (OR 5.5 [95% CI
2.1–13.4]) (22). A meta-analysis that
pooled data from the Nurses’ Health
Study (NHS) with six prospective studies
showed that total PCBs were associated
with incident diabetes (OR 1.70 [95% CI
1.28–2.27]) (23). Further supporting
these prospective links between PCB ex-
posure and diabetes are data from cohort
studies, including the Prospective Investi-
gation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Se-
niors (PIVUS) (24) and a group followed
for nearly 20 years (25). Finally, although
not reaching statistical significance, a
study of Swedish women suggested that
higher levels of PCB 153 were similarly
associated with increased rates of type 2
diabetes diagnosed after .6 years of
follow-up (OR 1.6 [95% CI 0.61–4.0]) (26).
Collectively, these data suggest an associ-
ation between PCBs and diabetes risk, es-
pecially among women; however, some
discrepant findings exist in the literature.
In a study of Great Lakes sport fish con-
sumers, PCB 118 and total PCBs were not
associated with diabetes (27), and in a
Flemish study that adjusted for correlated
exposures, PCBs showed a negative asso-
ciation with self-reported diabetes (28).
Despite these discrepancies, a meta-
analysis of both cross-sectional and pro-
spective studies published before March
2014 showed that in aggregate, total
PCBs are associated with increased dia-
betes risk (relative risk [RR] 2.39 [95% CI
1.86–3.08]) (29).Taken within the context
of animal and cellular data demonstrat-
ing that PCBs alter metabolic function
(Supplementary Table 2), this evidence
collectively suggests that PCBs contribute
to diabetes risk and disparities.

 OC Pesticides
OC pesticides were extensively used in
the U.S. until the 1970s when most
were banned because of their environ-
mental persistence and toxicity to hu-
mans and wildlife; however, several OC
pesticides and their metabolites are still
measurable in the U.S. population. Levels
of these compounds are greater in Mex-
ican Americans and African Americans
compared with whites (Supplementary
Table 1). The prolonged use of OC pesti-
cides outside of the U.S. for agricultural
purposes or vector control is believed to
contribute to higher levels in Latino pop-
ulations(10,30,31). Indeed, onthe basisof
National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey data, people born outside
the U.S. are more likely to be exposed
to OC pesticides (32). However, the over-
representation of Mexican Americans in
U.S. agriculture may also play a role in
exposure disparities (33). In addition, di-
rect exposures to OC pesticides before
their phaseout may have been passed
down to offspring through breast milk
and cord blood (34), likely resulting in
higher body burdens at the start of life
that persist into adulthood.
In concordance with animal and cellu-
lar data demonstrating the capacity of
OC pesticides to disrupt multiple aspects
of cellular and systemic glucose regula-
tion (Supplementary Table 2), epidemio-
logical studies from various regions of the
world have associated OC pesticide expo-
sure with diabetes and the metabolic
syndrome (Table 1). For example, plasma
hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was positively
associated with incident type 2 diabetes,
an effect confirmed in an accompanying
meta-analysis (OR 2.00 [95% CI 1.13–
3.53]) (23). Among Great Lakes sport
fish consumers, levels of dichlorodiphe-
nyldichloroethylene (DDE), a metabolite
of dichlordiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT),
were associated with incident diabetes
(27), whereas a study in Swedish women
showed that being in the highest quartile
of DDE levels relative to the lowest quar-
tile was associated with incident diabetes
(OR 5.5 [95% CI 1.2–25]) (26). In a nested
case-control cohort of individuals fol-
lowed for nearly 20 years, the OC pesti-
cides trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane, and
mirex were nonlinearly associated with
new-onset diabetes (25). In the PIVUS
study, trans-nonachlor and a summary in-
dex of three OC pesticides also were pos-
itively associated with diabetes at age

 75 years (24). In a Flemish biomonitoring
program, OC pesticide levels measured in
2004–2005 were associated with self-
reported diabetes in 2011; this included
HCB as well as DDE in men (28). Finally, in
the Agricultural Health Study, a large pro-
spective cohort of pesticide applicators
and their spouses, the OC pesticide diel-
drin was associated with incident diabetes
(hazard ratio [HR] 1.99 [95% CI 1.12–3.54])
(35). By compiling data across studies, a
meta-analysis comparing the highest to
lowest exposure groups demonstrated a
strong positive correlation between OC
pesticide exposure and diabetes rates
(RR 2.30 [95% CI 1.81–2.93]) (29).
Traffic-Related Air Pollution and
Particulate Matter
Traffic-related air pollution comprises
various chemical components, including
nitric oxides (NOx), ozone, and particulate
matter (PM), which is a mixture of parti-
cles and liquids classified by their diam-
eter (e.g., ,10 mm [PM10] or ,2.5 mm
[PM2.5]). Nationwide studies have shown
that African Americans and Latinos are
exposed to significantly more PM2.5
(7,36), and ethnic and racial disparities
in exposure to traffic-related air pollution
exceed those between income groups
(37) (Supplementary Table 1). NO2 levels
correlate closely with PM2.5, ultrafine par-
ticles, and black carbon and thus serve
as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution
(38). Exposure to NO2 is 38% higher for
people of color than for non-Hispanic
whites and 10% higher for people below
the poverty line (37). Among nonwhite
individuals living in poverty, children
age ,5 years are exposed to 23% higher
NO2 concentrations than the rest of the
population (37). Of note, racial differ-
ences in NO2 exposure are greater in large
metropolitan centers compared with
small-to-medium urban areas, likely re-
flecting racial and ethnic segregation
around traffic corridors in major U.S. cities.
Increasing evidence implicates air pol-
lution in glucose dysregulation, including
insulin resistance (39) (Table 1). In a
small, but elegant study of residents of
rural Michigan, exposure to urban air for
only 4–5 h daily for 5 consecutive days in-
creasedHOMAinsulinresistance(HOMA-IR)
for each 10 mg/m3 increase in PM2.5 (40).
Similarly, in adults with the metabolic
syndrome living in the Beijing metropol-
itan area, variations in black carbon
and PM2.5 have been associated with
worsening insulin resistance (41). In Ger-
many, long-term exposure to PM10 and
NO2 was associated with greater insulin
resistance in 10-year-old children (42). In
addition, several studies havelinked poor
air quality with progression to diabetes.
In one study of individuals without dia-
betes followed for 5.1 years, each
interquartile range (IQR) increase in total
PM10 was associated with a 20% in-
creased risk of developing type 2 diabetes
(RR 1.20 [95% CI 1.01–1.42]) (43).
Living ,100 m (relative to .200 m)
from a busy road was associated with a
37% increased risk of developing diabetes
(RR 1.37 [95% CI 1.04–1.81]). Further-
more, higher levels of PM2.5, traffic-
specific PM10, and traffic-specific PM2.5
were associated with increased diabetes
risk; however, these measures failed to
reach statistical significance. In a study
of black women living in Los Angeles, Cal-
ifornia, followed for 10 years, incident di-
abetes rates were increased for each IQR
increase in NOx (incidence rate ratio [IRR]
1.25 [95% CI 1.07–1.46]), whereas PM2.5
was associated with a nonsignificant in-
crease in incident diabetes (IRR 1.63
[95% CI 0.78–3.44]) (44). Among woman
without diabetes from the Study of the
Influence of Air Pollution on Lung, Inflam-
mation, and Aging cohort followed for
16 years, incident diabetes increased by
15–42% per IQR of PM10 or traffic-related
air pollution (45). The data from prospec-
tive studies are not, however, uniform. In
the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis,
NOx was associated with prevalent diabe-
tes, and PM2.5 trended toward an associ-
ation (OR 1.09 [95% CI 1.00–1.17]), but
no air pollution measure was associated
with incident diabetes over 9 years of
follow-up (46). In a long-term analysis of
the Black Women’s Health Study with ad-
justment for multiple metabolic stressors,
NO2 was not associated with diabetes in-
cidence (47). Despite this heterogeneity,
epidemiological studies linking various
chemical constituents of air pollution to
diabetes risk coupled with animal studies
demonstrating that exposures to air pol-
lutants such as PM2.5 and polyaromatic
hydrocarbons disrupt metabolism and
promote inflammation (Supplementary
Table 2)suggest that differential exposure
to air pollution may augment diabetes risk
in low-income communities of color.
In addition to effects on diabetes de-
velopment per se, air pollutants may also
promote adverse outcomes in those with
the disease. For example, PM2.5 levels
modeled for home addresses were linked
to diabetes on death certificates (48),
whereas a prospective analysis of .2
million adults revealed that a 10 mg/m3 in-
crease in PM2.5 was associated with in-
creased diabetes-related mortality (49).
These findings may be related to adverse
vascular effects in individuals with diabe-
tes. In 22 patients with type 2 diabetes
living in North Carolina, daily measures
of flow-mediated vasodilatation were de-
creased in association with PM2.5 levels
(50). The clinical significance of this find-
ing may be reflected in data showing
that each 10 mg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was
associated with an 11% increased risk of
ischemic stroke in individuals with diabe-
tes (51).
BPA
BPA is a ubiquitous synthetic chemical
used in the manufacturing of polycarbon-
ate and other plastics commonly used in
consumer products; moreover, BPA is a
component of sales receipts and epoxy
resins lining food and beverage cans as
well as water pipes. BPA exposure in the
U.S. population is nearly universal (52).
Although BPA is rapidly cleared from the
body and single measurements may not
reflect cumulative exposure (53), African
Americans and people with lower in-
comes have higher BPA levels than the
population at large (Supplementary
Table 1). The reasons for these disparities
are not clear, but reduced access to fresh
food and consequential consumption of
processed foods may partly explain these
associations (54) because consuming
foods packaged in plastic or cans in-
creases BPA exposure (55). Moreover,
among individuals with low food security,
BPA levels are higheriftheyreceive emer-
gency food assistance, which includes
canned foods (56). For example, 6–11-
year-old children receiving emergency
food assistance had BPA levels that
were 54% higher than age-matched child-
ren from more affluent families (56).
Disparities in BPA exposure may con-
tribute to metabolic disease burden be-
cause increasing evidence associates BPA
with diabetes. Analyses that explore the
association between urinary BPA levels
and metabolic disease are complicated
by BPA’s rapid excretion (57); moreover,
although no definitive evidence exists that
urinary excretion of BPA is influenced by
race/ethnicity, lack of adjustment for
198

 renal function can complicate urinary
assessments in population studies (58).
Despite these caveats, the National
Toxicology Program concluded that BPA
could exert effects on glucose homeosta-
sis and insulin release on the basis of an-
imal and in vitro studies (59). Although
some heterogeneity exists across studies,
the literature that supports this conclu-
sion demonstrates myriad BPA-induced
metabolic disruptions across multiple an-
imal and cellular model systems, includ-
ing alterations in body weight regulation,
insulin action, and insulin secretion as
well as specific disruptions in b-cell,
a-cell, hepatocyte, and adipocyte func-
tion and development (Supplementary
Table 2). This conclusion is further sup-
ported by limited prospective human
studies (Table 1). In data from the NHS,
extremes of BPA quartiles were associ-
ated with incident diabetes after adjust-
ing for BMI (OR 2.08 [95% CI 1.17–3.69])
in NHS II but not NHS (60), suggesting that
age modifies BPA-associated diabetes risk
because the mean age in NHS II was 45.6
years versus 65.6 years in NHS. Alterna-
tively, these differences may have arisen
from period-cohort effects in which the
extent, diversity, or timing of exposures
may have been greater or more deleteri-
ous in NHS II. Furthermore, evidence that
the BPA-diabetes association is modified
by a diabetes genetic risk score (61) sug-
gests that some populations are more
sensitive to the diabetogenic effects of
BPA. Of note, BPA may exacerbate diabe-
tes complications because high levels of
BPA have been associated with a mark-
edly increased rate of developing chronic
kidney disease (OR 6.65 [95% CI 1.47–
30.04]) (62). In one meta-analysis that ag-
gregated cross-sectional and prospective
studies, a comparison of the highest to
lowest exposure groups demonstrated a
positive association between BPA and di-
abetes (RR 1.45 [95% CI 1.13–1.87])
(29), a finding similar to a second, more
recent meta-analysis of prevalent diabe-
tes in three cross-sectional studies (OR
1.47 [95% CI 1.21–1.80]) (63). Thus, on
the basis of reasonable evidence, differ-
ential BPA exposure may promote diabe-
tes disparities.
Phthalates
Phthalates are a diverse class of widely
used synthetic compounds. High–molecular
weight (HMW) phthalates are mainly
used as plasticizers in food packaging,
toys, and building materials, such as poly-
vinyl chloride (PVC); low–molecular weight
phthalates are used in pharmaceuticals,
personal care products, and solvents.
Phthalates are not covalently bound within
products and, thus, can volatilize or leach
out, thereby facilitating absorption
through dermal contact, ingestion, and
inhalation. Higher phthalate exposures
among people of color and people with
low income have been documented in
various studies (Supplementary Table 1),
although the sources of these exposure
differences are difficult to discern given
the widespread commercial use of phtha-
lates. Reduced access to fresh fruits and
vegetables and increased consumption of
fat-rich foods in low-income populations
may augment exposure differences be-
cause certain high-fat foods are a major
source of HMW phthalates (64). Weather-
ing of older construction materials in
low-income households may increase
inhalational phthalate exposure (65).
Furthermore, purchasing inexpensive
products likely contributes to dispropor-
tionate phthalate exposures according to
an evaluation of products at dollar stores
that revealed that 32% of PVC-containing
products exceed phthalate limits estab-
lished for children’s products by the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission (66).
Of note, personal care products and cos-
metics also contribute to phthalate expo-
sure (67), especially in women, who
typically have the highest concentrations
of phthalates (68). Indeed, certain femi-
nine hygiene products were found to be
at least partially responsible for higher
levels of monoethyl phthalate (MEP) in
African American women (69). These
data provide provocative evidence of ra-
cial,ethnic,andsocioeconomic disparities
in phthalate exposure; however, addi-
tional studies are needed to further illu-
minate the sources of these differences.
Several epidemiological studies have
linked higher phthalate exposure with di-
abetes (Table 1). In data from NHS II, total
urinary phthalate metabolites were asso-
ciated with diabetes (60). In this analysis,
metabolites of butyl phthalates and
diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) were asso-
ciated with diabetes (OR 3.16 [95% CI
1.68–5.95] and 1.91 [95% CI 1.04–3.49],
respectively). Similar to BPA, these asso-
ciations may be age-related or a conse-
quence of period-cohort effects because
similar findings were not observed with
the older, original NHS. In the Early Life
Exposures in Mexico to Environmental
Toxicants cohort, in utero levels of MEP
were associated with reduced insulin
secretion in pubertal boys (70). In the
meta-analysis of Song et al. (29), urinary
concentrations of phthalates were nearly
significantly associated with diabetes (RR
1.48 [95% CI 0.98–2.25]). With supportive
cellular and animal data demonstrating
that various phthalates have the capacity
to promote dysfunction in multiple met-
abolic tissues (Supplementary Table 2),
further prospective studies are justified
todefinethe relationship between phtha-
late exposures and diabetes risk, particu-
larly among vulnerable populations.
LINKING ENVIRONMENTAL
EXPOSURES TO DIABETES RISK
IN VULNERABLE POPULATIONS
Most studies examining links between
EDCs and diabetes have done so without
consideration of race, ethnicity, or socio-
economic status; however, recent reports
have begun to interrogate these impor-
tant interactions. In a cross-sectional
study investigating the associations be-
tween phthalates and insulin resistance,
aninteractionwithracedemonstratedthat
Mexican American (P = 0.001) and non-
Hispanic black adolescents (P = 0.002)
had significant increments in HOMA-IR
with higher levels of HMW phtha-
lates or DEHP that were not observed
in non-Hispanic whites (P $ 0.74) (71).
Similarly, in stratified models, HMW
phthalates and DEHP were more strongly
associated with HOMA-IR in adolescents
from households with lower income. In
another cross-sectional study, phthalate
levels were positively associated with
fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, or
HOMA-IR; however, the dose-response
relationship was stronger among African
Americans and Mexican Americans than
among whites (72). In the meta-analysis
of Song et al. (29), the impact of PCBs
on diabetes risk was higher in nonwhite
populations (RR 2.91 [95% CI 1.60–5.30])
compared with their white counterparts
(RR 1.94 [95% CI 1.42–2.62]); similarly,
associations between OC pesticides and
diabetes were stronger in nonwhites (RR
2.64 [95% CI 1.56–4.49]) than in whites
(RR 1.95 [95% CI 1.40–2.71]). Although
these associations are likely partially at-
tributable to higher EDC exposures, these
findings also suggest that African Ameri-
cans and Latinos have heightened sensi-
tivity to the diabetogenic effects of

 environmental contaminants because of
potential synergy with other diabetes risk
factors.
The current literature provides evi-
dence that five classes of environmental
toxicants are linked to diabetes risk in hu-
mans, and for each, vulnerable popula-
tions are disproportionately exposed.
The strength of epidemiological evidence
for these five classes varies, with the most
consistent findings observed for the per-
sistent pollutants (PCBs and OCs), likely
reflecting their long biological half-lives,
the stability of their quantitation, and
the longer time they have been studied.
Among all five classes, however, is pro-
vocative evidence of diabetes-promoting
effects as well as disparities in exposure.
Thus, although further study is required,
the unequal burden of environmental risk
factors inethnically,racially, andeconom-
ically segregated neighborhoods of color
may contribute to interethnic differences
in metabolic health.
ORIGINS OF DIFFERENTIAL
ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES
Addressing disparities in environmental
health necessitates understanding the
sociological forces that shape society.
Segregation profoundly influences indi-
vidual socioeconomic status, reinforces
unhealthy neighborhood environments,
and modifies individual behaviors (73),
all of which influence metabolic disease
susceptibility. Reduced access to afford-
able healthy foods, as seen in many Afri-
can American and Latino neighborhoods,
promotes unhealthy eating habits (54),
whereas lackofsafetyandreduced access
to green space can limit physical activity
(74). Thus, the built environment in many
communities of color potentiates two key
drivers of diabetes risk, namely diet and
exercise.
In addition, historical economic and
political racialization of residential areas
and the labor force has promoted today’s
racial segregation and the codecline of
environmental health in these neighbor-
hoods (75). Indeed, living in highly segre-
gated metropolitan areas is associated
with a greater health risk from industrial
air pollution, with African Americans at
enhanced risk relative to non-Hispanic
whites (76). Despite improvements in air
quality over time, African Americans re-
main exposed to significantly more air
pollution than non-Hispanic whites (77).
Accounts ofthe industrialdivisionoflabor
by race in major U.S. cities document how
people of color were restricted to low-
wage, hazardous occupations while simul-
taneously being confined to low-income
housing near these industries (75). Similar
labor divisions also occurred in agricul-
ture (33). Grandfathering clauses allow
older industrial facilities, often located
in America’s metropolitan centers, to
opt out of the stricter environmental reg-
ulations required of newer facilities,
thereby clustering industrial toxins within
these urban cores (76). Suburbanization
was accompanied by expansion and clus-
tering of highways near and through
neighborhoods of color (78), leading to
higher traffic-related air pollution expo-
sure among African Americans and Lati-
nos (37). A shifted focus to suburban
economic development with consequen-
tial disinvestment in inner city neigh-
borhoods has perpetuated a legacy of
environmental inequality (75). The cumu-
lative effects of these cultural forces
enhance exposure to environmental tox-
icants among African American, Latino,
and low-income communities; addressing
this history is essential to eliminating dis-
parities in metabolic health.
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH IN THE
DIABETES CLINIC
With increasing evidence that pollutants
promote metabolic dysfunction and likely
contribute to diabetes disparities, environ-
mental health will become an important
component of clinical practice. As such,
physicians need to be acquainted with
thesedatatomeaningfullyaddressthecon-
cerns of their patients who are increasingly
troubled about these links. In addition, as
these data mature, policies to improve
environmentalqualityshouldbecomecom-
ponents of comprehensive diabetes pre-
vention and management strategies. Such
efforts may have significant benefits. On
the basis of recent intriguing analyses of
the PIVUS study, 25% reductions in repre-
sentative compounds from several chemi-
cal classes discussed herein (PCBs, OC
pesticides, and phthalates) as well as per-
fluoroalkyl substances are predicted to re-
duce diabetes prevalence in Europe by 13%
(95% CI 2–22%), with a projected cost
savings of V4.51 billion/year (79). Thus,
the identification ofpatient-specific expo-
sures and implementation of exposure
reduction strategies may reduce the bur-
den of diabetes on both the individual
and society at large.

 Identifying Patients With Unique
Diabetes Phenotypes
Astute clinicians revolutionized diabetes
care by recognizing unique disease pheno-
types that were subsequently linked to
specific genetic variants and targeted
therapeutics(i.e., maturity onsetdiabetes
of the young). Similarly, comprehensive
occupational and environmental histories
inpatientswithouttheclassicalclinicalfea-
tures of type 2 diabetes and without a ge-
netic explanation may identify unique
chemical exposures that promote disease
development. Similarly, patients whose
medication needs are greater than antici-
pated may have background exposures
that exacerbate metabolic dysfunction.
Aided by the development and implemen-
tation of validated clinical questionnaires
to estimate contact with diabetogenic
chemicals, informed clinicians may be
able to identify glucose-disrupting expo-
sures and offer patients targeted interven-
tions to improve diabetes outcomes.

Environmental Inequality and Diabetes Risk
Diabetes Care Volume 41, January 2018
 Reducing Exposures to Nonpersistent
Pollutants
For patients exposed to nonpersistent dia-
betogenic pollutants, practices that in-
crease exposure to diabetogenic toxicants
offer insights into potential interventions.
For example, fast food intake increases
phthalate exposures (80), whereas con-
suming water from polycarbonate bottles
(81) or soup from cans (82) increases uri-
nary BPA levels. Built upon this knowl-
edge, clinical trials have attempted to
lower BPA and phthalate levels (Table 2).
In an intervention focused on personal
care products, attention to product con-
tents reduced levels of various chemicals,
including MEP (83). A trial focused on eat-
ing food with limited packaging reduced
levels of DEHP and BPA (84), whereas
hand washing and reduction of the use
of plastic cups lowered phthalate levels
in children (85). Although these studies
are encouraging, challenges in advising
patients remain. For example, avoiding
packaged and fast foods may be imprac-
tical in individuals with low food security.
Moreover, even careful efforts can be
confounded by unexpected exposures as
illustrated by a failed intervention during
which DEHP levels rose because of unex-
pectedly high phthalate levels in milk and
ground coriander (86). Collectively, these
data suggest that limiting contact with
plastics and packaging, encouraging
hand washing, and increasing awareness
of diabetogenic toxicants can reduce ex-
posures; however, these efforts must be
supported by regulatory action to ensure
adequate labeling of consumer products.
Finally, evidence that insulin sensitivity
rapidly shifts with changes in air quality
(40,41) suggests that advising patients to
avoid exercise near busy streets or during
peak traffic hours to limit contact with air
pollutants may afford metabolic benefits,
whereas community interventions to im-
prove air quality (e.g., access to public
transit, reduced wood and leaf burning,
expanded use of clean energy sources,
tree planting) may reduce diabetes risk.
Clinical Strategies To Reduce the Body
Burden of Persistent Pollutants
For people exposed to persistent organic
pollutants (POPs), evidence suggests that
interventions can reduce diabetogenic
EDC levels (Table 2). In several small stud-
ies, thenonabsorbablefatolestrafacilitated
elimination of lipophilic toxicants, including
the dioxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-
p-dioxin, in two patients with chloracne
(87). Moreover, olestra was shown to ac-
celerate the elimination of 37 noncopla-
nar PCBs in 11 individuals from Anniston,
Alabama (88). With regard to the meta-
bolic impact of these changes, one case
study of OC toxicity showed that 2 years
of olestra resulted in weight loss and im-
provements in glycemic control (89).
Whether these metabolic improvements
resulted from the elimination of POPs or
were simply a consequence of weight loss
requires further study. Olestra may not
universally lower POP levels, however. In
subjects who underwent a weight loss
intervention, olestra decreased levels of
b-hexachlorocyclohexane but did not
attenuate the expected weight loss–
induced rise in other OCs (90). Collec-
tively, these findings raise the possibility
that other agents that interrupt the
enterohepatic circulationoflipophilic tox-
icants similarly lower the body burden of
POPs and mitigate their diabetogenic ef-
fects. The glycemic benefits of the bile acid
sequestrantcolesevelamcouldpartiallyre-
flect clearance of metabolism-disrupting
chemicals,butthishypothesisrequiresfor-
mal testing. Other approaches to reduce
the body burden of diabetogenic EDCs
also have been tried. Supported by cross-
sectional data suggesting that fruit and
vegetable consumption attenuates the
PCB-diabetes association (91), a study of
15 healthy women showed that 1,000
mg/day of ascorbic acid for 2 months
reduced levels of six PCBs and two OC
pesticides (92).
Although further work is needed, these
small intervention trials provide clinicians
and patients with intriguing evidence that
therapeutic approaches may be devised
to mitigate exposures to diabetogenic
toxicants and potentially reverse their ad-
verse effects. On the basis of these data
and knowledge of common exposure
sources, physicians can aid patients wish-
ing to take a precautionary approach by
providing guidance on exposure-reduction
strategies (Table 3 and Healthcare Pro-
vider Guide in Supplementary Data).
CONCLUSIONS
African Americans, Latinos, and the socio-
economically disadvantaged have long
been recognized to bear a higher burden
of diabetes, but the reasons for these dis-
parities are not completely understood.
We provide evidence that higher expo-
sure to diabetogenic pollutants is an
important contributor. Although further
work is required to validate the EDC-
diabetes link and better quantify exposure
disparities, current evidence suggests that
improvements in environmental health
could reduce diabetes risk and disparities.
As additional data accumulate and the
field matures, the practicing diabetologist
and endocrinologist will be uniquely posi-
tioned to address exposure to diabeto-
genic environmental toxicants as part of
individualized diabetes care plans to re-
duce disease risk and to improve diabetes
outcomes across the population.
