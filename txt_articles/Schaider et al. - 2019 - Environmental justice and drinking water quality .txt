in nitrate levels in U.S. drinking water?

Abstract
Background: Low-income and minority communities often face disproportionately high pollutant exposures. The
lead crisis in Flint, Michigan, has sparked concern about broader socioeconomic disparities in exposures to drinking
water contaminants. Nitrate is commonly found in drinking water, especially in agricultural regions, and
epidemiological evidence suggests elevated risk of cancer and birth defects at levels below U.S. EPA’s drinking
water standard (10 mg/L NO3-N). However, there have been no nationwide assessments of socioeconomic
disparities in exposures to nitrate or other contaminants in U.S. drinking water. The goals of this study are to
identify determinants of nitrate concentrations in U.S. community water systems (CWSs) and to evaluate disparities
related to wealth or race/ethnicity.
Methods: We compiled nitrate data from 39,466 U.S. CWSs for 2010–2014. We used EPA’s Safe Drinking Water
Information System (SDWIS) to compile CWS characteristics and linked this information with both city- and county-
level demographic data gathered from the U.S. Census Bureau. After applying multiple imputation methods to
address censored nitrate concentration data, we conducted mixed-effects multivariable regression analyses at
national and regional scales.
Results: 5.6 million Americans are served by a CWS that had an average nitrate concentration ≥ 5 mg/L NO3-N
between 2010 and 2014. Extent of agricultural land use and reliance on groundwater sources were significantly
associated with nitrate. The percent of Hispanic residents served by each system was significantly associated with
nitrate even after accounting for county-level cropland and livestock production, and CWSs in the top quartile of
percent Hispanic residents exceeded 5 mg/L nearly three times as often as CWSs serving the lowest quartile. By
contrast, the percent of residents living in poverty and percent African American residents were both inversely
associated with nitrate.
Conclusions: Epidemiological evidence for health effects associated with drinking water above 5 mg/L NO3-N
raises concerns about increased risk for the 5.6 million Americans served by public water supplies with average
nitrate concentrations above this level. The associations we observed between nitrate concentrations and
proportions of Hispanic residents support the need for improved efforts to assist vulnerable communities in
addressing contamination and protecting source waters. Future studies can extend our methods to evaluate
disparities in exposures to other contaminants and links to health effects.

 Background
Drinking water quality is regulated in the United States
under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), which
establishes national monitoring and reporting require-
ments and maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for 88
contaminants. In 2013, 9800 public water systems, serving
26.5 million Americans, had violations of health-based
standards [1]. In 2015, lead contamination in the drinking
water supply of Flint, Michigan, caused elevated blood
lead levels in children following the use of a new drinking
water source, the Flint River, as a cost-saving measure [2].
Because 60% of Flint’s residents are African American and
40% live below the poverty line, this crisis sparked a
nationwide debate about environmental justice—equal
treatment and protection from environmental harm re-
gardless of race, ethnicity, or income—and drinking water
quality.
Low-income and minority communities often face
disproportionate burdens of exposure to contamination
sources and environmental pollution, and associations
with race and ethnicity persist even after accounting for
differences in income [3]. While few studies have looked
for links between drinking water and environmental
justice indicators (e.g., poverty, race/ethnicity) [4], exist-
ing studies have found associations between poorer
drinking water quality and these indicators [4–8]. Com-
munity water systems (CWSs) that serve communities
with lower median incomes, lower rates of home owner-
ship, and higher proportions of Hispanic or non-white
residents have been associated with higher levels of
nitrate and arsenic [5–7]. Among small rural water
systems in Quebec, those serving areas with more ma-
terial deprivation (based on income, education, and
employment) were more likely to have lead levels of
health concern and less likely to have advanced water
treatment [4]. Health-based violations of the SDWA
were more common in poorer communities with higher
proportions of Hispanic or African-American residents;
the effects of race and ethnicity were not apparent in
more affluent communities [8]. Environmental justice
associations with drinking water have not been consist-
ently observed, and may depend on the spatial scope
and individual contaminants studied. For instance, Cory
and Rahman [9] concluded there was limited evidence
for environmental justice disparities in exposures to ar-
senic in water systems in Arizona. The likelihood of
studies finding environmental justice associations with
the siting of hazardous waste facilities strongly depends
on the unit of analysis (e.g., county, census block) and
overall scope (e.g., state, national); studies with a small
unit of analysis and large scope were most likely to find
significant associations [10]. To date, studies of environ-
mental justice and drinking water contaminants have
considered individual states (e.g., Arizona, Oregon) or
sections of states (e.g., California’s Central Valley); how-
ever a nationwide assessment is lacking.
According to Balazs and Ray’s Drinking Water Dispar-
ities Framework [11], there are a wide range of natural,
built, and sociopolitical factors that can cause and
perpetuate disparities in water quality, reliability, and
infrastructure. Small water supplies, particularly those
that serve low-income and minority communities, may
have poorer source water quality due to closer proximity
to pollution sources. In addition, such supplies may have
diminished technical, managerial, and financial (TMF)
capacity to properly manage their drinking water, so
these systems may lack the resources necessary to
comply with testing requirements. Indeed, a nationwide
analysis indicated that small CWSs were more likely to
have management-related SDWA violations [12]. When
problems are identified, small systems with limited TMF
may struggle to address these problems, such as through
the installation of new treatment systems or develop-
ment of better protected sources [1]. In communities of
color, institutional barriers in local planning and zoning
practices may lead to lower rates of drinking water and
wastewater infrastructure improvement [13]. These can
relate to both internal factors (diminished ability to raise
rates for customers) and external factors (ability to apply
for loans). These factors are especially apparent in unin-
corporated areas, which have no tax base and lie outside
of the municipal boundaries overseen by county or state
entities.
Nitrate is one of the contaminants most frequently
found in violation of health-based standards in U.S.
drinking water [14]. Nitrate naturally occurs in aquatic
systems at low concentrations (< 1 mg/L NO3-N), while
concentrations greater than 1 mg/L NO3-N are consid-
ered elevated above background and indicative of human
activity [15]. Common anthropogenic sources of nitrate
include fertilizers used for agricultural production and
landscaping, animal manure, wastewater discharges from
sewage treatment plants and septic systems, and fossil
fuel combustion. Elevated levels of nitrate can signal the
presence of other contaminants of concern; a study of
over 2000 private wells found that wells with > 1 mg/L
NO3-N were more likely to have levels of pesticides and
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) above one-tenth of
an MCL or health-based screening level [15]. Among
public and private wells in sand and gravel aquifers,
nitrate concentrations were correlated with pharmaceu-
ticals and other unregulated drinking water contami-
nants [16, 17].
As part of the original implementation of the SDWA
in 1974, the U.S. EPA established a nitrate MCL of 10
mg/L NO3-N (45 mg/L NO3
−) based on case studies of
methemoglobinemia in infants who consumed formula
mixed with water containing nitrate [18]. More recent

 epidemiological studies have found associations between
nitrate concentrations in drinking water and bladder
cancer [19, 20], thyroid cancer [21, 22], colon cancer
[23, 24], kidney cancer [25], birth defects [26, 27], low
birth weight [28], and preterm birth [29, 30]. Some of
these effects were significant for exposures at or above 5
mg/L, particularly over longer exposure periods [21, 23,
26, 27]. The International Agency for Research on
Cancer classified “ingested nitrate or nitrite under condi-
tions that result in endogenous nitrosation” as a prob-
able human carcinogen (Group 2A) [31]. Exposure to
nitrate in drinking water has also been linked to thyroid
dysfunction [32], although the Agency for Toxic Sub-
stances and Disease Registry concluded that there is
“limited evidence” for nitrate-induced thyroid dysfunc-
tion [33]. The U.S. EPA’s Integrated Risk Information
System (IRIS) is undertaking a broad re-evaluation of
the health effects of nitrate and nitrite [34].
In light of growing epidemiological evidence for nitrate
health effects below the MCL and evidence on a local
level for socioeconomic disparities in nitrate exposure,
our study was designed to evaluate whether nitrate con-
centrations are elevated in public water supplies that
serve
communities
with
higher
proportions
of
low-income and/or minority residents. We hypothesized
that CWSs serving communities with higher proportions
of Hispanic residents would have higher nitrate levels
because 80% of U.S. farmworkers are Hispanic [35] and
because synthetic fertilizers used in agriculture are the
largest source of nitrogen inputs in the U.S. [36]. We
also anticipated that the high cost of removing nitrate
from contaminated drinking water would lead to socio-
economic disparities in nitrate exposures. This study
represents
the
first
investigation
of
socioeconomic
disparities
in
drinking
water
contaminants
at
the
national scale and provides new insights into the inter-
play
of
system
characteristics
and
demographic
parameters.
Methods
Water system and demographic data sources
Detailed information about public water systems was
gathered from the U.S. EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Infor-
mation System (SDWIS) [37]. Our target population
were CWSs in each U.S. state that were active at some
point between 2010 and 2014. We restricted our analysis
to CWSs because these systems serve customers in their
homes year-round, whereas non-community systems can
serve non-residential settings such as office buildings
and campgrounds. We did not include CWSs that pur-
chased their water from another supplier; purchasing
water systems are rarely required to test for nitrate and
therefore rarely collect nitrate data. In total, we retrieved
data for 412,835 systems, of which 42,114 were CWSs
active between 2010 and 2014 that did not purchase
their water. Relevant characteristics obtained for each
system included: activity status, system type (commu-
nity, non-community, etc.), number of people served,
source
water type
(groundwater
or
surface water),
affiliated wholesaler or purchasing systems, and region
served by the system (city, county). CWS system sizes
were classified using categories defined by the EPA: very
small (≤500 people); small (501–3300); medium (3301–
10,000);
large
(10,001–100,000);
and
very
large
(>100,000).
We obtained race, ethnicity, poverty, and home owner-
ship information (2010–2014 five-year estimates) and
the proportion of households in urbanized areas (2010
estimates) from the U.S. Census Bureau for each county,
census-designated place, and county subdivision in the
50 U.S. states [38, 39]. Agricultural data on the amount
of livestock (cows, goats, horses, pigs, sheep) per 100
acres and the percent of land area used as cropland were
obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 2012
Census of Agriculture for each U.S. county [40]. Demo-
graphics and agriculture variables were assumed to
remain constant throughout our study period.
Identifying populations served by CWSs
Characterizing the demographics of the communities
served by each water system is challenging in part
because little information is publicly available on the
geographic areas served by each CWS [41]. Few states
provide public access to electronic records documenting
the service areas of their public water systems, so we
relied on the information included in SDWIS.
SDWIS’s Water System module provides address vari-
ables conveying the location of each water system’s “legal
entity,” i.e., the mailing address of the administrative
personnel associated with the system. Separate variables,
city served and county served, describe the areas to
which a system directly provides water, and the primacy
agency code specifies the agency that has regulatory
oversight of the water system (typically a state agency
encompassing the cities or counties served). Using
SDWIS’s Geographic Area module, which some states
primarily use to report the “areas served” parameters, we
were able to augment our database’s cities and counties
served.
We used the city served and county served fields in
SDWIS to determine the areas served by each CWS.
SDWIS provided information in the counties served field
for > 99% of CWSs (n = 41,781), but only 48.1% of CWSs
reported information in the cities served field (n =
20,267). By contacting state agencies, we were able to
supplement SDWIS data for 1509 CWSs in three states;
however, 13 states rarely or never record information in
the cities served field (Fig. 1). Although administrative
Schaider et al. Environmental Health            (2019) 18:3 
Page 3 of 15
 address information was available for nearly all water
systems, we concluded that such data did not reliably
identify the areas served by each CWS. Some system
administrator addresses were located hundreds of miles
away from the cities served by their affiliated water
systems or were located in a different state, and for 40%
of the systems with both a city name (pertaining to the
administrator’s city) and a city served designated in
SDWIS, the two fields shared no overlapping cities. Fur-
thermore, the demographics of the areas associated with
the administrative addresses often varied substantially
from the demographics of each water system’s cities
served (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Data obtained for wholesale water systems varied
widely in whether they included the cities or customers
served by downstream purchasing systems. Because
purchasing systems were not included in our analysis, it
was important that the data for each wholesaler included
all of the cities that purchase its water in order to best
characterize the population served by each CWS. As
described in Additional file 1, we amended wholesalers’
city served and population served fields to include the
area and people served by systems that purchase whole-
sale water. As a result of these modifications, we ex-
panded data on the cities served for 1245 wholesale
systems (174 of which lacked any city served data prior
to considering purchased water systems) and adjusted
the system size for 220 wholesale systems. Data that we
compiled for U.S. CWSs, including service areas and
purchaser-seller connections, are provided in Additional
files 2 and 3.
Linking demographic and water system data
Water system characteristics and demographic data were
linked by matching the names in the SDWIS city served
and county served fields with the geographic names in
the Census Bureau demographic data. Because the
majority of city served names matched to county subdi-
visions in the Northeastern U.S. (Pennsylvania and all
states to the north and east), county subdivision demo-
graphics were prioritized as a match for CWSs in the
Northeast. Census-designated places were prioritized in
all other U.S. regions, where county subdivision match-
ing was infrequent. Notably, the city served and county
served fields are not checked for consistency at a
national level, so SDWIS entries are prone to local (ra-
ther than official) naming conventions and typographical
errors. We used an approximate string matching algo-
rithm based on Jaro-Winkler distance to identify the
most similar name in the demographic data for each city
served and county served that did not have an identical
match. Typographical errors and differences in abbrevi-
ation conventions were corrected to improve string
matching. All county served names provided by SDWIS
were matched to Census Bureau records in this manner.
For city served names that did not match or matched
multiple Census Bureau records after these corrections,
we gathered additional information from online encyclo-
pedias and search engines about individual water sys-
tems and geographical locations. In some cases, this
additional information allowed us to definitively link city
served names from SDWIS with location names in
Census Bureau data, while in other cases the names

either because they did not have a community water system on record or because we were unable to collect nitrate data for that area

 were considered non-matching and were not included in
subsequent analyses. In total, we successfully linked
demographic data to every CWS that provided a county
served (41,781 systems) and 96.8% of CWSs for which
we had city served information (21,253 systems).
For CWSs serving multiple cities or counties, we
calculated a weighted average for each demographic par-
ameter based on the relative populations of each of the
cities or counties served. For instance, if a CWS served
five cities, then the proportion of Hispanic residents
associated with that CWS was calculated as an average
of the proportion of Hispanic residents in each of the five
cities, weighted by each city’s population. When demo-
graphic information was missing for one or more cities
served, as was the case for 262 systems (1.2%), these
weighted averages were calculated based on all available
demographic data for cities served by that system.
Nitrate data
There is no national database of water contaminant
concentration data. Thus, nitrate data were acquired by
contacting SDWA-designated primacy agencies in each
state through a combination of email and Freedom of
Information Act requests and by gathering data from
ten state-operated online data portals. In total, we com-
piled data for over 2.7 million samples analyzed for
nitrate and/or nitrate-nitrite (sum of nitrate plus nitrite).
Of these, 616,591 samples were collected from our CWSs
between 2010 and 2014, covering 40,178 (96.2%) of the
systems for which we had county-level demographic data.
Nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations were used when avail-
able to estimate each CWS’s annual nitrate concentra-
tion. However, CWSs in 13 states primarily reported
nitrate-nitrite (NO3/NO2-N) data, and some CWSs
reported both. In order to extrapolate NO3-N concentra-
tions from NO3/NO2-N concentrations, we used a uni-
variate linear regression based on all samples for which
we could pair by system, sampling date, and sub-facility
(n = 48,925
pairs).
This
regression
([NO3-N] =
0.987*[NO3/NO2-N], r2 ≈ 0.93) was used to estimate
NO3-N concentrations when only NO3/NO2-N concen-
trations were provided.
We made additional adjustments to the dataset to
address discrepancies in how nitrate data were reported
by states. In some cases units (mg/L, μg/L) were either
missing or appeared to be misreported (e.g., 0.2 ng/L),
complicating
the
interpretation
of
sample
results,
particularly those that substantially diverged from other
samples collected from the same system. We developed
a protocol to identify outliers that were either misre-
ported or misevaluated based on the average difference
between each sample result and other samples from that
system. Outliers were confirmed by visual inspection,
and we removed 498 of such cases (0.1% of all samples)
from the analysis. In addition, 17 states never provided
detection limits (DLs) for samples without detectable
nitrate. DLs are useful for quantitative analyses of non-
detects to constrain the range of possible values for sam-
ples below the DL (e.g., < 0.2 mg/L indicates a more
limited range of possible concentrations than < 1 mg/L).
Among 151,463 nitrate and nitrate-nitrite samples for
which DLs were provided, 99.4% of DLs were ≤ 1 mg/L
and 17.4% of DLs were exactly 1 mg/L, so 1 mg/L was
used as a reasonable upper-bound DL for all nondetects
that were missing a DL (12.3% of all samples).
Statistical analyses
We used a mixed-effects linear regression model to
evaluate the relationship between nitrate concentrations
and demographic, system-characteristic, and land-use
data. Model parameters were selected a priori to allow
us to explore associations between environmental justice
indicators and nitrate concentrations while controlling
for possible confounders. Environmental justice indica-
tors included those related to race and ethnicity (percent
Hispanic residents, percent non-Hispanic Black resi-
dents) and those related to poverty (percent of families
with income below the poverty line, percent of home
ownership). System characteristics of interest included
system size and type of source water (surface water or
groundwater). Land use variables (number of livestock
per 100 acres, percent of land area used as cropland,
percentage of homes in urbanized areas) were included
to account for agricultural and wastewater contributions
to nitrate source water contamination. State was in-
cluded as a random effect to capture the influence of
different monitoring and reporting practices for drinking
water and differences in state regulations of pollutant
sources and enforcement. In the baseline model, we used
county-level demographics because county served infor-
mation was provided for nearly all CWSs, offering nearly
complete geographical coverage (Fig. 1). Collinearity was
evaluated by visual inspection of Spearman correlation co-
efficients (Additional file 1: Tables S2-S6) and by calculating
variance inflation factors (VIFs) for each model. Race, eth-
nicity, and at least one poverty indicator were retained in
all models, and other covariates were retained if they were
significantly associated with the outcome (p < 0.05) or if re-
moving them from the model changed the effect estimates
for other covariates by more than 10%.
Nitrate data were right skewed and approximately log-
normal. Because nitrate concentrations were below the
DL in nearly 30% of water samples, we used a multiple
imputation method adapted from Lubin et al. [42] to
address nondetects. Multiple imputation can provide less
biased variance estimates relative to a simple substitu-
tion method (typically DL/2 or DL/
ffiffiffi
2
p
) in datasets with
Schaider et al. Environmental Health            (2019) 18:3 
Page 5 of 15
 more than 10% nondetects [42]. For each year in which
a CWS operated (“system-year”), we calculated a mini-
mum average nitrate concentration, imputing zero for
nondetects, and a maximum average nitrate concentra-
tion, imputing the DL for nondetects. Together, these
values constitute an interval that contains every possible
system-year
average,
and
for
system-years
without
nondetect data, these two values are identical. Because
we lacked information on the relative contributions of
multiple sources to overall water flow within a system,
we assumed all sub-facilities and all samples contributed
equally to the system-year average. For each system, we
then calculated a five-year system average concentration
as an interval, with the lower/upper bounds of the inter-
val represented as the average of all of the minima/max-
ima of system-year intervals, respectively. The ranges of
these five-year system average intervals were generally
narrow: 67.3% of system averages had a range ≤ 0.2 mg/
L, 99.8% had a range ≤ 1 mg/L, and 0.2% (91 systems)
had a system average interval range > 1 mg/L.
We used non-parametric bootstrap resampling (1000
bootstrap iterations) and maximum likelihood estima-
tion to estimate means (~
x) and standard deviations (~
σ) of
a normal distribution that best fit the natural logarithms
of our system average intervals. Natural log-transformed
system averages were then randomly imputed in accord-
ance with the proportions of the cumulative distribution
function of a normal distribution with mean
~
x
and
standard deviation ~
σ truncated at the natural logarithms
of the system average minimum and maximum. We did
not impute values for system averages based entirely on
detected concentrations (37.9% of systems) because we
could calculate these averages directly. We then evalu-
ated ln-transformed system averages as the outcome
variable in a mixed-effects regression model. This pro-
cedure (bootstrap resampling, lognormal parameter esti-
mation,
imputation,
and
regression
analysis)
was
repeated five times to determine the consistency of our
results. Regression results from each of these five phases
were pooled using techniques outlined by Rubin [43].
To evaluate disparities in drinking water exposures
to nitrate levels of health concern, we conducted a
separate set of analyses in which we dichotomized the
outcome variable. Using the same multiple imputation
approach, systems were categorized as “high nitrate”
if their estimated system average was ≥5 mg/L, a level
associated with adverse health outcomes in some epi-
demiological studies, and as “low nitrate” otherwise.
We used a generalized logistic mixed-effects regres-
sion model to evaluate the effects of the same set of
predictors, including the state-specific random effect,
on the binary nitrate response variable. As before, five
sets of regression results were pooled using the Rubin
method.
We assessed whether our results depended on geo-
graphic region or on the spatial resolution of the demo-
graphic data. To evaluate variability across geographic
regions, we conducted a similar set of regression analyses
stratified into four regions (Midwest, Northeast, South,
and West) defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. To evaluate
the effect of the spatial scale of the demographic data, we
also repeated our analyses using demographic data repre-
senting the city or cities served by each CWS. Thirteen
states rarely or never report city served values in SDWIS
(Fig. 1), so a substantial portion (49.4%) of CWSs were not
included in this city-level analysis. Since agricultural data
were only available at the county level, our analyses using
city-level demographics included agricultural variables
corresponding to the counties served by each system. Fi-
nally, to determine whether differences between the
county-level and city-level results were more dependent
on the scope (geographic area considered in the analysis)
or scale (resolution of the city vs. county demographics),
we developed an intermediate third model using county-
level demographics for only those CWSs included in our
city-level analysis.
All analyses were conducted using R version 3.4.1 [44].
Results
Of the 42,114 CWSs that did not purchase water from
another system and were active between 2010 and 2014,
we were able to match 39,466 CWSs to both a complete
county-level demographic profile and at least one nitrate
measurement from that time period (Additional file 1:
Figure S1). The 39,466 CWSs in our analysis served
233.2 million people, more than 70% of the U.S. popula-
tion (Table 1). Over 90% of the CWSs in our sample
served ≤10,000 people (very small, small, and medium
size systems); these systems provided water to less than
20% of the population served by public water supplies
overall. Nearly 90% of the CWSs in our sample have
groundwater sources; however, the majority of the popu-
lation in our sample area (65%) is served by a CWS with
a surface water source.
The majority of estimated annual mean nitrate concen-
trations were below 1 mg/L for all system sizes, regions,
and source water types. However, 1647 CWSs, serving
over 5.6 million Americans, had average nitrate concen-
trations at or above 5 mg/L from 2010 to 2014. The West
and Midwest had the highest proportions of high nitrate
systems (≥5 mg/L) and the highest 95th percentile nitrate
concentrations, while the South had the lowest (Table 1).
The proportion of high nitrate CWSs was nearly four
times higher for systems that rely on groundwater sources
compared to CWSs that rely on surface water sources,
and the 95th percentile concentration for groundwater
systems was more than 2 mg/L higher. Relative to other
system sizes, very small systems (≤500 people) had the
Schaider et al. Environmental Health            (2019) 18:3

 highest 95th percentile concentration and the highest
proportion of high nitrate systems.
Among environmental justice indicators, race and
ethnicity differed among regions and across system sizes,
while wealth-related factors were less variable. Black and
Hispanic residents made up a larger proportion of resi-
dents served by very large systems than smaller systems.
Systems in the South served the highest proportion of
Black residents, and CWSs in the West served the high-
est proportion of Hispanic residents. The proportion of
residents with annual incomes below the U.S. Census
poverty threshold did not vary considerably as a function
of system size, while rates of home ownership were low-
est in counties served by very large systems. Poverty
rates were highest in the South and West, and rates of
home ownership were lowest in the West.
We observed significant differences in the demograph-
ics and land use patterns between high nitrate and low
nitrate (mean < 5 mg/L) CWSs (Table 2). High nitrate
CWSs served nearly twice as many Hispanic residents
on average compared to low nitrate CWSs, and CWSs
that served the highest proportion of Hispanic residents
(top quartile) exceeded 5 mg/L nitrate nearly three times
as often as CWSs serving the lowest proportion of His-
panic residents (lowest quartile; Additional file 1: Figure
S2). By contrast, high nitrate CWSs served less than half

 counties with less agricultural and livestock produc-
tion (Additional file 1: Figure S2). For instance, 9.1%
of CWSs were high nitrate in counties in the top
quartile for cropland, while only 1.8% of CWSs were
high nitrate in counties in the bottom quartile for
cropland.
In our national mixed-effects regression analyses using
county-level demographic data, race and ethnicity vari-
ables showed similar associations with both system
average nitrate concentrations and the likelihood of sys-
tem averages exceeding 5 mg/L (Table 3). A one-unit
increase in the percent of Hispanic residents was associ-
ated with a 1.8% increase in nitrate concentrations [95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.6, 2.0%] and a 1.9% increase
in the likelihood of high nitrate concentrations (95% CI:
1.4, 2.4%). By contrast, a one-unit increase in the percent
of non-Hispanic Black residents was associated with a
1.3% decrease in nitrate concentrations (95% CI: –1.5,
−1.0%) and a 4.3% decrease in the likelihood of high ni-
trate (95% CI: –5.7, −2.9%). Similar effect estimates were
observed in unadjusted models (Additional file 1: Table
S7). Poverty, but not home ownership, was inversely
associated with nitrate in the adjusted models, with a
one-unit increase in the percent of people with incomes
below the poverty line associated with 0.8% lower nitrate
concentrations (95% CI: –1.2, −0.3%) and a 2.2% de-
crease in the likelihood of high nitrate (95% CI: –3.7,
−0.7%). In unadjusted models, we observed a similar
estimate for the association between poverty and nitrate
concentrations
but
did
not
observe
an
association
between poverty and likelihood of high nitrate, and in
contrast
to
the
adjusted
models,
home
ownership
showed significant inverse associations with both out-
comes (Additional file 1: Table S7).
We observed complex relationships between nitrate
levels and system size. In the binary model, very small
systems had a greater likelihood of high nitrate com-
pared to small and medium systems. By contrast, very
small systems were predicted to have lower concentra-
tions than other system sizes when nitrate was evaluated
as a continuous variable (compared to very small sys-
tems, nitrate concentrations were 9.0% higher in small
systems and 51% higher in very large systems; Table 3).
In unadjusted models, the same observations were
noted; very small systems were predicted to have greater
likelihood of high nitrate but lower continuous nitrate
concentrations than all other system sizes (Additional
file 1: Table S7). For other variables related to water sys-
tem characteristics and land use, systems relying on
groundwater sources had 34% higher nitrate concentra-
tions compared to systems relying on surface water (95%
CI: 26, 42%) and were more than four times as likely to
have high levels of nitrate (odds ratio = 4.1; 95% CI: 3.0,
5.6). The extent of cropland coverage and livestock

 production had significant but small associations with
nitrate concentrations, while a one-unit increase in the
percent of land area used as cropland had a more
substantial effect (3.3% increase, 95% CI: 3.0, 3.7%) on
the likelihood that a CWS had high nitrate.
The results of our analysis using city-level demograph-
ics, based on the subset of CWSs that provided city
served information (50.6%, Fig. 1), varied in several not-
able ways from the results of our broader county-level
analysis. In the city-level analysis, poverty was not asso-
ciated with nitrate concentrations (Table 4), while home
ownership, which was not significant in the national
county-level analysis, was associated with lower nitrate.
A one unit increase in percent home ownership (roughly
equivalent to a one unit decrease in percent renters) was
predicted to result in 0.4% lower nitrate (95% CI; −0.6,
−0.2%). Similarly, the association between urbanicity and
nitrate was significant in the city-level, but not the
county-level analysis; a one-unit increase in the percent
of households located in urbanized areas was associated
with a 0.2% increase in nitrate (95% CI: 0.1, 0.3%).
To evaluate whether differences between the city- and
county-level analyses were related to the refined spatial
scale of cities or trends specific to the portion of the
country that provided city information, we conducted an
additional analysis using county-level demographics for
only those CWSs that provided city served information
(“county-level
subset”).
Overall,
the
results
of
this
county-level subset model were similar to the results of
the
nationwide
analysis
using
county-level
data.
Although the magnitude of some coefficients in the
county-level subset analysis changed relative to the
national analysis (for instance, race/ethnicity had ap-
proximately half of the effect on nitrate concentrations
and poverty had about twice the effect), the statistical
significance and directionality of the predictors were
comparable (Table 4). The results of this comparison
suggest that the differences between the county- and
city-level analyses are primarily due to different relation-
ships between nitrate levels and demographic predictors
at various spatial scales, rather than being an artifact of
the part of the country evaluated in the subset analyses.
We included region as a covariate in our nationwide
models because of regional differences in nitrate concen-
trations and demographic characteristics (Table 1) and
significant differences
among
some regions in un-
adjusted models (Additional file 1: Table S7). In the un-
adjusted models, the Midwest and West had the highest
proportions of high nitrate systems, while the West had
higher nitrate concentrations than the Midwest and
South. In the adjusted models, the Midwest had signifi-
cantly lower nitrate concentrations than other regions,
while only the West had a higher proportion of high ni-
trate systems than the Midwest. To investigate potential
regional differences in associations among demograph-
ics, water system characteristics, land use, and nitrate

 concentrations, we stratified our nationwide model by
region.
In these regionally stratified models using county-level
demographics, no single feature had the same impact on
system average nitrate concentrations across all four
U.S. regions (Table 5). The Midwest was the only region
in which the percent of cropland was not associated with
nitrate and the only region in which percent of Hispanic
residents did not have a positive association with nitrate
levels. The Midwest also had the strongest effect of
urbanicity; a one-unit increase in the percent of urban
households was associated with 0.4% lower nitrate (95%
CI: –0.6, −0.3%). The percent of non-Hispanic Black res-
idents was only significantly associated with nitrate in
the South, where a one-unit increase was associated with
a 1.2% reduction in nitrate levels (95% CI: –1.5, −1.0%),
nearly the same as for the U.S. as a whole (1.3% reduc-
tion). Home ownership had a strong inverse association
with nitrate in the West, where a one unit increase in
percent home ownership was associated with a 1.4% de-
cline in nitrate concentrations (95% CI: –2.0, −0.7%); in
the other three regions, home ownership was not associ-
ated with nitrate. The effect of groundwater source
water on nitrate concentrations varied substantially
across the regions: in the West, systems with ground-
water sources had 139% higher levels of nitrate than
those with surface water sources (95% CI: 115, 167%),
while in the South, systems that relied on groundwater
had 17% lower nitrate than systems with surface water
sources (95% CI: –24, −8.1%). Nitrate concentrations in-
creased with system size in the Midwest and West, with
very large systems in the Midwest having the largest ef-
fect (223% increase relative to very small systems, 95%
CI: 102, 418%).
Discussion
This study represents the first nationwide analysis of
socioeconomic disparities in exposures to contaminants
in public drinking water. We found that 5.6 million
Americans relied on a public water supply with an aver-
age nitrate concentration ≥ 5 mg/L, one-half of U.S.
EPA’s drinking water standard, over the five-year period
spanning 2010–2014. Epidemiological studies have sug-
gested that long-term exposure to water with nitrate
concentrations above 5 mg/L may be associated with
some types of cancer, birth defects, and preterm birth
[19, 23, 27, 29]. We found that the proportion of His-
panic residents was significantly associated with nitrate
levels, while the proportion of Black residents was
inversely associated with nitrate levels. The associations
with poverty and home ownership were mixed; when we
used the demographics of the counties served by each
water supply, we found that poverty was negatively asso-
ciated with nitrate, while home ownership, an indicator
of wealth and political empowerment, was inversely
associated with nitrate when we used city-level demo-
graphics. Very small water systems (serving ≤ 500
people) had the highest nitrate levels overall, but after
adjusting for demographics and local land use (cropland,
livestock production, and urbanicity), very small systems
were predicted to have lower nitrate levels than larger
systems.

 We found that the percent of Hispanic residents was
associated with higher nitrate levels in our nationwide
analysis and in all U.S. regions except the Midwest.
These associations were modest; nationally, a 10%
increase in the proportion of Hispanic residents (i.e., in-
creasing from 10 to 20%) served by a CWS was associ-
ated with a 19.6% increase in nitrate concentration.
Balazs et al. [6] also saw an association between percent
Hispanic residents and nitrate levels in small public
water supplies in California’s Central Valley, an agricul-
turally intensive area. We had hypothesized that propor-
tion of Hispanic residents would be associated with
nitrate because many agricultural communities have a
high proportion of Hispanic residents. However, our
observed association persisted even after we adjusted for
agricultural activity by including cropland and livestock
production as covariates in our models (Table 3) and
our nationwide correlation analysis found a negative
correlation between the proportion of Hispanic residents
and percent cropland (Additional file 1: Table S2). These
results suggest that the association between Hispanic
residents and nitrate is not solely explained by proximity
to agricultural sources, although adjusting for county-
level cropland and livestock production will not elimin-
ate residual confounding of the association between
proportion of Hispanic residents and nitrate concentra-
tion by agricultural contamination of source waters since
our covariates do not account for other factors such as
soil type, rates of fertilizer use, and adoption of best
management practices to control fertilizer runoff. Never-
theless,
while
agriculture
is
the
largest
source
of
land-based nitrogen inputs, major sources are also
present in urban areas, including wastewater treatment
plants, leaking sewer lines, and urban runoff [14]. Our
correlation analysis found a positive correlation between
percent Hispanic residents and percent urban house-
holds (Additional file 1: Table S2), suggesting that some
of the association between Hispanic residents and nitrate
levels may be related to nitrate sources in urban areas.
In addition to proximity to nitrate pollution sources, the
observed relationship between proportion of Hispanic
residents and nitrate may be indicative of disparities in
TMF resources related to source water protection and
water treatment. Communities with higher proportions of
minority residents, particularly those who are non-native
English speakers, may have less political influence and
may be disenfranchised from political and budgetary
decision-making processes [11], and therefore may have
fewer resources to install new treatment technology or
develop new source waters in response to contamination.
In our analysis, we are not able to identify the relative
importance of proximity to nitrate sources and manage-
ment-related
factors.
Nevertheless,
our
findings
are
consistent
with
prior
studies
in
which
Hispanic
communities were found to have higher drinking water
exposures to arsenic, another contaminant regulated
under the SDWA. In Oregon, communities served by
CWSs in violation of the arsenic MCL had a much higher
proportion of Hispanic residents [5], and in Arizona, the
proportion of Hispanic residents served by a public water
system was positively associated with the likelihood that
that system violated the arsenic MCL [9]. Since arsenic in
groundwater often comes from geogenic rather than an-
thropogenic sources [5, 7], these associations may be indi-
cative of disparities in the ability of communities to afford
enhanced drinking water treatment technologies, and
taken together, suggest that Hispanic communities may
experience elevated exposures to multiple drinking water
contaminants.
In contrast to our results for Hispanic residents, we
observed that the proportion of Black residents was
inversely associated with nitrate on a national level, al-
though this association was only observed in the South
in our regional analysis. The inverse association ob-
served nationally may be heavily influenced by the
South, which has the lowest proportion of high nitrate
systems, the most water systems, and the highest pro-
portion of Black residents of all regions. In the South,
the negative relationship between the proportion of
Black residents and nitrate levels may be explained in
part by biogeochemical factors. Pennino et al. [14]
suggested that the lack of nitrate MCL violations in Lou-
isiana, Mississippi, and Alabama—states that all have
> 25% Black residents—may be associated with biological
uptake and transformation processes and regional geo-
logical factors. The finding of no significant association
between the proportion of Black residents and nitrate
levels in the West is consistent with findings of Balazs et
al. [6], who observed no significant relationship between
non-Hispanic people of color and nitrate levels in Cali-
fornia’s Central Valley.
The associations between wealth-related parameters
(poverty and home ownership) and nitrate levels differed
among U.S. regions and various spatial resolutions of the
demographic data. In our national adjusted models using
county-level demographics, poverty was inversely associ-
ated with nitrate levels while home ownership was not
associated with nitrate. By contrast, when we used
demographic data corresponding to cities and towns
rather than counties, we observed that poverty was not
associated with nitrate and that home ownership was
inversely associated with nitrate, implying that cities and
towns with higher proportions of renters tend to have
higher nitrate levels. The effect estimates for poverty
and home ownership varied between unadjusted and
adjusted models, although our model building approach
with a priori variable selection does not indicate which
covariates were associated with the most substantial
Schaider et al. Environmental Health            (2019) 18:3 
Page 11 of 15
 changes in these estimates. As with race/ethnicity,
wealth can be expected to relate to levels of contamin-
ation in two ways: proximity to pollution sources and
ability to treat contaminated source water. While we
adjusted our models for agriculture and urbanicity, these
variables may not have captured proximity to other
important sources of nitrate inputs, such as landfills,
industrial facilities, fossil fuel combustion, and home
building [36, 45]. Such factors may be related to wealth
to the extent that they are driven by economic activity.
Discrepancies between our city- and county-level ana-
lyses could be explained if county-level wealth operated
in our model as the best proxy for nitrogen sources not
accounted for by other variables, while city-level wealth
better represented civic engagement, capacity to raise
customer rates, and, by consequence, ability to treat
contaminated water.
We hypothesized that smaller water systems would
have higher nitrate concentrations. Smaller water sys-
tems may have fewer financial and technical resources
to address contamination issues when they arise [1], and
the cost of water treatment per household is consider-
ably higher for smaller systems because of a lack of
economies of scale [9]. Indeed, very small systems had
higher 95th percentile nitrate concentrations than larger
systems and were more likely to exceed 5 mg/L nitrate
in unadjusted models. Additionally, after adjusting for
demographic and land use parameters, very small sys-
tems were more likely to have high nitrate compared to
small and medium sized systems. However, in our re-
gression analyses with nitrate as a continuous variable,
very small systems had lower nitrate concentrations
compared to larger system size categories nationwide
(Table 3) and in the Midwest, Northeast, and West
(Table 5). Taken together, these results suggest that
larger systems have higher nitrate on average, but that
very small systems are more likely than other system
sizes to have nitrate concentrations at the high end of
the distribution. Previous studies have found inconsist-
ent relationships between system size and contaminant
violations. Switzer and Teodoro [8] identified a negative
relationship between the population served by a system
and the system’s number of health-based SDWA viola-
tions (MCL and treatment technique violations) in a
subset of CWSs across the U.S., while Rahman et al. [46]
reported a positive association between MCL violations
and the number of people served by water systems in
Arizona. In a purely statistical sense, larger water sys-
tems may be more likely to detect elevated nitrate levels
because they are required to test more frequently and, in
the case of groundwater systems, might draw from a
greater number of source water wells.
Beyond health-based violations, very small CWSs were
reported to have more frequent violations of monitoring
and reporting requirements than larger systems [47].
This observation is consistent with our data: of the
41,781 CWSs we paired with county demographics, very
small systems were significantly more likely than larger
systems to lack nitrate sample results over the five-year
study period (5.2% of very small systems missing nitrate
data compared to 1.8% of larger systems; Pearson χ2 =
301). This difference is unlikely to be due to differences
in testing requirements, since CWSs are required to test
for nitrate annually or more frequently [48]. Such
difficulties in adequately monitoring drinking water con-
taminants likely stem from limited financial resources
and/or managerial expertise, and may signal concurrent
challenges in conforming to SDWA health-based guide-
lines. In this regard, Balazs and Ray [11] reported that
very small water systems in Fresno County, California,
that had failed to monitor for drinking water contami-
nants under county governance were found to have
MCL violations when state officials investigated.
Strengths of our study include the extensive scale and
completeness of our dataset for both demographics and
water quality data, and our use of information about
purchasing water systems to link water quality data with
entire areas served by CWSs. A major limitation to our
analysis is the potential for exposure misclassification.
Because we lacked information about flow volumes from
multiple sources within CWSs, we weighted all samples
collected for each CWS equally. In some cases, this may
have led to overestimates of nitrate concentrations in
systems where more contaminated sources are pumped
less frequently or only maintained for backup; this over-
estimation may affect groundwater systems more since
we anticipate that they may have more intake points
than CWSs with surface water sources. Furthermore, ni-
trate concentrations may show substantial intra-annual
variability, so depending on when nitrate samples were
collected within each year, our aggregated metrics may
not capture the true average nitrate concentration for
each CWS. As with any study of population-level data,
we are limited in our ability to draw conclusions about
individual exposures and thus limited in our ability to
infer causal relationships between the EJ variables of
interest and exposure to nitrate in drinking water.
Nitrate levels in CWSs may not accurately reflect the
exposures among residents in those areas because some
residents may rely on bottled water. Use of bottled water
may
exacerbate
disparities
in
pollutant
exposures
because lower-income residents have lower ability to pay
for bottled water. Another limitation was that we lacked
information about cities and towns served for about half
of the CWSs in our analysis and so we had to rely on
county-level demographics in most analyses, which is a
limitation because demographic data for a county may
not accurately reflect the demographics of all cities and
Schaider et al. Environmental Health            (2019) 18:3 
Page 12 of 15
 towns within each county. Our analysis using city-level
demographics is limited in its geographic scope, al-
though this did not seem to account for the differences
in model results using city- and county-level demo-
graphic data. Ideally, we would use census block level in-
formation to provide the best resolution of demographic
data. However, because geocoded information that speci-
fies the CWS serving each census block is not available,
we could not analyze data at the census block level. For
small CWSs that serve part of a large city, we used the
demographics of the whole city, but the demographics of
the population served by the CWS may vary from those
of the city overall. Some CWSs were not included in our
analysis because we could not match the names of the
cities and towns served with locations in the Census
Bureau data, although this accounted for a very small
proportion of systems. We also could not include unin-
corporated areas in our city-level analysis because they
are not included in Census Bureau data. Finally, we were
unable to compile nitrate data for all CWSs. In some
cases, this was related to data handling problems; for in-
stance, some records were only available in paper reports,
and in other cases, this may reflect a lack of compliance
with monitoring requirements, which is more likely for
small rural communities who may not be able to afford
testing or where there is less enforcement of testing
requirements.
Our study did not include the 44 million Americans
who rely on a private well for their drinking water, for
whom water quality testing is not required under the
SDWA. Private wells are shallower than public wells, and
shallow wells are more vulnerable to nitrate contamin-
ation [49]. They are also more likely to be located in rural
areas and may be in closer proximity to agriculture and
livestock production sources. Private well owners are usu-
ally not required to test for nitrate or other drinking water
contaminants, so their presence may go undetected.
Among nearly 4000 private wells tested in rural Wisconsin
by a state water quality laboratory, nearly 10% exceeded
the nitrate MCL [50]. There is evidence of environmental
justice disparities in communities using private wells or
lacking piped-water entirely. A review by VanDerslice [41]
summarized case studies of minority communities reliant
on
contaminated
private
wells.
For
instance,
in
a
low-income Hispanic community of 25,000 in the Yakima
Valley in Washington State, more than 10% of private
wells exceeded the nitrate MCL [51]. These case studies
are further evidence of impaired water quality in commu-
nities reliant on private wells and indicate potential socio-
economic disparities in these communities as well.
Conclusions
This study represents the first nationwide analysis of
socioeconomic disparities in exposures to drinking water
contaminants, and the framework that we developed in
this study can be extended to investigate disparities in ex-
posures to other drinking water contaminants. We found
that communities with higher proportions of Hispanic res-
idents tend to be served by community water systems with
higher nitrate and greater likelihood of being over 5 mg/L.
Our regression analyses indicate that this association is
not completely explained by proximity to cropland and
livestock production. While > 99% of CWSs do not exceed
the nitrate MCL of 10 mg/L, 5.6 million Americans
are served by CWSs with nitrate concentrations above
5 mg/L. Nitrate data for private wells, which are even
more vulnerable to nitrate contamination, are lacking. Un-
derstanding the extent of current exposures, particularly
among vulnerable subpopulations, is critical for develop-
ing effective strategies to reduce exposures in these com-
munities. Our findings suggest that programs intended to
help low-income and small CWSs may not be adequately
assisting communities with high proportions of Hispanic
residents. Epidemiological evidence for adverse health ef-
fects associated with consumption of drinking water above
5 mg/L nitrate raise concerns about increased risk in
people exposed at this level and support a re-evaluation of
the federal nitrate standard. Even well below the standard,
nitrate levels of 1 mg/L or higher are associated with
anthropogenic impact; thus nitrate may be an inexpensive
indicator to identify drinking water systems that may also
contain other contaminants of concern.
