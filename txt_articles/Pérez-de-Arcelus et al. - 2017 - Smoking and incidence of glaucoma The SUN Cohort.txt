Abstract
Smoking is a serious global public health concern that has been related to many chronic diseases. However, the effect of smoking on
eye disorders has been less studied. The aim of this cohort study was to assess the association between current tobacco smokers
and the risk of developing glaucoma and furthermore to evaluate the relationship between passive or former smokers and glaucoma.
In this prospective and dynamic cohort, 16,797 participants initially who were found not to have glaucoma were followed up for a
median of 8.5 years. Validated data on lifestyle, including tobacco consumption, were assessed at baseline. Information about new
diagnosis of glaucoma was collected by follow-up questionnaires every 2 years. The outcome was the incidence of self-reported
glaucoma during the follow-up. A subsample was used to validate the glaucoma diagnosis.
During the 8.5 years of follow-up, 184 new glaucoma cases were identified. Current smokers had a significantly higher risk of
glaucoma compared to participants who had never smoked after controlling for potential confounders (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.88 [95%
coefficient interval (CI): 1.26–2.81]; P=0.002). A nonsignificant increased risk was found among former smokers (HR 1.27 [95% CI:
0.88–1.82]; P=0.198). When we assessed the exposure as per the number of cigarette pack-years, a dose–response relationship
between pack-years and the risk of glaucoma was found (HR for the 5th quintile versus the 1st quintile: 1.70 [95% IC: 1.10–2.64],
P for trend, 0.009). However, no relationship was found between passive smokers and glaucoma. (HR 0.67 [95% CI: 0.37–1.21];
P=0.189).
Our results suggest a direct association between current smokers and the incidence of glaucoma. In particular, this association
was related to the number of pack-years, which was not found in the case of former smokers nor in the case of passive smokers.

1. Introduction
According to the World Health Organization, smoking has
become a serious problem for public health. Among the
approximately 1.3 billion smokers in the world, over 6 million
die annually due to tobacco exposure.[1] Although the effect of
smoking on eye disorders has been less studied than the smoking
effects on cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other major
noncommunicable disease, in some studies, cigarette smoking
has been related to several eye diseases such as glaucoma.[2–4]
Glaucoma includes a group of disorders characterized by
progressive deterioration of the optic nerve associated with loss
of the field of vision. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG),
which affects 60 million people all over the world,[5] is the most
prevalent form of that disease.[5] It is the 2nd-leading cause of
blindness worldwide and the major cause of irreversible
blindness. Currently, the only well established modifiable risk
factor is an elevated intraocular pressure (IOP),[6–8] but its
pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Many investigators
believe that POAG has a vascular origin due to a compromised
blood flow to the optic nerve head,[9] and it is known that
cigarette smoking contributes to vascular disease by occluding
arterial
lumina
with
atherosclerotic
plaques
and
intimal
thickening.[10] In addition, trabecular meshwork cells (TMC)
and retinal ganglion cells (RGC) damage, involving inflammation
and apoptosis mechanisms, has been proven in glaucoma, and it
has been demonstrated how smoking can cause high oxidative
stress because of oxidizing agents that produce free radicals.[11]

 Consequently, smoking might be involved in the pathogenesis of
POAG, along with other risk factors.
In contrast to the already known risk factors for POAG, such as
advanced age, a family history of glaucoma and African ethnicity,
tobacco smoking is a modifiable risk factor. This is important
because it gives us the possibility to control the disease, at least
partially, through modifying habits. This idea would support
existing public health efforts toward reinforcing no-smoking
campaigns. However, existing data on the association between
tobacco smoking and glaucoma are controversial.[12,13] A recent
systematic review concluded that heavy smoking may increase the
riskofPOAG,eventhoughtheauthorsindicatedthatfuturestudies
that will specifically assess the number of pack-years were still
needed.[14] Thus, our aim was to evaluate the association between
tobacco smoking and the risk of developing glaucoma in the
Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study population
The SUN study is a multipurpose dynamic Spanish cohort of
university graduates. The study methods have been previously
published in detail in other papers.[15] In summary though,
information about both exposure and outcome was gathered by
mailed questionnaires collected biennially. People who do not
reply to follow-up questionnaires are sent up to 5 additional
mailings. The recruitment of participants started in December
1999 and it is still on-going. The overall follow-up rate is 89.2%.
Before September 2011, 20,878 participants had answered the
baseline questionnaire and were included in the sample. A total of
4081 participants were excluded for different reasons: 1742
participants because contact was lost before follow-up, 1794
participants because they had a total energy intake that fell
outside of the predefined limits (<800 or >4000kcal/day for
men, and <500 or >3500kcal/day for women),[16] 442 due to the
absence of information about tobacco smoking, and 103 due to
prevalent glaucoma. Thus, the final sample size for the analyses
included 16,797 participants (Fig. 1).
The study was approved by the Human Research Ethical
Committee at the University of Navarra. Voluntary completion
of the 1st questionnaire was considered to imply informed
consent.
2.2. Smoking assessment
Smoking information was assessed in the baseline questionnaire.
Information about smoking status was gathered by means of the
question: “have you smoked 100 or more cigarettes in your life?”
and it was ascertained whether the participants were former,
current, or nonsmokers. Those participants who answered
positively were asked for the mean number of cigarettes
consumed per day at some specific periods of their life. Besides,
former smokers were asked how long ago they gave up smoking.
The number of pack-years consumed by the smokers in the
cohort was estimated using this information. We used the pack-
years definition according to the National Cancer Institute
Dictionary of Cancer Terms; pack-years were calculated by
multiplying the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day by
the number of years the person has smoked. For example, 1 pack
year is equal to smoking 1 pack per day for 1 year, or 2 packs per
day for half a year, and so on. No other tobacco characteristics
such as type, quality, filter, or nicotine content were evaluated.
Passive smokers were defined as people that answer positively
to the question: “Have you lived or worked with a smoker in the
same room for more than a year?” No other variables were taken
into account in this analysis.
2.3. Dietary exposure assessment
The dietary exposure was ascertained through a 136-item
semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire previously vali-
dated in Spain.[17] Food consumption was calculated as the self-
reported frequency of food items multiplied by the nutrient
composition of specified portion sizes where frequencies were
measured in 9 categories (never or almost never, 1–3times/
month, once/week, 2–4times/week, 5–6times/week, once/day,
2–3time/7day, 4–6times/day, and 6+ times/day) for each food
item. Nutrient intake scores were computed using a bespoke
computer program specifically developed for this aim. A trained
dietitian updated the nutrient data bank using the latest available
information included in food composition tables for Spain.[18,19]
2.4. Assessment of other covariates
The baseline assessment also included other questions (totaling
46 items for men and 54 items for women). Sociodemographic
(eg, gender, age, marital status, and employment status),
anthropometric (eg, weight and height), lifestyle and health-
related
habits
(eg,
physical
activity
during
leisure
time),
psychological
characteristics
(eg,
self-perceived
personality
traits), and medical history (eg, prevalence of chronic diseases
and medication use) variables were collected.
The validated physical activity questionnaire included infor-
mation about 17 activities.[20] To quantify the volume of activity
during leisure time, an activity metabolic equivalent (MET) index
was computed by assigning a multiple of the resting metabolic
rate (MET score) to each activity, and the time spent on each of

 the activities was multiplied by the MET score specific to each
activity, and then all activities were added up to obtain a value for
the overall weekly MET-h.[21]
Body mass index (BMI), defined as weight (kg) divided by the
square of height (m2), was computed using self-reported
information on weight and height from the baseline question-
naire. Validity of self-reported weight has been assessed in a
subsample of the cohort.[22]
2.5. Outcome assessment
Glaucoma was assessed by means of a question included in the
follow-up questionnaires. Participants responded to the question:
“Have you ever been diagnosed with glaucoma by a health
professional?” The question also specified the date of diagnosis.
The validity of a self-reported diagnosis of glaucoma in our
cohort is supported in part by the high educational level and
strong motivation of this cohort. Moreover, more than 50%
of the participants in the cohort are health professionals with a
good medical knowledge. However, the validity of self-reported
glaucoma diagnosis was also assessed in a subsample of our
cohort. The diagnosis of glaucoma was evaluated by an
experienced ophthalmologist without having seen the answers
to the questionnaires. This validation study showed an adequate
validity of the self-reported diagnosis of glaucoma: the Kappa
value was 0.85 (95% coefficient interval [CI], 0.834–0.872). The
sensitivity was 0.83 and the specificity 0.99.
2.6. Statistical analysis
Cox regression models were fit to assess the relationship between
smoking status (never/former/current smoker) or cigarette pack-
years and the incidence of glaucoma. Hazard ratios (HRs) and
their 95% CI were calculated considering the never smoker status
as the reference category. Participants contributed to the follow-
up period up to the date of return of their last questionnaire,
death, or diagnosis of glaucoma, whichever came first.
Potential confounders included as covariates in the multiple
Cox models were age, sex, body mass index (kg/m2), omega 3:
omega 6 ratio (quintiles), hypertension, type 2 diabetes, physical
activity (tertiles), coffee consumption (4 categories), alcohol
intake (quintiles), and adherence to the Mediterranean diet.
All P values presented are 2-tailed; P<0.05 was considered a
priori as statistically significant. All analyses were performed with
STATA/SE 13.1 software (College Station, TX: StataCorp LP).
3. Results
During the follow-up period (median 8.5 years), 184 incident
cases of glaucoma were identified from a total number of 144,313
person-years.
Baseline characteristics of the participants according to
smoking status are presented in Table 1. The mean age of
participants was 39 years (SD: 12). We included in our analyses
7920 nonsmokers, 3729 former smokers, and 5160 current
smokers. Current smokers were more likely to report coffee and
alcohol consumption, higher adherence to the traditional
Mediterranean dietary pattern, and were also more likely to
have hypertension and diabetes. Former smokers were older and
the proportion of men was higher in this category.
Current smokers showed a significant higher risk of developing
glaucoma
compared
to
nonsmokers
after
controlling
for
potential confounders (HR 1.88 [95% CI: 1.26–2.81]; P=
0.002). Besides, former smokers had a nonsignificant higher risk
of developing glaucoma compared with never-smokers in the
multiple-adjusted model (HR 1.27 [95% CI: 0.88–1.82]; P=
0.198) (Table 2).
When the exposition was assessed per number of cigarette
pack-years consumed, we found a dose–response relationship
which supports that the risk of developing glaucoma increased
monotonically with the number of pack-years consumed. As
presented in Table 3, participants in the 5th quintile of
cumulative exposure to smoking (>20.5 pack-years) showed a

Passive smokers, noncurrent and nonformer smokers (n=

4. Discussion
In this large prospective study, we found that current smoking
was significantly associated with the risk of developing glaucoma
and that this association was even stronger among heavy
smokers. To our knowledge, there are only a limited number of
studies that have analyzed the association between smoking and
the incidence of glaucoma, and furthermore, their conclusions are
controversial.[23–31] Most of the results come largely from
case–control
studies,
yielding
both
positive[14,23–27]
and
null[28–31] associations. In a cohort of African-American women,
Wise et al[32] reported that smoking might be associated with an
increased risk of early-onset POAG, but the results did not reach
statistical significance (P=0.28). In contrast, a prospective
follow-up study of Female Nurses from 1980 to 1996 and
Health Professionals from 1986 to 1996 showed that neither
current smokers nor former smokers were at greater risk of
developing POAG than those who had never smoked, and that
heavier smoking did not increase the risk of POAG.[12] It is
noteworthy that most studies did not consider the number of
pack-years smoked. In a case–control study, POAG was
associated with heavy smoking (40 pack-years or more, OR=
3.93, 95% CI: 1.12–13.80, P=0.03) but not with moderate
(20–40 pack-years) or light smoking (<20 pack-years).[33] On the
contrary, in the Nurses’ Health Study and in the Health
Professionals Follow-Up Study, Kang et al[12] found a borderline
significant inverse dose effect association only among former
smokers. In a recent systematic review, the authors indicated that
recent studies suggest that heavy smoking may increase the risk of
POAG.[14]
Two meta-analyses have been published about this relation-
ship. Bonovas et al[34] found that current smoking resulted in a
significant increase in the risk of POAG (odds ratio [OR]=1.37,
95% CI: 1.00–1.87), while past smoking history did not appear
to affect that risk (OR=1.03, 95% CI: 0.77–1.38). The analysis
included 4 cross-sectional and 3 case–control studies, published
during the period leading up to December 2002. The summary
OR from a fixed-effects model were 1.37 (95% CI: 1.00–1.87) for
current smokers and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.77–1.38) for former
smokers. Conversely, other recent meta-analysis did not find this
relationship between smoking and glaucoma.[35] Zhou et al[35]
found that both current smokers and former smokers were not
significantly associated with the risk of POAG. The Zhou meta-
analysis included 6 observational studies (3 cohort and 3
case–control studies) from 1 January 1966 to 1 December 2015.
The summary relative risk for current smokers was 0.97 (95%
CI: 0.81–1.16, P=0.74; I2=38%), and for former smokers it
was also 0.97 (95% CI: 0.83–1.13, P=0.66; I2=46%). These
different results indicated that the relationship between smoking
and glaucoma is controversial and related to the studies included
in each meta-analysis.
The mechanistic action of smoking and whether this could
induce glaucoma is not clear and only partially known. Wang
et al[36] suggest that smoking alters the biosynthesis of collagen
and
extracellular
matrix
turnover,
and
decreases
corneal
thickness, which is a risk factor for POAG.[36] Smoking has
been reported to decrease the production of oxygen and collagen
in tissues during wound healing,[37,38] deteriorating the ocular
hypoxia.[36] Zanon-Moreno et al[39] suggest that smoking
liberates free radicals that cause damage in the trabecular
meshwork, consequently decreasing the outflow of the aqueous
humor. Moreover, the mechanism associated with vasoconstric-
tion of the episcleral veins can reduce the aqueous outflow.[40]
Another plausible mechanism might be related with inflamma-
tion and apoptosis. An experimental study[39] that analyzed
aqueous humor and plasma samples of 120 women with POAG
found that the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), as an inflammation
marker, and the expression of caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose
polymerase 1 (PARP-1), as apoptosis markers, were significantly
higher in current smokers than in former- and nonsmokers (P<
0.05). These data may suggest that smoking could induce the
expression of inflammatory and apoptosis markers in patients
with glaucoma. Since experimental studies in human[41] and
animal models[42] have shown that trabecular meshwork cells
and retinal ganglion cells die by apoptosis in glaucoma, it could
be argued that the increase of apoptotic and inflammation
markers due to smoking in patients with POAG may contribute
to the progression of the disease.[39] A biological mechanism
might be related to the ischemia caused by tobacco smoking,
which is considered a major risk factor in most ischemic disorders
of the eye,[40] as it has been suggested by different experimental
studies that showed the deleterious effect the tobacco smoking
has on ocular blood flow.[9,43] Consequently, since many
researchers believe that POAG has a vascular origin based on
a compromised blood flow to the optic nerve head,[44] smoking
may be involved in the pathogenesis of POAG.
Our study has some important strengths. First, its prospective
design implies that information about smoking and other risk

 factors for glaucoma was obtained before the diagnosis of the
disease. Besides, the control of a wide variety of potential
confounders was considered prospectively, avoiding the possi-
bility of inverse causation bias, which is a frequent phenomenon
in cross-sectional studies. Other advantage is the validation of the
diagnosis of glaucoma in a subsample of these participants, as
well as the large sample size and the follow-up period (a median
of 8.5 years). In addition, both risk factors, namely exposure and
outcome, were ascertained through validated questionnaires.
Regarding the validity of outcome ascertainment, abundant
evidence indicates that self-reported information is valid in our
cohort.[20,45–47] However, there are some limitations in our
study. Although some degree of misclassification is likely to exist,
it is expected to be nondifferential and therefore, to drive the
association toward the null value. Our participants did not
undergo a systematic ophthalmologic examination to discard the
occurrence of glaucoma during follow-up. Some new-onset cases
may have been missed leading to a reduced sensitivity. However,
theoretically, with perfect specificity, nondifferential sensitivity of
disease misclassification will not bias the relative risk estimate.[48]
On the other hand, the fact that the cohort recruits mostly
university graduates could induce a selection bias. Nonetheless,
50% of our group is composed of health professionals who have
access to relevant and accurate information about glaucoma
characteristics. Also, this decision is convenient and methodo-
logically adequate in order to better control several other
potential biases related to confounding by economic or socio-
demographic factors. The method that we applied (ie, restriction)
is an excellent technique in epidemiology to prevent these
potential sources of confounding since we avoided economic or
socio-demographic heterogeneity. Also, we did not separately
identify the passive smokers and hence they were included in the
nonsmokers group, rendering it impossible to analyze the group
of passive smokers in this cohort.
Another specific limitation is that we could not determine the
type of glaucoma. However, in the validated subsample of
participants all glaucomatous cases were open-angle glaucoma.
Also, other outcomes that have been previously validated within
the SUN Project have shown good validity.[20,46,49] Another
limitation was that the majority of the participants in our sample
are Caucasian. This implies that our results may have limits in
their extrapolation to populations with higher percentages of
minorities, particularly those of African or Caribbean heritage,
who are at greater risk of glaucoma.[7,50]
In conclusion, in this prospective study we found that current
smoking status is associated with a higher risk of developing
glaucoma, even though the same association for former smokers
or for passive smokers is not clear. In addition, we found a
dose–response relationship that demonstrates that the risk of
glaucoma increases as the number of cigarette pack-years increases.
Nevertheless, further cohorts studies with larger samples of older
participants are needed in order to confirm this association.
