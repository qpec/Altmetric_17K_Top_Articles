Background-—Population-based studies have revealed declining acute ischemic stroke (AIS) hospitalization rates in the United
States, but no study has assessed recent temporal trends in race/ethnic-, age-, and sex-specific AIS hospitalization rates.
Methods and Results-—Temporal trends in hospitalization for AIS from 2000 to 2010 were assessed among adults ≥25 years
using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnic-specific and age-adjusted stroke hospitalization rates were
calculated using the weighted number of hospitalizations and US census data. From 2000 to 2010, age-adjusted stroke
hospitalization rates decreased from 250 to 204 per 100 000 (overall rate reduction 18.4%). Age-specific AIS hospitalization rates
decreased for individuals aged 65 to 84 years (846 to 605 per 100 000) and ≥85 years (2077 to 1618 per 100 000), but
increased for individuals aged 25 to 44 years (16 to 23 per 100 000) and 45 to 64 years (149 to 156 per 100 000). Blacks had
the highest age-adjusted yearly hospitalization rates, followed by Hispanics and whites (358, 170, and 155 per 100 000 in 2010).
Age-adjusted AIS hospitalization rates increased for blacks but decreased for Hispanics and whites. Age-adjusted AIS
hospitalization rates were lower in women and declined more steeply compared to men (272 to 212 per 100 000 in women versus
298 to 245 per 100 000 in men).
Conclusions-—Although overall stroke hospitalizations declined in the United States, the reduction was more pronounced among
older individuals, women, Hispanics, and whites. Renewed efforts at targeting risk factor control among vulnerable individuals may
be warranted. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e003233 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.116.003233)

S
tudies have shown a recent decline in stroke as a cause
of hospitalization and death.1–5 The declines have not
been uniform across the US population; however, and certain
subgroups have experienced more profound improvements in
incidence and outcomes than others. Racial/ethnic disparities
in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) hospitalizations have been well
described for specific populations in the United States.
Multiple studies in the 1990s and 2000s revealed high black–
white disparities, with AIS hospitalization rates 1.5 to 2.5
times higher in blacks.6–9 The disparity was less pronounced
between Hispanics and whites. In the Northern Manhattan
population, AIS hospitalization rates for mainly Caribbean
Hispanics were 1.7 times higher8 than whites and in a mainly
Mexican community in Texas, 1.2 times higher than whites.10
In Florida, on the other hand, AIS hospitalization rates among
a heterogeneous Hispanic population of Cubans, Puerto
Ricans, Mexicans, and South Americans were 30% lower than
whites.9
Numerous studies have shown that men have higher
stroke incidence than women in younger and middle-age
groups, but these differences narrow in older age groups and
reverse in the elderly.11–16 Recent studies have suggested
declining stroke incidence in both men and women. An
analysis of data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey
revealed that age-adjusted stroke hospitalization rates from
1988 to 2004 decreased in both men and women, a decline
driven by individuals 65 years and older.17 A separate
analysis using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample
(NIS) revealed that from 1997 to 2006, US stroke hospital-
ization rates decreased for both men and women aged 35 to
64 years.18
In recent years, stroke incidence and hospitalizations have
increased among younger individuals. From 1998 to 2007, US
stroke hospitalizations increased among those 25 to 34 years
and 35 to 44 years old.5 Similarly, a study in the greater

 Cincinnati northern Kentucky region revealed that from 1993
to 2005, stroke hospitalization rates increased among both
whites and blacks younger than 55 years.19
The aims of this study were to (1) describe the hospital-
ization rates for AIS in the United States and (2) assess trends
in race/ethnic-, age-, and sex-specific rates of hospitalization
between 2000 and 2010.
Methods
We analyzed data from the NIS, the largest publicly available
all-payer inpatient care database in the United States. The NIS
contains data from �8 million de-identified hospital stays a
year and approximates a 20% stratified sample of nonfederal
US hospitals.20 The majority (≥97%) of the hospitals in the
United States are nonfederal and include government hospi-
tals operated by the city, county, and state, as well as
hospitals operated by for-profit and nonprofit organizations.
The database sampling strategy allows for extrapolation from
the sample to represent all US hospitalizations nationwide,
using sampling weights. The database is maintained by the
National Healthcare Cost Utilization Project of the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality. Detailed information on the
design of the NIS is available at www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov. The
study qualified for IRB waiver.
Discharge data was obtained from January 1, 2000 and
through December 31, 2010. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) was
defined by the International Classification of Diseases, 9th
revision primary discharge diagnosis codes for ischemic
stroke (433.01, 433.11, 433.21, 433.31, 433.81, 433.91,
434.01, 434.11, 434.91, 436),21 which have a high specificity
and positive predictive value for the diagnosis of AIS.22,23 The
total number of AIS admissions for adults ≥25 years of age
was estimated using SAS 9.4 PROC SURVEYMEANS by
accounting for sampling weight to reflect the overall US
population. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnic-specific AIS hospital-
ization rates were calculated using the weighted number of
hospitalizations as the numerator and the US civilian popu-
lation as the denominator. Yearly rate comparisons across
years were standardized with the age distribution of the US
population in 2000. For comparison across year and sex, all
rates were standardized with the age distribution of the US
female population in 2000, while for comparison across year
and race, all rates are were standardized with the age
distribution of the US white population in 2000. Since the
data used are population data, the average rate of change is
the average of the percent change from the prior year across
all years after 2000.
Results
Overall, the age-adjusted AIS hospitalization rate in the United
States decreased from 250 to 204 per 100 000 from 2000
through
2010
(overall
rate
reduction
18.4%)
(Table 1;
Figure 1). The majority of the rate decline occurred from
2000 to 2005 (average rate of change �3.89%/year) and
plateaued from 2006 to 2010 (�0.03%/year). The decline in
AIS hospitalizations was driven by the ≥65-year age group.
Age-specific AIS hospitalization rates from 2000 to 2010
decreased for individuals aged 65 to 84 years (846 to 605 per
100 000, �28.5%) and 85 years and over (2077 to 1618 per
100 000, �22.1%), but increased for individuals aged 25 to

(149 to 156 per 100 000, +4.7%) (Figure 2).
Blacks had the highest age-adjusted yearly hospitalization
rates, followed by Hispanics and whites (358, 170, and 155
per 100 000 in 2010). From 2000 to 2010, age-adjusted AIS
hospitalization rates decreased for both Hispanics (�21.7%)
and whites (�12.4%), but increased for blacks (+13.7%). The
increase in blacks was driven by a sharp rise in rates in the
latter half of the decade (�6.31%/year from 2000 to 2005,
+11.16%/year from 2006 to 2010). Hospitalization rates also
increased for whites from 2006 to 2010 (+2.99%/year). The

 with the majority of the decline occurring in the first 5 years.
Age-specific AIS hospitalization rates increased among indi-
viduals younger than 65 years, while decreasing among those
older than 65 years. Blacks had the highest age-adjusted
yearly hospitalization rates, followed by Hispanics and whites.
From 2000 to 2010, age-adjusted AIS hospitalization rates
decreased in Hispanics and whites, but increased for blacks.
Age-adjusted AIS hospitalization rates were lower in women
than men throughout the time period and women experienced
a greater rate of decline than men from 2000 to 2010.
Comorbidity
Scores
in
patients
hospitalized
from
AIS
increased from 2000 to 2010 while in-hospital deaths
decreased.
The decline in AIS hospitalization from 2000 to 2010
followed a similar decline noted from 1997 to 2004 in Fang
et al’s analysis of stroke hospitalizations using the National
Hospital Discharge Survey17 and from 1998 to 2007 in Lee
et al’s analysis using data from the National Inpatient
Sample.5 Our analysis uniquely demonstrated a plateau in
the latter half of the decade.
Our findings should be interpreted with caution, since
changes in stroke hospitalization rates are affected not only
by true changes in incidence, but also stroke literacy and
health beliefs (influencing likelihood of seeking medical
attention), prehospital recognition and triage of patients with
stroke symptoms, and hospital protocols/healthcare provider
literacy (affecting the likelihood of hospitalizing individuals
with stroke symptoms). In addition, the new imaging-based
definition of transient ischemic attack24 and more widespread
use of magnetic resonance imaging may also affect the
proportion of individuals coded as transient ischemic attack
versus AIS.
Nevertheless, the decline in stroke hospitalization rates
could reflect reduced incidence, possibly due to cardiovascu-
lar prevention efforts, which have led to improved blood
pressure and cholesterol treatment and control.25–28 The
decline in in-hospital deaths despite increased Comorbidity
Scores may reflect improved acute hospital care. The plateau
from 2005 to 2010 could reflect either a threshold beyond
which our current prevention efforts are no longer having an
effect versus the various factors aforementioned.
Our findings are consistent with prior studies demonstrat-
ing higher AIS hospitalizations in blacks and Hispanics
compared to whites.6,8–10,29 AIS hospitalization rates were
greatest in blacks throughout the decade, and in 2010 were
more than double the hospitalization rates of both whites and
Hispanics. We have uniquely shown that over the study
period, blacks exhibited increasing AIS hospitalization rates,
driven by the rising rates in the latter half of the decade.
Whites and Hispanics exhibited declines in AIS hospitalization
rates; however, rates for whites slowly rose in the latter half of
the decade as well. Differences in AIS hospitalization rates
lessened between Hispanics and whites from 2000 to 2010
and increased between blacks and whites between 2000 and
2010.
Prior studies have shown disparities in stroke rates in
mostly biracial populations comparing blacks to whites or
Hispanics to whites; however, few studies have compared
stroke hospitalization rates in multiracial populations. AIS
rates were 2-fold greater in young black versus white women
and men in Baltimore County,29 higher in blacks compared to
whites in the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke
Study,6 and higher in Mexican Americans compared to non-
Hispanic whites in the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus
Christi Project.10 Data from the Northern Manhattan Stroke
Study showed that the annual incidence of first AIS from 1993
to 1997 was greatest in blacks, followed by Hispanics (mainly
of Caribbean origin) and whites.8 The age-adjusted AIS
hospitalization rates in Florida for individuals aged 25 to
49 years was greatest in blacks, followed by whites, then
Hispanics (mainly Cuban, Puerto Rican, Mexican, and South
Americans in origin) regardless of sex.9
With regard to sex-specific AIS hospitalization rates, our
findings of a lower age-adjusted AIS hospitalization rates in
women compared to men in the United States is consistent
with prior studies.6,9,17,30–32
We found that AIS hospitalization rates decreased over 2%
per year among individuals over 65 years, but increased
among younger individuals. Among younger individuals, we
cannot rule out that changes were due to chance since the
number of events was small. Our findings are consistent with
age-specific data showing increasing incidence of stroke in
the young in the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky
Stroke Study19 and Lee et al’s previous NIS analysis.5 Data
from the National Hospital Discharge Survey from 1997 to
2004, on the other hand, corroborated our findings of lower
AIS hospitalization rates among individuals over 65 years, but
did not show changes in AIS hospitalization rates among
individuals younger than 65 years.17
There are several limitations to the present study. First,
this is an observational study; therefore, one cannot assume
causal relationships. This data set, however, is useful for
analyzing nationwide temporal trends.33 Second, as with any
administrative data set, there exists the possibility of coding
errors, including miscoding a transient ischemic attack as
AIS.22 Third, due to differences in race/ethnic categories in
NIS versus the census data, AIS rates are underestimated in
Hispanics (due to an inflated denominator when estimating
the rate). According to census data, Hispanic (ethnicity) and
race are separate measurements. Thus, a person can be
classified as both Hispanic and white. The population reported
under Hispanics includes Hispanic white, Hispanic black, and
Hispanic Asian. In NIS data, however, race and ethnicity are
combined; thus, individuals are Latino or other race. Finally,

 we were not able to verify diagnoses, determine ischemic
stroke subtype, or stroke severity. Despite these limitations,
the study has several strengths including a large sample size,
nationwide representation, and clinician-based diagnosis of
AIS. Further research is required to determine the causes of
the
disparate
hospitalization
rates,
to
better
ascertain
nationwide race/ethnic-, sex-, and age-specific trends in
incidence, and to identify strategies to target subgroup
populations who are most vulnerable.
