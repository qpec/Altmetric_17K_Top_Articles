Abstract
Objectives—To assess the associations between occupational exposure to biocides and 
pesticides and risk of thyroid cancer.
Methods—Using data from a population-based case-control study involving 462 incident thyroid 
cancer cases and 498 controls in Connecticut collected in 2010–2011, we examined the association 
with occupational exposure to biocides and pesticides through a job-exposure matrix. We used 
unconditional logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (95% CI), adjusting for potential confounders.
Results—Individuals who were occupationally ever exposed to biocides had an increased risk of 
thyroid cancer (OR=1.65, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.35), and the highest risk was observed for the high 
cumulative probability of exposure (OR=2.18, 95%CI: 1.28–3.73). The observed associations 
were similar when we restricted to papillary thyroid cancer and well-differentiated thyroid cancer.

 Stronger associations were observed for thyroid microcarcinomas (tumor size ≤1cm). No 
significant association was observed for occupational exposure to pesticides.

BACKGROUND
Over the past decades, thyroid cancer incidence has increased considerably worldwide.1–3 In 
the United States, the average annual increase in thyroid cancer incidence rate was 5% over 
the last 10 years.4 It is now the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in the 
United States. The reasons for growing thyroid cancer incidence have been highly debated. 
Recent evidence suggests that “over-diagnosis” may be responsible for about half of the 
increase.56 Nevertheless, increased thyroid cancer incidence across all tumor sizes suggests 
that increased diagnostic scrutiny is not the sole explanation, and other explanations, 
including environmental exposures, should be investigated.37 According to the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer, carcinogenic agents for thyroid cancer with sufficient 
evidence in humans are radioiodine (including Iodine-131), X-radiation, and gamma-
radiation.8 However, many thyroid cancers cannot be explained by ionizing radiation 
exposure.59
Research on occupational risk factors for thyroid cancer has been limited for exposures other 
than radiation and has predominantly occurred in population-based studies (e.g., case-
control studies, registry-based cohorts) to obtain sufficient thyroid cancer cases. In a recent 
review of these studies, suggestive, but inconsistent, associations with thyroid cancer risk 
were observed in studies of pesticide-exposed workers, agricultural workers, and agricultural 
occupations, but no consistent associations were observed for other chemical exposures.10 
Our recent study suggested an increased risk of thyroid cancer associated with working as 
building cleaners and pest control workers.11 These studies have been hampered by too few 
exposed cases and evaluations have been based primarily on occupational group. Only one 
study used a job-exposure matrix (JEM) to assess exposure.12 A JEM links information from 
both job titles and industry types with specific exposures, providing a mechanism to evaluate 
exposures that may occur in multiple occupations or industries. This can significantly 
increase the statistical power compared with use of job or industrial titles.13
While currently no chemical substance has been consistently associated with thyroid cancer 
in humans, accidental or occupational exposures to high levels of some chemicals may cause 
mild changes in the thyroid.1014 Thyroid gland anomalies have been associated with many 
chemicals and solvents found in the workplace such as organochlorine pesticides, 
polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, hexachlorobenzene, phthalates, 
polyhydroxyphenols/phenol derivatives, dioxins, and anions including perchlorate and 
nitrate1014–18. In addition, emerging evidence from animal studies has demonstrated that 
drinking water disinfectants (i.e., chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and monochloramine) decreases

 thyroid hormone levels in pigeons and rabbits.1920 Experimental studies have also 
documented that triclosan, a chlorinated phenolic antibacterial compound agent used in a 
variety of personal care and industrial products, decreases thyroid hormones in various 
laboratory animals.21–24
To fill the knowledge gap between occupational risk factors for thyroid cancer, we analyzed 
data from a population-based case-control study in Connecticut using exposure estimates for 
pesticides and biocides obtained from CANJEM.25 CANJEM is a JEM developed for North 
American populations (www.canjem.ca). Pesticides refer to a diverse group of chemicals 
used in agricultural, commercial, and home settings to control insects, fungi, and weeds,26 
which have had mixed results in previous studies of thyroid cancer risk.27–34 Biocides are 
chemicals used to disinfect, deodorize, sterilize, and sanitize, and have not been previously 
evaluated in thyroid cancer studies. Biocides includes bactericides, algicides, fungicides, 
germicides, and preservatives.25
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
A population-based case–control study was conducted in Connecticut in 2010–2011.9 
Eligible patients were aged more than 20 years old at diagnosis, had no previous diagnosis 
of cancer, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer, and were alive at the time of 
interview. Cases were identified through the Yale Cancer Center’s Rapid Case 
Ascertainment Shared Resource (RCA), which functions as a field arm of the Connecticut 
Tumor Registry. Cases were histologically confirmed, incident thyroid cancer patients from 
Connecticut, diagnosed in 2010 and 2011. Population-based controls with Connecticut 
addresses were recruited using a random digit dialing method. Controls were frequency 
matched to cases within 5-year age groups. All procedures were performed in accordance 
with a protocol approved by the Human Investigations Committee at Yale and the 
Connecticut Department of Public Health. After approval by the hospitals and by each 
participant’s physician (cancer cases), or after selection through random sampling (control 
population), potential participants were approached by letter and then over the phone. Those 
who agreed were interviewed by trained study interviewers, either at their homes or at a 
convenient location. A total of 701 eligible thyroid cancer cases were identified during the 
study period, with 462 (65.9%) completing in-person interviews. A total of 498 control 
individuals participated in the study, with a participation rate of 61.5%. After obtaining 
written consent, a standardized, structured questionnaire was used to collect information on 
demographics, medical history, smoking and alcohol consumption, physical activity, lifetime 
occupational history, and diet.
Occupational Exposure Assessment
Participants were asked to report all jobs held for one year or longer during their lifetime. 
For each reported type of occupation, detailed information was elicited on job title, activities 
or duties, company name, type of industry, year began, and year ended. Occupations were 
coded according to the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) Manual by 
incorporating the information about job title, industry type, and specific duties.35 Exposures

 to biocides or pesticides were each assessed separately by linking each 6-digit SOC code to 
the CANJEM. If a 6-digit SOC code could not be linked to the CANJEM, the next most 
detailed level (e.g., 5-digit or 3-digit) was used for exposure estimates.
CANJEM is a general population job-exposure matrix created from a database of expert 
assessments performed during four community-based case-control studies of cancer (lung, 
breast, brain, and multisite) conducted in Montreal since the 1980s.25 CANJEM is based on 
information derived from expert retrospective exposure assessments conducted on over 6000 
men and 2500 women, totaling more than 30000 individual jobs held between 1931 and 
2005, representing approximately 50 expert-years of exposure assessment. For the purpose 
of this analysis, a version of CANJEM based on the SOC system was used, with exposure 
estimates available for 3, 5 and 6-digit SOC codes. The JEM was produced for 2 agents 
“pesticides” and “biocides”, defined by the experts as follows. Pesticides are substances 
capable of killing some form of organism that is deemed to be undesirable. Pesticides 
include insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides, fungicides, molluscicides and nematodicides. 
Farming is the main occupation in which pesticides are used in large quantities, and are 
likely to be handled in an unsafe manner. Biocides include all products used to disinfect, 
deodorize, sterilize and sanitize. This implies the capability of killing micro-organisms 
(algae, bacteria, viruses, etc.). This group therefore includes bactericides, algicides, 
fungicides, germicides and preservatives.
The CANJEM exposure metrics used in this study include probability of exposure and 
frequency weighted intensity (FWI) of exposure. Probability of exposure represents the 
proportion of jobs deemed exposed within a matrix-cell (i.e., an occupational code in this 
case, 6, 5, or 3 digits). FWI combines measures of intensity (low, medium, high) and 
frequency of exposure (hours per week) in the original studies into a quantitative metric 
representing time weighted average exposure. For the calculations, the experts considered 
that low, medium, and high levels of intensity corresponded approximately to relative 
absolute values of 1, 5, and 25. This varied from agent to agent but these weights were 
thought to represent the best overall estimate of the ratios for the three intensity categories 
across the 258 CANJEM agents. In a previous investigation comparing different JEMs, 
exposure estimates derived from using alternative weighting scales, including the 1–5–25 
scale and others (namely 1–2–3, 1–3–9, 1–10–100) were compared; the choice of scale 
within that range did not greatly influence the results.36 Final FWI of exposure for a matrix 
cell was defined as the median FWI value across all exposed jobs within that matrix cell. As 
an illustration, a FWI value of 5 corresponds to exposure at the medium level for 40 hours 
per week, or at high level for 8 hours per week. A matrix cell was deemed informative if it 
was based on information from at least 10 jobs in the original Montreal studies.
Each job held by participants in our study was linked with CANJEM and assigned values of 
probability of exposure and FWI of exposure. Cumulative probability of exposure to each 
agent was calculated as the sum of (probability of exposure × correspondent job duration) 
for each reported job. Cumulative intensity of exposure to biocides and pesticides was the 
sum of (FWI of exposure × job duration) for each reported job. Average probability of 
exposure was calculated as cumulative probability of exposure divided by total duration of 
employment. Average intensity of exposure was calculated as cumulative intensity of

 exposure divided by total duration of employment. Exposures occurring within one year of 
diagnosis/interview were excluded since they occurred after any plausible etiologic window 
of time.
To derive an “ever exposure” variable from the linkage with CANJEM, we need to select a 
cutpoint on the probability of exposure scale above which the subject would be considered 
exposed and below which the subject would be considered unexposed. If we chose a 
cutpoint as low as 5%, it would be very sensitive and most of the subjects labelled as 
exposed would have had a low probability of exposure. On the other hand, if we chose a 
cutpoint as high as 95%, it would be very specific and a large fraction of workers truly 
exposed would be labelled as unexposed. In order to give greater weight to sensitivity than 
specificity, but not to exaggerate this choice unduly, we used ≥30% as the a priori threshold 
probability. Thus, ever exposure to a given agent was defined as having held at least one job 
with a probability of exposure of at least 30% and for at least one year. Subjects who had 
held jobs with a probability of exposure of less than 30% but greater than 0% were 
considered to be of possible but “uncertain” exposure status and were included as a separate 
category.
Statistical Analyses
Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). Models were adjusted for age (continuous), gender, race, 
education, body mass index (BMI), family history of thyroid cancer, previous diagnosis of 
benign thyroid disease, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity listed in Table 
1. Adjustment for other variables, such as family income, diagnostic x-ray exposure, and 
radiation treatment did not result in material changes in the observed associations and 
therefore were not included in the final models. The cumulative and average exposure 
variables were divided into tertiles (low, medium, high) based on the distributions among 
controls, and were analyzed as categorical variables. Continuous variables were included in 
the logistic regression models for testing of linear trends among exposed participants. All 
tests of statistical significance were two-sided, with alpha of 0.05. Sub-analyses were 
performed for papillary thyroid cancer, well-differentiated thyroid cancer (including 
papillary and follicular thyroid cancers), and for papillary and well-differentiated thyroid 
cancer by tumor size (≤1cm, >1cm). Because of the small number of cases, we did not 
analyze the data separately for follicular, anaplastic and medullary thyroid cancers. We also 
conducted stratified analyses by gender (male, female), and statistically assessed potential 
multiplicative interaction between gender and occupational biocide and pesticide exposure. 
All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Inc., 
Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
Compared to controls, cases were more likely to be younger, female, and less educated 
(Table 1). The distributions of obesity, family history of thyroid cancer, and previous 
diagnosis of benign thyroid disease were higher among cases compared to controls. Cases

 were also less likely to exercise and drink alcohol compared to controls. The distributions of 
race, family income, and smoking were similar between the cases and controls.
The 960 subjects in our study held 1,920 jobs. Out of the 1,920 jobs, 1,320 were linked to 
CANJEM with 6-digit codes, 291 with 5-digit codes, 274 with 3-digit codes, and 35 could 
not be linked to CANJEM. Jobs could not be linked were considered to have “unknown” 
exposure status and were treated as a separate category (not reported). Among the 318 jobs 
deemed exposed to biocides after linkage, the three most frequent were 1) health diagnosing 
and treating practitioners; 2) nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides, and 3) building 
cleaning workers. For the 20 jobs deemed exposed to pesticides after linkage, the three most 
frequent were 1) farmers, ranchers, and other agricultural managers, 2) postal service 
workers; and 3) first-line supervisors of landscaping, lawn service, and grounds keeping 
workers.
Ever being occupationally exposed to biocides was significantly associated with an 
increased risk of thyroid cancer (OR=1.65, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.35, Table 2). The highest risk 
was observed among people who had high cumulative probability of exposure (OR=2.18, 
95%CI: 1.28–3.73) and medium cumulative intensity of exposure (OR=1.99, 95%CI: 1.14–
2.47). Similar associations were observed for papillary thyroid cancer and well-
differentiated thyroid cancers. Possible but uncertain biocide exposure status was not 
statistically significantly associated with thyroid cancer risk, though odds ratios were 
elevated compared to the reference group. No significant association was observed for ever 
being occupationally exposed to pesticides and risk of thyroid cancer (OR=0.95, 95%CI: 
0.33–2.72). Because the number of pesticide-exposed cases was small (N=7), further 
detailed analyses by probability and intensity of exposure were not explored.
An increased risk of thyroid cancer was associated with ever occupational exposure to 
biocides among both women (OR=1.48, 95%CI: 1.00–2.19) and men (OR=3.11, 95%: 1.25–
7.72, Table 3). For probability of exposure to biocides, while a significantly increased risk of 
thyroid cancer was associated with high average and cumulative probabilities of exposure 
among women (OR=1.77, 95%CI: 1.02–3.09 and OR=2.13, 95%CI: 1.20–3.79 respectively), 
such a risk was associated with medium average probability of exposure among men 
(OR=5.31, 95%CI: 1.39–20.29). For intensity of exposure to biocides, medium average and 
high cumulative intensities of exposure were associated with an increased risk of thyroid 
cancer among women (OR=1.75, 95%CI: 1.05–2.90 for medium average, OR=1.95, 95%CI: 
1.08–3.52 for cumulative high exposure), while medium cumulative intensity of exposure 
was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer among men (OR=6.26, 95%CI: 
1.35–28.93). No significantly increased risk of thyroid cancer was associated with 
occupational exposure to pesticides among men or women.
After stratification by tumor size, we noted a stronger association with microcarcinomas 
(tumor size ≤1cm) for occupational exposure to biocides (Table 4). Statistically significant 
associations with microcarcinoma were mainly seen for ever occupational exposure to 
biocides (OR=1.89, 95%CI: 1.20–2.97 for papillary, OR=1.82, 95%CI: 1.18–2.79 for well-
differentiated), and stronger associations were shown for high probability of exposure 
(papillary: OR=2.65, 95%CI: 1.43–4.91 for average and OR=2.88, 95%CI: 1.51–5.47 for

 cumulative; well-differentiated: OR=2.40, 95%CI: 1.32–4.36 for average and OR=2.74, 
95%CI: 1.48–5.04 for cumulative) and high cumulative intensity of exposure (OR=2.83, 
95%CI: 1.48–5.39 for papillary, OR=2.58, 95%CI: 1.39–4.76). Significant associations with 
larger tumors were observed for occupational exposure to biocides at medium average 
probability (papillary: OR=2.09, 95%CI: 1.07–4.08; well-differentiated: OR=1.96, 95%CI: 
1.01–3.78) and medium cumulative intensity (OR=2.26, 95%CI: 1.13–4.55 for papillary; 
OR=2.26, 95%CI: 1.15–4.44 for well-differentiated). No significant associations were 
observed for occupational exposure to pesticides and thyroid cancer by tumor size.
DISCUSSION
Our study found increased risk of thyroid cancer was associated with occupational exposure 
to biocides. Biocides are a diverse group of products used defend against harmful organisms, 
generally formulated using one or more active ingredients.37 Major chemical classes used in 
biocides include halogenated organics, inorganics, nitrogen-based compounds, phenolics, 
organo-sulfur compounds, and organometallics.37 Biocides are widely used in wood 
preservation, cosmetics, paints and coating, disinfectants, recreational water, papers, for 
hospital and medical uses, and more. In Western Europe, halogenated specialty biocides 
were the leading products and wood preservation was the leading end use application.37 
Because of the growing attention to health, safety, and sanitation, demand for disinfectant 
and antimicrobial chemicals in the US has increased significantly during the past decades 
with an estimated 6% annual increase to $1.6 billion in 2017.38 The global disinfectant 
market is projected to cross $6 billion by 2020.39 Given the parallel increase in thyroid 
cancer incidence and exposure to biocides, and potential thyroid hormone disrupting 
properties of certain biocides, it is necessary to explore whether exposure to biocides 
increases the risk of thyroid cancer.
While few studies have examined the direct association between biocides and thyroid cancer, 
several studies have reported a positive association with certain occupations that could 
involve exposure to biocides in addition to other exposures. Fincham et al.33 reported that 
individuals employed in wood processing and pulp and papermaking experienced an 
increased risk of thyroid cancer. Lope et al.28 found higher risk of thyroid cancer among 
men employed as construction carpenters/joiners, and among women in the prefabricated 
wooden-building industry. Carstensen et al.32 found that workers in the canning and 
preserving industry were at significantly elevated risk of thyroid cancer. Several studies 
reported an increased risk among healthcare professionals including dentists, pharmacists, 
physicians, and nurses.2840–45 In these studies, hospital workers, particularly operating room 
scrub technicians are exposed to significant and repetitive quantities of disinfectants. In our 
recent study, a significantly increased risk of thyroid cancer was found among healthcare 
practitioners and technical workers including health diagnosing and treating practitioners, as 
well as building, ground cleaning and maintenance workers, especially those working as 
building cleaners and pest control workers.11 A stronger association was found among those 
with thyroid microcarcinomas. The two jobs most likely exposed to biocides were 1) health 
diagnosing and treating practitioners and 2) nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides. One 
might speculate that individuals who hold these jobs had easier access to medical care, thus 
their thyroid cancers were more likely to be diagnosed earlier or before a microcarcinoma

 progresses. However, the distributions of microcarcinomas and larger size tumors were 
similar among individuals who had these jobs, suggesting that early screening was less 
likely to explain these findings.
Although the underlying mechanisms linking biocides and risk of thyroid cancer is currently 
unclear, several experimental studies have found that biocides could alter thyroid hormones. 
Triclosan is widely used in cleaning products. Triclosan and its environmentally transformed 
derivative, methyl-triclosan, have been detected in sewage discharged from wastewater 
treatment plants. Studies have shown that triclosan decreases total serum thyroxine (T4) and 
triiodothyronine (T3) in animal models.21–24 Many drinking water disinfectants (i.e., 
chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and monochloramine) have been found to reduce T4 levels in 
pigeons and rabbits.1920 Pentachlorophenol (PCP), a wood preservative, has been shown to 
bind transthyretin and reduce T4 levels in rats.46–48 While several studies reported no 
association between thyroid hormones and thyroid cancer,49–53 two studies reported an 
increased risk of thyroid cancer associated with lower thyroid hormones.5455 Future 
prospective studies are warranted to investigate the association and identify potential causal 
agents. Additionally, biocides could alter the oral and/or gut microbiota, which has been 
linked to thyroid gland health.56–58 Approximately 20% of the conversion of inactive T4 to 
active T3 happens in the gastrointestinal tract. Animal studies have shown that gut microbes 
can either directly convert T4 into T3 sulfate, which can then be recovered as active T3 by 
intestinal sulfatase,59 or indirectly through metabolize bile acids to increase activity of 
iodothyronine deiodinase, a main enzyme of converting T4 into T3.60 Future investigation 
on the role of the microbiome on thyroid cancer will provide insights into the link between 
biocides and risk of thyroid cancer.
Our results showed an increased risk of thyroid cancer associated with exposure to pesticides 
among women but not among men, though the relationship was not monotonic and the 
observed difference was not statistically significant. Previous studies have also reported an 
elevated risk of thyroid cancer associated with exposure to pesticides and related 
occupations among women but not among men.2829 Goldner et al. found a positive 
association between self-reported pesticide use and hypothyroidism among both men and 
women.6162 We noted that the sample size of men was small in our study, which hampered 
the ability to detect small to moderate effect of pesticides among men. It is also possible that 
the differences in association between men and women due to differences in the specific 
pesticides to which they are each exposed. The observed association with pesticides was not 
among the highest exposure group, rather among the low exposure group. While a chance 
finding or potential exposure misclassification cannot be ruled out, the specific carcinogen 
may be specific to jobs seen in the low exposure group.
Several potential limitations should be considered in interpreting our study results. Although 
the gender distribution was different in cases and controls, we avoided potential confounding 
by either adjusting for gender in the analyses or presenting analyses stratified by gender. 
Although controls were frequency-matched (±5 years) to cases, cases were significantly 
younger than controls. Though we adjusted for age as well as gender in all models, potential 
residual confounding by age may still exist, but it would probably be quite minimal in 
magnitude. Individuals with benign thyroid disease are more likely to have increased thyroid

 surveillance and as such, may be more likely to be detected with thyroid cancer. This may 
contribute to the observed higher prevalence of benign thyroid diseases in the thyroid cancer 
cases compared to the population controls. We adjusted for history of benign thyroid disease 
in the final model. Regarding exposure assessment, one limitation of JEMs is that they do 
not capture within-job heterogeneity in exposure. Additionally, JEMs are typically best 
assigning exposure when people within an occupation are either all not exposed (0% 
probability) or when they are all exposed (100% probability). In our study, probability of 
exposure in the cells linked to our jobs varied from 0% to 95%, with a median of 3.56%. 
Therefore, misclassification was likely to have occurred to some extent although we used 
30% as a cutoff to define ever exposure. Moreover, the JEM relies on linkage with self-
reported occupational histories, and error associated with reported occupational histories 
might also introduce exposure misclassification. Biocides and pesticides represent diverse 
groups of chemicals with varying structures, bioavailability, and toxicity. While it would 
have been informative to conduct analyses for specific biocides and pesticides, this was 
unfortunately not possible, since CANJEM does not provide such detailed information. With 
regard to the validity of CANJEM estimates, while there has been no formal validation of 
the JEM itself, CANJEM is a summary of past assessments conducted using a well-
recognized approach, the results of which have been widely cited in such authoritative 
reviews as the International Agency for Research on Cancer monographs. Moreover, studies 
evaluating the reliability and repeatability of the exposures assigned by the chemists have 
shown encouraging results.63–66 Another potential limitation of the study is the relatively 
small number of exposed cases for certain sub-group analyses. A small sample size with low 
exposure prevalence reduces statistical power to detect an association, and additionally may 
increase the possibility of spurious associations.
In conclusion, this is the first study to apply a JEM to evaluate the association between 
occupational exposure to biocides and pesticides and the risk of thyroid cancer. We found an 
increased risk of thyroid cancer with occupational exposure to biocides, and no evidence of 
an association for occupationally pesticide use and thyroid cancer among women. Future 
evaluation of this relationship is warranted, with attention paid to examination of specific 
chemicals.

 What this paper adds?
➢
Limited studies have investigated occupational exposure to pesticides in 
relation to thyroid cancer and have reached inconsistent results.
➢
No study has investigated exposure to biocides in relation to thyroid cancer.
➢
We investigated the associations between occupational exposure to pesticides 
and biocides using a job exposure matrix and risk of thyroid cancer in a 
population-based case-control study in Connecticut.
➢
Our study provides the first evidence linking occupational exposure to 
biocides and risk of thyroid cancer.
➢
Future evaluation of this relationship is warranted, with attention paid to 
examination of specific chemicals.
