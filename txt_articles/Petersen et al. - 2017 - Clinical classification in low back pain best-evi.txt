systematic reviews

Abstract
Background: Clinical examination findings are used in primary care to give an initial diagnosis to patients with low
back pain and related leg symptoms. The purpose of this study was to develop best evidence Clinical Diagnostic
Rules (CDR] for the identification of the most common patho-anatomical disorders in the lumbar spine; i.e.
intervertebral discs, sacroiliac joints, facet joints, bone, muscles, nerve roots, muscles, peripheral nerve tissue, and
central nervous system sensitization.
Methods: A sensitive electronic search strategy using MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases was combined
with hand searching and citation tracking to identify eligible studies. Criteria for inclusion were: persons with low
back pain with or without related leg symptoms, history or physical examination findings suitable for use in primary
care, comparison with acceptable reference standards, and statistical reporting permitting calculation of diagnostic
value. Quality assessments were made independently by two reviewers using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic
Accuracy Studies tool. Clinical examination findings that were investigated by at least two studies were included
and results that met our predefined threshold of positive likelihood ratio ≥ 2 or negative likelihood ratio ≤ 0.5 were
considered for the CDR.
Results: Sixty-four studies satisfied our eligible criteria. We were able to construct promising CDRs for symptomatic
intervertebral disc, sacroiliac joint, spondylolisthesis, disc herniation with nerve root involvement, and spinal stenosis.
Single clinical test appear not to be as useful as clusters of tests that are more closely in line with clinical decision making.
Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies that evaluate clinical
examination findings for their ability to identify the most common patho-anatomical disorders in the lumbar spine. In
some diagnostic categories we have sufficient evidence to recommend a CDR. In others, we have only preliminary
evidence that needs testing in future studies. Most findings were tested in secondary or tertiary care. Thus, the accuracy
of the findings in a primary care setting has yet to be confirmed.
Keywords: Diagnostic accuracy, Sensitivity and specificity, Clinical examination, Low back pain classification, Clinical
decision making

 Background
Identifying diagnostic, prognostic and treatment orien-
tated subgroups of patients with low back pain (LBP]
has been on the research agenda for many years [1, 2].
Diagnostic reasoning with a structural/pathoanatomical
focus is common among clinicians [3], and it is regarded
as an essential component of the biopsychosocial model
[4–6]. Within this model, emphasis has been on the role
of psychosocial considerations and how these factors can
interfere with recovery. Indeed, there is good quality evi-
dence for the predictive value of a set of psychosocial
factors for poorer outcome in patients with LBP [7, 8].
These factors are multifactorial, interrelated, and only
weakly associated to the development and prognosis of
LBP [9], which might be one of the explanations why
effects of treatments targeting those risk factors has
been reported to be small, mostly short term, and there
was little evidence that psychosocial treatments were
superior to other active treatments [7, 10].
Maybe it is time to swing the pendulum towards the
“bio” in the biopsychosocial model. There are many
examples in medicine where the pathology has been
identified prior to any effective treatments being devel-
oped making it an ongoing challenge to generate new
diagnostic knowledge on which to base more effective
treatment strategies in the future. Alongside clinicians,
many researchers within the field of LBP feel that choos-
ing the most effective treatment for the individual pa-
tient is not possible without better understanding of the
biological component of the biopsychosocial model [4].
In 2003 the present authors suggested a diagnostic LBP
classification system based on a review of the literature
[11, 12]. This system has been fully or partly used in
prognostic and outcome studies by other research groups
[13–15]. The present study is driven by the obvious need
for an update based on recent evidence. The relevance of
an updated diagnostic classification is as follows:
First, diagnostic patterns of signs and symptoms from
history and physical examination may assist the clinician
in explaining the origin of pain to the patient and in
directing treatment at the painful structure. Patients
with persistent LBP often have misconceptions about
what is going on [16], and may have been given all sorts
of speculative explanations for their symptoms resulting
in anxiety and confusion. These patients often seek an
explanation about what is wrong [17], and new evidence
suggests that offering clear explanations and information
about aetiology, prognosis and interventions may im-
prove patient outcomes [7]. Giving an explanation based
on best evidence may contribute to 1) reducing the pa-
tient’s confusion and conceptual chaos, 2) reassurance
that the clinician knows what is going on, 3) visualizing
the potential benefit of treatment directed at the painful
structure (mental imagery has been suggested to have
potential in pain management [18, 19], 4) provided that
the above efforts are successful, motivating the patient
to open a therapeutic window.
Second, the need for studies testing the effect of treat-
ment strategies for subgroups of patients with LBP in
primary care has been emphasized in consensus-papers
[1, 20] as well as current European guidelines [21].
Targeting treatment to classifications merely based on
prognostic patient characteristics has not been convin-
cingly successful in finding treatment modalities that are
more beneficial than others [22]. A diagnostic classifica-
tion may assist in generating hypotheses as to which
treatment modalities are more likely to target the pain
source for future testing in randomized trials.
Finally,
an
evidence-based
clinical
diagnosis
with
acceptable accuracy will reduce the need for invasive or
expensive diagnostic methods (often with substantial
waiting time and expense).
The focus of this review is to outline the diagnostic
value of signs and symptoms for use in primary care
without access to confirmatory paraclinical methods.
The clinician must not mislead the patient, so it is im-
portant to distinguish between diagnostic labels that can
be given to patients with reasonable confidence and
those only suggesting suspected best evidence patho-
anatomy. Therefore, it is of interest to identify signs and
symptoms with the potential to diagnose common
sources and causes of LBP i.e. intervertebral discs, sacro-
iliac joints, facet joints, bones, nerve roots, muscles,
peripheral nerve tissue, and central nervous system
sensitization.
Throughout this review, we use the term Clinical
Diagnostic Rule (CDR) meaning that we have applied a
clinical decision rule to the field of clinical diagnostics.
A clinical decision rule “is a clinical tool that quantifies
the individual contributions that various components of
the history, physical examination, and basic laboratory
results make toward the diagnosis, prognosis, or likely
response to treatment in a patient. Clinical decision
rules attempt to formally test, simplify, and increase the
accuracy of clinicians’ diagnostic and prognostic assess-
ments” [23].
The aim of this paper was to develop multi-faceted
Clinical Diagnostic Rules (CDRs) for the lumbar spine
using individual diagnostic accuracy scores based on best
evidence for use in primary care clinical practice and re-
search. If possible, single clinical examination findings
would be clustered in CDRs based on well-defined
criteria.
Methods
The reporting of this review was based on the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-
analyses statement (PRISMA) [24].

 Eligibility criteria and study selection
To be included studies were required to meet the following
criteria:
1) Participants had LBP with or without leg pain
2) Use of an appropriate reference standard as listed in
Table 1.
3) Evaluation of at least one clinical finding available to
primary care clinicians.
4) Presentation of data enabling calculation of
sensitivity and specificity.
For some diagnostic categories, recent systematic re-
views were found covering our topic. These were included
if they complied with the principles recommended by the
Cochrane Collaboration [25]. In other categories, where
searches in included systematic reviews were terminated
before 2011, our searches were performed up to May 2015
from the date where the search of those reviews was ter-
minated. In categories where no systematic reviews were
found, we conducted systematic searches in the electronic
databases PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. Details of the
search strategy are presented in Additional files 1, 2, 3 and
4. One of the authors (TP) reviewed the search results
from the databases (titles and abstracts). Any titles and ab-
stracts from studies that appeared to compare the results
of clinical examination findings on patients with LBP with
those of diagnostic reference standards were selected for
full text review. Reference lists of selected studies were
reviewed for additional studies. If necessary, authors were
contacted for clarification of unclear reporting. The data
extraction from the selected studies was prepared by one
author (TP) and the second author (ML) reviewed the
complete data extraction form for accuracy. Any disagree-
ments were resolved by discussion. In diagnostic findings
where no studies presenting sensitivity and specificity
were found, studies presenting predictive values (sensitiv-
ity only) were included. We extracted values of diagnostic
accuracy for clinical examination findings that were inves-
tigated by at least two studies.
Reference standards
In this review, we used the best available reference stan-
dards for diagnosis of the relevant source and cause of
LBP. See Table 1. Index tests results were reported if
they were investigated in at least two studies using the
best available reference standard.
Quality assessment
Original studies were retrieved in full text and independ-
ently scored for quality and risk of bias using Quality
Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)
in
accordance
with
the
recommendations
of
the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of DTA
[26]. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. In
a few cases, one of the present authors were co-
authoring a paper or we were not able to acquire the ori-
ginal papers included in previous reviews. In these cases
the results of QUADAS were transferred from the re-
view in question to the present paper.
Grading of recommendations
There is currently no consensus regarding criteria to as-
sess the quality of evidence of diagnostic tests [27]. In
this study, diagnostic values that were in agreement in
more than two thirds of studies were included in our
final recommendations. Downgrading of recommenda-
tions from strong to weak was made in cases with ser-
ious
risk
of
bias

to

bias,
partial
verification bias, differential verification, incorporation
bias, or test review bias.
Diagnostic accuracy measures
In order to be clinically useful, we considered the cut-off
for a clinical finding to rule in the disorder to be a posi-
tive likelihood ratio (LR) above 2.0 [28], meaning that a

 positive index test will at least double the ratio of having
the disorder compared to not having the disorder. This
means that if the pretest probability is 0.3, the pretest
odds is 0.3/0.7 = 0.43 and if the LR is 2.0 the posttest
odds is 2*0.43 = 0.86 and the posttest probability can
then be estimated to 0.46. For a useful clinical finding to
rule out the disorder, we considered the cut-off to be a
negative LR below 0.5 [28], meaning that a negative
index test will reduce the odds of having the disorder at
least by half compared to not having the disorder. Overall,
the change from pretest to posttest chance of having the
disorder in question depends on the pretest probability.
In summary, clinical examination findings that were
investigated by at least two studies were included. Diag-
nostic values that were in agreement in more than two
thirds of studies and met our predefined threshold of
positive likelihood ratio ≥ 2 or negative likelihood ratio ≤
0.5 were considered for the CDR.
Statistics
A meta-analysis was considered if evidence of clinical
homogeneity could be established. Clinical heterogeneity
was assessed by comparing the similarity of patient sam-
ples, performance of tests, and reference standards.
However, a qualitative synthesis of studies according to
principles of best-evidence synthesis [29] was performed
if studies were clinically heterogeneous.
Results
Table 2 outlines the findings in each of the diagnostic
categories that are supported by more than one study.
Characteristics of the included studies are presented in
Additional file 5. Results of the quality assessments are
presented in Additional file 6. Results of the searches of
the literature are presented in Additional files 7, 8, 9, 10,
1, 2, 3 and 4.
Because of heterogeneous study populations, perform-
ance of index tests, and choice of reference standards,
only descriptive statistics were used to summarize find-
ings across studies. The diagnostic value of findings in
each category is presented below.
Intervertebral disc
A previous systematic review of clinical diagnosis of lum-
bar intervertebral discs (ID) has terminated the literature
search at February 2006 [30], Therefore, databases were
searched by the present authors from that date up to May
2015. The results of the search are presented in Additional
file 7. Three studies [31–33] from the Hancock review and
one study [34] from our updated search were included
(Table 2).
The evidence is sufficient to constitute a Clinical Diagnos-
tic Rule (CDR). We recommend the use of centralization of
symptoms during physical examination. Two studies using
strict criteria for centralization (change of pain in the
furthermost whole body region) reported high levels of
positive LR [32, 33], meaning that a positive test is useful
for ruling in the diagnosis. One study using less strict cri-
teria for centralization (change in any furthermost extent of
pain] [31], However, a positive LR of 2.1 even in this study
indicates the presence of relatively few false positive tests.
Facet joint
A previous systematic review of clinical diagnosis of
facet joints (FJ) terminated the literature search at
February 2006 [30]. The current search started from that
date up to May 2015. The results are presented in
Additional file 7. Seven studies [32, 35–40] from the
Hancock review and three studies [41–43] from our
updated search were included in this review (Table 2).
The evidence is insufficient to constitute a CDR. No
studies supporting Revel’s suggested rule [35] or part
thereof were identified.
The only negative findings from studies with single
block reference standards that appeared potentially use-
ful for ruling out FJ pain were centralization [32, 39] and
no relief with recumbency [37, 38].
Sacroiliac joint
A previous systematic review of clinical diagnosis of
sacroiliac joints (SIJ] terminated the literature search at
February 2006 [30]. The current search started from that
date up to May 2015. Results are presented in Additional
file 7. Four studies [32, 44–46] from the Hancock review
and three studies [47–49] from our updated search were
included (Table 2).
The evidence is sufficient to constitute a CDR. We
recommend the use of the Laslett rule [44] comprising
at least 3 positive out of 5 of the following findings from
physical examination: distraction, compression, thigh
thrust, Gaenslen’s test, or sacral thrust.
The rule was supported by two additional studies
where composites of at least 3 positive out of 5 tests re-
sulted in high levels of positive LR [45, 48]. There is only
a slight difference in tests included in the composites.
We recommend the addition of no centralization from
the “Laslett composite” to the CDR as it increases the
positive LR without compromising the negative LR. The
value of centralization for screening out SIJ pain was
supported by one more study with single block reference
standards reporting an acceptable negative LR [32].
Furthermore, we recommend the use of the physical
examination finding dominant pain the posterior super-
ior iliac crest (PSIS) area. This finding was only investi-
gated in one study using the double block standard [49].
However, the usefulness is supported by the fact that all
included studies comprised patients with pain location
in the PSIS area and it is a logical assumption that a

Disc herniation with nerve root involvement
A systematic review in the field of clinical diagnostic of
disc herniation with lumbar nerve root involvement
(NRI) has terminated the search of literature at October
2008 [50] and an update is in progress. [51] Therefore,
no search of the literature was performed by the present
authors. However, we reviewed the included studies and
the reference lists of those studies for additional clinical
findings. Thirteen studies [52–64] were included from
the systematic review and one study was excluded due
to lack of a reference standard negative population [65].
In addition, eight studies were included from the latest
Cochrane review [66] and our hand search of reference
lists [67–74] (Table 2). Data from original studies were
reviewed and new calculations of diagnostic values were
performed as appropriate.
The evidence is sufficient to constitute a CDR. We
recommend initial screening by use of the straight leg
raise (SLR) test in combination with the Hancock rule
[52] comprising at least 3 positive out of 4 of the follow-
ing findings: dermatomal pain location in concordance
with a nerve root, and corresponding sensory deficit,
reflex and motor weakness.
The CDR was supported by another composite [74]
who reported the diagnostic value of a combination of 3
neurological signs in patients with monoradicular pain.
The value of a negative SLR test for screening out
nerve root involvement was supported by the vast ma-
jority of single studies reporting acceptable levels of
negative LRs regardless of level of nerve root involve-
ment [55–58, 62–64, 71, 72].
Furthermore, we recommend the use of crossed SLR
that was supported by acceptable positive LRs in the vast
majority of studies [55, 58, 59, 62, 70].
The single findings included in the Hancock rule were
supported by most studies reporting diagnostic value.
Findings were supported by studies reporting acceptable
levels of positive LRs: dermatomal S1 pain location [54],
L2-L5 sensory deficits [55–57], L4 patellar reflex weak-
ness [56, 58], S1 Achilles reflex weakness [55–58], L4
knee extension weakness [56], L5 dorsiflexion weakness
of ankle and toes [55, 56, 58], or S1 plantarflexion

 weakness of ankle [55, 56]. One study reported accept-
able level of negative LR: any nerve dermatomal pain
location [53].
The diagnostic value of dermatomal pain location in
the Hancock rule was supported by only one additional
study and only regarding S1 distribution [54]. However,
the usefulness is supported by the fact that 11 out of 14
studies included a patient population with radicular pain
location, and it is a logical assumption that a strict inter-
pretation of radicular pain; i.e. dermatomal distribution
corresponding neurological findings, will increase the
specificity of this finding.
Spinal stenosis
A recently updated systematic review in the field of clin-
ical diagnostic of lumbar spinal stenosis (SS) terminated
at March 2011 [75]. Therefore, no search of the litera-
ture was performed by the present authors. Nine studies
[76–84] were included from the systematic review
(Table 2). Two of the nine studies included the same
population [82, 84] and we chose to use values from one
[82] because it reported diagnostic accuracy of question-
naire items not necessarily part of the reference standard
based on physical examination and imaging. In addition,
we included one study that was identified by our hand
search of reference lists [85].
The evidence is sufficient to constitute a CDR. We
recommend the use of the Cook rule [76] comprising at
least 3 positive out of 5 of the following findings from
patient history: age more than 48 years, bilateral symp-
toms, leg pain more than back pain, pain during walk-
ing/standing, and pain relief upon sitting (Table 2).
Furthermore, we recommend the use of improved walk-
ing tolerance with the spine in flexion that was sup-
ported by two studies with acceptable levels of positive
LRs [83, 85], and the patient history report of relief
by forward bending that was supported by two studies
with acceptable levels of positive LRs [77] or negative
LRs [79].
The single findings included in the Cook rule were
supported by other studies reporting diagnostic value.
Some findings were supported by studies reporting high
levels of positive LRs: age above 50 years [77], bilateral
pain [78], severe leg pain [79], leg pain worse with walk-
ing [77, 80], pseudoclaudication [81], pain worse with
standing [77], and symptoms improved when seated
[79]. Other studies reported acceptable levels of negative
LRs: no leg pain [77, 81], pain not worse when walking
or standing [82, 83], and sitting not best posture [83].
Spondylolisthesis
A recently updated systematic review of clinical diagno-
sis of lumbar spondylolisthesis terminated at March
2010 [86]. Therefore, databases were searched by the
present authors from that date up to May 2015. Results
of the search are presented in Additional file 8. Three
studies from the systematic review [87–89] and five
studies from our updated search [90–94] were included
(Table 2).
The evidence is sufficient to constitute a CDR. We
recommend a combination of two physical examination
findings positive: intervertebral slip by inspection or pal-
pation and segmental hypermobility by use of manual
passive physiological intervertebral motion test (Table 2).
Furthermore, we recommend the use of the passive lum-
bar extension test as a supplement for the identification
of degenerative spondylolisthesis in the elderly. All tests
were supported by two studies with acceptable levels of
positive LRs.
Fracture
An recently updated systematic review of the diagnosis
of lumbar fracture terminated at March 2012 [95].
Therefore, no search of the literature was performed by
the present authors. Eight studies from the systematic
review [96–103] were included (Table 2).
The evidence is insufficient to constitute a CDR. Best
evidence synthesis indicates the potential benefit of the
Henschke rule [96] comprising at least 1 negative out of
3 of the following findings from patient history: findings:
age >70 years, prolonged use of corticosteroids, and sig-
nificant trauma (Table 2). This rule presented with the
lowest negative LR meaning that when none of these
findings are present, the clinician will be able to rule out
a lumbar fracture with acceptable confidence.
Regardless of setting in which the studies were con-
ducted, single studies provided inconsistent results, and
the Henschke rule has not been validated in other studies.
Myofascial pain
There is no available evidence regarding diagnostic
value. We have conducted a systematic search of the
literature to May 2015 revealing that studies in the field
are hampered by the lack of an adequate diagnostic ref-
erence standard. The results of the search are presented
in Additional file 9. It appears that clinical criteria are in
fact
the
reference
standard.
Firm
manual
pressure
applied to the muscle and elicited feedback from the
patient appears to be the only means to establish the
diagnosis. However, there is considerable variability of
criteria used to diagnose a Myofascial Pain Syndrome
[104]. The original criteria for a myofascial trigger point
(TrP) originally proposed by Travell and Simons [105],
have been revised based on clinical experience and
results from reliability studies, but neither have been
rigorously validated [104].
We suggest a composite of four minimum criteria that
support the diagnosis: 1) presence of a palpable taut
Petersen et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders  (2017) 18:188 
Page 12 of 23
 band within a skeletal muscle, 2) presence of a hypersensi-
tive spot within the taut band with or without reproduction
of a distinct referred pain sensation with stimulation of the
spot, 3) patient recognition of the elicited pain. These cri-
teria are based on a strict interpretation of the nine criteria
currently under debate by The International Association
for the Study of Pain (IASP) [106].
We have found no accepted reference standard by
which a TrP can be diagnosed. However, several methods
have been suggested in order to at least demonstrate con-
struct validity of the clinical criteria. The results of our
search revealed some attempts to demonstrate construct
validity when TrPs were compared to electromyography
[107–111], sonoelastography [112], and quantitative sen-
sory testing [113, 114]. Methodological quality is generally
low due to lack of blinding, differences in definition of
active and latent TrPs, and all studies but two [108, 113]
investigated
the
shoulder
and
neck
region
making
generalizability questionable when results are transposed
to the low back.
In the absence of evidence regarding diagnostic accur-
acy, physical examination findings should demonstrate
inter-rater reliability in order to be considered clinically
meaningful. Two recent systematic reviews conclude
that physical examination findings cannot identify TrPs
with an acceptable degree of reliability [115, 116]. How-
ever, the authors state that if diagnostic criteria were re-
vised to include only a palpable tender spot in the
muscle that when palpated reproduces the patients’ fa-
miliar pain in that spot or in a distinct pattern, then the
present evidence indicates that worthwhile agreement
might be achieved. This reasoning is in line with our
suggestion of including three of the IASP criteria.
There are significant issues in relation to the intra-
and inter-observer reliability of identifying a muscle con-
taining a TrP, and there are no data supporting the abil-
ity of different examiners to agree on the exact location
of a TrP within a specific muscle.
Taken together, no conclusions can be made based on
the present evidence although our suggested criteria to
be used in future diagnostic studies appear to have face
validity.
Peripheral nerve
There is no available evidence regarding diagnostic
value. We have conducted a systematic search of the lit-
erature up to May 2015 revealing that all studies in the
field are hampered by the lack of an adequate diagnostic
reference standard. The results of the search are pre-
sented in Additional file 10. It appears that clinical cri-
teria are in fact the reference standard. We suggest the
following criteria to be used in future diagnostic studies:
Patient recognition of usual lumbar or leg pain with at
least two stages of sensitizing maneuvers, i.e. knee
extension, ankle dorsiflexion, or neck flexion during SLR
or slump test.
Although it has not been possible to report rigorous
diagnostic validity of our suggested criteria, they appear
to have some degree of face validity across authors.
However, there is considerable variability of criteria used
to diagnose increased peripheral neural mechanosensi-
tivity [117]. Most commonly used are SLR and slump,
but the interpretation of a positive test response differs.
Authors may put emphasis on provocation of any lum-
bar or leg pain, patient recognition of their usual pain,
and/or restriction of movement during testing [118].
Our search identified no studies that made compari-
sons between peripheral nerve mechanosensitivity test-
ing and diagnostic procedures that appear to have the
potential to be considered as reference standard (i.e.
nerve
conduction
electrodiagnostics,
ultrasound
im-
aging, or magnetic resonance neurography]. However,
our literature searches identified a number of studies
attempting to demonstrate construct validity of particu-
lar aspects of the clinical representation of peripheral
nerve pain.
Several studies found that reduction in range of move-
ment (ROM] during SLR or slump as criterion for in-
creased neural mechanosensitivity had no proven value
in discriminating between patients with LBP and asymp-
tomatic persons [119–124]. Also the hypothesis, that in-
creased muscle tension might be responsible for the
changes in ROM during SLR and slump test, has been
refuted by electromyographic studies [122, 125–127].
These studies found that muscle tension is an unlikely
source to ROM reduction during SLR and slump, but
they did not address the main concern, that is, that any
fascial network in the back and legs would be a equally
plausible source of pain provocation during neural sensi-
tizing maneuvers. Taken together, the data support the
view of Shacklock [118] who claimed that reproduction
of the patients usual symptoms should be an integral
part of the diagnostic criteria.
In the absence of an accepted reference standard,
physical examination findings should demonstrate inter-
rater reliability in order to be considered clinically
meaningful. Our search did not identify any reviews
exploring the inter-tester reliability of SLR or slump in
patients with LBP. However, we found three individual
studies in which the inter-tester reliability of patient rec-
ognition of lumbar or leg pain with at least two stages of
sensitizing maneuvers was investigated. In all studies,
Kappa values (K] indicated substantial agreement be-
tween examiners [128]. Walsh et al.[129] reported K =
0.80 (CI 0.39–0.94) for SLR and 0.71 (CI 0.33–0.71) for
Slump, Philip et al. [130] reported K = 0.89 (CI 0.81–
0.97) for Slump, and Petersen et al. [12] reported K =
0.59 (CI 0.39–0.79) for SLR and Slump.

 To summarize, no conclusions can be made based on
the present evidence although our suggested criteria to
be used in future diagnostic studies appear to have face
validity and acceptable level of intertester reliability.
Central sensitization
There is insufficient evidence to generate a diagnostic
rule to identify patients with a condition characterized
by “increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons in
the central nervous system to their normal or subthresh-
old afferent input” [131]. We have not conducted a sys-
tematic search of the literature inasmuch as studies in
the field are hampered by the lack of an adequate diag-
nostic reference standard because the underlying mecha-
nisms behind localized, regional and widespread pain are
not fully understood [132, 133]. In the absence of any-
thing better, we suggest the consensus-based Nijs rule to
support the diagnosis of central sensitization (CS) [134].
The first step in the rule is to exclude a neuropathic
pain source by use of the IASP criteria [135] and NeuP-
SIG guidelines [136]. The next step is to make sure that
the following criterion 1 is satisfied in combination with
either criterion 2 or 3:
Criterion 1. Pain experience disproportionate to the
nature and extent of injury or pathology, i.e. not
sufficient evidence of injury, pathology, or objective
dysfunctions capable of generating nociceptive input
consistent with the patient’s severity of pain and
disability.
Criterion 2. At least one of the following patterns
present:
– bilateral pain/mirror pain (i.e., symmetrical pain
pattern)
– pain varying in (anatomical) location/travelling pain
to anatomical locations unrelated to the presumed
source of nociception e.g., hemilateral pain, large
pain areas with non-segmental (i.e., neuroanatomi-
cally illogical) distribution
– widespread pain (defined as pain located axially, on
the left and right side of the body and both above
and below the waist)
– allodynia/hyperalgesia outside the segmental area of
(presumed] nociception. These findings are based on
testing of light touch by means of a swap or cold
items (allodynia) as well as testing by pin prick or
pressure (hyperalgesia).
Criterion 3. Hypersensitivity of senses unrelated to the
muscular system. These findings are based on a score
of at least 40 on the Central Sensitization Inventory
[137, 138].
Our suggested criteria are based on a consensus report
by researchers from different professions [134] and are
in line with other experts in neurophysiology [139–141].
Thus, although it has not been possible to report diag-
nostic value of the criteria, and only aspects of construct
validity have been reported [142], they appear to have
face validity. Results of systematic reviews are not con-
sistent with respect to prevalence of generalized or wide-
spread sensitization after quantitative sensory testing as
stand-alone tests in patients with chronic LBP [142,
143]. However, a composite of criteria fairly similar to
those of the Nijs rule for separating CS from nociceptive
and peripheral neuropathic pain sources have been re-
ported to have acceptable levels of inter-tester reliability
(K = 0.77, CI 0.57–0.96) [144] and discriminative validity
(positive LR 40.6, CI 20.4–80.8) [145].
Taken together, no conclusions can be made based on
the present evidence although our suggested criteria to
be used in future diagnostic studies appear to have face
validity, and promising aspects of construct validity and
level of intertester reliability has been reported.
Discussion
We found no composites of clinical findings that were
able to fully substitute for the respective reference stan-
dards. Thus, in cases where a patho-anatomical diagno-
sis is of crucial importance for the clinician or the
patient, the patient must be referred for more sophisti-
cated diagnostic procedures, which may include high
tech imaging or minimally invasive, controlled and
guided injection procedures.
Intervertebral disc
Our recommendation for the disc CDR is strong due to
risks of partial verification bias in only one [32] of the
three studies investigating the finding of centralization.
In all studies, a high risk of selection bias is present,
because they included patients from secondary care re-
ferred for diagnostic invasive procedures. Consequently,
the studies are likely to overestimate the diagnostic gain
of using the CDR in comparison to primary care settings
where the prevalence is somewhat lower.
In addition to the discography studies, our search
identified two studies reporting the diagnostic value of
centralization for identifying patients with MRI findings
of extruded or sequestrated discs [146, 147] Results of
these studies were not in concordance and warrant
further investigation.
Facet joint
It was not possible to constitute a CDR for the identifi-
cation of painful FJ. Double block procedure in joint
space or at nerve supply was judged to be acceptable as
reference standard when at least one of the following
criteria were satisfied: a positive controlled block, i.e. the
anesthetic block definitely reduced the pain from the
Petersen et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders  (2017) 18:188 
Page 14 of 23
 injected joint, where as a block in a non-painful joint
had no marked effect on pain, a positive confirmatory
block, the anesthetic block definitely reduced the pain
from the injected joint at two separate occasions 1 to
2 weeks apart, or a positive comparative dual block, i.e.
a short- followed by a long lasting anesthetic signifi-
cantly reduced pain in the predicted time periods [148].
The only negative findings from studies with single
block reference standards that supported single tests of
the Revel rule for ruling out FJ pain was no relief with
recumbency [37, 38]. However, the quality of evidence
for this finding was downgraded due to serious risk of
test review bias in both studies.
We found two additional single block studies investi-
gating diagnostic value of non-centralization using a sin-
gle block reference standard [32, 39]. Both studies
reported acceptable levels of sensitivity (0.96 and 0.97
respectively) and negative LRs (0.22 and 0.28 respect-
ively). However, the quality of evidence for this finding
was downgraded due to risk of partial- or differential bias
in the two studies. Although validated with only a single
block reference standard, a finding of centralization might
have preliminary merit for ruling out a symptomatic facet
joint because there is no point in giving patients with a
negative screening block a second block, even if the sec-
ond block was positive the same conclusion is reached,
non-FJ pain. The same reasoning applies to the value of
no relief in recumbency.
The results regarding no relief with recumbency and
non-centralization appear promising, but they need veri-
fication in future studies.
It is unclear whether the three studies by Manchikanti
et al. [35, 36, 41] might include the same populations.
However, this issue would have no influence on the
conclusion.
Sacroiliac joint
Our recommendation for the SIJ CDR is strong. Only
one out of three studies supporting the diagnostic value
of the composite of tests displayed risk of differential
bias [44]. In all studies, however, a high risk of selection
bias is present, because they included patients from sec-
ondary or tertiary care referred for diagnostic invasive
procedures. The CDR is supported by an additional two
out of three studies where composites of at least 3 posi-
tive out of 5 tests resulted in high levels of positive LRs
[45, 48]. Although the content of the composites are
comparable there is a slight difference in the use
Patrick’s PABER test and Mennell’s test. The fact that
one study did not support the rule [47], might be ex-
plained by the fact that the double block were performed
only 30 min apart, which increases the risk of false
positive findings. Furthermore, the quality of this study
suffered from the risk of test review bias.
The recommendation
of no centralization
during
physical examination was weak based on two studies
[32, 44]. One of those was reporting an acceptable level
of negative LR for centralization using a single block ref-
erence standard, making non-centralization useful for
ruling out a symptomatic SIJ [32]. However, both studies
suffered from risk of partial verification bias leading to a
downgrading of the quality of evidence.
We found two additional studies investigating diagnos-
tic value of SIJ area pointing, without indication of
whether or not the pain was dominant, using insufficient
reference standard in terms of a single or periarticular
SIJ blocks [46, 149]. The results were not in concord-
ance and warrant further investigation.
Nerve root involvement
The strength of our recommendation for the CDR is
weak based on mediocre methodological quality in most
of the studies. Studies revealed serious risk of bias in re-
lation to differential verification, incorporation, or test
review.
The studies included used surgical or imaging findings
as a reference standard. We found no differences in
diagnostic values when results from surgical and im-
aging studies were compared, which indicates that the
findings are similar across reference standards used.
Readers, interesting in results from pooling of studies
exclusively using surgery as reference standard, are
referred to the most recent systematic reviews [50, 66].
The reference standards have an influence on the diag-
nostic value of index tests. Studies using surgery means
that results were obtained in a patient population with
high prevalence of severe disc herniations, and thus re-
sults cannot be generalized to primary care populations
where prevalence is much lower. Studies using imaging
may display prevalence more like what is found in pri-
mary care, however at the expense of more false positive
findings [150]. Consequently, uncertainty remains as to
the generalizability of the results in primary care set-
tings. Only two studies [53] and [68] included patients
representative of those seen in primary care.
As suggested by others [66] we have tried to increase
the performance of tests in clinical practice by recom-
mending a CDR using a combination of tests with high
levels of sensitivity and specificity. Other combinations
of tests have been suggested [53, 69, 72, 151], but these
are not summarized in the format of CDRs and they are
not supported as well by single studies as the Hancock
rule.
When possible, we chose to report one level disc or
nerve root as reference standard in order to reduce the
number of false positives due to noise from other non-
relevant levels. This choice reflects the clinical reasoning
process in daily practice. The clinician needs to compare
Petersen et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders  (2017) 18:188 
Page 15 of 23
 dermatomal pain distribution with corresponding motor
or reflex weakness in order to make a meaningful diag-
nostic pattern.
Spinal stenosis
The strength of our recommendation for the CDR is
weak, based on low methodological quality of studies.
Many of the quality items revealed serious risks of bias.
First, the index test was part of the reference standard
(incorporation bias) in all studies resulting in a high risk
of overestimation of the diagnostic value of findings.
Most studies used expert opinion based on a combin-
ation of physical examination findings and imaging even
though data suggest that imaging is probably not
sufficient as a reference standard in comparison with
surgical findings [150]. Only two studies used surgical
verification of diagnosis as part of the reference standard
[77, 78]. Second, the majority of studies had problematic
reporting of blinding (test review bias) i.e. whether the
reference standard result was interpreted blind to those
of the index test and vice versa [76–78, 82, 83, 85].
Third, all studies included patients from secondary or
tertiary settings with a high prevalence of patients with
SS. Consequently, there is a high risk of selection bias
that is likely to overestimate the diagnostic gain of using
the CDR in comparison to primary care settings where
the prevalence is dramatically lower.
Spondylolisthesis
The strength of our recommendation for the CDR is
strong based on the methodological quality of studies.
Although several of the studies displayed risk of disease
progression bias and poor description of index tests, the
quality items reveal serious risks of bias in few cases [90,
94].
In the present review, functional dynamic radiographs
were accepted to identify segmental instability if index
tests were pain provocation or movement tests and plain
static radiographs if index tests were palpation of slip.
Flexion-extension functional radiographs are consid-
ered the “gold standard” in degenerative spondylolisth-
esis, and a disc angle change >10° or change in
translation > 3 mm are generally used as cut-offs [152].
Plain radiographs with lateral views are useful in the ini-
tial investigation of isthmic spondylolisthesis [153]. A
slip of > 3 mm has been suggested as cut-off [154], but
the literature is lacking as to what degree of slip is
significant [153]. Instead, the descriptive Meyerding
classification [154] is often reported.
All studies used a definition of spondylolisthesis simi-
lar to the above, except Abbott et al. [88] that used a
cut-off of 2 standard deviations beyond the mean of a
sample of pain free individuals.
Even though the positive LRs across single studies are
only of moderate levels, the magnitude of LRs will prob-
ably rise to a level sufficient to be useful in clinical prac-
tice when they are used in combination.
All studies, except one [88] were performed in tertiary
settings resulting in high risk of selection bias that is
likely to overestimate the diagnostic gain of using the
CDR when applied to primary care.
Fracture
It was not possible to constitute a CDR for the identifi-
cation of a painful fracture. Results of single studies were
not in concurrence and the majority of studies had ser-
ious risks of bias with respect to differential verification,
test review, and uninterpretable results/withdrawals.
A symptomatic fracture is considered a ‘red flag’ war-
ranting referral to secondary care. Consequently we have
emphasized findings that are able to exclude patients
with this condition.
The Henschke rule [96] has the potential to be a useful
screening tool in primary care. However, the results need
confirmation in future studies as the results of the only
other primary care study included in this review were
not in concordance [100]. Overall, the results from these
two studies did not differ markedly from the rest.
Trauma (major in young persons and minor in the
elderly] is a highly plausible mechanism that can lead to
fracture and a highly increased prevalence of osteopor-
otic fractures are seen in patients, mainly female, with
age above 75 years [97]. Both of these features contrib-
ute to the diagnostic value of the rule although not vali-
dated as stand-alone findings.
The inconsistency of results may be influenced by the
method of imaging. Radiography was used in all studies
with the addition of CT-scan in only one study [102].
No study used MRI. Radiographs may be adequately
sensitive, but their ability to distinguish acute from
chronic fractures is poor. MRI is more specific because
it identifies marrow edema or an associated hematoma,
which may indicate a symptomatic fracture [155].
Myofascial pain
The suggested criteria should be regarded as the first
step in defining a common set of diagnostic criteria for
selection of patients to be included in future reliability
and validity studies.
Our literature searches identified a number of studies
attempting to demonstrate construct validity, but we did
not perform a systematic search for additional studies in
reference lists. Therefore, the included studies must be
regarded as important examples of attempts of valid-
ation rather than a systematic review of this type of lit-
erature.
The
studies
used
TrPs
found
by
manual
palpation as the reference standard, meaning that the
Petersen et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders  (2017) 18:188 
Page 16 of 23
 purpose of these studies were to identify the underlying
physiological mechanisms behind the presence of TrPs ra-
ther than a diagnostic validation of palpation findings.
Several hypothetical theories have been suggested in order
to explain the formation and persistence of TrPs [156].
It is a matter of controversy whether TrPs should be
regarded as stand-alone entities that are a primary pain
source or whether they are secondary to other painful
disorders [106, 157]. Consequently, a myofascial pain syn-
drome may coexist with several other syndromes in our
proposed classification system. It is essential to exclude
underlying disorders capable of causing reproduction of a
referred pain sensation with stimulation of a hypersensi-
tive spot in the muscle before a conclusion can be made
as to whether the myofascial TrP is the dominant source
of the patient’s pain.
Peripheral nerve
While diagnostic value of the SLR and slump is demon-
strated in patients with lumbar radiculopathy, the value
in relation to painful peripheral nerve tissue is unknown.
Our search did not identify any studies investigating the
ability of these tests to discriminate patients with periph-
eral nerve pain from other competing disorders. The
suggested criteria should be regarded as an attempt to
define a common set of diagnostic criteria for selection
of patients to be included in future validity studies.
The spread of sensitizing effects along the nerve is a
plausible explanation for why movement of a distant
body part can change sensory responses. However, it has
been argued that the fascial network in the back and legs
and may account for positive findings in terms of pain
and limited range of movement during SLR and slump
test
[127,
158].
Therefore,
structural
differentiation
between neural tissues as opposed to musculoskeletal
connective tissues has been proposed. When lumbar or
leg pain increase during the SLR test with dorsiflexion of
the ankle or flexion of the neck, a neural pain source is
alleged to be identified [118]. Likewise, regarding the
slump test, with the addition that the pain decrease with
the release of neck flexion [118, 159]. Our search of the
literature did not identify any studies that specifically
tested this hypothesis.
In line with other authors [160, 161], we suggest the
term “Increased neural mechanosensitivity” to describe a
condition where the patient’s usual pain is reproduced
by sensitizing maneuvers. Increased neural mechanosen-
sitivity has been given several other labels, i.e. adverse
neural
tension,
neurodynamics,
and
neural
tension
dysfunction [118, 160].
The issues discussed in the myofascial pain section
above, concerning coexistence with several other syn-
dromes in our proposed classification system, apply to
peripheral nerve as a pain source as well.
Central sensitization
Although the Nijs rule is the result of a consensus process,
caution is warranted because the participating experts are
a selective sample within the field of neuroscience. There-
fore, the suggested criteria should be regarded as an at-
tempt to define a common set of diagnostic criteria for
selection of patients to be included in future validity stud-
ies. A possible use of the Nijs rule in clinical practice has
been exemplified in a recent paper [162].
CS might be explained by an amplification of neural
signaling within the central nervous system that elicits
pain hypersensitivity” [139] However, controversy exists
as to the nature of CS and whether it is possible to iden-
tify this condition in clinical practice [140, 163].
The pathophysiological
mechanisms
are
not
fully
understood, but there is increasing evidence that CS and
chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain is associated
with plasticity changes in of the central nervous system
leading to hypersensitivity that can explain the clinical
findings in chronic widespread LBP [133, 139, 141]. The
main clinical manifestations are widespread lowered pain
thresholds, exaggerated pain response to stimuli, and en-
largement of pain referral areas. Most studies in the field
have used clinical manifestations as the reference stand-
ard, meaning that the purpose of these studies were to
identify the underlying physiology behind the presence
of CS and widespread pain rather than a diagnostic val-
idation of clinical findings.
In patients with chronic LBP it has been reported that
25–38% develop chronic widespread pain [164–166],
and the condition is closely associated with systemic co-
morbidity and psychological disorders [167].
In our opinion, the suggested rule is useful for increas-
ing the likelihood of identifying patients with CS in pri-
mary care. Central sensitization may coexist with other
structure-specific syndromes in our diagnostic classifica-
tion system because it is generally recognized that there
is a structural pain generator behind initial nociception
and peripheral sensitization involved [132]. However, we
would not expect a patient with CS to fit any of the clin-
ical patterns of specific pain producing structures in the
classification system. In order to choose the best treat-
ment strategy, the clinician has to make a decision as to
which pain sources are the dominant in the individual
patient with LBP [140, 163].
Reference standards
At the present time is seems obvious that there are no
‘gold’ standards, either in the form of clinical tests, high
tech imaging or other procedures. What is available are
reference standards that, while not perfect, are appropri-
ate and quite adequate for the majority of patients, and
for use as comparators with clinical tests in diagnostic
accuracy studies. The diagnostic utility of discography
Petersen et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders  (2017) 18:188 
Page 17 of 23
 and FJ or SIJ blocks is a matter of controversy. Some
consensus reports do not support the use of these proce-
dures due to insufficient evidence of validity [168], the
main problem being the absence of gold standards for
identifying a “true” pain source. In this review we have
tried to reduce the possible false positive rate by using
the strictest available criteria for the reference standards
as a requirement for inclusion of studies.
What is apparent from our systematic review is that
there generally is sufficient published data that can form
a framework for an intelligent use of clinical examin-
ation procedures and more expensive and invasive diag-
nostic investigations when required. Diagnosis of the
source and cause of presenting back pain remains a
challenge, and only further high quality research will
improve certainty for clinicians and patients alike.
It is true that for a large proportion of patients in the
acute or subacute phase, an accurate patho-anatomic
diagnosis is not required, even though possible with
some degree of confidence. However for patients whose
symptoms are not improving after several months, the
need for a more precise diagnosis becomes increasingly
valuable as a guide to more effective and targeted man-
agement. To this extent, the recommendations from this
systematic review might be helpful, in that patient selec-
tion for expensive high tech imaging and minimally in-
vasive diagnostic injection procedures is facilitated, with
consequent better utilization of resources.
Implication for practice
Our recommendations are based on considerations of
the consequences of false positives and false negatives.
In most diagnoses, we put the most emphasis on tests
with high specificity indicating few false positives and
positive LRs to indicate the ratio of true positive tests re-
sults above the false positives. The consequence is that
the clinician will be quite certain that a patient would
actually have the disorder if the reference standard pro-
cedure were to be performed. Often, high specificity is a
trade off at the expense of low sensitivity, meaning that
a substantial proportion of patients with the disorders
are not identified, and remain unclassified. However, the
consequences in primary care are not serious inasmuch
as the patient remains in the category of non-specific
LBP. In daily clinical practice, referral to further diag-
nostics most often depends on assessment of red flags,
severity of symptoms and functional limitations rather
than diagnostic classification.
Only in cases where an undiagnosed spinal fracture is
present, do primary treatment methods have potential to
harm the patient if unidentified. Consequently, we have
prioritized the recommendation of tests with a high sen-
sitivity and low negative LRs in this diagnosis.
For the clinician, the diagnostic considerations do not
stop here. The diagnostic certainty that a positive test
will identify a pathological disorder is dependent on the
prevalence of the disorder. Prevalence of categories like
nerve root involvement, spinal stenosis, spondylolisth-
esis, and fracture are generally much lower in primary
care settings than in secondary or tertiary settings of the
vast majority of diagnostic studies. This means that the
diagnostic accuracy of a positive test is likely much
lower when the index tests are applied to primary care
settings. For example, the pre-test probability of having
a symptomatic spinal stenosis in primary care is esti-
mated to be only 3% [168]. By use of the Cook rule, the
posttest probability will rise to 7%. When improved
walking tolerance with the spine in flexion or patient
history report of relief by forward bending are added to
the rule we would expect the post-test probability to rise
further. By means of the LRs presented in this review,
the clinician can use Fagan’s nomogram [169] as a
graphical tool for estimating how much the result on a
diagnostic test changes the probability that a patient has
the disorder in question.
In daily practice, it is unlikely that clinicians make
conclusions based on a single finding. This practice is
supported by our results that generally provide the most
promising accuracy in diagnosis in which a composite of
findings can be identified. Some studies do report diag-
nostic accuracy of test combinations and clusters, but
this does not totally reflect the reasoning process of ex-
pert clinicians. Clinicians do not use individual tests or
clusters of tests out of context from the total clinical pic-
ture. Sometimes pattern recognition is used, and some-
times a sequential, algorithmic or staged approach is
used. Another way to utilize multiple test results is to
consider the probability of specific disorders based on
prevalence within a defined group or subgroup. Preva-
lence is equal to pre-test probability so the probability of
any given disorder is equivalent to its prevalence in any
given setting. The process of progressively reducing the
size of the group labelled as ‘non-specific’
, by abstracting
out those cases with very high probability of a known
condition, may be called ‘Diagnosis by Subtraction’.
Diagnosis by subtraction
To illustrate, assume for this current purpose, that in a
specific setting, the prevalence of ‘centralizers’ is 0.5 or
50%. The high specificity of this clinical finding to disco-
genic pain confirmed by discography indicates that these
patients do not have ‘non-specific’ back pain but a ‘spe-
cific’ anatomical source of pain [33]. Whatever the
prevalence of the remaining possible causes of pain in
the whole group, it is twice as high in the ‘non-central-
izer’ group. Thus the probability that a non-centralizer
has of having, say sacroiliac joint pain or facet joint pain,
Petersen et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders  (2017) 18:188 
Page 18 of 23
 is doubled. This review has shown that certain CDRs
have high specificity for sacroiliac joint pain, spondylo-
listhesis, disc herniation with nerve root involvement,
and spinal stenosis. If we sequentially subtract those
cases satisfying the CDR’s for these conditions, the
prevalence / probability of other conditions being the
cause of pain progressively rises as the size of the non-
specific low back pain category reduces.
Limitations of this review
One of the main limitations in this review is that the
search of the literature was not updated to year 2015 in
all diagnostic categories. Due to limited resources, this
has not been possible for the present authors. If an exist-
ing review fulfilled the criteria of being current, relevant,
and of high-quality, then we chose to use our resources
to conduct systematic searches within fields where re-
cent reviews had not been published.
The vast majority of patients is most likely not repre-
sentative of those that present for treatment in primary
care. Almost all patients were preselected having a refer-
ral to specialist centers for specific diagnostic evaluation
making them likely to have the target disorder in
question.
Although some of the included reviews have used a
QUADAS score of 10/14 as a marker for high versus
low quality studies, we agree with the developers of the
tool that no meaningful cut off exists [170].
It is our judgment that pooling of data was not feasible
due to great variability across studies: The patient char-
acteristics and prevalence of the target disorders varied
considerably, the same reference standard was seldom
used across studies, definition of a positive reference
standard was not often specified, and execution of index
tests was likely to vary among studies. Though it is
tempting to pool data and perform a meta-analysis, we
chose not to do this since in our opinion, pooling sys-
tematically homogenizes studies that are in fact ac-
knowledged
as
heterogeneous.
We
chose
to
put
emphasis on the results of those studies that had satis-
factory quality assessments, and seemed to be closest in
context to the environment this classification targets i.e.
primary care.
Conclusions
In some diagnostic categories we have sufficient evi-
dence to suggest a CDR. In others, we have only prelim-
inary evidence that needs testing in future studies. The
use of single clinical tests appears to be less useful than
clusters of tests which is more closely in line with clin-
ical decision making.
With respect to clinical diagnostic of symptomatic
intervertebral disc, sacroiliac joint, spondylolisthesis, disc
herniation with nerve root involvement, and spinal
stenosis, we were able to construct promising CDRs (see
Fig. 1]. However, the accuracy of these findings in a
primary care setting has yet to be confirmed.
