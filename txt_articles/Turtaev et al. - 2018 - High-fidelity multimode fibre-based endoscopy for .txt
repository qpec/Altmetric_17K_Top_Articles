Abstract
Progress in neuroscience relies on new techniques for investigating the complex dynamics of neuronal networks. An
ongoing challenge is to achieve minimally invasive and high-resolution observations of neuronal activity in vivo inside
deep brain areas. Recently introduced methods for holographic control of light propagation in complex media enable
the use of a hair-thin multimode optical fibre as an ultranarrow imaging tool. Compared to endoscopes based on
graded-index lenses or fibre bundles, this new approach offers a footprint reduction exceeding an order of magnitude,
combined with a significant enhancement in resolution. We designed a compact and high-speed system for
fluorescent imaging at the tip of a fibre, achieving a resolution of 1.18 ± 0.04 µm across a 50-µm field of view, yielding
7-kilopixel images at a rate of 3.5 frames/s. Furthermore, we demonstrate in vivo observations of cell bodies and
processes of inhibitory neurons within deep layers of the visual cortex and hippocampus of anaesthetised mice. This
study paves the way for modern microscopy to be applied deep inside tissues of living animal models while exerting a
minimal impact on their structural and functional properties.
Optical systems have traditionally been understood as
assemblies of components acting in a predefined and
determinate manner. This notion is currently undergoing
a transformation due to rapid advances in the technology
and methods for spatial light modulation. Computer-
controlled holographic modulators now facilitate the
deployment of unusual and complex optical media with
properties that bring unique advantages to biomedical
applications1.
The use of multimode fibres (MMFs) as ultranarrow
endoscopes is a promising example of this concept2–10,
since it allows one to overcome the trade-off between the
size of the optical element and the attainable resolution11.
The nature of light transport through MMFs leads to the
transformation (or scrambling) of incident wavefronts
into seemingly random speckle patterns. Adaptive optics
provides a means for overcoming this signal degrada-
tion12–15. A number of recently developed techniques in
this domain have enabled the randomised output fields to
be tailored into any desired distribution across the distal
fibre facet or an arbitrarily remote plane2–5. Laser scan-
ning microscopy utilised in this study relies on the for-
mation
of
diffraction-limited
foci
behind
the
fibre,
combined with image reconstruction from fluorescence
signals that are collected and guided backwards4,7.
Digital micromirror devices (DMDs) have recently
opened up a range of opportunities in this domain by
increasing the achievable light modulation refresh rates by
several orders of magnitude compared to well-established
nematic liquid crystal-based devices16–19. As a result, the
foci behind a MMF can now be scanned at several tens of
kHz, thus acquiring images at speeds approaching video
rates. Furthermore, it has also been shown that DMDs
generate foci of higher quality compared to other mod-
ulators20. Building on these advances, the focus of

Here we devise a compact and high-speed imaging
system capable of resolving micron-sized subcellular
neural structures in an anaesthetised animal model
through, to our knowledge, the most minimally invasive
endoscopic probe reported thus far. Relying on high-
performance holographic methods and a carefully opti-
mised design, this represents the first instrument capable
of time-lapse artefact-free imaging of both neuronal
somata and dendritic processes with diffraction-limited
resolution. As exemplified by optogenetics22, the extre-
mely reduced footprint allows observations unprecedently
deep within brain tissues, thus enabling a new level of
in vivo investigation of neuronal connectivity in pre-
viously inaccessible brain structures.
The system consists of laser, calibration, beam-shaping
and sample modules, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. A DMD in
the core of the beam-shaping module is employed in the
off-axis regime, and thus, despite its inherent binary-
amplitude light modulation, can control the phase of the
optical fields coupled into the fibre. As shown pre-
viously3,4,20, employment of the DMD and the calibration
module
allows
characterising
the
light
propagation
throughout the entire optical path, from the DMD chip to
a desired focal plane behind the distal fibre facet, which
can be expressed as a transmission matrix (TM) of the
system14,15. The TM allows the calculation of phase
modulations, which, when applied to the DMD, result in
the formation of diffraction-limited foci at any desired
location in the focal plane. The sequential exposure of a
fluorescent sample to such a series of foci, performed as
the fluorescent signals propagating backwards through
the fibre towards a bucket detector are collected, is
equivalent to raster-scanning laser microscopy.
A standard commercially available MMF with a core of
50 µm in diameter and a NA of 0.22 was chosen as the
endoscopic probe. To minimise the tissue damage caused
by compression during the penetration process23,24, the
fibre (2 cm in length) was postprocessed into a flat-cone
termination by polishing the excess cladding from an
external diameter of 125 µm to 60 µm, as depicted in
Fig. 1b. In all experiments, we offset the focal plane 5–15
µm from the distal fibre facet to guarantee that the full
NA of the fibre was reached uniformly across the field of
view and to minimise sample-induced aberrations. Once
the probe is placed and aligned with the system, it takes
approximately 2 min to obtain the TM, compute ~7000
phase modulation patterns for all desired foci across a 50-
µm-wide circular region of the focal plane, and upload the
patterns to the memory of the DMD.
The fidelity of the generated foci determines the ima-
ging quality. When controlling light propagation through
a randomising medium, not all of the optical power
leaving the medium can be directed to a diffraction-
limited focus. The remaining power forms a background
signal in the form of speckle, as shown in Fig. 2b. The
ratio between the power in the focal spot and the total
output power emitted from the fibre is commonly used as
a figure of merit when assessing the performance of a
given optimisation approach. Working in the off-axis

 regime and utilising circularly polarised light, this power
ratio has been shown to reach 75%, which is very close to
the fundamental limit for approaches based on phase-only
modulation25. The enhancement factor, defined as the
ratio of the peak intensity at the focal point to the average
level of speckled background, is also commonly used to
assess the quality of focussing; this factor exceeds 3100 in
our experiments (see Methods for more details).
Once the calibration procedure is finished, the calibration
module is removed and exchanged with the sample module.
A fast bucket intensity detector triggered by DMD reference
TTL pulses (synchronised with switching between indivi-
dual DMD modulations) allows the system to operate at a
refresh rate of 23 kHz, which results in an imaging rate of
~3.5 frames/s. The calibration remains valid provided that
the optical system does not suffer from mechanical or
environmental factors, which may lead to perturbations in
the light transport through the MMF and degradation of
the imaging quality. As recently demonstrated, temperature
changes in short fibre segments lead to an axial shift of the
focus away from the fibre facet. At the scale of fibre lengths
used in this study, the temperature change from room
temperature to that of the animal body leads to a negligible
axial shift not exceeding the Rayleigh range of the focused
beam. Bending of the fibre may be another source of ima-
ging performance degradation; however, at the curvature
levels expected in our study, these effects are also negligible.
The most severe calibration degradation is therefore to be
expected from drifts in the optical pathway, particularly the
mutual alignment of the DMD and MMF input. The system
has therefore been devised with a robust cage-based con-
struction, resulting in stable operation over several hours
without the need for recalibration. The optical path was
designed to achieve the maximum resolving power of the
MMF.
The resolution of the system was assessed via a negative
USAF 1951 test target. As shown in Fig. 2d–h, line
separations of 3.9 µm, 1.9 µm, and 1.6 µm were imaged
with contrasts of 65%, 28%, and 15%, respectively, which
is in good agreement with the resolution limit (Abbe
criterion) dictated by the wavelength and NA of the fibre.
To validate the operation in the fluorescent regime
(Fig. 2c), we used 4.0-µm red fluorescent beads on a
microscope coverslip.
To demonstrate in vivo imaging capability, we used
transgenic mice with a subpopulation of inhibitory

 interneurons labelled with a red fluorescent marker (see
Methods). The fibre probe was inserted into the primary
visual cortex (V1) and deeper into the hippocampus of the
mouse brain through a small craniotomy. The images
presented in Fig. 3a, b were recorded at different depths
within V1 (0.5–0.8 mm) and in the CA1 region and
dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus (approximately
1.5 and 2 mm). The fibre probe causes minimal damage
in vivo, as demonstrated by a postmortem section of a
perfused brain after fibre imaging (Fig. 4b), showing the
impact of the insertion procedure with a fibre tract width
not
exceeding
50 µm.
The
resolution
and
contrast
achieved in vivo allow for visual identification of both
relatively large objects, such as cell somata (diameter of
approximately 10–20 µm, Fig. 3a), and thin processes
(usually 1–2 µm wide) with fine structures corresponding
to synaptic boutons (Fig. 3b). In addition to imaging
anatomical structures in deep brain regions, the system
can also be used to image dynamic processes over time, as
exemplified by the observation of a minuscule local hae-
morrhage from a burst blood vessel, showing individual
red blood cells (see Fig. 3c). The high frame rate of the
system allows live recording of the labelled structures
during fibre penetration (see Supplementary Movie).
In this work, we have designed a highly optimised
optical pathway for fluorescence-based imaging of deep
brain structures with micrometric spatial resolution while
causing minimal damage to the tissue surrounding the
fibre
penetration
area.
The
robust
design
allows
continuous

hours.
Deploying the most efficient wavefront-shaping algo-
rithms and, currently, the fastest possible hardware for
light modulation, our system is capable of acquiring 7-
kilopixel images with micron-level spatial resolution at
imaging speeds of 3.5 frames/s. This provides adequate
spatial and temporal resolution for fluorescent imaging of
subcellular structures in living tissues.
We were able to perform fluorescence imaging in vivo
deep within a mouse brain using a single MMF-based
probe. In anaesthetised transgenic mice with tdTomato
fluorescent protein expression in a sparse subpopulation
of inhibitory interneurons, we obtained visually identifi-
able images of neuronal somata and processes in both the
visual cortex and the hippocampus, >2 mm below the
surface of the brain. While the imaging was restricted to
the cortex and hippocampus in our experiments, with this
technique, the entire dorsal-ventral extent of the mouse
brain (4–6 mm) can be covered, allowing imaging of even
the most ventrally located nuclei in the brain. The
achieved resolution is limited only by the numerical
aperture of the fibre, being comparable to a standard ×10
microscope objective. Imaging immediately after insertion
of the endoscopic probe, which is only possible due to its
minuscule footprint, eliminates the need for a long post-
operative recovery period, as well as the necessity of
surgical removal of overlying tissue and implantation of
imaging elements, such as a graded-index lens26,27. The

 high resolution can be further extended to visualisation of
structural changes (e.g., spine turnover) over extended
periods of time.
Although the structures of interest in this report are
clearly recognisable, the images exhibit a visible level of
background. This background signal originates from
sample excitation by out-of-focus light, and in the case of
MMF-based imaging, the resulting glare features con-
centric wavelets due to the discrete structure of allowed
propagating modes. Eliminating out-of-focus light by
means of confocal rejection of incoherent fluorescent
signals returning from the MMF is currently not possible
without prohibitive power losses. Therefore, future work
will focus on the development of computational post-
processing algorithms to further enhance the imaging
quality.
This demonstration paves the way for in vivo imple-
mentation of numerous techniques of modern micro-
scopy,

Methods
Setup
As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the system is designed in a
modular manner, consisting of laser, calibration, beam-
shaping and sample modules. In the laser module, the
beam is divided into a signal and a reference beam, which
are
coupled
to
single-mode
polarisation-maintaining
fibres. The calibration module is used to measure the
transmission matrix of the multimode fibre, and is sub-
sequently replaced by a sample module for the anaes-
thetised animal model.
Laser module
A single-frequency,
diode-pumped solid-state laser
source emitting at the wavelength of 532 nm provides a
continuous-wave and linearly polarised beam. Achromatic
doublets L7 and L8 form a telescope to demagnify the
beam, and aspheric lenses L9 and L10 couple the signal
and reference beams into the polarisation-maintaining
fibres. Half-wave plate HW3, in combination with the
input linear polariser of the Faraday optical isolator ISO,
controls the combined power coupled to the signal and
reference beams, whereas half-wave plate HW4, in com-
bination with polarising beam splitter PBS, controls the
power ratio between the signal and reference beams. Half-
wave plates HW5 and HW6 are used to finely align the
polarisation of the coupled beams with one of the bire-
fringent
axes
of
the
polarisation-maintaining
fibres
(Fig. 1a).
Beam-shaping module
Achromatic doublet L1 collimates and expands the
signal beam to overfill the DMD at an incidence angle of
24° with respect to the DMD chip. In this way, each
micro-mirror in the ‘on’ state (+12°) reflects light in the
direction of the optical system, whereas micro-mirrors in
the ‘off’ state (−12°) redirect light towards a beam dump.
Lenses L2, L3 and L4 relay the far-field of the first dif-
fraction order of the holograms generated at the DMD to
the proximal facet of the multimode fibre. An iris dia-
phragm is used in the Fourier plane of L2 to isolate the
first diffraction order of the holograms, while blocking the
remaining orders. The combination of lenses L2 and L3 is
chosen to underfill the aperture of aspheric lens L4 in
order to reduce its effective numerical aperture to 0.23,
matching that of the multimode fibre. The multimode
fibre used has a core diameter of 50 µm and a NA of 0.22
and sustains approximately 2100 propagation-invariant
modes (i.e., 1050 for each orthogonal polarisation state) at

 the wavelength of 532 nm. Circular polarisation is well
preserved after propagation through a straight fibre seg-
ment. The transmission matrix is measured between 3000
input modes and 7000 output modes (corresponding to
the desired foci). Oversampling is essential to reach the
highest fraction of optical power contained in a focused
spot. Dichroic mirror DM, combined with excitation filter
Fil1 and emission filter Fil2, separates and spectrally
purifies the fluorescence signal. Photomultiplier tube
PMT measures the overall intensity of the fluorescence
signal. Half-wave plate HW1 and quarter-wave plate
QW1 provide the two degrees of freedom necessary to
reach the purest circular polarisation state of the spatially
modulated signal at the input facet of the fibre.
Calibration module
A movable, compact calibration module is used to
acquire the TM of the fibre prior to image acquisition.
The TM is measured interferometrically using an external
phase reference. Being uniformly distributed, the external
reference prevents the formation of ‘blind spots’ origi-
nating from the speckled nature of internal references3.
Microscope objective OBJ and tube lens L5 image the
selected focal plane (spatially offset from the fibre facet)
onto the CCD camera with a demagnification of 27.7 fold.
The reference beam is collimated by aspheric lens L6 and
combined with the signal beam using nonpolarising
beamsplitter cube BS. Quarter-wave plate QW2 converts
the polarisation state of the output speckle patterns to
linear, and half-wave plate HW2 aligns the polarisation
axis of the reference signal in order to maximise the
signal-to-noise ratio of the interference patterns at the
camera. The microscope objective is mounted on a single-
axis translation stage for precise focusing and displace-
ment of the calibration plane with respect to the output
fibre endface.

Calibration methods
Binary-amplitude gratings based on the Lee hologram
approach allow the DMD to be employed as a spatial light
modulator in the off-axis regime28. The basis of input
modes consists of truncated plane waves of varying k
vectors. At the Fourier plane (focal plane of lens L2, Iris)
and at the input fibre facet, this basis corresponds to a
square grid of 65 × 65 focused spots. An alignment step
prior to the TM acquisition measures the transmitted
intensity by integrating the output speckle imaged by the
CCD detector for each input mode. This step reduces the
number of input modes to ~3000, since only those that
are incident on the fibre core are effectively coupled. The
basis of output modes consists of a square grid of 100 ×
100 points spaced by ~0.5 µm across the focal plane (i.e.,
at a certain working distance from the output fibre facet),
which are conjugate to pixels of the CCD detector during
the calibration procedure. Only ~7000 output modes
falling within a circular area of Ø50 µm are scanned
during the image acquisition, at the maximum refresh rate
of the DMD.
Focus quality
Here, we estimate the maximum reachable power ratio
PR – the ratio of power stored in the optimised focus and
the total power leaving the output facet of the MMF. We
assume that the optical system contains a set of N random
orthogonal modes, conserves the polarisation of light and
does not absorb optical power. Furthermore, we assume
that we can provide a perfect phase-only modulation of
the required field. The optimal field leading to the gen-
eration of a perfect focus can be expressed as an N-
dimensional vector f of the complex magnitudes of the
input modes in any convenient representation (e.g., focal
points at the input facet or plane waves of different k
vectors truncated at the DMD) having the real and ima-

Hence, we obtain PR ¼ π

number of modes supported by the optical system.
Unlike the PR, which indicates the power balance of the
focus, the enhancement factor, commonly used in highly
scattering random media, describes the ratio between the
intensity of the optimal focus and the randomly dis-
tributed background. By considering the convenient basis
of orthogonal focal points distributed across the input and
output facet of the fibre, we can assume that each mode
occupies the same area. Therefore, the intensity of each
mode is proportional to its power. Since the fraction of
total power stored in the optimised mode is given by PR,
the combined power of all remaining (nonoptimised)
modes is given as 1-PR, and their average intensity is

Short segments of MMFs and the modulation provided
by the DMD fulfil the assumptions of this evaluation very
well. Although the DMD only allows for binary-amplitude
modulation, when used in the off-axis regime as a Lee
hologram to generate signals within an isolated zone of
the Fourier space, from the perspective of PR and ς, it is
fully analogous to phase-only modulation, as numerous
generated diffraction orders occur far from the isolated
zone and do not contaminate the required optical field.
Using only one circular polarisation that is well conserved
during propagation, the MMF used in this study supports
approximately 1050 modes, leading to a maximum
enhancement factor ς of approximately 3800.
Animals
Data were acquired from 5 adult mice (5-6 months old).
In 4 mice, a subpopulation of inhibitory neurons,
somatostatin-expressing (SST) neurons, was labelled with
a red fluorescent marker (tdTomato) using a Cre-driver
transgenic mouse line: Sst < tm2.1(cre)Zjh > (SST-Cre)
[RRID:IMSR_JAX:013044]
(Jackson
Laboratory,
ME,
USA) crossbred with Rosa-CAG-LSL-tdTomato [RRID:
IMSR_JAX:007914]
mice.
In
1
mouse,
another
subpopulation of inhibitory neurons, VIP neurons, was
labelled with the same red fluorescent marker (tdTomato)
using a Cre-driver transgenic mouse line: Vip < tm1(cre)
Zjh > (VIP-Cre)
[RRID:IMSR_JAX:010908]
(Jackson
Laboratory, ME, USA) cross-bred with Rosa-CAG-LSL-
tdTomato [RRID:IMSR_JAX:007914] mice. The animals
were housed in groups (typically 2–4 mice), and both
male and female mice were used for the experiments. All
procedures were approved by the University of Edinburgh
Animal Welfare Committee and were performed under a
UK Home Office project license.
Surgical procedures
For craniotomy, mice were anaesthetised with iso-
flurane (4% for induction and 1–2% maintenance during
surgery and imaging) and mounted on a stereotaxic frame
(David Kopf Instruments, CA, USA). Eye cream was
applied to protect the eyes (Bepanthen, Bayer, Germany),
analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs were injected
subcutaneously (Vetergesic, buprenorphine, 0.1 mg/kg of
body weight; carprofen, 0.15 mg; dexamethasone, 2 µg). A
section of scalp was removed, and the underlying bone
was cleaned before a craniotomy (approximately 2 × 2
mm) was made over the left primary visual cortex (V1, 2.5
mm lateral and 0.5 mm anterior to lambda). Cyanoacry-
late glue (Locktite, UK) was applied to the surrounding
skull, muscle, and wound margins to prevent further
bleeding.
In vivo imaging
The in vivo imaging stage, placed below the fibre,
consisted of a custom-made frame with ear bars to hold
the animal’s head position fixed during the imaging pro-
cedure and a fitted face mask for the delivery of isoflurane
anaesthesia (1–2%). A suitable body temperature was
maintained via a thermal bandage. The stage was moun-
ted on a three-axis motorised translation stage with servo-
driven actuators (ThorLabs, USA), allowing precise posi-
tioning of the animal both laterally for targeting the cra-
niotomy and axially for controlling the fibre penetration
process. The endoscopic fibre probe was gradually low-
ered into the craniotomy, up to 3 mm into the brain tis-
sue, targeting deep cortical layers in V1 and ventrally
through the hippocampus to the base of the brain. Images
were collected at ~3.5 frames/s from multiple regions
throughout the tissue.
At the end of the imaging session, the animals were
given an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (240 mg/kg)
prior to transcardial perfusion with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed
brains were then extracted, and 50-µm-thick coronal
sections were cut with a vibratome (Leica, Germany) to
confirm the location of the fibre tract.
