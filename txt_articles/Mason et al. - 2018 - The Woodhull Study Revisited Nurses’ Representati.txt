Abstract
Purpose: To determine if nurses are represented in health news stories more 
frequently today than 20 years ago when Sigma Theta Tau International Nurs-
ing Honorary Society published The Woodhull Study on Nursing and the Media, 
which found that nurses were cited as sources in only 4% of the stories.
Design: Content analysis of health news stories for the month of Sep-
tember 2017 in the same publications used in the original Woodhull study.
Methods: Searches with Nexis and Webhose identified 2,243 articles re-
lated to health care published by the news outlets in September 2017. A 
random sample of 537 of these articles was obtained: 258 from seven 
newspapers, 127 from three weekly newsmagazines, and 152 from three 
health industry publications. After removing irrelevant articles or those 
with only passing references to health, 365 articles were reviewed and 
coded, using the original study’s coding schema.
Findings: Nurses were identified as the source of only 2% of quotes in 
the articles and were never sourced in stories on health policy. When quoted, 
nurses mainly commented on the profession itself. Nurses or the nursing 
profession were mentioned in 13% of the articles. Nurses were identified 
in 4% of photographs or other images that accompanied the articles.
Conclusions: Nurses remain invisible in health news media, despite their 
increasing levels of education, unique roles, and expertise.
Clinical Relevance: Nurses’ clinical expertise is accompanied by unique per-
spectives on health, illness, and health care; but the public is not benefiting 
from the wisdom and insight that nurses can provide in health news stories.

been documented on improving the education of nurses, 
removing barriers to full practice authority by advanced 
practice nurses, and increasing the number of nurses 
appointed to boards and other policy- 
related entities 
(Future of Nursing: Campaign for Action, 2018).
Given these advancements, are nurses being recog-
nized as experts on health, health care, and policy 
more frequently than in the past? To what extent 
has nurses’ representation in health news media 
improved over the past 20 years? This article presents 
the findings of a replication of the original Woodhull 
study.
Background
News media play an important role in setting the 
agenda for the public and policymakers (Gardner, 
Glickstein, & Mason, 2016; McCombs & Shaw, 1972). 
The news determines what issues people think about 
and how they think about them (McCombs & Reynolds, 
2009). The agenda- 
setting role of media is represented 
in the selection of topics to be covered. Issues that 
are seldom covered in the news are often absent 
from the public discourse. ”Framing” includes topic 
selection but goes beyond agenda setting. It entails 
the way a journalist organizes, presents, and assigns 
meaning to an issue, thus providing people with a 
way to think about it (Entman, 1993; Scheufele & 
Tewksbury, 2007).
A particular interpretation of an issue can be embed-
ded in the minds of the public by multiple replications 
of a frame that uses words and symbols connected 
with cultural associations familiar to many of the 
recipients (Entman, Matthes, & Pellicano, 2009). Framing 
becomes a powerful tool to shape how society thinks 
about an issue.
Framing of a news story can start with the editor 
who assigns a story to a journalist, but the sources 
the journalist relies upon can shape that frame. Sources 
often reflect the larger power dynamic of society, and 
sources in positions of authority may lend credibility 
to a news story (Berkowitz, 2009). When reporters 
rely on such sources repeatedly, these sources will be 
more likely to get their voices into the news and can 
have substantial power over how issues are framed.
Berkowitz (2009, p. 109) asks, ”Who gets a voice 
[in the media]?” Women have long been underrep-
resented as sources in news media. The Global Media 
Monitoring Project has tracked women’s representation 
in news media in newspapers, television, and radio 
since 1995, and more recently, in online media, in 
an increasing number of countries (World Association 
for Christian Communication, 2015). In 1995, the 
Project reported that women were represented in 17% 
of news stories; in 2015, this percentage had increased 
to only 24%.
Nursing remains 90% women. Does nurses’ repre-
sentation as sources in health news parallel women’s 
representation in general news?
In the 1990s, Nancy Woodhull, a founding editor 
of USA Today, was an internationally known advocate 
for diversity in news coverage concerned about women’s 
underrepresentation (Sieber, Powers, Baggs, Knapp & 
Sileo, 1998). She became interested in nurses’ repre-
sentation in health news after a nurse was instrumental 
in Woodhull being correctly diagnosed with lung cancer 
in 1996 (William Watson, personal communication, 
May 28, 2018). Woodhull had been involved in design-
ing studies of women’s representation in news media 
and worked with Junior Bridge, a communications 
consultant, to use a similar design for a study of nurses’ 
representation in health news media. Woodhull died 
in April 1997, before the study was completed.
The 1997 Woodhull study was conducted at the 
University of Rochester School of Nursing and directed 
by Bridges, then Dean Sheila Ryan, and faculty mem-
ber Jane Kirschling. They worked with nursing stu-
dents to analyze health news articles published in 
September 1997 in leading print publications: 1,709 
articles from two national and five regional news-
papers, 142 from four weekly news magazines, and 
381 from five healthcare industry trade publications. 
Nurses were identified as sources in only 4% of all 
quotations or other sourcing in newspaper stories, 
and in 1% of those in stories from news magazines 
and industry publications. Physicians and dentists were 
sources in 43% of newspaper articles, 30% of news 
magazines, and 18% of industry articles. In addition 
to examining the extent to which nurses were quoted 
in healthcare articles, the study also examined how 
often nurses or the nursing profession were men-
tioned. Nurses were mentioned in only 10% of news-
paper articles, 2% of weekly news magazines, and 
8% of industry articles. They were never included 
in stories about policy. Nurses were identified in less 
than 1% of photos and images that accompanied 
newspaper stories. Women, whether nurses or not, 
provided only 25% of the quotations.
After the study was published, STTI responded to 
the report’s recommendations by disseminating the find-
ings at its regional meetings at which local journalists 
were invited to comment. STTI also developed a media 
experts directory to provide journalists with source for 
identifying nurse experts on a variety of topics.

rooms has increased (Women’s Media Center, 2017)

and as the Future of Nursing report (IOM, 2011) has 
elevated awareness of the importance of nurses to 
transforming health care, we sought to replicate the 
original Woodhull study to examine whether nurses’ 
representation in health news media has improved. 
Specifically, we sought to answer the following ques-
tion: Are nurses represented as sources and identified 
in photos in health news stories in public and trade 
print publications with greater frequency than in 1997?
Methods
The original Woodhull study was designed to analyze 
the portrayal of nurses and nursing in healthcare- 
related news coverage (e.g., stories about the business 
of health care, healthcare responses to disease out-
breaks, managing care for AIDs patients, health policy, 
workforce issues, etc.) in newspapers, newsmagazines, 
and healthcare industry trade publications. The present 
study replicated this design as closely as possible.
Sample Selection
For the current study, we collected healthcare- 
related 
articles from the same news outlets used by the origi-
nal study 20 years earlier, except those that were no 
longer being published (Healthplan, Business & Health), 
or for which online archives were difficult to obtain 
(BusinessWeek, now Bloomberg BusinessWeek).
In the original Woodhull study, coders read print 
copies of the selected news outlets and identified 
healthcare- 
related articles by hand. For the current 
study, we used key word searches to identify healthcare- 
related articles, and then coded a random sample of 
those articles (excluding those that were found to be 
irrelevant).
We used the Nexis newspaper database to conduct 
a keyword search for articles published in September 
2017 in the following U.S. newspapers: Chicago Tribune, 
The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, The Indianapolis Star, 
The New York Times, Tampa Bay Times (formerly The 
St. Petersburg Times), The Seattle Times, and USA Today.
We then used Webhose, a news webscraping tool, 
to collect stories from the following magazines and 
healthcare industry publications: U.S. News & World 
Report, Newsweek, Time, Modern Healthcare, American 
Medical Association Wire (formerly American Medical News), 
and Hospitals & Health Networks.
In Nexis, we searched for articles that were tagged 
with a healthcare subject, or included related key 
words. In Webhose, we searched for articles that con-
tained healthcare- 
related key words. These key words 
included terms such as healthcare, health care, patient 
care, health insurance, outpatient, medical, medicine, 
hospital, and diseases.
In order to generate a robust sample for each type 
of publication, we arranged the articles in chronological 
order, and then selected a random 20% sample of news-
papers (selecting every fifth article), 20% sample of 
magazines (selecting every fifth article), and 50% sample 
of healthcare industry publications (selecting every other 
article, as this type of publication had the fewest 
articles).
The study team divided the articles into three groups 
by publication type. We removed from the sample 
irrelevant articles and articles that made only passing 
references to health or health care. For example, we 
excluded an article primarily about federal policy to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants 
that also mentioned political plans to ”repeal and 
replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), President Barack 
Obama’s signature health plan“ (Friedman, 2017).
Coding and Analysis
We used the same coding variables from the 1997 
study, which were the type and subject of the article, 
the profession and gender of speakers, and the number 
of times nurses were referenced or mentioned without 
being quoted. We also recorded the number of quotes 
per article for all professionals that were quoted. In order 
to identify nurses, we examined speakers’ descriptions, 
titles, as well as any nursing credentials (e.g., RN, NP).
Before beginning the coding process, one of the 
original researchers from the 1997 study read and 
analyzed a subsample of the current articles, as did 
the current coding team, and they compared results.
The current coding team then established intercoder 
reliability with Krippendorff’s alpha using an iterative 
method (Altheide, 1987) of reading subsamples of 
articles and coding them until we reached an accept-
able level of agreement among the coders (Krippendorff’s 
alpha > .8 for all variables; Krippendorff, 2008).
Another researcher conducted an additional qualita-
tive analysis of a random sample of 60 articles in 
order to identify stories where the topics under dis-
cussion were relevant to nurses’ expertise and clinical 
experience, but nurses were not used as sources.
We also analyzed the photos and other images that 
accompanied relevant articles from the sample accord-
ing to the coding variables from the original study. 
The photo coding variables included the gender and 
profession or role of the individuals pictured. Photos 
that were unrelated to health or health care were 
excluded. For articles featuring more than one photo 
or image, only the first image that appeared was coded.

After one trained coder analyzed all the relevant pho-
tos, a second coder on the team reviewed the codes 
and noted any disagreements. The full coding team 
then met to resolve the disagreements.
For the comparison of the 1997 and 2017 data on 
using nurses as sources for quotations, we used a 
two- 
tailed difference in proportions test.
Results
A total of 2,243 healthcare- 
related articles were 
extracted from the search of news outlets, including 
1,285 from newspapers, 646 from magazines, and 322 
from healthcare industry publications. After taking a 
random sample of articles, our sample consisted of 258 
articles from seven newspapers (20% sample), 127 arti-
cles from three newsmagazines (20% sample), and 152 
articles from three healthcare industry publications (50% 
sample), for a final sample of 537 articles. After remov-
ing irrelevant articles and those with only passing ref-
erences to health or health care, the final sample for 
the study was composed of 365 articles that met the 
criteria for analysis (152 newspaper articles, 53 magazine 
articles, and 160 healthcare industry articles).
The vast majority of healthcare stories were straight 
news articles (84%). The remaining stories were com-
mentaries, including op- 
eds and columns (8%), editorials 
(4%), letters to the editor (3%), and blogs (1%).
Topics in Healthcare News
Figure 1 presents the most common topics covered 
in the articles we sampled. Almost one in three health-
care stories focused on some aspect of healthcare policy 
(31%). Much of the news about healthcare policy at 
this time was centered on efforts to reform or repeal 
the ACA (76% of policy articles). During the time period 
we studied, a Senate bill proposed by Senators Lindsey 
Graham and Bill Cassidy generated a high volume of 
news coverage, particularly in newspapers and news-
magazines. A contentious political issue, healthcare 
reform showed up in both news and opinion pieces 
(68% of news and 32% of opinion). Indeed, the major-
ity of editorials and letters to the editor in our sample 
were about efforts to reform the ACA (69% of editorials 
and 64% of letters to the editor).
Public health issues were another common topic for 
healthcare stories during this time, especially in news-
papers and newsmagazines (18% of articles in news-
papers, 21% of those in magazines, and 8% of those 
in healthcare publications). In addition to coverage of 
issues such as disease outbreaks and vaccines, a number 
of stories reported on the public health ramifications 
of hurricanes and tropical storms in the United States 
and the nearby Caribbean. Stories in the aftermath 
of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria discussed the 
disaster responses by healthcare systems and facilities 
and the consequences on vulnerable patient popula-
tions, such as the elderly.
Coverage in healthcare industry publications had a 
particular focus on healthcare quality (16% of articles 
in healthcare publications vs. 9% of articles in both 
newspapers and magazines). There were several stories, 
for example, that discussed the merits of different 
quality metrics and reporting systems and their effects 
on patient care. Healthcare industry publications were 
also more likely to publish stories about the business 
of health care, with reporting on acquisitions and 
investments affecting for- 
profit hospital systems, medi-
cal centers, and the like (15% of articles in healthcare 
publications vs. 5% of those in newspapers and 2% 
of those in magazines).

Gender in Healthcare News
Men were quoted approximately twice as often as 
women in healthcare stories (66% vs. 34% of quotes) 
and were particularly dominant as sources in stories 
about healthcare management, the business of health 
care, health policy, and healthcare costs and finances 
(Figure 2).
Men were also more likely to author healthcare 
stories: among articles with bylines, 52% were written 
by men, 42% by women, and 6% by both men and 
women. Men were especially likely to write articles 
about healthcare policy, healthcare management, and 
the pharmaceutical industry, while women were more 
likely to write articles about healthcare professions, 
public health topics, and human interest topics (such 
as profiles of individuals or personal health tips). Female 
authors were somewhat more likely to include women 
as sources in their articles: in articles written by women, 
39% of the sources were women, compared to 32% 
of sources in articles by men.
Sources in Healthcare News
As in the 1997 study, we examined which groups 
of key stakeholders were quoted in healthcare news. 
In our sample, policymakers accounted for nearly a 
quarter 
of 
quotes 
in 
healthcare 
stories 
(24%), 
reflecting the focus on healthcare policy during this 
time. The majority of quotes from policymakers appeared 
in articles about healthcare policy, particularly the ACA, 
although a quarter of their quotes appeared in articles 
about other topics.
Physicians made up 21% of quotes in healthcare 
stories (13% in newspapers, 19% in magazines, and 
29% in healthcare publications). The majority of quotes 
from physicians came from individuals who were iden-
tified as being in some kind of leadership or executive 
role, such as medical directors or chief medical officers 
(70% of physicians). For example, one article quoted 
the medical director for the National Foundation for 
Infectious Diseases in a story about the particularly 
harsh flu season and need for flu vaccination.
Other sources that were commonly quoted included 
healthcare executives or administrators who were not 
identified with any clinical title (10% of quotes) and 
researchers working on healthcare- 
related topics (9% 
of quotes). Patients or their families accounted for 4% 
of quotes in healthcare stories. Other sources included 
paraprofessionals, other healthcare professionals such 
as psychologists, nonmedical hospital workers, and 
spokespeople for advocacy groups or foundations.
Nurses were identified as the source of only 2% 
of quotes in healthcare articles (2% in newspapers, 
2% in magazines, and 1% in healthcare publications). 
Only eight articles in total included quotes from nurses,

and these articles appeared exclusively in straight news 
articles—nurses’ voices did not appear in any opinion 
pieces.
When nurses were quoted, they mainly commented 
on the nursing profession itself, and were rarely used 
as sources based on their expertise or knowledge of 
broader healthcare topics. Most of the quotes from 
nurses were along the lines of comments from Pam 
Cipriano, President of the American Nurses Association, 
in an article about the workplace dangers faced by 
nurses: ”There has been an erosion of respect… . We 
have to dispel that notion that being assaulted is just 
’part of the job’. It is not“ (Dvorak, 2017). Like most 
of the quotes from nurses in our sample, Dr. Cipriano’s 
comments were focused exclusively on nurses’ experi-
ences. Several of these articles related to a controversial 
July 2017 incident in which Utah police arrested a 
nurse who refused to violate hospital policy in order 
to draw blood from an unconscious patient.
Nurses were only quoted about issues beyond the 
nursing profession in a handful of articles in our sam-
ple. An article that recounted Florida hospitals’ evacu-
ation efforts during a hurricane, for example, included 
quotes from a hospital’s chief nursing officers describing 
the process of implementing their disaster plan:
”‘We wanted people to have clear roles and 
understand who was responsible for what,’ 
said [Assistant Chief Nursing Officer Rebecca 
Smith]. They also had already identified which 
patients were at high risk for developing 
complications during transport. ’We were able 
to have seamless communication and have 
people ready for any conditions that the 
patients were experiencing’“
(Arndt, 2017). Nurses were never used as sources in 
articles about healthcare policy, or articles about health-
care management, the business of healthcare, or health-
care research.
We found there were numerous instances where 
nurses’ voices and opinions were absent despite the 
fact that their perspectives were highly relevant to 
the particular topics of discussion. An additional 
analysis of a random sample of 60 of the articles 
found that the perspective of a nurse would have 
been germane to the story in at least 33 of the 
articles. For example, for a story on potential cuts 
in funding for community health centers, a nurse 
could have provided views on what the cuts would 
mean for both staff and patients (Dickson, 2017). 
On policy articles that addressed potential cuts in 
insurance coverage under the ACA, a nurse could 
provide examples of what happens to patients who 
are uninsured or how patients benefited from the 
expanded coverage the ACA provided. Even articles 
on the business of health care could have benefited 
from including a nurse as a source. For example, a 
chief nursing officer could have provided insight into 
the changes in care delivery or other factors related 
to staffing and patient care in an article on the slowed 
rate of hospital spending (Barkholz, 2017). One story 
focused on Swedish Medical Center regaining its 
Medicare status after significant breaches in patient 
safety and oversight (Baker, 2017). Nurses had played 
a role in blowing the whistle on the problem, but 
none were included as sources for the follow- 
up story.
Discussion of Nurses and Nursing in Healthcare 
News
In addition to examining the extent to which nurses 
were quoted in healthcare articles, we also counted 
how often nurses or the nursing profession were men-
tioned. Nurses or the nursing profession were men-
tioned in 13% of healthcare articles (14% of those 
in newspapers, 4% of those in magazines, 14% of 
those in healthcare publications). Nurses were most 
likely to be mentioned in articles about labor or pro-
fessional issues in healthcare: nurses were mentioned 
in 57% and 44% of these types of stories, respectively. 
Nurses also were mentioned in almost one in three 
articles about healthcare quality (32% of articles), and 
one in four articles about education or training in 
health care (25% of articles).
Discussions of nurses and nursing were very rare, 
however, in stories about some of the most commonly 
covered healthcare topics. Nurses were mentioned in 
only 4% of articles about health policy (and, as men-
tioned above, they were never quoted in any health 
policy articles). Similarly, nurses were only mentioned 
in 3% of articles about the business of health care, 
and were mentioned in fewer than one in ten articles 
about healthcare research (9%).
When nurses were mentioned in healthcare articles, 
they usually were described in positive or neutral 
terms. In an article about the controversial arrest of 
a Utah nurse, for example, a hospital spokesperson 
commended the nurse, Alexandra Wubbels, for her 
conduct: ”[University of Utah Health] is proud of her 
decision to focus first and foremost on the care and 
well- 
being of her patient…. She followed procedures 
and protocols in this matter and was acting in her 
patient’s best interest” (Mele & Victor, 2017). In another 
article describing research on healthcare teams, the 
addition of a nurse practitioner and registered nurse

was described as improving the management of chronic 
conditions and reducing reliance on the emergency 
room (Aguilar, 2017).
However, of the 48 articles that mentioned nurses or 
nursing, there were a handful that contained negative 
or potentially problematic references to nurses, particularly 
in trade publications geared toward physicians. In an 
article in AMA Wire about the experiences of female 
physicians, for example, female physicians who were 
mothers reported being ”treated with disrespect by nurs-
ing and other staff” (Berg, September 21, 2017). In 
another article in AMA Wire about the role of bias in 
patient satisfaction scores, a female physician complained 
of being seen as a nurse by her patients: ”That prejudice 
exists and can get old after a while,” she added.
”I’m 11 years into my practice and I still get 
the question, ’Nurse, can you get my doctor?’ 
It has helped to have a few white hairs and 
an older face, but I continue to be called a 
nurse. It makes me wonder whether this bias, 
as opposed my competence, may sometimes 
influence my patients’ satisfaction scores”
(Berg, September 18, 2017). While these comments 
reflect valid concerns about gender bias toward female 
physicians, the assumption that to be seen as a nurse 
is inherently undesirable or degrading is likely an indi-
cation of stigma around the nursing profession.
Photos
Of the 365 relevant articles in the sample, 281 articles 
were accompanied by photos or other images. After 
removing photos and images that did not picture people 
and those that were not related to health care, 256 
photographs and images were included in the analysis 
(Table 1). Results of the content analysis paralleled the 
findings from the print media analysis. The healthcare- 
related photographs and images were dominated by the 
men (73%); women appeared in 48%. The most pre-
dominant roles or professions depicted in the sample 
included policymakers (34%), patients and families (25%), 
and unidentified clinicians (15%). Only 4% of the total 
sample featured photographs or images of nurses.
1997 Study Comparison
In 1997, researchers found that nurses were rarely 
quoted: they made up only 4% of quotes in newspapers, 
1% of quotes in newsmagazines, and 1% of quotes in 
healthcare publications. In September 2017, nurses 
accounted for 2% of quotes in newspapers, 2% of quotes 
in newsmagazines, and 1% of quotes in healthcare indus-
try publications. The differences in the 1997 and 2017 
data were not statistically significant. (The p values for 
a two- 
tailed difference in proportions test comparing the 
proportion of quotes by nurses in 1997 and 2017 were: 
newspapers, p = .25; newsmagazines, p = .66; and health-
care publications, p = .64.)
Discussion
News media are powerful shapers of what people in 
a society believe to be important and how to think about 
issues. Journalists’ sources have the opportunity to frame 
a story and provide an interpretation of ideas and events 
that can influence people’s beliefs and actions. In addi-
tion, sources who are identified or quoted in a news 
story are often viewed as authorities on a topic. While 
women have been underrepresented as sources in news 
stories, 
this 
has 
improved 
over 
recent 
decades. 
Unfortunately, the present study found that nurses’ expe-
riences as sources do not parallel those of women, in 
general. Twenty years after the original Woodhull study, 
nurses remain invisible in news media. Nurses are not 
quoted as sources any more frequently than in 1997.
In September 2017, nurses were identified as sources 
in only 2% of all quotations or other sourcing in 
healthcare- 
related articles from select newspapers, weekly 
newsmagazines, and industry publications, suggesting that 
nurses do not have many opportunities to frame news 
stories, despite their unique positions within the health-
care system, their breadth and depth of experience, and 
their holistic, patient- 
centered orientation. As in the 1997 
study, we found that quotes from nurses were more 
likely to appear in stories about healthcare quality and 
healthcare professions. The proportion of articles in which 
nurses were mentioned was also roughly similar: in 
1997 nurses were mentioned in 9% of healthcare news 
articles, and in 2017 they were mentioned in 13%.

There were some similarities in the distribution of top-
ics in the 1997 and the 2017 studies. For example, we 
found that healthcare industry publications were more 
likely than newspapers or magazines to publish articles 
about the business of health care in September 2017, 
and this was also the case in the 1997 study. Compared 
to the 1997 study, there was a higher proportion of 
stories about healthcare policy in September 2017, in 
large part due to Congress’ highly publicized efforts to 
reform or repeal the ACA. Nonetheless, nurses remain 
absent as sources from stories about healthcare policy.
In the original Woodhull study, physicians were the 
most prevalent source in healthcare stories, followed by 
policymakers. In our study, policymakers were the most 
frequently quoted, followed closely by physicians. This 
shift could be due to the high levels of coverage of ACA 
reform and repeal efforts at the federal level in September 
2017.
The original Woodhull study found that women 
accounted for 25% of quotes in healthcare articles. 
In our study, women comprised 34% of quotes—a 
modest increase, despite the fact that women are now 
dominating the student bodies of schools of journalism 
and their representation in newsrooms has increased 
(Women’s Media Center, 2017). In 1997, researchers 
found that men outnumbered women as article authors, 
a trend that continued in 2017.
While medicine and journalism have both increased 
the proportion of women engaged in these professions, 
nursing remains 90% female. The profession continues 
to be plagued by outdated stereotypes and is poorly 
understood. This was evident in a qualitative study 
of health journalists’ experiences with using nurses as 
sources (Mason, Glickstein, & Westphaln, 2018). Ten 
health journalists participated in semistructured inter-
views about the barriers and facilitators to using nurses 
as sources. An overriding theme was that biases about 
nurses persist among journalists, newsrooms, and public 
relations staff in healthcare organizations and universi-
ties. The journalists admitted to not understanding the 
roles, work, and education of nurses, and said that 
they often have to justify to editors their use of nurses 
as sources for stories. They don’t know how to find 
nurses when they need them, and nurses and nursing 
associations have not been proactive in pitching nurses’ 
research and clinical expertise to journalists.
Nurses are seldom referred to in health news stories, 
even though they may be germane to the topic and 
can add important perspectives, particularly about peo-
ple’s experiences with health, illness, and health care. 
They are almost never sourced in articles on policy, 
despite a growing number of nurses engaged in health 
services research and policymaking. Nurses can also 
speak authoritatively about the impact of policy changes 
on people, including what happens when patients have 
no health coverage. Even articles on the business of 
health care miss the perspectives of, for example, a 
chief nursing officer who likely manages the largest 
part of a hospital budget and can speak about the 
impact of business decisions by healthcare organizations 
on the well- 
being of patients and families.
Nurses are largely absent from photos and other 
images that accompany health news articles. Nurses 
may be the most trusted profession in years of Gallup 
polls (Brennan, 2017), but their invisibility in photos 
and as authoritative sources is troubling for the pro-
fession’s aim of ensuring that nurses are viewed as 
partners in transforming health care and have seats 
at all relevant decision- 
making tables.
Our study is limited by several factors. First, there 
has been a growth of new online- 
only news media, 
but we did not include any of these in our sample, 
since we only examined publications from the original 
Woodhull study. All of the news outlets we studied 
now publish online, and one of the outlets has tran-
sitioned to an online- 
only format (AMA Wire). However, 
examining the extent to which healthcare reporting 
on newer online- 
only news outlets differs from that 
in legacy outlets could be a vital area for future research.
Second, as with the original Woodhull study, the cur-
rent study took place over a 1- 
month period. Since dif-
ferent types of healthcare coverage may be more prominent 
in one month versus another, it is possible that the find-
ings—both in 1997 and 2017—would have been slightly 
different had other months been sampled. However, given 
the paucity of nurses’ representation in articles across a 
wide range of healthcare topics, it seems unlikely that 
the findings would have differed drastically in other months.
Third, nurses are likely represented more often in 
these news stories but they were not identified as 
nurses, so we could not count them. Most news 
media use The Associated Press Stylebook (Associated 
Press, 2018) that, until recently, called for using ”MD” 
or ”Dr.” for physicians, optometrists, podiatrists, osteo-
paths, dentists, and veterinarians; but the ”Dr.” title 
was not used for other clinicians with doctorates, 
including PhDs and DNPs. The 2018 stylebook permits 
use of the ”Dr.” title for others with PhDs or clinical 
doctorates but notes: ”However, because the public 
frequently identifies Dr. only with physicians, care 
should be taken to ensure that the individual’s spe-
cialty is stated in first or second reference” (Associated 
Press, 2018, p. 88). The new stylebook does not 
address ”RN,” and many media outlets will not use 
it or will say the person is a ”registered nurse.” 
Because space may be limited, journalists have reported

that they usually will use only the nurse’s official 
title (Mason et al., 2018). If the nurse is the chief 
executive officer (CEO) of a hospital, it is unlikely 
that the story will say that the CEO is a nurse. On 
the other hand, if the CEO is a physician, it is not 
uncommon to see ”MD” after the CEO’s name. The 
journalists interviewed in the qualitative study were 
not aware of the changes in the latest stylebook.
The original Woodhull study included a number of 
sound recommendations for nursing and journalists. 
STTI engaged in advancing some of these recommen-
dations immediately after the study was published. 
Yet, many remain relevant today. Ensuring that nurses 
become more visible in health news media will require 
concerted efforts, including nursing associations devel-
oping resource directories of nurses prepared to speak 
with journalists; healthcare organizations and universi-
ties offering nurses as clinical and policy experts; 
associations and universities being proactive in reaching 
out to journalists on new nursing research and other 
stories; educating journalists about the depth of clini-
cal and research experience of nurses on myriad top-
ics; and helping nurses to develop media competencies. 
A sustained effort will be necessary to ensure that, 
in 2037, a replication of the Woodhull study will 
not report that there has been no progress once again.
