IMPORTANCE Variations in thyroid function within reference ranges are associated with an
increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. However, the impact of thyroid
function on life expectancy (LE) and the number of years lived with and without CVD
remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of thyroid function with total LE and LE with and
without CVD among euthyroid individuals.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Rotterdam Study, a population-based, prospective
cohort study. We included participants without known thyroid disease and with thyrotropin
and free thyroxine (FT4) levels within the reference ranges.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Multistate life tables were used to calculate total LE and LE
with and without CVD among thyrotropin and FT4 tertiles. Life expectancy estimates in men
and women aged 50 years and older were obtained using prevalence, incidence rates, and
hazard ratios for 3 transitions (healthy to CVD, healthy to death, and CVD to death), adjusting
for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors.
RESULTS The mean (SD) age of the 7785 participants was 64.7 (9.8) years, and 52.5% were
women. Over a median follow-up of 8.1 (interquartile range, 2.7-9.9) years, we observed 789
incident CVD events and 1357 deaths. Compared with those in the lowest tertile, men and
women in the highest thyrotropin tertile lived 2.0 (95% CI, 1.0 to 2.8) and 1.4 (95% CI, 0.2 to
2.4) years longer, respectively, of which, 1.5 (95% CI, 0.2 to 2.6) and 0.9 (95% CI, −0.2 to 2.0)
years longer without CVD. Compared with those in the lowest tertile, the difference in life
expectancy for men and women in the highest FT4 tertile was −3.2 (95% CI, −5.0 to −1.4) and
−3.5 (95% CI, −5.6 to −1.5) years, respectively, of which, −3.1 (95% CI, −4.9 to −1.4) and −2.5
(95% CI, −4.4 to −0.7) years without CVD.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE At the age of 50 years, participants with low-normal thyroid
function live up to 3.5 years longer overall and up to 3.1 years longer without CVD than
participants with high-normal thyroid function. These findings provide supporting evidence
for a reevaluation of the current reference ranges of thyroid function and can help inform
preventive and clinical care.

 T
hyroid dysfunction is one of the most common endo-
crine disorders.1 Clinical thyroid dysfunction is char-
acterized by thyrotropin and free thyroxine (FT4) lev-
els outside the reference ranges, whereas subclinical thyroid
dysfunction is characterized by thyrotropin levels outside the
reference range combined with FT4 levels within the refer-
encerange.Atpresent,thereferencerangesforthyrotropinand
FT4 levels are statistically determined on the basis of the 2.5th
and 97.5th percentiles of an apparently healthy population.
This arbitrary approach, however, has been recently chal-
lenged by studies suggesting that the current reference ranges
of thyroid function may need to be reevaluated by addition-
ally taking into account the risk of clinical outcomes.2-5 In view
oftheongoingdebateonredefiningthereferencerangesofthy-
rotropin and FT4 levels, there is a need for novel insights about
the qualitative and quantitative effect of thyroid function on
an individual’
s life and health.
Thecardiovascularsystemrepresentsamajortargetofthy-
roidhormoneaction.6Bothclinicalandsubclinicalthyroiddys-
function have been associated with an increased risk of coro-
nary heart disease,7,8 heart failure,9 and mortality.7,8,10,11 These
deleterious effects of thyroid dysfunction might also be ex-
tended to the euthyroid range. Many studies conducted in
middle-aged and elderly euthyroid individuals have reported
an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortal-
itywithlowerthyrotropinand/orhigherFT4levels.2-5,12-16Other
studies do not find an association,17-19 probably due to the rela-
tively small proportion of events,17,18 insufficient sample
sizes,19 or short-term follow-up.17 However, it remains un-
clear whether there are meaningful differences in the remain-
ing years of life lived with and without CVD for individuals
within the reference range of thyroid function. Therefore, in
a large population of euthyroid participants, we aimed to
investigate the association of thyroid function with total life
expectancy (LE) and LE with and without CVD.
Methods
Study Population
This study was embedded within the Rotterdam Study, a large
prospectivepopulation-basedcohortstudy.Theobjectivesand
design have been described in detail previously.20 The Rotter-
damStudywasinitiatedin1989,including7983participants55
years or older. In 2000, the study was extended with a second
cohort of 3011 participants. In 2006, a third cohort of 3932 par-
ticipants 45 years or older was added. Study participants un-
dergo extensive follow-up medical examinations every 3 to 5
years.Weincluded7785participantswithoutknownthyroiddis-
ease,withthyrotropinandFT4levelswithinthereferencerange,
and follow-up data on CVD events and deaths. Detailed infor-
mation on the selection of study participants is provided in the
eMethods and eFigure in the Supplement.
The protocols of the Rotterdam Study have been approved
by the Medical Ethics Committee of Erasmus University and by
the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport of the Netherlands,
implementing the Population Study Act Rotterdam Study. In
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, all included
participants provided written informed consent to participate
in the study and to obtain information from their treating
physicians.
Assessment of Thyroid Function
Thyroid function was assessed during the third visit of the first
cohort(RS-I.3)andthefirstvisitofthesecond(RS-II.1)andthird
(RS-III.1) cohorts using the same method and assay. Measure-
mentsofthyrotropinandFT4wereperformedinbaselineserum
samplesstoredat−80°CusingtheECLIAelectrochemilumines-
cence immunoassay (Roche). The reference ranges of thyrotro-
pin (0.40-4.0 mIU/L) and FT4 (0.86-1.94 ng/dL; to convert to
picomolesperliter,multiplyby12.871)weredeterminedonthe
basis of national guidelines and our previous studies.21,22
Assessment of CVD and Mortality
Outcome measures were incident nonfatal CVD, fatal CVD, and
overall mortality. Cardiovascular disease was defined as the
presence of coronary heart disease, stroke, or heart failure.
Coronary heart disease was defined as coronary revascular-
ization (as a proxy for significant coronary artery disease),
fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, or fatal coronary heart
disease.23 Based on the World Health Organization criteria,
stroke was defined as a syndrome of rapidly developing symp-
toms, with an apparent vascular cause of focal or global cere-
bral dysfunction lasting 24 hours or longer or leading to
death.20,24 Based on the European Society of Cardiology cri-
teria,heartfailurewasdefinedasthepresenceoftypicalsymp-
toms and signs (ie, breathlessness at rest or during exertion,
ankle edema, and pulmonary crepitations), confirmed by the
objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction (ie, chest x-ray,
echocardiography) or a positive response to the initiated
treatment.25 Prevalent CVD was assessed at baseline through
interview and medical records. After enrollment, partici-
pants were continuously monitored for incident CVD through
linkage of the study database with files from general practi-
tioners and hospital records.
Information on mortality was obtained from municipal-
ity records, general practitioners, and reports of medical spe-
cialists. The underlying cause of death was ascertained inde-
pendentlyby2researchphysiciansandsubsequentlyvalidated
by a medical specialist.23 In the eMethods in the Supplement,
Key Points
Question Are there differences in total life expectancy and life
expectancy with and without cardiovascular disease within the
reference range of thyroid function?
Findings This population-based cohort study found significant
differences in life expectancy within the reference range of thyroid
function. After age 50 years, individuals with low-normal thyroid
function lived longer overall and longer without cardiovascular
disease than individuals with high-normal thyroid function.
Meaning These findings provide supporting evidence for a
reevaluation of current reference ranges of thyroid function and
can help inform preventive and clinical care.

tory, medication use, lifestyle, glucose and lipid levels, body
mass index, blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus.
Statistical Analysis
Total LE and the number of years lived with and without CVD
werecalculatedamongtertilesofthyrotropinandFT4,byusing
multistate life tables. Differences in LE were evaluated using
the lowest tertile as reference. Multistate life tables com-
bined information from participants in 3 possible health states,
namely, “free of CVD,” “CVD,” and “death,” Possible transi-
tions of participants were (1) from free of CVD to CVD (inci-
dentCVD),(2)fromfreeofCVDtodeath(mortalityamongthose
without CVD), and (3) from CVD to death (mortality among
thosewithCVD).Backflowswerenotallowed,andonlythefirst
event into a state was considered.26 To calculate LE, we
followed a similar approach to that of previous studies.27,28
Due to the known sex differences in LE, analyses were per-
formed separately among men and women. We first calcu-
lated the prevalence of thyrotropin tertiles among participants
withandwithoutCVD,categorizedin10-yearagegroups.Ineach
transition, we calculated age-specific incidence rates. Next, we
applied Poisson regression with Gompertz distribution to com-
pute hazard ratios (HRs) of the association between thyrotro-
pin tertiles and incident CVD or mortality. The confidence in-
tervals of LE estimates were calculated using the Monte Carlo
method with 10 000 bootstrap simulations.29(pp184-188) More-
over, we repeated the analyses for the FT4 tertiles.
Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders, which
were selected on the basis of biological plausibility and pre-
viousliterature.Model1wasadjustedforageandcohort.Model
2 was adjusted for age, cohort, smoking, alcohol intake, edu-
cation level, marital status, diabetes mellitus, body mass in-
dex,systolicbloodpressure,totalcholesterol,triglycerides,and
use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications.
Multipleimputationswereperformedincaseofmissingco-
variates (<5% for all covariates). Statistical analyses were con-
ducted using IBM SPSS, version 21 (IBM Corp); STATA, version
13 for Windows (StataCorp); and @RISK software (Palisade).
Sensitivity Analyses
Several sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) To account for
potential reverse causation, we excluded CVD events (n = 179)
or deaths (n = 293) that occurred during the first 2 years of
follow-up;(2)Weexcludedparticipantsusingthyroidfunction–
altering medications (ie, amiodarone and corticosteroids)
(n = 137); (3) To exclude any potential bias caused by pres-
ence of cancer at baseline, we additionally adjusted our analy-
ses for prevalent cancer at baseline; (4) To detect a potential
influence of follow-up duration on our results, we performed
the analyses restricting the length of follow-up to 8 years
(median follow-up time).
Toadditionallyexploretheassociationbetweenthyroidsta-
tus categories (ie, hypothyroidism, euthyroidism, hyperthy-
roidism) and LE with and without CVD, we extended the study
population,includingparticipantsoftheRotterdamStudywith
data available on thyroid function and CVD, without past thy-
roid disease, and not using thyroid function–altering medica-
tions (ie, thyroid medications, amiodarone, or corticoste-
roids).Participantswerecategorizedonthebasisoftheirthyroid
status. Euthyroidism was defined as serum thyrotropin levels
within the reference range. Hypothyroidism (clinical and sub-
clinical combined) was defined as high thyrotropin combined
withlowornormalFT4.Hyperthyroidism(clinicalandsubclini-
cal combined) was defined as low thyrotropin combined with
highornormalFT4.TotalLEandLEwithandwithoutCVDwere
calculated in men and women, among thyroid status catego-
ries, by using multistate life tables. Differences in LE were
evaluated using the euthyroid category as reference.
Results
Baseline characteristics of 7785 eligible participants are pre-
sented in Table 1. The mean (SD) age of participants was 64.7
(9.8) years and 52.5% were women. Over a median follow-up
timeof8.1(interquartilerange,2.7-9.9)years,789incidentCVD
events and 1357 deaths occurred. Both models yielded simi-
lar estimates; therefore, we further report the results of the
most adjusted model (model 2).

 Association of Thyroid Function Within the Reference Range
With the Risk of CVD and Death
The association of thyrotropin tertiles with the risk of inci-
dent CVD was not statistically significant (highest vs lowest
thyrotropin tertile: HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.79-1.11) (Table 2). Com-
paredwiththelowesttertile,thehighestthyrotropintertilewas
associated with a lower risk of mortality among participants
with CVD (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64-0.91) and without CVD (HR,
0.82; 95% CI, 0.67-1.01) (Table 2).
The highest FT4 tertile was associated with a 1.32 times
higher risk of incident CVD than the lowest tertile (95% CI,
1.10-1.58) (Table 2). Compared with the lowest tertile, the high-
est FT4 tertile was also associated with a 1.64 times higher risk
of mortality among participants with CVD (95% CI, 1.32-2.02)
and a 1.45 times higher risk of mortality among participants
without CVD (95% CI, 1.21-1.73) (Table 2).
Results for thyrotropin and FT4 analyses did not change
substantially after the events that occurred during the first 2
years of follow-up were excluded (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). Also, results remained similar after excluding users of
thyroid function–altering medications and additionally ad-
justing for the presence of prevalent cancer at baseline (eTable
2 in the Supplement).
Association of Thyroid Function Within the Reference Range
With Total LE and LE With and Without CVD
Total LE increased significantly from the lowest to the middle
thyrotropin tertile and did not change substantially from the
middletothehighestthyrotropintertile(Figure).Comparedwith
those in the lowest tertile, men in the highest thyrotropin ter-
tile lived 2.0 (95% CI, 1.0 to 2.8) years longer overall, of which,
1.5 (95% CI, 0.2 to 2.6) years longer without CVD and 0.5 (95%
CI, −0.5 to 1.4) years longer with CVD (Table 3). Compared with
thoseinthelowesttertile,womeninthehighestthyrotropinter-
tile lived 1.4 (95% CI, 0.2 to 2.4) years longer overall, of which,
0.9(95%CI,−0.2to2.0)yearslongerwithoutCVDand0.5(95%
CI, −0.5 to 1.2) years longer with CVD (Table 3).
Total LE decreased progressively with increasing FT4
tertiles (Figure). Compared with those in the lowest tertile, the
differenceinLEformeninthehighestFT4tertilewas−3.2(95%
CI, −5.0 to −1.4) years overall, of which, −3.1 (95% CI, −4.9 to
−1.4)yearswithoutCVDand−0.1(95%CI,−1.7to1.6)yearswith
CVD (Table 3). Compared with those in the lowest tertile, the
difference in LE for women in the highest FT4 tertile was −3.5
(95% CI, −5.6 to −1.5) years overall, of which, −2.5 (95% CI, −4.4
to −0.7) years without CVD and −1.0 (95% CI, −2.4 to 0.4) years
with CVD (Table 3). Results were consistent over the length of
follow-up of 8 years (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Association of Thyroid Status With Total LE
and LE With and Without CVD
Comparedwiththeireuthyroidcounterparts,hypothyroidmen
and women lived 0.3 (95% CI, −1.7 to 1.9) and 1.1 (95% CI, −0.4
to 2.3) years longer, respectively (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
ThedifferenceinLEforhyperthyroidmenwas−1.4(95%CI,−4.4
to2.0)years,comparedwitheuthyroidmen.However,thesere-
sults were not statistically significant. The difference in LE for
hyperthyroid women was 2.3 (95% CI, 0.2 to 4.4) years without
CVD and −1.9 (95% CI, −3.1 to −0.4) years with CVD, compared
with euthyroid women (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In a large prospective population-based cohort study among
middle-aged and elderly participants, we investigated differ-
ences in LE with and without CVD within the reference range
ofthyroidfunction.Participantswithlow-normalthyroidfunc-
tion lived up to 3.5 years longer overall and up to 3.1 years lon-
ger without CVD than participants with high-normal thyroid
function. Total LE in euthyroid participants increased from the
lowesttothemiddlethyrotropintertilebutdidnotchangesub-
stantially from the middle to the highest thyrotropin tertile.
TotalLEineuthyroidparticipantsdecreasedprogressivelywith
increasing FT4 tertiles. Overall, there were no meaningful sex
differences throughout thyrotropin and FT4 tertiles.
LE without CVD is the resultant of 2 components: risk
of incident CVD (transition 1) and risk of mortality among

 and risk of mortality among participants with CVD (transition
3).Comparedwiththelowesttertile,thehighestFT4tertilewas
associated with a 1.32 times higher risk of incident CVD, mean-
inganearlierclinicalmanifestationofCVDandmoreyearslived
with CVD. However, participants with CVD in the highest FT4
tertile had an even higher risk of mortality (ie, 1.64 times
higher), which explains the decrease in the number of years
lived with CVD.
Our study confirms prior research, suggesting that high-
normal thyroid function is associated with an increased risk
of CVD and mortality, independent of traditional cardiovas-
cular risk factors.2-5 Most importantly, it extends the previ-
ousliteraturebyrevealingconsiderabledifferencesinLEwithin
the reference range of thyroid function. These findings pro-
vide supporting evidence for a reevaluation of the current ref-
erence ranges of thyrotropin and FT4 measurements, imply-
ing the possibility of an upward shift of thyrotropin and a
downward shift of FT4 reference ranges in middle-aged and
elderly people. Further investigations are needed to deter-
mine the clinically relevant normal range of thyroid function.
Overactivity of the thyroid gland is known to have a nega-
tive effect on overall health. Higher thyroid hormone concen-
trations have been associated with an increased heart rate
(chronotropic effect), myocardial contractility (inotropic ef-
fect), and hypercoagulability, which may further predispose
to CVD and mortality.6,30 Moreover, elevated thyroid hor-
mone levels can enhance oxygen consumption and produc-
tion of reactive oxygen species, which may subsequently in-
duceDNAdamageandcellapoptosis.31,32Also,elevatedthyroid
hormone levels can affect cognition, nerve conduction, and
bone mineral density, thus contributing to an increased risk
of dementia, polyneuropathy, osteoporosis, and death.33-35
However,thedeleteriouseffectsofhighthyroidfunctioncould
also be extended to the high-normal range of thyroid
function.2,36Therefore,theaforementionedmechanismscould
be additionally involved in the pathways linking high-normal
thyroid function to a reduced life span.
Other mechanisms can explain the association of low-
normal thyroid function with a prolonged life span. Low-
normal thyroid function may promote energy conservation,
which is necessary to adequately cope with acute and
chronic stressors.37 Low-normal thyroid function may also
represent a heritable phenotype of exceptional longevity. In
line with this hypothesis, Rozing et al38 observed lower cir-
culating thyroid hormone levels in middle-aged offspring of
nonagenarian siblings compared with age-matched con-
trols. In addition, decreased thyroid hormone levels in
nonagenarian siblings have been associated with a pro-
longed life span in their parents.39
Based on the negative feedback mechanism of the hypo-
thalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis, each individual is expected
to have a unique set point of thyroid function, with an in-
verserelationbetweenthyrotropinandFT4concentrations.Our
results were consistent with the feedback regulation because
high-normalthyrotropinlevelsandlow-normalFT4levelswere
both associated with an increased LE. However, LE in our par-
ticipants was more strongly associated with FT4 than with thy-
rotropin levels. Likewise, previous cohort studies have re-
ported a stronger association of adverse outcomes (including
mortality) with FT4 than with thyrotropin levels, particularly
within the euthyroid range.2,4,13,14,22,34 Likely, genetic deter-
minants and aging can modify the thyrotropin-FT4 set point
of the feedback mechanism among euthyroid individuals.40,41
Various genetic polymorphisms that affect serum thyrotro-
pin but not FT4 levels have been identified.41
In addition, we investigated the differences in LE with and
without CVD among thyroid status categories (ie, hypothy-
roidism, euthyroidism, hyperthyroidism). In line with the re-
sults of our main analysis, we found that hypothyroid partici-
pants lived longer than euthyroid participants. Among
hyperthyroid participants, we observed sex differences in the
number of years lived with and without CVD. However, these
results should be interpreted with caution, owing to the rela-
tively small number of participants with thyroid dysfunction
and their increased susceptibility to receiving treatment and
changing health behaviors over time. Future studies can ex-
plore more extensively the effect of thyroid disease on LE with
and without CVD.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population-
based cohort study that investigates differences in LE with and
without CVD within the reference range of thyroid function.
Strengths include the prospective study design, the long fol-
low-up period, and the large number of participants with ex-
tensive and detailed information on covariates and out-
comes. The large sample size allowed us to conduct multiple
sensitivity analyses, which provided consistent findings.
Events were adjudicated using standardized criteria.
Limitations
Several limitations should also be considered. The Rotter-
dam Study includes predominantly whites older than 45 years;
therefore, our findings require confirmation in other popula-
tions. Moreover, we lacked repeated measurements of thy-
roid function. Nevertheless, this is unlikely to have affected
our results, given that the normal range of thyroid function is
considered to be stable over time with a low intra-individual
variability.42 Furthermore, we did not have data available on
serum triiodothyronine levels. However, thyrotropin and FT4
represent the most relevant measurements of thyroid func-
tion in clinical practice. Due to the observational character of
our study, the possibility of residual confounding cannot be
entirely ruled out.
Conclusions
At the age of 50 years, participants with low-normal thyroid
function lived up to 3.5 years longer overall and up to 3.1 years
longer without CVD than those with high-normal thyroid func-
tion. Our findings support a reevaluation of the current refer-
ence ranges of thyrotropin and FT4 measurements, implying
the possibility of an upward shift of thyrotropin and a down-
ward shift of FT4 current limits in middle-aged and elderly
people. Future research is needed to replicate our findings and
elucidate the exact mechanisms underlying the LE differ-
ences within the reference range of thyroid function.
