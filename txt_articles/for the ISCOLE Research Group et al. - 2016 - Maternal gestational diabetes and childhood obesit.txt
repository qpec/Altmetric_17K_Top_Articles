Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The aim of this study was to examine the
association between maternal gestational diabetes mellitus
(GDM) and childhood obesity at age 9–11 years in 12 coun-
tries around the world.
Methods A multinational cross-sectional study of 4740 chil-
dren aged 9–11 years was conducted. Maternal GDM was
diagnosed according to the ADA or WHO criteria. Height
and waist circumference were measured using standardised
methods. Weight and body fat were measured using a portable
Tanita SC-240 Body Composition Analyzer. Multilevel
modelling was used to account for the nested nature of the
data.
Results The prevalence of reported maternal GDM was 4.3%.
The overall prevalence of childhood obesity, central obesity
and high body fat were 12.3%, 9.9% and 8.1%, respectively.
The multivariable-adjusted (maternal age at delivery, educa-
tion, infant feeding mode, gestational age, number of younger
siblings, child unhealthy diet pattern scores, moderate-to-
vigorous physical activity, sleeping time, sedentary time, sex
and birthweight) odds ratios among children of GDM mothers
compared with children of non-GDM mothers were 1.53

Conclusions/interpretation Maternal GDM was associated
with increased odds of childhood obesity at 9–11 years old
but this association was not fully independent of maternal
BMI.

Introduction
Childhood obesity has increased dramatically in both devel-
oped and developing countries [1]. It has been suggested that
prenatal, perinatal and postnatal environmental factors impact
childhood obesity [2]. Some studies have found that intrauter-
ine exposure to maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)
places offspring at increased risk of long-term adverse out-
comes, including obesity [3–12]. GDM, defined as any degree
of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during
pregnancy [3], is a common pregnancy complication affecting
approximately 1–28% of pregnancies in a survey of 173 coun-
tries, based on uniform diagnostic criteria for GDM [4].
Early research from the Pima Indian Study and the
Diabetes in Pregnancy Study at Northwestern University in
the USA provided initial evidence of an association between
maternal GDM and the risk of childhood obesity [5, 6].
However, other studies failed to find a clear association be-
tween maternal GDM and offspring obesity [7–12]. A recent
literature review indicated that this difference may be due to
the high type 2 diabetes mellitus risk in the unique Pima
Indian population and the specialised clinical population in
the Northwestern University study [2]. Furthermore, the ma-
jority of the previous studies are from high income countries,
with limited data from low to middle income countries; thus
studies that include children from multiple regions of the
world are needed.
Indicators of central obesity, such as waist circumference,
may better predict cardiovascular disease compared with adi-
posity measured by BMI [13]. However, limited data exist on
the association between maternal GDM and different indica-
tors of childhood obesity. The aim of the present study was to
examine the association between self-reported maternal GDM
and three indicators of childhood obesity (BMI, waist circum-
ference and body fat) in children aged 9–11 years from 12
countries around the world.
Methods
Study design
The International Study of Childhood Obesity, Lifestyle and
the Environment (ISCOLE) is a multinational cross-sectional
study conducted at urban and suburban sites in 12 countries
(Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Finland, India,
Kenya, Portugal, South Africa, the UK and the USA) [14].
These countries are classified as low to high income countries
according to the World Bank Classification (Table 1). More
details on the study design and methods can be found else-
where [14]. The Institutional Review Board at the Pennington
Biomedical Research Center (coordinating centre) approved
the overarching protocol, and the institutional/ethical review
boards at each participating institution approved the local pro-
tocols. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or
legal guardians, and child assent was also obtained as required
by the local institutional/ethical review boards before partici-
pation in the study.
Participants
A total of 7372 children aged 9–11 years participated in
ISCOLE. Of these children, 4740 remained after excluding
participants who did not have valid data/information on accel-
erometer (n=1214), maternal history of GDM (n=359), BMI
(n=5), waist circumference (n=4), percentage of body fat
(n=58), birthweight (n=383), gestational age (n=101), diet
scores (n=82), maternal age at child’s birth (n=134), mater-
nal current BMI (n=216) and other information (maternal
education and infant feeding mode) (n = 76). Participants
who were excluded did not differ in age or BMI z score but
there was a higher proportion of boys compared with those
who were included in the analysis. Data were collected from
September 2011 to December 2013.
Measurements
Demographics and family health history Maternal educa-
tion, current maternal body weight and height, maternal age at
child’s birth, child age, child sex, birthweight, infant feeding
mode, gestational age and number of younger siblings were
collected from parents or guardians by a demographic and
family health history questionnaire. Maternal education was
2340
Diabetologia (2016) 59:2339–2348
 classified into three categories: did not complete high school,
completed high school or some college, and completed bach-
elor or postgraduate degree. The child’s parents were asked
whether the child was fed breast milk or not, age when
completely stopped being fed breast milk, age when first fed
formula and age when completely stopped drinking formula.
These responses were classified into four categories: exclusive
breast feeding, mixed feeding, weaned from breast feeding
and exclusive formula feeding.
Maternal history of GDM Maternal history of GDM was
recalled by parents or guardians and reported on the question-
naire. Maternal GDM was diagnosed between July 1999 and
July 2004, inferred by the child’s date of birth. The diagnostic
criteria for GDM used in local maternity hospitals during this
period were identified by each study site. Maternal GDM was
diagnosed by the WHO or modified WHO criteria based on a
2 hr 75 g OGTT, or the ADA or modified ADA criteria based
on 3 hr 100 g OGTT [15, 16]. The WHO criteria for GDM
requires one plasma glucose test result of ≥7.0 mmol/l (fasting)
or ≥7.8 mmol/l (2 h) [15]. The ADA criteria requires two plas-
ma glucose test results of ≥5.3 mmol/l (fasting), ≥10.0 mmol/l
(1 h), ≥8.6 mmol/l (2 h) or ≥7.8 mmol/l (3 h) [16].
Dietary pattern A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that
was adapted from the Health Behavior in School-aged Children
Survey (HBSC) and validated [17–19] was administered to all
ISCOLE participants. The FFQ asked the participants about
their ‘usual’ consumption of 23 food categories, with response
options including: never, less than once per week, once per
week, 2–4 days per week, 5–6 days per week, once a day every
day, and more than once a day. Two diet pattern scores that
represented an ‘unhealthy diet pattern’ (with positive loadings
for fast food, hamburgers, soft drinks, sweets, fried food, etc.)
and a ‘healthy diet pattern’ (with positive loadings for vegeta-
bles, fruit, whole grains, low-fat milk, etc.) were obtained using
principal components analyses [18, 19].
Anthropometric measurements A battery of anthropometric
measurements was taken according to standardised proce-
dures across all study sites. Height was measured without
shoes using a Seca 213 portable stadiometer (Seca,
Hamburg, Germany), with the participant’s head in the
Frankfurt plane. Waist circumference was measured at the
end of normal expiration with a non-elastic tape held midway
between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest. Each mea-
surement was repeated and the average was used for analysis
(a third measurement was obtained if the difference between
the first two measurements was >0.5 cm, then the average of
the two closest measurements was used in the analyses) [14].
The participant’s weight and percentage of body fat were
measured using a portable Tanita SC-240 Body Composition
Analyzer (Tanita, Arlington Heights, IL). All outer clothing,
heavy pocket items, and shoes and socks were removed. Two
measurements were obtained and the average was used in the
analysis (a third measurement was obtained if the difference
between the first two measurements was >0.5 kg or >2.0% for
weight and percentage of body fat, respectively, then the average
of the two closest measurements was used in the analyses)[14].
Maternal and childhood BMI were calculated by dividing
weight in kilograms by the square of height in metres.
Childhood BMI z scores were computed using age- and sex-
specific reference data from the WHO. Waist circumference z
scores were computed using age- and sex-specific reference data
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III
(NHANES III) from 1988 to 1994 [20]. Body fat z scores were

 computed using the NHANES IV data from 1999 to 2004
[21]. Child obesity was defined as BMI z scores > +2 SD.
Central obesity was defined as waist circumference ≥90th per-
centile of NHANES III reference [22]. High body fat was de-
fined as body fat ≥90th percentile of NHANES IV reference
[21]. Maternal overweight was defined as BMI ≥25 kg/m2, based
on self-reported maternal current height and weight.
Accelerometry An ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer
(ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) was used to objectively mea-
sure moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, sedentary behaviour
and sleeping time. The accelerometer was worn at the waist on
an elasticated belt on the right mid-axillary line. Participants were
encouraged to wear the accelerometer 24 h per day (removing it
only for water-related activities) for at least 7 days including two
weekend days (plus an initial familiarisation day and the morn-
ing of the final day)[14]. Nocturnal sleep duration was estimated
from the accelerometer data using a fully automated algorithm
for 24 h waist-worn accelerometers, which was recently validat-
ed for ISCOLE [23]. The weekly total sleep time averages were
calculated using only days where valid sleep was accumulated
(total sleep period time ≥ 160 min) and only for participants with
at least three nights of valid sleep including one weekend day
[24]. After exclusion of total sleep time and awake non-wear
time (any sequence of ≥20 consecutive minutes of zero activity
counts), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was defined as
all activity ≥574 counts per 15 s and total sedentary time was
defined as all movement ≤25 counts per 15 s, consistent with the
widely used Evenson cut-offs [25].
Statistical analysis
Variables were compared using a t test for means and a χ2 test
for proportions between women with and without GDM.
Multilevel linear regression models were used to estimate the
association between maternal GDM and z scores of childhood
BMI, waist circumference and body fat. Multilevel logistic re-
gression models were used to estimate the association between
maternal GDM and the odds of childhood obesity, central obe-
sity and high body fat. We defined child as level 1, school as
level 2 and study site as level 3 for the multilevel analyses. Study
site and school were considered to have random effects. The
analyses were adjusted for maternal age at delivery (continuous
variable), maternal current BMI (continuous variable), maternal
education (categorical variable), infant feeding mode (categori-
cal variable), birthweight (continuous variable), gestational age
(continuous variable), number of younger siblings (continuous
variable), child unhealthy diet pattern scores (continuous vari-
able), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (continuous vari-
able), sleeping time (continuous variable), sedentary time (con-
tinuous variable), age (continuous variable) and sex (categorical
variable). The criterion for statistical significance was p<0.05.
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS for Windows,
version 21.0 (Statistics 21, SPSS, IBM, USA) or SAS for
Windows, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
The prevalence of maternal GDM and the diagnostic criteria
employed between 1999 and 2004 at the 12 study sites are
presented in Table 1. The overall prevalence of self-reported
maternal GDM was 4.3%, ranging from 1.9% in the UK and
China to 8.8% in Portugal. Characteristics of study partici-
pants by maternal GDM status are presented in Table 2.
GDM mothers had significantly older age at delivery than
non-GDM mothers (29.9 years vs 28.3 years). Children of
GDM mothers had significantly higher mean birthweight
(3415 g vs 3274 g), and significantly higher prevalence of
obesity (18.4% vs 12.0%), central obesity (16.0% vs 9.6%)
and high body fat (12.1% vs 7.9%) at age 9–11 years com-
pared with children of non-GDM mothers.
After adjustment for maternal age at delivery and educa-
tion, infant feeding mode, gestational age, number of younger
siblings, child unhealthy diet pattern scores, moderate-to-
vigorous physical activity, sleeping time, sedentary time, sex
and birthweight, children of GDM mothers had significantly
higher mean values for BMI z score (0.71 vs 0.54), waist
circumference z score (0.06 vs −0.02) and body fat z score
(0.17 vs 0.02) than children of non-GDM mothers (Table 3).
These significant associations disappeared after additional ad-
justment for current maternal BMI.
Table 4 presents the association of maternal GDM with the
risk of childhood obesity, central obesity and high body fat by all
GDM mothers or GDM mothers with normal weight or over-
weight. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios among children
of GDM mothers compared with children of non-GDM mothers
were 1.53 (95% CI 1.03, 2.27) for obesity, 1.73 (95% CI 1.14,
2.62) for central obesity and 1.42 (95% CI 0.90, 2.26) for high
body fat (Table 4). The positive association between GDM and
central obesity was still significant after additional adjustment for
current maternal BMI, but not for general obesity or high body
fat. In the multivariable-adjusted analyses, the positive associa-
tion of maternal GDM with the odds of childhood obesity and
central obesity were present among GDM mothers who were
overweight but not among GDM mothers with normal weight.
When stratified by maternal GDM diagnostic criteria, sex
of the child, level of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity,
unhealthy diet scores, sleep time, breastfeeding status and the
country’s income classification, the positive association of
maternal GDM with the odds of central obesity was only
present in girls and in children of mothers whose GDM was
diagnosed by the ADA criteria (Table 5). There were no sig-
nificant interactions between maternal GDM and diagnostic
criteria, the child’s sex, level of moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity, unhealthy diet pattern scores, sleep time, the
2342

 breastfeeding status, or the country’s income classification
with the risk of childhood obesity, central obesity and high
body fat (all p values for interactions are >0.05).
Discussion
In this multinational cross-sectional study, we found that ma-
ternal GDM was associated with increased odds of obesity
and central obesity in children aged 9–11 years old in 12
countries; however, these associations were not fully indepen-
dent of maternal BMI.
Early research in the Pima Indian Study demonstrated that
the offspring of Pima Indian women with diabetes prior to preg-
nancy and GDM were heavier at birth and had much higher
rates of obesity at age 5–19 years than the offspring of predia-
betic or non-diabetic women [5, 26]. In the Northwestern
University Diabetes in Pregnancy Study, diabetes during preg-
nancy, including both GDM and insulin-treated diabetes prior to
pregnancy, was associated with increased BMI of the offspring

 at birth and after 5 years of age [27]. However, other studies
failed to find a clear association between maternal GDM and
obesity in children aged 5 years or older [7–11]. One study
found that prenatal exposure to the metabolic effects of mild,
diet-treated GDM did not increase the risk of childhood obesity
[7]. Another study also found little association between maternal
glucose during pregnancy and obesity in offspring at 2 years
[10]. A systematic review of 12 studies reported that the crude

 odds ratios for the relationship between maternal GDM and
childhood overweight and obesity ranged from 0.7 to 6.3 and
the association was not statistically significant in eight of the
studies [28]. Most of these studies were conducted in high in-
come countries, with only one from a middle income country
[29]. Therefore, large studies using uniform methods to assess
maternal GDM and childhood obesity across various popula-
tions are needed to evaluate this question. Our study is the first
to evaluate the association between maternal GDM and child-
hood obesity using such widespread, multinational data. We
found that maternal GDM was associated with an increased risk
of childhood obesity among children aged 9–11 years from 12
countries. Moreover, our results indicate that the positive asso-
ciations between maternal GDM and the risk of childhood obe-
sity were significant among children from low to middle income
countries and between maternal GDM and an increased risk of
central obesity among children from high income countries;
however, these associations were no longer significant after ad-
ditional adjustment for current maternal BMI (Table 5).
Several prenatal and perinatal factors including maternal
prepregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain, maternal GDM
and child birthweight have been found to be associated with
an increased risk of obesity in offspring [2, 30, 31]. Previous
studies have demonstrated the significant association between
maternal GDM and an increased risk of childhood obesity to
be both independent of [32] and dependent on [33] maternal
prepregnancy BMI. Since maternal prepregnancy obesity is a
risk factor for maternal GDM [34], adjustment for maternal
prepregnancy BMI as a confounding factor or as a proxy for
genetic predisposition in the analysis of maternal GDM and
childhood obesity may be over-adjusted. The present study
found that the positive association between maternal GDM
and childhood obesity risk was only slightly attenuated by
birthweight and was not fully independent of current maternal
BMI. We used current maternal BMI (postpartum BMI at
about 10 years) but not maternal prepregnancy BMI in the
multivariable-model for three reasons: first, data on maternal
prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain were not avail-
able in the present study; second, a strong correlation (0.827)
has been shown between maternal prepregnancy BMI and
current BMI [35]; third, although current maternal BMI rep-
resents shared postnatal environmental factors, we still includ-
ed current maternal BMI in the final multivariable-adjusted
model (Model 4) which can partially control for the maternal
prepregnancy BMI effect.
Inconsistent associations have been found in studies that
assessed children at different ages. The Northwestern
University Diabetes in Pregnancy Study reported that the rel-
ative weight in children of GDM mothers increased dramati-
cally after 5 years of age, and that half of the children of GDM
mothers had a weight >90th percentile by age 8 years [6]. One
study in China found that maternal GDM increased the car-
diometabolic risk in early childhood at 8 years of age, but not
at 15 years of age [36]. Our study found that the children of
GDM mothers had 1.42–1.73 times higher odds of developing
obesity than children of non-GDM mothers at 9–11 years old.
A prospective pregnancy cohort from the UK reported that the
odds ratio of obesity among children of GDM mothers at 9–

 11 years old was 1.51 (0.76, 2.98), which is similar to our
study [37].
Waist circumference, BMI and body fat are the three main
indicators used to evaluate obesity. In the USA, the National
Institutes of Health clinical guidelines for the identification
and treatment of overweight and obesity among adults recog-
nise the importance of including measurements of both obe-
sity and central obesity, which are assessed by BMI and waist
circumference, respectively [38]. Some studies have
established that central obesity predicts obesity-related health
risk [39]. However, the majority of the available studies used
BMI, and few studies have included concurrent measurements
of waist circumference and body fat [11, 37, 40]. Our study
demonstrated a positive association between maternal GDM
and the odds of childhood obesity and central obesity; how-
ever, after additional adjustment for current maternal BMI,
this association was only significant for central obesity and
not for general obesity. Therefore, more studies are needed to
confirm the effect of maternal GDM on the risks of childhood
obesity and central obesity.
The mechanisms by which exposure to diabetes in utero in-
creases the risk of offspring obesity are not fully understood.
Exposure to maternal diabetes is associated with excess fetal
growth in utero, possibly mainly due to an increase in fetal fat
mass and alterations in fetal hormone levels [2]. In addition,
exposure to maternal diabetes results in elevated hyperglycaemia
hyperinsulinaemia and elevated leptin synthesis in offspring [2].
Maternal prenatal GDM may also influence the fetal epigenome;
thereby influencing the expression of genes that direct the accu-
mulation of body fat or related metabolism [2].
There were several strengths of our study including the
recruitment of a large multinational sample of children from
low to high income countries across several regions of the
world, the highly standardised measurement protocol, the
use of direct measurements whenever possible and the rigor-
ous quality control programme. In addition, body weight,
waist circumference and body fat were directly measured by
standardised methods. One limitation of the study is that it is a
cross-sectional study. Thus, we could not make cause-and-
effect inferences. Second, since data on maternal
prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain were not avail-
able, we were not able to assess the effect of these variables on
the association of GDM with the risk of childhood obesity.
Third, the information on maternal GDM status, current ma-
ternal body weight and height, infant feeding mode, gestation-
al age and child’s birthweight was recalled by parents in a self-
reported questionnaire, which may have introduced recall bi-
as. Although no specific assessment of validity of self-
reporting of these variables was carried out in the present
study, similar questionnaires have been used in a large number
of epidemiological studies. Finally, maternal GDM was diag-
nosed by different criteria across the different sites, which may
bias the results.
In conclusion, GDM was associated with an increased risk
of obesity among children aged 9–11 years; however, this
association was not fully independent of maternal BMI.
Furthermore, this study provided evidence for a long-term
effect of the different diagnostic criteria for maternal GDM
on the risk of childhood obesity.
