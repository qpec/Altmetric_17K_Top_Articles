Abstract 
49 
Background: It is thought that synovitis may play a role in producing symptoms in people 
50 
with hand osteoarthritis (OA), but data on slow-acting anti-inflammatory treatments are 
51 
sparse.    
52 
 
53 
Objective: To determine the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine versus placebo as an 
54 
analgesic treatment for hand OA.   
55 
 
56 
Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 12-month follow-up. 
57 
 
58 
Setting: 13 primary- and secondary-care centres in England. 
59 
 
60 
Participants: Of 316 patients screened, 248 participants (82% women, mean age 62.7 
61 
years) with symptomatic (VAS pain ≥4/10) and radiographic hand OA were randomized. 210 
62 
(84.7%) completed the 6-month primary endpoint. 
63 
 
64 
Intervention: Hydroxychloroquine (200-400mg) or placebo (1:1) for 12 months in addition to 
65 
ongoing usual care.  
66 
 
67 
Measurements: The primary endpoint was average hand pain during the previous 2 weeks 
68 
(numerical rating scale [0-10], NRS) at 6-months. Secondary endpoints included self-
69 
reported pain and function, grip strength, quality-of-life, radiographic structural change and 
70 
adverse events. Baseline ultrasonography was performed. 
71 
 
72 
Results: At 6 months, the mean hand pain (as measured by NRS) was 5.49 and 5.66 in the 
73 
placebo and hydroxychloroquine groups, with a treatment difference of -0.16 points (95% CI: 
74 
-0.73 to 0.40, p=0.57). Results were robust to adjustments for adherence, missing data and 
75 
use of rescue medication. There were no significant treatment differences at 3, 6 or 12-
76 
 4 
 
months for any secondary outcomes. On ultrasound, 94% (133/143) had ≥1 joint positive for 
77 
greyscale synovitis, 59% were Power Doppler positive. Baseline structural damage or 
78 
synovitis did not affect treatment response. Fifteen serious adverse events were reported 
79 
(hydroxychloroquine: 7 [3 defined as possibly related], placebo: 8).  
80 
 
81 
Limitations: Hydroxychloroquine dosage restrictions may have reduced efficacy. 
82 
 
83 
Conclusions: Hydroxychloroquine was no more effective than placebo for pain relief in 
84 
people with moderate to severe hand pain and radiographic OA.

Symptomatic hand osteoarthritis (OA) affects 4-31% of adults over the age of 70, and 3-15% 
93 
over the age of 60 (1-7). Individuals report chronic persistent pain and considerable difficulty 
94 
with daily activities (8). However there are few effective therapies for this condition and use 
95 
of these therapies is often limited by patients’ comorbidities or toxicities (9-11). Consequently 
96 
primary and secondary care physicians seek alternative options to improve quality of life for 
97 
people with this painful, disabling disease. Anecdotal reports suggest hydroxychloroquine 
98 
(HCQ) is one such therapy. It has been used as an unlicensed treatment in many countries 
99 
when other options have failed, mainly for the subset of patients with “inflammatory” hand 
100 
OA (12,13). HCQ is an established drug treatment for inflammatory arthritides such as 
101 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), supported by placebo-controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy, 
102 
as a monotherapy and in combination with other RA drugs, and acceptable safety profile 
103 
(14,15). With increasing evidence that inflammation is highly prevalent in OA and may have 
104 
a role in symptoms (16-20) and three small pilot studies suggesting reduction in hand pain 
105 
with HCQ (21-23), there is a rationale for exploring the efficacy of HCQ as a treatment for 
106 
hand OA.  
107 
 
108 
The objective of the Hydroxychloroquine Effectiveness in Reducing symptoms of hand 
109 
Osteoarthritis (HERO) Trial was to test the hypothesis that HCQ is an effective symptomatic 
110 
treatment when used in people with at least moderate symptomatic hand OA and inadequate 
111 
response to current therapies including NSAIDs and opioids.

Methods 
113 
Design Overview 
114 
The HERO trial was an investigator-led, pragmatic, multi-centre, superiority, randomized, 1:1 
115 
placebo-controlled trial. The research protocol (Appendix 1) was approved by Leeds East 
116 
Research Ethics Committee (12/YH/0151), the UK Medicines and Health Regulatory 
117 
Authority (MHRA) and registered on ISRCTN (ISRCTN91859104) in parallel. Participants 
118 
were recruited from September 24th 2012 until May 27th 2014, with participants followed-up 
119 
for 12-months post-randomization (follow-up completed April 25th 2015). Written informed 
120 
consent was obtained for all participants prior to screening. One participant was recruited 
121 
(24.09.2012) prior to protocol registration (17.10.2012), however no changes were made to 
122 
the protocol between these time-points and therefore this participant is similar to all other 
123 
trial participants. Full trial design details are available (Appendices 1-4). 
124 
 
125 
Setting and Participants 
126 
The trial involved 13 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England, with recruitment 
127 
taking place through primary care and secondary care-based musculoskeletal clinics. 
128 
Patients were eligible if aged ≥18 with self-reported, inadequate response or side-effects to 
129 
existing medication (including paracetamol, oral NSAID or opioid); moderately severe 
130 
symptoms (hand pain ≥4/10 on a 0-10 visual analogue scale) for more than half of days in 
131 
the last 3 months; fulfilled American College of Rheumatology criteria for OA (24); hand 
132 
radiographs in the past 5 years with changes consistent with OA; stable, no change to or no 
133 
use of analgesics (including NSAIDs) for at least 4 weeks or glucosamine or chondroitin for 
134 
at least 4 months; and capable and willing to give consent and adhere to the study protocol. 
135 
Exclusion criteria were inflammatory arthritis; psoriasis; CMC joint (CMCJ) involvement only 
136 
or predominant CMCJ pain; oral, intramuscular, intra-articular, intravenous steroids or other 
137 
anti-synovial agents or any new hand OA therapies during the last two months; intra-articular 
138 
hyaluronans in last 6 months; uncontrolled disease states where flares are commonly 
139 
treated with corticosteroids; serious uncontrolled medical condition; unexplained visual 
140 
 7 
 
impairment; pregnant or lactating; melanoma or non-skin cancer in the past 3 years, 
141 
significant haematological or biochemical abnormality (Appendix 4). Rheumatoid factor (RF) 
142 
and anti-CCP were measured in all eligible participants to exclude inflammatory arthritis.  
143 
 
144 
Randomization and Interventions 
145 
Patients were randomized to either hydroxychloroquine (200, 300 or 400mg, with dosage 
146 
calculated according to ideal body weight to give a maximum dose of 6.5mg/kg/day) or 
147 
placebo. Randomization (1:1) was computer-generated (PRISYM ClinTrial) in advance by 
148 
the contract manufacturer using random permuted blocks, without stratification. The contract 
149 
manufacturer prepared trial drug with over-encapsulation to create identical intervention and 
150 
placebo-control products with no involvement from the research team, and assigned 
151 
intervention and control drug packs in sequence to recruiting sites. All parties remained blind 
152 
to treatment allocation throughout the trial. Adverse events, vital signs and blood monitoring 
153 
were assessed on an ongoing basis during follow-up. All elements of participant care were 
154 
left to the discretion of the site research team in line with the pragmatic nature of the HERO 
155 
trial, with the exception that steroids and new or experimental interventions were not 
156 
permitted during follow-up. Adherence to trial medication was collected using multiple 
157 
methods to provide an estimate of compliance, including site-reported non-adherence, 
158 
participant-reported Brief Medication Questionnaire (25), and pharmacy records of returned 
159 
medication. Quality of adherence data was reviewed prior to unblinding to determine non-
160 
adherence criteria for analysis (Appendix 4). Participants were asked about adverse events 
161 
(AEs) at all visits and these were reviewed by a physician for severity, duration and 
162 
relatedness to investigational medicinal product (IMP). SAEs were defined according to pre-
163 
specified criteria, as detailed in the protocol (Appendix 1), assessed for causality and 
164 
expectedness by a physician and reported within 24 hours.   
165 
 
166 
Outcomes and Follow-up 
167 
Data collection was completed using standardized case report forms at screening, baseline, 
168 
 8 
 
3, 6 and 12-months. The primary outcome was overall hand pain severity over the past 2 
169 
weeks, measured on an 11-point (0-10) Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), at 6-months follow-
170 
up (26). This outcome was also assessed at baseline, 3 and 12-months.  Secondary 
171 
outcomes included: pain severity in the most painful joint (NRS over last 2 weeks), AUSCAN 
172 
pain and function scales (27), grip strength (measured using a dynamometer) (28), structural 
173 
damage using bilateral hand radiograph data (29), Osteoarthritis Quality of Life (OAQoL) 
174 
(30), and Short-form 12 (SF-12) Physical and Mental Component Score (31). Bilateral hand 
175 
radiographs (baseline, 12-months) were captured according to a standardized protocol 
176 
(Appendix 4) and scored in pairs at the end of the study by a musculoskeletal radiologist 
177 
who was blinded to participant identity and treatment allocation. Baseline ultrasound imaging 
178 
was performed for the dominant hand of all participants enrolled at the six ultrasound sub-
179 
study centres using a standardised protocol (Appendix 4) and following a group training day 
180 
for the ultrasound operators.  
181 
 
 
182 
A full list of secondary outcomes is described in Appendix 4 and Appendix Table 1. Cost-
183 
effectiveness data, collected at baseline and 12-months, will be presented in a separate 
184 
publication. 
185 
 
186 
Statistical Analysis 
187 
The HERO trial was powered to detect a standard effect size of 0.4, equivalent to the 
188 
reported effect size of NSAIDs as a treatment for hand OA (32,33) and a reduction in pain of 
189 
0.8 score points (or 15%) on the NRS (32,33) which lies within the minimal clinically 
190 
important difference for change in pain in a randomized trial (10/20%)(34). To detect a 
191 
standard effect size of 0.4 with 80% power and 5% two-sided significance, 99 patients were 
192 
required per arm. Allowing for 20% dropout and equal numbers per centre, the total target 
193 
sample size was 252 patients.  
194 
 
195 
 9 
 
The analyses followed a pre-specified statistical analysis plan, endorsed by the data and 
196 
safety monitoring committee, and were performed using Stata version 13 (StataCorp, Texas, 
197 
USA).  The statistician remained blinded to treatment allocation until verification of the 
198 
primary analysis. The primary analysis was intention-to-treat (ITT), analysing participants in 
199 
their randomization group. A linear mixed effects model was used to analyse overall hand 
200 
pain NRS over time. The model assumed an exchangeable covariance structure to account 
201 
for the repeated measures over time, and included fixed effects of time (3, 6, 12-months), 
202 
treatment group, time-by-treatment interaction, and the pre-specified covariates (baseline 
203 
hand pain severity, average grip strength, concomitant analgesic use, age, gender and BMI). 
204 
The model estimate of group differences at 6-months constituted the primary endpoint of the 
205 
trial. As the mixed-effects analysis model incorporated follow-up data from all available time-
206 
points simultaneously, participants with valid outcome data at one or more follow-up visits 
207 
and complete baseline covariate data were included. Secondary analyses explored 
208 
robustness to adjustments based on treatment adherence up to 6-months (binary, based on 
209 
self-reported non-adherence, treatment withdrawals and receipt of corticosteroids; analysis 
210 
using complier-average causal effect (CACE); implemented using instrumental variable 
211 
analysis (35)), ‘missingness’ (using multiple imputation by chained equations) and receipt of 
212 
rescue medication during follow-up (increased dose or addition of any NSAIDs, opioids or 
213 
paracetamol or steroid injection to the hand, added as a time varying covariate (36)), all 
214 
detailed further in Appendix 4. The primary analysis was repeated for participants with OA 
215 
confirmed by imaging. To account for deviations between intended and achieved follow-up 
216 
timing, predicted effects at 3, 6, and 12-months were obtained from a mixed effects model, 
217 
including time of response since randomization as a continuous variable with a random 
218 
slope.   
219 
 
220 
Planned sub-group analyses explored differences in treatment response for different levels 
221 
of structural damage (mild/moderate versus severe damage based on Kallman score tertiles) 
222 
and treatment differences in the presence/absence of ultrasound synovitis (assessed by 
223 
 10 
 
greyscale, Power Doppler and total synovitis) and osteophytes. Analyses were conducted by 
224 
adding an interaction term between treatment allocation and the sub-groups to the primary 
225 
analysis model. In the interest of planning future research, effectiveness was explored 
226 
across four further sub-groups that were hypothesised to affect the treatment mechanism of 
227 
HCQ, specifically average grip strength (low (<30lbs) and high strength (≥30lbs) based on 
228 
median strength at baseline) and presence/absence of thumb pain.  
229 
 
230 
Due to the large number of secondary outcomes, only outcomes of primary clinical interest 
231 
were analysed using mixed-effects models, giving treatment effect estimates and p-values at 
232 
each follow-up point. The remaining secondary outcomes were reported descriptively only. 
233 
 
234 
Role of the funding source 
235 
HERO was funded by an Arthritis Research UK Clinical Studies Grant (Reference 19545). 
236 
Arthritis Research UK were not involved in the study design, conduct, analysis, data 
237 
interpretation, manuscript preparation or decision to submit the manuscript for publication.

239 
Results 
240 
Of 316 patients screened, the HERO trial recruited 248 participants (74.5%, 124 in each trial 
241 
arm) with hand OA from 13 centres in England, while 68 patients were excluded (Appendix 
242 
Figure 1). Baseline characteristics (Table 1) were balanced across treatment arms. 
243 
Participants were on average 62.7 years old (SD=9.1), 81.9% women, predominantly of 
244 
Caucasian ethnicity and had been suffering with hand pain for a median of 5 years. Nearly 
245 
all participants (89.9%) were taking analgesic medication for their hand OA, and median 
246 
hand pain over the past two weeks was 7 points on the 0 to 10 NRS. Five participants had 
247 
raised Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and one had raised anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP). In 
248 
all six cases this was determined to be non-clinically significant by the site PI and not 
249 
indicative of inflammatory arthritis.  
250 
 11 
 
 
251 
Most participants (70.6%) were prescribed a 300 mg daily dose of investigational medicinal 
252 
product (IMP, HCQ: 85, placebo: 90, Appendix Table 2), with all but one participant 
253 
remaining on the same dose throughout the trial. Balance in participant characteristics was 
254 
maintained for patients included in the intention-to-treat analysis. In total, 45 participants 
255 
(18.1%, HCQ: 24, placebo: 21) were non-adherent to the treatment, which is likely to be a 
256 
conservative estimate, assuming unknown, unreported non-adherence. Non-adherers 
257 
tended to be slightly younger (mean of 61.2 years versus 63.0 years) with greater average 
258 
grip strength (36.1lbs versus 31.3lbs). Follow-up was 84.7% at 6-months and 76.6% at 12-
259 
months. A total of 134 participants (54.0%) received rescue medication during the trial 
260 
(HCQ: 63, placebo: 71).   
261 
 
262 
Primary Outcome 
263 
Hand pain severity improved for participants with observed data in both arms by around 1 
264 
point between baseline and 3 months, and this was maintained up to 12-months (Figure 1A). 
265 
Outcome data was not available for 20 patients at 3-months, 38 patients at 6-months and 58 
266 
patients at 12-months follow-up (Appendix Figure 1). A total of 232 participants (93.5%, 
267 
HCQ: 113, placebo:119) were included in the primary intention-to-treat analysis. Differences 
268 
in hand pain severity between treatment groups were small at each follow-up and not 
269 
statistically significant (Table 2; Figure 1A). At the 6-month primary endpoint, the treatment 
270 
difference estimate was -0.16 points on the NRS pain scale (95% CI: -0.73 to 0.40, p=0.57), 
271 
i.e. participants in the HCQ arm reported worse pain by 0.16 score points, equivalent to a 
272 
standard effect size of 0.07. The confidence interval excludes a clinically meaningful 
273 
difference in improvement of 0.8 scale points, on which the trial was powered. Improvements 
274 
of this magnitude or greater were reported for 58 of 107 patients in the HCQ group and 59 of 
275 
103 patients in the placebo group with NRS pain score reported at 6-months. 
276 
 
277 
 12 
 
Results were robust to secondary analyses of hand pain severity. When non-adherence was 
278 
accounted for, the treatment effect became positive (0.21 scale points in favour of HCQ). 
279 
While the 95% confidence interval remained wide (-0.44 to 0.86), the upper limit did include 
280 
the potentially meaningful clinical difference of 0.8 scale points (Table 2). When multiple 
281 
imputation was used to address missing outcome and baseline grip strength data, results 
282 
were comparable with the primary analysis of hand pain severity with similar confidence 
283 
interval widths (Table 2). Treatment effects of the analysis accounting for rescue medication 
284 
closely resembled those of the primary analysis of hand pain severity (Table 2). A repeat 
285 
analysis for participants with confirmed OA on imaging (n=171 of 182 with available imaging 
286 
data and analysis covariates) as well as estimates treating response time continuously 
287 
revealed no significant treatment differences (Appendix Table 3), with confidence intervals 
288 
excluding a clinically meaningful difference. 
289 
 
290 
Safety 
291 
A total of 15 serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by 15 patients (HCQ: 7, placebo: 
292 
8; Appendix Table 5). No deaths were reported. Of the 15 SAEs, three were assessed as 
293 
being related to HCQ: prolonged QT interval with ventricular arrhythmias, erythema 
294 
multiforme and acute generalised erythematous pustulosis.  
295 
 
296 
Secondary Outcomes, Subgroup Analyses and Ultrasound Findings 
297 
Hand pain and most self-reported symptom outcomes improved in the short term in both arms 
298 
and then plateaued over follow-up. Mental functioning outcomes, grip strength and structural 
299 
damage remained unchanged. There were no systematic treatment differences between HCQ 
300 
and placebo for any of the secondary outcomes (Table 3, Appendix Table 4). A difference of 
301 
borderline statistical significance (SF-12 physical component score at 12 months (p=0.053)) 
302 
could be spurious in light of the number of outcomes and timepoints assessed. 
303 
 
304 
 13 
 
Radiograph data at baseline, recorded as Kallman scores, were available for 188 
305 
participants (75.8%), 94 in each arm. Data tertiles were used to group observations into mild 
306 
to moderate damage (score 0-57) and severe damage (score 58-113). There were no 
307 
substantial differences between severity groups in response to treatment, and the value of a 
308 
group by treatment interaction term added to the primary analysis model was not statistically 
309 
significant (p=0.25; Figure 1B). A significant interaction term with treatment allocation 
310 
(p=0.033) indicated that participants with greater grip strength may benefit more from HCQ 
311 
treatment than weaker participants (Appendix Figure 2). A treatment interaction with 
312 
baseline thumb pain did not reveal meaningful group differences (p=0.136, Appendix Figure 
313 
3). As the latter two analyses were exploratory, results may be considered spurious. 
314 
 
315 
Baseline ultrasound images were taken for a subset of randomized participants (n=143, 
316 
57.7%; HCQ: 74, placebo: 67). The vast majority were positive for synovitis assessed by 
317 
greyscale (93.7%) and over half for synovitis assessed by Power Doppler (58.7%). 
318 
Osteophytes were present in at least one joint for all participants. There were no significant 
319 
treatment differences between participants with positive or negative Power Doppler status 
320 
(p=0.85 for the interaction term with treatment, Figure 1C). Meaningful sub-group analyses 
321

Conclusions  
325 
The HERO trial was designed as a pragmatic trial with a view to replicating anecdotal reports 
326 
of HCQ use in clinical practice, and powered to detect a moderate effect equivalent to that 
327 
for NSAIDs in this population. We found that HCQ was not a more effective analgesic than 
328 
placebo when added to usual care in people with moderate to severe hand OA. There were 
329 
no demographic differences in the patient population that might explain the lack of efficacy.  
330 
Background analgesic use did not differ between groups and baseline inflammation and 
331 
structural damage did not affect response to HCQ. The study therefore presents no evidence 
332 
 14 
 
to suggest that HCQ should be considered within the management plan of people with hand 
333 
OA. 
334 
 
335 
In terms of age, gender distribution and BMI, our population reflects that observed in recent 
336 
community-based cohorts of hand OA in the UK and Europe (37-40). We deliberately 
337 
excluded participants with isolated 1st carpometacarpal joint (CMCJ) involvement or 
338 
predominant 1st CMCJ pain, due to the potential differences in mechanism of disease 
339 
between 1st CMCJ and distal and proximal interphalangeal joint OA. Whilst just over half of 
340 
participants had concomitant thumb pain, in line with previous community studies (37-40), 
341 
this was not the primary site of their hand pain and no difference in treatment effect was 
342 
observed in those with or without CMCJ involvement. Consistent with recent imaging 
343 
studies, ultrasound-detected greyscale synovitis was common, with nearly all participants 
344 
having moderate grade synovitis in at least one joint. Power Doppler synovitis although less 
345 
common, present in just over half of participants, was not associated with treatment 
346 
differences. Based on the additional sub-group analyses, weaker grip strength may 
347 
predispose people to tenosynovitis or enthesitis, alternative causes for hand pain in this 
348 
population. This suggests a need to consider grip strength in this population when planning 
349 
further studies.   
350 
 
351 
A growing body of imaging and experimental evidence suggests a role for synovitis in the 
352 
pathogenesis of OA and an association with pain. Ultrasound-detected synovitis is 
353 
independently associated with radiographic progression of hand OA, painful hand joints are 
354 
associated with the presence of ultrasound- and MRI-detected synovitis, and response to 
355 
intramuscular steroids (thought to work by reducing synovitis) in hand OA is associated with 
356 
higher levels of baseline ultrasound-detected synovitis (19,41-44). However, in the HERO 
357 
study baseline synovitis was not linked to treatment effect. Our inclusion criteria may have 
358 
resulted in participants where the level and/or type of inflammation was not severe: a 
359 
previous study has suggested that early OA may be more inflammatory than established OA, 
360 
 15 
 
and that molecular pathways driving inflammation may change as the disease progresses 
361 
(45). By selecting participants with moderate to severe hand OA, established radiographic 
362 
changes and inadequate response to existing therapies, we may have missed an early 
363 
window of opportunity for HCQ to have therapeutic benefit.  
364 
 
365 
Hydroxychloroquine has various known immunomodulatory effects, and although 
366 
established as a treatment option in the management of inflammatory arthritides, its specific 
367 
mechanism of action remains unclear. In RA, therapeutic activity has been linked to 
368 
modulation of antigen-processing activity, including inhibition of T-cell activation and cytokine 
369 
release (46,47); increasing evidence of involvement of these pathways in inflammation and 
370 
cartilage degeneration in OA (48-50) supported HCQ as a potential OA therapy. More recent 
371 
data implicates intracellular toll-like receptors (TLR), in particular TLR-9, as key mediators of 
372 
HCQ’s anti-inflammatory properties, in line with growing evidence of the role of the innate 
373 
immune system in rheumatic disease. Although limited evidence suggests that the innate 
374 
immune system may be important in OA pathogenesis (51), for example increased TLR 
375 
expression in OA tissue (52-55), this work is still in its infancy. Further understanding of 
376 
these mechanisms in OA may enable stratification according to a defined inflammatory 
377 
phenotype.  
378 
 
379 
Other potential limitations to the study include restriction of HCQ dosing to the British 
380 
National Formulary recommended maximum dose of 6.5 mg/kg/day (56), with the majority of 
381 
patients taking 300 mg daily. In clinical RA practice, patients may commence HCQ at a 
382 
higher dose (400 mg), with reduction to a lower maintenance dose after 3-6 months. 
383 
However, only 5.6% of the HCQ group were on the lowest dose of 200mg and no dose-
384 
response relationship with treatment effect was observed. The co-occurrence of MRI-
385 
detected bone marrow lesions (BMLs) with hand synovitis has been found to worsen pain 
386 
and, as demonstrated in knee OA, may contribute to pain (57,58). Since BMLs cannot be 
387 
detected by ultrasound or x-ray, we were unable to examine BMLs in this study. The failure 
388 
 16 
 
of HCQ as an analgesic in this study may reflect the mild anti-inflammatory activity of HCQ, 
389 
suboptimal dosing, or that the level and/or type of inflammation in our population did not 
390 
match the mechanism of HCQ. However it is also worth considering, in light of the current 
391 
result and the previous failure of biologic DMARDs, that simply treating ‘macroscopic’ or 
392 
imaging-detected synovitis with DMARDs is not a useful analgesic strategy.  Further 
393 
exploration of the molecular mechanisms of inflammation in OA may provide targets and 
394 
better patient phenotyping may enable exclusion of other causes of hand pain such as 
395 
tenosynovitis.     
396 
 
397 
In summary, HCQ was not more effective than placebo in reducing symptoms or 
398 
radiographic progression in people selected for moderate to severe hand pain and 
399 
radiographic OA. Our findings in this full-scale pragmatic trial do not support the current 
400 
practice for the off-label use of Hydroxychloroquine in those with hand osteoarthritis.
