SUMMARY
Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with severe neuropathology in neonates as well as Guillain-Barre 
syndrome and other neurologic disorders in adults. Prolonged viral shedding has been reported in 
semen, suggesting the presence of anatomic viral reservoirs. Here we show that ZIKV can persist 
in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lymph nodes (LN) of infected rhesus monkeys for weeks after 
virus has been cleared from peripheral blood, urine, and mucosal secretions. ZIKV-specific 
neutralizing antibodies correlated with rapid clearance of virus in peripheral blood but remained 
undetectable in CSF for the duration of the study. Viral persistence in both CSF and LN correlated 
with upregulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), proinflammatory, and anti-
apoptotic signaling pathways, as well as downregulation of extracellular matrix and cell signaling 
pathways. These data raise the possibility that persistent or occult neurologic and lymphoid 
disease may occur following clearance of peripheral virus in ZIKV-infected individuals.

 Persistance of Zika virus in the CNS and lymphoid tissues of NHP suggest that ZIKV infection 
may have consequences to humans beyond the reported birth defects.
INTRODUCTION
ZIKV infection in humans typically causes mild and nonspecific clinical symptoms, but it 
results in devastating fetal consequences in pregnant women, including microcephaly, 
intrauterine growth retardation, and other congenital malformations (Brasil et al., 2016a; 
Honein et al., 2017; Johansson et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016; Rasmussen et al., 2016). 
ZIKV has also been associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome as well as other neurologic 
disorders in adults (Brasil et al., 2016b; Dos Santos et al., 2016; Parra et al., 2016; Soares et 
al., 2016). ZIKV infection typically results in approximately one week of viremia, but 
prolonged viremia has been observed in infected pregnant women and in semen from 
infected men (Brasil et al., 2016b; Calvet et al., 2016; Driggers et al., 2016). ZIKV has also 
been reported in fetal brain and placental tissue (Bhatnagar et al., 2017). These data suggest 
that the virus may persist in anatomic sanctuaries following clearance of virus in the 
periphery, although the extent of virus persistence following ZIKV infection remains 
unknown.
ZIKV infection of rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys has been shown to recapitulate many 
key clinical findings, including rapid control of acute viremia, early invasion of the central 
nervous system, and prolonged viral shedding and fetal pathology in pregnant female 
animals (Abbink et al., 2016; Adams Waldorf et al., 2016; Dudley et al., 2016; Osuna et al., 
2016). Studies in mice have similarly demonstrated robust viral replication and fetal 
pathology in pregnant female animals, infection of the central nervous system, and invasion 
of the male reproductive system (Cugola et al., 2016; Govero et al., 2016; Larocca et al., 
2016; Miner et al., 2016).

 Innate immune control of ZIKV has been suggested by the fact that mice lacking type 1 
interferon (IFN) activity exhibited substantially enhanced viral pathology (Lazear et al., 
2016), and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) have been shown to restrict viral replication in vitro 
(Savidis et al., 2016). Adaptive immune control of ZIKV has been demonstrated by the 
capacity of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies to prevent and control infection in adoptive 
transfer studies in mice and monkeys (Abbink et al., 2016; Barouch et al., 2017; Larocca et 
al., 2016; Sapparapu et al., 2016). Cross-reactive antibodies with other flaviviruses such as 
dengue virus have also been described, although the potential clinical relevance of these 
cross-reactive antibodies remains to be determined (Barba-Spaeth et al., 2016; Charles and 
Christofferson, 2016; Dejnirattisai et al., 2016; Stettler et al., 2016).
In this study, we investigate in detail the early virologic, immunologic, and transcriptomic 
events following ZIKV infection in rhesus monkeys. Acute viremia was rapidly controlled in 
peripheral blood by day 10 but persisted for up to 42 days in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 
for up to 72 days in lymph nodes (LN) and colorectal biopsies. ZIKV-specific neutralizing 
antibodies emerged rapidly by day 7 and correlated with virologic control in peripheral 
blood. In contrast, virus-specific antibodies were not detected in CSF for the duration of the 
study. Viral persistence in both CSF and LN also correlated with upregulation of mTOR, 
proinflammatory, and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. Taken together, these data suggest 
a mechanism for viral persistence in these anatomic sites and suggest that persistent or 
occult ZIKV infection in these compartments may occur more frequently than previously 
appreciated.
RESULTS
Persistent ZIKV in CSF and LN of Infected Rhesus Monkeys
We previously developed ZIKV challenge stocks from outbreak strains from Brazil (ZIKV-
BR; Brazil/ZKV2015) (Cugola et al., 2016) and Puerto Rico (ZIKV-PR; PRVABC59), and 
both virus stocks demonstrated robust viral replication in mice and rhesus monkeys (Abbink 
et al., 2016; Larocca et al., 2016). To evaluate the virologic and immunologic events of acute 
ZIKV infection, we infected 16 Indian-origin rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta) with 106 plaque-
forming units (pfu) (109 viral particles [vp]), 105 pfu (108 vp), 104 pfu (107 vp), or 103 pfu 
(106 vp) of ZIKV-BR and ZIKV-PR by the s.c. route (N=2/group).
We first monitored virus shedding at multiple anatomic sites. Robust viral replication was 
observed in peripheral blood for 6–10 days, consistent with prior studies of ZIKV infection 
in monkeys (Abbink et al., 2016; Dudley et al., 2016; Osuna et al., 2016). Peak plasma viral 
loads were a mean of 6.01 log RNA copies/ml (range 5.18–6.71 log RNA copies/ml) (Figure 
1A). Peak viral loads were observed on day 2 at the 106 pfu dose, on day 3 at the 105 pfu 
dose, on day 3–4 at the 104 pfu dose, and on day 4–5 at the 103 pfu dose, suggesting a trend 
towards delayed and prolonged viral replication with lower doses. Sporadic but lower levels 
of ZIKV shedding were observed in urine, cervicovaginal secretions, and saliva (Figure 1A, 
1B), although most animals still had virus detected in lymph nodes on day 14 (Figure 1C). 
Viral loads could not be performed in semen as a result of the limited number of male 
animals in this study (N=2) and challenges with sample acquisition in these animals.

 In contrast with the rapid clearance of virus in plasma, ZIKV shedding was prolonged in the 
CSF (Figure 2A), with 75% (3 of 4) of animals that received the lowest 103 pfu dose still 
positive in CSF on days 21–42, although CSF viral loads were variable. CSF samples 
contained few leukocytes (0–8 WBC/μl) and did not have chemistry profiles that indicated 
frank meningitis (Supplementary Figure S1). CSF samples also had very few red blood cells 
(0–6 RBC/μl), confirming that there was no detectable contamination with peripheral blood 
(Supplementary Figure S1). Replication-competent virus in CSF from days 21 and 42 was 
confirmed by viral outgrowth assays (Figure 2B).
To assess viral persistence in lymphoid and colorectal tissues in greater detail, we infected 4 
additional rhesus monkeys with 103 pfu (106 vp) of ZIKV-BR and followed viral loads in 
plasma, whole blood, lymph node biopsies, and colorectal biopsies. Viral loads in whole 
blood were only marginally prolonged compared with plasma (Murray et al., 2017). In 
contrast, we observed persistent virus in lymph nodes and colorectal tissue for up to 72 days 
(Figure 2C). We confirmed ZIKV in both paracortical regions and germinal centers of lymph 
nodes from ZIKV-infected monkeys on day 35 but not from a SHIV-infected monkey by 
immunohistochemistry (Figure 2D). RNA in situ hybridization confirmed rare infected cells, 
and replication-competent virus was shown by viral outgrowth assays (data not shown). 
These data demonstrate prolonged ZIKV RNA in CSF, LN, and colorectal tissue from 
infected rhesus monkeys.
Adaptive Immune Responses
We observed the rapid emergence of ZIKV-specific binding (P=0.0004) and neutralizing 
(P<0.0001) antibodies in serum by week 1 following infection (Figure 3A; Supplementary 
Figure S2). Both binding antibodies by ELISA and neutralizing antibodies by 
microneutralization (MN50) assays (Abbink et al., 2016; Larocca et al., 2016) were 
detected. Binding antibody titers correlated with MN50 titers at weeks 1–2 (P<0.0001, 
R=0.72; Figure 3A). Log MN50 titers of 1.27–3.43 were observed in 87.5% (14 of 16) of 
animals at week 1, and log MN50 titers of 3.08–3.86 were detected in 100% (16 of 16) of 
animals at week 2. Week 1 MN50 titers also correlated inversely with day 6 plasma viral 
loads (Figure 3A; P=0.019, R=−0.56), suggesting that the emergence of virus-specific 
neutralizing antibodies was associated with virologic control in plasma.
In contrast with the rapid development of ZIKV-specific antibodies in plasma, no ZIKV-
specific IgM or IgG was detected in CSF at any timepoint through week 24 (Figure 3B). In 
contrast, ZIKV-specific IgG was consistently high in serum through week 24 (Figure 3B). 
These data suggest that ZIKV-specific antibodies produced in the periphery did not 
detectably cross the blood-CSF barrier. We speculate that the absence of ZIKV-specific 
antibodies in the CSF may contribute to viral persistence in the central nervous system, and 
eventual clearance of CSF virus is thus likely dependent on other immune mechanisms.
ZIKV-specific cellular immune responses to prM, Env, Cap, and NS1 were not detected by 
IFN-γ ELISPOT assays at week 1 but were observed in a subset of animals at week 2 and in 
the majority of animals by week 5 (Figure 3C). CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocyte responses to 
Env, Cap, and NS1 were also detected by multiparameter intracellular cytokine staining 
assays by week 2 (Figure 3D). However, cellular immune responses did not correlate with

 virologic control (data not shown), although we cannot exclude the possibility that cellular 
immune responses against other ZIKV antigens may have played a role. These data suggest 
that robust ZIKV-specific cellular immune responses expanded largely after peripheral virus 
had already been controlled.
Early Innate Immune Responses
To characterize the early innate immune responses in ZIKV-infected rhesus monkeys, we 
assessed transcriptomic profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells on days 0, 2, 4, 6, 14, 
and 21 following ZIKV infection using the Affymetrix Rhesus Gene 1.0 ST Array rheMac2 
platform. Multi-dimensional unsupervised clustering using the full transcriptome of all 
animals showed principal clustering by timepoint (P=0.03; days 0, 2, 14 versus days 4, 6), 
with minimal contribution by ZIKV strain or inoculum dose, which allowed a kinetic 
analysis of gene expression using the complete group of animals (Supplementary Figure S3). 
The number of differentially expressed genes peaked on days 4 and 6 as compared with day 
0 (Supplementary Figure S3), which temporally correlated with peak plasma viral loads 
(Figure 1A).
We next used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005) and 
compiled lists of gene sets (Liberzon et al., 2015; Nakaya et al., 2011) to identify the 
pathways upregulated and downregulated following ZIKV infection of rhesus monkeys 
(Figure 4A, 4B; Supplementary Figure S4). Robust induction of IFN-α (NES=3.02, 
FDR<0.0001) and antiviral (NES=2.28, FDR<0.0001) pathways were observed on days 2, 4, 
and 6. IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (OAS2, IFT1/2/3, ISG15, IRF7, IFI44, MX1, MX2) 
(Schoggins et al., 2011) also peaked on day 6 (Figure 4C). In addition, acute ZIKV infection 
upregulated components of the inflammasome (NOD2, NLRP3, CXCL10, BTG2, BST2, 
OSM), proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-18, CCR7, CCL2, 
CCL20), and immunomodulatory pathways (IL-10, TGF-β, T regulatory cells) (Figure 4A; 
Supplementary Figure S4), analogous to what we previously observed for acute SIV 
infection in rhesus monkeys (Barouch et al., 2016). We also observed increases in mTOR 
signaling (NES=1.92, FDR=0.0014) and T cell exhaustion (NES=1.96, FDR=0.0009) 
pathways following ZIKV infection (Figure 4A; Supplementary Figure S4). mTOR 
signaling orchestrates numerous cell processes in living organisms by regulating 
homeostasis, protein synthesis, transcription, autophagy, and metabolism (Thoreen, 2017), 
and also regulates immune function (Powell et al., 2012) and neurologic development 
(Lipton and Sahin, 2014).
Acute ZIKV infection also upregulated genes associated with monocyte (NES=2.56, FDR 
<0.0001), NK cell (NES=1.65, FDR=0.01), and helper T cell (NES=1.55, FDR=0.02) 
pathways, but downregulated T cell signaling (NES=−2.36, FDR <0.0001), B cell signaling 
(NES=−2.47, FDR<0.0001), and MHC-I pathways (NES=−1.5, FDR=0.05), including genes 
such as CD40, GATA3, RHOH, PIK3CG, BANK1, and BCR (Figure 4A, 4B; 
Supplementary Figure S4). Taken together, these data demonstrate that acute ZIKV infection 
is characterized by robust and rapid upregulation of proinflammatory, interferon, antiviral, 
and immunomodulatory pathways and downregulation of T cell and B cell signaling 
pathways (Figure 4D).

 To confirm these transcriptomic findings, we monitored serum cytokines by Luminex assays 
in rhesus monkeys following ZIKV infection. Monkeys developed robust early 
proinflammatory responses as evidenced by substantial increases in serum levels of TNF-α, 
IL-2, IL-10, and IL-12/IL-23 on days 4–6 following infection (P=0.0003, P=0.0019, 
P=0.0011, and P=0.015 comparing day 6 vs. day 0 for each cytokine, respectively, Mann-
Whitney tests; Figure 5A). These data confirm that ZIKV replication triggered rapid innate 
immune responses in peripheral blood. In contrast, only minimal cytokine responses were 
observed in CSF, even in animals that exhibited prolonged ZIKV replication in the central 
nervous system (Figure 5B). Cytokine responses in both serum and CSF were essentially 
negative on days 21 and 42 (data not shown).
Pathways Correlated with Acute Plasma Viral Loads
To define the transcriptomic pathways that correlate with plasma viral loads following ZIKV 
infection, we performed a linear regression analysis correlating the full transcriptome to 
viral loads during acute infection (Figure 6A). IFN-α signaling (NES=1.59, FDR=0.08) and 
IFN-γ signaling (NES=1.56, FDR=0.09), as well as various ISGs (IFI44, ISG15, OAS1, 
TRIM5, IRF7, MX2, DDX60, TLR7) correlated positively with acute viral loads on day 2, 4 
and 6 (Figure 6A, Supplementary Figure S5), suggesting that ZIKV replication rapidly 
triggered host innate immune responses. NK cell signaling (NES=2.49, FDR=0.001), IL-10 
signaling (NES=1,55, FDR=0.09), and oxidative phosphorylation (NES=2.03, FDR=0.0016) 
pathways also correlated positively with plasma viral loads (Figure 6A; Supplementary 
Figure S5). Moreover, mTOR signaling pathways on day 2, including mTORC1 (NES=2.2, 
FDR=0.001) and PI3K_AKT_mTOR (NES=1.6, FDR=0.08), correlated positively with viral 
loads (Figure 6A). In contrast, extracellular matrix (NES=−2.05, FDR=0.02), epithelial 
mesenchymal transition (NES= −1.73, FDR=0.10), myogenesis (NES=1.83, FDR=0.06), 
and signal transduction and plasma membrane pathways (NES=−1.82, FDR=0.06) 
correlated negatively with plasma viral loads (Figure 6A; Supplementary Figure S5).
A previously reported target cell limited model of acute ZIKV replication kinetics (Osuna et 
al., 2016), which utilized a different challenge virus and a different inoculum dose, did not 
optimally describe viral dynamics in the present study. We therefore added to this model the 
impact of neutralizing antibodies and the effect of the early type 1 interferon response, 
which greatly improved the model fit (P<3.0x10−4). The best fit with biologically plausible 
parameters was found when type 1 interferon activity was assumed to begin on day 1.5 and 
when neutralizing antibody activity was assumed to begin on day 6 (negative log 
likelihood=105.7, BIC=247.4; Supplementary Figure S6). This model fit the viral dynamics 
well for all four inoculum doses tested. These findings suggest that both the innate interferon 
response and the adaptive neutralizing antibody response contributed to virologic control in 
the periphery.
Pathways Correlated with Persistent CSF and LN Viral Loads
We next evaluated the transcriptomic pathways associated with persistent CSF and LN viral 
loads using CSF viral loads from days 14 and 21 and LN viral loads from days 3 and 14. 
Plasma viral loads were negative on day 14 in all animals. Pathways that correlated with 
persistent CSF and LN viral loads following ZIKV clearance in the periphery included

 mTOR signaling (NES=1.92; P=0.00517), TGF-β (NES=1.60; P=0.00669), IFN-α signaling 
(NES=2.61; P=0.003), acute inflammation (NES=1.60; P=0.0056), and TNF-α signaling 
(NES=1.66; P=0.0032) (Figure 6B–D; Supplementary Figures S7). Genes associated with 
these pathways correlated significantly with viral loads at both timepoints tested in CSF and 
LN, including mTOR, Rictor, CXCL10, OAS2, IFI44, BANK1, NLRP3, IL1β, EIF4G, 
EIF4E, PIK3CB and SMAD3 (Figure 6C). We speculate that both mTOR signaling and 
proinflammatory pathways contributed to the survival of ZIKV-infected cells and viral 
persistence.
In contrast, pathways associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling (NES=−2.00; 
P=0.005) and platelet activation (NES=−1.85; P=0.0047) negatively correlated to viral loads 
in CSF and LN (Figure 6B–D; Supplementary Figures S7). Genes involved in collagen 
formation and cell adherence, including MLLT4, COL14A, COL5A, COL6A, MMP1, 
MMP2, MMP3, MMP8, MMP19 and SLC22A2, SLC6A13, SLC7A9 and SLC17A1, 
correlated negatively to viral loads in both CSF and LN (Figure 6C). Downregulation of 
ECM pathways has also been reported for DENV (Afroz et al., 2016), suggesting a common 
pathophysiologic pathway.
Anti-apoptotic genes (BIK, BCL2A1, BCL2L1) also correlated positively and pro-apoptotic 
genes (CASP8, CAV1, CLU, LMNA) correlated negatively to persistent CSF and LN viral 
loads (Supplementary Figure S7), suggesting that ZIKV infection creates a milieu that favors 
survival of infected cells. Taken together, these data suggest that viral persistence in the CSF 
and LN correlated with upregulation of mTOR, proinflammatory, and anti-apoptotic 
pathways, which promote survival of infected cells, and downregulation of ECM pathways, 
which may be important for lymphocyte recruitment to sites of infection (Figures 6D, 7).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we describe the early events following acute ZIKV infection of rhesus 
monkeys at a greater level of detail than previously reported. Integrated virologic, 
immunologic, and transcriptomics data demonstrated a rapid and robust proinflammatory 
response in the first few days of infection coincident with ZIKV replication, characterized 
by upregulation of type 1 IFN, antiviral, and immunomodulatory pathways. A rapid ZIKV-
specific neutralizing antibody response in peripheral blood was also evident by day 7 and 
correlated with virologic control in plasma. In contrast with the rapid virologic control in 
peripheral blood, viral persistence was observed in the CSF for up to 42 days and in LN and 
colorectal tissues for up to 72 days, suggesting the presence of multiple anatomic sanctuaries 
for the virus. Persistent virus at these sites correlated with upregulation of mTOR, 
proinflammatory, and anti-apoptotic pathways and downregulation of ECM pathways, 
suggesting a potential mechanism for viral persistence. These findings raise the possibility 
that occult or persistent neurologic and lymphoid disease may occur in ZIKV-infected 
humans more commonly than currently recognized.
mTOR orchestrates numerous cell processes in living organisms by regulating homeostasis, 
protein synthesis, transcription, autophagy, metabolism, brain function and development 
(Thoreen, 2017). The finding that upregulation of the mTOR signaling pathways correlated

 with persistent viral loads in both CSF and LN suggests that ZIKV infection may directly 
stimulate mTOR machinery, which promotes survival of infected cells. Moreover, mTOR 
signaling has been shown to play a key role in neurodevelopment, including the proliferation 
of neural stem cells, neuronal circuit development, plasticity, and higher complex functions 
(Lipton and Sahin, 2014; Switon et al., 2017; Thoreen, 2017). Overexpression of mTOR 
during early embryonic development in transgenic mice resulted in cortical atrophy and 
microcephaly, whereas overexpression of mTOR in adults led to neurodegeneration (Kassai 
et al., 2014). Moreover, brain-specific knockouts of Raptor and Rictor, which are key 
components of mTOR complex 1 and 2, respectively, also led to microcephaly and early 
postnatal lethality (Cloetta et al., 2013; Thomanetz et al., 2013). These findings suggest that 
ZIKV-induced stimulation of the mTOR pathway, together with persistent CSF viral loads, 
may be critical for the development of microcephaly and other neurologic disorders 
associated with ZIKV infection. Future studies targeting the mTOR pathway are therefore 
warranted.
Recent reports have also shown inhibition of ECM pathways by both DENV and ZIKV 
(Afroz et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016), suggesting a common pathophysiologic pathway for 
these flaviviruses. ECM proteins are widely expressed in the developing and adult nervous 
system and may also be critical for lymphocyte trafficking (Barros et al., 2011). These data 
suggest that viral persistence may result from stimulation of pathways that promote survival 
of ZIKV-infected cells and that block the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection 
(Figures 6, 7).
ZIKV-specific antibodies were not detected in CSF, despite robust and prolonged responses 
in peripheral blood (Figure 3), suggesting an additional mechanism for viral persistence in 
immunoprivileged sites. Although we did not evaluate ZIKV-specific antibody levels in 
lymph nodes in the present study, studies with monoclonal antibodies have shown 
substantial variation in antibody biodistribution to different tissues, including lymph node 
and brain, as compared with peripheral blood (de Boer et al., 2016; Tichauer et al., 2014; 
Wang et al., 2008). In the CSF, it is likely that the absence of ZIKV-specific antibodies 
contributed to viral persistence in that compartment.
Our data confirm and extend prior studies of ZIKV pathogenesis in nonhuman primates 
(Abbink et al., 2016; Dudley et al., 2016; Osuna et al., 2016). A recent study identified virus 
in neuronal, lymphoid, and reproductive tissues though day 28–35 following infection in 
rhesus monkeys (Hirsch et al., 2017), and persistent ZIKV infection has been reported in the 
testes in mice (Govero et al., 2016). Taken together, these findings suggest that ZIKV may 
persist for prolonged periods in multiple anatomic sanctuaries, including the central nervous 
system, lymphoid system, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract.
Our findings demonstrate that early ZIKV replication in rhesus monkeys is partially 
restricted by early innate interferon responses and is then definitively controlled in 
peripheral blood by the rapid emergence of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies by day 6–
10. In the central nervous system, lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal tissues, however, virus 
can persist for a substantially longer period of time, likely as a result of activation of mTOR, 
proinflammatory, and anti-apoptotic pathways that promote survival of infected cells, as well

 as exclusion of virus-specific antibodies from CSF. If persistent or occult neurologic and 
lymphoid disease similarly occurs following clearance of peripheral virus in ZIKV-infected 
humans, such a finding would have important clinical implications. It is likely that that 
mTOR activation and persistent virus in the central nervous system contribute to the 
hallmark neuropathology of ZIKV infection.

Experimental Model and Subject Details
Rhesus Monkeys—16 outbred, Indian-origin, healthy young adult male and female 
rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were included in the initial study. These monkeys were 
housed at Bioqual, Rockville, MD. Animals were infected with 103–106 pfu (106–109 vp) of 
our ZIKV-BR or ZIKV-PR challenge stocks by the s.c. route (N=2/group). An additional 4 
outbred, Indian-origin, healthy young adult male and female rhesus monkeys were housed at 
Alphagenesis, Yemassee, SC and infected with 103 pfu (106 vp) of our ZIKV-BR challenge 
stocks by the s.c. route (N=4/group). Animals were tested for baseline flavivirus neutralizing 
antibodies. None of the monkeys were previously enrolled in other studies. All animal 
studies were approved by the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
(IACUC).
Cell lines—Vero cells (World Health Organization, NICSC-011038011038) were 
maintained in EMEM media supplemented with 10%FBS, 6mM L-glutamine and 1x pen/
strep. Cells were passaged twice a week and incubated at 37°C, 10% CO2.
Methods Details
RT-PCR—RT-PCR assays were utilized to monitor viral loads, essentially as previously 
described (Abbink et al., 2016; Larocca et al., 2016). RNA was extracted from plasma or 
other samples with a QIAcube HT (Qiagen, Germany) using the Qiacube 96 Cador pathogen 
HT or the Qiacube 96 RNeasy 96 kit. CSF samples were centrifuged prior to analyses. The 
wildtype ZIKV BeH815744 Cap gene was utilized as a standard. RNA standards were 
generated using the AmpliCap-Max™ T 7 High Yield Message Maker Kit (Cell Script) and 
purified with RNA clean and concentrator kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA). RNA quality and 
concentration was assessed by the BIDMC Molecular Core Facility. Log dilutions of the 
RNA standard were reverse transcribed and included with each RT-PCR assay. Viral loads 
were calculated as virus particles (VP) per ml or virus particles per 106 cells as shown in 
Figures 1–2. Assay sensitivity was >100 copies/ml and >100 ZIKV copies/106 cells.
ELISA—Monkey ZIKV Env ELISA kits (Alpha Diagnostic International, TX, USA) were 
used to determine endpoint binding antibody titers using a modified protocol (Abbink et al., 
2016). 96-well plates coated with ZIKV Env protein were first equilibrated at room 
temperature with 300 μl of kit working wash buffer for 5 min. 6 μl of monkey serum was

 added to the top row, and 3-fold serial dilutions were tested in the remaining rows. Samples 
were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and plates washed 4 times. 100 μl of anti-
monkey IgG HRP-conjugate working solution was then added to each well and incubated for 
30 min at room temperature. Plates were washed 5 times, developed for 15 min at room 
temperature with 100 μl of TMB substrate, and stopped by the addition of 100 μl of stop 
solution. Plates were analyzed at 450nm/550nm on a VersaMax microplate reader using 
Softmax Pro 6.0 software (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). ELISA endpoint titers were 
defined as the highest reciprocal serum dilution that yielded an absorbance >2-fold over 
background values. Log10 endpoint titers are reported and shown in Figure 3.
Virus Neutralization Assay—A high-throughput, standardized ZIKV 
microneutralization (MN) assay was utilized for measuring ZIKV-specific neutralizing 
antibodies, essentially as previously described (Abbink et al., 2016; Larocca et al., 2016). 
Briefly, serum samples were serially diluted three-fold in 96-well micro-plates, and 100 μl of 
ZIKV-PR containing 100 PFU were added to 100 μl of each serum dilution and incubated at 
35°C for 2 h. Supernatants were then transferred to microtiter plates containing confluent 
Vero cell monolayers (World Health Organization, NICSC-011038011038). After incubation 
for 4 d, cells were fixed with absolute ethanol: methanol for 1 h at −20°C and washed three 
times with PBS. The pan-flavivirus monoclonal antibody 6B6-C1 conjugated to HRP (6B6-
C1 was a gift from JT Roehrig, CDC) was then added to each well, incubated at 35°C for 2 
h, and washed with PBS. Plates were washed, developed with 3,3′,5,5′–
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) for 50 min at room temperature, stopped with 1:25 phosphoric 
acid, and absorbance was read at 450 nm. For a valid assay, the average absorbance at 450 
nm of three non-infected control wells had to be ≤ 0.5, and virus-only control wells had to 
be ≥ 0.9. Normalized absorbance values were calculated, the MN50 titer was determined by 
a log mid-point linear regression model. The MN50 titer was calculated as the reciprocal of 
the serum dilution that neutralized ≥ 50% of ZIKV, and seropositivity was defined as a titer 
≥ 10, with the maximum measurable titer 7,290. Log10 MN50 titers are shown in Figure 
3A–B and Supplementary Figure S2.
Viral Outgrowth Assay—MW6 plates seeded with Vero WHO cells (World Health 
Organization, NICSC-011038011038) were infected with CSF and plasma from ZIKV 
infected monkeys. Aliquots of the media were taken daily after infection and subjected to 
RT-PCR as described above. Viral loads of the cultures are shown in vp/ml in Figure 2B.
ELISPOT assay—ZIKV-specific cellular immune responses were assessed by interferon-γ 
ELISPOT assays shown in Figure 3C using pools of overlapping 15-amino-acid peptides 
covering the prM, Env, Cap, and NS1 proteins (JPT, Berlin, Germany), essentially as we 
previously described (Abbink et al., 2016; Larocca et al., 2016). 96-well multiscreen plates 
(Millipore, MA, USA) were coated overnight with 100 μl/well of 10 μg/ml anti-human 
interferon-γ (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) in endotoxin-free Dulbecco’s PBS (D-PBS). The 
plates were then washed three times with D-PBS containing 0.25% Tween 20 (D-PBS-
Tween), blocked for 2 h with D-PBS containing 5% FBS at 37°C, washed three times with 
D-PBS-Tween, rinsed with RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS to remove the Tween 20, and 
incubated with 2 μg/ml of each peptide and 2 × 105 monkey PBMC in triplicate in 100 μl

 reaction mixture volumes. Following an 18 h incubation at 37°C, the plates were washed 
nine times with PBS-Tween and once with distilled water. The plates were then incubated 
with 2 μg/ml biotinylated anti-human interferon-γ (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) for 2 h at 
room temperature, washed six times with PBS-Tween, and incubated for 2 h with a 1:500 
dilution of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Southern Biotechnology Associates, AL, 
USA). Following five washes with PBS-Tween and one with PBS, the plates were developed 
with nitroblue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate chromogen (Pierce, IL, 
USA), stopped by washing with tap water, air dried, and read using an ELISPOT reader 
(Cellular Technology Ltd., OH, USA). The numbers of spot-forming cells (SFC) per 106 
cells were calculated. The medium background levels were typically <15 SFC per 106 cells.
Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS)—12-color ICS assays shown in Figure 3D were 
performed essentially as described (Barouch et al., 2016) in response to stimulation with 
prM, Env, Cap, and NS1 peptide pools (JPT, Berlin, Germany) using the Aqua green-
fluorescent reactive dye (Invitrogen, L23101) and predetermined titers of mAbs (Becton-
Dickinson) against CD3 (SP34; Alexa Fluor 700), CD4 (OKT4; BV711, Biolegend), CD8 
(SK1; allophycocyanin-cyanine 7 [APC-Cy7]), CD28 (L293; BV510), CD95 (DX2; 
allophycocyanin [APC]), CD69 (TP1.55.3; phycoerythrin-Texas red [energy-coupled dye; 
ECD]; Beckman Coulter), gamma interferon (IFN-γ) (B27; phycoerythrin-cyanine 7 [PE-
Cy7]), Ki67 (B56; fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]), CCR5 (3A9; phycoerythrin [PE]), 
CCR7(3D12; BV421), and PD-1(EH21.1; peridinin chlorophyll-A-cyanine 5.5 [PerCP-
Cy5.5]). IFN-γ backgrounds were consistently <0.01% in PBMC.
Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry for ZIKV Env, shown in Figure 2D 
was performed using standard techniques. Briefly, lymph nodes were fixed in 10% neutral 
buffered formalin for 24–72 hours then transferred to 70% ethanol. Formalin-fixed paraffin 
embedded (FFPE) tissues were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded 
ethanol solutions to distilled water. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by 
incubation in 3% H2O2, and antigen retrieval was accomplished by microwaving sections for 
20 min in citrate buffer (Dako). Tissue sections were treated for nonspecific protein binding 
(Protein Block; Dako) and then sequentially incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-ZIKV 
Env (Biofront) at 1:200 followed by biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector Labs). 
Antigen-antibody complexes were localized by application of streptavidin-peroxidase 
conjugate (Dako) followed by development in the chromogenic substrate 3,3-
diaminobenzidine (Dako).
Luminex assay—Serum was thawed on ice and neutralized with 0.05% Tween-20 for 15 
minutes at room temperature. Samples were prepared using the Milliplex Nonhuman 
Primate 23-plex (Millipore) according to manufacturers’ protocol and washed and 
resuspended in 4% formaldehyde in D-PBS for 1 hour on a plate shaker. Samples were then 
washed and resuspended in Magpix drive fluid for analysis. Data was acquired on a Magpix 
instrument running xPONENT 4.2 (Luminex). Cytokine cut-off values for analysis were the 
following: IL-2 (2.4 pg/ml), IL-10 (12.2 pg/ml), TNF-γ (2.4 pg/ml serum, 9.8 pg/mL CSF), 
IL-12/23 (p40) (9.8 pg/ml serum days 4 and 6, 2.4 pg/ml CSF and serum days 0 and 2).

 Cytokine levels were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v6.03 (GraphPad Software, CA, USA) 
and are shown in Figure 5.
Transcriptomics—Cells were isolated from peripheral blood at d2, 4, 6, 14 and 21 as well 
as lymph node at d3 and 14 and stored in RNAlater. Total RNA extraction was performed 
using the automated RNeasy HT Qiacube kit according to manufacturer’s instructions 
(Qiagen). Reverse transcription reactions were performed to obtain cDNAs, and proper 
cDNA amplification was confirmed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). 
cDNA was hybridized to Rhesus Genome rheMac2 platform (Affymetrix) at the Microarray 
Core of the Boston University.
Analysis of the genome array output data was conducted using the statistical language R 
(http://www.r-project.org/) and the Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) statistical 
package from Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/) (Gentleman et al., 2004). Quantile 
normalization, followed by a log2 transformation using the Bioconductor package LIMMA, 
was applied to process microarrays. Batch correction was performed to correct for any 
technical or biological effect using ComBat R (http://bioconductor.org/). The LIMMA 
package was used to fit a linear model to each probe and to perform a moderated Student’s t 
test on various differences of interest between time points. For data mining and functional 
analyses, genes that satisfied a p value cut-off of 0.05 were selected. When indicated, p 
values were corrected for multiple comparisons using Benjamin & Hochberg method (FDR 
<5%). The LIMMA package was used to fit a linear regression model to each probe where 
the log2 expression of each transcript was used as an independent variable and viral load or 
neutralizing antibody titers, respectively, as continuous variables. Pearson correlations and a 
p value cut-off of 0.05 were used to assess significant genes that correlated with virologic 
and immunologic data.
Pathway enrichment was performed using gene set enrichment analyses GSEA (http://
software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp) and a list of gene sets including MSigDB 
Hallmark collection and published immunological modules (Subramanian et al., 2005). To 
assess the significance of GSEA results, 1000 permutations were performed. The minimum 
size of tested gene sets was set to 5 genes and the maximum to 5000. A nominal p value of 
0.05 was used to assess the significance of gene sets enrichment. An enrichment score (ES) 
was calculated to reflect the degree of the over-representation of the top (or bottom) genes in 
the ranked gene list. GSEA allows for the identification of a core list of genes (leading edge 
genes) that contribute to the ES from genes within each significantly enriched gene set. The 
normalized enrichment score and FDR shown in the main text correspond to day 4 following 
ZIKV infection (Figure 4, Supplementary Figures S3 and S4). Module enrichment map was 
generated using EnrichmentMap application under Cytoscape (http://cytoscape.org/). 
Functional annotation and network inference were performed using Cytoscape (http://
cytoscape.org/).
To identify mechanisms of persistence of CSF and LN viral loads, a linear regression model 
using R programming language was used to correlate genes expressed in PBMC on day 14 
and 21 to viral load in CSF on day 14 and 21 respectively and to correlate genes expression 
in LN to viral load in LN on day 3 and 14 (Figure 6, Supplementary Figures S5 and S7).

 Next, we identified genes that correlated to CSF and LN viral loads for each timepoint 
separately. To account for genes that correlated positively or negatively with viral loads at 
different timepoints, we measured the Fisher combined p value for each gene correlated to 
CSF viral loads on day 14 or 21 and gene correlated to LN viral loads on day 3 and day 14, 
where the Fisher combined p value, P is defined as:
where P representing the combined p value, k the number of timepoints and ln(Pi) is the 
natural log of each specific timepoints’ p value.
Viral Dynamics Modeling—A mathematical model was used to investigate the within-
host ZIKV dynamics in plasma as shown in Supplementary Figure S6. The model was a 
standard target cell limited model that included a viral eclipse phase and (i) an early innate 
type 1 interferon response and (ii) a neutralizing antibody response. The model is described 
by the following system of equations:
(1)
Target cells, T, are infected by free virus V with rate β when no antibody, A, is present, and 
become non-productively infected cells, I1. While cells are non-productively infected they 
are referred to as being in the eclipse phase, and they transition to productively infected cells 
I2 at per capita rate k giving a mean eclipse phase of length 1/k. Productively infected cells 
die at per capita rate δ and produce virus, in the absence of interferon F, at rate p per cell, 
which is then cleared at rate c per virion.
In vitro there is detectable virus in cell culture supernatants 6 hours after Zika infection of 
primary human fibroblasts (Hamel et al., 2015). We fixed the value of k at 4 d−1 so that the 
mean eclipse phase length was 6 hours, since there is not enough information in the data to 
estimate it precisely. We also set the value of c to be 25 d−1, similar to the value estimated 
for HIV-1 (Ramratnam et al., 1999) and HCV (Guedj et al., 2013).
Productively infected cells cause the production of interferon at rate s after a lag of length τ. 
As expression of ISGs was detected at day 2, we investigated values of τ = 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 
1.5 days. Without loss of generality we can set s = 1 d−1, so that one productively infected 
cell creates one ‘unit’ of interferon per day. Interferon is cleared at constant rate γ and 
reduces the production rate of virus particles from infected cells with a coefficient ε. In 
previous work fitting a similar model to data from influenza infected ponies (Pawelek et al., 
Aid et al.
Page 13

 2012) it was estimated that interferon is cleared at a rate of approximately 2 d−1, as so we 
took this as the value of γ.
The model assumes neutralizing antibody, A, reduces the infection rate β by the factor (1+ 
αA(t)). We used linear interpolation between measured neutralization titers to estimate A(t), 
under the assumption that A(t) = 0 for all t below some value, denoted Tab. Because 
neutralizing antibody was detected at day 7, we investigated values of Tab = 3, 4, 5 or 6 
days.
We set the initial conditions of this system such that there are no infected cells, interferon or 
neutralizing antibody at time t=0 and as in previous work (Osuna et al., 2016) we fixed the 
initial target cell population density at T(0) = T0 = 105 cells/ml. In order to evaluate the 
effects of immunological control of ZIKV, we considered models where (a) there is no effect 
of neutralizing antibody or interferon (α = 0, ε = 0), (b) there is an effect of antibody but no 
effect of interferon (ε = 0) and (c) both neutralizing antibody and interferon affect the viral 
dynamics. For each of these models, we estimated the distribution of the non-fixed 
parameters and the initial condition V(0) = V0 using a population fitting approach with a 
non-linear mixed effects model implemented in Monolix (http://lixoft.com/products/
monolix/), providing estimates of population medians and standard errors for each of the 
parameters. We assessed model fits by the negative log likelihood and the appropriateness of 
the various models of immune control using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), both 
as provided by Monolix.
Statistical Analyses
Analysis of virologic and immunologic data was performed using GraphPad Prism v6.03 
(GraphPad Software, CA, USA). Comparisons of groups were performed using Student t-
test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Correlations of virologic and immunologic data were 
assessed by Spearman rank-correlation tests. A p value cut-off of 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.

 Figure 1. Viral shedding following ZIKV infection
Rhesus monkeys (N=16) were infected by the s.c route with 106–103 pfu (109–106 vp) 
ZIKV-BR or ZIKV-PR (N=2/group). Viral loads (log10 ZIKV RNA copies/ml or copies/106 
cells) are shown in (A) plasma and urine, (B) cervicovaginal secretions and saliva, and (C) 
lymph node and colorectal biopsies. Viral loads were determined on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 10, and 14 for plasma and urine samples and on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 for the other samples. 
Data is shown for all 8 animals in each panel, except for only 7 females in each panel for 
cervicovaginal secretions. Assay sensitivity is >100 ZIKV copies/ml and >100 ZIKV 
copies/106 cells.

Normalized enrichment scores of the top pathways correlated positively (red) or negatively 
(blue) to CSF viral loads on day 14 and 21 (left) and to LN viral loads on day 3 and 14 
(right). (C) Scatter plots of genes consistently correlated positively (red) or negatively (blue) 
to persistent viral load in CSF (top) and LN (bottom). Color gradient ranging from dark to 
light (red for positively correlated genes, blue for negatively correlated genes) represent the 
Fisher combined P value for each gene. Axes represent log2 fold change in gene expression 
between animals with positive and negative viral loads. (D) Gene interaction networks for 
mTOR, inflammation and interferon, and extracellular matrix pathways that were correlated 
positively or negatively to CSF and LN viral loads. Red and blue nodes are genes correlated 
positively and negatively to viral loads. Node size is proportional to the number of 
interacting neighbors. Edge width depicts the strength of the interaction between each pair 
of genes. Networks inference was performed using Cytoscape. See also Supplementary
