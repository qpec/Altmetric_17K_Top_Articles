the spread of airborne-mediated 
microbial diseases

Airborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis represent major public 
health challenges. A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne 
pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; 
however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are 
both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light 
(207–222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, 
due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer 
(non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or 
smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. We show for the first time that far-UVC 
efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses, with a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm2 of 222-nm light 
inactivating >95% of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus. Continuous very low dose-rate far-UVC light 
in indoor public locations is a promising, safe and inexpensive tool to reduce the spread of airborne-
mediated microbial diseases.
Airborne-mediated microbial diseases represent one of the major challenges to worldwide public health1. 
Common examples are influenza2, appearing in seasonal3 and pandemic4 forms, and bacterially-based 
airborne-mediated diseases such as tuberculosis5, increasingly emerging in multi-drug resistant form.
A direct approach to prevent the transmission of airborne-mediated disease is inactivation of the correspond-
ing airborne pathogens, and in fact the airborne antimicrobial efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) light has long been 
established6–8. Germicidal UV light can also efficiently inactivate both drug-sensitive and multi-drug-resistant 
bacteria9, as well as differing strains of viruses10. However, the widespread use of germicidal ultraviolet light in 
public settings has been very limited because conventional UVC light sources are a human health hazard, being 
both carcinogenic and cataractogenic11,12.
By contrast, we have earlier shown that far-UVC light generated by filtered excimer lamps emitting in the 207 
to 222 nm wavelength range, efficiently inactivates drug-resistant bacteria, without apparent harm to exposed 
mammalian skin13–15. The biophysical reason is that, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC 
light does not have sufficient range to penetrate through even the outer layer (stratum corneum) on the surface of 
human skin, nor the outer tear layer on the outer surface of the eye, neither of which contain living cells; however, 
because bacteria and viruses are typically of micron or smaller dimensions, far-UVC light can still efficiently 
traverse and inactivate them13–15.
The earlier studies on the germicidal efficacy of far UVC light13,15–18 were performed exposing bacteria irradi-
ated on a surface or in suspension. In that a major pathway for the spread of influenza A is aerosol transmission3, 
we investigate for the first time the efficacy of far-UVC 222-nm light for inactivating airborne viruses carried by 
aerosols – with the goal of providing a potentially safe alternative to conventional 254-nm germicidal lamps to 
inactivate airborne microbes.

cells in a particular field of view, while green fluorescence indicated the integration of live influenza A (H1N1) 
viruses into the cells. Results from the zero-dose control studies (Fig. 1, top left) confirmed that the aerosol 
irradiation chamber efficiently transmitted the aerosolized viruses through the system, after which the live virus 
efficiently infected the test mammalian epithelial cells.
Figure 2 shows the surviving fraction, as a function of the incident 222-nm far-UVC dose, of exposed H1N1 
aerosolized viruses, as measured by the number of focus forming units in incubated epithelial cells relative to 
unexposed controls. Linear regressions (see below) showed that the survival results were consistent with a classi-
cal exponential UV disinfection model with rate constant k = 1.8 cm2/mJ (95% confidence intervals 1.5–2.1 cm2/
mJ). The overall model fit was good, with a coefficient of determination, R2 = 0.95, which suggests that most of the

variability in virus survival was explained by the exponential model. The rate constant of 1.8 cm2/mJ corresponds 
to an inactivation cross-section (dose required to inactivate 95% of the exposed viruses) of D95 = 1.6 mJ/cm2 (95% 
confidence intervals 1.4–1.9 mJ/cm2).
Discussion
We have developed an approach to UV-based sterilization using single-wavelength far-UVC light generated by fil-
tered excilamps, which selectively inactivate microorganisms, but does not produce biological damage to exposed 
mammalian cells and tissues13–15. The approach is based on biophysical principles in that far-UVC light can trav-
erse and therefore inactivate bacteria and viruses which are typically micrometer dimensions or smaller, whereas 
due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer dead-cell 
layers of human skin, nor the outer tear layer on the surface of the eye.
Here we applied this approach to test the efficacy of the 222-nm far-UVC light to inactivate influenza A virus 
(H1N1) carried by aerosols in a benchtop aerosol UV irradiation chamber, which generated aerosol droplets of 
sizes similar to those generated by human coughing and breathing. Aerosolized viruses flowing through the irra-
diation chamber were exposed to UVC emitting lamps placed in front of the chamber window.
As shown in Fig. 2, inactivation of influenza A virus (H1N1) by 222-nm far-UVC light follows a typical 
exponential disinfection model, with an inactivation cross-section of D95 = 1.6 mJ/cm2 (95% CI: 1.4–1.9). For 
comparison, using a similar experimental arrangement, but using a conventional 254 nm germicidal UVC lamp, 
McDevitt et al.19 found a D95 value of 1.1 mJ/cm2 (95% CI: 1.0–1.2) for H1N1 virus. Thus as we13,15 and others16–18 
reported in earlier studies for bacterial inactivation, 222-nm far-UVC light and 254-nm broad-spectrum germi-
cidal light are also comparable in their efficiencies for aerosolized viral inactivation. Other recent work compar-
ing viral inactivation across the UVC spectrum has shown variations in efficiency are expected, but in general 
both regions of the spectrum are effective in inactivation, though the precise cause of inactivation may differ20,21. 
However as discussed above, based on biophysical considerations and in contrast to the known human health 
safety issues associated with conventional germicidal 254-nm broad-spectrum UVC light, far-UVC light does not 
appear to be cytotoxic to exposed human cells and tissues in vitro or in vivo13–15.
If these results are confirmed in other scenarios, it follows that the use of overhead low-level far-UVC light 
in public locations may represent a safe and efficient methodology for limiting the transmission and spread of 
airborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis. In fact the potential use of ultraviolet 
light for airborne disinfection is by no means new, and was first demonstrated more than 80 years ago8,22. As 
applied more recently, airborne ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) utilizes conventional germicidal UVC 
light in the upper part of the room, with louvers to prevent direct exposure of potentially occupied room areas23. 
This results in blocking more than 95% of the UV radiation exiting the UVGI fixture, with substantial decrease 
in effectiveness24. By contrast, use of low-level far-UVC fixtures, which are potentially safe for human exposure, 
could provide the desired antimicrobial benefits without the accompanying human health concerns of conven-
tional germicidal lamp UVGI.
A key advantage of the UVC based approach, which is in clear contrast to vaccination approaches, is that 
UVC light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes. For example, while there will almost certainly 
be variations in UVC inactivation efficiency as different influenza strains appear, they are unlikely to be large7,10. 
Likewise, as multi-drug-resistant variants of bacteria emerge, their UVC inactivation efficiencies are also unlikely 
to change greatly9.
In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that very low doses of far-UVC light efficiently inactivate 
airborne viruses carried by aerosols. For example, a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm2 of 222-nm light inactivates >95% 
of airborne H1N1 virus. Our results indicate that far-UVC light is a powerful and inexpensive approach for pre-
vention and reduction of airborne viral infections without the human health hazards inherent with conventional 
germicidal UVC lamps. If these results are confirmed in other scenarios, it follows that the use of overhead very 
low level far-UVC light in public locations may represent a safe and efficient methodology for limiting the trans-
mission and spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases. Public locations such as hospitals, doctors’ offices, 
schools, airports and airplanes might be considered here. This approach may help limit seasonal influenza epi-
demics, transmission of tuberculosis, as well as major pandemics.
Methods
Far-UVC lamps. 
We used a bank of three excimer lamps containing a Kr-Cl gas mixture that predomi-
nantly emits at 222 nm25,26. The exit window of each lamp was covered with a custom bandpass filter designed to 
remove all but the dominant emission wavelength as previously described15. Each bandpass filter (Omega Optical, 
Brattleboro, VT) had a center wavelength of 222 nm and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25 nm and 
enables >20% transmission at 222 nm. A UV spectrometer (SPM-002-BT64, Photon Control, BC, Canada) with 
a sensitivity range between 190 nm and 400 nm was utilized to verify the 222 nm emission spectrum. A deute-
rium lamp standard with a NIST-traceable spectral irradiance (Newport Model 63945, Irvine, CA) was used to 
radiometrically calibrate the UV spectrometer. An SM-70 Ozone Monitor (Aeroqual, Avondale, Auckland, New 
Zealand) measured the ozone generation from the lamps to be <0.005 ppm, which is not a significant level to 
provide an antimicrobial effect to aerosolized viruses27.
Far-UVC dosimetry. 
Optical power measurements were performed using an 818-UV/DB low-power UV 
enhanced silicon photodetector with an 843-R optical power meter (Newport, Irvine, CA). Additional dosimetry 
to determine the uniformity of the UV exposure was performed using far-UVC sensitive film as described in our 
previous work28,29. This film has a high spatial resolution with the ability to resolve features to at least 25 µm, and 
exhibits a nearly ideal cosine response30,31. Measurements were taken between experiments therefore allowing 
placement of sensors inside the chamber.

A range of far-UVC exposures, from 3.6 µJ/cm2 up to 281.6 mJ/cm2, were used to define a response calibration 
curve. Films were scanned as 48 bit RGB TIFF images at 150 dpi using an Epson Perfection V700 Photo flatbed 
scanner (Epson, Japan) and analyzed with radiochromic film analysis software32 to calculate the total exposure 
based on measured changes in optical density.
Measurements using both a silicon detector and UV sensitive films were combined to compute the total dose 
received by a particle traversing the exposure window. The three vertically stacked lamps produced a nearly 
uniform dose distribution along the vertical axis thus every particle passing horizontally through the irradiation 
chamber received an identical dose. The lamp width (100 mm) was smaller than the width of the irradiation 
chamber window (260 mm) so the lamp power was higher near the center of the irradiation chamber window 
compared to the edge. The UV sensitive film indicated a power of approximately 120 µW/cm2 in the center third 
of the window and 70 µW/cm2 for the outer thirds. The silicon detector was used to quantify the reflectivity of 
the aluminum sheet at approximately 15% of the incident power. Combining this data allowed the calculation of 
the average total dose of 2.0 mJ/cm2 to a particle traversing the window in 20 seconds. Additionally, the silicon 
detector was used to confirm the attenuation of 222-nm light through a single sheet of plastic film was 65%. The 
addition of one or two sheets of plastic film between the lamps and the irradiation chamber window yielded aver-
age doses of 1.3 mJ/cm2 and 0.8 mJ/cm2, respectively.
Benchtop aerosol irradiation chamber. 
A one-pass, dynamic aerosol / virus irradiation chamber was 
constructed in a similar configuration to that used by Ko et al.33, Lai et al.34, and McDevitt et al.19,35. A schematic 
overview of the system is shown in Fig. 3 and is pictured in Fig. 4. Aerosolized viruses were generated by adding 
a virus solution into a high-output extended aerosol respiratory therapy (HEART) nebulizer (Westmed, Tucson, 
AZ) and operated using a dual-head pump (Thermo Fisher 420–2901–00FK, Waltham, MA) with an input 
flow rate of 11 L/min. The aerosolized virus flowed into the irradiation chamber where it was mixed with inde-
pendently controlled inputs of humidified and dried air. Humidified air was produced by bubbling air through 
water, while dry air was provided by passing air through a desiccant air dryer (X06–02–00, Wilkerson Corp, 
Richland, MI). Adjusting the ratio of humid and dry air enabled control of the relative humidity (RH) within the 
irradiation chamber which, along with the nebulizer settings, determined the aerosol particle size distribution. 
An optimal RH value of 55% resulted in a distribution of aerosol particle sizes similar to the natural distribution 
from human coughing and breathing, which has been shown to be distributed around approximately 1 µm, with 
a significant tail of particles less than 1 µm36–38.
After combining the humidity control inputs with the aerosolized virus, input flow was directed through 
a series of baffles that promoted droplet drying and mixing to produce an even particle distribution and sta-
ble humidity34. The RH and temperature inside the irradiation chamber were monitored using an Omega 
RH32 meter (Omega Engineering Inc., Stamford, CT) immediately following the baffles. A Hal Technologies 
HAL-HPC300 particle sizer (Fontana, CA) was adjoined to the irradiation chamber to allow for sampling of 
particle sizes throughout operation.
During UV exposure, the 222-nm lamps were placed 11 cm from the irradiation chamber window. The lamps 
were directed at the 26 cm ×
 25.6 cm chamber window which was constructed of 254-µm thick UV transparent 
plastic film (Topas 8007x10, Topas Advanced Polymers, Florence, KY), and which had a transmission of ~65% at 
222 nm. The wall of the irradiation chamber opposite the transparent window was constructed with polished alu-
minum in order to reflect a portion of the UVC light back through the exposure region, therefore increasing the 
overall exposure dose by having photons pass in both directions. The depth of the irradiation chamber between 
the window and the aluminum panel was 6.3 cm, creating a total exposure volume of 4.2 L.
Figure 3. Schematic diagram of the custom UV irradiation chamber. The chamber is depicted in a top down 
view. Components of the setup include: water bubbler for humidified air input (A), a desiccator for dry air input 
(B), a nebulizer (C), baffles (D), an RH and temperature meter (E), a particle sizer (F), far-UVC lamps (G), band 
pass filters (H), a far-UVC transmitting plastic window (I), a reflective aluminum surface (J), and a BioSampler 
(K). Pumps are used to pressurize the nebulizer for aerosol generation and to control flow through the system. 
Flow control valves allow adjustments through the system. HEPA filters are included on all air inputs and 
outputs. A set of three way valves controls flow to or around the BioSampler. The vertically stacked lamps are 
directed at the window in the side of the chamber to expose the aerosols passing horizontally. The additional 
films to uniformly decrease the dose were placed between the filters and the window. The path of the aerosolized 
virus within the system during sampling is indicated with the red dotted line.

Flow of the aerosols continues out of the irradiation chamber to a set of three way valves that could be config-
ured to either pass through a bypass channel (used when no sampling was required), or a BioSampler (SKC Inc, 
Eighty Four, PA) used to collect the virus. The BioSampler uses sonic flow impingement upon a liquid surface to 
collect aerosols when operated at an air flow of 12.5 L/min. Finally, flow continued out of the system through a 
final HEPA filter and to a vacuum pump (WP6111560, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). The vacuum pump at the 
end of the system powered flow through the irradiation chamber. The flow rate through the system was governed 
by the BioSampler. Given the flow rate and the total exposure volume of the irradiation chamber, 4.2 L, a single 
aerosol droplet passed through the exposure volume in approximately 20 seconds.
The entire irradiation chamber was set up inside a certified class II type A2 biosafety cabinet (Labconco, 
Kansas City, MO). All air inputs and outputs were equipped with HEPA filters (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, 
Pittsburgh, PA) to prevent unwanted contamination from entering the chamber as well as to block any of the virus 
from releasing into the environment.
Irradiation chamber performance. 
The custom irradiation chamber simulated the transmission of aero-
solized viruses produced via human coughing and breathing. The chamber operated at a relative humidity of 55% 
which resulted in a particle size distribution of 87% between 0.3 µm and 0.5 µm, 11% between 0.5 µm and 0.7 µm, 
and 2% > 0.7 µm. A comparison to published ranges of particle size distributions is shown in Table 1. Aerosolized 
viruses were efficiently transmitted through the system as evidenced from the control (zero exposure) showing 
clear virus integration (Fig. 1, top left).
Experimental protocol. 
The virus solution in the nebulizer consisted of 1 ml of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s 
Medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) containing 108 focus forming units per ml (FFU/ml) of 
influenza A virus [A/PR/8/34 (H1N1)], 20 ml of deionized water, and 0.05 ml of Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution 
with calcium and magnesium (HBSS++). The irradiation chamber was operated with aerosolized virus particles 
flowing through the chamber and the bypass channel for 15 minutes prior to sampling, in order to establish 
the desired RH value of ~55%. Sample collection initiated by changing air flow from the bypass channel to the 
BioSampler using the set of three way valves. The BioSampler was initially filled with 20 ml of HBSS++ to capture 
the aerosol. During each sampling time, which lasted for 30 minutes, the inside of the irradiation chamber was

exposed to 222 nm far-UVC light through the UVC semi-transparent plastic window. Variation of the far-UVC 
dose delivered to aerosol particles was achieved by inserting additional UVC semi-transparent plastic films, iden-
tical to the material used as the chamber window, between the lamps and the chamber window. The extra plastic 
films uniformly reduced the power entering the chamber. The three test doses of 0.8, 1.3 and 2.0 mJ/cm2, were 
achieved by adding two, one, or no additional plastic films, respectively. Zero-dose control studies were con-
ducted with the excimer lamps turned off. Experiments at each dose were repeated in triplicate. A newly sterilized 
BioSampler was used for each experimental run to prevent unwanted contamination. Negative controls, where 
virus was omitted from the nebulizer mixture, were run intermittently and showed no virus collection in the 
BioSampler. After the sampling period was completed the solution from the BioSampler was used for the virus 
infectivity assay.
Virus infectivity assay. 
We measured viral infectivity with a focus forming assay that employs standard flu-
orescent immunostaining techniques to detect infected host cells and infectious virus particles39. Briefly, after run-
ning through the irradiation chamber for 30 minutes, 0.5 ml of virus suspension collected from the BioSampler 
was overlaid on a monolayer of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells routinely grown in DMEM 
supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 2 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μ
g/
ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich Corp. St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were incubated with the virus for 45 minutes, 
washed three times with HBSS++ and incubated overnight in DMEM. Infected cells were then fixed in 100% ice 
cold methanol at 4 °C for 5 minutes and labeled with influenza A virus nucleoprotein antibody [C43] (Abcam 
ab128193, Cambridge, MA) 1:200 in HBSS++ containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich Corp. 
St. Louis, MO, USA) at room temperature for 30 minutes with gentle shaking. Cells were washed three times 
in HBSS++ and labeled with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-488 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) 1:800 in 
HBSS++ containing 1% BSA at room temperature for 30 minutes with gentle shaking. Following three washes 
in HBSS++, the cells were stained with Vectashield containing DAPI (4′
,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Victor 
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and observed with the 10×
 and 40×
 objectives of an Olympus IX70 fluorescent 
microscope equipped with a Photometrics PVCAM high-resolution, high-efficiency digital camera. For each 
sample, at least three fields of view of merged DAPI and Alexa-488 images were acquired. Image-Pro Plus 6.0 
software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD) was used to analyze the 10×
 images to measure the FFUUV as the 
ratio of cells infected with the virus divided by the total number of cells.
Data analysis. 
The surviving fraction (S) of the virus was calculated by dividing the fraction of cells that 
yielded positive virus growth at each UV dose (FFUUV) by the fraction at zero dose (FFUcontrols): S = FFUUV/
FFUcontrols. Survival values were calculated for each repeat experiment and natural log (ln) transformed to bring 
the error distribution closer to normal40. Linear regression was performed using these normalized ln[S] values 
as the dependent variable and UV dose (D, mJ/cm2) as the independent variable. Using this approach, the virus 
survival (S) was fitted to first-order kinetics according to the equation7:

where k is the UV inactivation rate constant or susceptibility factor (cm2/mJ). The regression was performed 
with the intercept term set to zero, which represents the definition of 100% relative survival at zero UV dose. 
Bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for the parameter k were calculated using R 3.2.3 software41. The virus inac-
tivation cross section, D95, which is the UV dose that inactivates 95% of the exposed virus, was calculated as 
D95 = −
