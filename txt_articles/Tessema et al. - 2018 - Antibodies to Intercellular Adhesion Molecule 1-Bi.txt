ABSTRACT
Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) medi-
ates parasite sequestration to the cerebral microvasculature via binding of DBL� do-
mains to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and is associated with severe ce-
rebral malaria. In a cohort of 187 young children from Papua New Guinea (PNG),
we examined baseline levels of antibody to the ICAM1-binding PfEMP1 domain,
DBL�3PF11_0521, in comparison to four control antigens, including NTS-DBL� and
CIDR1 domains from another group A variant and a group B/C variant. Antibody lev-
els for the group A antigens were strongly associated with age and exposure. Anti-
body responses to DBL�3PF11_0521 were associated with a 37% reduced risk of high-
density clinical malaria in the follow-up period (adjusted incidence risk ratio [aIRR] �
0.63 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.45 to 0.88; P � 0.007]) and a 25% reduction in
risk of low-density clinical malaria (aIRR � 0.75 [95% CI, 0.55 to 1.01; P � 0.06]),
while there was no such association for other variants. Children who experienced se-
vere malaria also had significantly lower levels of antibody to DBL�3PF11_0521 and
the other group A domains than those that experienced nonsevere malaria. Further-
more, a subset of PNG DBL� sequences had ICAM1-binding motifs, formed a distinct
phylogenetic cluster, and were similar to sequences from other areas of endemicity.
PfEMP1 variants associated with these DBL� domains were enriched for DC4 and
DC13 head structures implicated in endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) binding
and severe malaria, suggesting conservation of dual binding specificities. These re-
sults provide further support for the development of specific classes of PfEMP1 as
vaccine candidates and as biomarkers for protective immunity against clinical P. fal-
ciparum malaria.

alaria due to infection with Plasmodium falciparum remains a major global public
health issue, with more than 400,000 deaths and 215 million symptomatic
episodes each year (1). Children with limited prior exposure to malaria bear the majority
of the disease burden; however, naturally acquired immunity eventually develops with
age and exposure and is associated with the acquisition of a diverse repertoire of
antibodies to parasite-encoded variant antigens on the infected erythrocyte surface (2).
The major target of this immunity is P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1
(PfEMP1) (3, 4), which is differentially encoded by up to 60 highly polymorphic var
genes per parasite genome (5–7). Expression of diverse PfEMP1/var gene variants
allows clonal antigenic variation (8, 9) and cytoadhesion to a wide variety of host
molecules, including chondroitin sulfate A (10), CD36 (11), endothelial protein C
receptor (EPCR) (12), and intercellular cytoadhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) (13). Adhesion
occurs via specialized PfEMP1 domains, known as Duffy binding like (DBL) and cysteine-
rich interdomain region (CIDR) (7). While antibodies to PfEMP1 in general have been
shown to be important mediators of protection against symptomatic malaria, the
specific PfEMP1 variants targeted by protective immune responses are poorly under-
stood.
var genes have been classified into three major groups (A, B, and C) based on
chromosome orientation and conserved structural and sequence features, and in
addition, there exists a group of chimeric genes (B/A), also known as domain cassette
8 (DC8) (14). Group A and B/A var genes are expressed in parasites isolated from
children with severe disease and are upregulated in cytoadherent parasites linked to
pathogenesis (reviewed in references 15 and 16). PF11_0521 and PFD1235w are group
A var genes that contain ICAM1-binding DBL� domains (17–19). Infected erythrocytes
colocalize with ICAM1 expression in the brain blood vessels, suggesting that ICAM1
mediates parasite sequestration in cerebral malaria (20). These genes also belong to the
subclass of group A PfEMP1 variants that have adjacent CIDR domains that bind EPCR
(21), another important host-parasite interaction implicated in severe malaria (12). Dual
binding to these host receptors has been linked to cerebral malaria (21). To our
knowledge, only one study, conducted in Tanzanian children, has found an association
between high levels of antibodies against the ICAM1-binding DBL� domain of
PF11_0521 (DBL�3PF11_0521) and a reduced risk of severe malaria (22). The role of
antibodies against ICAM1-binding DBL� in protection against clinical and severe ma-
laria is thus not well understood and has not been studied outside sub-Saharan Africa.
Considering the diverse functional roles of different PfEMP1 variants and domains,
protective immunity would be expected to vary considerably among different PfEMP1
subgroups and cytoadherent domains. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate
whether antibodies against DBL�3PF11_0521 are associated with protection against
clinical and severe malaria in comparison to domains from other PfEMP1 variants not
associated with ICAM1 binding or severe malaria (23, 24). The study was conducted in
a longitudinal cohort of very young (age, 1 to 3 years) children from Papua New Guinea
(PNG) who were actively acquiring immunity to malaria (25) to minimize the back-
ground of diverse PfEMP1 antibodies that are acquired with high malaria exposure
(25–27). Plasma antibody levels were measured at baseline and associated with a
prospective risk of uncomplicated (clinical) and severe malaria. To explore the PfEMP1
landscape of PNG, we also investigated the presence of ICAM1-binding motifs and the
associated domain architecture of var genes among 125 P. falciparum isolates from
three distinct geographic areas. The results support a role for PfEMP1 variants contain-
ing ICAM1-binding DBL� as targets for protective antimalarial immunity.
RESULTS
Group A PfEMP1 domains are serodominant among young PNG children.
Baseline plasma samples from a longitudinal cohort of 187 1- to 3-year-old children
from the Maprik area of East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, followed for 16 months
(25) were screened for antibodies (IgG) to five PfEMP1 domains, including the ICAM1-
binding DBL�3PF11_0521, and four control antigens. They included two domains from a

 group A variant, PF13_0003, which has a DBL�3 domain but does not have an
ICAM1-binding motif (NTS-DBL�1.6PF13_0003 and CIDR�PF13_0003) and two domains from
a group B/C variant, PFL1955w (NTS-DBL�0.16PFL1955w and CIDR�3.4PFL1955w). Among
the children, seroprevalence was 2.5- to 4-fold higher for the three type A PfEMP1
domains (40.1% for DBL�3PF11_0521, 27.8% for CIDR�PF13_0003, and 24.1% for NTS-
DBL�1.6PF13_0003) than for the type B/C domains (11.2% for NTS-DBL�0.16PFL1955w and
10.1% for CIDR�3.4PFL1955w) (Fig. 1A). Pairwise comparisons of antibody responses to
the five domains showed that seropositivity to DBL�3PF11_0521 was significantly higher
than to all the other domains. In addition, seropositivity to group A domains was
significantly higher than to the group B domains (see Table S1 in the supplemental
material). Similarly, a combined analysis of seropositivity to any one of the group A
PfEMP1s (55%) was significantly higher than the seropositivity to any one of the group
B/C domains (18.7%) after correcting for multiple comparisons (P � 0.003; Bonferroni
adjusted pairwise t test).
There was a low but significant correlation between antibody responses to
DBL�3PF11_0521 and NTS-DBL�1.6PF13_0003 (Spearman’s rho [rs] � 0.36; P � 0.0001). This
was also the case for the two type A PF13_0003 domains (rs � 0.36; P � 0.0001). In
contrast, there was no significant correlation between the two group B PFL1955w
domains (rs � 0.11; P � 0.135) or between domains from the different var gene
subgroups (Fig. 1B). These low but significant correlations among the group A domains
are explained by the predominant expression of and exposure to type A PfEMP1
variants in early childhood infections (23, 24, 28, 29).
Antibodies to five PfEMP1 domains are differentially associated with age and
infection status. To investigate whether past and current exposures to malaria influ-
ence responses to the five PfEMP1 domains, we investigated associations of antibody

 levels for each of the domains with age and infection status. Children were split into
two groups on the basis of their median age (1.7 years), and median antibody
responses were compared. Antibody levels were significantly higher in the older
children for group A but not group B/C domains (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the older children
had more past exposure to group A antigens than younger children, whereas group B/C
domains were similarly recognized irrespective of age. Concurrent microscopic para-
sitemia (median � 3,349 parasites/�l) at the time of antibody measurement was
associated with significantly higher antibody levels than in the noninfected individuals
for all domains except group B NTS-DBL�0.16PFL1955w (P � 0.94; Wilcoxon rank sum
test) (Fig. 2B), which was poorly reactive overall. Children who were infected at
enrollment were 3.43 times more likely to be seropositive to at least one of the five
PfEMP1 domains than noninfected children (range, 1.6 to 7.8; P � 0.002). Therefore,
current infection appeared to boost antibody levels for all antigens across the cohort.
Antibodies to DBL�3PF11_0521 but not those to other domains are associated
with reduced risk of high-density clinical malaria. To examine whether antibody
responses against any of the domains were associated with protection against clinical
malaria, we conducted a prospective analysis of the risk of febrile episodes and
antibody responses. Associations between plasma antibody levels and subsequent risk
of symptomatic malaria (all clinical episodes [fever and �2,500 parasites/�l] and
high-density clinical malaria [fever and �10,000 parasites/�l]) were determined by
grouping individuals into terciles and comparing high- and low-antibody groups. An

 important feature of the analysis is the adjustment for confounding variables at the
individual level, such as the molecular force of blood-stage infection (molFOB) (see
Materials and Methods). Children with high levels of antibodies to DBL�3PF11_0521 had
a 37% reduction in risk of high-density clinical malaria that was highly significant
(febrile illness with �10,000 parasites/�l; adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] � 0.63
[95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.45 to 0.88; P � 0.007]) and a 25% reduced risk of clinical
malaria that was borderline significant (febrile illness with �2,500 parasites/�l; aIRR �
0.75 [95% CI, 0.55 to 1.01; P � 0.06]). However, there was no significant reduction in risk
in either presentation of clinical malaria for the other four domains tested (Fig. 3).
Children who developed severe malaria had significantly lower levels of antibod-
ies to DBL�3PF11_0521. Having determined that antibody responses to DBL�3PF11_0521
were associated with protection against clinical malaria, and in particular high-density
clinical malaria, a biomarker for severe disease, we then wanted to examine antibody
responses in the children who experienced severe disease in the follow-up period.
According to WHO criteria (30), of the 187 children, 18 experienced severe P. falciparum
malaria during the follow-up period (25) (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). On
average, these children were similar to those who did not develop severe malaria with
respect to age (severe cases, 1.64 years, versus nonsevere cases, 1.89 years; P � 0.12)
and exposure, experiencing a similar number of distinct P. falciparum infections during
the follow-up period (severe, 5.19, and nonsevere, 5.17; P � 0.98). However, children
who experienced severe malaria had significantly lower levels of antibodies to
DBL�3PF11_0521 at baseline than those who did not develop severe malaria (Fig. 4) (P �
0.004). Children who developed severe malaria also had significantly lower levels of
antibodies to the other type A PfEMP1 domains (P � 0.01) and the type B/C domain
CIDR�3.4PFL1955w (P � 0.024). For the NTS-DBL�0.16PFL1955w domain with low reactivity,
there was no significant difference (P � 0.95) (Fig. 4).
PNG PfEMP1 proteins with ICAM1-binding DBL� domains are enriched for DC4
and DC13. The PF11_0521 PfEMP1 variant is from 3D7, an isolate with possible African
origin and dual binding activities with ICAM1 (via DBL�) and EPCR (via DC13) (21).
Previous studies investigating dual ICAM1-EPCR binding have focused on collections of
reference strains or field isolates from different geographic areas (21, 31). To determine
whether PNG isolates possess ICAM-binding motifs and to study the associated PfEMP1
domain architecture, we conducted a detailed analysis of var genes extracted from
whole-genome sequence data on 125 P. falciparum isolates from PNG. Among the
FIG 3 Antibody responses to five PfEMP1 domains and prospective risk of symptomatic malaria.
Antibody levels were grouped into three equal groups (high, medium, and low). The incidence rates of
clinical malaria and high-density clinical malaria were compared for high and low responders for each

residence, seasonal variation, age (continuous), infection status at the time of antibody measurement,
and differences in individual exposures (molFOB). The aIRRs for the comparison of high and low
responders and the 95% confidence intervals are shown. The P values are indicated only when significant

 genomes, we identified 4,044 full or partial open reading frames (ORFs) that were
classified as var genes using BLAST against a database of classified DBL and CIDR
domains (mean number of distinct PfEMP1s per genome � 32 [range: 1 to 60]; mean
coverage � 33 reads [range: 8 to 124]) (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). Of
those, 117 genomes contained 1,505 DBL� domains with a mean coverage of 35 reads
distributed among 1,420 var genes (i.e., many var genes had multiple DBL� domains).
For the 8 PNG genomes without DBL� domains, 6 had low coverage, resulting in poor
sampling of var genes (n � 1 to 6), while 2 isolates had higher coverage and contained
12 and 21 var genes. Among 1,505 PNG DBL� sequences (see Table S3 and Data Set S1
in the supplemental material), 81 contained the ICAM1-binding motif (21). They in-
cluded 47 DBL�1 (58%), 33 DBL�3 (41%), and 1 DBL�7 (1%) domains that were
distributed among 61 genomes and 80 var genes (1 var gene had two ICAM1-binding
motifs, DBL�1 and DBL�7) (see Table S4 in the supplemental material). To examine PNG
DBL� diversity in context with parasite populations of other malaria countries of
endemicity, 279 DBL� sequences from other countries and reference isolates, including
DBL�3PF11_0521 (linked to DC13) and DBL�3PFD1235w (another ICAM1-binding variant
linked to DC4 [18, 19]), were included in the analysis (see Data Set S1 in the supple-
mental material). Of these, 22 contained the ICAM1-binding motif, and they were found
within 11 DBL�1 (50%) and 11 DBL�3 (50%) domains (see Table S5 in the supplemental
material). All DBL�1 and -�3 domains from both data sets (406 PNG plus 178 other) (see
Data Sets S1 and S2 in the supplemental material) were then combined for multiple
alignments. Truncated sequences were removed, resulting in 455 sequences, including
102 with the ICAM1 motif. Phylogenetic analysis of the subdomain 3 (SD3) region
encompassing the ICAM1-binding motif revealed an “ICAM1-binding” cluster popu-
lated entirely by DBL� with the ICAM1-binding motif (Fig. 5A). The average evolution-
ary distance of the DBL� predicted to bind ICAM1 was 0.532 compared to 1.011 for the
remaining DBL�s. PNG DBL� sequences were distributed throughout the tree, and
there was no evidence of population structure. Of note, PF13_0003 contains a DBL�3
sequence; however, it did not contain an ICAM1-binding motif and was divergent from
sequences in the ICAM1-binding clade (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that the majority
of PNG parasites carry at least one PfEMP1 with predicted ICAM1 binding.
To determine the PfEMP1 context of DBL� with predicted ICAM1 binding, we
investigated the domain architecture of full-length var gene assemblies from the PNG
genomic sequence data with respect to adjacent domains and specific DC classes. All
PNG PfEMP1 sequences with DBL�1 and -�3 domains contained CIDR�1 domains (EPCR
binding). However, PfEMP1 proteins containing DBL� domains with the ICAM1 motif
(n � 80) (see Tables S3 and S4 in the supplemental material) were significantly enriched
for adjacent DC13 structures (46.3% compared to 20.5% among PfEMP1 proteins with
DBL� domains with no motif; P � 0.0001; binomial exact test) and DC4 (13.8%

 compared to 6.0%; P � 0.008; binomial exact test) (Fig. 5B; see Table S6 in the
supplemental material), which are strongly associated with severe malaria and dual
EPCR/ICAM1 binding (21, 31). In the phylogenetic analysis, DBL�s with adjacent DC4
and DC13 were divergent, although several DBL�s associated with DC4 were identical,
suggesting conservation of a common var gene (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental
material). Other DC structures, including DC8, DC16, and DC1-var1, were not found
among the PfEMP1 proteins with the ICAM1-binding motif (Fig. 5B). This suggests that
specific classes of PfEMP1 proteins with dual binding specificities for ICAM1 and EPCR
are maintained in PNG isolates, confirming previous observations in African isolates
(21).
DISCUSSION
PF11_0521 belongs to a class of group A PFEMP1 proteins with DBL� domains
shown to bind ICAM1 and found exclusively in PfEMP1 proteins with EPCR-binding
CIDR�1 (16, 32). These domains are adjacent to each other, and together, they may
produce a binding phenotype often associated with sequestration leading to cerebral

 malaria (13, 18–21, 31). Our results support a role for these PfEMP1 proteins in clinical
and severe malaria in young children by demonstrating that (i) antibodies against
DBL�3PF11_0521 are significantly associated with protection against high-density clinical
malaria, (ii) children who developed severe malaria had lower levels of antibodies to
DBL�3PF11_0521 prior to the disease episode (albeit antibodies to other antigens were
also lacking in these children), (iii) there are ICAM1-binding motifs present in DBL�
sequences from PNG isolates, and (iv) PfEMP1/var genes with predicted ICAM1 binding
are also predicted to bind EPCR (21, 31).
The cohort of 1- to 3-year-old PNG children was specifically chosen to explore early
antibody responses to PfEMP1, because their immunity to malaria was incomplete (25),
and to limit the complex background antibody responses that are observed in older
children and adults (27). Antibodies to PfEMP1 domains were associated with age and
current infection in the cohort, consistent with exposure driving the acquisition and
maintenance of immunity to malaria (2). In addition to the measurement of exposure
to new infections in the follow-up period (molFOB), these results provided a basis for
exploring associations with the risk of disease adjusted for important confounding
factors (33). Because the number of severe disease cases was small (n � 18), we initially
focused the prospective risk analysis on clinical infections, which occurred at a high rate
in these children (25). High-density clinical malaria (fever plus �10,000 parasites/�l) is
considered a surrogate marker for severe disease, since the children have intense
infections, yet are not classified into any of the severe-disease syndromes by WHO
criteria (30). The significant reduction in risk of these high-density clinical infections if
the children had high levels of DBL�3PF11_0521 antibodies suggests that inhibition of
ICAM1 binding or other binding phenotypes by antibodies against these PfEMP1
proteins may limit the parasite burden and progression to severe malaria. Antibodies to
DBL�3PF11_0521 have previously been associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization
with severe or moderately severe malaria in Tanzanian children (22), clearly demon-
strating a potentially protective immune response associated with exposure to PfEMP1
with DBL�3PF11_0521-like variants. Tanzanian children with high antibody reactivity to
CIDR�1 from the other confirmed ICAM1-binding protein, PFD1235w, also had a lower
risk of anemia (hemoglobin, �11 g/dl) and clinical malaria (34). Furthermore, ICAM1-
binding-inhibitory antibodies are common in hyperimmune adults living in areas of
endemicity (19), suggesting that they may play an important role in the maintenance
of clinical immunity. The mechanism of protection may be through direct inhibition of
ICAM1 binding, as shown in in vitro experiments (21, 32); indirectly, through prevention
of binding of other domains, such as EPCR-binding CIDR�1 (12); or synergistic antibody
responses targeting multiple domains.
While a broad repertoire of PfEMP1 antibodies was acquired in these young children,
only antibodies against the ICAM1-binding full-length DBL�3PF11_0521 domain were
associated with protection against both clinical and severe malaria. The results are
strengthened by the fact that children also acquired antibodies to domains from the
other group A PfEMP1 variants tested in this study (NTS-DBL�1.6PF13_0003 and
CIDR�PF13_0003), yet they were not associated with a reduced risk of clinical malaria. The
higher recognition of group A antigens in the children overall and the significantly
higher recognition in older children for group A, but not group B/C, antigens suggest
shared epitopes within this group of PfEMP1 variants and confirm a hierarchy of PfEMP1
exposure with age (27–29, 35). One caveat is the use of different assays for
DBL�3PF11_0521 and the control antigens, which prevented the direct comparison of
antibody units between antigens. However, the prospective risk analyses and compar-
ison between groups were done for each antigen independently, thus limiting poten-
tial biases of the different assays. Another limitation of this study is the small number
of PfEMP1 proteins and the lack of a direct comparison of DBL�3PF11_0521 with other
non-ICAM1-binding DBL� domains. Parallel analyses of antibody responses to a large
panel and variety of PfEMP1 domains will be a valuable extension of this study.
Dissecting the association of antibodies to different parasite antigens with protec-
tion and exposure is important in understanding naturally acquired immunity to

 malaria (33). In the same cohort, high levels of antibodies to merozoite antigens were
predictive of an increased risk of developing clinical malaria (33). In older PNG children
aged 5 to 14 years, however, antibodies against merozoite antigens were found to be
associated with protection against clinical malaria (33). Therefore, merozoite antigens
were biomarkers of accumulated malaria exposure in the younger age group; however,
with increasing exposure and responses of higher magnitude, antibodies to merozoite
antigens became biomarkers of protective immunity (33). We used molFOB as a marker
of exposure at an individual level to adjust for the confounding effects of exposure in
the prospective risk analysis (26, 33). We observed significant protection against clinical
malaria in children with high levels of DBL�3PF11_0521 antibodies despite these differing
exposures to malaria. That is, children who had antibodies to DBL�3PF11_0521 had lower
rates of clinical malaria than those who had low levels of these antibodies, even after
adjusting for individual differences in the rates of new malaria infections.
We also found an association between the lack of antibodies to DBL�3PF11_0521 and
other group A PfEMP1 domains and the prospective risk of severe malaria; however, in
this analysis, we also found associations with other antigens. Children who experienced
only uncomplicated or asymptomatic malaria had significantly higher levels of anti-
bodies to all three group A antigens and one of the group B antigens than children who
developed severe malaria in the follow-up period. Altogether, the observed association
of antibodies to DBL�3PF11_0521 with reduced risk of high-density clinical malaria and
severe malaria suggests epitopes in DBL�3PF11_0521-like sequences or adjacent PfEMP1
domains may be important targets of protective immunity. The association with other
domains in severe malaria may be due to the fact that we did not adjust for confound-
ers and is also consistent with the early acquisition (and potential protective effects) of
antibody responses to group A antigens compared to B antigens (27, 28, 35). However,
we cannot rule out the possibility that other domains tested are important targets of
protection against severe malaria.
The importance of host-parasite interactions via ICAM1 to the PNG parasite popu-
lation is indicated by the maintenance of a class of relatively conserved DBL� se-
quences with predicted ICAM1 binding (18, 21). Phylogenetic analysis of the C-terminal
DBL SD3 of DBL� sequences extracted from 125 parasite genomes from PNG, together
with those of geographically diverse isolates, identified a cluster of sequences previ-
ously shown (19, 21) or predicted to bind ICAM1 as distinguished by a common
sequence motif (21). Our data suggest that similar subsets of group A PfEMP1 proteins
with ICAM1-binding DBL�s are found in PNG parasites. The lower diversity of this group
of sequences compared to other non-ICAM1-binding DBL�1/3 suggests positive selec-
tion due to functional specialization for binding to ICAM1. We also found that DBL�
domains with ICAM1-binding motifs are located adjacent to domain cassettes associ-
ated with EPCR binding and severe disease (DC13 and DC4) (18, 20, 21). This assem-
blage is predicted to confer a dual-binding phenotype that has been associated with
severe malaria (12, 21). These results are consistent with the conservation of these
specialized classes of PfEMP1 proteins across large geographic distances, since previous
studies have focused on African parasites or reference isolates from diverse locations
(18, 21, 31). The high reactivity of children’s sera to the full-length DBL�PF11_0521
supports the notion that conserved epitopes exist that can be targeted by cross-
reactive and protective antibodies (18, 21, 32). However, the ICAM1-binding motif is
located in the C-terminal part of the protein (SD3 region), and no sequence traits in the
N-terminal part of the domain have been linked to ICAM1 binding. The protective
association may therefore be accounted for by epitopes outside the SD3 region or as
a result of its concurrence with other virulence-associated domains in the same PfEMP1.
Our analysis of antibodies to functionally diverse PfEMP1 domains extends previous
insights into early exposure to PfEMP1 (22, 27, 28, 35), revealing that young children
from PNG are highly exposed to group A antigens while having limited exposure to
group B/C antigens. The finding that high levels of antibodies against DBL�3PF11_0521
are associated with a reduced risk of high-density clinical and severe malaria supports
a role for PfEMP1 in malaria pathogenesis via ICAM1-binding domains or adhesion of

 adjacent domains. The demonstration that PNG P. falciparum isolates contain PfEMP1/
var genes with predicted ICAM1 binding closely linked to predicted EPCR-binding CIDR
domains suggests positive selection and functional specialization of a subclass of
dual-binding PfEMP1 proteins implicated in severe malaria syndromes. Studies inves-
tigating whether antibodies in clinically immune children interrupt binding interactions
between ICAM1 and this class of DBL� sequences would establish a more direct link to
protection against malaria. Antibodies to the EPCR-binding CIDR�1 domains cooccur-
ring with ICAM1-binding DBL� may have synergistic protective effects; however, this is
yet to be established. This study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the
development of specific classes of PfEMP1 proteins as vaccine candidates. Furthermore,
it suggests that this class of DBL� domains could be used as diagnostic antigens to
track population immunity during malaria elimination.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cohort study design. Plasma samples were collected during a longitudinal cohort survey conducted
in the East Sepik Province of PNG. A detailed description of the study has been published elsewhere (25,
26). Briefly, 190 children aged 1 to 3 years were enrolled at the start of the study in March 2006, and 74
additional children were enrolled over the following 6 months. The children were followed for 69 weeks
with active and passive follow-up (25). The children were visited fortnightly, with collection of 2 blood
samples 24 h apart for active detection of malaria infection every 8 to 9 weeks. The demographic and
clinical characteristics of the study population and incidences of clinical malaria and severe malaria in
each 8- to 9-week follow-up interval have been described in detail elsewhere (25, 26). Antibody assays
were performed on plasma samples collected from 187 of the 190 children enrolled in March 2006. Of
the 187 children, 48 (25.6%) were microscopy positive for P. falciparum. The average molFOB in this subset
of the cohort was 5.2, and the average number of clinical episodes was 2 per child per year at risk (25,
26). P. falciparum clinical episodes were defined as febrile illness (axillary temperature of �37.5°
C or
history of fever in the preceding 48 h) and �2,500 parasites/�l. A high-density clinical episode was
defined as febrile illness and �10,000 parasites/�l. The characteristics of children with severe malaria are
summarized in Table S2 in the supplemental material. Written informed consent was obtained before
enrollment of each child. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the PNG Institute of Medical
Research (10.21), the Medical Research Advisory Council of PNG (10.55), and the Walter and Eliza Hall
Institute of Medical Research (11.03).
Protein expression, purification, and refolding. DBL�3PF11_0521 (also known as DBL2�PF11_0521) was
expressed, purified, and refolded as described previously (17). As control PfEMP1 proteins without
ICAM1-binding activity, we selected NTS-DBL� and CIDR domains of two var genes of 3D7. PF13_0003
is a group A PfEMP1 that has been associated with the formation of rosettes, a phenotype linked with
severe malaria (36). In contrast, PFL1955w is a group B/C PfEMP1 with limited antibodies acquired in
young children (36). The sequences of all five domains are available in Text S1 in the supplemental
material.
NTS-DBL�1.6PF13_0003, CIDR�PF13_0003, NTS-DBL�0.16PFL1955w and CIDR�3.4PFL1955w codon-optimized
sequences were synthesized for Escherichia coli expression (GeneArt). The GenBank accession numbers
are PF13_0003 (XM_001349704) and PFL1955w (XM_001350761). Sequences were excised from the
supplier’s vector using BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the pProExHTb expression vector (Invitrogen),
which incorporates an N-terminal hexahistidine fusion tag. The vectors were then transformed into E. coli
strain BL21(DE3) for expression, as described previously (37). Briefly, the transformed cultures were
grown in superbroth, expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-�-D-galactopyranoside, and
the cultures were grown for a further 3 h at 37°
C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, lysed by
sonication, and processed as either insoluble inclusion bodies (NTS-DBL�1.6PF13_0003, CIDR�PF13_0003, and
NTS-DBL�0.16PFL1955w) or soluble proteins (CIDR�3.4PFL1955w).
NTS-DBL�1.6PF13_0003, CIDR�PF13_0003, and NTS-DBL�0.16PFL1955w proteins were deposited as insoluble
inclusion bodies. Cells were lysed by sonication, and the inclusion bodies were solubilized by the
addition of 6 M guanidine HCl, pH 8.0. The solubilized proteins were purified by metal-chelating
chromatography using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column (Qiagen) under reducing conditions.
Optimum refolding conditions were determined for each protein. The Ni-NTA-eluted CIDR�3.4PFL1955w
and the refolded CIDR�PF13_0003 proteins were purified using strong anion-exchange chromatography.
The proteins were eluted from a HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare), and the relevant fractions were pooled
and concentrated. For CIDR�3.4PFL1955w, the protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatog-
raphy. The refolded NTS-DBL�1.6PF13_0003 and NTS-DBL�0.16PFL1955w domains were further purified using
cation-exchange chromatography. The bound proteins were eluted from a HiTrap SP column (GE
Healthcare), and the relevant fractions were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by size exclusion
chromatography. The purity of each protein was assessed on SDS-PAGE gels and via Western immuno-
blots under standard conditions. Briefly, proteins were run on a 4 to 12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen).
Standard Western blotting procedures were performed for nonreduced and reduced (by addition of
�-mercaptoethanol) samples using nitrocellulose, and the immunoblots were processed with enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) substrates (GE Healthcare). For all Western blots, recombinant proteins were
detected with pooled hyperimmune sera from highly exposed PNG adults (see Fig. S1 in the supple-
mental material). A single batch of each protein was used for all serological screening. The purified

 proteins were assessed using a pool of hyperimmune plasma (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material),
and a single batch of each protein was used for all serological screening.
Measurement of antibody responses. Plasma samples collected at enrollment (n � 187) were
tested for antibodies comprising total immunoglobulin G (IgG) to DBL�3PF11_0521 using a standard
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For the other four domains, IgG levels were measured
using a cytometric bead array (CBA) as described previously (38). The details are described below.
ELISAs were performed to measure total IgG using standard methods. Ninety-six-well plates (Nunc,
Denmark) were coated with 1 �g/ml of DBL�3PF11_0521 recombinant protein in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and incubated overnight at 4°
C. PBS with 5% skim milk was used for blocking and PBS with 1% skim
milk and 0.05% Tween for diluting the plasma samples and antibodies. Plasma was added at 1-in-100
dilutions. For measurement of total IgG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG
(Southern Biotech, USA) was used at a dilution of 1 in 1,000. Finally, TMB microwell peroxidase substrate
(KPL, Inc., Australia) was added, the reaction was stopped using 1 M H3PO4, and the optical density (OD)
was measured at 450 nm. All the samples were tested in duplicate. Background (determined from wells
with no plasma) was deducted, and the threshold for a seropositive response was determined using
reactivities of 1:100-diluted plasma samples from anonymous malaria-naive Australian adults (n � 12).
The mean value among these negative-control plasma samples plus 3 standard deviations (SD) was used
as a cutoff value to define seropositivity.
CBAs were carried out using four sets of microbeads (BD Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) with distinct
and nonoverlapping fluorescence intensities covalently coupled to NTS-DBL�1PF13_0003, CIDR�PF13_0003,
NTS-DBL�0.16PFL1955w, and CIDR�3.4PFL1955w recombinant proteins according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, 150 �l of selected microbeads was sonicated for 1 min and incubated with 3.8 �l of 1
M dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 h at room temperature with agitation. The beads were washed 3 times and
resuspended in 40 �l of coupling buffer (BD Bioscience). Recombinant proteins (1-mg/ml concentration)
were activated by incubation with 4 �l of sulfosuccinimidyl 4-N-maleimidomethyl cyclohexane
1-carboxylate (2 mg/ml) for 1 h. The protein mixture was then run through a buffer exchange spin
column (Bio-Rad) preequilibrated with the coupling buffer (BD Bioscience). The activated protein was
added to the washed microbeads and allowed to conjugate for 1 h at room temperature with agitation.
Four microliters of N-ethylmaleimide (2 mg/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated for another
15 min. The conjugated microbeads were then washed, resuspended in 1 ml of storage buffer (BD
Bioscience), and kept at 4°
C in the dark. For assessment of antibody responses, 1 �l of conjugated
microbeads was diluted in 50 �l of washing buffer (BD Bioscience) containing 1-in-100 dilutions of
plasma samples. Duplicate samples were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark,
washed, and further incubated with mouse anti-human IgG phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibody (BD
Bioscience) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the samples were resuspended in diluent buffer
containing PE (BD Bioscience) and acquired using an LSR Fortessa analyzer (Becton Dickinson, New
Jersey, USA). Analysis was performed using FlowJo software, and the median fluorescence intensity (MFI)
for each bead (recombinant protein) was calculated. Background (determined from the unconjugated
beads with plasma samples and conjugated beads with no plasma samples) was deducted from the
mean of each sample. The threshold for a seropositive response was determined using reactivities of
1:100-diluted plasma samples from anonymous malaria-naive Australian adults (n � 12). The mean value
among these negative-control plasma samples plus 3 SD was considered seropositive. The analysis was
done independently for each antigen.
A serial dilution of plasma samples from a pool of hyperimmune PNG adults was included in each
plate to determine standard curves, which were later fitted using a 5-parameter logistic regression model
(39) to transform antibody measured by the two assays into relative antibody units and to correct
plate-to-plate variations within an assay.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 12.1 software (Stata
Corporation, USA). Differences in median antibody levels by age group and P. falciparum infection status
were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The proportions of children seropositive to different
domains were compared using chi-square tests. Correlation coefficients for antibody levels were deter-
mined using Pearson’s correlation.
Analyses of the cohort data showed significant overdispersion in the number of clinical episodes per
child (25), and as a result, a negative binomial model with generalized estimating equations (GEE) (based
on the xtnberg function in STATA) with an exchangeable correlation structure and a semirobust variance
estimator was used for the analyses of the association of antibody levels and the incidence of clinical
(fever with �2,500 parasites/�l) and high-density clinical (febrile illness and �10,000 parasites/�l)
episodes during the follow-up period. Antibody levels were grouped into terciles (low, medium, and high
responses), and their association with clinical and high-density clinical episodes was assessed by
univariate analyses adjusted for seasonal variation, village of residence, age at the time of enrollment, P.
falciparum infection status, and individual exposure, as measured by the molFOB. The molFOB is the
number of genetically distinct P. falciparum clones (based on msp2 genotyping) each child acquired per
year at risk (26).
Sequence analyses. To identify ICAM1-binding DBL� domains and corresponding full-length
PfEMP1 sequences in the PNG parasite population, we extracted var gene sequences from the genomes
of 125 clinical P. falciparum isolates collected from three distinct geographic areas of PNG. These isolates
were sequenced as part of the MalariaGEN Community Project (European Nucleotide Archive [ENA]
accession numbers are listed in Table S3 in the supplemental material). Illumina short-read data
sequences were assembled using Velvet version 1.2.03 (40). Open reading frames were extracted using
Virtual Ribosome ORF finder (41), and var gene-encoded PfEMP1 domain sequences were extracted from

 these by BLAST using a library of previously annotated PfEMP1 domain sequences from 7 reference
genomes and classified into subgroups as previously described (42). All DBL� domains were extracted
from the PNG data set (n � 1,505 [see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material]) and complemented
with a supplementary data set from 226 assembled genomes sequenced in the MalariaGEN Community
Project (43) and 7 reference genomes (42), including confirmed ICAM1-binding DBL� domains of
PF11_0521 and PFD1235w (18) (n � 279) (see Data Set S2 in the supplemental material). DBL� sequences
were screened for a relaxed version of the ICAM1 motif, N-G-G-[PA]-x-Y-x(27)-G-P-P-x(3)-H (21), using the
Web-based server Scan Prosite (44). All sequences from the DBL� classes with ICAM1-binding motifs
(DBL�1 and DBL�3) were aligned using Muscle with default settings in MEGA version 7.0 (37). After
removing truncated sequences (n � 40) and focusing on the S3 region of DBL�, which contains the
ICAM1-binding motif (21), we then conducted a phylogenetic analysis using a total of 367 PNG DBL�1
and DBL�3 sequences originating from PNG isolates, together with 89 DBL�1 and DBL�3 sequences from
the supplementary data set. A maximum likelihood tree was estimated using the JTT substitution model
with 1,000 bootstrap repetitions in MEGA version 7.0 (45). We measured the average evolutionary
divergence among sequences using the Dayhoff model in MEGA version 7.0 (45). In addition, we
characterized the domain architecture of PfEMP1 with DBL�1 and DBL�3 domains by extracting the
domain classifications from the BLAST output (see Table S6 in the supplemental material). We then
assessed whether the frequency of each domain cassette among the ICAM1-motif containing sequences
varied significantly from the expected frequency (among a subset of 331 PfEMP1 proteins with DBL�1/3
domains) using an exact binomial test with R software (46).
