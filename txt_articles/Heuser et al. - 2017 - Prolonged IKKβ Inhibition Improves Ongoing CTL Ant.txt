SUMMARY
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) prevent autoimmunity
but limit antitumor immunity. The canonical NF-kB
signaling pathway both activates immunity and pro-
motes thymic Treg development. Here, we report
that mature Tregs continue to require NF-kB signaling
through IkB-kinase b (IKKb) after thymic egress. Mice
lacking IKKb in mature Tregs developed scurfy-like
immunopathology due to death of peripheral FoxP3+
Tregs. Also, pharmacological IKKb inhibition reduced
Treg numbers in the circulation by �50% and downre-
gulated FoxP3 and CD25 expression and STAT5
phosphorylation. In contrast, activated cytotoxic
T lymphocytes (CTLs)wereresistanttoIKKbinhibition
because other pathways, in particular nuclear factor
of activated T cells (NFATc1) signaling, sustained their
survival and expansion. In a melanoma mouse model,
IKKb inhibition after CTL cross-priming improved
the antitumor response and delayed tumor growth.
In conclusion, prolonged IKKb inhibition decimates
circulating Tregs and improves CTL responses when
commenced after tumor vaccination, indicating that
IKKb represents a druggable checkpoint.
INTRODUCTION
IkB-kinase b (IKKb) is a central element of the canonical NF-kB
signaling pathway that mediates the development and activation
of immune cells (Gerondakis et al., 2014; Hayden and Ghosh,
2012; Vallabhapurapu and Karin, 2009). For instance, mice lack-
ing IKKb in T cells lose cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function and
succumb to otherwise spontaneously rejected tumors (Barnes
et al., 2015). Thus, the NF-kB pathway is generally considered
to promote inflammation, and IKKb inhibitors are currently being
tested for the treatment of inflammatory diseases (Gasparini and
Feldmann, 2012; Ziegelbauer et al., 2005). They are also consid-
ered for therapy of certain tumors whose growth depends on
IKKb. However, potential adverse effects on antitumor immunity
raised concerns that they might worsen disease (Zhang et al.,
2017).
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical to maintain self-tolerance
by inhibiting autoreactive T and B cells (Gavin et al., 2007; Gotot
et al., 2012; Sakaguchi et al., 2008). NF-kB induces the forkhead/
winged-helix box P3 (FoxP3) transcription factor during thymic
development of Tregs (Gavin et al., 2007; Gerondakis et al.,
2014), and IKKb deletion in thymocytes prevents the develop-
ment of Tregs (Schmidt-Supprian et al., 2003). Also, genetic
FoxP3 loss prevents Treg development, resulting in severe auto-
immunity and auto-inflammation, referred to as immunodysre-
gulation, polyendocrinopathy, and enteropathy X-linked (IPEX)
syndrome (Powell et al., 1982) in humans and scurfy phenotype
in mice (Godfrey et al., 1991). The role of IKKb in peripheral Tregs
(i.e., after thymic maturation) is incompletely understood (Geron-
dakis et al., 2014).
Tregs also suppress antitumor responses and thus limit the
success of tumor immunotherapies. Tregs consume IL-2 via
the high-affinity IL-2 receptor and thereby deprive cytotoxic
CD8+ T cells (CTLs) of mitogenic signals (Savage et al., 2013).
CTLs require IKKb for the post-thymic induction of the IL-7

 receptor (Silva et al., 2014) that enables STAT5- and Bcl-2-
dependent survival. T cell receptor-mediated activation of
CTLs rewires their survival signaling toward calcineurin-depen-
dent Bcl-xL expression and calcineurin-independent repression
of Bcl-2 (Koenen et al., 2013). This model suggests that activated
CTLs lacking calcineurin signaling will die, hinting at a role of the
transcription factor NFATc1, which is regulated by calcineurin
(Klein-Hessling et al., 2017). NFATc1 can also be induced by
NF-kB (Hock et al., 2013), yet IKKb-deficient CTLs were able
to expand in a tumor model (Barnes et al., 2015). The precise
roles of NFATc1 and NF-kB in CTL survival thus requires further
analysis.
In contrast to the principal role in immune activation, recent
studies
using
cell
type-specific
and
conditional
deletion
approaches revealed anti-inflammatory functions of certain
NF-kB components: IKKb deletion in non-immune cells such
as keratinocytes promoted inflammation (Pasparakis, 2009)
and stimulated IL-1b production in myeloid cells (Greten et al.,
2007). Deletion of TGF-b-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which is up-
stream of IKKb, reduced Treg numbers in mice and caused mild
autoimmunity (Chang et al., 2015). Also dendritic cells (DCs)
require NF-kB, both to induce immunity and to maintain immune
tolerance (Baratin et al., 2015; Dissanayake et al., 2011). Thus,
NF-kB has both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions, but which
of them prevails in vivo is unclear.
We recently observed that prolonged treatment with the
IKKb inhibitor KINK-1 (kinase inhibitor of NF-kB-1) surprisingly
aggravated a T helper (Th) cell-mediated kidney disease model
(Gotot et al., 2016). Given that NF-kB activation promotes
FoxP3 expression (Ruan et al., 2009; Schuster et al., 2012;
Zheng et al., 2010) and that CD25 signaling promotes Treg
survival (Furtado et al., 2002), we hypothesized that mature
Tregs may require IKKb for expansion, maintenance, and/or
recruitment. We investigated this hypothesis using genetic
and pharmacological approaches and found an unexpected
pro-inflammatory effect of sustained IKKb inhibition that
may be exploited to invigorate CTL responses after tumor
vaccination.
RESULTS
Mice Lacking IKKb in Tregs Develop a Phenotype
Identical to Scurfy Mice
We recently noted lower Treg numbers after prolonged IKKb in-
hibition in a kidney disease model (Gotot et al., 2016). To inves-
tigate whether Tregs require cell-intrinsic IKKb, we crossed
IKKbfl/fl mice (Park et al., 2002) with FoxP3Cre mice (Rubtsov
et al., 2008) to generate mice whose FoxP3-expressing cells
lacked IKKb (termed FoxP3DIKKb mice). Strikingly, already
2–4 weeks after birth, these mice were severely compromised
and died before reaching adulthood. On day 21, they displayed
reduced agility, their skin was scaly, and their tails showed
padded rings (Figure 1A). This phenotype was identical to that
of FoxP3-deficient and of scurfy mice, which lack Tregs because
of the absence or a mutation of the Foxp3 gene, respectively,
and which die at young age of unrestrained systemic inflamma-
tion (Gavin et al., 2007; Godfrey et al., 1991). Like these mice,
FoxP3DIKKb mice showed enlarged lymph nodes and spleens
(Figure 1B) and severe mononuclear infiltration and tissue dam-
age in spleen, lung, and skin (Figure 1C). Peripheral organs of
FoxP3DIKKb mice contained hardly any FoxP3+ Tregs (Figures
1D, 1E, and S1A–S1C), and most splenic T cells displayed an
activated CD44+CD62L– phenotype (Figure S1D). By contrast,
the thymi of FoxP3DIKKb mice showed unaltered architecture
(Figure S1E) and contained normal Treg frequencies (Figures
1F and S1C), indicating intact thymic Treg generation. RT-PCR
detected an IKKb signal in FoxP3+ thymocytes but not in the re-
maining FoxP3+ splenocytes of FoxP3DIKKb mice, indicating that
the IKKb message must have been excised after thymic exit (Fig-
ure S1F). This is consistent with studies showing that FoxP3
is upregulated late during thymic Treg generation (Gerondakis
et al., 2014). When we transferred IKKb-competent wild-type
Tregs into newborn FoxP3DIKKb mice, these animals developed
normally (Figure 1G), demonstrating that Treg-intrinsic IKKb
was sufficient to prevent the scurfy phenotype of FoxP3DIKKb
mice.
Tregs Require IKKb for Peripheral Homeostasis, Not for
Suppressive Functionality
To investigate whether the peripheral survival of IKKb-deficient
Tregs was compromised, we pooled the splenocytes from
several FoxP3DIKKb or FoxP3Cre mice and transferred them into
IKKb-competent RAG1–/– mice. After 7 days, we noted that
the few remaining YFP+ Tregs from FoxP3DIKKb mice had under-
gone homeostatic proliferation, like Tregs from IKKb-competent
FoxP3Cre control mice (Figure 2A). However, only the IKKb-com-
petent Tregs accumulated, whereas the deficient ones were lost
from the RAG1–/– recipients (Figure 2B). No difference in the sur-
vival of YFP–CD4+ T cells from FoxP3DIKKb and control mice was
evident (Figure 2C). Both IKKb-competent and IKKb-deficient
Tregs suppressed the response of cocultured activated Th cells
by 70% and 90%, respectively (Figure 2D). Thus, functional
Tregs were generated in the thymi of FoxP3DIKKb mice but
were lost after release into the circulation, explaining the scurfy
phenotype.
Based on these findings, we predicted that pharmacological
IKKb inhibition might induce the death of wild-type FoxP3+
Tregs. We tested this notion by injecting the IKKb inhibitor
KINK-1 into FoxP3LuciDTR mice, which express a FoxP3-lucif-
erase reporter to allow noninvasive in vivo semiquantification
of Tregs through luminescence imaging (Suffner et al., 2010).
After 7–14 days of KINK-1 treatment every second day, the
FoxP3 signal was reduced by �40% (Figure 2E). Flow cytomet-
ric analysis after 15 days showed almost 50% less splenic
FoxP3+ Tregs, whereas Th cells, CTLs (Figure 2F), and total
numbers of circulating leukocytes (data not shown) remained
normal, indicating that systemic IKKb inhibition acted preferen-
tially on Tregs. DCs and macrophages showed elevated signs
of activation (Figure S2B), presumably because of the loss of
Tregs, consistent with our previous study on the effects of
KINK-1 in myeloid cells (Gotot et al., 2016). Scurfy symptoms
were not observed under KINK-1 treatment, consistent with
the reduction of Tregs by only 50%. Daily or twice daily injec-
tion of KINK-1 did not significantly improve Treg depletion
and higher KINK-1 doses impaired also the CTL response
(Figure S2C).

 Activated CTLs Are Less Dependent on IKKb Than Tregs
Because of Additional Signaling Pathways
In vivo KINK-1-treatment reduced not only the FoxP3 reporter
signal (Figure 2E) but also CD25 expression on wild-type Tregs
(Figure 3A). CD25 and FoxP3 levels were even more reduced
in the few Tregs of FoxP3DIKKb mice (Figure 3B), and more of
them were caspase-3+ (Figure 3C), demonstrating that they
were undergoing apoptosis in vivo. To study a potential link be-
tween IKKb, FoxP3, CD25, and survival in Tregs, we cultured
wild-type Tregs in the presence of KINK-1. This reduced dose-
dependently FoxP3 and CD25 expression and STAT5 phosphor-
ylation (Figures 3D and S3A) and caused more Tregs to undergo
apoptosis in vitro (Figures 3E–3G). As IL-2-induced CD25
signaling prompts CD25 and FoxP3 expression and maintains
survival of Tregs (Furtado et al., 2002), we added IL-2 to the cul-
ture. This restored FoxP3 and CD25 expression and STAT5
phosphorylation in KINK-1-treated Tregs (Figure 3D), suggesting
that IKKb inhibition might deprive Tregs from sensing IL-2 as a
survival signal. By contrast, treatment with an IKKa inhibitor
had only mild effects on Treg numbers and their FoxP3 expres-
sion (Figure S3B), indicating that Treg survival required IKKb.
After 18 hr of culture with KINK-1, less than 60% of the Tregs
had survived, whereas the survival of Th cells and CTLs and of
vehicle-treated Tregs was unaffected (Figure 3H), indicating a
preferential effect of KINK-1 on Tregs. We therefore asked why
effector T cells were resistant to KINK-1 treatment, although
they also use NF-kB signaling (Hayden and Ghosh, 2012).
The transcription factor NFATc1 has been reported to mediate
survival of CTLs but not of Tregs (Vaeth et al., 2012). To clarify
whether effector T cells require this factor, we cultured
NFATc1-deficient CTLs, Tregs, and Th cells with KINK-1.
Although Th cells survived independent of IKKb, NFATc1, and
both, CTL indeed started to die when both IKKb and NFATc1
were incapacitated (Figure 3H). This indicated that CTLs, but
not Th cells, used NFATc1 for survival when IKKb was blocked.
The survival of Tregs was not further compromised when
NFATc1 was absent (Figure 3H).
When we examined CTL expansion, they were less abun-
dant when they lacked NFATc1 or when KINK-1 was present
throughout the culture period. Importantly, CTLs could expand
when KINK-1 was added 24 hr after their activation, unless
NFATc1 was deleted (Figure 3I), indicating that CTLs required

IKKb Inhibition after CTL Priming Improves Protection
in a Tumor Vaccination Model
Tregs can hamper antitumor immunity by inhibiting CTLs (Savage
et al., 2013). Our findings above suggested that the ability of
KINK-1 to target Tregs but not that CTLs might improve the de-
fense against tumors. We tested this hypothesis in the B16-
OVA melanoma mouse model. To exclude that KINK-1 might
act directly on the tumor, we engineered IKKb-deficient mela-
noma cells (Figures S4A and S4B) and established that these
grew in vivo like wild-type melanoma cells (Figure S4C). On
day 9 after implanting IKKb-deficient tumor cells, we treated

the mice with KINK-1 and/or a Treg-block-
ing/depleting antibody. However, tumor
growth was unaltered (Figure S4D), poten-
tially because reducing Tregs to 50%
did not sufficiently enhance the endoge-
nous antitumor response. Therefore, we
decided to boost this response by vacci-
nating with a tumor antigen (Figure 4A),
in order to boost cross-priming of anti-
tumor CTLs (Kurts et al., 2010). Tumor
vaccination alone delayed tumor growth
somewhat
in
a
CD8+
cell-dependent
manner (Figures 4B and S4E). In view of
our observations above (Figures 3F and
3G), we commenced KINK-1 treatment
on day 3 after vaccination (i.e., after the
CTL activation phase). Indeed, KINK-1 de-
layed tumor growth even more (Figure 4B)
and noticeably enhanced the tumor anti-
gen-specific CTL response (Figure 4C).
KINK-1-treated
mice
survived
signifi-
cantly longer than vehicle-treated mice
(Figure 4D), confirming that prolonged IKKb inhibition after tumor
vaccination can enhance the antitumor defense.
Already after two KINK-1 applications, STAT5 signaling in Tregs
was impaired both in secondary lymphatic organs and within the
tumor (Figure 4E), indicating that Tregs had sensed less IL-2
survival signals. To investigate whether KINK-1 treatment can
improve CTL recruitment into the tumor, we injected activated
OT-I cells into tumor-bearing, vaccinated mice. Indeed, more

M1 polarization (Figure S4F). Moreover, more eosinophils were
detected in the tumor (Figure S4G) under KINK-1 treatment.
Both of these have been reported to occur after depleting Tregs
in FoxP3LuciDTR mice bearing melanoma (Carretero et al., 2015),
suggesting that they might have contributed to the superior
antitumor response resulting from KINK-1 treatment after tumor
vaccination.
DISCUSSION
NF-kB is critical for both the activation and the activity of immune
cells, including DCs and T cells (Hayden and Ghosh, 2012), and

to prevent unwanted immune responses.
In the present study, we discovered that
mice lacking IKKb in Tregs developed full
scurfy-like immunopathology due to the
absence of peripheral Tregs and suc-
cumbed at 3–5 weeks of age. Previous
studies
had
shown
that
NF-kB
was
required for thymic Treg development. In
contrast, in our model, Tregs matured in
the thymus, because the IKKb gene was
excised late during their development.
Instead, they subsequently died after
release from the thymus when IKKb was
incapacitated, resulting in a scurfy-like
phenotype. IKKb may be linked to the
anti-apoptotic gene c-FLIP, whose dele-
tion in Tregs has recently been shown to
cause a scurfy-like phenotype as well
(Plaza-Sirvent et al., 2017). The few Tregs in FoxP3DIKKb mice
were functional, as they could suppress effector T cells, and
they did so somewhat more potently than wild-type Tregs. This
is consistent with the finding that NF-kB over-activation in Tregs
impairedtheirsuppressivecapacity(Longetal.,2009).Incontrast,
the canonical NF-kB component RelA was recently shown to be
important for activation and effector function of Tregs but not ho-
meostasis (Messina et al., 2016; Vasanthakumar et al., 2017). Our
findings show that Treg-intrinsic IKKb mediated the survival of
Tregs in the circulation.
These findings suggested that pharmacological IKKb inhibi-
tion should reduce Treg numbers in vivo, and this was verified
in mice treated with KINK-1 for more than 1 week. Also in vitro,
KINK-1 caused the death of Tregs, and this was preceded by

 the loss of FoxP3 and CD25 expression and of STAT5 signaling.
This may be explained by the presence of functional binding
sites for the NF-kB transcription factors in both the Foxp3 and
Il2ra genes (encoding CD25) (Ballard et al., 1988; Long et al.,
2009; Ruan et al., 2009; Schuster et al., 2012; Zheng et al.,
2010). Supplementation of IL-2 partially restored FoxP3 and
CD25 expression and Treg survival, consistent with the known
ability of IL-2 to maintain CD25 and FoxP3 expression, to coun-
teract pro-apoptotic activities of FoxP3 (Tai et al., 2013) and
hence to support Treg survival (Furtado et al., 2002). Thus,
IKKb inhibition likely compromised Treg homeostasis by down-
regulating FoxP3 and CD25 expression, so that they could no
longer sense the survival signal IL-2.
These findings explain our recent observation that inhibiting
IKKb a few days after inducing a Th cell-mediated murine
glomerulonephritis model aggravated the symptoms (Gotot
et al., 2016). Importantly, we had noted reduced intrarenal Treg
numbers, which can now be explained by compromised Treg
survival. These findings suggest that caution is warranted in ther-
apeutic attempts to treat inflammatory diseases by IKKb inhibi-
tion, because the loss of Tregs might aggravate rather than
attenuate inflammation.
At the same time, our findings uncovered an unexpected
opportunity to boost weak adaptive immune responses. CTL
responses against tumors are often curtailed by Tregs, and
checkpoint blockade that targets Tregs can overcome this
problem (Sharma and Allison, 2015). Therefore, we tested our
protocol in a melanoma tumor model. However, the endoge-
nous CTL response could not be invigorated sufficiently by
IKKb inhibition. This may be explained by the reduction of
Treg numbers by only 50% using our protocol, which a previous
tumor study found to be insufficient (Li et al., 2010). This reduc-
tion, however, sufficed to enhance antitumor CTL cross-priming
induced by vaccination with a tumor antigen, resulting in slower
melanoma growth and longer survival of tumor-bearing animals.
Thus, IKKb may indeed represent a pharmacologically relevant
antitumor therapy target. As our model was designed to rule out
effects of IKKb blockade on the tumor itself, it may underesti-
mate its effectivity in situations in which tumor cells also use
IKKb for survival (Zhang et al., 2017), which needs to be tested
in future studies.
The IKKb dependence of Tregs is consistent with the impor-
tance of NF-kB for immune cell activation, but it raised the
question why CTLs, which also use NF-kB, were unaffected by
KINK-1 treatment. A dose effect is certainly involved, as higher
KINK-1 doses were able to suppress CTLs in our hands. This
is consistent with a previous study showing that the complete
loss of IKKb signaling, achieved by genetic ablation, abrogated
the antitumor response against fibrosarcoma (Barnes et al.,
2015). We found that CTLs were more resistant than Tregs to
IKKb inhibition, because they used the transcription factor
NFATc1 that promoted CTL but not Treg survival (Klein-Hessling
et al., 2017; Vaeth et al., 2012). Although Tregs were unaffected
by the absence of NFATc1, CTLs started to die in vitro when in
addition to IKKb also NFATc1 was blocked. This is consistent
with a previously proposed model that NF-kB signals induce
NFATc1 components in effector T cells, including CTLs, which
then switch to NFATc1-controlled signaling (Hock et al., 2013;
Koenen et al., 2013). Our findings support this model, and indi-
cate that Tregs do not undergo this switch.
In summary, we found that mature Tregs rely on the canonical
NF-kB pathway and that genetic deletion or pharmacological in-
hibition of IKKb suspends Treg-mediated suppression of acti-
vated effector T cells, which use other pathways to counteract
apoptosis. It was important to commence IKKb inhibition after
tumor vaccination, because earlier KINK-1 application pre-
vented CTL activation, thereby abolishing antitumor immunity.
Hence, on a systemic level, sustained IKKb inhibition acts pre-
dominantly pro-inflammatory on ongoing immune responses,
uncovering an immune checkpoint that may be exploited for
invigorating tumor vaccination.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice and Reagents
FoxP3Cre mice carry a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-Cre recombinase
transgene in the Foxp3 locus. RAG1–/– mice are devoid of B and T cells.
FoxP3LuciDTR express eGFP, human diphtheria toxin receptor, and click beetle
luciferase from the endogenous Foxp3 locus. In CD4Cre 3 NFATc1fl/fl mice
(designated CD4DNFATc1 mice), NFATc1 is excised in T cells in the thymic dou-
ble-positive stage (Klein-Hessling et al., 2017). Mice were bred at the animal
facilities of the University Hospitals Bonn and Hamburg-Eppendorf under spe-
cific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. We used sex- and age-matched mice for
all experiments. Animal experiments were approved by governmental commit-
tees (Beho
¨ rde f€
ur Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz Hamburg and Lande-
samt f€
ur Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz NRW).
Pharmacological Inhibition of IKKb
KINK-1 (also known as Bay65-1942 and CpdA) (Ziegelbauer et al., 2005)
is a highly selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of IKKb (Ki = 2 nM). Off-target
activity (>40% inhibition at 1 mM) has been observed for PIM3, ERK8,
CAMK1, SGK1, and CDK2-Cyclin A (International Centre for Kinase Profiling,
MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit, University of Dundee; http://www.
kinase-screen.mrc.ac.uk/kinase-inhibitors). KINK-1 (Gotot et al., 2016; Ziegel-
bauer et al., 2005) was dissolved in 10% Kolliphor EL (Sigma-Aldrich) as
vehicle, and 5 mg/kg body weight was given subcutaneously (s.c.) at the
time points indicated in the figures and their legends.
Isolation and Adoptive Transfer of Tregs
Tregs were isolated from spleens of donor mice using a Treg isolation Kit
(Miltenyi). On day 3 after birth, 1.3 3 106 viable Tregs were injected intraperito-
neally (i.p.) in FoxP3DIKKb mice. For transfer of IKKb-deficient cells into RAG1–/–
mice, 105 viable splenocytes from FoxP3DIKKb or from control FoxP3Cre mice
were labeled with CellTrace violet (Life Technologies) and injected i.v.
In Vitro Suppression Assay
CD4+ YFP+ Tregs and CD4+ YFP– responder T cells were purified from
spleens of 7-day-old Foxp3Cre and FoxP3DIKKb mice by flow cytometry.
Cells were cultured at a 1:2 ratio in 96-well plates and activated with anti-
CD3/28 beads (Invitrogen) for 72 hr. Supernatant IL-2 concentration was
measured by ELISA.
Bioluminescence Imaging
FoxP3LuciDTR mice were imaged 5 min after i.p. injection of 4.5 mg d-luciferin
(SynChem) using the IVIS 100 Imaging System and Living Image software
(Xenogen) as previously described (Tittel et al., 2012).
In Vitro Inhibitor Treatment
Bulk splenocytes (1 3 105) were seeded into 96-well plates in X-VIVO 15 me-
dium (Lonza); incubated with KINK-1, the IKKa inhibitor BAY11-7082 (Scho
¨ n
et al., 2008), or the respective vehicle for 18 hr with 10 ng/mL IL-2, when indi-
cated; and analyzed using flow cytometry.

Cell Reports 21, 578–586, October 17, 2017
 CD8a+ T cells (5 3 104) were isolated by negative magnetic selection (Milte-
nyi) and seeded into 96-well flat-bottom plates coated with 1.25 mg/mL anti-
TCRb and 5 mg/mL anti-CD28 antibody.
Tumor Experiments
Mice were injected with 4 3 105 IKKb–/– B16-OVA cells s.c. into the flank. When
tumors reached 25 mm3 (day 8 or 9 after implantation), mice received 50 mg
ovalbumin (Sigma-Aldrich) + 10 nmol CpG 1668 (TIB Molbiol Berlin) s.c. as pre-
viously described (Klages et al., 2010). The tumor volume is given as (width 3
width 3 length)/2.
In Vivo Cytotoxicity Assay
Splenocytes were pulsed for 20 min at 37�C with SIINFEKL (2 mg/mL) and
labeled with 1 mM CFSE (CFSEhi) or were not pulsed and labeled with
0.1 mM CFSE (CFSElo) and injected as a 1:1 mix i.v. After 5 hr, target cells
were enumerated by flow cytometry. Specific lysis was calculated using the
following formula: percentage specific cytotoxicity = 100 � [100 3 (CFSEhi/
CFSElo) primed/(CFSEhi/CFSElo) control].
In Vitro Activation of OT-I Cells
Splenocytes from OT-I mice were pulsed with 10 mM SIINFEKL at 37�C for 1 hr
and cultured with 10 ng/mL rIL-12. After 2 days, the medium was replaced with
fresh medium containing 20 ng/mL rIL-2 (both Peprotech), and cells were
cultured for 5 days.
Statistical Analysis
Differences were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc anal-
ysis using the Mann-Whitney test, one-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni
test, or the log rank test (GraphPad Prism). Statistical significance was defined
as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
