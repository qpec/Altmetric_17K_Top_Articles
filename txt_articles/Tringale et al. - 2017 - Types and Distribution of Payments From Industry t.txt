IMPORTANCE Given scrutiny over financial conflicts of interest in health care, it is important
to understand the types and distribution of industry-related payments to physicians.
OBJECTIVE To determine the types and distribution of industry-related payments to
physicians in 2015 and the association of physician specialty and sex with receipt of payments
from industry.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observational, retrospective, population-based study
of licensed US physicians (per National Plan & Provider Enumeration System) linked to 2015
Open Payments reports of industry payments. A total of 933 295 allopathic and osteopathic
physicians. Outcomes were compared across specialties (surgery, primary care, specialists,
interventionalists) and between 620 166 male (66.4%) and 313 129 female (33.6%)
physicians using regression models adjusting for geographic Medicare-spending region and
sole proprietorship.
EXPOSURES Physician specialty and sex.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Reported physician payment from industry (including
nature, number, and value), categorized as general payments (including consulting fees and
food and beverage), ownership interests (including stock options, partnership shares),
royalty or license payments, and research payments. Associations between physician
characteristics and reported receipt of payment.
RESULTS In 2015, 449 864 of 933 295 physicians (133 842 [29.8%] women), representing
approximately 48% of all US physicians were reported to have received $2.4 billion in
industry payments, including approximately $1.8 billion for general payments, $544 million
for ownership interests, and $75 million for research payments. Compared with 47.7% of
primary care physicians (205 830 of 431 819), 61.0% of surgeons (110 604 of 181 372) were
reported as receiving general payments (absolute difference, 13.3%; 95% CI, 13.1-13.6; odds
ratio [OR], 1.72; P < .001). Surgeons had a mean per-physician reported payment value of
$6879 (95% CI, $5895-$7862) vs $2227 (95% CI, $2141-$2314) among primary care
physicians (absolute difference, $4651; 95% CI, $4014-$5288). After adjusting for
geographic spending region and sole proprietorship, men within each specialty had a higher
odds of receiving general payments than did women: surgery, 62.5% vs 56.5% (OR, 1.28;
95% CI, 1.26-1.31); primary care, 50.9% vs 43.0% (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.36-1.39); specialists,
36.3% vs 33.4% (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.13-1.17); and interventionalists, 58.1% vs 40.7% (OR, 2.03;
95% CI, 1.97-2.10; P < .001 for all tests). Similarly, men reportedly received more royalty or
license payments than did women: surgery, 1.2% vs 0.03% (OR, 43.20; 95% CI, 25.02-74.57);
primary care, 0.02% vs 0.002% (OR, 9.34; 95% CI, 4.11-21.23); specialists, 0.08% vs 0.01%
(OR, 3.67; 95% CI, 1.71-7.89); and for interventionalists, 0.13% vs 0.04% (OR, 7.98; 95% CI,
2.87-22.19; P < .001 for all tests).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE According to data from 2015 Open Payments reports, 48% of
physicians were reported to have received a total of $2.4 billion in industry-related payments,
primarily general payments, with a higher likelihood and higher value of payments to
physicians in surgical vs primary care specialties and to male vs female physicians.

F
inancial relationships between physicians and the bio-
medical industry are common.1 Concern for financial
conflictsofinterestandtheireffectonpatientcare,medi-
cal research, and education2,3 prompted the creation of the
OpenPaymentsprogram,4,5acomprehensive,nationwidepub-
lic data repository reporting industry payments to physicians
andteachinghospitals.PriortoOpenPayments,suchdatawere
gathered from physician self-report,1 a limited number of state
databases,6 and third-party data sources.7 Open Payments,
implemented under section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act
and managed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-
vices’(CMS), requires biomedical manufacturers and group
purchasing organizations (GPOs) to report all payments and
ownership interests made to physicians starting in 2013. The
recent release of the most current, complete, nationally rep-
resentative Open Payments data8 presents the opportunity to
analyze the distribution and variability of these financial re-
lationships among physicians.
Early studies of Open Payments data revealed specialty
variation in payments9,10 but did not account for other physi-
cian demographics. For example, sex differences in industry
relationships, especially given differential sex makeup across
specialties, are largely unexplored. In this study, Open Pay-
ments data from 2015 were analyzed to evaluate variability in
general payments, ownership interests, and royalty or license
payments, among specialty categories and by physician sex.
Methods
Thestudydesignwasanobservational,retrospective,population-
based analysis of physicians in the 2015 CMS National Plan
& Provider Enumeration System (NPPES)11 database linked
to 2015 Open Payment reports of industry payments to allo-
pathic and osteopathic physicians in the continental United
States. This study was approved by the University of California
San Diego Institutional Review Board.
Study Population
The study population consisted of all physicians or surgeons li-
censed to practice in the United States per the 2015 NPPES
database.5 The NPPES database includes all physicians with a
National Provider Identifier (NPI) and is the database against
whichOpenPaymentsphysicianrecordsareverified;therefore,
NPPES specialty counts were used to estimate the number of
physicians eligible for having a report in the Open Payments
database.10Theanalyseswerelimitedtophysiciansinallopathic
andosteopathicspecialtieswithinNPPESprovidertaxonomy.11
Datafromthe2015OpenPaymentsprogramincludingphy-
siciangeneralpayments,ownershipinterests,andresearchpay-
ment files were linked to the August 2015 NPPES database as

dents (but not fellows) and physicians who are employees of a
reporting entity. Inclusion and exclusion criteria of the NPPES
study population and matched Open Payments physicians are
shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement. These data are general-

specialists (ie, pathology, neurology) and interventionalists
(ie, cardiovascular disease, anesthesiology) based on the pro-
cedural nature of practice. Specifically, the definition of inter-
ventionalists was based on data showing that these subspecial-
tiesbillmorerelative-valueunitsforcommonprocedures,which
determine payment based on procedural-based codes (ie, colo-

Several medical specialties, such as endocrinology and infec-
tious disease, were categorized under internal medicine.

Key Points
Question What were the types and distribution of payments from
industry to physicians in 2015?
Findings In 2015, 449 864 (approximately 48%) of US physicians
were reported to have received a total of $2.4 billion in
industry-related payments, with a higher likelihood and higher
value of payments to physicians in surgical than to primary care
specialties and to male than to female physicians.
Meaning A substantial proportion of US physicians were reported
to have received payments from biomedical and pharmaceutical
industries in 2015. With increased scrutiny of the relationship
between industry promotion and clinical practice, understanding
physician characteristics associated with these financial
relationships is important.

contract or protocol, including payments for medical re-
search writing or publication.17 Ownership interests include
stocks or stock options, partnership shares, limited liability
company membership, bonds, or other financial instruments
secured by the reporting entity that were held by physicians.
Excluded from ownership interest were payments received as
compensation (until exercised), as part of a retirement plan,
or interest in a publicly traded security or mutual fund.
“Amount invested” is the total amount of the interest holding
gained by the physician during the reporting year. “Value of
interest” describes the cumulative value of ownership inter-
est per the most recent valuation.17
Statistical Analyses
Differences in industry payments among specialty categories
were assessed with χ2 and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Bivariable and
multivariable analyses were performed to investigate the as-
sociation between physician characteristics (primarily
specialty, as well as sex, geographic spending region, sole pro-
prietorship) and industry payments. Logistic regression
models were also used to examine the association between
physician characteristics and the odds of physicians receiv-
ing general payments, royalty or license payments, or hold-
ing ownership interests. Linear regression models were used
to examine the association between physician characteristics
and the value of general payments. Payment value data
were log-transformed prior to analysis to account for skew.10
Negative binomial regression models examined the associa-
tion between physician characteristics and the per-physician
annual number of general payments. All multivariable mod-
els controlled for potentially confounding variables available
for analysis,10 namely specialty, sex, geographic spending re-
gion,andsoleproprietorstatus.Toexaminesexwhileaccount-
ing for varied sex composition across specialties, multivari-
able models included an interaction term between specialty
and sex. A 2-tailed P value of <.001 was considered signifi-
cant for all tests after Bonferroni correction for multiple com-
parisons (.05/86). Analyses were performed using SAS v9.4
(SAS Institute Inc).

more than $544 million for cumulative value of ownership in-
terests, and $75 million for research payments (Table 2).
Analyses by Payment Type: General, Ownership Interests,
Research
Of all reported payments in 2015, 68% (≈$1.8 of $2.6 billion)
of general payments were attributable to a physician recipi-
ent, with the remaining to teaching hospitals. The median
per-physician value of general payments was $201 (interquar-
tile range [IQR], $60-$782; Table 2). Analyses of value of
general payments by nature (or reason) for payment are shown
in Table 3. Although 88.7% of general payments were for
foodandbeverage,thegreatestproportion(27.3%)ofvaluewas
from royalty or license payments (≈$484 million of $1.8 bil-
lion) followed by service fees (26.6%), such as faculty lec-
tures ($472 million of $1.8 billion).
Although only 0.4% of physicians held ownership inter-
estsoverall(3302of933 295totalphysicians),22.8%ofthetotal
value of all payments to physicians was attributable to the cu-
mulative value of ownership interests ($544 million of $2.4 bil-
lion; Table 2). Of all reported payments in 2015, 2% ($75 million
of$3.89billion)ofresearchpaymentswereattributabletoaphy-
sician recipient, with the remaining to teaching hospitals.
Analyses by Specialty
Distribution and values of general payments, research pay-
ments,andownershipinterestsbyspecialtycategoryareshown
in Table 2. Among the 4 specialty categories, interventional-
ists were reported to receive the highest median number
(9 payments; IQR, 2-39) and value of payments per physician
(≈$324,IQR;$80-$1296;P < .001).Distributionbynatureofgen-
eralpaymentssignificantlydifferedamongspecialties(Table3),
with surgeons receiving 54.5% of their value from royalty or
license payments ($415 million of $761 million), whereas pri-
mary care physicians (41.3%), specialists (39.8%), and inter-
ventionalists(37.5%)allreceivedthegreatestproportionofpay-
ments from service fees like faculty lectures (χ2 test, P < .001).
Reportsofper-physicianvalueofgeneralpaymentsbyeach
specialty in 2015 are shown in Table 4. Of 29 443 cardiologist,
74.9% received payments, representing the highest propor-
tion within physician specialties, followed by 72.2% of 15 457
gastroenterologists. Neurosurgery and orthopedics received
thehighestmaximumreportedvaluesper-physician(≈$18mil-
lion and ≈$38 million, respectively), whereas cardiology ($862;
IQR, $226-$2749) and thoracic surgery ($860; IQR, $192-
$2780) received the highest median value per physician. Neu-
rosurgery had the highest proportion of physicians to receive
a personal total value of more than $10 000 (12.6%, 565 of
4468), ), followed by cardiology (12.1%; 2661 of 22 044), and
neurology (11.8%; 1275 of 10 794 physicians).

Surgeons held 57.2% of ownership interest value in-
vested (≈$94 million of $165 million), whereas specialists re-
ceived 41.8%, the highest proportion, of cumulative interest
value (≈$227 million of $544 million; Table 2). Unadjusted
analyses showed that surgeons were more likely to hold own-
ership interests and receive royalty or license payments com-
pared with primary care physicians (Table 7). The greatest pro-
portionoftotalnumber(49.5%)andvalue(45.9%)ofphysician
research payments went to primary care physicians (Table 2).
Analyses by Sex
The distribution of nature of general payments significantly
differed between sexes across specialties (χ2 test, P < .001),
eTable 1 in the Supplement. With all specialties combined, a
greater proportion of men (50.8%) reportedly received a gen-
eral payment than did women (42.6%; absolute difference,
8.2%; 95% CI, 8.0%-8.4%; OR, 1.39; P < .001; Table 5). Women
hadalowermeanvalueofgeneralpaymentsperphysicianthan

$3083-$4199; ratio of means, 1.81; P < .001; Table 5).
Multivariable models adjusted for specialty, sex, practice
spending region, and sole proprietor status are presented in
Table 8. The interaction between specialty and sex was sig-
nificant(P < .001);thus,sexasapredictorwasevaluatedwithin
each specialty category. Male physicians were significantly
more likely than female physicians to receive general pay-
ments (ie, male interventionalists OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.97-
2.10; P < .001; Table 8). Male physicians also reportedly re-
ceived a greater mean per-physician payment value than
female physicians within their specialty. For example, male in-
terventionalists received 14.43% greater payment value (95%
CI, 13.60-15.26; P < .001) than female interventionalists. The
mean value per physician among men was $5252 (95% CI,
$4895-$5609) vs $2141 among women (95% CI, $1515-$2768;
absolute difference, $3111; 95% CI, $2217-$4005; eTable 2 in

Compared with female physicians, male physi-
cians had a higher odds of holding ownership interests
and receiving royalty or license payments (Table 5). Af-
ter adjusting for physician characteristics, male physi-
cians were more likely than female physicians to re-
ceive reported royalty or license payments and to hold
ownership interests in every specialty category except
primary care physicians (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.94;
P = .002; (Table 8).
Discussion
According to data from the 2015 Open Payments re-
ports, 449 864 US physicians (≈48%) were reported to
have received a total of $2.4 billion in industry-related
payments, including $1.8 billion for general payments,
$544 million for cumulative ownership interests, and
$75 million for research payments. There was a higher
likelihood of receipt and higher value of reported pay-
ments to surgeons than to primary care physicians and
a higher likelihood of receipt and higher value of pay-
ments to men than to women.
The Institute of Medicine has highlighted the ten-
sionthatexistsbetween“financialrelationshipswithin-
dustry and the primary missions of medical research,
education, and practice”3. Considerable data have
shownthatfinancialconflictsofinterest,fromsmallgifts
and meals to large sums for consulting, may alter phy-
sician decision making.2,18,19 The current population-
based analysis of industry-to-physician payments in
2015 shows the far-reaching extent (more than 10 mil-
lion transactions totaling $2.4 billion) of these re-
ported financial relationships. There was considerable
variability in the number, value, and nature of physi-
cian payments among specialties and by sex within spe-
cialty groups.
Similar to previous studies,1,6 procedural spe-
cialties (surgery and interventional medicine)6 had a
higher incidence and greater values of reported indus-
try payments. Interventionalists, such as cardiologists
and gastroenterologists, received the highest median
per-physician number of reported payments in 2015
(9 payments; IQR, 2-39), suggesting frequent interac-
tions with the vast pharmaceutical and medical device
industries for cardiac20 and gastrointestinal disorders.21
Orthopedics and neurosurgery reportedly received
the highest maximum per-physician general pay-
ment values (38.4 million and 17.8 million per physi-
cian, respectively), reflecting a minority of physicians
receiving large sums.22 Surgical and interventional
specialties have strong industry ties, dependence
on devices and equipment, and perhaps a greater
influence over industry-related expenditures.20,22
Industry presence in the operating room23 allows rep-
resentatives to form relationships with proceduralists,
providing device training and income-enhancing
opportunity.24

Primary care physicians had frequent but lower re-
ported value of payments, which may reflect pharmaceutical-
sponsored lunches.2 Recent Medicare data show that the
highest proportion of total drug costs were prescribed by
family practice and internal medicine.25 Alternatively,
pediatrics received fewer industry payments. Pediatricians
often treat a relatively healthy patient population, thus have
less influence over drug expenditures. Although industry-
physician research payments were rare (98% of research pay-
ments went directly to an institution), primary care physi-
cians reportedly received the majority of research payments
bynumberandvalue,whichmaybedrivenbypharmaceutical-
based clinical trials or their ability to access and enroll study
populations.26
Nature of reported payments differed among specialties,
reflecting varying industry interactions. For example, the ma-
jority of general payment value to interventionalists, special-
ists, and primary care physicians were reported as service fees,
suchasfacultylectures.However,insurgicalspecialties,54.5%
of payment value was reported as royalty or license fees.
Surgeons were significantly more likely to have been re-
ported to receive royalty or license payments (such as a roy-
alty payment for developing a hip implant) than other physi-
cians. Surgical instruments comprise the largest single area of
the medical device market (20.4% of $4.1 billion invested),27
likely influencing the device industry’
s focus on research and
design.28 Companies rely heavily on physicians for innova-
tionthroughlicensingagreements,particularlyorthopedicand
general surgeons who hold the highest number of medical de-
vice patents.29
Although few physicians held ownership interests in
industry, surgeons gained the highest reported value in 2015
($94 million of $165 million, 57.2%). This could reflect own-
ership of ambulatory surgical centers, which have been shown
to create conflicts of interest around physician self-referral.30
Among urologists and orthopedic surgeons, ownership of am-
bulatory surgical centers is associated with greater use.30,31
Medical specialists held the highest cumulative value of own-
ership interest ($227 million of $544 million, 41.8%). The vast
majority was held by radiologists ($209 million, 92.2% of in-
terest value received by specialists), perhaps related to diag-
nostic imaging equipment.32
Overall, male physicians had a higher likelihood of en-
gaging with biomedical industry and at higher values than
females. Female physicians may have different preferences for
industry engagement33 and have been shown to exhibit dif-
ferent clinical practice patterns with more patient-centered
care.34 Industry-based marketing may target male physicians
more than female physicians, specifically by engaging with
key opinion or thought leaders to establish product credibil-
ityandpromotion.35Menweremorelikelythanwomentohave
been reported to receive royalty or license payments across
all specialties, with the greatest difference among surgeons.
Sex discrepancies in patenting show that women hold fewer
patents than men.36 Furthermore, women who obtain pat-
ents are less likely to have them commercialized or licensed
than men.37 Male physicians were also more likely than fe-
male physicians to hold ownership interests in most special-
ties. Previously, male sex has been shown to be associated with
physician ownership among general surgeons and emer-
gency physicians.38,39
Although physicians may consider themselves commit-
ted to ethical practice and professionalism, many do not rec-
ognize the subconscious bias that industry relationships have
on their decision making.40 Companies may preferentially
market to profitable specialties such as cardiologists because
these physicians influence the prescribing practices of
nonspecialists.41 However, industry also appears to target and
influence primary care physicians who accepted frequent low-
value payments. A recent study found that physicians who re-
ceived industry-sponsored meals were more likely to pre-
scribe brand-name medications, with mixed findings across
sexes.2 Some medical centers have restricted access of indus-
try representatives to physicians.40 Further studies are needed

Study Limitations
This study has several limitations. The Open Payments and
NPPESdatabasesmayhaveinaccuraciesandphysiciansmaybe
unaware of their reported payments. The CMS suggests that
allphysiciansreviewanddisputeanyincorrectdatapriortopub-
licationinOpenPayments;suchvigilancewillhelpimprovethe
accuracyofthedata.Yet,OpenPaymentsremainsthemostcom-
prehensive data for industry payments to date, and there have
been improvements in accuracy and reporting in the most re-
cent 2015 release compared with earlier years.8 Although
a minority of physicians in Open Payments did not have NPIs,
94.5% of Open Payments physicians were matched to NPPES,
the same database CMS uses to verify all Open Payments rec-
ords. It is possible that the extent of industry payments may
actually be underreported in the current study. Certain poten-
tial confounding variables were unavailable in NPPES includ-
ingage,careerduration,orrace/ethnicity.Specialtywasgrouped
to facilitate multivariable analyses, classifying physicians by
nature of practice because certain practice types have differ-
ent relationships with industry. The direct association of pay-
ment receipt and drug or device use was not analyzed in this
study and should be an area of active investigation. Although
specialty categories were not completely homogeneous, they
enabled the analysis of sex-specific differences, which to our
knowledge has not been performed in previous studies.1,7
Conclusions
According to data from 2015 Open Payments reports, 48% of
physicians were reported to have received industry-related
