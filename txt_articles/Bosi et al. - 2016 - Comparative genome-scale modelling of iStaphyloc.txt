Staphylococcus aureus is a preeminent bacterial pathogen capable
of colonizing diverse ecological niches within its human host. We
describe here the pangenome of S. aureus based on analysis of
genome sequences from 64 strains of S. aureus spanning a range of
ecological niches, host types, and antibiotic resistance profiles. Based
on this set, S. aureus is expected to have an open pangenome com-
posed of 7,411 genes and a core genome composed of 1,441 genes.
Metabolism was highly conserved in this core genome; however,
differences were identified in amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis
pathways between the strains. Genome-scale models (GEMs) of me-
tabolism were constructed for the 64 strains of S. aureus. These GEMs
enabled a systems approach to characterizing the core metabolic
and panmetabolic capabilities of the S. aureus species. All models
were predicted to be auxotrophic for the vitamins niacin (vitamin
B3) and thiamin (vitamin B1), whereas strain-specific auxotrophies
were predicted for riboflavin (vitamin B2), guanosine, leucine, methi-
onine, and cysteine, among others. GEMs were used to systematically
analyze growth capabilities in more than 300 different growth-sup-
porting environments. The results identified metabolic capabilities
linked to pathogenic traits and virulence acquisitions. Such traits
can be used to differentiate strains responsible for mild vs. severe
infections and preference for hosts (e.g., animals vs. humans).
Genome-scale analysis of multiple strains of a species can thus be
used to identify metabolic determinants of virulence and increase
our understanding of why certain strains of this deadly pathogen
have spread rapidly throughout the world.

he preeminent gram-positive bacterial pathogen, Staphylo-
coccus aureus, is capable of colonizing diverse ecological
niches within its human host, including the respiratory tract, skin,
and nasal passages. As a species it possesses several immune re-
sistance and evasion factors, toxins, and invasiveness mechanisms.
As a result, S. aureus is a leading cause of skin and soft tissue in-
fections, pneumonia, sepsis, and endocarditis. In recent years,
clinical management of this leading pathogen has been complicated
by its continuous acquisition of resistance to front-line antibiotics
(1). Despite this deadly status, broad diversity exists among strains
within this species. Some strains are present as asymptomatic col-
onizers of the human nose (2), others cause skin and soft tissue
infections, and some can cause life-threatening and severe disease
(3). One strain, known as USA300, has replaced other strains of
S. aureus to become the predominant cause of methicillin-resistant
S. aureus (MRSA) infections in the United States (4), and its
prevalence is increasing rapidly worldwide (5). Thus, it is important
to understand the genetic factors that allow some strains to spread
aggressively, whereas others exist asymptomatically.
The epidemiology of S. aureus and phenotypic diversity present in
different strains is reflected in their genotypes. Therefore, it may be
possible to analyze multiple S. aureus genomes to discover factors
that could be predictors of disease phenotypes and virulence ca-
pabilities. Unfortunately, classical genotyping methodologies used
today in the clinic such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
and multilocus sequence tags (MLST) rely on the evaluation of
highly conserved housekeeping genes representative of the vertical
gene pool that do not provide sufficient resolution for prediction of
disease phenotypes (6). Due to the revolution in DNA sequencing
technologies, hundreds of full S. aureus genome sequences are now
available and can be analyzed using new methods. One such
method is the analysis of shared and unique genes, within a species,
termed the “pangenome.” A bacterial species can be effectively
described by its pangenome (7), which can be divided into the core
genome (genes shared by genomes of all strains in the species and
that are likely to encode functions related to basic cellular biology)
and the dispensable genome [genes present in some, but not all, of
the representatives of a species (8)]. The dispensable genome in-
cludes functions that confer specific advantages under particular
environmental conditions, such as adaptation to distinct niches,
antibiotic resistance, and the ability to colonize new hosts.
Despite many studies focusing on S. aureus genomics, molecular
epidemiology, and mechanisms of drug resistance and cytotoxicity,
there are relatively few studies that examine S. aureus basic bio-
chemistry and metabolic function on a genome scale. Metabolic
Significance
Comparative analysis of multiple strains within a species is a
powerful way to uncover pathoadaptive genetic acquisitions.
Hundreds of genome sequences are now available for the human
pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, mostly known for its antibiotic-
resistant variants that threaten the emergence of panresistant
superbugs. In this study, genome-scale models of metabolism are
used to analyze the shared and unique metabolic capabilities of
this pathogen and its strain-specific variants. The models are used
to distinguish S. aureus strains responsible for severe infections
based solely on growth capabilities and presence of different
virulence factors. The results identify metabolic similarities and
differences between S. aureus strains that provide insights into
the epidemiology of S. aureus and may help to combat its spread.

 network reconstructions have proven to be powerful tools to probe
the genetic diversity of metabolism between organisms (9) and
among strains within a species (10, 11). As useful as genome
annotation is, it does not provide an understanding of the in-
tegrated function of gene products to produce phenotypic states.
Becker et al. provided a well-curated genome-scale model of
S. aureus N315 (named iSB619) that represented the first bio-
chemically, genomically, and genetically structured knowledge
base for S. aureus metabolism, and several updates of the model
for this strain have followed (12–14). However, knowledge from
one strain is never sufficient to represent an entire species.
Currently, there are 48 complete genome sequences available for
S. aureus strains in the National Center for Biotechnology In-
formation (NCBI) Genome database (15) with an additional 450
draft sequences for comparison, which provide comprehensive
insight into the pangenome of the S. aureus species. In this study
we set out to construct the pangenome of the S. aureus species
and to build GEMs of strains that represent the breadth of ge-
netic, phenotypic, and pathogenic characteristics within this
species. Together, the genomic sequences and the GEMs provide
two different and complementary ways to explore diversity within
the S. aureus species and to compare core genomic vs. pangenomic
functionality and metabolic capabilities. Our integration of genomic
and biochemical data illustrates the dynamic evolution of S. aureus
strains, and the results provide insights into the metabolic deter-
minants of pathogenicity.
Results
Characteristics of the S. aureus Core Genome and Pangenome. A
set of publicly available S. aureus genome sequences was down-
loaded from the NCBI including 48 completely assembled genomes
(16). From this set, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the
concatenated sequence of seven conserved housekeeping genes
(arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tpi, and yqiL) commonly used to define
clonal complexes in clinical studies of S. aureus using the MLST
approach (Fig. 1A). The most distantly related strain was the
Australian S. aureus isolate MSHR1132 belonging to the clonal
complex 75 lineage (17). Next, a representative set of 64 S. aureus

 strains (Dataset S1) were filtered from this larger dataset based on
four criteria: (i) drug resistance [MRSA, methicillin-sensitive
S. aureus (MSSA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), and
vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA)] (Fig. 1B), (ii) host
specificity (human vs. animal) (Fig. 1C), and (iii) epidemiological
source [community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA), healthcare-
acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA), and livestock-associated MRSA
(LA-MRSA)] (Fig. 1D). Thus, the topology of the tree coupled
with
clinical
and
epidemiological
phenotypic
information
allowed for development of a heterogeneous dataset spanning
representative strains of the S. aureus species.
We used these 64 strains to construct the S. aureus pangenome
that can be used to describe this bacterial species. The pan-
genome is divided into three sections: (i) the core genome (the
set of genes shared by virtually all strains in a species), (ii) the
accessory genome (the set of genes present in some, but not all,
representatives of a species), and (iii) the unique genome (genes
unique to individual members of the species). Because the
pangenome is made up of thousands of genes, it offers a much
higher resolution for strain typing compared with genotyping
techniques such as MLST (18).
The 64 S. aureus strains examined yielded a pangenome size of
7,457 genes. Based on this dataset, the core genome is composed
of 1,441 genes, the accessory genome is composed of 2,871
genes, and the unique genome is composed of 3,145 genes (Fig.
2A). Functional annotation of genes in the pangenome per-
formed using the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) data-
base (19) revealed a unique distribution of functional categories
among the three different pangenome sets. When genes were
classified into metabolic and nonmetabolic, the largest fraction
of the core genome consisted of genes with metabolic functions
(58%). These included those involved in central metabolism in-
cluding glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate path-
way, and TCA cycle. A much lower fraction of metabolic gene
content is observed in the accessory and unique genome (33% and
18%, respectively).
The size of the pangenome and its increase in size upon ad-
dition of new strains can be used to predict the future rate of
discovery of novel genes in a species. We used a sampling ap-
proach to obtain a set of randomly permuted S. aureus pan-
genomes (with specific breakdowns of total genes, shared genes,
and new genes). By fitting a double exponential decay function to

S. aureus pangenome statistics. (A) The S. aureus pangenome can be subdivided into three categories: (i) the core genome (the set of genes shared by
all genomes), (ii) the accessory genome (the set of genes present in some but not all genomes), and (iii) the unique genome (genes that are unique to a single
genome). The function of each gene in a group is classified using COGs. COG categories are as follows: For cellular processes and signaling, D is cell cycle
control, cell division, and chromosome partitioning; M is cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis; N is cell motility; O is posttranslational modification,
protein turnover, and chaperones; T is signal transduction mechanisms; U is intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport; V is defense mech-
anisms; W is extracellular structures; Y is nuclear structure; and Z is cytoskeleton. For information storage and processing, A is RNA processing and modifi-
cation; B is chromatin structure and dynamics; J is translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis; K is transcription; and L is replication, recombination, and
repair. For metabolism, C is energy production and conversion; E is amino acid transport and metabolism; F is nucleotide transport and metabolism; G is
carbohydrate transport and metabolism; H is coenzyme transport and metabolism; I is lipid transport and metabolism; P is inorganic ion transport and
metabolism; and Q is secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism. (B) Distribution of the genes in the pangenome for each examined

 the number of shared genes, we estimated the S. aureus core
genome to have 1,425 genes (Fig. 3). Discovery of new genes and
count of total genes were used to obtain fits to the Heap’s law
function, resulting in γ values of −0.58 and 0.31, respectively.
The γ parameter determines the behavior of the curve. For γ
values >0, the function has no asymptote, indicating that the
S. aureus pangenome repertoire is likely to grow indefinitely as
more strains are sequenced.
Size and Content of the Core Genome Provide Insight into Essential
S. aureus Capabilities. The average S. aureus genome encodes 2,800
genes; therefore, the size of the core genome represents a high
portion (56%, on average) of each S. aureus genome (Fig. 2B).
This portion is particularly high compared with other organisms
including Clostridium difficile (core represents 25% of the aver-
age genome) (20) and Escherichia coli (core represents 40% of
the average genome) (21). The fact that each S. aureus strain has
such a high portion of shared genes can be interpreted as a direct
consequence of the proposed clonal structure for the species
(22). The majority of the 1,441 core genes (shared by all 64
S. aureus strains examined) are involved in housekeeping pro-
cesses. These include nonmetabolic functions such as transcrip-
tion (15%), translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (14%),
and RNA processing and modification (7%). A core set of
239 genes functionally annotated to be involved in transcription
and translation was found in all S. aureus strains examined
(Fig. S1). A detailed discussion of these genes is provided in SI
Text. Of these 239 conserved genes, 94 and 87 are known to be
experimentally essential on LB media in E. coli (23) and Bacillus
subtilis (24), respectively. Therefore, inhibitors of these proteins
may be good targets for antibiotic therapies against S. aureus. Genes
involved in metabolic functions were also highly conserved. Such
functions included amino acid transport and metabolism (11%),
carbohydrate transport and metabolism (7%), coenzyme transport
and metabolism (4%), cell wall and membrane biosynthesis (5%),
and energy production and conversion (12%). Genome-scale net-
work reconstructions for each of the 64 strains were built to perform
an integrated analysis of the function of these metabolic genes (see
below). Together, genes involved in metabolic, transcription, and
translation processes make up 75% of the S. aureus core genome.
Relative to the core genome, widely different functional as-
signments are present for those genes in the accessory and
unique genomes. The accessory genome has a large portion of
genes associated with mobile genetic elements such as transpo-
sons and bacteriophages [replication, recombination, and repair
(24%)] or those with nonmetabolic functions including defense
mechanisms (5%). Metabolic functions were also included in the
accessory genome, including those related to amino acid me-
tabolism (8%), inorganic ion transport (7%), and carbohydrate
metabolism (6%). The unique genome is heavily enriched in
genes related to mobile elements (62%), with the other cate-
gories being poorly represented. This high proportion of mobile
elements in the unique genome is similar to other organisms,
including E. coli, and indicates that horizontal gene transfer
(HGT) has had a large effect on S. aureus evolution (25–27).
Indeed, the archaic MRSA clone, thought to be the ancestor
strain of MRSA in Europe, obtained its methicillin resistance
because of the horizontal transfer of the mecA gene from an
unknown source (1). Even strains in the same household have
been shown to engage in HGT with other Staphylococcus species
(28). Thus, analysis of all HGT events in different strains of
S. aureus and their putative source can shed light on the evo-
lution of this species (see SI Text for analysis of atypical genes
and their putative transfer source).

Pangenome, core, and novel genes of the 64 analyzed S. aureus strains. Pangenome features are as follows: The purple squares denote the number of
novel genes discovered with the sequential addition of new genomes. The yellow dots denote the values of the core genes as genomes are added to the
pangenome. The purple bars indicate the number of new genes added to the total pangenome size as new genomes are added. Each of the values represents
the median from a distribution of randomly selected genomes at each genome addition. The purple line represents the number of new genes found for each
genome addition. For comparison, the same trend for a closed genome is reported as a dashed line. The equations below the graph show parameters for fits
to Heap’s law. Positive exponents indicate an open state and that the category is boundless so new genes are likely to be discovered continually as new
genomes are sequenced.

 Ancestral Events of Gene Loss and Acquisition Affect the Pathogenicity of
S. aureus Strains. We used the identified 1,441 core genes to produce
an S. aureus phylogeny based on a concatenated sequence of the
aligned genes. The patterns of gene presence were used with this
phylogeny based on the core genome to infer events of ancestral
gene gains and losses using a parsimony approach (29). This analysis
allowed, for each internal node of the phylogenetic tree, us to
compute (i) the number of gene gains and losses and (ii) the cor-
responding genetic repertoire. In particular, we focused on the
evolutionary events related to the virulence factors in each strain
because they have profound implications on pathogenesis of dif-
ferent S. aureus clones. The mapping of the events of gene gains and
losses revealed that S. aureus strains have undergone extensive
rearrangement of their genetic repertoire. A large number of evo-
lutionary events occurred both ancestrally and recently (Fig. S2).
For example, the ancestor of the ST228 lineage is characterized by a
massive genome reduction (522 genes lost), whereas all of the LA-
MRSA strains have recently acquired a large number of genes.
Considering that the S. aureus last common ancestor (Sa-LCA)
comprised 2,673 ortholog groups, the species has acquired a large
number of new genes (4,784) during its evolutionary history.
Known S. aureus Virulence Factors Are Unequally Distributed Between
Core and Accessory Genomes. To gain insight into the conservation of
virulence factors across the S. aureus species we curated a set of
known virulence factors (VFs) present in different strains based on
literature and database searches (30). We identified a total of 90
different VFs that were present in at least one of the 64 different
S. aureus strains. Of the 90 VFs, 35 were shared by all of the strains,
forming a core set of VFs. Nine of the conserved VFs are cap8
genes (B, C, E, F, L, M, N, O, and P), which are involved in the
synthesis of the polysaccharide capsule (PC). Other conserved VFs
included five involved in the production of two different cytotoxins,
namely, the Panton–Valentine leukocidin (PVL), encoded by the
genes lukS and lukF, and the gamma–hemolysin, encoded by hlgA,
hlgB, and hlgC. Four other conserved VFs encode iron-regulated
proteins (isdA, isdC, isdE, and isdF) that bind to extracellular matrix
components such as fibrinogen and fibronectin to promote cell
adherence. Among these, the isdA gene plays a role in the S. aureus
iron acquisition system, important for S. aureus in vivo replication
and disease pathogenesis (31). Other canonical S. aureus virulence
factors were highly conserved but were not found across all 64
strains. Protein A (binds immunoglobin G to disrupt phagocytosis,
encoded for by spa) was found in 90% of strains. Alpha toxin
(disrupts the membrane and enhances invasiveness, encoded for by
hla) was found in 96% of strains. Biosynthesis genes for the
staphyloxanthin pigment (encoded for by crtMNPQ) were found in
all but one of the strains. This strain (MSHR1132) was specifically
sequenced because of its lack of the yellow pigment (17).
Several other VFs were strain-specific. For example, the
Staphylococcal complement inhibitor (SCIN) protein (encoded by
scn) was present in 48 of the 64 strains, and Chemotaxis inhibitory
protein of staphylococci (CHIPS, encoded by chp) was present in
27 of the 64 strains. The AGR quorum sensing system (regulates
biofilm development, encoded for by agrABCD) was found in 25%
of strains. Meanwhile, the exfoliative toxin B was found only in a
single strain (S. aureus 11819-97). S. aureus MW2 was found to have
the highest count of established virulence factors (79 VFs) followed
by MSSA476 (74 VFs), Mu3, and Mu50 (70 VFs). In contrast, the
ST288 strains had the fewest number of VFs (53 total).
Metabolic Models Facilitate Investigation into Genetic Basis of Strain-
Specific Growth Capabilities. Because so much of the S. aureus core
genome is dedicated to metabolic functions, the 64 S. aureus ge-
nome sequences were used to construct strain-specific genome-scale
metabolic reconstructions (Dataset S2) that were used to compare
gene, reaction, and metabolite content between the strains. Each
reconstruction serves as a comprehensive representation of the
metabolic capabilities of an S. aureus strain. Content shared among
all reconstructions defines the core metabolic capabilities of the
S. aureus species. Similarly, the metabolic capabilities of all strains
were combined to define the full potential of metabolic capabilities
for the S. aureus species, or its panmetabolic network (Fig. 4A) (10).
The core metabolic network contained 700 metabolic genes that
catalyze 1,222 reactions involving 1,257 metabolites. Highly con-
served metabolic subsystems across all S. aureus models include
lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, glycan biosynthesis, and me-
tabolism of polyketides and terpenoids. Reactions involved in these
metabolic subsystems were highly represented (>95% conserved) in
the core metabolic network. By contrast, only 80% of amino acid
biosynthesis reactions were part of the core metabolic network.
Conserved amino acid biosynthesis pathways included those for
valine, alanine, and serine biosynthesis. The core metabolic network
also contained known metabolic virulence determinants including
catalase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes hydrogen peroxide into water
and oxygen and that is used in the clinical laboratory to distinguish
staphylococci from enterococci and streptococci. Catalase pro-
duction and oxidant resistance have been shown to be predisposing
factors for nasal colonization and subsequent infection (32).
The panmetabolic reactions are composed of the union of dif-
ferent metabolic reactions found in all strains and thus indicate the
pool of metabolic capabilities within a species. The S. aureus pan-
metabolic network contains 1,090 metabolic genes, 1,592 reactions,
and 1,519 metabolites. About 45% of reactions in carbohydrate
metabolism were not present in the core metabolic network. Thus,
these reactions were not shared by all strains of S. aureus examined.
These formed the largest group of reactions present in the set dif-
ference between the core metabolic and panmetabolic networks
(Fig. 4B). A majority of these reactions are involved in alternate
carbon metabolism, including catabolic pathways for unique niche-
specific nutrients. Amino acid metabolism was also disproportion-
ately present in the panmetabolic network including biosynthesis
pathways for leucine, arginine, and histidine metabolism, in-
dicating that these capabilities may have been lost by several
strains of S. aureus.

 The conversion of metabolic network reconstructions into com-
putable mathematical models enables computation of phenotypes
in diverse nutrient environments based on the content of each re-
construction. Thus, the 64 S. aureus strain-specific reconstructed
networks were converted into genome-scale metabolic models
(GEMs) that were used to compute phenotypes in more than 300
unique, growth-supporting environmental conditions. A detailed
biomass composition was defined (Table S1) and used to identify
the distribution of metabolic fluxes leading to optimal growth. Re-
actions belonging to the amino acid metabolism subsystem made up
the majority of reactions in set difference between the core reac-
tomes and panreactomes (Fig. 4B). Thus, we hypothesized that
functional differences in amino acid biosynthesis capabilities of
different strains of S. aureus may allow different strains to adapt
to different nutritional environments. To test this hypothesis, we
simulated growth in silico for all 64 S. aureus GEMs on a variety
of minimal media growth conditions, including a minimal growth
media reported for S. aureus N315 (12). The in silico growth
analysis revealed that all 64 models growing in glucose minimal
media require at least vitamins B1 (thiamin) and B3 (niacin) to
be added to the media. Some of the strains required more
components to be added to the minimal media beyond just these
(Table 1). The thiamin auxotrophy is due to a lack of the pathway
that converts tyrosine to thiamin via tyrosine lyase and thiazole
phosphate synthase. The niacin auxotrophy is due to a lack of
nicotinate-nucleotide diphosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.19). These
auxotrophies have been experimentally documented for S. aureus
in the past (33).
There were also several additional strain-specific auxotrophies
with 90% of the models (55/64) unable to grow in the in silico
glucose minimal media containing thiamin and niacin (Table S2).
These models lacked the ability to synthesize additional com-
pounds including the nucleotide guanine and the vitamin ribo-
flavin as well as the amino acids leucine, arginine, histidine,
tryptophan, phenylalanine, methionine, proline, and tyrosine
(Table 1). Previous work has demonstrated that some strains of
S. aureus are able to grow in minimal media devoid of amino
acids after a long period of training or weaning away from amino
acid addition (33, 34). We experimentally confirmed that four
strains (USA300, N315, 8325, and Mu50) could grow in minimal
media supplemented with proline, serine leucine, threonine,
thiamin, and niacin (Fig. S3). S. aureus is known to have a
complicated gene regulatory structure that may inhibit its growth
on minimal media, despite the presence of biosynthetic pathways
for these metabolites (12, 14). Longer-term growth or training in
the laboratory for these strains may allow for eventual growth in
the minimal medium defined here (35).
S. aureus Strains Can Be Differentiated Using GEM-Predicted Metabolic
Capabilities and Presence of Virulence Factors. The 64 S. aureus GEMs
were used to predict growth capabilities on alternative carbon, ni-
trogen, phosphorous, and sulfur sources by removing glucose, am-
monia, sulfate, and phosphate from the in silico growth media and
adding alternative sources one at a time. Over 300 alternative nu-
trient sources were tested in aerobic and anaerobic conditions using
flux balance analysis (FBA) (36) to assess whether each S. aureus
strain grew in silico (Fig. 5A). Overall, 238 nutrients were universally
catabolized by all strains including glucose and glycerol as carbon
sources and arginine as a nitrogen source. Other nutrients were
strain-specific, including dulcose (42 strains) and inosine (13 strains)
as carbon sources and uracil and thymidine as nitrogen sources (42
strains each). We specifically looked to see if the models were
predicted to be able to use arginine for growth. The arginine mobile
catabolic element (ACME) is present in MRSA USA300 strains
and has been shown to be a key element for its successful coloni-
zation (37). We, however, found that the arginine catabolic capa-
bility was conserved across all S. aureus models due to the presence
of a separate arc operon (encoded for by arcA-arcD) present in all
strains. This finding is consistent with previous work (38). Despite
this similarity, several other growth capabilities could be used to
distinguish groups of strains (Fig. 5). For example, simulation results
showed that the two S. aureus USA300 isolates were the only strains
capable of using spermidine as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen
due to the presence of spermidine acetyltransferase (encoded for
by speG). Spermidine is produced at high levels in areas of ker-
atinocyte proliferation, inflammation, and wound healing (39),
conditions under which S. aureus invades and causes skin in-
fection. We experimentally confirmed that only S. aureus
USA300 could grow in TSB media supplemented with 6 mM of
spermidine, whereas S. aureus strains Newman and NCTC8325
could not (Fig. S4).
Another example of using model predictions to distinguish strains
was made possible by combining the simulated growth results with
presence/absence of virulence factors in each strain. This combi-
nation allowed the formation of a classification schema that could
be used to differentiate strains with a lifestyle that is livestock as-
sociated (LA) compared with those that were human associated
(HA). The classifier was capable of distinguishing strains with these
two host preferences based on evaluation of only three factors:
presence of staphylokinase precursor (sak), the ability to catabolize
maltotriose (mlttr), and presence of IgG binding protein A pre-
cursor (sak) (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, 100% of the sak positive strains
were human-associated. We also observed that although many of
the strains from the same clonal complexes clustered near each
other, some important differences arose. For example, strains from
the ST228 lineage appear to have lost several metabolic capabilities
relative to others, causing two separate groups from this clonal
complex to cluster apart from each other. Therefore, GEM-pre-
dicted metabolic capabilities and presence of virulence factors can
be used to classify strains of S. aureus based on lifestyle and pre-
ferred niche. Thus, the tools presented here are capable of offering
more precise classification schemes than those used routinely in the
clinic to type S. aureus strains today.
Discussion
The pangenome of S. aureus was assembled and applied to
highlight the genetic, metabolic, and pathogenic diversity of the
species. A particular emphasis was placed on the analysis of strain-
specific metabolic capabilities and the distribution of virulence
factors. Based on the content of the pangenome, GEMs of me-
tabolism were reconstructed and deployed for 64 S. aureus strains to
determine their functional differences by computing minimal media
compositions and growth capabilities across more than 300 nutrient
sources both aerobically and anaerobically. All strains were pre-
dicted to be auxotrophic for niacin and thiamin, whereas strain-
specific auxotrophies were predicted for riboflavin, guanine, and

 leucine among others (Table 1). Model-predicted growth capabil-
ities and identification of virulence factors allowed for the creation
of classification schemas that could distinguish groups of strains
based on relatively few traits. The results presented here demon-
strate that comparisons of GEM-predicted metabolic capabilities
among different strains in a species can be used to identify strain-
specific biomarkers and to uncover and elucidate metabolic deter-
minants of virulence.
Identification and characterization of the makeup of a species’
pangenome is a powerful tool to analyze genomic diversity within a
taxon. The S. aureus pangenome described here is composed of
7,457 unique genes. Of these, 1,441 genes are shared among all
strains in the species, forming a core genome. Functional assign-
ment of the core genes revealed that they are mostly associated with
housekeeping functions (i.e., control of gene expression machinery
and basic biochemistry). On average, 56% of genes in the average
S. aureus genome are part of the core genome. This confirms pre-
vious observations that S. aureus is a clonal species (22). Recent
studies have shown that even mutations in the core genome of
closely related S. aureus isolates can have significant effects on
virulence, proliferation, and persistence of S. aureus strains (6).
Therefore, a deeper analysis of strain-specific genetic variants in this
set could offer further insights into S. aureus pathogenicity.
The 1,441 core genes were aligned to produce a reliable phy-
logeny compared with those derived from a limited number of
genes (Fig. S2). In general, the phylogeny is consistent with in-
formation from literature including agreement between strains’
ST and clade. However, some exceptions were observed: (i) the
ST5 group is included within a paraphyletic clade corresponding
to CC5 and (ii) S. aureus COL (ST250) is placed in the ST8
clade. Although these exceptions are consistent with the evolu-
tionary history of S. aureus [i.e., the paraphyletic clade includes
members of the same clonal complex and ST8 is the predicted
ancestor of ST250 (40)], the differences between MLST geno-
typing and the presented phylogeny underline the limitations of
molecular typing techniques to differentiate between closely re-
lated strains. Furthermore, in regards to host specificity, the
distribution of the LA-MRSA strains along the tree indicates that
they have originated through different independent events. In
particular, we identified a monophyletic clade of ST398 strains, a
clade of strains from different lineages (ST425, ST133, and
ST151), and two strains included in different human-associated
clades (corresponding to ST5 and ST1).
In contrast to the core genome, the size of the pangenome was
used to predict, via extrapolation, the number of genome se-
quences required for bounding the gene repertoire of a clade.
Our regression analysis shows that the S. aureus pangenome is
open, indicating that the gene repertoire of this species is theo-
retically boundless. This result is in agreement with a previous
DNA microarray experiment involving 36 S. aureus strains (41),
in which extensive genetic variability was reported. A high por-
tion of unique genes were found to be related to mobile genetic
elements (i.e., transposon, phages, and plasmids), which may
drive acquisition of novel functional modules via HGT, including
drug resistance and virulence (42). Beyond these evolutionary in-
sights, the pangenome has important practical implications. The
presence/absence of genes from the dispensable genome (i.e., genes
unique to some strains) represents a high-resolution alternative to
MLST that we have used to diagnose distinct groups of pathogenic
bacteria based on specific biomarkers.
We specifically examined the presence of virulence factors
in the core genomes and pangenomes. Overall, most of the
S. aureus virulome is conserved across the 64 strains examined.
There is only one VF unique to a single strain (i.e., the etb gene,
encoding the exfoliative toxin B), whereas 54 VFs were shared by a
small number of strains but were not present in all strains. Some
virulence factors are redundantly present across the species to
overcome herd immunity. For example, several enterotoxins are

S. aureus virulence factors and predicted metabolic capabilities. (A) Presence and absence of virulence factors and predicted metabolic capabilities
across the 64 S. aureus strains examined in this study. Metabolic capabilities were predicted using the strain-specific metabolic models (dark purple, growth
capability; light purple, nutrient required; yellow, no growth or nutrient is not required). The virulome consists of curated virulence factors known to be
present in different strains of S. aureus. Orange indicates a factor is present, and yellow indicates a factor is absent. Full matrix with strains, predicted growth
capabilities, and virulence factor is available in Dataset S1. Virulence factor and growth profiles can be used to classify strains. For example in B, a classification
is constructed that separates human-associated S. aureus strains from livestock-associated strains using only the presence of two virulence factors and the
ability to catabolize maltotriose. Abbreviations are as follows: staphylokinase precursor (sak), maltotriose (malttr), and IgG binding protein A precursor (spa).

 found as unique variants in different strains to avoid detection by
a dynamic host immune system. The vast majority of the virulome is
composed of core and pseudocore (shared by most of the strains)
genes. The presence of these genes is interesting from an evolu-
tionary point of view because it implies that S. aureus has evolved a
highly conserved system to carry out its infectious cycle. From an
applied viewpoint, these genes may represent targets for virulence
inhibitor or antibody-based therapeutic strategies (43).
To gain insights into the metabolic diversity between S. aureus
strains, we produced 64 strain-specific GEMs and used them to
simulate growth capabilities in different nutrient sources. Ex-
perimental verification of minimal growth-supporting media was
partially confirmed. It is conceivable that certain infectious
niches may activate latent biosynthetic pathways under the ap-
propriate conditions, and the fact that genes in these pathways
have not developed into pseudogenes indicates that they may
have relevance in niche adaptation (44).
A clustering analysis based on computed metabolic phenotypes
distinguished groups of strains from each other. One distinction
that arose was the identification of USA300 isolate as the only
strain with a capability to catabolize spermidine due to the
presence of speG encoded spermidine acetlytransferase. In hu-
mans, spermidine is known to potentiate keratinocyte killing of
S. aureus in conjunction with antimicrobial peptides (45) and
several classes of antibiotics, especially β-lactams (46). Recently,
studies have found regions of ACME (including the arginine
catabolic arc region) in many different, non-USA300 strains (47,
48). However, the association of the speG locus with ACME is
uncommon outside of USA300. Therefore, acquisition of speG has
likely been helpful in the rapid spread of USA300 strains. The speG
gene was horizontally transferred from S. epidermis, a commensal
colonizer of human skin (49). Therefore, a future comparison
of shared metabolic capabilities between S. aureus strains and
S. epidermis might provide further insights. Furthermore, design of
antibiotics that specifically interfere with strain-specific capabilities
such as those identified here offer new ways to inhibit epidemio-
logical spread of particularly infectious strains.
The GEMs presented here open the S. aureus species to a wide
array of systems biology methods and techniques (50). For example,
using these models, it is straightforward to predict essential genes in
different conditions (we found an average of 190 essential genes for
the 64 strains in LB media; Dataset S1). Furthermore, single gene
essentiality screens have been extended to the study of synthetic
lethality and discovery of synergistic antibiotics (51). In conclusion,
the multiscale comparative approach used in this work provides
insights into the diversity of the S. aureus species. Historical meth-
ods for classification of S. aureus strains have developed consider-
ably from phage-typing to PFGE and MLST approaches (52). New
high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies and analysis tech-
niques will continue to improve our ability to track and distinguish
pathogens. Computational analysis of GEMs built for multiple
strains in a species provides a powerful tool that can be deployed to
provide insights into metabolic determinants of virulence, to identify
novel biomarkers capable of distinguishing certain strains from one
another, and to discover new pharmacological targets.
Materials and Methods
Tools and methods used to identify and construct the core genome and
pangenome of S. aureus as well as the analysis of atypical genes are presented in
SI Materials and Methods. Briefly, InParanoid (53) was used to identify orthol-
ogous genes to construct a pangenome. The strain-specific model reconstruction
procedure was performed with Simpheny (Genomatica, Inc.), and gap-filling
algorithms and in silico growth simulation conditions were implemented in
Constraints-Based Reconstruction and Analysis Toolbox for Python (COBRApy)
(54) and are described in SI Materials and Methods. Heat map, phylogenetic tree,
and decision tree construction are described in SI Materials and Methods. S.
aureus strains NCTC8325, Newman, N315, Mu50, and USA300 were used for
carbon source and growth testing. All experimental protocols are described in SI
Materials and Methods.
