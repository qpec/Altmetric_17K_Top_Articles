Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma represents the second most common cutaneous
malignancy, affecting 7–11% of Caucasians in the United States. The genetic determinants of
susceptibility to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma remain largely unknown. Here we report
the results of a two-stage genome-wide association study of cutaneous squamous cell
carcinoma, totalling 7,404 cases and 292,076 controls. Eleven loci reached genome-wide
significance (Po5 � 10 � 8) including seven previously confirmed pigmentation-related loci:
MC1R, ASIP, TYR, SLC45A2, OCA2, IRF4 and BNC2. We identify an additional four susceptibility
loci: 11q23.3 CADM1, a metastasis suppressor gene involved in modifying tumour interaction
with cell-mediated immunity; 2p22.3; 7p21.1 AHR, the dioxin receptor involved in anti-
apoptotic pathways and melanoma progression; and 9q34.3 SEC16A, a putative oncogene
with roles in secretion and cellular proliferation. These susceptibility loci provide deeper
insight into the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma.

 S
quamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin represents the
second most common cutaneous malignancy, behind only
basal cell carcinoma (BCC), with a lifetime incidence of 7–
11% in Caucasians in the United States, creating a substantial
economic and health burden. In addition, an estimated 6,000
deaths are attributed to SCC annually in the United States1.
Fair skin, male gender, ultraviolet radiation exposure and prior
organ transplant are associated with increased rates of SCC.
In contrast to BCC, few genetic variants have thus far been
linked to SCC risk. A recent genome-wide association study
(GWAS) from patients within the Kaiser Permanente Healthcare
System identified ten SCC susceptibility loci, including six
pigmentation
loci:
SLC45A2,
IRF4,
TYR,
HERC2,
DEF8
(16q24, the same locus as MC1R) and RALY2,3. Here we report
a two-stage genome-wide association meta-analysis for SCC,
with a total of 7,404 SCC cases and 292,076 controls from the
23andMe research participant cohort and the Nurses’ Health
Study/Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS). Our results
provide independent replication for nine of the ten loci from the
Kaiser Permanente GWAS and identify four additional novel
susceptibility loci for SCC.
Results
Genome-wide association study. Stage 1 consisted of a GWAS
set encompassing 6,579 self-reported SCC cases and 280,558
controls of European ancestry from the 23andMe research
participant cohort (Table 1). A validation study of the 23andMe
self-reported data was conducted, which revealed a sensitivity and
specificity of 92% and 98%, respectively (Supplementary Table 1).
In stage 1, the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) at each locus associated with SCC (Po10 � 5) was
identified, yielding a list of 14 index SNPs (Fig. 1). Stage 2
consisted of an independent GWAS set of 825 adjudicated SCC
cases and 11,518 controls of European ancestry from the Nurses’
Health Study and HPFS (Table 1) to confirm the index SNPs
identified in stage 1. Subsequently, meta-analysis of stage 1 and
stage 2 was performed, encompassing 7,404 SCC cases and
292,076 controls, and identified a total of 11 SNPs reaching
genome-wide
significance
(Table
2,
Po5 � 10 � 8,
logistic
regression). Out of the 11 genome-wide significant SNPs, 9 were
associated with an increased SCC risk relative to the minor allele,
whereas 2 (SLC45A2 rs35407 and BNC2 rs10810657) were pro-
tective (Table 2). QQ plots, forest plots and misclassification
analysis are provided in Supplementary Figs 1–8.
Confirmation of previously reported loci. Among the 11
genome-wide significant loci identified in this two-stage study
(Table 2), 7 were previously reported in the Kaiser GWAS
but had not yet been replicated in an external cohort (Table 3,
Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 9). Of the
seven previously reported loci, six are pigmentation related,
whereas the seventh, 9p22.2 BNC2, is a putative pigmentation
locus3. In addition to replicating these seven loci at genome-wide
significance, our study replicated two additional loci from the
Kaiser
GWAS,
3p13
FOXP1
and
3q28
TPRG1/TP63
(P ¼ 4.4 � 10 � 3 and P ¼ 1.3 � 10 � 2, respectively, by logistic
regression) (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 2).
Genome-wide significant novel susceptibility loci. Our study
also identified four novel SCC susceptibility loci (Table 2,
Supplementary
Table
3
and
Supplementary
Fig.
10)
not
previously reported. These four novel susceptibility loci—2p22.3,
7p21.1
(AHR),
9q34.3
(SEC16A)
and
11q23.3
(CADM1-
BUD13)—have not been previously associated with pigmentation
phenotypes.
Of
these
four
loci,
one
(SEC16A)
reached
genome-wide significance in stage 1, whereas the other three
did so in the combined meta-analysis. Although some loci
did not reach statistical significance in stage 2, their 95%
confidence intervals (for odds ratios (ORs)) overlapped with
corresponding stage 1 confidence intervals. The power to reach
Po0.05 in stage 2 for all 14 index SNPs is detailed in
Supplementary Table 4.

 Heritability of SCC. To measure the proportion of SCC
heritability that can be attributed to these SNPs, we calculated
the familial relative risk for SCC as outlined by the Cancer
Oncological
Gene–Environment
Study.
Overall,
6.3%
of
familial relative risk for SCC is explained by these 11 loci.
Interestingly, although consistent effects for all 7 SNPs were
observed across age and gender, larger effect sizes tended to
occur in younger cases, perhaps highlighting the increasingly
important
influence
of
environmental
factors
with
age
(Supplementary Tables 5 and 6, and Supplementary Fig. 11).
Further results can be found in Supplementary Tables 7–11 and
Supplementary Fig. 12.
Discussion
Previously
reported
loci.
The
predominance
of
SCC
susceptibility loci associated with pigmentation genes confirms
the well-established heritable phenotypic risk of SCC. In
our
study,
these
SNPs
include
the
following:
rs1805007
(MC1R R151C), a red hair allele associated with photosensitivity
and increased BCC risk4,5; rs12203592, which lies within an
enhancer of IRF4 transcription in melanocytes and is associated
with increased risk of actinic keratoses (SCC precursors)
independent of skin pigmentation6–8; rs1126809 (TYR R402Q),
associated with photosensitivity, tanning and increased risk of
BCC and melanoma9; rs6059655, intergenic near RALY-ASIP

Figure 1 | Manhattan plot of stage 1 GWAS analysis of SCC. Total stage 1 GWAS analysis included 6,579 cases and 280,558 controls from the 23andMe
cohort. The y axis represents log-scaled P-values. Loci with smallest Po10 � 5 (via logistic regression), of which there are 14 in total, are labelled with the
name of the nearest gene. Positions with Po5 � 10 � 8 (genome-wide significance) are shown in red. Seven SCC susceptibility loci reached genome-wide
significance in stage 1, including six previously reported pigmentation loci at 6p25.3 (IRF4), 5p13.2 (SLC45A2), 16q24.3 (MC1R), 11q14.3 (TYR), 20q11.22
(RALY-ASIP) and 15q13.1 (OCA2), which are highlighted by asterisks. The seventh susceptibility locus reaching significance in stage 1, 9q34.3 (SEC16A), is
novel and not pigmentation related (marked by a double asterisk). Three additional novel susceptibility loci, 2p22.3, 7p21.1 (AHR) and 11q23.3
(CADM1-BUD13), reached genome-wide significance in the overall meta-analysis, as did the previously reported locus 9p22.2 (BNC2-CNTLN) (Table 2).
The remaining three loci in the figure, 3q28 (LPP), 6p21.3 (HLA-DQB1) and 8q23.3 (TRPS1), had Po10 � 5 in stage 1 but did not reach genome-wide
significance in the meta-analysis.

 and associated with facial pigmented spots10; and rs35407, in
modest linkage disequilibrium with rs16891982 (SLC45A2 F374L,
r2 ¼ 0.33, D’ ¼ 1), associated with human pigmentation and
melanoma
risk11,12.
rs16891982
reached
genome-wide
significance in stage 1 (P ¼ 8.6 � 10 � 13, OR ¼ 1.65, logistic
regression) and in the overall meta-analysis (P ¼ 1.5 � 10 � 11,
OR ¼ 1.62, logistic regression) (Supplementary Table 7). We also
performed sensitivity analysis on OCA2 rs1800407 and IRF4
rs12203592 using high imputation quality subsets and directly
genotyped data sets (Supplementary Table 8)13.
In addition to these confirmed pigmentation loci, rs10810657
at 9p22.2 reached genome-wide significance in the overall
meta-analysis (P ¼ 1.4 � 10 � 8, OR ¼ 0.90, logistic regression).
rs10810657 lies B13 kb upstream of the basonuclin 2 (BNC2)
transcription start site in a potential enhancer in foreskin
melanocytes and other cell types8. This SNP is in linkage
disequilibrium with rs12350739 (r2 ¼ 0.90, D0 ¼ 1.00), which
resides in an enhancer element regulating BNC2 transcription in
human melanocytes14. BNC2 is a DNA-binding zinc-finger
protein thought to act as both a messenger RNA-processing
enzyme and a transcription factor14. BNC2 is expressed in
melanocytes and, to a lesser extent, keratinocytes, with higher
expression levels corresponding to darker skin pigmentation in
human skin tissue analysis. Variants in the BNC2 locus
have recently been associated with skin colour, freckling and
age-related pigmentation spots in Europeans, in addition to
SCC3,10,15. The association and linkage disequilibrium results for
these SNPs are listed in Supplementary Tables 9 and 10.
Novel susceptibility loci. We also identified four novel SNPs
associated with SCC. rs57994353 at 9q34.3 (P ¼ 7.5 � 10 � 9,
OR ¼ 1.12, logistic regression) resides within an intron of
SEC16A in tight linkage disequilibrium with rs3812594 SEC16A
R1039C (r2 ¼ 0.90, D’ ¼ 1)8. SEC16A is a cytosolic scaffold
protein that acts at endoplasmic reticulum exit sites to facilitate
vesicle formation and export16. Production of this protein is
regulated by various growth factors, with higher levels of SEC16A
corresponding to increased secretion and cellular proliferation17.
Overexpression of SEC16A has been observed in colonic
adenocarcinoma samples17.
Another novel SCC risk variant, rs74899442 at 11q23.3,
reached genome-wide significance in the overall meta-analysis
(P ¼ 8.7 � 10 � 9, OR ¼ 2.13, logistic regression). This SNP lies in
an intergenic region 515 kb upstream of CADM1, which encodes
a
single-pass
transmembrane
protein
involved
in
cell–cell
adhesion
and
signal
transduction18–20.
CADM1
is
also
a
putative
tumour
suppressor
in
many
human
carcinomas,
including SCC, as it is frequently downregulated in these
tissues
via
promoter
methylation21–23.
Notably,
CADM1
expression levels are associated with survival in SCC patients.
In a study of 87 patients with SCC, those with decreased CADM1
expression had significantly shorter median survival (36 versus 54
months)23. Conversely, overexpression of CADM1 in SCC cells
suppresses cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis23. In light
of these recent findings from various studies, our results
provide further evidence that CADM1 may play a role in
SCC development.
The third and fourth novel susceptibility variants rs192481803
and rs117132860 reached genome-wide significance in the overall
meta-analysis.
rs192481803
at
2p22.23
(P ¼ 4.5 � 10 � 8,
OR ¼ 1.90, logistic regression) lies within a long non-coding
RNA
AC012593.1
of
unknown
function8.
rs117132860
(P ¼ 3.6 � 10 � 8,
OR ¼ 1.48,
logistic
regression),
located
at
7p21.1, is situated within a DNAse hypersensitivity site 203 kb
upstream of AHR, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and has
predicted
enhancer
activity
in
multiple
tissues
including
keratinocytes. AHR is a widely expressed transcription factor
that is involved in drug metabolism and cellular proliferation,
although its exact role is tissue dependent and oftentimes
paradoxical24–26. Interestingly, in the context of keratinocytes,
ultraviolet radiation activates AHR and triggers a molecular
cascade (known as the AHR-E2F1-CHK1 axis) that ultimately
inhibits apoptosis24. This inhibition allows ultraviolet-induced
DNA damage and reactive oxygen species to accumulate within
keratinocytes; hence, overexpression of AHR may contribute to
the development of non-melanoma skin cancers.
Suggestive novel susceptibility loci. We also provide evidence of
additional SCC susceptibility loci. Three loci, 6p21.32 (rs28993540),
3q28 (rs11715549) and 8q23.3 (rs199816436), with high imputation
quality (R240.9) were associated with SCC risk in stage 1
(Po10� 5) but did not reach Po0.05 in stage 2, or Po5� 10� 8 in
the
overall
meta-analysis
(Supplementary
Table
11
and
Supplementary Fig. 12). rs28993540 lies 35kb upstream of
HLA-DQB1. Transplant and other immunosuppressed patients are
at significantly increased risk of SCCs suggesting a role for T-cell-
mediated protection against SCC27. HLA-DQB1 alleles have been
associated with risk of squamous cell cervical cancer and may
function by altering the efficiency of the T-cell-mediated immune
response to HPV antigens28. rs11715549 resides in a potential

Avg imp, average imputation; GWAS, genome-wide association study; MAF, minor allele frequency; OR, odds ratio; SCC, squamous cell carcinoma; SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism.
Ten loci previously reported as associated with SCC via prior GWAS (Po5 � 10 � 8) are listed, the first seven of which also reached genome-wide significance in this study. Of the remaining three loci
(asterisks), two (3p13 and 3q28) reached nominal significance (Po0.05) in this study. In addition, we report genetic locus, nearest genes, major allele, minor allele, MAF as calculated from stage 1 data,
avg imp r2 (a measure of imputation quality) for stage 1 and OR with P-value for each stage, calculated with respect to the minor allele. The right-most two columns list P-value and OR from prior GWAS3
for each locus, relative to the minor allele.

 enhancer in keratinocytes within LPP, a gene involved in epithelial
cell motility and cell–cell adhesion. rs11715549 is in tight linkage
disequilibrium with SNPs associated with vitiligo (rs9851967,

celiac
disease
(rs1464510,

and
allergy
(rs9860547, r2 ¼ 0.87)8,29. rs199816436 lies inside an intron in
TRPS1, a transcription factor that represses GATA-regulated genes
and binds to a dynein light chain protein. rs199816436 is tightly
correlated with rs10808475 (r2¼ 0.85) and is a TRPS1 expression
quantitative trait locus (eQTL) in liver30. Defects in TRPS1 lead to
trichorhinophalangeal syndrome, a genetic syndrome characterized
by coarse facies, brittle hair and skeletal defects. Although falling
short of genome-wide significance, this evidence is nonetheless
suggestive of an association between these loci and SCC that merits
further investigation.
This two-stage meta-analysis provides the first independent
replication of nine of ten previously reported SCC susceptibility
loci and identifies four novel susceptibility loci. In addition, this
large-scale
GWAS
demonstrates
the
power
of
consumer
self-reported data from internet platforms as a resource for
discovering cancer susceptibility loci, with results consistent with
studies using adjudicated cancer data.
Methods
Stage 1 study design and population. 23andMe (Mountain View, CA), a genetics
company, provided free access to anonymized genetic and phenotypic information
for stage 1 of this GWAS. All information came from 23andMe research
participants who provided informed consent to take part in this research, in accord
with 23andMe’s human subjects protocol (reviewed and approved by Ethical and
Independent Review Services, an Association for the Accreditation of Human
Research Protection Program (AAHRPP)-accredited Institutional Review Board
(IRB)). 23andMe gathers genetic information by genotyping sample material
provided by its customers; phenotypic information is collected via customer
responses to online surveys. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are discussed below.
Stage 1 genome-wide association analysis. Association analysis for stage 1 was
performed using logistic regression, assuming an additive model for allelic effects.
The analysis was adjusted for age, sex and population stratification (using the first
five principal components), generating the following model:
SCC diagnosis � age þ sex þ pc:0 þ pc:1 þ pc:2 þ pc:3 þ pc:4 þ genotype:
ð1Þ
The association test P-value was computed using a likelihood ratio test. Results for
the X chromosome were computed similarly, with male genotypes coded as if they
were homozygous diploid for the observed allele. In addition, test statistics were
adjusted for genomic control, to correct for residual population stratification
persisting after principal component analysis; the genomic control inflation factor
was 1.085 (computed from the median P-value for results that passed quality
control). Regions of interest were defined by identifying SNPs with Po10 � 5, then
grouping these into intervals separated by gaps of at least 250 kb and choosing the
SNP with smallest P within each interval.
Stage 1 genotyping and quality control. Samples were genotyped on one of four
genotyping platforms. The V1 and V2 platforms were variants of the Illumina
HumanHap550 þ BeadChip, including about 25,000 custom SNPs selected by
23andMe, with a total of about 560,000 SNPs. The V3 platform was based on the
Illumina OmniExpress þ BeadChip, with custom content to improve the overlap
with our V2 array, with a total of B950,000 SNPs. The V4 platform in current use
is a fully custom array, including a lower redundancy subset of V2 and V3 SNPs
with additional coverage of lower-frequency coding variation, and B570,000 SNPs.
Samples that failed to reach 98.5% call rate were re-analysed. Individuals whose
analyses failed repeatedly were re-contacted by 23andMe customer service to
provide additional samples, as is done for all 23andMe customers.
Individuals were only included if they had 497% European ancestry, as determined
through an analysis of local ancestry31. Briefly, this analysis first partitions phased
genomic data into short windows of B100 SNPs. Within each window, a support
vector machine is used to classify individual haplotypes into one of 31 reference
populations. The support vector machine classifications are then fed into a hidden
Markov model (HMM) that accounts for switch errors and incorrect assignments, and
gives probabilities for each reference population in each window. Finally, simulated
admixed individuals are used to recalibrate the HMM probabilities so that the reported
assignments are consistent with the simulated admixture proportions. The reference
population data are derived from public data sets (the Human Genome Diversity
Project, HapMap and 1000 Genomes) and from 23andMe research participants who
have reported having four grandparents from the same country.
A maximal set of unrelated individuals was chosen for each analysis using a
segmental identity-by-descent (IBD) estimation algorithm32. Individuals were
defined as related if they shared more than 700 cM IBD, including regions where the
two individuals share either one or both genomic segments identical-by-descent.
This level of relatedness (roughly 20% of the genome) corresponds approximately to
the minimal expected sharing between first cousins in an outbred population.
Participant genotype data were imputed against the March 2012 ‘v3’ release of
1000 Genomes reference haplotypes33. Data for each genotyping platform were
phased and imputed separately. First, Beagle34 (version 3.3.1) was used to phase
batches of 8,000–9,000 individuals across chromosomal segments of no more than
10,000 genotyped SNPs, with overlaps of 200 SNPs. SNPs with Hardy–Weinberg
equilibrium Po10 � 20, call rate o95%, or with large allele frequency discrepancies
compared with European 1000 Genomes reference data were excluded. Frequency
discrepancies were identified by computing a 2 � 2 table of allele counts for
European 1000 Genomes samples and 2,000 randomly sampled 23andMe research
participants with European ancestry, and identifying SNPs with a w2-Po10 � 15.
Each phased segment was imputed against all-ethnicity 1000 Genomes haplotypes
(excluding monomorphic and singleton sites) using Minimac2 (ref. 35), using 5
rounds and 200 states for parameter estimation.
For the non-pseudoautosomal region of the X chromosome, males and females
were phased together in segments, treating the males as already phased; the
pseudoautosomal regions were phased separately. Males and females were then
imputed together using minimac, as with the autosomes, treating males as
homozygous pseudo-diploids for the non-pseudoautosomal region.
For quality control of genotyped GWAS results, SNPs that were only genotyped
on the ‘V1’ platform were flagged due to small sample size, and SNPs on chrM or
chrY, because many of these are not currently called reliably. Using trio data, SNPs
that failed a test for parent–offspring transmission were also flagged; specifically,
the child’s allele count was regressed against the mean parental allele count and
SNPs with fitted bo0.6 and Po10 � 20 for a test of bo1 were flagged. SNPs with a
Hardy–Weinberg Po10 � 20 in Europeans, or a call rate of o90%, were also
flagged. Genotyped SNPs were also tested for genotype date effects and SNPs with
Po10 � 50 by analysis of variance of SNP genotypes against a factor dividing
genotyping date into 20 roughly equal-sized buckets were flagged.
For imputed GWAS results, SNPs with avg.rsqo0.5 or min.rsqo0.3 in any
imputation batch were flagged, as well as SNPs that had strong evidence of an
imputation batch effect. The batch effect test was an F-test from an analysis of
variance of the SNP dosages against a factor representing imputation batch; results
with Po10 � 50 were flagged. Before GWAS, the largest subset of the data passing
these criteria was identified for each SNP, based on their original genotyping
platform—either v2 þ v3 þ v4, v3 þ v4, v3 or v4 only—and association test results
were computed for whatever was the largest passing set. As a result, there were no
imputed results for SNPs that failed these filters.
When choosing between imputed and genotyped GWAS results, if either the
imputed test passed quality control, or a genotyped test was unavailable, the
imputed result was reported; otherwise, the genotyped result was reported. For tests
using imputed data, imputed dosages were used rather than best-guess genotypes.
Across all results, logistic regression results that did not converge due to
complete separation, identified by abs(effect)410 or stderr410 on the log odds
scale, were flagged. Linear regression results for SNPs with minor allele frequency
o0.1% were also flagged, as tests of low-frequency variants can be sensitive to
violations of the regression assumption of normally distributed residuals. This
methodology has been applied in prior GWAS studies36–38.
Stage 1 phenotype categorization. 23andMe identified SCC cases by using
research participants’ self-reported answers to online questionnaires. Subjects who
answered ‘Yes’ and/or selected SCC from a dropdown menu in response to at least
one of the following questions were defined as cases: ‘Have you ever been diagnosed
by a doctor with squamous cell carcinoma?’ ‘What type of skin cancer did you have?
Please check all that apply.’ ‘What type of skin cancer or cancers have you been
diagnosed with? Please check all that apply.’ ‘Have you ever been diagnosed with
squamous cell carcinoma?’ ‘Have you ever been diagnosed or treated for any of the
following conditions?’ Controls were defined as subjects who answered ‘No’ and did
not select SCC from any relevant dropdown menus. In addition, subjects who
answered ‘No’ to at least one of the following questions (and ‘Yes’ to none) were
defined as controls: ‘Have you ever been diagnosed with cancer, including skin cancer
or cancerous moles?’ ‘Has a doctor ever told you that you have a type of cancer?’ ‘Have
you ever been diagnosed or treated with any of the following conditions?’ Among the
samples with imputed genotypes, 23andMe has 6,579 SCC cases and 280,558 controls.
Sensitivity and specificity of stage 1 self-reported data. To assess the validity of
self-reported phenotypic data in stage 1, 23andMe surveys (pertaining to skin
cancer history and pigmentation) were randomly administered to 188 patients seen
in Stanford outpatient clinics. The survey answers were then compared with
medical records to assess for accuracy with respect to SCC diagnosis, to determine
the sensitivity and specificity of the survey responses. P-values were determined
using w2-analysis. This sub-study was approved by the Stanford University
Institutional Review Board with a waiver of documentation of consent.

 Stage 2 study design and population. The Nurses’ Health Study was established
in 1976, when 121,700 female registered nurses between the ages of 30 and 55 years
residing in 11 larger US states completed and returned an initial self-administered
questionnaire on their medical histories and baseline health-related exposures.
Biennial questionnaires with collection of exposure information on risk factors
have been collected prospectively. Every 2 years, along with exposures, outcome
data with appropriate follow-up of reported disease events are collected. Overall,
follow-up has been high; after more than 20 years, B90% of participants continue
to complete questionnaires. From May 1989 through September 1990, we collected
blood samples from 32,826 participants in the NHS. Information on SCC
development was first collected in the 1984 questionnaire.
The HPFS was established in 1986 when 51,529 men from all 50 US states in
health professions (dentists, pharmacists, optometrists, osteopath physicians,
podiatrists and veterinarians) aged 40–75 years answered a detailed mailed
questionnaire. The average follow-up rate for this cohort over 10 years is 490%.
On each biennial questionnaire, we obtained disease- and health-related
information. Between 1993 and 1994, 18,159 study participants provided blood
samples by overnight courier. Information on SCC development was first collected
in the 1986 questionnaire.
The protocol for this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at
Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health. All of
the participants provided informed consent.
Stage 2 genotyping and quality control. There were 18 GWAS data sets from the
NHS and HPFS as nested case–control studies with cleaned genotype data
available. We combined these data sets into three complied data sets based on their
genotype platform type: Affymetrix, Illumina HumanHap series or Illumina Omni
Express. The Affymetrix data set comprises data on the Affy 6.0 platform
(NHS-type 2 diabetes, NHS-coronary heart disease, HPFS-type 2 diabetes and
HPFS-coronary heart disease). The Illumia HumanHap data set comprises several
platforms: Illumina 550 K (NHS-breast cancer, NHS-Pancreas cancer and HPFS-
pancreas cancer), Illumina 610Q (NHS-kidney stone, HPFS-kidney stone and
HPFS-prostate cancer) and Illumina 660 (NHS-glaucoma and HPFS-glaucoma).
The Illumina Omni Express data set contained only studies genotyped on the
Omni Express platform (NHS-endometrial cancer, NHS-colon cancer,
NHS-mammographic density, NHS-gout, HPFS-colon and HPFS-gout).
We combined the individual data sets that were genotyped on the same platform,
removing any SNPs that were not in all studies and with a missing call rate 45%,
and flipping strands, where appropriate, to create a final compiled data set. This
resulted in 668,283 SNPs in the Affymetrix data set, 459,999 SNPs in the Illumina
HumanHap data set and 565,810 SNPs in the Illumina Omni Express data set.
Analyses were restricted to subjects with self-reported European ancestry. Genetic
principal components were calculated using sets of independent SNPs (12,000–
33,000 SNPs depending on platform). Subjects who did not cluster with other self-
identified Europeans based on the top five principal components were also excluded.
We then ran a pairwise IBD analysis for each combined data set to detect duplicate
and related individuals based on resulting Z-scores. If 0rZ0r0.1, 0rZ1r0.1 and
0.9r2r1.1, then a pair was flagged as being identical twins or duplicates. Pairs were
considered full siblings if 0.17rZ0r0.33, 0.4rZ1r0.6 and 0.17rZ2r0.33. Half
siblings or avunculars were defined as having 0.4rZ1r0.6 and 0rZ2r0.1. Some of
the duplicates flagged in this step were expected, having been genotyped in multiple
data sets and hence having the same cohort identifications (IDs). In this case, one of
each pair was randomly chosen for removal from the data set. Instances where pairs
were flagged as unexpected duplicates with the different cohort IDs, but pairwise
genotype concordance rate40.999, resulted in removal of both individuals from the
pair. Related individuals (full sibs and half sibs/avunculars) were not removed from the
final data sets. In the Affymetrix data set 167 individuals were removed, because they
were duplicates or were flagged for removal from secondary genotype data cleaning,
leaving a total of 8,065 individuals. Of the 6,894 individuals originally in the Illumina
data set 107 were removed, because they were duplicates or flagged for removal in the
genotyping step, leaving 6,787 IDs. In addition, eight pairs of individuals were flagged
as related. In the Omni express data set, there were 5,956 individuals at the start with
39 IDs to remove, leaving 5,917 IDs and 5 pairs of related IDs.
After removing duplicate IDs and flagging related pairs of IDs, we used eigenstrat
to run principal component analysis on each compiled data set, removing one
member from each flagged pair of related individuals. For Affymetrix and Illumina
HumanHap, we used B12,000 SNPs that were filtered, to ensure low pairwise
linkage disequilibrium (LD)39. For the OmniExpress data set we used B33,000 SNPs
that were similarly filtered. We plotted the top eigenvectors using R and examined
the plots for outliers.
Finally, as a quality-control check, we ran logistic regression analyses using each
individual study’s controls as ‘cases’ and the rest of the studies controls as ‘controls.’
For example, in the Illumina Omni Express data set, we ran regressions of NHS-gout
controls considered as ‘cases’ versus the HPFS-gout, NHS-endometrial cancer, NHS-
colon cancer, NHS-mammographic density and HPFS-colon cancer. We then ran
regressions with each of the other study controls as ‘cases’ versus all of the rest of the
controls. We looked for P-values of genome-wide significance (Po10� 8) and
examined QQ plots to determine whether any SNPs were flagged as significant
where no SNPs should have been significant. In the Affymetrix data set, 100 SNPs
were flagged and removed. In the Illumina HumanHap data set, eight SNPs had
Po10� 8 in any of the quality control (QC) regressions and were removed. No SNPs
in the Illumina Omni Express data set had P-valueso10� 8; hence, no additional
SNPs needed to be removed. After the data sets were combined and appropriate SNP
and ID filters applied, the complied data sets were imputed.
Using combined GWAS genotypes on each genotyping platform and the 1000
Genomes Project ALL Phase I Integrated Release Version 3 Haplotypes excluding
monomorphic and singleton sites (2010–11 data freeze, 2012-03-14 haplotypes) as
reference panel, we imputed the genotypes of markers in the 1000 Genomes Project
for 8,065 samples in Affymetrix data set, 6,787 samples in Illumina HumanHap
data set and 5,917 samples in Illumina Omni Express data set.
SNP genotypes were imputed in three steps. First, genotypes on each
chromosome were split into chunks, to facilitate windowed imputation in
parallel using ChunkChromosome (v.2011-08-05) (http://genome.sph.umich.edu/
wiki/ChunkChromosome). Next, each chunk of chromosome was phased using
MACH (v.1.0.18.c) (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MaCH/index.html).
In the final step, Minimac (v.2012-08-15) (http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/
Minimac) was used to impute the phased genotypes to B31 million markers in the
1000 Genomes Project35.
Stage 2 phenotype categorization. Participants in both NHS and HPFS cohorts
reported new SCC diagnosis biennially. With their permission, medical records
were obtained and reviewed to confirm their self-reported diagnosis. Eligible cases
in the NHS and HPFS consisted of participants with pathologically confirmed
invasive SCC, diagnosed any time after baseline up to the 2012 follow-up cycle for
both cohorts. Samples free of diagnosis of SCC were controls in this study. In the
three compiled data sets, samples without information on SCC diagnosis were
excluded. Among the samples with imputed genotypes, we have 367 SCC cases and
5,453 controls in Affymetrix data set, 220 SCC cases and 2,901 controls in Illumina
HumanHap data set and 238 SCC cases and 3,164 controls in Illumina Omni
Express data set— 825 SCC cases and 11,518 controls in total.
Stage 2 genome-wide association analysis. We used ProbABEL software to test
the GWAS association between minor allele counts and SCC risk using imputed
dosage data. We performed logistic regression analysis under an additive model
with adjustment for age, sex, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) history and the first five
principal components, generating the following model:
SCC diagnosis � age þ sex þ BCC history þ pc:1 þ pc:2 þ pc:3 þ pc:4 þ pc:5 þ genotype:
ð2Þ
These principal components were calculated for all individuals on the basis of
B10,000 unlinked markers using the EIGENSTRAT software40. Associations in
each component GWAS set (Affymetrix, Illumina HumanHap series and Illumina
Omni Express) were combined in an inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis
using the METAL software.
Meta-analysis. For all 14 index SNPs, the same meta-analysis was conducted to
combine stage 1 and stage 2. Heterogeneity of per-SNP effect sizes in studies
contributing to the stage 1, stage 2 and overall meta-analyses was assessed and
fixed-effects meta-analysis was conducted. All R2 and D’ values between individual
SNPs were calculated based on the 1000 Genomes Pilot 1 data set, CEU Population
(http://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snap/ldsearchpw.php)41.
Proportion of familial relative risk. We have used the formula for calculating the
proportion of familial relative risk (FRR) as outlined by the Cancer Oncological
Gene-environment Study (http://www.nature.com/icogs/primer/common-variation-
and-heritability-estimates-for-breast-ovarian-and-prostate-cancers/#70) as described
previously42. The ORs derived from our meta-analysis of stage 1 and stage 2 are
assumed to be relative risks. We estimated the proportion of the FRR explained by
each SNP (FRRsnp) as:
FRRsnp¼ pr2 þ q
�
�
= pr þ q
ð
Þ2
ð3Þ
Here, the risk allele and alternative allele frequencies are p and q, respectively, and r
is the OR for the risk allele. Allele frequencies were derived from the 1000 Genomes
Project European population data. Assuming that the loci combine multiplicatively
and are not in linkage disequilibrium, the combined effect of all loci is given by:
lT¼
Y
k
lk
ð4Þ
Here, the product is across all loci. The proportion of the familial relative risk
attributable to the SNPs, on a log scale, is then given by:
log lT
ð
Þ=log lP
ð
Þ
ð5Þ
In this equation, lP is the familial relative risk observed in epidemiological studies. lP
is fourfold for SCC43.
Regulatory function of novel variants. For each novel SCC susceptibility variant,
we searched for evidence of regulatory function using HaploReg version 4
(refs 8,44) (http://www.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php) 45.

 We queried each rsID and extracted data from ENCODE Project Consortium
2011–2012 on closest annotated gene, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing
transcription factor binding, DNaseI hypersensitivity sites, and enhancer and
promoter chromatin segmentation states46–48. Data were also extracted from
Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium 2015 on enhancer and promoter chromatin
segmentation states, specifically using the following states: 15-state HMM, 25-state
HMM, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K9ac49. We particularly focused on
the enhancer and promoter annotations that referenced normal human epidermal
keratinocytes and primary foreskin keratinocytes. Finally, we used HaploReg v4 to
extract eQTL data for each variant, as version 4 is updated with cis eQTL data from
the GTEx pilot analysis and many other studies50. We made special note of variants
that were eQTLs in skin tissue.
Power calculations. Power was computed according to Freidlin et al.51. To
account for misclassification, expected genotype frequencies in study cases were
replaced with a mixture of genotype frequencies in true cases and in true controls.
Power was plotted as a function of OR for detecting a variant with minor allele
frequency 0.1, based on the GWAS sample size and with hypothetical
misclassification rates of 0, 10 and 20% (where the specified fraction of study cases
are misclassified controls).
Data availability. GWAS data from the 23andMe research cohort and Nurses’
Health Study have not been deposited in public repositories, as consent for this was
not obtained in the study protocols. The precomputed rankings and P-values for
SNPs included in the stage 1 GWAS are available upon request by contacting
D.A.H. at dhinds@23andMe.com. Precomputed rankings and P-values for the top
10,000 SNPs included in the stage 2 GWAS are freely available by contacting
www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs. Any additional data (beyond those included in the
main text and Supplementary Information) that support the findings of this study
are available from the corresponding author upon request.
