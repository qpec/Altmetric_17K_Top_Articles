ABSTRACT
Chile is the leading producer of copper worldwide and its richest mineral
deposits are found in the Antofagasta Region of northern Chile. Mining activities
have significantly increased income and employment in the region; however,
there has been little assessment of the resulting environmental impacts to
residents. The port of Antofagasta, located 1,430 km north of Santiago, the capital of
Chile, functioned as mineral stockpile until 1998 and has served as a copper
concentrate stockpile since 2014. Samples were collected in 2014 and 2016 that show
elevated concentrations of As, Cu, Pb, and Zn in street dust and in residents’ blood
(Pb) and urine (As) samples. To interpret and analyze the spatial variability and
likely sources of contamination, existent data of basement rocks and soil
geochemistry in the city as well as public-domain airborne dust were studied.
Additionally, a bioaccessibility assay of airborne dust was conducted and the
chemical daily intake and hazard index were calculated to provide a preliminary
health risk assessment in the vicinity of the port. The main conclusions indicate that
the concentrations of Ba, Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, and V recorded from Antofagasta dust
likely originate from intrusive, volcanic, metamorphic rocks, dikes, or soil within the
city. However, the elevated concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Mo, Pb, and Zn do not
originate from these geologic outcrops, and are thus considered anthropogenic
contaminants. The average concentrations of As, Cu, and Zn are possibly the highest
in recorded street dust worldwide at 239, 10,821, and 11,869 mg kg-1, respectively.
Furthermore, the contaminants As, Pb, and Cu exhibit the highest bioaccessibilities
and preliminary health risk indices show that As and Cu contribute to elevated
health risks in exposed children and adults chronically exposed to dust in

an increased environmental awareness and greater protective measures are
necessary in Antofagasta and possibly other similar mining port cities in developing
countries.

INTRODUCTION
The process of economic development often results in large-scale anthropogenic impacts
to the environment and inhabitants of developing countries. Previous well-reported
examples of environmental pollution caused by industrial activities include: (i) the 1984
Bhopal incident in India after more than 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a
pesticide plant (Broughton, 2005), (ii) Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986, after the nuclear
energy plant explosion of Reactor 4 (Devell et al., 1986; Gale, 1987), (iii) the Baia Mare
spill, Romania, in 2000, where nearly 100,000 m3 of cyanide and metal-rich liquid
waste was released into the river system near this city (Lucas, 2001; Solda
´n et al., 2001), and
(iv) Sukinda, India, where the most harmful form of chromium (Cr[VI]) pollutes water
and inhabitants due to mining activities (Dubey, Sahoo & Nayak, 2001). As such,
industrial incidents have been related to severe health issues and fatalities
(Khan & Abbasi, 1999).
Despite harmful consequences that industry and uncontrolled anthropogenic
activities have caused and are still contributing to (Reddy & Yarrakula, 2016), an
awareness of the environmental impact of these activities is growing in many developing
countries. Chile, a developing country located along the western border of southern
South America, is one example where an environmental awareness has increased with
time on a national scale. Among its developing characteristics is the fact that the country
predominantly relies on the exploration, exploitation, and exportation of mineral
resources as one of its main economic activities (De Solminihac, Gonzales & Cerda,
2017). Although often associated with environmental degradation, these activities
support an elevated gross domestic product (GDP) that has allowed Chile to be included
in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD;
Ruiz-Rudolph et al., 2016).
Antofagasta Region background
Copper (Cu) is the most significant metallic resource of Chile: the country has
contributed approximately 28% of the world’s Cu production since 1985 (COCHILCO,
2014). This element is naturally distributed in northern Chile, principally in the
Antofagasta Region (Fig. 1A; Aroca, 2001), where large-to-giant porphyry copper deposits
are found (e.g., Chuquicamata, La Escondida, and Radomiro Tomic, among others;
Tapia et al. (2018), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.4699
2/30
 Fig. 1B). As such, numerous large-scale mining operations and mineral deposits in the
Antofagasta Region have supported the economic development of the region to the point
where the per capita GDP is the highest in the country.
Following the War of the Pacific (1879–1884), Chile and Bolivia signed a trade
agreement in 1904 which allowed Bolivian products to be exported from the Train
Station and Port of Antofagasta, where resultantly, unprotected stockpiles
containing metals (mainly Pb) became common at those facilities (Sepu
´lveda, Vega
& Delgado, 2000).
It is also important to consider other natural and anthropogenic sources of
contamination in Antofagasta that accompanied heightened mining and a related
increase in population (by a factor of nearly 6.5 between 1895 (13,530 inhabitants;
Censo, 1895) and 1960 (87,860 inhabitants; Censo, 1960)): (i) of the sparse fresh
water sources in the region, the Toconce and Holajar rivers were naturally enriched
in As, resulting in chronic contamination of drinking water until 1970 (Marshall et al.,
2007), and (ii) in the late 1970s, La Negra Industrial Complex was established 33 km
southeast of Antofagasta which included cement production (Industria Nacional de
Cemento SA, Antofagasta, Chile and Inacesa, Antofagasta, Chile), lithium (Li)
processing (Sociedad Chilena del Litio, Antofagasta, Chile and SQM, Antofagasta,

 Chile), and a smelter (Refimet, currently Altonorte of Xstrata Copper;
Minerı
´a Chilena, 2013).
At the end of 1980s, elevated Pb levels in blood were reported in children attending
schools and living close to the Antofagasta Port and Antofagasta Train Station facilities
(Sepu
´lveda, Vega & Delgado, 2000; Tchernitchin et al., 2006). As a result, in the early 1990s,
the stockpiles of Pb-rich materials originating from Bolivia were transferred to Portezuelo,
18 km southeast of downtown Antofagasta, in close proximity to La Negra Industrial
Complex. Protective measures related to the transport and deposition of concentrate from
Portezuelo to Antofagasta Port were not known to be established prior to 2010 (Chilean
Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications (MTT), 2015).
Combined lung and bladder cancer mortality rates in the Antofagasta Region were
the highest reported for the whole country between 1992 and 1994 (153 and 50 per
100,000 men and women, respectively), attributable to the chronic ingestion of As
between 1958 and 1970 (Marshall et al., 2007). In 2014, despite documented adverse
health impacts to the population of Antofagasta and relocation of the Bolivian
stockpiles, the development of Cu, Mo, and Ag exploitation in the Sierra Gorda
district, 140 km northeast of the city of Antofagasta (Fig. 1B; Minerı
´a Chilena, 2014),
led to the construction of a holding facility inside the Antofagasta Port called the
galpo
´n (warehouse), located close to the center of the city, which currently stores
Chilean Cu concentrate. Aside from Cu (nearly 32%), the concentrate contains other
elements such as S, Fe, Zn, As, Pb, Mo, Sb, and Cd (Table 1 in Fuentes, Vin
˜als &
Herreros, 2009). As port operations continued, local inhabitants noticed the increase
of dust on buildings etc., which led to criticism of the operations associated with
the galpo
´n and the port. As a result, social organizations were established, such as
Este polvo te mata (“This dust kills you”), leading to ongoing environmental conflicts
within the city.
Currently, the city of Antofagasta has 361,873 inhabitants (Instituto Nacional de
Estadı
´sticas (INE), 2017), which is nearly four times greater than the 1960 population
(Censo, 1960). The city has grown and developed around the port (Fig. 1C); as a result,
5.7% of the national state load and 17.3% of all regional transport passes through the port
(Chilean Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications (MTT), 2015). Important
locations situated near the Antofagasta Port include the downtown area of Antofagasta,
hospitals, schools, preschools, the municipal square, the city shopping mall, and
commercial centers (Fig. 1C).
Previous sampling campaigns
Due to increased social pressure associated with the Antofagasta dust, in 2014, the
Chilean State sampled city dust and human blood and urine from locations in close
proximity to, and up to 9 km distance from the Antofagasta Port (Table 1).
Contaminant concentrations were quantified in the <63 mm size fraction by the Chilean
Public Health Institute (Instituto de Salud Pu
´blica (ISP), 2014). Elevated levels of
Pb in blood and of As in urine were found in children attending preschools close to
Tapia et al. (2018), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.4699
4/30
 the Antofagasta Port, and elevated concentrations of a number of elements were also
reported in street dust, including As, Cu, Pb, and Zn (Vergara, 2015). More recently, the
Chilean College of Physicians (CM-Colegio Me
´dico) undertook another sampling
campaign in 2016 to compare concentrations with the values from 2014 for determining
which contaminants were still present in the <63 mm size fraction of dust (Tchernitchin
& Bolados, 2016). Details regarding the methodologies used in these previous studies are
found in Table 2.

 Study objectives
Despite the recent 2014 and 2016 sampling events, no analyses were conducted to evaluate
and understand the spatial distribution, variation, and sources associated with health risks
by exposure to these metallic and metalloid (As) contaminants apart from their
bioaccessibility. Also, regardless of well-reported improvements in the technology used to
transport and store material inside the Antofagasta Port (Chilean Ministry of Transport
and Telecommunications (MTT), 2015), currently there is little evidence that the
environmental issues and negative health impacts on Antofagasta residents have
improved, and regulations have not been put into effect to control the contamination.
Therefore, considering the need to better understand and establish (i) the spatial-
temporal variability of the present contaminants, (ii) the likely source of contamination
through the comparison of natural background concentrations, (iii) human health risk
standards associated with exposure to the dust from the Antofagasta Port, and (iv) the
bioaccessibility of the contaminant elements, a health risk assessment and
bioaccessibility assay were conducted, and raw data collected in 2014 (ISP, 2014) and
2016 (Tchernitchin & Bolados, 2016) was further interpreted and analyzed to improve
the understanding of pollution in Antofagasta and better inform regulators and
interested parties in the support of new environmental policies and regulations.
METHODOLOGY
Data compilation
Information related to the elemental concentrations of metals was compiled from
previous studies of (i) street dust and (ii) the composition of geologic outcrops, weathered
products, and soil in the area of Antofagasta.

 Antofagasta street dust
Starting 1993, leaded fuels were banned by law in Santiago, Chile (Faiz, Weaver & Walsh,
1996), as well as in other regions of the country thereafter. In medium- to low-size coastal
cities of Chile, such as Tocopilla, located at 175 km north of Antofagasta, it has been
shown that vehicle emissions do not significantly contribute to ambient particulate matter
(PM) concentrations in the city (Jorquera, 2009). Therefore, street dust in urban areas
of Antofagasta is considered to be an indicator of metal and metalloid contamination
from atmospheric deposition, and public dust samples from a number of key city
locations were compiled from ISP (2014) and CM (Tchernitchin & Bolados, 2016)
(Tables 1 and 2). These sampling data are simply reported from those sources and
reinterpreted in the context of other factors such as the background geology, which
depending on the host rock mineral composition, can weather and contribute to increased
concentrations of the same contaminant elements.
Geologic outcrops, weathered products, and soil
The main geologic formations of Antofagasta correspond to Jurassic volcanic basic to
intermediate rocks of the La Negra Formation and Neogene marine sedimentary rocks of
La Portada Formation, constituted by sandstones and coquinas, of which the latter is a
form of limestone represented by an agglomerate of shells (National Service of Geology and
Mining Service (SERNAGEOMIN), 2003). Concentrations of As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe,
Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn of volcanic, intrusive, metamorphic rocks, and dikes of
Antofagasta were compiled from Lucassen & Franz (1994), Oliveros et al. (2007), and
Rogers & Hawkesworth (1989) (Fig. 2A). In addition, unpublished data (As and Mo) from
Oliveros et al. (2007) was utilized. Element concentrations from sedimentary rocks of the
La Portada Formation were not available, however the composition of soil, an exogenous
matrix associated with the weathering of parent rocks, was obtained from De Gregori et al.
(2003; two soils around Antofagasta) and CENMA (2014; 15 background samples and two
contaminated samples from Antofagasta). A brief summary of the methodologies used in
these studies is presented in Table 2.
Data analysis
Spatial distribution of the geologic outcrops and dust samples
The spatial distribution of regional volcanic, intrusive, metamorphic rocks, dikes, and
soils was plotted using the Geographic Information System QGIS (2.6.1 Brighton)
software (Fig. 2A). Local-scale surficial geology (1:50,000), provided by the program
Geologı
´a para el Ordenamiento Territorial de Antofagasta of the National Service of Geology
and Mining (Servicio Nacional de Geologı
´a y Minerı
´a National Service of Geology and
Mining Service (SERNAGEOMIN), 2014), was used to plot the distribution of Antofagasta
dust samples and their corresponding relationship to the geologic outcrops (Fig. 2B).
Metal and metalloid statistics
To determine basic characteristics of the As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, V, and
Zn data, univariate statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, median, minimum,
maximum, lower, and upper limit of confidence interval (95%)) were calculated in

 SYSTAT (Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA). Principal component analysis (PCA) was
conducted on loge(x + 1)-transformed, normalized data in PRIMER 7 (Clarke & Gorley,
2006). In addition, comparisons to the upper continental crust (UCC; from Rudnick &
Gao, 2003) are also presented.
Geo-accumulation index and enrichment factor
To infer contaminant elements and sources of street dust, numerous studies have utilized
the geoaccumulation index (Igeo; Eq. (1); e.g., Lu et al., 2009; Li et al., 2013) and
enrichment factor (EF; Eq. (2); e.g., Zoller, Gladney & Duce, 1974; Lu et al., 2009),
respectively.
Igeo ¼ log2
Cn
1:5 � Bn

(1)
In Eq. (1), Cn corresponds to the measured concentration of metal n in the sediment and
Bn is the local background value of the metal n. A factor of 1.5 was used for possible
variations of the local background due to variable lithologies (Muller, 1979; Nowrouzi &
Pourkhabbaz, 2014). The local background value (Bn) of each metal was obtained from
volcanic, intrusive, metamorphic rocks, dikes, and soils in the region. Specific values of
the Igeo index indicate the following:
Igeo � 0, the sample is not contaminated;
0 < Igeo � 1, the sample is non- to slightly contaminated;
1 < Igeo � 2, the sample is moderately contaminated;
2 < Igeo � 3, the sample is moderately to highly contaminated;
3 < Igeo � 4, the sample is highly contaminated;
4 < Igeo � 5, the sample is highly to extremely contaminated;
Igeo > 5, the sample is extremely contaminated.
Enrichment factors (Eq. (2)) were calculated using the geochemical composition
of basement rocks and soil of Antofagasta, with Fe as the normalizing
element.

In Eq. (2), EF is equivalent to the Enrichment Factor (Zoller, Gladney & Duce, 1974).
M1 is the metal or metalloid concentration in the sample, Eref1 is the reference element
in the sample (Fe), M2 is the background concentration of the metal or metalloid, and
Eref2 is the background concentration of the reference element (Fe in intrusive, volcanic,
metamorphic rocks, dikes, and soil of Antofagasta). Fe, Al, or Ti have been used as
reference elements in previous studies (Rule, 1986; Ergin et al., 1991; Tapia et al., 2012);
however, Fe was chosen as the reference element here because it was the only conservative
element present in all of the utilized data sets.

 Health risk assessment
To obtain a preliminary health risk assessment associated with exposure to Antofagasta
dust, the chemical daily intake (CDI; Eq. (3)) of the studied elements was calculated
by ingestion exposure while considering the start of the galpo
´n and chronic exposure as
two and 70 years, respectively. Dust consumption and body weight were obtained from
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (1989a).
CDIingestion ¼ C � IngR � Efreq � Edur
BW � AT
(3)
In Eq. (3), CDIingestion corresponds to the chemical daily intake (in mg · kg-1 · day-1),
while C is the 95% confidence upper limit of the metal or metalloid concentration (in
mg · kg-1), IngR is the dust ingestion rate (200 mg · day-1 for children under six and
100 mg · day-1 for adults), Efreq is the exposure frequency (days · year-1), Edur is the
exposure duration (years), BW is the average body weight, and AT is the average time of
exposure (ED � 365 days for non-chronic exposure; 70 � 365 days for chronic exposure).
As suggested by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (1989a) the hazard
index by oral ingestion (HIingestion; Eq. (4)) of the Antofagasta dust was preliminarily
obtained using the CDIingestion and reference doses (RfD) from literature (As: United
States Environmental Protection Agency (1991a); Ba: Dallas & Williams (2001); Cd: United
States Environmental Protection Agency (1989b); Co: Finley et al. (2012); Cr(VI): United
States Environmental Protection Agency (1998); Mo: United States Environmental
Protection Agency (1992); Ni (soluble salts of Ni): United States Environmental Protection
Agency (1991a); V: Risk Assessment Information System (RAIS) (1991); Zn: United States
Environmental Protection Agency (2005)). For Cu, the HIingestion was obtained with the
minimal risk level (MRL; ATSDR, 2004), and for Pb, the HIingestion was not calculated
because the RfDPb (Pb reference dose) does not exist given that Pb is considered toxic at
any concentration (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2004).
HIingestion¼ CDIingestion
RfD
(4)
In Eq. (4), HIingestion is the hazard index (by ingestion), CDIingestion is the chemical
daily intake (by ingestion), and RfD is the reference dose (United States Environmental
Protection Agency, 1989a). The greater the value of HI above unity (1), the greater the level
of concern. Therefore HI � 1 suggests unlikely adverse health effects whereas HI > 1
suggests the probability of adverse health effects (Luo et al., 2012; Massey, Kulshrestha &
Taneja, 2013). For As, in the case of HI > 1, health effects have been related to cellular
necrosis and cancer (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 1991b).
Bioaccessibility assay
Health effects caused by exposure to the different components of dust mainly occur by
ingestion of small-sized PM. Fine and ultrafine particles (smaller than 2.5 mm in diameter;
�PM2.5) present a health risk due to their entrance into the bloodstream from lung
alveoli, whereas larger particles (>PM2.5) are momentarily retained in the bronchi and
Tapia et al. (2018), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.4699
10/30
 bronchiole and are then expelled from the cilia of epithelial cells in the respiratory tract.
Subsequently, these particles are swallowed, and once in the stomach, gastric hydrochloric
acid at pH 2.0 partially solubilize components which constitute the bioaccessible fraction
of the dust used to estimate the amount available for absorption across the gastrointestinal
barrier (Bradham et al., 2017). Therefore, a higher bioaccessibility of a contaminant
element signifies that a larger fraction will enter the human bloodstream.
To compliment the health risk assessment, a bioaccessibility assay was performed at three
sites close to the Antofagasta Port. Following existent methodologies (Corte
´s et al., 2015),
this assay was performed in the dust fraction of a diameter less than 63 mm (mesh #230).
Dust was digested with chloridric acid at a pH of 2 and a temperature of 37 �C, for 2 hours,
in order to resemble the digestive conditions of the human stomach. Three replicates were
used for every sample and the standard recovery varied between 82% and 98%. Elements
within the digested residue were quantified by ICP-OES.
RESULTS
Statistical summary and spatial variation
Compared to the UCC mean concentrations (Rudnick & Gao, 2003; Table 3),
Antofagasta dust concentrations of Co, Cr, Mn, and V from 2014 and 2016 were similar,
whereas Ba and Ni were lower. These elements also exhibited a lower relative standard
deviation (s O mean � 100) when compared to the mean concentration of all considered
data. This variability ranged from 21% to 69% for V and Ba, respectively (Table 3).
Comparing concentrations from 2014 and 2016 at locations within a 0.5 km distance from
the Antofagasta Port, mean values of Ba (+96%), Co (+71%), Ni (+33%), and V (+32%)
increased, and Cr (-3%) and Co (-3%) showed a slight decrease.
The elements As, Cd, Cu, Mo, Pb, and Zn showed mean concentrations that were 2 (As,
Mo, and Pb) and 3 (Cd, Cu, and Zn) orders of magnitude higher than the UCC. They also
displayed the highest relative standard deviations when all data were considered, ranging
from 91% for Cu and Zn to 120% for Pb (Table 3). Concentrations of As (-49%), Cu
(-17%), and Pb (-87%) showed a significant decrease in their mean values between 2014
and 2016, while Cd (+44%), Mo (+72%), and Zn (+56%) showed increased mean
concentrations within a 0.5 km radius of the Antofagasta Port (Table 3). Despite the high
observed variability in element concentrations of the Antofagasta dust, the highest
concentration values of As, Cd, Cu, Mo, Pb, and Zn were evident near the facility (Fig. 3).
Negative Pearson correlations between these elements and distance to the Antofagasta
Port range between -0.28 and -0.43 (considering all data), indicating that the element
concentrations decreased with distance from the port (Table 3). The elements Co, Ni, and
V showed slightly higher values near Antofagasta Port that are different from Ba, Cr, and
Mn which tended to increase as a function of distance from the port. However, all
concentrations are within the same order of magnitude. For these elements, Pearson
correlations are lower than 0.57 (Table 3).
Finally, the PCA of the data identified two main associations. These were related to
samples located less than 0.5 km and greater than 0.5 km away from the Antofagasta Port
(Fig. 4).

 Contaminants and sources
Results for the Igeo index (Muller, 1979) are shown in Table 4. Two groups are clearly
observed: the non-contaminants, including Ba, Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, and V, and the
contaminants, which include As, Cd, Cu, Mo, Pb, and Zn. With the exception of As indices
calculated with a soil background, all elements classified as contaminants are considered
extreme contaminants within a 0.5 km distance from the Antofagasta Port (Table 4).
The EF results are summarized in Table 5. The same elements classified as non-
contaminants exhibit low EFs (generally lower than 3), indicating that they likely originate
from volcanic, intrusive, metamorphic rocks, dikes, or soils within the immediate areas of
Antofagasta. Conversely, contaminant elements exhibit higher EFs near the port, which

 suggests that the source is not related to the geology of Antofagasta and is more
concentrated close to this facility (Table 5).
Health risk assessment and bioaccessibility of dust
The CDIs and HIs related to Antofagasta dust ingestion are summarized in Table 6.
As previously defined, if a child between zero and six years of age ingests 200 mg · day-1 of
Antofagasta dust, on average, during two years of exposure (or from the start of operation
of the galpo
´n), the HIs related to As and Cu are elevated at all sampling points, even 3 km
away from the Antofagasta Port. Conversely, Cd and Zn represent a low hazard 1 and
0.5 km from the port, respectively (Table 6B). For adults living in Antofagasta with a mean
body mass of 70 kg that consume 100 mg · day-1 of dust, on average, over 70 years
(signifying chronic exposure), As and Cu are moderately hazardous elements within
0.5 km of the port and slightly hazardous within 1 km of the facility (Table 6B). With the
exception of Pb, which does not have a RfD value, given that it is highly hazardous at any
concentration (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2004), the elements Ba, Co,
Cr, Mn, Mo, Ni, and V are not considered harmful to infants and adults.
Results of the mean bioaccessibility of contaminant elements at three sites close to the
port are presented in Table 7. It is apparent that As has the highest bioaccessibility (50%),
signifying that it can more readily enter the human bloodstream in comparison to the

 DISCUSSIONS
Comparison to worldwide city dust
The results of this analysis of existing street dust data from Antofagasta indicate that
As, Cd, Cu, Mo, Pb, and Zn are contaminants and their notably high concentrations
are not related to the geochemistry of outcrops or soil of the city. To compare these
results in a national and international context, the mean and standard deviation of these
contaminants and the non-contaminant elements (Ba, Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, and V) were
compared to: (i) dust accumulated in Platanus orientalis leaves of the main east–west
highway of Santiago (Alameda), the capital of Chile (13 sites, Tapia et al., 2009),
(ii) resuspended dust from Fushun, China (17 dust samples collected from unfrequently
cleaned windowsills or plat floors), a coal-based city (Kong et al., 2011), (iii) street dust
from Baoji, an important industrial city in Northwest China which has experienced a
rapid urbanization and industrialization during the last decades (Lu et al., 2009),
(iv) street dust from Zhuzhou, a heavily industrialized city in central China
(Li et al., 2013), (v) dust from the industrial area of Qingshan district (QS) in Wuhan,
China, one of the largest metropolises in that country (Zhu et al., 2013), and (vi) road dust

 from the Islamabad Expressway (Faiz et al., 2009), one of the busiest roads in the capital of
Pakistan (Table 8).
The concentrations of the contaminants As, Cu, and Zn in Antofagasta dust are
strikingly high in comparison to street or urban dusts from heavily industrialized cities
of Chile, China, or Pakistan. Mn and Mo concentrations are similar to Santiago city
dust, while Pb and Cd concentration values are lower and comparable, respectively, to
Zhouzhou dust. On the contrary, resuspended dust from the coal-based city of Fushun
contains the highest values of Co, Cr, and Ni, and dust from the industrial QS district
presents the highest concentrations of Ba (Table 8).
Anthropogenic sources of contamination
Based on the results of this study, there exists a strong correlation in Antofagasta between
elevated concentrations of several key contaminants and their proximity to the
Antofagasta Port. This indicates that materials stored in the port represent a source of As,
Cd, Cu, Mo, Pb, and Zn that is measurable in Antofagasta city dust. In Table 4, these
contaminants show higher Igeo values near the port; therefore, contamination increases
close to the facility. In addition, their EFs were higher near the port (Table 5). This
relationship is not shown by the non-contaminant elements (Tables 4 and 5), as some of
their EFs are equal to 1, indicating that Ba might originate from volcanics, Co from
volcanics or intrusives, Cr from intrusives or soil, Mn from metamorphic, volcanic, or
intrusive rocks, Ni from soil, and V from all rocks of the city (Table 5). Conversely, EFs
obtained for As, Cd, Cu, Mo, Pb, and Zn were generally greater than 20, indicating that
their sources cannot be from rocks and soil present in the city (Table 5). To support this
conclusion, other studies conducted in marine environments of the Bay of Antofagasta
have showed that enrichment of metals such as Cu, Pb, and Zn in coastal waters, bottom

 sediments, and benthic organisms are related to industrial activities developed along the
coastal border of the bay (Salamanca et al., 2000; Le
´pez, Furet & Aracena, 2001; Salamanca,
Jara & Rodrı
´guez, 2004; Valde
´s et al., 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015; Caldero
´n & Valde
´s, 2012).
As potential sources of anthropogenic contamination, Chilean Cu concentrates and
Bolivian stockpiles are addressed individually in the two following subsections.
Cu concentrate
Chilean Cu concentrates are notably rich in As, containing on average from 1% or
10,000 mg · kg-1 (Cantallopts, 2015) to 2.5% or 25,000 mg · kg-1 (Herreros et al., 2003) of
this metalloid, indicating that the Cu concentrate stored in the Antofagasta Port
represents an important source of As. Indeed, the average As in Antofagasta dust
(239 mg · kg-1) represents only 2.4% of the average As concentration of Chilean Cu
concentrate (10,000 mg · kg-1).
The Sierra Gorda Mine, which is situated within a Cu–Mo porphyry deposit (Brunetti,
2011), produces 120,000 tons of Cu, 50 million pounds of Mo, and 10 million pounds of
Au each year (Sierra Gorda website), meaning that the Cu concentrates of this mine
(and the materials stored in the galpo
´n) are rich in Mo. This is supported by the fact that
many of the most important porphyry copper deposits of Chile exploit Mo as a
byproduct; for instance, there has been an average of (i) 9,212 tons every year, since 1997,
of Mo in the concentrate of Chuquicamata and Radomiro Tomic and (ii) 8,572 tons, since
2000, in the concentrate of Los Pelambres (COCHILCO, 2016). Chilean porphyries can
also be related to Zn anomalies (e.g., La Escondida; Garza, Titley & Pimentel, 2001).
Therefore, Cu concentrate stored in the Antofagasta Port likely also acts as a source of the
high concentrations of As, Mo, and Zn recorded in street dust.
Bolivian stockpiles
The elementary concentrations of stockpiles from Bolivia that were stored in the port until
the 1990s are unknown, yet they contained Pb and Zn (El Mercurio, 2010). This reflects the
fact that Bolivian mineral deposits are typically polymetallic. For instance, Cerro Rico
from Potosı
´ was the largest silver (Ag) deposit known and is associated with base minerals
such as cassiterite (SnO2), sphalerite ((Zn,Fe)S), and galena (PbS); the San Cristo
´bal
District contains 2.0 oz · t-1 Ag, 1.67% Zn, and 0.58% Pb with minerals such as galena,
sphalerite, pyrite (FeS2), and chalcopyrite (CuFeS2); and Pulacayo hosts minerals such as
sphalerite, tetrahedrite ((Cu,Fe)12Sb4S13), freibergite ((Ag,Cu,Fe)12(Sb,As)4S13),
argentiferous galena, and chalcopyrite (Kamenov, Macfarlane & Riciputi, 2002). These
polymetallic mineral ores are related to Pb, Zn, and Cu, which could explain the presence
of these elements in dust sampled in close proximity to the Antofagasta Port. In addition,
minerals containing Zn, Pb, and Cu are natural sources of Cd (ATSDR, 2012), which could
explain its enrichment near the Antofagasta Port.
Health risk
The bioaccessibility of dust components was investigated in solid materials (i.e., mud and
sediment) of Chan
˜aral, Atacama Region (300 km south of Antofagasta), an environment
similar to Antofagasta, revealing that the bioaccessibility percentages of some
Tapia et al. (2018), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.4699
20/30
 contaminant elements range from: 26% to 49% for As, 24% to 84% for Cu, 67% to 96%
for Pb, and 19% to 79% for Zn (Corte
´s et al., 2015). In the case of the three sites studied in
relation to dust of the Antofagasta Port (Table 7), As is highly bioaccessible (50%),
followed by Pb (26%) and Cu (20%). These significant bioaccessibilities are supported by
the fact that As and Cu show the highest HIs in the street dust (Table 6B).
The health effects of chronic exposure to toxic metals and metalloids are well-known.
For example, following chronic exposure of 30 or more years to As, the probability of
mortality increases dramatically due to lung and bladder cancers. In addition, prenatal or
infant exposure to low levels of these elements, through the mechanism of epigenetic
imprinting, can cause irreversible biochemical changes that promote the development of
various organic diseases or neurobehavioral alterations in later years (Tchernitchin et al.,
2013; Tchernitchin & Gaete, 2015). Also, the prenatal exposure to As increases the
probability of mortality due to bronchiectasis between the ages of 30–49 years (Smith &
Steinmaus, 2009); prenatal or infant exposure to Pb affects reproductive functions,
decreases intelligence, and causes serious neurobehavioral changes in later stages of life
(Tchernitchin et al., 2013).
Recommendations and considerations
Street dust from Antofagasta likely represents the highest recorded concentrations of As,
Cu, and Zn in city dust worldwide. This result is not surprising, given that Chile is the
most important producer of Cu, Chilean ores, and concentrates, acting as a plentiful
source of As, Mo, and to a lesser extent Zn. Mining development in Chile continues to be
predominant; for example, La Negra Industrial Complex has grown to 200 ha and 120
companies, including a Cu smelter. Previous studies, such as Ruiz-Rudolph et al. (2016),
show that Chilean communes with this type of facility suffer higher mortality rates.
Although the Antofagasta Port is an important employer in the city, storing Cu
concentrate and polymetallic stockpiles there for long-term periods is not appropriate due
to health concerns. These materials have caused disease in children in the past (Sepu
´lveda,
Vega & Delgado, 2000) and continue to cause elevated concentrations of pollutants in
children’s blood and urine (Vergara, 2015). The results of sampling show that street dust
contains concentrations of dangerous contaminants that are high enough to threaten the
health of people (especially children) living and working in close proximity to Antofagasta
Port. A precautionary measure previously undertaken as of 2010 for some concentrates
stored in Portezuelo is that they have been and are now transported to the Antofagasta
Port by hermetically sealed and cleaned trucks (Chilean Ministry of Transport and
Telecommunications (MTT), 2015). Nonetheless, once stationary in Antofagasta,
concentrates could be displaced by wind that moves preferentially in the SW direction;
hence, special attention must be paid to the dispersion of contaminants from concentrates
and stockpiles to the NE, especially during windy days.
As seen in resuspended dust from Fushun, China, some elements can be highly
accumulated in dust (e.g., Cr 5,334 ± 10,667 mg · kg-1; Kong et al., 2011), especially when
it is from long-term uncleaned surfaces. Antofagasta is located within the world’s driest
desert, and as such, there is a very low probability for rain to remove dusts. Cleaning

 surfaces with wet mops twice a month and frequently washing children’s hands in locations
close to the port are precautionary measures that can be taken on an individual level to
prevent the ingestion of city dust, lowering Pb values in blood (Charney et al., 1983).
As a long-term goal, existing, and prospective developments located in close proximity to
the port should consider the high risk of contamination and develop relevant strategies to
minimize exposure to contaminated dust. Operations within the port itself should be
modified (through regulations, safety guidelines, and practical measures). Additionally, it
will be important for the regional and national governments to invest in suitable health care
(e.g., the training of specialists and development of suitable medical facilities).
The future management and prevention of contamination in Antofagasta could also be
strengthened by the implementation of a local high-quality geochemistry laboratory that
allows for fast, efficient, and accurate measurements of contaminants through the
utilization of specific environmental matrices where pollutant speciation can be efficiently
determined. Considering that the mining industry will continue to be a profitable venture
in Chile that provides jobs and income as other commodities become extensively
exploited in this region (e.g., Li), the implementation and management of a laboratory of
this type is necessary in this growing and highly contaminated city and region.
Finally, it is important to note that the contamination and problems described are
likely not restricted to Antofagasta, or to Chile. Wherever metals are extracted, stored, and
transported, there is a risk that workers and the public can be exposed to contamination
and it is important that this is recognized by all parties. Chile is rapidly moving toward the
status of a developed country, however environmental protection measures have not yet
developed at the same rate as its economy. Industrial regulations must ensure safe levels of
pollutants as is defined in the Constitution of Chile which states that Chilean citizens
“have the right to live in a contamination-free environment” (Gobierno de Chile, 1980).
CONCLUSIONS
Main conclusions related to Antofagasta dust contamination are summarized below while
considering the local geology, health risks, and bioaccessibility of the contaminant elements.
These items are followed by potential short- and long-term recommendations and
considerations that could reduce associated adverse health impacts to Antofagasta residents.
1. Street dust from the city of Antofagasta in northern Chile contains Ba, Co, Cr, Mn,
Ni, and V that likely originate from intrusive, volcanic, metamorphic rocks, dikes, or
soil of the city.
2. Antofagasta city dust is contaminated with As, Cd, Cu, Mo, Pb, and Zn, and
this contamination likely originates from the Antofagasta Port (an anthropogenic
source).
3. The mean concentrations of As (239 mg · kg-1), Cu (10,821 mg · kg-1), and Zn
(11,869 mg · kg-1) are likely the highest in street dust worldwide.
4. Heightened bioaccessibility in Antofagasta dust was found for As, Cu, and Pb,
indicating that comparatively high fractions could be absorbed into the human
bloodstream.
Tapia et al. (2018), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.4699
22/30
 5. The bioaccessibility and hazard indices indicate that As, Cu, and Pb in dust represent a
health risk to children or adults chronically exposed to Antofagasta dust.
Potential recommendations and considerations include:
1. Short term:
○ Discussions with regulators and relevant parties in industry regarding the
significance of the results in relation to the city’s occupants. Prospective
developments and businesses in close proximity to the Antofagasta Port should be
fully aware of the risk of contamination.
○ Houses and children living in close proximity to the Antofagasta Port should be
constantly cleaned to avoid dust ingestion.
2. Long term:
○ Stricter regulations on a national or regional level should be adopted to reduce dust-
borne contamination. Also, businesses, schools, and prospective developments in
close proximity to the port should develop relevant long-term strategies to minimize
exposure to contaminated dust.
○ Polymetallic stockpiles and Cu concentrates should not be kept in the Antofagasta
Port for long-term periods.
○ Investments should be made in medical training and infrastructure to properly
remedy potential health impacts.
○ The implementation of a real-time monitoring program and high-quality
geochemistry laboratory should be considered to improve the quantification of
contaminant elements and their speciation in Antofagasta dust.
