survey to explore how alcohol may
disproportionately impact health in
deprived individuals

Abstract
Background: Internationally, studies show that similar levels of alcohol consumption in deprived communities
(vs. more affluent) result in higher levels of alcohol-related ill health. Hypotheses to explain this alcohol harm
paradox include deprived drinkers: suffering greater combined health challenges (e.g. smoking, obesity) which
exacerbate effects of alcohol harms; exhibiting more harmful consumption patterns (e.g. bingeing); having a
history of more harmful consumption; and disproportionately under-reporting consumption. We use a bespoke
national survey to assess each of these hypotheses.
Methods: A national telephone survey designed to test this alcohol harm paradox was undertaken (May 2013 to April
2014) with English adults (n = 6015). Deprivation was assigned by area of residence. Questions examined factors
including: current and historic drinking patterns; combined health challenges (smoking, diet, exercise and body mass);
and under-reported consumption (enhanced questioning on atypical/special occasion drinking). For each factor,
analyses examined differences between deprived and more affluent individuals controlled for total alcohol
consumption.
Results: Independent of total consumption, deprived drinkers were more likely to smoke, be overweight and report
poor diet and exercise. Consequently, deprived increased risk drinkers (male >168–400 g, female >112–280 g alcohol/
week) were >10 times more likely than non-deprived counterparts to drink in a behavioural syndrome combining
smoking, excess weight and poor diet/exercise. Differences by deprivation were significant but less marked in higher
risk drinkers (male >400 g, female >280 g alcohol/week). Current binge drinking was associated with deprivation
independently of total consumption and a history of bingeing was also associated with deprivation in lower and
increased risk drinkers.
Conclusions: Deprived increased/higher drinkers are more likely than affluent counterparts to consume alcohol as part
of a suite of health challenging behaviours including smoking, excess weight and poor diet/exercise. Together these
can have multiplicative effects on risks of wholly (e.g. alcoholic liver disease) and partly (e.g. cancers) alcohol-related
conditions. More binge drinking in deprived individuals will also increase risks of injury and heart disease despite total
alcohol consumption not differing from affluent counterparts. Public health messages on how smoking, poor diet/
exercise and bingeing escalate health risks associated with alcohol are needed, especially in deprived communities, as
their absence will contribute to health inequalities.

 Background
Alcohol is responsible for 5.1 % of the global burden of
disease and injury (disability adjusted life years) and 3.3 mil-
lion deaths worldwide [1]. Such disease and death re-
sult from over 200 conditions either entirely or partially as-
sociated with alcohol consumption [1]. For most condi-
tions, there is a positive ordinal relationship between
consumption and increased risk [2, 3] with a few conditions
(e.g. ischaemic stroke and heart disease) recording U- and
J-shaped relationships [4–6]. While the latter suggest some
health benefits from low alcohol consumption the validity
and extent of such benefits remain contested [7]. The or-
dinal relationship between alcohol consumption and harm
is also complicated by deprivation. A range of studies iden-
tify that deprived communities suffer substantively greater
alcohol-related morbidity and mortality despite reporting
average alcohol consumption similar to their more affluent
counterparts [8–11]. While greater polarisation (i.e. more
abstainers and more heavy drinkers) in deprived popula-
tions may account for some differences, deprived drinkers
appear to suffer greater harms even after accounting for
ecological confounders [1]. The mechanisms underpinning
this alcohol harm paradox remain unclear. However, a
range of different hypotheses can be postulated.
One plausible explanation is that deprived populations
are exposed to other health challenges (e.g. though poorer
diet and smoking) that interact especially with higher levels
of alcohol consumption to create a multiplicative (i.e. syn-
ergistically harmful) increase in morbidity (combined
health challenges hypotheses). Thus, obesity and higher
levels of regular alcohol consumption interact to in-
crease risks of liver disease mortality to a greater ex-
tent
than
the
sum
of
each
individual
risk
[12].
Equally, alcohol and smoking also show similar inter-
actions associated with, for instance, increased risk of
cancer (e.g. laryngeal [13]).
The next possible explanation postulates that while
total alcohol consumption may be similar in deprived and
more affluent communities there may be epidemiologi-
cally relevant differences in patterns of consumption (e.g.
bingeing) and types of alcohol consumed (drinking pat-
tern hypotheses). Thus, even occasional heavy drinking
sessions (>60 g pure alcohol at least monthly) remove any
benefits from reduced risks of ischaemic heart disease
(IHD) that individuals might otherwise accrue from mod-
erate drinking [14]. Consumption of the same amount of
alcohol but in fewer sessions is also associated with in-
creased risks of injury [3]. However, for liver disease the
relative merits of bingeing rather than consuming the
same amount of alcohol over more days are unclear [15,
16]. Further, types of alcohol consumed may also carry
additional health risks with for instance spirit consump-
tion in some populations having been associated with
greater risks of cirrhosis, IHD and certain cancers [17, 18].
Drinking histories hypotheses propose that deprived
individuals currently drinking similar quantities of alco-
hol have important differences in their historical drink-
ing patterns. Thus, increased risks of alcohol-related
cancers continue in individuals who have adopted ab-
stinence from alcohol for over a decade (oesophageal,
head and neck cancers [19]). The drinking history of
deprived compared to more affluent individuals may dif-
fer both in terms of previously consuming more alcohol
(including through starting drinking at an earlier age) or
consuming greater proportions of total consumption
though heavy or binge drinking sessions.
A final plausible hypothesis is that rather than the
alcohol harm paradox being true, individuals in more
deprived communities may actually drink more than
their affluent counterparts but underestimate actual con-
sumption through forgetting drinking occasions, poor
recall of drinks per drinking session and underestima-
tion of drink size [20–23]. In the UK only around 60 %
of all alcohol sold for consumption is accounted for in
national drinking surveys [24]. However, how underesti-
mation of alcohol consumption varies with deprivation
is poorly understood.
Here we use a national survey (n = 6015) of alcohol
consumption enhanced to measure differences in the
current and historic drinking patterns of poorer and
more affluent drinkers who currently consume similar
total amounts of alcohol. Using results from these ana-
lyses combined with epidemiological information from
other studies we assess which factors may explain the al-
cohol harms paradox.
Methods
Survey inclusion criteria were individuals aged 16 years
or over and resident in England. A target sample size of
6000 was set and telephone interviews were conducted
between May 2013 and April 2014. Sampling used a ran-
dom probability method where English landline numbers
were randomly selected (by a commercial company)
from a national stratified database to allow equal repre-
sentation across all English regions. Regionally stratified
sampling was not possible for mobile phone numbers.
Random Digit Dialing was then used to call phone num-
bers (see Bellis et al., 2015 [24] for full details). For all
calls, respondents’ postcodes were recorded at interview
and converted into lower super output areas (LSOAs;
geographical areas with a population mean of 1500 [25])
of residence. Each respondent was assigned a measure of
deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation 2010; IMD
[26]) based on nationally published IMDs for each
LSOA. IMD combines 38 separate indicators, grouped
into seven domains (income, employment, health, educa-
tion, crime, access to services and living environment) to
create a single measure of deprivation. All data sets used
Bellis et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:111 
Page 2 of 10
 in the compilation of the IMD have been subject to
quality assurance and the methodology used to create
the index independently reviewed [27]. IMD and other
ecological measures of deprivation have previously been
used to identify socio-demographic variations in alcohol
harms across England [8]. For the purpose of examining
differences between deprived and more affluent popula-
tions, IMDs were dichotomised into those in the poorest
two quintiles (deprived) nationally and those in the other
three (non-deprived; Table 1).
Phone numbers were called up to seven times (Monday,
Wednesday, Friday, 9.30 am to 5.30 pm; Tuesday, Thurs-
day, 9.30 am to 9.00 pm; Saturday, 10.00 am to 4.00 pm
Saturday). Any no answers, call back requests or answer
machines were called until a respondent either agreed or
declined to participate or the study end date was reached.
A total of 97,805 calls were made of which 71,621 resulted
in a discontinued phone line, a contact (e.g. business
premises) that was not within the sampling frame or a no
answer and subsequent follow up of up to seven repeat
calls to the same number. Of those individuals contacted
6092 agreed and 20,092 refused to participate in the study
(i.e. a response rate of 23.3 %). For this study, data were
limited to 6015 individuals aged 18 years or above who
provided full demographic and current alcohol consump-
tion data.
Respondents were asked their age, sex and ethnicity
(according to Office of National Statistics categories
[28]). Due to small numbers in some ethnicities, ethnic
categories were reduced to White, Asian/Chinese, and
Black/other/preferred not to say (see Table 1 for more
details). Individuals were classified as current alcohol
consumers (drank in the last 12 months) or abstainers
(grouped into those who had never drank and those who
had quit). For current drinkers, typical alcohol consump-
tion was determined using a question on typical fre-
quency of alcohol consumption combined with detailed
questions on types, locations and quantities of alcohol
consumed on typical drinking days [24]. Consumers
were categorised according to weekly drinking levels
consistent with those used by national statistics (UK
units, where 1 unit is approximately 8 g of pure alcohol;
categories – minimal, male and female, >0–1 unit; lower
risk, male >1–21, female >1–14 units; increased risk,
male >21–50, female >14–35 units; higher risk, male
>50, female >35 units [29]). Hypotheses were tested in
three groupings: combined health challenges (interactions
between alcohol consumption and other health challen-
ging behaviours); current drinking patterns (measures of
bingeing, types of alcohol consumed and unreported alco-
hol consumption) and drinking histories (age of initiation
of drinking and drunkenness and history of frequent and
drunkenness/binge drinking).
Combined health challenges were explored using dichot-
omised variables: current smoker (daily or occasional); poor
diet (averaging ≤1 portion of fruit or vegetables per day);
typically low exercise (<1 exercise session long enough to
work up a sweat or get out of breath per week); overweight
(self-reported height and weight equating to Body Mass
Index >25). Current drinking pattern hypotheses were
tested by examining the types of alcohol consumed on
typical drinking occasions (categories: wine, beer/cider,

 spirits) with individuals being able to select more than one
type. A derived variable was created as a proxy for typically
binge drinking (versus distributed drinking patterns). Thus,
total annual consumption was divided by drinking fre-
quency and males averaging >8 units and females >6 units
per drinking session were classified as binge drinkers [30].
A final variable used for assessing drinking pattern mea-
sured missing or typically unreported alcohol consumption.
Thus, the survey tool also collected information on atypical
or special occasion drinking not usually collected in typical
drinking surveys [24]. Individuals were divided into those
whose atypical/special occasion drinking did and did not
add ≥5 units (i.e. ≥40 g of pure alcohol) to their weekly
consumption.
Drinking history hypotheses were tested by questions
addressing age at which individuals first started to drink
regularly (defined as at least once or twice a month) and
age at which they first drank enough to feel drunk (de-
fined as slurred speech or unsteady on feet). Both vari-
ables were dichotomised to identify individuals reporting
the drinking behaviour before 18 years of age. Finally,
two sets of questions asked individuals their frequency
of drinking and frequency of drunkenness/bingeing
(defined as 5+ drinks in a session) when aged 18 and
30 years. Here, for individuals aged ≥35 years only, vari-
ables were dichotomised to identify those who reported
drinking most days of the week (four or more) when
aged both 18 and 30 years and also into those who re-
ported being drunk/bingeing at least monthly when aged
both 18 and 30 years.
The survey was piloted on 840 individuals between No-
vember 2012 and February 2013 and minor changes were
made to the wording of questions and prompts provided
by surveyors in order to improve clarity for respondents.
Responses were recorded in a computer-assisted tele-
phone interview system with data then transferred to
SPSS v21 for analysis. Chi-squared analyses are used to
examine relationships between alcohol harm paradox
variables (i.e. combined health challenges, drinking
patterns
and
drinking
history
variables)
and
deprivation within groups consuming similar quantities of
alcohol. T tests are used to compare means and binary lo-
gistic regression is employed to control for demographic
confounders and additionally explore how each alcohol
harm paradox variable is associated with interactions be-
tween deprivation and alcohol consumption.
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from Liverpool
John Moores University’s Research Ethics Committee. The
voluntary and anonymous nature of the study was explained
to all participants as part of obtaining informed consent.
Results
Table 1 provides the overall demographics and typical
drinking categories of survey participants. Typical drinking
differed between deprived and non-deprived respondents,
with lower and increased risk drinking more common in
non-deprived individuals and minimal, never and ex-
drinkers associated with deprivation. Significant differences
were also apparent by age, sex and ethnicity with, for ex-
ample, males typically drinking more heavily than females
(Table 1). Within alcohol consumption categories, there
were no significant differences in mean units consumed per
week by deprivation.
Table 2 examines differences in alcohol harm paradox
hypothesis variables between deprived and non-deprived
individuals who consume similar amounts of alcohol. In
all consumption categories except never drank, individ-
uals in the deprived group are more likely to smoke. The
difference is most marked in increased risk and higher
risk consumption categories where smoking prevalence
in both is 2.4 times higher in deprived individuals. A
similar pattern is also shown with fruit and vegetable
consumption. Differences in exercise between deprived
and non-deprived individuals by alcohol consumption
category were less marked; although low levels of exer-
cise were still more frequent in deprived minimal and
higher risk drinkers (versus non-deprived drinkers in the
same categories). Deprived individuals were more likely
to be overweight in all consumption categories except
higher risk and never drinkers.
Deprived lower and increased risk drinkers were more
likely to be binge drinkers than their non-deprived coun-
terparts (Table 2). Further, deprived drinkers were less
likely to typically consume wine across all drinker categor-
ies. Overall, deprived individuals were more likely to typic-
ally consume spirits and beer/cider (Tables 2 and 3).
However, disproportionate increases were only significant
for beer/cider in increased risk drinkers (Table 3). There
were no significant differences by deprivation in under-
reporting of alcohol consumption in any individual drink-
ing category (Table 2). Overall however, under-reporting
was
marginally
higher
in
non-deprived
individuals
(Table 3). Finally, for drinking histories, deprivation was
associated with regularly drinking under 18 years of age in
lower risk drinkers only. No consumption category
showed differences in age when first drunk by deprivation.
Deprivation was only marginally associated with having a
history of frequent drinking in increased risk drinkers
(Table 2). However, a history of drunkenness/bingeing was
higher in deprived lower and especially increased risk
drinkers compared to their non-deprived counterparts.
Table 3 provides results from logistic regression ana-
lyses. Results are presented for the independent relation-
ship between each alcohol harm paradox variable and
deprivation alone as well as for the interaction between
deprivation and current drinking status. The latter is
included to examine if the distribution of, for instance,
current smoking differs significantly between deprived

category. For combined health challenges, current smok-
ing, poor diet, low exercise and being overweight are all
strongly linked with deprivation (Table 3). Taking the
interaction between deprivation and current drinking be-
haviours into account, however, current smoking is dis-
proportionately elevated in deprived drinkers who are
increased and higher risk drinkers (compared with eleva-
tions in minimal drinkers). Although similar associations
were apparent for diet they just failed to reach significance
(Table 3).
For current drinking patterns, typically consuming
spirits and beer/cider and not typically consuming wine
are also associated with deprivation (Table 3). The nega-
tive relationship between typically consuming wine and
deprivation is proportionally greater across all consump-
tion categories (compared with minimal drinkers). While
overall more deprived individuals typically consumed
spirits, this effect did not vary with
consumption
category (Table 3). The overall effect of more typical
consumption of beer/cider in deprived individuals was
significantly elevated in increased risk alcohol consumers
(Table 3). Higher identification of underreporting alco-
hol consumption (≥5 units/week) was marginally associ-
ated with more affluence overall but with no variation
by drinking category. Bingeing was associated overall

Age, sex, alcohol consumption risk category (alone) and ethnicity were all also included in the logistic regression model. However, for reasons of space only the
key variables deprivation and the deprivation interaction with alcohol consumption risk category are shown. aMinimal is the reference category for interactions
between deprivation and alcohol consumption. bP values shown refer to the significance of the overall contribution of the interactive term (Alcohol Consumption
Risk Category*Deprivation) to the model. cFrequent drinking and drunken/bingeing histories are limited to individuals aged 35 years or more at interview (See
Methods for more details). For deprivation alone AORs (Adjusted Odds Ratios) use non-deprived as the reference category. 95 % CI = 95 % Confidence Intervals.

 with deprivation but this relationship was also not modi-
fied by its interaction with any consumption category
(Table 3). Finally, for drinking history variables there
were no direct associations with overall deprivation.
However, a history of drunkenness /bingeing (based on
point estimates at 18 and 30 years of age) was associated
with deprivation in lower and increased risk alcohol con-
sumers (Table 3).
With a substantial number of combined health chal-
lenges variables linked to deprivation the potential cumu-
lative impact of these is further explored. Using a derived
variable unhealthy lifestyle (calculated as having either low
levels of exercise or poor diet) along with the variables
current smoking and excess weight, the cumulative health
challenges in deprived and non-deprived increased risk
drinkers (Fig. 1a) and higher risk drinkers (Fig. 1b) were
compared. Among increased risk drinkers, two thirds
(66.9 %) of non-deprived respondents have at least one
other health challenge (current smoking, excess weight,
unhealthy lifestyle), compared with 83.2 % of those living
in deprived areas. Less than 1 % of non-deprived increased
risk drinkers have all three health challenges increasing to
nearly 9 % of their deprived counterparts. Further, among
those increased risk drinkers with at least one other health
challenge (Fig. 1a, greyed area), 37.3 % in the non-deprived
group binge drink compared with 56.7 % in the deprived
group (X2 = 14.605, P < 0.001). Differences in the distribu-
tion of combined health challenges (between deprived and
non-deprived groups) were similar but less marked in
higher risk drinkers. However, differences in binge drinking
levels (by deprivation) amongst those with least one other
health challenge (Fig. 1b, greyed area) were not significant
(94.34 vs. 90.69 %, X2 = 0.550, P = 0.458).
Discussion
Both in the UK and internationally, similar alcohol
consumption levels have been associated with greater
impacts on the health of more deprived individuals. In
a systematic review of socio-economic differences in
alcohol-attributable mortality Probst et al. suggest that
the poorer diet of individuals living in deprivation (e.g.
more high fat and salt foods and less fruit and vege-
table consumption) may interact with alcohol consump-
tion to alter protein and vitamin absorption and increase
risks of health harms [31]. They also acknowledge that
interactions between higher smoking prevalence in de-
prived areas and alcohol consumption may contribute to
an increased risk of some cancers. Moreover, they suggest
that poorer access to primary care may contribute to
greater harms from alcohol in deprived groups. Conse-
quently, individuals with lower socio-economic status may
face cost, transport, availability and stigma-related issues
that restrict their access to services which might help with
alcohol-
related
problems
[31–33].
Along
with
an
increasing literature describing the disproportionate im-
pact of alcohol on more deprived communities advocacy
to address such health inequalities is also developing at
national and international levels [34]. Generally, however,
alcohol consumption surveys typically do not collect suffi-
cient current and historic data to test competing explana-
tions for this alcohol harm paradox. Consequently, using a
bespoke national survey we have examined how combined
health challenges, current drinking patterns and historical
drinking behaviours differed with deprivation between
individuals who currently consume similar quantities of
alcohol.
Results confirm strong associations between drinking
and
smoking

 disproportionate concentration of smokers in increased
and higher risk alcohol consumers from deprived com-
munities (Table 3). In addition such deprived individuals
are more likely to be overweight and have unhealthier
lifestyles. Consideration of alcohol-related health harms
often focuses on higher risk drinkers and results here
suggest such individuals (males >50 units or 400 g of
pure alcohol/week; females >35 units or 280 g of pure al-
cohol/week) in deprived communities face combined
health challenges likely to have a multiplicative impact
on health. Such impacts include increased risks of condi-
tions specifically associated with alcohol (e.g. alcohol-
related liver disease) and those where alcohol is one of
many multifactorial causes (e.g. oesophageal cancer,
breast cancer, hypertension and macular degeneration)
[3, 35–37]. Arguably, less attention is paid to increased
risk drinkers (here males >21–50 units or >168–400 g of
pure alcohol/week; females >15–35 units, >112–280 g of
pure alcohol/week). However, across England 18 % of
men and 13 % of women report drinking at increased risk
levels (vs. 5 and 3 % at higher risk levels respectively)
[29] and the contribution of increased and even lower
risk drinkers to overall harms is substantive. For instance
only around a fifth of alcohol-related breast cancer
deaths are in women drinking ≥35 units (≥280 g of pure
alcohol) a day with the rest in those drinking at lower
consumption levels (England [38]). For many conditions
multiplicative impacts are still relatively poorly defined.
However, the combined risk from smoking with alcohol
consumption may be more than double that expected
from the summed risks from smoking and alcohol in the
absence of synergies [39]. In this study increased risk
drinkers in deprived communities were 10.9 times more
likely to carry the additional burden of not just smoking
but also unhealthy lifestyle and excess weight (Fig. 1).
As well as combined health challenges, results suggest
that individuals in deprived groups may differ from
those in non-deprived groups (with similar current total
weekly alcohol consumption) in their choice of alcohol
types and both current binge and historical binge drink-
ing (Tables 2 and 3). Deprived drinkers are less likely to
typically consume wine and more likely to consume beer
or spirits (Table 3). Following extensive debate over the
Mediterranean diet and relative benefits of wine con-
sumption compared with other alcoholic drinks [40],
more recent epidemiological analyses appear to offer
some support for health challenges differing by drink
type [41–44]. Further, we found individuals from de-
prived groups also appear to consume alcohol in fewer
but heavier drinking sessions (Tables 2 and 3). Moreover,
based on retrospective estimates of frequency of heavy
drinking (at ages 18 and 30 years) deprived individuals are
also more likely to have previously been drunk/bingeing,
although differences from more affluent individuals are
limited mainly to lower and increased risk drinkers
(Tables 2 and 3). Consuming similar amounts of alcohol
in fewer sessions increases risks of alcohol-related injuries
(including unintentional and violent [35, 45]) and critically
can also eradicate any potential protection moderate
drinking might offer from IHD. Consequently, higher
bingeing in deprived groups (both historically and cur-
rently) is consistent with these populations suffering more
injury and IHD than more affluent drinkers despite
current total alcohol consumption being the same. The
long-term impact of a history of more frequent binge drink-
ing is still poorly understood but any impact on life-time
risks of IHD, cancers or other alcohol-related conditions is
likely to be exacerbated by ex-drinkers (but not never
drinkers) in deprived communities continuing to carry
higher combined health challenges (smoking, poor diet and
excess weight; Table 2) than ex-drinkers from more affluent
groups.
There are a number of important limitations to this
study. Response rate was 23.3 % and we cannot quantify
any bias introduced by differences between individuals
who agreed or declined to participate. We could not dis-
tinguish unoccupied properties from those where indi-
viduals chose not to answer their phones. Individuals
who chose not to answer calls also represent a potential
source of bias in the final sample which we cannot
quantity. Typical response rates for telephone surveys
are declining with one major US provider tracking falls
from 28 % compliance in 2000 to rates well below those
achieved here (i.e. around 9 %) in 2012 [46] Conse-
quently, while response related bias remains a potential
confounder, compliance here is well within the range ex-
perienced elsewhere. Inevitably alcohol harm paradox
variables were proxy measures. Thus, our history of
drunkenness/bingeing and of frequent drinking was lim-
ited to retrospective measures for ages 18 and 30 years.
We cannot establish how well they correlate with all
consumption over this 12 year period or any other
period in respondents’ drinking histories and how any
recall error may have impacted results. Accuracy of re-
call is also a potential issue for age at which regular
drinking began and age when first drunk. Our measure
of deprivation was ecological and relied on assigning in-
dividuals an average level of deprivation according to
their area of residence. This methodology has the benefit
of using a composite of multiple quality-assured mea-
sures of deprivation. However, ecological categorisation
inevitably means individuals with different personal
deprivation characteristics can be classified within the
same category. Such classification may have hidden sig-
nificant relationships between deprivation and some of
the main variables of interest. Consideration of question-
naire length and compliance precluded us incorporating
a comprehensive set of deprivation measures in this
Bellis et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:111 
Page 8 of 10
 survey. However, future studies of the alcohol harm para-
dox would benefit from examining both individual and
ecological measures. We also used a measure of atypical/
special occasion drinking to identify unreported alcohol
consumption. However, deprived and non-deprived indi-
viduals may have differed in recall of these occasions or
assessed sizes and strengths of drinks differently [22]. Fi-
nally, we could not assess some alternative hypotheses for
the alcohol harm paradox. Other competing theories
include: individuals who become ill as a result of alcohol
being drawn into more deprived communities through
long-term disability and unemployment; genetic predis-
position to suffering harms from alcohol in deprived popu-
lations; lower survey completion rates amongst heavy
drinkers in poorer areas; and poorer access to and use of
health and social support systems in deprived communities
resulting in later or less treatment and support to avoid or
tackle alcohol-related ill health [1, 9, 10].
Conclusions
Continued
alcohol
consumption
creates
long-term
stresses on the body’s immunological, neurological and
hormonal systems. For alcohol consumers, individuals’
ability to achieve and maintain good health is inevitably
compromised by other challenges such as excess weight,
smoking and poor diet and exercise regimes. Extreme
peaks in alcohol consumption appear to further reduce
individuals’ resistance to IHD and increase short-term
harms from injury. This study has identified both com-
bined health challenges and current and historic binge
drinking as factors associated with deprivation even
when considering individuals who currently consume
similar amounts of alcohol. While causality could not be
identified such findings suggest at least that harms from al-
cohol consumption should not be viewed in isolation but
seen as associated with a public health pattern or syn-
drome of health challenging behaviours disproportionately
impacting deprived communities. Consequently, findings
here combined with those reported elsewhere [31, 36] in-
dicate national guidance on safer drinker levels should
routinely inform individuals that those who smoke, are
overweight or live unhealthy lifestyles may suffer greater
harms from similar levels of alcohol consumption. Given
such drinkers are more likely to reside in deprived com-
munities the current absence of such information may
contribute to health inequalities [8]. On a global basis al-
cohol industries are increasingly targeting developing
countries for growth in alcohol markets [47]. Such coun-
tries often have high tobacco use [48], high levels of binge
drinking [1] and generally poorer levels of health com-
bined sometimes with high endemic levels of violence and
injury [49] and low levels of health and social service sup-
port. To date consideration of the alcohol harm paradox
has focused primarily on the disproportionate impacts of
alcohol consumption on deprived individuals within more
affluent countries. However, a better understanding of its
broader implications to low and middle income countries
is urgently needed as the health costs of increasing global
alcohol consumption may be considerably higher than es-
timates from more affluent populations suggest.
