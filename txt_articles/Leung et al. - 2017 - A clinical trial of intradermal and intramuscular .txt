Background: Antibody responses to the inactivated seasonal
influenza vaccine in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) have
not been carefully characterized.
Objective: The primary objective of this study was to compare
antibody responses to intradermal vaccination in participants
with moderate/severe AD with those in nonatopic participants.
Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of route of
administration, Staphylococcus aureus skin colonization, and
disease severity on vaccine response.
Methods: This was an open-label study conducted in the
2012-2013 influenza season at 5 US clinical sites. A total of 360
participants with moderate/severe AD or nonatopic subjects
were assessed for eligibility, 347 of whom received intradermal
or intramuscular vaccination per label and were followed for
28 days after vaccination. The primary outcome was the
difference in the proportion of participants achieving
seroprotection (hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer
>
_1:40 on day 28 after vaccination).
Results: Seroprotection rates for influenza B, H1N1, and H3N2
were not different (1) between participants with AD and nonatopic
participantsreceivingintradermalvaccinationand(2)betweenAD
participantsreceiving intradermal andintramuscular vaccination.
After intradermal, but not intramuscular, vaccination,
participants with AD with S aureus colonization experienced (1)
lower seroprotection and seroconversion rates and lower
hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer geometric mean fold
increase against influenza B and (2) lower seroconversion rates
against influenza H1N1 than noncolonized participants with AD.
Conclusion: Participants with AD colonized with S aureus
exhibited a reduced immune response to influenza vaccination
compared with noncolonized participants after intradermal but
not intramuscular vaccination. Because most patients with AD
are colonized with S aureus, intramuscular influenza
vaccination should be given preference in these patients. (J
Allergy Clin Immunol 2017;139:1575-82.)

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic skin disease,
affecting more than 15% of children and persisting into adulthood in
half of these patients.1,2 Patients with AD have a unique predisposi-
tion to infection by Staphylococcus aureus and herpes simplex vi-
rus.3-6 The National Institutes of Health/National Institute of

ing cutaneous and systemic immunity in patients with AD and to
identify biomarkers that characterize groups of patients with AD
with and without a history of staphylococcal colonization, history
of eczema herpeticum, or both.
Intradermal vaccination in normal skin is more immunogenic
than intramuscular vaccination.7-9 The current knowledge of

antibody responses to intradermal administration of antigens in
patients with AD is unknown, but more than 6 million doses of
intradermal seasonal influenza vaccine (personal communication,
Dr M. Decker, Sanofi Pasteur) have been administered since it
was licensed in the United States in 2011.10
In the current study the primary analysis compared the
antibody responses to intradermal vaccination against influenza
strains B, H1N1, and H3N2 in patients with AD compared with
those in nonatopic participants. As secondary analyses, we also
compared the antibody responses of participants with moderate/
severe
AD
receiving
intradermal
versus
intramuscular
vaccination, antibody responses in participants with AD with
and without Staphylococcus aureus skin colonization (SASC),
sex, and race.
METHODS
Participants aged 18 to 64 years received open-label vaccination at 5
centers (National Jewish Health [NJH], University of Rochester, Oregon
Health & Science University, Boston Children’s Hospital, and Northwestern
University) on approval from their institutional review boards. Participants
with AD had active moderate/severe skin lesions per the Rajka-Langeland
Severity Score.11 Nonatopic participants had no personal or first-degree family
history of AD, asthma, allergic rhinitis, or food allergy. See the Methods
section and Table E1 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.
org for inclusion/exclusion criteria and classification method of race and
ethnicity.
Participants with moderate/severe AD (hereafter referred to as AD) were
randomized 1:1 to receive intradermal or intramuscular administration of the
2012-2013 seasonal influenza vaccine.12 At NJH, nonatopic participants were
randomized 3:2 to intradermal or intramuscular vaccination until 23
participants received intramuscular vaccination. Thereafter, the remaining
nonatopic participants at NJH received intradermal vaccination. All nonatopic
participants at the remaining centers received intradermal vaccination. The 23
nonatopic participants receiving intramuscular vaccination served as a
reference
group
for
exploratory
analyses
(Fig
1).
Stratified
block
randomization was used to balance sex and AD severity between vaccination
routes by clinical site.
Hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody titers and influenza B–spe-
cific IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgA by means of ELISA were measured before
vaccination and 28 6 7 days after vaccination. IgE and IgG antibodies specific
for toxic shock staph glococol 1 (TSST-1) and staphylococcal enterotoxin B
(SEB), total IgE levels, and complete blood counts were measured before
vaccination. Prior measurements of total IgE levels and complete blood counts
obtained within 30 days of vaccination were used, if available.
S aureus cultures of skin swabs had been obtained previously in nonatopic
participants and participants with AD as part of the ADRN Registry. In
participants with AD, skin swabs were collected from the participant’s most
severe AD lesion and also from adjacent nonlesional skin. Methodologies of
S aureus culture and laboratory assays are presented in the Methods section
in this article’s Online Repository. Sensitivity analyses involving SASC
were also performed for 2 subgroups: (1) including only participants who
had an S aureus culture within 30 days of the vaccination date or (2) including
only participants with moderate disease.
For each of the 3 influenza strains, the primary outcome was the proportion
of participants achieving seroprotection (HAI antibody titer >
_ 1:40 on day 28
after vaccination). Secondary outcomes included the geometric mean fold
increase (GMFI) in HAI antibody titers from baseline to day 28 after
vaccination and the proportion of participants experiencing seroconversion
(>
_4-fold increase in baseline HAI antibody titers on day 28 after vaccination).
Participants with baseline HAI titers of 1:40 or greater for a particular strain
were excluded from the analyses for that particular strain, and counts of those
not seroprotected at baseline per strain are included in Fig 1.
Demographics and baseline characteristics were compared by using the
Fisher exact test for categorical measures and the Wilcoxon 2-sample test for
continuous measures. Binary rates are presented as proportions and exact 95%
CIs, and comparisons are summarized by using odds ratios (ORs) and the
Fisher exact test. Continuous variables were summarized with unadjusted
geometric means and 95% CIs. Robust regression models using M-estimation
were used to analyze continuous outcomes of log2 HAI titer fold increase and
log10 influenza B-specific IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgA levels. Geometric mean
ratios (GMRs) were defined as the ratio of geometric means of one group to the
other. Multiple imputation methodology was used for influenza B–specific
IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgA levels outside the limits of quantification. Baseline
log10 IgE and IgG antibodies specific for TSST-1 and SEB were analyzed by
using left-censored Tobit regression models. All continuous models adjust for
age and sex. The individual effects of SASC and disease severity were
analyzed by using an Rn
2 test13 from a similar robust regression model, as
described above, that included both SASC and disease severity as covariates.
Sample size calculations were based on H3N2 data from our previous
ADRN Influenza Vaccine Pilot Study (NCT01518478)14 with the intradermal
2011-2012 seasonal influenza vaccine,15 in which 57% and 85% of
participants with AD and nonatopic participants, respectively, achieved
seroprotection after vaccination. Because no adjustments were made for
multiple comparisons among groups or endpoints, all P values reported are
descriptive/hypothesis generating except for the (inferential) P value testing
H3N2 seroprotection of participants with AD vs nonatopic participants among
those given intradermal vaccination.
By using the Fisher exact test and assuming a 2-sided significance level of
.05, a sample size of at least 62 nonatopic participants and 62 participants with
AD who were not seroprotected at baseline was necessary to detect a 28%
difference in seroprotection rates between participants with AD and nonatopic
participants receiving intradermal vaccination with at least 90% power. For
secondary objective analyses, we similarly chose a sample size of at least 62
participants with
AD without
seroprotection
at
baseline to
receive
intramuscular vaccination.
RESULTS
Demographics and baseline characteristics
Of 360 candidates screened, 347 were enrolled and vaccinated,
and 336 were evaluable in the per-protocol analysis (participants
with AD receiving intradermal vaccine, 100; participants with
AD receiving intramuscular vaccine, 102; nonatopic participants
receiving intradermal vaccine, 111; and nonatopic participants
receiving intramuscular vaccine, 23; Fig 1). A total of 136 (43%)
of the 313 participants in the 3 main study groups (participants
with AD receiving intradermal vaccine, participants with AD
receiving intramuscular vaccine, and nonatopic participants
receiving intradermal vaccine) were enrolled and vaccinated at
NJH. The proportions of the 3 main study groups enrolled at
each site were similar across all sites, except Boston Children’s
Hospital,
where
nonatopic
participants
given
intradermal
vaccination comprised 65% of its enrollment. Among participants
receiving intradermal vaccination, the age of the nonatopic group
was higher than that of the AD group (Table I). The AD group

 given intradermal vaccination was not different in sex, race, and
ethnicity to either the AD group given intramuscular or the
nonatopic
group
given
intradermal
vaccination.
Among
recipients of intradermal vaccination, the nonatopic participant
group had lower total IgE levels, eosinophil counts, and
proportions of SASC than the AD group. These 3 characteristics
were similar between both participants with AD receiving
intradermal and those receiving intramuscular vaccination.
Baseline severity measures of AD, such as the Eczema Area
and Severity Index and the Rajka-Langeland Severity Score, were
similar in participants given intradermal and intramuscular
vaccination.
Baseline seroprotection rates were similar between the AD and
nonatopic groups for each influenza strain; however, baseline
seroprotection rates were low for influenza B compared with
H1N1 or H3N2 (see Fig E1 in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jacionline.org).
Comparative antibody responses of nonatopic
participants and participants with AD after
intradermal vaccination
There were no differences in seroprotection, seroconversion,
or HAI titer GMFI after intradermal vaccination for either
influenza B, H1N1, or H3N2 between the nonatopic participants
and participants with AD overall (Table II).
Comparative antibody responses of participants
with AD after intradermal or intramuscular
vaccination
Seroprotection and seroconversion rates and HAI titer GMFIs
at day 28 were similar in participants with AD who received
intradermal or intramuscular vaccination for each of the 3 strains
(Table II).
Methotrexate (not allowed during the study)
The per protocol population includes participants who 1) received a full dose of vaccine, 2) provided serum samples
at baseline and day 28, 3) met eligibility criteria, 4) received no prohibited medications, and 5) had no major protocol
deviations.

 Comparative antibody responses of nonatopic
participants after intradermal and intramuscular
vaccination
As an exploratory analysis, the seroprotection rates of
nonatopic participants were similar between those given intra-
dermal vaccination and those given intramuscular vaccination
(Table II).
Effect of S aureus skin colonization on antibody
responses to vaccination
Results of S aureus cultures of skin swabs were available in 334
(99%) of 336 participants; cultures were collected up to 477 days
before vaccination (mean, 143 days) in 330 (99%) of 334 partic-
ipants and after vaccination (mean, 37 days) in 4 (1%) of 334 par-
ticipants. Cultures for 120 (36%) participants were collected
within 30 days of vaccination, with cultures for 70 participants
collected the same day as vaccination. Overall, 42% of partici-
pants with AD were colonized (Table I). Among all participants
with AD who were not seroprotected at baseline separately for
influenza B, H1N1, and H3N2, the rates of SASC were 41%,
44%, and 41%, respectively. Participants with AD and SASC
were divided evenly between intradermal and intramuscular
vaccines.
Baseline TSST-1–specific and SEB-specific IgE and IgG
antibodies were higher in participants with AD with SASC
compared with participants with AD without SASC (see Fig E2
in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Also,
participants with AD without SASC had higher baseline TSST-1
and SEB antibody levels than nonatopic participants without
SASC.
Comparative antibody responses to intradermal
vaccination
The rate of seroprotection to influenza B in participants with
AD with SASC was lower than in participants with AD without
SASC (11% vs 47%; OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.03-0.49; P < .001;
Fig 2). The difference in the rate of seroprotection to influenza
B persisted when including only participants with moderate AD
(6% vs 51%; OR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.00-0.50; P 5 .002) or when
including only participants with S aureus cultures of skin swabs
collected within 30 days of vaccination (0% vs 57%; OR, 0.00;
95% CI, 0.00-0.40; P 5 .004).
Additionally, there was a trend among participants with AD
toward a lower H1N1 strain seroprotection rate in those with
SASC compared with those without (74% vs 91%; OR, 0.27; 95%
CI, 0.04-1.37; P 5 .09).
Among participants with AD, the rate of seroconversion
to influenza B and the rate of seroconversion to H1N1 in
participants with SASC were also lower than those without
SASC (19% vs 52%; OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07-0.64; P 5.002 and
74% vs 94%; OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.02-1.06; P 5.03, respectively;
Fig 2), which persisted for influenza B when including only par-
ticipants with moderate AD (25% vs 55%; OR, 0.27; 95% CI,
0.06-1.08; P 5 .05) or when including only participants with
skin swabs collected within 30 days of vaccination (11% vs
65%; OR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.00-0.70; P 5 .02).
Participants with AD and SASC had lower HAI titer GMFIs
against influenza B compared with participants with AD without
SASC (GMR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.34-0.74; P <.001; see Fig E3 in this
article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org), which
persisted when including only participants with AD (GMR,
0.52; 95% CI, 0.31-0.89; P 5 .02) or when including only

 participants with skin swabs collected within 30 days of
vaccination (GMR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17-0.88; P 5 .02).
Although the HAI titer GMFI against influenza B was
influenced by the presence of SASC, it was not influenced by
the
level
of
AD
severity
among
intradermal
vaccinees.
When considering both SASC status and AD severity as
covariates in a robust regression model including intradermally
vaccinated participants with AD, there were no pairwise
differences in HAI titer GMFIs against influenza B between
severity levels and only marginal evidence of an overall effect of
severity (P 5 .07). However, there was evidence of an overall
effect of SASC status on HAI titer GMFIs against influenza B
(P 5 .01).
In post hoc analyses, among participants without SASC
receiving intradermal vaccination, the seroprotection rates were
lower in nonatopic participants than in participants with AD for
influenza B (23% vs 47%; OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16-0.72;
P 5 .003), and the seroconversion rate for the B strain was also
lower in nonatopic participants than in participants with AD
(31% vs 52%; OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20-0.85; P 5 .01; Fig 2).
Comparative antibody responses to intramuscular
vaccination
Among participants with AD receiving intramuscular vacci-
nation, SASC status did not affect either the seroprotection rate or
the seroconversion rate to any of the 3 strains (Fig 2). There was a
trend, among participants with AD vaccinated intramuscularly,
toward a lower HAI titer GMFI against influenza H3N2 in

 Comparison of antibody responses between
intradermal and intramuscular vaccination in
participants with AD and without SASC
In a post hoc analysis there were no differences between
responses to intradermal and intramuscular vaccinations among
participants with AD without SASC (Fig 2 and see Fig E3).
Effect of S aureus skin colonization status on
influenza B–specific IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgA
responses to intradermal vaccination among
participants with AD
There were no differences in baseline IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgA
titers to influenza B between participants with AD with and
without SASC (data not shown). Participants with AD and
SASC had lower day 28 IgG1 responses to influenza B than
participants with AD without SASC (GMR, 0.82; 95% CI,
0.69-0.97; P 5 .02), whereas there were no such differences in
day 28 IgG2, IgG3, or IgA responses to influenza B (see Figs E4
and E5 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.
org). There were no differences in day 28 IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or
IgA responses to influenza B between intradermal and intramus-
cular vaccination among participants with AD with SASC.
Comparison of antibody response by sex and race
There were no differences in seroconversion, seroprotection, or
HAI titer GMFIs to any vaccine strain between male and female
participants or between white and black or African American
participants within the groups of participants with AD or
nonatopic participants, regardless of vaccination route (data not
shown).
Safety summary
A total of 4 adverse events, 2 nonserious and 2 serious and
requiring hospitalization, were reported among 3 subjects. All
adverse events were grade 3, resolved without sequelae, and
deemed not related to the vaccination. One participant with AD
receiving intramuscular vaccination experienced simultaneous
vomiting and diarrhea 6 days after vaccination, 1 participant with
AD receiving intradermal vaccination was hospitalized for an
asthma exacerbation 6 days after vaccination, and 1 nonatopic
participant receiving intradermal vaccination was hospitalized for
a skin infection.
DISCUSSION
The current study is the first immunologic examination of
intradermal vaccination against influenza in patients with AD.
Seroprotection and seroconversion rates were not different overall
between participants with AD and nonatopic control subjects
receiving intradermal vaccination for any of the 3 influenza strains
(B, H1N1, and H3N2). In contrast, after intradermal vaccination in
participants with AD, compared with those without SASC,
participants with SASC experienced (1) lower seroprotection and
seroconversion rates and lower HAI titer GMFIs against influenza
B and (2) lower seroconversion rates against influenza H1N1.
However, among participants with AD with SASC, the response
rate is higher among those receiving intramuscular vaccination
than those receiving intradermal vaccination.
Most differences were seen in response to influenza B. This
result is probably due to a new B strain in the vaccine and low
immunogenicity of the B strain.16,17 The low immunogenicity of
the B strain is an important handicap of inactivated influenza
vaccines because recent studies show that the B strain is not
less pathogenic than the A strain.18
The antibody response to influenza vaccines is mainly found
within the IgG1 antibody subclass.19 Therefore we analyzed IgG1,
IgG2, IgG3, and IgA antibody responses to influenza. Our finding
that IgG1 antibody responses after intradermal vaccination were
reduced in participants with AD with SASC provided further
support for a deficient cutaneous vaccination response in
participants with AD with SASC (see Fig E4).
It is not known whether SASC is simply a biomarker for
reduced immune responses to intradermal vaccination or whether
S aureus directly inhibits immune responses to intradermal
vaccination in participants with AD. We considered the
possibility that this association of diminished intradermal vaccine
response because of S aureus colonization was related to AD
severity. However, when we controlled for the severity of skin
disease, SASC remained strongly associated with reduced
intradermal vaccine response to influenza vaccination. Previous
studies have demonstrated that staphylococcal superantigenic
toxins deplete dendritic cells from the skin by inducing migration
of cutaneous antigen-presenting cells to the draining lymph
nodes.20 Furthermore, it is known that S aureus products, such
as staphylococcal protein A, have subversive effects on B-cell
and plasmablast antibody responses.21 This provides biologic
plausibility for the association of S aureus colonization with
reduced vaccine antibody responses.
Previous ADRN studies of transcutaneous vaccination to
yellow fever virus in skin of patients with AD revealed an inverse
association between total serum IgE levels and neutralizing
antiviral antibody titers.22 In the current study of intradermal
vaccination, however, reduced anti-influenza antibody responses
were independent of baseline serum IgE levels. Our data suggest
that the immunologic characteristics of the skin compartment
and microbiome might dictate immune responses to influenza
vaccines in patients with AD.
Considering that AD is a common health problem, these
patients, as well as those with other skin diseases, should be
evaluated during early-stage clinical trials that involve cutaneous
delivery. New biomarkers, such as total serum IgE and SASC,
might prove useful to identify population subsets that might not
respond optimally to intradermal vaccination.
A limitation of our current study is that skin swabs for S aureus
were not collected on the day of vaccination for 79% of
participants. However, microbiologic studies have demonstrated
that S aureus colonization can affect more than 90% of patients
with severe AD.23 Persistent S aureus colonization in participants
with AD for up to 1 year has been demonstrated in other studies,
suggesting that skin swabs obtained at different time points will
be relevant to future propensity to S aureus colonization.24-26
Another limitation of our study is that because intradermal
vaccination is only approved for adults, the current study did
not include children. However, it is immunologically plausible
that S aureus colonization subverts the skin immune response
because eczema herpeticum in all age groups is associated with
S aureus colonization.27
In our current study we conclude that nonatopic participants
and participants with AD overall mount similar immune

jects (P 5.003 and P 5.01, respectively) and S aureus–colonized
patients with AD (P <.001 and P 5.002, respectively) when they
were vaccinated intradermally, suggesting the local environment
of the S aureus–colonized skin subverts vaccine immune
responses. Because SASC has been reported in the majority of
AD,23 the most prudent approach will be to avoid intradermal
influenza vaccination in patients with AD when a suitable vaccine
with an alternative route of administration is available and not
contraindicated.

Clinical implications: Patients with AD colonized with S aureus
exhibit reduced immune responses to influenza vaccination
compared with noncolonized patients after intradermal but
not intramuscular vaccination. Intramuscular influenza vacci-
nation should be given preference in S aureus–colonized
patients.

(most severe lesion) and nonlesional swabs were collected. Nonlesional swabs
were collected for nonatopic subjects. The body site priorities for swabbing
were the (1) extremities, (2) face/neck, and (3) trunk. Participants had not
taken oral antibiotics or topical prescription medications within 7 days before
swabbing and had not taken systemic immunosuppressive drugs within
20 days before swabbing. In brief, a skin swab (BD BBL CultureSwab, Liquid
Stuart’s Transport, and Single Swab) was moistened with nonbacteriostatic
saline and used to swab a 5 3 5–cm area. Swabs were then used to inoculate
blood agar plates (5% sheep blood; no. R01202; Remel, Lenexa, Kansas).
Plates were incubated up to 48 hours in a 5% CO2 incubator at 378C. Colonies
appearing to be S aureus were tested for coagulase and catalase. If the test
results were positive, the colonies were identified as S aureus species.
SASC was defined based on S aureus growth in skin cultures. Participants
with AD were defined as having SASC if either lesional or nonlesional skin
showed S aureus growth.
IgE and IgG antibodies specific for SEB or TSST-1. IgE
and IgG antibodies specific for SEB or TSST-1 were measured by using a
fluoroenzyme immunoassay (FEIA; ImmunoCAP 250; Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Kalamazoo, Mich). The ImmunoCAP is a computer-driven
autoanalyzer that uses a solid-phase immunometric (labeled antibody) assay
chemistry.E1-E3
HAI antibody titers. Assays were performed, as previously
described,E4 using antigens from the Investigator Reagent Resource, Centers
of Disease Control. Sera were incubated at 1:4 in receptor-destroying enzyme
solution (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 minutes at 568C and
subsequently with turkey red blood cells at 48C for 60 minutes to remove
nonspecific hemagglutinins. Serial 2-fold dilutions in PBS starting at 1:10
were mixed with 4 HA units of each vaccine virus antigen and turkey red blood
cells in 96-well V-bottom microtiter plates (Corning, Corning, NY) for 30 mi-
nutes at room temperature. The HAI titer was defined as the reciprocal of the
last serum dilution with no HAI activity. A titer of 5 was assigned to samples in
which the first dilution was negative. Each run included high- and low-titer
positive controls. Assays were considered valid if the control HAI titers had
2-fold or less differences from their previously established mean titers.

 antibody levels were measured by means of capture ELISAwith precoated 96-
well microtiter plates (M1551; Cell Sciences, Newburyport, Mass). Plates
were incubated at 378C for 1.5 hours with the test sera diluted at 1:2 for IgG1,
undiluted for IgG2, and diluted 1:4 for IgG3 in the kit-provided diluent. For
IgG3 plates, wells were first blocked with 20% FBS for 1 hour and washed
before incubating with sera. After washing, 8 HA units of B/Wisconsin/1/2010
in 100 mL of PBS were added to each well and incubated overnight at 48C.
Wells were washed the following day, and 100 mL of goat anti–influenza B
(AB1058; Millipore, Temecula, Calif) diluted 1:100 in kit diluent were added
to each well. After 1 hour at room temperature, wells were washed, and
100 mL of anti-goat–horseradish peroxidase (6300-05; SouthernBiotech,
Birmingham, Ala) diluted 1:1000 in diluent were added to each well. After
1 hour at room temperature, wells were washed, and bound antibodies were
revealed with ABTS (0401-01; SouthernBiotech). Influenza B strain–specific
IgA antibodies were measured by coating 96-well plates with IgA antibody at
2 mg/mL (3860-1AD; Mabtech, Cincinnati, Ohio) overnight. Wells were
washed and incubated for 2 hours with test sera diluted 1:20 in diluent. After
washing, 8 HA units of B/Florida/4/2006 in 100 ml of PBS was added to each
well and incubated at 48C overnight. Wells were washed and 100 mL of anti-
influenza B–horseradish peroxidase (ab20039; Abcam, Cambridge, United
Kingdom) were added to each well. After 1 hour at room temperature, wells
