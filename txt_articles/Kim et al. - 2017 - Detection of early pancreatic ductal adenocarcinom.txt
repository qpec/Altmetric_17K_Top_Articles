Markers are needed to facilitate early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is often di-
agnosed too late for effective therapy. Starting with a PDAC cell reprogramming model that recapitulated the
progression of human PDAC, we identified secreted proteins and tested a subset as potential markers of PDAC.
We optimized an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using plasma samples from patients with various
stages of PDAC, from individuals with benign pancreatic disease, and from healthy controls. A phase 1 discovery
study (n = 20), a phase 2a validation study (n = 189), and a second phase 2b validation study (n = 537) revealed
that concentrations of plasma thrombospondin-2 (THBS2) discriminated among all stages of PDAC consistently.
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) c-statistic was 0.76 in the phase 1 study, 0.84 in the phase 2a study,
and 0.87 in the phase 2b study. The plasma concentration of THBS2 was able to discriminate resectable stage I
cancer as readily as stage III/IV PDAC tumors. THBS2 plasma concentrations combined with those for CA19-9, a
previously identified PDAC marker, yielded a c-statistic of 0.96 in the phase 2a study and 0.97 in the phase 2b
study. THBS2 data improved the ability of CA19-9 to distinguish PDAC from pancreatitis. With a specificity of 98%,
the combination of THBS2 and CA19-9 yielded a sensitivity of 87% for PDAC in the phase 2b study. A THBS2 and
CA19-9 blood marker panel measured with a conventional ELISA may improve the detection of patients at high
risk for PDAC.
INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is projected to become the
second leading cause of cancer death in the United States by 2020 (1).
Most of the PDAC patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage of dis-
ease, and their tumors are not surgically resectable, contributing to an
overall 5-year survival rate of 7% (2). The lack of early diagnostics has
made it challenging to develop therapeutics to slow or reverse PDAC
(3). The CA19-9 serum marker is used to assess disease progression in
PDAC patients (4, 5) but is not recommended for general screening
(5, 6) because it is elevated in nonmalignant pancreatic conditions, such
as chronic pancreatitis (7), and can produce false negatives in individ-
uals who do not express Lewis blood group antigens (8). Other se-
creted markers have been reported for PDAC (9–12) including blood
or urine proteins (13–15), exosomes (11), microRNAs (16), and epige-
netic marks in circulating nucleosomes (17). However, challenges in-
clude lack of translation to the clinic, small sample sizes precluding
statistical robustness, lack of blinded design, or inappropriate construc-
tion of data sets from development to validation (15–19). Most bio-
markers were discovered in advanced PDAC or cell lines that are not
representative of earlier stages, when detection would be most relevant,
although recent candidates have been tested or discovered in prediag-
nostic samples of PDAC (20–22). When agnostic biomarker panels are
assessed in validation samples, the need to aggregate samples from
multiple sources hampers achieving statistical power (23).
We reasoned that proteins released from progressing precursor le-
sions, such as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) stages 2 and
3 (PanIN2 and PanIN3) (24), might provide an effective opportunity
for discovering diagnostic markers for PDAC. We previously repro-
grammed recurrent, advanced human PDAC cells into an induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–like cell line (25). This iPSC-like cell line
(designated as 10-22) can be propagated indefinitely yet preferentially
generates PanIN2 and PanIN3 ductal lesions after growing for 3
months as teratomas in immunodeficient mice. The lesions progress
to invasive PDAC by 6 to 9 months. Proteomic analysis of conditioned
media from 10-22 cell–derived precursor PanINs cultured as organoids,
compared to control media from 10-22 cells grown under pluripo-
tency conditions, revealed 107 secreted human proteins specific to the
PanIN2/3 organoids (25). Of these, 43 proteins fell into interconnected
transforming growth factor–b (TGFb) and integrin networks for PDAC
progression (26, 27), and 25 proteins were within a network for the
transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a (HNF4a), which also
showed an increase in expression (25). Here, we report an analysis of
proteins secreted or released from the 10-22 cell–derived PanIN orga-
noids using a phased cancer marker development design that
incorporated criteria for prospective specimen collection and retro-
spective blinded evaluation (PRoBE) (28, 29).
RESULTS
Discovery of candidate marker proteins for PDAC
Of the 107 proteins secreted and released selectively by human PanIN
organoids (25), we focused on 53 proteins with a low abundance
(≤2 nmol) in the healthy human plasma proteome and RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) databases (table S1) (30–32). Enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assays (ELISAs) from validated sources (33) were not available
for most of these rarely expressed proteins. Of the proteins for which
reliable ELISA kits were available and were not implicated as markers
in other diseases, we focused on matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2),

 MMP10, and thrombospondin-2 (THBS2) because they occur in
integrated networks for TGFb and integrin signaling, which drive
PDAC progression (25). We investigated these three candidate markers
in a screen of human plasma samples. All procedures were performed
using a recommended biomarker phased design following the PRoBE
criteria (28, 29). De-identified human plasma samples were provided
by the Mayo Clinic pancreas research biospecimen repository. We then
performed ELISA analyses blinded to disease status and then re-
turned coded data to the Mayo Clinic team for statistical analysis and
interpretation.
Phase 1 validation of candidate markers for PDAC
We examined whether MMP2, MMP10, or THBS2 could discriminate
between cancer cases (n = 10) and controls (n = 10) with an area un-
der the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) analysis
of the sensitivity and specificity of the markers. All cancer cases for the
phase 1 study were selected to have CA19-9 concentrations equal to or
above 55 U/ml. MMP2 was unable to discriminate effectively between
cancer cases and controls, and MMP10 signals were undetectable in all
plasma samples (Fig. 1A). By contrast, THBS2 exhibited a c-statistic of
0.76 considering all cases versus controls (n = 10) and 0.886 when
considering resectable and locally ad-
vanced PDAC (n = 7). Given that human
THBS2 has 80% amino acid sequence
homology with THBS1, we demonstrated
the specificity of each of the reagents in
the THBS2 ELISA (figs. S1 and S2).
After the phase 1 validation analysis,
we performed a mass spectrometry study
of the pooled cancer plasma samples (n =
10) and the pooled control plasma samples
(n = 10) after the plasma samples were in-
dividually depleted of the 14 most abun-
dant plasma proteins (for example,
serum albumin). At 5% false discovery rate
(FDR), four unique peptides for THBS2
were identified, of which two were from
sequences specific to THBS2 and the other
two were from sequences that are con-
served between THBS1 and THBS2. One
of two peptides specific to THBS2 was
present at a threefold greater concentration
in the cancer plasma pool compared to the
control plasma pool, and another peptide
specific to THBS2 was detected only in the
cancer pool and not in the control pool
(table S2, A and B). At 1% FDR, a THBS2-
specific peptide was detectable only in the
cancer pool (table S2C). Computational
analysis of RNA expression data deposited
in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
database (https://cancergenome.nih.gov/)
showed that, of all cancers tested, PDAC
(n = 134) was second only to mesothelio-
ma for expression of THBS2 mRNA (Fig.
1B; medians are denoted by vertical black
bars within the red boxes). Taking together
the phase 1 validation study by ELISA,
mass spectrometry data, and TCGA RNA-
seq data, we concluded that THBS2 merited
further study.
Phase 2a validation of THBS2 and
CA19-9 markers for PDAC
Further validation of THBS2 was per-
formed on human plasma samples in a
phase 2a study (Table 1) that contained
CA19-9–negative and CA19-9–positive
cases. The median ELISA value for THBS2

 2a group, 29.7 ng/ml, was 12.2 ng/ml higher than that observed in
controls (n = 80) (Fig. 2A), consistent with the mass spectrometry data
for the phase 1 study. THBS2 exhibited a c-statistic of 0.842 for all
PDAC samples compared to controls (n = 161; Table 2, all PDAC
stages). In the same sample set, CA19-9 had a comparable c-statistic
of 0.846 for all PDAC samples compared to controls (Table 2, all PDAC
stages).
The data for the THBS2 analyses were reproducible using three
different lot numbers for ELISA kits testing the same subset of phase
2a human plasma samples over a 2-year period, with an average 10%
coefficient of variation (CV) across the samples (fig. S3). The samples
included four plasma samples that were refrozen and thawed twice and
three plasma samples that were refrozen and thawed three times. We con-
cluded that the THBS2 assay was robust from the point of view of differ-
ences in plasma sample handling and assessment.
To determine whether CA19-9 and THBS2 together could consti-
tute a more discriminatory panel than either marker alone, we per-
formed logistic regression to estimate the combined probability of
their discriminatory ability. A combination of CA19-9 and THBS2 for
all cases versus controls with the phase 2a data yielded a c-statistic of
0.956 (95% CI, 0.93 to 0.98) (Fig. 2C, all PDAC stages, and Table 2),
indicating the utility of the two-marker panel.
Phase 2b validation of THBS2 and CA19-9 markers for PDAC
We performed an independent phase 2b validation study (see Table 1 for
specimens) with an increased sample size. We accomplished temporal
validation (18) because the phase 2b analysis was conducted more
than 1 year after the phase 2a study. The distribution of THBS2 values
across the phase 2a and 2b studies is shown in fig. S4, and the range
and median values of THBS2 and CA19-9 are shown in table S3.
The c-statistics for CA19-9 and THBS2 alone, 0.881 and 0.875, re-
spectively, slightly improved with the larger sample size of the phase
2b study (n = 337), compared to the phase 2a study (n = 161), and the
combination of the two markers yielded a c-statistic of 0.970 (95% CI,
0.96 to 0.98) (Table 2, all PDAC stages; Fig. 2, B and D). With regard
to the distribution variability, the 75th percentile of the control values
fell below the 25th percentile of the case values. Furthermore, the 95th
percentile of the controls fell below the median measure observed in
the case samples. The fact that 50% of the case values exceeded 95% of
the control values was likely driving the AUC we observed for THBS2
with regard to being able to discern between cases and controls. We
compared individual and combined marker performance in the phase
2a and 2b studies at the stages of resectable PDAC (stages I and II)
and locally advanced and metastatic PDAC (stages III and IV). Nota-
bly, the combination panel of CA19-9 and THBS2 performed well
across all stages of PDAC (Table 2).
More detailed analysis of the distribution of ELISA signals provided
insight into how the combination of CA19-9 and THBS2 performed. As
observed in the scatter plots in Fig. 2 (E and F), various cases (red plus)
had essentially zero CA19-9 signal (that is, along the bottom of the
plot), consistent with the likelihood that they were from PDAC pa-
tients who were Lewis antigen–negative; however, many of these
cases had elevated THBS2 concentrations. Similarly, several cases ex-
hibited THBS2 concentrations that overlapped with the upper range
of the group of controls, and these cases exhibited high CA19-9.
Thus, the two markers appeared to be complementary in their ability
to detect PDAC.
Although stages I, IIA, and IIB are classified as resectable tumors in
the sixth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Pancre-
atic Cancer Staging System (34), only stages I and IIA are considered to
be early. Therefore, we directly compared the AUCs for combinations
of stages: I + IIA + IIB + II (unspecified), I + IIA + II (unspecified), and I +
IIA in our phase 2a and 2b studies. The AUC and 95% CI values were
comparable for the two-marker combination across these three subsets,
indicating that the exclusion of the questionable early-stage IIB samples
had limited impact on marker performance (table S4).
We evaluated the relationship between THBS2 plasma values and
age, sex, and the presence of diabetes mellitus in the cohort (table S5, A
and B). We observed no apparent associations between these parameters
for any of the diagnosis groups of PDAC adenocarcinoma stages I/II,
adenocarcinoma stages III/IV, pancreatitis, intraductal papillary muci-
nous neoplasm, insulinoma (islet cell), and healthy controls. Given the
overall lack of associations, we did not include any of these factors as
adjustor variables in subsequent modeling analyses.
Establishing a provisional cutoff plasma concentration
for THBS2
To determine a THBS2 plasma concentration to use as a cutoff
point for discriminating healthy controls from PDAC cases in the clinic,
we first considered the distribution of THBS2 values based on the 230
healthy controls from our combined phase 1, 2a, and 2b studies. From
this distribution, we chose six cutoffs that represented a range of

 approximate false-positive rates (FPRs) from 0 to 5%. These cutoffs
were then evaluated for their sensitivity in detecting PDAC in the
phase 2a and 2b plasma samples. As seen in Table 3 for the phase 2b
study, a concentration of THBS2 at or above 42 ng/ml detected about
half of the PDAC cases (sensitivity) with 99% specificity. Combining the
conventional CA19-9 cutoff of ≥55 U/ml and a cutoff of 42 ng/ml for
THBS2 in the phase 2b samples, we observed 98% specificity and 87%
sensitivity (Table 3).
Testing the THBS2/CA19-9 panel against other benign
pancreatic conditions
When considering all PDAC cases versus chronic pancreatitis (phase
2a, n = 109; phase 2b, n = 252), c-statistics including CA19-9
increased from 0.774 or 0.816 (alone) to 0.842 or 0.867 (with THBS2)
with the phase 2a or 2b data, respectively (Table 4 and Fig. 3A). The
THBS2/CA19-9 panel was able to discriminate all PDAC cases tested
(stages I to IV) versus intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (n =
312) with a c-statistic of 0.952 (Table 4 and Fig. 3B). Thus, the
THBS2/CA19-9 panel was able to distinguish PDAC from intraductal
papillary mucinous neoplasms and helped to distinguish PDAC from
pancreatitis compared to CA19-9 alone.
THBS2 lacked the ability to discriminate between all PDAC cases
and PNETs and hindered, rather than enhanced, the c-statistic of
CA19-9 (Table 4 and Fig. 3C). Considering a lack of markers available
for PNETs and the poor performance of THBS2 in the discrimination of
PDAC from PNETs, we examined whether THBS2 could discriminate
PNETs (n = 30) from healthy normal controls (n = 149). CA19-9 alone
did not discriminate PNET samples, as previously reported (35). However,
THBS2 alone could discriminate PNETs from healthy normal controls with
a c-statistic of 0.751 (Table 4 and Fig. 3D).
PDAC can result in obstructive jaundice that can confound plasma
assays(20, 36). Of the 288 adenocarcinoma cases included in these studies,
we retrieved clinical total serum bilirubin information for 279 cases
(96.9%) (table S6A). Of the 279 samples with this information, 70
(25.1%) were inferred to have obstructive jaundice based on total bilirubin
concentrations of ≥3.5 mg/dl. Slightly lower median CA19-9 concentra-
tions (208.5 U/ml versus 220 U/ml) as well as elevated median THBS2
concentrations (56.4 ng/ml versus 33.0 ng/ml) were observed in PDAC
subjects with jaundice when compared to those without jaundice, indi-
cating that obstructive jaundice influenced both CA19-9 and THBS2
concentrations. Yet, 14 of 55 (25%) PDAC patients with normal
CA19-9 and without jaundice had elevated THBS2 concentrations
(≥42 ng/ml) (table S6B). Also, 8 of 13 (62%) patients with normal
CA19-9 and with jaundice showed elevated THBS2 concentrations
(≥42 ng/ml) (table S6B). Therefore, the THBS2 concentration in the
plasma identified a subset of nonjaundiced adenocarcinoma cases with
normal CA19-9 concentrations. Furthermore, stratifying the marker
panel performance by overall PDAC or PDAC without jaundice, versus
controls, in the phase 2a and 2b studies affected the AUCs by less than
0.01 (table S6C). Because of limited availability of benign biliary dis-
ease samples, we did not compare THBS2 and CA19-9 concentrations
between benign biliary disease, nonjaundice PDAC, and jaundice
PDAC.
Cross-validation of THBS2 measurements in
different laboratories
After these analyses, an independent biomarker development labora-
tory at the University of Pennsylvania tested a subset of the phase 2b
plasma samples for THBS2 concentrations. Thirty-eight samples were
randomly selected to cover the entire range of THBS2 concentrations,
focusing on those around the cutoff value. The samples were de-identified
and provided without communication other than the manufacturer’s
instructions for the ELISA and Materials and Methods. The ELISAs
for THBS2 were performed more than a year after the original study
and with reagents with different lot numbers. The THBS2 concentra-
tions in the original and cross-validated assays were highly concordant
and yielded Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.95 and
0.968, respectively (fig. S5A).

 We noticed that the THBS2 signals were slightly lower in the cross-
validated data, including those for the normal human control plasma
samples used on each plate. The original studies yielded an average
value of 17 ng/ml for the normal control plasma samples, whereas
the cross-validation study yielded a value of 13.25 ng/ml for the
normal control plasma samples. The lower overall values of unknowns
caused 4 of the 38 samples that were just over the cutoff of 42 ng/ml to
fall below the cutoff (table S7A).
To accommodate operational differences, we created a scalar where
our original cutoff of 42 ng/ml to detect cancer was divided by the
original average value of 17 ng/ml (the normal plasma control value)
to yield a scalar cutoff of 2.47. We therefore divided the THBS2 result
for each unknown in the cross-validation study by the value (13.25 ng/ml)
of the normal control plasma, where the cutoff value would be 2.47 times
the control value. Scaling did not affect the correlation coefficient
(fig. S5B). With the data scaled in this fashion, two samples that were
below the cutoff of 42 ng/ml in the original samples were now above
the cutoff in the cross-validation data (table S7B). Thus, although the
scaling method improved the outcome of the cross-validation assay,
careful calibration was needed to ensure consistency in the assay
results over time and with different batches of reagent, once a cutoff
for clinical practice was determined.
THBS2 expression in different stages of human PDAC
We sought to determine the cells expressing THBS2 in a total of 42 cases
of human PDAC and 4 cases of incidental PanIN and intraductal pap-
illary mucinous neoplasms by immunohistochemistry. All 42 cases of
PDAC and all 4 cases of incidental PanIN/intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasms exhibited detectable THBS2 (Fig. 4, fig. S6, and table S8).
Two different antibodies detected THBS2 in PanIN2 epithelia found in-
cidentally in the PDAC tumor, but little THBS2 was found in PanIN1
epithelia (Fig. 4, A and B). Both antibodies also detected THBS2 in stage
II and stage III PDAC. A 10-fold excess of peptide specific to the second
antibody blocked staining by this antibody (Fig. 4, C to K). Epithelial
cells, but not stromal cells, predominantly stained positive for THBS2
expression in PanIN/intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm tissue
(four of four) (Fig. 4, A and B, and fig. S6, B and C). In PDAC tumor
tissue, 32 cases were labeled with THBS2 in epithelial cells and 21 cases
were labeled in both epithelial and stromal cells, and in 8 cases of poor-
ly differentiated PDAC tissue, the staining was mostly in stromal cells
(table S8).
DISCUSSION
With a 5-year survival rate for patients with stage I PDAC being at
least four times the overall survival rate for PDAC (34, 37), the
THBS2/CA19-9 marker panel may help to detect early-stage tumors
that are resectable and should improve the prognosis of PDAC. The
performance of THBS2 in early-stage cancer may be a consequence of
our discovery that it is secreted or released from human precursor
PanIN organoids (25), reflecting the ability of the iPSC-like 10-22
PDAC cell line to recapitulate human pancreatic cancer progression.
Although most patients with PDAC are diagnosed at advanced stages,
the time from the occurrence of the initiating mutation to the birth of
PDAC founder cells (38) can be a decade, suggesting that there may
be a time period to identify progressing disease before PDAC can be
clinically imaged. PanINs have been identified in the pancreas up to
10 years before the development of infiltrating PDAC (39), underscor-
ing the importance of early diagnosis. However, we note that PanINs
can also be observed in the absence of PDAC.
We propose that high specificity outweighs considerations of
increased sensitivity because of heightened anxiety in patients over
suspected pancreatic cancer plus the costs of subsequent diagnostic
evaluation. We found that, with a THBS2 concentration cutoff of
42 ng/ml, THBS2 could discriminate PDAC patients from healthy
primary care controls with a specificity of 99% (1% FPR) and a sen-
sitivity of 52%. Impressively, combining CA19-9 (>55 U/ml) with
THBS2 (>42 ng/ml) showed a specificity of 98% and a sensitivity of

 87% in our larger phase 2b study. An important strength of this study
was the ability to use large defined plasma samples obtained from a
single institution that followed standardized processing protocols (23).
Decreased THBS1 concentrations by mass spectroscopy analysis
have been reported in plasma samples from PDAC patients and in
samples obtained before the cancer diagnosis (20, 40). Jenkinson et al.
(20) found that reduced concentrations of THBS1 occurred in PDAC
patients with diabetes, but not in PDAC patients without diabetes. In
contrast, we observed that elevated concentrations of THBS2 were as-
sociated with PDAC, but we did not find an association of elevated
THBS2 concentrations with diabetes mellitus, age, or sex (table S5, A
and B). THBS1 and THBS2 share 80% of their protein sequence but
have diverged in function and in their genetic regulation (41, 42). We
showed that elevated THBS2 did not correspond to THBS1 in PDAC.
First, the antibodies in the ELISA kit used for our study had negligible
cross-reactivity with THBS1 (figs. S1 and S2). Second, we confirmed by
Table 3. THBS2 concentration cutoff points based on percentiles of distribution in control plasma samples.

 mass spectrometry that the peptides specific to THBS2 were more
abundant in cancer patient plasma samples than in plasma samples
from normal healthy controls (table S2). Thus, elevated THBS2 concen-
trations in PDAC were independent of THBS1 concentrations reported
in the literature.
THBS2 is a glycoprotein that may be an angiogenesis inhibitor,
and mutation of the mouse TSP-2 gene increases susceptibility to
cancer (43). We found that THBS2 antigen is expressed in normal
pancreas cells, but the baseline concentration of THBS2 is very low
in normal human plasma by both mass spectrometry and ELISA.
We found that THBS2 antigen is robustly expressed in PDAC tumor
tissue, perhaps concordant with the poor vascularization associated
with PDAC, and is also increased in the plasma of PDAC patients.
THBS2 is down-regulated in gastric cancer cells (44). Further work
is needed to understand how the release of THBS2 into the plasma
is increased in the patient cohorts studied here.
A group of scientists has initiated the STARD (Standards for Re-
porting of Diagnostic Accuracy) with guidelines to improve the re-
porting of diagnostic accuracy (45). It will be useful to follow these
standard guidelines in the clinic by reporting imprecision as the CV
(%CV) and precision as 95% CIs near clinical decision points obtained
by repeating the test over several independent days. Also, to reduce
even small differences in the assay occurring between different labora-
tories, presenting the likelihood ratio with 95% CIs along with speci-
ficity and sensitivity at several cutoff points is recommended. Our
cross-validation study was an initial attempt to address these issues,
and more work is needed for a determination of clinical decision
points with confidence.
The combination ofTHBS2and CA19-9
improvedthe discrimination of patientswith
PDAC from those with chronic pancreatitis.
Longitudinalstudiesareneededtodetermine
whether a subset of the pancreatitis patients
who scored positive for THBS2 but were
clinically assessed to be PDAC-negative
harbored early-stage PDAC. Likewise, larger
studiesareneededtodeterminetheeffective-
ness of THBS2 for diagnosing PNETs where
CA19-9 is not applicable, and other cancers
showing high THBS2 mRNA expression
(Fig. 1B). Further research with larger num-
bers of pancreatic cancer cases without jaun-
dice as well as patients without cancer but
with jaundice will be necessary to quantify
the value of THBS2 and CA19-9 for detect-
ing nonjaundice pancreatic cancer.
There are limitations to our study.
The prevalence of PDAC in different po-
pulations affects the positive predictive
value (PPV) and negative predictive val-
ue (NPV) for determining the utility of a
biomarker in a population. The PPV is
the probability that subjects with a posi-
tive screening test have the disease, and
the NPV is the probability that subjects
with a negative screening test do not have
the disease. Given the low prevalence of 4
to 12.4 cases of pancreatic cancer per
100,000 in the general population (https://
seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html), our marker panel with
a combined 98% specificity and 87% sensitivity would have a PPV of
0.002, with an NPV of 1.0 (2). Yet, when viewed in terms of the 1.5%
lifetime risk of PDAC in the general population (2), the PPV becomes
about 0.4 with an NPV of 0.99. For patients older than 55 years who are
newly diagnosed with diabetes (46), with a prevalence of 1% in the
general population for PDAC, the PPV is 0.31 and the NPV is 1.0. For
first-degree relatives of PDAC patients and smokers in the general popu-
lation, each group with a lifetime risk of 3.75% (47), the PPV is 0.63 and
the NPV is 0.99. For carriers with relevant germline mutations (in ag-
gregate, including BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, and PALB2), the lifetime
risk is 40% (47), the PPV rises to 0.97, and the NPV is 0.92. On the basis
of these considerations, we suggest that the THBS2/CA19-9 marker
panel could serve as a low-cost, nonintervention screening tool in
asymptomatic individuals who have a high risk of developing PDAC
(3, 47, 48) and also in patients who are newly diagnosed with diabetes
mellitus that developed as a result of pancreatic injury (49), but not in
the general population.
Another limitation of our work is that our histological analysis of
THBS2 expression at different stages of pancreatic cancer was limited
by the portion of tissue available from each of the resections. Further-
more, it is unclear how expression of THBS2 in cells under normal or
pathological conditions may relate to the extent to which the protein is
secreted or released into the plasma and how stable it is in the plasma.
Also, further work is needed to refine clinical decision points for high-
risk individuals, to determine the panel’s utility for detecting earlier-stage
progression to PDAC, and to determine the specificity for pancreatic
cancer versus cancers of other tissue types and other disease states.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and populations
All procedures were performed using a recommended biomarker
phased design following the PRoBE criteria (28, 29). De-identified human
plasma samples from the Mayo Clinic pancreas research biospecimen re-
pository were shipped to our laboratory, where ELISA analyses were per-
formed blinded to disease status, and then coded data were returned to the
Mayo Clinic team for statistical analysis and interpretation.
Collection of plasma samples was ap-
proved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Re-
view Board (IRB). After rapid case finding
(50) and informed consent, participants
with PDAC provided venous blood sam-
ples before initiation of cancer therapy.
Samples were frozen at −80°C until used.
Similarly, blood samples were obtained
from the Mayo Clinic through primary care
(healthy controls) and gastroenterology
clinics (participants diagnosed with chronic
pancreatitis, intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasms, and PNETs). An aliquot of the
serum was assayed for CA19-9 at the Mayo
Clinic Immunochemical Core Laboratory
as recommended by the ELISA kit manu-
facturer (Cobas/Roche). Demographic and
clinical characteristics in each group are
shown in Table 1.
Exploratory set (phase 1)
Plasma samples from 20 non-Hispanic
Caucasian subjects recruited at the Mayo
Clinic included 10 healthy primary care
controls and 10 [6 early stage (I/II) and 4
late stage (III/IV)] patients with clinically
or histologically proven PDAC. All cancer
cases for phase 1 were selected to have
CA19-9 concentrations above 55 U/ml.
Validation set (phase 2a)
Plasma samples from 189 non-Hispanic
Caucasian subjects recruited at the Mayo
Clinic included 81 (58 early stage and 23
late stage) patients with clinically or histo-
logically proven PDAC, 80 healthy primary
care controls, and 28 patients with a person-
al history of chronic pancreatitis; patients
with hereditary pancreatitis were excluded
given their increased risk for PDAC. The
controls were matched to the cases by age
and sex. About 15% of the healthy controls
self-reported a personal history of diabetes.
Validation set (phase 2b)
Plasma samples collected from 537 non-
Hispanic Caucasian subjects recruited at
the Mayo Clinic included 197 (88 early
stage and 109 late stage) patients with
clinically or histologically proven PDAC,
140 healthy primary care controls, 115
patients with intraductal papillary muci-
nous neoplasm without PDAC, 30 patients
with PNET, and 55 patients with a self-
reported personal history of chronic pancreatitis; patients with hered-
itary pancreatitis were excluded. About 11% of the controls self-reported
a personal history of diabetes.

 chromatography using a Seppro IgY14 LC10 column (Sigma-Aldrich).
The resulting 10 samples of cancer plasmas, depleted of abundant pro-
teins, were pooled separately from a pool of the controls, and the two
pools were subjected to two-dimensional strong cation exchange (SCX)
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis as previously de-
scribed(51).Inbrief,anSCXtipcolumnwasmadewitha200-mltippacked
with 20-ml PolySULFOETHYL resin (Nest Group). The SCX tip was pre-
washed with buffer B [500 mM KCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4, and 30% acetoni-
trile (pH 2.6)], followed by equilibration with buffer A [10 mM NaH2PO4
and 30% acetonitrile (pH 2.6)]. The lyophilized digested peptides (100 mg)
were reconstituted in 50-ml buffer A. The reconstituted digested peptide
solution was loaded into the SCX tip column twice, followed by washing
with 50-ml buffer A. All flow-through fractions were combined (“flow-
through”). The following 100-ml KCl concentration buffers, made by
mixing the different proportions of buffer A and B, were used to suc-
cessively wash the column: 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 85, 100, 150, and 500 mM.
A total of 10 fractions were dried and desalted using the homemade C18
Stage Tips. About 3 mg of the digested peptides was injected into a
75-mm inner diameter × 25-cm C18 column with a pulled tip. EASY-
nLC 1000 was run at a flow rate of 300 nl/min for a 180-min gradient.
Online nanospray was used to spray the separated peptides into an Or-
bitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron). The raw
data were acquired with Xcalibur, and pFind2.8 software was used to
search UniProt Human database. A 5% FDR for the protein spectrum
measurement was used initially to filter the peptide search results. Table
S2 shows the results for a total of four THBS2 peptides thatweredetected
in the pooled cancer plasma samples. The pFind2.8 search engine revealed
two unique peptides in each of the pooled plasmas; the cancer pool had a
peptide specific to THBS2 (VCNSPEPQYGGK) and a peptide shared be-
tween THBS1 and THBS2 (NALWHTGNTPGQVR), and the normal pool
had a peptide specific to THBS2 (TRNMSACWQDGR) and a peptide
shared between THBS1 and THBS2 (FYVVMWK) (table S2A). We
quantified THBS2 levels in each of the pooled plasmas by measuring
the area under the peptide signals based on mass and retention time
in original MS1 and MS2 windows. We then normalized the total spec-
tral counts in each sample (table S2A).
To more stringently assess THBS2 peptide levels, we searched with
1 and 5% FDR settings against the UniProt Human database (89,796
entries in total) with the updated pFind3.0 search engine (52). Search
parameters were set for a precursor mass tolerance of ±7 parts per
million, fragment mass tolerance of ±0.4 Da, trypsin cleaving after lysine
and arginine with up to two miscleavages, carbamidomethyl (C)/+57.021
as the fixed modification, and acetyl (protein N-term)/+42.011, de-
amidated (NQ)/+0.984, and oxidation (M)/+15.995 as the variable
modifications. The target-decoy approach was used to filter the search
results, in which the FDR was less than 1 or 5% at both the peptide
and protein level. At both 1 and 5% FDR, the peptide specific to
THBS2 (VCNSPEPQYGGK) and the peptide shared between THBS1
and THBS2 (NALWHTGNTPGQVR) were seen in the cancer pooled
sample, consistent with the original pFind2.8 search (table S2, B and
C). However, at either 1 or 5% FDR with the pFind3.0 search, no pep-
tides specific to THBS2 sequence were identified, and only peptides
shared between THBS1 and THBS2 were identified in the normal
pooled sample (table S2, B and C). Therefore, more stringent analysis
verified THBS2 sequence in cancer pooled sample.
ELISAkitsforhumanMMP2(Millipore),humanMMP10(RayBiotech),
and human Thrombospondin-2 Quantikine (DTSP20, R&D Systems)
were used as described by the manufacturers’ instructions. Duplicate
5-ml plasma samples were diluted 10-fold with calibrator diluent
RD5P buffer and all 50 ml used for THBS2. Marker concentrations were
determined from standard curves of positive control proteins from the
kits with a four-parameter logistic nonlinear regression model using
SoftMax Pro Software (Molecular Devices). Normal pooled human
plasma (IPLA-N, Innovative Research) was tested in duplicate on each
ELISA plate. Across 15 independent ELISA plates, THBS2 in duplicate
control samples of commercial normal pooled human plasma ranged
between 15 and 21 ng/ml, with a CV of 13%. Also, the inclusion (or
exclusion) of occasional plasma samples that were orange or reddish
in color, indicating hemolysis, had a negligible impact on the data.
RNA-seq analysis from TCGA
THBS2 mRNA amounts were assessed in TCGA RNA-seq data sets
(http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) using the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics
(53, 54). Data were downloaded from the University of California, Santa
Cruz Xena data hub and sample IDs curated using the Broad Institute’s
Genome Data Analysis Center Firehose. THBS2 mRNA values were es-
timated by the RNA-Seq by Expectation Maximization (RSEM)
algorithm (55) and log2(RSEM + 1)–transformed for Fig. 1B, as parsed
and plotted using scripts in Python, R.
Western blot and ELISA for validation of THBS2 ELISA kits
for cross-reactivity with THBS1
The recombinant THBS proteins were obtained from R&D Systems
and performed Western blot with polyclonal goat anti-THBS2 (detec-
tion antibody; working concentration, 0.15 nM) and monoclonal
mouse anti-THBS2 (capture antibody; working concentration, 3 nM)
to check the cross-reactivity. A detection antibody and a 100-fold molar
excess of recombinant THBS1 or THBS2 proteins were incubated in 5%
nonfat milk for 30 min at room temperature for competition assay. The
incubated solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min to remove
any immunocomplexes before applying onto a polyvinylidene difluoride
(PVDF) membrane; a total of two 10-ng proteins were transferred for
detection antibodies. For competition assay of capture antibody, a 10-fold
molar excess of recombinant THBS1 or THBS2 proteins was incu-
bated with capture antibody in 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min
at room temperature. The incubated solution was centrifuged at
15,000 rpm for 15 min to remove any immunocomplexes before ap-
plying onto a PVDF membrane; a total of 10 50-ng proteins were
transferred for detection antibodies. The presence of THBS2 in a gel
was confirmed by silver staining or reprobing membranes with detec-
tion antibody in THBS2-competed membranes. To determine wheth-
er the presence of THBS1 interferes with the THBS2 ELISA, we spiked
a recombinant THBS1 protein (200 ng/ml) into various concentrations
of recombinant THBS2 proteins (0 to 20 ng/ml) or human plasma of
wide range of THBS2 in THBS2 ELISA.
Immunostaining of THBS2 in human pancreatic
cancer tissue
The pancreatic tumor tissue sections were obtained from US Biomax
(catalog #PA1002), and each tissue spot was individually examined by
their own pathologists certified according to World Health Organiza-
tion published standardizations of diagnosis, classification, and path-
ological grade. Incidental PanIN1/2 tissue section was derived from
the head and neck of the pancreas of a pancreatic periampullary cancer
patient at the Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC) under IRB 09-801 to
K.S.Z., and its histology was confirmed by pathologist J. Anderson at
FCCC. These tissue blocks do not correspond to plasma samples where
we measured plasma THBS2 concentrations. The paraffin-embedded

 tissues were antigen-retrieved by boiling in citric acid buffer (pH 6.0)
after deparaffination. Next, the endogenous peroxidase activity in tissue
slides was quenched in hydrogen peroxide solution for 15 min at room
temperature. Tissues were blocked with avidin/biotin blocking (Vector
Laboratories) for 15 min each, followed by nonprotein blocker (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies
were applied and incubated for 12 to 16 hours at 4°C. Two primary
antibodies for THBS2 were used for our study: goat polyclonal THBS2
antibody (dilution 1:25; sc-7655, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit
polyclonal THBS2 antibody (dilution 1:100; TA590658, OriGene). It is
not clear where TA590658 antibody recognizes and whether it detects
secreted THBS2. Yet, sc-7655 antibody can detect both secreted and cy-
toplasmic THBS2 because it targets the epitopes of 15 to 20 amino
acids in length that are located within the first 50 amino acids of
the peptide sequence for THBS2, whose signal peptides are located
between 1 and 18 amino acids. Only two amino acids of the epitope
are overlapped to the signal peptides, and the remaining amino acids
are overlapped over the main body of the peptides. A peptide was avail-
able for sc-7655 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, thus the sc-7655
antibodies were incubated with the corresponding peptides in 10-fold
excess for 30 min before being applied onto tissue section to confirm
the specificity of signals. Also, no primary antibody controls for sc-7655
and TA590658 antibodies were used for negative controls. After wash-
ing twice, tissues were incubated with biotinylated anti-goat immuno-
globulin G (IgG) or rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) at 37°C for 30 min.
Tissue sections were conjugated with avidin–horseradish peroxidase
by using VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) at 37°C
for 30 min, followed by developing with DAB (3,3′-diaminobenzidine)
peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories) for peroxidase for 4 to
5 min. Developed tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin for
nucleus, dehydrated, and mounted. We confirmed the THBS2 sequence
of the peptide by mass spectrometry.
Statistical analysis
The primary comparison for this study was defined as PDAC cases
(all stages) versus healthy controls. To explore any relationship between
patient demographic information and THBS2 plasma concentrations,
we calculated a Spearman correlation coefficient for continuous varia-
bles (age) and median expression concentrations for categorical varia-
bles (sex, male versus female; presence or absence of diabetes mellitus).
On the basis of the data obtained from our phase 1 and 2 studies, we
observed no apparent associations between age, sex, diabetes mellitus,
jaundice, and THBS2. Given this lack of association, any concerns
regarding the potential for confounding were mitigated, and these
clinical factors were not included in subsequent multivariable
modeling.
Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were devel-
oped to consider each candidate marker (THBS2) alone and combined
with CA19-9. The response variable was coded as 1 to indicate the pres-
ence of cancer (0 for controls). Candidate markers (THBS2) were entered
as continuous variables. CA19-9 was dichotomized as 0 (normal) (<55 U/ml)
or 1 (elevated) (≥55 U/ml). The AUC was calculated for each model
considered. To assess whether the difference observed between AUCs
from the CA19-9 and THBS2 and the CA19-9 alone models was sta-
tistically significantly different from 0, we considered a test statistic
T (T = AUCCa199 − AUCCa199+THBS2)2/(s2
Ca199 + s2
Ca199+THBS2)
(56), which looks at the difference in AUC between the two models
divided by the sum of the variances from the two models. The fact
that this test statistic followed a c² distribution with 1 degree of free-
dom under the null hypothesis was used to calculate a resulting P val-
ue. A bootstrap percentile CI approach was used to estimate a 95% CI
for the AUC. This approach resampled the data set (1000 times) and
then ran the logistic regression models to calculate the AUC on each
bootstrapped data set to approximate the sampling distribution of the
AUC. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles from this distribution of AUC
values were then used as estimates of lower and upper bounds for the
95% CI for the AUC.
A similar approach was considered for each of the subanalyses that
stratified by stage (early stage and late stage) and other comparison
groups (intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, chronic pancreatitis,
or PNET). A k statistic was calculated to assess agreement (below cutoff
versus above cutoff) in the THBS2 assay results from each of the two
independent laboratories in the cross-validation study. Analyses were
performed using SAS 9.4 on Linux.
