Abstract
Background: Periodontal pathogens have been isolated from
precancerous and cancerous lesions and also shown to promote a
procarcinogenic microenvironment. Few studies have examined
periodontal disease as a risk factor for total cancer, and none have
focused on older women. We examined whether periodontal
disease is associated with incident cancer among postmenopausal
women in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study.
Methods: Our prospective cohort study comprised 65,869
women, ages 54 to 86 years. Periodontal disease information
was obtained via self-report questionnaires administered between
1999 and 2003, whereas ascertainment of cancer outcomes
occurred through September 2013, with a maximum follow-up
period of 15 years. Physician-adjudicated incident total cancers
were the main outcomes and site-specific cancers were secondary
outcomes. HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated
using Cox proportional hazards regression. All analyses were
conducted two-sided.
Results: During a mean follow-up of 8.32 years, 7,149
cancers were identified. Periodontal disease history was asso-
ciated with increased total cancer risk (multivariable-adjusted
HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.08–1.20); findings were similar in
analyses limited to 34,097 never-smokers (HR, 1.12; 95%
CI, 1.04–1.22). Associations were observed for breast (HR,
1.13; 95% CI, 1.03–1.23), lung (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14–
1.51), esophagus (HR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.64–6.53), gallbladder
(HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.01–2.95), and melanoma skin (HR,
1.23; 95% CI, 1.02–1.48) cancers. Stomach cancer was bor-
derline (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.94–2.67).
Conclusions: Periodontal disease increases risk of total can-
cer among older women, irrespective of smoking, and certain
anatomic sites appear to be vulnerable.
Impact: Our findings support the need for further under-
standing of the effect of periodontal disease on cancer outcomes.

Introduction
Periodontal disease has been linked to an increased risk of total
cancer (1–2) and certain site-specific cancers (3–6). The mecha-
nism for the association is not clear. Periodontal pathogens could
potentially translocate extra-orally in saliva via ingestion to infect
esophageal (7) or colonic tissues (8), or by aspiration into the
lungs (9, 10). These pathogens could also permeate through
diseased periodontal tissues into the systemic circulation to reach
distant sites (11). There are numerous scientific reports of peri-
odontal pathogen isolates in various organ systems including
lymph nodes (12), arteries (13, 14), lung aspirates (9, 10),
precancerous gastric (15) and colon lesions (16), and esophageal
(17) and colorectal cancers (18, 19). At the target site, period-
ontopathogens may promote a permissive microenvironment
conducive to cancer progression (8, 16, 20).
Few epidemiologic studies have examined periodontal disease
in relation to incident total cancer risk (1, 2), and no large-scale
studies have specifically targeted postmenopausal women.
Because periodontal disease is more prevalent with increasing
age (21) and most cancers tend to have a long latency period,
examination of periodontal disease and cancer risk among older
women is particularly important. The public health implications
could be significant given the projected increase in numbers of
older women in the United States in the coming decades.

 older women (22). Recruitment occurred between 1994 and 1998
and involved relatively healthy, community-dwelling postmen-
opausal women, ages 50 to 79 years, at 40 participating
U.S. clinical centers (23). Structured self-, and interviewer-
administered questionnaires; physical measurements; and blood
draws were the main modes of data collection at baseline enroll-
ment. Subsequently, annual appraisals were conducted via study
questionnaires in order to capture health outcomes and addi-
tional information on risk factors. One in-person follow-up visit
occurred at year 3. Detailed information on the WHI-OS has been
published previously (23). This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards at the participating institutions, and
all women provided written consent.
A total of 93,976 women enrolled in the WHI-OS. Our ana-
lytical cohort comprised women who completed the annual Year-
5 WHI-OS follow-up questions relating to periodontal disease
and oral health. In total 65,869 women were included in this
present analysis. Our exclusions included 12,173 participants
who failed to return the Year 5 Questionnaire or were missing
information on the questionnaire pertaining to periodontal dis-
ease. Other study exclusion criteria included history of any inva-
sive cancer prior to Year-5, which served as the baseline for this
analysis, (n ¼ 14,271); missing follow-up information after Year 5
(n ¼ 879); and missing information on smoking status (n ¼
784; Fig. 1).
Periodontal disease history ascertainment
Year-5 (Form 145) was used to assess periodontal disease
history. Participants were asked: "Has a dentist or dental hygienist
ever told you that you had periodontal or gum disease? (No/Yes)." This
question has been previously compared against a standardized
clinical periodontal examination within a subset of this study
population (24). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
value, and negative predictive value obtained for periodontal
disease via the self-report questionnaires were 56.2%, 78.8%,
32.8%, and 90.7%, respectively, when compared with the find-
ings from participants diagnosed with severe periodontal disease,
based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Amer-
ican Academy of Periodontology case definition for periodontal
disease.
Confounder assessment
Confounding variables were considered from detailed infor-
mation collected on risk factors for cancer using questionnaires
administered at WHI-OS enrollment. Specific questions focused
on age, race/ethnicity, educational level, region of residence,
family history of cancer, history of diabetes, recreational physical
activity, smoking status, pack-years of smoking, secondhand
smoke exposure, alcohol consumption, total dietary energy
intake, fruit and vegetable intake, total (dietary and supplement)
intake of calcium and vitamin D, and menopausal hormone
therapy (HT) use. Frequency of dental visits was captured in the
Year-5 WHI-OS questionnaire. Body mass index (BMI) was cal-
culated from measured weight and height of participants by
trained examiners at the clinical centers.
Outcomes measures
The primary outcome was incident total cancer which com-
prised the first invasive cancer diagnosed after completion of the
Year 5 Questionnaire, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers.
Secondary outcomes of interest include region- and site-specific
cancers. Time-to-event analysis for each site-specific cancer was
assessed independent of other cancer sites (for those reporting
more than one cancer). For region-specific and total cancer
analyses, the time-to-event analyses were based on whichever
cancer occurred first for that group. Cancers were identified via
annual participant health updates from Year-5 through Septem-
ber 2013, the last date of complete outcome collection for these
analyses. Self-reported cancers were confirmed by both local and
central physician adjudicators using participants' medical records
(25). Central adjudicators were responsible for the final cancer
outcome coding, based on the Surveillance Epidemiology and
End Result (SEER), International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology (ICD-O-2; ref. 26).
Statistical analyses
Participants with and without a cancer diagnosis were com-
pared using independent t tests and c2 tests. Person-time was
calculated from the date of Year-5 WHI-OS questionnaire com-
pletion until date of the first incident cancer diagnosis (or site-
specific cancer diagnosis in secondary analyses), or until censoring
from death, loss to follow-up, or end of follow-up period (Sep-
tember 2013). For the site-specific cancer cases in our secondary
analyses, all primary cancer cases were by default included in our
study, regardless if it was the first or second primary cancer. This
ensured we captured all cancer occurrences. Annualized incidence
was estimated using the following formula: [no. of events/(no. at
risk � mean follow-up years)] � 100. Cox regression analyses
were utilized in estimating HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI;
ref. 27). Unadjusted and age-adjusted models were initially con-
ducted and then evaluated for the contribution of each additional
covariate to determine their inclusion in the final multivariate
models, using the change-in-estimate method, defining an appre-
ciable change in HR as 10%. A fixed set of covariates was used in
the final multivariable-adjusted analyses for total-, region-, and
site-specific cancer risks. HRs were calculated for total cancer and
individual sites or regions with at least 20 reported cancer cases.
Multiplicative interactions of periodontal disease with each of
the following factors determined a priori were tested: age, smoking
status, BMI, history of diabetes, and HT use. Interaction was
assessed using cross-product terms in multivariate regression
models, and an interaction term P value level of significance was
set a priori at 0.2. Because smoking is such an important risk factor
for cancer, stratified analyses by smoking status (never, former,
current) were conducted. To address possible residual confound-
ing by smoking, analyses restricted to never-smokers were
reported and pack years of smoking was included in the multi-
variate-adjusted models of former and current smokers. Finally, a
sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the association
between periodontal disease and total cancer in those who
obtained dental checkups at least 1/year (combining 1/year and
�2/year). The Statistical Analysis System (SAS) for Windows 9.3
(SAS Institute, Inc.) was utilized for all analyses. All analyses were
conducted two-sided with alpha set at 0.05. Proportional hazards
assumption was tested and met.
Results
In total, 7,149 cancers occurred in 65,869 women during a
mean follow-up of 8.32 (SD �3.95) years yielding an annualized
percent of 1.4. Breast cancers constituted the majority of cases (n ¼
2,416), followed by lung and bronchus (n ¼ 855), and colon and
rectum (n ¼ 639). Digestive organ cancers made up 1,262 of the

organ cases. There were also 1,186 genitourinary cancers, 820
lymphoid and hematopoietic malignancies, and 68 lip, oral
cavity, and oral pharynx cancers combined.
Mean age of participants was 68.3 years, most were non-
Hispanic whites, had at least some college education, and
reported visiting the dentist at least 2 times/year. Periodontal
disease cases were more likely to report a history of smoking,
secondhand smoke exposure, alcohol consumption, HT (estrogen
þ progestin) use, and a cancer diagnosis. No appreciable differ-
ence was noted between the periodontal disease cases and non-
cases in terms of BMI, levels of physical activity, and history of
diabetes. There were statistically significant but small differences
relative to total energy intake, fruit and vegetable consumption,
and total intake of calcium and vitamin D (participant character-
istics are summarized in Table 1).

 For the main analyses, none of the covariates examined,
including smoking status, pack-years, secondhand smoke expo-
sure, alcohol intake, BMI, recreational physical activity, total
dietary energy intake, fruit or vegetable consumption, dietary and
supplement calcium or vitamin D intake, history of diabetes,
family history of any cancer, or hormone use, changed point
estimates appreciably. Also point estimates obtained with the
addition of smoking status and pack-years in the model, as
compared with pack-years alone, were very similar. The final
multivariate models included adjustment for age (continuous
variable), pack-years of smoking (continuous variable), and BMI
(Kg/m2) (underweight and normal weight �24.9; overweight
�25.0–29.9; obesity �30.0), based on biological plausibility and
scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed journals, even
though the point estimates did not change appreciably.
Periodontal disease history was associated with a statistically
significant 14% increased risk of total cancer (multivariable-
adjusted HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.08–1.20), similar to those obtained
for the unadjusted (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.12–1.23) and age-
adjusted (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.14–1.26) models, respectively.
Statistically significant multivariable-adjusted positive associa-
tions were also observed with breast cancer (HR, 1.13; 95% CI,
1.03–1.23), lung cancer (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14–1.51), and skin
melanomas (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02–1.48). There was a

 suggestion of an increased risk of upper digestive organ cancers
combined (esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, and intrahe-
patic bile ducts, and gall bladder and parts of biliary tract; HR,
1.19; 95% CI, 0.98–1.46), with a strong significant increased
risk seen in the upper gastrointestinal tract region (esophagus
and stomach only; HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.35–3.09). Overall, the
risk associated with periodontal disease was highest for esoph-
ageal cancer (HR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.64–6.53). Gall bladder
cancer risk was also high (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.01–2.95), while
that for stomach cancer was elevated but did not reach formal
statistical significance (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.94–2.67). Peri-
odontal disease was not associated with cancers of the pancreas,
liver, lower digestive tract organs, or lip, oral cavity, and
pharynx combined. Similarly, there was no association with
genitourinary, and lymphoid and hematopoietic malignancies.
(Findings from multivariate-adjusted models for total cancer
and cancer regions/sites are displayed in Fig. 2.)
For the stratified analyses, the addition of pack-years of smok-
ing to the multivariate-adjusted models of former and current
smokers, in order to address residual confounding among these
groups, did not appreciably change the point estimates, so we
presented the most parsimonious model, adjusting for age and
BMI only. On stratification according to cigarette smoking status,
periodontal disease history was positively associated with total
cancer risk among former (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.13–1.30) and
current smokers (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.98–1.46), and persisted
among never-smokers (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04–1.22). Among
never smokers, the association between periodontal disease his-
tory and risk of breast or lung cancers was attenuated and non-
significant; but significant for skin melanomas (HR, 1.42; 95% CI,
1.08–1.85),

(esophagus and stomach; HR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.19–4.29), and
lymphoid and hematopoietic malignancies combined (HR, 1.34;
95% CI, 1.08–1.67). Detailed information on estimates according
to smoking strata is shown in Table 2. There was a suggestion of
possible interaction by HT status (P ¼ 0.17), but none for the
other variables examined. Risk of periodontal disease and total
cancer appears to be slightly higher among current HT users (Table
3). The results of a sensitivity analyses on the association between
periodontal disease and total cancer, restricted to participants
who obtained dental checkups at least 1/year, showed a similar
positive association (HR, 1.15; 95%CI, 1.09–1.22), as in the main
analyses.
Discussion
Our findings demonstrate that periodontal disease history is
associated with an increased risk of total cancer in this cohort
of postmenopausal women and persists regardless of smoking
status. Results here are consistent with previous smaller studies
and studies in men. One study cohort of 48,735 U.S. male
health professionals reported a 14% increased risk of incident
cancer overall, among males with a self-reported history of
periodontal disease, compared with those without such a
history (2). In contrast, Wen and colleagues reported a 5%
nonsignificant increase in overall cancer risk among their
Taiwanese participants recently diagnosed with periodontitis
(1). Their largely null findings may be due to poor measure-
ment as their referent group had gingivitis, so these individuals
may have had a higher risk than those with healthy gums.
However, it may also be because they were young (ages 20–49
years), so the carcinogenicity latency period may have been too
short.
With respect to individual cancer sites, we found that women
with a history of periodontal disease were at a significantly
higher risk for breast, lung, esophageal, gallbladder, and mela-
noma skin cancers. Ours is the first study to report on the
association between periodontal disease and gallbladder cancer
risk in women or men. The association was borderline significant
with stomach cancer. No association was found for cancers of the
pancreas, colorectum, genitourinary or lymphoid, and hemato-
poietic systems. Michaud and colleagues (2008) observed higher
risks for lung and esophageal cancers, and no associations with
colorectal and stomach cancers in their study of men. However,
unlike ours, they also found elevated risk for cancers of the
pancreas, kidney, and hematopoietic system (2). Discrepancies
between studies could be due to differences in study design,
population, or periodontal disease measures used. Our lack of
association with lip, oral, and pharynx cancers as a group may be
due to the considerable heterogeneity between these anatomic
sub-sites, and our relatively small numbers of cases, in compar-
ison with previous reports with larger numbers of head and neck
cancer cases (3, 28, 29).
The strong association of smoking with periodontal disease and
with some cancers may account for some of the variations in
cancer risk betweenregions/sites andacross studies. Assessment of
intensity and duration in a cohort study is subject to considerable
measurement imprecision, and classification by smoking status
can create fuzzy boundaries. This may result in incomplete control
for the impact of smoking and bias estimates of an intervening
variable like periodontal disease (30, 31). Examination of never-
smokers in our large group of participants allowed us to attempt
to tease that out; we found the risk of total cancer among never-
smokers with a history of periodontal disease remained statisti-
cally significant and largely unchanged (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04–
1.22). Positive associations previously observed between peri-
odontal disease history and risk of breast, lung, and gallbladder
cancers, respectively, among our study participants, were attenu-
ated and statistically insignificant in never-smokers. For melano-
ma skin cancers, the associated risk was stronger in never-smokers
(HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.08–1.85) than the overall population
combined, although the reason for this is unclear. Also, the
association between periodontal disease history and malignant
neoplasms of the hematopoietic system, which was near signif-
icance in the overall population (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.95–1.30),
was statistically significant when limited to never-smokers (HR,
1.34; 95% CI, 1.08–1.67).
The finding of a strong association between periodontal disease
history and esophageal cancer risk may be because periodonto-
pathogens may track more readily to contiguous regions of the
esophagus through ingestion. Because smoking is an established
risk factor for esophageal cancer, residual confounding by smok-
ing may contribute to the strong association we observed, even
after adjustment for smoking. We had too few numbers of
smokers to successfully interrogate this association in stratified
analyses; however, when considered along with stomach cancers,
the risk appears to be elevated with upper gastrointestinal cancers,
even in never-smokers (HR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.19–4.29). Results
from previous case control studies have provided additional
evidence of an association between tooth loss (another proxy
measure for periodontal disease) and risk of esophageal (5, 32)
and stomach cancers (4, 33), respectively.

 In light of previous findings of a positive association between
periodontal disease or its pathogens, and pancreatic cancer (6, 34,
35),we expected but did not find a positive association amongour
pancreatic cancer cases. Stolzenberg-Solomon and colleagues
(2003) had reported tooth loss was much more associated with
pancreatic cancers among male smokers (6), but Michaud and
colleagues (2007) found the association remained among their
subset of male never-smokers (34). Gender differences pertaining
only to men, or our small numbers of current smokers may
account for these disparities.
The precise mechanisms through which periodontal disease
may promote cancer remain to be determined; one plausible
theory relates to oral pathogens contributing to carcinogenesis
at local or distant body sites. This may follow their ingestion in
saliva into the gut (7), aspiration within dental plaque (9–10),
or release into circulation via diseased periodontal tissues (11).
Although escape of oral pathogens into the systemic circulation
tends to be transient (36), certain pathogens such as Porphyr-
omonas gingivalis are inherently equipped with mechanisms that
prevent their subsequent uptake and elimination by neutro-
phils (37). Porphyromonas gingivalis also preferentially activates
Th2-mediated immune responses (38), inducing polarization
to M2 macrophages which are less efficient at eliminating
engulfed bacterial pathogens and their lipopolysaccharide pro-
ducts (39). Studies have shown Porphyromonas gingivalis to be
phagocytosed by dendritic cells but not killed, and these
intracellular bacterial cells home to distal sites (40). As such,
they may become cocooned within these M2 macrophages and
persist long enough within the circulatory system to reach
distant organs and produce adverse effects. Scientific reports
also show Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum
can promote tumor progression by activating toll-like receptors
(TLR) on oral epithelial cells to upregulate the IL6/STAT3
pathway (41). TLR activation has been linked to inflammation,
cellular proliferation, invasion, and evasion of antitumoral
immune responses (42, 43), and increased expression of
TLR-5 has been observed in oral cancers (44, 45). Inflammatory
processes can generate free radicals and active intermediates
causing oxidative/nitrosative stress that may induce DNA muta-
tions or interfere with DNA repair mechanisms (46).
In consideration of these findings, the strengths and limitations
of our study need to be taken into account. One limitation is the
use of a self-reported questionnaire for evaluating periodontal
disease status. Results comparing responses to our case finding
question with objective clinical periodontal measures (24) were
similar to those reported in the Health Professions Follow-up
Study (47) in which the periodontal disease question is quite
similar to that used in the WHI-OS. Although both the present
study and the Health Professions study demonstrate that self-
reported periodontal disease is reasonably accurate in large

 epidemiologic study groups, clearly this exposure is measured
with error and some amount of misclassification is likely to have
occurred. Periodontal disease status among our study participants
was probably under-reported and may have attenuated the
observed associations with disease risk, as is likely the case in
other similar studies.
Alternatively, it may be that these women, who are more
educated and less likely current smokers, are different from the
U.S. population. Overall, our assessment of periodontal disease
history showed comparable validity to other self-reported assess-
ments used in epidemiologic studies (2). Another limitation is the
possibility of residual confounding. Misclassification of smoking
status could affect the findings, particularly for smoking-related
cancers such as esophageal cancer. However, stratified analyses
suggested associations persisted even in never-smokers. Lastly,
our results may not be generalizable to men or premenopausal
women.
This study is significant in providing insight regarding older
women. It is the first national study involving U.S. women and the
first in older women. Although we had sufficient power to assess
total cancer, we had more limited power to assess less common
cancer sites. Nevertheless, ours may be one of the only studies
large enough to assess those associations. Therefore, these anal-
yses provide useful information on specific sites/regions, partic-
ularly regarding the esophagus and gallbladder for which no or
limited prior data are available. Additional study strengths
include the fact we are able to establish temporality and utilize
a very large sample with comprehensive information on baseline
characteristics to account for potential confounders and interac-
tions. Furthermore, the adjudication of cases was done by trained
physicians, thus minimizing the chances of misclassification of
outcomes.
Our study findings support an expanding body of evidence that
periodontal disease is linked to cancer risk. Studies employing
more detailed and precise clinical assessments of periodontal
disease would help to minimize potential misclassification. Inter-
vention studies that include treatment of periodontal disease may
be warranted to determine if cancer risk can be reduced overall or
in specific high-risk sites.
