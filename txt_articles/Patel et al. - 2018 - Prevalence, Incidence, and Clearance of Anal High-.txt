Background. The natural history of anal human papilloma virus (HPV) infection among human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)-infected men is unknown.
Methods. Annually, from 2004 to 2012, we examined baseline prevalence, incidence, and clearance of anal HPV infection at 
48 months, and associated factors among HIV-infected men.
Results. We examined 403 men who have sex with men (MSM) and 96 men who have sex with women (MSW) (median age 
42 years for both, 78% versus 81% prescribed cART, median CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell count 454 versus 379 cells/mm3, and 74% 
versus 75% had undetectable viral load, respectively). Type 16 prevalence among MSM and MSW was 38% versus 14% (P < .001), 
and incidence 24% versus 7% (P = .001). Type 18 prevalence was 24% versus 8% (P < .001), and incidence 13% versus 4% (P = .027). 
Among MSM and MSW, clearance of prevalent HPV 16 and HPV 18 was 31% and 60% (P = .392), and 47% and 25% (P = .297), re-
spectively. Among MSM, receptive anal sex (with or without a condom) was associated with persistent HPV 16 (OR 2.24, P < .001).
Conclusions. MSM had higher prevalence and incidence of HPV than MSW, but similar clearance. Receptive anal sex may pre-
dict cancer risk among HIV-infected MSM.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a recognized cause of anal 
cancer [1–3]. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with 
men (MSM) are about 20 times as likely as heterosexual men 
to develop anal cancer [3–7] and are also at higher risk for anal 
squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and genital warts [7–11]. 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected MSM are at 
higher risk for anal cancer compared with HIV-uninfected 
MSM or women [12, 13]. A recent analysis from the North 
American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design 
(NA-ACCORD) showed that HIV-infected MSM had the high-
est risk for anal cancer; incidence rates were 80.3 times as high 
among HIV-infected MSM compared with HIV-uninfected men 
[7]. The highest reported incidence of anal cancer among HIV-
infected MSM since the introduction of combination antiretro-
viral therapy (cART), 137 per 100 000 person-years, exceeds the 
highest reported incidence of cervical cancer anywhere in the 
world [4–8, 14]. Studies have shown a high prevalence of anal 
HPV (up to 90%) among MSM [15, 16], often with multiple 
types, regardless of CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell count [17, 18]. The 
increased burden of anal cancer among MSM, and especially 
among HIV-infected MSM, likely results from the higher prev-
alence of anal HPV in these populations, compared with other 
men and women [14, 19].
Anal HPV infection is cleared less frequently by HIV-infected 
MSM compared with HIV-uninfected MSM [20], specifically for 
HPV type 16 [21]. Persistence of high-risk HPV types 16 and 
18 is an important risk factor for the development of anal can-
cer [22–24]. HPV vaccination can prevent anal high-risk HPV 
infection; however, vaccination is limited to males younger than 
27 years of age, and wide uptake has not yet been seen [25, 26]. 
HPV vaccination of HIV-infected men age 27 years or older has 
not been shown to alter risk for incident anal HPV infection, most 
likely due to increased risk of prior HPV exposure and decreased 
risk of infection among older men [27]. Additionally, HPV vac-
cination recommendations and anal cancer screening protocols 
that involve HPV testing [28] may benefit from epidemiological 
data that examine the natural history and risk factors of anal HPV 
infection and its consequences among HIV-infected men.
To better characterize the clinical epidemiology of HPV 
infection in a cohort of HIV-infected men, we examined

prevalence, incidence, and clearance of infection among MSM 
compared with men who have sex with women (MSW). We 
further examined factors associated with clearance of HPV to 
potentially identify modifiable factors to reduce anal cancer risk 
in this population. Additionally, we assessed the association of 
HPV persistence with abnormal anal cytology.
METHODS
Study Design and Population
From March 2004 through June 2006 (the “baseline” period), 
the Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV/AIDS 
in the Era of Effective Therapy (the SUN study) enrolled 700 
HIV-infected adults from 7 clinics in 4 US cities into a prospec-
tive observational cohort study sponsored by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (http://clinicaltrials.
gov/show/NCT00146419). The study design, data collection, 
and management methods have been described previously [29]. 
Participants were generally healthy HIV-infected patients re-
ceiving routine outpatient care and whose entire antiretroviral 
experience consisted only of highly active combination antire-
troviral therapy (cART). Data were collected at a baseline visit 
through physical examination, an audio computer-assisted 
self-interview (ACASI), routine laboratory examination (eg, 
CD4 cell count, HIV RNA viral load) that included compre-
hensive testing for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), med-
ical chart abstraction for all diagnoses and treatments, and 
collection of a variety of additional study-specific biological 
specimens. The ACASI collected extensive behavioral informa-
tion, including sexual behavior. Participants were classified as 
MSM or MSW according to self-report on the ACASI. Data ab-
stracted from medical charts were entered into an electronic da-
tabase (Clinical Practice Analyst; Cerner Corporation, Vienna, 
VA) by trained staff. These data were reviewed for quality and 
analyzed centrally. All participants provided informed consent. 
The study protocol was approved and reviewed annually by the 
institutional review boards of the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) and each participating site. The study 
follow-up period for remaining participants ended in 2012.
Anal Sample Collection and Examination
Two swab specimens were collected annually for the first 5 years 
of follow-up; the first for anal cytopathologic examination (to 
optimize quality of cytology sample), and the second for HPV 
DNA testing. Each collection used a Dacron swab moistened 
with tap water that was inserted 3–5 centimeters into the anus 
to the distal rectum and rotated at least twice while apply-
ing outward pressure while being withdrawn. The cytology 
sample was placed into PreservCyt (Thin Prep vial) transport 
medium (Marlborough, MA). The swab for HPV testing was 
placed into Digene Specimen Transport Medium (STM, Qiagen 
Incorporated, Valencia, CA). Cytology specimens were evalu-
ated by a single pathologist with expertise in the interpretation 
of anal cytology (T.M. Darragh). All cytologic results were clas-
sified according to the Bethesda System terminology [30]. If the 
anal sample was satisfactory (ie, of sufficient cellularity), results 
were reported as negative, atypical squamous cells of undeter-
mined significance (ASCUS), atypical squamous cells, cannot 
exclude SIL or carcinoma. We defined abnormal anal cytology 
as any result other than negative. Based on these results, partic-
ipants were referred for appropriate follow-up per their institu-
tion’s standard of practice.
The STM samples were stored at 4°C and mailed weekly at 
ambient temperature to the CDC where they were stored at 4°C 
until DNA was extracted from 150 μL using a Roche MagNA 
Pure automated extractor with external lysis and a DNA isola-
tion kit III (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The 100 μL 
extract was stored at −20°C until use.
HPV Detection and Typing
The Roche HPV Linear Array research-use-only kit (Roche 
Diagnostics) was used following the manufacturer’s protocol, 
with the exception that 10 μL of extract was used in the 100 μL 
reaction and the hybridization and detection steps were au-
tomated. The assay uses L1 consensus PCR with biotinylated 
primers and type-specific hybridization detecting 37 different 
HPV types (14 high-risk [HR] types: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 
51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68; 23 other types: 6, 11, 26, 40, 42, 53, 54, 
55, 61, 62, 64, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 81, 82, 83, 84, 89, IS39; and 
an endogenous control gene [β-globin] ). Samples negative for 
both β-globin and HPV were considered inadequate for evalu-
ation and not included. Each assay batch included controls for 
extraction and PCR contamination, as well as a low-copy pos-
itive control (50 copies) for HPV 16. Results for HPV type 52 
may be ambiguous because of cross-hybridization of the HPV 
type 52 probe with types 33, 35, and 58. To unambiguously de-
termine the presence of HPV type 52 in samples with 1 or more 
of the 3 other types, an HPV type-52-specific real-time PCR 
assay was used [31].
Statistical Methods
Baseline prevalence of the 37 detectable HPV types was deter-
mined. We compared baseline behavioral and clinical char-
acteristics in MSM, including bisexual men, and MSW using 
either Mantel-Hanzel Χ2 or Fisher’s exact test for categorical 
variables and the Student’s t test or Kruskal-Wallis test for con-
tinuous variables, and logistic regression to assess factors asso-
ciated with HPV. We evaluated the incidence and clearance 
of HPV types 16 and 18 at the anus collected at baseline, and 
annually over 60 and 48 months, respectively, using Kaplan-
Meier survival analysis; P values were determined using the 
log-rank test. We defined incident infection as detection of 
HPV 16 or 18 not found on previous specimen collection. For 
those with prevalent or incident HPV 16 or HPV 18, we defined 
clearance as 2 consecutive visits where the respective HPV type

was not detected. Persistence was defined as HPV infection 
that did not clear, per the definition above. Incidence per 100 
person-years, and 95% Poisson confidence intervals (CIs), were 
estimated among men who did not have HPV 16 or 18 at base-
line, regardless of other HPV types. We used Mantel-Hanzel 
Χ2 to assess univariate associations of incident types 16 and 18 
infection, and clearance of prevalent type 16 and 18 infection, 
with selected baseline behavioral and clinical characteristics. 
We evaluated the number of HR and other types using the clas-
sification described above. We also investigated the relative risk 
of prevalent HPV infection and assessed the sensitivity, specific-
ity, and positive and negative predictive values of HPV detected 
at baseline as a predictive factor for any subsequent anal cyto-
logical abnormality.
All statistical analysis was performed using SAS, version 9.3 
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, www.sas.com); P val-
ues < .05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Of the 700 participants enrolled in the SUN Study, 525 were 
men; of these, 499 had an adequate HPV result at baseline. Of 
the 499 men included in this analysis, 403 (81%) were MSM 
and 96 (19%) were MSW. Overall, median age was 42 years (in-
terquartile range [IQR] 36–48). Compared with MSM, MSW 
were less likely to be white non-Hispanic (75% vs 33%, P < .001) 
and more likely to be married (33% vs 50%, P = .004) (Table 1). 
Three-hundred and sixteen (78%) MSM and 78 (81%) MSW 
were prescribed cART. Median baseline CD4 cell counts were 
454 cells/mm3 (IQR, 312–655) for MSM and 379 cells/mm3 
(IQR, 237–555) for MSW, P = .055; 74% of MSM and 75% of 
MSW were virologically suppressed (HIV RNA VL < 400 cop-
ies/mL) at baseline. MSM and MSW did not differ markedly in 
terms of behavioral characteristics, except that MSM were more 
likely to have more than 4 sex partners and to report receptive 
anal sex (with or without a condom) in the last 6 months (51% 
vs 2%, P < .001) compared with MSW.
Anal HPV Prevalence
Anal prevalence of HPV was 95% for MSM and 59% for MSW 
(Table 2). High-risk HPV types were detected in 342 (85%) 
MSM and 46 (48%) MSW. Other HPV types were detected in 
357 (89%) MSM and 42 (44%) MSW. Among MSM with detect-
able HPV, the median number of HPV types was 6 (IQR, 3–8) 
for any, 3 (IQR, 1–4) for high-risk, and 3 (IQR, 2–4) for other 
types. Among MSW, the corresponding medians were 2 (IQR, 
2–4), 1 (IQR, 1–2), and 1 (IQR, 0–2). MSM were significantly 
more likely to be infected with a greater number of high-risk 
HPV types (3 versus 1, P < .001) compared with MSW.
The most common HPV types were 16 and 6 among both 
MSM (38% and 29%) and MSW (14% and 11%). The com-
bined prevalence of any HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18 among MSM 
was 67%, and 26% among MSW (Table 3). Forty-nine percent 
of MSM and 82% of MSW had neither HPV type 16 nor 18 
detected. Among MSM and MSW, anal prevalences of HPV 
type 16 were 38% (n = 152) and 14% (n = 13) (P < .001), and 
of HPV type 18 were 24% (n = 97) and 8% (n = 8), (P < .001), 
respectively. Ten percent (n = 42) of MSM and 4% (n = 4) of 
MSW were coinfected with both HPV 16 and 18 types.
The prevalence of HR HPV and median number of HR HPV 
types for men with detectable HPV differed for MSW with CD4 
cell count >500 cells/mm3 (Figure 1A, B). The median number 
of HPV types also did not vary by age. The median numbers 
of types among age groups 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, and ≥50 years 
were 5, 6, 6, and 5 (P = .168), respectively, for MSM, and they 
were 3, 3, 2, and 2.5 (P = .735), respectively, for MSW.
Factors Associated With Prevalent Anal HPV Infection
MSW who were current smokers had a higher risk of HPV 
infection than nonsmokers (odds ratio [OR] = 2.50, 95% CI, 
1.08–6.03, P = .036) (Supplementary Table). In men with de-
tectable HPV, the mean numbers of HPV types among smokers 
compared with nonsmokers were 6.3 and 5.8 (P = .115) among 
MSM, and were 3.6 and 2.9 (P = .127) among MSW. The mean 
numbers of anal HPV types in smokers compared with non-
smokers were 3.3 versus 2.8 (P = .017) for HR types and 3.1 
versus 3.0 (P = .542) for other types among MSM; correspond-
ingly, they were 1.8 versus 1.7 (P = .830) for HR types and 1.7 
versus 1.1 (P = .030) for other types among MSW.
MSM who injected drugs were more likely than those who 
did not inject drugs to have prevalent infection with HPV 16 
(53% vs 36%, P = .024). Compared with MSM without the 
corresponding characteristics, those with rectal Neisseria gon-
orrhea infection (67% vs 24%, P = .009), CD4 cell count <500 
cells/mm3 (29% vs 17%, P = .004), and ≥4 sex partners during 
the 6 months before baseline (33% vs 21%, P = .012) were more 
likely to be infected with prevalent HPV 18.
Anal Incidence of High-Risk 16 and 18 HPV Types
Over 48 months, 45 MSM and 4 MSW had an incident HPV 
type 16 detected, while 33 and 2 had an incident type 18 
detected, respectively. The estimated incidence of HPV type 16 
at 48 months was 24% (95% CI, 18%–31%) for MSM and 7% 
(95% CI, 3%–18%) for MSW (P = .001). For HPV type 18, the 
incidence was 13% (95% CI, 9%–18%) for MSM and 4% (95% 
CI, 1%–15%) for MSW (P = .027). Anal sex in the 6 months 
before baseline (30% vs 11%, P = .010) and consuming alcohol 
in 30 days before baseline (21% vs 9%, P = .026) were associ-
ated with incident HPV 16; marijuana use in 6 months before 
baseline was associated with incident HPV 18 (20% vs 10%, 
P = .031).
Anal Clearance of High-Risk 16 and 18 Types
Clearance, at 48 months, of prevalent HPV type 16 was 31% 
(95% CI, 23%–41%) of MSM and 60% (95% CI, 25%–95%) of

MSW (P = .392) (Figure 2A); for prevalent HPV type 18 anal 
infection, it was 53% (95% CI, 39%–64%) of MSM and 25% 
(95% CI, 4%–87%) of MSW (P = .297) (Figure 2B). Only a 
history of anal sex (with or without a condom) at baseline was 
associated with failure to clear prevalent HPV type 16 in MSM 
(OR 2.24 [95% CI, 1.39–3.60], P < .001). At 48 months, among

 Anal HPV Infection in HIV-Infected Men • JID 2018:217 (15 March) • 957
the subset of MSM who reported history of anal sex (with or 
without a condom), 31% (95% CI, 22%–41%) cleared prevalent 
HPV 16 and 31% (95% CI, 11%–54%) cleared HPV 18.
At 48 months, after an incident HPV type 16 anal infection, 
34% (95% CI, 17%–61%) of MSM cleared their infection; for in-
cident HPV type 18 anal infection, 64% (95% CI, 42%–89%) of 
MSM cleared their infection. There was no significant difference 
between clearance of incident HPV 16 and incident HPV 18 at 
48 months among MSM (34% vs 64%, P = .536) (Figure 2C). 
MSM who reported ever using club drugs, including metham-
phetamine, compared with those who did not were less likely to 
clear incident HPV 16 (20% vs 40%, P = .031).
SIL was more frequently detected in MSM with versus those 
without persistent infection, whether with HPV 16 (42% vs 
29%, P = .013) or with HPV 18 (63% vs 49%, P = .024).
Abnormal Anal Cytology
Among 455 men with adequate anal cytology specimens, 
abnormal cytology (ASCUS or worse) was detected in 206 
(56%) MSM and 17 (20%) MSW (P < .001), and was correlated 
with the presence of HPV (MSM: relative risk [RR] = 3.9, 95% 
CI, 1.2–12.4, P < .001; MSW: RR = 23.8, 95% CI, 1.5–382, 
P < .001). Abnormal anal cytology also correlated with detec-
tion of a HR-HPV type in the anus in both MSM (RR = 2.2, 
95% CI, 1.4–3.3, P < .001) and MSW (RR = 4.6, 95% CI, 1.6–
13.8, P < .001) (Table 4). Detection of anal HPV was sensitive, 
as a predictive factor, for the presence of anal cytologic abnor-
malities (99.0% for MSM, 100% for MSW) but was not spe-
cific (8.6% for MSM, 50.0% for MSW); however, the absence 
of detectable HPV had a high negative predictive value for 
cytologic abnormalities (88% for MSM and 100% for MSW) 
(Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
In this cohort of HIV-infected men, the prevalence of anal HPV 
infection and the number of detected types was lower among 
MSW than MSM. In both groups, each measure correlated with 
the presence of cytologic abnormalities. Compared with HIV-
infected MSW, MSM were more likely to have abnormal anal

with MSW. These data indicate that HIV-infected MSM are at 
increased risk for high-risk anal HPV infection and subsequent 
abnormal cytology compared with HIV-infected MSW.
Risk factors for anal HPV infection differed among MSM and 
MSW. Smoking was the strongest risk factor for HPV infection 
among MSW. Several studies have shown that smoking is asso-
ciated with HPV infection, abnormal anal cytology, and anal 
cancer among HIV-infected men [32–34]. Although smoking 
has been reported to be a significant risk factor for anal disease 
among HIV-infected MSM [35, 36], our data did not corrobo-
rate this finding; however, current smokers were more likely to 
have HPV infection in our cohort [36]. This is likely due to the 
high prevalence of HPV in our cohort of MSM. Smoking, how-
ever, was associated with the detection of a greater mean num-
ber of HPV types among MSM, and the mean number of anal 
other HPV types (not high risk) was higher among MSW smok-
ers compared with nonsmokers. Smoking cessation should be 
encouraged among HIV-infected persons, particularly MSM, 
given the increased risk of HPV-related disease among HIV-
infected smokers.
Injection drug use was associated with prevalent HPV 16 in-
fection among MSM in our cohort, and rectal Neisseria gonorrhea 
infection, CD4 cell count <500 cells/mm3, and >4 sex partners in 
the last 6 months were associated with prevalent HPV 18 infec-
tion. The finding of the effect of low CD4 cell count has been pre-
viously reported [36]. Injection drug use, number of sex partners, 
and rectal Neisseria gonorrhea infection are likely surrogates for 
high-risk behavior that could lead to increased risk of exposure 
to HPV
. Clinicians should consider these factors when evaluating 
HIV-infected MSM for potential HPV infection and/or anal SIL.
Clearance and persistence of high-risk types 16 and 18 did 
not differ between MSM and MSW. However, HPV infection 
persisted longer among the HIV-infected men in our cohort 
compared with HIV-uninfected men in a previous study [37].

 Anal HPV Infection in HIV-Infected Men • JID 2018:217 (15 March) • 959
Among MSM with persistent HPV 16 or 18, SIL in the anus was 
significantly more likely to be detected compared with MSM 
without persistent HPV 16 or 18. Failure to clear prevalent HPV 
16 was associated with receptive anal sex (with or without a con-
dom) and use of club drugs, including methamphetamine. Those 
who reported methamphetamine use were also less likely to clear 
HPV 16. Condomless receptive anal sex is an indicator of risky 
sexual behavior and of increased exposure to HPV. Therefore, 
failure to clear HPV could be related to re-exposure or reinfec-
tion through sexual contacts. The association with methamphet-
amine use is a new finding and relevant because use of this drug 
has been associated with risky sexual behavior [38, 39]. As a 
general practice, MSM should be screened and counseled about 
drug use, which may also help prevent HPV-related anal disease.
The high negative predictive value of HPV nondetection for 
the presence of cytologic abnormalities, especially among MSW 
(for whom predictive values were comparable to those of cervi-
cal HPV detection to detect cervical SIL among HIV-infected 
women) [40], suggests that HPV testing and genotyping might 
be useful in a staged anal cancer screening program to iden-
tify men who may not require anal cytologic examination. Use 
of the HPV vaccine for prevention of infection with multiple 
high-risk HPV types warrants investigation, especially among 
MSW over 26 years of age in whom the opportunities for benefit 
might be greater due to lower rates of prevalent anal infection.
Our study has a number of limitations. Although we enrolled 
relatively few MSW, the number was comparable to or exceeded 
the number included in previous reports, but was not sufficient 
to evaluate risk factors associated with incidence or clearance 
of HPV among MSW. Additionally, we did not have an HIV-
negative cohort of men for comparison, nor did we quantify 
the amount of HPV (ie, number and quantification of virions)

detected. Anal specimens in the SUN study were collected 
annually, and therefore HPV incidence may be overestimated 
and may reflect transient carriage of HPV in some instances. 
Similarly, we were unable to distinguish reinfection from failure 
to clear. Our analysis of SIL was based on cytology and not on 
high-resolution anoscopy-guided tissue biopsies. We therefore 
cannot correlate anal cytology with detection of biopsy-proven 
anal SIL, which is considered to be the gold standard for deter-
mining disease severity. We also cannot determine the causal 
relationships between abnormal anal cytology and either the 
presence of HPV or the number of HPV types detected.
In conclusion, we assessed HPV prevalence, incidence, and 
clearance among contemporary HIV-infected MSM compared 
with MSW. We also examined risk factors among MSM for prev-
alent, incident, and cleared anal HPV infection. Early treatment 
of HIV infection to limit the degree of immunosuppression 
experienced by the patient, as well as HPV vaccination [28, 41, 
42], are 2 important prevention strategies for anal SIL and can-
cer. HIV-infected men should also be counseled on drug use, 
safe sex practices, and smoking cessation to reduce modifiable 
risk factors for anal disease. Lastly, these data may be relevant for 
anal screening protocols and may support the use of HPV testing 
and genotyping in men at high risk for developing anal cancer.
