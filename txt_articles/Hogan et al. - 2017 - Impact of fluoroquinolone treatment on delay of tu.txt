Background: Fluoroquinolones are among the most commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of respi- 
ratory infections. Because fluoroquinolones show bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
, 
there is concern that their use can delay the diagnosis of tuberculosis. We conducted a systematic review 
and meta-analysis to assess whether empiric treatment with fluoroquinolones delays the diagnosis and 
treatment of tuberculosis in patients with respiratory tract infections. 
Objectives: The primary objective was to assess the delay in days in the diagnosis and treatment of tuber- 
culosis, among patients who received quinolones, compared to those who received non-fluoroquinolone 
antibiotics. 
Methods: We included studies of adult patients treated with fluoroquinolones prior to a confirmed di- 
agnosis of tuberculosis. We performed a literature search of 7 databases (including PubMed, Embase and 
Cochrane Library) with no language restrictions. We calculated an unweighted mean of estimate of dif- 
ference in delay across all studies. For the studies for which the estimate was available as a mean with 
standard deviation, a weighted average using a random effects meta-analysis model was estimated. 
Results: A total of 3983 citations were identified from the literature search; of these, 17 articles were 
selected for full-text review. A total of 10 studies were retained for the synthesis. These included 7 ret- 
rospective cohort studies and 3 case-control studies. Only one of these studies was from a high TB bur- 
den country, South Africa. The most commonly used fluoroquinolones were levofloxacin, gemifloxacin 
and moxifloxacin. The unweighted average of difference in delay between the fluoroquinolone group and 
non-fluoroquinolone group was 12.9 days (95% CI 6.1–19.7). When these differences were pooled using a 
random effects model, the weighted estimate was 10.9 days (95% CI 4.2–17.6). When stratified by acid-fast 
smear status, the delay was consistently greater in the smear-negative group. 
Conclusion: Although results are variable, the use of fluoroquinolones in patients with respiratory infec- 
tions seems to delay the diagnosis of TB by nearly two weeks. Consistent with the International Standards 
for TB Care, their use should be avoided when tuberculosis is suspected.

that their use can delay the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The literature 
on this topic has yielded variable results regarding this association. 
The International Standards for TB Care recommend against the use 
of fluoroquinolones in adults with suspected tuberculosis [2] 
; how- 
ever, these recommendations may not be followed consistently, as 
shown in recent simulated patient studies from India [3,4] 
. More- 
over, both the IDSA/ATS as well as the European guidelines for the 
treatment of community-acquired pneumonia include respiratory 
fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin or levofloxacin) as a 
first-line treatment option for patient with co-morbidities [5, 6] 
.

∗ The definition of delay varied between the studies: time of sputum collection to initiation of anti-TB medications: 2 studies; presentation to initiation of anti-TB 
medications: 5 studies; time of initiation of antibiotics to initiation of anti-TB medications: 2 studies; time of sputum collection to culture growth: 1 study 
since then, new studies have been published, warranting an up- 
dated systematic review. 
2. Methods 
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess 
whether empiric treatment with fluoroquinolones delays the diag- 
nosis and treatment of tuberculosis in patients with lower respira- 
tory tract infections. 
The primary objective was to assess the delay in days in the 
diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis, among patients who re- 
ceived fluoroquinolones, compared to those who were treated with 
non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics. We aimed to limit selection bias 
by restricting the comparison to patients who had received non- 
fluoroquinolone antibiotics only instead of patients who had not 
received any antibiotics. This was done to ensure comparability of 
both groups as patients may be subject to differential prescribing 
patterns and medical investigation procedures depending on their 
pre-test probability of tuberculo-sis as determined by their treating 
physician. 
We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re- 
views and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [8] for the planning 
and execution of this study. With the assistance of a medical li- 
brarian (GG), we performed a literature search of seven databases 
(PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Bio- 
sis and Global health) with no language restrictions through to

August 8th 2016. We excluded case series of less than 10 patients, 
as well as articles for which either the full text or information on 
diagnostic delay was not available. 
The titles and abstracts of identified articles were screened in- 
dependently by two reviewers (CH and LP) based on a prespeci- 
fied protocol. Publications identified as relevant by at least one re- 
viewer were searched for full-text appraisal. Two reviewers com- 
pleted full-text evaluations, selected articles, and extracted the 
data independently. Study quality assessment was performed by 
two reviewers using a tool ( 
Table 1 
) developed at McGill Univer- 
sity for TB diagnostic delay studies [9] 
. Disagreement was resolved 
by consensus. Study authors were contacted in case of ambiguity 
or missing data, and for clarification of study methodology. 
The data were analyzed with the use of Stata version 12.1 (Stat- 
acorp, Texas, USA). The main outcome for the analysis was delay 
in time of presentation to time of start of anti-tuberculosis therapy 
in the fluoroquinolone group compared to the non-fluoroquinolone 
group. The threshold for statistical significance was set at a p- 
value of 0.05. First, an unweighted average of the estimate of de- 
lay was calculated for all studies. Second, for the studies for which 
the estimate was available as a mean with standard deviation, a 
weighted average using a random effects meta-analysis model was 
estimated. 
3. Results 
A total of 3983 citations were identified from the literature 
search; of these, 17 articles were selected for full-text review. A 
total of 10 studies were retained for the synthesis ( 
Fig. 1 
). These 
included 7 retrospective cohort studies and 3 case-control studies. 
Only one of the 10 studies was from a high TB burden country, 
South Africa. A total of 18,179 patients were included in the 10 
studies. The proportion of male participants in the studies ranged 
from 54 to 99%; HIV seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 58%. The 
most commonly used fluoroquinolones were levofloxacin, gemi- 
floxacin, moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. 
For most studies, study quality was considered fair for the def- 
inition of delay and for the definition of confirmation of diagnosis 
 6 
C.A. Hogan et al.

( 
Table 1 
). There was limited information available regarding patient 
sampling methods, as well as strategies to deal with potential con- 
founders. In addition, most studies did not adjust their estimates 
of diagnostic delay by potential confounders. 
The mean difference in delay in time of presentation to time 
of start of anti-tuberculosis therapy in the fluoroquinolone group 
compared to the non-fluoroquinolone group varied from 0d to 28d 
across the 10 studies ( 
Table 2 
). The unweighted average of differ- 
ence in delay was 12.9 days (95% CI 6.1–19.7). The estimate of de- 
lay was available as a mean with standard deviation for five of the 
ten studies. When the differences for these studies were pooled us- 
ing a random effects model, the weighted estimate was 10.9 days 
(95% CI 4.2–17.6). When stratified by acid-fast smear status, the de- 
lay was consistently greater in the smear-negative group. Based on 
one study, there was suggestion of a proportional increase in the 
diagnostic delay based on the duration of fluoroquinolone expo- 
sure (18.3 days in the one-day exposure group; 23.1 days in the 
≥ 5 
day group). However, there was overlap in the confidence intervals 
around these estimates. Heterogeneity in the study design and out- 
comes was present although this was not statistically evaluated. 
4. Discussion 
A previous systematic review and meta-analysis on this topic 
was published in 2011 [7] 
, and reported a mean diagnostic delay 
of 19.0 days (95% CI 10.9–27.2). This systematic review serves as an 
update with the addition of six new studies. Our mean diagnostic 
delay of 12.9 days (95% CI 6.1–19.7) also supports fluoroquinolones 
contributing to the diagnostic delay of tuberculosis. However, het- 
erogeneity across studies suggests that this pooled estimate must 
be interpreted with caution. 
The most plausible mechanism to explain this observed delay 
relates to the bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against My- 
cobacterium tuberculosis [17] 
, thus delaying the diagnosis of tuber- 
culosis. Moreover, fluoroquinolones may transiently improve the 
respiratory symptoms of tuberculosis, also contributing to delay. In 
vitro experiments have demonstrated that the bactericidal power 
of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against Mycobacterium tuberculo- 
sis far outweighs that of ciprofloxacin [10] 
. 
The potent bactericidal activity of moxifloxacin in patients with 
pulmonary tuberculosis has made it a candidate of choice for the 
new short-course studied regimens, including PAMZ (pretomanid, 
moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide; currently in phase (3) and BPaMZ 
(bedaquiline, pretomanid, moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide; cur- 
rently in advanced phase (2). As such, there is a compelling drive 
to protect quinolones from possible emerging resistance, an out- 
come this study did not assess. 
The suggestion of a proportional relationship between the du- 
ration of fluoroquinolone exposure and delay in tuberculosis diag- 
nosis is interesting and deserves further attention. The only study 
[15] that reported on the diagnostic delay of tuberculosis as a func- 
tion of time categorized fluoroquinolone use by 1 day, 2–4 days 
and 
≥ 5 days. There was a trend toward longer diagnostic delay in 
the group treated for 
≥ 5 days compared to the two other groups; 
however, the confidence intervals overlapped around these esti- 
mates. This suggests that there may be a benefit in stopping the 
fluoroquinolone at the beginning of treatment if one thinks of tu- 
berculosis as a diagnostic possibility even after the start of empiric 
antibacterial treatment. 
Our study presents certain limitations. In particular, there was 
important variation in study settings, patient populations and in 
the definitions of delay used for the studies. Generalizability may 
also be limited given that only one study was from a high TB inci- 
dence country. Most studies reported delay as defined by the time 
to initiation of treatment; as such, the extra time between time of 
diagnosis and time of initiation of treatment is not adequately cap- 
tured. In addition, data were lacking on variables such as delay in 
obtaining a diagnostic procedure (bronchoscopy or sputum induc- 
tion), and on potential confounders (e.g. smear status, previous tu- 
berculosis). Sufficient information was not available to stratify the 
meta-analysis diagnostic delay estimate by HIV status. 
Furthermore, we attempted to limit bias by restricting the 
comparison to patients who had received antibiotics only. Un- 
fortunately, this restriction was not possible for two studies 
[17,20] where the groups were mixed with those having received 
non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics, and those not having received an- 
tibiotics. This information was not available for one study [15] 
. We 
recognize that physician behavior may play an important role in 
accelerating or not the investigations for a patient depending on 
the underlying suspicion of tuberculosis. 
Finally, the study with the largest number of patients did not 
include culture diagnosis as necessary for inclusion in the study; 
this may have decreased power to detect a significant difference 
between the fluoroquinolone and non-fluoroquinolone groups. In 
addition, the approximation that medians and means were similar 
may not have been valid in the context of non-normally distributed 
data. 
5. Conclusion 
Although the available literature has several limitations and 
study results are heterogeneous, the evidence suggests that the use 
of fluoroquinolones in patients with respiratory infections might 
delay the diagnosis of active pulmonary TB by nearly 2 weeks. 
Consistent with the International Standards for TB Care, their use 
should be avoided when tuberculosis is suspected.
