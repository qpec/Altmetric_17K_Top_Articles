Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause serious 
brain abnormalities, but the full range of adverse outcomes is 
unknown (1). To better understand the impact of birth defects 
resulting from Zika virus infection, the CDC surveillance case 
definition established in 2016 for birth defects potentially 
related to Zika virus infection* (2) was retrospectively applied 
to population-based birth defects surveillance data collected 
during 2013–2014 in three areas before the introduction of Zika 
virus (the pre-Zika years) into the World Health Organization’s 
Region of the Americas (Americas) (3). These data, from 
Massachusetts (2013), North Carolina (2013), and Atlanta, 
Georgia (2013–2014), included 747 infants and fetuses with one 
or more of the birth defects meeting the case definition (pre-Zika 
prevalence = 2.86 per 1,000 live births). Brain abnormalities 
or microcephaly were the most frequently recorded (1.50 per 
1,000), followed by neural tube defects and other early brain 
malformations† (0.88), eye abnormalities without mention of 
a brain abnormality (0.31), and other consequences of central 
nervous system (CNS) dysfunction without mention of brain 
or eye abnormalities (0.17). During January 15–September 22, 
2016, the U.S. Zika Pregnancy Registry (USZPR) reported 26 
infants and fetuses with these same defects among 442 completed 
pregnancies (58.8 per 1,000) born to mothers with laboratory 
evidence of possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy (2). 
Although the ascertainment methods differed, this finding 
was approximately 20 times higher than the proportion of one 
or more of the same birth defects among pregnancies during 
the pre-Zika years. These data demonstrate the importance of 
population-based surveillance for interpreting data about birth 
defects potentially related to Zika virus infection.
Statewide data from birth defects surveillance programs in 
Massachusetts and North Carolina for 2013 and from a sur-
veillance program in three counties in metropolitan Atlanta, 
Georgia, for 2013–2014 were chosen for analysis because 
these programs conducted population-based surveillance for 
all types of birth defects, used active multisource case-finding, 
and were rapidly able to provide individual-level data with 
sufficient detail to apply all inclusion and exclusion criteria 
(4). Trained staff members in these surveillance programs rou-
tinely reviewed the medical records of infants and fetuses with 
birth defects and abstracted information about those defects, 
related diagnostic procedures, and demographic and pregnancy 
information. Included were all infants and fetuses who were 
identified through surveillance with a birth defect character-
ized by CDC subject matter experts as being consistent with 
those observed in cases of congenital Zika virus infection (2). 
Additional data collected included the pregnancy outcome 
(live birth or pregnancy loss), maternal age, gestational age at 
delivery, and verbatim clinical descriptions of all birth defects, 
including genetic abnormalities. These verbatim descriptions 
were reviewed by CDC subject matter experts to verify the 
case definition and categorization. The earliest age that a 
birth defect meeting the definition was noted (i.e., prenatally, 
≤28 days after delivery, 29 days to <3 months after delivery, 
≥3 to <6 months after delivery, and ≥6 months after delivery) 
was available for data from Massachusetts and Atlanta.
Infants or fetuses with birth defects were aggregated into four 
mutually exclusive categories of defects characterized by CDC 
subject matter experts as being consistent with those observed 
with congenital Zika virus infection: 1) brain abnormalities or 
microcephaly (head circumference at delivery <3rd percentile 
for sex and gestational age) (5); 2) neural tube defects and other 
early brain malformations; 3) eye abnormalities without men-
tion of a brain abnormality included in the first two categories; 
and 4) other consequences of CNS dysfunction, specifically 
joint contractures and congenital sensorineural deafness, 
without mention of brain or eye abnormalities included in 
another category. Baseline prevalence per 1,000 live births 
(6) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using 
Poisson regression.

* The Zika surveillance case definition covers all birth defects that have been 
reported as potentially related to Zika virus infection and includes brain 
abnormalities such as microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, fetal brain 
disruption sequence, abnormal cortical formation, and porencephaly, among 
others; neural tube defects and other early brain malformations, such as 
anencephaly, spina bifida, encephalocele, and holoprosencephaly; eye 
abnormalities, such as microphthalmia/anophthalmia, cataracts, chorioretinal 
and optic nerve abnormalities, among others; and consequences of central 
nervous system dysfunction, such as joint contractures and congenital 
sensorineural deafness.
† Neural tube defects and other early brain malformations are included as 
biologically plausible birth defects; however, they have been reported much less 
frequently with Zika virus infection than defects in the other categories.

The three birth defects surveillance programs identified 
747 infants and fetuses during 2013 (North Carolina and 
Massachusetts) and 2013–2014 (Atlanta) with one or more 
defects that met the 2016 CDC Zika surveillance case defini-
tion (2.86 per 1,000 live births [CI = 2.65–3.07]) (Table). 
Brain abnormalities or microcephaly accounted for the largest 
number (392 [52%]) and highest prevalence (1.50 per 1,000), 
followed by neural tube defects and other early brain malforma-
tions (229 [31%]; 0.88). Eye abnormalities without mention 
of a brain abnormality (81 [11%]; 0.31) and consequences of 
CNS dysfunction without mention of brain or eye abnormali-
ties (45 [6%]; 0.17) were less frequent. Pregnancy losses (48%) 
and preterm delivery (<37 weeks’ gestation) (66%) occurred 
most frequently with neural tube defects and other early brain 
malformations. In contrast, all infants with eye abnormalities 
without mention of a brain abnormality were liveborn.
In general, the distribution by maternal age was similar 
across birth defect categories. Among 410 (55%) infants or 
fetuses with information on the earliest age a birth defect was 
recorded, 371 (90%) had evidence of a birth defect meeting 
the Zika definition before age 3 months. More than half of 
those with brain abnormalities or microcephaly or with neural 
tube defects and other early brain malformations had evidence 
of these defects noted prenatally (55% and 89%, respectively).
Discussion
A congenital Zika syndrome phenotype has been described 
(7); however, the birth defects observed are not unique to 
congenital Zika virus infection, and the full range of effects 
of congenital Zika infection is not known. The data in this 
report provide a baseline reference for the prevalence of defects 
observed with congenital Zika virus infection in the pre-Zika 
years and demonstrate the importance of data on birth defects 
prevalence in providing a context within which to assess the 
impact of teratogenic exposures such as Zika virus infec-
tion. Recently published data from the USZPR reported 26 
infants and fetuses with these same birth defects among 442 
completed pregnancies with laboratory evidence of Zika virus 
infection during a 9-month period in 2016. This proportion 
(58.8 per 1,000) is approximately 20 times higher than the

prevalence (2.86 per 1,000) from the three population-based 
birth defects surveillance programs during the pre-Zika years. 
In addition, of the 26 USZPR infants and fetuses, 22 had a 
brain abnormality or microcephaly (2). This proportion (49.8 
per 1,000; CI = 33.1–74.8) is approximately 33 times higher 
than the prevalence (1.5 per 1,000) among pregnancies in the 
pre-Zika years.
A recently published report from New York took a somewhat 
different approach to establishing a pre-Zika baseline for con-
genital birth defects. It examined diagnoses of microcephaly, 
but not other defects, for the period 2013–2015 and found 
that, before evidence of importation of Zika virus infections, 
the overall prevalence of microcephaly in New York was 7.4 
per 10,000 live births (0.74 per 1,000), and the prevalence of 
severe congenital microcephaly (newborn head circumference 
<3rd percentile for sex and gestational age) was 4.2 per 10,000 
(0.42 per 1,000) (8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limita-
tions. First, population-based surveillance programs strive to 
ascertain the prevalence of birth defects among all members 
of a specified population. In contrast, the aim of USZPR is 
to estimate the proportion of birth defects among pregnancies 
with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection, a 
specific subgroup of the general population (2). This could 
lead to selection bias with USZPR if, for example, pregnan-
cies with fetal abnormalities detected prenatally were more 
likely to be tested for Zika virus and reported. Second, birth 
defects surveillance programs identify diagnoses among 
infants and fetuses mostly through review of administrative 
records, often at inpatient facilities. Although these programs 
use multisource ascertainment, some birth defects could be 
missed if they were prenatally diagnosed or if infants were 
delivered at sites outside of the usual ascertainment sources, 
if infants were evaluated solely in outpatient settings, or if 
some birth defect diagnoses did not receive an administrative 
code. In contrast, USZPR receives reports of pregnant women 
with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection and 
resulting fetal and infant outcomes. The prospective nature of 
this ascertainment and direct follow-up of individual reported 
pregnancies could result in closer scrutiny of the outcomes 
and more frequent and detailed detection of abnormalities 
than is typical with population-based birth defects surveil-
lance programs. Third, data from these three birth defects sur-
veillance programs might not be generalizable to the United 
States. The USZPR-published data included reports from 
any of the U.S states and the District of Columbia. Also, it is 
possible that some pregnancies with Zika virus infection were 
present in the birth defects surveillance populations during 
the pre-Zika years as a result of travel to areas with Zika virus 
outside the Americas. Fourth, birth defects surveillance pro-
grams traditionally do not ascertain diagnoses from settings 
where congenital deafness is diagnosed; therefore, these data 
likely do not include the majority of infants with congenital 
sensorineural deafness. Fifth, published data from USZPR on 
the proportion of infants and fetuses with other types of birth 
defects that are not thought to result from congenital Zika 
virus infection are not available, making it impossible to assess 
differences in the frequency of other birth defects. Finally, 
published data from USZPR include many pregnancies with 
unspecified flavivirus infections, and thus the estimates of 
the proportion with birth defects potentially related to Zika 
virus infection might underestimate the actual Zika impact, 
given that some included pregnant women likely had other 
flavivirus infections, increasing the size of the denominator.
The birth defects surveillance data in this report were 
compiled from a period before introduction of Zika virus in 
the Americas, using the CDC surveillance case definition of 
birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection; this 
is the same case definition adopted by USZPR. The higher 
proportion of these defects among pregnancies with laboratory 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Zika virus infection causes serious brain abnormalities; however, 
the birth defects observed are not unique to congenital Zika 
virus infection, and the full range of effects of congenital Zika 
infection is not known.
What is added by this report?
CDC used data from population-based birth defects surveil-
lance programs in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Atlanta, 
Georgia, to retrospectively assess the prevalence of birth 
defects during 2013–2014 that met the surveillance case 
definition for birth defects potentially related to Zika virus 
infection, before introduction of Zika virus into the United 
States. After introduction of Zika virus, the proportion of infants 
and fetuses with birth defects born to mothers with laboratory 
evidence of possible Zika infection reported by the US Zika 
Pregnancy Registry during January 15–September 22, 2016, was 
approximately 20 times higher than the prevalence of poten-
tially Zika-related birth defects among pregnancies during the 
pre-Zika years.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Data on birth defects in the pre-Zika years serve as benchmarks 
to direct rapid ascertainment and reporting of birth defects 
potentially related to Zika virus infection. The higher proportion 
of these defects among pregnancies with laboratory evidence 
of possible Zika virus infection supports the relationship 
between congenital Zika virus infection and birth defects.

evidence of Zika infection in USZPR supports the relation-
ship between congenital Zika virus infection and these birth 
defects (1,2). These data demonstrate the critical contribution 
of population-based birth defects surveillance to understanding 
the impact of Zika virus infection during pregnancy. In 2016, 
CDC provided funding for 45 local, state, and territorial health 
departments to conduct rapid population-based surveillance 
for defects potentially related to Zika virus infection, which 
will provide essential data to monitor the impact of Zika virus 
infection in the United States.
