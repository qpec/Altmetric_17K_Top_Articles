Curcumin, a yellow pigment in the Indian spice Turmeric (Curcuma longa), which is chemically known as diferuloylmethane, was
first isolated exactly two centuries ago in 1815 by two German Scientists, Vogel and Pelletier. However, according to the pubmed
database, the first study on its biological activity as an antibacterial agent was published in 1949 in Nature and the first clinical trial
was reported in The Lancet in 1937. Although the current database indicates almost 9000 publications on curcumin, until 1990
there were less than 100 papers published on this nutraceutical. At the molecular level, this multitargeted agent has been shown
to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity through the suppression of numerous cell signalling pathways including NF-κB, STAT3, Nrf2,
ROS and COX-2. Numerous studies have indicated that curcumin is a highly potent antimicrobial agent and has been shown to be
active against various chronic diseases including various types of cancers, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular, pulmonary, neuro-
logical and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, this compound has also been shown to be synergistic with other nutraceuticals
such as resveratrol, piperine, catechins, quercetin and genistein. To date, over 100 different clinical trials have been completed
with curcumin, which clearly show its safety, tolerability and its effectiveness against various chronic diseases in humans. How-
ever, more clinical trials in different populations are necessary to prove its potential against different chronic diseases in humans.
This review’s primary focus is on lessons learnt about curcumin from clinical trials.

 Introduction
Despite
the
substantial
advances
in
the
treatment
of
complex, multigenic and chronic human diseases, their
occurrence rate has increased significantly in recent times
(Gupta et al., 2012). A number of mono-targeted therapies,
also referred to as ‘smart drugs’, have been designed over
the past few years for the treatment of these chronic diseases.
However, complex diseases like cardiovascular, metabolic,
cancer and neurological diseases occur due to perturbations
of multiple signalling pathways. Therefore, targeting a single
pathway among many of the pathways involved is not likely
to be effective for the prevention and treatment of these
diseases (Bordoloi et al., 2016). Besides, high cost and adverse
side effects are the other major disadvantages associated with
these smart drugs. These limitations necessitate the urge to
develop
multi-targeted,
cost-effective,
readily
available,
non-toxic and highly potent agents for the management of
different human diseases (Gupta et al., 2012).
Among the numerous natural remedies, turmeric has
gained considerable attention due to its profound medicinal
values (Prasad et al., 2014a). This agent possesses antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory,
anticancer,
antigrowth,
antiarthritic,
antiatherosclerotic, antidepressant, antiaging, antidiabetic,
antimicrobial,
wound
healing
and
memory-enhancing
activities (Aggarwal et al., 2013a). Moreover, it exerts chemo-
preventive, chemosensitization and radiosensitization effects
as well (Goel and Aggarwal, 2010; Gupta et al., 2011a). In
traditional Indian medicine, this spice has been also used to
treat different ailments such as gynecological problems, gas-
tric problems, hepatic disorders, infectious diseases, blood
disorders, acne, psoriasis, dermatitis, rash and other chronic
ailments (Gupta et al., 2013a). Diverse in vivo studies have also
indicated its potential against pro-inflammatory diseases,
cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, depression, diabetes,
obesity and atherosclerosis (Gupta et al., 2013c). Among the
huge number of compounds isolated from turmeric (Tyagi
et al., 2015), curcumin (a diferuloylmethane) was found to
be the most widely studied compound as evinced by more
than 9000 citations in the literature. It was first discovered
by Vogel and Pelletier from the rhizomes of turmeric
(Curcuma longa) (Prasad et al., 2014b). Structurally, it can exist
in at least two tautomeric forms, keto and enol and they
possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antivi-
ral,
antibacterial
and
antidiabetic
properties
(Aggarwal
et al., 2008; Goel et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2010; Gupta
et al., 2012; Aggarwal et al., 2013b; Rainey et al., 2015).
These traits can possibly be attributed to the methoxy, hy-
droxyl, α, β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety or diketone groups
present in curcumin (Aggarwal et al., 2015). Besides its safety
and tolerability, cost-effectiveness is an added advantage of
this compound (Shoba et al., 1998; Rasyid and Lelo, 1999;
Rasyid et al., 2002; Lao et al., 2006; Tuntipopipat et al., 2006;

 2014; Klickovic et al., 2014). Because of its amazing properties,
curcumin is being marketed in several countries of the world
in various forms (Prasad et al., 2014b).
However, the utility of curcumin is greatly hindered by its
colour, lack of water solubility and low bioavailability (Anand
et al., 2008). Prime factors contributing towards the low bio-
availability of curcumin in both plasma and tissue might be
associated with its poor absorption, rapid metabolism and
rapid systemic elimination. Therefore, to enhance these,
various approaches have been sought that include the use of
adjuvants, liposomal curcumin, curcumin nanoparticles,
curcumin phospholipid complexes, curcumin reformulated
with various oils and with inhibitors of metabolism, conjuga-
tion of curcumin prodrugs and linking curcumin with poly-
ethylene glycol (Anand et al., 2007; 2008; Goel et al., 2008;
Nair et al., 2010). The use of structural analogues of curcumin
and synthesis of ‘man-made’ curcumin analogues also play a
role in the enhancement of its bioavailability. For instance,
the natural analogues of curcumin such as demethoxycurcu-
min and bidemethoxycurcumin were reported to have a sim-
ilar biological activity to curcumin (Kocaadam and Şanlier,
2015). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the presence
of an active methylene group and β-diketone moiety causes
curcumin to be unstable under physiological conditions
together with its poor absorption and rapid metabolism.
Supporting
this
proposal,
more
recently,
different
structural modifications were performed and many of the
active
methylene
and
carbonyl
substituted
curcumin
derivatives/analogues were found to exert much improved
antioxidant activity when compared with curcumin (Sahu
et al., 2016). Thus, diverse synthetic derivatives of curcumin
can
be
obtained
with
various
chemical
modifications
including phenolic hydroxyl groups, acylation, alkylation,
glycosylation and amino acylation to improve its bioavail-
ability (Kocaadam and Şanlier, 2015).
Molecular targets of curcumin
Curcumin can impact a diverse range of molecular targets and
signalling pathways, which augment the efficacy of existing
chemotherapeutic agents (Figure 1). It can interact with a
huge number of different proteins such as nuclear factor
E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), β-catenin, NF-κB, p38 MAPK, DNA
(cytosine-5)-methyltransferase-1,
COX-2,
5-lipoxygenase,
PGE2, FOXO3, inducible NOS, ROS, cyclin D1, VEGF, gluta-
thione, cytosolic PLA2, p-Tau (p-τ) and TNF-α. This ability of
curcumin facilitiates selective modulation of multiple cell
signalling pathways linked to different chronic diseases,
which strongly suggest that it is a potent multi-targeted
polyphenol (Anand et al., 2008; Kunnumakkara et al., 2008;
Ravindran et al., 2009; Goel and Aggarwal, 2010; Hasima
and Aggarwal, 2012; Aggarwal et al., 2015; Rainey et al.,
2015). The common molecular targets of curcumin include
transcription
factors,
inflammatory
mediators,
protein
kinases and enzymes like protein reductases and histone
acetyltransferase (Goel et al., 2008; Yadav and Aggarwal,
2011; Gupta et al., 2011b; 2012). A plausible mechanism
through which curcumin exerts its manifold effects might
be via epigenetic regulation (Tuorkey, 2014). Many recent
studies have reported curcumin as a potent epigenetic
regulator in different diseases, such as neurological disorders,
inflammation, diabetes and different cancer types. The
epigenetic regulatory roles of curcumin primarily include
inhibition of DNA methyltransferases, regulation of histone
modifications via effects on histone acetyltransferases and
histone deacetylases and regulation of micro RNAs (Reuter
et al., 2011; Boyanapalli and Tony Kong, 2015; Remely et al.,
2015). Curcumin also modulates various proteosomal path-
ways (Hasima and Aggarwal, 2014) and impairs glycogen me-
tabolism through selective inhibition of phosphorylase
kinase (Reddy and Aggarwal, 1994). Nonetheless, it has been
shown
to
exhibit
anti-inflammatory
effects
by
down-
regulating various cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8,
IL-12, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (also
known as CCL2) and IL-1β, and various inflammatory
enzymes and transcription factors (Bharti et al., 2004; Davis
et al., 2007; Aggarwal and Sung, 2009; Gupta et al., 2011a;
2014).
Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have shown the
effectiveness of curcumin in the prevention and treatment of
various human diseases; however, the main focus of this
review is the lessons learnt from clinical trials.
Clinical studies with curcumin
Encouraging outcomes of preclinical studies have engen-
dered ample clinical trials of curcumin to evaluate its safety
and efficacy against a diverse range of human diseases
(Figure 2; Tables 1 and 2). Approximately 120 clinical trials
have been successfully carried out so far, involving more than
6000 human participants. In addition, there are several
systematic reviews/meta-analyses based on the clinical trials
of curcumin for human data (Table 2).
Safety and adequate daily intake (ADI) value of
curcumin as well as its derivatives
In general the consumption of curcumin is considered to be
safe. As per JECFA (The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee
on
Food
Additives)
and
EFSA
(European
Food
Safety
Authority)
reports,
the
ADI
value
of
curcumin
is
0–3 mg·kg�1 (Kocaadam and Şanlier, 2015). In addition, the
safety and efficacy of curcumin was evaluated in several clin-
ical trials involving healthy human subjects. For instance, in
one such study in healthy human volunteers, the effect of
curcumin combined with piperine was measured; this in-
creased the bioavailabilty of curcumin by approximately
2000% without causing any adverse effects (Shoba et al.,
1998). Furthermore, curcumin was found to exhibit positive
cholekinetic effect as it induced a significant contraction of
the human gall-bladder (Rasyid and Lelo, 1999). At the dos-
age of 40 mg, curcumin evoked a 50% contraction of the gall
bladder (Rasyid et al., 2002). A dose-response study was un-
dertaken to detect the maximum tolerated dose and safety
of a single dose of standardized powder extract; uniformly-
milled curcumin was administered to healthy volunteers at
doses ranging from 500 to 12 000 mg and it was found to be
profoundly well tolerated (Lao et al., 2006). Concomitant ad-
ministration of curcumin and talinolol reduced the bioavail-
ability of talinolol possibly due to the low intraluminal
curcumin concentration or an up-regulation of further

 ATP-binding cassette transporters in different tissues (Juan
et al., 2007). Another study was attempted to evaluate the
pharmacokinetics of a curcumin preparation in healthy
human volunteers for up to 72 h following a single oral dose
of curcumin. It was found to be absorbed after oral dosing in
humans and was detected in plasma as glucuronide and
sulfate conjugates (Vareed et al., 2008). Moreover, dietary
turmeric was shown to activate bowel motility as well as
carbohydrate colonic fermentation (Shimouchi et al., 2009).
In addition, the ingestion of a capsule containing curcumin
(30%), resveratrol (15%), EGCG (30%) and soybean extract
(25%) was found to exert a protective effect against oxidative
stress in normal healthy adults (Dominiak et al., 2010). Treat-
ment with curcumin (500 mg·day�1) also markedly lowers
serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in healthy human
subjects (Pungcharoenkul and Thongnopnua, 2011). The effi-
cacy of curcumin dispersed with colloidal nano-particles,
known as Theracurmin was also investigated in terms of
absorption and was compared with that of curcumin powder.
However, the former showed a much higher bioavailability
and thus may be of immense use with ample clinical benefits
in humans even at a very low dose (Sasaki et al., 2011).
Meriva,
the

of
a
standardized
curcuminoid mixture also exhibited a much improved ab-
sorption and plasma curcuminoid profile at significantly
lower doses (Cuomo et al., 2011). Another trial in healthy
middle aged people showed that treatment with curcumin
caused a marked reduction in plasma triglyceride values,

Regular endurance exercise together with daily curcumin ad-
ministration caused a marked reduction in left ventricular
afterload (Sugawara et al., 2012). A formulation of curcumin
in combination with a hydrophilic carrier, cellulosic deriva-
tives and natural antioxidants was shown to enhance the
bioavailability of curcumin in blood (Jager et al., 2014). On
the other hand, another study indicated that the short
term use of a piperine-enhanced curcuminoid preparation is

 ineffective at producing a clinically significant interaction in-
volving CYP3A, CYP2C9 or the paracetamol conjugation en-
zymes (Volak et al., 2013). Also in another clinical trial, oral
curcumin administration was linked with poor bioavailabil-
ity and was shown not to increase haemoxygenase 1 (HO-1)
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Klickovic et al., 2014).
Curcumin for cancer
Cancer is one of the prime health concerns today, affecting
people of all ages worldwide. The first clinical trial on
curcumin was done by Kuttan and colleagues in 1987 by en-
rolling 62 patients with external cancerous lesions to investi-
gate its potential against cancer. An ethanolic extract of
turmeric and an ointment of curcumin caused significant
symptomatic relief in these patients along with a reduction
in itching and smell. In 70% of the patients, dry lesions were
observed and in a few cases, a reduction in lesion size and
pain was observed (Kuttan et al., 1987). Henceforth, numer-
ous clinical trials have been carried out using curcumin and
its ability to affect multiple targets has enabled it to exert no-
table activities against different cancer types in human clini-
cal trials (Gupta et al., 2012).
Cervical cancer
.
Cervical cancer is the second most common
form
of
malignancy
in
women
worldwide.
Curcumin
exhibits potent effects against this cancer in vitro, in vivo and
in
clinical
settings.
From
an
initial
study,
a
dose
of
500–12 000 mg·day�1 of curcumin was found to be safe,
well tolerated and have chemopreventive properties against
cervical cancer (Cheng et al., 2001). In another study, when
HPV-positive cervical neoplasia patients were treated with
Basant polyherbal vaginal cream (containing extracts of
curcumin, reetha, amla and Aloe vera), HPV clearance rate
was found to be significantly high with no adverse side
effects (Basu et al., 2013). These studies showed curcumin to
be a safe and efficacious compound for the prevention and
treatment of cervical cancer.
Colon cancer
.
Colon cancer ranks third among the most
commonly
occurring
cancers
in
the
world.
Despite
significant advances in cancer therapy, mortality from colon
cancer persists at the same level, highlighting the necessity
of improved therapies (Nautiyal et al., 2011). The efficacy of
oral curcumin (2 g or 4 g daily for 30 days) in the
prevention of colorectal neoplasia was evaluated in a
nonrandomized,
open-label
clinical
trial
enrolling
44
patients. The results showed a marked reduction in ACF
number with 4 g dose of curcumin, which was possibly
associated with its increased bioavailabity (fivefold) in
plasma (Carroll et al., 2011). A dose-response study was
designed to investigate the pharmacology of curcumin in
humans with doses ranging from 0.45–3.6 g·day�1 up to
4 months. A dose of 3.6 g curcumin per day caused 62 and

respectively with no dose limiting toxicities (Sharma et al.,

in

cancer,
the
production
of
basal
and
LPS-mediated
PGE2
was
significantly
reduced
in
a

manner
(Plummer et al., 2001). Administration of curcumin caused a
reduction in M(1)G levels in malignant colorectal tissue,
whereas COX-2 protein levels in malignant colorectal tissue
remained unaltered (Garcea et al., 2005). Furthermore,
curcumin treatment has a significant impact on improving
the
general
health
of
colorectal
cancer
patients
by
enhancing expression of p53 molecules in tumour cells and
consequently promoting the apoptosis of tumour cells (He
et al., 2011). In colorectal mucosa, pharmacologically active

 concentrations
of
curcumin
were
achieved
after
administration of curcumin C3 complex (Irving et al., 2013).
Head and neck cancer
.
Curcumin has also been found to have
potential against head and neck cancer, which generally
arises in the paranasal sinuses, nasal cavity, oral cavity,
pharynx and larynx. An investigation was carried out by
Kim et al. to determine the potential anti-inflammatory
effect of curcumin in HNSCC patients. Curcumin was found
to suppress inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8,
granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and TNF-
α as well as IKKβ kinase in the saliva of patients. They also
suggested that IKKβ kinase could be a plausible biomarker
for the detection of the effect of curcumin in head and neck
cancer as curcumin inhibited IKKβ kinase activity in the
saliva of HNSCC patients, and this effect was strongly
correlated with the reduced expression of a number of
cytokines (Kim et al., 2011).
Pancreatic cancer
.
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal
human cancers and the conventional treatment approaches
have had little impact on the course of this aggressive
neoplasm
(Li
et
al.,
2004).
However,
new
therapeutic
strategies based on curcumin seem to hold great promise.
Studies have shown that oral curcumin is safe and well-
tolerated, and despite its limited absorption has clinical
biological effects in pancreatic cancer patients. Its intake
causes
the
down-regulation
of
NF-κB,
COX-2
and
phosphorylated STAT3 in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells from patients with pancreatic cancer (Dhillon et al.,
2008). However, a study conducted by Epelbaum et al. to
investigate the activity and feasibility of gemcitabine in
combination with curcumin in advanced pancreatic cancer
patients, suggested that the dose of 8 g curcumin per day is
inadvisable and can be reduced by combining it with
systemic gemcitabine (Epelbaum et al., 2010). Furthermore,
the safety and feasibility of combination therapy using
curcumin and gemcitabine was evaluated in a different

 study; this contradicted the previous report and suggested 8 g
oral
curcumin
daily
combined
with
gemcitabine-based
chemotherapy is extremely safe and practicable enough for
pancreatic cancer patients (Kanai et al., 2011). Another
group explored the safety of repeated administration of
Theracurmin® in those pancreatic or biliary tract cancer
patients who failed to respond to standard chemotherapy.
Theracurmin®
was
administered
orally,
with
standard
gemcitabine-based
chemotherapy,
starting
with
a
dose
containing
200
mg
of
curcumin
(Level
1)
and
then
increasing the dose to 400 mg of curcumin (Level 2). With
this regime, peak plasma curcumin levels at Level 1 was
found to be 324 ng·mL�1 and, at Level 2, 440 ng·mL�1. No
adverse side reactions were observed and three patients
continued the treatment for nine months (Kanai et al., 2013).
Other cancers.
Curcumin exhibited potential against various
other cancers as well in clinical settings. In an attempt to
evaluate the clinical efficacy of curcuminoid therapy, a
bioavailable-boosted formulation was given to patients with
solid tumours of different cancers such as colorectal, gastric,
breast, sarcoma, lymphoma, prostate, bladder, oesophagus,
ovary,
testicles
and
hepatocellular
carcinoma.
It
was
observed
that
its
supplementation
suppressed
systemic
inflammation and significantly improved the quality of life
of these patients (Panahi et al., 2014c). In a phase I clinical
trial of curcumin in patients with high-risk or pre-malignant
lesions
of
bladder
cancer,
oral
leucoplakia,
intestinal
metaplasia of the stomach, uterine cervical intraepithelial
neoplasm and Bowen’s disease, the curcumin treatment was
found to improve the histology of precancerous lesions
(Cheng et al., 2001). In another study, a lecithinized
delivery system of curcumin (Meriva®, Indena S.p.A. - Viale
Ortles, Milano, Italy) was shown to alleviate the adverse side
effects associated with the chemo- and radiotherapy of
different tumours, such as colon, liver, kidney, lung and
stomach (Belcaro et al., 2014). Another clinical trial found
that a dose of 6 g·day�1 of curcumin for seven consecutive
days in every 3 weeks in combination with a standard dose
of docetaxel was safe, tolerable and highly effective against
breast cancer (Bayet-Robert et al., 2010). The administration
of curcumin to paediatric patients with relapsed brain
tumours undergoing chemotherapy increased their response
compared with the institutional controls (Wolff et al.,
2012). Curcumin was also shown to possess a potent
chemosensitizing effect in a study conducted with 50
chronic myeloid leukaemia patients, where the patients
receiving
both
imatinib
and
curcumin
showed
better
prognosis with reduced nitric oxide levels than the patients
receiving imatinib alone (Ghalaut et al., 2012).
Curcumin for cardiovascular diseases
Cardiovascular diseases, which include acute coronary syn-
drome, acute myocardial infarction and dyslipidaemia, are
the number one cause of mortality worldwide. There are
many drugs approved for the treatment of this disease but
they are not devoid of severe side effects. Therefore, the effect
of curcumin has been studied in patients with this disease.
Acute coronary syndrome.
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is
used to define any group of clinical symptoms compatible
with acute myocardial ischaemia (Kumar and Cannon,

British Journal of Pharmacology (2017) 174 1325–1348
 2009). In a randomized controlled trial with 75 ACS patients,
curcumin was evaluated for its effects on lipid levels.
Curcumin was administered to the patients at increasing
doses three times a day (low dose 15 mg, moderate dose
30 mg and high dose 60 mg). The findings revealed that
curcumin effectively reduced the total cholesterol and low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the patients at low
doses when compared with the higher doses (Alwi et al.,
2008).
Acute myocardial infarction.
Curcuminoid was found to
reduce the myocardial infarction associated with coronary
artery bypass grafting (CABG) significantly. Wongcharoen
et al. evaluated the effects of curcuminoids on the frequency
of acute myocardial infarction after CABG. A total of 121
patients were enrolled for this trial. The curcuminoid group
exhibited lower levels of post-operative C-reactive protein
(CRP),
malondialdehyde
and
N-terminal
pro-B-type
natriuretic
peptide
levels.
These
antioxidant
and
anti-
inflammatory
effects
might
contribute
to
the
cardioprotective effects of the curcuminoids (Wongcharoen
et al., 2012).
Dyslipidaemia.
Dyslipidaemia
is
a
well-established
modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Treatment of this
disease is usual for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases
(Cicero and Colletti, 2015). The hypolipidaemic activity of
curcumin was examined in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled,
crossover
trial.
Supplementation
of
curcuminoid resulted in a decrease in the concentrations of
serum triglycerides without causing any marked impact on
the
lipid
profile,
body
mass
index
and
body
fat
(Mohammadi et al., 2013).
Metabolic
and
cardiovascular
health.
Although
dietary
supplements have extensive health benefits, Soare et al.
observed that a combination of dietary supplements had no
cardiovascular or metabolic effects in non-obese relatively
healthy individuals. In their study, 24 weeks of dietary
supplementation did
not influence arterial stiffness or
endothelial function, or alter body fat measurements, blood
pressure, plasma lipids, glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF1) and markers of inflammation and oxidative
stress in non-obese individuals (Soare et al., 2014). In
contrast, it has been found that the consumption of curry
spices rich in antioxidative compounds like curcumin and
eugenol, improves postprandial endothelial function in
healthy male subjects, which is beneficial for cardiovascular
health. The participants who ate curry had an increased
flow-mediated
vasodilatation
response.
Moreover,
the
presence of spices in the curry did not significantly change
the
systemic
and
forearm
haemodynamics,
or
any
biochemical parameters (Nakayama et al., 2014).
Regular consumption of curcumin is probably an alterna-
tive way of modifying cholesterol-related parameters, as evi-
denced by a study that measured the effect of curcumin
extract on weight, glucose and lipid profiles in patients with
metabolic syndrome. At 12 weeks after intake of the
curcumin extract, there was an elevation in the high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol level, whereas the level of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol was decreased significantly (Yang
et al., 2014). In another study conducted with 32 partici-
pants, curcumin was shown to increase the vascular endothe-
lial function in postmenopausal women, which in turn
decreases the risk of cardiovascular diseases (Akazawa et al.,
2012).
Curcumin for inflammatory diseases
The effect of curcumin on different inflammatory diseases in
humans, such as bronchial asthma, uveitis, periodontitis and
inflammatory bowel diseases, has also been studied in detail.
Biliary diseases.
The first clinical trial of curcumin in human
diseases was done by Oppenheimer in 1937 to examine the
effects of ‘curcumen’ or ‘curcunat’ (contains 0.1 to 0.25 g
sodium curcumin and 0.1 g calcium cholate) on human
biliary diseases. Healthy persons were subjected to an i.v.
injection of 5% sodium curcumin solution, which resulted
in rapid emptying of the gallbladder. Notably, one patient
showed a complete cure throughout a long period of
observation
(Oppenheimer,
1937).
In
another
study,
Cholagogum F Nattermann (dried extracts from Schöllkraut
and Curcuma) treatment caused an effective reduction in
biliary dyskinesia (Niederau and Gopfert, 1999).
Bronchial asthma.
Curcumin has also found to be highly
effective against bronchial asthma. Abidi et al. (2014)
investigated the effectiveness of curcumin as an add-on
therapy in patients with bronchial asthma. Administration
of curcumin capsules improved the mean forced expiratory
volume 1 s (FEV1) values, which signifies an improvement in
the airway obstruction. Moreover, improved haematological
parameters were also obtained (Abidi et al., 2014).
Chronic anterior uveitis.
Uveitis is a major cause of vision loss
worldwide.
Chronic
anterior
uveitis
(CAU)
includes
a
heterogeneous
group
of
diseases,
of
which
some
are
idiopathic in origin (McCluskey et al., 2000). As curcumin
has
shown
to
be
effective
as
a
treatment
of
diverse
inflammatory
conditions,
a
few
clinical
trials
were
attempted to evaluate its efficacy against CAU of different
aetiologies. The oral administration of curcumin to CAU
patients improved their health and a follow-up after 3 years
indicated a 55% recurrence rate (Lal et al., 1999). Another
group
investigated
the
efficacy
of
oral
phospholipidic
curcumin on recurrent CAU of different aetiologies. The
findings claimed that phospholipidic curcumin reduced the
symptoms and signs of eye discomfort efficiently after a few
weeks treatment in the majority of the patients (Allegri
et al., 2010).
Chronic
cutaneous
complications.
Chronic
cutaneous
complications are one of the major and frequent complaints
of patients exposed to sulphur mustard (SM). A trial

by
Panahi
et
al.
investigated
the
effect
of
curcumin on serum inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-8
and hs-CRP and their association with the severity of a
chronic cutaneous complication called pruritus. The results
implied that curcumin is highly effective at lessening the
inflammation
in
patients
with
chronic
SM-induced
cutaneous complications, which might account for its

 ability to ameliorate pruritus and improve the quality of life
of these patients (Panahi et al., 2012b).
Chronic periodontitis.
Curcumin, being a well-known anti-
inflammatory agent, can be used to develop an effective
preventive
and
treatment
approach
for
chronic
periodontitis.
A
comparative
study
was
conducted
to
measure the therapeutic efficacy of chlorhexidine (CHX)
chips and indigenous curcumin-based collagen as adjuncts
to scaling and root planing in the management of chronic
periodontitis through nonsurgical procedures. At the end of
a 6 month study period, a decrease in plaque and gingival
index scores and improved microbiological parameters,
probing pocket depth and clinical attachment levels were
observed in both CHX chips and curcumin-based collagen-
treated patients (Gottumukkala et al., 2014), indicating their
beneficial therapeutic effects in the nonsurgical treatment of
periodontal disease. Another study carried out by the same
group of investigators indicated that 1% curcumin irrigation
when used as an adjunct to scaling and root planing had a
mild to moderate beneficiary effect (Gottumukkala et al.,
2013). In addition, 1% curcumin solution was found to
cause a better resolution of inflammatory symptoms, in
cases of chronic periodontitis (Suhag et al., 2007). Thus,
based on the results of other experiments, a local drug-
delivery system comprising 2% whole turmeric gel, which
exerts high activity, can be used as an adjunct to scaling and
root planing in the treatment of periodontal pockets (Behal
et al., 2011).
Gingivitis.
Gingivitis
is
one
of
the
most
common
inflammatory periodontal diseases that affect more than
80% of the world’s population (Pulikkotil and Nath, 2015).
Curcumin therapy holds high potential as a treatment of
gingivitis. As an anti-inflammatory, curcumin mouthwash
was found to be almost as good as CHX and hence it may
act as an efficacious adjunct to mechanical periodontal
therapy
(Muglikar
et
al.,
2013).
Similarly,
the
anti-
inflammatory potential of topical curcumin was found to be
comparable with that of CHX-MTZ and higher than CHX in
affecting the levels of IL-1β and CCL28 (Pulikkotil and Nath,
2015). Besides curcumin, in another clinical study turmeric
mouthwash was found to be useful as an adjunct to
mechanical plaque control methods in the prevention of
plaque and gingivitis (Waghmare et al., 2011).
Oral mucositis.
Oral mucositis is a commonly occurring
problem in cancer therapy. Several in vivo studies have
shown that curcumin can avert oral mucositis. In clinical
settings as well, a pilot study was undertaken to measure the
tolerability and efficacy of a curcumin mouthwash against
oral mucositis in paediatric patients receiving doxorubicin-
based chemotherapy. Curcumin mouthwash resulted in
decreased inflammatory scores, and the study documented
no adverse reactions in the patients (Elad et al., 2013).
Oral lichen planus (OLP).
Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a
chronic,
mucocutaneous,
immunological
disease.
Curcuminoids were assessed for their efficacy against OLP
and found to be well tolerated (Chainani-Wu et al., 2007).
Another study performed by the same group suggested
curcuminoids at doses of 6000 mg·day�1 in three divided
doses to be well tolerated and might be of use in regulating
the signs and symptoms of OLP (Chainani-Wu et al.,
2012b). Furthermore, in another controlled trial conducted
with
53
patients,
administration
of
6000
mg·day�1
curcuminoids reduced the symptoms of OLP in 60% of the
patients (Chainani-Wu et al., 2012a).
Chronic pulmonary complications.
Pulmonary complications
are
major
and
frequent
chronic
problems
of
SM
intoxication.
Curcuminoids
were
found
to
suppress
systemic inflammation in patients with chronic pulmonary
complications induced by SM. This anti-inflammatory effect
of curcuminoids
was
found
be mediated
through
the
modulation of inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-8,
TNF-α, TGFβ, substance P, hs-CRP, CGRP and MCP-1.
Curcuminoids were also found to be safe and well tolerated
throughout the trial (Panahi et al., 2015b).
Chronic kidney disease.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is
characterized
by
reduced
kidney
function,
enhanced
inflammation and decreased antioxidants. To evaluate the
effect of curcumin against CKD in humans, a study was
conducted with 16 patients. A herbal supplement composed
of C. longa and Boswellia serrata or placebo was given to
non-dialysis CKD patients and plasma levels of IL-6, TNF-α,
glutathione peroxidase and serum CRP were measured.
Curcumin was found to be safe and well tolerated and
helped to reduce the levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-
6 (Moreillon et al., 2013).
Gastritis.
Gastritis is caused by the production of an array of
inflammatory
cytokines
induced
by
Helicobacter
pylori
infection
in
the
stomach.
A
study
conducted
among
H.
pylori-infected
gastritis
patients
by
Koosirirat
and
colleagues
evaluated
the
effect
of
curcumin
on
the
production of IL-8, IL-1β, TNF-α and COX-2 in gastric
mucosa. However, curcumin was ineffective at decreasing
the production of these cytokines, which indicates it has a
limited effect on H. pylori-induced inflammatory cytokine
production. Nevertheless, other studies have reported that
the
symptoms
of
these
patients
with
gastritis
were
ameliorated by the curcumin treatment (Koosirirat et al.,
2010).
Inflammatory bowel disease.
Inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD), which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis
(UC),
is
a
type
of
chronic
and
relapsing
disorder
characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract
(Aguas et al., 2016). Although, mortality due to IBD is not
very high, it still presents a major healthcare burden. It
damages the patient’s quality of life to a considerable extent
due to its onset in early adulthood and chronicity (Simian
et al., 2016). It enhances the risk of colorectal cancer and
possibly is also associated with leukaemia and lymphoma
(Wheat et al., 2016).
Considering the well-established anti-inflammatory po-
tential of curcumin, a pilot study was conducted to obtain a
probable dosage of curcumin for children suffering from
IBD. Curcumin was well tolerated, but a consistent increase
in gassiness was reported in some patients. However, other
BJP

1336
British Journal of Pharmacology (2017) 174 1325–1348
 patients showed an improvement in the symptoms of the
disease (Suskind et al., 2013).
Crohn’s disease.
Crohn’s disease is an immune-mediated
IBD, which has become increasingly prevalent throughout
the past decade (Lauro et al., 2016; Manuc et al., 2016). A
pilot study was conducted with Crohn’s disease to determine
the effect of curcumin, as an addition to the existing
treatments, in decreasing inflammation. This was done by
reducing
the
doses
of
the
other
concomitant
anti-
inflammatory agents. Out of five patients, four showed lower
Crohn’s Disease Activity Index scores and sedimentation
rates (Holt et al., 2005), indicating that curcumin has
potential at ameliorating inflammatory Crohn’s disease.
Ulcerative
colitis
(UC).
UC
is
a
commonly
occurring
inflammatory disease and the usefulness of curcumin in the
experimental models of UC has been well demonstrated. Its
efficacy was investigated in a pilot study where it was
evident that use of NCB-02 (a standardized curcumin
preparation) as an enema caused greater improvements in
disease activity in distal UC patients (Singla et al., 2014). In
another trial, curcumin improved both the clinical activity
index and endoscopic index and in turn suppressed the
morbidity linked with UC. Therefore, curcumin could be an
important,
safe
and
effective
alternative
treatment
for
maintaining remission in quiescent UC patients (Hanai
et al., 2006; Lang et al., 2015).
Osteoarthritis
(OA).
The
management
of
osteoarthritis
remains
a
challenge
and
hence
a
safe
and
efficient
treatment modality is much in demand. Several in vitro
studies
have
demonstrated
the
beneficial
effects
of
curcumin on cartilage in OA. Hence, a handful of clinical
trials were undertaken (Henrotin et al., 2014). Panahi et al.
showed that treatment with curcuminoids (1500 mg·day�1
in three divided
doses) of
OA
patients
resulted
in
a
reduction in pain and physical function scores but not the
stiffness score OA index. Thus, curcuminoids present a safe
and highly efficacious treatment choice for OA (Panahi
et al., 2014b). Another study also reported the efficacy of
curcumin in the treatment of knee OA patients as evinced
through the decrease of a cartilage specific biomarker, Coll2-
1 (Henrotin et al., 2014). In addition, adjuvant therapy of
curcumin
with
diclofenac
has
exhibited
advantageous
outcome in the treatment of primary knee OA (Pinsornsak
and Niempoog, 2012). In addition, turmeric extract has also
shown to be safe and effective in reducing the pain and
improving
the
function
of
OA
patients.
In
a
study
conducted with 367 patients, administration of Curcuma
domestica extracts (1500 mg·day�1 for 4 weeks) resulted in
improved osteoarthritis index, and its efficacy was found to
be quite comparable with that of ibuprofen (Kuptniratsaikul
et al., 2014).
To improve the efficacy of curcumin, different formula-
tions have been used for the treatment of OA patients.
Theracurmin® (manufactured by Theravalues Corporation,
Kioicho, Tokyo, Japan) was used by the Nakagawa and group
to evaluate its improved efficacy in the treatment of patients
with knee OA. Theracurmin was shown to be effective against
knee OA by lowering the knee pain visual analogue scale
without causing any major toxic effects (Nakagawa et al.,
2014). Another formulation Meriva, a complex of curcumin
with soy phosphatidylcholine, has been found to be highly
effective in the clinicomanagement of OA. The report also
suggested the enhanced stability and improved absorption
of curcumin taken in this form, as well as improvements in
the clinical and biochemical end points in OA patients
(Belcaro et al., 2010b; 2014).
Peptic ulcer
.
Peptic ulcer is a multifactorial disease, the
complications of which remain a major challenge (Farzaei
et al., 2015). There is much evidence suggesting that
curcumin could play a pivotal role in the management of
such ulcers. Henceforth, a phase II clinical trial to measure
the effect of turmeric on the healing of peptic ulcers was
performed. A few patients showed a complete absence of
ulcers after the 8 weeks of treatment, whereas others did not
have ulcers after 12 weeks (Prucksunand et al., 2001),
indicating its great efficacy against this disease.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Curcumin has displayed potent
antiarthritic effects. A pilot clinical study investigated the
safety
and
efficacy
of
curcumin
in
active
rheumatoid
arthritis patients and it showed an improvement in overall
DAS (disease activity score) and ACR (American College of
Rheumatology)
scores.
The
safety
and
superiority
of
curcumin treatment was well evidenced (Chandran and
Goel, 2012). Moreover, the curcumin treatment was also
found to reduce the stiffness and swelling in the joints of
patients with RA (Hanai et al., 2006).
Curcumin for metabolic disease
Curcumin have also been shown to be very effective in the
management of different metabolic diseases such as diabetes
and obesity.
Diabetes.
Diabetes
is
a
cluster
of
metabolic
diseases
associated with high blood sugar levels. Several pilot studies
have been carried out in human participants with curcumin
to measure its effect on diabetes and associated metabolic
conditions.
The
first
study
of
this
kind
showed
that
curcumin could effectively lower the blood sugar levels in
diabetic patients. Treatment with turmeric powder resulted
in
a
decrease
in
fasting
blood
sugar
from
1400
to
700 mg·L�1 in a patient suffering from diabetes for 16 years
(Srinivasan, 1972). The intake of curcuminoids exerted a
favourable effect on endothelial dysfunction along with a
reduction in cytokines and markers of oxidative stress
(Usharani et al., 2008). Another trial advocated curcumin’s
potential in delaying the development of type 2 diabetes
mellitus. It ameliorated beta cell functions, elevated HOMA-
β and reduced C-peptide levels (Chuengsamarn et al., 2012).
The same group also reported that the intake of curcumin
could reduce atherogenic risks and amend the metabolic
profiles of high-risk populations (Chuengsamarn et al.,
2014).
Similarly,
in
overweight/obese
type
2
diabetic
patients, curcuminoids lower blood glucose levels (Na et al.,
2014). Furthermore, Meriva was shown to be effective in the
management of diabetic microangiopathy and retinopathy
(Appendino et al., 2011; Steigerwalt et al., 2012). In a recent
study, it was found that curcumin treatment improved the

 skeletal muscle atrophy in type 1 diabetic mice through

of
protein
ubiquitination,
inflammatory
cytokines and oxidative stress (Ono et al., 2015). Another
initial study indicated that a novel, chemically-modified
curcumin was able to normalize wound-healing in diabetes
I-induced rats by reducing the excessive collagenase-2 as
well as MMP-13/collagenase-3 (Zhang et al., 2016).
Obesity.
Obesity is a global health problem and is a
condition where the excess fat accumulates and exerts a
negative impact on health (Ganjali et al., 2014). Curcumin
has proven its effectiveness in obese patients too. It reduces
the symptoms of anxiety and depression associated with
obesity
(Esmaily
et
al.,
2015).
Curcumin
modulates
circulating levels of IL-1β, IL-4 and VEGF, thus exhibiting
an immunomodulatory effect and also reduces oxidative
stress in obese patients (Sahebkar et al., 2013; Ganjali et al.,
2014).
Curcumin for neurological disease
The effect of curcumin was also studied in neurological disor-
ders such as Alzheimer’s disease and depression in humans.
Alzheimer’s disease.
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive
neurodegenerative disorder, usually affecting people older
than
65
years.
A
randomized,
double-blind,
placebo-
controlled study enrolled 34 patients with Alzheimer’s
disease
and
randomly
administered
curcumin
at
two
different doses (1 or 4 g) or placebo (4 g). The curcumin
treatment resulted in elevated levels of vitamin E without
causing any adverse reactions through the antioxidant
effects of curcuma (Baum et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2013b).
Depression.
Depression
is
a
disorder
in
which
many
dysregulated pathways have been identified. As curcumin
is known to target many pathways, its effect on depression
has also been studied and it was observed that treatment
with curcumin altered the biomarkers of depression and
also improved the mood of the patients (Lopresti et al.,
2014;
Lopresti
et
al.,
2015).
A
study
conducted
by
Sanmukhani et al. confirmed curcumin to be effective and
safe for the treatment of patients with major depressive
disorder without concurrent suicidal ideation or other
psychotic disorders (Sanmukhani et al., 2014). In another
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, it was
observed that 4 to 8 weeks of treatment with curcumin
was effective at improving several mood-related symptoms
in these patients (Lopresti et al., 2014). Subsequently, the
same group demonstrated that curcumin supplementation
affected
several
biomarkers
such
as
thromboxane
B2,
substance P, aldosterone, cortisol, endothelin-1 and leptin,
which might be responsible for its antidepressant effect
(Lopresti et al., 2015).
Curcumin for skin diseases
Curcumin has also been shown to be very effective against
various skin diseases such as psoriasis and vitiligo.
Psoriasis.
Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder characterized
by patches of abnormal skin. In a clinical trial, curcumin was
found to exhibit an antipsoriatic effect by altering PhK
activity (Heng et al., 2000). Recently, in a randomized,
double-blind,
placebo-controlled
clinical
trial,
patients
treated with the curcumin formulation, Meriva, showed
reduced disease conditions. It also increased the anti-
psoriatic effects of topical steroids in these patients when
treated in combination. Thus, it was highly effective as an
adjuvant therapy against psoriasis vulgaris and, notably,
caused a reduction in serum levels of IL-22 (Antiga et al.,
2015). Moreover, the safety and efficacy of curcumin was
documented in a phase II, open-label, Simon’s two-stage
trial where the plaque psoriasis patients received 4.5 g of
oral curcuminoid C3 complex daily. The intention-to-treat
analysis response rate was found to be 16.7%, and none of
the participants had to withdraw from the study due to
associated adverse events (Kurd et al., 2008).
Dermatitis.
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
clinical trial has been conducted to investigate curcumin’s
potential at reducing the severity of radiation-associated
dermatitis in 30 breast cancer patients. A decrease in the
severity of radiation dermatitis was observed in those
patients receiving 6 g·day�1 curcumin p.o. during their
radiotherapy sessions (Ryan et al., 2013).
Vitiligo.
Vitiligo is a chronic skin condition characterized by
loss of pigmentation of the skin. The beneficial effect of
curcumin
on
vitiligo
has
been
demonstrated
by
Asawanonda and Klahan (2010); treatment with narrow
band UVB plus topical tetrahydrocurcuminoid cream was
found to be effective and well tolerated (Asawanonda and
Klahan, 2010).
Curcumin for infectious diseases
Curcumin has also been shown to be effective in the treat-
ment of various infectious diseases in humans.
Acquired
immunodeficiency
syndrome.
Acquired
immuno-
deficiency
syndrome
(AIDS)
is
caused
by
the
human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which interferes with and
weakens the immune system. A clinical trial from New
England evaluated the effectiveness of curcumin as an
antiviral agent in 40 AIDS patients. The patients were
allotted to either a high dose group (2.5 g·day�1) or a low-
dose group in a random fashion for the treatment of
8 weeks. Though statistically insignificant, a mild increase
in CD4 cells was observed in the high-dose group and a
consistent decrease in the low-dose group. However, no
evidence was obtained related to a decrease in viral load
(James, 1996).
Curcumin for liver diseases.
Curcumin exhibits effects against
different liver diseases such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C,
alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,
drug-induced hepatotoxicity, liver cancer, biliary cirrhosis
and primary sclerosing cholangitis. The antioxidant and
inhibitory effects of curcumin on NF-κB play a vital role in
its effect against a diverse range of hepatic diseases (Nanji
et al., 2003, Rivera-Espinoza and Muriel, 2009, Nabavi et al.,
2014). Curcumin was shown to reduce the liver damage in
several animal models of liver injury (Bruck et al., 2007).

 cordifolia was found to prevent anti-tuberculosis treatment-
induced hepatotoxicity significantly without causing any
toxic effects (Adhvaryu et al., 2008).
Other diseases.
The multitargeting potential of curcumin is
extended
to many
other diseases
as
well
like arsenic
carcinogenicity and dyspepsia. Curcumin with its intrinsic
antioxidant
properties
could
limit
the
toxic
effects
associated with arsenic (Biswas et al., 2010). It also inhibits
exercise-induced oxidative stress in humans and reduces the
severity
of
premenstrual
syndrome
in
women
by
modulating
the
levels
of
neurotransmitters
and
anti-
inflammatory
biomolecules

patients
reduces
oxidative
damage
(Kalpravidh et al., 2010). Furthermore, curcumin increased
the quality of life in a 15-year-old Caucasian girl with
Déjérine–Sottas (Burns et al., 2009). It also improves the
post-operative outcomes of patients who have undergone
laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Agarwal
et al., 2011). A
randomized controlled trial demonstrated that curcumin,
due to its anti-inflammatory effects, can combat pruritus
and improve the quality of life of these patients (Panahi
et al., 2012a). Moreover, oral administration of curcumin
suppresses the symptoms of lupus nephritis – inflammation
of the kidney (Khajehdehi et al., 2012), and significantly
reduces the paraprotein (a monoclonal protein) levels in the
blood
of
patients
with
monoclonal
gammopathy
of
undetermined
significance
(MGUS)
(Golombick
et
al.,
2009). In another study, curcumin slowed the disease
progression
of
patients
with
MGUS
and
smouldering
multiple myeloma (Golombick et al., 2012).
Synergy of curcumin with other nutraceuticals
in the clinic
To attain an improved therapy with better efficacy and less
toxicity, the effects of curcumin when used in combination
with other safe agents have been investigated. Several clinical
trials have attempted to explore the feasibility and tolerabil-
ity
of
the
combination
of
curcumin
with
various
nutraceuticals. For example, oral curcumin with piperine
can reverse lipid peroxidation efficiently in patients with
tropical pancreatitis (Durgaprasad et al., 2005). Cruz-Correa’s
group have evaluated the effect of a combination therapy of
curcumin and quercetin to reduce adenomas in patients with
familial adenomatous polyposis. The combined treatment
caused a decrease in the number and size from baseline of
polyps with negligible adverse reactions and no laboratory
abnormalities (Cruz-Correa et al., 2006). Rafailov and group
conducted a phase I trial to evaluate the effect of a herbal
preparation containing curcumin, known as ‘Zyflamend’,
against prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). The biopsy
revealed benign prostatic hyperplasia alone at the end of 6-
months, and after 18 months, the biopsy was negative for
cancer and PIN (Rafailov et al., 2007; Sung et al., 2012). The
application of Indian turmeric with honey is highly effective
as a complementary therapy for oral mucositis (Francis and
Williams, 2014). Moreover, Oxy-Q bioflavonoid therapy with
curcumin and quercetin improves the early graft function in
dialysis-dependent
cadaveric
kidney
recipients
(Shoskes
et al., 2005). Likewise, in a cohort of 311 patients, Cinarepa,
a mixture of various phytochemicals, including curcumin,
chlorogenic acid, inulin and rosemary bud essential oil, was
shown to suppress the symptoms of functional dyspepsia sig-
nificantly (Sannia, 2010).
Curcumin has not only been combined with other natu-
ral compounds but also with different therapeutic drugs. In
a prospective randomized study, the therapeutic effect of
quercitin and curcumin (FlogMEV) in combination with
prulifloxacin was assessed in chronic bacterial prostitis
patients, and FlogMEV was found to improve the clinical
efficacy of prulifloxacin (Cai et al., 2009). The efficacy of an-
other 7-day non-antibiotic therapy, comprising curcumin,
lactoferrin, N-acetylcysteine and pantoprazole, at eradicating
H. pylori infection and reducing gastric inflammation has also
been determined. However, this therapy was not particularly
effective (Di Mario et al., 2007). Nevertheless, curcumin has
been found to have high potential against different diseases
either alone or in combination with other agents. In addi-
tion, there are more than 100 ongoing clinical trials of
curcumin (Table 3); the findings of these clinical trials can
be anticipated to be of immense help in providing a better un-
derstanding of curcumin’s potential and its future prospects
in the clinicomanagement of various human diseases.
Conclusions
There is an abundance of preclinical and clinical evidence in-
dicating that curcumin has potential as a therapy for a wide
variety of chronic diseases including cancer, cardiovascular,
inflammatory, metabolic, neurological and skin diseases,
and various infectious diseases. Unlike most pharmaceutical
drugs, curcumin modulates multiple targets that affect differ-
ent diseases. Safety, efficacy and affordability are some of the
added advantages exhibited by this compound. There are also
increasing lines of evidence suggesting it has a potent
chemosensitizing effect in various cancers. Nevertheless, a
few studies have reported that curcumin can function as an
antagonistic as well. However, its therapeutic efficacy is hin-
dered to a certain extent by its low bioavailability. Therefore,
various strategies are being implemented, which include the
development of curcumin analogues and formulations such
as adjuvants, nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles and phos-
pholipid complexes, to improve its bioavailability. In addi-
tion, several other approaches have been employed to
enhance its bioavailability, which include altering the route
of administering curcumin and obstructing the metabolic
pathways via co-treatment with other agents. Therefore,
more detailed and well-controlled clinical trials are inevitable
to evaluate the efficacy of these new formulations as com-
pared with the parental compound. Thus, the results of these
further investigations are likely to increase the bioavailability,
therapeutic importance and application of curcumin and
make this agent a cutting edge therapeutic strategy for the
prevention and treatment of a variety of chronic diseases.
