Why clinical trial outcomes fail to translate
into benefits for patients

Abstract
Clinical research should ultimately improve patient care. For this to be possible, trials must evaluate outcomes that
genuinely reflect real-world settings and concerns. However, many trials continue to measure and report outcomes
that fall short of this clear requirement. We highlight problems with trial outcomes that make evidence difficult or
impossible to interpret and that undermine the translation of research into practice and policy. These complex issues
include the use of surrogate, composite and subjective endpoints; a failure to take account of patients’ perspectives
when designing research outcomes; publication and other outcome reporting biases, including the under-reporting of
adverse events; the reporting of relative measures at the expense of more informative absolute outcomes; misleading
reporting; multiplicity of outcomes; and a lack of core outcome sets. Trial outcomes can be developed with patients in
mind, however, and can be reported completely, transparently and competently. Clinicians, patients, researchers and
those who pay for health services are entitled to demand reliable evidence demonstrating whether interventions
improve patient-relevant clinical outcomes.

Background
Clinical trials are the most rigorous way of testing how
novel treatments compare with existing treatments for a
given outcome. Well-conducted clinical trials have the
potential to make a significant impact on patient care
and therefore should be designed and conducted to
achieve this goal. One way to do this is to ensure that
trial outcomes are relevant, appropriate and of import-
ance to patients in real-world clinical settings. However,
relatively few trials make a meaningful contribution to
patient care, often as a result of the way that the trial
outcomes are chosen, collected and reported. For ex-
ample, authors of a recent analysis of cancer drugs
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) reported a lack of clinically meaningful benefit in
many post-marketing studies, owing to the use of surro-
gates, which undermines the ability of physicians and
patients to make informed treatment decisions [1].
Such examples are concerning, given how critical trial
outcomes are to clinical decision making. The World
Health Organisation (WHO) recognises that ‘choosing
the most important outcome is critical to producing a
useful guideline’ [2]. A survey of 48 U.K. clinical trials
units found that ‘choosing appropriate outcomes to
measure’ as one of the top three priorities for methods
research [3]. Yet, despite the importance of carefully se-
lected trial outcomes to clinical practice, relatively little
is understood about the components of outcomes that
are critical to decision making.
Most articles on trial outcomes focus on one or two
aspects of their development or reporting. Assessing the
extent to which outcomes are critical, however, requires
a comprehensive understanding of all the shortcomings
that can undermine their validity (Fig. 1). The problems
we set out are complex, often coexist and can interact,
contributing to a situation where clinical trial outcomes
commonly fail to translate into clinical benefits for
patients.

 Main text
Badly chosen outcomes
Surrogate outcomes
Surrogate markers are often used to infer or predict a
more direct patient-oriented outcome, such as death or
functional capacity. Such outcomes are popular because
they are often cheaper to measure and because changes
may emerge faster than the real clinical outcome of
interest. This can be a valid approach when the surro-
gate marker has a strong association with the real
outcome of interest. For example, intra-ocular pressure
in
glaucoma
and
blood
pressure
in
cardiovascular
disease are well-established markers. However, for many
surrogates, such as glycated haemoglobin, bone mineral
density and prostate-specific antigen, there are consider-
able doubts about their correlation with disease [4].
Caution is therefore required in their interpretation [5].
Authors of an analysis of 626 randomised controlled tri-
als (RCTs) reported that 17% of trials used a surrogate
primary outcome, but only one-third discussed their val-
idity [6]. Surrogates generally provide less direct relevant
evidence than studies using patient-relevant outcomes
[5, 7], and over-interpretation runs the risk of incorrect
interpretations because changes may not reflect import-
ant changes in outcomes [8]. As an example, researchers
in a well-conducted clinical trial of the diabetes drug
rosiglitazone reported that it effectively lowered blood
glucose (a surrogate) [9]; however, the drug was subse-
quently withdrawn in the European Union because of
increased
cardiovascular
events,
the
patient-relevant
outcome [10].
Composite outcomes
The use of combination measures is highly prevalent in,
for example, cardiovascular research. However, their use
can often lead to exaggerated estimates of treatment ef-
fects or render a trial report uninterpretable. Authors of
an analysis of 242 cardiovascular RCTs, published in six
high-impact medical journals, found that in 47% of the
trials, researchers reported a composite outcome [11].
Authors of a further review of 40 trials, published in 2008,
found that composites often had little justification for
their choice [12], were inconsistently defined, and often
the outcome combinations did not make clinical sense
[13]. Individual outcomes within a composite can vary in
the severity of their effects, which may be misleading
when the most important outcomes, such as death, make
relatively little contribution to the overall outcome meas-
ure [14]. Having more event data by using a composite
does allow more precise outcome estimation. Interpret-
ation, however, is particularly problematic when data are
missing. Authors of an analysis of 51 rheumatoid arthritis
RCTs reported >20% data was missing for the composite
primary outcomes in 39% of the trials [15]. Missing data
often requires imputation; however, the optimal method
to address this remains unknown [15].
Subjective outcomes
Where an observer exercises judgment while assessing
an event, or where the outcome is self-reported, the out-
come is considered subjective [16]. In trials with such
outcomes, effects are often exaggerated, particularly
when methodological biases occur (i.e., when outcome
assessors are not blinded) [17, 18]. In a systematic re-
view of observer bias, non-blinded outcome assessors
exaggerated ORs in RCTs by 36% compared with
blinded assessors [19]. In addition, trials with inadequate
or unclear sequence generation also biased estimates
when outcomes were subjective [20]. Yet, despite these
shortcomings, subjective outcomes are highly prevalent
in trials as well as systematic reviews: In a study of 43
systematic reviews of drug interventions, researchers
reported the primary outcome was objective in only 38%
of the pooled analyses [21].
Complex scales
Combinations of symptoms and signs can be used to form
outcome scales, which can also prove to be problematic. A

 review of 300 trials from the Cochrane Schizophrenia
Group’s register revealed that trials were more likely to be
positive
when
unpublished
and
unreliable
and non-
validated scales were used [22]. Furthermore, changes to
the measurement scale used during the trial (a form of
outcome switching) was one of the possible causes for the
high number of results favouring new rheumatoid arthritis
drugs [23]. Clinical trials require rating scales that are rigor-
ous, but this is difficult to achieve [24]. Moreover, patients
want to know the extent to which they are free of a symp-
tom or a sign, more so than the mean change in a score.
Lack of relevance to patients and decision makers
Interpretation of changes in trial outcomes needs to go
beyond a simple discussion of statistical significance to
include clinical significance. Sometimes, however, such
interpretation does not happen: In a review of 57 de-
mentia drug trials, researchers found that less than half
(46%) discussed the clinical significance of their results
[17]. Furthermore, authors of a systematic assessment of
the prevalence of patient-reported outcomes in cardio-
vascular trials published in the ten leading medical jour-
nals found that important outcomes for patients, such as
death, were reported in only 23% of the 413 included tri-
als. In 40% of the trials, patient-reported outcomes were
judged to be of little added value, and 70% of the trials
were missing crucial outcome data relevant to clinical
decision making (mainly due to use of composite out-
comes and under-reporting of adverse events) [25].
There has been some improvement over time in report-
ing of patient-relevant outcomes such as quality of life,
but the situation remains dire: by 2010, only 16% of car-
diovascular disease trials reported quality of life, a three-
fold increase from 1997. Use of surrogate, composite
and subjective outcomes further undermines relevance
to patients [26] and often accompanies problems with
reporting and interpretation [25].
Studies often undermine decision making by failing to
determine thresholds of practical importance to patient
care. The smallest difference a patient, or the patient’s
clinician, would be willing to accept to use a new inter-
vention is the minimal clinically important difference
(MCID). Crucially, clinicians and patients can assist in
developing MCIDs; however, to date, such joint working
is rare, and use of MCIDs has remained limited [27].
Problems are further compounded by the lack of
consistency in the application of subjective outcomes
across different interventions. Guidelines, for example,
reject the use of antibiotics in sore throat [28] owing to
their
minimal
effects
on
symptoms;
yet,
similar
guidelines approve the use of antivirals because of their
effects on symptoms [29], despite similar limited effects
[30]. This contradiction occurs because decision makers,
and particularly guideline developers, frequently lack
understanding of the MCIDs required to change thera-
peutic decision making. Caution is also warranted,
though, when it comes to assessing minimal effects:
Authors of an analysis of 51 trials found small outcome
effects were commonly reported and often eliminated by
the presence of minimal bias [31]. Also, MCIDs may not
necessarily reflect what patients consider to be import-
ant for decision making. Researchers in a study of
patients with rheumatoid arthritis reported that the dif-
ference they considered really important was up to three
to four times greater than MCIDs [32]. Moreover, inad-
equate duration of follow-up and trials that are stopped
too early also contribute to a lack of reliable evidence
for decision makers. For example, authors of systematic
reviews of patients with mild depression have reported
that only a handful of trials in primary care provide out-
come data on the long-term effectiveness (beyond
12 weeks) of anti-depressant drug treatments [33]. Fur-
thermore, results of simulation studies show that trials
halted too early, with modest effects and few events, will
result in large overestimates of the outcome effect [34].
Badly collected outcomes
Missing data
Problems with missing data occur in almost all research:
Its presence reduces study power and can easily lead to
false conclusions. Authors of a systematic review of 235
RCTs found that 19% of the trials were no longer signifi-
cant, based on assumptions that the losses to follow-up
actually had the outcome of interest. This figure was
58% in a worst-case scenario, where all participants lost
to follow-up in the intervention group and none in the
control group had the event of interest [35]. The ‘5 and
20 rule’ (i.e., if >20% missing data, then the study is
highly biased; if <5%, then low risk of bias) exists to aid
understanding. However, interpretation of the outcomes
is seriously problematic when the absolute effect size is
less than the loss to follow-up. Despite the development
of a number of different ways of handling missing data,
the only real solution is to prevent it from happening in
the first place [36].
Poorly specified outcomes
It is important to determine the exact definitions for
trial outcomes because poorly specified outcomes can
lead to confusion. As an example, in a Cochrane review
on neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating
influenza, the diagnostic criteria for pneumonia could be
either (1) laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (e.g., based on
radiological evidence of infection); (2) clinical diagnosis
by a doctor without laboratory confirmation; or (3)
another type of diagnosis, such as self-report by the
patient. Treatment effects for pneumonia were statisti-
cally different, depending on which diagnostic criteria
Heneghan et al. Trials  (2017) 18:122 
Page 3 of 7
 were used. Furthermore, who actually assesses the out-
come is important. Self-report measures are particularly
prone to bias, owing to their subjectivity, but even the
type of clinician assessing the outcome can affect the es-
timate: Stroke risk because of carotid endarterectomy
differs depending on whether patients are assessed by a
neurologist or a surgeon [37].
Selectively reported outcomes
Publication bias
Problems with publication bias are well documented.
Among cohort studies following registered or ethically
approved trials, half go unpublished [38], and trials with
positive outcomes are twice as likely to be published, and
published faster, compared with trials with negative out-
comes [39, 40]. The International Committee of Medical
Journal Editors have stated the importance of trial regis-
tration to address the issue of publication bias [41]. Their
policy requires ‘investigators to deposit information about
trial design into an accepted clinical trials registry before
the onset of patient enrolment’. Despite this initiative,
publication bias remains a major issue contributing to
translational failure. This led to the AllTrials campaign,
which calls for all past and present clinical trials to be reg-
istered and their results reported [42].
Reporting bias
Outcome reporting bias occurs when a study has been
published, but some of the outcomes measured and ana-
lysed have not been reported. Reporting bias is an
under-recognised problem that significantly affects the
validity of the outcome. Authors of a review of 283
Cochrane reviews found that more than half did not in-
clude data on the primary outcome [43]. One manifest-
ation of reporting bias is the under-reporting of adverse
events.
Under-reporting of adverse events
Interpreting the net benefits of treatments requires full
outcome reporting of both the benefits and the harms in
an unbiased manner. A review of recombinant human
bone morphogenetic protein 2 used in spinal fusion,
however, showed that data from publications substan-
tially underestimated adverse events when compared
with individual participant data or internal industry re-
ports [44]. A further review of 11 studies comparing
adverse events in published and unpublished documents
reported that 43% to 100% (median 64%) of adverse
events (including outcomes such as death or suicide)
were missed when journal publications were solely relied
on [45]. Researchers in multiple studies have found that
journal publications under-report side effects and there-
fore exaggerate treatment benefits when compared with
more complete information presented in clinical study
reports [46], FDA reviews [47], ClinicalTrials.gov study
reports [48] and reports obtained through litigation [49].
The aim of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials (CONSORT), currently endorsed by 585 medical
journals, is to improve reporting standards. However,
despite CONSORT’s attempts, both publication and
reporting bias remain a substantial problem. This im-
pacts substantially the results of systematic reviews.
Authors of an analysis of 322 systematic reviews found
that 79% did not include the full data on the main harm
outcome. This was due mainly to poor reporting in the
included primary studies; in nearly two-thirds of the pri-
mary studies, outcome reporting bias was suspected
[50]. The aim of updates to the Preferred Reporting
Items
for
Systematic
Reviews
and
Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) checklist for systematic reviews is to improve
the current situation by ensuring that a minimal set of
adverse events items is reported [51].
Switched outcomes is the failure to correctly report pre-
specified outcomes, which remains highly prevalent and
presents significant problems in interpreting results [52].
Authors of a systematic review of selective outcome
reporting, including 27 analyses, found that the median
proportion of trials with a discrepancy between the regis-
tered and published primary outcome was 31% [53].
Researchers in a recent study of 311 manuscripts submit-
ted to The BMJ found that 23% of outcomes pre-specified
in the protocol went unreported [54]. Furthermore, many
trial authors and editors seem unaware of the ramifica-
tions of incorrect outcome reporting. The Centre for
Evidence-Based Medicine Outcome Monitoring Project
(COMPare) prospectively monitored all trials in five jour-
nals and submitted correction letters in real time on all
misreported trials, but the majority of correction letters
submitted were rejected by journal editors [55].
Inappropriately interpreted outcomes
Relative measures
Relative measures can exaggerate findings of modest
clinical benefit and can often be uninterpretable, such as
if control event rates are not reported. Authors of a
2009 review of 344 journal articles reporting on health
inequalities research found that, of the 40% of abstracts
reporting an effect measure, 88% reported only the rela-
tive measure, 9% an absolute measure and just 2%
reported both [56]. In contrast, 75% of all full-text arti-
cles reported relative effects, and only 7% reported both
absolute and relative measures in the full text, despite
reporting guidelines, such as CONSORT, recommending
using both measures whenever possible [57].
Spin
Misleading reporting by presenting a study in a more
positive way than the actual results reflect constitutes

 ‘spin’ [58]. Authors of an analysis of 72 trials with non-
significant
results
reported
it
was
a
common
phenomenon, with 40% of the trials containing some
form of spin. Strategies included reporting on statisti-
cally significant results for within-group comparisons,
secondary outcomes, or subgroup analyses and not the
primary outcome, or focussing the reader on another
study
objective
away
from
the
statistically
non-
significant result [59]. Additionally, the results revealed
the common occurrence of spin in the abstract, the most
accessible and most read part of a trial report. In a study
that randomised 300 clinicians to two versions of the
same abstract (the original with spin and a rewritten ver-
sion without spin), researchers found there was no
difference in clinicians’ rating of the importance of the
study or the need for a further trial [60]. Spin is also
often found in systematic reviews; authors of an analysis
found that spin was present in 28% of the 95 included
reviews of psychological therapies [61]. A consensus
process amongst members of the Cochrane Collabor-
ation has identified 39 different types of spin, 13 of
which were specific to systematic reviews. Of these, the
three most serious were recommendations for practice
not supported by findings in the conclusion, misleading
titles and selective reporting [62].
Multiplicity
Appropriate attention has to be paid to the multiplicity
of outcomes that are present in nearly all clinical trials.
The higher the number of outcomes, the more chance
there is of false-positive results and unsubstantiated
claims of effectiveness [63]. The problem is compounded
when trials have multiple time points, further increasing
the number of outcomes. For licensing applications,
secondary outcomes are considered insufficiently con-
vincing to establish the main body of evidence and are
intended to provide supporting evidence in relation to
the primary outcome [63]. Furthermore, about half of all
trials make further claims by undertaking subgroup ana-
lysis, but caution is warranted when interpreting their
effects. An analysis of 207 studies found that 31%
claimed a subgroup effect for the primary outcome; yet,
such subgroups were often not pre-specified (a form of
outcome switching) and frequently formed part of a
large number of subgroup analyses [64]. At a minimum,
triallists should perform a test of interaction, and jour-
nals should ensure it is done, to examine whether treat-
ment effects actually differ amongst subpopulations [64],
and decision makers should be very wary of high num-
bers of outcomes included in a trial report.
Core outcome sets
Core outcome sets could facilitate comparative effective-
ness research and evidence synthesis. As an example, all
of the top-cited Cochrane reviews in 2009 described
problems
with
inconsistencies
in
their
reported
outcomes [65]. Standardised core outcome sets take ac-
count of patient preferences that should be measured
and reported in all trials for a specific therapeutic area
[65]. Since 1992, the Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid
Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) collaboration has
advocated the use of core outcome sets [66], and the Core
Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET)
Initiative collates relevant resources to facilitate core out-
come development and user engagement [67, 68]. Conse-
quently, their use is on the increase, and the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evalu-
ation (GRADE) working group recommend up to seven
patient-important outcomes be listed in the ‘summary of
findings’ tables in systematic reviews [69].
Conclusions
The treatment choices of patients and clinicians should
ideally be informed by evidence that interventions im-
prove patient-relevant outcomes. Too often, medical
research falls short of this modest ideal. However, there
are ways forward. One of these is to ensure that trials
are conceived and designed with greater input from end
users, such as patients. The James Lind Alliance (JLA)
brings together clinicians, patients and carers to identify
areas of practice where uncertainties exist and to priori-
tise clinical research questions to answer them. The aim
of such ‘priority setting partnerships’ (PSPs) is to develop
research questions using measurable outcomes of direct
relevance to patients. For example, a JLA PSP of demen-
tia research generated a list of key measures, including
quality of life, independence, management of behaviour
and effect on progression of disease, as outcomes that
were relevant to both persons with dementia and their
carers [70].
However, identifying best practice is only the begin-
ning of a wider process to change the culture of re-
search. The ecosystem of evidence-based medicine is
broad, including ethics committees, sponsors, regulators,
triallists, reviewers and journal editors. All these stake-
holders need to ensure that trial outcomes are developed
with patients in mind, that unbiased methods are
adhered to, and that results are reported in full and in
line with those pre-specified at the trial outset. Until
addressed, the problems of how outcomes are chosen,
collected, reported and subsequently interpreted will
continue to make a significant contribution to the rea-
sons why clinical trial outcomes often fail to translate
into clinical benefit for patients.
