ABSTRACT
Background: Reduced intakes of added sugars and sugar-
sweetened beverages (SSBs) have been the main focus of efforts
to stall obesity. Although obesity has risen steeply in Australia,
some evidence suggests that added-sugars and SSB intakes have
declined over the same time frame.
Objective: We investigated recent trends in the availability of
sugars and sweeteners and changes in intakes of total sugars, added
sugars, and SSBs in Australia by using multiple, independent data
sources.
Design: The study was designed to compare relevant data published
by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
[FAO Statistics Division Database (FAOSTAT)], the Australian gov-
ernment, academia, and the food industry.
Results: With the use of the FAOSTAT food balance sheets for
Australia, the per capita availability of added or refined sugars
and sweeteners was shown to have fallen 16% from 152 g/d in
1980 to 127 g/d in 2011 (P-trend = 0.001). In national dietary
surveys in 1995 and 2011–2012, added-sugars intake declined
markedly in adult men (from 72 to 59 g/d; 218%) but not in women
(44–42 g/d; NS). As a proportion of total energy, added-sugars in-
take fell 10% in adult men but nonsignificantly in adult women.
Between 1995 and 2011–2012, the proportion of energy from SSBs
(including 100% juice) declined 10% in adult men and 20% in
women. More marked changes were observed in children aged
2–18 y. Data from national grocery sales indicated that per capita
added-sugars intakes derived from carbonated soft drinks fell 26%
between 1997 and 2011 (from 23 to 17 g/d) with similar trends for
noncarbonated beverages.
Conclusions: In Australia, 4 independent data sets confirmed short-
er- and longer-term declines in the availability and intake of added
sugars, including those contributed by SSBs. The findings challenge
the widespread belief that energy from added sugars or sugars in
solution are uniquely linked to the prevalence of obesity.

INTRODUCTION
Between 1980 and 2013, the combined worldwide age-
standardized prevalence of overweight and obesity rose 28%
in adults and 47% in children (1). Attempts to explain the rise
have focused on increases in energy intake, changes in diet
composition, decreasing levels of physical activity, changes in
the gut microbiome, and maternal weight (2–5). In many
countries, particularly in the United States, the sharp increase in
the prevalence of obesity has coincided with a temporal increase
in the consumption of added sugars and sugar-sweetened bev-
erages (SSBs)5 (6, 7). This observation has precipitated nu-
merous observational studies and randomized controlled trials of
the effect of added sugars or SSB consumption on body weight
and cardiovascular disease risk factors (6, 8, 9). Most health
authorities have agreed that added sugars, and SSBs in partic-
ular, have played a dominant causative role (10). Therefore, it is
reasonable to assume that a reduction of added sugars or SSB
intake would lower the prevalences of obesity and chronic dis-
ease that are related to excess body fat as has been modeled by
several groups (11, 12). The labeling of added sugars and taxes
on SSBs have been recommended as part of the efforts to reduce
intake (13, 14).
Australian trends are relevant for several reasons. As shown
by a global analysis, Australia and New Zealand experienced the
single-largest absolute increase in adult obesity since 1980 (from
16% to 29%) and the single largest increase in adult female
obesity (1). More than 68% of Australian men and 56% of women
are overweight or obese, which is the second-largest sex gap in
overweight and obesity globally. Obesity rates for women aged
$20 y have reached 30%, which is more than quadruple the
obesity rates in girls (7%). For Australian boys, obesity preva-
lence climbed 4-fold from 7% in childhood to 28% in adulthood.
However, a previous analysis of food balance sheets of the
FAO Statistics Division Database (FAOSTAT) indicated that,
within the same time frame, Australia experienced a decline in

 the availability of refined sugars and sweeteners (15). Grocery
sales have also indicated a fall in the market share of SSBs and a
rise in intensely sweetened (diet) soft drinks (16). This inverse
relation between trends in the prevalence of overweight and
obesity and changes in the consumption of added sugars has been
termed the Australian Paradox (15, 17). The rising prevalence of
obesity in the face of apparently falling intake of added sugars
challenges the widespread belief that energy from sugars is
uniquely linked to changes in the incidence of obesity. Since its
publication in 2011, new sources of information, including na-
tional dietary surveys, have become available. In the current
study, we provide novel data on changes in the availability of
added and refined sugars and in recorded intakes of total sugars,
added sugars, SSB, carbonated soft drinks, juices, confectionery,
and alcohol consumption in Australian adults and children be-
tween the 2 most recent national dietary surveys in 1995 and
2011–2012.
METHODS
Data sources
We systematically searched scientific databases [MEDLINE
(https://www.nlm.nih.gov), Cinahl (https://www.ebscohost.
com/nursing/products/cinahl-databases/cinahl-complete), Embase
(https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/embase-biomedical-research),
and Cochrane (http://www.cochranelibrary.com)] for articles
published between 2009 and July 2016 to update our previous
analysis (15). The same keywords (sugars, sucrose, dietary car-
bohydrate, consumption, intake, sugar-sweetened beverages,
sweeteners, and refined sugar) and prespecified inclusion and
exclusion criteria were used. Australia was included as a search
term and the terms blood glucose and blood sugar were ex-
cluded. Only national-level (not state-level) consumption data that
were representative of the general population were included.
Prespecified outcomes were estimates of intake of total sugars,
added or refined sugars, and sugars in SSBs in absolute amounts,
percentages of energy, and percentages of total sugars. In addition
to the peer-reviewed literature, we included publications and data
that have been issued by the government, academia, and industry.
The websites of the WHO, FAO of the UN, Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS), Australian Food and Grocery Council, Austra-
lian Retailers Association, Commonwealth Scientific and Indus-
trial Research Organization (CSIRO), and the Australian Government
were searched for relevant information.
Definitions
In the current context, the term total sugars was used to refer to
the monosaccharides and disaccharides that are present in foods
both naturally occurring and those that are added during
processing or food preparation, but the term excludes oligo-
saccharides (degree of polymerization: 3–9). Total sugars in-
cluded glucose, fructose, galactose, sucrose, maltose, and
lactose. The term added sugars was used to refer to sugars that
have been added during food processing or food preparation.
SSBs were defined as drinks that contained added sugar, which
included cordials; carbonated soft drinks; flavored mineral
waters; energy, sports, and electrolyte drinks; fortified waters; and
fruit and vegetable drinks (water-based beverages that contained
some fruit and vegetable juice in addition to added sugars). The
definition of SSBs excluded 100% fruit and vegetable juices.
The definition of SSBs included drinks that were mixtures of
both nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners with lower total sugar
contents. Nonnutritively (intensely) sweetened or diet beverages
were defined as carbonated or still, plain or mineral waters and
beverages that were sweetened with nonnutritive sweeteners and
were not combined with nutritive sweeteners.
Availability of sugars and sweeteners
Food balance sheets are compiled every year by the FAO
mainly with country-level data on the production and trade of
food commodities (18). The FAO Methods and Standards have
used these data and the available information on waste co-
efficients, stock changes, and types of utilization (feed, food,
processing, and other) to prepare a supply and utilization account
for each commodity in units of weight. The food component of
the commodity account, which was derived as a balancing item,
was used to refer to the total amount of the commodity that was
available for human consumption during the year, including of
processed products that were derived from the food commodity,
and was expressed as primary commodity equivalents. The
FAOSTAT definition of sugars and sweeteners included sugar
cane (raw and centrifugal), sugar beet (raw and centrifugal),
refined sugar, confectionery sugar, flavored sugar, pure fructose
and syrups, maltose, glucose and dextrose, isoglucose, lactose,
maple sugar and syrups, and molasses. The FAOSTAT food
balance sheets took into account imports and sugars in processed
foods but may not have accounted for sugars that disappeared in
food fermentation.
Apparent consumption of refined sugars
Until 1998–1999, the consumption of refined sugars in Australia
was published as part of the apparent consumption of foodstuffs
series that was collected by the Australian government through its
statistical organization the ABS (19). Refined sugars was defined
as sucrose in the form of refined or raw sugars or liquified sugars
that were manufactured for human consumption and represented
the main form of added sugars consumed in Australia. Ex-
cluded from this definition of the apparent consumption of sugars
were other sweeteners such as honey, glucose, fructose, dextrose,
and syrups such as golden syrup and treacle. The term apparent
consumption was used because it assumed that all of the food-
stuffs available were consumed. The data were derived from
source collections including the agricultural census, agricultural
commodity survey, the manufacturing survey of inventories and
production, merchandise imports, merchandise exports, and live-
stock products. For merchandise exports and imports, the scope of
the collection concurred with that recommended by the UN
Statistical Division and covered all moveable goods (with some
identified exceptions) that subtracted from or added to Australia’s
stock of material resources as a result of their movement out of or
into Australia (19).
National dietary survey data: consumption of total sugars,
added sugars, and SSBs
Unlike the NHANES in the United States, Australia does not
undertake the regular monitoring of food and nutrient intakes.
DECLINING CONSUMPTION OF SUGARS IN AUSTRALIA

 The 2 most recent national dietary surveys that were undertaken
by the ABS in 1995 and 2011–2012 were included in the current
analysis. In the 1995 National Nutrition Survey (20), w14,000
people who were aged $2 y and were from all states and ter-
ritories participated in the survey with a 61% response rate. The
survey used the 3-pass method and 1 face-to-face 24-h dietary
recall with a pen-and-paper interview by trained nutritionists
who sought detailed information on all foods and beverages that
were consumed during the day before the interview (from
midnight until midnight). Each food and beverage was described
in sufficient detail to allow its nutrient composition to be de-
termined. The 1995 National Nutrition Survey Nutrient Com-
position Database was prepared specifically for the survey. Data
for children and youths (2–18 y old) and adults (19–70 y old)
were analyzed separately.
The 2011–2013 Australian Health Survey was the largest and
most-comprehensive health survey to be conducted in Australia
(21). The survey collected a range of information about health-
related issues including health status, risk factors, health-service
usage, and medication use. In 2011–2012, the survey incorporated
the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey, which in-
cluded detailed food intake information (21). In total, w12,000
adults and children aged $2 y were interviewed face-to-face
(77% response rate) with the use of the 5-pass method that was
developed by the USDA and the Agricultural Research Service
(22). One 24-h dietary recall was used to generate nutrient-intake
data with the use of the AUSNUT 2011–2013 food-composition
database.
Estimation of added-sugars intake
Added-sugars intake was generated in the 2011–2012 data set
with the use of the AUSNUT 2013 food-composition database
that was developed specifically for this purpose (21). Added
sugars were calculated for each food and beverage item on the
basis of the definition for added sugars in clause 1 of standard
2.8.1 of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (23).
By this definition, sugars were defined as follows: 1) hexose
monosaccharides and disaccharides including dextrose, fructose,
sucrose, and lactose; 2) starch hydrolysate; 3) glucose syrups,
maltodextrin, and similar products; 4) products derived from a
sugar refinery including brown sugar and molasses; 5) icing
sugar; 6) invert sugar; or 7) fruit-sugar syrup derived from any
source but not including malt, malt extracts, sorbitol, mannitol,
glycerol, xylitol, polydextrose, isomalt, maltitol, maltitol syrup,
or lactitol. Maltodextrins were not reported as part of total
sugars in the 2011–2012 survey and were excluded in this
analysis. Honey, 100% juice, and juice concentrates were not
included in the code and, therefore, were not considered added
sugars in this definition.
Because the ABS did not undertake an analysis of added sugars
for the 1995 survey, we used data that were generated by Cobiac
et al. (24) at the CSIRO. In their analysis, added sugars and
the energy contributions of added sugars were determined by
apportioning total sugars between added and natural sugars. The
added-sugars content of each food was defined as the quantity of
sugars that was added as sweetening agents during the
manufacturing, cooking, or preparation of the food (such as
granular sugar, syrups, and honey but not fruit or 100% fruit
juice). Added sugars were defined similarly in both data sets with
the exception that honey was considered an added sugar in 1995
but not in 2011–2012. Therefore, the precise amounts of honey
consumed in 1995 were generated from an analysis of changes
in food-commodity groups (25). To achieve comparable data
sets, sugars that were contributed by honey (adult men: 2.1 g/d;
adult women: 1.5 g/d; boys: 1.3 g/d; and girls: 0.8 g/d) were
subtracted from added-sugars intake in 1995.
In 2011–2012, the ABS included juice drinks but not pure
juices in their definition of sweetened beverages. This definition
varied from the 1995 data set in which 100% juices and juice
drinks were given as one line of data. Therefore, to obtain
comparable data sets, we combined all sweetened beverages
including 100% juices and juice drinks.
With the use of the 2011–2012 national survey data set, Lei
et al. (26) also estimated intake of added sugars via their own
derived database of the added-sugars contents of Australian
foods. Lei et al. (26) excluded one in 3 respondents because of
extreme levels of underreporting or overreporting of total energy
intakes, which left a subgroup of 8332 participants aged from
2 to $71 y who provided one 24-h recall.
With the use of both the 1995 and 2011–2012 national dietary
survey data sets, Ridoutt et al. (25) disaggregated w4500 food
items into basic foods to determine changes over time in relation
to the basic food groups. They adjusted for the underreporting of
total food intake by applying scaling factors of 16% and 1% for
women and men, respectively, in 1995 and of 21% and 17%,
respectively, in 2011.
Industry data on consumption of SSBs
An alternate independent source of information on trends in
the consumption of SSBs was industry-sales data. Levy and
Shrapnel (27) obtained grocery-sales surveys from the AC
Neilsen Scan Track national data set of all ready-to-drink, water-
based beverages in Australia, including sugar-based variants
(carbonated soft drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, iced tea, and
mineral water), nonsugar-based varieties, and still water. Milk-
based drinks and concentrated, syrup-based carbonated drinks
were excluded because they did not meet the criterion of being
ready to drink. Volume-sales data were adjusted by imputation to
include food-service, vending, convenience, and dining pur-
chases. The overall contribution of sugars in these products to the
food supply was determined by multiplying volume sales per
annum by the concentration of sugars per 100 mL for each
category of beverage. The absolute mass of sugars that was
contributed by water-based beverages was divided by the an-
nualized population data to determine per capita trends over time.
Statistical treatment
A linear model was used to determine trends over time in the
availability of sugars (FAOSTAT data), apparent consumption
(ABS data), and sugars that were contributed by SSBs (industry
data), for which the response variable was per capita intake, and
the predictor was the year in each model. For comparisons be-
tween 1995 and 2011–2012 intakes of nutrients, we used means,
relative SEs (RSE), and 95% CIs that were provided by the ABS
(20, 21) and showed the difference in the point estimate between
years by subtraction. To estimate the precision of the difference,
we first calculated the SE for each difference by dividing the
856

 respective 95% CIs by 1.96 as was recommended by the ABS
(22). We derived the SE for the difference by propagation of
error and calculated the 95% confidence limit that surrounded
the difference as the estimated difference 6 1.96 multiplied by
the SE for the difference. We inferred significance when the
95% confidence limits for the difference did not include zero
(28). In instances in which the 1995 ABS data set did not specify
the RSE (i.e., the percentage of energy that was derived from
SSBs plus 100% juice, soft drinks, sugary products, confec-
tionery, and alcoholic beverages and the percentage of sugars as
soft drinks), the RSE was assumed to be the same as in 2011–
2012. R computing software (version 3.2.3; https://www.
R-project.org/) was used for all statistical analyses. When
appropriate, estimates of the percentages of change were
rounded to the nearest whole number.
RESULTS
A total of 1427 articles were identified through databases and
government- and nongovernment-survey websites. Of these ar-
ticles, 38 full-text articles were eligible for further consideration
on the basis of titles and abstracts. A total of 28 of these 38
articles were excluded (12 analyses were state-based surveys, 10
articles did not provide sufficient information about the amounts
of sugars consumed, 4 analyses referred to the same survey, 1
article described the methodology only, and 1 analysis was
considered unreliable because volume and dollar values of im-
ports were used to estimate sugar availability) (29–31). Hence, 10
articles and data sources provided reliable national-level esti-
mates of sugars and SSB intake (Supplemental Figure 1).
Availability of sugars and sweeteners
The FAOSTAT data indicated that the per capita availability of
total sugars and sweeteners in Australia fell 16% over 3 decades
from 152 g/d in 1980 to 127 g/d in 2011 (the last year of data
collection; P-trend , 0.001) (Figure 1). The decline was greater
between 1980 and 2000, but the trend over 5 decades was lower.
Apparent consumption of refined sugars
McNeill and Shrapnel (32) compiled data on the longer-term
apparent consumption of refined sugars in Australia that was
published by the ABS from 1938 to 1998–99 (the ABS ceased
the data collection after 1998–1999) and, with the use of the
same methodology, extended the time frame to 2011. In their
analysis, the per capita apparent consumption of refined sugars
declined over a 50-y time frame from 139 g/d in 1961 to 115 g/d
in 2011 (217%) (Figure 1). Trends over time were similar but
not identical to the availability of sugars and sweeteners that was
recorded by the FAOSTAT. On average, absolute quantities were
11% lower with the use of ABS methodology. However, for
the last decade, the data more closely matched those of the
FAOSTAT.
National dietary survey data of total and added sugars
In adults $19 y of age, reported total energy intake declined
8% between 1995 and 2011–2012 (from 9422 to 8672 kJ/d)
(21). Much of the decline has been attributed to underreporting
with the highest levels of underreporting estimated to have been
in young men (22). As a proportion of total energy, total sugar,
total fat, and saturated fat intakes declined significantly, whereas
protein increased (P-all changes , 0.001) (Figure 2). More-
marked changes were evident in children and adolescents aged
2–18 y (Figure 2). Absolute intake of total sugars from all
sources, including added sugars and naturally occurring sugars
in fruit, vegetables, and milk products, fell 10% from 115 to

 103 g/d in adults (20, 21). Adult men showed larger declines in
total sugars with a decrease of 14% from 134 to 115 g/d,
whereas female intake fell 6% from 97 to 91 g/d (Table 1). Total
sugar intake fell more steeply in children from 161 to 120 g/d in
boys and from 128 to 105 g/d in girls (Table 1).
Added-sugars intake also declined 18% in adult men aged
$19 y (from 72 to 59 g/d) and 4.5% in adult women (from 44 to
42 g/d) (Table 1). As a proportion of total energy intake, added
sugars fell 10% in adult men (from 10% to 9% of energy) but
remained essentially the same in adult women (w9%) (Table 1).
There were steeper declines in children and youth aged 2–18 y.
Specifically, added-sugars intake fell 34% in boys (from 96 to
63 g/d) and 26% in girls (from 72 to 53 g/d) (Figure 3). When
expressed as a proportion of total energy intake, added sugars
fell 25% in boys (from 15% to 11%) and 22% in girls (from 14%
to 11%) (Table 1).
With the use of the same 2011–2012 data set, Lei et al. (26)
also estimated the intake of added sugars. The weighted mean 6 SD
added-sugars intake of the study population was 60 6 53 g/d or
15% higher than that estimated by the ABS.
With the use of both the 1995 and 2011–2012 national dietary
survey data sets, Ridoutt et al. (25) calculated that Australians
were eating more whole fruit and more wholegrain cereals but
consumed less refined sugars and less 100% fruit juice in 2011–
2012. Specifically, per capita refined-sugar intake decreased
from 78 to 60 g/d in younger Australians aged 2–18 y but re-
mained similar in adults (57–56 g/d).
National dietary survey data: SSBs
With the use of the 1995 and 2011–2012 data sets, the ABS
reported that adult consumers ($19 y of age) of SSBs on the day
of the survey decreased from 35% of the population in 1995 to
30.6% in 2011–2012 (213%) with the steepest decline in
younger adults aged 19–30 y (Figure 4). By contrast, the
consumption of intensely sweetened (diet) beverages increased
from 8.4% of adults aged $19 y in 1995 to 11.1% of adults aged
$19 y in 2011–2012 (+32%) (Table 2). Per consumer, adults
ingested 375 mL diet beverages/d.
The contribution of SSB plus 100% juice to energy intake also
declined 10% in adult men (from 5.1% to 4.6% of energy) and
20% in women aged $19 y (from 4.4% to 3.5% of energy)
(Table 1). The proportion of energy from soft drinks (defined as
sugar-sweetened carbonated beverages, flavored mineral waters,
and electrolyte, energy, and fortified drinks) also decreased 17%
in men (from 3% to 2.5% of energy) and 20% in women (from
2% to 1.6% of energy) (Figure 5). As a proportion of total
sugars, sugars that were contributed by soft drinks also declined
15% in adult men and 13% in adult women (Table 1).
The proportion of children and youth aged 2–18 y who con-
sumed SSBs on the day of the survey declined 31% (from 68.1%
in 1995 to 46.7% in 2011–2012) (Figure 4). The declines were
greater in younger children than in teenagers. In children aged
2–18 y, the proportion who consumed diet beverages also declined
from 8.5% in 1995 to 5.7% in 2011–2012 (Table 2). The pro-
portion of energy as SSBs plus 100% juice decreased from 9.3%
to 6.0% of energy (235%) in boys and from 9.0% to 5.1% of
energy (244%) in girls (Figure 6). The proportion of energy in
the form of soft drinks declined 26% in boys (from 3.7% to
2.7% of energy) and 36% in girls (from 3.0% to 1.9% of energy)
(Figure 5). Similarly, the proportion of total sugars in the form
of soft drinks fell 16% in boys and 27% in girls (Table 1). In
2011–2012, the total volume of SSBs consumed was 217 mL/d
across all children and was 355 mL/d in consumers only.
A second source of national-level data on intake of SSBs in
children was an analysis of the 2007 Australian Children’s
Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (33), which was a
computer-assisted 24-h dietary recall survey of 4400 nationally
representative children aged 2–16 y. On the day of the survey,
47% of children reported having consumed SSBs, which was

 similar to the percentage that was reported in the 2011–2012
survey. Across all children (including nonconsumers), 1.6% of
total energy was contributed by sugar-sweetened soft drinks, 2%
of total energy was contributed by 100% juice, and 1.4% of total
energy was contributed by cordials and fruit drinks (i.e., 5% of
total energy intake).
National dietary survey data: discretionary sugars, foods,
and alcoholic beverages
National dietary surveys in 1995 and 2011–2012 also gener-
ated information on the consumption and discretionary use of
sugars and confectionery (21). Sugary products and dishes were
defined as table sugar, honey, syrups, jams, marmalades, choc-
olate spreads, and dishes and products other than confectionery
in which sugars were the major component (e.g., meringue).
From 1995 to 2011–2012, intake fell progressively from 2.7% to
1.9% of energy (230%) in adult men and from 2.3% to 1.8% of
energy (222%) in women (Table 1). In contrast, intake of
confectionery [chocolate, licorice, sweets, and health bars
(e.g., cereal, nut, fruit, or seed bars)] rose in men (+47%; from
1.5% to 2.2% of energy) and in women (+43%; from 2.1% to
3.0% of energy) (Table 1). Over the same time frame, alcoholic
beverage intake also increased from 6.4% to 7.0% of energy
(+9%) in adult men and from 3.4% to 6.0% of energy (+77%) in
adult women (Table 1). Beer and wine were the main sources
(w80% of energy from alcoholic beverages), and the highest

DECLINING CONSUMPTION OF SUGARS IN AUSTRALIA

 consumers were men aged 51–70 y (8.5% of energy) and 31–
50 y (7.2% of energy), but they were closely followed by women
aged 51–70 y (6.0% of energy).
In adults aged $19 y who reported the consumption of al-
coholic beverages (29% of all adults) in 2011–2012, the ABS
reported that alcohol contributed 16% of total energy. In con-
trast, in those who reported the consumption of SSBs (31% of all
adults), the sugars in the SSBs contributed 8.3% of energy.
Industry data on consumption of SSBs
According to an industry analysis (27), total sales of all
nonalcoholic, water-based beverages in Australia increased 26%
from 1997 to 2011, which was driven largely by increasing sales
of nonsugar beverages (+73%). SSB sales also grew modestly
(+5%) over the same time frame, which was largely due to sports
drinks and other new categories (e.g., vitamin waters) with lower
concentrations of sugars than in conventional SSBs. By 2011, the
volume share of nonsugar beverages had reached 42%, which was
up from 30% in 1997. Per capita, from 1997 to 2011, there was a
significant (P , 0.05) decline in the volume of SSB purchased
(211 L/y), particularly of carbonated SSBs, and an increase in
nonsugar beverages (+16 L/y). Per capita sales of carbonated
SSBs lost 18% of volume (220 L/y) over the 15 y. At the same
time, per capita sales of nonsugar carbonated beverages in-
creased 24% (from 22.8 to 28.2 L/y). Sales of nonsugar mineral
waters grew 60% and nonflavored still water increased 4-fold
from 1997 to 2011.
Although changes in the volume of SSBs consumed are in-
formative, they are not indicative of the sugars and energy that are
contributed by SSBs. Changes in the formulation that reduced
sugar concentrations also occurred over the 15-y period of study
(34). With the use of the raw data provided, we calculated that the
per capita amount of sugars that was contributed by water-based
beverages declined 16% from 25 g/d in 1997 to 21 g/d in 2011
(Figure 6). The largest per capita decrease (226%) was in
carbonated soft drinks from 23 to 17 g/d.
The industry analysis also provided the usual consumption
patterns of SSBs according to the AC Nielsen Home Scan
Consumer Panel, which is a survey of 10,000 households that are
chosen to be representative of the Australian population (27).
Participants used a scanner to record all household purchases
from supermarkets, convenience stores, and pharmacies over a
1-y period. The data indicated that 84% of individuals purchased
SSBs, and 56% of individuals purchased nonsugar varieties.

 Teenage boys had the highest proportion of carbonated SSB
purchases, whereas teenage girls had high proportions of both
still-water and carbonated SSB purchases. Over time, lower-
income families purchased less volume shares of both sugar-
sweetened and nonsugar carbonated soft drinks, which were
taken up by families in the high-income bracket. This data set
revealed changes in the proportion of beverage variants. The ratio
of sales of carbonated beverages that were classified as nonsugar
compared with sugar-sweetened increased from 1:3 in 1997 to
1:2 in 2011. Similarly, in the sugar-sweetened varieties, there
were changes in the proportionate contribution of variants with
lower concentration of sugars. SSBs with conventional sugar
contents (.10 g sugars/100 mL) dropped from 93% in 1997 to
81% in 2011 of the total sugars that were contributed by all
water-based beverages. SSBs that had lower sugar contents
(,10 g/100 mL) went from 6.5% to 19.4%, which was a w3-
fold rise, whereas SSBs with ,6 g sugar/100 mL increased from
3.6% to 8.9% of total sugar, which was a w2.5-fold rise.
The main findings in this analysis are summarized in Figure 7
and include the trend-line changes from 1995 to 2011 for the
availability of sugars and sweeteners (FAOSTAT), the apparent
consumption of refined sugars (ABS), and sugars added to
carbonated soft drinks (industry data) compared with the
changes in total sugars, added sugars, and sugars as soft drinks
according to national dietary surveys in 1995 and 2011–2012.
Similar downward slopes were evident. In contrast, the age-
standardized prevalence of obesity in Australia climbed 80%
between 1980 and 2013 (1), which was a time frame during
which the availability of sugars and sweeteners declined 16%
(Figure 8).
DISCUSSION
In this analysis of multiple independent data sets that
encompassed the availability of added and refined sugars, na-
tional dietary surveys, and beverage-industry grocery sales in
Australia, we showed a substantial decline in refined sugars and
SSB consumption. Compared with our 2011 article (15), the
current analysis provides novel data on changes in recorded
intakes of total sugars, added sugars, SSB, carbonated soft drinks,
juices, confectionery, and alcohol in Australian adults and
children between the 2 most recent national dietary surveys. The
current analysis extended the FAOSTAT series forward and
backward to show 50-y trends and directly compared the
FAOSTAT sugar availability with the ABS apparent consump-
tion. Our study included new findings from the CSIRO (25) and
Levy and Shrapnel (27), and it showed the concordance of
changes within the different data sets.
According to the current study, the per capita availability of
sugars and sweeteners fell 16% between 1980 and 2011, which
was a fall that was equivalent to a per capita reduction of added-
sugars intake by w230 g/y for 30 y. Between 1995 and 2011,
the reported intake of added sugars (grams per day) in na-
tional dietary surveys declined 18% in adult men but remained
essentially unchanged in adult women (42 g/d). Larger de-
clines of the order of 26–34% occurred in children aged 2–18 y.
The proportion of energy consumed as SSBs, including juice,
also declined 15% in adults and 40% in children and youth.
Currently relatively small amounts of energy are consumed
from this category (i.e., 4% in adults and 5.5% in children).
Industry data that were based on sales and sugar concentra-
tions of soft drink variants over the same time frame also
indicated that the contribution of sugars to carbonated soft drinks
decreased 26% on a per capita basis, which was equivalent to
157 g/y for 14 y.
The overall downward trend in the availability of added sugars
in Australia during the 3 decades when obesity increased dra-
matically (1980–2011) was unusual but not unique. According
to the food balance sheets that were compiled by the FAOSTAT,
the United Kingdom showed a decline of similar magnitude to
that shown in Australia. However, the United States, Canada,
Switzerland, other countries in Europe, and our near neighbor
New Zealand have all experienced an increased availability of
added sugars. In the United States, the rise in sugar availability
peaked in 2000 and began to fall, which was a pattern that was
corroborated by changes in recorded intakes of added sugars
according to NHANES data in the same time frame (35).
FIGURE 7
Summary of findings. Changes from 1995 to 2011 in sugars
availability, apparent consumption of refined sugars, and sugars in sugar-
sweetened carbonated beverages were interpolated from the linear trend
lines shown in Figures 1 and 6. Changes in total sugars, added sugars, sugary
products, and sugars in soft drinks (defined as sugar-sweetened carbonated
beverages; flavored mineral waters; and electrolyte, energy, and fortified
drinks) were reported intakes from national dietary surveys in 1995 and
2011–2012. FAOSTAT, FAO Statistics Division Database.

DECLINING CONSUMPTION OF SUGARS IN AUSTRALIA

 The driving force behind the downward trend in added sugar
consumption likely included an increasing health and weight
consciousness, which was principally driven by social forces, but
also by a succession of national dietary guidelines that called for a
moderation of refined-sugar intake. An extensive advertising
campaign by the sugar industry failed to reverse the downward trend
(36), and surveys indicated a simultaneous rise in intakes of non-
nutritive sweeteners (37). Currently, Australia appears to have one of
the highest ratios of diet beverages to conventional sugar-sweetened
soft drinks whereby .1 in 2 carbonated beverages that are pur-
chased are intensely sweetened (27). Although reliable data are
lacking, one source has suggested that only 20% of total soda sales
are of the diet variety in the United States compared with 33% in
Norway and 29% in the United Kingdom (38).
The strengths and limitations of this analysis should be noted.
Per capita availability, apparent consumption, and grocery data
are useful in determining upward or downward trends over time
and describing theoretical maximum sugar intake for the entire
population. However, like all data of this nature, the data
overestimate individual intake because of losses that occur when
foods are prepared and consumed including plate wastage. Nu-
trient intake that is derived from these sources is representative of
the whole population but not of subgroups. In contrast, national
dietary surveys can provide good estimates of changes in usual
intakes of subgroups of the population, including men, women,
children, and adults (both sexes), provided that the data are
carefully collected. Recall-precision accuracy, low response
rates, reporting and classification errors were common in both the
1995 and 2011–2012 dietary surveys (20, 22) and may have
introduced confounding. Underreporting was more of a concern
in 2011–2012. Compared with 1995, overall energy intake fell
(28%), but the energy from soft drinks fell more (217% in
adult men and 220% in adult women). In our analysis, we
addressed underreporting in the following 2 ways: by expressing
sugars intake as a percentage of total energy intake and as a
proportion of total sugars intake in addition to absolute intake
(grams per day). In contrast to SSBs, reported energy intakes
from alcoholic beverages and confectionery increased, which
suggested that the decrease in SSB intake may have been real
rather than underreported. Furthermore, industry data on SSBs
have been consistent with the dietary survey data showing that
the contribution of sugars to SSBs has fallen by the same
amount (217%) over a similar time frame (27).
The data generated by the sugar and beverage industry for its
own purposes has been questioned because of a lack of in-
dependent monitoring (32). However, grocery sales provide
critical information on product usage and insights into the food
environment that influence financial decisions and new-product
development (32). The industry figures reported in the current
study were corroborated by national dietary surveys that
indicated a similar downward trend.
The 2015–2020 US Dietary Guidelines state that added sugars
are an important factor in the obesity crisis and have set con-
servative guidelines for added sugars (39). Specifically, the
guidelines recommend #10% total energy/d should come from
added sugars. The 2011–2012 national survey suggested that the
average Australian adult had already met this target (9% of total
energy), but usual intake of added sugars by children and ado-
lescents was 11% of energy (21). There are subgroups of the
Australian population with larger intakes, particularly teenage
males (13% of energy) and indigenous adults and children (13%
of energy), for whom continuing efforts to reduce added-sugars
intake are needed.
Australia, like other developed nations, has experienced a
steep 3-fold increase in the prevalence of adult obesity within a
30-y time frame. Between the 2 national surveys in 1995 and
2011–2012, adult men and women gained, on average, 3.6 and
4 kg, respectively (21). In children aged 2–17 y, the prevalence
of overweight and obesity increased from 21% in 1995 to 25%
in 2011–2012. Therefore, the overall downward trends in the
availability of refined sugars and estimated intakes of added
sugars and SSBs are at odds with an incremental weight gain in
the population as a whole. These findings challenge the wide-
spread belief that energy from sugars is uniquely linked to
changes in the incidence of obesity (1). Other studies that have
used individual dietary intakes have also reported inverse as-
sociations between added-sugars intake and body weight. In an
analysis of obesity and energy supply in the WHO MONICA
(Multinational MONItoring of trends and determinants in
CArdiovascular disease) Project, which encompassed Western
European countries, Australia, the United States, and China,
there was a small effect of total fat, but the energy supply
from total sweeteners per capita showed no relation with
obesity (40). Sugar availability has increased in some coun-
tries (e.g., Switzerland) where the women have remained the
same BMI for .4 decades (1).
The downward trends over time argue against the assumption
that the reduced consumption of refined sugars and SSB will, in
themselves, help to reverse societal trends in obesity and chronic
disease. Although an overconsumption of energy relative to needs
must be addressed to halt the obesity epidemic, our analysis
provides little evidence to support a particular focus on any one
source of energy. Inappropriately high intakes of savory foods or,
indeed, of any energy source (alcohol, fat, protein, starch, or
sugars) will result in weight gain.
Our findings suggest that there may be unintended conse-
quences of a singular focus on refined sugars and SSBs. One
possibility is that potentially more-important sources of excess
energy, such as alcoholic beverages in adults and energy-dense
savory snacks in children, are being overlooked with the cur-
rent emphasis on the restriction of soft drinks. From 1995 to
2011–2012, the proportion of energy from alcohol increased
77% in Australian women, whereas that from soft drinks fell
20% (21). The 2007 National Children’s Survey showed the
quantity of food consumed as pizza, potato crisps, and similar
salty products had increased, whereas that of SSBs fell (41).
In conclusion, our analysis suggests that Australians have
adopted dietary recommendations to limit intake of refined
sugars by reducing intakes of SSBs, discretionary sugars, and
sugary products. Over a time frame of .30 y, downward trends
in the availability of sugars and sweeteners, reported intake of
energy in the form of added sugars and SSBs, and industry data
on sugar contributions to SSBs have been paralleled by a sus-
tained rise in the prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities
(42). A coordinated approach to lowering intakes of all discre-
tionary foods and beverages is needed to balance energy intake
with energy expenditure. The current findings warrant consid-
eration by other nations in their efforts to identify effective in-
terventions for obesity prevention.
