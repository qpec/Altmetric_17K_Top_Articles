ABSTRACT
Although turmeric and its curcumin-enriched extracts have been used for treating arthritis, no systematic review
and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been conducted to evaluate the strength of the research. We
systemically evaluated all RCTs of turmeric extracts and curcumin for treating arthritis symptoms to elucidate the efficacy of
curcuma for alleviating the symptoms of arthritis. Literature searches were conducted using 12 electronic databases, includ-
ing PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Korean databases, Chinese medical databases, and Indian scientific database. Search
terms used were ‘‘turmeric,’’ ‘‘curcuma,’’ ‘‘curcumin,’’ ‘‘arthritis,’’ and ‘‘osteoarthritis.’’ A pain visual analogue score (PVAS)
and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were used for the major outcomes of arthritis.
Initial searches yielded 29 articles, of which 8 met specific selection criteria. Three among the included RCTs reported reduction
of PVAS (mean difference: -2.04 [-2.85, -1.24]) with turmeric/curcumin in comparison with placebo (P < .00001), whereas meta-
analysis of four studies showed a decrease of WOMAC with turmeric/curcumin treatment (mean difference: -15.36 [-26.9,
-3.77]; P =.009). Furthermore, there was no significant mean difference in PVAS between turmeric/curcumin and pain medicine
in meta-analysis of five studies. Eight RCTs included in the review exhibited low to moderate risk of bias. There was no
publication bias in the meta-analysis. In conclusion, these RCTs provide scientific evidence that supports the efficacy of turmeric
extract (about 1000 mg/day of curcumin) in the treatment of arthritis. However, the total number of RCTs included in the analysis,
the total sample size, and the methodological quality of the primary studies were not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions.
Thus, more rigorous and larger studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of turmeric for arthritis.

INTRODUCTION
T
he term arthritis is derived from the Greek words
‘‘artho’’ and ‘‘itis,’’ meaning joint and inflammation,
respectively. Arthritis is a form of joint disorder characterized
by chronic inflammation in one or more joints that usually re-
sults in pain and is often disabling.1,2 Arthritis includes more
than 100 different forms: the most common form is osteoar-
thritis, but other forms include rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic
arthritis, and related autoimmune diseases.1,2 Although the
causes of these diseases are different, their symptoms and
treatments are similar. As osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint
disease, the number of people with arthritis is also growing with
theincreaseintheagingpopulation.1Theworldwideprevalence
of knee osteoarthritis increased 26.6% from 1990 to 2010, and it
affects about 9.6% of men and 18% of women more than 60
years of age.3 The occurrence of osteoarthritis increases with
ageduetothedecreasedcapacitytosuppressinflammation,age-
related sarcopenia, and increased bone turnover.1 Rheumatoid
arthritis is a systemic inflammatory and destructive joint disease
with a prevalence of about 1–2% of the adult population
worldwide.2
Although arthritis is associated with inflammation and
pain, the exact cause of arthritis remains uncertain, and there
is no treatment for its fundamental causes. The major goal of
arthritis treatment is to reduce joint pain induced by in-
flammation in the joints, daily wear and tear of joints, and
muscle strains.4 The existing pharmaceuticals for treating
arthritis are analgesics, steroids, and nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which reduce the symptoms
such as severe pain and inflammation.5 Classical NSAIDs
are cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors that inhibit prostaglandin
and thromboxane synthesis, thereby reducing inflammation.5

 New NSAIDs selectively inhibit COX-2 and are usually
specific to inflamed tissue, which decreases the risk of
peptic ulcer.5 However, their long-term use cannot be sus-
tained due to inadequate pain relief, immune disturbances,
and serious gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse
events.6 Therefore, herbal therapies with anti-inflammatory
properties and minimum side effects are needed for the
treatment of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis and
osteoarthritis, especially after the withdrawal of many Food
and Drug Administration-approved anti-inflammatory drugs.7
Curcuma longa and Zingiber officinale, both of which
belong to the Ziangiberaceae family, are potential alterna-
tive medicines for arthritis.8,9 They have been used as sea-
sonings in many ethnic cuisines in various countries such
as Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. They have long been
used as anti-inflammatory treatments in traditional Chinese
and Ayurvedic medicines.10 The effective components of Z.
officinale: gingerols, shogaols, zingerone, and paradol, and
ginger itself have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory
effects by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2, nuclear factor kappa-
light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-jB), and
5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX).11 Several systematic reviews of
clinical trials have shown that ginger may reduce the subjec-
tive experience of pain in some conditions such as muscular
diseases.12 In addition, turmeric extracts have activities similar
to ginger although they have different effective compounds.
Several studies have evaluated the efficacy of turmeric ex-
tracts for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders.13
Although turmeric belongs to the Zingiberaceae family,
turmeric contains different bioactive components, mainly
curcumin and demethoxycurcumin, bis-demethoxycurcumin,
and turmeric essential oils. When used as an alternative
medicine or dietary supplement, turmeric is typically used
as an extract that is standardized to 80–95% curcuminoids,
primarily curcumin. Turmeric and its derivatives have anti-
inflammatory activities. Unlike ginger, turmeric and cur-
cumin do not modulate COX-1 activity,14,15 but modify
NF-jB signaling, proinflammatory cytokines such as in-
terleukin production and phospholipase A2, COX-2, and
5-LOX activities. Curcumin also modulates the expressions
of various transcription factors involved in energy metab-
olism such as signal transducer and activator of transcrip-
tion, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c, activator
protein-1, cAMP responding element binding protein, es-
trogen response element, and others.15 As a result, turmeric
and its components have been reported to exert beneficial
effects on osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia.
Turmeric is better tolerated than ginger and pepper due
to being less hot and spicy. Therefore, it is important to
conduct a systematic review of the antiarthritis effects of
curcuma.
The purpose of this review was to systemically evaluate
all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of turmeric and cur-
cumin for treating arthritis symptoms and to elucidate the
efficacy of curcuma for alleviating the symptoms of arthri-
tis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic
review and meta-analysis of RCTs on the efficacy of tur-
meric for arthritis symptoms.
METHODS
Data sources and selection criteria
The
following electronic
databases
were
searched:
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Korean databases such
as DBpia, the Research Information Service System (RISS),
the Korean Information Service System (KISS), Chinese
medical databases such as China National Knowledge In-
frastructure (CNKI) and the Chinese Scientific Journals
Database, the Indian Medical Journals and the Indian
Journals. Dissertations were also included. The search was
conducted in the databases using proper languages of En-
glish, Korean, and Chinese. The following keywords of
Medical Sub Headings (MeSH) were used as search terms:
‘‘curcumin,’’ ‘‘curcuma,’’ ‘‘turmeric,’’ ‘‘Curcuma domes-
tica,’’ ‘‘Curcuma Longa,’’ ‘‘arthritis,’’ ‘‘osteoarthritis,’’
‘‘randomized,’’ ‘‘controlled trial,’’ and ‘‘clinical trial.’’ In
the systematic review, all RCTs were included from the
available databases (as far back as 1966 in PubMed) up to
April, 2016, that had examined the effects of turmeric
(Curcuma) and curcumin on arthritis.
Article evaluation and selection
Two independent reviewers (J.W.D. and M.Y.) screened
the articles. In the first screening, the related articles were
identified by the titles and abstracts of the articles and the
relevant articles were retrieved in full text and validated for
inclusion in the systematic review. The third reviewer (S.P.)
independently validated the selected articles.
Eligibility criteria for studies used in this review
All prospective randomized clinical studies using tur-
meric (C. longa and the synonym domestica) and curcumin
for the treatment of arthritis were included in this systematic
review. Exclusion criteria included in vitro studies, in vivo
studies in nonhuman species, studies that were only pub-
lished in abstract form or included insufficient data to
properly evaluate the outcomes, nonclinical trial studies,
and studies in which arthritis was not the primary outcome
measured, and then we eliminated the duplicates. A flow
diagram of the article selection process is shown in Figure 1.
Although no language barriers were imposed, all stud-
ies included in this review were written in English. Dis-
sertations about randomized clinical studies were also
included.
Subjects and intervention
Subjects included in the studies were mostly middle-
age and elderly men and women, although the ages varied
among the studies. Subjects were recruited with degen-
erative primary knee osteoarthritis16–23 and rheumatoid
arthritis24 with mild-to-moderate severity according to the
American Rheumatism Association criteria. Subjects in
most studies had pain scores ‡5 of 10 on the numerical
rating scale.25 Inclusion criteria are summarized by study in
718
DAILY ET AL.
 Table 1. Two studies did not include exclusion criteria.20,21
Exclusion criteria of subjects were somewhat different
among the other studies but four studies excluded the pa-
tients who had conditions that would prevent the use of
treatment protocols such as abnormal liver or renal function,
history of peptic ulcer, allergy to curcumin, curcuminoids,
or other drugs used in the study such as ibuprofen, diclo-
fenac sodium, and glucosamine.16–18,24 Several studies ex-
cluded subjects with conditions that would interfere with the
outcome assessments or act as confounders in the study,
including secondary osteoarthritis, candidates for surgical
joint replacement or any other surgical treatment, presence
of heart, renal, and liver failure, using corticosteroids with
doses more than 10 mg/day during the preceding 3 months,
history of psychological disorders, and intraarticular injec-
tions during the preceding 3 months.17,19,22–24 Other exclu-
sions included pregnancy or lactation,19,23,24 body mass
index >25,19,23 severe bone or joint deformity,23 history of
infections resulting in hospitalization,24 recent use of anti-
inflammatory drugs, or abuse of drugs or alcohol.24 The
subjects were instructed not to use any medications or herbs
other than those provided by the study during the experi-
mental periods.
The studies included in the systematic review utilized
turmeric extracts and its components, mostly curcuminoids,
and in one study polysaccarides, which were considered as
the primary effective component for osteoarthritis. Etha-
nolic extracts of turmeric were used in two studies,16,18 and
water extracts rich in polysaccharides were used in one
study.22 In the remaining five studies,17,19–21,24 curcumin or
curcumin-containing mixture was considered as treatments
(Table 1).
Outcome measures
Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis have similar
symptoms such as pain, tenderness, swelling, and stiffness.
The severity of arthritis was determined by the Western
Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index
(WOMAC)26 and pain visual analogue score (PVAS)27 for
pain. WOMAC is a standardized index for the assessment of
the severity of osteoarthritis symptoms. PVAS is a tool
widely used to measure pain. The validity and reliability of
WOMAC and PVAS have been established.26 WOMAC
consisted of subclasses 5 items for pain, 2 items for stiffness,
and 17 items for physical functioning. Each item was rated
from 0 to 4 and the total scoring for pain, stiffness, and
physical function was calculated by adding each item for the
categories. However, one study22 measured only five items
for pain. Subjects answered a perception of pain intensity on
a 10 cm horizontal scale in the PVAS assessment and the
severity was represented by the scores of 0–10. In WOMAC
and PVAS, a lower score indicated less severe symptoms.
WOMAC for pain and PVAS were used as outcome mea-
sures for meta-analysis.
Other outcome measures used in the studies were to
evaluate function of joints and stiffness when pain was de-
termined by PVAS. In addition, pain associated with daily
tasks such as running and walking upstairs,16,21,24 clinician
global impression of change,22 and Lequesne’s pain func-
tional index (LPFI)17 was measured.
Quality assessment of the articles
The Cochrane tool was used to assess quality of the RCT
articles included in this systematic review by determining

 the risk of bias (ROB).28 This validated tool consists of the
following eight categories: (1) random sequence generation,
(2) allocation concealment, (3) blinding of participants, (4)
assessor blinding, (5) reporting drop out or withdrawal, (6)
intention to treat, (7) selective outcome reporting, and (8)
other potential bias. Each category was scored as H, high
ROB, U, uncertain ROB, or L, low ROB. Three independent
reviewers (M.Y., S.P., and J.W.D.) performed the quality
assessment, and disagreement on scores was resolved
through discussion.
Data analysis
The data used for the meta-analysis were continuous
variables of PVAS and arthritis symptoms (WOMAC for
pain), and means and standard deviations were used for the
meta-analysis. However, two studies20,21 were not included
in the meta-analysis since they did not provide the means
and standard deviations in the articles. Standard mean dif-
ferences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
for a PVAS and WOMAC using the Cochrane Collabora-
tion’s software (RevMan Version 5.0 for Windows; The
Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Since the
studies showed small variations in clinical heterogeneity
between each study such as age, dose of curcuma, and
treatment duration, the studies had low heterogeneity.
However, in some meta-analysis, PVAS and WOMAC for
pain were pooled together since both indexes presented the
intensity of pain but their scales were different. When both
indexes were pooled, random effect models were used. In
addition, the heterogeneity was quantitatively confirmed
with the heterogeneity analysis (Cochran’s Q) of studies in
meta-analysis. In the heterogeneity test, the heterogeneity of
the included studies was considered to be low at I2 £ 25%,
moderate at I2 £ 50%, high at I2 £ 75%, and very high at I2
> 75%.29 When I2 value was low, the fixed effect model was
selected and otherwise the random model was used. The
meta-analysis was conducted with data from parallel-group
design studies between curcuma and placebo treatments or
pain killer treatment. Funnel plots were used to detect re-
porting biases for this systematic review since the number of
studies included was less than 10.
Subgroup analysis
Eight studies were included in the systematic review, but
all could not be included in the meta-analysis since their
control groups were either placebo or pain killer, and the data
formats were not matched with each other. Six studies pro-
vided means and standard deviation of PVASs,16,17,20–22,24
whereas four studies gave those of WOMAC.17,18,22,23 Thus,
six and four studies were included in the meta-analyses of
PVAS and WOMAC, respectively. The subgroup analysis
could not be done for this study. Fortunately, the dosage of
curcumin or turmeric was similarly assigned among the
studies: it was prescribed with about 1 g/day without giving
other pain killers and about 500 mg/day with pain killers.
However, the experimental periods varied among the studies
and ranged from 4 weeks to 4 months. It is better to conduct
meta-analysis with subgroups according to short-term and
long-term studies. Although the meta-analysis could not be
performed according to the duration of the study, the adverse
effects were reviewed with the duration of the study.
RESULTS
Summary of included studies
A total of 10,293 studies were found in the initial elec-
tronic searches from PubMed, Embase, WANFANG, CNKI,
RISS, KISS, and IndMED, and 28 duplicates were removed.
From the remaining 10,265 studies, those potentially not
related RCT studies about curcumin and arthritis were re-
moved and the details of the removed studies were as fol-
lows: 176 in vitro studies, 7367 animal experiments, 1198
no relation to arthritis, 1325 no relation to turmeric or
curcumin, and 150 nonarthritis orthopedic-related studies
(Fig. 1). Further evaluation of the full texts resulted in the
elimination of 8 studies with lack of data and 33 studies due
to non-RCT. Finally, eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria
(Fig. 1). The eight RCTs were used for the systematic re-
view.16–18,20–24 The subject characteristics and intervention
strategies of the included RCTs are summarized in Table 1
and intervention results and adverse events are organized in
Table 2.
Middle-age and elderly adults of both genders were
mainly included in the selected studies (Table 1). Subjects
in the selected studies had arthritis with either PVAS
greater than 5 or with morning stiffness lasting less than 30
min, indicating moderate symptoms of osteoarthritis
(Table 1). Subjects were excluded when they had the
following problems: allergy to curcuminoids and pain
killers such as ibuprofen that were used as the control
group, secondary arthritis, current use of any immuno-
therapy, including corticosteroids, liver damage, serious
chronic metabolic diseases other than arthritis such as
diabetes, inflammatory disorders, heart, renal, and liver
failure, and severe arthritis to be a candidate for surgical
joint replacement.
Six of the studies were performed in Middle East and
Asian countries and two studies were conducted in the
United States and Italy as given in Table 2. Six RCTs,16–21,23
one RCT,24 and one RCT22 had two-arm, three-arm, and
four-arm parallel design, respectively. The three-arm par-
allel design study included the groups of curcumin only,
curcumin+diclofenac
sodium,
and
diclofenac
sodium
groups, and the four-arm parallel design study consisted of
curcumin only, curcumin+glucosamine, glucosamine only,
and placebo. Six RCTs contained curcumin powder and
placebo groups17,20–24 and four studies used pain killers
such as ibuprofen, diclofene, or glucosamine as a control
group.16,18,22,24 The dosage of curcumin was varied in dif-
ferent studies within 100–2000 mg/day and the curcumin or
turmeric was provided one to four times a day with up to
500 mg per time. One study22 used a polysaccharide-rich
extract that contained no curcumin (Table 2).

 Risk of bias
Table 3 shows the ROB assessment for the included
RCTs. Among eight RCTs, four RCTs were classified as
high quality17,18,20,23 and four RCTs had a moderate quali-
ty.16,21,22,24 Three studies used a proper method for ran-
domization of the subjects such as coin flipping and
computer-generated random numbers and the allocation of
the groups was concealed to the subjects and also practi-
tioners,17,20,24 but the remaining studies did not describe
how the subjects were randomized and allocated. Six RCTs
used blinding of patients and practitioners,16,18,20,22–24 but
the remaining two RCTs did not mention their blindness to
the practitioners. The drop-out rates were not high and they
were not different between experimental and placebo
groups. Two studies did not report the drop-out rates.23,24
Outcomes
The symptoms of arthritis, including osteoarthritis and
rheumatoid arthritis, were mainly pain and inflammation
and the symptoms were classified as pain, stiffness, swol-
lenness, and movement. Most of the studies measured the
severity of arthritis symptoms by pain, stiffness, and func-
tion, and the severity was scaled by PVAS and WOMAC.
In four studies, the severity of pain was scaled by
PVAS16,20,21,24 and by WOMAC.18,23 Two studies measured
both scales.17,22 As a result, three sets of meta-analysis were
performed to compare PVAS between curcuma and place-
bo,17,22,24 PVAS between curcuma and pain medicine,16,18,22,24
and WOMAC between curcuma and placebo.17,22,23 Since
WOMAC for pain was used for meta-analysis, six results of
pain index were combined for comparing between curcumin
and placebo from four studies.17,19,22,24
Since two studies20,21 did not provide means and standard
deviation for PVAS or WOMAC at the end of the study, six
studies were used for meta-analysis. Furthermore, since
the studies measured either PVAS16,24 or WOMAC18,23 or
both,17,22 and the control group was either placebo17,23 or
pain medicine16,18 or both,22,24 three combinations were
made for meta-analysis. Figure 2A provided the pooled re-
sults of PVASs between curcumin and placebo groups from
the meta-analysis of three studies.17,22,24 The PVAS was
much lower in the curcumin group than in the placebo
groups (overall mean differences and CI: -2.04 and -2.85,
-1.24; P < .00001). In addition, the pooled PVAS and
WOMAC pain score from five results for three studies17,22,24
were much lower in the curcuma group than in the placebo
group (overall mean differences and CI: -15.26 and -26.94,
-3.77; P = .009; Fig. 2B). Figure 2C shows the pooled re-
sults of PVAS and WOMAC score between curcumin and
pain medicine groups from five studies.16,18,19,22,24 The
pooled pain indexes of PVAS and WOMAC from five
studies were not significantly different between the curcu-
min and commercially available pain medicine such as
ibuprofen, diclofenac, and glucosamine (overall mean dif-
ferences and CI: -1.89 and -4.13, 0.35; P = .10). These re-
sults suggested that curcumin (about 1 g/day) might have
similar effects as analgesic medicines.
Since the symptoms of osteoarthritis were evaluated
mainly by pain, the outcome measures were quantitatively
determined by the severity of pain. Most studies used PVAS
or pain index in WOMAC (Table 2). Some studies used
different methods: frequencies of pain killer used during the
study were decreased17,20,22; the distance to walk for 6 min,
pain on level walking, pain on stars, and time spent on 100 m
walk were not significantly different between the curcumin
and ibuprofen groups.16,18 In addition to pain levels, the
functional changes in the joints were important factors to
determine the severity of arthritis. Functional changes can
be measured on the WOMAC subscales such as morning
stiffness and function, LPFI, Karnosfki Performance Scale
index, and Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM).

 Total scores of WOMAC subscales were also lower in the
curcumin group than in the placebo group.17,19 LPFI was
significantly reduced in the curcumin group in comparison
with the placebo group,17 whereas JKOM decreased in the
curcumin group more than in the placebo group, but it was
not significantly different20 (Table 2). Karnosfki Perfor-
mance Scale index was increased in the curcumin group in
compared with the chondroitin group, indicating that the
performance was improved with curcumin (Meriva).19
These results suggested that curcumin improved joint
function measured by morning stiffness, movements, and
other clinical assessments in comparison with the placebo
group. However, it did not indicate the fundamental im-
provement of arthritis symptoms.
Publication bias
A symmetrical funnel plot was produced by this meta-
analysis (the hollow circles in Fig. 3), which indicated there
was no publication bias.
Adverse events
Six RCTs16–18,20,21,24 reported adverse effects in both the
control and experimental groups. Curcumin containing
herbs and curcumin showed mild fever and throat infection,
gastrointestinal symptoms, hair loss, tachycardia, hyper-
tension, and redness of tongue (Table 2). However, other
control groups such as placebo and pain medicine (ibupro-
fen and diclofenac) also showed similar adverse effects such
as gastrointestinal symptoms, itching, swelling around eyes
and face, dimness of vision, unwell feeling, and renal dys-
function. Two RCTs did not report any adverse effects22,23
(Table 2). These reports indicated that the adverse symp-
toms were not limited to the curcumin containing herbs and
curcumin up to about 1200 mg/day. Thus, turmeric prepa-
rations and curcumin were considered to be safe at doses not
exceeding 1200 mg/day for up to 4 months.
DISCUSSION
Although the exact biochemical cause of osteoarthritis
remains unknown, it is associated with inflammation in ar-
ticular cartilage, which can cause abnormal joint structure in
the knee and hip and it is accompanied with pain. The most
common treatments are analgesics and NSAIDs.5 However,
the drugs have serious adverse events in the gastrointestinal
tract and cardiovascular system.6 Therefore, herbal treat-
ments that can mitigate the pain and inflammation have been
investigated as potential primary or adjunct therapies for

 relieving arthritis symptoms. This systematic review and
meta-analysis provided scientific evidence that 8–12 weeks
of standardized turmeric extracts (typically 1000 mg/day of
curcumin) treatment can reduce arthritis symptoms (mainly
pain and inflammation-related symptoms) and result in
similar improvements of the symptoms as ibuprofen and
diclofenac sodium. Therefore, turmeric extracts and curcu-
min can be cautiously recommended for alleviating the
symptoms of arthritis, especially osteoarthritis. However,
the sample sizes (45–124) of the studies included in this
review were insufficient to be conclusive, and some studies
represented moderate quality. Further high-quality RCT
studies with more subjects are needed to confirm the ther-
apeutic efficacy of turmeric and curcumin for arthritis.
The article by Pinsornsak and Niempoog21 was not in-
cluded in the meta-analyses because its design did not per-
mit its data to be merged with any of the other studies. That
RCT was a comparison of diclofenac (75 mg/day) with or
without curcumin (1000 mg/day). Both groups made sig-
nificant improvements over the 3-month course of the study,
but although the group that included curcumin seemed to
improve more, there was no significant differences between
groups. Since diclofenac is an NSAID, it is possible that its
mechanisms of action are similar to those of curcumin and
the redundancy of action resulted in little additional benefit.
The authors also suggested that the lack of statistical sig-
nificance might have been influenced by the drop-out rate of
9% due to difficulty in traveling for follow up in the rural
area. They also suggested that the dose may have been too
low; however, other studies included in this review found
significant improvements at lower dosages. However, the
design of this study did not permit a determination of the
effectiveness of curcumin alone.
The study by Madhu et al.22 was unique in using a tur-
meric extract that contained only polar substances, espe-
cially polysaccharides, and no curcumin. This study had
four groups: placebo, turmeric, chondroitin sulfate, and
turmeric plus chondroitin sulfate. Turmeric and chondroitin
sulfate both provided significant benefits by both PVAS and
WOMAC score, with turmeric performing significantly
better. However, combining turmeric and chondroitin pro-
vided no added benefit, which may be due to redundant
effects as already suggested for curcumin and diclofenac.
The most important contribution of this study, however,
may be that it demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory and/or
analgesic benefits for turmeric components other than cur-
cumin.
Osteoarthritis is exacerbated by the activation of NF-jB,
which is initiated by a host of stress-related stimuli, in-
cluding proinflammatory cytokines, excessive mechanical
stress, and extracellular matrix degradation products.4,30
These actions reduce the amount of articular cartilage in
the joints and wear out the bones near the joints to induce
pain and difficulty in movements. As a result, osteoarthritis
treatment focuses on relieving pain and swelling, improving
joint mobility and stiffness, increasing the strength of the
joints, and minimizing the disabling effects of the disease.31
Thus, the severity of arthritis is mostly measured by PVAS
and WOMAC as symptomatic end-point results in RCTs.
The approved drugs commonly used to treat arthritis, such
as NSAIDs, have adverse effects, and alternative treatments
have been investigated. NSAIDs increase the risk of gas-
trointestinal bleeding, vascular adverse events, and allergic
responses.32 Symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteo-
arthritis such as glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydro-
chloride, chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, avocado
soybean unsaponifiables, and diacerein are common alter-
native medicines for treating osteoarthritis symptoms.33–36
In systematic reviews, glucosamine and diacerein were
found to reduce pain but did not alleviate joint space nar-
rowing.33,36 In addition, they also caused some gastroin-
testinal and metabolic disturbances, although the adverse
effects were less than NSAIDs.37 People with impaired
glucose tolerance or insulin resistance are more likely to
exhibit severely impaired glucose metabolism with glucos-
amine treatment for osteoarthritis.33,37 Therefore, these
drugs cannot be used for long-term treatment, although os-
teoarthritis is a chronic long-term disease. Herbal medicine

 is often recommended for osteoarthritis treatment. Herbal
and complementary therapies are safer to use and can be
taken for longer periods, but they are also subject to wide-
spread advertising and attractive, but unsubstantiated,
claims that are often made for many natural products. Pro-
mising therapeutic agents for treating osteoarthritis can be
compounds that block NF-jB signaling.38 Several candi-
dates for naturally occurring NF-jB inhibitors are phyto-
chemicals such as flavonoids and catechins from green tea,
rosehip, curcumin, and resveratrol.38,39
Turmeric (C. longa) has a long history of safe use as food
and it has long been used as in anti-inflammatory treatment
in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine.30 Turmeric
contains a yellow-pigmented fraction that mainly consists of
curcuminoids. The principal ingredient of curcuminoids is
curcumin, which is reported to have beneficial effects on
osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia due to its
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the
systemic bioavailability of curcumin is known to be poor.40
Several studies have reported that curcumin concentrations
are extremely low or nonexistent in serum and tissues at 1, 2,
3, and 4 h after taking a single oral dose of 500–8000 mg in
humans, and also after long-term oral administration of
440–2200 mg curcumin or curcuma extracts per day.41–43
This is associated with the low stability of curcumin in aqueous
solution at physiological pH, and within 30min, curcumin is
degraded into trans-6-(40-hydroxy-30-methoxyphenyl)-2,4-
dioxo-5-hexenal, ferulic aldehyde, ferulic acid, feruloyl
methane, vanillin, vanillic acid, and other dimerization end
products.44,45 The metabolites of curcumin are present in high
concentrations in the circulation after curcumin consumption.
These curcumin metabolites may be responsible for the anti-
inflammatory and antioxidant activities that reduce the
symptoms of metabolic diseases including osteoarthritis.44,45
However, Gupta et al. reported that curcumin is low but de-
tectable in the circulation as the forms of glucuronide and
sulfate conjugates in the patients with oral consumption of
8 g/day curcumin for more than 2 months.46 Thus, curcumin
itself can be a therapeutic agent for relieving arthritis.
Korea Food and Drug Safety administration has declared
turmeric roots as ‘‘generally regarded as safe.’’ Turmeric and
curcumin have been found to be safe and tolerable in human
clinical trials and systematic reviews.47 No long-term studies
with curcumin have revealed toxic or adverse effects.48
However, some clinical studies in humans with high doses
(8–12 g) of curcumin have shown a few side effects, with
some subjects reporting mild nausea or diarrhea.49 The
studies used in this systematic review and meta-analyses
used several types of turmeric and curcumin preparations
and all appeared to provide efficacy for treating arthritis.
Recently, high doses of curcumin was found to alter iron
metabolism by chelating iron and suppressing the protein
hepcidin, potentially causing iron deficiency in susceptible
patients.40 However, overall, the dosage required to improve
osteoarthritis was less than 2000 mg/day and this dosage did
not show any noticeable adverse effects in this review. Thus,
turmeric and curcumin can be safely used as a therapeutic
agent for osteoarthritis.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic
review and meta-analysis of RCTs on the effectiveness of
turmeric extract or curcumin for arthritis. Although the
present meta-analysis of RCTs suggested that oral admin-
istration of curcumin reduced arthritis symptoms, as mea-
sured by PVAS and WOMAC, as much as pain medicine, it
is difficult to recommend curcumin and turmeric as a good
therapeutic agent for arthritis due to the limitations of the
RCT studies included in this systematic review. The limi-
tations of the studies are as follows: first, the number of
RCTs (n = 8) and sample sizes (n = 45–124) of the primary
studies are low. RCTs had either a placebo control or pain
medicine control, and they also utilized different end-point
measurements such as PVAS and/or WOMAC. Thus, total
sample size of each meta-analysis was low: PVAS for cur-
cuma and placebo was 60 curcuma and 62 placebo; WO-
MAC score for curcuma and placebo was 308 curcuma and
291 placebo; PVAS for curcuma and pain medicine was 258
curcuma and 242 pain medicine. Furthermore, there were
various turmeric preparations, some designed to increase
absorption, that complicate drawing firm conclusions about
the most effective preparation method and dose. However,
this is also a strength of the study because it demonstrates
that turmeric contains multiple functional compounds and
their metabolites that have efficacy for arthritis. In addition,
the RCTs included in the systematic review had overall low-
to-moderate ROB. Four RCTs were classified as high
quality17,18,20,23 and four RCTs had a moderate quali-
ty.16,21,22,24 Some studies did not report randomization of
the subjects and allocation of the groups,17,20,24 whereas
two RCTs did not mention their blindness to the practi-
tioners.17,21 In addition, two RCTs did not report drop-out
rates and reasons for withdrawals from the trials.23,24
However, it is difficult to detect bias resulting from au-
thors not publishing negative results that are considered
uninteresting, so there is still some possibility of publica-
tion bias.
In conclusion, although the studies used in this meta-
analysis do not have sufficient number of subjects to
permit a definitive recommendation for the use of curcu-
min as a treatment for arthritis, they do provide a com-
pelling justification for its use as a dietary adjunct to
conventional therapy. Furthermore, they also provide
sufficient evidence to support larger clinical trials that
could eventually lead to its acceptance as a standard
therapy for many forms of arthritis and possibly other
inflammatory conditions.
