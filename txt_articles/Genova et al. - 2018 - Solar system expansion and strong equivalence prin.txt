The NASA MESSENGER mission explored the innermost planet of the solar system and
obtained a rich data set of range measurements for the determination of Mercury’s
ephemeris. Here we use these precise data collected over 7 years to estimate parameters
related to general relativity and the evolution of the Sun. These results confirm the validity of
the strong equivalence principle with a significantly refined uncertainty of the Nordtvedt
parameter η = (−6.6 ± 7.2) × 10−5. By assuming a metric theory of gravitation, we retrieved
the post-Newtonian parameter β = 1 + (−1.6 ± 1.8) × 10−5 and the Sun’s gravitational oblate-
ness, J2� = (2.246 ± 0.022) × 10−7. Finally, we obtain an estimate of the time variation of the
Sun gravitational parameter,
_
GM�=GM� = (−6.13 ± 1.47) × 10−14, which is consistent with
the expected solar mass loss due to the solar wind and interior processes. This measurement
allows us to constrain

ercury’s role in testing theories of gravitation has always
been crucial because the strong gravitational mass of
the Sun creates notable perturbations on its orbit. The
precession of the closest distance of Mercury to the Sun
(perihelion) first highlighted the limits of Newtonian physics and
later validated the predictions of Einstein’s theory of general
relativity (GR)1. The precession of Mercury’s perihelion is pri-
marily due to third-body perturbations from other planets
(~531.63” per Julian century2), and the relativity effect produces
an additional perihelion shift of ~42.98” per Julian century3. The
relativistic corrections to Mercury’s heliocentric acceleration can
be formulated based on the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN)
parameters β and γ, which respectively measure the nonlinearity
in superposition of gravity and space-time curvature produced by
a unit rest mass. Both parameters are zero in the Newtonian
formulation and equal to 1 in GR (Methods).
The Sun’s interior structure and dynamics also affect Mercury’s
trajectory. The solar gravitational oblateness J2� and the angular
momentum S⊙ are responsible for additional precession rates of
~0.029” per Julian century4 and ~0.002” per Julian century5,
respectively. The latter perturbation, which is known as the
gravitomagnetic Einstein–Lense–Thirring (ELT) effect, is related
to the distortion of space-time induced by the rotation of the Sun.
In practice, strong correlations between γ, β, J2�, and S⊙ limit
the combined estimation of these parameters since they all
primarily affect Mercury’s orbit through the precession of its
perihelion. For this reason, a priori assumptions are necessary to
disentangle
the
effect
of
each
parameter.
The
Nordtvedt
parameter η, related to the equivalence principle (EP), can be used
as a constraint between the PPN parameters γ and β6. The
relationship between these coefficients is:
η ¼ 4β � γ � 3
ð1Þ
if we assume spatial isotropy, which implies that the PPN para-
meters α1 and α2 are equal to 0.
The orbit of Mercury is well-suited to test the EP, which
describes the equality between gravitational and inertial masses.
The EP has been partially demonstrated by laboratory experi-
ments, to a precision of ~1 × 10−13 with recent torsion-balance
tests7. However, these precise results only concern the weak EP,
which is based on Galileo’s postulate that different objects fall
with the same acceleration in a uniform gravitational field,
independent of their composition and structure. Einstein exten-
ded this concept in his development of GR by introducing the
strong EP (SEP). The SEP states that a uniform gravitational field
is locally indistinguishable from an accelerated reference frame8.
The contribution of the SEP to the gravitational-to-inertial mass
ratio depends on the self-gravitational energy (ΩB) and the rest
energy of the body (mIc2), as follows:
mG
mI ¼ 1 þ η ΩB
mIc2
ð2Þ
where mG and mI are the gravitational and inertial masses,
respectively, ΩB is proportional to G(mG)2R−1, G is the gravita-
tional constant, c is the speed of light, and R is the radius of body
B, respectively. The Nordtvedt parameter η must be zero to
validate the SEP. To prove the SEP, the test mass used in the
experiment needs to be sufficiently large so that the self-
gravitational force is not negligible. For this reason, tests at the
scale of the solar or planetary system are suitable to prove the
SEP.
The most accurate estimations of η have been retrieved from
lunar laser ranging (LLR) over the past 40 years9–12. The latest
solution validates the SEP with an uncertainty of ση~3.0 × 10−4
(Table 1). The coupling of the gravitational attraction of the
Sun on the Earth–Moon system with the self-gravitational
force of the Earth would provide a significant perturbation in
the case of SEP violation. This effect would be measurable with
LLR mm-precision data of the Earth–Moon distance12.
An equivalent dynamical effect on Mercury’s orbit is due to the
coupling between the Sun’s self-gravitational force and the
gravitational attraction of other planets, mainly Jupiter. However,
the main effect that a SEP violation has on the ephemeris of
Mercury results from the implied redefinition of the solar system
barycenter (SSB), which is negligible in the Earth–Moon case
(Methods). A Nordtvedt parameter η of 1 × 10−5 results in
discrepancies in the Mercury–Earth relative distance of ~3 m after
2 years13. Thus, the knowledge of Mercury’s ephemeris to better
than 1 m can yield better constraints on possible SEP violations
than LLR. Furthermore, this dynamical perturbation of the
Nordtvedt parameter is less correlated with other forces and thus
separates the effects of J2� and β, given the constraint of Eq. 1.
The study of Mercury’s orbit with a long-duration data set also
gives a unique opportunity to detect the time variation of the

ging (MESSENGER) mission to investigate the interior structure
and evolution of the Sun (GM⊙, J2�, and _
M�=M�) and theory of
gravitation (β, η, and _
G=G). Our results show improved estimates
of the solar gravitational oblateness and the mass loss rate that are
consistent with helioseismology and heliophysics theoretical
studies, respectively. The accurate measurement of the time

Results
MESSENGER and Mercury-combined orbit determination.
The MESSENGER mission collected spacecraft radio tracking
data near Mercury between January 2008 and April 2015, which
are well-suited to improve the ephemeris of the planet15. These
data are range-rate (or Doppler) observables that measure the
relative velocity in the line-of-sight between the spacecraft and a
Deep Space Network (DSN) Earth station, and range observables
of the relative distance between the spacecraft and the DSN
station.
Doppler observables have been used extensively to determine
the trajectory of spacecraft for navigation and geophysical
parameter estimation, e.g., the gravitational field of Mercury16.
On the other hand, range observables bear on the knowledge of
Mercury’s orbit. Range measurements have been analyzed by the
Solar System Dynamics Group of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
(JPL), Institute of Applied Astronomy of the Russian Academy of
Science, and the Institut de mécanique céleste et de calcul des
éphémérides to determine the ephemeris of Mercury, estimating
relativistic and heliophysics perturbative forces17–20.
Parallel and independent investigations so far have been
conducted to exclusively determine either Mercury’s geophysics
or its ephemeris. The estimation of Mercury’s gravity field relied
on the assumption of planet’s orbits and GMs, including
Mercury, from JPL development ephemeris (DE). On the other
hand, the ephemeris work processed spacecraft range measure-
ments only by using a pre-converged MESSENGER trajectory.
Although
both
methods
have
successfully
been
used
for
interplanetary orbit determination, their piecemeal combination
is not the best approach in the case of Mercury. Systematic errors
in the MESSENGER orbits directly enter the range data, and are
then absorbed into Mercury’s estimated position, since the
spacecraft trajectory is not adjusted in the ephemeris solution.
Conversely, a mismodeling of Mercury’s ephemeris leads to
imperfect geophysical solutions.
We numerically integrate the spacecraft and planet orbits
simultaneously in order to provide a comprehensive solution that
includes geophysical, heliophysics, and relativity results together
with their associated covariances. Here we focus on the results
that provide new information on the interior of the Sun and on
gravitational theories.

 The accuracy of the heliophysics and relativity results largely
depends on the precision of the range data. Measurement noise is
incurred
by
the
electronics
of
the
radio
frequency
(RF)
telecommunications subsystem onboard the spacecraft that
relays spacecraft telemetry and performs as a radio science
instrument21. The MESSENGER RF subsystem operated at
X-band frequencies (7.2 GHz uplink, 8.4 GHz downlink) and its
two opposite-viewing phased-array antennas (PAAs) were used to
conduct the range data campaigns (Methods).
Figure 1 shows the level of noise of the range data collected
over the entire MESSENGER mission. Each point represents the
range data RMS (root mean square) during each full tracking
pass, which usually provides one measurement every 5 min for
several hours, as a function of the Sun–Probe–Earth (SPE) angle.
The relative position of the Sun and Earth during MESSENGER
radio observations strongly controls the tracking data quality. The
solar plasma causes phase scintillations in the RF signal,
increasing the noise of both range-rate and range measurements.
At low SPE angles (near superior solar conjunctions), the Sun is
located between Mercury and the Earth, and the mean level of
noise increases from <0.5 m for 90° < SPE < 180° to ~1.5 m for
35° < SPE < 90° (Fig. 1). MESSENGER orbits close to superior
solar conjunctions (SPE < 35°) are not included in the solution
because of plasma-induced range errors higher than 3 m. The
exclusion of these data does not degrade the phase sampling of
Mercury’s orbit over the full MESSENGER mission. Figure 2
shows a histogram of the number of the processed measurements
vs. the Mercury orbital phase. A great portion of data was
collected in proximity to Mercury’s perihelion and aphelion,
enabling precise measurements of the precession induced by solar
and relativistic effects. The rest of Mercury’s orbit was evenly
sampled, and the level of noise is sufficiently uniform for all
orbital phases.
This MESSENGER data set is used to determine at the same
time
the
solar
and
relativistic
parameters
that
provide
fundamental information on the interior structure of the Sun
(GM⊙, J2�, S⊙, and _
M�=M�) and theory of gravitation (γ, β, η,
and
_
G=G).
Multiple separate
experiments have previously
established a comprehensive survey of these fundamental physics
effects. Table 1 summarizes recent estimates of these parameters.
Helioseismology studies22,23 enabled precise measurements of S⊙
and J2�, which have been also recovered with ephemerides
analysis17–20. Planetary ephemeris investigations, furthermore,
provided the best estimates for β20,24,25 and
_
GM�=GM�20,25.
Several of these studies do not include the ELT effect, so their
estimated J2� must be scaled. A more recent determination of
Mercury’s ephemeris reported the estimation of J2� by account-
ing for ELT accelerations24. LLR provided accurate estimates of η
and _
G=G9–12, which has also been determined by astrophysical
studies26. The Cassini mission achieved the most precise
measurement of the PPN parameter γ through the analysis of
radio tracking data near superior solar conjunction27. Although
the MESSENGER data are not strongly sensitive to γ and the
Sun’s angular momentum, S⊙, this investigation provides a
unique opportunity to simultaneously improve the knowledge of
GM⊙, J2�, β, η, and G _
M�=GM�.
Heliophysics and relativity solutions. The main effect of γ on the
radio tracking data is the deflection and delay of photons by the
curvature of space time produced by the Sun, and it is best
measured at SPE angles lower than 10°. However, this geometry
yields high plasma noise so the estimation of the PPN parameter γ
with MESSENGER data is not feasible. Given the γ-effect on
Mercury’s dynamical equations cannot be separated from the
dynamical perturbation due to the PPN parameter β nor ignored,
γ was thus fixed to 1, while still considering the uncertainty
obtained by Cassini27.
The strong correlation between Mercury’s orbital perturbations
due to the Sun’s gravitational oblateness and the ELT effect also
does not allow the determination of the angular momentum of
the Sun with the MESSENGER radio tracking data. The a priori
value of S⊙ adopted in this study is 190 × 1039 kg m2 s−1. A
covariance analysis shows that the MESSENGER data sensitivity

 to the ELT effect yields σS�~40 × 1039 kg m2 s−1, which is ~30
times larger than the current best knowledge (Table 1). For this
reason, the angular momentum of the Sun is not adjusted, but the
ELT effect is of course included in the integration of both the
Mercury and MESSENGER orbits. The ELT effect was not
modeled in the JPL DE432 ephemerides18.
Our results are based on a global combined estimation of
MESSENGER- and Mercury-related orbital dynamics (Methods).
Table 2 shows the a priori and estimated values and uncertainties
of the heliophysics and relativistic parameters. The Sun’s GM and
J2 estimates are in good agreement with previous works based on
Mercury’s ephemeris analysis20,24,25. The solar gravitational
flattening is notably improved and consistent with helioseismol-
ogy results, which were based on solar internal rotation
measurements22,23. By applying Eq. 1 as constraint, we assume
a metric theory of gravitation. The Nordtvedt relation enables a
highly accurate recovery of J2� and β leading to a formal
uncertainty of the gravitational flattening refined by, at least a
factor of 3 compared to previous ephemeris studies20,24,25.
However, the correlation between J2� and β is still high (~0.9,
Supplementary Table 1) because the estimation of η is limited by
the accuracy of the range data (Methods). Four different cases
were studied to assess the effects of a priori knowledge or
constraints, if we do not assume a metric theory of gravitation or
if we assume that β−1, η, or both parameters are equal to 0. These
tests generalize our results further and are shown in Supplemen-
tary Table 2. The Nordtvedt equation significantly benefits the
estimation of β and J2�, but the η and G _
M�=GM� estimates are
always stable and near the values shown in Table 2. We note that
an unconstrained solution yields a near-unity β-J2� correlation
and values of β−1 = (−1.43 ± 1.47) × 10−4 and J2� = (2.10 ±
0.15) × 10−7. In case we do not adjust for β and η, the Sun’s
gravitational oblateness converges to (2.271 ± 0.003) × 10−7 that
is still within ~1-σ of the constrained solution.
Both constrained and unconstrained solutions are consistent
with Einstein’s theory of GR. GR predictions of β and η values are
within 1-σ, as reported in Table 2. These results enable substantial
enhancement of both β−1 and η estimates, which are ~7 and ~5
times closer to 0 than LLR solutions, respectively. The knowledge
of the PPN parameter β in this study is now comparable to the
Cassini solution of the PPN parameter, γ.
Furthermore, Table 2 reports the estimation of
_
GM�=GM�
that combines the temporal variations of both G and M�. The
retrieved negative rate is close to the theoretical computations of
the Sun’s mass loss due to interior processes and solar wind. The
fusion cycle that generates energy into the Sun relies on the
conversion of hydrogen into helium, which is responsible for a
solar mass reduction with a rate of ~−0.679 × 10−13 per year28.
On the other hand, the solar wind contribution is more uncertain.
The solar cycle significantly influences the solar mass loss rate due
to solar wind. Estimates of the mass carried away with the solar
wind showed rates between −(2–3) × 10−14M�
per year28,
whereas numerical simulations of coupled corona and solar wind
models provided rates between −(4.2–6.9) × 10−14M� per year29.
Therefore, a mean value of the total solar mass loss of
−(0.9–1.1) × 10−13M� per year would be expected, since the
MESSENGER mission operated during ~2/3 of an entire solar
cycle whose maximum occurred in proximity of the end of the
mission.
Discussion
The estimated
_
GM�=GM� represents one of the first experi-
mental observations of the solar mass loss. Previous studies have
demonstrated the feasibility of estimating this parameter by
adjusting the planetary ephemerides20,25,28. Their results, which
are consistent with our estimates, were limited by the data
availability and possible mismodeling of spacecraft orbits. Our
processing of the entire MESSENGER mission increased the
solution sensitivity to a variation of
_
GM�=GM�, which has a
quadratic dependence in time. Furthermore, our new technique,
which consists of a double-integration and a combined estimation
of both planet and spacecraft orbits, mitigates the systematic
errors related to the spacecraft position and velocity.
The discrepancy between our solution and the computed
_
M�=M� may be interpreted as an indirect measurement of the
universal constant time variation. The reconstructed _
G=G is lower
than 4.0 × 10−14 per year with an uncertainty that is mainly
limited by the knowledge of the solar interior evolution (2σ =
5.0 × 10−14 per year). This result strengthens the hypothesis that
_
G=G is close to 0, improving the estimates of LLR studies by
almost an order of magnitude.
To validate the accuracy of these results, we reintegrated the
orbit of Mercury with our adjusted values. Figure 3 shows the
required corrections to the MESSENGER range data to fit at the
noise level shown in Fig. 1. The red, blue, and green dots are the
measurement biases needed with the JPL DE430 and DE432
ephemerides, and our solution, respectively. This plot shows
major improvements compared to previous JPL ephemerides. The
DE430 Mercury trajectory is affected by 80-m amplitude errors
that were corrected in the later DE432, with remaining 5–10 m
errors. Our reintegrated ephemeris for Mercury, which is
available on the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)
Planetary Geodynamics Data Archive30, shows only 0.5–3 m
biases over the full mission.
The stability of Mercury’s orbit integration also depends on the
ephemerides of the other bodies of the solar system that are
provided by the JPL ephemerides. Therefore, we evaluated the
changes in recovery of the heliophysics and relativity parameters
when using DE430 or DE436 for planetary ephemerides and
initial state of Mercury (instead of DE432 previously) and
modeling the ephemerides of the asteroids with the JPL

The formal uncertainties are given by the covariance matrix of the least-square solution, which does not include possible mismodeling of GMs and states of the other planets, and asteroids of the solar
system. The third column reports the maximum discrepancies between solutions that we obtained by using the JPL DE430, DE432, or DE436 ephemerides to model the third-body perturbation of the
planets. The ephemerides of the asteroids are based on the JPL AST343DE43017 for the three cases

 AST343DE43017. These solutions, which are reported in the
Supplementary Table 3, show consistent results with the esti-
mated values in Table 2. The formal uncertainties do not take into
account probable errors in the planets’ GMs and trajectories, as
they rely only on the measurement accuracies and the correlation
among the adjusted parameters. The fourth column of Table 2
shows the maximum estimation differences between the three
cases, which rely on the JPL DE430, DE432, or DE436 for the
other planet trajectories. These values may be interpreted as
conservative uncertainty bounds that account for pessimistic
errors due to mismodeling of GMs and orbits of the solar system
bodies. The discrepancies between
_
GM�=GM� solutions are
slightly larger than the formal uncertainties because of variations
in Earth’s orbit, Jupiter’s GM and orbit, and SSB location between
the different JPL DEs that our methodology cannot mitigate.
Furthermore, the value of the solar gravitational constant is sig-
nificantly affected by these discrepancies leading to estimates that
are, however, still within 2- and 3-σs (Supplementary Table 3).
In conclusion, our analysis of Mercury’s ephemeris with the
MESSENGER data enhances the knowledge of the relativistic
parameter η, confirming predictions of Einstein’s theory of GR.
We provide one of the first observations of the solar system
expansion due to the solar mass loss. The negative rate of

GM�=GM� is very close to theoretical computations of the Sun’s
mass loss rate leading us to significantly constrain the universal
constant time variation. These results are mainly limited by the
uncertainty in planet and asteroid ephemerides that perturb
Mercury’s orbit. We demonstrate the potential of measuring the
planets’ relative distances over decadal timescales to provide a
better understanding of the solar system and Sun evolution. To
pursue these challenging scientific goals, future investigations
employing precision ranging from a dedicated multi-spacecraft
constellation at interplanetary scale may provide a leap in pla-
netary science, heliophysics, and theoretical physics31.
Methods
Parametrized post-Newtonian formulation. The orbital dynamics of planets,
satellites, and asteroids relies mainly on the gravitational attraction of the other
bodies that are modeled as external point masses. Nevertheless, Newton’s law of
universal gravitation needs to be modified to include Einstein’s relativistic cor-
rections by means of the PPN n-body formalism17. The acceleration of Mercury
due to the interaction with other point masses is, therefore, given by:

where ri, vi, ai, and μi are the position, velocity, and acceleration vectors with
respect to the SSB, and the gravitational parameter of the body i, respectively, c is
the speed of light, and β and γ are the PPN parameters that measure the non-
linearity in superposition of gravity and space-time curvature produced by unit rest
mass, respectively. This formulation has been applied to the orbital dynamics of
both Mercury and MESSENGER. The bodies included in these integrations are all
major bodies, including the Sun, Moon, planets, Pluto, and 343 asteroids in the
main belt between Mars and Jupiter. The positions, velocities, accelerations, and
gravitational parameters are obtained from the JPL DE432 ephemerides18 for
planets, and the JPL AST343DE430 for asteroids17. However, to test the stability of
the solution, the global estimation was repeated by using JPL DE430 and DE436
ephemerides as a priori. The results of Mercury’s ephemeris, GM⊙, J2�, β, η, and
_
GM�=GM� are within the corrected σ reported in Table 2.
Lense–Thirring precession. The dynamical orbital equations of both Mercury and
MESSENGER account for the Lense–Thirring effect due to the Sun’s grav-
itomagnetic field that leads to a secular precession of the heliocentric longitude of
the ascending node and argument of pericenter.
This precession is a prediction of GR, and, for this reason, it has been recently
renamed as ELT effect. Einstein postulated the frame-dragging in the context of the
general theory of relativity stating that non-static stationary distributions of mass-
energy affect space-time. In 1918, Josef Lense and Hans Thirring derived the first
frame-dragging effect predicting that the rotation of a massive body induces a
distortion of space-time. The ELT effect has been measured with the LAGEOS
satellites in orbit around the Earth32, and the gyroscopes of the Gravity Probe B33.
A test on ELT effects was initially proposed with the NASA mission Juno in orbit
about Jupiter34. The large angular momentum of the planet induces a significant
ELT acceleration; however, it is also highly correlated with perturbations due to
Jupiter’s orientation, which is currently not sufficiently defined35.

 The ELT effect on Mercury due to the solar gravitomagnetic field is not
negligible, and it may theoretically be used to measure the angular momentum of
the Sun. Mercury’s acceleration due to the ELT effect is:

where S� is the angular momentum of the Sun, G is the universal gravitational
constant, rM� and vM� are the heliocentric position and velocity vectors of
Mercury, respectively, and c
p� is the unit vector of the Sun’s pole direction, which
relies on the right ascension α� = 286.13° and declination δ� = 63.87° of the pole
defined in the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF)36.
The ELT effect on Mercury’s orbit is mainly in the radial direction with a
maximum acceleration of ~2 × 10−7 m s−2, assuming S� = 190 × 10−39 kg m2 s−1.
However, the perturbation induced by the ELT precession is strongly anti-
correlated with the effect due to J2�, and the recovery of S� is unachievable with
the estimation of Mercury’s ephemeris.
Strong equivalence principle. Milani et al.37 formulated, for the first time, a
redefinition of the SSB due to violations of the SEP. This effect causes a significant
indirect perturbation on Mercury’s orbit that enables an accurate measurement of η
by adjusting the planet’s ephemeris. These results provoked a scientific debate on
the consequences of SEP violations for the modeling of planetary ephemerides.
Ashby et al.38 presented an alternative approach that does not fully include the
indirect perturbation presented by Milani et al.37, limiting the contribution of η on
planet’s orbital dynamics. However, current planetary ephemerides studies are
based on the hypothesis that the gravitational and inertial masses are equal to
compute the SSB location17.
The SSB represents the origin of the ephemerides reference frame. The
assumptions to compute its position are the conservation of mass/energy and the
momentum of the solar system. The SSB is, then, approximated as follows13:
R ¼
P
j μ�

P

ð6Þ
where R is equal to 0 if the SSB is the origin of the reference frame, rj is the relative

where GMG

the magnitude of the velocity of body j. This formulation is valid only when the
SEP is not violated (η = 0). The inertial masses should be used in the computation
of the SSB, as follows, if we neglect terms of order 1/c2:
P

ð8Þ
where rj is the position vector of body j with respect to the SSB, and MI
j is the
inertial mass of body j. However, these inertial masses are unknown since the
masses of the Sun, planets, and satellites are retrieved in space by means of their
gravitational pull. A violation of the SEP may lead to an intrinsic mismodeling of
the SSB position. To account for this effect, the position of the Sun should be
redefined by:

where the sum includes planets and asteroids, Ωj and Mj are the self-gravitational
energy and the mass of body j, respectively, and the symbol ⊙ stands for the Sun.
The self-gravitational energy of the Sun, Earth, and Moon are −3.52 × 10−6,
−4.64 × 10−10, and −1.88 × 10−11, respectively39,40. The self-gravitational energy of
the other planets is computed by assuming uniform density

. We also
tested other self-gravitational energy modeling for the other planets, but the η
estimates only changed within 1-σ since the Sun’s self-gravitational energy
represents the dominant term.
The Sun’s position correction (Eq. 9) entails an indirect term in the heliocentric
acceleration of Mercury. The partial derivative of Mercury’s heliocentric
acceleration (aM) with respect to η, which enables the estimation of this parameter
by adjusting the planet ephemeris, is:

where the symbol M stands for Mercury, rkj is the position vector of the relative
distance between bodies k and j, r� is the position vector of the Sun with respect to
the SSB, and the last term is the indirect effect due to the correction of the SSB
position neglecting terms of the order 1/η2. SEP violations would provide
significant perturbations on Mercury’s orbit that enable the measurement of η to
high accuracy, and decorrelate the PPN parameters and J2� if the Nordtvedt
equation (Eq. 1) is applied as a priori constraint13. However, the correlation
between J2� and β is still ~0.9 even applying the Nordtvedt equation
(Supplementary Table 1).
This a priori constraint approach was proposed for the first time in the
simulations of the relativity experiment that will be conducted by the European
Space Agency (ESA) mission BepiColombo13. One year of operations in orbit about
Mercury will allow BepiColombo to collect 30-cm precision range data for the
determination of Mercury’s ephemeris. The results of those simulations showed
lower correlation between J2� and β (~−0.3) by using the Nordtvedt equation37.
The stronger effect of this constraint on the BepiColombo solutions is mainly due
to the more precise range data that will enable to determine a more accurate
estimate of SEP violations. The accuracy of η estimation affects directly the
correlation between J2� and β, if the constraint is applied. If we assume the
Nordtvedt equation and to know η at the same level of BepiColombo results (~10
−6), the correlation between J2� and β drops to ~0.3 that is consistent with the
simulation of the future ESA mission to Mercury41.

Ephemeris and orbit determination. The results presented in this paper were
obtained with the NASA GSFC orbit determination software GEODYN II, which
has been used to determine geophysical parameters of, for example, the Earth,
Moon, and Mars. We used GEODYN II to recover previous solutions of Mercury’s
gravity field, orientation, and tides assuming the JPL DE430 ephemeris of Mer-
cury17. To estimate Mercury’s ephemeris and the associated heliophysics and
relativity parameters, we modified GEODYN II to numerically integrate the orbits
of both MESSENGER and the planet Mercury simultaneously.
This software is based on a batch least-squares scheme that allows the
combination of all observations within one batch (arc) for the estimation of the
parameters of interest. The least-squares technique relies on an adjustment of
model parameters to minimize the discrepancies between the computed
observables and actual measurements (residuals). If the trajectory of the spacecraft
alone is integrated, the only parameters that can be estimated are related to
MESSENGER’s dynamics around Mercury (e.g., the gravity field of the planet). The
simultaneous numerical integration of the planet ephemeris allows the adjustment
of other model parameters, such as those from heliophysics and relativity that
perturb the orbit of Mercury.
The MESSENGER orbital mission (2011–2015) was partitioned in 1499 1-day
arcs. Three additional ~10-day arcs cover the three Mercury flybys in 2008–2009.
The range data were weighted according to the contribution of the solar plasma
that varied through the mission as expressed by the Sun–Earth–Probe angle. For
each arc, the Mercury’s ephemeris is continuously integrated from the Flyby 1
initial epoch (7 January 2008 at 0000 UTC). We generated partial derivatives of the
following MESSENGER-related parameters: spacecraft initial states, areas of the
spacecraft sunshield, and solar panels, Mercury’s gravity field up to degree and
order 100 in spherical harmonics, and Mercury’s Love number k2 and orientation
(pole’s right ascension and declination). We also computed partial derivatives of
the following Mercury-related parameters: planet’s initial state, GM�,
_
GM�=GM�,
J2� and S�, PPN parameters β and γ, and Nordtvedt’s parameter η.
The individual normal equations of all these arcs were combined and inverted
to yield the final estimates of the geophysical, heliophysics, and relativity
parameters. The orbit of the Earth is not integrated and adjusted in this study since
the orbital accuracy of the Earth from the JPL DE432 ephemerides is comparable to
the precision of the MESSENGER data.
MESSENGER data set. The data processed in this paper include the three MES-
SENGER flybys around Mercury, and the whole orbital mission. The three flybys
occurred on 14 January 2008, 6 October 2008, and 29 September 2009, respectively.
MESSENGER was inserted in a highly eccentric and near-polar orbit about Mer-
cury on 18 March 2011. The initial period was ~12 h and the orbital periapsis was
at ~200-km altitude and ~60°N latitude. Orbit-correction maneuvers (OCMs) were
required to maintain the periapsis between 200 and 500 km for the first year of
operations. The third-body perturbation of the Sun combined with the high

7
 eccentricity of the orbit led to a significant drift of the periapsis altitude and
latitude.
The mission was extended for a second year in March 2012. The OCMs became
less frequent, and one of them was used to reduce the orbital period to ~8 h. A
second extended mission (XM2) started in March 2013 and included a low-altitude
campaign until Mercury impact on 28 April 2015. The fuel reserves enabled the
spacecraft to maintain periapsis altitudes as low as 15–25 km for several weeks.
NASA’s DSN stations tracked the spacecraft during part of these passages from
April to October 2014 leading to accurate measurements of Mercury’s gravity at
altitudes between 25 and 100 km. In the last 6 months of the mission, the closest
approaches of MESSENGER were occulted by Mercury and were thus not visible
from the Earth. However, additional range-rate and range measurements were
collected at low altitudes between 75 and 100 km.
The data included in this study were collected over ~900 days. The greater part
of the excluded data is because of high levels of plasma noise in proximity of
superior solar conjunctions (SPE < 35°). Other arcs were also omitted because of
the presence of OCMs or reaction wheel momentum desaturation maneuvers that
imparted significant ΔVs leading to significant orbital errors.
Range-rate and range measurements. The analysis of the range data to estimate
Mercury’s ephemeris relies strongly on the accuracy of MESSENGER orbital
reconstruction. The data collected during XM2, especially, are very sensitive to the
quality of the spacecraft orbits. Uncompensated gravity anomalies of Mercury’s
gravity field may affect significantly the range residuals leading to inaccurate
ephemeris solutions. To mitigate the effects of MESSENGER orbital errors in the
determination of Mercury’s ephemeris, both range-rate and range data have been
analyzed in this study. This data set includes two-way and three-way coherent
range-rate and two-way coherent range measurements. The difference between
two- and three-way data is only related to the receiving station. The signal is
transmitted by the DSN station and sent coherently back to the same (two-way) or
a different (three-way) station by the spacecraft deep space transponder (DST). The
two-way configuration guarantees highly accurate data thanks to the H-masers at
the DSN ground stations. The three-way data require additional bias corrections
due to the time delay between the oscillators at the transmitting and receiving
stations. The biases of the three-way range-rate data are adjusted in the solution to
mitigate this error source.
The Earth-spacecraft radio link was supported by diametrically opposite-facing
PAAs for the high-gain downlink signal, and two fanbeam antennas to provide
medium-gain uplink and downlink. Four low-gain antennas were also used to
enable the instrumentation pointing towards the planet surface during tracking
periods. However, the range data campaigns were always conducted with the front
and back PPAs, as shown in Fig. 1. The gain level of the antennas influences
significantly the level of noise of the range-rate data21. A major source of error for
the range data is the internal spacecraft delay that was measured during ground
testing with an uncertainty of ~12–14 ns that leads to a range accuracy of <2 m21.
Further tests in flight enabled to reconstruct a more precise delay time, which was
necessary for science operations at Mercury. MESSENGER operated for ~11 years
in space, and its instrumentations, including the transponder, coped with the
effects of ageing. By interpolating the range data residuals, we were able to
determine a linear trend of the time delay that is probably associated with the
ageing of the spacecraft transponder. The rate of the mean time delay is ~0.45 ns
(~13.5 cm) per year, which provides a maximum offset of <1 m between January
2008 and April 2015. This effect is within the level of accuracy of the range data
(1–2 m) that was retrieved during test laboratory results21.
Another source of range data error is given by station biases due to imperfect
calibration. The accurate measurement of the ranging signal round-trip delay is
made through digital signal processors at the DSN stations by correlating the
uplink and downlink carriers that are coherently related. This calibration may lead
to biases on the measured delay with a standard deviation of 1–3 m. To mitigate
these calibration errors, range station biases for each tracking pass may be
estimated in orbit determination. However, the estimation of the range station
biases tends to absorb the uncompensated ephemeris mismodeling. For this reason,
the range station biases are not estimated in this study of Mercury’s ephemeris,
heliophysics and GR.
These biases may instead be used to determine the quality of the ephemeris
results. After convergence of the global solution, all the adjusted parameters (see
Ephemeris and Orbit Determination) are applied in a final iteration, in which the
range station biases are adjusted instead of the Mercury’s initial state, GM⊙, J2�, β,
η, and
_
GM�=GM�. Figure 3 shows the retrieved station biases that are within the
expected range of calibration errors. To compare the quality of these results, Fig. 3
shows the range biases estimated by using JPL DE430 and DE432 original settings.
Data availability. The MESSENGER radio tracking data are available from the
NASA Planetary Data System archive (http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/
messenger/rs.htm). The retrieved ephemeris of Mercury is available on the NASA
GSFC Planetary Geodynamics Data Archive30.
