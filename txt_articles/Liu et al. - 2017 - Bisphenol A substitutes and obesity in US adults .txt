Summary
Background Bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS) are increasingly used in consumer products as substitutes for 
bisphenol A (BPA), a widespread environmental endocrine disruptor and putative obesogen. However, studies on the 
effects of BPF and BPS on obesity in human beings are scarce. We examined the associations of BPA, BPF, and BPS 
exposure with obesity in US adults.
Methods We included participants aged 20 years or older, who had available data on concentrations of BPA, BPF, and 
BPS (n=1709), from a cross-sectional study, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013–14. 
Participants who were pregnant or had cancer were excluded from the analysis. Urinary BPA, BPF, and BPS 
concentrations were measured using on-line solid phase extraction coupled to high performance liquid 
chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. We used body-mass index to define general obesity and waist 
circumference to define abdominal obesity. We used logistic regression with sample weights to estimate the odds 
ratios (ORs) for obesity.
Findings 1521 participants were included in the analysis. Higher BPA, BPF, and BPS concentrations were observed in 
adults who were obese than adults who were not obese; median concentration 1·5 ng/mL (IQR 0·7–2·8) versus 
1·1 ng/mL (0·5–2·3) for BPA, 0·4 ng/mL (0·1–1·3) versus 0·3 ng/mL (0·1–0·9) for BPF, and 0·4 ng/mL (0·2–1·0) 
versus 0·3 ng/mL (0·1–0·8) for BPS. After adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors, and 
urinary creatinine concentrations, BPA, but not BPF or BPS, was significantly associated with obesity. The OR for 
general obesity was 1·78 (95% CI 1·10–2·89; p=0·04 for trend) comparing the highest with lowest quartile of BPA, 
1·02 (0·70–1·47; p=0·81 for trend) for BPF, and 1·22 (0·81–1·83; p=0·30 for trend) for BPS. The corresponding OR 
for abdominal obesity was 1·55 (1·04–2·32; p=0·02 for trend) for BPA, 1·05 (0·68–1·63; p=0·99 for trend) for BPF, 
and 1·16 (0·72–1·88; p=0·54 for trend) for BPS.
Interpretation Whereas there were significant associations of BPA exposure with general and abdominal obesity, 
concentrations of BPF or BPS were not significantly associated with obesity in US adults at current exposure levels. 
Continued biomonitoring of these bisphenols and further investigation into their health effects on human beings are 
warranted.

Introduction
Obesity is a worldwide epidemic with critical and 
multiple comorbidities.1 The rapid increase of obesity 
cannot solely be attributed to genetic background and 
changes in diet, exercise, and ageing. Accumulating 
evidence 
suggests 
that 
environmental 
chemicals, 
particularly endocrine-disrupting chemicals, might also 
have a role in the increase of obesity.2,3 Bisphenol A (BPA) 
is a synthetic chemical that has been widely used in 
consumer products, such as food packaging, dental 
sealants, and thermal receipts.4 BPA exposure from food 
and water consumption, dust inhalation, or skin contact 
is ubiquitous in human beings.5 National biomonitoring 
surveys6 showed that BPA was present in urine samples 
of 95% of US adults in 2005. As an endocrine-disrupting 
chemical, BPA has received immense attention because 
of its toxicological hazard and potential adverse health 
effects. Evidence from animal studies and human 
epidemiologic studies suggests that BPA might be a 
putative environmental obesogen.7 BPA can promote 
adipocyte differentiation and proliferation, and induce 
adipocyte hypertrophy.2
In the past two decades, there has been a rapid increase 
of BPA-free products on the market because of concerns 
about the health effects of BPA. Subsequently, 
BPA substitutes, such as bisphenol F (BPF) and 
bisphenol S (BPS), are being used in some BPA-free 
products instead.8,9 For example, BPS was found in all 
thermal receipt paper samples and 87% of bill samples 
from four countries, the USA, Japan, Korea, and 
Vietnam.9 BPF has been detected in high concentrations 
in vegetables and seafood in China.10 From 2000 to 2014, 
measured levels of BPF and BPS exposure in human 
beings increased, although their levels are lower than 
that of BPA.11 The detection frequency of BPF was 88% 
and for BPS was 74% in 2014 in US adults.11 However, the

safety of BPF and BPS is unclear, which is of concern 
because these agents are structural analogues to BPA. 
Although a growing number of in-vitro studies and in-
vivo studies suggest that BPF and BPS might have 
endocrine-disrupting effects similar to BPA, human 
studies on the health effects of BPF and BPS exposures 
are scarce.12 Therefore, we examined the associations 
of BPA, BPF, and BPS with obesity in a nationwide 
population-based study.
Methods
Study design and participants
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) is a cross-sectional, nationally representative 
survey of the US population not living in institutions, 
administered by the National Center for Health 
Statistics at the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention.13 The NHANES collects data on demo-
graphics, socioeconomic status, diet, lifestyle, and 
medical conditions, and specimens for laboratory tests. 
Data from the NHANES are publicly released in 2-year 
cycles.
For this analysis, we used data from NHANES 
2013–14, when urinary concentrations of BPF and BPS 
were first measured. 10 175 participants, including 
children and adults, were included in NHANES 2013–14 
through a multistage probability sampling design to 
represent the civilian non-institutionalised resident 
population of the USA. All participants aged 6 years 
and older from a randomly selected, one-third sample 
were 
eligible 
for 
measure 
ments 
of 
urinary 
concentrations of BPA, BPF, and BPS. The analytical 
population in the present study consisted of adults aged 
20 years and older who had available data on 
measurements of BPA, BPF, and BPS. We excluded 
pregnant women and individuals with cancer from 
analyses because pregnancy and cancer can affect 
bodyweight and alter the disposition of xenobiotics. 
The NHANES has been approved by the National 
Center for Health Statistics Ethics Review Board. 
Written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants.
Procedures
Urinary concentrations of BPA, BPF, and BPS were 
measured using on-line solid phase extraction coupled 
to high performance liquid chromatography and 
tandem mass spectrometry.13 The lower limits of 
detection (LLOD) were 0·2 µg/L for BPA, 0·2 µg/L for 
BPF, and 0·1 µg/L for BPS. For concentrations below 
the LLOD (5% of BPA measurements, 35% of BPF 
measurements, and 9% of BPS measure 
ments), 
NHANES staff assigned a value of the LLOD divided by 
the square root of two. To account for urine dilution, 
concentrations of all three target analytes were adjusted 
for urinary creatinine concentrations in all the analysis 
models in this study, as previously recommended.14
Trained health technicians assessed weight, height, 
and waist circumference according to the NHANES 
Anthropometry Procedures Manual.13 General obesity 
was classified as body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or 
higher, and abdominal obesity was defined as waist 
circum 
ference of 102 cm or higher in men and 88 cm or 
higher in women.
Information on age, sex, race or ethnicity, family 
income, education, and smoking status was collected 
using questionnaires. Race or ethnicity was categorised 
into Hispanic (including Mexican and non-Mexican 
Hispanic), non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and 
other race or ethnicity. Family income-to-poverty ratio 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for research articles and reviews published 
in English from database inception to Dec 20, 2016. We used the 
search terms “bisphenol A”, “bisphenol F”, “bisphenol S”, “BPA 
substitute”, “BPA alternative”, “obesity”, “adiposity”, “obesogen”, 
and “weight”. Findings on the association between bisphenol A 
(BPA) and obesity have been inconsistent, and a published 
systematic review highlighted the need for further investigation. 
In certain populations, BPA exposure is reducing while exposure 
of BPA substitutes, such as bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S 
(BPS), is increasing. In-vitro studies and in-vivo studies have 
shown that BPF and BPS have endocrine-disrupting effects 
similar to BPA. However, human studies on effects of BPF and 
BPS exposures on obesity are scarce.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first human study to examine 
the associations of BPF and BPS with obesity. This study was 
based on data from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey, a nationwide population-based study 
among US population. We found that, after adjustment for 
other risk factors for obesity, urinary BPA concentration was 
significantly associated with a higher risk of both general 
obesity and abdominal obesity. Current urinary 
concentrations of BPF and BPS were not significantly 
associated with obesity.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study has important clinical and public health implications. 
At the current exposure level, BPF and BPS exposure does not 
seem to contribute significantly to obesity epidemic in US adults. 
However, whether BPF and BPS pose an increased risk of obesity 
at the same population exposure levels as BPA remains unknown. 
With a rising exposure of BPF and BPS as substitutes of BPA, 
continued biomonitoring of these chemicals in populations and 
further investigations on their health effects are needed.

was categorised as 1·30 or lower, 1·31–3·50, and greater 
than 3·50.15 Self-reported education status was grouped 
as lower than high school, high school, and college or 
higher. Individuals who smoked less than 100 cigarettes 
in their lifetime were defined as never smokers; those 
who had smoked more than 100 cigarettes, but did not 
smoke at the time of survey, were considered former 
smokers; and those who had smoked 100 cigarettes in 
their lifetime and smoked cigarettes at the time of survey 
were current smokers, in accordance with the National 
Center for Health Statistics classifications.13 Participants 
were asked questions about physical activity, from which 
metabolic equivalent of task min per week were derived 
according to the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire 
Analysis Guide.16 Dietary information was collected by 
24-h dietary recall interview and total energy intake was 
calculated using the US Department of Agriculture 
Automated Multiple-Pass Method.13
Statistical analysis
The NHANES used a complex, multistage probability 
sampling design to represent a national, civilian, non-
institutionalised, US population. Therefore, weighted 
estimates were applied to account for the differential 
probability of selection, non-response adjustment, and 
adjustment to independent population controls. The 
Taylor series linearisation method was used for variance 
estimation to account for stratification and clustering, 
following the NHANES Analytic Guidelines.13
We used χ² tests to analyse categorical variables and 
analysis of variance to analyse continuous variables. We 
log-transformed concentrations of BPA, BPF, and BPS 
before analysis because their distributions were skewed. 
We used Pearson correlations with sample weights to 
compute correlation coefficients among log-transformed 
BPA, BPF, and BPS concentrations. We used logistic 
regression to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of general or 
abdominal obesity according to quartiles of urinary BPA, 
BPF, and BPS concentrations. We used linear regression 
to estimate the association of urinary concentrations of 
BPA, BPF, and BPS with BMI and waist circumference. 
We adjusted for age, sex, and urinary creatinine in 
model 1. Additionally, race or ethnicity, education, family 
income-to-poverty ratios, smoking status, physical 
activity, and total energy intake were included in model 2. 
We included BPA, BPF, and BPS concentrations in the 
same model (model 3) to mutually adjust for each other. 
Categorical covariates included a subcategory for missing 
data, if necessary. To test linear associations across 
categories of BPA, BPF, or BPS concentrations, we 
assigned the median values of log-transformed BPA, 
BPF, or BPS concentrations for each category and fitted 
the median values as continuous variables in the models.
We evaluated effect modification by sex (men, women) 
and race or ethnicity (white, non-white) by doing 
stratified analyses. We derived p values for heterogeneity 
from the multiplicative interaction term coefficient 
(exposure variable × effect modifier variable) added to the 
main effects multivariable model. 
To assess the robustness of our findings, we did 
sensitivity analyses by excluding individuals with 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) because these conditions 
might have affected bodyweight. Individuals who were 
underweight (BMI <18·5) were excluded in another 
sensitivity analysis, given that underweight might have 
resulted from unknown reasons irrelevant to the 
exposure of interest.
All statistical analyses were done in SAS software 
(version 9.4). p<0·05 was considered statistically 
significant.

Results
1709 adults aged 20 years and older were randomly selected 
for measurements of BPA, BPF, and BPS, of whom 
24 were pregnant women and 164 had cancer and were 
excluded from analyses. 1521 participants were included in 
the analysis, of whom 732 (48%) were men. Median 
urinary concentrations were 1·3 ng/mL (IQR 0·6–2·5) for 
BPA, 0·3 ng/mL (0·1–1·1) for BPF, and 0·4 ng/mL 
(0·1–0·9) for BPS. Younger individuals, men, and non-
Hispanic blacks were more likely to have high levels of 
BPA (table 1). Non-Hispanic blacks and individuals with 
lower family income and levels of education were more 
likely to have elevated levels of BPS than those with higher 
family income or education levels (table 1). No significant 
differences of population characteristics were found for 
BPF (table 1). Urinary concentrations of the three 
bisphenols were significantly correlated with each other; 
the Pearson correlation coefficients were 0·27 between 
BPA and BPF (p<0·0001), 0·33 between BPA and BPS 
(p<0·0001), and 0·20 between BPF and BPS (p<0·0001).
The weighted prevalence of general obesity was 39% 
(SE 1·8%) and 58% (1·4%) for abdominal obesity. Higher 
concentrations of BPA, BPF, and BPS were observed in 
adults with general obesity than adults who were not 
obese; median urinary concentration was 1·5 ng/mL 
(IQR 0·7–2·8) for BPA, 0·4 ng/mL (0·1–1·3) for BPF, 
and 0·4 ng/mL (0·2–1·0) for BPS in individuals with 
general obesity, and 1·1 ng/mL (0·5–2·3) for BPA, 
0·3 ng/mL (0·1–0·9) for BPF, and 0·3 ng/mL (0·1–0·8) 
for BPS in individuals with non-general obesity 
(appendix).
In multivariable analyses, urinary BPA concentrations, 
but not concentrations of BPF or BPS, were significantly 
associated with obesity (tables 2, 3). After adjustment for 
demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, lifestyle

factors, and urinary creatinine concentrations, the OR 
for general obesity comparing the highest with lowest 
quartile of each bisphenol was 1·78 (95% CI 1·10–2·89; 
p=0·04 for trend) for BPA, 1·02 (0·70–1·47; p=0·81 for 
trend) for BPF, and 1·22 (0·81–1·83; p=0·30 for trend) 
for BPS. The corresponding OR for abdominal obesity 
was 1·55 (95% CI 1·04–2·32; p=0·02 for trend) for BPA, 
1·05 (0·68–1·63; p=0·99 for trend) for BPF, and 1·16 
(0·72–1·88; p=0·54 for trend) for BPS. As expected, we 
observed similar findings in analyses on the associations

(tables 4, 5).
There was no significant interaction between sex and 
bisphenol concentration or race or ethnicity and 
bisphenol concentration in relation to obesity, although 
the associations between BPA concentration and obesity 
seemed stronger in men than women and stronger in 
white people than non-white people. The OR for general 
obesity comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of 
urinary BPA concentration was 2·10 (95% CI 1·20–3·68; 
p=0·03 for trend) in men and 1·46 (0·76–2·80; p=0·18 
for trend) in women (appendix). The OR for general 
obesity for BPA was 2·41 (1·32–4·43; p=0·01 for trend) in 
white people and 1·18 (0·77–1·82; p=0·55 for trend) in 
non-white people (appendix). The associations of BPF 
and BPS with general obesity did not differ by sex or race 
or ethnicity, and similar results were observed for 
abdominal obesity (appendix).
The associations of BPA, BPF, and BPS concentrations 
with general and abdominal obesity did not change 
appreciably in sensitivity analyses when excluding 
participants with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and 
COPD, or excluding individuals who were underweight 
(appendix).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the 
associations of BPF and BPS concentrations with obesity 
in human beings. We found that urinary concentrations 
of BPF and BPS at current exposure levels were not 
significantly associated with obesity, although there were 
significant associations of BPA exposure with general 
and abdominal obesity. These results indicate that 
current levels of environmental exposure to BPF and 
BPS do not seem to contribute significantly to the obesity 
epidemic in US adults. However, two important facts 
should be taken into account in the interpretation of the 
absence of significant associations of BPF and BPS with 
obesity in this population. First, the median urinary 
concentrations of BPF (0·3 ng/mL) and BPS (0·4 ng/mL) 
at the survey time were lower than that of BPA 
(1·3 ng/mL) in our population. Whether BPF and BPS 
pose an increased risk of obesity at the same population 
exposure levels as BPA remains unknown. Second, BPF 
and BPS have only replaced BPA in some products in the 
past two decades, whereas obesity could be a progressive

condition as a result of chronic exposure to an obesogenic 
environment over many years. It is worth noting that we 
observed a marginally significant association between 
the third quartile of BPS and BMI. A possible explanation 
for this might be that BPS plays a part in promoting 
weight gain, but people who are affected have not yet 
developed clinically significant obesity.
Evidence from laboratory studies suggests that BPF 
and BPS have obesity-promoting effects.12,17–24 Biologically, 
BPF and BPS are thought to be potential endocrine 
disruptors because they have similar chemical structures 
to BPA.12,17 Findings from in-vivo studies and in-vitro 
studies have shown that BPF and BPS have some BPA-
like oestrogenic activities, such as binding to nuclear 
oestrogen receptors and altering adiponectin pro-
duction.12,18 They also have effects on peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ signalling 
pathway, a main target of obesogens, to increase lipid 
accumulation and differentiation of preadipocytes into 
adipocytes.19–21 Additionally, BPF could affect adiponectin 
production and secretion.18 Moreover, results from a 
2016 study22 showed that BPS exposure led to differential 
expression of genes related to adipogenesis and lipid 
metabolism, and it had effects on adipose-specific 
transcriptional changes earlier than BPA. BPF and BPS 
might even have some additional disruptive effects that 
are different to BPA and need to be explored in the 
future.12 Findings from an in-vitro study23 showed that

both BPA and BPS can enhance 3T3-L1 adipocyte 
differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, and through 
direct comparison, BPS is a more potent obesogen than 
BPA. In another in-vitro study,24 similar potency to 
induce obesity was found for BPA and BPS, but they 
might induce obesity through two different metabolic 
pathways. Clearly, whether BPF and BPS are safe 
substitutes to BPA in terms of obesity risk in human 
beings needs further investigation. One cannot exclude 
the notion that BPF and BPS exposure at similar levels to 
BPA could have similar obesogenic effects.
The observed significant associations of urinary BPA 
concentration with general obesity and abdominal 
obesity in this study are consistent with several earlier 
studies.25 Several pathways might be involved in the 
mechanisms of weight gain induced by BPA and its 
derivatives.3 Known as a xenoestrogen, BPA can bind to 
oestrogen receptors to change the release of adiponectin, 
which play a part in glucose regulation and energy 
balance.26 BPA can also activate PPAR γ,27 and alter 
metabolic processes through epigenetic mechanisms, 
such as DNA methylation and histone modification.28,29

Additionally, BPA, a selective oestrogen receptor 
modulator, acts as an oestrogen agonist or antagonist in a 
tissue-specific way, which makes the exposure to BPA 
even more complex.30 Moreover, BPA’s predominant 
metabolite, BPA-glucuronide, which was previously 
believed to be inactive, can actually induce preadipocyte 
differentiation and fat accumulation as well.31 In this 
study, we observed a stronger association between BPA 
and obesity in men than women, which could be 
explained by lower urinary BPA concentrations in 
women. We also observed a stronger association in white 
people than non-white people, although white people 
have lower urinary BPA concentrations. Such racial or 
ethnic differences in the association have also been 
reported in other studies,32 but the underlying 
mechanisms remain to be understood.
This study has important clinical and public health 
implications. BPF and BPS have already been used, on  a 
large scale, as substitutes of BPA in manufacturing of 
plastics and epoxy resins. The broad applications of BPF 
and BPS result in the ubiquitous presence in our daily 
life, including in food, food packaging, personal-care 
products, paper products, drinking water, and indoor 
dust.12,33 In parallel with a gradual decrease in BPA 
concentrations in the US population, there has been 
increasing BPF and BPS concentrations reported in the 
past two decades.11 With rising exposure to BPF and BPS 
from 
common 
consumer 
products, 
a 
thorough 
investigation on health effects of BPF and BPS in human 
beings is needed.
This study has several strengths. It was based on 
nationally representative data from the population-based 
NHANES study, which can allow good generalisability of 
our findings to a broader population. Additionally, the 
rich data from the NHANES, including comprehensive 
information about demographic, socioeconomic, and 
lifestyle factors, provide the opportunity to control for 
confounding from a variety of obesity-related risk factors.
We acknowledge that there are some limitations in our 
study. First, our data were from a cross-sectional survey, 
which is incapable of establishing a temporal relation or 
drawing causal inference from the observed associations. 
However, most findings from the NHANES on health 
effects of BPA have been confirmed in subsequent cohort 
studies and meta-analyses.25 Second, spot urine samples 
were collected to measure concentrations of BPA and 
its substitutes due to the perceived challenges and 
difficulties in collecting 24-h urine samples. Although 
within-person and between-person variability in spot 
urine samples exist, findings from previous studies have 
shown that urinary concentration of BPA based on one 
spot urine can adequately reflect the average exposure of 
a population to BPA when the population is sufficiently 
large and samples are randomly collected relative to meal 
ingestion times and bladder emptying times.34 Third, the 
proportion of participants with urinary BPF concen-
trations below the LLOD is relatively high. Although this 
did not appreciably affect the categorisation of BPF 
exposure in our categorical data analysis, the association 
between BPF and obesity warrants confirmation in other 
populations exposed to higher levels of BPF than that 
recorded in this study. Fourth, the sources of BPA, BPF, 
and BPS exposure might not be entirely the same. 
However, information about sources of the exposures is 
scarce. Therefore, we could not determine their 
individual confounding patterns to date. Fifth, although 
we adjusted for many potential confounders, the 
possibility of residual confounding by other unknown 
factors cannot be ruled out. Finally, the sample size in 
this study is not well powered to detect a weak association 
(eg, BPF and obesity). Future studies with a larger sample 
size than used in this study are needed to confirm our 
findings.
In this population-based, cross-sectional study, there 
were significant associations of BPA exposure with 
general and abdominal obesity. Urinary concentrations 
of BPF or BPS at current population exposure levels were 
not significantly associated with obesity in US adults. 
However, whether BPF and BPS at the same population 
exposure levels as BPA pose an increased risk of obesity 
is not known. Additionally, BPA has only been substituted 
with BPF and BPS in the past two decades. Given the 
gradual decrease in BPA and increase in BPF and BPS 
exposure in populations, continued biomonitoring of 
these bisphenols and further investigations on their 
health effects in human beings are warranted.
