177Lu-labeled PSMA-617 is a promising new therapeutic agent for
radioligand therapy (RLT) of patients with metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Initiated by the German Society
of Nuclear Medicine, a retrospective multicenter data analysis was
started in 2015 to evaluate efficacy and safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in
a large cohort of patients. Methods: One hundred forty-five patients
(median age, 73 y; range, 43–88 y) with mCRPC were treated with
177Lu-PSMA-617 in 12 therapy centers between February 2014 and
July 2015 with 1–4 therapy cycles and an activity range of 2–8 GBq
per cycle. Toxicity was categorized by the common toxicity criteria for
adverse events (version 4.0) on the basis of serial blood tests and the
attending physician’s report. The primary endpoint for efficacy was
biochemical response as defined by a prostate-specific antigen de-
cline $ 50% from baseline to at least 2 wk after the start of RLT.
Results: A total of 248 therapy cycles were performed in 145 pa-
tients. Data for biochemical response in 99 patients as well as data
for physician-reported and laboratory-based toxicity in 145 and 121
patients, respectively, were available. The median follow-up was 16 wk
(range, 2–30 wk). Nineteen patients died during the observation
period. Grade 3–4 hematotoxicity occurred in 18 patients: 10%,
4%, and 3% of the patients experienced anemia, thrombocytopenia,
and leukopenia, respectively. Xerostomia occurred in 8%. The overall
biochemical response rate was 45% after all therapy cycles, whereas
40% of patients already responded after a single cycle. Elevated alkaline
phosphatase and the presence of visceral metastases were negative
predictors and the total number of therapy cycles positive predictors of
biochemical response. Conclusion: The present retrospective
multicenter study of 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT demonstrates favorable
safety and high efficacy exceeding those of other third-line sys-
temic therapies in mCRPC patients. Future phase II/III studies are
warranted to elucidate the survival benefit of this new therapy in
patients with mCRPC.

According to the American Cancer Society, prostate cancer is
the most common cancer and second most frequent cause of cancer-
related death in men in the United States (1). The 5-y survival rate of
locally advanced prostate cancer is nearly 100%; however, the rate
is significantly lower in the case of metastatic disease (31%) (2).
Therefore, developing new strategies for diagnosis, imaging, and
treatment of metastatic prostate cancer is of major importance.
Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in
prostate cancer and even more so with increasing de-differentiation
or castration-resistant disease (3). Radiolabeled ligands targeting
PSMA have recently been the subject of numerous studies showing
high sensitivity and contrast in detecting recurrent prostate cancer
and its metastases with remarkable detection rates (4–7). Recent
studies have also shown a high sensitivity of PSMA-targeted imag-
ing in determining the local extent of disease before radical pros-
tatectomy (8–10). The high PSMA expression in prostate cancer
metastases makes it also a promising approach to develop new
tracers for targeted radionuclide therapies.

sová et al. introduced a high-affinity PSMA ligand (PSMA-
617) that can be labeled with 68Ga or 177Lu and demonstrates supe-
rior tumor-to-background uptake (11). Since 2015, several studies
reported promising results for response rates and a favorable safety
profile after radioligand therapy (RLT) with 177Lu-PSMA-617 in
patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)
(12–16). In a single-center study of 28 patients, a slight improvement

 of survival compared with a matched group of best supportive-care
patients (historical population) was demonstrated (16). However,
each group presented insight only into a small patient cohort, with
insufficient power for the evaluation of a new therapy.
To overcome this limitation, a retrospective multicenter study
was initiated by the German Society of Nuclear Medicine in July
2015. Twelve therapy centers retrospectively collected and pooled
data on safety and efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT. This retro-
spective multicenter study aimed at analyzing the optimal dose and
number of therapy cycles and predictors of response in more detail.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Between February 2014 and the end of July 2015, 145 patients
(median age, 73 y; range, 43–88 y) with mCRPC were treated with 248
cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in 12 nuclear medicine centers throughout
Germany. All patients meeting the inclusion criteria within the study
timeline were included. There were no random or systematic exclusions.
Numbers of patients previously included in smaller cohort studies are
given in Supplemental Table 1 (supplemental materials are available at
http://jnm.snmjournals.org). Inclusion criteria for this retrospective anal-
ysis were progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer, PSMA expres-
sion of most lesions as determined by PSMA-targeted imaging, and at
least 1 cycle of 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT. In addition, patients experienced
progression under next-generation androgen-deprivation therapy (e.g.,
abiraterone, enzalutamide) or first- or second-line chemotherapy (e.g.,
docetaxel, cabazitaxel) or were not eligible for chemotherapy. All pa-
tients eligible for 223Ra received this treatment before undergoing 177Lu-
PSMA-617 RLT. The decision for 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT was made by
the local interdisciplinary tumor board at each therapy center.
RLT with 177Lu-PSMA-617 was based on a compassionate use.
Patients gave their written consent after being informed about possible
side effects and risks of this new therapeutic agent. The production
and administration of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was performed in accordance
with the German Medical Products Act AMG §13 2b. Anonymized
data were collected by the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the
Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, and the local ethics commit-
tee approved this retrospective analysis. Requirement to obtain in-
formed consent for entry into the study was waived.
Preparation and Administration of 177Lu-PSMA-617
PSMA-617 was obtained from ABX GmbH. Detailed radiosynthesis
procedures have been described in detail before (12,14–16). Quality
control parameters were monitored by experienced radiochemists and
double checked by attending physician as follows: radiochemical purity,
radiochemical identity, pH value, ethanol content, endotoxin content,
and proof of sterility.
177Lu-PSMA-617 was administered by slow intravenous injection
(1–30 min) followed by a ringer or saline solution. The cooling of
salivary glands (performed in 11/12 therapy centers) using cool packs
started 30 min before injection and was applied until 4 h after in-
jection. Further therapy cycles were performed 8–12 wk apart.
Whole-body scintigraphy and additional SPECT/CT were performed at
least 1 time 24–48 h after injection to confirm uptake and retention of 177Lu-
PSMA-617 in tumor tissue. Patients were released from the ward as per
local regulatory guidelines (,3.5 mSv/h measured at a distance of 2 m).
Safety
Blood levels for hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, creati-
nine, alkaline phosphatase, and liver parameters were obtained at each
participating therapy center shortly before RLT and every 2–4 wk
thereafter. On the basis of blood levels, toxicity was categorized using
the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). In
addition, investigators reported all (also if unlikely associated with
RLT) adverse events and serious adverse events during and after
RLT with 177Lu-PSMA-617.
Efficacy and Response
The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was determined by the partici-
pating center shortly before each RLT and at 2- to 4-wk intervals
thereafter. The primary endpoint was biochemical response determined
by a change in PSA values. According to the Prostate Cancer Work group
3 Criteria, a PSA decline $ 50% was considered as a response (17).
Statistics
SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used for analysis. Data are
presented as medians and ranges or as frequencies. Univariate and
multivariate logistic regression was applied to obtain predictors of
biochemical response. Results of logistic regression are presented as
odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. P values #
0.05 were considered significant. Parameters with a P value , 0.05 in
the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics are given in Table 1. Two hundred forty-
eight therapy cycles were performed in 145 patients (median age,
73 y; range, 43–88 y) until July 31, 2015. An average dose of 5.9 GBq
of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was administered (range, 2–8 GBq, Table 2).

 at least 1 line of chemotherapy; 64% (n 5 93) and 52% (n 5 76)
received abiraterone and enzalutamide, respectively; and 17% (n 5
24) had received 223Ra before 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT. Other previous
therapies are listed in Table 1.
During the observation period (median, 16 wk; range, 2–30 wk),
19 patients (13%) died. Of these patients, 10 patients received 1 RLT
cycle, 6 patients received 2 cycles, and 3 patients received 3 cycles.
The participating centers did not document a therapy-related death.
Safety
Data for physician-reported and laboratory-based toxicity were
available for 145 and 121 patients, respectively. Twenty-nine patients
had laboratory follow-up for less than 6 wk after the first cycle.
Adverse events after 177Lu-PSMA-617 are summarized in Table 3.
Grade 3–4 hematologic adverse events occurred in 18 of 145 patients
(12%): 1 patient experienced severe leukopenia, 11 (8%) patients
anemia, 2 (2%) patients thrombocytopenia, and 4 patients a combi-
nation of these conditions. Grade 3–4 hematotoxicity was higher in
patients with prior 223Ra (5/24, 21%). Grade 3–4 hematotoxicity was
not significantly higher in patients with prior chemotherapy (10/79,
13%) than in chemotherapy-naive patients (8/66, 12%). The average
administered dose in patients with grade 3 and 4 hematotoxicity was
5.6 GBq (range, 4–7.4 GBq, vs. 5.9 GBq in the entire cohort). Data
according to baseline Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events
status are presented in Supplemental Table 2. Despite 24 grade 3–4
adverse events, the median values in hemoglobin, red and white
blood cells, and platelets were not changed during the follow-up
period (Fig. 1). No nephrotoxicity grade 3 or 4 occurred. Mild to
moderate xerostomia was reported for 11 (8%) patients by the par-
ticipating centers. Administered dose in patients with xerostomia
was 5.5 GBq (vs. 5.9 GBq in the entire cohort). Mild to moderate
nausea was reported in 9 (6%) patients.
Efficacy
Serial PSA levels for analyzing biochemical response were
available in 99 patients (68%). Forty-six patients had PSA follow-
up of less than 8 wk after the first cycle or were not eligible for
analysis and were not considered for PSA response. Over the
entire follow-up period, 45 of 99 (45%) patients demonstrated a

(Fig. 3A). After the second therapy cycle
of 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT, a PSA decline $
50% occurred in 35 of 61 (57%) and any
PSA decline in 44 of 61 (72%) patients (Fig.
3B). Patients receiving a third or fourth cycle
of therapy showed a PSA decline $ 50% in
13 of 20 (65%) and 3 of 3 (100%) patients,
respectively.
To evaluate the probability of biochem-
ical response for different subgroups, odds
ratios were calculated (Table 4). The pres-
ence of visceral metastases (P , 0.01) and
alkaline phosphatase $ 220 U/L (P ,
0.01) were associated with a lower rate
of biochemical response. Patients with a
higher number of therapy cycles ($3)
had a higher rate of biochemical response
(P 5 0.02). All other variables including
the activity administered per cycle or cu-
mulatively did not have a relevant effect
on response rates (Table 3). In a multivariate analysis, alkaline
phosphatase, number of therapy cycles, and the presence of vis-
ceral metastases remained relevant factors (P # 0.05) associated
with the rate of biochemical response. Response as determined
by imaging was available in 47 patients (Supplemental Fig. 1).
Of these, 21 of 47 (45%) experienced partial response and 13 of
47 (28%) had stable disease by imaging follow-up.
DISCUSSION
The present study analyzed data of a retrospective multicenter
study for safety and efficacy after 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT in
mCRPC patients from 12 different therapy centers. To our knowl-
edge, this is the largest cohort analyzed in a multicenter approach
for 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT of prostate cancer. There was no therapy-
related death after 248 therapy cycles in 145 patients. Few patients
experienced serious adverse events. Overall biochemical response
rate by PSA decline $ 50% occurred in 45% and 58% of those
patients who showed a biochemical response already after a single
cycle. In the present study, any PSA decline occurred in 65% of
patients after 1 cycle of RLT with 177Lu-
PSMA-617 and in 72% after the second
cycle.
Although the patients in our study were
heavily pretreated and received 177Lu-PSMA-
617 RLT as the last therapeutic option, these
response rates are comparable and might be
superior to response in mCRPC patients un-
dergoing other systemic therapies approved
for mCRPC, for example, only 32% of patients
undergoing enzalutamide after abiraterone
therapy (18) demonstrated a PSA decline of
$50%. In another pooled multicenter cohort
of patients with mCRPC and prior abiraterone
and chemotherapy with docetaxel, enzalutamide

 therapy induced a PSA decline $ 50% in only 18% of the patients
(19). Furthermore, Noonan et al. reported a PSA decline $ 50% in
only 1 of 30 (3%) patients treated with abiraterone after progression
under enzalutamide (20). A potential reason for this cross-resistance is
the emergence of androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs) out of
which AR-V7 seems to be the most important (18). 177Lu-PSMA-617
targets PSMA and reveals its efficacy by b-radiation to the target cell
and the surrounding environment. On the basis of its different mech-
anism of action, 177Lu-PSMA-617 effectively reduced PSA in most
patients with advanced CRPC progressive under androgen-deprivation
therapy. 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT may thus represent a new treatment
option in these patients.
Prior chemotherapy did not significantly influence response
rates after 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT. Alkaline phosphatase , 220,
the absence of visceral metastases, and the number of therapy
cycles were relevant independent predictors of biochemical re-
sponse. Conversely, patients with relevant risk factors (alkaline
phosphatase $ 220, visceral metastases) should be monitored
closely to adjust therapy in case of disease progression. Several
patients underwent more than 2 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617,
underlining the potential of sustained disease control after multi-
ple cycles of RLT.
In the current study, grade 3–4 hematotoxic adverse events
occurred in 12% of the patients: thrombocytopenia and anemia
occurred in 4% and 10%, respectively (Table 4). The reported rate
of adverse events is slightly lower than or comparable to the rate
in other mCRPC cohorts. Patients undergoing placebo or 223Ra
within the ALSYMPCA trial (21) demonstrated grade $ 3 anemia
in 13%–14% and grade $ 3 thrombocytopenia in 3%–7%. The
present study shows significantly lower hematotoxicity when com-
pared with results of second-line chemotherapy or radiolabeled
antibody therapy: the TROPIC study (22) revealed a grade $ 3
leukopenia in 68% of patients receiving cabazitaxel and in 42% of
patients receiving mitoxantrone versus the 3% in our study. Application

SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF 177LU-PSMA RLT

Downloaded from 
 of 177Lu-labeled J591 monoclonal antibody was associated with grade
4 thrombocytopenia in 47% of patients (23). In the present study,
only 4% of the patients experienced a grade $ 3 thrombocytope-
nia. Favorable safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was previously reported
in smaller patient cohorts (13–16) and is now confirmed in this
large multicenter dataset.
The adverse events may be due to the advanced disease and prior
toxic therapies and in part related to the performed RLT. Mild to
moderate xerostomia can be caused by high 177Lu-PSMA-617 uptake
and resulting radiation doses . 40 Gy to the salivary glands (24).
Prior studies reported low rates of chronic xerostomia using b-emitters
such as 177Lu-PSMA-617 (13,15,16). However, the overall toxic-
ity profile was favorable. In the future, RLT with 177Lu-PSMA-617
might become an option in patients with advanced mCRPC and
multimodal prior therapies.
The major limitation of this study is its retrospective nature.
Data were collected in 12 therapy centers, which caused inho-
mogeneity of available data in terms of follow-up timeline and
concomitant medication. Data might be biased by patient
selection, loss of follow-up, and undocumented adverse events.
Therefore, all inferential statistics are intended to be exploratory
(hypotheses generating, as a limitation in all retrospective studies),
not confirmatory, and are interpreted accordingly. The primary
endpoint for efficacy was based on PSA level. In a retrospective
multicenter study, change in PSA is more objective and reli-
able than imaging follow-up, however, its clinical value remains
controversial (25).
CONCLUSION
The present multicenter study demonstrates favorable safety and
efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT in a large number of mCRPC
patients. 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT might exceed the performance of
other third-line systemic therapies reported in the literature. Future
prospective phase II/III trials are currently in preparation, to eval-
uate the potential of this new targeted radioligand therapy especially
with regards to improved patient survival.
