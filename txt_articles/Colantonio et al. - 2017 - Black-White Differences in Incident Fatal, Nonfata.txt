BACKGROUND: Blacks have higher coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality 
compared with whites. However, a previous study suggests that nonfatal 
CHD risk may be lower for black versus white men.
METHODS: We compared fatal and nonfatal CHD incidence and CHD case-
fatality among blacks and whites in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities 
study (ARIC), the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), and the Reasons 
for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS) by sex. 
Participants 45 to 64 years of age in ARIC (men=6479, women=8488) 
and REGARDS (men=5296, women=7822), and ≥65 years of age in CHS 
(men=1836, women=2790) and REGARDS (men=3381, women=4112), 
all without a history of CHD, were analyzed. Fatal and nonfatal CHD 
incidence was assessed from baseline (ARIC=1987–1989, CHS=1989–1990, 
REGARDS=2003–2007) through up to 11 years of follow-up.
RESULTS: Age-adjusted hazard ratios comparing black versus white men 45 
to 64 years of age in ARIC and REGARDS were 2.09 (95% confidence interval, 
1.42–3.06) and 2.11 (1.32–3.38), respectively, for fatal CHD, and 0.82 (0.64–
1.05) and 0.94 (0.69–1.28), respectively, for nonfatal CHD. After adjustment 
for social determinants of health and cardiovascular risk factors, hazard ratios 
in ARIC and REGARDS were 1.19 (95% confidence interval, 0.74–1.92) and 
1.09 (0.62–1.93), respectively, for fatal CHD, and 0.64 (0.47–0.86) and 0.67 
(0.48–0.95), respectively, for nonfatal CHD. Similar patterns were present 
among men ≥65 years of age in CHS and REGARDS. Among women 45 to 
64 years of age in ARIC and REGARDS, age-adjusted hazard ratios comparing 
blacks versus whites were 2.61 (95% confidence interval, 1.57–4.34) and 1.79 
(1.06–3.03), respectively, for fatal CHD, and 1.47 (1.13–1.91) and 1.29 (0.91–
1.83), respectively, for nonfatal CHD. After multivariable adjustment, hazard 
ratios in ARIC and REGARDS were 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.36–1.24) 
and 1.00 (0.54–1.85), respectively, for fatal CHD, and 0.70 (0.51–0.97) and 
0.70 (0.46–1.06), respectively, for nonfatal CHD. Racial differences in CHD 
incidence were attenuated among older women. CHD case fatality was higher 
among black versus white men and women, and the difference remained 
similar after multivariable adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS: After accounting for social determinants of health and risk 
factors, black men and women have similar risk for fatal CHD compared with 
white men and women, respectively. However, the risk for nonfatal CHD is 
consistently lower for black versus white men and women.

lacks have higher coronary heart disease (CHD) 
mortality compared with whites.1–4 However, 
black-white differences in CHD incidence have 
been less well investigated. A prior analysis of partici-
pants ≥45 years of age from the nationwide Reasons 
for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study 
(REGARDS) showed that black men have twice the risk 
for incident fatal CHD compared with white men but 
lower nonfatal CHD incidence.5 In contrast, incidence 
rates for fatal and nonfatal CHD were consistently high-
er among black versus white women.
The origin of the lower incidence of nonfatal CHD 
among black versus white men is unclear. The prior 
analysis of the REGARDS cohort only provided ≤7 years 
of follow-up.5 Also, the REGARDS study uses partici-
pant self-report without active surveillance to identify 
nonfatal CHD events, which may result in some events 
not being detected.
We compared the incidence of fatal, nonfatal, and 
total CHD and CHD case fatality among black ver-
sus white men and women in REGARDS with ≤11 
years of follow-up. The extended follow-up provided 
a larger number of events to investigate racial differ-
ences in CHD incidence and case fatality by sex. We 
also conducted similar analyses in the Atherosclerosis 
Risk in Communities study (ARIC) and the Cardio-
vascular Health Study (CHS). ARIC and CHS included 
active surveillance and serial electrocardiograms to 
detect CHD events that might be missed through 
participant self-report. We also repeated analyses 
in REGARDS using Medicare claims (ie, administra-
tive data collected for reimbursement) to identify 
CHD events that were not detected through study 
procedures. Analyses in ARIC and CHS, and using 
Medicare claims in REGARDS, present little threat for 
spurious findings because of differential reporting of 
events by race.
METHODS
Study Populations
The ARIC study enrolled 15 
792 black and nonblack partici-
pants 45 to 64 years of age in 1987 to 1989 from Forsyth 
County, NC, Jackson, MS, suburbs of Minneapolis, MN, and 
Washington County, MD.6 CHS enrolled 5201 participants ≥65 
years of age in 1989 to 1990 from the Health Care Financing 
Administration’s Medicare eligibility list in Forsyth County, 
NC, Sacramento County, CA, Washington County, MD, and 
Pittsburgh, PA.7,8 An additional group of 687 blacks were 
enrolled in 1992 to 1993 from counties in North Carolina, 
California, and Pennsylvania.9 The REGARDS study enrolled 
30 
239 blacks and whites ≥45 years of age from all 48 contig-
uous US states and the District of Columbia in 2003–2007.10 
Data from the REGARDS study participants were linked with 
Medicare claims using Social Security number with linkages 
confirmed by birthdate and sex.11
We used ARIC and CHS publicly available datasets, 
which exclude 60 and 93 participants, respectively, who did 
not allow their data to be released.12 The REGARDS data-
set excludes 56 participants because of anomalies in their 
informed consent. We further excluded 39 CHS participants 
who were nonblack/nonwhite. As reported elsewhere, few 
ARIC participants (<1%) were from a race/ethnicity other 
than black or white.13 Whites and nonblack/nonwhite partici-
pants are defined as nonblack in the ARIC publicly available 
dataset, preventing their identification. For the current analy-
sis, all nonblack participants in ARIC were included as whites. 
REGARDS study participants ≥65 years without Medicare Part 
A (hospitalization insurance) fee-for-service coverage at base-
line were excluded. Medicare provides insurance coverage for 
US adults ≥65 years of age or with a disability or end-stage 
renal disease. Therefore, we did not require Medicare cover-
age for REGARDS participants <65 years of age because this 
represents a select population. Last, we excluded ARIC, CHS, 
and REGARDS participants with a baseline history of CHD, 
as defined below, and those without follow-up for incident 
CHD. After these criteria were applied, 14 
967 ARIC partici-
pants, 13 
118 REGARDS participants 45 to 64 years of age, 
4626 CHS participants, and 7493 REGARDS participants ≥65 
years of age were included in the analyses (Figures I and II in 
the online-only Data Supplement).
ARIC and CHS analyses were approved by the Institutional 
Review Board at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.14 
The REGARDS study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Boards governing research in human subjects at the partici-
pating centers, and all participants provided written informed 
consent.10
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• The incidence of nonfatal coronary heart disease 
(CHD) is consistently lower among black versus 
white men, although the former have a higher bur-
den of unfavorable social determinants of health 
and cardiovascular risk factors and higher fatal 
CHD incidence.
• After adjustment for social determinants of health 
and cardiovascular risk factors, black men and 
women have a similar risk for fatal CHD but lower 
risk for nonfatal CHD compared with white men 
and women, respectively.
• Blacks with incident CHD have a higher case fatality 
compared with whites, and the difference remains 
similar after adjustment for social determinants of 
health and cardiovascular risk factors.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• The mechanisms leading to the apparent lower risk 
for nonfatal CHD among black versus white men 
and women need to be further elucidated.
• Blacks have a higher risk for their initial CHD event 
being fatal compared with whites, highlighting 
the need for reinforcing primary prevention in this 
population.

Baseline Assessment
Methods for baseline assessment in ARIC,6 CHS,15,16 and 
REGARDS10,17 have been described elsewhere. In brief, an in-
home interview and an in-clinic examination were conducted 
at baseline in ARIC and CHS. In REGARDS, a telephone 
interview and an in-home examination were conducted. 
Self-reported information collected in each study interview 
included age, race, sex, education, annual household income, 
alcohol consumption, physical activity, current smoking, his-
tory of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation (except in ARIC), 
CHD and stroke, medication use including antihypertensive 
medication, and health insurance. We defined having no 
alcohol consumption in ARIC, CHS, and REGARDS as report-
ing 0 drinks per week, moderate alcohol consumption as >0 
to 7 drinks per week for women and >0 to 14 drinks per week 
for men, and heavy alcohol consumption as >7 drinks per 
week for women and >14 drinks per week for men. In ARIC, 
low physical activity was defined by self-reporting not engag-
ing in any exercise or sport. In CHS, participants were asked 
whether they participated in any of 15 leisure-time activities 
over the past 2 weeks and about their usual pace of walking 
when outside the home.16 For this analysis, CHS participants 
were defined as having low physical activity if they reported 
not participating in any of the leisure-time activities and walk-
ing for exercise at a casual or strolling pace (<2 mph or <3.2 
kmph). Low physical activity in REGARDS was defined by self-
reporting not engaging in any weekly activity intense enough 
to work up a sweat. In ARIC, current smoking was defined 
as having smoked >400 cigarettes in lifetime and currently 
smoking cigarettes. In CHS, current smoking was defined 
as having smoked >100 cigarettes in lifetime and having 
smoked in the past 30 days.18 In REGARDS, current smoking 
was defined as having smoked >100 cigarettes in lifetime and 
currently smoking cigarettes, even occasionally.
During examinations, health professionals measured par-
ticipants’ waist circumference, performed blood pressure 
measurements that were averaged, obtained blood samples 
and an electrocardiogram (ECG), and conducted a medica-
tion inventory. History of CHD was defined by a self-report of 
a prior myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass or 
coronary angioplasty during the study interview, or evidence 
of a previous MI on the study ECG. History of CHD in CHS also 
included a self-reported history of angina and was confirmed 
by medical records and medication review.15,19 Total and high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, and creatinine were 
measured using blood samples. We defined diabetes mellitus 
by a fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, a nonfasting glucose ≥200 
mg/dL, or self-report of a prior diagnosis with current antidia-
betes mellitus medication use.20 Creatinine in ARIC and CHS 
was calibrated as described elsewhere.21 Estimated glomer-
ular filtration rate was calculated using the Chronic Kidney 
Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on creat-
inine,22 with estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min-
ute/1.73 m2 defined as reduced. Left ventricular hypertrophy 
(LVH) was defined using the study ECG and the Cornell defini-
tion in ARIC and CHS. In REGARDS, LVH was defined using 
the Cornell definition for participants with a 12-lead ECG 
and a modified Cornell definition for ≈30% of participants 
with a 7-lead ECG.17 Atrial fibrillation was defined using the 
study ECG or self-report in CHS and REGARDS. As described 
elsewhere, few ARIC participants (n=37) had atrial fibrillation 
on their baseline study ECG.23 These data were not included 
in the ARIC publicly available dataset and were not analyzed.
Follow-Up Assessment
Participants or their proxies were contacted once a year in 
ARIC and twice a year in CHS and REGARDS to identify CHD-
related hospitalizations and to confirm vital status.5,6,8 CHD-
related hospitalizations and deaths were also detected by 
active surveillance through field center investigations in ARIC 
and CHS.6,24–26 The National Death Index and online sources 
(eg, Social Security Death Index) were used for death detec-
tion in REGARDS.5 CHD-related hospitalizations and cause 
of death were adjudicated by experts in ARIC, CHS, and 
REGARDS following similar approaches.5,6,25
For the main analysis, the primary definition of fatal CHD 
includes a definite or probable fatal MI (ie, expert-adjudicated 
definite or probable MI followed by death within 28 days) or 
CHD death (ie, death from MI not meeting the criteria for def-
inite, probable, or sudden death preceded by cardiac symp-
toms or signs without evidence of noncoronary causes [eg, 
stroke]).27 The primary definition of nonfatal CHD includes a 
definite or probable nonfatal MI. Among REGARDS partici-
pants ≥65 years of age, a secondary definition of fatal and 
nonfatal CHD was also used, including CHD events by the 
primary definition, or a Medicare claim for an overnight hos-
pitalization with an International Classification of Disease, 
Ninth revision diagnosis code of 410.XX, except 410.X2, in 
any position.26 Events detected through Medicare claims were 
classified as fatal if participants died ≤28 days after admission.
Some participants have MIs with no or mild symptoms, 
which may not be clinically recognized and therefore may 
not be detected through study procedures (ie, unrecognized 
MIs). Unrecognized MIs are associated with coronary artery 
disease and a higher risk for future cardiac events and mor-
tality.28,29 Follow-up ECGs to detect unrecognized MIs were 
obtained in 1990 to 1992, 1993 to 1995, and 1996 to 1998 
in ARIC and annually through 1999 in CHS. For secondary 
analyses in ARIC and CHS, we defined nonfatal CHD as a defi-
nite or probable nonfatal MI or an unrecognized MI detected 
through follow-up ECGs.
For secondary analyses in REGARDS, fatal CHD events 
were classified as out of hospital if the death occurred before 
hospital admission (eg, in the emergency department) or as 
postadmission if the death occurred during or after hospital-
ization. Information on whether CHD deaths occurred before 
or after hospital admission was not available in the publicly 
available ARIC and CHS datasets. Follow-up data in ARIC, 
CHS, and REGARDS were available through December 31, 
2001, June 30, 2010, and December 31, 2013, respectively.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses described below were conducted stratified by sex 
and among ARIC participants, REGARDS participants 45 to 
64 years of age, CHS participants, and REGARDS participants 
≥65 years of age, separately. We calculated baseline charac-
teristics by race. Also, we conducted time-to-event analyses 
to compare the incidence of fatal, nonfatal, and total (ie, fatal 
and nonfatal) CHD among blacks and whites. Restricted to

participants with incident CHD, we also compared the risk 
for having their incident event classified as fatal (ie, case 
fatality) among blacks and whites. Secondary analyses were 
conducted using different analytic approaches and includ-
ing supplementary CHD outcomes (eg, unrecognized MIs) 
to assess the robustness of the main results. Further details 
about statistical analyses are provided below.
For the main analysis, participants were followed through 
the first CHD event by the primary definition (and second-
ary definition among REGARDS participants ≥65 years of age) 
or non-CHD death. Participants lost to follow-up without a 
CHD event were censored on the last day known to be alive. 
The maximum follow-up available in REGARDS was 11 years. 
Therefore, we censored ARIC and CHS participants who 
remained alive and free of CHD after 11 years of follow-up to 
obtain comparable estimates across studies.
In time-to-event analyses, we calculated the incidence rate 
for fatal, nonfatal, and total CHD and non-CHD mortality by 
race. We also calculated the cumulative incidence function 
for fatal, nonfatal, and total CHD by race considering com-
peting risk as described by Fine and Gray.30 Fatal CHD analy-
ses included competing risk for nonfatal CHD and non-CHD 
death (ie, death because of cardiovascular causes other than 
CHD or noncardiovascular causes). Analyses of nonfatal CHD 
included competing risk for fatal CHD and non-CHD death. 
Total CHD analyses included competing risk for non-CHD 
death. Using competing risk regression, we estimated hazard 
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for fatal, non-
fatal, and total CHD among blacks versus whites. Regression 
models included progressive adjustment for age, education, 
annual household income, region of residence (in REGARDS), 
alcohol consumption, physical activity, waist circumference, 
smoking, diabetes mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration 
rate, history of stroke, systolic blood pressure, antihyperten-
sive medication, total and high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol, lipid-lowering medication use, and health insurance. 
LVH is associated with a higher risk for arrhythmias, including 
atrial fibrillation,31–34 which can be potentiated by ischemia.35 
LVH is more common among blacks compared with whites36,37 
and could contribute to the racial differences in fatal CHD.38 
Therefore, a final model included adjustment for covariates 
listed above plus LVH and atrial fibrillation.
Restricted to participants with incident CHD, we calcu-
lated the case fatality by race. Case fatality was calculated as 
the number of participants with incident fatal CHD divided by 
the total number of participants with incident CHD (fatal or 
nonfatal). We used Poisson regression with robust variance 
estimates and progressive adjustment for covariates described 
above to calculate the case-fatality ratio and 95% CIs com-
paring blacks versus whites.39 We compared HRs for incident 
fatal, nonfatal, and total CHD and case-fatality ratios associ-
ated with black race among men and women by including 
interaction terms between sex and race in regression models.
We conducted secondary analyses in ARIC, CHS, and 
REGARDS to explore whether results would remain similar 
after removing competing risk. Specifically, we used Cox 
regression to estimate HRs for incident fatal, nonfatal, and 
total CHD censoring participants on the date of a compet-
ing event. We also conducted secondary analyses in ARIC 
and CHS to estimate HRs for incident CHD accounting for 
competing risks and case-fatality ratios using all available 
follow-up and separately, including unrecognized MIs in 
the definition of nonfatal CHD. In REGARDS, we conducted 
secondary analyses to estimate HRs for out-of-hospital and 
postadmission fatal CHD. Analyses were conducted using 
competing risk regression to account for postadmission and 
out-of-hospital fatal CHD as appropriate and nonfatal CHD 
and non-CHD death.
We used multiple imputation by chained equations to 
impute missing covariates (Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement).40,41 All analyses were performed in Stata 13 
(Stata Corp) using a 2-sided level of significance α<0.05.
RESULTS
Table 1 and Table II in the online-only Data Supplement 
show participant characteristics with and without mul-
tiple imputations, respectively. Within each study, black 
men and women were more likely to have less than a 
high school education, <$25 
000 annual income, low 
physical activity, diabetes mellitus, reduced estimated 
glomerular filtration rate, history of stroke, and higher 
systolic blood pressure levels compared with white men 
and women, respectively. The prevalence of current 
smoking and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels 
were higher for blacks versus whites among men but 
similar among women. Waist circumference was high-
er for blacks versus whites among women but similar 
among men.
CHD Incidence and Case Fatality Among 
Men
Among men 45 to 64 years of age in ARIC and RE-
GARDS, blacks had a higher incidence of fatal CHD 
and a lower incidence of nonfatal CHD compared with 
whites (Figure 1 and Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement, Left). Incidence of total CHD was higher 
for black versus white men in REGARDS but similar in 
ARIC. Non-CHD mortality was higher for black versus 
white men in both studies. Among men ≥65 years of 
age in CHS and REGARDS, blacks had a higher inci-
dence of fatal CHD, a lower incidence of nonfatal CHD, 
and a similar incidence of total CHD compared with 
whites (Figure III and Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement, Right). Non-CHD mortality was higher for 
black versus white men ≥65 years of age in CHS and 
REGARDS.
After age adjustment, black men had  higher risk 
for fatal CHD compared with white men in all analy-
ses (Table 2), although the association was numerically 
lower and not statistically significant in CHS (HR, 1.32; 
95% CI, 0.86–2.03). Black men also had a similar or 
lower age-adjusted risk for nonfatal CHD and a similar 
age-adjusted risk for total CHD compared with white 
men. After multivariable adjustment, black men had a 
similar risk for fatal CHD compared with white men in

all analyses but a lower risk for nonfatal CHD (which 
was not statistically significant in CHS; HR, 0.83; 95% 
CI, 0.57–1.21). A trend appeared for a lower risk for 
total CHD among black versus white men after multi-
variable adjustment, which was statistically significant 
in ARIC (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57–0.95).
Among men with incident CHD, blacks had high-
er age-adjusted case fatality compared with whites 
(Table 3), although the difference was not statistically 
significant in CHS (case-fatality ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 
0.93–1.74). The case-fatality ratio for blacks versus 
whites remained higher and statistically significant after 
multivariable adjustment in ARIC and among REGARDS 
participants 45 to 64 and ≥65 years of age. In CHS, 
the multivariable-adjusted case-fatality ratio was 1.03 
(95% CI, 0.73–1.45).
CHD Incidence and Case Fatality Among 
Women
Among women 45 to 64 years of age, blacks had a 
higher incidence of fatal, nonfatal, and total CHD and 
higher non-CHD mortality compared with whites (Fig-
ure 2 and Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement, 
Left). A similar pattern was present among black and 
white women ≥65 years of age in CHS and REGARDS 
(Figure IV and Table IV in the online-only Data Supple-
ment, Right).
After age adjustment, black women 45 to 64 years 
of age in ARIC and REGARDS had a higher risk for fatal 
and total CHD compared with white women (Table 4, 
Left). Black women also had a higher age-adjusted risk 
for nonfatal CHD compared with white women, which 
was not statistically significant in REGARDS (HR, 1.29; 
95% CI, 0.91–1.83). After multivariable adjustment, 
HRs (95% CI) comparing black versus white women in 
ARIC and REGARDS were 0.67 (0.36–1.24) and 1.00 
(0.54–1.85), respectively, for fatal CHD, 0.70 (0.51–
0.97) and 0.70 (0.46–1.06), respectively, for nonfatal 
CHD, and 0.69 (0.51–0.92) and 0.78 (0.55–1.09), re-
spectively, for total CHD. Age-adjusted HRs for fatal, 
nonfatal, and total CHD comparing black versus white 
women ≥65 years of age were not statistically signifi-
cant, except for fatal CHD in REGARDS (Table 4, Right). 
Specifically, the age-adjusted HR for fatal CHD among 
black versus white women ≥65 years of age in RE-
GARDS was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.01–2.43) when using the 
primary definition of CHD. HRs for fatal, nonfatal, and 
total CHD comparing black versus white women ≥65 
years of age in CHS and REGARDS were not statistically 
significant after multivariable adjustment.
Among women with incident CHD in ARIC, blacks 
had higher age-adjusted case fatality compared with 
whites (case-fatality ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.00–2.46; 
Table 5), which was attenuated after multivariable ad-
justment (case-fatality ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.65–1.82).

Crude case fatality was higher among black versus 
white women 45 to 64 and ≥65 years of age in RE-
GARDS. Case-fatality ratios in REGARDS remained nu-
merically similar but were not statistically significant 
after progressive adjustment for social determinants of 
health and cardiovascular risk factors. No racial differ-
ences in case fatality were present in CHS.
Black-White Disparities in CHD Incidence 
and Case Fatality by Sex
Within each cohort, age- and multivariable-adjusted 
HRs for fatal CHD associated with black race were simi-
lar among men and women (Figure V in the online-only 
Data Supplement, Top). Age-adjusted HRs for nonfatal 
and total CHD associated with black race tended to be

lower for men compared with women within each co-
hort, but sex differences disappeared after multivariable 
adjustment. Case-fatality ratios associated with black 
race were consistent among men and women with in-
cident CHD within each cohort (Figure V in the online-
only Data Supplement, Bottom).
Secondary Analyses
Black-white differences in CHD incidence among men 
and women were consistent with the main results in 
secondary analyses removing competing risk (Tables V 
and VI in the online-only Data Supplement). Results in 
ARIC and CHS were also consistent with the main anal-
ysis when using all available follow-up (Tables VII and 
VIII in the online-only Data Supplement) and including 
unrecognized MIs (Tables IX and X in the online-only 
Data Supplement). In REGARDS, out-of-hospital and 
postadmission fatal CHD incidence were consistently 
higher among black versus white men, and differences 
were attenuated after multivariable adjustment (Table 
XI in the online-only Data Supplement). Incidence of 
out-of-hospital fatal CHD was higher among black ver-
sus white women 45 to 64 years of age in REGARDS, 
whereas incidence of postadmission fatal CHD was 
higher for black versus white women ≥65 years of age

Analyses were conducted using competing risk regression and multiple imputations for missing data. The maximum follow-up 
for all analyses was 11 y. Mean follow-up was 10.2 y in ARIC, 7.3 y among participants 45–64 y of age in REGARDS, 8.3 y in CHS, 
and 7.1 y among participants ≥65 y of age in REGARDS when using the primary and secondary definitions of CHD. Model 1 adjusts 
for age. Model 2 adjusts for age, education, and income levels (and region of residence in REGARDS). Model 3 adjusts for covariates 
in Model 2 plus alcohol consumption, physical activity, waist circumference, and current smoking. Model 4 adjusts for covariates 
in Model 3 plus diabetes mellitus, reduced eGFR, stroke, SBP
, use of antihypertensive medications, total and HDL cholesterol, and 
use of lipid-lowering medication. Model 5 adjusts for covariates in Model 4 plus health insurance among participants <65 y of age 
(all participants ≥65 y of age had Medicare). Model 6 adjusts for covariates in Model 5 plus left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial 
fibrillation (except in ARIC). ARIC indicates Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; CHD, coronary heart disease; CHS, Cardiovascular

(Table XII in the online-only Data Supplement). Differ-
ences in out-of-hospital and postadmission fatal CHD 
among black versus white women 45 to 64 and ≥65 
years of age in REGARDS were not statistically signifi-
cant after multivariable adjustment. Black-white differ-
ences in case fatality among men and women in ARIC 
and CHS were consistent with the main analysis when 
using all available follow-up (Tables XIII and XIV in the 
online-only Data Supplement) and including unrecog-
nized MIs (Tables XV and XVI in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
DISCUSSION
We compared the incidence of fatal, nonfatal, and 
total CHD among black and white men and women 
in 3 US cohorts. After age adjustment, black men 
had a higher risk for fatal CHD but a similar or low-
er risk for nonfatal and total CHD compared with 
white men. In contrast, black women had a higher 
risk for fatal, nonfatal, and total CHD versus white 
women, particularly among those <65 years of 
age. After multivariable adjustment, including so-
cial determinants of health and cardiovascular risk 
factors, black men and women had a similar risk 
for fatal CHD, with a lower risk for nonfatal and 
total CHD compared with white men and women, 
respectively. Results from the current analysis also 
suggest that among men and women with incident 
CHD, blacks have a higher case fatality compared 
with whites, which is not completely explained by 
social determinants of health and cardiovascular 
risk factors.
The similar or lower risk for nonfatal and total CHD 
comparing black versus white men after age adjust-
ment appears inconsistent with the higher burden of 
unfavorable social determinants of health and cardio-
vascular risk factors among the former. Also, this find-
ing appears inconsistent with the higher age-adjusted 
risk for fatal CHD among black versus white men and 
for fatal, nonfatal, and total CHD among black versus 
white women. Initially, we considered that the current 
results could have been attributed to black men being 
more likely to have undetected nonfatal MIs compared 
with white men. In REGARDS, nonfatal MIs may not 
be detected if CHD-related hospitalizations are not re-
ported by participants. We previously showed that, like 
other large cohorts, the REGARDS study did not detect 
≤25% of nonadjudicated events present in Medicare 
claims.42,43 However, results among REGARDS partici-
pants ≥65 years of age were similar after including unre-
ported events detected through Medicare claims. Also, 
a similar pattern was found in ARIC and CHS, which 
include an active surveillance component for the de-
tection of unreported events. Nonfatal MIs could have 
also been undetected if these events were not clinically 
recognized. Black men have been reported to be less 
engaged in health care than women or white men, es-
pecially at younger ages.44–46 Also, in a prior analysis 
in ARIC, the incidence of clinically unrecognized MIs 
from baseline through visit 4 (1996–1998) was higher 
among black versus white men, although the differ-
ence was not statistically significant.47 In the current

analysis, results in ARIC and CHS remained similar after 
including clinically unrecognized MIs. Taken together, 
results from the current study suggest that the similar 
or lower risk for nonfatal and total CHD comparing 
black versus white men after age adjustment is unlikely 
to be explained by racial differences in the occurrence 
of undetected nonfatal MIs.
After multivariable adjustment, black men and 
women had a lower risk for nonfatal and total CHD 
compared with white men and women, respectively. 
Mechanisms leading to this finding warrant further in-
vestigation. It is notable that multivariable-adjusted HRs 
for nonfatal and total CHD associated with black race 
were numerically similar comparing men and women.

This finding suggests that differences in age-adjusted 
HRs for nonfatal and total CHD between men and 
women could be attributed to different confounding 
effects by social determinants of health and cardiovas-
cular risk factors by sex.
Consistent with prior studies, we found a higher 
case fatality among black versus white men with in-
cident CHD, which was statistically significant in ARIC 
but not in CHS.48,49 We also found a higher case fatality 
among black versus white men 45 to 64 and ≥65 years 
of age in REGARDS. We hypothesized that LVH could 
have been associated with a higher case fatality among 
blacks versus whites through a higher risk for fatal ar-
rhythmias. However, case-fatality ratios in ARIC and RE-
GARDS remained statistically significant after multivari-
able adjustment, including LVH and atrial fibrillation (in 
REGARDS). Case-fatality ratios comparing black versus 
white women were consistent with results among men. 
In secondary analyses in REGARDS, blacks had a higher 
incidence of out-of-hospital fatal CHD compared with 
whites, which is consistent with the higher risk for sud-
den cardiac death among the former.50 We also found 
a higher incidence of postadmission fatal CHD among 
blacks versus whites in REGARDS. Prior studies have 
shown that blacks are less likely to receive short-term 
antiplatelet therapies, reperfusion therapy within 24 
hours, and diagnostic cardiac catheterization and re-
vascularization after an MI hospitalization compared

with whites.51,52 Although some hospital-based studies 
suggest that short-term mortality after an MI admission 
may be lower for blacks versus whites,51–53 this situation 
seems to have changed over time.54,55 In the National 
Registry of Myocardial Infarction, in-hospital mortality 
was lower comparing blacks versus whites in 1994 to 
1999 but higher in 2003 to 2006.54 Future studies are 
needed to further elucidate the mechanisms leading 
to the higher case fatality among blacks versus whites 
with incident CHD, including both out-of-hospital and 
postadmission mortality, and to identify potential tar-
gets for interventions to reduce racial disparities.
The numerically lower HR for fatal CHD associated 
with black race in CHS versus ARIC and REGARDS 
needs to be considered in the context of epidemio-
logical changes occurred since the 1960s in the United 
States. Studies using mortality data from the 1960s 
and 1970s reported a “black-white mortality age cross-
over” for CHD.56–58 This phenomenon, which consisted 
of CHD mortality being higher for blacks versus whites 
at younger ages but lower in older populations was at-
tributed to a survivor bias.56–58 CHD mortality persisted 
higher for blacks versus whites at younger ages in more 
contemporary analyses.56 However, CHD mortality 
among older US adults has declined more for whites 
versus blacks since the 1970s.56 This resulted in CHD 
mortality being similar among older blacks and whites 
by the 1980s, just before ARIC and CHS started.56 In the 
current study, age-adjusted HRs for fatal CHD among 
blacks versus whites ≥65 years of age were numerically 
higher in REGARDS versus CHS. This finding suggests 
that black-white disparities in fatal CHD incidence may 
be becoming wider among older US adults. Continued 
surveillance of CHD incidence and mortality among US 
adults by race, age, and sex is warranted. In addition, 
targeted interventions may need to be integrated into 
population health management strategies if disparities 
are to be eliminated or, at a minimum, if an inadvertent 
widening of disparities is to be prevented.
Our analysis has several strengths, including the use 
of data from cohorts with a large sample size, adequate 
representation of blacks and whites, long-term follow-
up, and a rigorous CHD event adjudication process. 
We used a comparable follow-up and CHD definition 
and the same analytic approach accounting for missing 
data and competing risks across studies. When pos-
sible, we re-created variables in ARIC and CHS to be 
consistent with the REGARDS definition. Our study also 
has potential and known limitations. ARIC, CHS, and 
REGARDS used different methods for data collection, 
and not all the variables could be reconciled. Also, few 
nonblack/nonwhite participants in ARIC were included 
in the analysis because these cannot be differentiated 
from whites using the publicly available dataset. ARIC 
and CHS have a limited geographic representation, and 
results from these studies may not be generalizable to 
the overall US population. In REGARDS, adjudication of 
nonfatal CHD events is triggered by participants’ self-
report of a CHD-related hospitalization, which may 
result in underestimation of incidence rates. LVH was

defined using electrocardiography, which may lead 
to a differential detection by race and sex compared 
with echocardiography.59 Also, LVH and atrial fibrilla-
tion were measured at baseline. Some participants may 
have developed LVH or atrial fibrillation by the time of 
their incident CHD event. However, data on the pres-
ence of LVH and atrial fibrillation at the time of the 
event was not available in ARIC, CHS, and REGARDS. 
Last, we were not able to adjust CHD incidence across 
studies for changes in diagnostic methods, including 
more sensitive biomarkers.
In the current analysis, black men had a consistently 
lower incidence of nonfatal CHD compared with white 
men, although they had a higher burden of unfavor-
able social determinants of health and cardiovascular 
risk factors and a higher incidence of fatal CHD. This 
black paradox on CHD incidence does not seem to be 
explained by racial differences in undetected MIs among 
men. Indeed, black men and women had a consistently 
lower risk for nonfatal and total CHD compared with 
white men and women, respectively, after adjusting for 
social determinants of health and cardiovascular risk 
factors. Results from the current study also suggest that 
black men and women with incident CHD have higher 
case fatality compared with white men and women, 
respectively, which remained largely unexplained by so-
cial determinants of health and cardiovascular risk fac-
tors. These findings highlight the importance of primary 
prevention among blacks because they are more likely 
to die after their incident CHD event compared with 
whites.
