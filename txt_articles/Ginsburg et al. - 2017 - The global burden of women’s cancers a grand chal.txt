Abstract 
Each year, more than 2 million women are diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer, yet where 
a woman lives largely determines whether she will develop one of these cancers, have access 
to timely and effective diagnostic and treatment services, and ultimately survive. Premature 
death and disability from cancer is a preventable tragedy for hundreds of thousands of women 
and their families every year. In regions with limited resources, and a fragile or fragmented 
health system, cancer contributes to the cycle of poverty.  This is most striking for cervical 
cancer, as more than eight in ten women diagnosed and nine in ten women who die from 
cervical cancer live in a low- or middle-income country. There are proven and cost-effective 
approaches to reduce these disparities, yet for most women there are few opportunities to access 
life-saving interventions such as HPV vaccination, and cervical cancer screening with timely 
treatment of pre-cancerous lesions. These longstanding inequities highlight the urgent need for 
substantive and sustainable investments in cancer control more broadly, including prevention 
and early detection programs, capacity building for health service infrastructure and human 
resources for cancer management including all disciplines: pathology, surgery, radiotherapy, 
systemic therapy as well as palliative care. Equally vital is the development of high-quality 
population-based cancer registries, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In this 
first Series paper we describe the burden of breast and cervical cancer, with an emphasis on 
global and regional trends in incidence, mortality and survival; the social and economic impact 
on women and their families; and the disparities in cancer survival among socioeconomically 
disadvantaged women in different settings.

Introduction 
Cancer is a leading cause of premature death and disability worldwide, particularly in 
women1,2. It is a rapidly growing crisis in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 
the epidemiological transition continues to shift the burden of disease from predominantly 
infectious causes to chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs)3. Many countries, 
particularly those with weak health systems, are struggling to cope with the rapid rise in non-
communicable diseases while still experiencing high maternal and child mortality rates, and 
high mortality rates from infectious diseases (including malaria, TB, HIV/AIDS) as well as 
malnutrition.  
 
Globally, more than 2 million women are diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer each year, 
but where a woman lives, in which country, in areas remote from health care services, and how 
she lives - poor or otherwise socially disenfranchised - largely determines whether she will 
develop one of these cancers, how early she presents, and then whether she has access to safe 
and affordable diagnostic and treatment services. This is particularly striking for cervical 
cancer, as approximately 85% of women diagnosed and 88% of women who die from cervical 
cancer live in a LMIC3. There are proven approaches to reduce these disparities, including HPV 
vaccination to prevent cervical cancer, yet for most women there are few opportunities to 
access these life-saving interventions. In many countries, and in many lower-resource areas 
within countries, implementation of HPV vaccination is limited4, as is the availability of, and 
access to early detection programmes, cancer surgery5, essential cancer medicines6, 
radiotherapy7, palliative care8, as well as to support for those who survive, sometimes called 
“survivorship care”.   
 
Disability and premature death from breast or cervical cancer is a preventable tragedy for 
hundreds of thousands of women and their families each year. In 2012, breast and cervical 
cancer took the lives of 522 000 and 266 000 women respectively3; as such, close to half a 
million more women died from these two cancers alone than from complications of pregnancy 
or childbirth (303 000 maternal deaths in 2015, according to UNFPA)9. A further 152 000 
women died from ovarian cancer and 76 000 women from endometrial cancer3. But where do 
women’s cancers fit on the global health agenda? In high-income countries there is noteworthy 
advocacy, media attention and funding for research and treatment of cancer, but in many lower-
resource settings, breast, cervical and other gynaecological cancers are effectively "neglected 
diseases"10. That these diseases cause considerable disability, premature death, disruption of 
family life and loss to the national economy, thus exacerbating the cycle of poverty11, has been 
largely ignored. 
 
Only 5% of global spending on cancer is directed toward the majority of countries where the 
greatest burden exists12. Health inequities are differences in health “…that are unnecessary, 
avoidable, unfair and unjust”13.  Poor health within countries and inequities between 
countries reflect an unequal distribution of power, income, goods, and services that result 
from “ineffective social policies, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics”14.  Cancers 
that primarily affect women present particular challenges in terms of achieving health equity. 
Elevating the status of women will be one of the key drivers in reducing disparities in cancer 
outcomes within and between countries.

The Lancet Series on women’s cancers seeks to provide an advocacy and action framework for 
radically improving progress toward closing the “global cancer divide”11 for women. The three 
papers will focus on the global burden of breast and cervical cancer (Series paper 1), the 
untapped potential of proven and promising interventions, the challenges and opportunities to 
take these to scale while strengthening health systems (Series paper 2), and the provision of 
recommendations for translating evidence to policy, in order to reduce inequities and improve 
cancer survival for women (Series paper 3).  
 
In this first paper we describe the burden of breast and cervical cancer, with an emphasis on 
global and regional trends in incidence, mortality and survival; the social and economic impact 
on women and their families, and the disparities in cancer survival among socioeconomically 
disadvantaged women. Endometrial, ovarian, and other gynaecological cancers are important 
contributors to cancer mortality, but this Series will focus primarily on breast and cervical 
cancer, as two of the greatest contributors to cancer mortality and morbidity in women 
worldwide. As highlighted in this review, breast and cervical cancer will continue to pose 
particularly important challenges, as well as opportunities to strengthen health systems in most 
countries, for decades to come. Cervical cancer is largely preventable through public health 
interventions (HPV vaccination and screening with treatment of pre-cancerous lesions), and 
HPV vaccination of girls is among the few cancer-related so-called “Best Buys” or “very cost 
effective strategies” according to the World Health Organization’s Global Action Plan for the 
Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases (2013-2020)15. HPV vaccination and 
screening and treatment of pre-cancerous cervical lesions are both under consideration for the 
updated Global Action Plan, and are included in the package of essential interventions for 
cancer control in LMIC, in the new Cancer Volume of the World Bank Group’s Disease 
Control Priorities, Third Edition (DCP3)16. Although breast cancer screening continues to 
generate significant debate regarding the magnitude of benefits and harms, opportune ages and 
screening intervals, cost effectiveness, and relevance to lower resource settings (See Series 
Paper 2), improving access to early diagnosis and treatment for breast cancer is also being 
considered for the updated Plan, and promotion of breast cancer early diagnosis and treatment 
is listed in the DCP3 essential package16. We therefore address only these two cancers in this 
Series, as they fall under the domains of public health and public policy most relevant to 
women’s cancers.  
 
 
Aetiology of breast and cervical cancer 
 
The major known risk factors for breast cancer include female sex, age, and family history, as 
well as reproductive factors, including early age at menarche, later menopause, nulliparity, and 
first childbirth after age 30, all of which are independent risk factors17. Breastfeeding is 
independently associated with a reduced risk, with longer duration associated with a greater 
relative risk reduction)18. Overweight and obesity are associated with increased risk for post-
menopausal breast cancer, while the effect on pre-menopausal breast cancer is not as clear and 
remains an area of active study19. 
 
The most important risk factor for invasive cervical cancer is the human papilloma virus 
(HPV), of which there are several major oncogenic subtypes20 (discussed further in Series 
paper 2). Other independent risk factors include immunosuppression, particularly HIV21, and 
smoking 22.

Breast and cervical cancer: incidence, mortality and survival  
 
Each year 1.7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer, making it the most common 
cancer in women globally3. The highest incidence rates are reported from countries in Northern 
and Western Europe (e.g. Denmark, Belgium, UK), North America, Australia and New 
Zealand (Figure 1a), but breast cancer is not confined to high-income countries, and it is the 
most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in 140 countries. With an estimated 522 000 
deaths in 2012, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women (15% of all cancer 
deaths), ahead of lung cancer (491 000 deaths). Breast cancer survival is lower in many LMIC, 
and mortality rates vary more widely than incidence (Figure 1b). For example, estimated breast 
cancer mortality rates in the Pacific Islands (Fiji), the Caribbean (The Bahamas), Sub-Saharan 
Africa (Nigeria) and Southern Asia (Pakistan) are among the highest in the world3. 
 
It is estimated that 530 000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in 20123. It is the 
fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, but in 38 countries, including many in Sub-
Saharan Africa, it is the most common cancer among women. The highest incidence rates are 
observed in this region (Malawi and Zimbabwe, Figure 1c), although rates are also high in 
parts of Central and South America (Guyana and Bolivia). Unlike breast cancer, the global map 
of cervical cancer mortality rates is more similar to incidence (Figure 1d). 
 
Global surveillance of cancer survival trends was recently initiated by the CONCORD-2 
study23 which analysed individual data from 279 population-based registries in 67 countries for 
over 25 million adults (15-99 years) diagnosed with one of 10 common cancers during the 15-
year period 1995-2009. Net survival up to 5 years after diagnosis was estimated after correction 
for death from other causes. Data were available from 59 countries for almost 5.5 million 
women diagnosed with breast cancer. For women diagnosed during 2005–2009, 5-year net 
survival was 80% or higher in 34 countries, but much lower in India (60%), Mongolia (57%) 
and South Africa (53%) (Figure 2). In the 10 years between 1995-1999 and 2005-2009, 5-year 
survival from breast cancer increased in Central and South America (e.g. from 66% to 76% in 
Colombia). Data were available from 61 countries for 602 000 women diagnosed with cervical 
cancer. The global range in 5-year net survival was very wide. For women diagnosed during 
2005-2009, 5-year net survival was 70% or higher in 7 countries, in the range 60–69% in 34 
countries, but below 60% in a further 20 countries. 
 
A large international study followed up cancer patients diagnosed 1990-2001 in 12 
transitioning countries and noted similarly wide variations in cancer survival24. They describe 
5-year survival for breast cancer by extent of disease: “localized” versus “regional” (indicating 
larger tumours or local spread to skin, chest wall or regional lymph nodes), for countries with 
more-developed or less-developed health services. Information on the extent of disease was 
not available for the African countries in this study. Survival for women with localized disease 
was reported to be around 90% for countries with highly developed health services (Singapore 
and Turkey), compared to 76% in countries where they were less developed (Thailand, India 
and Costa Rica), with a greater disparity for women with regional disease (75.4% versus 47.4% 
for more- and less-developed health services, respectively).  
 
While each of these studies have certain limitations, they highlight the urgent need for 
investment in population-based cancer registration, in improving awareness, in early detection 
programmes, in health-services infrastructure, and increasing capacity including human 
resources23,24.

Women’s cancers and human development  
 
Breast and cervical cancer are indicative of the late phase of the epidemiological transition that 
characterises the rise of NCDs generally. Increasing life expectancy and declines in infection-
related diseases (including cervical cancer) are offset by an upsurge in cancers more frequent 
in wealthier countries and associated with a "western" environment and lifestyle25,26 referred 
to as the “ cancer transition”25. The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite index of 
three basic dimensions of human development27: a long and healthy life measured by life 
expectancy at birth, access to knowledge based on a combination of adult literacy rate and 
primary to tertiary education enrolment rates, and a decent standard of living, based on GDP 
per capita adjusted for purchasing-power parity (PPP US$). It therefore places an emphasis on 
societal values and capabilities within a country as well as economic growth. Comparing the 
national incidence burden of the two diseases by level of (HDI), the inequity is clear: cervical 
cancer comprises up to one-third of all neoplasms diagnosed (in both sexes) in many low HDI 
settings, compared with less than 10% in most very high HDI countries (Figure 3). In many 
low (and some medium) HDI countries, the combined burden of breast and cervical represents 
one-third of the total cancer burden in women; reductions in cervical cancer to rates observed 
in very HDI countries would effectively reduce this proportion to 10-15%.  
 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in most countries, including many 
where cervical cancer is endemic. This suggests that breast cancer incidence is largely 
unrelated to national averages of the HDI. Yet the relative magnitude and the extent to which 
breast cancer incidence is rising and cervical cancer incidence falling are markers of the extent 
of social and economic transition in a given country25. Changing reproductive patterns, 
including earlier age at menarche, later first childbirth, lower parity and shorter duration of 
breast-feeding are considered to be the major causes for the uniformly rising incidence of breast 
cancer in transitioning countries26 with overweight and obesity becoming increasingly 
important factors in post-menopausal breast cancer19. In some high-income countries, 
mammographic screening has generated transient rises and subsequent falls in breast cancer 
incidence while declines in the use of hormone replacement therapy (following publication of 
the Women’s Health Initiative study in 200228) was associated with a period of declining breast 
cancer incidence, a phenomenon which seems to have stabilized since 200729. Meanwhile, 
survival has been improving and mortality has been declining in many high-income countries, 
probably due to a combination of more effective treatments23,30,31 as well as earlier presentation 
and improved access to care.  
 
Declining cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in many countries over the last decades 
are associated with the implementation of effective population-based screening programmes in 
high-income countries or, in transitioning countries, a diminishing prevalence of factors 
associated with persistent infection with oncogenic subtypes of the human papilloma virus 
(HPV)32. However, there are notable exceptions. For example, steady increases in cervical 
cancer incidence have been observed in the high-risk populations in Uganda33 and Zimbabwe34. 
Increasing premature cervical cancer mortality is clearly evident from the cohort-specific 
mortality trends in some countries in Eastern Europe, and Central Asia including former 
republics of the Soviet Union35.  
 
This “overlapping challenge” whereby breast cancer incidence and mortality are increasing 
while the burden of cervical cancer is not yet declining is explored with an equity lens in a 
study from Mexico, using subnational, time series data36. The report emphasizes  
the need for integrated programmes that consider both prevention and treatment 
 Lancet Series on Women’s Cancers - 
Paper 1 REV 1 April 3, 2016  
8 
 
“underpinned by a life cycle approach to effectively respond to the burden of cancer faced by 
women globally”36.   
 
Singh et al37 reported on global inequities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality as a 
function of variations in HDI, socioeconomic factors, healthcare expenditures, and the Gender 
Inequality Index (GII) for 184 countries. GII is a composite score that includes reproductive 
health (maternal mortality ratio and adolescent birth rates), empowerment (proportion of 
women in parliament and those with secondary education), and economic status (labour force 
participation). Incidence and mortality were both correlated with human development and 
gender inequality. A 0.2 unit increase in GII was associated with a 24% increased risk of 
developing cervical cancer and a 42% increased risk of dying from the disease. While GII as a 
composite measure has its limitations, this study suggests that not only poverty reduction but 
increasing access to preventive health services, and elevating the status of women are essential 
to reducing cervical cancer disparities.  
 
Predicting the future burden  
 
Figure 4 shows the predicted global burden of breast and cervical cancers in 2030. Data 
available from long-standing high-quality population-based cancer registries from medium, 
high or very high HDI countries38 suggest that if these average changes continue and  become 
applicable to all countries of the world, the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer 
will increase to almost 3.2 million per year. Even if incidence rates can be maintained at 2012 
levels, a rise to 2.4 million new cases of breast cancer is predicted on the basis of demographic 
changes alone. For cervical cancer, even if the average decline were observed in all countries 
globally, almost the same number of women will be diagnosed in 2030 as today, around 510 
000 cases. If the cervical incidence rates were to remain unchanged, however, the number of 
women diagnosed annually is predicted to rise to over 700 000 by 2030. 
 
The societal impact of women’s cancers 
A comparative analysis of epidemiologic data on breast cancer in the United States, Canada, 
India, China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and Sweden39 showed striking differences in the 
median age at diagnosis. The peak age at diagnosis was 40-50 years in Asian countries, and 
60-70 years for Western countries. Breast cancer has also been shown to occur earlier in life in 
African countries where such data have been reported, with a median age of approximately 
4540-46. It remains unclear to what degree the earlier age at diagnosis is related to variations in 
the patterns of risk factors and breast cancer subtypes, or simply a reflection of the differences 
in population structures between countries of low, middle, and high income (for example, the 
median age of women in The Gambia is 20.5 years, and 41.6 in the UK47). 
 
The median age at diagnosis for invasive cervical cancer depends on the timing of exposure to 
oncogenic HPV subtypes, and on the latency between exposure, cervical dysplasia and other 
factors which can affect the likelihood of progressing to invasive disease, as described in the 
multistage model of carcinogenesis48. Once exposed to an oncogenic HPV subtype, the risk of 
developing invasive cervical cancer is greatly influenced by immune status, which in turn is 
related to age at exposure and general immunocompetence. Women who are HIV positive are 
especially at risk of progression to invasive cervical cancer21, particularly in the absence of 
screening programmes. 
 
 Lancet Series on Women’s Cancers - 
Paper 1 REV 1 April 3, 2016  
9 
 
The age-specific profile in high-resource countries exhibits an increase in the incidence rates 
up until the age of 30-35 years, remaining stable thereafter throughout older ages, most likely 
as a consequence of the delivery of effective cervical cancer screening programmes. In the 
United States, the median age at diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer is 47-48 years49, 
compared with 55-59 years in India50. In one multi-centre study in Limpopo, South Africa, the 
mean age at diagnosis was 41.3 and 59.1 years for HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, 
respectively51. 
 
Breast and cervical cancer are key contributors to the overall burden of disease in women. 
Breast cancer is the leading cause of life years spent with disability (YLD) in 119 countries 
while cervical cancer is the leading cause in 49 countries2. As a cause of premature death 
however – as estimated through years of life lost (YLL) – cervical cancer leads breast cancer 
in 23 countries, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Central and South America. In 
Figure 5, the DALYs (a composite measure of YLL and YLD) for cervical and breast cancer 
by four-level HDI are in opposing directions by HDI, while the relative contribution of YLL 
and YLD to DALYs also differ substantially. Breast cancer is a major contributor to the high 
overall cancer DALYs in very high HDI countries, with a relatively large contribution of YLD. 
For cervical cancer, the overall magnitude of DALYs and the large YLL component in low-
HDI countries are striking2. 
 
The impact of a mother’s death on child survival and wellbeing  
Breast and cervical cancer in lower-resource settings disproportionately affect women in the 
prime of life, resulting in significant economic and societal impact. A mother’s death has 
complex effects on the children and families she leaves behind. Women are central not only in 
direct care-giving for their own children, but more broadly in society, playing key roles in the 
socialization, education and health of children52,53. Women also make relevant, albeit under-
recognized, contributions to the health-care labour force. Langer and colleagues have described 
women’s “crucial roles in the health care of families and communities [as] drivers of the wealth 
and health of nations”53. The Lancet Commission on Women and Health53in relation to policy 
for women’s cancers is explored further in the third paper in this Series. 
 
While a close link between maternal mortality and newborn health is established53-55, most 
studies have focussed on the early weeks and months of a child’s life, highlighting the direct 
impact of inadequate nutrition from breastfeeding. It is also important to consider the impact 
of a mother’s death on child survival at other key periods over the life course, including 
adolescence. Death from untreated and unpalliated cancer is slow, agonizing, and traumatic for 
patients and families. To our knowledge there are no published studies that specifically address 
the impact of a woman’s death from cancer on her child’s survival. However, given the rising 
mortality from cancer in LMIC, and the young ages at which many so women are affected, we 
suggest that more research is needed to understand the nature and scope of the impact of a 
mother’s death from cancer on the health and well-being of her children.  
 
Economic impact of women’s cancers  
 
There is overwhelming evidence that investing in women’s health provides significant 
economic returns53, 56-59. As the economic cost of cancer is estimated at up to 4% of global 
GDP60, addressing the global burden of women’s cancers should be considered a sound 
investment by governments11,61,62. The case is compelling given the profound impact of these 
cancers on premature death and disability, with substantial and long-lasting social, financial 
 Lancet Series on Women’s Cancers - 
Paper 1 REV 1 April 3, 2016  
10 
 
and economic consequences for the affected women, their immediate family and their wider 
community.  
 
Beyond evaluating the cost effectiveness of interventions for breast and cervical cancer control 
(Series Paper 2), there is a critical need for more evidence on the macroeconomic burden of 
women’s cancers. Of the 1,676,255 studies on cervical and breast cancer examined by this 
Series only 3% included an economics component. Furthermore, only one in 10 of these was 
from a low or middle-income setting. The majority of economic studies identified were based 
in high-income countries and concerned economic evaluations of the costs and benefits of 
specific interventions, often under trial conditions, rather than in resource-poor settings or on 
the wider micro- and macro-economic impacts in resource-poor settings. There is very little 
information on the economic impact of advocacy or the long-term impact on women with 
cancer (“survivorship”). If we exclude cost-effectiveness studies focused on specific 
interventions and concentrate on studies exploring the wider economic impacts of the two 
cancers, the cervical cancer studies are quite evenly spread across all World Bank income 
country classifications. However, there were no studies on the wider economic impact of breast 
cancer specifically from low-income countries.  
 
At the macro-economic level, cancer impacts the national economy and society at large through 
increased health expenditure, labour and productivity losses, and reduced investment in human 
and physical capital formation. At the micro-economic level there are profound effects on 
women, their families, individual firms [companies?] and governments63,64. It is important to 
note that much of the work undertaken by women is not associated with monetary transactions 
and is therefore unlikely to be reflected in conventional macro-economic indicators53. Any 
calculations aiming to assess the economic burden associated with breast and cervical cancer 
should therefore capture non-income-generating work, such as gathering water and firewood, 
preparing food, tending to livestock, and caring for children.  
 
If we go beyond the individual impact on women who are diagnosed with, or die from, cancer 
of the breast or cervix, and include their families, catastrophic expenditure is often more 
stark65,66. Families are likely to face large medical and non-medical costs, forced to sell assets 
and accrue debts67-70. This is frequently exacerbated by employment-related complications 
such as decreased productivity, job loss, dismissal, and reduction of work-related benefits71. A 
2015 report of 9513 adults with cancer from eight countries in Southeast Asia66 found that one 
year after diagnosis, 29% had died, 48% experienced financial catastrophe, and just 23% were 
alive with no financial catastrophe. Low income was an independent predictor for financial 
catastrophe, as was education and stage at diagnosis.  
 
Research conducted in Argentina72, at that time a middle-income country, found a marked 
socio-economic impact on women with cervical cancer, with negative consequences on 
radiotherapy treatment compliance, despite the fact that 96% of patients reported their 
radiotherapy was free of charge, either covered by social security, the hospital or other agency. 
Moreover, study participants reported work interruption (28%), a reduction in hours worked 
(45%), loss of household income (39%) with nearly one in five families reporting a loss of 50% 
or more, a reduction in the daily amount of food consumed (37%), delays in paying for essential 
services such as electricity or telephone (43%), and the sale of property or use of savings (38%).  
 
It is crucial to understand the social, economic, and financial impact of breast and cervical 
cancer on the health system71-75. How the health system is structured and financed16,76 dictates 
many of the socio-economic determinants and inequities of access to health services. In

addition, the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of interventions for breast and cervical cancer 
control must be critically evaluated to help inform and prioritise evidence-based, resource-
appropriate programs and policy-making. Comprehending the political economy in which 
decisions on resource allocation are made, both nationally and internationally, is essential if 
we are to address the macro- and micro-economic impact of breast and cervical cancer77,78. The 
policy implications are examined in greater depth in paper 3 of this Series (ref). 
 
Conclusions 
 
There are huge global disparities in cancer survival for women[ref]. In lower-resource settings, 
breast and cervical cancer disproportionately affect women in the prime of life, resulting in 
significant economic and societal impact. A woman's country, region of residence, income 
level, socio-economic, ethno-cultural or migration status should no longer be allowed to[?] 
influence the likelihood of dying from these common cancers. Effective, affordable, cost-
effective and life-saving interventions exist.  
 
Several global initiatives are broadening their approach to women’s health along the life-
course79,80. The UN Secretary General’s Every Woman Every Child (EWEC) Global Strategy 
2.0 aims to accelerate efforts to end preventable maternal, newborn, child and adolescent deaths 
by 2030. At the 2016 World Economic Forum,  [a?] new EWEC high-level advisory group was 
announced to move the new strategy forward, and to ensure that “every women, child, and 
adolescent not only survives, but thrives”81. On World Cancer Day, 2016, UN Secretary 
General Ban Ki Moon released a statement that addressed the global inequities in women’s 
cancers, and called for action to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health concern82.  
 
International efforts have recently led to major improvements in maternal health outcomes: a 
similar global drive is urgently needed to reduce the impact of breast and cervical cancer, which 
currently take the lives of some 800 000 women every year. Cancer control for women may be 
introduced through the new high-priority health and development goals that are beginning to 
take shape. These topics are explored further in the second and third papers in this Series.

Key Messages 
1. Globally, almost two thirds of women who die from breast cancer and nine in ten women 
who die from cervical cancer live in low- and middle-income countries. This is a largely 
preventable tragedy for hundreds of thousands of women and their families each year. 
 Lancet Series on Women’s Cancers - 
Paper 1 REV 1 April 3, 2016

2. Most women who develop breast or cervical cancer in a high-income country will survive; 
the opposite is true for women in most low and many middle-income countries. Where a 
woman lives, her socio-economic, ethno-cultural or migration status should no longer mean 
the difference between life and death from these common cancers, for which cost-effective, 
life-saving interventions exist.  
3. The incidence of breast cancer is expected to increase rapidly with human development. 
While invasive cervical cancer should be predicted to fall in emerging economies, this is not 
yet the case in many countries where patterns of sexual behavior are increasing the 
transmission of oncogenic HPV subtypes, and population-based organized HPV vaccination 
and cervical screening programs are not yet widely implemented.  
4. It is crucial to understand the social, economic, and financial impact of breast and cervical 
cancers, which take a disproportionate toll on women in LMIC, and in the prime of life. The 
efficacy and cost-effectiveness of interventions for breast and cervical cancer control must be 
critically evaluated to help inform and prioritise evidence-based, resource-appropriate 
programs and policy-making. 
5. Global efforts, particularly in recent years, have led to significant improvements in 
maternal health outcomes. Similar efforts are urgently needed to address breast and cervical 
cancer, which take the lives of three times as many women each year.  
 
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria 
Studies were retrieved through systematic searches on the following medical and social 
sciences electronic databases: EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE (OVID), Scopus, Web of 
Science and Econlit. Variations of  search terms related to ‘breast cancer’, ‘cervical cancer’, 
‘low income’, ‘middle income’, ‘developing’ countries , the individually named countries of 
relevance, ‘economic burden’ and ‘economic consequence’, were combined. We searched 
Google Scholar, scanned the reference lists of the studies retrieved and hand searched the 
resources and publications of institutional websites. Searches were limited to studies 
published in English after 1990 containing original quantitative estimates of economic 
impact.

PANEL 1: Survival disparities in North America and Europe  
 
Disparities in breast and cervical cancer survival exist within and between high-income 
countries25, 83-85. Age-adjusted 5-year survival from breast cancer varies by as much as 20% 
between European Union countries, with lower survival recorded in Eastern European 
countries85. The international differences in survival have been attributed to differences in stage 
at diagnosis, access to optimal treatment and national levels of organisation and investment in 
health care. A European survey on the availability, reimbursement, and other barriers to access 
reveals important disparities across Europe in access to cancer medicines86. Even in the EU, 
drug shortages limit access to older, inexpensive medicines that are essential for treatment 
(with curative or palliative intent), such as tamoxifen for breast cancer, or cisplatin and 5-
fluorouracil for cervical cancer. In view of their proven efficacy and low cost, these agents, 
which are included in the recently updated Essential Medicines List6 of the World Health 
Organization, should be made universally available for all who require them. 
 
It is unclear to what extent differences in tumour biology versus social, economic and other 
factors play a role in survival disparities within countries. A number of studies have found a 
greater proportion of triple-negative breast cancers among African-American women87,88, a 
subtype associated with a poorer survival. However, a recent population-based study in the 
US87 found persistent differences in 7-year breast cancer-specific survival between African-
American and White women, even for stage I disease. The difference in breast cancer-specific 
survival remained important even after excluding triple negative tumours. This study did not 
explore access and utilization of cancer services. 
 
African-American women87-95 and women from other minority populations in the US87-91,94-96, 
the UK97 and Canada98-100 tend to have lower participation in breast and cervical cancer 
screening programmes and, with some exceptions101, lower cancer survival than the 
corresponding national averages. Reasons for these disparities are poorly understood and 
include socioeconomic factors such as economic deprivation, geographic distance to cancer 
services, lack of health insurance and other social and cultural factors which could affect 
health-care seeking behaviour87-89,92,100.  
 
In recognition of the magnitude and pervasiveness of these inequities, a number of regional, 
national and international cancer organizations have established programmes and policies to 
reduce cancer disparities, not only for breast and cervical cancers but also for cancers more 
generally, in men, women and children.  
 
 
Panel 2: Cancer incidence and survival among indigenous women  
 
Indigenous people in many high-income countries have disproportionally worse health and 
lower life expectancy than their non-indigenous counterparts. A study led by IARC comparing 
the scale and profile of cancer incidence among indigenous and non-indigenous populations in 
USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand has revealed high rates of cervical cancer in almost 
all jurisdictions, emphasising the need for targeted prevention strategies in these populations102.  
 
Survival from breast and cervical cancer is lower among indigenous women than the national 
averages in the US, Canada, and Australia 103-107. Vasilevska and colleagues conducted a 
systematic review and meta-analysis of cervical cancer in indigenous women in Australia, New 
Zealand, Canada, and the U.S.103. Of note, they found no difference in the risk for cervical 
 Lancet Series on Women’s Cancers - 
Paper 1 REV 1 April 3, 2016  
21 
 
dysplasia or carcinoma in situ but they did find an elevated risk of invasive cervical cancer 
(pooled RR 1.72) and cervical cancer mortality (pooled RR 3.45). As the indigenous women 
had a higher risk of cervical cancer morbidity and mortality but no increased risk of early-stage 
disease, they suggest, “structural, social, or individual barriers to screening, rather than baseline 
risk factors, are influencing poor health outcomes”. 
 
There remains, however, little information on cancer incidence, survival, and the level of access 
to cancer services among indigenous populations in LMIC. Recent global and regional reports 
reviewing cancer among indigenous communities have highlighted the need for more attention 
to this issue102,108. Efforts to develop joint actions as a partnership between Governments, 
health professionals and the indigenous communities will be critical in reducing the elevated 
and avoidable burden of cancer among Indigenous peoples worldwide102.
