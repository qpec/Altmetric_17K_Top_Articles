Abstract
Children are at risk for adverse health outcomes from occupant-controllable indoor airborne
contaminants in their homes. Data are needed to design residential interventions for reduc-
ing low-income children’s pollutant exposure. Using customized air quality monitors, we
continuously measured fine particle counts (0.5 to 2.5 microns) over a week in living areas
of predominantly low-income households in San Diego, California, with at least one child
(under age 14) and at least one cigarette smoker. We performed retrospective interviews on
home characteristics, and particle source and ventilation activities occurring during the
week of monitoring. We explored the relationship between weekly mean particle counts and
interview responses using graphical visualization and multivariable linear regression (base
sample n = 262; complete cases n = 193). We found associations of higher weekly mean
particle counts with reports of indoor smoking of cigarettes or marijuana, as well as with fry-
ing food, using candles or incense, and house cleaning. Lower particle levels were associ-
ated with larger homes. We did not observe an association between lower mean particle
counts and reports of opening windows, using kitchen exhaust fans, or other ventilation
activities. Our findings about sources of fine airborne particles and their mitigation can
inform future studies that investigate more effective feedback on residential indoor-air-qual-
ity and better strategies for reducing occupant exposures.

 particles (0.5 to 2.5 micrometers) in homes of predominantly low-income families containing
one or more smokers and at least one young child. Low-income families may be at more risk
for particulate matter exposure from smoking and other indoor air contaminants [1,2]. Indoor
levels of fine particles in residences are derived from indoor sources or from infiltration of out-
door particles, and can be controlled by occupants [3]. Over 85% of people’s time, on average,
is spent indoors and mostly at home [4]. In a seminal review of particles in homes, Wallace
et al. (1996) reported smoking and cooking to be important indoor sources [5].
Household occupants can experience short and long-term health effects associated with
acute and cumulative exposure to indoor airborne particles. The health consequences are espe-
cially important for children whose lungs are not fully developed and who breathe around
three times more air per kilogram of body weight than adults [6]. Fine particle pollution in
outdoor air is monitored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as part of its PM2.5
National Ambient Air Quality Standard to protect public health [7]; particle pollution has
been associated with respiratory and cardiovascular effects, and increased morbidity and mor-
tality [8–11]. Particulate matter is also a commonly-used indicator of secondhand tobacco
smoke [12]. The acute and chronic detrimental health effects of exposure to tobacco smoke are
well-documented [13,14]. Furthermore, the level of fine airborne particles indicates if other
combustion-generated pollutants (e.g., volatile organics in cooking emissions or incense emis-
sions) are present and provides information on the effectiveness of pollutant removal mecha-
nisms (e.g., natural or forced ventilation). The level of fine particles in residences depends on
emission source activity, the physical characteristics of the residence, and removal activity.
Research is needed on interventions for private homes that promote strategies to avoid or
reduce indoor air pollution from tobacco and other sources. By understanding source and mit-
igation effects for households with different physical characteristics, we can optimize interven-
tions by identifying specific occupant-modifiable behaviors and characteristics. While models
[15] and small-scale field studies (e.g., Ott et al. 2003 [16]) have established physics-based the-
ory and the broad impact of different occupant activities on fine particle levels in homes,
empirical data from a large sample are needed to confirm influential factors in homes with
varying family types.
This study was motivated by a need to develop effective interventions targeting children
exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) in homes (pilot study described by Klepeis
et al. 2013 [17]). As reported by Rosen et al. (2014) in a meta-analysis of 30 child-SHS inter-
vention studies, while some past intervention studies (primarily based on counseling) have
shown moderate impact, improved interventions (e.g., with feedback on SHS) are needed to
reduce children’s SHS exposure [18]. Recently, some intervention researchers have reported
on smoke particle levels and exposures in the home, removal rates, alternate sources of fine
particles, or the physical dwelling characteristics (e.g., [19,20]), or provide initial evidence
that SHS interventions incorporating feedback on SHS levels can reduce particle count mea-
sures and presumably child exposures [17,21]. Continued refinement of real-time instru-
ments and their application in real-time interventions may better prevent or reduce SHS
exposures and result in more smoke-free environments [17]. Since SHS is the central inter-
vention interest for the present data set and future studies, our investigation focuses initially
on levels of particles contributed by smoking, primarily cigarettes. Exposure to third hand
smoke (THS), which occurs by direct contact with surfaces or dust contaminated with SHS
emissions, or by inhalation of compounds off-gassing from walls, carpets, drapes etc. [22],
may also be targeted by interventions.
Few prior air monitoring studies have considered comprehensive source or ventilation-
related determinants of particles in homes or measured fine particles in a large sample of
low-income homes. A recent study by Urso et al. (2015) of many building factors and their

 association with size-differentiated particle levels in 60 mostly non-smoking (70%) households
in Italy found that sealing doors and windows, using kitchen air-exhaust systems, building
density around the home, and larger home volume lowered levels of fine particles [23]. The
main determinants of elevated indoor fine particles were tobacco smoking, burning fireplace
wood, the number of occupants, and time spent cleaning. Baxter et al. (2007) measured sam-
ples of integrated (filter and pump) fine particulate matter in 43 low socioeconomic-status
(SES) homes in the Boston Area, confirming that cooking and stove usages, along with resus-
pension activities (e.g., dusting, sweeping, vacuuming), contribute to indoor levels, with occu-
pant activities driving indoor levels more than housing characteristics [24]. A number of large
monitoring studies in Europe, the U.S., and Canada confirm the general importance of
tobacco smoking, cooking, cleaning, and outdoor levels as particle determinants [25–31].
The objective of the present study is to provide new findings on fine particle levels in at-risk
homes that will better inform efforts to develop and implement particle-reduction interven-
tions, especially for SHS. The unique advantages of the present study are: (1) its focus on pre-
dominantly low-income household residents, who are likely to be at significant risk to
smoking and other indoor contaminants; (2) a relatively large analytic sample size (n = 262);
(3) interview data for many different types of smoking and other particle-generating activities,
ventilation, and home size; and (4) week-long continuous monitoring data, which cover week-
day and weekend activity cycles. These features of our study allow us to examine a wide range
of potential fine particle sources (e.g., tobacco, marijuana, incense, e-cigarettes), home sizes,
potential behaviors (e.g., fan use, indoor/outdoor smoking) in predominantly low-income
homes that may affect air quality and may be incorporated into feedback provided to interven-
tion participants.
Materials and methods
Data source
Data for this study were from participants enrolled in a randomized controlled intervention
trial designed to reduce secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposure in children by making use
of real-time feedback on particle levels (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01634334). The pres-
ent paper is limited to investigation of particle levels and their determinants in participants’
homes during a baseline period for combined treatment and control groups. Future papers
will examine the overall outcome of the intervention trial and the impact of particle feedback,
including differential levels by study condition. This study enrolled 298 households (one adult
and one child participant per household), who were recruited during 2012–2015 from multiple
sources, including Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Special Supplemental Nutrition Pro-
grams sites in San Diego Country, community tabling events, health care professional referrals,
local organizations, and advertisement. Eligibility criteria included: parent/guardian 18 years
or older; at least one child under 14 years of age in the household; at least one smoker living in
the household who smoked inside or outside the home; no plans to move outside the County
within 4 months; and speaks English or Spanish. The San Diego State University Institutional
Review Board approved the procedures for this study (IRB Study Number 770080). One adult
participant in each household signed an informed consent agreement, whereupon the adult
and the youngest child in the home were enrolled as participants in the study. The first 36
homes enrolled comprised our pilot study sample and participants in these homes were not
administered the final smoking-related questions; the pilot homes were excluded from our
analysis, leaving an analytic base sample of 262 households.
The participant characteristics for the analytic sample are summarized in Table 1. Enrolled
parents (EP) were 95% female, 38% Hispanic, 27% Non-Hispanic White, and 67% with ages

 between 25 and 40; 40% were employed; and 36% had no education beyond high school.
Enrolled children (EC) were 48% female, 49% Hispanic, 19% Non-Hispanic White, and aver-
aged 4.2 (SD = 3.7) years of age. The median categorical annual family income was $20,000 to
$30,000 with 39% of families having income less than $20,000 and 81% of families having
income less than $50,000. For reference, according to the US Censor Bureau (2015), the pov-
erty thresholds for households with 3 to 6 people and 1 to 5 children are roughly in the range
of $20,000 to $30,000 per year [32].
Data collection and measures of interest
This article focuses on the first week of baseline data collection, which spanned the time
between home Visit 1 and Visit 2, roughly 7 days apart. We collected data on the physical char-
acteristics of the residence, emission source activity, ventilation activity, and continuous parti-
cle counts. During Visit 1, trained research assistants used Bosch Laser Distance Measurers
(DLR130K, Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart, Germany) to measure the length, width, and
height of the room containing the monitor from which we calculated the room volume. The
physical characteristics (Table 2) were obtained from interviews and extracted from detailed
floor plans drawn by trained staff.
At Visit 1, a customized Dylos™ DC1700 Air Quality Monitor (Dylos Corporation, River-
side, CA USA) was placed in homes to continuously measure counts per 0.01 cubic feet of par-
ticles with diameters between 0.5 and 2.5 micrometers. As described by Klepeis et al. 2013 [17]
for a similar instrument used in an SHS intervention, the Dylos unit had expanded data stor-
age, special firmware, wireless connectivity, and lights and sounds triggered by particle level
thresholds. Lights and sounds [33] were disabled for the baseline data used in the present anal-
ysis. The monitors recorded 10-second average counts (derived from 1-second average read-
ings in internal memory) in the room closest to the usual cigarette smoking location (as
reported by the participants). Monitors were placed at least 3 feet from the floor and a mini-
mum of 1 foot from the nearest wall to provide consistent air flow. The feasibility of using
Dylos-brand monitors to measure fine particle levels in homes or under controlled conditions
has been demonstrated [17,34–40]. For fresh emissions, Klepeis et al. (2013) and Dacunto
et al. (2015) reported reasonable agreement between the Dylos and mass particle concentra-
tions of tobacco smoke measured every minute using calibrated industry-standard particle-
mass-measurement instruments (DustTrak and SidePak, TSI, Inc., Shoreview, MN) [17,40].
Semple et al. (2013) showed a trend for long-term SidePak versus Dylos measurements in 34
homes [39]. In general, the Dylos factory-calibrated monitors provide acceptable unit-to-unit
consistency and, while their accuracy for measuring absolute fine particle mass concentrations
for different sources is low, they are still useful for providing broad feedback in behavioral

 applications or personal awareness activities, and for investigating relative measures of particle
counts within and between homes, as in the current application.
During Visit 2, trained staff administered a computer-assisted face-to-face interview to
gather data about behaviors during the preceding 7-day period. Key questions were asked
about the smoking habits of each household member, other particle-generating behaviors
(e.g., burning candles, using a wood fireplace), and ventilation activities (Table 2). Participants
were provided between $20 and $35 (modified during the study with IRB approval) for partici-
pating in the interview.
For data analyses, responses to questions about particle generating behaviors and ventila-
tion activities were dichotomized—effectively measuring whether the activity occurred on any
day during the last 7 days (“0 days” versus “> 0 days”; or “0 times” versus “> 0 times” for
smoking behaviors only). This procedure was used to facilitate interpretation of regression
coefficients for variables originally measured using different scales (Table 2).
The dependent variable used for analysis in this study was weekly mean particle levels. For
each home, all available particle data from the week-long period prior to the baseline interview

Variables
Measurement Method
Distance from roadway
(via direct on-site observation) We estimated the distance from the
road to the nearest window in three categories: <50 feet; 50–100
feet; >100 feet.
Home type
(via direct on-site observation) We categorized homes into: (a)
detached house, (b) townhouse, (c) apartment/condo, (d) duplex, or
(e) trailer/mobile home. A small number of townhouses, duplexes,
and mobile homes were combined into a separate category labeled
“other”.
Number of levels
(via interview) The number of levels in each home.
Number of rooms
(via interview) The total number of rooms in each home.
Number of bedrooms
(via interview) The number of bedrooms in each home.
Number of bathrooms
(via interview) The number of bathrooms in each home.
Number of exterior doors
(via interview) The number of doors leading to a patio or balcony;
due to the skewed distribution (6 homes reported between 5 and 9
exterior doors), responses to this question were truncated to 4 doors
for analysis.
Occupant Particle Source Activity—
Smoking
(via interview) For cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah/
waterpipe, electronic cigarettes, medicinal or recreational marijuana,
other recreational drugs, participants were asked “How often in the
past 7 days did anyone smoke _________ in your home?”
Responses were coded: never, 1–3 times, 4–6 times, 7–9 times,
�10 times and dichotomized in the analysis to “0 times” and “> 0
times”.
Occupant Particle Source Activity—
Other than Smoking
(via interview) Participants were asked the number of days in the
past 7 days that each of the following occurred: use of wood burning
stove or fireplace, use of gas heater, burning incense or candles,
burning food, frying or saute
´ing food with oil or fat, use of gas/
propane appliance to cook or heat food, use of electric appliance to
cook/heat food, use of aerosol spray products, and vacuuming-
dusting-sweeping. Responses were dichotomized in the analysis to
“0 days” and “> 0 days”.
Occupant Ventilation Activity
(via interview) Participants were asked the number of days in the
past 7 days that each of the following occurred: use of central air
handling system, use of an air purifier, use of an exhaust fan in the
kitchen, use of a window fan or window air conditioner, opened a
window, and opened an exterior door. Responses were
dichotomized in the analysis to “0 days” and “> 0 days”.

 (e.g., from Monday to Monday) were averaged. All homes included in the final analytic sample
for regression modeling provided data for least 5 days; there was one home that contributed
only 5 days of data, 3 homes that contributed 6 days of data, 145 that contributed 7 days of
data, and 44 homes that contributed 8 days of data (due to delays in scheduling Visit 2).
Data analysis
We used conventional techniques in our analysis approach to provide an overview of the data
to identify influential correlates, and provide both graphical (model-free) and model-based
indicators of association. Our approach consisted of three components: (1) descriptive statis-
tics of interview variables for indoor versus no reported indoor smoking; (2) graphical visuali-
zation of weekly mean particle count distributions as a function of interview variables; and (3)
a statistical model-building approach employing linear regression to identify influential vari-
ables. We accomplished all graphical and statistical analysis using the R programming envi-
ronment [41].
Of the 298 households enrolled in the larger trial, the first 36 pilot homes enrolled were not
asked questions about key particle generating behaviors related to smoking, leaving 262 (88%)
homes eligible for analysis. Graphical analyses were conducted using all available data. See S1
and S2 Tables with sample sizes for graphical analysis subgroups. To ensure that each stage of
statistical model building was conducted on the same sample, we used a complete-case analy-
sis, whereby homes were included that provided data for all potential correlates that were sig-
nificantly related to mean 7-day particle levels at an alpha level of 0.20 (from bivariate analysis
of variables shown in Table 2). This procedure resulted in a final modeling sample of 193
homes.
Descriptive statistics of all potential correlates.
The potential correlates are housing
characteristics, and particle-generating and ventilation activities. We report descriptive statis-
tics for the overall sample, as well as homes with and without self-reported indoor cigarettes
smoked, providing an analysis of the composition of two sub-groups of primary interest with
substantial sample size. Assessment of the contribution of indoor cigarette smoking to indoor
particles and examination of potential confounding variables provide a foundation for subse-
quent analysis and the evaluation of particle sources in future interventions. Means and stan-
dard deviations were used to summarize continuous variables and percentages for categorical
variables. We used two-sample t-tests assuming equal variance for continuous variables and
chi-square tests for variables with > 2 categories. Binary variables were compared with two-
sided tests for equal proportions. We used Fisher’s Exact test for comparisons of variables with
an n-size < 5 in any cell.
Graphical analysis.
The visualization of empirical data using graphs provides a means to:
(1) understand broad, raw effects of different variables unclouded by parametric assumptions;
(2) interpret data in light of expected results (from particle dynamics and the mass balance
equation; see [42,43]); (3) inform variable selection in our subsequent parametric, multivari-
able (regression) analysis; and (4) corroborate the findings of parametric analysis. Graphs are
an established feature of exploratory data analysis [44]. We use log-probability plots, a type of
quantile-quantile plot, to provide non-parametric visualization of empirical cumulative parti-
cle concentration distributions. In general, a quantile-quantile plot, such as those implemented
with the qqnorm() function in R [41], consists of the sorted values of a numeric vector plotted
against its computed normal quantiles (i.e., quantiles if the distribution is normal). For the spe-
cial case of a log-probability plot, we use a logarithmic vertical axis and normal-quantile hori-
zontal axis labeled with probabilities rather than quantile values, so that data appearing along a
straight line are log-normally distributed and one can easily read the approximate percentiles

 for each plotted distribution. This type of plot facilitates visual analysis and comparison of dis-
tributions for approximately log-normal responses. The plots reveal the sample size along the
whole distribution, highlighting areas where a small sample size may mask comparative
effects.
Statistical model building.
The weekly mean particle counts were log-transformed using
natural logarithms to better meet the ordinary least squares (OLS) assumption of normality,
though the distribution remained slightly right-skewed. Log-transforming the dependent vari-
able (weekly mean particle counts) had the added benefit of improving interpretability of the
regression coefficients (β) such that a 1-unit change in any continuous variable or an overall
change in any binary independent variable was associated with an (eβ-1)�100 percentage
change in the dependent variable (holding all other correlates constant) [45]. Selection of influ-
ential correlates was accomplished using a common stepwise model-building procedure that
can be used for traditional hypothesis testing, but is more appropriate for exploratory studies
such as the present study [46,47]. The 3 steps in the procedure are listed below. Stepwise selec-
tion can eliminate variables that influence effect estimates but do not improve overall model
fit; to protect against this, we included a model-building step to identify confounders (Step 3).
1. The weekly mean particle counts were regressed on each potential correlate (shown in
Table 2) using single-variable linear regression models (i.e., bivariate, or simple linear
regression). Particle-generating and ventilation activities reported by 10 homes or fewer
were not considered in our analysis due to insufficient sample size. Marginally-significant
correlates (p-value of � 0.20) were retained for further variable selection procedures
[48,49].
2. Three multivariable linear regression models were fit using potential correlates retained
from Step 1; one containing household characteristics, one containing particle-generating
behaviors, and one containing ventilation activities. Multicollinearity was assessed in all
models using the variance inflation factor (VIF) with a VIF � 5 indicating multicollinearity;
potential correlates in all three models had VIFs < 2. The OLS assumption of linearity was
confirmed by two-way plots of the final model residuals and each independent variable. To
identify influential correlates, we used stepwise selection with “backward elimination” then
“forward selection” based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) using the step() func-
tion in R [41], separately for each of the 3 multivariable models: household characteristics,
particle generating behaviors, and ventilation activities.
3. Correlates identified using selection procedures from all three models in Step 2 formed a
final multivariable linear regression model. To isolate additional influential variables (con-
founders), each potential correlate removed during Step 2 was reentered into the final
model one at a time beginning with the variable with the smallest p-value from Step 1. Vari-
ables were retained in the final model only if their inclusion resulted in a � 10% change in
the beta coefficient of statistically significant variables in that model. White’s method of
adjusting for heteroscedasticity [50,51] was employed using the Heteroskedasticity Consis-
tent Covariance Matrix Estimation function (vcovHC) within the sandwich R package [41].
We report unstandardized beta coefficients.
Additional tests. We tested whether the association of weekly mean particle counts and
ventilation activities differed for homes with and without indoor cigarette smoking by includ-
ing multiplicative interactions (e.g., any reported indoor cigarette smoking � open a window)

Results
Descriptive statistics of housing characteristics, particle-generating and
ventilation activities
Table 3 shows the 193 homes included in the statistical analysis split by indoor cigarette-smok-
ing status, which is a key variable of interest. Overall, they had an average of 2.6 bedrooms, 1.6
bathrooms and were mostly one story (mean (SD) number of levels = 1.1 (0.4)). In total, 44
(22.8%) homes reported at least one household member smoking at least one cigarette indoors
in the 7-days prior to interview. With the exception of the number of doors leading outside,
none of the home characteristics of families with and without self-reported indoor cigarette
smoking differed significantly (p’s � 0.05). Homes without indoor cigarette smoking reported
indoor smoking of cigars (1.3%), hookah (0.8%), electronic cigarettes (14.1%), marijuana
(10.1%), and other drugs (0.7%). With the exceptions of cigar, pipe, electronic cigarette, and
marijuana smoking, the 7-day prevalence of all particle generating behaviors did not differ sig-
nificantly by indoor cigarette smoking status (p’s � 0.05). Nearly all homes reported opening a
window (95.3%) or opening a door (96.9%) for ventilation purposes. Most homes (60.1%)
reported using an exhaust fan in their kitchen and 8.3% of homes used an air purifier. There
were no significant differences between homes with and without indoor cigarette smoking
with respect to ventilation activities (p’s � 0.05), except the use of central air conditioning
which was higher among homes without indoor cigarette smoking (25.5% vs. 6.8%; p = 0.030).
Empirical particle distributions
Effects of room and home size.
The size of a residence is an important consideration
when designing pollutant or air-quality feedback for household residents. Low-SES popula-
tions may have higher pollutant levels due to having smaller homes with lower mixing vol-
umes. From the physics of particle dynamics [42,43], we anticipate, for consistent source and
ventilation activity, magnitude, and mixing, that particle concentrations will be larger in
homes with smaller volumes and smaller in homes with larger volumes. Henschen et al. (1997)
found that a smaller size of dwelling for 602 school children was associated with higher passive
smoking exposures [52]. For individual homes, we expect to observe a clear result as predicted
by the mass balance equation, although compartment and proximity effects (non-instanta-
neous mixing of pollutants) introduce more complexity [16,53,54]. Concentrations nearer an
active or recently-active source, or the room in which a source is active, are higher than in fur-
ther away or separate rooms. Closed doors also inhibit the flow of air and pollutants, increas-
ing the compartmental character of a home [55]. However, for population data, whether we
see a trend in particle levels versus space volume depends on how consistent overall source-,
mixing-, and ventilation-activity are from one home to the next.
Fig 1 shows the weekly mean particle concentration as a function of the volume of moni-
tored room. Small volumes have a higher mean particle level with an overall non-linear trend.
However, the intermediate region with many data points has no evident trend. This finding is
consistent with the variation in sources and ventilation between homes and the smudging of
differences for homes with approximately the same layouts and overall volumes. However, we
see the expected trend of higher/lower levels with lower/higher monitoring-room volumes
emerging at the extremes. In the extreme cases, volumes reach limits and/or home layouts may
be substantially different from other homes, so that as volume increases, we see particle levels

 decrease to near-background levels. Similarly, at lower room volumes we see some homes have
much higher particle levels than others. While it is possible that source activity or ventilation
could play a role in these observations, it is also likely that, since activities like smoking, cook-
ing, and window-or-fan-based ventilation are not likely to be very different between homes,
that volume of homes plays a role.
Fig 2 compares weekly mean particle count distributions for 6 home-size-related factors:
Number of Levels; Number of Exterior Doors; Number of Bedrooms, Number of Bathrooms,
and the Type of Home (apartment/detached). The range of observed weekly mean particle
counts for the total sample was 556 to 28,400 counts per 0.01 cubic feet. The number of levels
in a home indicates overall home size and a larger mixing volume for diluting particle emis-
sions. The population distributions for 1 and 2 levels appear parallel on the Fig 2 log-proba-
bility plot with particle counts for 1 level greater than for 2 levels. This finding is consistent
with the theoretical expectation. Homes with 1 versus 2 levels near the median particle con-
centration appear different on the order of 100 counts, whereas at the upper extremes of the
distribution, the mean levels can be different by 1,000 to 10,000 counts. The difference in
particle distributions for homes with different numbers of exterior doors bedrooms or bath-
rooms displays a similar pattern. In general, with more doors, bedrooms, or bathrooms, all
indicators of larger home size, the weekly mean particle concentrations are lower by as much
as 1,000 to 10,000 counts at the extremes of the distribution. The type of home also appears
to influence particle concentration in the upper quartiles of the distributions (difference of

houses.
Smoking source activity.
The central aim of the present work is to explore occupant-con-
trolled household activities that influence levels of indoor particles in a large sample of homes
(n = 262). Smoking source activity is of primary interest since it generates large emissions and
can be relocated or reduced based on household practices. To explore the effect of smoking on
indoor fine particle levels, we plotted the raw distributions of weekly mean particle concentra-
tions for the dichotomous occurrence of 7 types of smoking during the week (Fig 3) to identify,
by visual inspection, those that had a substantial impact on the distribution. Distributions are
plotted for homes reporting “0 times” or “> 0 times” of use during the week. Clearly, indoor
use of cigarettes resulted in higher particles levels in the population. The “> 0 times” of indoor
smoking group (n = 55) had median levels close to 2000 counts greater than the “0 times”
group (n = 201) with the distributions diverging so that at the upper tail indoor smoking could
contribute up to 20,000 more weekly mean counts. This finding is consistent with previous
research that shows smoking cigarettes elevates particle levels in individual rooms of homes on
the order of 100’s of μg/m3 (e.g., Ott et al. 2003 [16]), which are roughly equivalent to counts
on the order of 20,000 counts per 0.01 cubic feet as measured by the Dylos Air Quality Monitor
for secondhand smoke [40]. In California, medical marijuana use is legal. A sizable number of

 homes (n = 33) reported smoking marijuana from 1 to 7 times per week (“> 0 times”) with
higher levels at all percentiles than homes not reporting marijuana smoking. While smoking
of marijuana is known to produce sizable particle emissions and constituents comparable to
tobacco smoke [56], not as much is known about population-scale indoor marijuana levels in
homes. It appears from our distribution results that it may contribute to indoor particle pollu-
tion as much as cigarettes do. Like marijuana, cigars and incense are also known to be sources
of indoor particle concentrations comparable to cigarettes [57]. Our sample had relatively few
homes that reported cigar use (n = 14), but those that did had higher levels than those that did
not at an amount similar to the difference for cigarettes (median was 2,000 counts higher).
Those at the high end had weekly means that were 1,000’s of counts greater. Data on pipes,
hookahs, and smoking other drugs were too sparse (n = 1 to 5 reporting usage) to draw mean-
ingful conclusions. If data on these sources are desired in future studies, it is advisable to focus
on such homes using a concentrated sample. We observed no apparent difference in the
weekly mean particle distribution between 43 homes reporting any electronic cigarette usage
and those reporting none.

 gas or electric), or other sources (incense, spray “aerosol” products). The burning of wood and
gas emit particulate matter and electric stoves emit fine and ultrafines [58]. Cooking, especially
frying, is a well-known source of particles (e.g., [59–61]) to which the Dylos Air Quality Moni-
tor monitor is very sensitive (see [40]). For our sample, we did not observe an impact of wood
burning, although the sample of those reporting wood burning was very small (n = 9). Partici-
pants reporting any use of gas heating over a week had a somewhat larger sample size (n = 25)
and a larger median particle count of about 500 versus those who did not use gas heating. At
the upper end of the distribution, gas heating could contribute 5,000+ counts (weekly mean)
above homes with no gas heating. Similarly, the distribution from homes that reported incense
use (n = 120) diverged from homes that didn’t (n = 140) at the upper half of the distribution,
with differences of 1000’s of counts (weekly mean). This divergence point at ~2000 counts (the
approximate median of both distributions) may distinguish heavy versus light incense usage in
that the 50% of homes with light incense usage may be more similar to homes with no usage
than the homes with heavy incense usage. For participants who reported burning food at least
once during the week (n = 105), the weekly particle mean at the lower end of the distribution
was on the order of 100 counts greater than those who did not report burning food. This result
is consistent with a small increase in the weekly mean due to, for example, burning toast on 1
or 2 occasions. Frying activity (n = 224) also showed small elevated levels up to 100’s of particle
counts at the lower end of the distribution relative to homes that reported no frying activity

 (n = 38). The use of aerosol products did not seem to affect the distribution, with the small
sample size at the upper tail possibly masking effects of heavy use.
Ventilation activity.
Fig 5 shows empirical particle distributions for whether certain ven-
tilation-related activities occurred on at least one day during the week. From a theoretical per-
spective, based on the mass balance equation cited above, increased ventilation is expected to
decrease particle levels due to natural air exchange with the outdoors or the use of localized
exhaust fans or central air (forced air flow). The use of central air can also serve to spread
tobacco smoke and other air contaminants more quickly throughout a house [53]. However,
we also expect that consistency of coincidence between enhanced ventilation with source activ-
ity and duration of ventilation activity will determine whether protective effects of ventilation
can be observed for weekly mean particle levels in a sample of homes. In our sample, we did
not observe clear-cut effects of any reported ventilation activity. Most of the sample (94% to
95%) reported having windows open (n = 246) and exterior doors open (n = 242) for one or
more days during the week of monitoring. The upper parts of the distribution of weekly parti-
cle mean counts for the very small number of homes that did not have windows open at least
once may have a protective effect, although the sample size is too small to draw generalizable
conclusions. Scenarios where this may occur might be when outdoor pollution is high enough
that keeping windows closed reduces the transfer rate of outdoor pollution entering the home.
The reported use of an air purifier, exhaust fan, or air conditioner fan had no observable effect.

 The distribution of weekly particle means for users of central air (for at least one day) is lower
by up to 100 counts in the middle of the distribution. This effect may be due to the enhanced
air flow, mixing, and dilution of indoor-generated particles. Overall, reported ventilation activ-
ities showed very small effects on weekly population particle counts.
Statistical results
Whereas graphical visualization provides a data overview for observing raw relationships, sam-
ple sizes, and distributional features, model-based analysis offers a way to quantitatively con-
firm and summarize important findings, and to control for the influence of other variables.
Simple regression results are shown in Table 4 in which we identify the variables that we used
in the step-wise model-building procedure. Multivariable linear regression results for the final
model, including all variables identified from model-building, are shown in Table 5.
The statistical results for particle counts with home-size-related variables (Table 5) confirm
our graphical analysis. Each additional exterior door was associated with a 7.7% ([e-0.08–1]�
100) reduction in geometric mean 1-week particle counts (β = -0.08, p = 0.034), after adjusting
for all other correlates. Each additional bathroom was associated with a 22.1% reduction in
geometric mean 1-week particle counts (β = -0.25, p = 0.003). There were no statistically signif-
icant associations between geometric mean particle levels and room volume or number of
rooms after adjustment for all other variables.
Similarly, the modeling results for particle sources agreed broadly with our graphical anal-
ysis. Statistically significant increases in indoor particle counts were observed among homes
that reported indoor cigarette or marijuana smoking, burning incense and/or candles,
frying food in oil, or cleaning the house by vacuuming, dusting or sweeping. Smoking ciga-
rettes indoors (compared to not smoking cigarettes indoors) was associated with a 56.8%
([e0.45–1]�100) increase in geometric mean particle counts (β = 0.45, p < 0.001) while smok-
ing marijuana indoors was associated with a 68.2% increase (β = 0.52, p < 0.001). There were
no statistically significant associations between geometric mean particle levels and burning
food after adjustment for all other variables. Homes that reported cleaning in the last 7 days
had 68.2% higher 1-week geometric mean particle counts than homes that did not report
cleaning (β = 0.52, p < 0.001). Frying with oil was also associated with increased geometric
mean particle levels with any indoor frying being associated with a 31.0% increase in geomet-
ric mean particle levels compared to homes that did not report frying food with oil (β = 0.27,
p = 0.020).
From our tests that explored central air (p = 0.94), air purifier (p = 0.45), exhaust fan in
kitchen (p = 0.13), window fan or window air conditioner (p = 0.10), open a window
(p = 0.11), and open an exterior door (p = 0.96) as effect modifiers of the association between
reported indoor smoking and mean particle levels, none were statistically significant. The rela-
tively small number of homes in subgroup analyses is one possible explanation for the null
results, particularly for tests of using an exhaust fan in kitchen, using a window fan or window
air conditioner, and opening windows.
Additional tests
From our tests that explored ventilation activities as effect modifiers of the association between
reported indoor smoking and mean particle levels, we found that none of the 6 activities
were statistically significant (p’s < 0.05). In another suite of tests comparing homes that were
included in statistical analyses to homes that were omitted due to complete-case-only analysis,
we found no differences for indoor smoking or any other indoor-particle-generating activities
(see S3 Table). We also did not observe statistically significant differences in ventilation

 activities. Small, yet statistically significant, differences were identified in several variables
related to home size, particularly with room volume, the number of levels, rooms, and bed-
rooms, and with the proportion of home types. For all differences, the 69 homes omitted from
the complete cases analysis sample were, on average, larger and had disproportionately higher
“other” home types.

 Discussion
This article explores how indoor air quality is affected by occupant activities and home charac-
teristics for a large number of smoking households with children under 14. From the view-
point of epidemiologists, large samples of participants are desired to draw population-level
conclusions and develop scalable interventions. However, for air-quality-targeted studies
using air monitoring instrumentation, large studies are hindered due to the expense of hard-
ware and quality-assured deployment. This study has made successful use of an inexpensive,
unobtrusive monitor that was deployed for long periods in nearly 300 homes (see Klepeis et al.
2013 [17] for details on the monitoring equipment). Thus, it is possible to report week-long
airborne particle measurements for a large sample that is expected to be representative of at-
risk, low-income families with young children in San Diego and similar metropolitan regions.
This work provides a resource to those who may be undertaking air quality interventions
for tobacco smoke or other pollutant sources. At the confluence of public health, exposure
dynamics, and building science, it contributes new data to inform future air quality interven-
tions about fundamental driving forces for air quality (and particles in particular). This study’s
findings may be used to develop new hypotheses and inform future epidemiological and health
studies in developing effective interventions for indoor air pollution, especially for tobacco-
related risks for children. The results may provide insight and training to those involved in air-
quality interventions, by summarizing influential variables in a large sample of homes. Smok-
ing, whether cigarettes or marijuana, is a major source for this study population, whereas elec-
tronic cigarettes are not. Larger samples of more specialized sources, such as cigars, pipes, and
hookahs, are required to draw conclusions. In keeping with expectations and prior studies,
outdoor smoking is clearly protective in terms of mitigating indoor particle levels and larger
home and room size can be associated with lower levels. In addition, our results indicate that
cooking with oil, independent of whether food is burned, is associated with elevated particle

 counts and that cleaning by vacuuming/dusting/sweeping is also associated with elevated par-
ticle counts.
Relationships between air quality indicators (like airborne particles) and physical character-
istics of homes or occupant behaviors are vital, but knowledge on the intensity of emissions
and exposures is also important in providing feedback to intervention participants and broadly
gauging the seriousness of health risk. The Dylos monitor and other real-time particle moni-
tors are not best-suited for estimating absolute mass particle concentration due to differential
sensitivity of the monitor to source types and removal rates [40,61]. While mass levels are typi-
cally assessed using a “gold standard” filter-and-pump approach, the Dylos may still be used as
an approximate indication of the magnitude of indoor levels and occupants exposures. For
example, weekly mean particle counts for our sample ranged from 556 to 28,400 counts per
0.01 cubic feet (particles 0.5 to 2.5 microns in diameter). For fresh cigarette smoking emis-
sions, incense, and some types of cooking, Dacunto et al. (2015) reported mean count-to-mass
conversion factors of roughly 0.02 to 0.03, giving weekly mean concentrations for our sample
that range from a low of 11 to 16 micrograms per meter cubed (μg/m3) to a high of 568 to
852 μg/m3 [40]. Note that the assumption of fresh emissions may overestimate the peak mass
levels for homes with source emissions that may take hours to decay to background levels (e.g.,
see reported experiment by Ott et al. 2003 [16]). However, it is clear that indoor sources such
as cigarettes, marijuana, and incense are associated with substantially-elevated particle levels
that may pose a risk to health, and Dylos measurements can be used as reliable feedback to
intervention participants to indicate particles rising to concerning levels. Low ambient-level
particles are in the range of 10 μg/m3, which corresponds roughly to Dylos particle counts of
300 to 500. The 24-hour U.S.EPA standard for fine particles is only 35 μg/m3. In addition, the
mean cigarette-long levels observed in moving cars, with the AC on, can exceed 400 μg/m3
[62] and mean levels in smoky areas of casinos have been reported at 63 μg/m3 [63]. These ref-
erence levels, and similar ones for other sources, may give intervention participants a sense for
how high the particle levels may be in their home.
Future studies should examine marijuana use and its impact on indoor air quality in low-
income homes with smokers, and consider this source explicitly in air-quality or environmen-
tal interventions. One of our central and new findings based on modeling and graphical plots
is that marijuana use is associated with significantly higher particle counts for both indoor cig-
arette smokers and outdoor cigarette smokers even after accounting for home characteristics,
other particle generating behaviors, and ventilation activities. Marijuana was the most com-
monly-used illicit drug among people aged 12 and older in 2013 and use is on the rise from
5.8% in 2002 to 7.5% in 2013 (SAMHSA, 2014). In the U.S., reported unintentional marijuana
exposure to children aged 9 years and under to the poison control center increased by 30%
from 2005 to 2011 partially due to legalization of marijuana use for medical and recreational
purposes. California, where medical marijuana use is legal, has the fifth highest reported expo-
sure (4.9 per 100,000) in the U.S. [64]. Symptoms of ingestion or passive inhalation exposure
among children under 5 years of age include lethargy, bradycardia, somnolence, and sleepiness
[65]. Recently, Wang et al. (2016) found that brief exposures to secondhand marijuana smoke
impaired vascular endothelial function in rats, suggesting that secondhand marijuana smoke
may have cardiotoxic effects similar to those from secondhand tobacco smoke [66].
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. The size of home was determined by proxy measurements
(number of rooms, doors, etc.) rather than direct measurement. Our measurements of ventila-
tion and source activity were determined from broad interview questions, rather than more

 detailed time-activity or other objective measures, which may have limited our ability to see
effects. The efficiency of specific ventilation measures in a home and the coupling of ventila-
tion activity with specific sources are expected to be important factors. Data on indoor versus
outdoor smoking behavior was based on report at an initial interview rather than direct obser-
vation by trained observers or sensor objective measures. Specific data on the number of daily
cigarettes and the duration of smoking were not gathered. The reporting of indoor smoking
and other sensitive information such as marijuana use and other drug use may be underre-
ported due to social-desirability bias and other biases. For a subset of homes in this study, we
did not have authorization to ask questions about marijuana and other illicit drug use, and
therefore those homes were omitted from statistical model building, but included in graphical
analyses. We studied a base sample of 262 homes that excluded the first 36 pilot homes and
was further constrained for certain analysis due to missing data on some variables. Despite
these potential biases, we observed important effects of cigarette and marijuana use on particle
counts. Under-reporting marijuana smoking and indoor cigarette smoking would likely atten-
uate effect sizes, indicating that our results are probably underestimates. In addition, the prox-
imity of sources to the Dylos monitor was not recorded and could have impacted the weekly
mean particle counts. More proximate sources could have resulted in higher counts relative to
a “well-mixed” emissions condition.
Conclusions
Our results confirm the importance of smoking, cooking, and cleaning in the elevation of
indoor particle levels, as reported by other investigators. We report new findings that mari-
juana may lead to as comparatively large an increase in weekly particle levels as cigarettes
and deserves focused future study. Smokers who do not smoke indoors demonstrated better
indoor air quality relative to homes where smoking occurs indoors, a finding that is consistent
with engineering principles but also manifests in population-level data. Broadly-assessed venti-
lation activities did not appear to have a mitigating effect on indoor air particles. Our study
illustrates how inexpensive air quality instrumentation can be successfully deployed in large
samples for epidemiological and behavioral studies. Future studies of air quality in at-risk pop-
ulations may use our results to better focus interventions, to consider which key influential
variables to include on interviews and questionnaires, and to design sampling procedures to
include sub-groups of interest.
