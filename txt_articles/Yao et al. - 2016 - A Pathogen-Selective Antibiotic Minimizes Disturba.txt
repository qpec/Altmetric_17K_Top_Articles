Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy decimates the gut microbiome, resulting in a variety of negative health consequences. Debio
1452 is a staphylococcus-selective enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) inhibitor under clinical development and was used
to determine whether treatment with pathogen-selective antibiotics would minimize disturbance to the microbiome. The effect
of oral Debio 1452 on the microbiota of mice was compared to the effects of four commonly used broad-spectrum oral antibiot-
ics. During the 10 days of oral Debio 1452 treatment, there was minimal disturbance to the gut bacterial abundance and compo-
sition, with only the unclassified S24-7 taxon reduced at days 6 and 10. In comparison, broad-spectrum oral antibiotics caused
�100- to 4,000-fold decreases in gut bacterial abundance and severely altered the microbial composition. The gut bacterial
abundance and composition of Debio 1452-treated mice were indistinguishable from those of untreated mice 2 days after the
antibiotic treatment was stopped. In contrast, the bacterial abundance in broad-spectrum-antibiotic-treated mice took up to 7
days to recover, and the gut composition of the broad-spectrum-antibiotic-treated mice remained different from that of the con-
trol group 20 days after the cessation of antibiotic treatment. These results illustrate that a pathogen-selective approach to anti-
biotic development will minimize disturbance to the gut microbiome.
T
he discovery and commercialization of broad-spectrum anti-
biotics is one of the most significant medical achievements in
the first half of the 20th century. However, the use of broad-spec-
trum antibiotics is linked to a variety of medical problems, such as
antibiotic-treatment-associated infections first recognized in the
1950s (1, 2). Broad-spectrum-antibiotic therapy is known to dev-
astate the gut microbiome, and the repeated use of these antibiot-
ics during early childhood is linked to metabolic and autoimmune
diseases later in life (3–10). Therefore, one challenge for future
antibacterial therapeutic development is to design drugs that min-
imize disturbances to the microbiome.
One approach to minimize disturbance to the microbiome is
to use narrow-spectrum, pathogen-selective antibiotics. In prin-
ciple, antibiotics optimized to target a single pathogen would not
impact the beneficial inhabitants of the gut. There are two ways to
achieve pathogen selectivity. First, design an inhibitor against an
enzyme or process that is only found in the targeted pathogen.
This approach has the challenge of identifying a novel, essential
target in each pathogen. A second approach circumvents this issue
and utilizes structure-based design to build high-affinity inhibi-
tors that are optimized against the specific version of a drug target
expressed in the pathogen. One antimicrobial target that has been
exploited for the development of a pathogen-selective inhibitor is
enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (FabI) (11–16). Debio
1452, previously known as AFN-1252 (Fig. 1), is an example of a
FabI inhibitor with the properties of a pathogen-selective antibi-
otic based on both target distribution and isozyme selectivity (17).
Debio 1452 is specifically designed to target staphylococcal FabI, a
key component of bacterial fatty acid synthesis (18–20). FabI is
essential in Staphylococcus species (11) but is not found in many
other groups of bacteria. Specifically, members of the order Clos-
tridiales are abundant residents of the gut, and free-living mem-
bers of this group do not encode a FabI but, rather, utilize an
unrelated enoyl-ACP reductase called FabK (21, 22). Debio 1452
is also highly selective for staphylococcal FabI compared to the
essential FabIs expressed in other bacteria, due to a specific drug
interaction with an active-site methionine that is unique to staph-
ylococcal FabI (12, 23). Consequently, Debio 1452 has potent ac-
tivity against Staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcal spp.,
including multidrug-resistant isolates, but does not inhibit the
growth of bacteria of many other Gram-positive or Gram-nega-
tive genera (24). These considerations suggest that Debio 1452
therapy may have minimal impact on the gut microbiome. How-
ever, experimental validation of this idea is essential because most
of the gut inhabitants are known only from their 16S rRNA gene
sequences, and whether or not they express an essential FabI with
an S. aureus-like active site is unknown. In this study, we examined
the effect of therapeutic doses of Debio 1452 on the gut micro-
biome of mice in comparison to the effects of a panel of broad-
spectrum antibiotics. As anticipated (2, 25, 26), the broad-spec-
trum agents devastated the gut microbiome. However, Debio
1452 treatment caused minimal effects on both the bacterial abun-
dance and the composition of the gut microbiome, illustrating
that pathogen-selective antibiotics can be developed to minimize
disturbances to the microbiome.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mouse husbandry. Animal experiments were approved by the St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee (protocol 538). Mice were housed in the St. Jude Children’s Re-
search Hospital Animal Research Center at 22 � 2°C, 50% � 10% humid-
ity, and a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle. The animals were fed Purina Diet 5
chow. Six-week-old female C57-BL6 mice were ordered from Jackson
Laboratory. The mice were handled, received abdominal massage, and
were mock gavaged twice weekly during the acclimation period. Stool
samples were collected from each mouse via abdominal massage before
antibiotic treatment started, daily during a 10-day antibiotic treatment,
and on days 12, 17, 23, 30, and 37 during the postantibiotic recovery. Stool
samples were stored at �80°C until extraction. Antibiotics were pur-
chased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, except for Debio 1452, which was
provided by Debiopharm International SA. The antibiotic stock solutions
were formulated in 1% Pluronic F-127 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 29.4 mg/ml for
Debio 1452 tosylate monohydrate salt, 40 mg/ml for linezolid, 40 mg/ml
for clindamycin, 13 mg/ml for moxifloxacin, and 48 mg/ml for amoxicil-
lin. Antibiotic treatments were given once daily via oral gavage with the
stock antibiotic during the antibiotic treatment phase. The dose levels of
broad-spectrum antibiotics were based on the conversion of the human
doses to body surface area (27) and were as follows: linezolid, 200 mg/kg
of body weight; clindamycin, 200 mg/kg; moxifloxacin, 65 mg/kg; and
amoxicillin, 240 mg/kg. The Debio 1452 dosage of 100 mg/kg was based
on previous mouse studies (28). The drug carrier only (1% Pluronic
F-127) was given to the control group.
DNA extraction. Total DNA was extracted from 50 to 200 mg of stool
sample using the QIAamp fast DNA stool minikit. InhibitEX buffer (1 ml)
was added to the stool sample in an MP FastPrep tube. The tube was
heated at 70°C for 10 min, and then the mixture was homogenized via
shaking in the MP FastPrep-24 machine (4.0 m/s for 20 s 3 times). The
tube was heated at 70°C for 10 more minutes and centrifuged to pellet
stool particles. The rest of the extraction process followed the manufac-
turer’s protocols. Stool samples from days �1, 2, 6, 10, 12, 17, 23, 30, and
37 were extracted for DNA and analyzed.
16S rRNA gene abundance determination. Real-time PCR using Ap-
plied Biosystems SYBR green PCR master mix in the Applied Biosystems
7500 real-time PCR system was used to determine the relative abundances
of 16S rRNA genes in extracted DNA samples. A 20-�l reaction mixture
composed of 10 �l 2� SYBR green PCR master mix, 150 nM each forward
and reverse DNA primers, and 5 �l of different concentrations of ex-
tracted DNA was amplified for 40 cycles. The 16S PCR primers were
5=-TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT and 5=-GGACTACCAGGGTATCTA
ATCCTGTT (29). A serial dilution of DNA extracted from the stool of
mice before antibiotic treatment was tested to determine the DNA dilu-
tion that gave the best dynamic range (cycle threshold values between 15
and 20). A 1-to-2,000 dilution of the extracted DNA was determined to
give the best dynamic range for 16S rRNA gene detection and used to
determine the cycle threshold for each of the samples. The resulting data
were plotted in log2 scale as the relative abundance for each mouse in each
treatment group.
The abundance of the mouse tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-�)
gene (primers 5=-GGCTTTCCGAATTCACTGGAG and 5=-CCCCGGCC
TTCCAAATAAA) was also measured in the samples by real-time PCR as
a control to monitor the efficiency of the extraction (30). A 1-to-10 dilu-
tion of the extracted DNA was used to determine the cycle threshold for
each sample. The cycle threshold values for the TNF-� had a bell-shaped
distribution with a mean of 30.14, median of 29.96, and range of 24 to 36.
This normal distribution was reflected by a similar efficiency of DNA
extraction across the samples.
16S rRNA gene sequencing. The V1-to-V3 (V1-V3) region 16S rRNA
gene amplicon library was generated via PCR using the NEXTflex 16S
V1-V3 amplicon-seq kit (Bioo Scientific), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The DNA from the PCR was cleaned using the Ampure XP
PCR purification kit (Beckman Coulter). The PCR products were quan-
tified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen assay (Illumina) and normalized by
DNA concentration for sequencing. The samples were analyzed via
paired-end sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform, following the
manufacturer’s protocols. The broad-spectrum-antibiotic treatments
caused severe reductions in the numbers of read counts obtained from
next-generation sequencing, corresponding to the reductions in 16S
rRNA gene abundance. These samples were analyzed using the same
methodology, because the reductions of counts represented real changes
in the gut microbiome composition. The sequencing read counts were
100-fold lower than the mean for the respective cohort for Debio 1452
treatment mouse 5 on day 6, clindamycin treatment mouse 3 on day 2,
and moxifloxacin treatment mouse 5 on day 37. These samples were con-
sidered sequencing failures and excluded from the analysis.
Taxon assignments. The 16S primers targeting the V1-V3 regions
were aligned to the full set of 16S rRNA gene sequences from the Green-
genes database version 13.5 (31) using exonerate (32). Each 16S rRNA
gene database sequence was truncated to include only the V1-V3 region,
the primer-matching regions, and an additional 40 bases on either side.
Duplicate V1-V3 regions were removed from the data set to create a
unique V1-V3 representative reference set. All taxon labels from the du-
plicates that were removed were associated with the matching remaining
representative sequences. Reads from each sample were aligned exhaus-
tively to the nonredundant V1-V3 reference set using USEARCH (33),
allowing a minimum sequence identity of 97%. All taxon labels associated
with all top-scoring sequences were used to determine the taxon assign-
ment of each read. The highest-resolution nonconflicting taxon of all taxa
associated with the top-scoring V1-V3 region(s) was assigned as the taxon
for a read.
Composition analysis. The phylogenetic composition was analyzed
in R version 3.1.1 using the package phyloseq version 1.8.2 (34). The taxa
assigned for each sample were tabulated and converted to the percentage
of the composition for each taxon. The tabulated count number data for
each sample are organized by experiment day and treatment group and
are included in Dataset S1 in the supplemental material. The resulting
tables for all samples were converted into a phyloseq class. Distance plots
for the samples were generated using the ordinate function with multidi-
mensional scaling (“MDS”) as the method choice and betadiversity mea-
sure 1 (“w”) as the distance choice. The resulting principal components 1
and 2 were plotted as 2-dimensional distance plots grouped by treatment
day. Bar charts were generated showing the family-level taxon composi-
tion for each treatment group for each treatment day by averaging the
percent composition of the different samples in each treatment group.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Gut bacterial abundance and composition. Groups of 5 mice
were treated orally with drug carrier only (control), Debio 1452,
linezolid, clindamycin, moxifloxacin, or amoxicillin for 10 days
and then allowed to recover for 27 additional days. Treatment
with Debio 1452, linezolid, moxifloxacin, and amoxicillin were
well tolerated with no notable distress or weight loss. Four mice in
the clindamycin treatment group were distressed during the first 4
days; two recovered, but two mice died on days 4 and 5. Feces from

 the mice were collected 1 day before treatment and over the course
of the experiment, and the total DNA was extracted from the stool
samples (Fig. 2). The relative bacterial abundances were deter-
mined by performing real-time PCR amplifying the 16S rRNA
gene from the total DNA (Fig. 3 and 4). The gut microbiome
composition was determined through next-generation sequenc-
ing of the V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from the total DNA.
The gut microbiome compositions of all the samples were com-
pared using beta-diversity and multidimensional scaling analysis
and plotted as 2-dimensional distance plots of the first two prin-
cipal components (Fig. 3 and 4). In these distance plots, samples
that are clustered together are more similar, while samples that are
more spatially distant are more different. The gut compositions
were also plotted as bar charts at the family taxonomic level (Fig. 5,
6, and 7). Distance plots are used to provide a high level of visual-
ization of the similarities and differences in complex samples,
whereas the bar charts identify the distribution of taxa.
The mice from different treatment groups had similar bacterial
abundances before drug treatment. The samples from the differ-
ent treatment groups obtained prior to treatment clustered closely
together in the distance analysis, showing that the bacterial com-
positions in all the mice were similar before treatment. In terms of
composition, the Rikenellaceae and S24-7 families (both of the
Bacteroidia class) made up approximately 80% of the microbiome
compositionbeforetreatmentinallgroupsandintheuntreatedmice
overthecourseoftheexperiment.TheorderClostridiales, including
Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Dehalobacteriaceae, Clostridi-
aceae, Mogibacteriaceae, and unclassified members, made up 5 to
15% of the microbiome composition. Akkermansia muciniphila of
the Verrucomicrobia phylum averaged 1% of the microbiome com-
position. The RF39, Anaeroplasmataceae, Lactobacillaceae, Tu-
ricibacteraceae, Coriobacteriaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae families
were minor taxa making up 0.01 to 1% of the composition. The
percent composition of individual taxa in the control mice were
observed to vary over the course of the experiment and between
the individual mice, but the overall patterns of the taxa in the gut
of untreated mice were similar over the entire course of the exper-
iment.
Debio1452treatmentcausedminimaldisturbancetothegut
microbiome. Debio 1452 treatment did not cause a significant
change in the bacterial abundance over the course of the 10-day
treatment (Fig. 3) or the subsequent 27-day recovery (Fig. 4). Dis-
tance analysis showed that Debio 1452-treated mice clustered with
the untreated mice over the course of the experiment, consistent
with minimal changes in the composition of the gut microbiome
(Fig. 3 and 4). Only one taxon, the S24-7 family, decreased follow-
ing Debio 1452 treatment. The S24-7 family, which comprised 30
to 50% of the bacteria before treatment, was reduced to an average
of 4% by day 6 and constituted only 0.2% of the bacteria by day 10
(Fig. 5). No other taxa had compositional decreases, and several
taxa, including the Rikenellaceae family, the Clostridiales order,
and A. muciniphila (Verrucomicrobiales order), exhibited com-
pensating compositional increases to maintain the bacterial abun-
dance during the decline in S24-7 (Fig. 5). The drug treatments
were stopped after day 10, and the microbiome composition in the
Debio 1452-treated mice was evaluated on day 12. By day 12, the
S24-7 family had recovered to pretreatment levels in the Debio
1452-treated mice, and the gut composition of Debio 1452-
treated mice was indistinguishable from that of untreated mice
during the entire recovery phase (days 12 to 37), showing that this
FabI inhibitor did not have a lasting effect on the microbiome
(Fig. 4 and 6).
Linezolid, clindamycin, and amoxicillin severely perturbed
the gut microbiome. Linezolid, clindamycin, and amoxicillin
treatment all caused an �4,000-fold decrease in the gut bacterial
abundance at the second day of treatment that persisted until the
end of the treatment (Fig. 3). Distance plot analyses showed that
the bacterial compositions of linezolid-, clindamycin-, and
amoxicillin-treated mice became significantly distant from that of
the control group during therapy, consistent with the microbiome
compositions becoming severely altered (Fig. 3). In each case, the
remaining bacterial taxa were unique to the antibiotic used and
represented those bacteria that survived the antibiotic treatment
(Fig. 5). However, the persistent low bacterial abundance over the
course of treatment means that the remaining bacterial taxa did
not repopulate the gut microbiome (Fig. 3). The major taxon in
amoxicillin-treated mice at days 6 and 10 was the unclassified
order Clostridiales, suggesting that the bacteria from this order are
relatively more resistant to amoxicillin treatment than the other
bacteria in the gut microbiome (Fig. 5). The major taxon in clin-
damycin-treated mice at days 6 and 10 was the Pseudomonadaceae
family, suggesting that bacteria of this family are better equipped
than others to withstand clindamycin treatment (Fig. 5). The ma-
jor taxa in linezolid-treated mice had a distribution similar to that
in the untreated mice, suggesting that linezolid was equally effec-
tive at eliminating all of the significant taxa of the gut microbiome
(Fig. 5).
Although the drug treatments were stopped at day 10, the bac-
terial abundance did not recover until day 17 for the linezolid and
amoxicillin treatment groups and day 23 for the clindamycin
treatment group (Fig. 4). The distance plots show that the bacte-
rial compositions became distally closer to that of the control
group over the recovery phase, but those of the clindamycin and
amoxicillin treatment groups still did not cluster completely with
the control group by day 37 (Fig. 4). For all three treatment
groups, the Enterococcaceae family became a major taxon at day 12
(Fig. 6). On the first day when the bacterial abundance reached
normal levels in each of these cases (Fig. 4), the S24-7 family be-
came the major compositional component of the gut microbiome,
making up 80 to 90% of the composition (Fig. 6). These data
illustrate that the S24-7 family was the first normally observed
taxon to recover in the gut microbiome following broad-spec-
trum antibiotic therapy in mice. By day 37, the major taxa had
recovered to normal levels in all three cases. However, the mi-

 nor taxa were still significantly different from those of the un-
treated mice in the clindamycin and amoxicillin treatment
groups (Fig. 4, 6, and 7).
Moxifloxacin-specific microbiome alterations. Of the broad-
spectrum antibiotics tested, moxifloxacin treatment caused the
least reduction in the abundance of bacteria in the gut micro-
biome (Fig. 3). Gut bacterial abundance was still significantly
reduced, but only 16- to 100-fold over the course of the moxi-
floxacin treatment, compared to �4,000-fold by the other broad-
spectrum antibiotics. Distance plot analysis showed that the mi-
crobiome composition in the moxifloxacin-treated mice became
significantly distinct from that of the control group (Fig. 5). The
percent composition of A. muciniphila increased over the course
of the moxifloxacin treatment from 0.5% to 2% before treatment

 to 30% during day 2, 40% at day 6, and 50% at day 10 of treatment.
The 100-fold increase in A. muciniphila at day 10 of moxifloxacin
therapy was not due to an increase in this species but was rather
due to the 100-fold decrease in the other species. The normal taxa
constituted the other 50% of the microbiome composition at day
10, showing that moxifloxacin did not reduce the normal gut in-
habitants as much as the other broad-spectrum antibiotics tested.
The gut bacterial abundance of moxifloxacin-treated mice recov-
ered 2 days after the treatment stopped, faster than for the other
broad-spectrum antibiotics tested (Fig. 4). The pattern of compo-
sitional recovery was similar to the patterns in mice treated with
other broad-spectrum antibiotics, with S24-7 recovering first, the
other major taxa returning to normal by day 30, and the minor
taxa remaining unstable and continuing to fluctuate at day 37.
Pathogen-selective antibiotic strategy minimizes distur-
bances to the microbiome. One of the challenges of microbiome
studies is applying mouse results to humans. The drug dosages
used in this study were based on the equivalent surface area dosage
conversion method to achieve similar plasma levels of drugs (27).

the drug in the mouse gut was higher than would be found in the
human gut, facilitating a rigorous test of Debio 1452 and the
pathogen-selective approach for antibiotic discovery. The mini-
mal perturbation of the gut microbiome by Debio 1452 therapy
illustrates that a pathogen-selective antibiotic strategy is an effec-
tive approach to minimize disturbance to the gut microbiome.
Debio 1452 derives its pathogen selectivity by targeting an enzyme
that is either absent or nonessential in many important residents
of the gut and by targeting the staphylococcal FabI selectively over

reduced by Debio 1452 was the S24-7 family, which was replaced
by an increase in the remaining taxa. As reported previously (2, 25,

 days to recover. Developing therapeutic strategies that minimize
disturbances to the beneficial microbiome bacteria will become a
more important criterion in antibiotic drug design in light of the
emerging understanding of how the gut microbiome supports
health by facilitating digestion, shielding us from invading micro-
organisms, and providing vitamins (3).
The principle inhabitants of the gut microbiome can bypass
FabI inhibition. The results of this study provide insight into the
bacterial microbiome taxa that encode an essential FabI. The es-
sentiality of FabI and de novo fatty acid synthesis is well character-
ized in a variety of human pathogens (11, 35, 36) but is largely
unknown for the bacterial constituents of the gut microbiome.
Known members of the Clostridiales order encode a FabK rather
than a FabI (21, 22), and our results support the prediction that
the Clostridiales in the gut are unaffected by FabI inhibition. It is
more difficult to predict the behavior of the Bacteroidia class of
organisms because FabI and FabK are both found in organisms
belonging to this class. Based on sequenced genomes of family
members (NCBI Microbial Genomes Resources), members of the
Prevotellaceae family encode only a FabI, members of the Porphy-
romonadaceae family encode only a FabK (37), and the Bacte-
roidaceae and Rikenellaceae families encode both FabI and FabK.
The observation that Debio 1452 does not reduce the abundance
of the Rikenellaceae family, whose members are predicted to en-
code both FabI and FabK, indicates that the FabK enoyl-ACP re-
ductase compensates for a Debio 1452-inactivated FabI. Alter-
nately, Debio 1452 may be a poor inhibitor of Rikenellaceae FabI
or this family may have a pathway to bypass fatty acid synthesis by
obtaining fatty acids from the gut. The major impact of Debio
1452 therapy was the slow disappearance of the unclassified S24-7
family of the class Bacteroidia. This family was replaced by the
expansion of the Clostridiales, but S24-7 returned to normal levels
on day 2 following the cessation of treatment. These data suggest
that the S24-7 family has an essential FabI that is not potently
inhibited by Debio 1452. Genomic data are unavailable for the
S24-7 family, but the weak sensitivity to Debio 1452 may indicate
that some Bacteroidia families may be affected by FabI inhibitors.
S24-7 is not a component of the human gut. Instead, the major
Bacteroidia species of the human microbiome belong to the Pre-
votellaceae and Bacteroidaceae families. Whether the Prevotellaceae
have a FabI that is sensitive to Debio 1452 remains to be estab-
lished. A. muciniphila of the Verrucomicrobia phylum is a minor
but key component of the human gut microbiome (38). A. muci-
niphila is predicted to possess a FabI with high homology to the S.
aureus FabI (WP_012420677.1, E value of 2e�71) and does not
harbor any known alternative enoyl-ACP reductases. However,
the abundance of A. muciniphila was not reduced by Debio 1452
therapy, suggesting that this organism has mechanisms to prevent
the intracellular accumulation of Debio 1452, expresses an un-

bottom plot shows the distribution of low-abundance taxa at day 37 posttherapy. Some sequences could not be assigned at the family level and were assigned at
the order level. These taxa are denoted with square brackets around the assignment (e.g., [Clostridiales]).

 thesis inhibition by incorporating gut fatty acids derived from the
diet. The rare taxa of the gut microbiome, such as the Fusobacteria,
Actinobacteria, and Mollicutes, did not occur with sufficient fre-
quency to draw conclusions regarding their FabI status. Under-
standing fatty acid metabolism in the gut bacteria would advance
our knowledge of how FabI therapeutics, and fatty acid synthesis
inhibitors in general, may impact the microbiome.
