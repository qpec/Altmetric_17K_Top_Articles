Abstract: Advancing age can be associated with an increase in cognitive dysfunction, a spectrum
of disability that ranges in severity from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Folate and the
other B-vitamins involved in one-carbon metabolism are associated with cognition in ageing but the
evidence is not entirely clear. The hypothesis addressed in this study was that lower dietary intake
or biomarker status of folate and/or the metabolically related B-vitamins would be associated with
a greater than expected rate of cognitive decline over a 4-year follow-up period in healthy older
adults. Participants (aged 60–88 years; n = 155) who had been previously screened for cognitive
function were reassessed four years after initial investigation using the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE). At the 4-year follow-up assessment when participants were aged 73.4 ± 7.1 years, mean
cognitive MMSE scores had declined from 29.1 ± 1.3 at baseline to 27.5 ± 2.4 (p < 0.001), but
some 27% of participants showed a greater than expected rate of cognitive decline (i.e., decrease in
MMSE > 0.56 points per year). Lower vitamin B6 status, as measured using pyridoxal-5-phosphate
(PLP; <43 nmol/L) was associated with a 3.5 times higher risk of accelerated cognitive decline, after
adjustment for age and baseline MMSE score (OR, 3.48; 95% CI, 1.58 to 7.63; p < 0.05). Correspondingly,
lower dietary intake (0.9–1.4 mg/day) of vitamin B6 was also associated with a greater rate of
cognitive decline (OR, 4.22; 95% CI, 1.28–13.90; p < 0.05). No significant relationships of dietary intake
or biomarker status with cognitive decline were observed for the other B-vitamins. In conclusion,
lower dietary and biomarker status of vitamin B6 at baseline predicted a greater than expected rate
of cognitive decline over a 4-year period in healthy older adults. Vitamin B6 may be an important
protective factor in helping maintain cognitive health in ageing.

1. Introduction
Advancing age can be associated with an increase in cognitive dysfunction, a spectrum of disability
that ranges in severity from normal age-related changes through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to
dementia; with the latter defined as a progressive decline in memory, thinking, language and judgment
that is sufficient to impair activities of daily living [1]. An estimated 50% of those diagnosed with
MCI will go onto develop dementia within 5 years of diagnosis [2]. Globally, it is estimated that
48 million people are currently suffering from dementia and the figures are predicted to triple by

2050 [3]. Dementia is a leading cause of disability, dependency and decreased quality of life among
older people [3] and presents many social, economic and health care challenges that will continue to
increase with an ageing population. Therefore, the identification of strategies to prevent or delay the
onset of dementia has become a major global public health priority.
A number of nutritional and lifestyle factors have emerged as potential modifiable risk factors
for cognitive decline in ageing [4]. In particular, there is considerable epidemiological evidence to
suggest that sub-optimal status of folate, the related B-vitamins, and/or elevated concentrations of the
metabolite homocysteine, contribute to cognitive dysfunction [5–10] and to a greater rate of cognitive
decline in ageing [11–14]. Elevated plasma homocysteine and lower folate have been most consistently
associated with cognitive dysfunction in ageing [6,8]. There is also evidence to support a role for
vitamin B12 [15,16] and to a lesser extent vitamin B6, although the latter has been far less extensively
investigated [9,17]. There is also some evidence in the form of randomised controlled trials to show
beneficial effects of B-vitamin supplementation on cognition in ageing [18–20]. A number of other
trials have failed to detect significant benefits [21–23] with recent meta-analyses concluding that there
was no beneficial effect of B-vitamin supplementation on cognition [24,25]. However, a number of
these trials may have been too short in duration; conducted in healthy individuals, patients with
severe dementia; or in those with optimal B-vitamin status and so unlikely to benefit from vitamin
supplementation [26]. The strongest evidence to date of a causal relationship between B-vitamins and
cognition comes from the Homocysteine and B-vitamin in Cognitive Impairment (VITACOG) study.
This study showed that combined B-vitamin supplementation for two years had beneficial effects on
cognitive performance in participants with MCI and elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations [20].
More importantly, it also demonstrated that B-vitamin supplementation reduced the rate of brain
atrophy by 30% as measured using MRI [27]. A subsequent report from the VITACOG investigators
reported that the atrophy occurred in grey matter areas of the brain which are particularly vulnerable
to Alzheimer’s disease [28].
The intervention doses administered in VITACOG were well in excess of recommended dietary
intakes and therefore whilst the VITACOG papers provide powerful evidence of a role for folate,
vitamin B12, and/or vitamin B6 in cognition, the relevance of these results to nutrition, and thus
prevention of cognitive dysfunction in ageing is unclear. Furthermore, epidemiological research
generally in this area has predominantly focused on plasma homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12;
most studies have overlooked vitamin B6 and all have ignored the role of vitamin B2. Consequently,
the influence of all the relevant B-vitamins involved in one-carbon metabolism on cognition is not
fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether lower dietary intake or
biomarker status of B-vitamins (folate, vitamin B12, vitamin B6 or riboflavin) at baseline was associated
with a greater rate of cognitive decline over a 4-year follow-up period in healthy older adults.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participant Recruitment and Study Design
Potential participants were identified from our records of a previous cross sectional study
funded by the UK Food Standards Agency investigating B-vitamin dietary intakes and biomarker
status in the healthy younger and older adults in Northern Ireland as previously described [29].
Healthy participants (n = 662; aged ≥18 years) were recruited to the original study and as part of
the protocol, those aged ≥60 years completed a cognitive function test (Folstein’s Mini Mental State
Examination MMSE; [30], the purpose of the original assessment was to ensure that the ability of
participants to accurately recall food intake was not compromised. The current study involved the
re-examination (4 years after initial screening) of those aged ≥60 years (n = 255). The exclusion criteria
for the original study were: those with vitamin B12 deficiency (serum vitamin B12 < 111 pmol/L);
self-reported history of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, or haematological disease; use
of medications that interfere with B-vitamin metabolism; taking supplements containing B-vitamins;

having visited a country with a mandatory fortification policy for a period ≥2 weeks in the previous
6 months; plasma creatinine concentrations >130 µmol/L (generally indicative of renal impairment);
and a score of <25 on the MMSE (indicative of cognitive impairment). Ethical approval was granted by
the University of Ulster Research Ethics Committee (UUREC; Ref UUREC/07/005) and all participants
provided written informed consent.
2.2. Cognitive Assessment
Cognitive function was assessed at baseline and at follow-up (between 3.5 to 4 years from initial
screening for each participant) using the MMSE [30], one of the most widely used cognitive screening
tools in a clinical setting. It is a global test of cognitive function and assesses the domains of orientation,
registration, attention and concentration, recall and language. Overall the maximum score achievable
is 30, with a score <25 indicating a possibility of cognitive impairment and a score <20 dementia [30].
2.3. Dietary and Lifestyle Assessment
Dietary intake was assessed using a 4-day food diary (for 4 consecutive days, including Saturday
and Sunday, to account for the known variation in day-to-day intake) in combination with a food
frequency questionnaire. This combined dietary method as described previously has been validated at
this centre for the assessment of the four relevant B-vitamins against each of their blood biomarkers [29].
The food frequency questionnaire requested participants to state the frequency of consumption for food
groups or specific branded products fortified with B-vitamins (e.g., ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, bars,
breads and margarines). Participants provided details on brand names of the products consumed so
that the fortification profile of any new foods could be established. By combining the 2 dietary collection
methods, we were able to estimate dietary intakes of the relevant B-vitamins from both natural food
sources and from fortified foods. Each participant received oral and written instructions on how to
complete the food diary and food-frequency questionnaire. Any queries or discrepancies between the
2 dietary records were discussed with the participant and were clarified within 1 week of collection
to enhance the accuracy of information on usual food intakes. Food portion sizes were estimated
by the participant by using household measures and were later quantified by using published food
portion size data [31]. The food-composition database WEIGHED INTAKE SOFTWARE PACKAGE
(WISP, version 3; Tinuviel Software, Anglesey, UK) was used to calculate mean daily energy and
B-vitamin intakes. This database has been customised at our centre to enable natural food folate to
be distinguished from folic acid added to foods by manufacturers, and this allows the estimation of
dietary folate equivalents (DFE; [29]).
A health and lifestyle questionnaire was used to obtain information on medical history including
depression, smoking, use of alcohol and medication, and educational attainment. Height (m) and
weight (kg) were measured at baseline and body mass index (kg/m2) was calculated.
2.4. Laboratory Analysis
All participants provided a fasting 30 mL blood sample at baseline. Sample preparation and
fractionation were performed within 4 h of blood collection, and blood aliquots were stored at −80 ◦C
until batch analysis. Plasma homocysteine was measured by fluorescence polarization immunoassay
using the Abbot Imx analyser [32]. Red blood cell folate was measured by microbiological assay using
Lactobacillus casei [33]. Vitamin B12 status was determined using a number of biomarkers; the direct
measures were serum total vitamin B12 by microbiological assay using Lactobacillus leichmanni [34]
and serum holoTC (the metabolically active fraction of vitamin B12) by microparticle enzyme
immunoassay (AxSym Active-B12; Axis-Shield, Heidelberg, Germany); the functional biomarker serum
methylmalonic acid (MMA) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry using methylchloroformate
derivatization at University of Bergen, Norway. Plasma vitamin B6 (PLP) was measured by reversed
phase, high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection [35]. Riboflavin status
was assessed using the erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation (EGRAC) where the ratio of
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 53

FAD stimulated to unstimulated enzyme activity is calculated; higher EGRAC values indicate lower
riboflavin status, and sub-optimal riboflavin status is generally recognised as a coefficient ≥1.3 [36].
The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C→T polymorphism was identified by
polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by HinF1 restriction digestion [37]. Plasma creatinine
was measured using a standard spectrophotometric assay with use of a chemistry analyzer (Hitachi;
Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Additionally, pepsinogen I and pepsinogen II
were measured as markers of gastric atrophy by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Biohit, Helsinki,
Finland); a ratio of pepsinogen I:II < 3 is indicative of atrophic gastritis. All samples were analysed
blind and duplicated. Quality controls were provided by repeated analysis of pooled samples.
2.5. Statistical Analysis
All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 22; SPSS UK Ltd., Chersey, UK).
Prior to analysis, tests for normality were conducted and data were log transformed where appropriate.
Differences at baseline and follow-up were assessed using a paired t-test for continuous data and
chi-squared test for categorical data. Correlations between dietary intakes and corresponding blood
biomarkers were calculated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r). Annual cognitive decline was
calculated (baseline MMSE−follow-up MMSE)/(duration of follow-up) on an individual basis for
each participant, accelerated cognitive decline was defined as a decrease in MMSE > 0.56 points per
year [38]. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess health and lifestyle predictors of
cognitive decline. The impact of B-vitamin dietary intake and blood biomarker status as predictors
of cognitive decline was assessed using binary logistic regression after controlling for significant
predictors of cognitive decline (age and baseline MMSE).
3. Results
Of the 662 healthy volunteers, 255 ≥ 60 years were identified as potential participants and of these
155 were available to participate in the follow-up assessment (Figure 1). Only those that participated
at both timepoints are presented in this paper; those lost to follow-up were older and had significantly
lower vitamin B12 status (Appendix A).
The characteristics of participants at initial screening are shown in Table 1. Participants had
a mean age of 70 years, were predominantly female, well-educated and had a low rate of depression.
The majority of participants were regular consumers of foods fortified with B-vitamins (75%).
Dietary intakes compared favourably with current UK dietary recommendations [39] as reflected
in good overall B-vitamin biomarker status. As a result of the exclusion criteria, no participant was
deficient in vitamin B12, however some 3% were identified as deficient in folate and 11% deficient in
vitamin B6. Gastric function was assessed by using pepsinogen I:II ratio, 12% had evidence of atrophic
gastritis (pepsinogen I:II ratio < 3; data not shown).

the mean MMSE by almost 2 points was observed; the scores for each component of the MMSE (i.e., 
orientation, attention, recall, total verbal and language) also declined significantly, with the exception 
of registration. Whilst all participants had a MMSE score within the normal range at baseline (i.e., 
according to the inclusion criteria), 12% had a score indicative of mild cognitive impairment (MMSE 
range 18–24) at the time of follow‐up. Overall, the average decrease in MMSE score per year was  
0.42 ± 0.56; but some participants 42 (27%) had a greater than expected rate of cognitive decline (i.e., 
decrease in MMSE score > 0.56 points per year; [38].

The influence of several lifestyle factors, B-vitamin dietary intake and B-vitamin biomarker status,
as determinants of rate of cognitive decline are shown in Table 3. Of the general health and lifestyle
factors examined only age and baseline MMSE score were predictive of cognitive decline. In addition,
after adjustment for age and baseline MMSE score, no associations were observed between disease
history (CVD, diabetes and gastrointestinal; data not shown) or medication use with the exception
of use of analgesic medication (p = 0.035; data not shown). Vitamin B6 was found to be the only
B-vitamin that was predictive of cognitive decline. After adjustment for age and baseline MMSE score,
individuals with lower vitamin B6 biomarker status (PLP range ≤ 43.3 nmol/L; p = 0.002) or lower
dietary B6 intakes (0.9–1.4 mg/day; p = 0.018) were at a 3.5–4 fold greater risk of cognitive decline.
None of the other B vitamins or plasma homocysteine concentrations were associated with the risk of
cognitive decline in this cohort.

4. Discussion
This study in healthy older adults, initially with normal cognitive performance, indicates that
vitamin B6 is an important predictor of cognitive decline in ageing. Lower dietary intake and biomarker
status of vitamin B6 were associated with a greater rate of cognitive decline over a subsequent 4 years
follow-up period. No significant association of dietary intake or biomarker status with cognitive
decline were observed for the other B-vitamins (folate, vitamin B12 and riboflavin). To our knowledge,
this is the first longitudinal study to consider the impact of both dietary intake and biomarker status of
all four relevant B-vitamins involved in one-carbon metabolism on cognitive health in ageing.

Whilst the influence of vitamin B6 on cognition has not been as fully investigated as folate
and vitamin B12 a number of studies have reported observations consistent with the current study.
Our results showed that participants with lower status of vitamin B6 (PLP; the measure of active
vitamin B6) at baseline were 3.5 times more likely to have a greater rate of cognitive decline over a
4 years follow-up period. Furthermore, the association between vitamin B6 and cognitive decline was
not confined to those with clinical deficiency, lower status included individuals in both the deficient
(PLP < 30 nmol/L) and sufficient range (PLP 30–43 nmol/L) which would suggest that optimal vitamin
B6 may be important for cognitive health in ageing. Consistent with the biomarker data, those with
lower dietary intakes of vitamin B6 at baseline were 4 times more likely to have a greater rate of
cognitive decline over the 4 years time period. Our results are in good agreement with findings from
other studies, low vitamin B6 status (PLP < 46 nmol/L) and corresponding dietary intakes were
previously associated with cognitive decline over a 3 years period in the Veteran Affairs Normative
Ageing Study [40]. There is also evidence from several cross-sectional studies to support an association
between low vitamin B6 and cognitive dysfunction [9,17,41,42] and Alzheimer’s disease [43,44].
Furthermore, vitamin B6 status was associated with cognitive performance in high functioning older
adults at baseline, though not with cognitive decline over the 7 years follow-up period in the MacArthur
study of Successful Ageing [8]. Certain other studies have failed to detect any significant association
between vitamin B6 and cognitive function, however, these studies have relied on dietary intake
measures alone with no corresponding measurement of blood biomarker status [45–47]. Few RCTs
have investigated the independent effect of vitamin B6 on cognitive function and only one very early
study reported beneficial effects of vitamin B6 supplementation on memory [19]. Subsequent RCTs
have investigated the effect of vitamin B6 in combination with folate and vitamin B12, with some
studies reporting beneficial effects on cognitive function however the independent effect of vitamin B6
cannot be determined [18,20].
Whilst elevated plasma homocysteine, low folate and, to a lesser extent, vitamin B12 status have
been frequently associated with cognitive decline [11–15,48] there was no evidence of significant
associations for these biomarkers in the current study. A number of other studies have reported
similar findings [49–52]. The findings in the current study may be explained to some degree by
the fact that vitamin B6 seemed to be the limiting nutrient within the cohort. There was a greater
incidence of deficiency of vitamin B6 (11% clinical deficiency) compared with folate (3%) or vitamin B12
(0%). Also, the lack of a significant association between cognitive decline and plasma homocysteine
concentration is almost certainly is a reflection of the low prevalence of folate deficiency. Furthermore,
the concept that the association between B-vitamin status and cognition is determined by the
limiting nutrient within that population group is further supported by evidence from published
RCTs. One trial of healthy older adults in New Zealand reported no benefit of combined B-vitamin
supplementation on cognitive function [21], whereas another similar study from the Netherlands
showed that supplementation with folic acid significantly improved cognitive performance [18].
A notable difference between these two studies was that baseline folate status tended to be far lower in
the Dutch trial, suggesting that the cognitive benefit related to the correction of sub-optimal B-vitamin
status whereas additional B-vitamins to an already optimal population may have no beneficial effect.
The mechanism linking vitamin B6 with cognitive health in this and other studies in ageing is
not clear however, it is biologically plausible given the widespread functions of vitamin B6 within
the brain and nervous system [53,54]. Vitamin B6 has a crucial role in the synthesis of a variety of
neurotransmitters including dopamine and serotonin [55] and can act as a potent antioxidant [56,57].
In addition, higher vitamin B6 intakes have been associated with greater grey matter volume [58] and
combined B-vitamin supplementation (including vitamin B6) has been shown to slow brain atrophy,
an important feature cognitive dysfunction [27].
The current study has a number of strengths and limitations that merit comment. To our
knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to investigate the association between cognitive decline
and all relevant B-vitamins along with their corresponding dietary intakes. The MMSE is the most
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 53

widely used screening tools for cognitive dysfunction and although it has been criticised for lacking
sensitivity, few previous studies have used it to measure cognitive change in a healthy older population.
However, a meta-analysis reported a mean decline in MMSE of between 0.16 and 0.56 points per year
in cognitively healthy people which compares favourably to the overall rate of decline observed in
this study (mean 0.39 points per year) [38]. In addition, the rate of decline observed in this study
was identical to that observed in the Rotterdam Study of community dwelling older adults free from
cognitive impairment [59]. While the use of the MMSE may be perceived as a limiting factor in the
current study, it could be argued that its use would only attenuate the associations observed and
that the use of more sensitive tools would have, if anything, detected more subtle differences thus
strengthening the results. Another well-recognised limitation of longitudinal studies of this kind is that
individuals with the greatest decline in cognitive function are more likely to be lost to follow-up [60].
Indeed, in this study the non-participants were more likely to be older but any non-response bias
would ultimately underestimate the associations between baseline B-vitamin status and cognitive
decline and this could not have influenced the current findings.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, vitamin B6 may be an important (often overlooked) protective factor in helping
maintain cognitive health in ageing, especially in a folate and vitamin B12 replete population.
Lower vitamin B6 status (as assessed by both dietary intake and biomarker status) at baseline predicted
a greater than expected rate of cognitive decline over a 4-year period in healthy free living older adults.
These findings are important because optimising vitamin B6 status in older people, through the use of
fortified foods or supplements, may have a positive impact on cognition in ageing. Further research
in this area in the form of well-designed randomised controlled trials targeted at populations with
sub-optimal status are required in order to confirm a cause and effect relationship between B-vitamin
status and cognitive health in ageing.
