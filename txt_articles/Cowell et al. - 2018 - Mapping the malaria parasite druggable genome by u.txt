Chemogenetic characterization through in vitro evolution combined with whole-genome
analysis can identify antimalarial drug targets and drug-resistance genes. We performed
a genome analysis of 262 Plasmodium falciparum parasites resistant to 37 diverse
compounds.We found 159 gene amplifications and 148 nonsynonymous changes in 83 genes
associated with drug-resistance acquisition, where gene amplifications contributed to
one-third of resistance acquisition events. Beyond confirming previously identified
multidrug-resistance mechanisms, we discovered hitherto unrecognized drug target–inhibitor
pairs, including thymidylate synthase and a benzoquinazolinone, farnesyltransferase and a
pyrimidinedione, and a dipeptidylpeptidase and an arylurea.This exploration of the P. falciparum
resistome and druggable genome will likely guide drug discovery and structural biology
efforts, while also advancing our understanding of resistance mechanisms available to the
malaria parasite.
M
alaria has a disproportionately negative
impact on human health because its
causal protozoan parasites are adept at
changing their genomes to evade anti-
malarial drugs and the human immune
system. A single human infection may result in
upwards of 1012 asexual blood-stage parasites.
Thus, even with a relatively slow random muta-
tion rate (~10−9 per nucleotide site per mitotic
division) in the parasite, within a few cycles of
replication, each base in the P. falciparum ge-
nome can acquire a random genetic change that
may render at least one parasite resistant to the
activityofadrugorahuman-encodedantibody.The
recent evolution of artemisinin-resistant parasites
in Southeast Asia now threatens both life-saving
treatments and malaria-control efforts (1).
Although this rapid evolution impedes our
ability to control the disease, in vitro evolution in
the presence of known antimalarials, followed by
whole-genome sequencing of resistant clones, can
be used to discover mediators of drug resistance
(2). Testing for the evolution of resistance can
also reveal antimalarial drug targets (3). Com-
pared with targets that are validated using genetic
knockdown methods, chemically validated drug
targets are more valuable because their activity
can be inhibited in cultured parasites by a small
molecule. Furthermore, the inhibitor provides
a tool for crystallization and chemical genetic
studies. Most studies using this method to date
have focused on single gene mutations in re-
sponse to single compounds, even though, in
many cases, additional allelic changes have been
noted in P. falciparum clones during the acqui-
sition of compound resistance.
Next-generation sequencing shows both
neutral and positive selection
We systematically studied patterns of P. falciparum
genome evolution by analyzing the sequences of
clones resistant to diverse compounds with anti-
malarial activity across the P. falciparum life
cycle. To investigate the genomic evolutionary
response to treatment with small molecules, we
assembled a collection of isogenic P. falciparum
clones that had acquired resistance to an array
of chemically distinct small-molecule growth
inhibitors. Of the 37 different small molecules
used during in vitro resistance evolution (table S1),
26 compounds were identified as having po-
tent in vitro antimalarial activity from previous
P. falciparum phenotypic screens (4–7). Others
were chosen on the basis of medicinal chemistry
optimization: the spiroindolone NITD678 (8) and
the imidazolopiperazines GNF179, GNF452, and
GNF707 (9). Respectively, NITD678 and the three
imidazolopiperazines are similar to KAE609 and
KAF156, which are recently discovered antima-
larials that are now in clinical trials (10, 11). We also
included the licensed antimalarials atovaquone
and primaquine. Although three carbazoles
(MMV019017, MMV009063, and MMV665882)
and the three imidazolopiperazines (GNF707,
GNF452, and GNF179) were structurally similar
to one another (ChemAxon fingerprint score ≥
0.7) (fig. S1), most compounds tested had a dis-
tinct variety of functional groups and heterocyclic
substructures, with some compounds showing
activity affecting different aspects of the para-
site life cycle (tables S1 and S2 and fig. S1).
Although some P. falciparum clones included
herein have been previously described with re-
spect to their drug sensitivity (12), other clones,
including those resistant to primaquine and those
resistant to GNF179, were generated in this study
over a period of 3 to 6 months (fig. S2) using a
stepwise, high-pressure intermittent, or constant
method of compound exposure (table S1). Para-
site clones exhibited a gain of resistance relative
to their isogenic parent clones, with a fold shift
of 2.8 and 37.2 in the lower and upper quartile,
respectively, of the half-maximal effective con-
centration (EC50) for resistant clones (table S3).
This resistance shift remained stable after com-
pound pressure was removed for 30 to 115 days.
Genomic DNA was available from an average of
6.45 (median = 5) independently derived clones
for each compound.
To identify the genetic basis of drug resistance,
204 clones (including resistant clones and sen-
sitive isogenic parent clones) were fully sequenced
with the paired-end read method. We included 58
published genomic sequences of clones resistant to
12 compounds, including cladosporin (13), atova-
quone (14), and GNF179 (15). Alignment to the
P. falciparum reference genome showed 80.3-fold
average coverage of the 23.3–million base pair
(Mbp) genome, with 85.3% of bases covered by
20 or more reads (table S3). We discovered 1277
single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 668 small

 insertions or deletions (indels) that arose in the
262 whole-genome sequences during resistance
acquisition (Fig. 1A, Table 1, and table S4).
Previous whole-genome analyses of P. falciparum
with microarrays and sequencing (14, 16) showed
that during long-term in vitro growth, genes en-
coding proteins involved in antigenic variation
(such as var and rifin), usually located in the sub-
telomeric regions, rapidly acquire mutations. Thus,
we hypothesized that we would find a similar
pattern for small variants in our data set. Indeed,
upon verification, 1107 of these variants were
located in the 6% of the genome that encodes
proteins involved in antigenic variation, referred
to as the noncore genome (Table 1). We further
predicted that if mutations in the core genome
conferred a selective advantage, then we would
find an enrichment of nonsynonymous coding
changes. As predicted, the ratio of nonsynon-
ymous coding to synonymous coding alleles in the
23-Mbp core genome was 7:1 (148:21), indicating
an uneven distribution (accumulative binomial
P = 7.7 × 10–10) and detectable positive selection.
In contrast, this ratio was ~2:1 (216:128) in the
noncore region, indicating near-neutral selection
and confirming the mutability of these genes
in the absence of selection. In total, we observed
148 nonsynonymous changes (table S5) in 83 genes
(table S6) in the core genome (containing 838 var-
iants total), with less than one nonsynonymous
change per resistant clone (table S7).
We also predicted that these 83 genes would
be enriched for annotated roles in drug resist-
ance, with mutations detected in the appropri-
ate compound-specific groups of clones. Gene
ontology enrichment testing revealed that the
set of 83 genes was statistically enriched with a
“response to drug” gene ontology biological pro-
cess designation (GO:0042493; accumulative
hypergeometric P = 5.78 × 10–7; table S8). To the
best of our knowledge, there were no false nega-
tives, and our results were in agreement with
other studies (8, 17).
Most drug-resistant clones acquire copy
number variants in addition to SNVs
Copy number variants (CNVs) also contribute to
drugresistancein P. falciparum (18–20). Forexam-
ple, amplification of the gene encoding multidrug-
resistance protein 1 (pfmdr1; PF3D7_0523000)
confers multidrug resistance, including resist-
ance to mefloquine (21). However, traditional
methods of CNV detection based on sequencing
read depth are more problematic in P. falciparum
owing to its AT-rich content (~81%), which leads
to uneven sequencing coverage (22). Thus, we es-
tablished an automated pipeline for CNV detec-
tion using >3.0-fold normalized coverage. Briefly,
average read depth was computed for coding re-
gions, because intergenic regions of P. falciparum

The purple ring displays a histogram showing total counts of all three types of
mutations, with orange bars where counts exceed 15.The gray rings display
variants for resistant clones grouped by compound,with each ring representing
one of 37 compounds. Red bars represent the location of CNVs, and blue bars
represent the location of SNVs. (B) CNVs in the known drug-resistance gene

yellow for genes with higher coverage (>2.5-fold above the standard deviation).
Resistance shifts (top right) relative to the sensitive parent (circles) were
demonstrated in MMV665789-resistant clones (triangles). PCR products
(bottom right) shows that resistant clones contain the pfmdr1 CNV junction
sequence, whereas a 3D7 control lacks this sequence. (C) CNVs in pfabcI3 are
associated with resistance to multiple compounds. Resistance shifts relative
to the sensitive parent (circles) were demonstrated in MMV029272-resistant
clones (triangles). Again, the CNV junction sequence was not found in the
3D7 control DNA, whereas it was identified in clones resistant to MMV029272.

 exhibit reduced alignment confidence owing
to 90 to 95% AT content and AT-repeat seg-
ments (23). The read coverage data were nor-
malized in three groups representing the genetic
backgrounds 3D7, Dd2, or 7G8, allowing for the
identification of increased read coverage in
background-specific amplified regions. Sets
of two or more contiguous genes showing a
~2.0-fold change relative to the mean were
identified. Potential amplified regions were
then filtered to yield 159 high-confidence CNVs
(core genome, mean average coverage per gene
set > ~3.0-fold relative to mean coverage, and
Benjamini-Hochberg–corrected P < 0.001) (tables
S8 and S10). Altogether, 159 CNVs were observed
in P. falciparum clones resistant to 27 of the
37 compounds (tables S8 and S11). CNVs were
found primarily on chromosomes 1, 3, 5, and 12,
with an average size of ~65 kilo–base pairs (kbp)
(Fig. 1 and table S8). Of note, 76 core genome
deletions were also identified (table S12), but
most of these were small (<5 genes), located in
subtelomeric regions, and apparently unrelated
to the acquisition of drug resistance.
To validate our CNV-detection algorithm, we
analyzed randomized, permuted average read
coverage data and identified only about eight
CNVs fulfilling these criteria. To assess our false
negative rate, we confirmed that we could de-
tect known CNVs previously detected by micro-
array analysis, including those that span the
gene encoding lysyl tRNA synthetase (pfkrs1;
PF3D7_1350100) in three cladosporin-resistant
clones (13) (Benjamini-Hochberg–corrected t test;
P = 1.9 × 10–40, 2.3 × 10–23, and 1.3 × 10–12, respec-
tively) and the amplification event encompass-
ing the multidrug-resistance protein 1 locus
(pfmrp1; PF3D7_0112200) in the atovaquone-
resistant clone R5a (14) (Benjamini-Hochberg–
corrected t test; P = 4.1 × 10–33). The known
amplification surrounding pfatp4 in NITD678-
resistant clones (8) was not detected, likely because
this clone was sequenced with an older, 60-bp-
read-length technology and was therefore not
comparable to the rest of the set (although the
amplification could be visually detected when
compared with other samples sequenced with
60-bp reads). All 159 CNVs could be visually iden-
tified on a heatmap of normalized sequencing
coverage. We found that CNV read coverage cor-
related with the shift in EC50 in resistant clones
when no other resistance-conferring mutations
were present, such as the pfmdr1 amplification
in clones resistant to compound MMV665789
(Fig. 1B). We used quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR) to further validate CNVs that
spanned genes encoding phosphatidylinositol
4-kinase (pfpi4k; PF3D7_0509800), ABC [adeno-
sine triphosphate (ATP)–binding cassette] trans-
porterIfamilymember1(pfabcI3;PF3D7_0319700),
and the aminophospholipid-transporting P-ATPase
(pfatp2; PF3D7_1219600) (fig. S3). In addition,
we identified paired-end reads from sequencing
library fragments that spanned the CNV bounda-
ries in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (24, 25);
this was followed by PCR over the boundaries
(Fig. 1, B and C, and fig. S4) (26) for CNVs that
covered pfmdr1, pfabcI3, and pfpi4k.
Resistance mechanisms are
reproducible and structure-dependent
We predicted that treating parasites with com-
pounds that have similar chemical structures
would yield reproducible genomic changes. Clus-
tering on the basis of compound similarity showed
that parasites acquired similar resistance alleles
when treated with structurally similar compounds
(Fig. 2 and fig. S1). For example, independent
clones resistantto imidazolopiperazines (GNF452,
GNF707, and GNF179) and the closely related
compound MMV007564 acquired mutations re-
sulting in coding changes in the cyclic amine
resistancelocus(pfcarl; PF3D7_0321900). Further-
more, amplification of the pfmdr1 region was ob-
served in all 3D7 clones that acquired resistance
to three closely related carbazoles: MMV009063,
MMV019017, and MMV665882 (table S10 and
Fig. 2).
The P. falciparum resistome
Our data set of CNVs and SNVs revealed 35 genes
with two or more types of evidence suggesting a
role as a drug-resistance determinant or actual
target (Fig. 2). Evidence types include SNVs with-
in an amplification event, the presence of two
different alleles in the same gene for the same
compound, or the same allele appearing in re-
sponse to two different compounds. Mutations
in pfmdr1 were discovered for six different com-
pounds, confirming its known role in drug re-
sistance. Notably, a likely resistance mechanism
or target gene was discovered for each compound
examined. Below, we highlight genes with the
strongest evidence of mediating drug resistance.
Discovery of alleles in known
drug-resistance genes
Genetic detection of alleles associated with anti-
malarial resistance is the primary method of track-
ing resistance in clinical samples, because in vitro
phenotypic susceptibility testing is difficult and
costly in malaria parasites. Analysis of the mu-
tations present in our set of resistant P. falciparum
clones revealed both known and unknown genes
implicated in drug resistance. We found sever-
al previously unidentified mutations in known
P. falciparum resistance mediators. For example,
we found four hitherto unrecognized alleles in
the gene encoding the P. falciparum chloroquine
resistance transporter (pfcrt; PF3D7_0709000),
including S65R, A138V, K76Q, and S90N amino
acid changes. Although one of the selection com-
pounds, MMV006767, bears an aminoquinoline
core, similar to chloroquine, neither MMV011895

 is a pleotropic transporter regulating drug levels
in the digestive vacuole. We also discovered a
F806L allele in pfmdr1 in MMV026596-resistant
lines, which showed a 1.7-fold increase in the
MMV026596 EC50 (table S3). An equivalent in-
crease in the MMV026596 EC50 was also observed
(table S13) upon assaying a separate NF54 line
that had been selected using an unrelated com-
pound (ACT-451840) and that had also acquired
a F806L mutation in pfmdr1 (27). In contrast, the
same mutation increased parasite susceptibility
of 3D7 and NF54 lines to known antimalarials
such as mefloquine (13.8-fold and 7.3-fold, respec-
tively), dihydroartemisin (4.2-fold and 1.4-fold,
respectively), and lumefantrine (5.4-fold in NF54;
the 3D7 line was not tested). In addition, multi-
copy amplification of the pfmdr1 region was
observed in all 3D7 clones that had acquired
resistance to MMV009063 (eight of eight clones;
average amplification, 10-fold), MMV019017 (four
of four clones), MMV665882 (five of five clones),
and MMV665789 (seven of seven clones) (table
S10). A nonsynonymous SNV was also discovered
in pfmdr2 (K840N in response to compound
MMV665789). In addition, mutations were de-
tected in the gene encoding a plasma membrane–
localizedABCtransporter(pfmrp2;PF3D7_1229100)
(28) in a clone that was resistant to imidazolo-
piperazines (selected with KAD707), as well as in
two clones resistant to atovaquone. Changes in
pfmrp2 transcript levels have been associated
with levels of P. falciparum resistance to quino-
line drugs (29), including chloroquine and meflo-
quine. A SNV was found in the ATP-binding
cassette of PfMRP2 at amino acid position D976N
in the KAD707-resistant clone, whereas an A403P
change in the transmembrane domain and a
frameshift mutation (N1974fs) were detected in
the atovaquone-resistant lines. Subsequent testing
identified clones with cross-resistance to mefloquine,
consistent with pfmdr1 amplification (fig. S5).
Newly discovered drug-resistance genes
Knowing the identity of genes that impart multi-
drug resistance is important for the design of new
drugs, understanding how existing therapeu-
tics can lose their efficacy in clinical settings, and
identifying likely causative alleles in genome-
wide association studies. We observed that partic-
ular genes were mutated repeatedly in response
to diverse compounds, indicating that they are
more likely to be mediators of pleiotropic drug
resistance. One such candidate is the putative ABC
transporter encoded by pfabcI3 (PF3D7_0319700)
(28). Compounds that selected for mutations in
pfabcI3 (MMV020746, MMV023367, MMV024114,
MMV029272, and MMV665939) are structurally
diverse, and some are active across the parasite life
cycle (12). The predicted gene product acquired
point mutations [L690I, R2180G, R2180P (two
times), and Y2079C] during resistance selections
and was central to 12 different amplification events
on chromosome 3 (table S7 and Fig. 1C).
A previously unrecognized type of potential
resistance mediator in this study was a predicted
amino acid transporter of the SLC32 family
of solute carrier proteins (encoded by pfaat1;
PF3D7_0629500). Orthologs of this conserved
protein are responsible for the transport of amino
acids in synaptic vesicles in humans (30). Muta-
tions in the encoding gene were associated with
resistancetothreediversecompounds:MMV007224
(-135I inframe insertion), MMV668399 (P380S,
K238N, and V185L), and MMV011895 (F230L).
This gene was found to be associated with levels
of chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum in a
genome-wide association study (31), and we
found that the product of pfaat1 localizes to the
P. falciparum digestive vacuole (fig. S6). Thus,
the amino transporter encoded by pfaat1 may
play a role in the efflux of multiple drugs from
the digestive vacuole, similar to PfCRT.
Nonessential genes and drug activators
Because genes with premature stop codons (stop-
gained mutations) are unlikely to encode critical
drug targets, genes with these mutations that
were identified in our screen likely play a role
in compound detoxification. The P. falciparum
gene encoding the prodrug activation and resist-
ance esterase (pfpare; PF3D7_0709700), which
is annotated as a lysophospholipase, provides
resistance to MMV011438 and pepstatin butyl
ester (32). Another gene annotated as a lysophos-
pholipase is PF3D7_0218600, which bears a
FabD/lysophospholipase–like domain and har-
bors frameshift mutations in two independent
clones (MALDA-Primaquine-PQG10 and MALDA-
Primaquine-PQA11) that acquired blood-stage
primaquine tolerance after 5 months of exposure
(fig. S2). This gene was not mutated in any of the
other 261 clones and contained two of the eight
codon-changing core mutations (three frameshift,
four missense, and one stop-gained) in seven dif-
ferent primaquine-resistant clones.
In addition, the gene encoding the amino acid
transporter (pfaat2; PF3D7_1208400) was found
to have a stop codon in a clone (NMicro-GNF179-
S2-3D7-2C) that is resistantto GNF179, an imidazo-
piperazine that is closely related to the clinical
candidate KAF156 (10). pfaat2 is predicted to con-
tain 10 transmembrane domains and a pfam01490
amino acid transporter domain. The position-
903 stop mutation was found in concert with a
splice acceptor intronic mutation in the gene
encoding the acetyl coenzyme A transporter
(pfact; PF3D7_1036800)—a gene whose disrup-
tion confers resistance to imidazolopiperazines
(15). CRISPR-Cas9 introduction of the pfaat2
L903 stop codon into GNF179-sensitive Dd2 par-
asites revealed that this mutation also confers
resistance to GNF179 on its own (EC50 fold shift
of 38 compared with the sensitive parent clone)
(fig. S7).
Transcription factors
Our study unveiled several resistance mediators
that are likely to play a role in the parasite’s tran-
scriptional response to drugs. Although there are
no examples in P. falciparum, work in S. cerevisiae
and other microbes has shown that mutations in
transcription factors can often result in multidrug
resistance (33). In our study, the most commonly
mutated class of genes was that encoding the
Apicomplexan AP2 transcription factor family
(10 different variants observed in five different
AP2 transcription factor–encoding genes, as well
as several potential intergenic promoter muta-
tions). In plants, AP2 transcription factors are
involved in the cellular response to stress (34),
and in Plasmodium, they regulate a variety of
developmental transitions including commitment
to sexual development and sporogony (35, 36).
The most prominent AP2 transcription factor in
our set was encoded by PF3D7_0613800, which
showed evidence of selection three times with
three independent compounds (MMV665882,
MMV665939, and MMV011438). In two cases, the
same codon deletion (QMEGDNEMEGDNE197Q)
was observed, and in one case, there was a non-
synonymous codon change (Q197E) at the same
position. In addition, a region on chromosome
10 that encompasses a gene encoding another
AP2 transcription factor [pfap2tf-10, also called
pfap2-i (37); PF3D7_1007700] was amplified
in nine clones (table S9). The amplification on
chromosome 10 appeared in one primaquine-
resistant clone (consisting of only seven genes
with an estimated four to five copies; P = 6.6 ×
10–5), as well in clones resistant to GNF179,
MMV008148, or MMV011438. Variants in the gene
encoding the chromosome 6 transcription factor
(PF3D7_0613800) were associated with resist-
ance to quinine in genome-wide association
studies (38). However, we still need to determine
whether these changes are associated with multi-
drug resistance or are related to long-term in
vitro culturing.
The Forkhead-associated domain is a phospho-
peptide recognition domain found in some kinases
and transcription factors (39). Mutations in a gene
encoding an uncharacterized protein bearing this
domain (pffhd; PF3D7_0909700) were found in all
samples resistant to MMV668399 (P = 1 × 10–18
using an accumulative binomial distribution).
Mutations included a M1V start-lost mutation,
a K392 stop-gained mutation, L95R and G720E
missense mutations, and a gene deletion (MALDA-
MMV668399-2F2). Given that three of the muta-
tions were predicted to result in loss of function,
we hypothesize that this is a gene that inhibits
drug action, although additional work needs
to be done to characterize this further. These
same resistant clones also contained mutations
in the genes encoding the amino acid trans-
porter (pfaat1; PF3D7_0629500) described above
and the inorganic anion transporter (pfsulp;
PF3D7_1471200) discussed below.
New targets and compound
target–inhibitor pairs
In addition to discovering genes involved in
drug resistance, another goal of this study was to
identify antimalarial drug targets to fill the need
for alternative malaria treatments and advance
the campaign to eliminate malarial infections
in humans. In general, we considered enzyme-
encoding genes with mutations as potential drug
target candidates, which was further supported

 in the catalytic site. A previously reported ex-
ample is the set of BRD1095-resistant clones,
which bear four different amino acid position
changes (40) located in the predicted active site
of the alpha unit of the cytosolic phenylalanyl-
tRNA synthetase.
Thymidylate synthase
One likely target-inhibitor pair is dihydrofo-
late reductase–thymidylate synthase (encoded
by pfdhfr-ts; PF3D7_0417200) and the benzoquin-
azolinoneMMV027634.Althoughdihydropyrimidine
inhibitors of the bifunctional enzyme are well-
known antimalarials (e.g., pyrimethamine), all
target the dihydrofolate reductase portion of
the dual-function protein. We identified three
different nonsynonymous mutations mapping
to the thymidylate synthase portion of the bifunc-
tional molecule in the MMV027634-resistant
lines (Fig. 3A). Mapping of the mutations onto a
published thymidylate P. falciparum crystal struc-
ture (41) showed that each mutation flanks the
2'-deoxyuridylic acid (dUMP)–binding site of
the enzyme (Fig. 3A). Metabolomics (discussed
below) and independent docking of MMV027634
provided evidence that both substrates occupy
the thymidylate synthase active site with a cal-
culated affinity of –8.9 kcal/mol.
Farnesyltransferase
Farnesyltransferase is encoded by another tar-
get gene (pfftb; PF3D7_1147500), which acquired
two different mutations in amino acid 515 (A515V
and A515T) in three clones resistant to the py-
rimidinedione MMV019066 (Fig. 3B). Modeling
shows that the mutation at amino acid 515 likely
disrupts interactions between the thienopyrimi-
dine and the farnesylation active site, result-
ing in a resistant phenotype. Previous work has
shown mutations in the lipid substrate–binding
site of farnesyltransferase in tetrahydroquinoline-
resistant parasites (42).
Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 1
An additional potential target gene encodes
dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 1 (DPAP1) (pfdpap1;
PF3D7_1116700), an exopeptidase that localizes
to the digestive vacuole and cleaves amino ter-
minal dipeptides from proteins or oligopeptides
(43). Each parasite clone resistant to MMV029272,
an arylurea, carried a mutation (L437S, L415P, or
N62H) in pfdpap1. This gene is considered to be
essential because it cannot be disrupted (44). All
resistant clones also contained amplifications that
encompassed the ABC transporter gene (pfabcI3;
PF3D7_0319700), highlighting how resistance
mechanisms can be found along with targets.
Aminophospholipid-transporting
P-type ATPase
As was previously reported for cladosporin and
lysyl tRNA synthase (13), gene amplification
events can occur around drug targets. We detected
six CNVs in a genomic region on chromosome

Fig. 3. A computational model of active antimalarial small molecules
docked against their respective targets. Schematics of the biochemical
pathway, the compound, and conserved pfam domains are shown in
the right panel. (A) MMV027634 occupies the thymidylate synthase active
site. The benzoquinazoline head group of MMV027634 is stabilized by
hydrogen-bonding within the dUMP active site of dihydrofolate reductase–
thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS). Further stabilization occurs at the tail
with multiple hydrogen bonds to Gly378, mutation of which confers
resistance to this compound. Mutations are all found in the thymidylate
synthase portion of the molecule (http:/
/pfam.xfam.org/family/pf00303).
(B) MMV019066 and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) are shown concurrently
docked within the binding pocket of farnesyltransferase. A model of the
P. falciparum farnesyltransferase beta subunit was constructed using the
rat homolog (Protein Data Bank ID, 2ZIR) as a template. Despite
substantial interspecies protein sequence variance, the FPP binding
pocket is largely conserved (69). The preferential binding states of
FPP and MMV019066 are shown competing for similar hydrophobic space.
Resistance mutations are found in the squalene-hopene cyclase domain
(http:/

 12 that encompass a gene encoding a pre-
dicted aminophospholipid-transporting P-type
ATPase (pfatpase2; PF3D7_1219600) (table S7
and fig. S3), previously named PfATP2. Tandem
amplifications with approximate sizes of 8.7, 29,
and 25 kbp were found in MMV007224-resistant
clones, and amplifications of 102, 95, and 38 kbp
were found in MMV665852-resistant lines. The
8.7-kbp amplification events encompassed only
two genes—namely, the transporter gene and a
truncated var pseudogene (PF3D7_1219500), in-
dicating that the transporter is likely the target.
This protein is closely related to PfATP4, an im-
portant antimalarial drug target. In the closely
related rodent malaria parasite, P. berghei, this
transporter was refractory to targeted gene dele-
tion attempts, demonstrating its essentiality (45).
MMV007224 and MMV665852 are structurally
similar to one another and are both active against
liver-stage parasites. S. cerevisiae orthologs of
pfatp2 encode the Dnf1/Dnf2 aminophospho-
lipid translocases (flippases), which maintain
membrane lipid asymmetry at the plasma mem-
brane and contribute to endocytosis (46). In sup-
port of this activity, additional nonsynonymous
variants in MMV007224-resistant lines were pre-
dicted to encode proteins involved in similar
processes: Sec24, a component of the coat pro-
tein complex II (COPII) that promotes vesicle
budding from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
and Yip1, a protein required for fusion of these
ER-derived vesicles with the Golgi. MMV665852
is a triclocarban, an antibacterial agent whose
proposed mechanism is hypothesized to be inhi-
bition of fatty acid synthesis, similar to triclosan,
which was proposed to inhibit lipid and mem-
brane function in Plasmodium parasites (47, 48).
Last, in some cases, it can be difficult to deter-
mine whethera gene encodes a promisingtargetor
is a resistance gene. For example, PF3D7_0107500
is annotated as encoding a lipid-sterol symporter
in the resistance-nodulation-division(RND)trans-
porter family. RND transporters are well charac-
terized in Gram-negative bacteria, where they are
involved in extruding toxins, exporting virulence
determinants, and maintaining overall homeosta-
sis (49). Although specific pumps in this family
have been associated with multidrug resistance
in bacteria (50), it is unclear what specific func-
tion the transporter encoded by PF3D7_0107500
has in P. falciparum. We detected five differ-
ent SNVs in this gene in clones resistant to
MMV028038, MMV019662, and MMV009108, in
addition to 12 amplification events surrounding
this gene in clones resistant to MMV028038 and
MMV019662. Additional heterozygous SNVs were
found in this gene in the MMV019662-resistant
clones with chromosome 1 amplification events
(table S14). MMV028038 and MMV019662 both
have an amide bond, whereas MMV009108 does
not. In addition, three different SNVs (D520Y,
K615N, and I596M) were detected in an anno-
tated inorganic anion transporter gene (pfsulp;
PF3D7_1471200) in clones resistant to the py-
rimidine MMV668399. The probability of ran-
domly observing the same gene three times in
six selections is extremely low (P = 4.0 × 10–11).
PF3D7_1471200 encodes PfSulP, a protein of the
SLC26 membrane protein family (51) with 11 trans-
membrane domains. In P. falciparum, this trans-
porter has been localized to the surface of the
parasite and is thought to play a role in the trans-
port of anions across the parasite plasma mem-
brane (52), although its role in drug resistance
has not been well defined. Homology models
with a fumurate transporter (53) showed that all
mutations were located in the STAS domain, a
cytoplasmic extension that in some species plays
a role in signal transduction.
Metabolomic profiling of compounds
used to generate resistance
To functionally validate the modes of action
associated with the targets predicted by resist-
ance generation, metabolic perturbations asso-
ciated with drug exposure (54) were assessed
for 25 of the 37 compounds by using ultrahigh-
performance liquid chromatography–mass spec-
trometry (UHPLC-MS). Overall, the detected
metabolic perturbations predict modes of action
in accordance with the generated resistance mu-
tations observed (figs. S8 and S9 and table S16).
MMV008149, which resulted in a mutation in
cytochrome b (pfcytb; mal_mito_3) (12), gives a
classical response in the pyrimidine biosynthetic
pathway with accumulation of N-carbamoyl-
L-aspartate and dihydroorotate, indicative of
disruption of cytochrome b or dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase function. Similarly, as predicted
by the thymidylate synthase resistance mutations
and computational docking (Fig. 3), metabolomic
analysis of MMV027634 revealed a clear sig-
nature in folate biosynthesis (figs. S8 and S9).
MMV024114 has an analogous metabolic response
and likely targets folate metabolism, although
resistance mutations for this compound arose in
pfcrt and pfabcI3, suggesting an adaptive efflux-
based resistance by these parasites. Cluster anal-
ysis of the metabolic responses showed that
compounds that yielded resistance mutations
in the transporter genes pfmdr1, pfaat1, and
pflss (MMV009108, ACT-451840, MMV665789,
MMV019662, MMV007224, and MMV009063)
had similar profiles. For many of the compounds
that showed minimal metabolic perturbation
(GNF179, MMV008149, MMV011438, and prima-
quine), resistance selection resulted in CNVs in
pfap2tf-10 [pfap2-i (37)]. Although not all com-
pounds resulted in metabolic responses, the
general concordance between metabolic changes
and resistance mutations supports the combined
use of these approaches for compound target
identification.
Discussion and conclusions
Our study represents a controlled examination
of antimalarial drug resistance acquisition by
P. falciparum. Prior studies examining the para-
site’s genetic response during drug resistance
development have evaluated the response only
to known antimalarials (31, 38, 55, 56) or have
focused on coding mutations in one target
gene in response to a single compound class
(8, 13, 32, 40, 57–60). It is likely that the genes
that are identified here will prove important in
both clinical studies and the process of drug
development.
One noteworthy finding from this data set is
the high enrichment of mutations under positive
selection. We focused here on genes for which
there were multiple lines of supporting evidence
across our study; however, it is likely that other
important genes were identified. Excluding genes
contained within CNVs, the 57 singleton genes
with nonsynonymous mutations encode potential
druggable targets, such as guanosine triphospha-
tases, mRNA decapping enzymes, components of
V-type ATPase complexes, kinases, and ubiquitin
ligases (table S5). Although some of these non-
synonymous changes could have been maintained
within the population by chance, some are plausi-
ble targets of selection. For example, although
resistance to ACT-451840 is conferred by muta-
tions in pfmdr1 (61), a mutation was observed in
the gene encoding a putative replication factor C
subunit 4 (PF3D7_1241700) that results in a S42T
amino acid change near the ATP-binding pocket
in two independent ACT-451840–resistant clones
(61). Replication factor C subunit 4 is the subunit
ATPase in the clamp-loading DNA polymerase
complex, is likely essential, and is a good drug
target. Modeling shows that ACT-451840 could
bind between subunits 1 and 4 of replication
factor C, potentially disrupting ATPg ingress (fig.
S10). Our findings also highlight the large number
of uncharacterized genes in the P. falciparum
genome and the need for further functional
annotation.
Not all mutations discovered in this study will
confer resistance—they may compensate, spe-
cifically or nonspecifically, for fitness losses that
result from a resistance-conferring mutation.
Alternatively, they may be associated with ad-
aptation to long-term in vitro culture. Genome
editing or creating recombinant lines may be
used to confirm that alleles provide resistance
(8, 15, 27, 40, 58, 62, 63). On the other hand,
given the multigenic nature of resistance, it may
be difficult to recreate a resistance phenotype (7).
For example, the nonsynonymous changes that
emerged in phenylalanine tRNA ligase during
development of resistance to BRD1095 were
accompanied by copy number changes at un-
related sites, which potentially explains why at-
tempts at validation through genome editing
were unsuccessful.
Beyond changes in coding sequences, the low
frequency at which noncoding variants were
found in our data set suggests a possible role. We
identified only 21 silent mutations within genes
that are plausible drug targets, including those
encodingproteinkinase4,Ark3kinase,cytochrome
c oxidase 3, a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase, a
putative serine threonine protein kinase, a DNA
helicase, and an 18S ribosomal RNA. Several of the
genes with silent mutations were highly expressed,
including the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 gene,
in which the mutation substitutes a rare codon
for a frequently used one [acA (23.8% usage for
threonine) to acG (3.6%)]. Silent mutations in hu-
man mdr1 can confer resistance to cancer drugs

 owing to altered protein folding (64). Further work
will be needed to establish whether these silent
substitutions play a role in drug resistance in
P. falciparum. Similarly, intergenic and intronic
mutations were also common. Although in most
cases, resistance was explained by the presence
of nonsynonymous coding mutations in the tar-
get or resistance genes, intergenic mutations
were also common. Likewise, intron variants were
more likely to be found in the core genome than
in subtelomeric regions (64:5), suggesting a pos-
sible functional role.
Last, it is likely that among the genes that we
identified, several may contribute to clinical resist-
ance at some level. Although pharmacokinetics are
different in vivo than in vitro, we repeatedly re-
discovered mutations in genes important for
clinical resistance. It is therefore likely that pre-
viously unidentified genes are candidates to be
under selection in clinical isolates. Mutations in
3247 clinical P. falciparum isolates reveal that
four mediators of resistance (the ABC trans-
porter gene pfabcI3, the putative amino acid
transporter gene pfaat2, the AP2 transcription
factor gene pfap2tf-6b, and the farnesyltransferase
gene pfftb) have nonsynonymous-to-synonymous
ratios greater than 2:1, suggesting that they are
under positive selection (65) (table S15). However,
the role of these genes in clinical drug resistance
is unknown. In addition, our data highlight the
importance of CNVs in conferring multidrug re-
sistance and suggest that high-coverage genome
sequencing of clinical isolates will provide infor-
mation on selective pressures in the field (66).
It is notable that we were able to identify a likely
target or resistance gene for every compound for
which resistant parasites were generated. The
haploid genome and the lack of transcriptional
feedback loops suggest that P. falciparum is a
particularly good model for both target identifica-
tion and resistome studies. Our characterization
of the chemogenetic landscape of P. falciparum
will guide the design of small-molecule inhib-
itors against this deadly eukaryotic pathogen.
