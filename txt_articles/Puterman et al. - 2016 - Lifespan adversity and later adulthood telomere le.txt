Stress over the lifespan is thought to promote accelerated aging and
early disease. Telomere length is a marker of cell aging that appears to
be one mediator of this relationship. Telomere length is associated
with early adversity and with chronic stressors in adulthood in many
studies. Although cumulative lifespan adversity should have bigger
impacts than single events, it is also possible that adversity in
childhood has larger effects on later life health than adult stressors, as
suggested by models of biological embedding in early life. No studies
have examined the individual vs. cumulative effects of childhood and
adulthood adversities on adult telomere length. Here, we examined
the relationship between cumulative childhood and adulthood adver-
sity, adding up a range of severe financial, traumatic, and social
exposures, as well as comparing them to each other, in relation to
salivary telomere length. We examined 4,598 men and women from
the US Health and Retirement Study. Single adversities tended to
have nonsignificant relations with telomere length. In adjusted
models, lifetime cumulative adversity predicted 6% greater odds of
shorter telomere length. This result was mainly due to childhood
adversity. In adjusted models for cumulative childhood adversity, the
occurrence of each additional childhood event predicted 11% in-
creased odds of having short telomeres. This result appeared mainly
because of social/traumatic exposures rather than financial expo-
sures. This study suggests that the shadow of childhood adversity
may reach far into later adulthood in part through cellular aging.

A
ging cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of non-
communicable diseases, and telomere shortening in cells
plays a part of this aging process (1, 2). Telomeres are DNA–
protein caps at the ends of chromosomes that protect genetic
material from degradation, and their lengths indicate cellular ag-
ing (2, 3). Experiments in rodents implicate shortened telomeres
and lower activity of telomerase, the enzyme that lengthens telo-
meres, as causes of mitochondrial and tissue damage associated
with disease pathogenesis (4–6).
Telomere length is linked cross-sectionally and prospectively with
human disease states in many studies. A recent meta-analysis sug-
gests that individuals with observed short leukocyte telomeres are at
an ∼80% increased risk of concurrent reports of cardiovascular
disease and an ∼40% increased risk of developing cardiovascular
disease in the future (7). Other recent meta-analyses support the
concurrent associations between short telomeres and diabetes (8)
and several cancers (9, 10). Several studies indicate that short
telomeres from varied sources, including leukocytes and saliva, are
related to early mortality (11–17), including a study with >60,000
adults (18), although null studies also exist (19–22).
Although these studies suggest that telomere length plays a role
in disease, they are observational, and studies directly linking ge-
netics of telomere length to disease would allow a more substantive
inference of a causal role in disease pathogenesis. Recently, in
humans, there were two such Mendelian randomization studies.
These studies examined ∼80,000 participants from 15 mostly
population-based genome-wide association cohort studies. They
showed that common sequence variants of seven genes that di-
rectly regulate telomere maintenance, summed as a genetic risk
score, significantly increase risks for cardiovascular, pulmonary
(23), and Alzheimer’s diseases (24).
As our understanding of the complexities of telomere biology and
its consequences continue to deepen, increasing research is attend-
ing to the antecedents of telomere shortening. Telomere length is
moderately to highly heritable; estimates range from 36% to 84%
heritable (25). In light of this variable heritability, environmental risk
factors that may accelerate telomere shortening have been widely
studied. Considerable attention has been placed on discrete expe-
riences of psychosocial adversities at different periods in the lifespan.
Exposure to adversity can degrade cell function and accelerate
aging of the immune system (26–28). Adversity at different pe-
riods in the lifespan includes prenatal exposure to maternal
stress, repeated experiences of abuse during childhood, and adult-
hood stressors such as exposure to financial and life stressors
associated with poverty or caregiving. Some evidence, with ex-
ceptions (29, 30), indicates that adversity in childhood (31) and
adulthood (32–37) are not only cross-sectionally related to short
telomeres, but that childhood (38) and adulthood (39) adverse
experiences can accelerate shortening over time. The vast majority
Significance
The gradual aging of the immune system is partly marked by
shortened telomeres, the DNA–protein caps at the ends of chro-
mosomes that protect genes from degradation. This study un-
dertakes a lifespan approach to stress and leukocyte telomere
length in a nationally representative sample of US residents. By
using data from 16 y of the Health and Retirement Study, child-
hood and adulthood life stressors were examined for their indi-
vidual and combined associations with increased odds of having
short telomeres. Accumulated adverse experiences in childhood
significantly predicted an increased likelihood of having short
telomeres later in life, suggesting a potential pathway through
which childhood experiences have been previously shown to
predict adulthood morbidity and mortality.

Puterman et al.
 of these previous studies have examined highly stressful experi-
ences as predictors of telomere length within specific contexts of
abuse, caregiving, low socioeconomic status, or unemployment,
for example.
Rarely have researchers had the opportunity to examine a
combination of adverse financial, social, and traumatic stressors
and how they may accumulate over time from childhood through
adulthood to predict short telomeres. Jodczyk et al. (40) pro-
spectively examined the accumulation of childhood and early
adulthood abuse and violence, mental health disorders, substance
use, and other significant life stressors in a cohort of 677 New
Zealand adults and found no association between the accumula-
tion of childhood and early adulthood adversity with telomere
length at age 30. Verhoeven et al. (41) also did not find a signif-
icant relationship between early adversity and adulthood telomere
length in their sample of 2,936 Dutch adults with mean age 41 with
a current or remitted diagnosis of a depressive or anxiety disorder
and healthy controls. Conversely, in the European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer, a nationally representative sample from
the United Kingdom, Surtees et al. found a relationship (42). They
measured telomeres in a subsample of 4,441 women aged 41–80
(median age 62) (42) and found that retrospectively reported
childhood adverse life events accumulated to predict shorter adult
telomeres. These events included separation from mother for
more than 1 y, parental divorce, physical abuse, and parental
unemployment, among others. These studies also examined as-
sociations between recent adulthood events and telomere length
[measured over past the 5 y (41, 42) or between ages 16 and 25
(40)], and effects are mixed, with only Verhoeven et al. (41)
demonstrating significant associations.
The present study examines the combined effects of adverse
experiences during childhood and adulthood and their relationship
to telomere length in the nationally representative US Health and
Retirement Study (HRS). This study undertakes a lifespan ap-
proach on adversity and salivary telomere length in a large sample
in the United States that does not limit adulthood experiences to
recent events and that expands measured adversities to include fi-
nancial, social, and traumatic experiences. We were specifically
interested in examining the independent and combined associations
of accumulated childhood and adulthood adversity with later-life
telomere length. We also completed follow-up analyses to exam-
ine individual associations between each adverse experience and
telomere length and whether financial or social/traumatic stressors
drive any of the relationships.
Results
Our final study sample comprised 4,598 participants that had
complete data for all adversity measures and telomere length.
Table 1 shows the weighted covariate distributions in the telomere
sample, as well as the full HRS sample, inclusive of the telomere
sample (n = 17,217). The covariate distributions appear similar
across the study sample and full HRS sample. Father’s education
data were missing for 570 respondents (12% of our sample).
Other covariates contained few or no missing values.
Childhood adversity included whether before the age of 18, the
respondent’s (i) family received help from relatives because of
financial difficulties, (ii) family ever had to relocate due to fi-
nancial difficulties, (iii) father ever lost his job, and (iv) parents’
substance or alcohol use caused problems in the home. Childhood
adversity also included whether the respondent (v) had ever ex-
perienced physical abuse before age 18, (vi) had to repeat a year
of school, and (vii) had gotten into trouble with police. The first
three childhood adversity items are considered financial in nature,
whereas the final four are social or traumatic. Adulthood adversity
included whether, at any measurement point over the course of
the biannual assessments from 1992–2008, the respondent (i) re-
ceived Medicaid coverage, (ii) received food stamps, and (iii) was
unemployed and looking for work or temporarily laid off. Adult-
hood adversity also included whether the respondent had expe-
rienced, at any age after 17, (iv) the death of a child, (v) the death
of a spouse, (vi) a natural disaster, (vii) being wounded in combat,
(viii) a partner addicted to drugs or alcohol, (ix) being victim of a
physical attack, and (x) a spouse or child with a serious illness. The
first three adulthood adversity items are considered financial in
nature and the final seven social and traumatic. Table 1 presents
the weighted proportions of each childhood and adulthood ad-
versity item, and Table 2 presents weighted distributions of the
cumulative scores. Individual childhood adversity items ranged in
prevalence from 6% to nearly 20%, and adulthood adversity items
ranged in prevalence from 6% to >30%. Total number of child-
hood adversity ranged from zero to seven in our sample and adult
adversity ranged from zero to eight. Cumulative lifespan adversity
(the total of all childhood and adulthood items) ranged from 0 to
11. More than three-quarters of the sample experienced at least
one measure of lifetime adversity, and more than half experi-
enced two or more. Childhood and adulthood adversities were
significantly correlated (r = 0.18; P < 0.001).
Average telomere length t/s ratio for the sample was 1.28 (SD =
0.27). Average telomere length t/s ratio for the lowest quartile was
0.96 (SD = 0.15) and for the other 75% was 1.39 (SD = 0.21).
Non-Hispanic black participants were less likely than Non-His-
panic white and Hispanic participants to be categorized as having
short telomeres (16.7%, 25.1%, and 23%, respectively) but
reported more adverse events across the lifespan than non-His-
panic whites (means 3.04, 2.35, and 2.94, respectively).

 Unadjusted and adjusted multivariate logistic regression models
were completed for summary measures of (i) cumulative lifespan
adversity (childhood and adulthood combined) and (ii) childhood
and adulthood adversity in the same model. Cumulative lifespan
adversity significantly predicted increases in odds of having short
telomeres in both unadjusted [odds ratio (OR) = 1.09; 0.95 confi-
dence interval (CI) = 1.04–1.14] and adjusted (OR = 1.06; 0.95
CI = 1.01–1.12) models. When lifespan adversity was separated into
childhood and adulthood components, both childhood (OR = 1.10;
0.95 CI = 1.03–1.19) and adulthood adversity (OR = 1.08; 0.95 CI =
1.02–1.14), significantly predicted increased odds of having short
telomeres in the same unadjusted model. In an adjusted model, only
childhood adversity (OR = 1.11; 0.95 CI = 1.02–1.21) was related to
increased odds of short telomeres, whereas adulthood adversity was
not (OR = 1.03; 0.95 CI = 0.96–1.10). In other words, each child-
hood adversity predicted 11% increased odds of having short telo-
meres. There was no evidence of an interaction between cumulative
childhood and cumulative adult adversity (P = 0.59). Sensitivity
analyses for racial differences revealed a similar association among
non-Hispanic whites as the pooled sample (OR = 1.08; 0.95 CI =
1.02–1.15). Models were nonsignificant among non-Hispanic blacks
and Hispanics.
A series of follow-up analyses were completed to test whether
category of exposure mattered. When adversity in childhood was
split into social/traumatic and financial adversity, only the former
showed a significant increase in the odds of having short telomeres
later in life (adjusted OR = 1.19; 0.95 CI = 1.03–1.38). In adult-
hood, neither financial nor adult social/traumatic events significantly
predicted increased odds of having short telomeres in adjusted
models. All significant effects of the summary adversity measures
(unadjusted and adjusted) held when corrected for multiple testing
using the false discovery rate method (43, 44) (Table 3).
Follow-up analyses on individual adversity items demonstrated
that only death of a spouse and receipt of Medicaid significantly
predicted increased odds of having short telomeres in unadjusted
models after correcting for the false discovery rate. After
adjusting for all covariates and accounting for the false discovery
rate, no individual adversity item’s OR was significant. See Table
4 and Fig. 1 for each adversity item’s independent OR.
Discussion
In the present study, adverse experiences throughout the life course
predicted increased odds of falling into the lowest quartile in telo-
mere length in late adulthood, even after adjustment for potential
covariates. These findings appear to be driven most strongly by ex-
periences during childhood in fully adjusted models. Participants
were at 11% increased odds of being categorized as short in telomere
length for each additional childhood adverse experience. These
findings accounted for childhood and current socioeconomic status,
adulthood adversity, and many other behavioral and health-related
factors, such as smoking status, body mass index (BMI), and presence
of health conditions. The set of childhood events that are emblematic
of trauma or psychological issues in oneself or one’s parents—such as
having trouble with the police, having to repeat school, physical
abuse, and parents with substance abuse problems—predicted
shorter telomeres, whereas the index of financial problems (i.e.,
paternal unemployment, receiving financial help from a family
member or friend, or relocation due to financial difficulties) did not.
Although poverty can provide a fertile context for experiencing
traumatic events (28), financial stressors alone had little effect in the
current study. These findings are consistent with a recent meta-
analysis demonstrating that there is very weak or no evidence for
associations between childhood or contemporaneous markers of
socioeconomic status and telomere length in adulthood (45). The
rich survey data from HRS allowed us to differentiate the social and
traumatic adverse experiences from the financial ones, but these
differences should be further investigated in other large samples
and with other health outcomes. Our findings on social adversity are
consistent with the majority of studies on early adversity and telo-
mere length as reported in previous reviews of this area (31, 46, 47),
although exceptions of individual studies exist in the literature (40,
41). These findings also support previous pilot work in the HRS that
reported significantly elevated expressions of genes associated with
proinflammation in adults who reported experiencing childhood
social and traumatic adversity (48) and support an eco-biode-
velopmental conceptualization of disease risk (49).
Although adult adversity also predicted shorter telomeres with
8% increased odds of having short telomeres in unadjusted
models in our study, the association was not significant in adjusted
models and thus should be interpreted with caution. Childhood
events may embed epigenetically and alter gene expression almost
permanently (28, 49), although adulthood events are hypothesized
to slowly wear down biological systems (50, 51). Perhaps the
limited number and types of adulthood events available in HRS
could explain the limited impact of adulthood adversity in this study.
Typical life-events measures have a broader range and larger num-
ber of stressful events (for example, ref. 52), whereas our study only
included 7 childhood and 10 adulthood stressors. The HRS does not

The Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) correction for the false-discovery rate requires listing the variables of interest within a set of
analyses in rank order of their P value significance. To calculate the BH correction, each rank order of the P value is multiplied by 0.05
and divided by the number of variables of interest in the set of analyses. If the P value from the analysis is lower than the BH correction
value, then the standard is to accept the rejection of the null hypothesis. Adj., adjusted; N, no; Unadj., unadjusted; Y, yes.

 have information on some potentially relevant adversities in adult-
hood, such as bankruptcy, home foreclosure, and domestic abuse,
and it does not differentiate between intensities of events. It is also
possible that, beyond the type and number of events, the more re-
cent the events, the greater the impact on cell aging. Two recent
studies revealed that the accumulation of major life events over a 1-y
period correlate with shorter telomeres (53) and prospectively pre-
dict shortening over this brief period (39) in adults. In the present
study, recentness of the event was not studied. Finally, the lack of
association in adjusted models between adulthood adversity and the
odds of short telomeres may be partly a result of the covariates in the
models, including the behavioral and health measures.
In the present study, telomere length is considered a marker of
accelerated aging and disease development. Although telomere
biology is widely accepted as a mechanism of aging and disease
pathogenesis in animals, there remains some debate in epide-
miological sciences about the importance of telomeres to human
health and disease, with a range of perspectives on its signifi-
cance as a marker (54), a mechanism (2, 55), or neither (56).
Much of the inconsistent findings in previous studies may be
attributed largely to methodological differences—for example,
smaller sample sizes, a wider range of ages, and varied telomere
length quantification. The effect size of telomere length pre-
dicting disease is likely small, so these differences in study design
would easily obscure effects. Confidence that telomeres are im-
portant to disease pathogenesis is increasing with recent Men-
delian randomization studies demonstrating that genetic variants
associated with shorter telomeres are associated with cardio-
vascular, pulmonary, and Alzheimer’s diseases (23, 24) and a
recent meta-analysis that includes prospective associations be-
tween telomere length and cardiovascular disease (7). Consid-
ering the continued debate, however, there remains a significant
need for more prospective, meta-analytic, and Mendelian ran-
domization studies with nationally representative populations
with other diseases and mortality as outcomes.
The present study has several strengths, including a large na-
tionally representative sample, a wide range of childhood and
adulthood events accumulated across multiple years of data, and
the ability to adjust for critical factors known to affect telomere
length. The randomly selected representative sample of older adults
(age ≥50 y) in the HRS is especially valuable because it allows for
generalization of how cumulative childhood adversity is related to
telomere length among the aged population of the United States
and avoids the bias associated with recruiting a clinical sample or
those with a health condition who would be more likely to have
both early adversity and shorter telomeres.
The present study also has several limitations. As mentioned
previously, the HRS did not have information on some potentially
relevant adversities in adulthood. Of concern is whether retro-
spective measurement of past events, especially of childhood events,
is prone to reporting and recall error (57, 58). Previous studies on
the validity of retrospective reporting from childhood (59, 60)
suggest that people are more likely to underreport early abuse ex-
periences than overreport them. Based on these studies, two
questions that we used, parental substance abuse and physical
abuse, may have been underreported (57). Hardt et al. (60, 61)
concluded that recall bias, however, should have little effect in
studies with clearly defined adverse experiences, which is the case
with the rest of the selected adverse experiences in the current study
(i.e., father unemployment, repeating a school grade, and getting
in trouble with police). Furthermore, recent findings from large
nationally representative studies, including HRS (62), Survey of
Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (63), the Mainz Adverse
Childhood Experiences Study, and the prospective British National
Child Development Study (64) also support Hardt and Rutter’s (60)
general conclusion. These studies find that older adults recalled
childhood health, economic, and traumatic experiences comparably
to rates of experiences reported in either national data or to large
prospective cohort studies that started in childhood with similar
impact on outcomes in adulthood.
Study limitations only allowed the collection of DNA via saliva.
Telomere length in saliva is not commonly studied. Although rich in
immune cells, saliva also has other cell types, such as epithelial
buccal cells, making it a less pure measure of immune cell telomere
length. However, a recent study demonstrated a highly significant
correlation (r = 0.72) between telomere length from saliva and blood
(65). Additionally, a large study with 100,000 participants that used
salivary telomere length as a marker of cell aging found that salivary

 telomere length is associated with aging, health, and mortality (17).
Finally, our results in the sample with all participants pooled across
race and ethnicity were similar to those of the predominant racial/
ethnicity group, non-Hispanic white participants, whereas results in
non-Hispanic black and Hispanic participants were nonsignificant,
perhaps limited by small sample sizes within each group. Considering
these results and the racial and ethnic differences in telomere length
and in exposures to adverse experiences that exist in our and other
studies (66–69), we propose future studies with larger samples within
minority communities to confirm or refute the uniqueness of our
results to non-Hispanic whites.
The HRS is a unique, longitudinal dataset that can allow for the
study of the effect of adverse events across the life course on health
status and behavioral engagement in adulthood. Children may be set
on trajectories of health, in part through the behavioral habits they
formed and in part through the accumulation of exposures that may
cause epigenetic alterations of gene expression and protein synthesis.
Adopting an eco-biodevelopmental framework allows us to under-
stand the long reach of adversity, well into later adulthood, as evi-
denced by the present study. Our findings, if replicated with other
biological and health outcomes, suggest that childhood social
adversity—beyond indices of socioeconomic position (parental
income, employment, and education)—are especially salient to
adulthood health and should be considered as targets for inter-
ventions. For example, our results add to the growing impor-
tance of intervention strategies to reduce parental substance
abuse for lifespan health of children.
Not all children who experience adversity are at similar risk
(28, 70), and investigating resiliency within the context of ad-
versity is emerging as a new frontier in adversity research (71).
Researchers have identified genetic, psychosocial, and behav-
ioral factors that may mitigate or potentiate vulnerability to
adverse experiences, and understanding their complex interplay
will allow us to optimize policy initiatives for interventions for
families, as proposed elsewhere (28, 49, 72), that target those
most at risk for excessive early morbidity and mortality.
Methods
Data. The HRS is an ongoing longitudinal, nationally representative sample of
>26,000 US residents over 50 y of age and their spouses, with survey assessments
every 2 y since 1992. The study is supported by the National Institute on Aging
(NIA; U01 AG009740) and the Social Security Administration. HRS is under In-
stitutional Review Board approval at the University of Michigan and the NIA,
and under no conditions have data been provided to researchers with individual
identifiers or links to individual identifiers. The purpose of the study is to explore
changes in health as individuals transition from employment to retirement and
into old age. Since 1992, HRS has collected information related to financial
health (income, employment, assets, pension plans, and health insurance) and
physical health (disability; health, physical, cognitive, and psychological func-
tioning; health behaviors; and some lifespan stressors). In 2004, HRS researchers
started collecting biological data, and in 2008, a subsample of 5,808 subjects
consented to provide saliva samples (Oragene) for DNA extraction. This DNA was
assessed for telomere length. Sampling weights account for the probability of
respondent selection and cooperation with the DNA request (73).
Lifespan Adversity. Major childhood and adulthood adversity items were asked
across the survey modules. After examining all HRS measures from all waves, we
identified measures that objectively qualified as highly stressful events, such as
those indicative of severe financial difficulties, as well as social and traumatic
events. We considered seven measures of childhood adversity that occurred
before the age of 18, which we summed for childhood adversity (possible range
0–7). We also divided the index into childhood financial adversity (possible range
0–3) and social/traumatic childhood adversity (possible range 0–4). The three
items of childhood financial adversity were asked during survey years 1996–2008.
Respondents could skip these questions if they had already answered in a pre-
vious round. Each measure was coded as a binary variable if the respondent ever
answered (yes/no). For experiences of father’s unemployment, respondents who
never lived with their father or whose father never worked were coded as no.
Measures of social and traumatic childhood adversity were collected in survey
years 2006, 2008, and 2010, although the police question was not asked in 2006.
Respondents could skip these questions if they had answered in a previous

 round. Each item was coded as a binary variable (yes/no). We also created a
cumulative index of adult adversity (maximum 10) and divided these into adult
financial and social/traumatic adversity. Adult financial adversity was constructed
from all available surveys from 1992 to 2008, whereas the social and traumatic
adult adversity items from years 2004–2008. Any report of “yes” at any year of
available data were scored as a 1.
Telomere Length. Mean telomere length was assayed by Telome Health (Telomere
Diagnostics, www.telomehealth.com/) using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Telomere
data were available from 5,808 respondents who provided a saliva sample during
the 2008 wave. We excluded observations with telomeres >2.0 t/s ratio (n = 289),
because these high values are likely to be artifactual in salivary samples. We chose
a binary outcome comparing the lower quartile of telomere length to all higher
values for several reasons. First, we preferred to be consistent with previous large
epidemiological cohort studies examining the association between telomere
length with disease or mortality that use the qPCR method for telomere assays and
categorize telomere length values into dichotomous variables (7, 11, 18). Second,
research on qPCR compared with the flow-FISH method for telomere length
measurement further demonstrates reduced qPCR sensitivity (40%) and specificity
(63%) to detect accurate telomere length at the lowest decile (74). Finally, statis-
tical analyses for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test on random subsamples of
500 participants suggested nonnormality of data for the full sample (n = 5,808),
for the reduced sample with the 289 participants excluded for artificially high
values (n = 5,519), and after log-transformation of the full and reduced data.
Covariates. Covariates were selected for their identification in previous studies as
related to lifespan adversity or telomere length. Demographic characteristics
included a continuous measure of respondent’s age, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other), sex, level of education (less than
high school vs. high school and above), and current partnership status in 2008
(married or partnered vs. other). Health measures, assessed in 2008, included a
continuous measure of BMI, history of smoking (never vs. ever smoked), and
number of medical conditions ever reported (zero, one, two, three, and four or
more). Medical conditions included high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, lung
disease, heart disease, stroke, psychiatric problems, and arthritis (i.e., a sum of
indicators for whether a doctor has ever told the respondent that he or she has
ever had the condition). Depressive symptoms were measured by using the
modified Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD), which
ranged from 0 to 8 in depression severity. Lastly, we included a measure of
father’s education (<8 and ≥8 y), as a proxy of childhood socioeconomic status.
Statistical Approach. We used multivariate logistic regression to investigate the
relationships between the (i) sum scores of cumulative lifespan adversity, and
the differential effects of (ii) childhood and adulthood adversities, (iii) child-
hood financial and social/traumatic adversity, and (iv) adulthood financial and
social/traumatic adversity with the odds of shortened telomere length. All
analyses were corrected for multiple testing by using the false discovery rate
(43, 44). Interactions between childhood and adulthood cumulative adversity
were also examined. All analyses used the svy command prefix in Stata (v12.1,
StataCorp) to adjust for survey weights in the HRS. Because there are known
differences in telomere length by race and ethnicity (66–68), we conducted a
sensitivity analysis to examine the association within each race/ethnic group. In
a separate series of unadjusted and adjusted analyses corrected for the false
discovery rate, we used multivariate logistic regression to investigate the re-
lationship between each individual adversity item with the odds of shortened
telomere length. Although we present results for only observations with telo-
meres 2.0 t/s ratios and shorter, we completed analyses including the 289
participants originally excluded, and results were unaltered. Dataset S1 contains
all data used in the current study.
