SUMMARY
Recent advances in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) differentiation protocols have generated insulin-producing cells resembling
pancreatic b cells. While these stem cell-derived b (SC-b) cells are capable of undergoing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS),
insulin secretion per cell remains low compared with islets and cells lack dynamic insulin release. Herein, we report a differentiation strat-
egy focused on modulating transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) signaling, controlling cellular cluster size, and using an enriched serum-
free media to generate SC-b cells that express b cell markers and undergo GSIS with first- and second-phase dynamic insulin secretion.
Transplantation of these cells into mice greatly improves glucose tolerance. These results reveal that specific time frames for inhibiting
and permitting TGF-b signaling are required during SC-b cell differentiation to achieve dynamic function. The capacity of these cells to
undergo GSIS with dynamic insulin release makes them a promising cell source for diabetes cellular therapy.
INTRODUCTION
Diabetes mellitus is a global health problem affecting over
400 million people worldwide and is increasing in preva-
lence (Mathers and Loncar, 2006; Stokes and Preston,
2017). Diabetes is principally caused by the death or
dysfunction of insulin-producing b cells found within the
islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, resulting in improper
insulin secretion and failure of patients to maintain normal
glycemia, which in severe cases can cause ketoacidosis and
death. Patients are often reliant on insulin injections but
can still suffer from long-term complications, including
retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular
disease (Nathan, 1993). An alternative treatment is replace-
ment of the endogenous b cells by transplantation of
pancreatic islets (Bellin et al., 2012; Hering et al., 2016;
Lacy and Kostianovsky, 1967; Scharp et al., 1990; Shapiro
et al., 2000). While this therapy has had clinical success,
limited availability of cadaveric donor islets largely ham-
pers its widespread application (Bonner-Weir and Weir,
2005).
Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)
into stem cell-derived b cells (SC-b cells) is a promising
alternative cell source for diabetes cell replacement therapy
as well as other applications, such as modeling disease and
studying pancreatic development (Millman and Pagliuca,
2017). Through modulation of pathways identified from
embryonic development, studies with hPSCs have detailed
protocols for generating cells that resemble early endoderm
and pancreatic progenitors (D’Amour et al., 2006; D’Amour
et al., 2005; Kroon et al., 2008; Nostro et al., 2015; Rezania
et al., 2012), the latter of which can be transplanted into
rodents and spontaneously differentiated into b-like cells
after several months (Bruin et al., 2015; Kroon et al.,
2008; Millman et al., 2016; Rezania et al., 2012).
We (Pagliuca et al., 2014) and others (Rezania et al., 2014)
published similar approaches for generating SC-b cells
in vitro that in part use the compound Alk5 inhibitor type
II (Alk5i) to inhibit transforming growth factor b (TGF-b)
signaling during the last stages of differentiation. These ap-
proaches produced SC-b cells capable of undergoing
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in static incu-
bations, expressing b cell markers, and controling blood
sugar in diabetic mice after several weeks. However, even
with this significant breakthrough, these cells had inferior
function compared with human islets, including lower in-
sulin secretion and little to no first- and second-phase insu-
lin release in response to a high glucose challenge, demon-
strating that these SC-b cells were less mature than b cells
from islets. Several follow-up studies have been performed
introducing additional differentiation factors or opti-
mizing the process but have failed to bring SC-b cell func-
tion equivalent to human islets (Ghazizadeh et al., 2017;
Millman et al., 2016; Russ et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2016).
Here we report a six-stage differentiation strategy that
generates almost pure populations of endocrine cells con-
taining b-like cells that secrete high levels of insulin and ex-
press b cell markers. This is achieved by modulating Alk5i
exposure to inhibit and permit TGF-b signaling during
key stages in combination with cellular cluster resizing
and enriched serum-free media (ESFM) culture. These cells
are glucose responsive, exhibiting first- and second-phase
insulin release, and respond to multiple secretagogues.
Transplanted cells greatly improve glucose tolerance in
mice. We identify that inhibiting TGF-b signaling during
stage 6 greatly reduces the function of these differentiated

RESULTS
Differentiation to Glucose-Responsive SC-b Cells
In Vitro
We set out to develop an improved differentiation protocol
starting from the approach we described in Pagliuca et al.
(2014) using the HUES8 cell line. We included Y27632 dur-
ing stages 3 to 4 and activin A during stage 4 as we reported
previously (Millman et al., 2016) to help maintain cluster
integrity and shortened stage 3 from 2 days to only 1 day
to enhance progenitors (Nostro et al., 2015). We also devel-
oped an ESFM for stage 6 to replace the serum-containing
media used previously to have a serum-free protocol.
During our protocol pilot studies, we observed that both
resizing clusters and removal of Alk5i and T3 increased in-
sulin secretion while maintaining the C-peptide+ popula-
tion (Figures S1A and S1B).
Combining these modifications resulted in our six-stage
differentiation protocol outlined in Figure 1A. Stage 6 cells
are grown as clusters in suspension culture (Figure 1B) that
averaged 172 ± 34 mm (mean ± SD; n = 353 individual clus-
ters) in diameter, less than half the diameter of the clusters
before resizing, which was 364 ± 55 mm (n = 155 individual
clusters). Stage 6 clusters stained red for the zinc-chelating
dye dithizone, which stains b cells. Immunostaining of
sectioned clusters revealed most cells to be C-peptide+, a
protein also produced by the INS gene, in addition to
PDX1+ and NKX6-1+, b cell markers (Figure 1C). A subset
of cells stained positive for GCG or were polyhormonal,
staining positive for both C-peptide and GCG. These poly-
hormonal cells are known to not to resemble adult b cells
and are not functional (D’Amour et al., 2006; Hrvatin
et al., 2014).
We tested function of stage 6 cells generated with our dif-
ferentiation protocol using both static (Figures 1D, 1E, and
S1C) and dynamic GSIS assays (Figures 1F and S1D) and
found that not only do the cells secrete insulin but also in-
crease insulin release when moved from low to high
glucose. With static GSIS, while there was some variability,
stage 6 cells increased insulin secretion on average by a fac-
tor of 3.0 ± 0.1 when moved from 2 to 20 mM glucose. This
is an improvement compared with cells generated with the
protocol described in Pagliuca et al. (2014) (1.4 ± 0.1),
referred to here as the Pagliuca protocol, but less than
human islets (3.2 ± 0.1) on average (Figure 1D). Stage 6 cells
from this study did not increase insulin secretion in
response to 5.6 mM glucose but did increase secretion in
response to higher concentrations (11.1 and 20 mM), indi-
cating that the cells are only stimulated at higher glucose
threshold (Figure 1E). In terms of insulin secretion per
cell, stage 6 cells secreted on average 5.3 ± 0.5 mIU/103 cells
at 20 mM glucose, 9.2 ± 1.1 times more than cells generated
with the Pagliuca protocol and 2.3 ± 0.3 times less than hu-
man islets, on average (Figure 1D). It is important to note
that our insulin values with the Pagliuca protocol are
within range of the 2014 report but were lower on average,
with
differentiated
HUES8
reported
to
secrete
0.2–
2.6 mIU/103 cells (average 1.4) and increase secretion by
0.4–4.1 (average 1.7) to high glucose.
With dynamic GSIS, stage 6 cells displayed a rapid first-
phase insulin release within 3–5 min of high glucose expo-
sure, increasing insulin secretion by a factor of 7.6 ± 1.3 to
159 ± 21 mIU/mg DNA, higher than stage 6 cells generated
from the Pagliuca protocol (1.7 ± 0.23 increase to 11 ±
1 mIU/mg DNA) but lower than human islets (15.0 ± 2.43
increase to 245 ± 26 mIU/mg DNA) (Figure 1F). Second-phase
insulin secretion was observed with continued high
glucose exposure, with cells maintaining 2.1 ± 0.3 higher
insulin secretion than the initial low glucose, a higher in-
crease than with the Pagliuca protocol (0.9 ± 0.1) but lower
than human islets (6.7 ± 0.8) (Figure 1F). When the cells
were returned to low glucose, insulin secretion from stage
6 cells returned to a reduced rate. Elevating insulin secre-
tion and displaying first- and second-phase insulin release
to a high glucose challenge are key features of b cell
behavior. Overall, stage 6 cells generated with this differen-
tiation strategy produces cells with clear first- and second-
phase insulin secretion, which was not demonstrated by
Pagliuca et al. (2014) and Rezania et al. (2014) and not
seen with stage 6 cells produced with the Pagliuca protocol.
However, when compared with human islets containing
b cells, these stage 6 cells still have lower insulin secretion
per cell at high glucose, lower glucose stimulation on
average, and slightly slower first-phase insulin release.
To further characterize stage 6 cells generated with our
differentiation protocol, we immunostained cells with a
panel of pancreatic islet markers (Figures 2A–2C and S2).
The vast majority of cells expressed CHGA (96% ± 1%), a
pan-endocrine marker, and most cells expressed C-peptide
(73% ± 3%) (Figure 2). These fractions are higher than in
stage 6 cells generated with the Pagliuca protocol (Figure S2)
and reported in Pagliuca et al. (2014). Many C-peptide+
cells
from
both
protocols
expressed
other
markers
found in b cells and expression of the other pancreatic
hormones was observed (Figures 2 and S2). The majority
of C-peptide+ cells expressed NKX6-1 (Figure 2) and were
monohormonal, which we presumed to be the SC-b cell
population as done previously (Pagliuca et al., 2014). The
fraction of C-peptide+ cells not expressing another hor-
mone was increased compared with stage 6 cells generated
with the Pagliuca protocol and reported in Pagliuca et al.
(2014), while the fraction of these cells expressing another

 hormone was comparable (Figures 2 and S2). These data
show that stage 6 cells generated with our differentiation
strategy are predominantly pancreatic endocrine with the
majority expressing C-peptide.
We measured expression of several genes compared with
stage 6 cells generated with the Pagliuca protocol and
human islets (Figures 2D and S3). Many islet and b cell
genes were increased compared with the Pagliuca protocol,
including INS, CHGA, NKX2-2, PDX1, NKX6-1, MAFB,
GCK, and GLUT1. Interestingly, LDHA and SLC16A1, disal-
lowed b cell genes, had reduced expression in our stage 6
cells compared with both the Pagliuca protocol and human
islets (LDHA) and the Pagliuca protocol (SLC16A1). Our
stage 6 cells had increased expression of CHGA, NKX6-1,
MAFB, GCK, and GLUT1 compared with human islets.
However, INS, GCG, SST, and particularly MAFA and
UCN3 had reduced expression compared with stage 6 cells.
However, several recent reports have provided evidence
that question the utility of MAFA and UCN3 in evaluating
human SC-b cell maturation. MAFA expression is low in
juvenile human b cells (Arda et al., 2016). MAFB is ex-
pressed in human but not mouse b cells (Arda et al.,
2016; Tritschler et al., 2017; Xin et al., 2016). UCN3 expres-
sion is much higher in mouse than human b cells (Xin
et al., 2016) and is also expressed by human a cells (Baron
et al., 2016; Tritschler et al., 2017). These data show that
our stage 6 cells have improved gene expression for many
markers compared with the Pagliuca protocol and, while
the expression of several b cell markers are equal to or great
than human islets, other markers remain low.
Transplantation of SC-b Cells into Glucose-Intolerant
Mice
To evaluate the functional potential of stage 6 cells in vivo,
we first transplanted cells under the renal capsule of non-
diabetic mice and evaluated the ability of the graft to
respond to a glucose challenge (Figure 3A). We observed
that,
even
after
extended
time
post-transplantation
(6 months), the grafts responded to a glucose injection by
increasing human insulin by a factor of 1.9 ± 0.5. Excision
and immunostaining of the transplanted kidneys revealed
C-peptide+ cells that tended to be clustered together in
addition to other pancreatic endocrine and exocrine
markers (Figures 3B and S4A). To more rigorously evaluate
stage 6 cells in vivo, we transplanted a separate mouse
cohort that had been chemically induced to be diabetic
with streptozotocin (STZ) and evaluated function at early
(10 and 16 day) and late (10 week) time points. After only
10 days post-transplantation, STZ-treated mice receiving
stage 6 cells had greatly improved glucose tolerance
compared with STZ-treated sham mice and had similar
glucose clearance as the non-STZ-treated mice (Figures 3C
and 3D). Measurements of human insulin 16 days after
transplantation revealed high insulin concentrations that
increased by a factor of 2.3 ± 0.6 with a glucose injection
to 16.6 ± 3.1 mIU/mL (Figure 3E). These values are greater
than what was reported in Pagliuca et al. (2014) under
similar conditions, which had an insulin increase of 1.4 ±
0.3 and concentration of 3.8 ± 0.8 mIU/mL. Observing
our cohort 10 weeks after transplantation revealed similar
results as the 10- and 16-day data, with transplanted mice
having greatly improved glucose tolerance (Figures 3F
and 3G) and glucose-responsive insulin secretion (Fig-
ure 3H). Mice not receiving STZ had similar glucose toler-
ance as mice receiving a therapeutic dose of human islets
(Pagliuca et al., 2014). Mice that did not receive stage 6 cells
had undetectable human insulin and mice that received
STZ had drastically reduced mouse C-peptide compared
with non-STZ-treated mice (Figures S4B and S4C). Grafts
from these STZ-treated mice contained cells that expressed
b cell markers in addition to other endocrine and exocrine
markers (Figure S4D). Overall these data demonstrate that
stage 6 cells generated with our protocol are functional
both at early and late time points in vivo, greatly improving
glucose tolerance to equal that of non-STZ-treated mice.
Characterization of SC-b Cell Dynamic Function
Since the differentiation protocol produces cells that are
capable of dynamic insulin secretion, we studied this
phenotype in more detail. We performed dynamic GSIS
on cells as they progressed through stage 6 (Figure 4A).
We observed that robust dynamic function was transient,
with cells at 5 days secreting low amounts of insulin and
exhibiting weak first- and second-phase response, with
later time points (9–26 days) secreting higher amounts of
insulin with a clear first- and second-phase response.

 During this time, the fraction of C-peptide+ cells decreased
slightly (Figure S5A). By 35 days, insulin secretion at low
glucose had risen such that first and second phases were
difficult to clearly identify. These data show that SC-b cells
require 9 days in stage 6 to acquire dynamic function, this
function persists for weeks, but after extended in vitro
culture glucose responsiveness is lost. Similarly, cadaveric
human islets are known to have a limited functional life-
time in vitro, but the cause of this is not clear. These data
further suggest an optimal time frame for these cells to be
used in transplantation and drug-screening studies.
To further characterize dynamic insulin secretion, we
performed perifusion experiments to assay whether SC-b
cells could respond to sequential challenges with several
known secretagogues (Figure 4B). After an initial high
glucose challenge, SC-b cells were able to respond to a
second high glucose-only challenge, albeit less strongly
than the first challenge, and extending the first glucose
challenge to 1 hr in a separate experiment did not reduce
insulin secretion (Figure 4C). Addition of other secreta-
gogues during the second challenge further increased
insulin secretion (Figure 4B). Membrane depolarizers KCl
and L-arginine had the largest increases. Tolbutamide
(blocks potassium channel), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine
(IBMX) (raises cytosolic cAMP), and exendin-4 (agonist of
GLP-1 receptor) also increased insulin secretion over high
glucose alone. Not only was insulin secretion increased
but it rose faster than with high glucose alone. However,
we noted that the response of stage 6 cells to KCl challenge
was stronger than in human islets (Figure S5B), an observa-
tion made by others comparing b-like cells to human islets
(Rezania et al., 2014), possibly indicative of continued
immature or juvenile b cell phenotype. Taken together,
these data show that SC-b cells can respond to several secre-
tagogues that have diverse modes of action and have
potential application in drug screening.
Role of TGF-b Signaling in SC-b Cell Differentiation
and Maturation
After having evaluated SC-b cells generated with our proto-
col, we investigated the protocol changes that were made
to gain insights into SC-b cell differentiation and matura-
tion. We found that, while inclusion of Alk5i during stage
6 resulted in relatively weak but statistically significant
GSIS in a static assay, similar to data from the Pagliuca pro-
tocol (Figure 1D), omission of Alk5i drastically increased
insulin secretion and glucose stimulation (Figures 5A and
S6A). Insulin content also increased with removal of
Alk5i during stage 6 (Figure 5B), but the proinsulin/insulin
ratio remained similar (Figure 5C), suggesting that the
increased insulin content is not due to hormone process-
ing. Furthermore, the fraction of cells expressing pancre-
atic endocrine markers, including C-peptide, remained
similar between DMSO- and Alk5i-treated cells (Figures
5D, 5E, and S6B). Gene expression was similar overall
with and without Alk5i treatment, with cluster resizing
typically having a larger effect (Figure S6C). Cells treated
with Alk5i during stage 6 also had dramatically reduced
insulin secretion with the dynamic GSIS assay, displaying
weak to no first- and second-phase response (Figure 5F),
similar to cells generated with the Pagliuca protocol (Fig-
ure 1F). These data show that Alk5i treatment during stage
6 inhibits functional maturation of SC-b cells.
Our studies with Alk5i during stage 6 suggested that
permitting TGF-b signaling was necessary for robust func-
tional maturation of SC-b cells, as inhibition of TGFBR1
is the canonical function of Alk5i. To test this hypothesis,
we first used western blot analysis to validate that TGF-b
signaling was occurring in our stage 6 cells via SMAD phos-
phorylation (Figure 6A). Alk5i treatment diminished phos-
phorylated SMAD, confirming that TGF-b signaling was
indeed occurring and inhibited by Alk5i. SMAD phosphor-
ylation was observed in stage 6 clusters regardless of
whether they were resized, consistent with observations
that Alk5i treatment reduced GSIS regardless of resizing
(Figure S7). Next, we generated two lentiviruses carrying
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) designed to knock down
TGFBR1 (TGFBR1 no. 1 and no. 2). These viruses were
capable of reducing TGFBR1 transcript compared with con-
trol virus targeting GFP in stage 6 cells (Figure 6B) and
reduced SMAD phosphorylation (Figures 6C and S7C),
albeit to much lesser extent than Alk5i treatment (Fig-
ure 6A). Similar to Alk5i treatment (Figures 5A and 5F),
stage 6 cells transduced with shRNA against TGFBR1 had
reduced insulin secretion and reduced positive glucose
responsiveness in the static GSIS assay (Figure 6C) and
blunted glucose response in the dynamic GSIS assay (Fig-
ure 6D). These data show that permitting TGF-b signaling
during stage 6 is important for SC-b cell functional matura-
tion, which is inhibited by treatment with Alk5i.
Finally, we studied the role of Alk5i during stage 5 of dif-
ferentiation to evaluate its effects on differentiation toward
pancreatic endocrine cells, as it had been used previously
for endocrine induction (Millman et al., 2016; Pagliuca
et al., 2014; Rezania et al., 2014; Russ et al., 2015; Zhu
et al., 2016). These experiments were performed as outlined
in Figure 1A in the presence or absence of Alk5i. We
observed that the fraction of cells differentiated to endo-
crine cells (CHGA+) was unchanged but the fraction of cells
differentiated to a C-peptide+ phenotype was decreased by
omitting Alk5i (Figures 7A–7C). Similarly, the fraction of
cells co-expressing C-peptide and NKX6-1, an important

 (Figure 7D). Expression of NKX6-1 and PDX1 were reduced
without Alk5i (Figure 7E), while expression of several
pancreatic endocrine markers were either unchanged or
only slightly changed (Figure 7F). To further test the impor-
tance of Alk5i during stage 5, cells treated with or without
Alk5i during stage 5 were further cultured for 7 days in stage
6 without Alk5i nor cluster resizing, and insulin secretion
was substantially higher in cells treated with Alk5i during
stage 5 (Figure 7G). Taken together, these data show that
Alk5i treatment during stage 5 positively influences specifi-
cation to b-like cell fate, not necessary to specify endocrine
cells, and is necessary for high insulin secretion of resulting
SC-b cells. In addition, these observations illustrate the
importance of stage-specific treatment of the TGF-b

mature SC-b cells.
DISCUSSION
Here we demonstrate that enhanced functional maturation
of SC-b cells is achieved with our six-stage differentiation
strategy. These cells secrete a large amount of insulin and
are glucose responsive, displaying both first- and second-
phase insulin release. This differentiation procedure gener-
ates almost pure endocrine cell populations without
selection or sorting, and most cells express C-peptide and
other b cell markers. Upon transplantation into STZ-treated
mice, glucose tolerance is rapidly restored and function
persists for months. These SC-b cells respond to multiple
secretagogues in a perifusion assay. We found modulating
TGF-b signaling to be crucial for success, with inhibition
during stage 5 increasing SC-b cell differentiation but
inhibition during stage 6 reducing function and insulin
content. Permitting TGF-b signaling during stage 6 was
necessary for robust dynamic function.
Even though the protocols reported previously by us (Pa-
gliuca et al., 2014) and others (Rezania et al., 2014) both
generated b-like cells with much greater function and bet-
ter marker expression than prior reports (Hrvatin et al.,
2014), robust first- and second-phase insulin release in
response to glucose stimulation was not observed. Both
protocols inhibited TGF-b signaling during the final stage
of differentiation, and many subsequent reports also
include inhibitors of TGF-b signaling without demon-
strating proper dynamic function (Ghazizadeh et al.,
2017; Millman et al., 2016; Song and Millman, 2016; Sui
et al., 2018; Vegas et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2016; Zhu
et al., 2016). However, a major observation of the current
study is that correct modulation of TGF-b signaling during
key cell transition and maturation steps is critical for
successful differentiation to functional SC-b cells, with
permitting TGF-b signaling being required for improved
functional maturation during stage 6.
SC-b cells in this report were able to control glucose in
STZ-treated mice rapidly within 10 days. Prior reports
with in-vitro-differentiated b-like cells without demon-
strated
robust
dynamic
function
have
successfully
controlled blood sugar with a glucose tolerance test or
demonstrated glucose-responsive serum human insulin/
C-peptide in mice after several weeks or months (Millman
et al., 2016; Pagliuca et al., 2014; Rezania et al., 2014; Vegas
et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016), but our SC-b cells had higher
measured human insulin levels compared with Pagliuca
et al. (2014) with equal cell numbers transplanted. Vegas
et al. (2016) did demonstrate reduced blood glucose within
a week but did not test glucose tolerance or measure human
insulin until much later. Currently, a key limitation in dia-
betes cell replacement therapy is the need for sustainable
source of functional b cells (Weir et al., 2011), and

 improving the quality of SC-b cells to be transplanted helps
overcome this challenge (Tomei et al., 2015). Transplanta-
tion of immature pancreatic progenitor cells are an alterna-
tive cell type that has shown promise in rodents, where
some cells undergo in vivo maturation to b-like cells after
several months (Bruin et al., 2015; Kroon et al., 2008;

 Millman et al., 2016; Rezania et al., 2012). However, the
mechanism is unknown, and how successful the process
would be in humans is not clear, especially since the effi-
ciency between rats and mice is very different (Bruin
et al., 2015). Our process for making SC-b cells is scalable,
with the cells grown and differentiated as clusters in
suspension culture. The use of clusters in suspension cul-
ture allows flexibility for many applications, such as large
animal transplantation studies or therapy (order 109 cells)
(McCall and Shapiro, 2012; Shapiro et al., 2006) or study-
ing patient cells and disease pathology (<108 cells) (Kudva
et al., 2012; Maehr et al., 2009; Millman et al., 2016; Shang
et al., 2014; Simsek et al., 2016; Teo et al., 2013).
Our strategy enhances the utility of in-vitro-differentiated
SC-b cells for drug screening due to their improved kinetics.
Proper dynamic insulin release is an important feature of
b cell metabolism that is commonly lost in diabetes
(Caumo and Luzi, 2004; Del Prato and Tiengo, 2001; Seino
et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2001). We have established a
renewable resource of SC-b cells with dynamic insulin
release that can be used to better study the mechanism of
b cell failure in diabetes and demonstrated their response
to several secretagogues.
The culmination of numerous modifications to the pro-
tocol produced SC-b cells exhibiting dynamic glucose
response. In addition to modulating TGF-b signaling, other
notable changes included the removal of serum, reducing
cluster size, and the lack of several additional factors (T3,
N-acetyl cysteine, Trolox, H1152, and R428) used in other
reports during the last stage. We hope that these insights
provide the basis for further innovations for differentiating
SC-b cells and improving function, especially as a recent
report indicates there may be multiple pathways to b cells
(Petersen et al., 2017). While we demonstrate reproduc-
ibility of the protocol across multiple cell lines, marker
expression and function were greatest in the HUES8 cell
line. As this protocol was initially developed for this line,
we suspect additional optimization to be beneficial when
applying this protocol to additional lines.
Even with these functional improvements over previ-
ously published SC-b cells, islets averaged higher insulin
secretion and glucose stimulation, particularly second-
phase release. These differences are more pronounced
when comparing the best human islets in this dataset,
which secreted 21 mIU/103 cells and had stimulated insulin
increase of 11, to the best stage 6 cells, which secreted
9 mIU/103 cells and had a stimulated increase of 5, in static
assays. Our stage 6 cells had reduced average insulin secre-
tion at low glucose in static assays, but elevated insulin
secretion at low glucose in perifusion assays compared
with islets on average, perhaps due to paracrine differences.
Comparisons with islets were complicated due to donor-to-
donor variation, which has been observed previously (Kay-
ton et al., 2015; Lyon et al., 2016; Pagliuca et al., 2014). We
do note that islets in our study were typically more func-
tional than in other studies (Ghazizadeh et al., 2017;
Pagliuca et al., 2014; Rezania et al., 2014; Russ et al.,
2015; Sui et al., 2018), which we believe is important to
rigorously benchmark SC-b cells. In addition, some islet
genes remain underexpressed in our cells. Furthermore,
while the data we generated with the Pagliuca protocol
were within the range of data presented in the 2014 report,
we acknowledge that the static GSIS values were lower on
average, likely due in part to technical differences in how
the assays were performed. Another potential contributor
is batch-to-batch variability, as stated in the 2014 report,
which could be caused by the use of different lots of serum
during stage 6 and was eliminated in our protocol. Even
with these difficulties and insights, we acknowledge that
even further maturation of SC-b cells is possible, building
on this report and the original 2014 breakthroughs.
This study provides insights into the role of TGF-b
signaling in functional maturation. Prior reports are un-
clear on this topic, with some showing TGF-b inhibition
to benefit (Lin et al., 2009) and others to harm (Totsuka
et al., 1989) secretion. Inhibition has been shown to pro-
mote replication (Dhawan et al., 2016), protect against
stress-induced loss of phenotype (Blum et al., 2014; Mill-
man et al., 2016), and reduce apoptosis in a GLIS3
knockout model (Amin et al., 2018). Interestingly, we also
observed that removal of Alk5i during stage 5 does not
affect the overall percentage of cells expressing CHGA,
but influences the expression of INS, GCG, and SST, sug-
gesting a role in TGF-b signaling in endocrine subtype spec-
ification. It is important to note that we did not identify the
downstream effectors of TGF-b signaling responsible for
the reported phenotypes, and further study is warranted.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Culture of Undifferentiated Cells
Undifferentiated hPSC lines were cultured using mTeSR1 in 30-mL
spinner flasks on a rotator stir plate spinning at 60 rpm in a humid-
ified 5% CO2 37�C incubator. Cells were passaged every 3–4 days
by single-cell dispersion.
Cell Line Differentiation
To initiate differentiation, undifferentiated cells were single-cell
dispersed and seeded at 6 3 105 cells/mL in a 30-mL spinner flask.
Cells were cultured for 72 hr in mTeSR1 and then cultured in the
differentiation media for 6 stages outlined in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures, except where otherwise noted. Cells
were resized the first day of stage 6 by incubating in Gentle Cell
Dissociation Reagent and passing through a cell strainer. Assess-
ment assays were performed between 10 and 16 days of stage
6 unless otherwise stated.

 Static GSIS
Clusters were incubated at 2 mM glucose for a 1 hr equilibration in
a transwell. The transwell was then drained and transferred into a
new 2 mM glucose well, incubated 1 hr (first challenge), then trans-
ferred into a solution of 2, 5.6, 11.1, or 20 mM glucose (second
challenge), incubated 1 hr, and then normalized by cell count
and insulin quantified with ELISA.
Dynamic GSIS
A perifusion system was assembled as reported previously (Bentsi-
Barnes et al., 2011). Stage 6 clusters and islets were assayed with
effluent collected at a 100-mL/min flow rate every 2–4 min, exposed
to the indicated secretagogues, including glucose, Extendin-4,
IBMX, tolbutamide, L-arginine, and KCl. After sample collection,
DNA and insulin were quantified.
Transplantation Studies
All animal work was performed in accordance to Washington Uni-
versity International Animal Care and Use Committee regulations.
Mice were injected with �5 3 106 stage 6 cells under the kidney
capsule (Pagliuca et al., 2014) and monitored up to 6 months by
performing glucose tolerance tests and in vivo GSIS.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance was calculated using GraphPad Prism using
the indicated statistical test. Slope and error in slope was calculated
with the LINEST function in Excel. Data shown as mean ± SEM
unless otherwise noted or box-and-whiskers showing minimum
to maximum point range, as indicated. n indicates the total num-
ber of independent experiments.
