Gaze stabilization is an almost ubiquitous animal behaviour, one that is required to see the
world clearly and without blur. Stomatopods, however, only fix their eyes on scenes or objects
of interest occasionally. Almost uniquely among animals they explore their visual environ-
ment with a series pitch, yaw and torsional (roll) rotations of their eyes, where each eye may
also move largely independently of the other. In this work, we demonstrate that the torsional
rotations are used to actively enhance their ability to see the polarization of light.
Both Gonodactylus smithii and Odontodactylus scyllarus rotate their eyes to align particular
photoreceptors relative to the angle of polarization of a linearly polarized visual stimulus,
thereby maximizing the polarization contrast between an object of interest and its
background. This is the first documented example of any animal displaying dynamic
polarization vision, in which the polarization information is actively maximized through
rotational eye movements.

any animals go to great lengths to stabilize their gaze,
using eye, head and body movements to avoid motion
blur1. Blowflies2, pigeons3, crabs4,5 and cats6 are a few
diverse examples of animals from distinct orders known to do
this. In these examples gaze stabilization enhances the ability to
both detect objects, especially those occupying a small area of the
visual field, and to estimate relative motion within a visual scene7.
In addition, by stabilizing gaze, an animal can maintain its
orientation relative to a local horizon4 or other salient landmark.
The head, body or eye movements employed as gaze stabilization
mechanisms in all of the above examples are reactive, products of
the vestibular-ocular and optokinetic reflexes1.
Three types of rotation, pitch, yaw and torsional (roll), are all
used as eye movements to stabilize an animal’s gaze. Torsional
rotations are most relevant for animals with lateral eyes, such as
ungulates and lagomorphs, whose modes of locomotion involve
considerable angular displacements of the head. In such species,
large head rotations are compensated by correspondingly large
counter-rotations of the eyes8,9. In humans, and other animals
with frontal eyes, stabilizing eye movements are more evident in
the pitch and yaw planes of rotation relative to the head’s
principal axes1,10,11. Nevertheless, small involuntary torsional
(also referred to as cyclotorsional) eye movements can still occur
in these animals depending on the rotations of the head or
body12–17. Small (o5�) torsional rotations have also been
reported after horizontal saccades18 and during vergence19,20 in
human subjects. These torsional rotations are thought to be
secondary consequences of the action of ocular muscles.
While all these motions are reactive behaviours, there is one
animal group that exhibits very unusual and particularly large
pitch, yaw and torsional eye rotations as a proactive strategy
during visual search. Stomatopods (commonly known as mantis
shrimps) are an unusually inquisitive group of stalk-eyed
crustaceans with an extensive repertoire of eye movements. With
these large ranges of pitch, yaw and torsional rotations, their eyes
can exhibit coordinated or independent tracking21, object of
interest acquisition through saccades22 and scanning motions1,23.
Of these eye motions, particularly noteworthy are the proactive
torsional rotations of up to 90� (refs 23,24); (Fig. 1a–d), which
again can be either coordinated or completely independent as
required21,23,24 (Fig. 1c,d).
In addition to their intricate eye movements, stomatopods also
have
an
extraordinarily
complex
visual
system
and
the
structure of their eyes is especially unusual. Each of their
apposition compound eyes is divided into three sections: two
hemispheres bisected by a narrow linear midband two or six
ommatidial
rows
wide
(depending
on
the
species)25,26–30
(Fig. 1b). Particular to each of these three sections are intra-
retinal adaptations to the basic photoreceptor anatomy, which
have enabled stomatopods to evolve regional specializations
for both linear and circular polarization vision25,31,32, as well as
12-channel colour vision32–34. In the six row midband of
Odontodactylus
scyllarus
and
Gonodactylus
smithii,
the
photoreceptors of the top four rows are regionally specialized
for colour vision, while rows five and six are specialized for
polarization vision25,31,32. In some species, rows five and six also
show adaptations
for circular polarization
sensitivity. The
proximally placed ultraviolet-sensitive R8 cells can act as
quarter wave plates35, converting circularly polarized light into
linearly polarized light, which can then be analysed by the
underlying R1-7 cells. Stomatopods have also evolved an array of
visual
signals
that
contain
both
polarization
and
colour
information. In the context of their eye movements, Land
et al.23 demonstrated that O. scyllarus also possess a scanning-like
motion in which the eyes perform relatively slow pitch rotations
(40� s � 1) as scans in a plane approximately perpendicular to the
mid-band,
theoretically
providing
two-dimensional
colour
information by scanning a one-dimensional row of assigned
colour channels. This sequential analysis is equivalent to man-
made ‘push broom’ spectral sensors. Importantly, the slow speed
of these scans differentiates these movements from typical visual
saccades.
While eye-scanning movements suggest a functional link
between the stomatopod’s eye anatomy and colour vision, the
reasons behind the extensive torsional rotations of the eyes
remain unknown. One possibility is that these rotations are linked
to the animal’s polarization vision. Typically, in most polarization
vision systems, the animal is unable to vary the orientation of
their polarization receptors relative to a signal in a controlled
manner. Torsional eye movements could, in principle, allow
stomatopods to rotate the position of a group of polarization-
sensitive microvilli to maximize the information available from a
polarized scene25,36,37. In analogy, this is comparable to rotating a
piece of Polaroid filter in front of a camera to find the best angle
to reduce polarized glare.

 We therefore hypothesize that any torsional rotations that
occur when a stomatopod visually inspects a polarized stimulus
would act to align the closest group of microvilli in the
hemispheres relative to the polarization angle of the stimulus,
thereby maximizing the perception of the polarization signal.
This effectively acts to maximize the polarization contrast.
Alignment of the closest group of microvilli requires the least
ocular torsion and is therefore likely to be dynamically and
energetically most efficient. In the set of experiments reported
here we test this prediction and ask three questions: (1) Do
stomatopods rotate their eyes in response to a linearly polarized
stimulus? (2) Do they align specific photoreceptors relative to the
polarization of that stimulus? and (3) Do the rotations maximize
the polarization distance (PD) of the signal versus the back-
ground? To answer these questions, we track in three dimensions
the eye movements of two species of stomatopod, G. smithii
and O. scyllarus.
Results
Microvilli angles. To understand how torsional eye rotations
affect polarization vision in a stomatopod, it is important to learn
how changes in eye position alter the orientation of sets of
microvilli within the photoreceptors. The dorsal and ventral
hemispheres of the stomatopod eye have typical crustacean
photoreceptors with layered, interdigitating, orthogonal projec-
tions of microvilli (Fig. 2a–d). Because the highest receptor sen-
sitivity occurs when the angle of polarization is oriented parallel
to the long axis of the microvilli25,38,39, the rhabdom of each
ommatidium has two polarization-sensitive channels, with peak
sensitivity
to
perpendicular
orientations
of
the
angle
of
polarization25,27–30.
However,
across
the
whole
eye
the
orientations of these two channels differ between the dorsal and
ventral hemispheres, with the microvillar orientations of each half
of the eye offset by 45� (Fig. 2e). As a result, in the two
hemispheres there are four sets of microvilli in total with their
maximum sensitivities separated by 45�, and as a consequence, an
eye is never more than 22.5� away from aligning one group of
microvilli with a specific angle of polarization. The periodic
nature of this functional alignment suggests that any eye only has
a single effective angle (j) through which it must rotate to line up
any of the four groups of microvilli with the stimulus. This
effective range is 0�rjr22.5�, where j ¼ 0� corresponds to
perfect alignment (Fig. 2e). At perfect misalignment, all four
orientations of the microvilli in either hemisphere are oriented at
an effective angle of j ¼ 22.5� away from the angle of polarization
of the stimulus (Fig. 2f).
Measuring polarization distance. To quantify the level of the
polarization signal that may be detected by the animal, we used
the framework developed by How and Marshall40 to calculate
values of PD for both the dorsal and ventral receptor pairs
(see Methods for a full derivation). In analogy with the concept of
colour distance in a colour space, PD provides a quantitative
measure of the perceived contrast between two polarization
states
for
a
model
visual
system.
A

polarization
distance indicates a greater level of perceived polarization
contrast between two stimuli. Unlike colour distance, PD may

 be maximized by torsional rotation of the receptors and their
physical alignment with the angle of polarization of a stimulus.
In this context it is important to consider the polarization
environment of stomatopods in their natural habitat and how
rotating the eye could maximize the PD of, for example, polarized
signals against the unpolarized body parts of conspecifics.
Underwater scenes vary in the background level of polarization.
Typically, the benthic substrate reflects very little polarization
(o5%), while the underwater space light tends to be linearly
polarized between 10 and 50% depending on both the sun’s
overhead position and the water clarity41. Therefore, the
polarization of inter- and intra-specific visual signals are
commonly
viewed
against
either
unpolarized
or
partially
polarized
backgrounds
(that
is,
if
the
signal
is
viewed
against the benthos or against open water, respectively)31,42–45.
A key consideration here is that the torsional position of the
eye required to maximize the PD depends on both the
polarization of the background and of the stimulus. When the
background is unpolarized, the maximum PD occurs when a
group of microvilli are aligned parallel to the polarization angle of
the stimulus. However, if the background is polarized at an angle
different to the stimulus, then the position of maximum PD
occurs when elements of a pair of receptors are each aligned as
closely as possible to the angle of both the background and
stimulus polarization. This leads to the prediction that, if an
animal is using the torsional rotations to maximize the perceived
PD then it will not simply align the microvilli with the
polarization angle of the stimulus, but with the angle of the
predicted maximum PD.
Eyes rotate torsionally in response to linearly polarized stimuli.
G. smithii rotated their eyes in response to a single polarized light
stimulus (Fig. 3a,b). Six wild-caught G. smithii were each
shown eight presentations of a short duration (3 s) green LED
stimulus (wavelength of maximum emission ¼ 501 nm) with a
high percentage of linear polarization (d ¼ 99.5%), seen through a
4 mm aperture in an opaque black screen and the movements of
their eyes were tracked using a stereo camera system. The angle of
polarization was either vertical (w ¼ 0�), or diagonal (w ¼ 45�),
with four trials of each. Since the two eyes of the stomatopod
display a high degree of independence11,23, only data from the eye
that reacted to the stimulus first was used in the analysis. The
rotational responses were averaged across all four trials for each
of the six animals. An initial torsional rotation of 15� (mean, 95%
confidence
intervals
10–20�, n ¼ 6) was observed,
with a
rotational
speed
of
45±8� s � 1
(mean±s.d.,
n ¼ 6).
The
response rate was 83.33%. Secondary rotations of the eyes after
the initial response to the stimulus were also measured and these
were typically lower in amplitude (E5�).
Torsional rotations orient hemisphere microvilli. To analyse
whether the perceived polarization contrast increased during
these rotations, we calculated the PD between receptor pairs in
both the dorsal and ventral hemispheres before and during the
LED stimulus for both stimulus angles (w ¼ 0�and w ¼ 45�). Based
on the mean variance in these experimental data, we also calcu-
lated a model data set (using a bootstrap resampling method) that
represents an optimal alignment to maximize the PD. Before
stimulus onset the PD was significantly different from the
resampled model maximum PD values (Fig. 3c,d; repeated mea-
sures analysis of variance (RMANOVA), F ¼ 16.9, d.f. ¼ 1,
P ¼ 0.001). However, during presentation of the stimulus the PD
increased such that there was no longer a difference from the
model maximum PD distribution (Fig. 3d: RMANOVA, F ¼ 5.4,
d.f. ¼ 1, P ¼ 0.132). When viewing the stimulus, G. smithii
significantly increased the PD by aligning one group of microvilli
with the predominant angle of polarization of the linearly
polarized stimulus (RMANOVA, F ¼ 9.5, d.f. ¼ 1, P ¼ 0.012).
The angle of the polarization of the stimulus (w ¼ 0� or w ¼ 45�)
was not a significant factor in any of the above measures

 (RMANOVA, Fo2.7, d.f. ¼ 1, P40.160) and there was no
preference for maximizing the PD in either the dorsal or ventral
hemispheres (binomial test, P ¼ 0.636). Importantly, the torsional
rotations did not act to maximize the PD in the photoreceptors of
rows five and six of the midband (RMANOVA, F ¼ 0.053,
d.f. ¼ 1, P ¼ 0.821) and the response was not dependent on the
angle of the polarization (RMANOVA, F ¼ 0.748, d.f. ¼ 1,
P ¼ 0.400). Given the 501-nm wavelength of the stimulus, the role
of the ultraviolet-sensitive R8 cells was not considered.
Torsional rotations maximize the polarization contrast. The
first experiment demonstrated that the torsional rotations of the
eyes align the closest group of microvilli to the angle of a bright,
polarized stimulus viewed against a dark unpolarized back-
ground, which consequently maximizes the PD. However, if the
background is also bright and linearly polarized, aligning the
effective angle with the polarization of the stimulus does not
necessarily provide the greatest polarization contrast within the
image. In such a situation, the maximum PD between the object
of interest and the background would be achieved by orienting a
pair of orthogonal microvilli so that one set is as close as possible
to the background angle, and the other as close as possible to the
stimulus angle. This optimum angle is also modulated in a pre-
dictable way by contrasts in degree of polarization between the
stimulus and the background (see Methods for mathematical
explanation of this theory). We investigated the response of
stomatopods to polarized stimuli viewed against a differently
polarized background to determine whether they use torsional
rotations to maximize the polarization contrast.
Six O. scyllarus were presented with expanding circular
looming stimuli displayed on an LCD monitor, which had been
modified following the methods of How et al.46 to display
polarization contrasts with no associated intensity contrasts. In
addition, the inbuilt fluorescent light source of the monitor was
removed, along with the plastic back of the monitor, and replaced
with a back projecting bank of LEDs with a peak emission
of 501 nm. As a result, different pixel values (on the RGB scale of
0–255) had different polarization characteristics, but a uniform
colour and intensity. Animals were presented with a looming
disc, which rapidly expanded (2.2 m s � 1) from a single pixel to
occupy a visual angle of 10�. The byte value of the pixels of the
foreground circle were set to generate a difference in the angle of
polarization of 61.2� between the circle and the background.
From the angular rotations of the eyes, we again calculated the
effective angles of the microvilli in each hemisphere and the
associated PD (Fig. 4a–c). Based on the variance in the
experimental data, we calculated a resampled bootstrap popula-
tion of optimum rotation angles to maximize PD, against which
to compare our data. As in the first LED experiment, the eye
position was significantly different from the resampled maximal
PD values before the onset of the stimulus (Fig. 4d; RMANOVA,
F ¼ 8.6, d.f. ¼ 1, P ¼ 0.010). In response to the stimulus, the eyes
rotated such that the PD no longer significantly differed from the
resampled maximal PD distribution (Fig. 4d; RMANOVA,
F ¼ 0.3, d.f. ¼ 1, P ¼ 0.688). During these rotations, O. scyllarus
torsionally rotated their eyes to significantly increase PD after
stimulus onset (Fig. 4d: RMANOVA, F ¼ 7.6, d.f. ¼ 1, P ¼ 0.009).
These experiments were performed with the screen at three
different tilt angles (0�, 6� and 14�), and in none of the above
measures was tilt angle a significant factor (RMANOVA, Fo1.4,
d.f. ¼ 1, P40.254). In 15 out of 18 trials, the PD was maximized
in the ventral hemisphere, and in the dorsal hemisphere in the
other three trials; a significant difference associated with an
apparent five-fold dominance in the ventral hemisphere (bino-
mial test, P ¼ 0.008). Moreover, the torsional rotations did not act
to increase the PD in the photoreceptors of rows five and six of
the midband (RMANOVA, F ¼ 2.281, d.f. ¼ 1, P ¼ 0.143) and the
response was not dependent on the screen angle (RMANOVA,
F ¼ 0.760, d.f. ¼ 1, P ¼ 0.391). It should be noted that the
response rate of the animals during this experiment was 100%.
To further test whether the rotations aligned the eyes with
either the maximum PD value or the polarization angle of the
stimulus, we calculated a second set of data using the bootstrap
method for the angle of polarization of the stimulus (Fig. 4d,
white dots). Before the onset of the stimulus, the eye position was

 not significantly different from the PD values representing an
alignment with the stimulus angle (Fig. 3h; RMANOVA, F ¼ 1.74,
d.f.¼ 1, P ¼ 0.234). During the stimulus presentation however, the
rotations of the eye created an alignment that was significantly
different (RMANOVA, F ¼ 40.3, d.f.¼ 1, Po0.001). Therefore, we
can conclude the rotations occur to maximize the PD of the signal
against the background and not to simply align the closest
microvillar group to the angle of polarization of the stimulus.
Discussion
We have shown that two species of stomatopod, G. smithii and
O. scyllarus exhibit torsional rotations of their eyes in response to
linearly polarized stimuli; the first species to a single source of
linear polarization, and the second to a pattern of polarization. In
each experiment, the animals chose to maximize the polarization
signal in one receptor pair. In the first experiment, PDmax was
achieved by aligning the closest microvillar group with the angle
of polarization of the stimulus, viewed against a dark unpolarized
background. In the second experiment, the eye did not align with
the angle of polarization of either the foreground or background,
but to the torsional angle that maximized the contrast between
the two. While the two experiments were carried out with
different species, both G. smithii and O. scyllarus demonstrate the
fundamental principle of enhancing polarization vision using
dynamic torsional rotations. It is unlikely, given similarities
between the eye morphology and the agonistic lifestyle of the two
species that a behavioural hierarchy exists.
The concept of dynamic polarization vision has been discussed
previously in the literature in the context of navigation using sky
polarization
patterns37,47.
For
example,
the
dung
beetle
Scarabaeus rugosus has been observed performing rotational
dances on top of its dung ball before it attempts to roll away from
the central heap and such whole-body movements could be
involved in modulating the polarization signals received by the
eye’s dorsal rim area48. Similarly, it has been suggested that while
navigating using the sky polarization pattern, desert ants
perform whole-body rotational movements to scan the celestial
hemisphere, serving a similar function49. However, to our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of dynamic polari-
zation vision mediated by eye movements, and it is particularly
interesting
given
its
potential
involvement
in
contrast
enhancement for object detection and discrimination tasks.
One of the interesting findings of this work is the discovery
that it is the hemispheres that play a key role in driving rotational
eye movements, rather than the midband. In these two reported
experiments, we found that the rotations did not increase the
polarization contrast of the polarization sensitive photoreceptors
in rows five and six of the midband as one perhaps would have
expected based on the weight of the literature concerning
midband polarization sensitivity in stomatopods. A puzzling
aspect of the stomatopod eye is the 45� offset in microvillar
alignment between the dorsal and ventral hemispheres. In all
species in the Squilloidea, Lysiosquilloidea and Gonodactyloidea
superfamilies examined, the orientation of the orthogonal pairs of
microvilli from retinular cells R1-7 is rotated by 45� between the
dorsal and ventral hemispheres, such that the microvilli are
projected in four discreet directions across the eye in regions
outside of the midband25. This differs from the compound eyes of
every other crustacean studied to date, which have microvilli
projected in two orthogonal directions only38,50,51. As with many
features of the stomatopod eye, it seems unnecessary to have this
added level of complexity, given that the eye can rotate over a
range of 90� to adjust the orientation of the underlying receptors.
One possible explanation for this architecture is that the
hemispheres have large areas of overlap in their visual fields,
particularly in the area of highest acuity. When investigating
objects of interest, both sets of hemisphere receptors will receive
visual inputs at the same time. If one hemisphere is oriented
maximizing the polarization contrast, then the other hemisphere
will be maximally misaligned with the stimulus (by default
because of the 45� offset). At maximal misalignment, the
hemisphere’s receptors effectively receive no polarization infor-
mation. As a result, the two hemispheres could then supply two
independent
channels
of
information,
the
former
about
polarization
and
the
latter
about
intensity.
In
this
way,
stomatopods may have found an elegant method of avoiding
confounds between the two visual dimensions of information.
A second and perhaps more plausible explanation is that this
anatomy enables the animal to find the optimal polarization
signal
more
quickly
and
unambiguously
than
a
simple
two-channel system. The 45� offset in receptor organization
could speed the acquisition of the optimum polarization signal by
reducing

0�ojo22.5�, while minimizing the energetic cost of eye
movements. This arrangement also removes the problem of null
points of discrimination37,40,51, as at least one pair of receptors
will always detect some relevant contrast from polarization cues.
Given the fast-pace and hazardous nature of inter- and intra-
specific interactions, this type of polarization vision could be
particularly beneficial in the context of communication between
individual
mantis
shrimps,
particularly
given
that
many
species employ strongly linearly polarized body patterns for
signalling41,42,44.
However, as an eye is never more than 22.5� away from
an optimal alignment to maximize the viewed polarization
contrast in the hemispheres, the extent of larger 90� range of
rotations remains puzzling and suggests there may be another
role for this large rotational range. The directions of the scanning
movements involved in colour and circular polarization vision are
in some way guided by visual features of the scene, and so
torsional eye rotations could also serve to orient the eye for
subsequent
scans
that
involve
yaw
and
pitch
motions.
Nevertheless, it must be noted that polarization may also be
included as a visual feature of the scene, so may bias the scan
orientation in some way.
In summary, the dynamic polarization vision system of mantis
shrimps is yet another example of an exquisite and unique
adaptation to visual perception in these crustaceans and such
findings could prove useful for developing bio-inspired technol-
ogy in the field of polarization cameras and image processing.
However, there are still a number of questions about this
remarkable
polarization
vision
system
that
remain
to
be
investigated, such as how do these animals determine which set
of receptors (dorsal or ventral) to align with the stimulus?; how is
the information processed downstream within the optic neuropil
and beyond?; and how, if at all, is information combined from the
two eyes?
Methods
Adult G. smithii (carapace lengths varying between 40 and 70 mm) were collected
by hand net during daylight hours from Coconut Reef, Lizard Island, Australia
under Marine Parks permit G12/35042.1. Animals were held separately in small
aquaria containing artificial burrows made from 20 mm diameter opaque plastic
piping. Aquaria were illuminated with fluorescent lamps under a 12:12 h light:dark
cycle and water was provided via the flow-through sea-water system at the Lizard
Island Research Station (LIRS). Adult O. scyllarus (carapace lengths varying
between 90 and 150 mm) were purchased from the marine trade (Tropical Marine
Centre, Bristol, UK) and held in a self-contained salt-water aquarium facility at the
University of Bristol under similar conditions. All experiments were conducted in
accordance with University of Bristol, LIRS and University of Queensland codes of
ethics for animal experimentation.
Animals were lightly restrained using monofilament nylon fishing line
wound around their thorax (avoiding restriction of the gills) within an

 artificial burrow (opaque flexible hose piping, diameter ca. 20 mm)
with their heads and eyes protruding (Fig. 5a,b). They were placed in
an experimental aquarium facing the stimulus and allowed to settle for
10–15 min.
Visual stimuli. Animals were presented with two types of stimulus in separate
experiments.
LED experiment. A green LED with a wavelength of peak emission at 501 nm
(HLMP-CE34-Y1CDD, Avago Technologies, California, USA) was mounted
behind a matt black card surface with a 4-mm diameter aperture (Fig. 5a).
The LED wavelength was chosen to be near to the peak sensitivity of the
photoreceptors in the stomatopod hemispheres26. A 20-mm square of linearly
polarizing filter (American Polarizers, Reading, USA) combined with a diffuser
(Teflon, DuPont, Delaware, USA) was mounted between the LED and the card
aperture, so that the light transmitted through the aperture was close to 100%
linearly polarized over the emission range of the LED. A microcontroller
(Arduino Uno, Ivrea, Italy) connected to the MATLAB Arduino IO package
(Mathworks, Massachusetts, USA) was used to control the LED. Each of six
individual G. smithii was subjected to eight trials, consisting of a 5-s pre-stimulus
period, followed by 3 s of LED on, and then 5 s of post stimulus. In four of the
trials the angle of polarization was oriented vertically (w ¼ 0�), and in the other
four trials the orientation was diagonal (w ¼ 45�). These two balanced treatments
were shown in random order for each individual tested, with a randomly selected
interval of between 45 and 90 s.
Monitor experiment. A Viglen (VL-15EC6, Viglen, UK) LCD monitor was
modified by removing the front polarizer using the method of How et al.46, to
produce polarization contrasts on the screen with no associated intensity
contrasts (when viewed from a position orthogonal to the screen’s surface). The
inbuilt broadband fluorescent light source was removed and replaced with a
back-projecting bank of 501 nm peak emission LEDs (as used in the LED
experiment). A looming stimulus (generated using Psychtoolbox52,53) in which a
disc rapidly (2.2 m s � 1) expanded from a single pixel to a diameter of 35 mm
(visual angle of 10�) was displayed to six O. scyllarus. The byte values of the
pixels of the looming circle and the background were chosen such that they were
matched in intensity differing by o0.2% across the visual range. The pixels of the
background and circle matched both in ellipticity, e, and the degree of
polarization, d. The angle of polarization, w, was set as shown in Table 1. Each
animal was presented with six trials: three controls (in which looming stimulus
pixels were of an equal value to the background) and three looming circle stimuli
with pixel values as shown in Table 1. To test whether O. scyllarus use torsional
rotations to improve contrast, rather than rotate to some preferred midband
position, each of the three stimuli were presented with the screen tilted at three
different angles: 0�, 6� and 14� (Fig. 5c).
Eye tracking. During each trial, a stereo-camera system consisted of two video
camcorders (Panasonic HC-X900, Osaka, Japan) recording the three-dimensional
movement of both eyes. The two video camcorders, recording with a frame rate of
50 frames per second were mounted ca. 0.5 m above the experimental tank using a
stereo camera mount and tripod. The focus of both cameras was set manually to
maintain a fixed focal distance. Cameras were controlled using a single remote
control and video recordings were synchronized to single video frame accuracy by
the illumination of a 630-nm pilot LED positioned so as not to be visible to the
animal. Small (2 � 2 mm square) tracking markers of white waterproof paper
(Tyvek, DuPont, Delaware, USA) were fixed to the animals’ eye stalks with
cyanoacrylate glue (Fig. 5b). In all cases, animals were allowed to acclimatize to the
markers for several hours before trials. Patterns on the markers consisted of four
small points arranged in a cross, the position-of-which could be tracked auto-
matically, frame-by-frame, for the duration of each trial.
A series of calibration images featuring checkerboards (8 � 10 squares) were
used to calibrate the two camcorders to form a stereo pair (method modified from
Bradski et al.54). Consequently, the location of the cameras with respect to the
experimental apparatus could be determined and the distorting lens effects
removed. The three-dimensional coordinates of a point visible in both of the
cameras forming the stereo pair was determined using the pixel coordinates of that
point in each of the camera’s images and the transformation matrix computed
during the calibration stage. Refraction effects caused by the water surface were
incorporated using a mathematical correction based on the water depth and Snell’s
law. The relative positions of the markers were then used to calculate the three-
dimensional position of the eyes. Torsional rotations of the eye were determined
with an approximate measurement error of ±3�. This error was calculated during
development of the method by comparing the calculated torsional poses with the
actual poses of an artificial eye to which a set of tracking markers were attached.
For analysis purposes, only one eye per animal was included in either data set and,
if both eyes responded to the stimulus, the data relating to the eye that moved first
were used.

Polarization distance, PD, is an estimate of the polarization contrast between an
object and its background as viewed by a model polarization vision system40.
Roughly analogous to colour distance, PD calculates the level of contrast between
two polarized stimuli based on a given photoreceptor arrangement.
Mathematically, PD is proportional to the absolute difference between the
opponency signals generated by the object, Oo and the background, Ob,
PD ¼ Oo � Ob

where Sp is the polarization sensitivity of the photoreceptor37. The maximum PD
does not necessarily correspond to alignment with either the foreground or
background polarization, but a compromise determined by the degree and the
angular difference between the two, as given in equation (3).
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were conducted in R 3.0.2 (ref. 55).
Using the bootstrap method56 (n ¼ 10,000), normal distributions of virtual data
(rtnorm, base package) with the same variance as the experimental values from
‘before’ and ‘during’ were calculated to represent the maximum PD values, and
additionally for the LCD experiment, the PD when the closest group of microvilli
would be aligned with the angle of polarization of the stimulus. Analyses used a
repeated measure ANOVA test.
