Abstract 
The relationship between diet and acne is highly controversial. Several studies during the last decade have led 
dermatologists to reflect on a potential link between diet and acne. This article presents the latest findings on 
a potential impact that diet can have on pathogenesis of acne vulgaris. The association between diet and acne 
can no longer be dismissed. Compelling evidence shows that high glycemic load diets may exacerbate acne. Dairy 
ingestion appears to be weakly associated with acne and the roles of omega-3 fatty acids, dietary fiber, antioxi-
dants, vitamin A, zinc and iodine remain to be elucidated. The question of what the impact of diet is on the course 
of acne vulgaris still remains unclear.  
Key words: acne, diet, dairy, glycemic index, glycemic load, omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, vitamin A, iodine, dietary fiber.
Introduction
Acne vulgaris is a multifactorial dermatosis which 
occurs most often during puberty. Its pathogenesis is 
very complex and can be caused by many factors. The 
disease is characterized by seborrhea and formation of 
comedones, pustules and papules in areas rich in seba-
ceous glands [1, 2]. There is a huge variety of clinical acne. 
There are patients who have only few blackheads and 
patients with the general skin involvement, with pustu-
lar deep lesions, abscesses and scarring, and, though it 
rarely occurs, even with the involvement of the joints, as 
in the case of acne fulminans. Acne vulgaris can occur 
in a few forms: acne comedonica, which is dominated 
by open and closed comedones, acne papulopustulosa, 
which is dominated by the inflammatory process and 
acne conglobata, which is the most severe form of acne 
and except the changes mentioned above, it is character-
ized with abscesses, fistulas and scars [3].
Acne vulgaris is one of the most commonly occur-
ring skin conditions in the world. Relatively little is 
known about its epidemiology despite the fact that acne 
is almost a universal condition in younger people. The 
prevalence of the disease is difficult to estimate because 
lighter variants of acne are not presented to the derma-
tologists and are often cured with the use of domestic 
methods. This dermatosis is more common in developed 
countries than in less industrialized regions of the world. 
It is less common in African-Americans and Asians than 
in the Caucasian population. Acne lesions are present in 
almost all people at some period of their life. Acne may 
occur in prepubertal children (it is usually comedogenic), 
infants (it usually disappears after three months) and 
most frequently in the early teenage years, when pro-
duction of sebum begins and first blackheads appear and 
can later turn into inflammatory lesions. Both women 
and men are affected by acne equally, however, a severe 
form often appears in men, probably due to the influ-
ence of hormones. During puberty everyone has more or 
less severe acne, which usually resolves spontaneously 
in early adulthood. Sometimes dermatosis lasts until the 
fourth decade of life or even during lifetime [4]. In large 
studies performed in the United States, France and Great 
Britain, acne is still among the first three most common 
skin diseases in the general population [4–6].
Acne vulgaris is a multifactorial dermatosis [1]. Nowa-
days it is shown that acne is caused by different factors 
such as increased production of sebum, the release of 
inflammatory mediators in the skin, hyperkeratosis and 
colonization by anaerobic Propionibacterium acnes (cory-
nebacteria) [7]. Moreover, the factors contributing to the 
formation of acne also include genetic predispositions, 
hormonal abnormalities (androgens play the key role),

immunological disorders, psychological, environmental 
and even iatrogenic factors [8, 9]. It is believed that diet 
may play a role in pathogenesis of acne vulgaris and 
some products may have an effect on the course of this 
dermatosis [10].
Aim of the study
The role of diet in the course and treatment of acne 
vulgaris raises many questions and doubts, therefore the 
aim of the present study is to check and discuss the ef-
fects of selected dietary factors on the course of acne 
vulgaris. Those factors are milk and dairy products, choc-
olate, glycemic load of the diet, dietary fiber, fatty acids, 
antioxidants, zinc, vitamin A and iodine.
Milk and dairy products
The first studies on this issue have been conducted 
in the 40s of the last century, however until today there 
has been no conclusive evidence that milk and dairy 
products have comedogenic effects. The probable cause 
of possible comedogenic effects of milk and its products 
is the content of hormones produced by cows during 
pregnancy. It is believed that the constituent of milk that 
mostly stimulates the pilosebaceous unit is insulin-like 
growth factor 1 (IGF-1), whose concentration in the blood 
varies depending on the severity of acne [11]. Insulin-like 
growth factor 1 levels increase during puberty under the 
influence of the growth hormone and it positively corre-
lates with the clinical course of acne. Receptors for IGF-1 
are located in keratinocytes in the epidermis and are 
single, transmembrane receptors that are responsible for 
the tyrosine kinase activity. In acne patients, a positive 
correlation between concentrations of IGF-1, dehydro-
epiandrosterone sulfate, dihydrotestosterone, the num-
ber of acne lesions and sebum secretion was observed. 
Insulin-like growth factor 1 stimulates 5α-reductase in 
adrenal glands and gonads, androgen synthesis, the an-
drogen receptor signal transduction, sebocytes prolifera-
tion and lipogenesis [12]. The highest concentrations of 
IGF-1 are found in women with acne and the number of 
acne lesions positively correlates with the plasma levels 
of IGF-1 [12, 13]. High plasma levels of IGF-1 which are 
caused by consumption of milk, stimulates proliferation 
of sebocytes, resulting in the development and progres-
sion of acne lesions [13]. Decrease in fasting insulin and 
postprandial insulin and IGF-1 reduces the production of 
sebum and keratinocyte proliferation thereby reducing 
the number of acne lesions. Insulin-like growth factor 1 
increases sensitivity of the adrenal gland to adrenocorti-
cotropic hormone and induces the expression and activ-
ity of key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of adrenal 
androgens [12]. Insulin-like growth factor 1 also stimu-
lates the synthesis of androgens by ovaries and testicles 
and inhibits hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding 
globulin (SHBG), which in effect increases bioavailability 
of androgens. Both IGF-1 and androgens stimulate se-
bum production, which is one of the pathogenic factors 
of acne formation [14].
Acne is influenced not only by hormones but also by 
the biochemical relationship between them and the pi-
losebaceous unit. Thus, adding exogenous hormones de-
rived from the diet to the pool of endogenous hormones 
may have a significant impact. Milk that is available in 
stores is not only rich in placenta-derived progesterone 
but also other precursors of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 
such as 5α-pregnanedione and 5α-androstanedione. 
These compounds are easily enzymatically modified 
to DHT and the enzymes required for this process are 
available in the pilosebaceous unit [15]. In vivo endog-
enous testosterone is converted via 5α-reductase to 
DHT, which stimulates the pilosebaceous unit. However, 
DHT can be produced without 5α-reductase from exog-
enous 5α-reduced molecules. Milk contains 5α-reduced 
steroids, which are precursors of DHT. Both testosterone 
precursors and 5α-reduced molecules are thought to con-
tribute to the comedogenicity of milk. They work by stim-
ulating production of sebum and inducing hyperkeratini-
zation of the pilosebaceous unit [14]. Modified precursors 
enter the pilosebaceous unit and demonstrate a strong 
stimulating effect, for which humans are not evolution-
ary prepared. However steroid hormones contained in 
the milk are not the most important factor [15]. Many 
studies have shown that skim milk is more comedogenic 
than whole milk. It is believed that during the produc-
tion of skim milk there are changes in the bioactivity of 
biologically active molecules such as glucocorticoids and 
transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), hormones similar 
to thyrotropin and opiates and there are changes in their 
interactions with binding proteins. There is also a possi-
bility that the hormonal balance of skim milk may be im-
paired. As a result, consumption of skim milk may cause 
increased comedogenesis. Moreover, in order to maintain 
the proper consistency of skim milk manufacturers add 
to it whey proteins, such as α-lactoalbumin, which role 
in comedogenesis is also not negligible [16]. 
In 2005, Adebamowo et al. examined the alleged con-
nection between milk and dairy consumption and acne 
in a cohort, retrospective study of almost 50 thousands 
women [17]. They were asked to recall their high school 
diet using a validated food frequency questionnaire. 
Subjects were also asked if they ever had physician-diag-
nosed severe acne. The authors found that acne was pos-
itively associated with a reported quantity of milk ingest-
ed, particularly skim milk. The authors speculated that 
bioavailability of comedogenic components may increase 
during manufacturing of skim milk. Skim milk contains 
less estrogen than whole milk. Estrogen is a hormone 
that may reduce acne. Adebamowo et al. also showed 
a positive correlation between acne and consumption of 
breakfast instant products and cottage cheese. It is an 
effect of cow’s milk content in those products [14, 17].

Significance of diet in treated and untreated acne vulgaris 
83
In 2006, Adebamowo et al. conducted another co-
hort, prospective 3-year observation study. It included 
more than 6,000 girls aged from 9 to 15 years. A positive 
correlation between the consumption of milk with dif-
ferent fat content and the occurrence of acne vulgaris 
was shown [14]. In 2008, Adebamowo et al. conducted 
a prospective study that included more than 4,000 boys. 
A positive correlation between consumption of skim milk 
and acne vulgaris was shown [18].
In another study of 44 patients with acne, a positive 
correlation between the occurrence of acne and an in-
creased consumption of milk and ice cream was dem-
onstrated [19].
Chocolate
Chocolate has always been considered as a factor 
that may contribute to exacerbation of acne, but there is 
a very limited amount of evidence supporting its nega-
tive impact on the skin. Dermatologists often observe 
that patients have new pimples a few days after inges-
tion of products containing chocolate [16].
In a study of Greek students aged 13–18 years, 66% 
of respondents mentioned chocolate as an acne aggra-
vating factor [20]. In Fulton et al. study, 30 teenage boys 
and 35 adult males participated. Subjects were divided 
into two groups. One group was ingesting chocolate bars 
that contained 10 times more cocoa than standard candy 
bars, while the second group was consuming a bar that 
did not contain cocoa. No difference in the composition 
of sebum between two groups was observed and thus no 
association between consumption of chocolate and ag-
gravation of acne lesions was found. Similarly in a study 
by Anderson, researchers created two groups of patients, 
one of which was given daily chocolate. Only one third of 
respondents consuming chocolate have developed new 
pathological lesions. However the results were not con-
clusive because of the additional ingredients contained 
in bars eaten by subjects. Studies on the effect of choco-
late on the skin condition are controversial and inaccu-
rate because of additional ingredients (milk, sugar, etc.) 
in bars and other products [14]. In 2011, the “Journal of 
American Academy of Dermatology” published a study, in 
which subjects consumed chocolate. Significant changes 
in severity of acne occurred among respondents after 
a single ingestion of chocolate. This allowed the authors 
to hypothesize that chocolate can exacerbate acne le-
sions [21]. However there is no information about the 
type of chocolate consumed by subjects and the percent-
age of cocoa in consumed samples, which can influence 
results. Dark chocolate contains more antioxidants than 
milk chocolate, which would lead to conclusion that it 
may have much smaller comedogenic effects. However 
this issue still remains unclear. As to the question of 
whether chocolate aggravates acne lesions, there is still 
no clear answer [16, 21].
Glycemic index
It is believed that glycemic load and glycemic index 
of whole diet may participate in pathogenesis of acne 
vulgaris. The most vulnerable is consumption of products 
based on their high values. Diet based on products with 
a high glycemic index leads to hyperinsulinemia. Elevated 
insulin levels stimulate the secretion of androgens and 
cause an increased production of sebum, which plays 
a fundamental role in pathogenesis of acne vulgaris [16, 
22]. Hyperinsulinemia affects the level of circulating IGF-1 
and insulin-growth factor binding protein (IGFBP-3), which 
directly affect keratinocyte proliferation and apoptosis. In 
hyperinsulinemia, the level of IGF-1 increases whereas the 
level of IGFBP-3 decreases, what leads to an imbalance. 
As a result, keratinocyte proliferation increases. Insulin-like 
growth factor 1 influences comedogenic factors such as 
androgens, growth hormone and glucocorticoids. It has 
been shown that androgens increase the endogenous 
levels of IGF-1 in blood and this increases further level of 
androgens. A vicious circle is thus created in effect con-
tributing to an increased production of sebum [17, 18, 
23]. Studies on the effects of diet on acne vulgaris have 
shown that occurrence of acne is lower in rural and non-
industrialized areas than in Western populations [23]. It is 
believed that it may be a result of differences between gly-
cemic loads of diets of both populations. In 2002, Cordain 
et al. conducted a study among two non-Western popula-
tions – the Kitavan Islanders of Papua New Guinea and the 
Aché hunter-gatherers of Paraguay. Among approximately 
1300 subjects, no cases of acne were reported. Cordain 
 
et al. suggested that the absence of acne in these societ-
ies may have been a direct consequence of their diets [14, 
24]. Both populations subsist on low glycemic load diets 
devoid of Western refined foods such as cereals, chips, 
cookies and bread [14]. The diet of the Kitavan people con-
sisted of tubers, fruits, fish, and coconuts. Intake of dairy 
products, coffee, alcohol, cereal, sugar, oils and salt was 
minimal [20]. The diet of the Aché community included 
locally cultivated foods (69%, including sweet manioc, 
peanuts, maize and rice), wild game (17%), Western foods 
(8%, containing mainly pasta, flour, sugar, yerba tea and 
bread), domestic meat (3%) and gathered forest products 
(3%) [14]. Researchers suggested that a low fat intake and 
low glycemic load diet may be the cause of acne absence 
in both populations [24]. In a further publication, in 2003, 
Cordain et al. demonstrated that diet-induced hyperinsu-
linemia leads to cascade of endocrine system responses 
which may affect development of acne through the ac-
tion of androgens, IGF-1, IGFBP-3 and retinoid signaling 
pathways [25]. The authors emphasized the importance 
of diet leading to hyperinsulinemia and indicated that it 
may be a risk factor in the development of acne by af-
fecting proliferation of epidermis in hair follicle, hyperke-
ratinization and androgen controlled sebum secretion. 
The study lacked a control group which would consume 
Western foods. Absence of acne in these populations could

be conditioned by genetic and environmental factors [14]. 
However an epidemiological study conducted by Schaefer 
in 1971, who studied native Inuit population living in north-
ern Canada for almost 30 years [26] and subsequent Ben-
diner’s reports [27] showed that in this population there 
was no case of acne when they lived and were fed in a tra-
ditional way [22]. It was only after introduction of Western 
habits, such as an increased consumption of sweet soda, 
beef, dairy products and processed foods, acne lesions 
were diagnosed in the Inuit population [20]. Similar con-
clusions were reached by Thiboutot and Strauss, who de-
scribed a case of young women from Ireland. They claimed 
that they did not present any acne lesions until migration 
from rural areas of Ireland to the United States [28]. An-
other study highly important in this field is investigations 
conducted among inhabitants of rural areas of Kenya [29], 
Zambia [30] and Bantu in South Africa [31]. Researchers 
observed much fewer cases of acne in inhabitants of these 
areas than in people from these regions living in Great Brit-
ain and the United States. In a study conducted in a small 
Brazilian village – Purus Valley, among school children, 
acne vulgaris was detected in 2.7% of all respondents [32].
Kaymak et al. investigated the relationship between 
acne and glycemic load and index, insulin sensitivity and 
blood plasma levels of IGF-1 [33]. It has been demonstrat-
ed that in the serum of acne patients, higher IGF-1 levels 
and significantly lower IGFBP-3 levels occurred in com-
parison to healthy patients. Moreover, as assessed on 
the basis of an intake questionnaire, acne patient’s diet 
had a significantly higher glycemic index than healthy 
patient’s diet [20].
The exception to the finding, that high glycemic load 
diet may contribute to occurrence of acne, is dairy prod-
ucts. They have a relatively low glycemic index, but para-
doxically they increase the IGF-1 level in blood plasma [20].
Results of studies mentioned above suggest that high 
glycemic index diet may have a significant effect on the 
occurrence of acne vulgaris.
Dietary fiber
There are no clinical studies that clearly illustrate 
the effect of dietary fiber intake on the course of acne 
vulgaris. In Kaufman study, in which patients with acne 
vulgaris consumed daily 30 g of high fiber breakfast ce-
real (13 g fiber/serving), a significant improvement in the 
skin condition was shown [34]. In Smith et al. study, after 
introduction of a low glycemic load diet, improvement in 
the skin condition was noticed. Researchers suggested 
that it could be an effect of large amounts of dietary fiber 
in this kind of diet [35].
Fatty acids
The ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids resulting 
from diet is one of the factors that modulate the inflam-
matory mechanism. A high intake of omega-3 fatty acids 
can inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines 
which can have a therapeutic effect on acne vulgaris [14]. 
Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is widely known as a substance that 
regulates sebum production. Omega-3 fatty acids, and 
particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) derived from fish 
oils and γ-linolenic acid (GLA) which is a part of borage oil, 
inhibit conversion of arachidonic acid into LTB4. Every pi-
losebaceous unit has ability to produce pro-inflammatory 
substances, including LTB4, using substances that come 
from decomposition of fat originated from diet. Fish oil, es-
pecially EPA can inhibit production of LTB4 and prevent in-
flammatory processes, although researchers do not clearly 
report a beneficial impact of fish oil on acne vulgaris [36, 
37]. Omega-3 fatty acids have ability to lower IGF-1 levels, 
which also suggests that they may have a beneficial effect 
in treatment of acne [14].
A study conducted in 1961 in North Carolina among 
over 1000 teenagers showed that people who consume 
large amounts of fish and seafood, have less symptoms 
of acne (blackheads, papules, pustules, oily skin) [38]. 
A small study of 5 patients, published in 2008, showed 
that among patients who consumed dietary supple-
ments based on omega-3 fatty acids (it consisted of: EPA, 
selenium, zinc and chromium) a reduced number of acne 
lesions was observed [36].
Antioxidants
Reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils 
participate in inflammatory progression of acne. Reactive 
oxygen species are normally removed by cellular antioxi-
dants such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 
catalase, both of which are presented in small quanti-
ties in patients with acne. It has been suggested that 
oxidative stress may be implicated in the origin of acne 
and that drugs with antioxidant effects (or antioxidant 
supplements) may be valuable adjuvants in acne treat-
ment [14].
In 2008, El-Akawi et al. conducted a study compar-
ing blood levels of lipid-soluble antioxidants (vitamin A 
and E) in 100 patients with acne and in 100 healthy 
control subjects without acne. They found that patients 
with acne had significantly lower plasma concentrations 
of these antioxidants as compared with the control sub-
jects [39]. Low levels of blood selenium have also been 
documented in patients with acne. Because the seleni-
um-dependent glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity 
is low in patients with acne, it is possible that selenium 
supplementation may be of value in acne [14]. In a study 
of 47 women and 42 men with acne vulgaris it has been 
shown that after 12-week supplementation of vitamin E 
and selenium, the skin condition improved [40]. A study 
of hamsters has shown that catechins found in green tea 
inhibit sebum production [41] and that nobiletin, a flavo-
noid with antioxidant properties (which is found in the

juice of Citrus depressa, popular in China and Japan), in-
hibits lipogenesis and proliferation of sebocytes and se-
bum production [42]. Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in 
the skins of red grapes, red wine, peanuts and mulberries 
may be another promising antioxidant therapy for acne. 
In vitro, resveratrol has been shown to have bactericidal 
activity against Propionibacterium acnes, which plays an 
important role in the pathogenesis of acne [43].
Studies mentioned above are crucial to support the 
theory of the positive role of antioxidants in acne thera-
py, but effects of these substances in course of this dis-
ease are not yet fully explored.
Zinc
Zinc is a micronutrient that is essential for the devel-
opment and functioning of the human skin. It has been 
shown to be bacteriostatic against Propionibacterium 
acnes, to inhibit chemotaxis and to reduce production 
of pro-inflammatory cytokine – tumor necrosis factor α 
(TNF-α) [44].
In early studies on the influence of zinc on human 
skin conducted by Michaelsson and Fitzherbert in 1970’s, 
it has been shown that acne improved with oral zinc 
supplementation in zinc-deficient patients [45, 46]. Later 
studies have confirmed that patients with acne often are 
deficient in zinc [47, 48] and its oral supplementation has 
a positive effect on treatment of acne vulgaris [49–55]. 
However, the oral doses of zinc used in the majority of 
studies (400–600 mg zinc sulfate/day), were associated 
with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea [49, 50, 54, 56]. Gas-
trointestinal side effects can be reduced by consuming 
zinc directly after meals. Because zinc reduces absorp-
tion of copper, copper supplementation may be recom-
mended in patients on chronic zinc therapy to prevent 
copper deficiency [14].
Vitamin A
Vitamin A is a group of compounds which can be 
found in both animal and plant products. Retinol and its 
derivatives are found mainly in products of animal origin, 
while products of plant origin contain mainly provitamin A 
(carotenoids). Its main sources are milk and dairy prod-
ucts, eggs, liver, fish and oils derived from them. Vitamin A 
is a fat-soluble vitamin stored in the liver [57].
A study conducted in 1998 by Kligman et al. showed 
that oral supplementation of vitamin A (retinol) is effec-
tive in acne treatment when used in high doses (300 000 
U/day for women and 400 000–500 000 U/day for men). 
The only observed side effects are xerosis and cheilitis [58].
Iodine
Iodine is a nutrient that is essential for the proper 
organism functioning. Acne that occurs after ingestion 
of foods rich in iodine appears suddenly and is charac-
terized by many papules. It has been hypothesized that 
the association between acne and milk may be a result 
of the iodine content of milk which can vary with time of 
year, location, supplementation of animal feed and use 
of iodophor-sanitizing solutions [14].
Summary
The impact of diet on the course of acne vulgaris is 
still a very controversial subject, but can no longer be 
overlooked. Although the link between dairy intake and 
acne is less convincing than that between a high gly-
cemic diet and acne, both deserve consideration when 
providing any dietary advice. The roles of antioxidants, 
omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, vitamin A, dietary fiber and io-
dine in the course of acne remain unclear. Despite all the 
results of the studies mentioned in the article, derma-
tologists will benefit by careful listening to their patients. 
If a patient notes an association between a particular di-
etary factor and acne severity, he should be instructed 
to exclude it from diet or limit its consumption. Doctors 
should encourage patients to write in a food diary which 
dietary factors produce acne flare-up. Influence of diet 
on severity of acne vulgaris still requires a lot of research 
but it should be no longer a dermatologic dogma to state 
that any association between diet and acne is a myth.
