ABSTRACT
Purpose. To determine if routine eye examinations in asymptomatic patients result in spectacle prescription change, new
critical diagnosis, or new management of existing conditions. We also investigate whether age and time between as-
sessments (assessment interval) impact detection rates.
Methods. The Waterloo Eye Study (WatES) database was created from a retrospective file review of 6397 patients seen at the
University of Waterloo Optometry Clinic. Significant changes since the previous assessment (significant change) were defined as
a change in spectacle prescription, presence of a new critical diagnosis, or a new management. Significant change, assessment
interval, and age were extracted from the database for all asymptomatic patients presenting for a routine eye examination. The
frequency of patients with significant change and the median assessment interval were determined for different age groups.
Results. Of 2656 asymptomatic patients, 1078 (41%) patients had spectacle prescription changes, 434 (16%) patients had
new critical diagnoses, 809 (31%) patients had new managements, and 1535 (58%) patients had at least one of these
(significant change). Median assessment intervals were 2.9 and 2.8 years for age groups 40 to G65 years and 20 to G40 years,
respectively, approximately 1.5 years for patients 7 to G20, and between 1 and 1.5 years for patients G7 or 964. Controlling
for assessment interval and sex, increasing age was associated with having a significant change (OR = 1.03, 95% CI
1.029Y1.037). Similarly, controlling for age and sex, increased assessment interval was associated with having a significant
change (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.02Y1.11).
Conclusions. In asymptomatic patients, comprehensive routine optometric eye examinations detect a significant number of
new eye conditions and/or result in management changes. The number detected increases with age and assessment interval.

G
ood vision and eye health are essential components to a
person’s quality of life.1Y5 As well, the economic burden
of vision loss has been shown to be significant.6,7 Com-
prehensive routine eye examinations (REE) are believed to play a
preventative role in vision loss by screening for asymptomatic eye
disease.8,9 The prevalence of asymptomatic eye disease has been
found to be 14 to 26% of patients10Y12 and Quigley13 reports that
less than 50% of patients with glaucoma know they have it.
For symptomatic patients, few would argue against the need for
an eyeexamination.Similarly,forpatients consideredathighriskfor
ocular disorders, e.g. diabetics,14Y16 there is literature rationalizing
eye examination frequency.17 However, the ideal REE frequency in
asymptomatic patients is unknown. Recommendations should be
age dependent as visual outcomes8,18Y20 and costs associated with
vision deficits6 vary with age.
Existing professional guidelines17,21Y23 for REE frequency
(Table 1) are based on expert opinion9 or eye disorder prevalence,8
so it is not surprising that they vary by profession and patient age.
Ophthalmology tends to recommend REEs less frequently than
optometry. This difference could arise from ophthalmology rec-
ommendations being based more on disease detection whereas
optometry may also consider non-disease conditions such as re-
fractive error. Generally, it is recommended that children and older
adults have more frequent REEs than young and middle age adults.
A conflict of interest may be perceived for guidelines developed by
experts whose profession benefits from a high REE frequency.9
Given the basis of current recommendations, the discrepancies
between them, and the potential for conflict of interest, empirical

 evidence on how REE frequency influences eye disorder detection
is needed.
Some research is available to support annual REEs in patients
965 years.8,11,18 Older adults having frequent REEs are less likely
to experience vision loss.9,24 For individuals G65 years, the related
literatureismoresparse.Werner25reviewedthefilesof25-to35-year-
old optometric patients and found Q38% had refractive changes, 4%
had undiagnosed disease, and 15.8% had binocular vision disorders,
when examined within 2 years. Assessment intervals of 2 to 5 years
resulted in higher numbers of significant findings (newly diagnosed
disease, Q0.50D change in refractive error, failure to meet Sheard’s
Criterion for vergence disorders, and decreased amplitude of ac-
commodation for age). A recent study found that a previous-year eye
examination was associated with better vision status in 40- to 65-year-
old patients.26 Fraser et al.27 found a 25% increased odds of pa-
tients (940 years) first presenting with advanced glaucomatous visual
field loss for each year since the last visit to an optometrist. In patients
940 years of age, with normal baseline results, Taylor et al.28 reported
that over a 5-year period, 2.39% had a loss in visual acuity to poorer
than 20/40. Thirty-seven percent of those patients did not notice a
change in vision.
The present study is interested in determining the percentage of
asymptomatic patients for which REEs result in spectacle pre-
scription change, new critical diagnosis, or new management of
existing conditions for six age groups. We also report the median
time intervals between REEs for patients in the different age
groups and compare them to currently recommended guidelines.
METHODS
The Waterloo Eye Study (WatES) is a retrospective cross-sectional
database of patients who presented at the University of Waterloo
Optometry Clinic during a 1-year period from January 2007 to
January 2008. The methods and repeatability of WatES data ab-
straction and population representation have been outlined earlier.29
The study was approved by the Office of Research Ethics at the
University of Waterloo. Data were extracted for all patients whose
reason for presenting was to have a routine eye examination as
reported in the case history (including those presenting for em-
ployment purposes, to obtain contact lenses, or to replace specta-
cles). Those who did not report any eye-related symptoms, even
during case history questioning (e.g. headaches, diplopia, blurred
vision, or flashes and floaters), are referred to hereafter as asymp-
tomatic REE patients. There were some patients who initially
presented for a REE but reported symptoms when specifically
questioned. These patients were excluded from the main analysis,
but their overall percentage of significant change is reported for
comparison.
A spectacle prescription change was considered to be significant
if in at least one eye, the sphere, cylinder, or any reading addition
changed by 90.5D from the entering to the exiting spectacle
prescription, or if the cylinder axis changed as follows: 915 degrees
if the absolute value of the final cylinder value was G1D, 910
degrees if the cylinder was Q1D but G2D, or 95 degrees if the
cylinder was Q2D.30 A critical diagnosis was considered new if it
was not reported in the clinic file case history or at previous ex-
aminations. For patients whose most recent previous assessment
was not performed at the University of Waterloo (n = 742), di-
agnoses were considered to be new if they were not recorded in the
case history. New diagnoses were classified as critical if the dis-
order or abnormal finding resulted in vision loss, could progress to
vision loss or physical discomfort, or had a systemic implication
(see Table 2). A management (not including prescription change)
was considered new if it was not initiated at a previous visit or if
there was a change compared to the last available information.
New managements included referrals, new treatment, or changes
in monitoring schedule.
The numbers of asymptomatic REE patients with significant
change (defined as one or more of a spectacle prescription change,
new critical diagnosis, or new management) since their last assess-
ment were determined for each of the following age groups: G4 years,
4 to G7 years, 7 to G20 years, 20 to G40 years, 40 to G65 years, and
Q65 years. The time between assessments (assessment interval) was
determined from the number of years between the study assessment
and thepatient’s previouseye examination.Assessment intervals were
calculated for all patients whose last eye examination was Q1 year
before the study assessment. The median assessment interval was
calculated for each age group. The numbers of patients with a spectacle
prescription change, new critical diagnosis, new management, or any
of these (significant change) were determined for patients presenting
for a first ever assessment as well as for the following assessment in-
tervals: 1 to G2, 2 to G3, 3 to G5, 5 to G10, and 10+ years since their
previous assessment. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for patient
age, patient sex, assessment interval, and significant change using

RESULTS
The WatESdatabasecontains6397patients,3913(61%)of which
presented for a REE. Of these, 1257 patients reported symptoms
when questioned. Thus, there were 2656 asymptomatic REE patients
(42%ofallpatients),andthisgroupisthefocusofthestudy.Thisgroup
had a median age of 38.5 years, an age range from 0.4 to 93.9 years,
with 48% males; comparable to the entire WatES clinic population.29
Overall,therewere1078(41%)asymptomaticREEpatientswitha
spectacle prescription change, 434 (16%) with a new critical diagnosis,
and 809 (31%) with a new management. In total, 1535 (58%)

 patients had one or more of these outcomes. As age increased, so
did the likelihood of a patient having a significant change (Fig. 1).
Patients G4 years had the lowest prevalence of significant change
(8%), and patients Q65 had the highest (78%). The percentage of
symptomatic REE patients with a significant change was higher
(77%) than that for the asymptomatic REE patients (58%).
Previous assessment dates were available for 2606 (98.1%) of
the asymptomatic REE patients. There were 142 patients having
their first ever eye examination. Of these, 93% were G20 years of
age, 69% G7 years, and 46% G4 years. Breakdown by age group
and category of change can be found in Table 3.
The assessment interval was G1 year for 119 patients, and these
patients along with the first eye examination patients were ex-
cluded from the subsequent analysis. Median assessment interval
values for the remaining 2345 patients, grouped by age, are shown
in Figure 2. Median assessment intervals were greatest for patients
in the 20 to G40 and 40 to G65 age groups, at 2.8 and 2.9 years
between assessments, respectively. The median assessment interval
for patients 7 to G20 years was just over 1.5 years and between 1
and 1.5 years in patients G7 and Q65 years.
Figure 3 shows the effects of age and assessment interval on the
prevalence of having a significant change (N = 2345). Breakdown
by category of change can be found in Table 3. For an assessment
interval 1 to G2 years, Q38% of patients in age groups Q7 had a
significant change. All previously examined patients 4 to G7 years of
age had an assessment interval of G5 years, with 86% of this age group
seen at 1 to G2 years from their last assessment; 11% of these had a
significant change. As necessitated by their age, patients G4 years had
an assessment interval of G3 years. Approximately 92% of these were
seen within 1 to G2 years of their last assessment; close to 5% had a
significantchange.Through logisticregressionanalysis,increasing age
was found to be significantly associated with increased odds of having
a significant change (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.03Y1.04) while con-
trolling for assessment interval and sex. For every 1-year increase in
age,therewasa3%increase intheodds ofhaving asignificantchange.
Similarly, when controlling for age and sex, an increase in assessment
interval was associated with increased likelihood of having a significant
change (OR = 1.06 per year, 95% CI 1.02Y1.11). Patient sex was
not significantly associated with having a significant change (OR =
1.07 for females, 95% CI 0.90Y1.29).

 Figure 4 demonstrates that across all assessment intervals except
Q10 years, the most frequent contributor to a significant change
for the 2487 asymptomatic REE patients was a spectacle prescription
change,followedbyachangeinmanagementand,lastly,anewcritical
diagnosis. The prevalence of any significant change as well as a change
in each category appears to increase with longer assessment intervals
(Fig. 4, Table 3). Exceptions include spectacle prescription change
andanysignificantchangeat910years,andnewmanagementfor5to
e10 year interval. At 1 to G2 years, nearly 15% of patientshad a new
critical diagnosis which increased to 27% for an interval Q10 years.
Similarly, prevalence of management change ranged from a mini-
mum of 28% between 1 and G2 years to a maximum of 43% at
Q10 years. Prescription changes were lowest at 40% for 1 to G2 years
and highest at 52% for 5 to G10 years. The frequency of patients
with any significant change increased from a minimum of 56% be-
tween1andG2yearstoamaximumof70%between5ande10years.
DISCUSSION
More than half of the asymptomatic patients (58%) who
presented for a REE had a change in ocular status or care compared
with 77% of symptomatic REE patients. In asymptomatic patients,
age was a strong predictor of having a significant change. This was
true regardless of the assessment interval and corresponds well with
known age-related ocular changes such as presbyopia and increasing
prevalence of eye disease.8,18Y20 It also makes sense that as the as-
sessment interval increased, the odds of having a significant change
increased. The longer a patient waits for their next assessment, the
older they will be at presentation, increasing the risk of age-related
conditions. However, we also found an association between assess-
ment interval and detection of a significant change when controlling
for age, so although the association between age and assessment in-
terval does play a role, it is not the sole explanation. Greater assess-
ment intervals would allow more time for a disease or condition to
develop, irrespective of age.
Many factors influence the assessment interval for individual
patients including patient age, cost of examination, insurance
coverage, recommendations given by practitioners or professional
bodies, practice recalls (not applicable at this clinic), as well as
patients’ perceived risk of visual impairment and their under-
standing of the consequences of not seeking eye care. The observed
median assessment interval for the various asymptomatic REE age
groups (how often patients have an REE, Fig. 2) matches more
closely the recommended optometric guidelines21,22 than the age-
related trend in significant change outcomes found in the current
study (Fig. 1). Presumably, this is because this is how they are
instructed by practitioners. REEs for patients aged 20 to 64 years
were not publicly funded except for 8 defined medical conditions.

 Annual REEs for patients G20 and 964 years were publically
funded. Jin et al.31 showed that de-insurance of eye examinations
reduced the uptake of eye examinations for people in lower income
levels. The WatES clinic is in an area of slightly above average socio-
economic status compared to the province of Ontario overall.32
Patients in funded age groups had smaller time intervals between
assessments than non-funded age groups (Fig. 2), suggesting that
those with above average socio-economic status may also be affected
bya lack of insurance or public funding.Furthermore, based on data
from the Canadian Longitudinal National Population Health
Survey,Chanetal.33foundthatforpatients65yearsorolder,provinces
where REEs were not funded had reduced patient awareness of
glaucoma and cataracts, and increased vision loss.
Comparing our data to the existing literature is difficult because
the age ranges, study populations, conditions evaluated, criteria
for change, exclusion criteria, and dates of studies (which may
reflect scope of practice changes) all vary.12,25,27 Fraser27 studied
patients with newly diagnosed glaucoma and found the adjusted
odds ratio of first presenting with advanced glaucoma increased by
1.25 times per year since their last visit to an optometrist. Al-
though Werner’s25 data were derived from an academic optometric
population, the data covered a more limited age range, potentially a
different patient demographic, had different exclusion criteria, and
was conducted 25 years earlier than WatES. The closest comparison
isour 20toG40years age group and1toG2years assessmentinterval
to their 25- to 35-year-old patients and G24 months assessment
interval. Their finding of 15% of asymptomatic patients having
refractive, disease, or binocular vision problems is considerably lower
than our 58% of asymptomatic patients with a significant change.
Wang et al.12 studied patients who were Q40 years of age from a
primary care clinic in a teaching hospital. Their population was
predominately African American, had a high prevalence of chronic
diseases, and had low socioeconomic status. They found a pre-
valence of unknown eye disease of 43% for a 1 to G2 year as-
sessment interval. WatES new critical diagnosis values for the
only comparable assessment interval were lower, 13 and 28% for
40 to G65 and Q65 years, respectively. Similar to Wang et al.12, we
found an increase in new critical diagnoses for patients 40 to G65
and Q65 years when the assessment interval increased. In contrast
to Wang et al.12, we did not find that persons 40 to G65 were more
likely to have a critical diagnosis of which they were unaware than
those Q65 years.
In the WatES clinic population, the detection of significant
changeforpatientsQ7yearsofageis938%foranassessmentinterval
of 1 to G2 years (Fig. 3). This issubstantial and although wehave not
done an economic analysis, it could be argued that patients 97 years
should have an eye examination every year. In asymptomatic REE
patients G7 years of age, the detection of significant change was
much lower. Given the potential inability of young children to
communicate symptoms and the impact of disorders on visual
development(e.g.amblyopia34),policymakersmaywishtochoosea
lower threshold of detection for this age group when determining
recommended eye examination frequency.
Limitations of the current study include those inherent in a cross-
sectional study design. Although a clinical population may not
represent the general population, it is representative of those who are
actually seeking care. The WatES clinic population does compare
favorably in terms of patient age and sex distribution to a nationwide
survey of Canadian optometric practices.11,29 Robinson11 found
that 32.6% of patients that presented to optometric practices came
for a REE and expressed no concerns compared with 41% of the
WatES clinic patient population classified as asymptomatic REE
patients. Both of these values contradict Michaud and Forcier’s10
claim that asymptomatic patients are rarely seen in an optometry
clinic. It is possible that some patient symptoms and/or findings
were not recorded despite routine questioning of every patient.
Missed examination findings would result in conservative estimates
whereas missed symptoms would overestimate significant changes if
persons who were not truly asymptomatic were inadvertently included.
In general, assessment intervals for the various asymptomatic
REE patient age groups closely match the Canadian Optometric
guidelines. Given an overall 950% detection of significant change,
routine eye examinations do appear to be productive in asymp-
