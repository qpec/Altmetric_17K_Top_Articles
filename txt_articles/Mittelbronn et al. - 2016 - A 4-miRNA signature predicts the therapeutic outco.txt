ABSTRACT
Multimodal therapy of glioblastoma (GBM) reveals inter-individual variability 
in terms of treatment outcome. Here, we examined whether a miRNA signature 
can be defined for the a priori identification of patients with particularly poor 
prognosis.
FFPE sections from 36 GBM patients along with overall survival follow-up were 
collected retrospectively and subjected to miRNA signature identification from 
microarray data. A risk score based on the expression of the signature miRNAs and 
cox-proportional hazard coefficients was calculated for each patient followed by 
validation in a matched GBM subset of TCGA. Genes potentially regulated by the 
signature miRNAs were identified by a correlation approach followed by pathway 
analysis.
A prognostic 4-miRNA signature, independent of MGMT promoter methylation, 
age, and sex, was identified and a risk score was assigned to each patient that 
allowed defining two groups significantly differing in prognosis (p-value: 0.0001, 
median survival: 10.6 months and 15.1 months, hazard ratio = 3.8). The signature 
was technically validated by qRT-PCR and independently validated in an age- and 
sex-matched subset of standard-of-care treated patients of the TCGA GBM cohort 
(n=58). Pathway analysis suggested tumorigenesis-associated processes such as 
immune response, extracellular matrix organization, axon guidance, signalling by 
NGF, GPCR and Wnt. Here, we describe the identification and independent validation 
of a 4-miRNA signature that allows stratification of GBM patients into different 
prognostic groups in combination with one defined threshold and set of coefficients 
that could be utilized as diagnostic tool to identify GBM patients for improved and/
or alternative treatment approaches.

INTRODUCTION
Malignant gliomas account for approximately 70% 
of primary brain tumors diagnosed in adults. Median age 
at diagnosis is 64 years with men being more frequently 
affected than women [1].
Amongst all gliomas, glioblastoma (GBM) is the 
most common and aggressive form [2]. State-of-the-
art treatment of GBM comprises surgical resection and 
adjuvant radiochemotherapy followed by maintenance 
chemotherapy. Implementation of temozolomide (TMZ) 
into the radiochemotherapeutic regime improved 2-year 
survival rates of patients with newly diagnosed malignant 
glioma (mainly GBM) from 11% to 27%, 3-year survival 
rates from 4% to 16%, and 5-year survival rates from 2% 
to 10% [3]. Unfortunately several phase III trials employing 
targeted agents such as bevacizumab (A
V
Aglio & RTOG 
0825) or cilengitide failed to show an improvement in 
overall survival [4, 5]. Thus, TMZ-based radiochemotherapy 
remains standard treatment for GBM. However, prognosis 
of most GBM patients still remains dismal with a high rate 
of local recurrence, emphasizing the clear need for further 
optimization [6]. At present, several strategies are being 
followed in this regard: Firstly, more elaborate imaging 
techniques as well as improved image-guidance during 
radiotherapy are being tested [7, 8]. Secondly, various 
molecularly designed substances are undergoing pre-
clinical and clinical testing for their therapeutic efficacy 
in combination with radio(chemo)therapy [9, 10]. These 
targeted treatment approaches require molecular stratification 
of patients in order to identify the subgroups that can benefit 
most from a given strategy. Classical radiochemotherapy 
also displays wide inter-individual differences in terms of 
response and survival rates [11]. Accordingly, numerous 
efforts are undertaken in order to characterize the molecular 
mechanisms orchestrating therapy sensitivity and resistance 
and to identify prognostic and predictive markers.
So far, only few prognostic factors have been defined 
for GBM, including age and Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) score. In addition, involvement of the 
subventricular zone and extent of resection are known to be of 
prognostic importance [12]. More recently, the first molecular 
markers have been established. In this regard, methylation 
of the O6-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) 
promoter region was recognized to be of positive predictive 
value for the efficacy of TMZ-based radiochemotherapy, 
and molecular profiling of long-term survivors disclosed 
the positive prognostic value of a proneural-like expression 
pattern linked to mutations in the genes encoding for iso-
citrate dehydrogenases 1/2 (IDH1/2) [13].
During the last years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have 
increasingly received attention. With a high degree of 
promiscuity miRNAs target and regulate several mRNA 
species encoding for proteins involved in various signaling 
pathways [14]. Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNA 
expression signatures can serve as biomarkers for diagnosis 
and risk assessment of diverse malignancies, including GBM 
[15–20]. Given that the available prognostic markers can 
segregate GBM patients only to a limited extent, additional 
markers and/or signatures have to be defined. We focused on 
miRNA profiles, because the characterization of epigenetic 
alterations in the field of GBM research has hitherto been 
underrepresented and miRNA expression is well accessible 
from clinical routine diagnostic tissue specimen such as 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections [21].
We sought to delineate a miRNA expression signature 
that is of predictive/prognostic value for overall survival 
in a retrospective cohort of 36 primary GBM patients who 
underwent adjuvant radiochemotherapy. Applying an iterative 
forward selection approach on miRNA microarray expression 
data, we identified a distinct signature comprising 4 miRNAs 
that was technically confirmed by quantitative real-time 
PCR (qRT-PCR) and independently validated in an age- 
and sex-matched data subset of a cohort of GBM patients 
who received standard-of-care treatment, obtained from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov) project 
[22, 23, 3, 24]. Multivariate analysis revealed this signature 
to be independent of the MGMT promoter methylation status 
and of any other prognostic parameters that were available 
for our dataset.
RESULTS
Characterization of the patient cohort: survival 
data and univariate analysis
The MGMT promoter methylation status had no 
statistically significant influence on overall survival 
(p-value=0.763), although in Kaplan-Meier analysis a 
trend towards better survival could be observed in MGMT 
methylated patients. (Supplementary Figure S1) We also 
did not find statistically significant associations of overall 
survival with age (p-value=0.053) and sex (p-value=0.222).
Extraction of a low complexity miRNA signature 
and evaluation of its prognostic significance for 
overall survival
We analyzed miRNA expression profiles in FFPE 
samples of our patient cohort and extracted a signature 
that consisted of the four miRNAs hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-let-
7b-5p, hsa-miR-125a-5p and hsa-miR-615-5p which was 
statistically significantly associated with overall survival 
(p-value=0.0048). The median risk score calculated from 
the expression levels of the signature miRNAs and the 
corresponding cox-proportional hazard coefficients (Table 
1) separated the patients into a high- and a low-risk group. 
Cox regression analysis of the high- and the low-risk groups 
revealed a 3.79 fold increased risk of death (95% CI: 2.03-
12.85) for the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group 
(p-value=0.000112). The median survival time was 13.5 
months for patients of the high- risk group and 18.4 months 
 Oncotarget

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
for patients of the low-risk group, respectively. These results 
were visualized by Kaplan-Meier overall survival curves 
(Figure 1B). Univariate testing of the individual miRNAs 
within the signature revealed p-values in the range between 
0.0015 and 0.016, indicating that each single miRNA was 
able to statistically significantly predict overall survival. 
Expressions of miRNAs hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-let-7b-5p and 
hsa-miR-125a-5p positively correlated with overall survival 
and and that of hsa-miR-615-5p negatively correlated 
with overall survival. Figure 1A summarizes the survival 
data of the patients in relation to the calculated risk scores 
and expression levels. When including MGMT promoter 
methylation status in a multivariate cox-proportional hazard 
model, its contribution to the model was not statistically 
significant, thereby suggesting that the identified miRNA 
signature performs independently of the MGMT promoter 
methylation status. Moreover, the other available clinical 
parameters, such as sex and age were not associated with the 
calculated risk-score and also did not statistically significantly 
contribute to the multivariate model when included. A 
detailed representation of the results can be found in Table 1. 
Further, patients in the high-risk group were older compared 
to that in the low-risk group. Concerning distribution of sex 
there were no differences between the high- and the low-risk 
groups (Figure 1C).
Independent in silico validation of the detected 
miRNA signature
For the purpose of independent validation the miRNA 
signature was tested in an age-matched miRNA data subset 
of standard-of-care treated patients (see Supplementary

Table S1) of an independent GBM cohort downloaded from 
the TCGA database [25]. The high- and the low-risk groups 
were defined by using the median risk score of the discovery 
set (0.07811832) to dichotomize the patients of the validation 
set. The resulting cox-proportional hazard model revealed a 
hazard ratio of 2.11 (95% CI 1.13-3.91) and a p-value of 0.02 
(Figure 2C). Figure 2B summarizes the survival data of the 
patients of the validation cohort in relation to calculated risk 
scores and expression levels. Also for the validation cohort 
no statistically significant association was found between 
high- and low-risk groups and the parameters age and sex 
(Figure 2D). Univariate testing of the MGMT promoter 
methylation status derived from two DNA methylation array 
probes that have been shown previously to reliably measure 
MGMT promoter methylation status for association with 
overall survival was conducted. No statistically significant 
association was observed (cg12434587: p.value: 0.122/
hazard-ratio: 0.48, cg12981137: p-value: 0.16/hazard-ratio: 
0.48) although in Kaplan-Meier analysis a trend towards 
better survival in MGMT promoter methylation positive 
was also observable here (Supplementary Figure S2). No 
differences in the distribution of age and sex were observed 
in the high- and low-risk groups identified in the validation 
cohort. Also, including in the multivariate cox model 
MGMT promoter methylation status did not show statistical 
significant influence on survival (Table 1).

Technical validation of signature by qRT-PCR
In order to technically validate the 4-miRNA 
signature and to support potential applicability 
in clinical routine diagnostics, we measured the 
expression of the four miRNAs in a subset of samples 
(n=23), for which residual material was available by 
qRT-PCR. Analogous cox-proportional hazard analysis 
with the qRT-PCR data confirmed the results obtained 
with the miRNA array data. Patients of the high-risk 
group revealed significantly impaired overall survival 
(p-value=0.043) and a hazard-ratio of 3.21 (95% CI 
1.02-10.16) as compared to patients of the low-risk 
group. (Figure 1A).
miRNA-mRNA correlation and pathway 
enrichment analysis
For hsa-let-7b-5p we identified 104 significantly 
correlating genes (53 negative and 51 positive 
correlations), for hsa-miR-125a-5p 112 genes (35 
negative and 77 positive correlations), for hsa-miR-615-
5p 26 genes (10 negative and 16 positive correlations) 
and for hsa-let-7a-5p 412 genes (245 negative and 
167 positive correlations). The overlap between genes 
correlating with expression of the signature miRNAs 
was sparse (Supplementary Figure S1). Heatmaps of 
the top 25 miRNA-mRNA correlations with regard to 
absolute correlation coefficients are depicted in Figure 3.

Interestingly, whereas hsa-let-7b-5p, hsa-miR-125a-5p, 
and hsa-let-7a-5p displayed predominantly negative 
correlations among the top correlations as to be expected, 
hsa-miR-615-5p also showed positive correlations. All 
genes with significant correlations (Pearson correlation 
test, p-value < 0.01) were combined into one list of 
genes (n=654; Supplementary Table S2) and subjected 
to pathway enrichment analysis. In total, 28 statistically 
significant pathways were identified (Supplementary 
Table S3), and the top ten of these (i.e. Transmembrane 
transport of small molecules, Innate Immune System, 
Extracellular matrix organization, Axon guidance, 
Signalling by NGF, Developmental Biology, Neuronal 
System, GPCR downstream signaling, Signaling by 
GPCR and Signaling by Wnt) were considered for 
interpretation of results.
DISCUSSION
GBM patients, who receive surgical resection and 
postoperative radio(chemo)therapy, reveal profound 
differences in terms of overall survival which motivated 
us to search for a miRNA signature that allows the 
identification of patients with specifically poor prognosis 
independently 
of 
any 
other 
outcome-associated 
parameters. Moreover, we intended to investigate such 
a signature with regard to the molecular mechanisms 
potentially underlying the poor outcome of GBM patients.

To this end, we performed miRNA microarray 
analysis followed by low-complexity miRNA signature 
identification. We could extract a 4-miRNA signature 
which, with high statistical significance, allowed 
differentiating between high- and low-risk GBM patients 
independently of the MGMT methylation status. Technical 
validation by qRT-PCR confirmed the microarray data 
results. Most importantly, the prognostic value of the 
signature could be confirmed by independent validation in 
a large subset of the TCGA study on GBM [25].
At present, the role of individual miRNAs in GBM 
is poorly understood. miRNAs are small non-coding 
regulatory RNAs that reduce stability and/or inhibit 
translation of target mRNAs with full or partial sequence-
complementarity [14]. In this sense, they are important 
post-transcriptional regulators and play essential roles in 
the pathogenesis, development, and progression of cancer 
as well as in the response to therapy [26–28].
It has been shown that GBMs display distinct 
miRNA expression signatures, and several studies have 
linked these miRNA alterations to hallmarks of GBM, 
including proliferation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis, 
and stem cell-like behavior [29]. Moreover, resistance to 
TMZ might be associated with miRNA deregulation [30]. 
In this regard, Ciafre et al. studied the expression of 245 
microRNAs in GBM in comparison to normal brain tissue 
using a microarray technique [31] in comparison to normal 
brain tissue. This approach enabled the identification of 
miRNAs whose expression levels were significantly 
altered in tumor tissue compared to peripheral brain 
tissue of the same patient, including miR-221, which was 
strongly up-regulated in GBM, and a set of brain-enriched 
miRNAs (miR-128, miR-181a, miR-181b, and miR-181c), 
which were down-regulated in GBM [32]. Very recently, 
a number of prognostic miRNA signatures have been 
reported for GBM [33–35, 15, 36, 37, 18–20, 38, 39]. We 
compared these signatures with our signature in terms of 
complexity, independent validation, and the approach used 
for identification of the signature. One important feature 
of molecular signatures is their level of complexity (i.e. 
the number of miRNAs), which should be most optimal 
with regard to prediction performance but at the same time 
should not overfit the data. For data sets with moderate 
dimensionality such as miRNA microarray data sets 
with typically a few hundreds of miRNAs expressed, the 
number of features contained in a signature should be 
of low complexity and in the range of smaller than 10. 
From the above cited studies, only five extracted a miRNA 
signature with low complexity that have been subsequently 
validated in an independent cohort [15, 37, 18–20]. Cheng 
et al. [15] focused on MGMT promoter methylation 
positive tumors only and defined a 5-miRNA signature 
that was validated in an appropriate subset of the so-called 
Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas. In contrast, our signature 
was developed using data from both MGMT promoter 
methylation-positive and -negative tumors. The signatures 
described by Li et al. were developed for each of the five 
molecular GBM subtypes as defined by transcriptomic 
profiling of TCGA GBM cases [37, 40]. Only the signature 
for the ‘mesenchymal‘ subtype consisting of five miRNAs 
was independently validated in a set of GBM tissues [37]. 
Our signature, in contrast, is not limited to this molecular 
subtype only. The small-noncoding RNAs described in 
Manterola et al. [18] allow molecular diagnosis of GBM 
using blood serum samples but the authors did not show 
usability with regard to outcome prediction whilst our 
signature was particularly developed for the purpose 
of predicting survival outcome. In a study by Shou et 
al. [20] three miRNAs were presented that statistically 
significantly allow differentiation into groups of patients 
with favorable and unfavorable prognosis. However, this 
approach was limited to separate and univariate analysis 
for each of the three miRNAs and the study did not include 
an independent validation of the results. The report by 
Sana et al. is most comparable to our study and introduced 
a 6-miRNA-signature which was also validated in the 
TCGA GBM data set [19]. However, contrary to our study 
Sana et al. used different thresholds for the calculated 
risk scores of the discovery and the validation set. Most 
importantly, the thresholds were chosen in such a way that 
they statistically significantly separated the two resulting 
groups of patients [19]. This can be interpreted as a 
technical drawback, and the approach has to be considered 
as a biased one. In strong contrast, we applied the same 
cox-proportional hazard coefficients and the same risk 
score thresholds to all of our three datasets (discovery 
Febit microarray, discovery qRT-PCR and validation 
Agilent microarray). This renders our 4-miRNA-signature, 
in principle, applicable to any other data set regardless of 
the platform the data were generated with.
Comparing our signature with that of the above 
mentioned studies did show no overlapping miRNAs 
of our signature with of the published ones. This can be 
explained by the fact that signature identification is very 
much dependent on the methodology used, the dataset 
with regard to the specific selection criteria of patients 
and the platform that is used for measurements. Since all 
mentioned studies vary with regard to these parameters 
one could not expect overlap of our signature with the 
published ones or overlap between the published ones.
 Besides its prognostic value, it is of major interest 
to understand the impact of the 4-miRNA-signature 
on the biological characteristics of GBM. Our panel of 
miRNAs consists of hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-let-7b-5p, hsa-
miR-125a-5p and hsa-miR-615-5p. Two miRNAs of 
the signature belong to the let-7 family, which is very 
well known for its tumor suppressor function in various 
cancer entities [41]. The two let-7 miRNAs hsa-let-7a-
5p and hsa-let-7b-5p showed a tendency towards higher 
expression levels in the low-risk compared to the high-
risk group of patients, which is in line with the concept 
of their involvement in tumor suppression. miR-125a-

5p was described as a tumor suppressor in GBM only 
recently. It is engaged in the repression of target genes 
of the TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-
binding motif) transcription factor, including connective 
tissue growth factor (CTGF) and survivin [42]. Our 
analysis revealed a tendency towards higher miR-125a-
5p expression levels in the low-risk compared to the 
high-risk group of patients, again supporting its role in 
tumor suppression. hsa-miR-615-5p was described to act 
as tumor suppressor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
[17]. In our analyses, a clear tendency towards higher or 
lower expression levels of hsa-miR-615-5p in the low- and 
high-risk group of patients was not observable. Therefore, 
conclusions concerning its tumorsuppressive role in GBM 
cannot be drawn. Overall, our 4-miRNA-signature reflects 
trends of higher expression levels of tumor suppressive 
miRNAs in low-risk GBMs, supporting the notion that 
these GBMs exhibit a lower degree of malignancy due to 
operational tumor suppressive mechanisms. In order to 
gain insights into the putative functional role of the four 
signature miRNAs, we conducted miRNA-transcriptome 
correlation analyses and obtained 654 genes, whose 
expression levels were positively or negatively correlated 
with that of the miRNAs. We deliberately followed 
this approach to identify direct and indirect regulatory 
effects of the signature miRNAs on the transcriptome. 
An alternative approach would have been to utilize 
miRNA target prediction. This, however, relies strongly 
on the prediction algorithm and the database that are 
used, and databases providing information on in vitro 
validated miRNA targets are still limited with regard to 
the number of miRNAs they provide information on [43]. 
The genes that were identified in our correlation approach 
were subjected to pathway enrichment analyses, which 
disclosed the top ten pathways Transmembrane transport 
of small molecules, Innate Immune System, Extracellular 
matrix organization, Axon guidance, Signalling by 
NGF, Developmental Biology, Neuronal System, GPCR 
downstream signaling, Signaling by GPCR and Signaling 
by Wnt all of which very well known in the context of 
glioblastoma tumorigenesis. These results suggest that our 
4-miRNA signature regulates genes that are well known 
to be involved in the tumorigenesis, progression and 
migration of GBM and may potentially act as druggable 
targets in an alternative treatment approach.
CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, we extracted and validated a 
4-miRNA-signature, which allows to differentiate GBM 
patients undergoing surgical resection and subsequent 
radio(chemo)therapy with favorable and poor prognosis. 
This signature may serve as a potential new marker for 
patient stratification independent of the MGMT methylation 
status. It may furthermore pave the way for personalized 
treatment approaches based on measurements that are 
well feasible in GBM biopsies in the clinical routine. 
Patients with a high-risk score are likely not profiting from 
standard-of-care treatment and therefore the 4-miRNA 
signature could be used to identify patients who require 
therapy intensification. Compared to existing GBM 
miRNA signatures the herein presented signature is of lower 
complexity, was independently validated, and appears to be 
in principle applicable to any data set containing expression 
values of the four signature miRNAs regardless of the 
platform they were generated with.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
For a detailed description of Material and Methods 
sections ’Patient characteristics’, ’miRNA array analysis’, 
’Technical validation of the 4-miRNA signature by qRT-
PCR’ and ’miRNA-mRNA correlation and gene set 
enrichment analysis’ see Supplementary Data.
Patient characteristics
We examined FFPE tissue samples of a non-
selected, retrospective cohort of patients who were 
consecutively treated at the University hospital Frankfurt 
between 1/2009 and 12/2010. Ethics approval (4/09) 
was given by the ethics committee of the medical 
faculty of the Johann-Goethe University (Frankfurt am 
Main, Germany). Only patients who underwent surgical 
resection and post-operative radio(chemo)therapy were 
included into the analyses. Patients underwent resection 
and adjuvant radiotherapy, regularly combined with 
TMZ according to the EORTC/NCIC26981/22981-
NCIC CE3 protocol if no contraindications were 
present (for details see Table 2) [3, 24]. The median 
overall survival time of this patient cohort was 1.28 
years with a median follow-up of 1.99 years (95%-CI, 
634 - 816 days). MGMT promoter methylation status 
was available for all 36 cases (see Table 1). Karnofsky 
performance status (KPS) score and associated recursive 
partitioning analysis (RPA) class had not been collected 
systematically, and no data on the extent of resection 
was available. For independent validation, the miRNA 
expression dataset from an age- and sex-matched subset 
(n=58) of the TCGA GBM cohort (n=357) was used. The 
subset resulted after adjusting the distribution of age of

the whole TCGA GBM dataset to that of our discovery 
cohort (Table 3) and only selecting patients that were 
treated according to standard-of-care.
miRNA array analysis
miRNA analysis was carried out using the Geniom 
Biochip MPEA homo sapiens biochips containing 
1223 miRNA probes (CBC, Heidelberg, Germany). 
FFPE sample preparation, hybridization, washing 
and scanning of arrays was performed as described 
previously [44]. We applied ’winsorized mean’ scaling 
on normalized data with exclusion of 30% of the top 
and bottom values.
TCGA glioblastoma miRNA data set
The validation data set was constructed from 
miRNA microarray profiles of the matched subset of 
patients from the TCGA GBM cohort. Data were generated 
by the University of North Carolina Cancer Genomic 
Characterization Center (CGCC) using the Agilent 8x15K 
Human miRNA-specific microarray platform [22]. For 
the analysis level 3 data were used and in order to allow 
comparability of the data set with the discovery data set 
scaling with ’winsorized mean’ was applied as described 
above.
miRNA signature robust selection
In order to search for a miRNA signature in miRNA 
expression data set of the discovery cohort associated with 
patient survival, the R package rbsurv was used [45]. The 
forward-selection algorithm implemented in the package 
computed the partial likelihood of the Cox model for a 
sequential selection of miRNAs. The best performing 
model was chosen based on the Akaike Information 
Criterion (AIC), which allowed to determine the best 
trade-off between the complexity of a model and its 
goodness of fit.
Calculation of risk scores
The Cox model coefficients (Table 2) were 
multiplied with the scaled expression values of appropriate 
miRNAs and the products were summed up resulting in 
an individual risk score for each patient. The median risk 
score of all patients (0.07811832) was used as a cut-off for 
defining a high-risk (> median risk score) and a low-risk 
group (< median risk score). Subsequently, the log-rank 
test was used to test whether the differences in overall 
survival times between the resulting two groups were 
statistically significant (p-value threshold: 0.05). Further, 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted for the two 
groups and the hazard ratio was calculated. The influence

of the available known risk factors age, sex, and MGMT 
promoter methylation status was assessed univariately and 
by inclusion into the multivariate cox-proportional hazard 
model.
Independent in silico validation of the 4-miRNA 
signature
For each of the 58 included TCGA GBM patients 
(Supplementary Table S1) we calculated a risk score by 
building the sum of the products of the expressions of the 
four miRNAs of the signature and the coxproportional 
hazard coefficients obtained from the initial dataset for 
each of the miRNAs (Table 2).
The patients were assigned to high- and low-risk 
groups by using the same threshold (0.07811832) that 
was defined for the discovery data set. The resulting two 
groups were tested for differential survival outcome using 
log-rank test.
Technical validation of the 4-miRNA signature 
by qRT-PCR
MiScript primer assays (QIAGEN, MD, USA) for 
the four miRNAs of the signature were used for relative 
quantification along with a reference assay for the small 
RNA SNORD61. The relative expression values in 
combination with the cox-proportional hazard coefficients 
were used to calculate a risk score for every patient. The 
patients were dichotomized into a low- and high-risk 
group using the risk score threshold from the discovery 
cohort (0.07811832) and the resulting two groups were 
tested for differences in overall survival using log-rank 
test of the resulting cox-proportinal hazard model.
miRNA-mRNA correlation and gene set 
enrichment analysis
In order to investigate the impact of the four signature 
miRNAs on the transcriptome level we downloaded the 
transcriptome data (level 3) of the cases matching the 
miRNAs data set (n=132) from the TCGA database and 
calculated correlations between the four signature miRNAs 
and expression levels of all genes. Genes that statistically 
significantly correlated with the signature miRNAs were 
subjected to pathway enrichment analysis.
MGMT promoter methylation typing
For the discovery cohort determination of MGMT 
promoter methylation was performed using both 
methylation-specific PCR and sequencing analysis as 
described previously [46, 47].
For the TCGA validation cohort no systematic 
assessment of the MGMT promoter methylation status was 
available. However, in order to determine methylation of 
the MGMT promoter we followed an approach published 
by Bady et al. from methylation array data [48]. The 
resulting MGMT promoter-positive and -negative groups 
were then subsequently tested for association with survival 
univariately and multivariately.
